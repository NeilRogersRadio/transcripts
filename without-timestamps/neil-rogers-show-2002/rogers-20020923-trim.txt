This is how Florida's only real source of your WQA, Miami Fort Lauderdale, a busy podcast kitchen. And WQAM.com Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, right, alright, alright. You've heard the secrets behind the Dom who's saying's Mr. It's like that. Just have the story. Find out who's the Dom who's saying really is. When ABC confronts the Dom who's saying's Baby's Mama. The Dom, sorry, I've been never saying it. And where is my check on? He always like a never old time. He's a Dom who's saying the most methodical error bleeder in the 20th century. Find out the deep secrets of the Dom who's saying. I felt this would've come pick me up and he came and picked me up on his busted ass camera. I can't move on the blind and that camera will spin on my dash. She can always like, uh, uh, uh. Find out how he really is in bed. I don't know how he has to keep his T-Wives. If he was, he could even hang 15 seconds with me, okay? Oh, that's why they just stay with him. Why did I say with him? He got dollars. Okay, he got business, business, business, business, all the bees. Okay, he got paid for me. But don't miss the Dom's Baby's Mama. Can I give pay for this? Tonight on ABC. Oh, I know two of five 60. W-W-U-M-Happy Monday to demand what a beautiful day. Sun is shining. It's 50 degrees. Going to be like 70, 70, do they? How about there? It's actually been fairly nice. It was a nice weekend. Oh, right. Excellent. So everybody's happy. Going to start getting colder this weekend. No, follows here in the north. Going to see those leaves turning. Going to freeze our ass off anyway. So our pull over the way all before we get to the pool. You know, John Turchin is on America's most wanted? No. There you go. I just barely sit the set down. Is that my ass down here? Now, already you learned something. How do you like that? He's wanted. He's one of America's most wanted. He's on that show. Which is a great show, of course. John Turchin who used to be on Channel 7 News, right? And who do you think put him on here? The first newscast on the radio in South Florida? Oh, God. I love his news many years ago. Back when we used to work with Cori Zawado back in my eight to midnight days. And in midnight, John Turchin and Cori Zawado and I would go to Lums. Number Lums didn't they name that after Lums from Lumman Amner? Right. That's what I'm hearing. That's a popular rumor around town. John Turchin makes the big town at the Maraneshawader, John. So anyway, we had 1,400 and 7 votes on a pull. The only problem with that is see some people would say, Well, she's either the complainant. We had back in March 10th. We had 1,525. The difference being that back then they were all legitimate. And they're not votes. And just it's just a survey. Which one of these are you or religious survey? Which all let's say they do it once a year from now on. Any 10 we repeat something. The response is always way down in addition, which like I told you before the show today, it's a middle of September. As compared to the middle of March, and then you go to September, there's like, what would you say? 30, 40% of the people aren't there yet? The snowboard. Right. Sure. They're not there. We're talking to ourselves basically. We got just like a skeleton crew. Today's the big day by the way before we get to the results of the pull. And given the new pull, which I think is going to get you some, it'll get some results today. Some real ones. Some real round. Maybe some real ones are not. And by the way, you assholes out there that keep dick and with stuff. Sick and sick and sick and sick and sick and sick. And you know, who do you know, who do you people kid you idiots you? You clowns. You morons. You might have gone. But you know, keeps you off the streets like I always tell you. How come my thing isn't refreshing now? Oh, it's refreshing. Is it? Brisk and refreshing. Well, mine is not mine is like kind of. Stay it. You know, I'm a smell. How about that to two good broad. You think we need to see or more. Oh, oh, oh, yeah. Just put it. This goes to show you how sick the media is. This bitch beats the crap out of her little girl gets caught. This traveler bitch, which I got stuff about the average travelers in a minute. When we get to it. And, and now all of a sudden, she's a celebrity. She's not making the rounds and all the talk in head shows. It's it's sex since we got this 24 hour news thing. It's it's changed the whole concept of what life is all about. She's on her birthday. Oh, well, gee, you know, I just lost my temper and there's a lesson to be looked. And of course, to top it all off, she's like kind of a, you know, should have been fixed. She should have been surgically fixed. Sixth total walleye bug one. Exactly. And don't be insulting Malai about whatever. You know, look at how Wickons and six and six and six and Wickons and six and back and forth. And then can those votes in chunks. So we had like 240 votes on a poll over the weekend of a disgrace. So we got a big day today boys and girls. Let me tell you two reasons why today's a big day. It's a big day for George. It is. Did you know that, did you know? Well, why not today's a trend is coming out of one o'clock, which, you know, we don't want to enter our main dog show. I knew about that. Well, yeah, but that's going to be way heavily on your shoulders because the months are going to be. And then you're lying August. So that's like huh? Yeah. It's two thirds of the summer book. And that's basically the majority of time when you were on because what, when to held that I, I don't know. Yeah, that's right. So that came back to the full schedule August 26, which would be after the, this trend. And I'll tell you who else it's going to be a big trend for. What I don't want to say there's any connection between the fact that somebody's ratings in a morning of a really crap, but the beast is not going to be his on vacation this week. And when it comes back next week is not going to be on the morning show. We'll not be working on the more Howard show. And of course, they're the usual denials from sub management types of which we had about 200 in the building now. Oh, no, it's got nothing to do with Mo. It's, uh, he's got a busy schedule with a hercouns and he's got this. Well, that's not the room around the rest of the building. I'll take it that. Okay. But it's not just Mo. That's always been the case with the morning show even back when, uh, back when the worst team was there. Right. Always had to have a scapegoat. The book would come out. They'd have a bad book or a couple of bad trends. Oh, well, let's find somebody to fire so we can blame them for it. Remember Donnie B? Of course. Bad guest band. Couldn't book it today. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, brother. It's from the Brook Daniels Randy Rhodes School of scapegoating the producer. See, people don't tune into a radio show because they like to produce her. People don't turn into a radio show, especially a sports show because they got great guests. I mean, on this stage, it's the same people all the time anyway. You got your Pat Riley and you got your B no girl. Oh, speaking of B no look at that bad news. It must be the, must be the Humperers on route today back from whatever NFL game was covering yesterday. Because we got at the three the Seth noon boy, a fate where you know, what are the Humperers numbers been going in the crapper lately? Too much. Terrific act between three and six thirty today. Oh, God. Hank will be back tomorrow though. Make no mistake. Be sure and run around town. Tell everybody about that. The homperon be back tomorrow. How about those a Patriots? They made it a setting there in the end. In fact, the Adolphins after play in Kansas City next week. That could be a real test because Kansas City is a scoring machine. They got no defense, but they're a scoring machine. So naturally, we made it exciting enough to send it in over time. So Adam Vennity, it could win it with a field goal. But how about that time, Brady and Troy Brown? Oh, woo. Man unbelievable. And of course, like I told you, that dolphins pushed over the United States. Did I tell you that the jet sucked? Another girl's team. I don't know what they got like a last play schedule of dolphins. They play all girls teams. But next week could be a different story. Okay. Let's get back to the survey. Okay. Semi annual religion pool, which we should have just forgot about it. Which one are you? We'll go through this again until March. Mark it down. March 10th. We'll do it again in March. And only once a year. Because when you repeat things, they don't want to be bothered with it. And the poll in March, we had 800 atheist diagnostics. That wouldn't you think that that would be the one category on the show of all shows that would like hold up their big time? You'd think. Well, we're the hell that they all disappear to. Agnostic 314, atheist 257, so he had those together. You got 671 as opposed to 800. Now, well, you know, you had to count for the fact there are a lot of people still out of town. But nonetheless, Catholics 231 in the pool in March, it was 260 year or two. So that's pretty close. The sick and wick. You notice how they're even even Steven. There's 220 votes. We're not going to dignify with a response. Jewish 125, now last time we broke it down Orthodox. Reformed and conservative. We didn't bother with that this time. 125, Protestant 110, born again Christians actually went up. Oh, LA, Lua, baby. The born again Christians are getting into the show now. 54. And you want an alikus they're waiting for them again. They want to hear a person show. I don't know what you're laughing about. Do do do do do do. You've got to cut it out, Mr. You're going to burn in hell. Buddhist 12, Shinto 12, which we didn't have Shinto's on last time. And we apologize to the seven day Adventist. We like your scraple. We left them off this time. It had 14 last time. And it probably were looking to get on a pool this time. And couldn't find it. We apologize, don't we? That little bit. No. Shinto's 12. Your hope is witnesses. 10. What do we have last time? 21. Oh, don't tell me we've offended your hope is witnesses. Maybe they became bored again Christians. That could be it. Maybe that's where the other ones came from. Muslim eight, Mormon six. We had eight Mormons last time. Only six this time. Very depressing. Hindu four sign tell this for. And Christian scientists. We had three. Probably reporting to Tom Cruise in the. Lisa Marie every day. Do you hear what they said on that show? Oh, those are the sign tell I just remember. So it's a big day today. One o'clock. We got to try and come out. Now what's the other reason it's a big day? Oh, it might be cause it want a clock. Our Toronto engineers going to be here in this little studio mine. And this beautiful little studio. And guess what he's going to fix today boys and girls. The phone. Welcome. Yeah, that's right. So that leaves into our poll questions for today, which I'm sure Eric is sitting on Pins and he does on the end of it. Is little sofa. Hello, an airspace probably a big sofa with a big wippy cushion. Here's our poll question today. We're going to get the phone's fix today. And he said something about messing with the equalization or the something. Which I sure hope he doesn't because do you does it sound to you? Like we have any kind of a problem. No, it sounds great. Sounds better than did before I went off the Amsterdam, doesn't it? Indeed it does. Sounds excellent. We do not talk it over each other. And you sound like you're sitting right across the room, which would be on that little balcony out there. Don't lean back. It's several stories down. There he goes. But so I hope he doesn't mess with that. But of course, knowing our engineers and I'm sure he'll be on the foam with mini Bob when he comes here. I want to collect. But the phones are going to be fixed, which leads to the possibility that we can take phone calls on and show again. We've got five choices. Wow. I like to give a lot of choices. Yes, please. Exclamation point. Yes, but only a few. Maybe one day a week. Absolutely not. Please. Exclamation point. Or if he does, I'll blow my brains out. Exclamation point. What do you think? I know it. Carlos is voting for. I see. Should Neil have a call? I think. I'll call. I see. Should Neil start taking calls on. I sure again. Oh, Carlos. Don't do it. Yes, please. Exclamation point. Yes, but only a few. Maybe one day a week. Absolutely not. Please. Exclamation point. And if he does, I'll blow my brains out. Exclamation point. There's the Polaric. Yeah. We're going to have that all our atheist diagnostics go. Well, I probably thought about it. Speaking of Poles before we do the break. Newsweek pool. Right up to date. And this week's Newsweek, which has got the front cover story about how we made the put Sodom made a morning yesterday, which I got the part of that for you. Newsweek pool. How does the Bush administration done a good job of explaining US policy to Iraq? 26,000 responses give or take. Yes, 34 percent. No, 60 percent. Don't know. 5 percent. You got that? Yes. He's done a good job of explaining. 34 percent. No. 60 percent. I'll nearly 30,000 responses. In Newsweek, hardly a liberal rag. Okay. I just mentioned that in passing. 913 at 560 WQM.

It's the sensitive soprano. I thought I'd give you a new dress. I hope she's likes the colour. It's a colour of my new machine gun. Thanks, you're so thoughtful. You're a real jan. I'm sorry, but what I said in your bed. I promise next time nothing bigger than a chihuahua. The sensitive soprano's. You're Tony. Thanks for claiming the dead body's off the carpet. You're real domestic a paving. By the thing. Hey, you know what? I left a category off of there. Just when Eric got the whole pull up there and I got to make him put another one on her. Sorry, Eric. Makes no difference to me. Oh, I'm pretty good, right. Sure. In other words, we got that one percentage. I don't know what the percentage is, but there's a percentage of the audience. That they don't care. They're so loyal and they're so obsessed of cest. Then if I said here, going, and as long as they knew it was me going, like that, or if I was just going, like that. They would listen religiously for hours every day, every single day. That's right. Well, find out how many of us in when George was on the summer come our morning. When we dissect all those numbers in the trend, June, July, and August, this is going to be pressure. Have we do any baby? Don't you feel the pressure? Yes, I do. I'll be right back. Probably because you didn't go out and take your craft this morning. That's the news for the audience, by the way, who keep track George went out and took a leak this morning, but not a crap, which I can't believe that. Took one before I left. I see. Only one. Just one. Oh, the word around town is Joe Rosen, Charles L. Moore, our badmouthing somebody on the station. Don't know what I'm mentioning, names. Okay, so there we go. Makes no difference. That was quick. Jesus, God. Look at that. But his Eric is on top of it today, man. He's probably the one who voted for all those sick and wicked. He's probably done it, just to be a smart ass. He always got kind of a strange sense of humor. Yeah. Yes. No to that. Oh, oh. We start out. 10,000 and two votes. Eric, like I said, you need some mental help. No, maybe that's just an aberration. Okay, or maybe that just can be normal. No, he did that to crack you up. He'll fix it. Oh, well, he did want to show that he can read the poll too if it really came in. I know that. He can read it and a poll too. Court day today for video tape mom and it come to find out that she's an Irish traveler. This bitch who's now a media celebrity. Just just like those three. Oh, and then Michael Mayo, which I wouldn't waste the time. I wouldn't dignify him by reading it on the ear. He's got this hearts and flourishing where he rips the guy from the medical school there in Miami because they initially said that the three, those three are schmaktaheads couldn't go to school, but they're eventually going to like change your mind when the publicity dies down. And he's ripping his guy. These three clowns, I'm not by any standards. They deserve whatever to hell they get. Take enough stories about, wow, we're going to do this and we're going to blow it up. And if you don't believe this broad, I mean, there's no way that anybody, no matter what kind of a scumbag she might be, no matter how big it is she might be alleged, could contact some kind of a story like that. Although I will say this and then of course the media, the media just jump right in or all the way, they went flying through the toolboard, nobody went flying through any toolboard, okay? The one guy paid for the boat of them, right? Right. Three bucks, buck and a half at a buck and a half like I told you here, wasn't a buck, you assholes on CNN. You guys better go with it. See these are not people who travel the alley, they don't know what they're talking about. You've been on the alley? You're talking to me? You're going to be in the alley if those numbers don't come out good today, well I've tended to pressure. Oh, this, I really realized it's only a trend, bro. You got to understand, this only takes you up to like when I came back. Not that it's going to be any big deal when I come back, but nevertheless it probably might be. Court day today for video tape mom, we'll get to the travelers thing in a minute, which ought to be pretty interesting. The Irish travelers, that's with two else. A court hearing is said today for Indiana for Madeline Gorman, too good. The 25 year old mother who is video tape hitting her four-year-old girl and a department store parking lot, I'm sure that nobody has thought it's to see that video tape more than 4,000 times. Too good who faces a child battery charge has had her daughter taken from her in place in foster care, two other children sons are said to be staying with relatives. I baby right now is when people she doesn't know because of what I did. She's been took away, sob too good. She's been took away. She's never did nothing wrong. Who the hell's called me on my cell phone? Is that my cell phone? Are they mine? Oh, who the hell could that be? You're booking? I don't have a booking. My cell phone's ran the other room. Doesn't that make you like curious who'd be called me? It's probably a wrong number. Maybe it's normal. She never did nothing wrong and she's not going to know what we have. What we have, I got to go get my cell phone. How much tune? Okay, I got to just see it. No problem. Okay, it's a grower number. So you know that should I call it? Here you go call. Give it out of here. I'm calling it right now. Okay. It's a book. Is anytime I get a call on here 90% of the time. It's a you have reached mail box number. Yeah, that's nice. It's a wrong freaking number. I'm not even no message. Go away. Okay. Kill that music. Now let's see. Let's get back to this illiterate rambling from this bitch. She never did nothing wrong and she's not going to know what we have and come and got her. This is from CBS News.com. I'm not just a paraphrasing. This is a direct quote. She's not going to know what we haven't come and got her. She's been took away. For sterilization folks of Italian is programmed for years. Too good as said that she lost her temper in a parking lot of cool departments door in Michigan, Indiana, because she was having a bad day and she feels terrible now about a rations. You ever been in Michigan, Indiana? Don't go there. Okay. She told reporters yesterday that it is true. She had her 40 year old daughter Martha no kidding in the head and back and put her hair. But she didn't punch her. Too good said she herself was horrified when she saw the video tape. I was thinking, I look like a monster. Too good said crying. I can't believe I did that to my little four year old girl. Right. On a surveillance video tape of the September 13th in Senate, which has been televised nationally 52 million times, too good appears to be making punchy motion's daughter daughter. It was mostly hidden within the sport utility vehicle. Martha didn't deserve what she got to. It said I just lost my temper. Authorities have said too good. Let the cold departments door in Northern Indiana angry because she was denied a cash refund for two pairs of jeans. She denied that the failed refund of templates connected to the beating. Are you trying to tell me? And we're not accusing her specifically, but in just in general, that one of the scams that the travelers like to pull as they go in may shop low stuff and then they go to the refund and try to get the cash. Right. That's a standard shoplifting kind of thing. Like you steal something from one sears and then go try to return it and another for cash. I see. For attorney Stephen Rosen said he believed the hitting took place because Martha this beam have been bispy haved in the store taking toys out of packages and wandering away, prompting storm plays to page two good twice. Two good was said she's an Irish traveler who currently lives in Michigan, but moved from place to place looking for work. Re-attirated her feelings that her daughter should at least be allowed to live with her husband or another family member. She said she hopes to be reunited with a daughter and that she or daughter and her husband, John, plan to start parenting classes. Anything they want us to do will do, too good said she would charge with felony debatery to a child which carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison. She said her two young son, the son's her thing with family. Now the Irish traveler thing, which I checked it out on the web, no matter what you check out on her web, there's always some pretty interesting crap. Our pull is up by the way we got 27 votes. Irish traveler sometimes known as itinerates or tinkers. Tinkers. The are a very small minority group in Ireland. Tinkers. They make up less than 1% of the population with about 23,000 people in the Republic and another 15 evidence in the north. It's also estimated there are about 15,000 are travelers in Britain and another 7,000 in the USA. Irish travelers belong to a distinct ethnic group within Ireland. They have their own language beliefs and social customs, which have been made stronger over time to their exclusion and marginalization from mainstream settled society. They're pretty marginal. Occasionally, Irish travelers have been confused with the Roma or Gypsy's in England who despite centuries of coexistence, cover and interchange and limited intermarriage remaining distinct people. Until lots of long ago Irish travelers referred to as tinkers. This word referred to their occupation as tinsmiths and metal workers and was derived from the Irish word, Seared Smith or Tinkered Tinsmith. This word is now generally used in a derogatory sense. You got them tinkers? Most of the travelers' traditional craft such as spoon-mending, tinsmithing and flower making of God by the way now is a result of urbanization and interaction of plastic and industrial technology. Travelers' musicians have included the great Ullit-Walenean Piper, Felix Durran. Oh, God, don't you love him? And the world renown folk musicians the Fury Brothers. The music and singing of the Irish travelers have been into Klein since urbanization and the arrival of television, or as Alexander Spentett would say, Heal of Vision. Fewer travelers now rely on singing and making music for their livelihoods in time gone by. Their number of theories is the origin of Irish travelers. Their secret language shelter, and the evidence of various historical references to them would seem to indicate that their remnants of an ancient class of wandering poets. Join by those who were pushed out the land during different times of social, economic, people such as Kramwell's campaign of slaughtered a battle of void in the Battle of Agrum. Many of the travelers may also be the descendants of people who have told us as a result of the Irish potato famine in the 19th century. I think it's kind of like upgrade a little bit, you know, get least into the 20th century. Huh? Get over it already. Yeah, get over all of that, okay. There's plenty of potatoes around. Me and the X. 926-560 WQA, I'm happy Monday to you. And you know the beast, the beast who's not going to be working at morning show anymore. That's the rumor I'm hearing.

You're not thinking anything to do with that bit, do you? Anyway, moving right along. We got 69 votes. Look at that interesting number. 69 should Neil start taking calls on his show again. Because they're fixing our phones today. I want to climb. I don't like that. Yes, but only a few 19. Maybe one day week 17. Yes, please 14. If he does, I'll blow my brains out. 9. It makes no difference to me. 7. 10%. See, it's that 10% loyal people out there. I'll give a crap what we do. I like that. We should have like 100% loan those people. Yeah, absolutely not. Please only three. Only three. Absolutely not. So that's pretty interesting, huh? I've got to blow my brains out. So those are the early returns. And of course Carlos and George both say, We don't want to do that. We don't want to hear four hundred times a day again. Well, we'll see. We'll play by here. We got because we're going to have the phones all fixed. We kind of ashamed to have the thing actually working here tomorrow. We'll see if we can do that. Yeah, that would be tragic. We got some faxes here. Here's what it says. Neon, you're wrong. The dolphins play the second toughest schedule. And if I'll let's hear the same as the Patriots. Well, guess what? They get off to an easy start. Just like they do every year, which is why the three and they play three girls team so far. I look at that Detroit. The pathetic defenseless cult who followed her way past a girls team. Houston expansion team yesterday. And the jets who are girls team with all respect to what we know. Respect to our neighbors. We're going to be a big tune. The jet sucks. I told you that before the game yesterday. The jets are a joke. They got no offense and they got no defense. Other than that, they're pretty good. They suck. Where is the Patriots knocked off Pittsburgh? Who's supposedly was going to be so damn good. They pounded the crap out of them. The jets who were like one and all at the time, who regal off against Buffalo over time, who were supposed to be good. They pounded the crap out of them. And Kansas City has got a dynamite offense. What else are running? Rashnam priest. Jesus priest. Something like that. Ponds. Holmes priest. Sure. Priest. Sherlock Holmes. Anyway, so they sent me the dolphin schedule. Denver, Oakland, Kansas City. Patriots like the jets twice right there, girls team. The girls, the the cults. Sandy, a girl, which is another girls team. And a bear is who are like, say, a lot worse than everybody thought they would be. How come you knew that? How come you knew priest Holmes? That was Chuck. I know, but that's what I'm saying. I thought you weren't into sports. No, I follow football. I just compared to these people. I'm not into sports. In other words, you're more casual. Do you not obsessed with it? Yeah. You're not psychotic about it? That's not my life. Here's Jerry the Ebullient guy. Remember him? No. Yeah. He's the one I was called from New York that day to correct my pronunciation. He was trying to tell me it was bullying. He was bullying. He was bullying. And I finally looked it up on the thing. And I was a course right. See, I know my words, okay, Schmuck, Jerry. But anyway, Jerry sends me a fact. He says, hi, George Hainiel. The entertainment yardstick. I measure quality and radio entertainment by the level of my wife's pleasure. Simply put, if you really, really despises something, A, it's probably great stuff, and B, I'm probably going to love it. And man, she hates you like poison, Neil. She thinks you are a Schmidt incarnate. And know the best part. She's a stockbroker. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And if we say, boy, would tend to know why. By the way, a friend turned me out of the New York Rage show about three years ago while in Crowle Gables. And not that I'm able to get to show off the not-a-listen religiously despite having been a di-harr and Howard sperm fan for years. Let's face it. Howard sperm is known to you, Rogers. And I can say, with certainty, this is not an assucking, but a mere statement of fact. Anyway, pick his son, the lips, no tongue. You're New York, pali, Jerry, the abudian guy. P.S.C. with the macaroon to some pen this year. Maybe a couple of times. How about those maple leaves, huh? No. Come on. Let's see. Richer, oh, I see. Here's the response because he, he facts the program director. A W-A-B-C. Butlin, butlin getting fired. Lynn Samuels is great by the way. And we leverage. He's got a great website, which we got a link to on our website now. She's great. She's like heads and shoulders above most of the other bosos who do this kind of radio. She says, and they respond to this writer. Okay, since you guys, Lynn Samuels program outside there was not profitable for W-A-B-C. Although we paid her salary and every little side of it, he's got to say the show. Things have been tough for all advertising. And they put a couple of syndicated shows on like cheap channel does. We don't pay the salaries. They're syndicated shows. While advertising is still difficult, we have an easier time selling financial ratios to money type clients than we did for Lynn Samuels. I do regret the decision. I was always a Lynn fan as I know you are too. Signed field boys from Golden Pacifica. How do you like that, huh? Well, Lynn Samuels getting screwed over there. It's an issue of the business we'd art hanging there. And whatever you do, don't stop with that website. There's a lot of great crap on there. There's not a single day that goes by. Don't get some good stories off our website. Couple of cues. And this is an actual segue off the story about that two good bitch, the traveler. Couple accused of locking 70-year-old girl in room for months. This is in Tampa. How do you like that? Again, most of the bad crap comes back to Florida. Yeah. A mother and her boyfriend were arrested for allegedly locking the woman 70-year-old daughter in a room for more than four months and giving her so little food she looked like a walking skeleton. Connie Warrington 23 and David La Point 36, face eight counts of abuse including Caging, food deprivation and medical neglect according to a police report. When police filed a girl wearing this months, he weighed 25 pounds. Normally a child that aged with way by 55 pounds. She looked like a walking skeleton, Tampa police spokesman Joe Durkins said. No relation to Tom Durkins. Police on Friday charged Warrington a housekeeper with three kinds of abuse and Le Point who was unemployed with five counts who's unemployed. Yes. A couple originally from Glen's Falls, New York. We're being held with our bail police didn't know if the couple had attorneys. You ever have any Glen's Falls, New York? No, have it. Don't go there. Okay. Thanks. I'm awfully ticker daughter from a New York hospital where she was being treated for the effective abuse and moved to Tampa, Durkins said. Tampa police didn't have details of the abuse she was being treated for. Earlier this month, the girls biological father Daniel Sims discovered the dismal conditions after he came up with a corridor to pick her up. You know, as custody was daughter in Glen's Falls. According to the Tampa police report, Warrington Le Point kept the girl in a locked bedroom with no furniture, no toys. She used the closet as a bathroom. The child said Le Point locked up only occasionally better because she was bad and he hated her according to the report. Le Point bit the girl on the back as a form of punishment reports said. The child also told police Le Point pushed a bead deep into her ear canal. Doctors in New York Hospital surgically removed it earlier this month. State authorities have cuffed the Le Point of Warrington's children. They won you, old boy and three year old girl who are healthy and unhomed. For sterilization, baby, like I said, force-prec and sterilization. That's the only hope for the future of the goddamn human subhuman race. For sterilization.

We're going to be catching a glimpse of the grand canyon on the right. You can be able to see the Hoover Dam in just a few minutes. A couple little facts here on packing a cold king cobra. That's a 357 caliber firearm with the black rubber friff and a six inch barrel. Covalid is carrying a Kimber custom defense pistol with all the bell's and whistles. He'd expect him a custom gun of that kind with an alloy frame and bevel treatment on the entire gun. I let's got a gun. I let's got a gun. It's a loaded one. Down to nothing down. Then I'll thank you for you. For you will then take a crew. Instead of killing a rescue, we'll have been on the plane. You'll tear away a seven-kilimal power. It's never gonna make a mine before without your prey. This is a back-to-back action. Enjoy the rest of the flight. I'm 47 at 5.60 WQAM. You know these scumbags in Chicago that ran out there in a field as father and his son? Yes. The guy with a tattoo's all over his body looked like Charles Manson on a bad day. Come to fight out. But this wasn't something that they did because they were drunk. Because it was the ninth inning they had too many beers. Come to fight out. Looks like it was pre-meditated. A cook-cowty judge ordered a man who went on the field of Kamiski Park in attack to Kansas City. The world's coach held on $200,000 bond. During a hearing, a prosecutor described how William League Jr. telephone his sister before the attack and ordered a watch the white socks game because he was gonna be on. When she couldn't find the game on TV, he ordered a watch the news because he'd be on it. Assistant states attorney Colleen Daily B. San. It was just a short time after that called Daily said that League in his 15-year-old son round the field and ninth inning of that game between the white socks and the world's attack Tom Gambo at a first-face coach. League was charged with a felony account of an aggravated battery in a public place to amusement daily said. League told police actors a rest that he charged in the field because he was angry the white socks were losing. But Daily said the attack was pre-meditated. Shortly before he ran on the field, League handed his key cell phone and jewelry to another one of his sons. She said League was wearing a pocket knife on his waistband when he ran on the field. The 15-year-old son has been charged with two juvenile counts of aggravated battery. One for attacking Gambo and the other one for hitting a white socks security guard and off duty police officers and the teenagers doing court today. Daily said the attack on the 54-year-old Gambo was unprovoked and disputed the contention reportedly made by League in his son that the coach provided provoked him on him. Seeing gesture. So in other words, the neck-along story sure would as come back in his punk kid. This was his 15 seconds of fame. That's interrupt. Yes Tom Wellings on Regis and Kathy right now. Oh, what channels add on? That's on seven down here. I don't know about that. Let's see. There's a WKBW. There's a four-inch right there. Oh, don't tell me I don't have it. Oh, there he is. Oh, no, we're not going to come in. Ah, you have it to that's the end of it too. Was that the end of the interview? See? Oh, no. Oh, no. You've got to be shmitting me for your really phoned on the job. You know, I forgot about it. That was a fact actually that I got. Don't you remember you told me on Friday we both forgot about it. And I have to take the blame for that because, you know, that's heavy duty stuff. Tomorrow a small bell return. Oh, no. It's a little bit of a story. And talk about how your mind is now working too well. You forgot about the fact that that guy who found a little octagonal abusive of the spaceship that he like kind of floated it toward the thing. And it like locked it at least. And a spaceship kind of like took off a little bit. It was like floating. I was in the air. He's in finale. It was like kind of like Carlos, not our Carlos there, but the one up by the front reception does it was floating. The spaceship and the spaceship too. And poor Tom welling he had to go like after that red pickup truck. And he wasn't really sure whether he wanted a catcher, no, not because he wasn't sure whether Lana was in it or Janet Reno. So it's going to be a heavy duty episode, the premiere of this year's of this season's small of a lot of WB tomorrow night. I what time is that on? 8 or 9? 8 I think. I was confused about that. I think you're wrong. I think it's 9. But somebody will tell us, okay, because I sure want to miss that. And I'll have the tape running. I'll have all three TVs turned on over the end place here. And we got a mixed bag on our pull so far today. We got 130 votes. And we have like all over the place should Neil Stein. Let me say it again. Okay. So you missed the beginning of the show, which shame on you. Because it's a big day in Paradise, baby. One o'clock today. The trend comes out, which is two thirds of the summer book. This is George's uh, in addition to which of course this will also see if we instead of those awful best of Neil tapes from my summer, which we were running twice a week. Well, there might be on a few not too many to it. And not by choice believe me. I don't want to be sick. Which I haven't even told about like being sick yesterday. Oh yeah. I thought here we go again. I woke up yesterday morning with like a little chills in the fever. Oh no. But I think what happened is that over the night before the night, whatever, Saturday night, I slept like with a cover's off to the sun. I got like a little bit of a chill. I can't sleep and get a chill man. I just said, well, anything that happens, I get sick. But I thought here we go back to the flu again, back to the Amsterdam flu. But luckily, I took my leg run. My extra strength. I'll see if I can damage my liver and I'm doing pretty good. I just mentioned that in passing. Now how did I get to that summer book? Yeah. So we'll see if those two days a week that I work, which I worked a few days. From how many of you that do for Manchester in one? I did a few. I was sick. Look, do you think that we ought to be sick? Especially in Amsterdam. I think so. That was the first day of the back. They got tumble. There he is. From the hard clock count was like, But like, smooths and his face is he growl like a little growths. And don't spray yours like that. So that is who been on commercial. I get you actually. I'm so free. And what's with that bad do? It looks like he ran into a lawnmower. Wow. And admiring his feet. Everything. Okay. He's the only one who's doing large feet. Some guys have large feet. Some guys have large zucchinis. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're good to you. Yeah. We're good to you. Some guys have both. Yeah. They're big and a boat. Hey, that's the one she's right. Alright. So you got small build. That's it. This is early clock. Can't say there are no types of it. Okay. Well, we can't put Regis on here. We got a show to do. 137 votes. But I'm watching another quarter of my eye. Should Neil start taking calls on the show because the phones will be fish to want to clock. We got the trans come on. We got the engineer coming up here to fix the phones. 146 votes. Yes, but only a few. 44. 30.1%. Yes, please. 37. 25 point. So in other words, about a quarter of the audience is really Jones and for phone calls. Maddie. Come. That's stuff. You know, it makes no difference to me. 23. 15.7%. Boy, I'll tell you that number is zooming up there. You know what? The Royal audience crowd out there. Yes, he's going a little schmutz. I don't like that. Go take a shave Tom. You idiot. Day off.

Clean it up a little bit. Make some difference to me. 23. Maybe one day we 23. If he does, I'll blow my brains out. 12. And absolutely not. Please. 7. So it's like all over the place. This poll, which is good. It's good. It's like nippentucker wheel battle. What we have to look at him right now. And this took from small film now. Here we go. Your dad is missing, right? In this particular scene. Yes. And you, like I mean, he's got his hand on his crotch. Have a combine to hunt the windows. I mean, he's going to whip it out right now, you know. He's still there. Clark. I'm just trying to call the fire to promise him. Get right. Hey, skinhead. It's skinhead. Luther Boy. Watch out for him. Clark. He's going to be trouble. Maybe he's going to be big trouble. Never trust the skinhead. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. He's going to be a big trouble. A week from today? Something big the next week is September 30. What is it? He's a loft opening. That's it. Two weeks ago, the administration heard of the discovery of shipments of thousands of high strength aluminum tubes to Iraq has proved that President Sodom was secretly secretly trying to develop a program to produce nuclear weapons. Such tubes can be used in the production of enriched uranium vital for such a program. The discovery of the tubes which were intercepted on Routo Iraq was leaked to a leading American newspaper. Vice President Cheney went on television talk show to say the tubes were evidence that Sodom was actively and aggressively trying to develop a nuclear program. But a report from the Institute for Science and International Security ISIS says such claims cannot be made. The report at Routo, which has been obtained by the independent yesterday, concludes by themselves these attempted procurements are not evidence that Iraq is in possession of our close to possessing nuclear weapons. They don't provide evidence that Iraq has an operating centrifuge plant or where in such a plan could be operational. Washington said that in the past 14 months of the seas two separate shipments of tubes to Iraq, while it refuses to say where the seizures took place. It's been reported that at least while the shipments originated in China was intercepted in Jordan. There is no evidence that any of the tubes actually reached Iraq. The shipments sparked concern among the US intelligence community because of these such tubes and the centrifuges employed to make enriched uranium for nuclear bombs. Because these centrifuges rotate up to a thousand times a minute, it's essentially used high strength heat resistant metals. But the report produced by ISIS and independent group that studies nuclear and other security issues questions this concludes on several technical grounds suggesting that based in information released by the government, these tubes were of a thickness that would make them difficult to weld. It also says that by the time Iraq's nuclear weapons program was destroyed by coldest enforcers during the Gulf War, it had abandoned aluminum for specialized steel and carbon fiber. David Albright director by assistant assigned his with first hand experience of Iraq's nuclear weapons program as a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency's instruction team. So there was an debate with the US scientific community about the government's claims. But at it, that the Bush administration planned down on such discussion. I don't know why there's not more debate he said. I've heard that a lot of people are expected to remain silent. The Bush administration certainly scared people. I met one government scientist who said his phone was being monitored. How do you like that? What do you say? Huh? Scary. That's all you can say about it. 9.56 and 5.60 WQAM happy Monday.

I just mentioned that in passing. I wonder who's fault that was. Don't know. Who can we blame for that? Oh, here's Molly Evans again. Thank you so much. Well, we'll get to that eventually. Here's a Christopher Cron, who's mayor of Santa Cruz, California. Why I'm fighting federal drug laws from city hall. How did I am here of a small town of California wind up and to tug of war with the D.E.A. He asks this week I didn't from the Santa Cruz city hall as a local group that provides medical marijuana. When about it's weekly task of distributing the drug to the second dying. My story begins on the morning of September 5th when approximately 30 men. Gressed in military fatigues and carrying automatic weapons. The Senate on a small cooperative farm run by the Womens Alliance for Medical marijuana and Northern Santa Cruz County about 65 miles south of San Francisco. They were pulling up organically grown marijuana plants. When the Senate crews county sheriff's office learned what was going on, it was at a loss to explain who the intruder's were or what type of response was in order. I didn't hear about the raid until 10 a.m. when I was called in by members of the collective. I then telephone the Santa Cruz police chief and other local officials that chief had no idea anything either. Later it became clear that the D.E.A. was making a raid. Agents collected more than 130 plants and arrested the founders of the medical marijuana collective. Valerie and Mike Correll. The Correll, B. Woodred Guides and the wide whale corduroy trousers. Eyes on polo shirts and spary top set is surrounded by wild and crazy hippies protesting the war in smoking roaches. You. Are you part of us? Yes. The Bush is one of the, this is the printer so small on the story. The Bush is what bring back the imperial imperious presidency. The preemption proclamation of the tone of Cheney Seezer and Condy Ben Hurr. And the resolution sent to Congress seeking authority to go after a back was the broadest request for executive military authority. Since L.B.J. got the Gulf of Taken resolution member stamped in 1964. At least L.B.J. had a phony up the Taken resolution to get a provocation. Mr. Bush can't be bothered. I cannot believe the girl in arrogance of the White House Senator Robert Birdbellowed, which I have a story on it coming up. Things are getting dangerous or endangered, Carl Rose gunning for the Democrats. Every Alcherone's gunning for air effect. W.A. is gunning for sedam. And Alcatist still gunning for us. Right. Morey and doubt. Well, she used the whole bunch of ones in there. And she know. I can't get the dictionary up either. Woo! So anyway, Newsweek magazine this week. I highly recommend these September 23rd edition. It's on your new stand now. How's Saddam happened? It's a front cover story. I just got a couple of quick pages here. Take a minute. The last time Donald Rumsfeld saw Saddam Hussein he gave him a cordial hand shake. That it was almost 20 years ago to December 20th, 1983. An official Iraqi television crew recorded a historic moment. The once in future defense secretary at the time of private citizen had been sent by President Reagan to Baghdad as a special envoy. Saddam Hussein armed with a pistol on his hips seemed vigorous and confident according to a now declassified state department cable obtained by Newsweek. Rumsfeld conveyed the president's greetings and expressed his pleasure at being in Baghdad wrote the note, take her. Then the two men got out of business talking about the need to improve relations between their two countries. Like most foreign policy in Saddam's Rumsfeld was aware that Saddam was a murderous thug who supported terrorists and was trying to build a nuclear weapon. His raided has already bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Ossirak. But at the time America's big worry was Iran not Iraq. The Reagan administration feared that the Iranian Revolutionary Zoo would overthrow the Shah and take an American hostage's and dip-locked American diplomats hostage for 444 days would overrun the Middle East and its vital oil fields. But Edward seems to keep coming up over and over again, you know what that was. On the theory that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, the Reaganites were seeking to support Iraq in a long and bloody war against Iran. The meeting between Rumsfeld and Saddam was consequential. For the next five years until Iran finally capitulated, the US backs of arms armies with military intelligence, economic aid and covert supplies and munitions. Rumsfeld is not the first American diplomat to wish for the defensive of a former ally. After all before the Cold War, the Soviet Union was America's partner against Hitler and WW2, in the real world as the same, those nations have no permanent friends just permanent interests. Nonetheless, Rumsfeld's long ago interlude with Saddam as a reminder that today's friend can be tomorrow's moral threat. As President George W. is work evident upon the Saddam's successors regime, they would do well to contemplate how and why the last three presidents allowed the butcher abang that to stay in power so long. The history of America's relations with Saddam is one of the Saudi or Tales American foreign policy. Time and again, American turned to blind eye to Saddam's predations, saw him as the lesser evil or flinched at the chance to once see them. No single policymaker administration deserves blame for creating or at least tolerating a monster. Many of the citizens seem reasonable at the time. Even so, there are moments of this clumsy dance with a devil that make one cringe. It's hard to believe that during most of the 80s, America knowingly permitted the arachatomic energy commission to import bacterial cultures that might be used to build biological weapons, but it happened. America's past stumbles while embarrassing are not an argument for in, in, in, in action in the future. Saddam probably is the grave and gathering danger described by President Bush and his speech to the one last week. It may also be true that whoever replaces Saddam is not going to be worse as they have to do. But the story of how America helped create a Frankenstein monster and awishes to strangle is sobering. It illustrates the powerful thinking as well as the iron law of unintended consequences. America didn't put Saddam in power. He emerged after two decades of turmoil in the 60s and 70s, as various drama and tried to gain control of a nation that had been concocted by British imperialists in the 20s that are three distinct and rival factions, these Sunis, the Shiites and the Kurds. But during the Cold War, America competed with the Soviets for Saddam's attention, and welcomed his war with a religious fanatics of Iran. Having cozeed up to Saddam, Washington found it hard to break away even after going to war with him in 1991. Through years of a tacit and overall support and covert support, the West helped create these Saddam of today giving him time to build deadly arsenals and dominate his people. Successive administrations always worried that if Saddam fell, chaos would follow, rippling through the region possibly igniting another Middle East war, at times it seemed that Washington was transfixed by Saddam. Can we put like a pause there? Okay, because there's another page here I want to read. This is the front cover story in Newsweek, how we created Saddam and Gamora. 1026, and we're looking at pull to 29 votes, to Neil Star taking calls on his show again, yes, but only a few 70.

I think it's a Kelly Ripper finally turned him around so to speak. Good. Anyway, getting back to this in Newsweek article. It says the Bush administration wants to finally break this spell. If the administration's true believers are right back, that after Sodom falls, will it something like Paris after the German's fled in August of 44. American troops will be cheered as liberators and democracy will spread forth and push Middle East and despotism back into the shadows. The end of the gloomy predictions of the administration's many critics come through. The era of street in plain by Yankee imperialism will rise up and replace the shaky but friendly autocrats in the region with Islamic fanatics. While the Middle East is unlikely to become a democratic Nirvana, the worst case scenario is always a staple of the press are probably also wrong or resanguated. Assuming that a cornered and doomed Sodom does not kill thousands of Americans in some kind of horrific act, a scary possibility when the deeply worrisate administration officials, the greatest risk of his falls that one strong man may simply be replaced by another. Sodom's successor may not be a paranoid sadist, but there is no assurance that he'll be America's friend or forceware the development of weapons of mass destruction. American officials and know that Sodom was a psychopath ever since he became the country's defector in the early 70s. One of Sodom's early acts after he took title of President in 79 was the videotape of Session of his parties Congress during which he personally ordered several members executed on the spot. The message carefully conveyed to the or press was not that these men were executed for plotting against Sodom, but rather for thinking about plotting against him. From the beginning, US officials worried about Sodom's taste for nasty weaponry. Indeed, at their meeting in 1983, rum spelled war that Sodom's use of chemical weapons might inhibit American assistance and might inhibit it. But top officials in the Reagan administration saw Sodom as a useful surrogate. By going to war with Iran, he could bleed the radical mullas who had seized control of Iran from the pro-American Shah. Some Reagan officials even saw Sodom as another and more sadot capable of making a racket away modern secular state just as sadot had tried to do in Egypt before his assassination 81. But Sodom had to be rescued first. The war against Iran was going badly by 1982. Iran's human wave attacks threatened to overrun Sodom's armies, Washington decided to give a racket helping hand. After rum spells visited to bag dead in 1983, US intelligence began supplying the Iraqi dictator with satellite photos showing Iranian deployments. Official documents suggest that American may have also secretly arranged for tanks and other military hardware to be shipped to a rack in a swap deal, American tanks to Egypt Egyptian tanks to Iraq. Over the protest of some Pentagon skeptics, the Reagan administration began allowing the Iraqis to buy a wide variety of dual use equipment and materials from American suppliers. According to confidential commerce department export controlled documents obtained by newsweek, the shopping list included a computerized database for sedums in theory ministry, presumably to help keep track of political opponents. Helicopters to transport Iraqi officials, television cameras for video surveillance applications, chemical analysis equipment for the Iraq atomic energy commission, and most unsettling numerous shipments of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, to the AIEC. According to former officials, the bacteria cultures could be used to make biological weapons including, including are you ready for it? Ready? I wasn't, though, including. And trust. The State Department also proved the ship in a 1.5 million atterapene injections for use against the effects of chemical weapons, but the Pentagon blocked the sale. The helicopters, some American officials later surmise, were used to spray poison gas on the Kurds. How do you like that? So we sold them the helicopters that they used to spray poison gas on the Kurds and now that we ring our hands above. You also almost certainly know from it on its own satellite imagery that Sodom was using chemical weapons against Iranian troops when Santa Bobcourged recorders rebels and civilians with the lethal cocktail of mustard gas, Seren, Tabad and Vx and 1988, the Reagan administration first blamed Iran before acknowledging under pressure from congressional Democrats that the culprits were Sodom's own forces. There was only token official protest at the time. Sodom's men were unfazed and Iraqi audio tape later captured by the Kurds record Sodom's cousin, known as Ali Chemical, talking to his fellow officers about gasing the Kurds. Who's going to say anything he asked the international community? After them he says, you're not to say, yeah, F.M. is symbolist Jr. The US was much more concerned with protecting Iraqi from attacks by Iran as it was shipped through the Persian Gulf. In 1987, an Iraqi exoset missile head in the American destroyer, the US start in the Persian Gulf, killing 37 crewmen incredibly. The United States have excused Iraq for making an unintentional mistake and instead use the insin to accuse Iran of escalating the war in the Gulf. The American tilt to Iraq became war pronounced. US commanders began blowing up Iranian oil platforms and attending Iranian attacking Iranian patrol boats. In 1988, an American warship in the Gulf accidentally shot down an Iranian airbus, killing 290 civilians. Within a few weeks, Iran exhausted and fearing American intervention gave up its war with Iraq. Sodom was feeling cocky. With a support of the West, he had defeated the Islamic revolutionaries in Iran. America favored him as a regional pillar. European and American corporations were vying for contracts with Iraq. He was visited by congressional delegations led by senators Bob Dull of Kansas, an Allen Simpson of Wyoming, a re-eater from the American farm and business interests. But Sodom's Miguel Omenia was on the rise in the overplayed his hand. In 1990, US customs thing operations near several Iraqi agents were trying to buy electronic equipment used to make triggers for nuclear bombs. Not long after Sodom gained the world's attention by threatening to burn his reel to the ground. That the Pentagon, analyst began to win at Sodom was a growing menace, especially after he tried to buy some American-made high-tech furnaces, youth for making nuclear bomb parts. The other officials in Congress and the Bush administration continued to see him as useful if this tasteful regional strongman. The state department was equivocating with Sodom right up to the moment he invaded Kuwait in August of 1990. I don't like them, Apple. I don't like them. Read it all in Newsweek this week. Oh, there's Alp Presidentate. No, I had a case. Wow. I lunches coming up and I haven't even eaten any yet. 2506 folks at our poll, heavy duty response. Very emotional. Should Neil be taking calls on to show again how they're going to fix our phones finally? Yes, but only a few 84. Yes, please 72, 27 and a half percent. Makes no difference to me, 36. You know, how that stays read about 14%. Yep. Maybe one day a week 36. If he does upload my brains out. 18. And that's only not 14. Compiling now what is this from? This is from where now I get this article. Well, where are the Sunday observer? Another bread paper? Compiling details of how Sodom who's saying is created a massive secret weapons procurement network to rebuild his nuclear and ballistic missile programs will form the heart of Tony Blair's long-awaited dossier in the threat posed by Iraq. The dossier, if we release tomorrow, is expected to show how Sodom is accelerated his efforts to acquire band technologies, particularly nuclear and ballistic missiles, since he went inspectors left or back in 1998. It will claim that Iraqi dictator is more dangerous than he was in 1998 when the last two inspectors were forced to leave Iraq. It is also expected to show how he's massed his activities behind a series of front companies smuggling their works and middlemen in neighboring states all paid for by illegal oil transactions. Although the dossier is not believed to contain a smoking gun, evidence that Sodom's already acquired the material to make a nuclear device, it will reveal as continuing vigorous efforts to do so. It is a sober assessments at one number ten official. See, they put Sodom in town down the street. Do you think Americans know what that means? Number ten, though. How about number six? Who's number one? On its own, it should not be well-fied out of one o'clock. On its own, it should not be seen as justification for military action, but it makes the case about his efforts to obtain weapons and mass destruction. But Senator Bobby Bird, a voice Virginia, across the old Bobby Bird, has president pushes plans to evade Iraq or a conscious effort to distract public attention from growing problems at home. This administration, all of a sudden, wants to go to war with Iraq, but it said the political polls are dropping that it must be situation as problems. So all of a sudden, we have this war talk war for ver, the vehicles of war, drums of war, clouds of war, and a market stay another precipitous war crack this up, by the way. Yeah. Don't tell me that things suddenly went wrong. Back in August, the president had no plans. Then all of a sudden this country is going to war, Bird told us set it on Friday. Our politician is talking about the domestic situation, the stock market, weaknesses in the economy, jobs that are being lost, housing problems? No, he says. No. Bird wore to another Gulf of Talking Resolution, passed on August 7, 1964. That resolution handed President Johnson broad powers to escalate the war in Vietnam, a conflict that cost 58,000, toward it in two American lives, and millions of Asian lives. Congress will be putting itself on the sidelines, Bird told us, nothing would please this President more than having such a blank check handed to him. Bird said his belief in the constitutional preventive from voting for Bush's war resolution, but I'm finding that the Constitution is irrelevant to people of this administration. He said, Senators Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, Swerve Clinton, the New York Pope, praised Bird after he spoke. It is the height of patriotism as such, our questions Clinton said, no one exemplifies that more than the senior senator from West Virginia. Bird said before the nation's committed to war, before we send our sons and daughters to battle in far away lands, that her critical questions that need to be asked to date the answers from the administration have been less than satisfying to keep you saying it. Senator Bobby Bird said, no, I don't think so. I'm not. I'm low. This is the fourth radio by 62. I'm the only two. I'm. I think motherfucker provoked one of my socks at night, so they smell like a sister's clots in the morning. Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music bag, if you profile story, we take a good. Hard. stiff looking to start. Good. That's it. Here in America, they had nothing more than a minor impact with his son's cool summer endings. But in Britain, they had 23 top 40 singles and were named the most successful all-girl group in history, which leads to a very important question. What the hell is up with Britain? Look, look, I'd really rather not talk about it. After a summer border broke a two decade silence about the dirty facts England is hoping to keep buried. British ambassador to the UN, Nigel Klenchworthy, made this statement. These are the Paranama, Rama. Where is Shane? Where in Paris, get your notes to sleep as in peace? Inside the behind took to the streets of England to find out how the smarty pants are always so much better in your country, could be so filled with cleanest losers who have no taste in music. Excuse me, excuse me. Can you talk to us about how you keep a thought so highly of banana ramma? Yeah, I'm so excited, it's nice. No, Johnny. I'm what you're saying. Excuse me. Tell everyone we're not going this way. I'm quite fond of the bangles, really. But when our camera could win to a London pub, things got ugly. Excuse me, gentlemen. Care to apologize for banana ramma? Sure, mate. Soon as you apologize for Christopher Cross. Oh, you mean, say, thanks for your life. Okay, then, now bang on, guys. Hang on, no, no, no. Don't, stop. Well, you have to admit, Christopher Cross has left us with a lot to answer for. Oh, God. It's a big juicy, sobbing let look at show business tonight on Inside the behind. Uh, exactly. You know, that one guy on there toward the anti-counter-sat, like, you know, the long time in a month? Yes. Kind of like him. That was the best one ever, by the way. That was one of the long time best. Hey, sound that you, hey. Yeah, kind of sound like I might actually have to play that, you know, haven't played that in a very, very long time. 1047 at 5.60W to come in a 1. The FEC, the Federal Election Commission to disclose Friday, it's imposed a record setting $719,000 in fines against participants. In the 1996 Democratic Party fundraising scandals involved in contributions from China, Korea and other foreign sources. The FEC documents described Democratic fundraisers who set specific prices for foreign nationals to make illegal campaign contributions and return for meetings with then President Clinton and Vice President Gore. A Democratic finance vice chair, for example, set organizers would have to contribute $100,000 and return for Gores appearance at a Buddhist Temple in L.A. Those penalized include the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Gore campaign, the Buddhist Temple in early 2000 people in corporations acting as condoats for illegal contributions, all of agreed to pay according to the documents. Acting as condoms. How's he doing, by the way? Let's see him no more. Did we ever hear any more about that? Nope. Isn't that amazing how stories you know they, they, They're shelf life just, yeah, I've got to do with the war with Iraq. And that's sure I forgot about that or that bitch that Irish travel and bitch that do good or the total in fines would have been significantly higher except that some of the corporations have folded and others were dummy corporations would know assets to set up as condoats for money from China, Venezuela, Canada and other countries. Canada, foreign individuals and organizations are barred from contributing to federal elections. In some cases, foreigners would have been subject to fines, couldn't be located in the river of papers. In other cases, the individuals, pretty early in criminal cases in our bankrupt. The DNC was fine, 115 grand. The Clinton Gore campaign, $2,000 in a Buddhist progress society, 120 grand. In the conciliation signed by DNC Lawyer Joseph Sandler, the party agreed to pay the fine and to discourage another $120,000 to the US Treasury representative, representing illegal contributions that were not returned to donor. Just gore, just not a great word. Yeah, you're going to turn it loose. Like that, I'm discouraging it right now. I discourage that kind of talk on issue at any time. So the beast is off the morning show, huh? You know, when he gets back from vacation list, we're going to mark it on your calendar. Along with next Monday's opening of the brand new pizza locked in plantation. We ought to invite the beast as a special guest on our show, you know it. Just for a couple of minutes, maybe for two, three hours. To tell us the real story of how it evolved into his like moving out of it, he sure was not that show very long was he? Huh? Huh? He sure was not that show very long was he? Not long at all. On the Mohawar David show, I wonder what the reason is for that. Yeah, that could have been part of it. Anyway, all that this should tell you about our good friends, the brits that I'm always telling you about you silly, have you seen this about the Fox hunting that thing? No, not lately. I mean, I know about it over the year. Oh, many people in the nation. Around wait to hear this about 400,000 campaigners have taken part. And a countryside rights march in London in one of Britain's biggest rallies ever. Farmers, hunters, landowners, and rural residents and workers flock from every corner of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to bring London to a standstill and demand to assist their Tony Blair as labor government must do more to protect their traditional way of life. Police confirmed figures via the countryside alliance showing 400,000 past the finishing point of yesterday's March by late afternoon, seven hours after the start with many more waiting behind. We're talking maybe a half a million. The alliance said the liberty and livelihood march was part of the fight to protect the lifestyle put at risk by the government and initiatives introduced by people who don't live in or stand the countryside. Their protesting against moves to ban Fox hunting and demand state help and countryside problems such as unemployment and poverty. Organizers, excellently, compared the demonstration with two British histories, most famous mass protest, the toll-puddle martyrs march in support of six farm labor, sent to us right in 1834. And the 1381 peasants revolt uprising. Today we are making history. They must listen, said the march has made organizer, James Stanford. March directed James Stanford told the press association the march was without doubt the largest civil rights demonstration held in London in the last 150 years. A the emotive issue of Fox hunting, a favorite sport of British rural aristocracy for centuries, but condemned as barbaric by campaigners for animal rights was the main focus of the march. You know the kind of people are for animal rights? Yeah. Oh, what was that? Where is it? See, you can do it too. Why is that doing that? I don't know. You know the kind of people who are for animal rights? Peter. It was a duck on pet names for this. I'm so glad that happened to you too. I'm not giving what it happens to. What's the wildest thing? Acts up, you know. But protest is also marching to bring attention to many other issues ranging from elective affordable housing and decent transport services to unemployment and the suffering of farmers in the last years devastating foot mouth outbreak which prompted the slaughter of millions of sheep and cattle and prompted a lot of people to be eating spotted dick three times a day. And towed in the hole. There's nothing worse than a towed in your vacuum. Just ask, where should you gear? He'll tell you. 295 votes already on at poll. A heavy duty response man. They're really whipped up to a frenzy about whether we take calls on the show again. The only, the only point being that they're whipped up in different directions. You know what? I say. I mean, we got 29% who obviously are gung-ho for oh yes, please let's get some calls on again. But that leaves 71% who are like smatter in different directions who are less than gung-ho. Yeah, it takes some calls but only a few. That's in first place, 91. Ever got the 14% it makes no difference to me that loyal crowd out there. We love you. Whatever we do. Okay. You know something if you're like a sore throat or a bad cool. You can still sit here and go. I'm just, that's just on. You could loop that. And you can also, there are other things you can loop like. That would be a complete effort for hours and people crapping in their pants all over time all over the station. Rumor has it by the way that that bit is number one with 16 bullets. Thank you, one where I'm here and, and that the beast got muscle out. Let's see, maybe one day we 40. So these other, I mean, yes only a few and maybe one day a week. That's not exactly like an overwhelming enthusiastic support for calls. You see what I'm saying? I said, if he does, I'll blow my brains out 19, 6% and of course the last one there. What, where is it? Absolutely not please 18. So you got like 12 and a half percent who are adamant. They don't want any calls under any circumstances. You got our four almost 14% of say no matter what you do, the move like that. We listen. We don't care. We're easy. And then you got that nearly 30% of say we want the guy to end cause course. We know who those 30% are. You follow what I'm saying. Hi, yeah. We don't know exactly who they are. Here's this article, a column by Bob Herbert and today's New York Times. This is, uh, wait, didn't hear this. Hi, altitude Rambo's. Dr. Bob Rage Kumar, a US citizen and former military physician from Lakeworth, Florida. Found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month and one of the many episodes of his story to be wrapped on board airliners in the US since the 9.11 attacks. Dr. Raj Kumar was seated in first lives on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on August 31. When a pastor in the coach section began behaving erratically, the passenger Steven Fierre, had nothing to do with Dr. Raj Kumar. Two US federal air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr. Fierre, who is described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying when Mr. Fierre refused to remain in a seat. The marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead rules and Hollywood's latest action extravaganza. They handcuffed Mr. Fierre, hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr. Raj Kumar. They 180 or so past years were not quite jittery. Dr. Raj Kumar asked to have his seat change and a flight attendant obliged finding him another seat in first class. The incident already scary could ensued of ended there, but the marshals were already left things quiet down. One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats and remains still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try to visit the restroom. The message couldn't have been clear. Anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger being shot. The passengers were petrified with most believing that there were terrorists on a plane. I was afraid it was going to be a gun battle and that pressurized cabin said senior judge James A. Lindberg or Philadelphia courter common police. The veteran of 20 years in a military who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. I was afraid it was going to die from the gunfire and a shootout. Dr. Ratchkumar's wife Dorothy was seated quite a distance from her husband said it was really like Rambo in the year. She worried that there might be people on a plane that didn't speak English and therefore didn't understand the marshals orders. If somebody got up to go to the bathroom here, she might be shot. There were no terrorist on board. There was no threat of any kind. When the plane landed about a half hour later, Mr. Fear was taken to custody and then shockingly, so was Dr. Ratchkumar. The armarsals grabbed the doctor from behind. Handcuffed him and for no good reason anyone's been able to give. All of them to an airport police station were withdrawing into a filthy cell. This was airline security gun berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr. Ratchkumar is straight away. We're tearing Army major done anything wrong. Dr. Ratchkumar was of Indian descent. He believed he was taken in custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Fear was also released. Officials tried to conceal names of the marshals but they eventually were identified by a Philadelphia and choir reporter. As Sean Beam, a colors and Samuel Muma of the Transportation Security Administration, which is part of the West Transportation Department. The TSA has declined to discuss the incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr. Ratchkumar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident too closely. Huh? If that becomes a quite curing for West in the US, a lot of us reporters are headed for jail rights Bob Herbert. Dr. Ratchkumar told me yesterday he ran straight in by the episode. I'd never been treated like that in my life. He said I was afraid I was about to beat up or killed. Lores for the US, you have taken up his case. He's filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention. We have to take a look at what we're doing. The name of security said Dr. Ratchkumar. So many men and women of fought and die for freedom in this great country. Now we're in danger of ruining that in the name of security. Unbelievably scary, scary story. I'll tell you very scary guy. Not just Luca Brassi. That's Tom Layman. You ever see Tom? No. He's a very scary guy. He's a good guy. He's okay. Anyway, Tom Layman and Hal had potty at GMC.

Yeah, it's just a not much of a handle He was a father of franchising who left behind an inspiring success story the world's largest coffee in baked goods chain and a sugary mark on the mornings of millions worldwide Here's an example I can follow and teach my kids of how he can be a success in life So it's Sultan Sedikki owner of a Dunkin don't us franchise on West Palm In his office at the Dunkin donuts at one thirty thirty five o'clock see how is it? He has a picture himself in his wife Zia with Mr Rosenberg along with a markup copy that owns Magnus biography time to make the donuts.

TFC customer must have thought he had a perfect day too. He got pot with his chicken. Mil Valley, California. A Mil Valley KFC restaurant employee was arrested after a customer received a little something extra with his chicken dinner. The customer received two bags of marijuana Friday, and said the extra biscuits he had requested. The customer gave the marijuana back to the employee, got his extra biscuits and called police. What an asshole. God! Shmuck. Called police. Police arrested Carlos I.L. 26 of a lay, who surely after customer complained about the pie. Mirri and Kathy Sheriff's deputy said they found a yellow with a small amount of marijuana handgun about five of our bucks in this possession. A yellow often worked to drive up one of the restaurants that they're saying may have been selling the marijuana customers who use the right secret word as a code. As in like Mary Jane something subtle like that. How do you like that? And they called a police. Man, what a piece of turd. You got to go on and kiss the guy in the lips. I'm telling you that less than the code word. You forgot my biscuits. The US is vulnerable to terrorism aimed at farms that produce the nation's food sign to say. Such an attack could easily happen. The National Research Council said in report released last Thursday. It's not a matter of if it's a matter of when. Said R. James Cook, a council member from Washington State University. While there may be a very low probability now. What about in 20 years he'd be asking. You know all of these terrible things. They're all saying the same thing about it. It's not a question of if it's a question of when. Like from the pop green school of life. I mean if it's like that, why don't we just all blow our brains up. You know. The council reports that an attack on food production probably wouldn't lead the famine or malnutrition. But it could hurt public confidence in the food supply and disrupt the economy, costing millions if not billions of dollars. The panel in arm of the National Academy of Sciences pinpointed weakness is in the US plan of defense against bioterrorism and its report. One of the most comprehensive views of farm security today. Since last year, scientists have considered ways to risk a spirit disease across US borders and in fact cattle with mad cow disease, contaminate grain fields or spread, ah, I'm never ready for this. Why I need to be an out or spread and trash. Many pathogens are easily dispersages foot and mouth disease and illness that doesn't arm humans but can quickly sick and hurts of pigs and cattle. An outbreak of foot and mouth occurred in Britain more than a year ago, raising concerns of disease could appear in the US of a. The 911 hijackings that answer by Militax heightened security scientists worries the panel urge US officials to improve their communication with intelligence agencies, universities and farm groups to help them public cope with food and farm security threats. It also suggests that the government's strength and its border inspections by adding new equipment to design, harmful bacteria and diseases. An addition to the council's recommended government immediately increased its efforts to understand plant and animal disease and how they're spread. Establishing network of laboratories that were respond to detect and diagnosis diseases and form a nationwide system to manage and collect bioterrorism information. I don't, if they don't get you any air ducts are going to get you into your dinner plate. Cities color blind to tear warnings many ignorinations five color alert system. Are we still on that orange? I guess are we on that high alert? I think that's a bad question to be asking you. Many of the nation cities have taken little or no action response to the federal government's elevated terrorism alert, a survey of the national league of cities be shown. This is in USA today, so it could be true, especially if there's some colorful pictures with a story. The survey of 300 nine cities may be involved small the medium size cities, about 25% of customized preparedness plants are conformed to national five color alert system. One and five don't understand what the system means. I wonder what they're thinking about this in Geneva in the York. I'll read on it. Most of these didn't step up security runs in timber. I don't even know the Bush administration put the nation on threat condition orange or a high alert for a terrorist attack. Orange. It was the first time the level was raised in the government set up the color coded system in March. The alert system is designed to communicate threats to the nation. The government recommends certain security steps, but state and local governments are required to act. The threat levels are red for civil ID and North Carolina. Under threat condition orange the federal government suggests that the local government industry leaders take extra precautions at public events coordinate security with armed forces or place and allow some people to stay home or work from other locations. Joe to step in O'Mare of New Haven says the city put extra security guards on duty for a couple days around September 11. Just for Carson they're no longer in place. We depreciate some more information he says. There's a real disconnect between what's happening in cities and towns and the rhetoric in Washington. Barb Grant emergency prepared his manager for Bellevue Washington says the alert would have gotten her attention. For example, official said terrorist were planning to attack shopping malls in a West Coast a more general urge. He says doesn't more in many specific local actions. The survey also found fewer than a third of cities increased security utilities public building schools are reports. 27% they connected businesses usual and fewer than a fifth issued local warnings are coordinated with the police and emergency responders. The code is like a boy who cried wolf said John Wichel. Time manager of something we Connecticut we did nothing as there was nothing to be done. How do you like that huh? I don't know so the the dog and pony show continues. Kentucky governor patent admits to inappropriate relationship with woman suing him for harassment.

All right. 1218 at 5.60, WDQAM, police city officials defense squad's photographic of detainees, even those not arrested. Our good friends in Delaware again, is that the pre-filing we were talking about? Yeah. Wilmington Delaware, the city police department's corner deployment unit, is known as the jumpout squad for bursting out of vehicles to question and search suspects. Its offices also are known for something else, snapping photos of suspects they stop, even those they don't arrest. City officials defend the practice as a legal and effective part of fighting drug dealing in street crime, critics say it violates the constitutional rights of innocent people, and an error worth surveillance cameras peer from buildings and parking lots, courts have ruled that people can't expect privacy in public places, civil libertarians argue that police photographing people they don't arrest is a different matter. There's no authority to forceably photograph someone in an enderum into a database where they have committed no crimes that are very stine hard to associate director of the ACU. I'm not aware of any other municipal police department that's engaged in this type of behavior he be saying. Wilmington Mayor James Baker describes such criticism as blithering idiocy, saying police take pains to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens while targeting people who are killing our neighbors who are killing our people. City officials deny police are photographing individuals who believe are likely to commit crimes. Some may be reports of compared the technique to minority report are recent science fiction movie in which police identify cronyles before they commit crimes. It's not a Gestapo technique, it's not anything other than a progressive means of policing and urban environments and police spokesman corpels Stephen Martellie. I think he's willing to Mr. Martini. I'll see. Among other things, the photos conservators proved that a first-ever resident for law-abiding received other warnings they were also kept as possible evidence for ongoing investigations authority said. Police chief Michael Zazurba said his department is taking photographs of suspects for years without complaints. It's highly improbable that innocent people were caught up in the stops he said. According to City officials, 658 people were stopped in question between June when the Stumpout Squad's operation Bulldog Eagle began and last week among them 546 were arrested and 700 charges were filed. Police believe the other 112 are involved in criminal activity, even if officers didn't find enough evidence that day they were arrested. So in other words, it's not a question whether you're anything wrong now or before now, but we think you will. We know. We know what you got in mind. We know what's up here, sleep. Remember Friday we had the Johnnie Carson says he's not the Diann, right? And that there was a story in the inquired that when I was coming out Friday. Well, here it is in my hand right now, man. We don't miss him. I want those tabloids. I got him. Johnny Carson battling deadly lung disease. It says here. In the inquired, TV legend Johnny Carson is battling a deadly lung disease.

The healing star is lung condition. Hampered is recovered from quadruple bypassed three years ago. And since the incurable disease has gotten worse living amount of breath and fatigue, Johnny's more than aware of them to see we could eventually kill him. So the source posted the Carson family, but he's battling to the disease the best he can't. Remember I told you by the end of the year. He's hoping that the clean sea air will keep him as healthy as possible. Take deep breaths, Johnny. Come on. Breathe in. Breathe out. Like on passions. Breathe in. Breathe out. Although Johnny's heart condition is improved and infosemise force them to change his lifestyle completely, he said with that to a more sedentary lifestyle. The source said he just can't exercise like he used to. He's not on an oxygen tank. See, I'm just out of the blue. Just because of the story, I'm gagging and choking on it. He's not on an oxygen tank, but he's facing an ongoing battle with emphysema. Emphysema is a serious disease that can't be reversed. According to experts, the chronic condition gets worth worse with time and patients gradually become more and more disabled. About half of all patients survived ten years of longer after diagnosis, but patients would severe emphysema often die within four years. Emphysema is a devastating disease, but if patients are able to remain actively live longer, Dr. Edward Haponic, a lung specialist at Johns Hopkins Medical School of Medicine told the inquirer, what shortness of breath limiting his activities, Ailing Johnny is taking to spending his day sailing his 130-year foot custom built motor yacht, the serengeti. This summary crewed with his devoted wife Alex and a crew of nine up and down the Atlantic coast, stopping in ports of call but rarely staying long. As far as Johnny's concern, sailing is the best thing you can do for his infosemma, the source be saying. The healthy seer gives Johnny a renewed energy and vitality and he's looking much better than the pastie gray he was earlier this year, although he still weighed Johnny appears tanned and fit. But throughout his travels, the star is shy away from the public. Johnny is almost as reclusive as Howard Hughes, the source said. He was going to stay at Sag Harbor on the tip of Long Island through Labor Day, but he got spooked after a newspaper printed a report of the serengeti being birthed in a slip there. He immediately had the most kept in way anchored head back out to sea. Outside of the fact that he loves being out on the sea for clean air. He also loves that he doesn't have to see another soul out there. Johnny doesn't want to see anybody. When the boat Docs usually stays below deck watching his satellite TV occasionally he may slip assure for a quite lunch and low with Alex's he didn't want to have to know and Boston at Vista Rock into Scano, but mostly he's content to be by himself with Alex and the crew. Jerry Sotsick had a Carson Productions and Johnny's nephew told him where he didn't take the star ahead of Passema, but a family friend insisted Johnny smoking led to his disease. There was a time after Johnny had his heart attack that his doctor's study began oxygen and definitely which Johnny desperately did to want not want to be tied down to an oxygen tank for the rest of his life. He stopped smoking, got checkups regularly, but over time his conditions deteriorated. He did too much damage to his lungs as a young man. He's biggest regret in life is that he's being a big smoker. Quit smoking all you punk side there. Quit smoking it. Quick gagging on it, okay? Because you're going to be dead. I think that's a good question. What is this Hank is doing the money that football on sports center in Tampa tonight? That's what I was told. That's why he's done.

Anyway, 504 votes on the polish of Pona. Dr. Phil's father raped me. How do you like that? Do do do do do. I was raped by Dr. Phil's father. That's the painful secret. Martha Watley West is finally revealing an exclusive in cry interview after two decades of silence. And it's the painful family secret that Dr. Phil McGraw Oprah's hand pick relationship guru hides behind his TV ready smile. Dr. Phil's dad, Jomegraw, roamed my life and destroyed my marriage Martha declared I was ready to kill myself. Four weeks ago, the inquiry revealed that a former female patient of Dr. Phil claimed he sexually abused her in 1985 and a state agency and Texas found that the psychologist was Gileumus conduct. The saying like Father like Son applies to Dr. Phil and his father, no questions at Martha 52, I thought I'd put it behind me until I saw Dr. Phil on TV all these years later. I felt like I had been raped one more time. Martha's nightmare began in 1981 when she went to psychologist Joe who died in 1993 for help in battling depression after several deaths in her family. I went to his office in Wichita Falls, Texas. She told the inquire, he and Dr. Phil and offices in an older home. I was 31 and married. My husband was a backer. We had two small children. Dr. Joe was about 60 balding a little balding a little with a mustache. Dr. Mac Furrey first visit. He said, have you ever had enough fear? I was shocked. I said, no, he said, I can't believe that. You're so beautiful. I would love to make love to you. I was so naive. I just thought, oh my goodness, this man thinks I'm attractive. I was in awe of him. After that, he was flirtatious in every counseling session. Seven months into my therapy. We were sitting in our chairs when he stood up and walked over to me. He pulled my shoulders to have me stand up and then he kissed me. And then he kissed me. Everally brothers, never? Yes. He pulled on his pants and underwear and pushed my shoulders down and had me perform oral sex on him. I had never done that before my life. When he exposed himself, he said proudly, so what do you think of that? I didn't say anything or overwhelmed. I was mesmerized by him. After where he said, if I told anyone he could get in a lot of trouble, he said he had to be careful in case his wife Jerry found out. I never saw him again for therapy. He did ask me to meet him one more time a week or two later. It was at the house of a bachelor friend of Joe. One of the master bedroom and got on dress he tried to do the sex act, but wasn't able to properly perform when he I left. He said, I can't do this anymore. He said, that's probably a good idea because obviously he can't either. After that, he and Dr. Phil dropped me like a hot potato. I went into a terrible depression. I'd never had sex without sight. Anyone outside my mirror, she ended up feeding at Roon my life and Dr. Joe had Roon my life. It goes on. But anyway, here comes the important part that I just discovered. Okay. And I've been at least they had this earlier, but here's the update. Because there on top of the vanity and choir, there were the first and Robert Blake in the first on O. J. and the first on everything. Right. And John Boney. And John Boney. Dr. Phil is lying says woman in sex scandal. Dr. Phil is desperate. I stick to my story. That's the angry declaration of a former patient of Dr. Phil McGraw, a woman who insists the TV side called this sexually abused her after he denied her revelations, which were first reported in the inquiry. In a blockbuster interview in our August 20th issue, the former patient said that when she was 20, Oprah went for his self-help guru, touched my breast and put his hands between my legs. I felt like a pedophile victim, the man's a predator. We revealed Dr. Phil was investigated by the Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists and in 1989 he was found guilty of misconduct. Now Dr. Phil who's own talk show is just a view claims the sexual abuse never took place further devastating his former patient. The woman now 38 was Dr. Phil's patient in which tough falls Texas and became his employee to be forced to father complaint with the board. She asked that her name not be used although the inquiry confirmed her complaint through official records. Before the inquiry story was published, we made numerous attempts to get a comment from a grong received no answer, but a month later we told a magazine. I've never so much as pedded this woman on the back. It was absolutely totally false and it was fully investigated and dismissed. But the woman's complaint was not dismissed. The inquiry learned the board punished Dr. Phil with a public reprimand and demanded that his practice be supervised by another psychologist. The woman told the inquiry after hearing Dr. Phil's remarks, this makes me feel ill. I feel like I'm being abused all over again. All I can say is that all of my allegations were true and that's why he chose to enter into the settlement agreement with the board which ordered him to be supervised in monitor. I'm sticking to my guns, the story the inquiry ran was accurate. By making these statements now he's lying, she says, I guess he had to say it to make him look good for his new show, but these facts have been established for a long time. Dr. Phil also told a magazine to talk a lie detector test to prove his innocence. I told him to ask me about her and about any other woman patient in my past. With 2020 hindsight it would have been better if I'd never seen her again, but had nothing to do with sexual allegations whatsoever. When a magazine asked Dr. Phil who administered the test he couldn't remember. And the chairman of the board that said in judgment of Dr. Phil Dr. Lawrence Abrams or shock by McGraw's claim he told the inquiry, we don't require a lie detector test, we never lie detector tested anyone. I don't recall the specific case of Dr. McGraw, but I don't recall any psychologist ever taking a lie detector test. The former patient added to now say the abuse didn't occur as a desperate act by a desperate man. How do you like them apples huh? A little doctor Phil all we can say is wow. By the way, I got my shirt and pants on. That's good to know. Well, no, there's a reason for that though. Okay, you're expecting company. I'm a company. I'm expecting engineers going to be here when a clock and I want to be sitting here like, you know, starting to make you look like you usually are. Oh, no, not in my boxes and I'm walking shorts. I don't sit around here my under were okay. Close to it and believe me, it's not a pretty sight. I'm sure you believe me. But anyway, the engineers come we're going to get the phones taken. We got our pull going about should we take calls on a show. We got over 500 votes. The audiences emotional and aroused about their man. We're almost smelling. I'm ready. We facts me this. I will get this in today because I don't have time to do that. We give the Brittany thing justice. We'll do that tomorrow. Okay. Brittany cleans up a rack. You're going to be disappointed about that and Kathy Lee takes Frank back to the scene of the slime crime and Robert Blake tried to strangle wife during a kinky romp and he couldn't strangle her. So finally, Martha, they'll never lay a finger on me. She's Martha. She's doing some good tabloids stuff and the usual stuff. And who knows, maybe we'll take some calls tomorrow. Never know. One or two, maybe? Or we'll see. Tell Carlos by the way to get a little bit of counseling just in case he's been through it. Yeah, he was, oh, that's right. He did it when you were on the internet. That was his internship. So he already knows that. Oh yeah. And chick-up. Not a con. And with those guys all call lots right, they don't love those. They don't do it off here. They were. Yeah, there were enough. The Raspberry guy. I mean, called 10 times a day. Yeah, a 10. That has pretty good. Maybe he's had some therapy.
