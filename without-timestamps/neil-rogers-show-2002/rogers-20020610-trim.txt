I was a little saddy, did I? You sucky? My short fat idiot. Daddy, your loser. She was sad here from heaven, and she's dead as little girl. I went back home in my pants. I got for all of the time. I think mommy cheated on you. I just had to read time prayer. Still a little white flower all of the birds. My eyes are now man-o-be's here. Oh, I told that I'm done wrong. I must have done something wrong. Daddy, why don't you get a job? To deserve a whole new year, and what if like it's a lie? Daddy, you smell like beer. Sweet 16 today. I'm dropping out of high school. She's looking like a mom, a little more everyday. Daddy, I'm pregnant. One part, one, the other part, girl. I don't know who the father of a film and maker from ripping them up. I have to turn chicks back in time. I'm waiting outside in a graveyard. I drove the climb to a tree. Can you just send me some cigarettes? What if my kisses are not? Hang out by the toast for the brightening road. You change your name today. Dad, I'm getting married again. You make a promise and I'll give her away. Dad, that's my ass. Standing in the bride room, just staring at her. I think I have to. I have to be what I'm thinking. And I said, I'm not sure. I got to let her go. But I'm always in the mirror. Hey, pop, we're moving in. I'll give her more. And butterfly kisses. Dad, I have some news. I'm a lesbian. All right. Hey, but guess what? Let's be in the zoo. So it's not all bad. 9.03.5.60. WDQM happy Monday, too. Yeah, you know why I played that? Father's day coming up? No. Because this week we're going to be doing the one hit one thing, which somebody suggested. Somebody facts that in several days ago. And I think that's a great idea for a poll. I'm not going to do that poll today, but we'll eventually get to it. Now you know who did the original of butterfly kisses? No, I don't. How do you like that? I'll give you a clue. May 10th, 97 is when it first hit the charts. 97? Yeah. And you never got to know because it was a one hit wonder. Bob Carlisle. Never heard of him. Exactly. That's my point. See how great these one hit one is. Although if you go on the internet, you'll find anything on the internet. It's amazing. And I just typed in a search for one hit wonders and show enough is all kinds of crap. But real good one. Classic rock list. I'm going to have to go out and buy the book. The billboard book. They got a whole separate book of one hit wonders. But this list is mighty impressive to me. Question mark in the students, 96 years from Saginaw Michigan. Question mark. Did you know about him? Her. I know they did that song. I know that song. Right. She was a threemer. Question mark. And boy, do you agree with the set of the mind? I got a lot of these. No. I already told you were head up. See, the thing of it is these are one hit wonders. But boy, the songs, man, the some pretty heavy duty stuff. Right. Blue chair, summertime blues. I could live without that. Blue is image right kept and right. That's one of my favorite favorite songs. Well, we'll get into that eventually. Shocking blue and paint a Venus. Stealers, real stuck in the middle with Jews. Stuck in the mall with. We have them. We have them. We serve correct. Do we have a temple? Yeah. Yeah. We don't have time for a right now. Here's our pull from over the weekend. What do you smoke? I wonder what somebody smoke it in traffic. They're a QAM. We don't have any program log today. I wonder what they're smoking over at balance for life. The beast who lost two more pounds. Let's hear it for the beast. Oh, even though he is a little stupid. 32 pounds he's lost on balance for life. And just to show how much they appreciate the great job he's done. They don't throw a shot for that he fool this morning. For his memories. For either Joralee. I mean, you don't count. I know. Who the hell is that? What the hell is that? I don't care. Although I will say this, George had a bonding experience with Mo and a hallway by the T-Rom this morning. And I've been at least didn't have too much impact because he's still in mention our name. My name, your name, it didn't make sense. Well, maybe he doesn't mention anybody's name when he gets to one of these moods, which is like just about every day. He doesn't promote anybody else on a station except sucking up the Hank. And it's not going to work by the way, Mo. I keep trying to tell you that. Talking about how even though Hank's a genius, he couldn't pick Syrava to win the, Melmon on Saturday the 70 to one shot, who did? Nobody. That's why he was 70 to one. Wow, I mean, how can you see it's the same old crap. I'm just sick and tired of it already. They're by racing sucks. Warimblin goes to his knees at the start. Almost fell down. It's a miracle that I just but no said it in fall off. Had no chance. And then, of course, people don't understand the game. We'll say, yeah, but he moved up there on the inside. Actually, had the lead a little bit. Well, of course, he had to use all his horses to get back in contention and didn't have a chance to one his race, which that's not the way he runs. Anyway, and then by the time he got the lead, a little bit on the inside by about a neck, he picked his guts out. He was done. He was finito. So it just wasn't meant to be. It just occurs. There's a hex over Belmon. Then, of course, Tyson got the crap kicked out of him. So we're not going to talk about all that sports stuff. That's been exhausted. We're very pleased that he got the stuffings kicked out of Meldesur, delighted. And then, what else was there? We're going to wake him up. And, oh yeah, in the Japan-D Russia one, nothing, and it were like burning down Moscow as a result of pissed off. They were riding in the streets. They set on fire, Japanese restaurant there in Moscow. Quite by the Kremlin. I guess it'll teach them to try to export that sushi crap. Anyway, we had 1262 votes on a poll. What do you smoke? What do you smoke and right now? What's the water Nazi smoke and that our logs are disappeared? We don't even have a log for this show today. Maybe we got one here and took the logs and the balance for life's acts. Yeah, that could be. Somebody stole our balance for life's acts and the logs too. Anybody buying that? No, I don't think so. We have crappy security in this building, especially over the weekend. And everybody's in here. Anyway, we asked, what do you smoke? I don't smoke anything for 153. We got a healthy audience man. Almost 36% of the audience isn't smoking anything. They're not going to damage their logs. Just because George keeps trying to influence them. Well, he tries to influence him because it's good for business. Uh, 102 people smoke pot just pot that 16%. Of this audience, so just a bunch of potheads. cigarettes and pot just make sure that they're the square they just squirt their lungs. 120, 9.5%. cigars, my kind of people, 119.5%. I used to smoke cigarettes but quit 110, 8.5%. I used to smoke pot but quit 94, 7.4%. Probably with the economy, or they couldn't afford anymore. Or maybe they're just going to fart. Although a lot of the fart smoke pot don't they? I don't know. Yeah, sure they do. I don't know what I need to do. Oh, come on. A lot of old, you'd be amazed. I would be. cigarettes, 90, 7.1%. cigarettes, only. But if you take cigarettes and pot that's 210, it's almost 17%. And cigars and pot. I'm not done when you come down. cigars and pot. 56, 4.5%. And I used to smoke cigars but quit and just like I told you, very few of us smoke cigars and actually quit. Well, what's the point? You're not going to inhale them. And it's not like really smoking them constantly anyway. Only 18 people, 1.4%. Of course, we used to have like a real good cigar sponsors over the years. And then of course, so we had problems with that. It's big enough problems. What are we going to do about that balance for life thing? With no black sack today. Try your really shooting yourself in a foot baby. You make it a bad, bad mistake, Troy. Because the beast is really doing it 32 pounds he's lost in less than three months. He's a shadow of his former self. He started, I believe, the 286, now he's 250. No, he started a 284 or he's 250 too, right? Yeah, right. Got my numbers right. See, I haven't lost contact just because I'm up here. Those assholes down there. Oh, he's got to lose contact with what's going on. In fact, I got a story today. That's the epitome of everything that's how Florida's all about. What's about? I give up. It's from the Sun Sentinel. It's about the condo turns it else only and then they're trying to kick out the Luba couple just had a baby, the young couple. Yeah. Yeah. Same old, tired garbage because that's what South Florida's all about. It's not a place for living and breathing people for young people. It's a place for people who are either brain dead actually dead or waiting to die. Because it's just a stupid place. That's what it is. I saw that story. I said to myself, Jesus cried. It is really behaving or what? Same old tired crap over and over again. The one hit misses, I think is going to be good this week. But we don't want to do that today. One hit misses? Yeah. One hit wonders. The hits and the misses. I didn't get to that part of this website. There's really good website. It's classic rock.about.com. And then you click on the hits. And it's got a list. There are 39 that I counted on here. Classic rock. One hit wonders. T-Rex, Vanga Gong. No, yeah. Zagre and Evans in the year 25, 25. There's not, well I won't say there aren't any. But generally speaking, this list of 39 almost never. I'd say like 35 of my really like a lot. Looking glass, brandy. It's like they poured everything they had into the one song. And then when I can't stand, is a mungo jury in the summertime. I hate that. Oh, come on. Oh, nobody was blocked for it. You liked that song, mungo jury. I did a hundred years ago. What were they waiting for today? You mean I hate that. A piece of turd. Speaking of turd, log out at wqm.com and start playing the Toyota Baseball Trivia Challenge. Weekly prizes include, Go for four, it's Shulas. The grand prizes that trip for Tune in the Yorker of Labor Day weekend. To see the Marlins play the Metz or log on and start playing at wqm.com. You welcome Clarence and I'm probably thinking for Clarence. Who always gets me my checks early. I should help you remember that today was payday. You know what? Today's the 10th. I just mentioned that in passing because he clearly said like our permanent program director like Muff. He's not going to come running in there and say, Oh yeah, it's already was mailed out. It should have it by now. I don't know. See if it was Muff, he'd be running in there like with tears in his eyes. Because he kind of acted stupid once in a while, you know. 11 minutes after 9 at 5.60 Wqm, here's a simple question. If somebody offered to give you several thousand dollars over the next few years, would he accept it? Yeah, I'm sure you would because it'd be a little stupid. Not to do it. Stupid. Don't be stupid. Which makes it really foolish to pass up an opportunity to refinance a by-home just 3.95%. Here's the deal is a fanning a program out there. 3.95% both for refinancing and for the purchasing of homes. Think about it just 3.95% and all you have to do is confidential group. It's a toll free call. 1-800-9405363 and they'll explain to you just exactly how this works. It's 1-800-9405363. To be more specific, you can get yourself 100 grand with payments of only $475. Or get 200 grand with payments of $950. You'll save yourself a crap load of money and it will be downright stupid to pass up an opportunity like that. So do the math and do the next logical thing. Get all the details by calling financial group toll free 1-800-940-940. That's 1-800-9405363. There will equal housing letter, queter restrictions, do apply and wait to some... We'll be there. No portion of this program will be the advantages of our property. No, no, no, no, no. I'm WQA and BZ-Vodka Scroobe Incorporated. You're up, yeah. In the wind, say it long here, you know people eat now a pot. Wow, look, my food footballer, my cool, with here is an agricultural pot. This is a new black-a-ploss, with a young man and a whole crew. We're now opening my jacket at the house, neck. I feel a thing as room. Time's time, way hard inside. I am a silly program in my mind. In this story, you'll have me in the house. And the wind's in all the sluggers will fire outside. While I jump the fence around, you'll shout it. Way to really bite. Home for a fair, sweet, full of people who share it. And the new and new lives have a good face. They've made me some kind of old, blind blind when it happened. I am so proud of my mind. In this story, you'll have me in the house. We'll kill the baby. Oh, man, how many of those kids you read? Can't both will be the most free. You should talk in times. What means the most you've been? Clear the green, clear the long hair. In the wind's in all the sluggers, cause you ran out of teeth. I know I already have. In the 1980s, 560, WQM, I said I want to go away and he may not pick the release of his Consistent. He was an asshole when he came to town and he was still an asshole. Maybe just a little bit bigger, a lot bigger than he was when he got here. Now that's not true. We like him for about five minutes. Remember those days? I remember. You like padded on at ballspot and said, bro, we like you. You like sandy claws. Now we turn out that he was like, an asshole. So a science by the five-man electrical band. That's another one here wonder. Right? Human beings, nobody but me. That's a great song. That's been used for about 8,500 commercials too. And every movie and all over the place. Yeah. Do you need a center of the mind by the Amboy Dukes? For that was out freaking standing, you know? Yep. Never heard from them no more. Amboy Dukes, they're probably like 85 year old. In fact, they're probably a little bit cemetery village by now. What year was that? That's not out of the... Oh, I forgot up in the book. Not gonna pick up that book. It's right down there on the floor. Not gonna bend down. Here's our full question today, Eric. Speaking of people that won't bend down. How do you rate the job president portion as administration or doing? This is kind of a gap of filler before we start the thing with EO. One hit wonders. Come on. Okay. Fuck that's because I don't have the book. Although I do actually have enough here to start. What do you think? About starting it today? Yeah. We certainly have enough to start. You don't want to do the thing on Bush. You don't want to do a little Bush bashing today? Oh, it's fine. Are you kidding? Both are here. Here were the choices that I was going to give. Excellent. Okay. Fair. Poor. Or he's a bozo on a disaster. Sounds great. Yeah. Let's save this for tomorrow because I want to get a little more organized with a one-hit one. There's I want to get the book. Here's our full question, Eric. Like I said, how do you know what I mean? Everybody's talking about the failures of the FBI and the CIA and that thing with Carl Roe vapping up his mouth and Eskvar magazine and all I don't know wasn't the car was Andrew Card. I'm sorry. Uh-huh. Warning about Carl Roe taking over the whole place. Now that Karen used to go off to Texas and this guy has got any idea what does going on. We're talking about the president. What the? Like that. Oh, it's speaking about NATO. You assholes that voted for Ralph Nader. I got a great Ralph Nader story too. Eventually I'll get to it. You know something I just have too much stuff today. We might have to for and I don't have a schedule either. I should point out. We got no schedule. We got no log. We got no black sack with a fool from balance for life. I think the whole place is going to hell on a hand casket if you ask me. There's sure a lot of stupid things going on there. Man, I think I'm not there. By the way, there's a building wide search for the logs. Yeah, I would imagine. You thought we had an inquisition before what those emails. Man, we got a gigantic inquisition going on now. They got the hell out. In fact, we probably had to bring over some of the people from power so we could make it in an end Georgia, we could involve two and a girl. We could make it an authentic Spanish inquisition. All right. Miguel's not here all week by the way. Why is that? We're seeing on the patient. Yes. Well, good for him. We'll be back till Tuesday the 18th. What kind of vacation is that? That sounds like one of those long extended jobs. Like I'll get a vacation. He must be catching on. Nice going, Erma. Here's that pole again. One more time. Just in case Eric was busy with the Eggmuch muffin. I found another McDonald's yesterday. Not that I ate there, but oh, God, disgusting. They're everywhere. I mean, like, you know, if you're cleaning out like a cabinet similar to home, you might find a Golden arch in there, somewhere when you least expected. They're all over the goddamn place. You try to try the new grilled chicken flatbread sandwich. No, I did not. Now, why are you talking about food just because your sack is there? And already, Georgia's trying to sabotage your weight loss. Here's a guy that's done so well. We're trying to save his life. Was just a big blob of turd. Now he's a somewhat less well, he's lost 32 pounds and doing great. And just because the black sacks didn't show up before the show this morning, George starts talking about, Wow, I wasn't even hungry, but all this food talk. Well, what are you going to start? What are you talking about me sabotaging it? You guys were the ones bringing it up. I never talked about food. These suggested way in Arnold's and pizza loft. Yeah. And we're not here. I can eat the one of them. I'm telling you right now, you're not getting to one of them. So he actually suggested that we get something healthy in here. And so I'm going to work on that. Like balance for life. I think that if that would be good. I think if we rip him a nice enough, certainly Troy's got to be listening right now, would even his bad haircut. Hey, Troy, there's no black sacks at QAM. You asshole, you idiot. You psychotic idiot, in basil. How do these people supposed to stay on the street? No, thank God, they're spot. Now, look at that. It's coming up shortly. 940. I don't think that the sack's going to show up by 940. How about some fried chicken? Fried chicken? You crazy? Are you nuts? How do you rate the job on it? How come I'm asking this to pull now when I heard that voice? How do you rate the job president portion as an administration or doing? Excellent. Okay. Fair. Poor. Or he's a bozo in a disaster. That's all one by the way. That last. We don't want to have two separate categories. Excellent. Okay. Fair. Poor. Or he's a bozo in a disaster. I'm thinking real hard about my vote. So already it's not even 930 yet. You learned that Bob Carlisle, the one who sang the original butterfly kisses. They didn't sang it. He talked to that guy. And I forgot that already. Well, I'm mentioning that again for you. Bob Carlisle. One hit wonder. And that wasn't one I sound as list by the way. It's when I discovered myself in the book. I was just coming through it in the book too. I could do that right now. Only while let me get to some of the stuff I got. Please. I got a story here by Mark S. Rose from a new book. This is from the New York Post. Except from his new book. Michael Rose. Good bye, good men. About the priesthood. Man, it is just enough to make your flip your your thing. That's a gay club you more. I haven't told you for a long time, but it really, it really spells it off for you. And grizzly terms. Speaking of grizzly stories, Girl refused bathroom past May so teach you. Did you see this story? No, but good job. Sue away. This is in the hero of no less. Oh, here's the schedule. Let's hear it. All right. Let's see if we had more this morning. He's done. I mean, he's show is done for this morning. Joe Rose for a see. It's a good thing. We got this schedule. I wouldn't know that. The mad dogs off today. Boy, you were ticker was like summertime or something the way everybody's like school off. And I'm sitting here. I didn't even realize. And I got a big smile on my face. We wanted to watch already the tenth of June. Rims would spoon. And come like July 2nd. That's my last day before my two months summer like today we think starts. Yeah. Tussed as a whole, there's like a week off before that starts July 9th because the fourth which would be my first show from Amsterdam is July 4th. It's a holiday. Am I working on a holiday? No way, Jose. So that sounds very promising to me. Speaking of vacations, Little dog Joe Rose this afternoon for a mad dog will be back tomorrow. We got heck of chillers at three this afternoon. Josh Friedman proving that not everything is nothing is perfect. He'll be on just for half an hour, seven to seven thirty. Marlins on Dec. 730, 805, the Marlins at the world's Kansas City world. What is it, great rifle? No, brother. This inner league play. Some of it's okay and some of it really blows. Ed Kaplan right after baseball and then Joe and Mark the Judy boys overnight to talk about Amber Lynn. And a lot of other crap like it. Well let me get to this story. I don't have time. Don't let me forget girl reviews bathroom pass, Mason teacher. This is a positive young middle school. And guess what you did. And then we're guess what she was forced to do right in class. That's a little clue for you. Okay. All right. Is that enough to make you want to scream? I've been close. So enough to make me want to sue the guy. Damn school. Let's how pissed off and fired up. I am about that. Kind of teacher is that anyway. What kind of a freaking school is that down there? Does anybody speak English at that school? No, probably not. It's from my mom went to middle school. You know something. I don't know if it's because you're working at morning show. And I've been studying to sound like Robert now. Is he that was cruel? You know something. If I've told you once I've told you behind times that he started to sound a little bit like Robert. He is. So what are you getting for lunch? Right chicken. No you're not. You better not get paid out of the pipeline. Look if anything will get a nice salad. Maybe a chicken salad, chicken Caesar or something. No dressing of cool. Yeah, about to know what he's meant. Sounds good. I want to see that guy then. Troy walking that door. And the next five minutes with your black sacks is what I want to see because they screwed up big time. And there's one place of all the delivery spot. He's got that he shouldn't be screwed up until a QAM because let's face it. Let's face it when your car puts good crap. You can do a lot of different things. You can help out the other pages and play Russian with your valuable company. Not a good idea. In fact, it's kind of stupid to do that. Or you can pick up the phone or call our good friends to dry concepts. That's the smart thing. That's what I've been doing for over 20 years now.

Same. But the same Bernard. The mad dog, we tasted one unsports retail 560. The UAM. I don't care go back to Canada, you're too bastard. Put on my final ones and out, head of full street. Just to doubt the best of hustler and out, start a movie. I'm so liassie people, check it out my fun vassie. Yeah, I got a first class riser, it don't pitch the 10-months. They're all sporting a movie. I'm finding it impossible to look and see how I'm sporting a movie. I feel like an absolute hour will. So the ghost of the sea, he was sporting one to follow him up to the gate to the prison. Just to see what he would do. Just close the face to the demon. As he headed for his room, he's screaming. There's a prison that goes straight and follows post. Down in the jungle room, we're sporting one to his and man fest. It's still impossible to conceal a sporting one to his and man fest. I feel like a match-o. Without a wheel, sport food isn't bad for this. It's almost impossible to conceal. It's going to go in his and man fest. I feel like a match-o-bout. Okay, I'm sure you know who to do with your old bad, don't you? Walking in Memphis? Oh, I knew the guy was named, but I hated that song twice for got it. May 25, 1991, that's the week it hit the chart where you got it. It's number 13, no matter a fact. I give you a little bio and then of course you'll absolutely still not know who to help was, right? Born in 59 in Cleveland, pop-ops rock singer, a writer penis. Said he had a great penis. On the 1991 best new artist Grammy Award, which goes to show how much they knew. Nothing. Mark Cone. Oh yeah, C-O-H-N. That was a medley of his smash, walking in Memphis, and I was hit. That was the end of him. Don't see him no more. Maybe he's hanging out with Elvis. He's either hanging out with Elvis or maybe he was. Jesus Christ. One of the other. But one here, no Mark Cone, no more. Do you want to know another one? Okay. This could be a lot of fun. We could, we could grab this out all the way to the third of July. I love it. I love it. But as well, it feels like a holiday here in the building. Yeah, what's going on there? Do you want to first of all, you come in much later than usual this morning, which is really nobody's business. But I found that to be a little bit of a district. Yeah, I got hung up. He got hung up, and probably I made a deal around the corner with one of his Jamaican friends. And then he tells me that there's nobody there, and there's no log, and there's no black sacks. And there's no cars in a parking lot. And what else? It seems that some of the stuff may have been removed from talents and mailboxes in the control room. Some of the stuff may have been removed from talents mailboxes. And there's right here's the logs. Oh, so in other words, there were people in there like thieving in the steering over the weekend. Maybe because it's not certain. We're not sure. Well, that's the preliminary evaluation of our acquisition. Okay. That's a strong word though, thieving. I like pulvering better. There were a lot of people pillvering over the weekend, and they're in the yank and stuff. There was a lot of yank and going on. Well, who the hell would do that? For how? No, seriously. How can they get in? I got an idea because these are the other people have those shows on the weekend. You don't have all the little boyfriends and girlfriends and in-between's come in and hang out. Uh huh. Never while with those people, see when logs and things like that. Maybe maybe she's kids winner this weekend. That could be it. They're a little old for that now. I would think. No, I don't think they're ever going to outgrow that. Less crane. Desitter water. Remember that? No. Nineteen 71. Less crane. It was like a talking thing. Don't you remember that? No. Originally. No, I don't have it. Originally a piece of prose. Desitter water. It's a thing where he talks, uh, I don't know. Anyway, he was a less crane was a TV show. Hosty was an ABC's nightlife, not nightline in 1964. Do you remember that? No. Desitter water? I would have heard it, maybe. How about Tom Cochrane in life as a highway? Okay. I don't know. Not a bad song. How about 1985? Cochrane when your heart is weak. So who killed Tom Cochrane? I don't know, but I must have been right after you or they recorded that song.

Bobby Day, rockin' Robin. We had the Cochrane. How about rockin' Robin? You remember that? Sure. Corny but still. Can't rate Corny? Okay. I'll work on that. That's going to be a mammoth project. I'll tell you that right now. A gigantic project. Almost as big as the acquisition that's going on a QM right now. About who stole the logs and who did all of their buddies' meal. And maybe even some of the emails. An attorney for Ponce Daily on Middle School of Students found notice the pseudegural's Math teacher and the Dan County Public School System. Because the girl says her teacher refused to let her use the bathroom and forced her to have a bowel movement in class. This is one of the worst stories. The suit seeks unspecified damages for humiliation that seventh graders so FIA Goudira such E. suffered, Coral Gables attorney Jason Sechtin said. So FIA 14 says she had a stomachache April 24, but her teacher Edwin Victor Lewis did not give her a bathroom pass. So FIA says she acts several times until Victor Lewis was an emergency. So FIA also says Victor Lewis humiliated her in front of the class by saying, if you can't hold it, you should be wearing pamperes. Can you imagine if your daughter had a similar situation in class and the teacher said, if you can't hold it, you should be wearing pamperes? I don't want to imagine that. Yeah. I guarantee you'd be right down there with a piece. Yeah. So if his mother Judith Goudira was furious when she heard her daughter's story, she says she wanted Victor Lewis to make a personal apology to Sefe and front of the class, but that never happened the family says. Goudira's went to the school and talked to one of the vice-principals demanding the school of apologizes well, who request wasn't taken seriously, she said. I was totally upset by this Goudira said and she should be, by the way, by daughter's never had a conduct problem. The teacher had no reason not to believe her if she said she need to use the bathroom for an emergency. Officials with the United Teachers of Dates say that Victor Lewis, a union member, laid defended by school district attorneys even if she's also named individually in the suit. Who she? Huh? I don't understand that. This is in the Harold, by the way. So if you're trying to follow that, I don't know. Victor Lewis did not return from Carl Seek and come and like Greg Reed. Sophia who had a B average racket and mixed an A's and B's in conduct under last report, heard? Seach had been uncomfortable with the school since the incident in this more than 12 days. School officials say that Victor Lewis is the teaching for more than two years as a complaint free record. Ponce principal, a manual girl, C.S. is teaching the Ponce can give bathroom flat passes. During class at their own discretion for emergencies, he added that some teachers are more strict with passes because some students use them as an excuse to get out of class. If the parents for valicum fourth district can become more responsive to parents, said Bernard Prolemotid, director of the Children of New York, when it could be you who I'm law school, a student soon their teacher is not unprecedented. I've never heard of a case like this in date, but with a fourth largest school district, so I wouldn't be surprised if it happened before. All she added to was take like a, like a crap, that's all. They choose calling, maybe it happens to the best of us. She met happens, man, and he said, you know, if you can't hold it, you ought to be wearing pamper's. I have to go down to and just slap the crap out of him, you know, that hyphenated piece of turd. 20 children imagine. Sorry. So let me ask you since it's time for a 20-tilted QAM time for the valence for life's time for the black sac show up here.

Barland's travel to Kansas City to battle with a royal scum with 36730 on sports video 5-16-Q-A-N. Me on God. Are you ready for the blues? This weekend your PBS station presents the famed Kansas City Blues harmonises. No tear Johnson in. Get ready for the blues. Yeah, did you think? You don't know why they're ready for the blue, yo. What's the best thing to do you guys are doing the balancing wine? Do you think they're ready for the bath or the bath? Yeah, you can't see a woman with your best friend. You know what the blue is all about. It's not easy to get ready for the blues. That's why, nose hair, Johnson and others take three hours talking about it without ever actually playing any music.

You ready for the blues. Get ready for the blues. This weekend on your PBS station. Make possible by a grant from the Chub group. If you had the kind of money they do, you'd have a Chub too. 9.45, look off at them, blue with baby. I think that's a good point in there. Anyway, here's the fact that says I tuned in the WQM for the first time in a long time this morning and I said to myself, Joey Reynolds is back. Come to find out later it's Howard David. They both sound the same. I don't think Howard used to sound like that, but then we'll table it right me. And it had an effect on his voice. I don't think he sounds anything like Joey Reynolds. No, no, not at all. No. Thank God for that. Thanks, Alfred. Small favor, small. I just talked to Troy from Balance for Life. And what did he say was he apologetic? He's very out of breath. He's very upset because he and he well should be because I'm going to carve him an ass. He knows that. According to his manifest, everything was delivered on time. He's talking to the driver right now. Make sure and check up. But everything was delivered according to his record. Well, now wait a minute. Just a second here. Let's let's get involved in this inquisition a little bit right on here. Is it possible that the food was delivered and somebody dick with that also? It could very well be knowing this place. Since we have all these things that have vanished, the logs are disappearing and people's mail be disappearing and maybe the little black sacks be disappearing. Not that anybody even probably even knew what was inside. Just out of spite. Maybe we got some O'sha on provocative tour in that place going on now. Maybe. But Troy is he's very upset. Or maybe he's a delivery guy just wrote down, you know, bunch of stuff like he delivered to him. He didn't do it. Maybe that's it. Maybe he ate it. Or you'll destroy the benefit of the doubt. No. Okay. Absolutely not. You kidding me? He's been clever. Have you ever seen him? Have you ever seen that haircut? No. Got all mighty. Anyway, here's a thanks from Ron. Who says he's the Camerole SS guy. Do we know what that means? No. I know what that means, Ron. But thanks for he's got a good list for it. Anybody that's got one hit wonder stuff. He can start facts made in today at 305, 65 or 190, even though we're doing a different pool today. We'll start that tomorrow. Once I get the book and then not only that, I'll give me some time to do some homework. I'll go through because you'll notice just in a couple of pages and go through my top 40 book. Look at all the good stuff I found there. But they're all a crap. 44 votes on our pool. How do you write the job that President Bush in his administration be doing? He's a Bozo and disaster 21. Excellent. 12. 12. Okay. 7. Okay. Fair 3 and poor 1. So here's the list from Ron. A little bit of soul by the music explosion. See, I'm going to have to verify those and find, you know, by looking up in the book, making sure that was the only hit. But I'm sure in that case, Tracy by the cufflinks. Yeah. You remember that, don't you? No. Tracy that and then. Oh, that wasn't it. That was something. Something don't be hero. Was it what was that call it? Billy, don't be hero. But it sounded kind like that. If I had it here, you'd have recognized it. Winchester, a cathedral and Ron didn't know was by the new Vaudeville band. He has a question mark. Shame on you, Ron. No one did drive a Cameroon out of Corvette. Bonnie implied by Georgie fame. Excellent. Reading himself there real quick. Get together by the young bloods. Very good. That was a big hit. It's a special by Terry Stafford. And Elvis sounded like that was a good song. It's a special. A little green bag by the George Baker selection. I got one of those. And double shot of my babies loved by the swing of the Italians. For this is excellent. I love that. I love the music shows. Because it kills a lot of good time. Speaking of killing good time, this guy damn Ralph Nader. And I'm going to say it again. You ask holes out there devoted for Ralph Nader and help make a bush president. Be scientific. They stole Florida. Just you people frost my ass to show you what a total asshole Ralph Nader is. I read this to a couple days ago was right after um, Game six of the Western Conference and B.A. did you see this beast? He let the room. What do you mean he left the room? Oh, don't tell me he had a. Gee if he can't hold the yada where a papar is said to work. Okay. He didn't tell me why he was leaving. He just left. He left very suddenly. He started at a little bit stupid. Better watch it. Better watch it because he's producing a mo show and if he looks at mo cross side one time that will be the end for him. He'll be finito. Ralph Nader, this is in New York post today, editor by the process matter of fact. Ralph Nader, the self-sile consumer affairs crusader and green party presidential candidate, has a new cause cleaning up officiating a financial basketball association. Huh? Yeah, a poll by the number of fouls called against the Sacramento Kings in Game Six of the Western Conference Championship series with the L.A. Lakers, Nader's demanding an official review. Nader believes that the public's confidence shaken because of corporate misbehavior demands greater impartiality and professionalism in sports. That sense was severely broken during Game Six he complains in letter to when B.A. Commissioner David Stern. Actually, the Kings received more fouls in Game Seven, but couldn't hit their free throws grounds for another investigation? It's quite clear what's going on here, Nader almost single-handedly made the trial orders what they are today. His dubious probes of the auto industry in the 60s and 70s and his hordes of public interest research groups helped ignite the litigation explosion in our hobbles legitimate business. Does he need to make pro sports next? Last year, one baseball fan sued another one over one of Barry Bonds record-breaking home run balls, will later now help spur lawsuits over calls from referees and umpires? Whether it's the assembly line or the basketball court doesn't matter, Raph Nader is unsafe in any arena. What a great short but right to the point editorial in the right way in New York Post today, I love it. And a lot of you clowns out there, it's not a lot, but some of you bozos out there voted for Raph Nader. Remember some of those old grizzles for its colleague and after the election and trying to defend the indefensible about how come why they voted for them and so on? If I live to be a thousand. Shame on you people, shame on you! Who did that song, shame on you? Give me a moment. Now you're looking at up in the guy, no no, I had no book, be still verified. He is that guy. You got a book there, but I haven't had nowhere near me. Well, I have my book in my hand right now, just put them on. I made it around the other side of the song, and shame on you, the rest of the one me, by Bobby Bear. There is no such song, shame on you. No, I'm thinking of it. I've made you think of it, but that's because I just painted the scene you brain. No, no song, please. Go song or soul or something like that. I heard in my head. Shame, shame. You know something, I think you're right. They're shame. Shame on you if you can't dance to, I'm thinking of it. It's some shame by Evelyn Champaign King. Maybe that's it. And then Zane also recorded shame, but it wasn't called shame on you. Well, whatever. See, once we start getting the music, it's just enough to drive up the wall, go to your nuts. You can lose it. Let's see, making predators, I better not start doing this one right now, because it's too long, but it, believe me, the leave me will capture your attention. All here's some good news. My home all level, since everybody's concerned about my, my costwell was only 207, which isn't that bad. Not, it should be under 200, but 207 for a fatal swab like me, and I'll add bad, especially all at nestleys, total, which I did again this weekend. Also, I got that, I couldn't resist. I'm in my supermarket, and I'm looking at it, and now why did I stop and look in the ice cream? Why did I do that? Because I went to my dominion store, and I walked, I marched right past the ice cream cooler, I flew by there. Although out of the corner of the eye, I did see the half gallons of nestleys, short life, and all that will be the end for you. I flew by. But then in my other supermarket, I walked in here, and I, I'm looking at the ice cream thing, and it was like, nestleys flavors, but not total, and I thought, okay, I'm safe. But I looked on the labels, you know how in the front of you looking at the real small print there, they label what everything is supposed to be. Right. And it said nestleys, total. Well, some other kind of flavor, so I moved the first one out of the way, and low and behold, guess what was right behind it? nestleys, total, God damn it. A leader. I said, take me to your leader. And of course, you're going to say, well, you didn't bring it home, but you told the thing, I want to see it. You're right. That's like a little more than a chord. A chord of ice cream, is that, is that disgusting or what? Sounds good to me? It was good. It was outstanding. You'd love it. But my home-all-level, since I'm taking my full-acassied with these, that the sundown product, which I gave me the wrong name, I'm going to have to go look at a bottle. Now, normal is 4.3 to 15.3, but you really wanted under 10. And in spite of a lot of the cardiologist out there who are most of my real assholes like my former doctor, like Dr. Dick, who are obsessed with cholesterol levels, it's quite a batch. Just like Dr. McColley, a Kilmer, a McColley, a Culkin, a Weber's name, is says, Homocysteine is the real marker for heart disease, baby, for heart attack. And my homo level was 7.4. I think that's the second best they've ever had. How do you like that, huh? Awesome. Not because I'm doing anything all I write, but because I'm a little not bad at full-acassied everyday. I popped those things like crazy. See, I'll tell you, there are two or three things. So make a fish or else, I don't want to get on this nutrition crap because I'll audience likes to eat. But the Omega 3, 6 and 9 fish or else, the CoQ10 and the folic acid, those three things when you can actually see a difference in the way you feel and also your body chemistry based on supplements, then you really can pull through these asshole doctors and other jerks. And I don't know what they're talking about, who say, oh yeah, that stuff, all of a dozen video healthy, toilet pool. It doesn't the way I think is your pee right out. Wrong. You wrong doctor. By the way, I got to tell you from now until a little about October to find a doctor down there, you think there's a chance? There's a chance. See, the good thing is I don't really need you to doctor that much anymore. Now that I got my friend in there, lab there or a collaborator, it's thanks again, I'd you the best baby. 9.56 and 5.60 WQAM.

There's been some real dittler around in. You know what it strikes me? Probably a disgruntled X employee. Is that what usually happens? A lot typically. Somebody that still has access to the building. Because no stranger, no outside of would come in there and dittler with the logs. They wouldn't even know what a program log looks like. I mean, they'd see it. They wouldn't even know what it was. Am I right? No. Or the value of it. Think it's all in the black market. Yeah. You mean an EDR? Maybe that's what they did with the black socks. Yeah. Maybe they took everything that was black. I don't know. But it looks to me. Now, see, this is a question of who do you believe? You know, do we believe Troy that is delivery guy showed up? Because they didn't show up at my house so that a weekend Friday night. He's so up for a straffer. They're not telling him you were going to be back Friday. That's a lie because George knows better. They fact me sample menus to fill out. And I told him to George. I said, tell him, bring it. They know what I like. Bring whatever they want. I don't need to fill these up. Remember that? I remember it. Yeah. Troy was here. So I don't give me a song to dance about that. They didn't know that I was going to be there. They knew I was going to be there. They screwed up. They f-top. Okay. They f-top. F-trupe f-op. Speaking of f-n-up 89 votes in our poll.

Okay. 17. Okay. Fair 7. And poor. Four. New York Post making predators. How did the Catholic Church wind up with so many predator priests? Some shocking answers can be found in good-bye good men. Michael S. Rose's new book I'm now f-n-s in the Church's seminaries in American and Europe. To preserve confidentiality, some names are pseudonym. The issue was never one of my subillicitability for the nation. Rather was the gay click that, but given veto power for who got ordained, says Joseph Kaleni, former seminarian, Edmundaline, seminarian Chicago, this is to put it mildly. That's a gay clump you moron. How can any healthy heterosexual seminarian expect to be properly formed and prepared for the Catholic priesthood when he is constantly subjected to that which is so clearly contrary to church teaching and discipline? How many heterosexual seminarians or the Oxford not have decided to leave the seminarian abandoned their vocations because of the gay subculture they were forced to endure because they've been harassed or even molested? We're not talking here about the presence of a few homosexual oriented men who conduct themselves with perfect authority, rather they exist and intents and often threatening atmosphere. According to former seminarians and recently ordained priest, this gay subculture is so prominent at certain seminaries that these institutions have earned nicknames such as Noter Flame for Notre Dame seminarian New Orleans. And theological closet for theological college at the Catholic University of American Washington, D.C., St. Mary seminarian Baltimore is earned the nickname, The Pink Palace. Yeah, I'm with you. Father Andrew Walder ordained for the D.C. of Bridgeport, Connecticut in 2000, spent several semesters at the Baltimore School as a seminarian for the D.C. of Patterson New Jersey. The problem was so bad he explained that some of the students and faculty used to get dressed up in leather to go to the block. Waldermore's equivalent of 40-second street man, hadn't. Seminary and sometimes accompanied by faculty members would do this regularly while to explain they would meet in the foyer and then head for the gay bars. The situation is not new and the claim is not uncommon in March of 2000, Father Andrew Greely, a well-known liberal presocialologist from Chicago, testified that seminary professors tell their students that they're gay and take some of them to gay bars and gay students leave with each other. Walder said he tried to explain to his bishop Frank Wattimer what the atmosphere of the school was, with such an open acceptance and sometimes encouragement of the gay subculture. My constant thing to the bishop was that this is not just about homosexuality, this is about an agenda in a celibate seminary, it's something directly and conflict with the teaching of the church. These people are promoting this conflict. Father John Traglio of Harrisburg-Pencil Vagnodize, remembers visiting St. Mary's in Baltimore when he was a seminary in Pennsylvania. There was no discretion at all he said of the gay subculture there. The few times that was there, some of the seminarians would literally dressed like Gays from the village. They would even go so far as to where pink silk it was like going to see La Cajja fall. In my day at St. Mary said father John disparred now a religious order priest from the southeast down the hall there would be two guys together in the shower and everybody knew it. Seminaryants who accept the churches teaching on sexual morality have not only been dismissed from seminary as trouble makers, they've also been threatened by classmates and faculty, especially in religious houses, that if they did not submit the homosexuality to a spouse and defend homosexual acts, if not take part of them, their priest they careers would be in jeopardy. In the mid-30s James Dessegar attended a Midwestern seminary in his mid-30s from the time he first arrived there he found that his Orthodox views of the church were outwanted. He was even accused many times of leading the younger seminarians away from what the formation staff was tried to win still in them. But they were trying to stick in them. During the second year of a seminary studies it was visited late La Al-Bon Knight by three of these younger seminarians who looked up to the Dessegar some of an older brother and role model. Taken off guard Dessegar was frightened by what they had to relate. They began to describe how the college director had been forcing them in a sexual situation and how they'd be gunned to wish they were dead he'd be called. Having a background in social work, Dessegar took to sight of the seminarians and spoke to them as any counselor would about the empowerment of rape victims. My main instruction then was that they had a right to say no. He also advised that none of them informed the director that they had spoken about the sexual abuse because it would mean vocational death to them all. Eventually however one of the young seminarians let the information slip. From that time on my life became a living hell at the seminary he recalled, Dessegar soon asked his diocese if he could transfer to another seminary. At first they seemed happy enough to accommodate however one dessegar we see this final evaluation it was terrible. I'd always received glowing evaluations in my prior reports he explained. Dessegar figured that since the college director knew of his knowledge of sexual abuse of several seminarians he had decided to sabotage Dessegar's vocation. The vocational death he had predicted some months before came to pass at least for him. Charles Enderby a former businessman from Ohio was in his 30s when he began his Novit, what is it? Novit Novitiate? What is that? A new guy? Some Catholic thing. For an East Coast religious order in the early 1990s he was immediately struck by the outwardly homosexual mannerisms of some of the other novices. One of them Joseph Mercado had worked as a massage artist before entering religious life actually brought his massage table to the Novitiate interviewer called. While Mercado was only mildly open about his homosexuality, France, Asher was militant. Enderby described Asher as a little man in his early 40s when a highly inflected voice. He had ascetic humor said Enderby but consistently mocked church teaching on celibacy and particularly like to mock mother and jelica. One they he even said he wanted to make sudden dresses out of the altar linens. According to Enderby Asher began almost at once to harass Jeffrey Raymond who Menderby regarded as the only novice other than himself who was definitely not part of the dominant gay subculture. Feeling threatened Raymond confided in Enderby, he told him that Asher first was trying to convince him that he Raymond was a latent homosexual who just needed to accept being gay. With Enderby's assistance Raymond was in early 20s brought a complaint of sexual harassment of their novice master father, SIX this. I wonder if he knows the asdicous. Although we act of concerns of a thetic said Enderby the novice master took no action. Asher's harassing behavior continued in a second complaint was made of father's sixties. This time the novice master appeared less sympathetic. He literally threw up his arms and asked his related enderby what he was supposed to do with the vocations office kept sending him gaze. When Raymond and I complained the third time said Enderby father's sixties threatened the kick us out. He was very angry with us and we realized then that our novice master would do nothing to solve the problem of homosexual harassment. A few months later when a cold night in March of 1994 and we recounted, Raymond and Asher were watching TV in a community room and each had been drinking wine. After Raymond retired to bed that night Asher ended Raymond's room uninvited the doors had no locks and sexual elicidum. The next morning Raymond angry and rejected told Enderby what had happened and informed him he was leaving religious life after a few brief words with father's sixties, Raymond bought train tickets and left never to be turned. Although Asher later attacked and raped another novice at Enderby he emerged again with impunity, not only was he not asked to leave he was promoted to the position of dean of novices, a position that hadn't even existed before that said Enderby. In other words he knew his positions. The orthodox seminary in his presented with another predicament in this regard if there's anything devied or immoral going on with a seminary, it abresented the attentive of his superiors he's likely risking expulsion. Many members of seminary faculties don't appreciate those who go to the superiors with complaints especially about sexual foibles. Reflecting on his experience at Mount Angel seminary in Oregon, father John Lewandowski remarked many of my fellow students reminded me of the three monkeys, one with his hands over his eyes one with hands over his ears and the other with hands over his mouth. The maximum sceno evil here no evil speak to evil seems to be a standard survival tactic in the seminaries. Yet that type of information doesn't exactly prepare a seminary in to be a bold preacher of the gospel. Nevertheless that's the environment in which many priests are being formed today.

It's going to be like 26 today, what's that? 79, Fahrenheit? I guess. Last time I turned it. What do you mean you guess? You better get it. I don't understand. I know what you're bringing. You're bringing a little bit. If you're going to be, if you're going to redeem yourself, you have to be the one that solves this mystery that's going on that building now. I'll be shaggy. Isn't an amazing harmony in positions if you're going on there to last several weeks in at the QAM building? By the way, something. Yes. I just talked to Troy from balance for life again. His driver swears the food was delivered, so he will make new sacks and bring it on over right now. How do you like that, boys and girls? The food was delivered and the sacks had disappeared. The logs disappeared. The mail. The mail disappeared. Nobody has been dicking around in the QAM building and believe you me. If you think that Greg went nuts the last time with his inquisition, there is going to be an investigation going on right now that even Shilak Holmes would be embarrassed by it's going to be incredible. It's what it's going to be. So have us been dicking with all the stuff down here at QAM. You better watch it because you're going to get it. I say we nail him up to across right there. Right there, kitty corner, Chuck Subcenter there. On a corner of Ivory Road in 441, we have a little chunk of lawn over here. That's part of the building. I'd like you right out there at the intersection would be good. Real heavy duty crap going on. Here's a suggestion for you by the way. Don't pass me any more stories. Any more pre-stories today? Oh, I only fetched you a couple of the 10 that I've just got. Well, don't pass me any more. Because I got enough pre-stories here. I got pre-scuming out my ass. Okay. I got enough stories here to take me until seven weeks from circus. By the way, before we get to that and also the area in a huffington, which I can't stand or but once in a while she writes something pretty interesting, did the drug war claim another 356 casualties and 911 she writes, which I think I'm going to get to that in a second. But before that, our sugar hunger was out of control. This is the examiner, one of my very favorite tabloids. Guess how much we eat and this is a good one for the beast. Guess how much sugar each American eats every year. It's an average number, of course. How many pounds? How many? I said 800 pounds. Not seen how you just being silly. Stupid. 212 pounds. The average American, we're not doing so bad. The average American eats 150, 2 pounds a sugar year. That's 30 more pounds in just 20 years ago. I'll see the beast said, how much did you say 212? 1212. That was you before a balance for life. No, that was, that was more like 312. Food companies took out the fat, but then they replaced it with sugar. You'd be surprised at all the healthy products that are loaded with sugar. Everybody knows about soda and candy, but not a lot of folks realize many foods like yogurt and power bars, cereal, sticks, gelatin cups and putings are loaded with carbohydrates, which convert to sugar in a potty. So a lot of those sugar free, like chocolates and a lot of those other sugar free products I've been trying to tell you for years are going to kill you because they're loaded with carbohydrates and convert immediately to sugar in a potty. They're going to kill you, baby. I'm telling you that right now. Don't blame fat all the time when you're croak on your deathbed because I warn you by the way, how about some Nestle's turtle sounds good? Sounds good to me. Well, as long as you're going to croak anyway. And why are they making a bit all of this? This son of a bitch, this richard, what is his name again? Also his stick clots. He's clots. Oh, god. I like him. You like him? I think he's quirky. He is the most obnoxious human being on the face of the earth. He even makes Osama Yamama look like a good guy. Richard Quest. This everything that's wrong with the Brit. He gives me the schmets. I'll tell you that right now. Richard Quest. Who used to be on CNBC the European version. That's why I saw him first over there at Amsterdam. And now we get the great players since he jumped ship since CNN has picked up every loser that ever came down to Pike. They got Richard Quest down there. Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, man. You like him? I think he's a quirky funny guy. I think he's a family. So John Lesley, you know, and as Jack, he was the one who gave the game away earlier. Last week. But he said he's a pro that he did. Yeah, I'm out of here. Anyway, Arianna Huffington writes, the Phoenix memo the Rauley letter, the Oklahoma Red Flag, all of them elements in this true and tragic story of fumbling feds that has more smoking guns than a Quentin Tarantino movie. So why did the FBI whose job it is to find smoking guns fail to see the smoking guns popping up all around it? And announcing his big reorganization plans, director Robert Mueller seemed to consider the FBI's tragedy of errors, a question of flawed management flow charts, note nothing that re-a re-geared PowerPoint presentation couldn't fix. But there was a much more fundamental problem plaguing the Bureau before 9-11, and it wasn't one of office politics but of office-wide priorities, namely the agency's crippling addiction to America's war on drugs. Is this exactly what I've been screaming? Yes. While Osama Yamama Vin Laden is al-Khaida, minions were diligently preparing for their murder resmission, the FBI was looking the other way with equal determination. More than twice as many FBI agents were signed to fighting drugs, 2500, and fighting terrorism 1151, and a far greater amount of the FBI's financial resources was dedicated to the war on drugs. And this pathological prioritization of the drug works that it well beyond the allocation of money and manpower, it was ingrained in the culture. Counterterrorism units were treated like the Bureau's ugly stepchildren, looked down upon by FBI management because they weren't making the kind of high-profile arrest that's Bruce Upper Supervisors resume and make the evening news. Let's face it, cambetsing flight schools and searches suspicious students is nowhere near a sexy as one of those big drug busts with a bags of coke or bales of pot-piled high for the cameras. It's now painfully clear that were tear-warning signs of plenty, but they were disregarded by distracted FBI officials who had their eyes on a very different prize. In Phoenix were the now infamous Ken Williams memo originated. Counterterrorism agents complained bitterly about the reference being given the lowest investigative priority by a supervisor who preferred glamorous drug fighting investigations. Even though the anti-terrorist squad was understaffed, having been a sign only eight of the division's 200 agents, it had managed to infiltrate groups' suspected terrorists through the use of paid informants, including a man with being trained to be a suicide bomber. They had also uncovered local men with ties to the World Trade Center bombing Sheik Omar Abdel Rostman, and a very lengthy anti-American Muslim organization linked to Al Qaeda. So what was their reward for all of this? Regular head-butting sessions with higher ups who blocked it having to allocate resources for information that didn't lead to immediate arrests. Albed W.S. to donuts that the Phoenix agents, donning out cash to drug casings, is very rarely ran up against the same sort of resistance, or one veteran terrorism squad member described as micromanaging, constant indecision and stonewalling. Meanwhile across the country in Boston, ride hijazzy in a minute al Qaeda member who would become an informant exchange for avoiding jail, trying to warn FBI agents about a terrorist and sympathizers, particularly not be a lot more robber member of an al Qaeda terrorist cell who was arrested in the wake of 911. But the FBI wasn't interested in hijazzy's terror leads, the only wanted to hear what he knew about heroin being smuggled in New America from Afghanistan. And it wasn't just the FBI, this drug war overallist mindset infected the entire law enforcement community starting at the top. I want to escalate the war on drugs set at Attorney General John Ascroft and his first interview after being nominated to the post. I want to renew it. I want to refresh it. And he was true to his word, witnessed the $43 million dollars the Bush administration gave to the Taliban just four months before September 11th, which we talked about a lot on this program, by the way. Sure there was a small detail of harbouring a guy named Bin Laden, but the Taliban had agreed to ban the production of opium poppies, and so the drug war was trumped the terror war once again. So this kind of thinking was, is this kind of thinking finally a thing of the past? Yes, I'm not so sure. Even after last week's highly touted reorganization, which included the reassignment of 400 narcotics agents to counter terrorism, there will still be 2100 agents spending their invadible time and energy fighting a fruitless drug war. This despite the fact that combatting drugs didn't even make direct or Mueller's official top-end list of priorities. Which raises the question, if the drug war is suddenly low on the FBI pecking order the cabani white collar crime, number seven, protecting civil rights number five, and taking on public corruption to all levels number four with a bullet, then how come one out of six agents will be still working that beef, the numbers just don't add up. According to high ranking FBI officials, Mueller originally intended to pull the plug on his agencies, involvement in the drug war, shifting every one of his counter narcotics agents to counter terrorism activities, but was talked out of it by drug war generals who can admit defeat. Not only should the White House follow through on Mueller's instinct and choose the war on terror over the Oregon's drugs, they should insist that the FBI are new kinds of people to fight this new kind of war. Nearly re-assigning traditional FBI agents to fight terrorism isn't enough. Former Senator Gary Harder co-chair the US Commissioner National Security told me the new counter terror team should be more like the Delta Force, not stand at issuagents and dark suits and ties, but young imagine in a 21st century investigators recruited from outside the bureau. At the same time, we should make sure the administration doesn't just transfer the drug war and it's attended lavish funding from the FBI to the DEA, which will note doubt show up on a hill any day now looking for more money to take up the drug fighting slack. As the sering budget deficit reminds us federal coffers are not a bottomless will, everything comes with a price. Sadly it's looking more and more like the price of the drug war may have included the 356 lies lost on 911. Excellent. 1027 at 560 WQAM.

Songwriter George Whiting was living in some Florida condominiums when he wrote my blue heaven under another one of my favorites, fat's domino, but not a one hit wonder. My blue heaven in 1923 love song that says in Baby Makes Three, had even here he would have had a right and baby makes zero. Just as Daniel Cruz, 27 and Elizabeth Cruz, 24, condo owners of these sprawling Hollywood golf and tennis club. They bought their units for 49, 5 and 1998 when they were newly wedged. They love the amenities and the fact that their mothers lived in the complex. It meant that when the time came, there would be two nearby baby sitters. Just a little leftover flim from last week. Though Hollywood was known as a havin' for active retirees, active retirees. It had no age restrictions. As original owners died, their air sought to unload the apartments at low prices, which was learned younger couples. Two years later on February 4th, 2000, the complex voted to become an adult's own community. Current residents were grandfathered in, but babies were not. Babies were not. Six weeks ago Elizabeth Cruz gave birth to megan their first child. Now the association that runs the 1932 apartment complexes telling them that either the baby must go or they must go. What would your choice be? I'd leave. How about forcing a kid down the toilet? Well, why sell an apartment to a young couple that just got married, put them through credit and background checks, and expect them not to have babies, Daniel Cruz said, that's what young couples do. That's why they screwed their brains out and they make babies. Ah, sometimes even when they don't want one. Last week the Cruz has received a letter from the Association telling them that they were in violation of the rules because a child under 18 was living with them. A lot of the child remained a letter said compromises, Hollybroke status as an over 55 community. Federal law requires at least 80% of the units in a complex to have at least one resident over 55 to be considered adult only. I got to read that again. Federal law requires at least 80% of the units in a complex to have at least one resident over 55 to be considered adult only. You follow that? Okay, I guess that's the rule. Well, give them a 60 or 90 days to find a place to live association president Carl Sheckler said if they don't, we'll turn it over our attorneys to get a quarter. I remember stories like this years and years ago when I was on WS News 20, some years ago. I remember grotesque, horrible stories like this, and it's still going on. The Cruz's attorney Leonardo Renault said he might try to fight the order, although he'd prefer to resolve the situation amicably. They are owners, not renters, it's Callos he said. Their daughter is just born and they're telling him to move. In fact, I remember the one story where some people had a pet monkey in the association said the monkey was okay, but people had a baby and a head made them move out. That's the true story. That's the true story. Old enough to know better. Oh, maybe the monkey might have been a senior citizen, I forgot that's right. But the board's attorney Gary Polyakov of Fort Lauderdale said a January third ruling by the Florida Supreme Court makes it unlikely the Cruz's could win in court. The unanimous landmark ruling upheld the right of condo association to change the rules, even if they have a negative impact on some owners. A rule change doesn't harm anyone's rights to court said, because condo owners are aware that rules can be changed. Yeah, right. What kind of a stupid reasoning is that? What about if the condo says, if you're under 90, they're going to kick your ass out. The Supreme Court has said that when the covenants are amended properly, it's binding and all owners even those who bought with the expectation of having children Polyakov said. Although the Cruz's dispute to the equality of the vote result in the age restriction, shekker said everything was proper. 83% of the people voted in favor of banning everyone under 55 and everyone had the opportunity to vote he said. If you have a child before the effective date, the child is grandfathers and checkers said, any child coming in later by birth or any other reason can not live here permanently, period. The Cruz is called a station, the situation, and the station ridiculous. Both grandma's live here, there are sitters, so the baby will be here anyway said, Daniel, file clerk for law firm, who hopes to get his bachelor's degree in Information Technology in October. This was our little paradise because it was affordable, has everything we want, and look at the beautiful view of the lake in golf course at Elizabeth Cruz, a student at a local fire college, and a unit coordinator at Pemberpine's hospital. Did you know we had a fire college? No, I did not. Well, now you do. Elizabeth said she'd been told several times by doctors that she couldn't get pregnant at megan's my little miracle. The couple's looking for another home while I try to sell theirs in case they lose. We put it on the market two weeks ago already. We had nine calls, Daniel said, but everyone's under 55 and everybody's got kids. Well guess what? It was about three months of unpaid maternity leave, but she's going back to work six weeks early because they'll need the money to move. Shector said the condo association got no choice, but to force the family out. We're not commandos. We're not doing anything to try to hurt them. We're just enforcing the rules and prove my own, as you said, if we make one exception left to do it for all. You are commandos. You asshole. You're a commando and you're a fricking asshole.

Speaking of killings, US based al-Qaeda agents may attempt it to subways of New York and other cities with a lethal nerve gas by independence day. A federal source in Washington told the New York Post yesterday. State and local law officials around the country were warned by the feds about the possibility of a new, of a subway attack allegedly intended to bring America to its knees and independence day. Said a new report by Philadelphia TV station KYW, which obtained the internal warning. NYPD sources said they were warned too weeks ago about the potential of attack by July 4th. But city cops have been on guard for a subway attack ever since 9.11. The NYPD and the transit authority beat up patrols and tightened security. It made your subway stops or terrorists could do the most damage. The transit authority could not be reached for comment from New York Post.

At a special service of healing and forgiveness yesterday the leader of the Long Island Catholics said there were no excuses or justifications for sexual abuse by a priest but that the so-called American sexual revolution with all its permissiveness has certainly been a factor. As he stood on the altar of St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Center, Bishop William Murphy vowed never again the criminal be carell of trust and destruction of innocence of a child. However, he emphasized that the sinfulness of the human condition can at times overwhelm the best efforts in the total commitment of even all of us striving together. Similar masses which included special prayer songs and petitions were held yesterday throughout the diocese for victims of sex abuse in their families with more than half of the Long Island population that had been in fact in themselves as Catholic Rockville Center's the nation's sixth largest diocese. Recalling how Catholics responded to terrorist attacks of 9.11 Murphy said now we face another reflection of tragedy of huge proportions that a struck at the heart of the church and her life. He said the church needs to honestly face the problem, correct what is wrong and through penance, pardon and forgiveness we start the church to its true purpose. Making money. Only half the cathedral was filled for the 1030 AM mass which was televised live on the IC's cable channel celebrating the mass with Murphy was Munseni Robert Brennan, the new vicar general of the diocese. During his homily Murphy repeatedly said only a few priests were involved in abuse just like what Blutcher said on CNN yesterday I wanted to puk. What a suckhold you are wolf, you're a piece of crap. While saying there would be no excuses in no justification for at Murphy's cities, sought to explain how the church got in self into this state. The sinful condition of humanity is certainly at the base of this tragedy, more than three decades of the so-called American sexual revolution with all its permissiveness has certainly been a factor. A false sense of freedom and on healthy and sinful desire for self- gratification are all part of the problem he said. At the end of the surface his Murphy greeted personer's outside the cathedral, most wished him well and said they would pray for him however one tall metilage woman her face taught with anger confronted him. Your timing was off she said both my brothers were molested by priest before the sexual revolution the woman told Murphy before walking off. She declined to identify herself in an interview afterward but said she had traveled from another perisc specifically to hear Murphy. His talk was watered down it was mostly excuses she said what did the sexual revolution have to do with it people didn't go around molesting boys because of the sexual revolution. Other priesters offered little reaction to Murphy's mention of the sexual revolution and said he hit the right tone with his address which was applauded usually after unusual after homoia that's conclusion. They like this tone. This is exactly what we need to ask for forgiveness from victims and victims families to say there will be no more tolerance to this said NASA District Attorney Dennis Dylan regularly attends the 10 30 a.m. Dylan's office is investigating how the IC's handle abuse complaints praise Murphy saying he made significant changes he's been a positive influence during the crisis it's about time to acknowledge all the rumors and go to the pulpit ask for God's help they need help said I'm a great a church usher he and his wife will write a left a service. How do you like that? I see as they left I thought maybe they like walked out I guess not.

Let's hear it good old Abu Zubhata always liked him. Okay, is that's one of the few we can pronounce the name And this is an asshole who was like working on putting together a suitcase bomb a radioactive bomb in a suitcase and that he was gonna unleash on Washington DC I like it when they call it a dirty bomb. Yeah, a dirty bomb a radiological bomb a suitcase I don't know how you want to call it. He doesn't have all the same legal rights. He does have the rights of a of a prisoner of war Yeah, well, that's fry is ass anyway. Okay, right just fry is ass. Give him a quick trial Oh You're gonna like this oh In fact, we're gonna hold rest of the story. We should probably mention yes Troy showed up with our food Why should we mention that because it's good and it's great and it's here and now we're all happy here Oh, thanks, Troy get out of there. Is he there? No, he came in left But to support a guy up and down inside ways that the food was delivered. Oh, I believe him. I believe because there are too many things missing their QM If he tuned in late, we have an inquisition going on now to try to understand and figure out and put together the pieces of the puzzle How come the program logs all disappeared and everybody's mail was all school and over the weekend and and the black Sex for George and the Beast disappeared So there's a major imposition going on right now making the most recent acquisition the Moahawan inquisition Pinnon went significance Speaking of inquisitions if I can get the story eventually from newsday Citizens armed with shotguns will patrol the streets of the heavily Jewish Brooklyn neighborhoods because of comments is suspected terrorists made about targeting them a rabbi said Jews with guns, baby The patrols that begin June 16th are in response to comments Abdul Rothman Yasin made to bring in everyone CBS 60 minutes June the tooth said rabbi Yaka of Lloyd found her in present of the right wing Jewish defense group Yasin who is sought by the FBI in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing said in an interview from a compound in Iraq that he and his accomplices originally targeted heavily Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn Boy They later decided to attack the twin towers because they believe most of the rock depends were Jewish as and said six people were killed And more than a thousand injured in the night. This is the 93 bombing. We're talking about the largest segment of the population in the Burrow Park and southern flat-boosh neighborhoods is Hasidic and Orthodox Jews there are 297 dogs in the area Hasidic Just bite your tongue. I'm trying to Lloyd said the street patrols will include 50 to 200 people of various religious faiths mainly Jews carrying shotguns in bags along with people licensed to one and carry other types of firearms Others will carry bats Pipes cell phones and walkie talkies and will patrol the streets daily from 9 pm to 3am except Friday, of course, the Jewish Sabbath Of course, and certainly not on your kipper This will be a very effective determine against terrorism directed at American Jews another targets Lloyd said The rabbi criticized the police department for not adequately protecting neighborhoods and said the only people of US is vigilantes already look at us that way anyway It is illegal to carry an exposed shotgun on city streets in your police department spokeswoman Valerie St. Rose said she said it was unclear whether carrying one in a bag is illegal Maybe that can do that in sunrise They can carry a piece in their bag I think they may already have a piece of that in there well monitor the patrols if there needs to be police action taken it'll be taken sets of same rows who declined to say how many offices routinely patrol the neighborhoods a community leader from Williamsburg another heavily Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn City of poses The are patrols the Jewish community condemns such a thing We don't need it. We can't have civilians running around with guns. It's gonna look like they root here said Isaac Abraham What a great name that is a Isaac Abraham The Jewish defense group is a group of men and women who are proud to be Jews and committed to defending Demonstrating and rallying for Jewish causes and against anti-Semitism according to its website The JDG founded by Lloyd and Queens in 1985 says it follows the principles of the lay rabbi America honey founder of the JDL. Oy in January, JDL Chairman, Erf Rubin and a group member were charged with conspiring to blow up a mosque And the office of an Arab American congressman in California Rubin and his co-definite Earl Krugel pleaded innocent as scheduled on trial October 1 That's rural no relation to potato Krugel Hello, you do like potato cool. Don't you have any more that yes? We love potato cool on this show. I'll tell you that right now and home and talk So let me ask you now aren't you glad you didn't go ordering a bunch of fatening food that truck came by with your sack. I knew he'd come through I knew he'd come well better come through I'll tell you that guess who writes a peon posture like the New York Post even though it's real for more It's interesting to me my two favorite papers are the Toronto Sun and the New York Post and they're both politically very right wing But they're both great papers and that interesting I guess not I don't care about a new's papers politics if I want to read the opinions I'll listen to my own. How do you like that? Murdoch is a funny character because he's an asshole. Yeah, but he puts on good programming He puts on good very ultra liberal cutting edge programming and his politics are all ultra wide with all I do notice like I said a couple of ways ago Fox news has moderated quite a bit and As long as you view what like I said is a bunch of cartoon characters and you don't take it too seriously at least it's entertaining It's sure a lot more entertaining than CNN. Oh, CNN just absolutely blows and the sea will blitzkrieg on our yesterday with a story on the priest And he is his panel including that wouldn't benefit it. What you bet it is they're like their house more or less done there top a crap And that the closing toward the end of the piece wolf blitzkrieg says well, of course We want to make sure we emphasize it's only a very very tiny tiny just a handful of priests and the overwhelming majority of them are good upstand Yeah, right you should live so long you idiot you you pandering suckhole God, why hates CNN In fact, I'm gonna go on the other room and watch MSMBC right now You know if I had more time left doing the show from Toronto this year and for next year What I'm gonna do is I'll get the digital cable in all the rooms here Because I don't I don't have MSNBC on this is just a regular cable Okay, that's that's the only reason I want CNN is because I don't have a Fox news or MSNBC in here So we got this crap, Bodge area so it is not a nuclear explosion. Good. Thank God for that Guess who writes this thing? I'm gonna read Nick Mark Furman one of our favorite people Skakele family dump Michael he writes in the New York post yesterday Michael Skakele's family and their lawyers abandoned him. They threw him away They didn't have compassion or love for the convicted killer of Martha Moxley He would just someone who could turn his to family name They victimized Michael and in doing so they created the most most of the evidence that convicted him On the day Martha Moxley's body was found Ethel Kennedy was overheard saying this can't touch the Kennedy's That's as it all right there They don't care about the child they want to cover it up because it's just another dirty little secret They'd rather hide kind of like the Catholic church And last time I checked aren't they? I'm sorry First Michael was sent away to the Elon treatment center in Maine Then the family told people at Elana confirmed Michael about Martha's murder that was incredibly self-serving What they were trying to do is find out how much you remembered and what he would say and this is not his father rushed and senior This is attorneys Because Michael was confronted about Martha's murder other kids at Elana knew about it Which encouraged Michael to talk about it? He talked about it with his roommates when things were quiet. He talked about it with friends Then pathologist Henry Lee started making overtures about whether there was any DNA in the Moxley case Again the Skickle family responded with we can't have anything touched the family So they heard the investigative firm Sutton associates They didn't do this to help Michael either to make excuses for evidence that Henry Lee might find They had Michael changes story from I came home at 1120 went to sleep and woke up at nine the next morning to a most incredible story They actually had Michael go back out into the community Peep and Martha's window climate tree yell out Martha's name feel something evil in the darkness He went to all places where Martha was beaten killed or hidden very very crafty attorney stuff But at backfire they sharpened themselves in the foot Now we have Michael's cake. I'll put himself at the crime scene and every place that Martha was struck murderer hidden without it out Michael's cake will in the Skickle family convicted the Kennedy cousin The state did not convict him Michael's cake. I was supposed to be somebody's son and instead his family abandoned him because of his name Because they wanted to protect it and now all the people actually caused the cover up our free Someone should go after the parents the attorneys and the neighbors these people actually ruined this man's life He probably would have gotten two years in a secure hospital facility He might have gotten help. He might have done something with his life. How do you like that? Right Mark Furman and today yesterday's New York Post grew him anyway Not Furman, Skickle. Oh, I agree But the point he makes about the Kennedy cover up. That's the most important thing. Same old tired crap Very sad speaking of politics to 162 votes on our pool about our president Hey, how do you rate president bush and it's administration so far? How do you like the job there? Do you want? 262 votes 116 say he's a bosom and a disaster That's 44.2% of this very perspicacious audience if I say so myself 53 say he's doing excellent job 50 say okay 27 said fair and 16 said poor So if you take the city you got like 50% who say he's doing like your crappy job and then you got the the other 50% who say how can that be? Oh, I see fair work County fair and I'm out whatever And I got a nice back there for my close friend Bob Eisenberg. He said by the way my week still looks like a dead musk grant That's what it's in right to bottom of the facts But he said thank goodness.

It's nice out there baby. Oh 79 today At least 300 church abuse suits have been filed since news day At least 300 I've got so much church stuff here. It's got to make you want to get on your hands and ease and look for wafer's At least 300 civil lawsuits alleging clerical sex abuse have been filed in 16 states in January When the case of a pedophile priest in Boston spur claims against Roman Catholic Dicees across America a nation might review by the APS found Lawyer said the rush of litigation is truly dramatic for such a short time and that several hundred more cases Several hundred more are being informally mediated between Dicees and accusers That ensures American bishops will remain under enormous legal and financial pressure from the scandal even after they overhaul their abuse policy and that meeting In Dallas starting this Thursday It's off the charts Said patched shilts a Minnesota turn used defended Dicees against hundreds of abuse claims Daniel Holden attorney for Orange County, California Dicees said would take a couple of years for their cases of loan to be resolved and more will certainly be filed in the coming months Oh, but it's just a couple of bad. Yeah, right. That's what will blitzkrieg would have you believe just a couple of bad apples New York attorney Michael doubts that he was still preparing about 60 molestation claims against Dicees in his area Chicago Cardinal Francis George may sell the mansion where the city's arch-pissive to live for more than a century acknowledging some of the proceeds could be used to pay legal fees In abuse cases. I hope on you good Catholics out there feel good about yourself every Sunday when you go and put that money in the collection plate Knowing it's going to pay off people with bribes and hush money and a settle abuse cases because you got a bunch of perverts in their abusing kids Almost 250 the nation's more than 46,000 Roman Catholic priest have been either dismissed from their duties or resign since the scandal began in January I think I have another story here that says it's like 21 now this one says almost 250. I think the numbers 211. Let's be up to date Beyond the toll and loss and of staffing credibility the financial cost of these cases has never been fully calculated estimates of what the churches paid out since the first major scandals broke in the 80s Range from about 300 million to over a billion AP report is across the country interviewed lawyers and reviewed court documents last week The count the number of abuse lawsuits across the nation the telling does not include a handful of cases alleging is countered by lay church workers Dicis and Kentucky face the most lawsuits 122 With more than a third involving claims against one priest to refer to Lewis e Miller who denies any wrongdoing hit that corn sure especially in it Lewis Through other suits alleged abuse by lexington bishop can't record him swath he was a Louisville priest.

I think the testimony of Ms. Rally has given encouragement to folks inside the federal bureaucracy In other words one whistleblower steps up and then all of a sudden everybody wants to blow it Senator Richard Shelby the ranking Republican on the Senate select committee on intelligence said Such failures extended beyond the FBI and CIA to the super secret national security agency and elsewhere Shelby also said the sweeping plan for a new Department of Homeland Security proposed last week by President Post did not effectively address the failures of intelligence gathering on covered so far In a stinging letter to FBI director Robert Mueller rally question is handling of information in accused FBI headquarters of hampering field agents from fully investigating Zacharias, Moussawi the Manifficial's novel even tended to become the 20th hijacker in the attacks Absolutely not it doesn't address the intelligence problems that we have Shelby told us CBS program This is a proposal of Congress's got to look at carefully Graham added. We're gonna have a full discussion on his plan and then we'll come out with a better plan Shelby said the public would be hearing of more instances of FBI and CIA intelligence failures Beyond the FBI spated a connected July memo by an agent in Phoenix concert about at least a man possibly connected to what some have been lot of taking flight lessons to the year August arrest a moussawi minnesota We will and I ended that NSA and other members of the intelligence community Shelby said we're gonna find that there were a lot of missed opportunities and a lot of Who will go back to lack of sharing of information I Do you like that, huh?
