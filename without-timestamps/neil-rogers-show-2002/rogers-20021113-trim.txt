Happy Wednesday at some day at today we do our big new to one our all comedy but you know the sad part of it is until we discovered the bomb. I had this whole pile of stuff I was going to do today. Yeah. And I don't... I don't know if I'm going to get to any of it to be on the wall. We have so much of the important crap going on you know? HomTaLaRe. Oh my god that's a hiding- Pacceptable, it sounds like bin Sharzen. assume it sounds like bin Sharzen. Bobbie, grain FBI some so much is it's for late swallowed that people probably don't know who is it. Aaahh You know, Klein can't tell them or I can. Eh! We had a hide- If Aurora can't have a popcorn okay we'll see. Ok this song he missed was like bin Sharzen omg it sounds like bin Sharisen licking of fire. I'd like no idea. You know, I like him a lot in the hero gym defeating yes, he's good fire-dade pair and he says was why not just like Dayton Allen used to say why not only Boca Brian remembers that Drop in things like that because nobody else understands it Policy toward eight Cubans could cause friction between Haitians and Cubans. Oh, no see appeals court reverses order favoring two gay boy scout leaders They're out again. There's one of the best columns. It's right up my a chance to go air like it It's in the Boston Globe and who cares? Oh, I love that Auguste Chairman's policy remains man only you know who demand? Who do you know blow fish? Funny arrested and organized crime bus. I got like tons of crap here Catholic activist compiling in a database Listing hundreds of accused priests Tony's family problems from you are a show to sopranos Your buddy James Gendolfini. Yeah, he's got problems a few problems and they did just a pile of stuff here, but you know something first We got to take care of business First let's take care before we talk about La Bamba. You know see I'd be depressed I'd be really depressed. I'd probably go in a corner and suck my thumb Which practice makes perfect but I go into a corner just sit there like for the rest of my life If every single thing that I had up my sleeve Just came flirting out. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know because what that would mean is that I have no trusted confidence I couldn't tell anybody anything without having it leak out all over the place like I like a leaky bag Look at the end of that bit VD pressing to me, but at any rate and let me just say that team I'll even know you're listening to any Bruno right now on a way back up to the book on Hershey highway Lots of accidents around again. We're very sorry Horrible thing there in hell and there yesterday which we had a couple of spy reports as it was happening five people died in that deal Yes, and then there's a couple of other nasty crashes today everybody's all backed up over to place But anyway, if you're on your way back up to Vokan Hershey highway mode the fact that a matter is you got nobody In that building who doesn't have a big lip. There is nothing that you can say in fact if I was you Is I'd keep quite accepting outside and even there? I wouldn't be too sure don't think too loud either Don't think out loud because then it'll get right back into us again, too So the thing with Howard Stern and fact I'm I'm excited about that because first of all I know what the content is all completely gonna be about Tag number two Number two at least it'll spice up to show a little bit Faggin exactly Spick What's your name again agadorn? A Hagadorn is what he said but I thought it was agadorn. I think it's agadorn But he don't know house boy. That's easy to remember. Okay. It's the house boy 984 votes on a poll yesterday 994 like I said oh shit wait a minute we get up to a thousand You think? Okay, yeah, so before so before we give it a results from yesterday because I'd like a nice read around even thousand and the reason we didn't go over a thousand Which been do a lot lately is because there was no more factor on there see the moment We put no one it's always good for a couple of extra votes at least and he's also not on today's poll Oh yeah, so let's But we do have the big bomb story which allowed the cause a lot of curiosity interest around town In fact even some of our middle and upper level management people be excited to know the story behind the story And it makes me think that that promo that we promised that we were gonna be playing again I wouldn't be surprised if we still have that around somewhere in the background Like a no you know end of vault of goodies Yeah I don't see any reason why we shouldn't prepare to be playing that again someday soon not today of course Because we agreed for the time being ought to be playing that Well, he also you know on a future CD somewhere sometime I mean it was a rather unsavory move on a part of the people on Fox Sports radio but nevertheless Here's today's poll before we give you the results look at that I thought it just I thought it'd be fresh. Let me click my thing and see if I got to a thousand yet did yours One moment please one moment please no no Yeah, 1 on mine. See all right whole result. Yes today. What's your take on M&M? He's a no-101 putts 312. I like the purple M&M's best 287. You know something I went out yesterday guess what I bought Purple M&Ms you can't buy purple M&M's in general M&M peanut but the small bag you know the little tiny small ones that is only like a handful in there Which is a bad tease how many of those did you buy a small just one okay, so lamentate well no When you may have been right that woman accoled for the end of the show yesterday She may have been a ringer, but boy she sure was an oh she was a lot by the She was a great ringer That's like science fiction arrogance. That's why I couldn't believe it. I liked it though. Yeah. Yeah. It was great a real schmith to stirber I liked the purple M&Ms best 287 and in my bag of peanut M&Ms There was a purple one. I think didn't taste it just like all the other ones pretty good like a food coloring KM M 156. He's a great talent 127 who 107 see no matter who we put on there's always a bunch of say who that? Who that the movie eight mile blows but I like his music eight and his singing blows but the movie's good for So we have a thousand one votes on that pool here's today's poll question before we get into the details of the Vamba story La Bomba that's coming soon on the Mohour David show Coming soon way colostomy second year you Seeing what to these celebrities makes you want a puke in other words. I'll put you turn on your TV Pretty good list. I would say and I did not put probably wall well on there to make you happy We can't put everybody on there not everybody put the course That's an older thing about all the people all right, but whatever we can't make it personally based on your own Personal styling is okay and why is on the styling so we're hey about regas the house boy Larry King isn't on there He's not Moe he just had him on the other day.

It's a lady my head's blowing up OJ Simpson since he's such a big fan of the show We had a spy report about him discussing the show at length the other day. That was a great call.

What are all these calls about? I haven't even said hello yet. Here's a call from bokeh. Hello Hi Neil, how are you okay? I tried to call Moses morning twice and They hung up on me Um, and I just couldn't get through. I was gonna tell him how that year show You saw me starting to get the transition But I guess he's just another arrogant too. Bethesie. Yeah I really don't know. I thought he was trying to get her but I think he stinks and the guy taking the calls in there. I think he's whipped by moa. Oh, he scared everybody scared I'll use you think he's whipped by moa. You don't understand Those people who work with him on at show they behave the way they do as it means of self preservation Because all I gotta do is look at him cross side or ask one wrong question and they're out of there And I'm not exaggerating by that. That's the way that show operates. It's not fair It's just not fair to anybody and you make the show I let them all those shows because of you and this guy just doesn't get it. Thank you. Thank you Now where did this all come from by the way? I guess we're gonna have like four hours. Which is fine with me? Fine with me. I can just show up here. He's morning. I don't have to read anything I can just be Like it's done more than usual. Which is okay with me But the other bomb that he was talking about last week. We find out because again loose lips synchips is He evidently and probably from his days with Westwood one which were they most of him hate him like poison He knows some of the people with Howard Stern show So some of the comedy people either present or past haven't I layer gonna be doing some Rebuttal bits about me in about the house boy and about this show and whoever else that he's pissed off That which is fine bring it on baby and like that's a way bombshell Bring it on and of course we know how tasteful those will be and that's who who gives a crap Because there's no question in my mind what the content is gonna be no big shocks there. Well, okay Maybe we can hear about the fact that some of our people hang out in strip clubs too. Oh my god and smoke dope and smoke the wicked weed You know, so bring it on but it's really something first he's concerning with the Tony Bruno on The network that's opposite us the other sports station Which is really scandalous when you come right down to it since you know how paranoid Greg is about the other sports station First it was the fan anybody remember them no in that now. Of course it slots would air marginal ratings with their fractions But he's first he's concerning with him and promoting their show and how wonderful it is and now he's Concerting with the Howard is not only opposite us, but he's also opposite him. It's the Howard and Howard show So that evidently and the thing I don't understand is why is it taken so long? See if you're gonna drop a bomb. It's like this thing with a rack. Don't keep telling him you're gonna drop the bomb Go when you're in droppin when he leaves the expected That's the way you do it. You don't say hey, it's coming. It's coming You guys better watch out it's coming all the parties all over y'all y'all y'all Yeah, this is a man who's so totally lacking in any kind of humility or sense of humor that it's tragic It's pathetic. It's embarrassing to me And the fact that nobody in that building and believe me I know for a fact that there been a tense maid has been able to sit this guy down and say hey This is this is a radio show These are all radio shows we're here to have some fun to make some money Don't be so up tight about it So who gives a crap if you got a silly look in wing people are gonna listen to your show based on whether you got a nice hair Piece or not in fact they're like this last guy said more people are gonna listen to the show because the highest way to guide a market It's talking about you all the time But you can't do that anymore than you can call him all because the guy's got an ego bigger than the entire universe So pretty soon it'll be the Howard David show with the Howard Stern comedy bits Which of course is a lot easier playing it in somebody else's voice? Doing these things as opposed to saying it himself that way. He's above the free you do understand that. Don't you I see it would be kind of like if we Disassociated ourselves from all of the book of Brian bits of well, you know, we don't know what that was all about you know And that's what a performing Coleman right instead of orchestrating him and enthusiastically playing them over and over again And anyway It's gonna be great here's Hollywood. Hello Hollywood It's the quiet guy again. I guess I see how about Miami hello John Bob, uh-huh. I knew there had to be a reason for all these calls Here's Orlando hello. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. I hope this is interesting to you How do you actually he has to read who's like guy on Fox that used to work in the Miami market does even Scott or somebody I haven't got any idea you always talk about him Steve on Scott what is name I have no idea what is Stuart then Stuart All we're fine Stuart Smith or Stuart somebody on Fox never heard him Shea really shepherds myth yeah I'm quite news Fox right yeah Did you hear the whip up in May on the Jennifer Lopez no I did not Somebody out of sound by the film doing it on the air He's talking about that doing a block party and the Bronx for a homecoming for Jennifer Lopez yeah, and he goes gather interested in They're interested in throwing a blow job for Jennifer Lopez I guess that would be pretty outrageous up there in Orlando wouldn't it On Orange Blosson Trail 5 670 560 what are we doing here all of a sudden? I see all these calls coming in here this morning I guess it's because we're taking calls again. You know it I guess don't you think because when I wanted to me yesterday It wasn't like there were a lot of me know and today all of a sudden here's my any hello Yes, sir Neil Yeah, speaking how are you great my friend J over here. We just basically talked to a yacht we're in here at Miami Bay and it's sort of the water's starting to get choppy So we basically came up with something we've figured that since Lenin's and things His name is Jason's and by the way since Lenin's and things were having a fill We're thinking about getting you a couple of white sheets for for the holidays Yeah, it's a really good we could do okay?

I'd like to know I've left three people off. Yes William Jefferson and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Edward Moore Kennedy Yeah, I really think that they Well, I don't know why don't we just eliminate all the names we got on there since these are celebrities who are on all the time and Just put all of them credit politicians on there. Would that make you happy? That would make me very very happy So you're okay. What we'll do that for you fine In fact, why don't we just put on there? We're not gonna do it or it but why wouldn't we just put on any Democrat? I think that would work with him. There you go. Okay? See, I think he got a little bit upset when we get the end there had Bob Novak Tucker calls in a pap you came in all like back to back Probably could have put James Carvell on there. That wouldn't have been too bad with a bulb the shiny head Just a glare from the from the ball spot gets me but that's the list. Okay, like it or lump it Man, these people are worked up to a frenzy that that's good. That's the way we like it get these bastards So a little bit on the awake side, which is an easy-ness market I am gonna use that jail oyster the worth the planet jail. Who cares how to great story?

You don't remember that? That's not like one of the teenager the greatest the greatest moment in that movie is when The real screamer is sitting at the table with the wig on nothing like having a bad way that keeps looking off to the side It didn't rain. He's sitting there pretending to be mama and The waste looks off of the sign anyway the Jacob comes in and sees him for the first time I guess it's before that moment when the waste's open, but he sees him for the first time and drops the crap Whatever he's carrying on the tray on the floor and starts in that hysterical high pitch laughter Plus the fact he's walking in those in the shoes.

We don't forget our noon to one hour all comedy bits Didn't every Wednesday all stuff. I wonder why it's gonna be today. I think there'll be like a theme to it I don't know I'm thinking about it Earth to planet J. Low who cares right so Renee Graham and a Boston phobias today. Don't forget that J. Low story Oh Tonight Jennifer Lopez will confirm what folks who care about such things have long guessed She's engaged to Ben Affleck Or I guess so I'm gonna play next on next break And engagement is certainly a joyous occasion still I think of it as a private event best shared with close friends family members And the dozen or so co-workers with an earshot will be board-silly by every niggling detail about subsequent wedding planning That's niggling most people even if they could might not feel any to go down such things to Diti die and so you're on ABC's prime time live But then again they aren't intoxicated with these self-importance of being Jennifer Lopez See Lopez thinks this is news we can use There's the threat of war with Iraq and national economies unstable as an anacol smith But hey Jen and Ben are gonna have to go at it. No, we all feel better And hailing the rare error planet J. Low Lopez clearly believes that if it's important to her it must be important to us Pardon me if I pass on this cup of celebrity cool aid Hollywood of course is swollen with people utterly convinced that everything they wear everything they do in frankly Everyone they do means something to the rest of us But Lopez is taken or mighty me is in the such extent that she makes her exploits friend the musical scavenger formerly known as pop daddy Seems shy and retreating Let's think about this for a minute low pez is going on TV to announce among other things that she's engaged again And will soon be married again for those keeping score. This will be low pez's third marriage. It's the first for aflac First there was a year-long union with model Ojani no way in 1997 Then she hooked up with backup dancer Chris Judd in 2000 Shortly after the high profile bust up of her high profile publicity snout relationship with Sean puffed at EP Diti coms Her marriage to Judd was barely longer than the honeymoon and now she's sporting a golf ball size pink diamond engagement ring Even before a second of horse will become final in January In the future will all be married to J. Low for 15 minutes Low pez 32 is lagging behind Liz Taylor already is on husband number five Virtured Burton by her 30 second birthday It even if Lopez eventually collects as many husbands what she won't do is build a career as worthy as Taylor's Say what she will about Taylor but she has two Oscars and such films is father of the bride who's afraid of Virginia wolf a place in the sun and Cat on a hot tin roof on a resume despite her personal foibles Taylor and her prime was a wonderful actress on the other hand Lopez has such fair as the mediocre angelize and this year's floppy unwatchable enough She hasn't had a hit since the modestly successful Julia Roberts knock off the wedding planner Oh, there was a minute there early in her career after Selena out of sight when it seemed as if Lopez could become a solid actress But that was before she fancier to self a singer before glossy holly a hollow celebrity became an easier practice Success than the grit and effort of creating lasting art. She's a better photo spread than the actress or singer She's a new queen of style over substance Madonna has held the title long enough and besides there's always been something annoyingly compelling about Madonna Even it was just watching the wheels turn as she can cock to the other way to shock her way to headlines Plus Madonna has had at least have it as in songs that are undeniable classics At this point, I probably are more people to know low pez's dating than if seen any of her films or could hum one of her Want a one little songs she imagines herself as all purpose star the around the way brick a boricua from the Bronx What is barricua? Does that look that when up from the Bronx should be tooling around her old cow her old castle the neighborhood would soier And the unstoppable double threat who was the first before Eminem repeated the fetus week To simultaneously have both the number one film and album in the country But is anything other than a celebrity Lopez seems as flimsy as that famously low-cub Versati Dreci wore a few years ago into the Grammys on her new single Jenny from the block low pez sings in her trademark high school talent show warble Don't be fooled by the rocks. I'm I got him still. I'm still Jenny from the block used to have him a little now I have a lot no matter where I go I know where I came from Now if someone can only persuade her to go back I Really Right for negrim and the Boston vote What is that word the word is b-o-r-i-c-u-a And all purpose star the around the way barricua from the Bronx Barack you a I have never seen that word in my life.

Yeah It says I were wondering when I was the hopper I'm trying to do my best to promote the goddamn radio station and then a court Carlos Or the holiday was on yesterday Well, how come we didn't know he was going to be on yesterday and certainly what assuming Beyond yesterday since they were doing a show from the heat arena as it said on my sheet here Which is not called a heater windy American Airlines arena whatever the hell of this You think it would say so on a schedule to the same so not that I want a nitpick clearance But you better get your schedule straight now mister because you sure don't know your goddamn Schedules but thanks for getting a check in the mail That's all I care about as long as the check keeps coming see See some of you assholes out there like mo who take everything so seriously because you got a big fat ego I don't have any ego I've been working in this market for over 26 years going on 27 And I learned a long time ago you can't have any ego working in South Florida. It's a it's a thankless hopeless thing But if you get a big bad paycheck every couple of ways just take it to the bank now What all the other bull crap you can't eat ego you know Do you see the episode at the agriculture department with an asshole in that van? No, I didn't well this asshole. He was arrested. He's in custody now. He wanted to see a president And he had this van this budget rent of Anne and claimed that he had explosives in it. They searched it never in our explosives was right by the agriculture department in Washington DC But he's in custody now and everything is okay Here's the fact that says is the calling calling you ginger Rogers the best he can do pretty lame It is pretty lame not only that but ginger Rogers like I said the other day it took us Weeks to figure out what the link was talking about with that ginger, but now he's completed the thing which ginger Rogers so we can be sure Another old fossil kind of like mo do you think that most people listen to his show know who ginger Rogers was? No You think most people on the page of a hundred member ginger Rogers? Oh, predestined all any those people but that's okay That's fine with me And this is one of the same people was so outraged and indignant about my So called racist stuff in the name of stick Remember that comment several months ago, which I'm sure we all do and yet in the meantime he and guilty in all the other Sexist on a radio station including 70% of the men in the country with his business about our custom the masters again Oh, it's just a bunch of these bulldogs a bunch of these damn feminist rods that try to get in our way Let men be with men all of that stuff, you know, so on a one hand here's all the homophobic crap But on the other hand, let's have men be with men Hmm 56 05 60 sounds good to me. I don't know how I'm speaking of that last night's mallville pretty disappointing. Oh Oh, I gosh talk about depressa should be awarding the I'm surprised that survived that show last night That was so goddamn depressing it was almost as depressing as least blown a free not the lead in last night third period ever when and over time For one of their rare wins That's what happens when he get all those old path to rejects pat All those rejects Trevor kid Tommy Fitzgerald all these other, you know, Anders Erickson who's cool them as heels and saying John All the old misfits But anyway the show is so goddamn morbid and depressing at least at the end they could have brought us on they would have been very corny even corny Or than the ending would little kid dying, but at least so maybe Clark saved his life. You know, he got this this Nero surgeon and he got him off the plane at the last second and he went through any perform emergency surgery and a kid still died But what kind of an ending is that? So I don't deprive it's not it's not it's not uplifting a show supposed to be uplifting usually the end of the show It's always corny but at least there's some feel good in spite of all the trauma and all the horror and the Growth test stuff that happens during the hour including the 85 minutes of commercial did you notice that the last commercial break Must have lasted about 75 minutes. I kept I was watching the leaf game. I'm watching the weather for today I was to watch 15 other things that I come in are still an egg. I died then commercial break I'll tell you somebody there at the WV's making a few bucks off of that guy damn show Man, but it was a morbid and depressing and I and in fact I was silly press. I shut it off right after I didn't even see the preview for next week Did you no no the image See to do press I'm not a watch to but I forgot because we don't want more bit on a smallville Okay, we don't want more bit. We want feel good. We want feel this feel that maybe like a shake-liners hand will be at least a start You know, he can't he can't put his arm around or give her a peck on a cheek or something that sounds like that But at least it'll like shake her hand shake it a little bit Clark Once you decide that she's gonna stick around in town even though mom and step that are moving to metropolis How long is it gonna be before him and the lex start getting hostile with each other? I'm sure it's gonna be a big season premier or something because I've said it those two are getting tighter and tighter and tighter And the fact that neither one of them seems to have a real female interest in us How Lexington a girlfriend that's good point and Clark sir is how he can't even like like I said there was Chloe Well, I don't know close. He's to busy with the computer and then there's Lana who he likes a lot, but look But don't touch that kind of thing. Maybe he's super sterile He's only like 20, you know give him some time Here's a four-lotterdale hello. Hey Neil. How you doing pretty good? You've created monster nobody will be a how-in-one.

Hello Fort Lauderdale yes, sir. Oh, yes, I am oh Neil. Yes, yes. I'm here poppin o park riding around every morning listening to your show And I just felt like I had to call you one day and Express my opinion about Howard David But I do enjoy your show and since you go to poppin all the time, I felt like I should call also It's a release on the backstreet. I'm on the backstreet riding around so you're on the back side Yeah, riding so I'm making me take a little the other day and I'm so sorry Yeah, right, but anyway, I did want to express my opinion about Howard David because go ahead I don't have any problem with him as far as you do with taking you know with backstiving it's work But I just felt like from the first that he came on he was an embarrassment in that he was just so brazen and so You know arrogant Yeah, yeah, I mean it was just it was almost embarrassing to me and just very Very difficult to listen to and after listening to to just the forest and the other and the other show I felt was so much better. I really missed just as far as I wish I could bring him back Yeah, but I'm just surprised that So many people don't feel this way that there would be a lot of pressure to get rid of him I just think he should be he belongs in the yard And I don't want to get rid of my me clean the last week that business about I've been trying to undermine his show since today He got it that's a lie number one and number two I'm not I don't try to get anybody can unlike him who has gotten not only several people can't I'll be sure but also try to get George fire just one of his first acts and then see he's one of those people who want to Air will put on a good act for you and pretend he's above doing all of these things You know behind the scenes tries to get everybody canned and throws a tantrum like a crazy old man That's what bugs me about him if you if you're you want to get him fired come on here and at least pass up to it Okay, instead of doing all the stabbing behind the scene I imagine happened my complaints I just don't think he does a good job I just think you know It in comparison after listening to Jeff the far swirl that time and then the personalities are just so much different Jeff the far start of personality is a great sense of humor. Yeah, I do guys just so you know it's just like a Very hard in brazen and and that that that was my complaint about And I got a good well his show basically boils down to the world according to Mo and Mo Right, it all you know when it speaks it's that story in tone that says when I tell you something that's the way it is Right, I could just picture that as a ghost I forget first name that Yeldo I think he just he must be a question his teeth for a long time with him I just picture that he doesn't like working with him and he just had to you know Suck up to him but what are you here? I did that you hear how high that voice got so you know He's got him by somewhere All right, they pal said I got to run and say I'm gonna read that the far back say how to wall the energy Thanks, okay, well, how's it going?

I had to problem with this guy isn't this is why we have the worst management in history broadcasting in this radio station See if you deal with somebody who knows where to draw the line knows the difference between Stick and strike and back in a clever comeback, but ever and somebody who goes way way over and beyond You can't just sit somebody down in front of a microphone and assume that they have the right to be there or the responsibility Be see what I'm saying what are you saying I'm seeing we have bad bad Management is what I'm saying and we do Did I hear back from our general manager by the way that I was supposed to hear from yesterday? No Just to kind of get delay of the land and the checkout. Oh, who's naughty and nice now? Crossbrings hello Yes, sir. Hey, you know what thing I killed me? You had this like 15 year old call a referring to a defending mobile five or six callers ago You know, he's a chronic I would you tell you calls with saying I'm out please wrong station wrong He's one of those chronic little Julios just an O-jam provacator Hey, the guy who called up earlier if you wasn't such a twin you might have been able to explain the Shepherd Smith box thing a little bit because it was kind of interesting Yeah, well, I took that guy about five minutes to get the name out first of all right Hey, did you ever see the movie American history X? No, I think George had that is seen is a scene in it where I Guess the other the white skin head, you know, the flag guy breaking into his car made him put his open his mouth and put his mouth on the car And then he jumped on the back of his head and I guess that's called a curb job in the Bronx With Jalo was from and they were talking Shepherd Smith is not talking about a block party for Jalo and Applek and he said something to you Congratulations sure the folks in the Bronx at this point would rather give Jalo a curb job than a blow job. I mean, oh, I'm sorry about that slip. I mean a block party Although I will say this it wouldn't surprise me if he does have a penis. I'm pretty sure she does Hey, Mo Howard I tell you before before he got involved in all this crap and you know You listen to the Monday night football games and I when I'm up in New York and listen to the jet He was as good as it gets as it is as a pro football Right that's right. I'm like yeah, he is so good I was so I was like okay I'm not a Dalton's man but different than a damn good job But in cat and what the hell they expected to talk show host and I enjoyed listening them on the air he's just such a such a no-stage Humorless punch right I can't even listen to the dolphin game anymore just knowing that what's behind that voice And he said what he was making a such a big deal about the bomb the other day I'm gonna drop the bomb I thought it was gonna be one of these Brian Cox things with some massive lawsuit or something It was making up to be a big deal You're gonna do comment first Let me just say this to you if you're gonna sue the people that you're working for anybody on radio station You're not gonna be working in the business ever again, right? So anybody who does that I guess is planning on early retirement Yeah, I had no idea what to expect with this guy And so so the deal is for anybody who turned in late He's evidently through his contacts with Westwood one who also can't have by the way You know got some folks up there work on how it's during show either present or past and they're gonna be doing some comeback You know attack comedy bits on me and on George in this show But which is fine again all depending all depending on where the line is right there's a difference between Not in somebody's a wig in your vera cosvince There's a difference between that and trying to destroy somebody's career Yeah, he doesn't he obviously doesn't know the difference yeah, he's not he's got a long way to go for You destroy yours or anyone else's career Hey, let the quick question I'll let you go Well, what would a circumstance is why would he so bent on firing George and out of that you know when you got Oh, I was up here back in I don't know April I guess April or May and one afternoon I walk into my and I got a really nice studio here. It's in one of the bedrooms in my apartment and I walk in and on a fax machine There was like some fax is sitting on it was about three in the afternoon And I looked at them and there were some emails that somebody down there I don't want to mention names head intersected They were emails from listeners to Howard and they were like cost if they were you know I know it's from the same bunch of little group balls that you know that call us the little humans or whatever And then we were funny. They were very funny. They were about a half a dozen of them So I had the idea where they came from so next morning. I read him on the air evidently He heard them and just went into a psychotic Hemorrhage and for days on end was demanding that George be fired and threatened to walk out and and so I come in a couple of days later And here's a message from our general manager on my answering machine on my voicemail Congratulations on a great book kneeling by the way I've decided to terminate George Rodriguez So when you're laughing but George who did whose wife had just shortly before I had that second baby I mean here's a guy that's got a family who's worked with me. I show for a 10 or 11 years and He was gonna get cans and so I had to go through a hernia and all kinds of his stereo For weeks for weeks on end to say the guys job our program director went into like kind of a rubber room for a couple of months Had to take time off because of all the stress and the pressure this man and just a few months has created more division and More psychosis in that building than anybody all the other people have seen put together in 26 years Yeah, I've been listening to you for a long time and I mean since 87 I've never heard like them. I mean there's always been some humor's banter back and forth But you know it's one thing not to like some of the people you work for But to go on your way to try to get people fired because of some childish pranker just because you've got a giant ego and you're gonna throw your way to run and That was just the first way he was trying to interfere with his show and he hasn't thought since it certainly doesn't sound like it's under the guys No, it's your ain't I don't think I've been right to the debate How do you like that huh? Maybe he was right when he said that yesterday Remember he was commenting at the end of the show about well, what did I gotta talk about today the same thing like that? And maybe that's what he would like it's your a lot of good pre-publicity, well show all-more all day Hello too much you're in trouble Didn't take their crap in Pearl Harbor or when the japs dropped their bombs We bummed them back crap and now the sun is they hit us hard and on our hearts are little blacks As that's all you love and retired voice of bombers the wrong way time fine Uh You In the garden we will say What's a few thousand innocent lives Stop living in the mess If you want that SUV to drive You're gonna need more gas It's the greatest country in the world They train us too And anyone who says that obviously And afford to be What word did you say? At Valentarius to be in America Where we date three odds in please Way the flagged with hast with our hand in the sand And blindly follow the powers that we have a sad tick A f***ing stings for you Who's on a six-star by the screen Scratch your balls and five everything's okay In the garden you will say Don't let America Welcome back now What couple of interesting fangs is here you notice? I did Anyway, I guess I'll save this one I got so much good stuff here today I thought I wanted to talk about his mobile mobile mobile mobile You know the mobile here at the mobile Don't understand it. I can understand it But anyway, this I got to mention From the same p times A congressional committee wants to know whether politics are behind the delay Of a federal order to the state employees pension fund This is the state of Florida Governor Jeb Bush's administration asked for it Because of recent staff changes a spokeswoman said yesterday Not to avoid damaging his reelection effort But Iowa Senator Charles Grassley The top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee Isn't so sure He has asked for an investigation into whether health and human services Inspector General Janet Rengwist Delayed the audit to avoid possible embarrassment to Bush Who was in a spirit reelection fight Or so he thought Grassley said to day the audit delays Just one part of a federal inquiry in the weather rank list Daughter of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Achieve Justice William Rengwist Oh my god Has improperly infused politics into administrative duties You see the way this is all tied together Gee what a shocker Bush spokeswoman Elizabeth her said the governor staff requested delay because the director of the state agency that oversees pension funds was about to retire It was appropriate that we had it delay her said Grassley asked the GA Oh to look at a Rengwist operation in October after knowing that she made 19 senior level staff changes in HHS Grassley called that number exceptionally high And talking with the whistleblowers from HHS grassley learned a suspicions that Rengwist had delay the flowed audit To avoid the possibility of damaging Bush's re-election campaign These allegations are very serious They accused the inspected general of a faded performer duties independently I'm looking into these allegations to try to determine their accuracy Grassley said in the statement yesterday He asked the GA Oh the investigative armor of Congress to determine whether the HHS staff changes Or wrote to the office's mission to root out waste fraud and abuse in federal health care programs Grassley author of a federal whistleblower protection statute An advocate of aggressive fraud investigation Judy Holsey spoke swimming for Rengwist said HHS employees triggered the audit If I raise in questions about the size of federal payments to the Florida pension fund How do you like that huh? Because we sure don't want to embarrass the gebstir And show that all that money was being invested in Enron when everybody else had been getting out and they were still buying back in on the way down How do you like that? With pension money. But at any rate You know, I also will come about it. They'll break a lot of it like everything else because it's the Teflon family Miami coach arrested on battery charge fan injured But the good news is it's not Miami of Florida. Isn't that the good news? That's good news Miami of Ohio defensive coup ended a coordinated John Wafford was released on bond early today After being arrested for allegedly assaulting a fan was celebrating Marshall's last second win Robert A. Flogger, Flogger was among thousands of Marshall fans who stormed the field moments after Stan Hill scored from a yard out with five seconds But to give the thundering herd the thundering herd you turn a 3634 victory Tuesday night Wafford allegedly shoved flower who hit his head on the artificial turf It was taken on the stretch of the hospital.

Meiner How do you like that more problems at the University of Miami or Ohio? How do you like some apples huh? Shame on him This is pretty interesting about Minnesota shame, but we got to take a lot of these great calls don't you think? Absolutely, they've been great. They have been pretty interesting along with the usual a few assholes, which is good We like to mix it up a little bit, okay? Three or four real calls and ask what and I do that online the seven Carlos that I've heard Why do you do that? Because that's not just don't be let don't pay any attention to George, okay? Don't pay any attention to what George tells you because George has been too busy playing at the you know made the house made But the house boy or girl whatever it was and La Cajra folds He probably thought it was some weekend calling in Five six seven oh five city probably was and pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line If we get our big noon to one hour today one a boat equal one Don't start with that spik talk again, okay that woman will she never called back to them really upset about that Now, you know, with later on in the show, maybe she doesn't get around there, you know, or maybe they didn't put her up to the call until later on in the show Are we been getting plenty of ringers lately, have you noticed that? Yeah, have I noticed. Here's Miramar hello. Yes, I have to think that Mr. David is great. Yeah, and you suck. Okay, thank you. I'm thanks for listening to the speaker and ringers. Yeah, five six seven oh five city and you suck but he's listening to the show see how many years have I been telling you that? If I suck why I and I do suck by the way pretty good, but why would you be listening to the show? See that that's the kind of people he's got coming to his defenses that little punk hole you'll be for I'm out that one and then this guy he's great and you suck. Maybe that was his houseboy. Flavius. And his brother biggest five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. See, I don't really know. Yeah, maybe this in the long run will be great for this radio station. Maybe we'll get an 80 share. But regardless, I mean, all the crap that we had to go through with your alleged firing and with a bullet in the head and all this other stuff and then the stuff on the website, which was very suspicious the timing, et cetera, and our friends at Fox News. You're starting to put all these pieces together, sure. Can't go the way. I have a bomb of my own. Then I go to explode right after you live in a clock break that even you don't know about. How do you like that? All right, can't wait. I have my own bombs because the timing of all of this seems real interesting to me. Speaking of trying to dick around with other people's livelihoods and careers. Just wait, and I even I wasn't aware of this until just a few days ago. I'll wait to hear this. All right. Other bomb. What is it? I'm not telling you to lack of news. I don't want to wait after the news. Okay. He'd be to be to be to be. And how the news from QIM? What a joke. I still can't get over what we're working for. I don't remember when Hank started working on our station, but I'm what is this station. But I would turn on a station. I would hear the top of the hour coming instead of like newscast, even like a news capsule. Yeah. It sports updates. Well, and I would say to myself, what is that? I mean, like, in other words, this is the only thing that's going on in the world. There are ideas of news is like somebody has a strange growing muscle with a dolphin. This is news. It's not the only thing going on, but it's the only thing that matters. Oh, I forgot. Well, I've learned that in these five years. Here's my me, Lake. Hello. Good morning, Neil. When is this? I love those news that you love in a clock. Let me answer a question. Boca Brian will be with Georgia Treasure Island today. Yes. Yeah. Well, you only have to see these there. Yes. I'll see. I'll see. But if you want to get one, you got to rub his bald spot. Another thing. Just one, you know, when most of the games with, with managed. You think, and when I listen to the games on radio religiously, no matter what, do you think managed gets upset with him when he makes all those mistakes? I don't know because in all fairness, I can't, I don't listen to the games on a radio. I heard, I heard, usually the feed up here, I don't get it. You know, I was on this Sunday night, but I was watching on TV. So I have a listen to an up of it. I've had, you know, we've had some people calling in saying he's not letting mad dog do his own thing and be himself. But for me to comment on that would be pointless because I don't listen to the game. Right. I know when he's up when he makes some mistakes, managed is fighting his tongue because I can hear it then. I can hear him biting his tongue and he's a blood spreading. I can hear the blood spreading. I can hear the steam coming out of his ears. Just one more thing. I call you yesterday about the, the Augusta golf course, a men man, man, want to be with men man. Whatever being a man. You know what I'm saying? We're still looking for it. Are you still looking for it? No, I mean, I think so. We'll find it. Okay. Thanks. When you say that, play it. I'll play it. I'll play with it. Don't forget, men want to be with men, so they can play with it. What's wrong with that? Yes, you know, that's the whole thing about that geek club that makes it so accurate. What a joke. And then, of course, 70% of the men on these polls say that, yes, Augusta has every right to exclude women. Now, see, isn't that interesting? Especially at the time when I'm accused of being a racist, that you're not too many years ago, blacks were excluded from membership at Augusta National. And then they finally let one guy in here and now we got tiger woods. And we got, what else? The lead elder and, you know, some other pretty good black golfers. As if golf is all that important, which it's not. But if the same people who are saying now that women should be excluded were saying that black should be excluded or Jewish should be excluded, Oh my god, we're talking bigotry. We're getting on a goddamn website. We're calling Fox News. See what I'm saying? Yes, and. Yellow boys, those are balls. Exactly. Now you're talking. I got your thumb on it, Mo. What are they saying, Mo? We're supposed to be a five six. You a yeah. Only in the banana republic baby. Only in Miami. Fox News has a real weirdy like your f**k dude. A real weirdy like your f**k dude. A real weirdy like your f**k dude. You're weirdy like your f**k dude. You're applying looking matches and the perfect little Nazi. I want you to feel their coffee through your soil paintings. This notting you, still be sluggish sweet. Lapping your lips like an emperor's roast beef. Fox News and the real is like your f**k dude. Oh, here's a bulletin, they racked to approve the UN resolution. Oh man. Fox News and the real is like your f**k dude. We're easy like the f**k dude. You're everything on your catalysis. To the child. You want to know shit. Three wait. You're really going to be. You're all going to be. You're all going to be. Then listen, think, roast, put the green or something. I'm fed in taste like bubble gum. See you next time you need a story. Since it takes a dip, bubble to make you come. Fox News has a whole world. We'd really like to f**k you. Oh yeah. Fox News has a whole world. We'd really like to f**k you. All right. Let it over to a 560 WCM happy wins. Do do it next hour. That thing noon to one hour. All bits to the whole hour. And I'm going to get mad. I'm going to be with a request for that. By the way, for what? Sofakink. Oh. Well, he's always been the sofa king. In our place. Something like that. He always wore the crown. For how is my f**k he doing? He's doing fine. This is a good tipper today. Well, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad he's holding up well under the stress under the dress. He does wear it nice and do rest, by the way. Ever seen it? No. Like pink shuffin with lace. He's okay. My book that moth. He's the only hope we got in that place. I'm serious about that. You know me. I'm not an assucker. And especially in his case, he might type. But the fact of the matter is he's the only one. It's like got a clue. I mean, Clarency means well. And he gets me my checks on time. Oh. Or close to what I would go on Clarence. Better late than never. But the fact of the matter is moth is our only. He's our only buffer between insanity and a place. And, of course, the head cheesed there. He's busy. I'm making people wait for half an hour on a phone to see if he can muster the courage to take their phone call. You have a normal call in the other day. Made a way 24 minutes on hold before he takes the phone call. And then we wind up with a three way. Me and Norma and Greg on the phone. Only because the Norma and sister. Yeah, three way. There you go. There you go. There's a material for you. Greg Reed, Norma Kent and Ginger Rogers with a three way. And then it was on the phone with a little phone six. And by the beat, but about yeah. And then that's the end of it. That was two days ago. Is there any follow up? Oh, I get a response. What the hell is going on? Oh, not at all. So it's one more good reason for me to be here. And away from that insane asylum from that not house. So what is the man? This is a man who acts like he's in suspended animation. Kind of like Larry King. Oh, see, waiting here my store. I'm Joneson. But two are. But first here's the poll results. See, I know how to tease it. And it's a, you'll be shocked. You'll be even more shocked than I was when I heard this thing. See, which of these celebrities makes you most want to pukes. Our poll question that I on the arangers.com. Rosie O'Donne looks like she's pulling away. And you know something. If I had to do it again, I would vote for her because I mean, as much as. I almost said with an F as much as Tucker Carlson. You got to be very careful where you be saying that as much as he just an noise me. It's not just that he's a right winger because there's plenty of right wingers on here. But just that he's such a pretty silly ass would add bow tie, you know. People with bow ties, even like the former Illinois senator Paul Simon was a liberal Democrat just to show that I don't care about politics that much. He made me nauseous. He was a silly goose. Only silly people were bow ties. When you were great. Absolutely like dominant. Dominic done another silly guy with eyebrows to make Andy Runejose. Seriously, I think he stole some of Andy's eyebrow here and paste it on. Everybody's got those nifty glasses. Oh man. And I'll tell you another one guy that's got goofy glasses. You know, Senator Carl Levin from Michigan. No. Oh yeah, you do. The balding is balding. Oh yeah. I know. And he wears the glass. He's got a you know that Juno's. I'm sorry. He wears his glasses down and like the, like the, I'm taking my glasses and put them down like the pinching me at a tip of my nose. Pitching my tip like granny style. You've seen that. Have you? Because he appears on all the talk and head shows all the time. Senator Carl Levin is a good guy. Never stole a freight train. I like him. But why do you put your, what is the bush, myster? He's message is very seriously. And we will. We're taking seriously here at home. You're right to approve you. I'm resolution. How do you know. I think it's already. It's that okay. In fact, today's only Wednesday that deadline was Friday. It's okay. You just don't drop the bomb. You're just being brought by continuing. What do you say about a broad? We'll chase these people now. One at a time. You know, that's pretty interesting. And here's it's now what 14 months later. It'll somehow we find this still alive and making threats. He doesn't want to happy all president take the rune. He looks very disbonded because now it kind of puts into the lay. It screwed up all his plans. Remember like a Tessio said, right. Can't go either selling. I screwed up all my plans. Tell my cow was like them. It wasn't personal with business. So when are we getting back speaking of business? So I got a call. Are you going to interrupt this? Nope. I did. I did. In fact, I'm trying to think about it was about two months ago because I was up here. And one of those movie channels I'm always telling you about late one night. They showed that again like how's your full. And a really bad friend of it too was like, I mean, but I just couldn't turn it off. It was like Godfather was like deliverance. Some of those movies when you see him on there, you just you get glued and you can't turn it off. So I watched the whole thing in this entirety. And when they got to that scene. Where she's sitting there with a bad wig on, you know, and the thing with the soup and the whole deal and Jacob just loses it. I start laughing so hard. I made myself sick. I made myself physically because I couldn't stop laughing. At any rate, this is no laughing matter. Here's our bomb. We ought to have like a new feature on a show. Yeah, we got like tabloid Tuesday and we got all bits Wednesday between noon and one. We ought to have the bomb of the day. When a bomb of grande. So a Norma can't my just I mean, nor was it nice guy. Let me make that clear up front. Okay, but lose cannon. Loose cannon. And he also didn't bother call me back yesterday. Probably than have anything news to report. But you know, another one is just a week kind of like a feather wave. So during the course of a conversation with him a couple of weeks ago. And keep in mind the timing of this. Right. Couple of weeks ago, he tells me almost as an afterthought. And he likes to do this. He likes to meet with certain people in the business about my career and my welfare without telling me. Which quite frankly, that's not the way I like to do business. And I've told him that, but he's just one of those people you can control. He's a loose cannon who also thinks he's a radio broadcaster and a baseball player. He thinks he's a lot of things. He's a good guy and a professional fag and that's pretty much it. But at any rate, so almost as an afterthought, he tells me that he had a meeting. Then a gentleman who's one of the higher upper echelon programming people at a certain company flew down to meeting him in for a lot of day. Not too long ago. About a month ago. Can I get interested in? Are you going to interrupt again? Nope. You know, you houseboys are easy to come by your time. It doesn't. Although I do like those palm palms. But were those things that he was always flashing around? Jacob. I don't know. 100 years ago. Those feathered things. But anyway, now what the hell was I saying? You keep interrupting God. Damn it. This is an important thing. Why? Why? Someone from pointing. I've been down and met Norma in for a lot of day to meet discussing syndicating this show. Premier? No. Okay. I have more guesses. But I won't. Well, guess again. Infinity. No. Get me closer. Keep going. Cox. How about Westwood 1? See, that was the last one on the list. Okay. All right. How do you like that? Now see, I'm not interested in the first place because I'm not interested at this stage of my life. I would like to be on national. I could have been, you know, if I would have happened 10 years ago, I could have been. I don't care what anybody says. I could have been a real major player on the national scene. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Because I say crap that other people don't dare to say. And I'm, you know, I'm one of those people that don't give a crap. I fling it out. If it's in my brain, I fling it out. But the fact that it matter is, I mean, Norm has been greatly, basically incompetent. And of course, Greg, well, other company wants to help syndicate me. I'll show this, I'm going on for four or five years. They have no interest in syndicating the show. Because that's basically something that would benefit me. And as far as they're concerned, whatever revenue they'd get as small potatoes. I'm just, I'm on a way out. I'm counting the days till I retire. Not today's to start building a new career. You follow what I'm saying? Yeah. In other words, Walder, Kronkide isn't looking away. It's to start a new career at age of 90. And now it age is 60. I'm not looking either. But at any rate, so this guy come down because OP and Anthony just got a lot of money. I've got to have blown out as we all know a couple of months ago. But that sucks in the church pit. So they're looking for various people to fill in various parts on their stations all around a country, which they've got about 8 million of, you know, just like cloudy channel. Right. So how do you like them, apples, huh? I like them. And then surely on the heels of this, surely on the heels of this, all of these other things started. You follow what I'm saying? Yeah. Coincidence. All of these other things started. Now, of course, if I once worked for that company and even almost to the people that may have hated me like poison, I certainly would have some people on the inside. You follow what I'm saying? Oh, yeah. No question. At least one or two. And of course, what better way to put the permanent nicks on any chances of that happening? I'm not, I'm not making any make an accusations of just again thinking out loud. Think it out loud. Then to try to demean and disgrace and debase on whatever else to try to make it seem that I'm the bigoted, the fact whatever to hell I am, you know, which is okay. And again, I'm just thinking out loud. But the timing of it is all very suspect, you know, just like the timing of, um, you've been held hostage on the very day of that comment about anybody saying the things that I do on the right of the guys of stick in any other market probably get a bullet in the head. And the response from our management and the returning to that was instead of saying, that's that's unconscionable at any of our people would say that. Or plant that in a mind of anybody in the audience instead of saying that they can turn around and say to us, well, you know, an exchange for an exchange for not firing George. How about Lee and off the old man. And I did just one more step that I took to try to protect the house boy. And it was a bad mistake. We should have said, what kind of a deal is that? We've already agreed you're not going to can that little stick. What kind of a thing? What kind of responses that? And I'll tell you what it is. It's ear responsible. Just like the comment itself. The stuff that's being said under the guys of stick in any other market would get this guy a bullet in the head. Right at that point somebody should have intervened somebody who's like an suspended animation somebody who's just frozen and paralyzed and can never act who pretends to be a general manager. But basically is the guy with a bad haircut and a expensive suit. Did he do it? No. So how do you like that? I like when you think we're starting on Westwood 1. Tomorrow? 12 minutes after 11 at 5.60 WCW. I am Thanksgiving. Everybody's going to be flocking home to be home together again with friends and family strangers. Gathered around the table with delicious homemade food and family traditions. After all, it's not the turkey that makes the meal special. It's the people and the stuffing. Getting ready for the hungry guests can be stressful especially if they're staying overnight. If you're having a hospital for Thanksgiving, my dialometres make you how they preparations a little bit easier. Now is the time to call. 1-800 mattress and get that new mattress in for the house guests get there. If they've already told you they're coming or if you don't hear from them till the night before they get there, dialometres can deliver a top quality service. See these symptoms are Kingcrum mattress the very same day. I've been sleeping on a dialometres for years and let me tell you they're the best. Call dialometres right now. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. I'm going to call dialometres. And beat that jader me. Goats. Goats are real. They exist. They're all around us. Some believe. I've communicated with goats. Helping may be explained. People who believe in goats are only projecting their own desires. They're due goats truly live in all in the mind. But was that? What was what? No. A motion to train and will change your perception of goats. Forever. Sixty. Shining. A ship probably. A full. A pound of goats. Goats. Goats. Goats. It's 11.18. I want to make sure it was done. At 5.60 WQA, I'm so how does that to bomb strike you, huh? I'm strict. In addition to watch the individual, I have no idea what the guy's name is or who he is. But he's, I would only use the work in his market. And it's a big fan of this show. So what's like just some idle chatter was preceded by a couple of phone calls. The guy took the trouble of flying all the way down to Fort Lauderdale. Let me with Norma. And you want to reason I'm saying about this on the years because I'm not interested anyway. I wasn't interested when I heard about it. And probably should have been discussed with me before this meeting took place. But nevertheless, that's not how Norma works. He's got his own little agenda going on the side. See what I'm saying? Yes. But is that interesting the timing all about it? And it was Westwood once. How do you like that, huh? Speaking of that, venture reportedly near Deal for MSNBC Talkshow. The cable news channel MSNBC is close to signing Governor Jesse Ventures at Talkshow host after he leaves Orphus early next year the Walshby Eurnal is reported at the board. Are they desperate or what? Yeah. At MSNBC they can't buy an audience. If they gave people a hundred bucks a minute to watch, they still can buy an audience. Oh, I still, I don't care what anybody says. I like two to four. I like Bill Press and Papua Kinnon. Even if I can't stand Papua Kinnon's politics. It's a good show. And even though they're a little rough around the edges as far not mean really broadcasters. Does that make any difference anymore? No. Signing people for making it with a situation that journal said in B.C. News President of the Eul Shepiro. Uh-oh. Shepiro. In MSNBC President Eric Sourensen. Uh-oh. Have been wooing venture by the Zagians at the William Morris Agency Morris. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Are there anybody left in this country is not Jewish? No. Except the Puerto Ricans. Of course. Already a regular on MSNBC political program hardball venture. Probably would be scheduled for prime time. Maybe the 7 p.m. Slot occupied by Phil Donahue, the journal reported. Well, I hate to break the nose to the journal, but Phil Donahue's on it. So maybe they're on central time, but I think it will also be your almost published in New York on Eastern time. Then amazing. Well, what is this from? Where is this from? Somebody, which I appreciate getting this, but it's uh, the Star Tribune. Where the hell is that? Uh-oh. Some freaking news paper that I can't get their info right. Well, I see probably a Zam at Western newspaper, which it would be set on a clock there. Okay, we're sorry. The interest, both of John Woodell said yesterday in the last night, the only the governor will not make any announcements about his private life to leave his office in January. MSNBC executives could not be reached for combat last night. And believe me, I believe it. He quit his radio show. He already announced that yesterday, which I didn't have time to get to that story. Quit that. And he's paving away from being a TV star. And maybe he'll like Don some of the wrestling garments in the middle of the show. Right. Tankton to a little number on there. I love this story from Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Authorities in West Virginia charged a nude Bible reader with indecent exposure to the 49-year-old woman has also been charged with disturbance of school and disorderly conduct. Police say Barbara Harrison's clothes were an opiled beside her as she read from the Bible on the steps of a building at Shepherd College on Monday. A police statement says there were people standing all over and there were classes going on. The woman didn't say why she dropped her clothing. Earlier in the day, campus police told her she couldn't preach unless she got permission from the school student affairs department. Maybe she was trying to have some student affairs. Maybe that was it. So she took off her clothes. I guess that's a good way to get the attention. Sure. If you try to convert the flock. Right. Right. Something to do with flock. Seeing what to these celebrities makes you most want to puke. Rosie 101. Big fat disgusting. East Lady Rosie. Hundred Monvotes. OJ 82. He's right on her ass. Don't getcha. OPPER 33. Papuken 33. Rose Ann Bart 28. And quoted 26. Eminem 16. Tucker Carlson with the silly bow tied 12. Madonna and Yine. Bob Novak 4. And Jerry Lilaz has got three. He's going to got three. Of course we don't see him that much anymore. Except for someone. He got a real big screen. He can't see the whole head. That was bad. When I pan. No. I don't think it was bad because I don't feel sorry for him. I don't like to see anybody with physical infirmities. Anybody with bad health. But in his case. I'll make this. This is his first option. Can't stand him. Here's Daytona Beach, hello. I knew a good morning to you. A couple quick, unrelated comments. But I have to say some about the soul-multhing. Come on. You know, it's so interesting. But where does manager play? Doesn't anybody sit down to hey guys enough? There's enough or we need to do something here. They should sit back and let things happen as they come along here. I'm the one who suggested the meeting. And Louis and Abrunks. And I think going to happen. That's crazy. Well, I think it's un-unrelated note. This whole thing was the lot in the table and all this. It's interesting. Bush wants to go to Iraq and do all the kind of damage. And here is the lot and still out there floating around. And nothing. We just continue doing the same all day. And the worst part of the whole deal is now in his new message. The recorded message that Al Jazeera played the other day. Now, I've been alive in the same that he's the first bomb that's dropped on Iraq. It's going to stimulate him. And if we do invade Iraq, if we do start La Bomba. All we're going to do is give him an excuse to start his graph up again. I think I'm going to pack my bag and go back to Cuba. Okay, so here. Take care, buddy. I'll stick him over to you. He's going back to Cuba. You want to know why? Why? Because the hotel's there. All right, big guy. And we're going to. It's way better. Oh, life as part of the godfather. That's what I had some kind of a mafia thing in here today that I was going to play to godfather music behind. And since I never even got to my pile, see, I feel a little bit bad about this. You were teasing something about Tony soprano or something. No, no, that wasn't the one. There it is. I'm fumbling around to find a guy there and think I got a really good pile of stuff. But I don't know. I don't think the audience wants to hear all that stuff. Gotta give him what they want, baby. What they want is whatever we're doing, which I don't know what it is. One of your arrested and organized crime bust in New York. I know it's shocking that they could be organized crime in New York. But that's what it says in New York. And alleged captain of the banana organized crime families in 19th of the arrested and connection with a multi-million dollar loan sharking and gambling operation he Manhattan D.A. announced yesterday. Patrick D. Filippo, the repeated couple of the D. Filippo crew would charge again with enterprise corruption, a felony punishable of the 25 years in prison.

Scone his mother who indicted on Lester charges including assisting the criminal enterprise purgaging contempt, 7-Hetton V. Robert and Morgan Thill. Patrick D. Filippo crew ran three separate gambling rings that brought in about a hundred grand each month. The associated loan-shirking operation at hundreds of thousands of dollars on the streets at Margotel and took in more than a million dollars in prison for you. But that's so small to you, not. What am I getting this frog back again? You are sure I hope I'm not hurting to get a drip. Good little bit of a frog. I don't like that. I've been feeling funky lately. Yeah, I don't see the weather. Of course you're there and I'm here right. It's starting to turn a little bit. You know what the high here is going to be on Saturday. It's going to be sunny and the high is going to be eight.

And this show is Sunday. The show features Billy Bean. It's a gay show. The only gay radio show in the market. It's on the, um, uh, ninety three point one. One, one. How is it? Seven twenty five PM. I'm assuming PM. I don't know. Is it PM? I don't know. Probably AM. AM. Don't most of the public affairs show don't that isn't that a Sunday morning thing. Five would assume say, yeah. That's a good point. I could have put a fact. Sure one seven twenty five in evening. Somebody might be awake. That close to prime time. Seven twenty five. AM. I'm assuming I'm not going to be on the show because I don't go on other radio stations. Okay. Don't make appearances on other radio stations. Markey or murky or whatever your name is. And I'm sure normal will because he's on a station that isn't heard by anyone anyway. Kind of like Bill or Riley. But the where were you doing for in and let's see, he wants to come and watch the show. No. No. And, uh, how come Norma can't give him like a, uh, primer and radio. The broadcasting expert. He's to busy having, uh, meetings with, uh, unauthorized meetings with all sorts of hot shots and then he's patting himself on a seat. I'm getting you on an ashto. I'm doing this. I'm doing that. Yeah. Right. Whatever you say, Norma. And he's going to say, oh, you shouldn't have talked about on the area of a ride. You think that there was any chance in hell after the last couple of weeks that that was going to go through anyway, even assuming I want to do it. No. No. But I try Norma. You get an A for effort and a Z for results. I wonder who's there in 12. Yeah. That couldn't be Norma could it. I see Carl was just talking. Oh, we got a crank hole you want here that we got to get rid of real quick. Hello. All right. Downs for life. Yes, say it is. That's him. Who's who's him? That's the other iron shaft socks and everything sucks. Everything we talk about sucks and balance. I don't really know, but I bet you anything. It's Norma online 12. Hello. 725 AM. Yeah. And you don't have to promote his show. You can do it on his own. Yeah. I don't promote other than yours. I don't promote any other radio shows in a market. I don't play that game. And he has no business using my name to get in good with you. I don't want to start getting into one of these fags. Knits here on a radio. You know, this is a very high paid radio show. I thought like yours. That's just a cash cow to get you a few extra bucks. Then nobody listens to. Well, in the end of the day, I'm murdered by you. I know that occasionally people will actually hear what I have to say on the air. And it wasn't bad enough that I didn't hear about this guy from Westwood. One until already after the fact that your client visten meetings, which I wasn't interested in anyway, which I told you and you. Sure. We do. Yeah. We do. I already just got through talking about it on here. If you were listening to the show, I was listening, but you have to give your agent the latitude to answer the negotiations in the private quarters of power without a minute. You know, something you and Mo would get along great because you're both legends in your own minds. No, absolutely not. He's the one that's dropping bombs on you, not me. Yeah. Unacceptable behavior by him. That was followed by as you know, National News releases. Yeah. And we're still waiting for the General Managers response. Oh, and I knew that because what I didn't hear from yesterday that what they message to me was that he never called you back like he promised he would. That's that's our general manager. And you know where he probably is right now is probably hiding under his desk. When the phone didn't bring, I knew the call was not from him. Exactly. All right. Can you have a great day? So where does that leave us? It leaves us as the target of a fascist news network sniper is where it leaves us. You were not talking about them today. You better get with it. Okay. That's old news. That's last week's news. You better get updated a little bit, Mr. I'll hear my death. Okay. Yeah. We're kind of looking out the window and see if the son is shiny. Get out of here. Boys, does she something or what? And you notice he didn't call to discuss any of that with me. Call to discuss that fag show. You know, it's one thing to be a fag, nor I'm believing I know all about it. I'm an expert. But when it comes to being a professional fag, it's just, I don't know. It's kind of like being a professional fag, you know what I'm saying? And I know my good friend Lynn Lynn sandals is probably listening to right now and I love her dearly, but she's a professional fag hag. Which is her, you know, she's entitled to be that. But you know, it's a tool is Taylor Rich. You ever see Lynn and Liz Taylor together? No, no, they mentioned all I will say this that Matt's rudge is she's looking a little bit more like Liz Taylor every day, Miss Grudge. I just got a few pounds to put on and he's working on it. 118 votes for Rosie speaking of putting pounds on. Oh, nobody wants to see her in that cottage. She's yeast is her is which is probably under her armpits, too, and between La Caja folds. And she never even murdered anybody. Can you, oh, and I got good news for you, by the way. Yeah. I had a call yesterday. Let me give you 14 guesses who was from. Norm. No. No. I would just hit him on there. No, I didn't have no call from him because he's got no news. Because he's got about as much clout with Greg Reed as you got as it was for. Yeah, let's put on. And I'm not exaggerating. He has exactly the same clout with him. By the way, do you get your new contract yet? No, but there was a voice mail from Norm saying to call him after the show today. How do you like that? Well, you better make damn sure we've got that thing and writing it about twenty-six years on it. Because he is so goddamn slow on getting this man to move and I realize it's very difficult even to get to get to get to return your phone call because he's the busy hiding under his desk asking the water not see if the coast is clear and it's safe to come out yet. And the answer by the way, Greg is no, the coast is not clear and it's safe to come out yet. You silly clown you. I'm telling you, what, what a great thing it would be to be born into a lot of money. You know, huh, huh, huh, where to marry you a lot of money or to just marry into it. Or to be able to deny a bunch of people who think that the radio broadcasters didn't like your agignus and then and then just keep falling into a bucket of crap. Every time you turn around, follow it, oh, I'll just follow another bucket of crap again. Look at this, I'm instant process crap. So you got a phone call from Rimmer. No, no, not from Rimmer. I give up. Fat Rich. Oh, how's he doing? He's doing great. Good. That's a good news. Any of fat riches friends out there, we've been worried about him because he was like blowing up like a, uh, yeah, I didn't talk about it all those months. I was we were concerned Derek and I were very concerned. We go to the track and meet him and they were like practically had a carry him in on a stretcher, but he's doing great now. Good. And come to find out that he was accumulating all this water in his stomach, which he told me they take a needle of a syringe and they like, suck it out. Yeah, when it that suck it out. That's my model. But at any rate, that's what he said that he's doing a lot better and all his swelling has gone down. He looks swell as what he said. Nice. God, Richie. See if the track's still in baby. Aren't you happy to hear from the static? No, that's excellent news. He never has anything negative to say about you. No, I love that, Rich. Quite practically. He's about the only person I know. Doesn't have anything negative to say about you. Even your mom? No, she hates you all the she. Yeah, that your friend is getting better. But she still thinks you're a pervert. Oh, yeah. Well, what a giveaway. And let's see who else? Well, so I know that, uh, on a course, Rimmer, who never listens when you're on, except he's got a log every ball of the area. And he's out of town anyways and Philadelphia. They probably listen on the internet. Probably monitoring right now. Let me tell you about something that you can pop right into your mouth. No, not that. I'm talking about all your med.

Why do you must have sneaked it in here when I was away that summer? I had no idea that was in it. You have any idea that's what my all-time favorites. No I don't have any idea I was listening to that in high school. And I was listening to that before you were born Frank. I was a surprise that before I was born. Exactly. There's a reminder of favorites. I was like you know doing a little surfing on the DCS to get some ideas for stuff to play in that next hour. And I see Bobby Brown and Frank Zappa and I said you got to be Schmidt and Meamister. Oh it was we didn't have bits as you know in those days. Frank Zappa was as close as we could get to fall. Oh how come nobody ever told me it was in there? I could have played that 100 times. I didn't probably had a 45 year. You've never learned that you like Frank Zappa. Oh you got to be kidding. No. Chuck you're never sure that you've ever been in the name. I can't stand the names of his kids. Well not even do easel. Not even moon unic. Not even Ahmed. Ahmed. Anyway, a rather unsavory move. I keep out his very jackass. Our column in front of me here won't go away. I keep putting it up to the side and it keeps like moving back over right in front of me here. 560 50 50 50 50 50 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Who might take some requests for that new to one hour? The all comedy bit Wednesday are. Well we have to. Which is one. Well that's coming just relax. I'm way ahead of you. Okay. I got it. I might play Bobby Ron again four or five times. Got her. Love that. I love it. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey. Good morning, Neil. Yes sir. As of on Ohio last week and that was surprised you went back up to Canada as cold as this. Cool. That's wrong. Well after the election I don't blame you. I think this is a nice place to visit. But if you can stay to hell out of here it'd be great. First of all, it was record breaking hot temperatures. Every day that I was there was like 90, 80, every single day. Record breaking heat and humidity. Which I hate like poison. I was there for a month. It was so depressing. I wanted to blow my brains up. And so it's going to be cold up here. Big deal. So you put an extra coat on and it's like a real place. Yeah. Cool weather's nice to visit. You know what? I get to listen to Bob and Tom every day. Great. At day I have a song called Dear Puneus that will make you pee in your pants from laughter. I don't think you put it. What do you mean? Yeah. We'll make you have it. Yeah. Oh, I'd never. I don't think I ever heard you play from them. Mostly it's prison bitch. Would you help people war that out? Okay. Great. Wait a minute. What is that under George? Because I don't have it. My DCS. Do you have it there? Oh, no. It's called a letter to my video. That's it. Okay. And I want to And it's coming up and it's coming up right after the break. Okay. And my favorite mohower did. I think the funny one is the open Anthony one. Yeah. Let's come and two. And mohower reminds me of Wayne without the money. That's what he reminds me of. Wayne without Wayne. I think it without the money. Okay. And overbearing. Mark. See you. Good to hear you. Bye. Load it in my penis. Right? And that's something I just got through playing that a couple of days ago. How about that? Amazing. So his psychic powers kick in. There's one suggestion for us, which is going to be on. And also the is so freaking. And what else did the mohhrana here, condolisa? 567. Oh, 560. I mean, you have 560 on the AT&T. Everybody loves that condolisa, but okay. Don't think of it as no trash about it. Everybody loves it. We can't stop singing it in a shower. On the bus on the tram in the T-Rome, kind of lead the give me a break. Okay. Are you humorless right wing assholes? Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. The go and all right. Yes, sir. I just wanted to know. I see how you thought about when the not in sound up that message. You think that had me sublimin a message to the sleeping shelf that he has looked enough? I can understand a word this guy's saying. Say it again. Good. Do you think that? What did he say? He's talking about Osama and asking stupid question. Get out of here. Okay. Get back on up an animal. Can we talk to some people who are speaking with square crissakes? Get back on up an animal. Get out of here. Before it's too late. God. Oh, here's breaking news from Moscow. Wait a minute. We do know that we had a briefing today with the deputy farm. Oh, get out of here. Like, like, everything is breaking news. Breaking news. I rather be breaking dishes over this Brought's head breaking news. So hyper. If everybody all worked up into a bar frenzy over nothing. Just to try to get somebody to tune into that crap to see if Larry's suspenders are still holding up. Here's coconut creek. Hello. Hey, Neil. How's it going? All right. Hey, could you help me out with something? I was out of town for the stupid elections. But about that smoking ban. Do you think about that? Yeah, past. Yeah. Is that going to be like, can I go to a barn now and not think like smoke or what that is? Is it everywhere? Everywhere. You can't smoke outside in your house in the backyard. And you basically on the attic in the ceiling. And anywhere else either you get the electric chair to bring their cranking it up again. When does that start the first of the year? What I guess I mean, first, you know, I realize what you're saying you'd want to be stuck up. But the fact is in a tourist area. I mean, can you imagine Vegas them saying, well, we're going to make it a no smoking town. I understand. I was just curious what the laws work. I got some smoking buddies and like if we go out to a bar, can they smoke or not? All the paint. It all depends on what they're smoking. Like if they're smoking with their smoking in the coffee, shut houses and Amsterdam, that's okay. Okay. Good. If you want to do 10 to 20. All right. That's good. Good luck, you pal. Roll up. I heard. Go roll it up and he'll ever good time. Roll up a big fat one in the goddamn sun, Sentinel. In fact, uh, start lighting right where time jick is hit is there. Little timey jick. I'll say it again. And you notice how he just ignores this totally now. Yeah. He's pouting like a little child. And I even admitted being the big man that I am and admitting that many times I'm full of crap. I gave him my best shot. I liked all those bedtime stories and you guys lie a lot and say that you did. I was riveted. What do you even like? I got lied a lot and said he liked that stuff. You know, he lied to his teeth. That's big. But the fact that a matter is that's not what the audience wants to hear. Some fat old duck fag reading a bunch of very important and interesting and sometimes humorous and they don't want to hear that. They want to hear this. Whatever this is, that's what they want. And I'm gonna pay the same either way. And the best part of it is since I've been back up here and even when I was down there, I don't have to sit like hours and hours and hours. Over this computer like a goddamn hot stove or something. You know, who now needs that? If you're up in the morning, I look on see what's in the Sun Sentinel. I hear all that check out the major, you know, you will say today and news day and the times and a few other. And that's it. And that's it. And Lynn Samuel's of course. My close personal professional, uh, what does she Fag heck queen? Don't be knocking Lynn Samuel's. Okay. She's okay. And I'll tell you if you knock her again. She's gonna sit, uh, Matt, uh, grudge on you. And the last thing you want is to have him all over your ass. Believe me. Now what was I just saying before that? Something about something about Tom Jick and littered in my penis. Something, I think the two of them were connected there. Come on Tom, there's major stuff going on in radio and of course, if you ever bought or somebody would buy Tom Jick or radio and send it to him with the Sun Sentinel, be a wonderful thing you can do for the holidays. Because Tom had a like pawn his last radio because things are getting really tough over there. Especially with them, make it spin on all I'm going to send him to, uh, LA over and over again. So we can get wind and dine and keep writing those boring pieces about the guy they move fault TV shows. Most of which are already canceled by the time it gets back to Tom. But you'll be pleased to know that either yesterday or today, I don't want to check out it again. And the cooking show schedule again. Oh, I was going Tom, you're doing it. There's big major stuff going on in a radio market and he's going, mubble like that just out of spite. When I started to say, was I admit he was right about that. He was wrong about where I do the show from. You don't have anybody calling saying, oh, gee, don't sound the same. He's up there to write. We don't like the tone of the show and you want it or why? Because it doesn't make a god damn good at difference. There was the day that goes by that people don't say, you know something, it sounds like you're right here. Like, you know something, maybe I am right there. How do you like that? Oh, look at this subbed of a big put on. Look at that. There's a goddamn flamingo outside my window or subpidget. In fact, there are more goddamn pigeons in my little patio out there. Put floor to you on. None of your business. Okay. Don't start asking questions. What floor am I in? You want to be addressed? You want to get the no number out on the ear? I guess I know where are you on. I'm way up here. Okay. I'm way up in here. Way up high. If I took a leap, baby, that would have let's splat like a god damn pancake on your ass. Right, just like that. In a way, that place is going to wouldn't surprise me for these days soon. I might just do it when I Greg Reedon charge. What a bosom man. What a what a ninkumpoop. Always talking to this one's agent. He's done. And you're wanting to why he talks to everybody's agent. Because he can't talk to us individually or together like adults. He can't do it. He can't look in a face. And deal with it like an adult. So we have to go behind the scene and talk to this one's lawyer and this one's agent. Because he doesn't have the capacity to sit down and look you straight in a post. Because he's told so much bullcraft. They doesn't have the balls to look you in the face. You follow what I'm trying to say? What are you saying? In other words, when you come right down to what he knows damn well. That the castaways wrote that song about him and all these misrepresentations about this billboard for this and this contract for this one. Yeah, right. Give me another pile of crap, Greg. Okay.
