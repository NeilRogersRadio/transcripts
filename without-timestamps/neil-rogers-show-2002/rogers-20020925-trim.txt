and ocasions until you match complaining best I know okay with with a new secondary which basically you have um... how was it take for guys coming together and these are experienced people but still a number one there's today's stock market we do experts fear the new york stock exchange could open lower again today after depends decay index closed down one and a half percent on japanese investor fears that american investors fear a drop in u.s. consumer confidence because of fears that the economy may be in danger because of fears of stock market investors who fear an interest rate hike mean while in america there's fear that those in japan who fear the fear of american investors could produce fear in other sectors of the economy which continues showing signs of recovery um... america stands a koreo diasma we'll have more stock market news when something else that's not really happening happens in the heads of people who just happen to be afraid of everything that happens and don't be a fair after you're okay because the market futures are up uh... make a big comeback in it no gonna make a jagan come back plunge in there with both hands that's what i would tell you i'm not doing it but you go ahead so anyway uh... let me just say this right after by a time records an asshole can i get that out of the way right off the van okay see let me just take it this time when you're sitting back there it's your little typewriter and your little desk see everything with him is little the guys about two feet tall it comes up to george's knee can including his brain and when you're sitting back there finally getting your bottom maybe fumbling out some copy see i don't understand how can you be sitting back there writing and if the guy at the asponsues the one that writes it you follow what i'm saying liar basically a liar taught but anyway when you sit back there and belly i can about the fact that well how come he can't do this see if that my job it's not the talent's job to write your copy to do your job in addition which when you're opening up a big mouth and then pd lanyard standing there you know immediately he's got to come skyrocketing down a hallway open up the door and tell us everything that you just said because that's the way it works at q a m we have our moles remember when Greg was looking for the mole and discovered we had like six hundred of them even on weekend piggy lee put together are in the class with us we got more god damn moles then you ever seen so if you want to sit back there belly it can envision about the fact that somebody's trying to get you to do your job and give us something to work with on a year that's too freaking bad taught okay because we all hate you like poison everybody in a building would like to step right on your ass okay even duck would like to step on your ass I think like that taught we're sick and tear to your bullcraft quit belly it can just do your job back there you scumbag you little jewel and by the way happy circus so anyway oh and what else got me a little worked up this morning i'm sitting here mine in my own business you know it's happened out my bedtime stories and i'm listening to a little bit of mow this morning i mean there's nothing like i'm i get a little mow mitten in a morning with mow another way of work yeah we get very little momentum on this station but at any rate so some uh ass sucking collar and is that what i told you about the collar is there much ass suckers the never i said that's what you said suck holes and sickos that's 95% of a call just like that kai yesterday oh yeah quit meeting this bedtime scary takes some calls right so anyway this is schmuck this morning who's an expert on everything in life including radio ratings he's gone out about wow daddlebacked something about ratings and yesterday Neil was slapping about Hank and his big gun the trend came out in a big gun number yet in august and the main time he didn't bother mentioning the fact that Joseph Gaki was on two weeks in august well guess what mr. records in some sure you're listening right now you little punk uh the trend doesn't work that way the ratings don't work like august one to august 31 and in September what the work that way the third week of the trend rather than the last week of the trend dog ended like august 24 or fifth or whatever was the last week when uh Joe was on fill in for Hank that wasn't part of it so maybe he was on for a week but is there anybody out through who really believed that Joseph Gaki is responsible for the numbers going up no in addition to which anybody call up mo i'm not i noticed that nobody has the ball stick to call him and can't front him with his pathetic numbers least i haven't heard it including this little putwacker who's an expert on a rating supposedly he's an expert on ratings just like Todd Rex an expert on copy so if i was slapper in which i thought it was kind of funny the fact that we were all day yesterday what why not give god the humper a little bit of credit it's due and i don't need it's new but we like to see that i'd like to see mo get a number in there you know just for the hell of it just to help us out a little bit just so we just a chance to make it some of that extra bonus money we're in it together in spite of mo's uh sour a psychotic attitude we're all supposed to be in this ball game together but nevertheless there's that we got all the experts out there and that's another example of the callers now we do have the phone fixed i should point that out to you and yesterday's experiment with that phone man that that's set the whole guy damn show back and since we got a short show today because the new new one hours wins day it's uh new to one bit wins day and we apply all comedy bits new to one to give it like a little chance a little relief in there a little blessed relief from all these heavy duty pressing stories all these bedtime stories so we might take a call or two here what do you say now what we have to do is Carlos has to take one and put it on hold like lying to it's ringing right now just put it on hold and then we'll see what it is see just because we want to technically check this out because many bob also known as George Corso one of our in uh several engineers uh yesterday he was that we got a hold of him on a phone and I came in here and I did it with this and did it with that all of a sudden like scorch court almost as much of explosion as a small girl last night which you book are guys both missed and now what just happened to that the guy disappeared he hung up we can't even do an experiment on here on this phone that's uh this audience but you want to want to real call I don't care whether it's real or make believe just one that we can experiment with I realize we're starting from a standing still position now following our great morning show in those big numbers I love that punk to call and it was the expert would Joseph ackey did two weeks in August which is not true he may have done two weeks physically during the month of August but the last one in the last one I got to show up till the next trend so good luck to you Hank you'll need it and if anybody that's that much of an asshole I would suggest that Joseph Gackie Hank Goldberg got big numbers on QAM before it was anybody else getting any numbers on it anybody will tell you that an addition to which he don't need Joseph Gackie to get numbers in fact can you imagine a month they would have had without Joseph Gackie and couple of those marlin games in the afternoon they might have had a 15 year in men schmuck everybody's an expert everybody's a radio expert they're all ratings experts and they don't like to tone of the show and everybody's that's how photo for you that's why it's so pleasant here it's sunny it's 48 degrees can you believe that I believe it go be 68 to sack you know yesterday may have been the most perfect day I've ever seen in my life it was sunny about 72 there was a nice breeze there would know humidity I mean you just walk out there and you feel invigorated everybody's got a smile on their face and it's like a throbbing living and breathing place and down there the like that one guy said the victim just comes spying forth the eventem you can smell it man you can feel it your your hemorrhage your your verico's veins start the thombudian like we hop all over the place you like you're just gonna croak from the you for those stressily psychotic angry people you know it's how it's even getting the me now I'm starting a little whipped up into a frenzy just from taking one or two calls yesterday oh you actually have uh look at that this thing is working pre-mo now baby here's Latterdale by the sea hello new god yes sir I bought dolphin season ticket what happened to him I give up what happened to him he said he bought dolphin season ticket he's still there he's he's back on hold somehow oh don't tell me this thing is screwed up again I didn't touch him I wouldn't tell you that look I think I'm again are you still are you here okay I said I bought season tickets as you're just like couldn't possibly here mo-powered on the radio anywhere really I'd like to whip him like an Irish travel that does are kids I don't know it's good coming you guys talking about Hank's numbers on there and I'm talking about his numbers I don't know but I'd like to know what they are I'm sure they're pathetic and that's a weeky gal they got I don't even go to the uh listen to the lineups at the stadium because you have to hear his voice he's doing a lineup on out of the stadium he's doing something and some p-a did you hang up on it no I never touched a thing in the guy I had my finger near the thing but you don't think that could do it do you no I think it's one ever yeah there's something wrong because whenever I think of all of it yeah I'm Sarah for let's say it for the engineering stuff again if you like boys and girls I would be able to hold over here and yeah hold on hold over there like whatever call you're on when I put any other call on hold it puts your call on hold oh brother I'm gonna tell you our engineering staff on a skill of zero they're like they oh points they just oh points they win a minus column well that's try one or two more okay because then now there was actually pretty good guy right plus it would happen a hell out of mull which we like that a lot because you won't hear that I'm mo-show in fact mo-get all better shape because guilty read some email from some woman in plantation obviously a very astute woman who understands that he still a jet fan or at least that's what she was cleaning and he was like all wounded about that you see you can't have thin skin it's one thing they're very close veins you know when you get to be in your 80s a lot of guys get those but they have thin skin and to be doing a top show can't do it one thing to be sitting there in the isolation of the broadcast booth you know and and and that's Charles L. Moore man what a hypocrite that guy is in Palm Beach ripping mo behind his back off the you know off the newspaper your columns but in the newspaper sucking his ass hey Charlie make up your mind up there in Palm Beach okay I get all of reports I may be up here in Toronto but I get all of reports I got my conduits see I don't I don't even know what to make of this thing now here's Miami hello Neil yes sir George is show is much more entertaining I wish you would go back on the air because you know he talked to his audience Ronic would not be crying low in the whole summer the country very that's the iron chef you are yeah hello and you know President Bush has got to be the stupidest man in the world because he always sounds like he's reading he never sticks to his comments okay thank you we got three great calls to start we jumped to Josh to judge me yesterday and actually those last two they stayed on there until they went away well as long as Carlos doesn't touch anything well don't touch anything Carlos quit you better let's teach him a little bit better don't touch stuff in there because it's Q a m see in a real radio station you could touch stuff and it would work away it's supposed to the way you would anticipate but we're placed just there everything's a little touch you okay so don't touch I'm not touch that's what Miguel always said look but don't touch that's what time my welling says and you guys miss small girl last night man I'm tired there was so much blowing in the first five minutes of that show even Peter North who by the way Peter North is Canadian we discovered at this morning on a website I was checking out because I was looking up to shoot to any other guy that created Superman Canadian boys a and there was a lot of blown from those tornadoes in the beginning and just noise and blowing and gnashing and just incredible and then the previews for next week small buddy but I missed that in fact that's going to be a poll today about small but I haven't even got to yesterday's poll result I'm getting way behind it so for the honor of taking these great calls that one dipsmith that called I thought he's always ripping you that guy he's always ripping me that guy he just missed a contrary whoever's on the air he's going to argue and hate them I see like I said sickos and suck holes and the basic way that's at 98% all of that last part so they're he's pretty good and the first guy was great except he got cut off twice because uh Carlos keeps touching don't touch him okay talk to him just don't touch him that's gonna be difficult the exception will be in Todd Rex case when he comes in don't talk to him touch him like with a baseball bat would be good maybe with a crowbar hey Todd oh idiot little quizling has he been in there you're with his copy no he's probably still back there muddling hey talk to Peter Lenny okay in fact what what we'll do is we'll have Peter come in and talk on the air tell him everything that he said yeah how come this guy's been doing his spot for a line how come he can't do it it's not my job as whole push you don't give us any information to first place you heard about this and you heard about that the same old tired format with all your spots time they suck and the reason they've heard about it so many times is because you all changed the copy you won't give us a damn piece of information

it we'll return to regular programming momentarily on wqn dot com until then here's the best of sports radio five sixty q a m is bobby better to end the hammer hand over on monday august fifth bobby breath of his was in bobby this is the thirty of the anniversary of the undefeated team you were certainly uh... part of that and as you look back on we were talking with edwin poeperoian show who went into the writers wing of the hall of fame last year and uh... another keep a skin resident and uh... and uh... and bobby when you think back on uh... on that team uh... everyone was saying that one of the one thing that's that's striking about it is that uh... we may have seen the last of those guys to go into the hall unless kuchenberg gets in and nick is the only defensive player to go in uh... other other guys you think who are being overlooked from that club oh yeah i think uh... uh... uh... often so i think kuched be one i think uh... undefeated you know it uh... norm evidence was by here two weeks ago and we spent some time together just talking about that team and uh... when you measure it by today's standards is high i mean white high weight speed it doesn't measure up but it was probably all the time i've been in the NFL is probably the closest i've ever seen to what team means those guys uh... with our inspiring shoe and how and all those guys coaching it was a team probably made fewer mistakes and he team i've ever been around and they uh... so individually when you look to a man he for nandis played then full man he was he was great dick Anderson was great they had jake was great say they had so many good players but i don't know if anyone alone would get the recognition to be in the hall of fame i'm not saying that's right but i think it was more of the team should have been put in the hall of fame yeah well i have no name defense was was called that because everybody contributed nobody really stood out when i say that doesn't mean they couldn't play they just all played well together and bob math is something you go up and down the the list of players over there and they did go or do like put he's more popular than ever i didn't know that well now you do and now garden lifewood boards the wreck of the admin fits Gerald and steers a course for disaster in his new tribute album go or do like put sinks lead zeppelin they didn't confuse both of them it's not true one ever he's been confused garden right foot renders his version of lead zeppelin's emagrant song we come from the land of the houses though of the nice and weather of the springs low garden lifewood sinks lead zeppelin it's a whole lot of stuff like this hey mama's in the way to do gonna make you a sweat gonna make you it's the compactest that's lower than the bottom of lakes up here here there's a lady who should all the good and he's calling to find us there way to go if there's a bustle in your CD player don't be alarm now it's just garden lifewood sinks lead zeppelin it's nine eighteen well that takes your end of the roughiness so do you remember that song now no that's the wreck of the admin fits Gerald they but never heard of my life i told i never heard of it anyway he's Canadian a any entoon all i great so speaking of Peter Norris scored scored now this call that you see is like uh... you got cut off that was everybody who was on and you were talking to the back again you got on here okay let's uh you know something we could kill a whole show with you uh you would be today we can just keep cutting you off and then you call back again i think Carlos might be a mole from all that way kept me off i don't know me it could be hey um but anyway what i was saying yeah get a little bit more he said most got a nice back right here he yeah anyway what i was saying people are gonna take advantage of this phone call things just to take sheet peep chat she's got some mole go ahead okay uh anyway all he talks about is how he goes and he's at a restaurant and does this now i think he just does the grubs it up for the free food in the morning or something yeah that's nothing we should all believe in is getting free meals on his show now will you guys deserve it you work hard we pay for it all he does is come and bumped him for out and then blow the whole chemistry i keep watching the q i input to the stadium to watch the managed finally chrome out one day you know uh rumor has it then in fact he was talking this morning about the ratings for the dolphin game in town were so gigantic on tv and that it would indicate to me that nobody was listening to what i'm a radio they all watching on tv yeah i mean you can't stand them you can tell the man is your sour because he goes down the locker room does this to interviews and then pieces out and all moments do us talk about last week about how the jets are realing and and uh man did she look i really don't care about the jet that they're problem let's talk about the dolphins when and basically just come up okay have a great day sir and most thanks you very much call the publicity here's a guy that spent like three different segments of the same call in rip-mo every time you know what i said nice going sir i mean don't do it again but i'm enjoying the calls you know it yeah so far so far no sir like i think uh i don't know it's good to have a working like duff yeah like i got duff came back i mean clarinet is okay he's a little you know he's growing into it but duff is like uh almost a real man well and uh he's you know he's got his thumb on and he said you know wait just in case we needed we should be working and it's almost working to wait should i mean you know if Carlos will stop picking around with stuff in there these people can get on here and say their peace nine hundred three votes in our poor yesterday what should the punishment be for that bitch madden uh gourmet and two good the indiana woman at the Irish uh tinker war caught beating her little girl on tape burn the bitch of the steak on national tv three hundred and twenty three votes that's almost 36 percent burn the bloody bitch on tv get a ninety nine share in fact you know something do what i'm the donny who show okay he needs it would certainly it would piss him off because he's against capital punishment but secondly he probably would say well in this case i'm making a session because of giving me some numbers and when you got like a point one share like old on a huge got you need anything well he is just i feel so bad you know it's like if they try to bring Joe pine back he's been dead for like 40 years and Phil i hit the break the news deal but probation only for the bitch a hundred and the what is it? hundred ninety four that's twenty one and a half percent probation and lost the custody of her children 149 16 and half percent one year in jail 88 no punishment spare the rod and spoiled the child 78 and three years in jail 71 this is my story of the day okay before we take several more great calls i'm enjoying the calls a lot i know that comes as an amazement and you want an awakas they sound good they sound clear and i can hear them don't have to reach down there on the flow and grab that headset i think we're getting there i think at about twenty years we'll have this thing technically figured out and maybe you can even get the station on the air prosecutors says my name be toddler to death because she ate his breakfast sausages you're familiar with the story yeah she ate his breakfast sausages that would do it a prosecutor told a jury yesterday that a man fatally beat his girlfriend's two-year-old daughter for eating his breakfast sausages jewvon ticket 22 i'd sure like to see jewvon his charge was first to be murder in child abuse in the September 598 beating of Ashley smitson which taken off life support of month later and roping statements yesterday before day circuit judge manual crestbow prosecutor Sally wind trobs said ticket that eighteen didn't call police until hours after the beating Ashley smitson is dead because this defended punched shook battered in injure this child of such an extent that this almost three-year-old baby never again consciousness wind trobs said prosecutors will present tickets take confession to police as well as the testimony of peccinthia Bradley 27 the girls mother what kind of a name is that am i saying at wrong p.e. c. y. n. t. h. i. a. p. what up a. p. c. t. how you be doing p. c. Bradley played a guilty manslaughter last year for a role in the beating was since to eleven years in prison the first to be murder charge against her was dropped in the plea deal tickets lawyers said Bradley was solely responsible for Ashley's death she took advantage of a teenager right not you have about fifty in the emotional development of a seven or eight-year-old and convinced to me had to be a man and had to take the blame as just in public defender to leave the leechoc told the jury eight to leave the leechoc said the confession ticket gave police was a false story given at Bradley's urging he said pick it went to the store after they ran out of sausages and when it came back he found Ashley injured on the floor with Bradley and a cold stare ticket would be sentenced to life in prison if convicted he ran at least he went back to the store though he had more sausages you know that's good haha man forced their realization and I just I think I know where we start to you know I don't want to get like two ethnic here early in the morning especially after we had that real good call from that one's part to there see if we didn't let him get born and we wouldn't have that call so it's a tough call isn't it but in this one case we'll make them exception here's our poll for today boys and girls before we get into heavy duty into our bedtime stories and maybe a couple more phone calls maybe forty or fifty more and then of course the new to one comedy but yes he I'm starting to like feel better now that stuff has started to work I realize we've been like hamstrung by the fact that everything is like up in the air we can do basically what our engineering department allows us to do and our sales department though those are the two evil areas you can pick on molaw you want you crazy the dottering old man trying to do the best again you know he's a humorless silly old man with bad vera cost veins and a lot of pain but I mean engineering in the sales that's those are the evil the evil twins the access of evil at q a m the evil doers you'll find in our engineering and sales departments not necessarily in that order here's our poll question today what's your take on the TV show smallville now there some people say well that's not a very important pool you know something guess what it's a goddamn important pool and of course the fact that George and Carlos both missed I bet you about Miguel saw last night what about I don't know is he there no he's on somewhere how about you how you're a team of Gelsaut anybody with a sense of urgency understanding that after last year's climactic ending episode that this is the beginning the first episode of the year picking up all these loose pieces most of which were flying around of the tornado and there's poor john snider lying in the cave with that night with every porter and there's like the looks looked like a daddy line under that thing and our dad can't face the blind and all the other stuff and line a sitting there and she's like I think there's more do you clerk than you can see any stands up it is not he says obviously what you see is what you get and we didn't see it read his thought always said something about what he says zucchini here's the pull quite you get get with it get with it okay see this whole thing with the phone yesterday and it is kind of like back in the up what's your take on

yeah she's okay she's not great believe me she's oh brilliant like in an academy she's cute she's cute she's got she's cute but let's accolt some famous attorney who shows over in August for tomorrow

At the same time, all the show did raw morbrew The crime time program certain night So basic competition but the raw news was Way down and that's because they're picking on those Great Italian Americans. Those are Syrians The The The stereotype they have other ideas They addressed it? Yes. And stamped it. Farcellaona? I'm sorry. They had other Italian Americans pointing to And they're not saying you people. They're the ones responsible for this Negative stereotype that we have. What does that mean? Let me say it. Let me make it very simple. I know my Italian. I've been around a block a few times And Italy and also been in New York. There's ghuitos and there's real Italians. They're totally that for years. People at UC in fact are sopranos. Those are ghuitos. I want to see the godfather. The godfather. Even the like wallick is bad as The godfather. Even as bad as that. Maybe we could reason together. He shouldn't have been shot right there in the spot. Forget the can always. Can you show this as a spot? But nevertheless. People depicted on that move. Those three movies. They were all like real Italians. Except the course for George Hamilton. We should have been there in the first place. Except the course for Tom Haygen. What ever was? If you want to see a bunch of ghuitos. Go see my friends at Doris Market. See some of their customers. Some of those New York ghuitos. Go in here. Give me a half of pound of per shoot. God give me a per shoot. How they doing over Doris Market? See I'm out of touch. But so there's like Sicilians. There's mobsters. People are connected. And there's people are disconnected. And there's people who should be like most of the Colors disconnected. You got it? That's why you need to know. I mean, you got your garden variety like Italians. People like Jo Castelo who have not even had a pronounces name right. Which you always say Jo Castelo because it's gold. It's not Castelo. That's not how you pronounce his name. And don't tell me he pronounces it that way. Because I can't be responsible if the guy just don't know how to pronounce his own name. It's not Jo Castelo. In Italian, the A is always pronounced. I know. I want to saw Tom bowling last night. I have a gun like that. Got it? How's that pull coming on smallville by the way? 96 votes already. I don't watch it 62. 64 and a half percent of the sun.

Yeah, Phil. For the first time in like ages, he actually made an impact there. I think he was number five in the men. Oh, no. Like a five share or something like that. How do you like that?

Our old friend, Dr. Neil Frank, they've been using good guy. Yeah, good guy. They've been using him lately. And I notice that Brian has kind of vanished into the woodwork. Thank God. Here's a lot of our regular facts, Jesus. I'm this smallville, too. Does W.B. repeat it during the week if you know. Guess I can check the listing. Guess you can check the listings. Because they repeat it. I think it's on global or something here like tonight. It's a matter of fact, but you're not here. So what anyway, and I'm not going to watch it again. It was good, but not that good. But it would like to tie up all these loose ends from last year or so many of them. The good news is though, of course, John Schneider. He's okay. He looks a little none the better for where. They see none the worse for where. He looks a lot worse for where. He looks about 90 years old. And mommy, she still got that little pinched nose, you know. Good old mommy. And then the spaceship at the end of the show. We see his laying in the middle of a. The spaceship look like about the size of your foot. The smallest and spaceship by ever saw. What were you saying? He was for a baby. But it's gotten. It looks like it's gotten even smaller. At the end of the show, they just show that off in a field somewhere. And then there's like little little opening there. And there's little tiny space. But about the size of your thumb is sitting in there. So somebody's going to like come across that thing. And I'm going to say, oh, Clark can't like this thumb here or something like that. It looks like a thumb. You case, those bomb materials to Iran says the BBC today. How do you like that? Talk about a bunch of, about a bunch of hypocrites. British officials have approved the export of key components needed to make nuclear weapons to Iran. And other countries known to be developing such weapons. This couldn't be the same Tony Blair. Who made that impassioned speech yesterday in front of the part of his clear. Yeah, it's clear as mud is what it's clear. It's clear that you're full of crap that you're a puppet. An investigation by BBC Radio for program file on formal disclose that the department betrayed the industry a lot of quantity of the metal were really them to be sold to Iran last year. That metal is needed to make nuclear bombs. Britain has had an arms embargo to Iran since 1993 and signed up to an international protocol, which vans the sale of the William the name countries including Iran. Liberal Democrat for an affair spokesman, Menzis Campbell who's been alerted to the BBC program's material, is said to be extremely alarmed. You got it? Extremely alarmed. Burrly is a metal with a limited number of high tech uses in civilian industry, but is mostly used in defense applications in a vital component of a nuclear bomb. The program is also going to be leading nuclear weapons expert in the UK who says that the Burrly men other items which the DTI is licensed to Iran add up to a shopping list for nuclear weapons program. The UK has had an arms embargo against Iran but not a trade embargo. The program highlights the weakness in the UK's new export control system, which was set up to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It'll reveal that Iranian procrement agents have been working in the UK to get sensitive material back to Iran and that Pakistan has also been successful in procreting material for its nuclear program from the UK. It is also likely to cause concern among Britain's allies. This says President Bush named Iran as we all know as part of that axis of evil, accusing the Iranian regime of sponsoring terrorism, and in our good post-friends, the Brits are pedaling them all kinds of good stuff to help them make nukes. Man, worrying doubts says no more Browers and that's bad because I love my Browers God. Usually if you ever have a Browers yes. Octane is so damn good. I'd like to hop on a plane to go to a colon right now. Fly over to Amsterdam, get on the train, go down a colon and about 2.5 hours. Right there by the train station. Right in the train station in Kulom and you could spend a week there. They even got beautiful turlots. There's a pay thing you have to put in like a used to be whatever in hell of a current two marks or whatever or mark. And now you have to put in I guess one euro. And you go through it and you got like all these towel people and they got like beautiful fancy. You could spend half a day hanging out with the turlots, cruising the T-rooms. No more Browers writes marine dad. Although it leaves you drill out there. Don't be drillin' o Glory holes there in nuk. You're a click it nervous about that. Are they paid real over there? Yes. And the holes too. Marine says they rule their world ruthlessly and instantly deciding who'll get a cold shoulder. Who will get locked out of the power click and who'll get withering glares until they grab a little bay of the arbitrary dictates of the leaders. We could be talking about the middle school Alpha girls, smugg cheerleaders with names like Darcy, Brittany and Whitney. But no, we're talking about the ostensibly mature and season leaders of the western world, a slender former cheerleader named W and is high-heading click, Condy, Rummy and Cheney. I used to think the bush hawks suffer from testosterone poisoning, always throwing sharp elbows in cartoonishly chesty mile way or the highway talk around the world. When a less village in tone would be classy or more effective. But now we have the spectacle of the 70 year old Rummy acting like a 16 year old Heather, Vixen slapping those lower in the global hierarchy, trying to dominate and silence the beta countries with less money and fewer designer weapons. At a meeting of NATO defense ministers this week in Warsaw, the Pentagon chiefs thubbed his German counterpart Peter Struck, refusing to meet with him only dating the shaker's hand of the cocktail party. He was on the dismorning. Heinrich Ahemler, Rumsel denying this all while he was busy the winners and I was then and he'd I didn't shine anybody said full of crap. Echoing Condy's pee-vishness, Rummy announced that the campaign of Gerhard Schroeder who he got a victory by running against the bush pushed to invade Iraq had the effective poisoning of relationship. In their eagerness to apply adolescent torture methods, bush hawks seem to have forgotten the history. Do we really want to punish the Germans for being pacifists? Once those guys get rolling in the other direction, they we do not know how to put the brakes on, who could line. Mr Schroeder behaved like a good beta, tried to line himself of the American alphas by dumping his embarrassing friends, the Justice Minister who linked Mr Bush's tactics to Hitler's and the parliamentary floor leader compared to W. Augustus, the Roman Emperor who subdued the Germanic tribes. Mr Schroeder and the German Foreign Minister, Yoshika Fisher were eager wannabes. Mr Schroeder offered more German troops, left Afghanistan and Mr Fisher apologized to colon Powell, the administration's Jama Gourl, the carefulist who would always rather build relationships than run rough shot over them. If you're hard we'll have to go through way of more of a shameless spiral, he can forget about getting Germany a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council and no more brought worse than White House menus. The State Department wanted the Petyl and President to make nice with the Germans, but W. was like enjoying his hissy fit refusing to make the customary call to congratulate Mr Schroeder. As with Alpha Girls, the President makes leadership all about him. He thinks there are only two places to be with him on Iraq or with the terrorists. After all Germany is not Saudi Arabia, they have elections over there, and surely the Bush has heard of candidates saying whatever it takes and playcating for a special interest to win an election, and then ending the fences afterward. Three words, Bob Jones University, all polls know today adverse serious tomorrow's ally. Maybe the Bush policy on Empire and preemption allows us to decide not only you can run a country, but one of the proper issues for other nation's election debates. Bush senior was a master of personal diplomacy taking heads estate out on a cigarette boat to oil's games into the air and space museum to see the movie The Flood to fly. Or the fly, that would be good one to see. I don't like him by the way, what's his name Ron Goldblod? The good version of that was the first one of Vincent Price. Yes. Anyway, he was a Bush senior was a foreign policy realist who used socializing, gasping notes and phone calls to lubricate relations with other leaders, but Dabbity who was always the Roman candle and hatchet man in the family has turned his father's good manners upside down, consulting sparingly, leaving poor Tony Blair to make the case against his foes for him and treating policy disagreements as personal slits. Only the Saudis get away with disoblaging the administration on Iraq without being frozen out. They're like the spoiled foreign princesses in the high school, dripping in dolce in Gabanan, Asprey who grabbed him or Sadie's convertibles into the magic alpha circle, but then Germans merely make Mercedes Saudis control the oil. So right, it's dying out today's year of time. I still don't know how many of us have forged in there today either. I noticed that. Well, she's starting to think about me. 153 votes.

Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. We take a good hard stiff looking to start. Good then, Rama. Here in America they had nothing more than a minor impact with their songs cool summer and demons. But in Britain they had 23 top 40 singles and ran to the most successful all girl group in history, which leads to a very important question. What the hell is up with Britain? Look, look, I'd really rather not talk about it. After a summer reporter broke a two decade silence about the dirty facts and demons hoping to keep buried. Production ambassador to the UN, Nigel Klencheworthy, May this statement. These are the banana rama. Where is Shane? Where is Baris? Can you not just leave us in peace? Inside the behind took to the streets of England to find out how this smarty pants are always so much better than you country could be so filled with coolness losers who have no taste in music. Excuse me, can you talk about how you people thought so highly of banana rama? Yeah, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, man, it tastes. No darling, I'm what's fortunate on me.

Sure mate, soon as you apologize for Christopher Cross. You mean, sign me a lie? Okay, then hang on guys, hang on, hang on.

That's tonight at Treasure Island with Miguel and George and Boko Brian and Carlos, so there won't be too much left over for the rest of you guys, but hop in there anyway. I guess it was on, and speaking MSNBC, guess it was on yesterday's show. I give up Ron Paul, who's a medical doctor and Republican member of Congress from Texas, a conservative Republican, and one of the things that they talked about was this list of 35 questions that he read this on a house floor. Okay, oh, those questions that he wanted answers to that he didn't write. He's filming it the mouth and he's, see, it's amazing. The more conservative just like Pat, you can, and the more conservative these guys are, the less they want to, or rather their spirits of war, and the more they're questioning what the list is really all about. So anyway, Texas Republican representative Ron Paul, who's very conservative, or rather following the House representatives September 10th of this year. Soon we hope that hearings on the pending war with Iraq. Here are some questions I would like answered by those who are urging us to start this war. One, is it not true that the reason we didn't bomb the Soviet Union, the height of the Cold War was because we knew they could retaliate. Two, is it not also true that we're, are we, we are willing to bomb Iraq now because we know we cannot retaliate. We just confirmed that there's no real threat. Three, is it not true that there were those who argue that even with inspections, we cannot be sure that who same might be hiding weapons. And at the same time, implied that we can be more sure that weapons exist in the absence of inspections. For is it not true that the UN's international atomic energy agency was able to complete its early verification mission to Iraq just this year with Iraqi cooperation? Five is it not true that the intelligence communities have been unable to develop a case-time Iraqi global terrorism at all. Much less the attacks on the US last year does anyone remember that 15 of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia and that none of them came from Iraq? Six was former CIA counterterrorism chief Vincent Canisterra O'Rong when he recently said there's no confirm evidence or Iraq's links to terrorism. Seven is it not true that the CIA is concluded there's no evidence that a prog meeting between 9, 11 hijacker, my Hamid Abtain Iraqi intelligence, Evergreen Place? Eight is it not true that Northern Iraq or the administration claimed that al-Qaeda were hiding up is in the control of our allies, the Kurds? Nine is it not true that the vest majority of al-Qaeda leaders who escaped the piritormated safely to Pakistan under our so-called allies? Ten has anyone noticed that Afghanistan is rapidly shrinking into total chaos with bombings and assassinations becoming daily occurrences. And that according to a recent UN report, the al-Qaeda is by all accounts alive and well-employed to strike again how when and where it chooses? 11. Why are we taking precious military and intelligence resources away from tracking down those who did attack the US and who may again attack the US and using them to invade countries that have an attack the US? 12. Would an attack on Iraq not just confirm the Arab world's worst suspicions about the US and is this what been law and wanted in the first place? 13. How can it be compared to Hitler when he has no AV, no AV, no Air Force and now has an army one fifth-size of 12 years ago, which even then proved totally inept at defending the country? 14. Is it not true that the constitutional power to declare war is exclusively that of the Congress? Should presidents conquer the Constitution law Congress to concur only when pressured by public opinion? Our presidents permitted to rely on the UN from permission to go to war? 15. Are you aware of a Pentagon report studying changes that thousands of Kurds in one village or charges rather that the thousands of Kurds in one village were guessed by the Iraqis, which found no conclusive evidence that Iraq was responsible that Iran occupied the very city involved in that evidence indicated the type of gas use was more likely controlled by Iran and not by Iraq? 16. Is it not true that anywhere between 103 hundred and a thousand US soldiers have suffered from Persian Gulf War syndrome for the first Gulf War and that thousands of may have died? 17. Are we prepared for possibly thousands of American casualties in the war against the country that doesn't have the capacity to attack the United States? 18. Are we willing to bear the economic burden of a one hundred billion dollar war against Iraq with a reprisive expected the skyrocket and further rather an already shaky American economy? How about an estimated 30 years of occupation of Iraq that some have deemed necessary to build a democracy there? 19. Araxial edd violations of UN resolutions are given as reason to initiate an attack. Yet is it not true that hundreds of U.N. resolutions have been ignored by various countries without penalty? Not to mention a names. 20. Did former President Bush not select the U.N. resolution in 1990 as the reason he couldn't march into Baghdad while supporters of a new attack assert that it's the very reason we can march into Baghdad? 21. Is it not true that current country to current claims the no-fly zones were set up by Britain and the US without specific approval from the United Nations? 22. If we claim membership of the international community and conform to its rules only when it pleases us doesn't assert to undermine our position directing directing animosity toward us by both friend and foe. 35 of these by the way. Well, I mentioned that. Yes. 23. How can our declared goal of bringing democracy to Iraq be believable when we prop up dictators throughout the Middle East and support military parents like Musharraf and Pakistan who overthrew a democratically elected president? 24. Are you permitted with the 1994 Senate hearings that revealed the US knowing we supply chemical and biological materials to erect during the Iran Iraq war in as late as 1992? If we knew after the alleged Iraqi gas attack on occurred its village? 25. Did we not assist Saddam Hussein's rise to power by supporting and encouraging his invasion of Iran? Is it honest to criticize Saddam now for his invasion of Iran at which time we actively supported? 26. Is it not true that preventive wars synonymous with an act of aggression and is never considered a moral or legitimate US policy? 27. Why do the oil company executives strongly support this war if oil is not the real reason we plan to take over Iraq? 28. Why is it that those who never wore uniform and are confident that they won't have to personally fight this war are more anxious for this war than our generals? 29. What is the more argument for attacking nation that's not initiated aggression against us and couldn't do it if they wanted to? 30. Where does the Constitution grant us permission to wage war for any reason other than self defense? 31. Is it not true that it war against Iraq rejects the sentiments of the time honored treaty of West Fadion early 400 years ago that country should never go into another for the purpose of regime change? 32. Is it not true that the more civilized society is the less likely disagreements will be settled by war? 33. Is it not true that since World War II Congress is not declared war and not coincidentally have we won the Assistant had a clear convictory? 34. Is it not true that Pakistan especially through its intelligence services was an active supporter and key organizer of the Taliban? 35. Why not those who want more bring a formal declaration of more resolution to the floor of Congress? 35. Is it the 35 question to ask by representative Ron Paul of Texas, Conservative Republican and of course you didn't get no answers? 32. I need it now. 40. Pulling it to the mouth yesterday on the Buchanan press. 32. I'll say it again. You really need to read this book for bidden truth by Jean Charles Bistard and Giyom Duske. 32. The two Frenchmen.

Every kind of play that I can take one thing. And that is those people that hang those little things from their rear view mirrors. Little things. The little things. You know like a pine tree. What do they call those? No, no. I'm not talking about the scent things. Oh, the air fresheners. The air freshener crap. Wasn't that where they hang them like usually from the rear view mirror? The air fresheners? Yeah, yes. Where else you be sticking those? Canadian vicar under fire dressing is Elvis. A Canadian Anglican priest who dresses as Elvis Presley for weddings and funerals as under fire for his actions. High ranking Canadian visions have an objective to Reverend Dorian Baxter for combining the Anglican Gospel with the words of Elvis. The National Post has the 53 year old's been singing Elvis songs to center since his first ministerial posting in 1884. 1802. Often known as Elvis Presley. Reverend Baxter was recently banned from the pulpit of an Ontario church and has been stripped of his license to perform marriages now. Reverend Baxter says his unusual style is the best way to lure wayward Christians back to the church and is threatening to form his own Anglican group support of his of his Elvis Presana. I refuse to resign from Holy Orders. I've led tens of thousands of people to Jesus through the music of Elvis. This man's some gospel better than anyone I know. I'm almost as good as Mahalia Jackson. Who? Mahalia Jackson. Don't you ever heard the big gospel singer? No. Mahalia Jackson. Oh my god, are you out of touch with reality man? Mahalia talking about. I've told the bishop's all they need to do is back to you with the CDs. I don't know what they're complaining about he said. Ronald Ferris, the bishop of the Nazis of Al Gomorrah, Reverend Baxter, used to be a part-time minister said. The mix is in poor taste. Reverend Baxter says he's largely tried to ignore condomations from viships all the way says church officials would attempt to discredit his ministry and never intended one of his weddings or funeral. How do you like that, huh? The church disempower all of us. And he won't know Catholic anyway. He didn't wear them beads. Since his U.S. poverty up and income down, a way to year which ethnic group has had a worse time. Reversing some of the social gains of the late 1990s, poverty rate in this coming after eight years of almost unparalleled. I think a record setting prosperity, right? Which American public said, oh we don't want to aim more of this. It feels so good we wanted to start hurting again. Reversing some of the social gains of the late 1990s, poverty rates and income equality both rose last year. While the typical households didn't come went down the government reported yesterday, largely reflecting the effects of the economic recession. You know, it's interesting when Reagan came in office in 81, what's the first thing that we had economically? We had a recession when Bush won came into office, what did we have? A big fat recession. Now that W is in office, what's the first thing we have? What looks like it's going to be a double dip? Recession. And let's have some more than tax cuts for the rich baby. And do me any good. Hey, by the way, my church, thanks a lot, you piece of crap. I just figured it out yesterday that I've worked the last three years for free. Nice. In its annual report, I'd income and poverty, the sense of bureau said that 1.3 million Americans slipped below the government's official poverty line last year. The first increase in 1993, as a result, 11.7% of the population's in poverty, I'll from 11.3% in 2000, including George Ann Carlos. And Miguel. But unlike previous research at end of beast, especially now. But unlike previous research, most of the increase in poverty was experienced by White households. The rate actually fell for his spanx and increased only marginally in black households, where I was wrong about that. Still, the poverty rate among blacks, 22.7% and his spanx, 21.4% was roughly double ed of the population at large. Adjusted for inflation, the Census Bureau reported that the median household income fell 2.2% last year. The 42,228, the first decline since 1991. The decline income was broad of not especially steep affecting all but the top 5 to 10% of households is ranked by income. And that interesting? The top 5 to 10% of households is ranked by income. Got that nice big fat tax break from doubt. This report signals a significant reversal of what had been a very positive trend in terms of income and poverty said, By investing, senior economists at the Union, in fact economic policy, and student Washington, It also on his scores to point that the recession was deeper than many had thought. Other data indicates that the decline in household income came largely as result of falling in Plymouth and loss of overtime hours offsetting continued gains in hourly wages. In terms of class breakdown, only households within comes above 150 grand wave of post gains, with the greatest losses in percentage terms occurring at the bottom of the income letter to report showed. Income and black households fell 3.4% more than double the rate of decline in white households. One point, does that, what we said before, no, I don't know. Income and black households fell 3.4% more than double the rate of decline in white households 1.4 and Hispanic 1.6%. I thought it, whatever. When you start getting all these numbers and percentages in the year, you're not going to keep it the same. It does? I thought it said most of the increase in poverty was experienced by White House, The rate actually fell for Hispanics increased only marginally in black households, and then OIC income fell. I see. So in other words, these people already were poor. See what I'm saying? Yes. Also hard to sit where households had it by females, both those with children's and Oh husband present down 3.1% and those were females were living alone down 3.7% At the same time, they weighed gap between men and women continued to shrink, with women last year earning 76 cents per dollar and by men up from 74 cents in 2000. Today we're doing it baby. The bush minceder. Or speaking of people more leaders are really pissed off and fired up. Prince Charles fumes over foxes. You're not going to know whether the scream or look as spotted, when you hear that. Prince Charles reported the report of threat to leave Britain if it banned fox hunting has been welcome by at least one lawmaker. I think it's wonderful. I was keen to go to get rid of fox hunting. I'm doubly keen now. What a bonus. Then a skin or the governing labor party said Monday. Several newspapers reported Sunday that Charles wrote a striden letter to Triminess Prime Minister Tony Blair accused the government of destroying the countryside. How do you like that? He wrote a striden letter to Tony Blair. Both the significant number. Yeah. Charles reportedly passed down remarks made by him, made to him rather by a company and farmer than if we as a group or black or gay, we wouldn't be victimized or picked upon. A statement of Prince apparently agreed with. How do you like that? The mail on Sunday newspaper also said that on an identified senior politician had claimed to have heard the Prince on some unspecified date threatened to emigrate if hunting was stopped. Downing street and St. James Palace both applied to say whether the letter existed or the meeting had taken place. The Prince of Wales is perfectly in table with his views. The Prime Minister in the Prince of a very good relationship said, Blay as a official spokesman who briefed reporters on conditioning man anonymity. He said, keep it mom. He said, I was the queen, mom. Tony banks a labor party candidate for London mayor and a prominent animal welfare campaigner said to report a comments where offensive to two minority groups. If it is true and I know one knows whether it is or not. I think a lot of people will find it both in videos and offensive. I love that word in videos and offensive to talk about minorities, whether they're ethnic minorities or minorities based on sexual orientation. And to compare that with a minority of people who want to carry on ripping wild animals to pieces banks said. Charles comments reported on the day that more than 400,000 farmers gained keepers, hunting enthusiasts and rural residents gathered in London for a rally in support of fox hunting in their rural way of life. Rural affairs minister Ellen Michael said the government understood the concerns of the demonstrators, including closure of rural schools and hospitals and falling farming come. This is never trying to get as closure. Yes. The government had legislation for the whole country, especially on the issue of fox hunting, opinion polls of consistently indicated that a majority of Britain's opposed the sport. To which we say, Oh, right. Thank God for that at least. Okay. They may have really bad smelly teeth and bad breath and all those other things and be constipated emotionally, but at least the majority of Americans this barbaric pile of crap. Let's go get the hounds. The hounds of the bastard veels. 230 votes on our pull on small fill. 71.7% don't watch it allegedly. See how that percentage is ringing up there now. 165.

They were like, they were going over to Channel 7. Remember that? Yep. Insects, rodents, everything was fine. We had dry concepts coming when they first came on the air with me, which is a long while. No, not really. They were before that. But I guess that IOD. And they said, we can clean those carpets down there. We couldn't believe it because they had been clean since the building was built about 600 years ago by Mrs. Carl Fisher. Remember her? No. No. Don't you remember that car? We got to come on get wet at anyway. They came in and they cleaned the carpets and made them look brand new and we said to ourselves, if they can make these carpets look brand new, maybe they can make Carl Fisher look brand new. I don't think so though. Too late for him. And they can do the same for you to make a long story short. They'll take even the nastiest looking carpets, no matter how old or whatever they are. And they'll make them look sparkly and just like brand new. They'll smell them and he fresh. They dry them just a couple of hours. And they give you a written guaranteed price.

A former Roman Catholic priest has been arrested on molestation charges after religious confessing to what undercover deputy posing as his... ...as his out of what like daughter. Number five. What is that? I better read that again. Okay. A former Roman Catholic priest has been arrested on molestation charges after the judge is confessing to an undercover deputy posing as his out of what like daughter. I get it. Gerald John Plazette's 59 of orange was taken the custody of his home on three counts of child molestation, said orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amirmino. Plazette was arrested after an undercover deputy posing as the alleged victim's daughter. Confront of the former priest about a girl who allegedly he broke the witch child 30 years ago. This is kind of like a Julian cranting from passions. In fact, that's what I'm going to do about Tondrick. I'm getting the whole of Tabatha, Tecciva and Eval Connie, and I'm having an even what's your name? Zombie Sheriff. And I'm having all four of them put a goddamn spell on Todd Drek. He's going to have evil things calling inside his... He's going to wake up in the middle of night in a cold sweat wondering why he was such a piece of Drek all his life. You mark my words. Evil things are coming his way. Investigators co-operatively take the conversation between the police and the police. The police are proposing his victim's daughter and obtained incriminating statements. Amirmino said, Plazette's who was being held on $50,000 bail with charge under way statute limitation provision that gives authorities the right to file charges up to a year after the victim's been identified. The victim came forward several months ago. Amirmino said, although authorities identified Plazette's a former priest who was not immediately clear where and under what circumstances he left to priesthood. A telephone call to the RIC's orange was not of course immediately returned. The victim alleged she was molested by Plazette's between April 1472 and October 1st, 74 according to a criminal complaint filed by the DEA's office. The woman now 45, and she was a member of the choir at St. Edward Catholic Church when she first met Plazette, who played piano for the choir the complaint said. The woman said her relationship with Plazette's end of which became pregnant at the age 16. It was unclear why prosecutors didn't charge him with statutory rape. The woman told her parents that Plazette was the father court of the complaint. Plazette's told a family would take care of it and pay the expenses of the birth of a substitute and a subsequent adoption. The woman went to police several months ago after hearing of other abused priest cases. And here's another one. Oh my god. Worked to a goddamn ass. Back home in priest crap, you know what?

A Virginia priest was stripped of his ministry yesterday after a month-long investigation on earth decades old incidents of sexual misconduct with minors, DIC's officials said. The Reverend Eugene Tesla Lova took past the same looks in Virginia Vite as been rural from all priestly duties. Said the Reverend Pasqualea Puzzo. I love that name. Pasqualea Puzzo. A spokesman for the Roman Catholic DIC's of Richmond. Bishop Walter F. Sullivan began investigating full of civics after the priest informed the DIC's that someone had recently approached him about a past sexual impropriety. The incident took place in 1977, allegedly, about a parishioner in his 20s. A Puzzo said. Sullivan subsequently determined that his logo to be involved in several incidents of sexual misconduct with minors during late 70s and mid 80s. A Puzzo said none of the victims have come forward. He said no information that they've been forwarded to prosecutors. That's not that good. That's sketchy. We want the hot good stuff. We want the heavy meat.

A group that helped pull the plug on explicit adult movies that three Cincinnati area hotels met Monday and Washington, D.C. With 14 other grassroots organizations and hopes of exing out such entertainment at lodging nationwide. I got the idea how many countries in the rest of the world they have. They have porn on movies on over the air TV. Right. We're talking about in hotels. We're going to put on a full-core press to educate people that hotels are distributing hardcore pornography says field, brewers, president of the Cincinnati Bay Citizens for community values. One of the groups in the coalition that he says represents more than 20 million families and meets regularly discussed decency issues. Brewers is the coalition will urge attorney general John Hermon Gearing Ascrop and the Justice Department of Cracked On On Hotel porn, which often has distributed across state lines. Susan Drydney, Justice Department spokeswoman says the Department is committed to enforcement of federal obscenity laws. Hotel room pay per view offerings have become more graphic in recent years showing close-ups of all manner of sex acts for us says. He ought to know I but she's making a study out of it. The pro-family groups say kids can access many hotels conflicts at the click of a button. In August his group alerted prosecutors to the nature of edel ferrathy, Mary-Ottenorthy St. Mason, Ohio, and at a new port Kentucky comfort sweets. Authorities got similar complaints about a new port travel lodge. The three hotels agreed to stop the offerings after prosecutors said they violated community standards of decency, the court test for whether material is legally obscene. Currently, the American Family Association of Michigan is urging prosecutors in that state to go after hotels offering explicit fair and grand rapids, Holland and Midland, Michigan. Across the country, perhaps unknowingly, hotels are breaking the law. A lot of them in Tureley sell opens them up to prosecutions as Bruce Taylor, a former prosecutor and a president of the nonprofit National Law Center for Children's and Families. Hotel choice a chain say they say something outrageous. It's a matter of choice. What a concept. We understand that this is a level of sensitivity and different feelings about the subject matter. As Roger Conner, a Mary-Otten spokesman, we provide a wide range of choices and anyone can block edel entertainment out. Nobody has to see it. But many guests are choosing the Racy stuff. It's a major business in the US hotel market. Approximately $500 million a year is his Leonard Sebel, President of Cablecorp, where would show a help-so-tells bill for in-room entertainment. Typically, 50 to 60% of pay per view hotel sales involved in out products he says. Explosiveness is increased because the customers want it. Tad Walden vice president of marketing at On Command, a leading provider of wide range of in-room hotel entertainment, says it's an alpharis the same as offered by cable companies or said like TV companies for home viewing. And he says we try to adhere to the various standards and various communities. Meanwhile, the on-lay hotel chain, which voluntarily removed adult movies two years ago, reports that it's lost revenue, but we have had over 50,000 messages of support so spokeswoman Kim Blackman, one traveling business band wrote, thanks for taking away the temptation. Oh, oh, man. And of course those letters of support. Those are worth what? Squad, Squatsky. Here's our support. Where can I go state your hotel and go money? But here we spent 37 cents in the alpharis of $39. The stock will show you how much of the letters of the dividend. And of course, they probably all like four letters anyway. And all like they always do all the family and socials. And all these other funny, bologna so-called family. Focus on the family. Focus on your focus. Focus on your crox, all of a sudden crap. Full of people. Getting. I got to read that last line again. Thanks for taking away the temptation and the supreme and merry wells at all these other asswarters. Thanks for taking away the temptation. Jesus Christ. Yeah, he's been on it too. And. See at least when I put these things together, I put them like in some kind of logical order I think. Try to mix it up a little bit, but if you're related, you just follow them saying yes. My pie, my bedtime story is try to keep the theme going. A statue of limitation, this is in the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Ever read the Houston Chronicle? Nope. Conroe, remember Conroe takes us there with some crap going on in Conroe. Sounds familiar. A group of Montgomery County Social Conservatives is attending two more victories, one in the form of a new library review policy, the other in the form of a plaster fig leaf. The latter recently was placed strategically on a replica of Michelangelo's classic statue of David, which is stood new to top a sporting goods store in the town of Shenandoah. The former was adopted Monday after long to make before a commissioners court giving the head of the Republican leadership council location to claim another success with commissioners. Although the council failed earlier this year to outst the County Republican Party's longtime chairman, council president Jim Jenkins counter the new library policy as a win. But the head of the County Democratic Party won the commissioners could be headed down a dangerous path. The clear and apparent effort that the commissioners court made over time and incremental steps has been to appease a very impassioned group of voters and hopes that each baby step would satisfy them and make them go away to the Democratic Chairman Raymond McNeill. Raymond McEel. Good. And listening what he considered as group free-synth victories, Jenkins said the RLC is also persuaded commissioners to use an internet filter to screen computers at the library for pornography and a put-plex reading in God we trust in county libraries. The group also supported recent efforts to add the touch of modesty to the statue he said and remove some art from an Italian restaurant. Are you ready for this? I'm following. To remove some art from an Italian restaurant. In a private place of business. Yeah. But McNeill warned that if commissioners think they have satisfied the group, they may be in for a big surprise. Clearly with each incremental step the RLC and its allies have seen each concession as an energizing mobilizing rallying point, wedding the appetite for further gains he said. County judge Alan B. Sattler denied that the commissioners were catering to the group. This is being portrayed as if these were exclusively Republican leadership counsel extremist issues said. They said it was started by the Republican leadership counsel, but we are not reacting necessarily to the Republican leadership counsel whatever that means. He said the issues reflect means to opinion in the county. Republicans dislikes the terms arts conservative and far right, but county GOP chairman Walter D. Wilkerson Jr., a target of the council's iridesfiedist success in switching the county from Democrat to Republican stronghold as a different view. They are not mainstream on the political spectrum. He said they are on the radical right and no political organization or movement has ever succeeded in winning unless you and they position themselves to the far right or far left of the spectrum. He said the council overstates its fans of success noting that it's never back to winning candidate for office above precinct chairman. Well, then everybody would like to be precinct chairman of what precinct. Although the reason decision by manners of the port of Fender Schaffin said in a place of fig leaf on the statue of David did not result from the RLC's action. The group expressed support for the move of the statue stands atop an Ashman sporting good store where it moved from eye level. They moved it so you know, have to eyeball it. Diane O'Witt of Shenandoah's complaint led to the addition of the fig leaf since he shares the RLC's view but prefers to call her protest a personal effort by concerned citizen. She said she's not satisfied with the fig leaf and impressed at the statue of someplace where children can't see it without parental permission. Oh, oh, our business guy and baby crazy people like that. Like the bushy's man like John Aschra and Hermann and Yering Rumsfield is this crowd. Boy, remember what William Holden's wife, what that was a name Beatrice straight and that work? Yes, she said you're in for some dreadful times and he said I know it.

Talk show callers reading bedtime stories, pitching with George. I think it's much more fun with all this, uh, assholes calling in.

Chuck, do you think we should attack it? Ha ha ha. Oh, brother. Wow. Do we put scene? Bye-bye. Calm down. Yeah, he had too much of that bad Dutch food. I think is what his problem was. Robert Fisk, the dishonesty of the so-called dossier, or his Phil Vonna, he said last night, dossier. He said that. Okay. Look, dossier, the 100. If you can still, you know, read, uh, uh, a teleprompter, when you get to be 100, I'll give you all the credit in the world. Of course, I'll be long-dane. You know, and here is, is why is the first time I ever signed? Yeah. He's, he's pathetic. He's a dot-ing old man now. And it's very sad. Wait, you know what? Be like it. Like if NBC tried to bring Greg Jack par. How do you know, wouldn't it be a kind of ridiculous? He is still alive. Have you seen pictures of him in the tabloids? No. He looks like, you know, when you get to a certain point, and maybe he's had so many faceless, he looks like the skin has been stretched over the skeleton of his face. You know what I'm saying? Yes. And Jack par was great. I love Jack par. He didn't have too many bigger fans than me. He had great guests. It was a funny and show. He was great. And he was, you know, he was kind of like, uh, you know, like me. He was a pain in the ass, which I like that. I like, guys, we're a pain instead of always, yeah. Ha ha, you know, that kind of fully happy go lucky crap. I'm not into that. I like guys who occasionally would be like a personality, you know, he was up at the in person, a kid, and if they crap on him, he'd get up and walk out and threaten never to come back, and, etc. It was fun. But anyway, he's done. That's what I'm trying to say. It was fun. But now he's done. And the same with Phil. And at the same time, see what I don't understand is, I guess the liberals are watching smallville on the WB. And they're watching the Racy shows on Fox, but they're watching something. They're watching porn movies and some hotel, but they're sure he's not watching Donahue. And of course, the writers, they're all, they're all, they got their shovels out, man, or poop or scoops, and they're scooping up all the crap, they can get from Bill O'Reilly. Don't confuse me with the facts O'Reilly. I'll say one thing about him. He may not be accurate, release these consistently. He's consistently full of this. There's no idea what he's talking about. Yep. If these pages of trickery are based on probably and if we have no business of going to warrant, says Robert Fisk in the UK independent, 20 Blurz dossier on Iraqish, a shocking document, reading it can only fill a decent human being with shame and outrage. Its pages are final proof if the contents are true, that a massive crime against humanity has been committed in Iraq. For the details of Saddam's building of weapons and mass destruction, if they are correct, and it will come to ifs and buts and coulds later, it means that our massive of structured brutal policy of UN sanctions is totally failed. In other words, half a minute in Iraq, each children were killed by us for nothing. Let's go back to May 12, 1996. Madeline Albright, the US Secretary of State had told us that sanctions worked and prevented Saddam from rebuilding weapons and mass destruction are Tory government agreed and Tony Blair faithfully told the line. He told it to line. But on May 12th May, Ms. Albright appeared on CBS television, Leslie Stahl, the interview asked, we have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's more than dying in Hiroshima. And you know, is the price worth it? To the world's astonishment, Mrs. Albright replied, I think this is a very hard choice, but the price we think could price is worth it. Even Bob Barker was washing. Now we know if Mr. Blair's telling us the truth that the price was not worth it. The price was paid in the lives of hundreds of thousands of children, but it wasn't worth a dime. The Blair dossier tells us that despite sanctions, Saddam was able to go on building weapons and mass destruction, all that nonsense about dual use technology, the ban on children's pencils, because lead could have military use and our refusal to allow Iraq to import equipment to restore the water treatment plants that we've found in the Gulf War was a sham. This terrible conclusion is the only moral one to be drawn from the 16 pages that supposedly the tale the chemical biological nuclear horrors that the beast of Baghdad has in store for us. It's difficult reading the full report to know whether to laugh or cry, that agree of deceit and duplicity and production speaks of the trickery that informs the Blair government and its treatment of NPs. There are a few tidbits that ring true, the new ammonium pecclerate plant illegally supply by an Indian company, which breached those wonderful yuan sanctions, of course, is a frightening little detail, so is the new rocket test that they end at the Al-Rafa plant, but this material is so swamped in trickery and savory that its inclusion becomes worthless. Here's one example of the dishonesty of the dossier on page 45 we're told in long chapter about Saddam's human right abuses, that on March 1st, 1991, in the wake of the Gulf War, war riots broke out in the southern city of Vazra, spreading quickly to other cities and she had dominated southern Iraq, the regime responded by killing thousands. What's wrong with this paragraph is the lie in the use of the word riots, they were not riots, they were part of a mass rebellion specifically called for by President Bush Jr.'s father and by a CIA radio station Saudi Arabia. The Xi'a Muslims were a lack of vagueness to Bush Sr.'s appeal, and we were then then they were then left to their fate by the Americans in British, who they had been given every reason to believe would come to their help. Just like the Hongarians, by the way, in 56. Yes. No one did they die in their thousands, but that's not what the Blair dossier tells us. In anyone reading the Weasel words, no doubt, are that are insinuated throughout this text, can only have profound concern about the bases for which Britain is not to go as said to go to war. The Iraqi weapon program is almost certainly seeking to win in rich uranium. It appears that Iraq is attempting to acquire a magnet production line. There's evidence that Iraq is trying to acquire specialized aluminum tubes using the enrichment of uranium, but there's no definite intelligence that is destined for a nuclear program. If Iraq obtained missile material, Iraq could produce nuclear weapons in one or two years. It's difficult to judge whether all who's saying missiles could be available for use. Efforts to regenerate the Iraqi missile program probably began in 1995, and so that ASEA goes on, ifs and butts and probably is in babies. Now, maybe sedan is restarted as WMD program. Let's say it all out 20 times, Sodom is a brutal butchered tyrant, but are almost certainly appears probably and if we need the rallying call to scenario, when the years off to the deserts of Kut al-Amarah, where the helan is? There's high praise for you and weapons inspectors, there's more trickery in the relevant chapter. A course doctor hands blicks, we've been in that two that before, executive chairman of the UN Instruction Commission saying that the absence of post-1998 inspections it's impossible to verify Iraqi disarmament compliance, but on August 16 of this year, the very same doctor blicks told AAP that he couldn't say what's certainly that Baghdad does possess weapons of mass destruction. This question is excites on the blood dossier of course. So there it is if these pages of trickery are based on probably and if we have no business going to war, if they are all true, we murder half a million Iraqi children, how's that for a war crime? Hmm. Just mention that in passing Tony. 1127 at 560 WQM, let me tell you about an exciting thing coming up in just a couple of days. Pompo-Park is back in action starting this Friday, September 27.

The Sudanese offer was renewed in 1997 and again in 1998, months were a jaws to confirm that U.S. authorities again refused all offers of help from Sudan, even when Sudan's intelligence services offered to hand over dossiers compiled on bin Laden. Among these documents were intelligence on the activities of a serious Syrian businessman who frequented the same mosque in Hamburg, Germany as to the suicide pilots of September 11. And identical offer was made again in vain in July 2000 after the attack against the U.S. as cool in Yemen. You believe whatever you want, okay, boys and girls? 328 votes on our pool. What's your take on TV show a small drill on which was a very emotional episode last night. It was just a gut wrencher. What's your take? Well, look at time, national. Studies in the war and I said, without question, I can't bring myself to believe that it is. I can't believe any president or any administration would politicize the war. But then I read in the paper this morning. Now, even the president. President, the president is quoted in the Washington Post this morning as saying that Democratic, the Democratic Control Senate is not interested in the security of the American people. Not interested in the security of the American people. It's held Senator in no way he's not interested in the security of the American people. You tell those who fought in Vietnam and in World War II they're not interested in the security of the American people. That is outrageous. Outweights. The president ought to apologize to Senator in no way and every veteran who has fought in every war who is a Democrat in the United States Senate. He ought to apologize to the American people. That is wrong. We are not politicizing this war. We are not politicizing the rhetoric about war and life and death. I was enormity.

And they go in there and do the. And so was he by the way. So was Tony Blair in his speech, which you got twisted out of context yesterday. He didn't say, hey, let's go in and kick his ass. He said, you want to need to draft a resolution and we need to go in there and take a look in the scour, etc. And so on. And if they don't comply, they will go in there. Kick his ass.

I think it's going to be amazing. Okay. I'm just looking. I'm taking a look at the resources that we have here available for this hour. I think you're going to be pretty entertaining as they say in the business. I couldn't be wrong but we'll see. Senate approves end of end of the panel to probe September 11 of the tax. The Senate voted yesterday to set up an independent commission with broad powers to investigate the events leading to the nine level of tax in the aftermath. President Bush again urged Congress to finish work on his proposed Homeland Security Department. The vote to create the new 10 member commission was 90 to eight and came less than a week after the Bush administration dropped its opposition. The measure by senators Jewelie Rommand Democratic Connecticut and John McCain Republican Arizona was an attached as a member to the Homeland Security bill and we're glad to see McCain's face here will not begin to you know it. Yeah. He's looking a lot better now. He was looking pretty grim there for a while. McCain said the commission's work will tell you American people the truth about how our government was not prepared for the threat of catastrophic terrorism last September. Earlier the Senate defeated by a 7228 measure by Senator Robert Burr to West Virginia that would have required Bush to gain additional congressional approval in three stages over 13 months as 22 federal agencies are transferred to a new cabinet level agency. Bush told reporters after a cabinet meeting that there's still time to get a Homeland Security bill done one who will give us all the tools necessary to protect the homeland. I think Tom Wellings got all the tools we need. The commission idea gained a boost with last week's reversal by the administration which had opposed an independent panel but now endorsing it. The White House subjects to some language in the Senate measure the McCain said it compromised with within reach. The Senate created commissions probably much broader than a House version limited mainly to post 911 intelligence issues. The Senate panel would have a thirdly looking at the roles of law enforcement, commercial aviation, US diplomacy, border control and immigration in addition to intelligence. An initial report would be due within six months with the final report within a year on recommendations to prevent future attacks to measure authorizes $3 million to cover the commission's costs. Opponents of the defeated congressional oversight amendment said it would undo the delay implementing a Homeland Security Agency originally needed to protect Americans inside US borders. There would be no assurance in the end that anything would be transferred to the new department said Senator Jewelie where meant Chiefs sponsored the Democratic Homeland Security bill it would indefinitely remain a bare-bones department. The FBI was where this is in a Harold's so must be true, could be. You think? Maybe. The FBI was aware as early as 1998 that terrorist groups were planning to send students to the US for pilot training and there was some have been allowed in the personal pilot of the 10 day flight school in Oklahoma later attended by Zacharias Musaui. But those earlier reports along with the Phoenix FBI's agents warning in 2000s much about terrorist taking flight training and the Musaui case in Minnesota were never analyzed together at FBI headquarters a joint House Senate investigation revealed yesterday. You see the one FBI agent who was sitting again behind the thing that said you jeopardized my lives by revealing my identity? No, I didn't. There was a candidate for another. Somebody leaked it out. I'm not saying did you see him but did you hear the other thing? Yes. One many African smart ass. One many Apple a sage became so frustrated that FBI headquarters didn't take on the Musaui case. Seriously, they told a Washington agent on August 27. It was trying to make sure Musaui did not take control of a plane and fly into the world trade center. The direct quote. FBI headquarters replied, that's not going to happen. We don't know he's a terrorist. You don't have enough to show he's a terrorist. And by the way, in that book forbidden truth, the French are in the head of the information and gave it to us over and over again. But we just didn't want. We couldn't be confused with it. So many Apple's agents said he wasn't speaking literally, but merely trying to get headquarters attention. Three FBI agents testifying behind a black screen to conceal their identities, said he yesterday is hearing their communications inside the FBI have improved since 9.11, but not enough according to the Phoenix agent. Not enough. The investigative staff concluded no one will ever know whether a greater focus on the connection between those events would have led to the unraveling of the 9.11 plot, but clearly it might have drawn greater attention to the possibility of a terrorist attack in the US. It's a very important way to stay in a state of alert regarding such attacks and prompt a more aggressive investigation and intelligence gathering. It says, how do you like that, huh? Like I kept saying, it seems to me I kept saying that those days after 9.11, this didn't have to happen. Since we were already getting this information back then, this didn't have to happen. But when you have a government where the right hand not only doesn't tell the left hand, what's going on, doesn't even where to find the left hand. Next now virus stretching health resources CDC says. The epidemic of West now virus, which is killed 94 people this year, made nearly 2,000 stick, stick, stick, stick, stick. Hestrates the resources of the US public health system officials had yesterday. The virus is also thrown up a few surprises spreading faster than predicted, causing a previously unseen polio-like disease and some, and getting it adornated blood and organs officials told the US Congress. Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, the agency received $29 million this year to spend fighting West now virus. That money was used to sure observatulance and tracking in birds. She told a hearing of the Senate government affairs committee. All of the agency responded well via bedevac, your Gerberding said she thought the system was stretched, when it dealt, stretched it out. West now, first diagnosed in a Uganda, and will in 1937 is common in Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East, but only appeared in the West in 1999. It's great to much of the country this year as well as Canada. Oh, and the Cayman Islands. The population were most concerned about the elderly people at high risk of the severe form of disease disease, Gerberding said. Bird serves as host of the West now virus. We said again, birds serve as the host of the West now virus, which is spread by mosquitoes to other birds as well as to people, horses, and squirrels. Most mosquitoes that transmit this virus live in suburban backyards, Gerberding said, she advised people where long sleeves and pants used insect repellents and drain standing water from bird vats and outside containers. Dr. Jesse Goodman, deputy director of the FDA's Center for Biologics, evaluation and research, say it's important to develop screening test to protect nation's blood supply and scarce donor organs. Protect your organ. It all caused, okay? Okay. Judge Declare's death penalty on constitutional. Oh, hey. The federal death penalty law was ruled on constitutional by a US district court judge yesterday, calling into question capital cases all across the country. Judge William Session said a trio of recent US Supreme Court cases as forced judges to be examined how capital punishment is imposed and is made it impossible to continue using the federal statute. Capital punishment is under siege, seconds wrote. Well, let's take care of that two-good bitch right away then. Okay, before they change your mind, let's go. These federal law on constitutionally advised people convicted of the capital crimes to write to confront across examine witnesses before they are sentenced to death. He said, if the death penalty is to be part of our system of justice, due process of law on the fair trial guarantees of these six-democrits, and safeguards governing all kinds of evidence, theories may consider must be rigorous and constitutional rights and liberties scrupeylessly protect these EBCAN. To relax those standards invites abuse and significantly undermines the reliability of decisions to impose the death penalty, the federal prosecutor in the Vermont case involving a man accused of carjacking, kidnapping and murder of city was nearly certain. He would ask an appeals court to overall sessions. I anticipate or have every expectation that will take an appeal US attorney Peter Hall said. And here's some good news for you. I'm not even going to get to the Rumsfield story that I'm hearing from the Rumsfields who are going to get to the Rumsfields. I think he's losing it. I think he's become what you may go over again. Alexander, what about how the guy's name was? I don't know. Alexander the Great. Freedom of the Inc whose tips are frequently a target for nutrition and city yesterday. It would eliminate an especially harmful type of fat from its products and offer more reduced fat snack. Like I said, bad news. Fast food and snack makers have come under increasing pressure to help reverse a trend toward moral obesity, especially among American children.

And what are those orange things? Those are Chitos. Like I said, I like them. I don't eat them, but I like them. But comedy will also roll out reduced fat versions of its layers, potato chips, and Chitos in the next few months, joining lighter products such as its baked lays and baked Tostitos chips. I like baked lays, too, as a matter of fact. You can't eat only one bag. I don't like the baked ones. Oh, I like them. You can't eat only one pound. The feed oil is also developing products such as broccoli, flicked, like broccoli, flicked chips. Oh, brother, let's try that one more time or not, is the case may be. Broccoli, flicked chips to appeal to health conscious consumer. Some of the things that's like a dog, and all I can do is broccoli in there where I have flicked broccoli. Alberado Bru, cheap executive of a feeder lay north America said that feeder lays work it to be part of a solution. The obesity problem, he said sales of healthier snacks are growing at 20% a year.
