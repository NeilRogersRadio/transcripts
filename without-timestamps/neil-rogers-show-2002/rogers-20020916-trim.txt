City ask your sister and they call sadly. Woo! Hi, how are you? I'm sorry I've waited to see you. Don't look okay, I'm making it. You're always close to door, will ya? I can't! You don't go looking in the door. I spread my legs when I splash. My cheeks are touching the floor. The wall is bloody seen me like that. I'm reading the paper and they're heavy-capped doors. Please don't come in. Woo hoo! Beating guilty. Ah! I'm not with you. I'm not with you. Hey, come on! Regan or taste, Captain. Man, do I kiss? I am. I can't close the door. Because I can't see. I'm not with you. Don't go looking in the door. I'm dropping the toys in the well. Please don't turn around. Try to ignore me. I'm just too do-stop. I'm in here making... with my pants on the floor. Next to my chin. Little... Woo! Finally done. Hey, you're here for a broke. You're here for a broke. I can't stand up. I can't stand up. I can't stand up. I can't stand up. I can't stand up. I can't stand up. I can't stand up. How is it? See you, pal. I know 2 at 5.60 WCM on Happy Young Kipper, too. This is a day that everybody turns out to be George. Isn't that amazing what a skeleton crew we got today? Uh-huh. Although George is back from being sick, good young to see you. You're not going to be on the way. I'm happy young Kipper. I'll say happy young Kipper. Oh, sorry. The day of a tone man was supposed to be very solemn today. And not eating. We're not going to be eating today. Although I'm going to have a cheeseburger for lunch after the show. In fact, me. I was going to say maybe order way and Arnold, but I'm second thought. And you're conditioned. No, no. Please don't turn around. I'm going to tell you what that's today. Carlos could eat it. And if I got a better idea, how about little old Kaboos? I'll cut all that stuff out of your system. That'll turn you loose just to the foot. By the way, online detective blows. No, let me just tell you that right now. And I blame you. No, who I blame not just my own stupidity because I am stupid. But I blame the audience. And that's another reason we don't take calls anymore because we get so much bad bad information. Many months ago, back in those horrible days, we were taking calls on this show. We had a call one day, which I'm sure you remember. And the guys going out about all of those online detective services and you can find out people. Social security number and their shoe size and their mortgage payment and their credit card numbers. And I was very skeptical at that time. I thought that just can't be. So yesterday, I'm sure I'm on there downloading some stories and here come all these pop-up ads again. I don't want to get Carlos all bent out of shape. It is add aware. If you keep if you keep downloading add aware, refreshing it like every 15 minutes. I guess it's okay. But the pop-up stuff just won't stop. In fact, when you would stall something like that add aware, the pop-up ads go away for about a day. And then the next day they come back with the vengeance. I had to go down. Look, I told you before this show. It's like getting something really bad and taking one antibiotic and not finishing the worth of the prescription. Speaking of antibiotics, George is feeling better. No thanks to his doctor who also sucks. Maybe your doctor is busy doing online detective. Maybe he's behind that scam too. That would be a good excuse. Professor Marksier told me his whole medical practice is a scan. So why not? So anyway, to make a long story, sure, one of the pop-up ads yesterday. Well, I'm just downloading some of these stories. It's pop-up, pop-up, pop-up. And I thought to myself, why remember it, the guy calling in about that? I think I'm going to check this out and see if it's really true. Do they have my social security number and shoe size and my mortgage pay all this other stuff? To make a long story, sure, three credit cards numbers later. I mean, really. I'm a moron. Did I ever get the registration number? Oh, and I emailed him a couple of times a while. He didn't send me this. And a guy whose name is Jeff Fan Dine, who must be the whole operation, by the way. Because I noticed in this one hospital hysterical letter, we're talking to him in a second, that's the guy they name. And he emailed me back, well, we did this and we did that. And then I emailed again saying, hey, still I have no registration number. And so I'd make a long story, sure, I had a cancel, three credit card numbers last night, just to make sure that they don't want up charge and hold bunch of crap on there, including their service, which is crap. Online detective, let me tell you right now, a little warning. I'll do people like to punch you about outline. Everything sounds great. Okay, when it sounds too good to be true, it sounds really, if it's reputable like Amazon.com, or eBay or something like that, and you know it's like a real legitimate thing, then that's a different story. But if it's one of these come-on deals, the odds are overwhelming that it's a crank. It's just a fraud. So there's a website, www.badbusinessbero.com, about all the different rip-offs. And there are a whole bunch of these letters under. Here's one that says, why online detective should be arrested, rip-off. And it was another one they all ought to be in jail. So if you want to go, you know, stupid around other people's business, go get a pair of binoculars, but don't sign up for these online detective things, because at least this one is a full of crap. My school in there, Jeff, Van Dyne, you piece of turd, you. In fact, the one guy says, he says, I went in for a search of my brother, hasn't been heard from any years. The only information they could provide was what to do if I was ever to move to Texas. They couldn't even locate me, and I had a listed phone number, on my home for over three years, and they already had my address. And they still couldn't find me. How do you like that? Great. That's pretty good detective. Okay, our poll on Friday and over the weekend, we asked who do you think is the most dangerous person in the world today? Who is the most dangerous? Be afraid. Be very afraid. Yes, or Amaphart is there at the bottom of 38. He and Shiron were like, Nick and nose to nose. And at Borkeh, you see that? That's over the end of the end of the year. Arrafart 38, Arielle Shiron 41, and then we started to move up into the real content. They were also ran. They were small potatoes. The Pope, hundred and nineteen, and Miguel says to me, how come you're putting the Pope on the list? We're still going through that with Miguel. I thought I talked to that boy. Oh, I mean, he's a wonderful guy, and he's done a lot of work for us for nothing. All that stuff, and he looks really great, but a little slow. Anyway, the Pope one nineteen, O summa yamama bit a lot of 161. Like I said Friday, I'm sure he would have had a lot more votes. If we knew if he was dead or alive, that might help. Because if you're dead, you're not as dangerous as when you're alive. Well, I don't know. Except in South Florida, where the, you know, the voters, in fact, the voters who are dead, are more dangerous than the ones who are alive. Because they're generally the ones who swing the election. By the way, Janet, you still lose. We'll get to that. Cheese, cheese, and... Good. Now she's not going to get it. I know. I mean, they tried desperately. They went to Xavier Svara's house. They got the list of all the dead people. And they had each one of them vote three times. And they still couldn't put it over the top. You lose, Janet. And all you idiots out there, all you Democrats have voted for Janet. You've got a death wish. You keep voting for people who can't win an election. God, damn it. Bill McBride, he's our man. Maybe a young who he may be from Tampa, but he's going to beat you. Bush and November. You mark my words, man. He's going to kick his ass. Anyway, O summa 161, Sodom Hussein 304, landslide George W. Bush 455 votes, 41.2% say, G. W. is the most dangerous man in the most dangerous person in the world. How do you like that? I like it. Yeah, we know how you voted. And so to that. Yeah. Here's our poll today. Eric was telling me last night. If I'd facts him to poll before the show, we'd be able to make it a lot easier. Yeah. I didn't do it. If I didn't do it. First of all, we had to spend George and I had to spend 20 minutes to this morning on the screwing up the goddamn connection. Again, because every goddamn, see the problem that QM is everybody's got a title. We have too many chiefs and no Indians. Everybody's got to even like Carlos when you even get paid in there. Carlos is like the chief intern associate the computer with. Yeah, everybody's got a title. But there would nobody to get anything done. So every time we have a dolphin game now, we're going to, by the way, how about those patriots? Oh, man. That time he Brady undressed the jet. The answer is that they just picked them to pieces 44 to 7 while your dolphins by the way held on desperate. Desperate. Desperate. And if the quotes would have had any sense of what the clock was doing at the end of the game yesterday, they might actually pulled out a time sentence I gave it over time. It was pretty embarrassing there at the end. But they just kind of took their time while the clock was ticking along to make sure they didn't have time to catch up. They might have had like three more plays. If somebody would have kicked them in the ass. But how about that time he Brady knows patriots again. Oh, that's stealer when was no flu. Nobody wants to believe in them. But anyway, even George. So here's our poll question today. How do you feel? I interrupted myself. I was talking about the fact that we couldn't get to them and stuff on. Because Air Me's Sunday now we got a dolphin game. And two hours before the dolphin game, there goes my audio. Now is that half the half in other words? The way that they have it hooked up. There's no way that I can hear. Because that deprised me, the chance to hear Moe calling dolphin game. Are you asking me? Oh, technical question about that. Well, nobody had to go in there and unscrew it up this morning, which we had a great difficult time. It took us 20 minutes and there was all that echo and reverb. And of course, that A.B. in the young kipper being a Jew holiday. Everybody's Jewish. So we got no beast. We had no Robert Gripper. We got no Moe. We got no guilty. And they had somebody just came in off the street to run a board for a Zagaki this morning. So you're suggesting that they only record the dolphin event, including the pre-game show on one medium. Yeah. That's one of the things. We have several backup. We have to have many backups because we certainly don't want to lose that stuff. Because that's the bread and butter. That's the meat and potatoes a QM is the dolphin game. Not this show. This show. Hey, we get what our like the phone thing over here. Does it work? No. Of course not. Once you take some calls, Neil. Can't. Not that we want to, but we can't. You wait till tomorrow. We're going to have like, and we got some big news coming tomorrow. By the way, I can't tell what it is today. I could, but you know, Clarence's ego is like, I don't know. He's, he's, he's, he's, Clarence's put one toe on a ground. Okay, sweetheart. Put down the home and touchdown. It's like, I'm the wrong holiday. You're supposed to be fasting today. I'm fasting to one o'clock. In fact, you know something just out of spite. I'm, I'm, I, during this next break. I'm, I run the other room and get some another refrigerator. Ridiculous. So anyway, took us 20 minutes. So Eric, I'm sorry. I didn't have time to fax you the pull because we were busy trying to see if we could get the show on the air today. And this is going to go on all during football season because the engineering department number one sucks. They won't like put up a memo when you're saying to whoever the board up is like, like, like, it midnight on Sunday. You know what I'm saying? Midnight Sunday night. Like, make it automatic. Punch back. So we'll need to get to y'all. Punch back to the way it looks. Even if you should see all the signs like to return pot. Remember the return pot get getting shut off in the other room that nobody's supposed to be as a return pot. Right. And that's your time. Bring in it back because he had too many seeds in it. All over the place. And it was a regular anyway. Yeah. George tells a regular. So anyway, the bottom line is that we spent 20 minutes doing that. Here's the pull. How do you feel about GW's plans to invade Iraq? Five choices. This might take a minute or two, because they're, uh, choice number one. Let's rule. Sodom has to go. Choice number two. I'm forward if our allies join in. Choice number three. I'm forward even if we have to go it alone. Choice number four. I'm against it. The timing smells of politics. Or choice number five. I'm against it. The US should never be the aggressor. Don't you think that pretty much covers all the bases? I think one and three are similar. No. There we go again. Will you stop? That was just like that fair thing about the job you did? That that pull came out pretty good for you and you just can't stop. That's me. Yeah, just keep in mind even with your fever and your crafts that you've had. Just keep in mind, pull is not your, uh, sight irreversible teas. How do you feel about GW's plans to invade Iraq? Let's rule. I'm going to go. I'm forward if our allies join in. I'm forward even if we have to go it alone. I'm against it. The timing smells of politics. Or I'm against it. The US should never be the aggressor. There's your choices on our very, very important poll today. Okay. Because it's not a question of if it's just a question of when we're going in, man. Oh. Because they got a lot of oil or two. We talk get to those stories. A lot of good stuff today. Reno closes a gap, but she still loses. Sorry, honey. Get back in your pickup truck and get lost.

Got a nice back. Oh, I got no sprues for you, pal. I'm still spraised. Oh, I ought to apologize you. Oop. Oh. I got this damn tight open. Oh, I want the red ball. I'm not per day.

Sautam has to go. Correct. He's got the four. I'm against it. The timing smells of politics too. I'm against it. Do you actually never be the aggressor one? 7 votes in the preliminary total. Maybe we should say those votes for Janet. What do you think? Reno closes Gaff to 5685, but probably will fall short. Miami Day Count to continue finding votes yesterday. Even as Howard's teller remains stable and Janet Reno's hopes of beating Bill McBride for the Democratic nomination for Governor's scene to fade. Alright. By last night officials from both campaigns confirmed that the latest Tally's in-day gave and given Reno a net gain of 2,500 11 votes. But McBride still holds a 5685-0 lead in advantage. That may be difficult for Janet to overcome. The former U.S. Attorney General's best hopes now rest in more than 265 Dave voting machines that still haven't been examined. But because many of those machines weren't used on election day, the prospect of fighting more on counted votes inside the maybe slim. Officials said, I guess if they weren't used on election day, the chances of finding many votes should be pretty slim. Okay. Okay. But you never know. Not in Dave County. Oh my god, we just found 10,000 votes. They don't expect there to be many more Dave Mayor Alex Pinga Pekingy said late yesterday. Reno said she won't contest the election no matter how close to vote when county send their final members to the state tomorrow and results that it be certified this Wednesday. And then we can get on with it. Okay. Finally. Thank God. As they continue making every kind of cross to comment about Florida and deservedly so under we got them show even the animals. Even though it was got them animal channels on the digital cable, they're making sniggering comments about the damn state of Florida. So when we get back to my book with you missed the good stuff on Thursday and Friday. Yeah. The book for bitten truth by John Charles, Grissard and Guimdesk. I'm going to read just a few more pages today, which I read the forward need for election. I'm not going to read the whole book on here. Don't get panicky. Probably would be a good idea. Probably get time jick up said by the way Tom, great articles over the weekend. Tom's got 15 articles a day now to make up for the fact that I ripped them and they also took the cooking thing out of there again. At the boy Tommy, he's got 30 articles a day now. He's right to make up for a long time after I finger him for the fact he doesn't write anything. And all they had in there is the Sunday Q&A's and the cooking schedules. That's pretty heavy. Do we baby. After the 1979 hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran, the State Department's most important objective in the region was to support the pro-Western monarchy and weaken the Islamic Republic of Iran. From then on, American security analysts wanted to contain the Shiite sphere of influence in that region. Supporting radicals soon-ites like the Taliban was an excellent way of accomplishing that. Other more economic reasons drove them to such a position. Starting in 1991, various American oil companies, including Chevron, Chevron, became heavily involved in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Kurdistan. As it happened, Russia refused to allow the musits pipelines to transport those energy resources to oil terminals. By 1994, all the elements were in place to transform the Taliban into the peacemakers everybody had been waiting for. One man would meet these expectations and was instrumental in soliciting outside help to bring the Taliban to power. Naturally, it was an oil man. But Carlos Bulgeroni is not Saudi Arabian or Pakistan, or American. He's our Argentinian. He's the president of Redis, the fourth largest energy group in Latin America, based in Buenos Aires, and founded after WWII. In the 1970s, Redis became a world player. With Indian Pakistan on the brink of war in 1991 and 1992, Redis executives reorganized. They were rather recognized than necessity of forwarding partnerships with new executives in the former Soviet Republics, especially in Turkmenistan. From their offices in Islamabad, the envisioned the Stabilafghanistan run by leaders who were willing to cooperate with them, so they could build oil and gas pipelines connecting Turkmenistan to Pakistan. He'll literally stuck his first deal with the government of Turkmenistan in January 1992 to exploit a GANSfield in Deladabah. On March 15, 1995, he brought together Pakistani and Turkmen officials who signed an agreement in principle for the construction of a public transport. A pipeline crossing Afghanistan. At that point, Bulgaria only invited other oil companies to join his business venture, including Unicale, one of the largest oil corporations in the US. The Uninole company of California was founded in Santa Paula, 1980 and changed its name to Unicale in 1983. One of the success theories of the energy industry became one of the director of its president Roger Beech, one of the world's largest independent oil and gas producers in the 90s. A savvy businessman, Vichim, immediately recognized the potential of Carlos Bukaroni's offer, so much that he decided he could do without redistervices and invest in the region without their help. To improve his bargaining position and get financial backing and listed the help of another group, the Saudi company Delta Oil. On October 21, 1995, executives from Unicale and Delta Wilson and agreement with the president of Turkmenistan, based on gas exports evaluated $8 billion, which included a plan for the construction of gas pipeline that would cross Afghanistan. The cost of the other taking was estimated at $3 billion, at that point, support for the Taliban was not only geostrategically important, but it was an economic priority. Meanwhile, all these Saudi secret services of GID led by Prince Turkey, Al-Faisal, decided to give massive financial support to the Taliban, most important providing them with communications networks, but also with dozens of Japanese manufactured black pickup trucks with tinted windows. Saudi Arabia withdrew support for the ethnic Uzbek and Tajik factions who quickly found themselves without means and lost ground. With unanimous support to fundamentalist storm cobble and took power on September 27, 1996, much of the general status factor was around. If least leads to peace, stability and international recognition, then this is a positive development set a delighted, crisp, tagged, a unicale-bised president. The months between Union Cal and Delta's deal with Turkmenistan and the Taliban's takeover of cobble saw an unusual amount of interest from the US, which had left the region for dead after the Soviet withdrawal in 89. It were represented by the likes of Robin Raffey, all the new assistant secretary of state responsible for South Asia, and US to Republican Senator Hank Brown, a supporter of the Union Cal Pipeline Project, as well as a recipient of campaign donations from it, long time friend of Pakistani interest on the center floor and a member of the influential Senate subcommittee informed relations. Both justified the interest by expressing their fears of regional instability and humanitarian disaster, and we sure know that there was nobody more humanitarian than the Taliban. Brown turned Afghanistan's rival stronghold spoke with all warring sides and invited them to attend a conference in Washington later that year. At the conference, which Union Cal helped to fund, he said, the purpose is to seek advice about how to rebuild US interest in Afghanistan and help the Afghani's developed their own peace initiative. Raffeyl expressed similar sentiments when she visited Afghanistan a few months before the Taliban seized power in April 96. We continue to be concerned about the humanitarian situation here, and especially concerned about the political instability and potential for its spreading in the region. Another comment of hers, however, suggests that the US Renewed Interest wasn't entirely humanitarian, we're also concerned that economic opportunities here will be missed if political stability can't be restored. For actually what she had in mind was that Marty Miller, President of Vice President of the United Cal Polywarson Post, when he revealed that his firm had plans to build two mammoth pipelines across Afghanistan to carry oil and gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan, but all potential sources of financing have consistently advised us that we'll have to be a single entity governing Afghanistan that has international recognition before the Olympics any money. While the US may have positioned itself as an independent mediator of a Kavanaugh government, then be seized by the Taliban accused the US of ignoring Pakistan's support for the Taliban. What is important is that the US despite the fact that the new Pakistan was arming and supplying the Taliban remains silent on the issue, Kavanaugh said. Their silence and attentively after the Taliban's takeover, Glenn Davies' estate department spokesman said the US could see nothing objectionable about the brand of Islamic law that Taliban had imposed on the regions of control, while Senator Brown chimed in, these fellows are deeply religious and strongly anti-Soviet. And as the journalist Richard McKenzie recounted in the new Republic two years later, in one encounter a few months before the Taliban entered Kabul, a middle-level bureaucrat at this State Department perched on his couch and tried to convince me that the Taliban really wasn't such a bad bunch. You get to know them and you find they really have a great sense of humor he said. Yeah, they have a great sense of humor. That's why they dress like that. This movement that even the government of Iran denounced this medieval. Back in the US members of two of the most influential foreign policy research institutes took up the Taliban cause Barnett Rubin of Afghanistan's press list on the Council on Foreign Relations had this to say in October of 96. The Taliban do not have any links to Islam's international radicals in fact they hate them. While Zelmaid Khalizad, a senior strategist at Rancor Operation, which served in the State Defense Department to the Reagan Ambortion Administration and U.N. held consultant in the United States to engage with Taliban. Based on recent conversations with Afghans, including the various Taliban factions in Pakistanis, I'm confident that they would welcome an American re-engagement. The Taliban does not practice the anti-U.S. Stalofanamentals in practice by Iran. It's closer to the Saudi model. The group upholds a mix of traditional past-doin values and north of Oxford to protect the Islam. How eloquent? Only a month after taking power that Taliban were already talking about the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan and how they others spectacularly resent the Saudi fundamentalist dictatorships that supported them financially. Especially the religious leaders of that country was spoused in author Orthodox and reactionary brand of Islam. Mohammed Omar proclaimed himself spirits of a leader in the sum of the title of Mullah, then the Taliban similarly executed the former pro-communist president who would take and refuse if the U.N. premises in Kabul. One of those are a couple more progress, but I better do the break or we're going to get way in to behind you know it. Okay, just calm down. 9.28 at 5.60 QA. Well hey, it's Todd Reck again.

When I made a dad, they twist up that piece of white dye and we. I'm 34 at 560 WQ. I'm happy Monday 2 on Happy Young Kipper. There's like 2 paragraphs left to check. 3 here, can I do it now? Okay. Are you finding this pretty interesting? I'm not riveted. At the end of the terrible afghan winner 97, the Taliban's call seemed to be heard. With the religious militias controlling almost 90% of Afghanistan, or experts in diplomats posing as businessmen were already on site. The pipeline project was on the way to realization. Unicall expanded its teams and Islamabad, sending several representatives to Kabul and especially to Kandahar, the stronghold of their new and precious allies. The world company didn't skimp on expenses in any area. It offered $900,000 to the Center for Act Any Studies at the University of Nebraska, which spent the money funding various education infrastructure projects in Kandahar. Eminence figures joined the charitable enthusiasm. Among them was Gerald Bordman, the former director of the Pressure War Office of USAA, US Agency for International Development, who opened the school to train some 400 Afghan teachers, electricians, carpenters and pipe fitters to help you to calculate the pipeline. Robert Oakley, former US ambassador to Pakistan, was hired to oversee the diplomatic division of this Afghan gold mine. He set up Shabbin aslamabad in the offices of Settgaz, a local consortium created by Unicall. On the Saudi side, in addition to Delta Oil, all of the princely families wanted a profit from the new Taliban leadership, which was bringing ordered to the region. As for breeders, after Unicall's betrayal, the Argentinian company was eager to find new partners and approaching Harko-A, Saudi company with close ties to Turkey, Al-Faisal, director of intelligence for the GID. That's yet a chapter 3 in that book for Bitten Truths, you really ought to go out and buy it, it's paperback. And it'll give you really, you know, it's for the people I want to really understand what's going on in the world. It all comes back to two things, money and oil, oil and money. That's what it's all about. In fact, in yesterday's Washington Post writes, then Morgan and David be on a way, in Iraqi war scenario, oil is the key issue. Oh, not amazing. How every time he has to do with Bush and Cheney and Cheney and Bush, that three letter words he's coming back over and over again. Oh, I.L. Oh, the local. Are you Westland, Austria, Iraqi President, Saudi Musaink, had opened a banana for American oil companies, long banished from Iraq, scuttling oil deals between Baghdad and Russia, France and other countries, and reshuffling world petroleum markets, according to industry officials and leaders of the Iraqi opposition. Although senior Bush administration officials say they haven't begun to focus on the issues involving oil and Iraq, American foreign oil companies have already begun maneuvering for a stake in the country's huge proven reserves of 112 billion barrels of crude oil, the largest in the world outside Saudi Arabia. The importance of Iraq's oil has made it potentially one of the administration's biggest bargaining chips and negotiations to win backing from the U.N. Security Council, and Western allies for President Bush's call for tough international action against two-sane. All five permanent members of the Security Council, the U.S. Britain, France, Russia and China, have international oil companies with major states in a change of leadership and Baghdad. It's pretty straightforward to inform a CIA director, our James Wolsey, who's building the leading advocates of forcing the same from power. France and Russia have oil companies in interest in Iraq. They should be told that if they are of assistance in moving Iraq to a decent government, we'll do the best we can to ensure that the new government and American companies work closely with them. But he added, if they threw in their lot would sad, it'll be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the new Iraqi government to work with them. Indeed, the mere prospect of a new Iraqi government as fend concerns by non-American oil companies that they'll be excluded by the U.S. which will almost certainly be the dominant foreign power in Iraq and the aftermath of Hussein's fall. Representatives of many foreign oil concerns of the meaning would leaders of the Iraqi opposition to make their case for a future stake and to sound them out about their intentions. Since the Persian Gulf War 91 companies are more than a dozen nations including France, Russia, China and the Idleviat, Naman Algeria have either reached or sought to reach agreements in principle to develop Iraqi oil fields, refurbished existing facilities, or explore undeveloped tracks, most of the deals around a hold until the lifting of UN sanctions. But Iraqi opposition officials make clear and interviews last week that they will not be bound by any of the deals. We'll review all of these agreements definitely said Faisal Karagoli, a petroleum engineer who directs the London office of the Iraqi National Congress, and on Brello Organization of Opposition Groups that's backed by the U.S., our oil policy should be decided by a government in Iraq elected by the people. Right. Ahmed Chalabi, the ICO leader, when even a further, saying he favored the creation of a U.S.-led consortium to develop Iraq's oil fields, which have deteriorated under more than a decade of sanctions, American companies will have a big shot at Iraqi oil Chalabi said. The ICO, however, said it's not taken a formal position on the structure of Iraq's oil industry in the event of a change of leadership. While the Bush administration's campaign against to say this presenting vast possibilities for multinational oil giants, it poses major risks and uncertainties for the global oil market according to industry analysts. Access to Iraqi oil and profits will depend on the nature and intentions of a new government, whether it recommends a member of the organization of petroleum exporting companies, for example, or seeks an independent role for your whole-packs cartel quotas, will have an impact on oil prices and the flow of investments to competitors, such as Russia Venezuela and Angola. While Russia and World Company such as Lukor will have a major financial interest in developing Iraqi fields, the low prices that could result from a flood of Iraqi oil and the world market could say, fact, Russian government efforts to attract forward investment in some optimistic fields. That's because low-world oil prices could make costly ventures to unlocks Siberia's oil treasures for oil-suffering. Forschen-Chainee have worked in the world business and have long-standing ties to the industry, but despite the buzz about the future of Iraqi oil among world companies, the administration preoccupied with military planning and making the case about who's saying's potential threat has yet to take up the issue in a substantive way according to US officials. The future of a rack group, a task force set up at the State Department does not have oil on solicitive issues, a department spokesman said last week. An official with the National Security Council will find to say whether oil has been discussed during consultations on Iraq that Bush has had over the past several weeks, with Russian President Poon Tang and Western leaders. On Friday, a State Department delegation concluded a three-day visit to Moscow and connection with Iraq in early October US and Russian officials are to hold an energy summit in Houston in which more than 100 Russian and American energy companies are expected. Representative Kurt Weldon, Republican and Pennsylvania said Bush is keenly aware of Russian's economic interest in Iraq, stemming from a $7 billion debt that Iraq ran off with Moscow before the Gulf War. Weldon who has cultivated ties close to Putin and Russian parliamentarians, city believed the Russian leader will support you as Iraq in Iraq if he can get private assurances from Bush that Russia will be made whole financially, in other words, get their money back. Officials of several major firms said that we're taking care of avoid to avoid playing any role in the debate in Washington over how to proceed on Iraq. There's no real upside for American oil companies to take a very aggressive stance of this state. There will be plenty of time in the future, so James Lucie, an oil analyst with potential securities, but with the end of sanctions that likely would come with who stings out to companies such as exonmobile and Chevron, Texaco would almost assuredly play a role in this official said there's not an oil company out there that wouldn't be interested in Iraq when analysts said. And you do understand it's just a coincidence? Yes, of course. Good. 73 votes at our poll, how do you feel about GW's plans to invade Iraq? I'm against it. The timing smells of politics 30. Let's roll. Soutem has to go 25. Oh, I'm forward if our allies join in eight. I'm forward even if we have to go at a loan five. I'm again at the US should never be the aggressor. Say five.

His talent like it is dialed has already impacted millions of Americans. His appearances on Oprah have propelled him into the National Line Light. Get ready for a doctor-fail. Well, so, please am I 20-0. No, cry. I'm not crying. Look at me when you talk. I'm looking at ashes that you're from is your stupid. I mean, I think it's me, my husband, you got to be bad. But do in your stupid. Why are you crying? You see, I don't have any sympathy for you. You're bleeding me, my husband. Are you here in the 80s? We haven't had sex in my time. I'm one, never sex with you either. Look at the can on. Doctor, Phil. You know, the problem seems to be I come home. I want to watch TV. Why don't we only about you? Tell me about her. Well, I'm not trying to tell you. She comes into the room. I'll tell me what she does. Tell me what you do. I sit in the chair and I have the TV on. You can do, visit, watch, and TV. You're a deal. That's what men want to do. We just want to watch TV. You can't do it. Why want to do it? And we can't do it. See your problem is your dumb. You're a dumb, watching TV. It is. Usually, I said you're a dumb. Don't buy ball, me, like that. I'm trying to help you. You're on my show. You don't have your own show. Do you? You don't need some of that. Oh, I'm not there. So get it. Oh, just. Doctor Phil. He, doctor Phil, he just does. Now, why are you talking so quiet? You see, already I can tell that you're a push-o. But he doesn't. Don't tell me what he does. I just understand why I'm talking about this for you too. Some of this. Doctor Phil. He, go, Mr. Nelson, more or some love for you too. Okay, so today's the big day. I know you're excited about that. Oh, yeah. In fact, I got my record. It's a good, damn good thing. I don't know how that came up. I was playing a little bit of that for it because you were out last week when I played it. And I said, oh, my God, guiding lights on. It's been a clock this morning on CBS and I ran in the other room. I put on CBS and I started my BCR rolling. How do you like that? So I can watch your commercial free life between one and two while I have it a couple of cheeseburgers today and on a room here on Kipper. And then the three from three to five you can turn your TV off or find anything else because Dr. Phil back to back would have spent disgusting bitch with his partner in crime between a three and five. Oprah, we'll give you a bed in digestion. Give you a really bad. So Friday, Cliff Gorman. Croaked. You know who Cliff Gorman was? No. Neither did I. Because we were talking about how famous people generally die in trees in Johnnie and I this and Kim Hunter, the actress who was blackball. They died and then Miguel Blitz out. Cliff Gorman. I'm in the middle of some story. I'm doing here. Cliff Gorman. What? Who? Kim Hunter. Kim Hunter died. She's dead. Oh man. Exactly. That was my feeling. I was very famous people. She was a good actress, but you got blackball because she was a liberal Democrat. And of course back in early 50s with the McCarthy era. Comic pink over exactly. Commonista, the early 50s. Just like the old Cubans are living right now. Fifty 60 years ago. So anyway, they died and he's trying to say Cliff Gorman in the same category. I said nobody knows who that is including me. So I do a search on the internet here and I find out one of the movies he was in was Hoffa. Can you see Hoffa? No. You didn't see it? And so once again, my psychic powers going to work again or it was just a coincidence, which is more likely. Guess what movie was on? I want to my movie channels over the weekend. Hoffa. Yeah. And I'm sitting here Friday thinking, well, who the hell was in that movie? It was very well. And it was Jack Nicholson who played Hoffa looking, well, how do you know right if you didn't see it? I saw the previous. And he didn't look anything like Jack Nicholson. It was the only movie he was ever in that I can think of where he played a totally different role and a make up was incredible. And he looked a little bit like Hoffa. Certainly nothing like Jack Nicholson. It was the hairpiece. He was in there. He did. It was a good hour watch to begin over the weekend. Vim movie. So I just mentioned that in clip-gorman is still dead and we still don't know who he was. Okay, just real quickly because you were out for two days sick. And anybody else who missed when I was reading this forward from this book for Bitten Truth? Just one or two sentences. First and where it's talking about the abusious close advisors. First and rank was the placid and agmatic condolese arise. Even glossy celebrity magazines are interested in her listing the same pedigree each time. Professor Ritz Stanford, Soviet Specialist and former security council under Bush Senior in charge of Soviet Affairs, meanwhile from 1991 to 2000, Rice was a director of the Chevron Group, one of the leading world companies in the world, in which he notably dealt with questions related to developments in Kazakhstan. I just read that again. I don't know what inspired me to do it. Just in case you missed it the first time. Okay. Okay. Just a coincidence, don't you think? Yeah, of course. You're trying to make something to that. So these are three clowns who of course are now making their rounds. They were on with the Aaron Brown. You know something. And I wanted to fall to the ground. Man. They were on again Friday night. They're going to be on with King tonight. Of course, he's going to look their ass. Uh-huh. All three of them included in the woman I talked on is said these three punks. And it's very obvious is you try a course of tea said she said, I say we give the congressional metal of honor to you. And it's like I said, I'm Friday. Well, we're sitting here the whole soft floor area once again in a state of terror, peeing in our pants and the media doing their usual terrible job. And now these three guys. And then they got a press conference with their relatives. All we think this is terrible. And our sons are being in our brothers are being held. And the other, and they never stole a freight train. They didn't do not. Well, maybe if they wouldn't open up the stupid mouth and made those comments, which of course now they deny. Because they know that if it's proven that it was fraud that they were going to want to line up in big, big fat trouble. So now it's, you know, just their word again, serves three against one. Follow what I'm saying. I thought what chances for you is dumb God who, like I said, even though she's kind of a Yahoo, broad from Georgia deserves it. Because she was doing what they keep telling us to do. Beyond the alert, we got a freaking orange alert open your ears, open your eyes, open your rectum, and find out what's going on around you. And that's what you was trying to do. Right. And if you've been on conversations, if anybody's wearing a doily on their head. Right. That's right. And a bit of a yenta, which is what Miguel suggested, which he's probably right, but would never to last. Suppose they wouldn't have had a lot of bomba in that car or a bunch of, uh, bachelors and whatever they would have had. And now they're, well, why? No, oh, oh, oh, no, we can't go to school. That's good. Good. Go to school and, uh, the South Dakota. They got plenty of white open spaces up there, okay? See how they like you, schmoth head or the North Dakota. Well, North, like I said, go to school and British Columbia, not like in Vancouver, but way, go to school way up in Northern Ontario would be good. Or way up in Quebec. Or how about a Newfoundland would be good? So anyway, the hero writes on Saturday, and I noticed that they caught something with Paula that I caught right here on the year on Friday when she said it. And I took her to task right on the year when we're carrying the audio from CNN about that well, you know, there's the nuclear power plant at Turkey point. Is only, yeah. And she says it's only a couple dozen miles east of where this is taking place. Well, guess what, Paula, you better get out your measuring tape again. Okay, bitch. Because this was, this was all taken place just barely east of the, um, alligator, allie, turnpike, uh, inference there enables, right? And to see it's only a couple dozen miles, what is that? Is the crow fly? It's 100 freaking miles across, okay? Just a stupid bitch. Just over so anyway, it says in the hero, and if it's an hero that could be right, it seems like everyone connected the dots here, WSD and Fox seven anchor, Christine Crusade during the six-hour of the marathon coverage of your Friday's bombscare on alligator alley, it seems like everyone did what they were supposed to be doing. Like a lot of what was said during the coverage, that was about half right. Television reporters were certainly connecting dots, lots of dots, some of them seemingly from another planet. But if journalism is about facts and not hyped, then they definitely weren't doing what they were supposed to do. Friday's coverage was the source of a staggering amount of misinformation, among the inaccurate reports. Several stations reported that a woman in Georgia told police, three Middle Easterners, were coming to Miami to blow something up. That's not what you said. Several also said cops filed a themenek to they were passed at Tullbowt in I-75, run one car ruled by the normal rate of speed, the other stop and paid the tools for both cars. Fucking half-hage by the way, three bucks. The cops used explosives to detonate a suspicious nap sack found in one car. They didn't. Channel seven reported that explosive triggers were found in one of the cars. There were no triggers or anything else to do with explosives. Channel seven also reported that cops were searching for a third car. They weren't. It was a wretched performance. Worse yet, a wretched performance that dragged on for eight hours, terrorizing South Florida and smearing the daylight out of the three medical students who can be counted on the contribute heavily to the next edition of the travel guide of what sucks about South Florida. Like I said though, they should have kept their mouth shut. This is what's wrong with local news said, Bill Pohover, news director Channel 10, one of the two stations, that kept their perspective on the story and stuck with regular programming. WLTV, Univision 23, was the other. This is why viewers get disgusted with local news. He said, My only quippel with Pohover is the word local. The worst parody of journalism Friday was actually on CNN, where the high paid low rated anchor, Paul is on speculated without a jot or tiddle of evidence that the three men were coming to Florida to blow up the turkey point nuclear reactor. Now you know why CNN promotes her sex appeal rather than her news judgment. Local stations, at least, had the excuse that when you go live for six to eight hours, you got to fill out the airtime with something, especially when the pictures are dull shots of cops standing around empty automobiles, at best that stuff will get on the air without the being as thoroughly checked as it should be. Hey, worst is me, I forget the robot. Oh, yeah, Oh, that was the only interesting problem that little, the bomb sniffing robot. Anyway, it says, that best that means stuff will get on the air without being as thoroughly checked as it should be. It worst means you tell a cast of oats into rampant speculation hype. We had plenty of both on Friday. The most egregious offender was, as you'd expect, WSDN7, where it sounded like the staff had all anchors, Christine Cruz and Tom Haynes back from strumming under the causeway, and personally administering lethal injections to the three to 10 men they had already tried and convicted. Over and over, the cops and public officials interviewed by the stations reported as caution that there was no physical evidence against the men. WSDN7, WSDN7, false report of explosive triggers, notwithstanding. They hadn't been arrested, and they wouldn't even be called suspects yet. Over and over, Cruz and Haynes ignored them. The story started as sinister plot Cruz warned, darkly. Now it's become a tack on Miami. Haines wondered whether these guys apparently on their way to Miami to do some harm to the city of Miami were tied to El Caeda. This looks like some loosely pulled together plot he added, later we called them three men apparently on their way to Miami with some ill intentions. Sometimes I seriously wondered if Haynes was listening to his own station. At one point WSDN aired an interview with the Georgia woman who reported the three men to police. She described over her in one man asked, you think we have enough to bring it down, and another answering if we don't have enough I have context, we can get enough to bring it down. Seconds after the interview ended Haynes summarized like this. Three men talking about driving down a Miami and using some sort of explosive device to blow it up. How he read that into those two simple sentences I'll never know, though I'll bet Paul's on can tell us. What a great article. It doesn't have any credit on who wrote this, but in the Saturdays here, it'll be nice gone. It's a good one for the here, and it's about time. My life and law, this is for 235-15. You wait, you wait, you wait, you end. A dirty to me. No, from purple plastics, it's the talking and flatable bani, just put the batteries in and in flanks. Okay kids, now go get mommy, it's hammered a grab, the iteration, two between my legs and blue! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, this is for me, this is for me, oh, well, mommy, just will have to store it over again. Oh, talking in flatable bani, available now. Okay, I'm just looking at this bill or Riley thing that you just backs me. Yeah. Foxes are Riley and fight with conservators. There's nothing unusual about Pugnace's talk show host Bill or Riley being in a fight. They realize this time is who he's fighting. And a fast and wiser Riley's come under attack from the right from the same ideologues who would help make Fox News channel personality. One of the most popular figures on cable TV, the same fascists, the same mindless idiots. Oh, by the way, wait a minute, wait a minute, are you telling me that the guiding light is not on now? Oh, no. You have to be kidding me. Wait a minute, I'll tell you a little bit about the guiding light. So in other words, the local Buffalo affiliate here is not carrying guiding light this morning. Beep, ready, go. Think I have some stupid idea. Oh, no. And I got to tape running another room to tape this any out of quish, well, it's way goes. Well, find out about this. In fact, I'm going to have to because you're a while mistaken. You know, Hank cheats every day and does that in the, especially the five to six hour, either the coach one step show or it's been oh cook or some other, the today it's that more with Hank five to six, which is great. You know, it's just another way of having an easy hour. I was thinking we could put the audio from guiding light on between 10 and 11 every morning. Wouldn't that be great? If we could time the commercial breaks together. Sure, no problem. Earlier this month on the Riley fact, we had a ribbon conversation with Bible toting Stephen Bennett a Connecticut ministry with speaks out against the adoption children by Gays and Les beans. After a Riley called Bennett a religious Connecticut to conservative groups, concerned women for American, the American family association, urged members to protest. Nice going Bill. Always like that Bill, or Riley, you know what? Even though he's a full of crap. I got 100 emails telling me I'm going to hell or rather said that's a little personal. You know what this boils down to again? It's what he's all about. You know, just a lot of publicity and a lot of, you know, keeps stirring the pots during the pot. Then makes, because he really isn't an idea long. He's just, you know, all about himself. He's an eager to this. And it's obviously working pretty well. 118 votes on a pool. How do you feel about GW's plans to invade Iraq? I'm against it the timing smells of politics. 47. Let's roll. Shot him hands to go. 38. I'm all, let's see. I'm for it if our allies join in 13. I'm against it. The US would never be the aggressor 13. I'm for it even if we have to go with a loan seven. That's 118. So let's see, against it's 60. And in favor, at least, the 116, 58. Almost that even. Almost the standoff divided right down the middle. And you got to give him credit, though. He's done a magnificent job, especially with that mindless speech. See, the only thing he did to the win is he bullied them. He basically said, you're a bunch of paper tiger assholes. You got all these resolutions you never enforced. Are you really going to do something for what they're just going to sit down and be a bunch of pussy. And of course, they got very upset about that. Oh, well, you can't say that. Even though, of course, everybody knows it's true. So we did a good job of doing that. He didn't know job of laying out any new evidence against the set. I'm because we don't have any. But, you know, don't confuse the world with the fact because it's already a done deal. It's already been decided. It's a fate of complete, which is why on a front page of all the newspapers today. The Saudi said, oh, yeah, come on down. No problem. Aren't these the same Saudis who were given us a bunch of crap about using our a patient and we are against the Afghanist man? Are they the same Saudis? Right. Yeah. Oh, no problem. Yeah. This is against the dawn. That's right. And number one, they're scared, crap. Let's just say, I'm going after them. And number two, they want their peace. They want their peace in the action, baby. Just like that business about Poon Tang and Roger. Oh, yeah. Well, if you let us invade Georgia and assure us that we're going to get our peace of the action with the oil and Iraq, then no problem at all. We're just singing at a different tune now. And lo and behold, on Friday afternoon, we get a story. Oh, yeah, Poon Tang warns he's already to invade Georgia. Huh. They're not too happy in Atlanta about that. In fact, see. If they were to have to see it in around those bastards, if I think I vote for it. Miami bomb flight delayed in Atlanta after man taken off flight. See, here's another genius. Take off of a Delta airline flight tonight. I mean, we delayed about an hour Friday. And this is another area where they were getting everybody panicky. Was it on this also was she on end? I'm Friday. About well, our Delta flight has been diverted. Making it sound again is if there was some grotesque thing happening in Miami. Other than the usual other than the vote counting. Delayed about an hour after man was taken off the airline by a federal arms because of suspicious activity. The suspicious activity wasn't specified, but several of the passengers who arrived in Miami said the man made the nervous. The man was a scored draw flight 537 by at least one federal air marshall. The passenger was not identified. The Miami bomb flight from Hartfield International in Atlanta was Everton on the runway 1137 AM said Brian Doyle spokesman for the TSA. It took off an hour later. The passenger was clutching his carry on bag tightly. He was removed from the plane, searched the second time and put on another flight. Flight 537 arrived in Miami around 1 pm. It was a little nerve wracking said passenger Jason Malvahill, the relation to Jason London. Of homestead, Malvahill was sitting towards behind the man who was taken off. I didn't know what triggered the answer. Another passenger Jessica Valenza was husband is in the Navy. It was on a flight to make a connection to Costa Rica or homeland. She said the man taken off the plane was sitting close to her. The passenger was in the Navy. She gave herself a way she said. She gave herself a way so much that they took them off that plane and put them on another flight. How do you like that? Maybe he had like wild diarrhea. You can relate to that. Oh yeah. Not a fact. No. What's that next breaker? Any second. That's right. Any second. But you can get up and go Carlos can handle it. I mean tell me about how it'll be fine. Did I mention that online detective is there? Don't get sucked in or do people out there. Don't be putting your credit card numbers on a guy they're in and out. Don't get sucked into these websites with a big comment. You oughta really check that out. Just take a look at their website. No thanks. No seriously. I did hear it now. Just take a look at it. You don't have to sign up for it or register. But just take a look at how he elaborate it is. And it goes on and on. And they got to go to the logo with the credit cards. And they show you where to put in this number and put that number. And I'm going to stick it. I'm a smock. I feel like a real idiot. Veships accused of ignoring new rules. Veships in some Roman Catholic Dicis around the country are not following rules set by child protection charter approved in June. A national victims advocacy group said yesterday. Members of survivors network of those abused by priests, SNAP said more than a dozen viships have not adhered to rules of a charter. Require them to remove from public ministry priests expect that molesting children or other sexual misconduct. Hanky Panky invited a bobbest to look for interns. The group has asked you in the National Review Board chair by Governor Frank Keating to denounce Dicis. That do not follow the Dallas charter members of the review board which meets the local homocity of federal review boards need to ensure compliance not the national both need to be pressured into enforcing the terms of the charter. Violations include hardball legal tactics by two Oklahoma priests who filed slandersuits against people who accused them of sexual misconduct. So David Klo has the National Reactor of SNAP. If it comes out of a choice between protecting the reputation of one grown up in the safety of dozens of kids, it shouldn't be a hard call he said. It shouldn't be hard. SNAP said violations also include delays in failures to move or known or allegedly abusive clerics, failure to consult with diocese and labor view panels, and failure to provide the openness promised by the viships. SNAP says at least five priests who be the confess to molesting children or venecuse of it are still serving in the public ministry. These SNAP allegations come only a few days after report out of Rome that the Vatican is taking a dim view of some of the guidelines approved by the US viships on the grounds that they're too quick to judge priest who venecuse. Another development yesterday, Cardinal Bernardo Law celebrated mass without mucine your Michael Smith Foster, the vicar general and high-streaking priest to be accused of sexual abuse. Law had invited Foster to appear with a man mass-affiraged symbolic public reconciliation but Foster was suspended again Saturday when a former altar boy who was withdrawing a lawsuit against Foster brought forward new information. How do you like that? New information. I just mentioned that in passing and like I told you it was just a dog and pony show and they just, you know, they did whatever they had to do until the media finally got tired of it and went on to other things like let's blow up or rack stuff like that. See those are the ones that are really caved in other media which I have a couple of stories about that. Or here's another airline joke. Don't the airline's flight to leave the Guadier for about to leave for for law order. We just can't stop man. We're involved in airbie grimy, slimy airbie piece of turd. It just it floats like every sofa. It's not so pure but it floats. And don't the airline's flight about to leave the Guadier for for law order. It'll set on if no return to the gate after a passenger told a flight attendant he'd brought a bomb on board police said. Another genius. Another rocket scientist. Passengers. In fact, let's call him. Let's get him down here and have him count votes. Passengers were taken off the plane and the man was arrested to port authority sergeant police sergeant John O'Donnell. No relation to bill O'Donnell. A search of the man's luggage in plane with at least one bomb sniffing dog turned up. No explosives at O'Donnell said. Flight 50-0-3 was scheduled to leave 330 said. They went to flight attendant and asked the male passenger to take off some electronic equipment he was using the man then said.

According to the elders website, the flight took off shortly after 5 p.m. And was doing for a long time shortly after 8. This is a flight that was supposed to leave near a concrete 30.

See on a cable here we get the buffalo network affiliates, which is wonderful. But in the meantime, every now and then global, which is in two different spots on a cable and three and 16 on my Rogers cable. It's like they've fixed up on there arbitrarily. They block out whatever the network program was. You follow what I'm saying? No. In other words, instead of showing you whatever the network is feeding, the Canadian cable people, they put a feed from some other thing on there. They don't want to hear what it's written for you. Well, they're right too because otherwise they'll be distracted here every day between 10 and 11. And even though I'm no serious. I'm tapin' in the other room. I'd be sitting here watching Guiding Light instead of CNN. And I wouldn't know about the three people getting shot. Let me tell you. There's an example right there. See what I'm saying? I see it. We have to be up on what's going on in a world. Not about Jenny Jones has a bunch of naked people on what channels. Oh, you don't get it. It's on the double double double double double. I don't get WB. I don't know, do you? I'll tell you. You're not in this room. I don't know. Am I in the other room? I don't know. In fact, last night they had a rerun. They had a two hour specialist small mill just to get us ready for a week from tomorrow. 24th next week. Smallville returns. Trained in tools of terror. Question Mark. Six men who worked lived in socialized together in Western New York. In Batavian, Oless too, were schooled in the tools of terror. They arrested the 60th day. You saw that? Yes. Including the use of suicide as a weapon and camps run by Osama, Yumama, Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network. Federal officials be saying. Federal authorities who announced the arrest of the members of the alleged terrorist cell set Osama, Yumama himself, lecture them in on his anti-American beliefs. And they were in contra her Afghanistan in the months leading up to the 911 terrorist attacks. The men came home to lack a 1a, 5 miles south of Buffalo on a shore of Lake Eury. In June, 2001, Buffalo on a shore of Lake Eury. And that interesting way they put this on CBS News.com as if most people don't know where to help Buffalo is. You idiots? You know where it is? Chores of Lake Eury? Yes. Federal agents said they had no information to sell as planning in the tech in the US. We have the key players in Western New York FBI, Special Agent and Chartered Pedere, Hernd said Saturday, he ended the investigation as continuing. The Bush administration hailed the arrest in New York on the capture and Pakistan of a specific suspected 911 operative as a victory in Oregon, Terrorism. The arrest in Pakistan have rums he been all sheb demonstrated that we are relentless. We are strong and we're not going to stop President Bush said it can't David Merlin. One by one, we're hunting the killers down. One by one. Germany dropped its request to the extradition of Binalsheb on Sunday. Open in the way for these suspected 11 plot to be hit 911 plot to be handed over to the US after the last week by US and Pakistani intelligence. Oh, where are we going? Chalk up a couple for us guys. Okay. I was going to say for the good guys, but for us guys. As you can't always be too sure. Look at us, Democrats, question your rack timing. Well, maybe we'll get to that. Although I think I've already got that. Well, we'll see. New York Daily News says Al Gore-San is facing a drunken driving charge. After being arrested for allegedly driving recklessly near the Pentagon, a family spokesman confirmed yesterday. That was unafriety. And that, what is this? The strapping 19 year old have you ever seen him? Oh, he looks like he looks like a big, I don't know how to describe him. Like something out of deliverance. I mean, he's just, but he's big. I guess that's what I mean by strapping a big mugwomp. The mugwomp is 19 year old was pulled over for DUI by military police. And the wee hours of September 5th, outside for Meyer Virginia, short distance from the Pentagon, said Jane Cabrera spokesman for the former VP. It was his second driving, a friend's in just over two years. Cabrera said Al Gore the third was tough and ticketed, but didn't spend time in jail. He declined to say how and when, Gore got home. The family has believed that no one was hurt, Cabrera. Except beyond that, we're dealing with this privately as a family. Had just like no well. You know, the last and well would pull you through eventually. Ned Christian, Cindy, but no relation to Diana, Kristen, Cindy. spokesman for Fort Meyer. For Fort Meyer? Uh-huh. I see for Meyer Virginia. So the case has been turned over to the West Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Senator federal court hearing will be held and an under-term and date. In other words, when they get around to it. Okay. After the smoke clears. Rod Stewart's on jail for attacking a man. See, this goes in pairs. We need a third. Maybe Cliff Gorman's going to be somebody up. Just before he dies. To late. To the son of Rod. I wonder what he played in the Hoffa. Fifth Gorman. I wonder who he was. The son of Rod. The son of Rod Stewart was sent to 90 days in jail. In order to undergo drug rehab last week. After pleading no contest to attacking a man outside a malibu California restaurant. Sean Stewart 22. I sure hope he isn't as ugly as dad was arrested December 5th. And was seen kicking the man in the face in stomach. The LA County District Attorney Office in the statement. After Dean Kane and his brother broke up the fight. Well, Dean Kane should be able to do it because he's Superman. Right. Superman with this. Now was this one Dean was acting butcher like a real fag like an emmovie. Was it? What movie? I don't know. And that movie was on last month. And it's a matter of fact I was channel surfing and I won right by it. They followed Stewart after he fled in the car reportedly attacked a police. Stewart was also a son. I wonder if he's kind of dance to it. All where flying. Stewart was also sentenced to five years of probation or a depain early 56. Have a bunch to the victim. He could have faced four years in state pen. In a separate case, Stewart was ordered to enter a drug rehab program in June after pleading guilty to possessing a controlled substance near the Viper room nightclub in West Hollywood. I think he may have just a little bit of a problem. And of course if your dad was around Stewart, you probably have a problem too. When you're a lot of money. Probably I'm looking at dad though. Man. You think he's sexy? Oh. Speaking of somebody who's definitely not sexy, which is why her hobby is still out looking for interns. Swill or recundant. This, you know what this reminds me of. It's like the Janet Reno thing all over again. It's called Democrats with the Death Wish. Right. Hillary Clinton for president question mark. This is in the New York Daily News today. The answer is yes. It's only a question of when it's like our attack on a rocket. Don't have a question of when well play sources said yesterday. The insider's told the Daily News the New York Senator is on your return to the White House in 2008 or beyond. Keep going. This, yeah, keep going like 258. The sense is that both she and president Clinton would like to see a run for president, but their first priority is getting a Democrat elected the White House in 2004 said a long time Clinton and citer. It may be over a few weeks and maybe 12 and maybe never what she's not going to be super about this. And make sure she does a job at senator the source and write at least to other sources, Crystal Clinton confirmed talking��고 to return the White House and has picked up steam among members of the couples in her circle. Clinton kept her plans posted yesterday but in Clinton has bashing what she didn't say was as. on out by the way, I noticed that Colin Powell was on her again the other day yesterday. They keep their bangin' on a drums man. When asked if she'd accept the nomination for President or VP in 2004, Clinton repeated previous assertions she would absolutely not run and was 110% sure of that. When pressed about 2018, didn't rule out a run outright, saying twice she had no plans into intention of running. Ash Blackland appeared to avoid simple yes or no, while regarding a run in 2008, when she'll be 61 or after, spokeswoman Karen Dunsett, she was clear she's not running. The AP report last month that Brooklyn's talked about his wife seeking the White House as a question of when, not if. Like the attack on Iraq. In July, she scored 20% and they see in any way they got to a yellow presidential poll, a close second to Alvource 28%. Remember, at our poll, she did pretty good too. Oh, I know. I think we had a joke. Clinton has meant to pull off surprises and her two years in the sentence. She's shred her frosty, first lady image during a baby shower for Senator K. Bailey Hutchinson Republican Attext's Navy winning kudos former detractors like Senate Minority later trend lot to lecture pompoms a lot. 1026 at 560 WQA and get yourself a great new mattress and you'll sleep like a baby night after night.

No, no, no. 1032 at 560 we contained Stalin for 40 years with that gigantic nuclear arsenal and of course we know as far as biological and chemical weapons they put us to shame. Right. In fact since last year ago, 119 11 we've been seeing all these stories about well. We don't know where a lot of that stuff is and a lot of it's under like lock and key that you feel like you know with no guards and you could pick the lock with your thumbnail and stuff like that. George could pick it and the lock too. But you know that we contained him for 40 years and he had all he wasn't like working on building a bomb. He had this gigantic arsenal of nuclear weapons and I don't know what he's at but I'm like Sodom who killed Thos of his own people and gave me the old gas. He killed millions of his own people Stalin but oh that is irrelevant now because well for whatever. Linda Stacy writes a new huh? I'm just taking it. Join Jo and Mark tonight 9 11 for Monday night football a Gaffee a Gaffee's Kendall store. Stuff by the wind prices and enjoy specials on crown royal. It's the Eagles and the Reds against that Gaffee's in Kendall. How about those Patriots? Tom Brady, baby. Man did they kick some serious jets out yet even the dolphin fan should have enjoyed that. Because they loved seeing the jets lose but on the other hand it might give them a little bit of pause. After seeing the lions get crushed by a girl's team again yesterday. The same line to the dolphin's crush the last week and then of course beaten the team that's got no defense at all the occult and just hanging on by their thumbnails because the cults kind of ran out the clock on themselves amazing. But we'll see we'll see when push comes the show and who would you rather have his quote about on your team. Jay Fiedler or Tom Brady. Orange you glad that we're not panicking right Linda Stacy in the or post? Cute, it's cute article. Not that they wanted to cause man's panicking or anything but Tuesday the White House went orange. That's the day the fans raised the terror terrorist color bar to code orange which is not as bad as red but definitely worse than yellow blue or green. What are we supposed to do with this information it was hard to know but I do know I'm not leaving the house until we're declared full teal. We're also we're not to panic but nonetheless beyond guard forces suspicious people who may or may not be terrorists carrying weapons of mass destruction. Right, I see now I got it over because it because it says breaking news on CNN we've got control of the bin al-sheep in pack is that news? We got control of them. In other words we got to buy some nails. Excuse me for our I wish delgating light was on you know what they make me sick. We were also we're not to panic but nonetheless beyond guard forces suspicious people who may or may not be terrorist carrying weapons of mass destruction. Right, excuse me but this is New York everyone is suspicious. It's not as easy to blend in anywhere else. Take the morons who try to pull a sick joke and George the last week. You can mirror your own brother there and still be considered normal but you'll have a show on the phone. And you'll end up with your keys to the camp. That's what happened when a woman over her three young Middle Eastern looking men making inappropriate remarks over breakfast and a Kellon County restaurant reported them. In the spirit of not panicking airplanes were divided a 20 miles stretch your highway we shot down and three Middle Eastern looking young men were finally nailed and then released in Florida. The men pulled us down apparently to spook the woman after she stared at them suspiciously. Also in the spirit of not panicking on Tuesday, a Northwest yet on Route to Vegas was divided to Fort Smith, Arkansas after was reported that three Middle Eastern looking men locked themselves together in a restroom and shaved. Later was determined that the men of Indian descent had not been in the restaurant together but that two of them had used the bathroom and succession and stayed into long. Three questions. One, how could three guys even fit into one airplane restroom? Two, how do you not lock yourself into an airplane bathroom without falling into the bowl in the dark? And three, why did these guys get to take their raises aboard if I personally have donated six tweezers to nail files in one cuticle blipper to various airline security guards? A Hispanic passenger who was recovering from surgery was fast asleep, was also arrested for heat claims being dark skined. To modify the terrified-deverted passengers, Northwest treated them all the pizza and beer in the force bill therefore. Hey, three airport pizza in Arkansas, who would make an emergency landing for something like that? And one of the airline also came up with three tickets. Finally in the spirit of really, really not panicking, Senator Patrick Lehi, Democrat of Vermont suggested that mosquitoes carrying West now virus may be in fact a living weapon of bioterror. The feds immediately arrested seven billion mosquitoes but were forced to release all but 13 after the average claim racial profiling. Pretty good by Linda Stanti and the inn here are posted today. Two, I like this. This is a great article never forget what rights Frank Wichdon or relation to fat rich. How's fat rich doing by the way? I was hoping you'd tell me. This is in yesterday's New York Times or was it said or is like I said in Saturday's New York Times, Frank Wichwich writes never forget what? Candle is still a little prize in Washington that you want to shake the hand of anyone who dares committed. So cheers to Andrew Card, the president's chief of staff for telling the times Elizabeth Bumill or the real reason that his boss would held his full front of Mosin Sottomus saying until September. From a marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products and August he said. Mr. Card is taking some heat for talking about a war in which many may die as if were the role out of a new SUV. But he wasn't lying and history has already proved him right. This campaign has been so well-timed and executed that the new product already owns the market. The unofficial model of the 9-11 anniversary may have been never forget, but by 9-12 if not before the war in Al Qaeda was already fading from memory as the world was invited to test drive the war on Iraq. Al Qaeda may be forgotten but it's not gone apparently even from the summer was above low, at least two thirds of its top leadership stay are still a large. A draft version of a UN report on our finger to shut down its cash flow says Al Qaeda is by all accounts fit and well and poised as struck again at its leisure. It's already struck at least a half dozen times since January. regime change anyone. Al Qaeda almost brought one about an Afghanistan assuming it's likely role in the assassination attempt on Hamid Karzai is Harry Shuris at an this historical radio programly show 9-11 is the event that changed everything except terrorism. But on to Iraq, Sottom might be able to build a nuclear weapon within a year said George W.W. the UN on Thursday. Yes, but Pakistan where the Washington Post recently found two top-cut operatives planning newations with impunity already has nuclear weapons with terrorist reach. Al Qaeda terrorist escape from Afghanistan owned to be in Iraq said Mr. Bush on Thursday. Yes, but their Qaeda operatives in the 65 countries and the times reported this week that the largest number of them are in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Iran identified by Mr. Bush's own state department in May as the most active states sponsor of terrorism, Syria and Yemen are not far behind and then there's our ally Saudi Arabia. According to USA today nearly 80% of the hits on a secret of Qaeda websites in Stun have come from addresses in the country that also spawn nearly 80% of the 9-11 hijackers Saudi Arabia. That Iraq is a grave and gathering danger to the President also said is not in doubt, but is it as grave and danger as the enemies that attack the Merckon 9-11 and those states that are most integral collaborators? The campaign against Iraq, Rob Benz, growcroft and the Afid that launched the thousand others is certain that I've heard of for some indefinite period from our war in terrorism since major Qaeda attacks are planned well in advance and historically been separated by intervals of probably 24 months. We'll find out how much we've been distracted soon enough. There is now a debate about the new war but so far spent they largely a parochial Washington affair largely about process and soon to be academic. Well President Bush has Congress for authorization to go after Sudan while the consultant security council we now know the answers are yes and yes but that Congress will not stand in his way. If then, I'm a crant can't challenge the President about taxes they certainly won't about war. The security council may now sign on too to Mr. Bush's rightful demand that the UN enforcers own resolutions against Iraq but when side of an all likelihood box we'll go to war no matter how few are allies. If you think back to that ancient past in summer of 2001 you'll recognize the game plan from the White House and several weeks of deliberation over stem cell research. He's listening to all sides of debate. Are he fleshers said then even though was evident from the get go that Mr. Bush would do pretty much what he always intended after a few even after a few weeks of ostentatious listening. I guess I have to end up now for the break right? Okay Frank rich never forget what there's a lot more to it in the New York Times Saturday. You know that county pink on New York Times you know that one. Yes. 1040 at 560 WQM on half a U.M. Keper to our Jewish friends out there eat something okay believe me don't go fast in the day you'll be a polishing man like I see in Yugoslavia. And by the way I had a lousy time in Yugoslavia was that movie massive feel with Jack Lemum remember?

three to six nine more five six to make room for her cool hotline six o'clock I think that's pretty wide of no two like step in the sign to make room for that great important show never forget what Frank writes right in the Saturday New York Times and it continues the question the president on a rack is an invitation to have one's patriotism be smurched the infected aimed at those with the toughest questions almost all of them pillars of the republican or military establishments have been ordered borderline ugly complete with the requisite illusions to level chamberland but it's hard to find any doubt or the war who wants to a peace out and were to nize that he's an evil player the question many critics are asking is why is he jumped to the head of the most monodless when the war on al-Qaeda remains unfinished in our resources are finite even though it's who can stomach preemptive war as a new doctrine wonder if we have our preemptive priority straight taking noon in this faithful a George W. partisan is there is sharp in the question most puttedly in the Wall Street Journal of the Turret page last Wednesday when she implore the president to give us facts instead of sermons and making his case sottom is evil is not enough she wrote a number of people are evil and some even are friends like he used to be sottom has weapons of mass destruction is not enough a number of countries do what the people he now is hard data that demonstrate conclusively that sottom has weapons of mass destruction which he's ready to use on the people of the u.s. or the people of the west and maybe even the non west what we've been getting instead is one thing worse than no data false data for months of administration officials have been trying to implicator rack in nine eleven with a story of alleged April 2000 meeting in Prague between Muhammad Ottani sottom spy but the CIA can find no evidence of this and the 21 page fact sheet the west released with the president's speech mentions no sottom 911 link at all as for nuclear arms last weekend in his appearance with Tony Blair the president referred to when nineteen ninety eight international atomic energy agency report that said that Iraq was six months away from developing a nuclear weapon adding I don't know what more evidence we need plenty more as it happens because agencies spokesman says no such report exists this is why those who want most of the minister bush from a conservative geopacen leader like don nickels to our allies keep saying mr. nickels words you're not giving us enough it's this high handed this and echoes the run up to be at none the analogy can be over done certainly since today's armed forces are highly unlikely to find a rack of military quagmire and no one can even try to make a case that legitimacy of sottom's regime but there's a wide-naked credibility gap between the white houses marketing of the war and the known facts the arrogance of this CEO administration which gives citizens no better information then companies like halibut and gave it with stockholders because the hubris of those ivy league in corporate with kids on Robert Macameraz pentagon team as who saw themselves as veteran brighter than the rest of us but on to Iraq anyone who believes that mr. bush might turn back now is not been following the path of a president who buys own account never second guesses of decision indeed we've already ratcheting it we're already ratcheting up our long-standing military engagement with sottom as we move from containment to attack mode though it might be best of focus on less on procedural debates such as the timing and wording of whatever stand for rural congress will deliver and more on the tougher questions the administration will prefer to ignore what happens if al-Qaeda tax the u.s. or if Afghanistan or Pakistan falls while we're at war in Iraq can we continue to meet our commitments with an all volunteer army as budget deficit spirally the foreseeable future where we'll be get the tens of billions of dollars we need to support the post-sottom Iraq that we will surely inherit is sottom our new focus because he's the most catastrophic threat or is there another agenda that should be spelled out whether it involves oil or unfinished bush family business this is the candid talk we need to have maybe the administration can make the case that we can simultaneously rip al-Qaeda and sottom secure Afghanistan for keeps paying the rest of the access of evil go to gas and perpetuity and keep cutting taxes for some of us like the rich if that's so when someone else's children will be marching on Baghdad what paper would not stand up and say let's rule what a good color on by frank rich in senator days new york times see it requires a little bit of thinking not a whole lot just a little bit of thinking before we like start waving a flag let's go get a because a few months ago i'd say hey let's go go get that senator bit you know and i'd also like to remind you that fact during Gulf war one back in early nineties were we able to kill them see he's got the all these so-called palaces which are like heavily fortified bunkers and you know and in addition to which if we as you call it's stir the hornet's nest and he does actually have all these chemical and biological agents which of course we provided for him factoring is war with the rand being one of those people who's not to a silo being one of those people who are you know he'd be more than happy to take down as many people with him as he could as a last gaspefford on a way out at that point we'd be inviting him to use those things right and then of course to be spotted by saying well if you use weapons of mass destruction we're going to like blow you in a stone age that means we're probably nuclear weapons on Baghdad uh see this isn't world war too we're dropping nuclear weapons on japan to save the lives of thousands of americans because we're in a world war and to try to end it sooner rather than later because the uh the emperors eludatek terrorist trojan horse rights senator chucks humor in the eneor times this was also on Saturday much of our recent national conversation has revolved around nuclear weapons of the potential terrorist to wreak havoc in america but while the bush administration is focusing attention on a potential war with the rack it's ignoring a less costly and less controversial method that could protect us more permanently from nuclear attack tightening our borders by installing devices that could detect nuclear weapons as terrorist attempt to smuggle them into the country such devices are feasible to create and which shield is not only from a rack but from nuclear terrorism launched by nations like Iran or groups like al-Qaeda or hezbollah just as important such a project when the estimated price tag of a billion dollars would cost far less than invasion of a rack just this week a container ship from library was stopped because of suspicions that it might contain radioactive material. Clearly the danger that even crudonably weapons post-horanation is increased dramatically and are post 9-11 world. The atomic bomb that exploded above her ocean was simple two hemisphere years of weapons great uranium were smashed together instantly creating a critical mass that released a blast of energy comparable to that created by exploding 15,000 tons of TNT. It was such a basic device that the scientists at al-amagordo felt no need to test it. No one doubts that today's terrorist groups have the technical expertise to make such a device. Worst, the illiterate smuggle such a bombing of our country not by plain or missile but like a Trojan horse in one of the tens of thousands of large cargo containers than there are ports across our borders daily. A suicide bomber could detonate the device in the center of one of our cities creating a disaster that would dwarf the horror of 9-11. The only thing preventing this from happening today is that terrorist groups like al-Qaeda not have the 110 pounds of weapons great uranium needed to create such a bomb if a rack is able to produce the need amount of enriched uranium that injured to America would be enormous. The administration sphere that Iraq could acquire nuclear weapons is justified. There are ways to help stop this nightmare from becoming reality. Every nuclear device produces gamma rays which pass through almost everything but lead. Today the only device that detects these raises a geiger counter that must be held within two feet the radioactive source. To have an inspector stop every container that comes to our land and water borders and enter the container and hold the geiger counter within two feet scores of boxes and creates an each container would bring commerce to a standstill. The good news is that scientists at our national energy labs believe the geiger counter could be improved in the tech nuclear devices 40 to 50 feet away. The super geiger counter should be installed on every crane that loads of our loads of container of cargo bomb for the US and above every tool booth that trucks pass under a Mexican and Canadian borders. Senator John Warner and I have introduced legislation to develop and eventually install such devices were attempting to add it to the Homeland Security legislation now being debated by the Senate. The Bush administration in the Congress have thus far shown little interest. The administration in some members of Congress are willing to consider spending $40 billion and risk the loss of many lives in a war with Iraq but there's a reluctance to spend money on domestic solutions much cheaper in lives in dollars. The administration is this far focused most of its energy on fighting terrorism abroad and is neglected the home fraud. At some point it may well be that the president will demonstrate that Iraq is able to produce critical masses of weapons-grade uranium before a nuclear detection devices can be developed but that's no excuse for failing to also pursue this peaceful and more permanent solution to our nuclear dilemma with the same zeal that we bring to the pursuit of war for Chuck Schumer and Saturdays New York Times. There are a lot of people making a lot of sense but of course the mainstream media like I said before they're just enchanted them and they've done 180 degree turnaround. They're on to Van Wagon. There was one of the talking he had chosen over the weekend and I wish to all I remember his name. They had the Dennis decontiniest that his name, the former Democratic Senator from Arizona in the Mexico where the hell was he from seven to southwards and an former L.A.S. and Senator and this L.A.S. said it was on MSNBC. It was great absolutely sensational and a chopped him off man he didn't get to say crap before they finally chopped his well we're up against the break and we want to thank you both very much. He was just going ballistic and everything he said made not a lot of sense to me but then what do I know? 225 votes on a pool how do you feel about George W.A. is planned to invade Iraq and no matter how you feel about what's going to happen.

Wayne from IOD you know Wayne you can't well win with me okay so we don't want to go out there break that fucking guy's neck what's that under break oh see I never would have how would you find that what a break that fucking guy's neck I'll not just play that the rest of the show how's got any light how that turned out today I wasn't watching it media your friends a feed you guys delusions over attack rights Linda McQuig and yesterday's Toronto star a media frenzy feeds US delusions over attack with public support for war against your back flagging in the western recent ways the Bush administration was clearly hoping that the 9-11 anniversary would be just a thing to get war fever back on track certainly the media could be counted on to do his part of whip the citizenry into a frenzy of grief and rage thereby rousing the american people the way to war in a country that apparently had nothing to do with 9-11 but at least offers a target that can be located the manipulation of grief to still confuse the asm for battle is of course nothing new it was used in Iran in the 70s by fundamentalist Muslim clerics to drop support for their fledgling movement whenever dissidents were killed by the shaw's brutal forces the clerics held a elaborate funeral ceremonies to further stir motions and in less recruits to fight the Shaw and his backers in Washington the clerics strategy was highly effective and they didn't even have seen it in their disposal this is worth remembering is we can't contemplate the media frenzy of the past week that helped turn the bloodbath of 9-11 in a way staging ground for endless war certainly the u.s. media have greatly helped the White House make its case when tracking down the or some have been lawdden proved too difficult the bush administration switched this focus to regime changing Iraq the media have followed this turn in the plot without question highlighting Sodom's use of chemical weapons against his own Kurdish population and atrocity that receives far more attention now than when Sodom was still the u.s. ally the u.s. media also acts as a filter preventing incorrect ideas from slipping through as Antonia Zerbezi is noted in the star last week CNN and MSNBC host of smeared Scott Ritter who is an okay spot away if x-cobertor sends me to the smitter have smeared Scott Ritter former head of the u.s. weapons inspection mission in Iraq who blames Washington for the missions breakdown TV host of openly questioned murders lawyer ladies and americans indicating the media have taken on the function once performed by the McCarsley committee on unamerican activities ask him how to allow that felt or he's dead certainly criticizing Washington these days leaves one of vulnerable to charge of anti-americanism with its demands for blind unquestion loyalty and talk of good and evil the world's only super power seems to be increasingly taking on the characteristics of a cult above all the u.s. media have filled around anything that could lead viewers to question why so many people around the world feel such bitterness toward Washington when George borne soon after 9.11 provocatively raised the question why do they hate us so it seemed inevitable the media would start examining some possible reasons such as the long history of u.s. interventions in the Middle East Southeast Asia and elsewhere instead the media pretty much accepted bush's explanation that those who hate the u.s. are simply jealous of its freedoms and explanation that might be satisfying but delusional like your girl convincing yourself other girls hate her because she's pretty when it might be because they think she's a jerk. Even after a full year of media analysis of man 11 americans still have little knowledge of brutal u.s. born interventions, amply documented by nomchomsky and other scholars or the enormous power and wealth imbalances in the world of John Cretchen are used fully observed last week. How could Americans have such knowledge when their media following the White House script consistently present u.s. actions abroad as well meaning efforts to bring democracy to other parts of the world rather than aggressive attempts to advance u.s. economic and political power. So nobody thinks part of the story is missing when bushbowg to finish what our enemies have begun as far as the public knows everything started with 9.11 out of the blue people came to hate the u.s. for its freedoms no one else ever experienced the kind of pain and suffering Americans did on 9.11 back in 1991 when the beating of Rodney King by L.A. police officers were captured on some commentators objected that the video didn't tell the whole story didn't capture King being abusive to the police beforehand provoking their fury but was that the whole story either? If King was abusive what abuse has had even subjected to over the years as a black man in America where does the story begin where does the rage start? Crimes of course should be punished no matter what their causes, the perpetrators of 9.11 must be hunted down and brought to justice but what if we really want to understand why such things happen and how to protect ourselves in the future? It seems counterproductive to block out all information that might be helpful. It's unproductive that is unless the goal is to make sure that nothing changes. Rhodeland and McQuake in yesterday's Toronto star, eh? Well said. Well said, Linda. All over Scott Ritter sends me to the Schmitter, okay? He's one of those guys, you know the expression he protested a little bit too much? Yes, that's him. In other words he has no credibility. In fact, why? Yeah, I think you can really bore the down to uh he's an asshole. Right, I think that sums it up pretty well. How many votes we got? 246 that are very important poll today which are going to send the White House. Aren't we? Oh. How do you feel about GW's plans to invade Iraq? I'm against it the timing smells of politics. 142.2%. Let's roll. Sodom's got to go. All right. 73, almost 30%. 29.6. I'm forward of our allies during in 27. I'm against it. The U.S. should never be the aggressor. 22. I'm forward even if we have to go to the loan 20. So let's see, people against it for what are 126. And we got 246. Half of which would be 123. Can you believe that? I believe it. 120, 120, right down the middle, baby. Let's split right down the middle. And I give them all a more high marks in the world for a tremendous a phenomenal job of propagandizing and a dog and pony show it to you in and of course he had some valid points there. It's a paper tiger. They can draft 80 million resolutions. They never follow through. Nobody pays any attention them. Like the Israelis have to fight over 200 resolutions by the way. 200. Are you aware that? Yeah, yeah. And they say, oh, half of the points, baby. It's jump kiffer. I'll bother us. You know stuff like that. So the U.S. is just a paper tiger and it's a joke. I'd expect a joke. And now the N. W. which we pay for it. And now the studies are very briefly jumping on board. 12 minutes after 11 at 5.60. I'll say it again. We ought to be in Saudi Arabia right there. We ought to like go into our base there and we ought to just say, well, we're like, uh, we thought it was the Chinese embassy. I mean, we thought it was a wedding. I mean, we thought, you know, we got a little bit turned around here. Our compass, our compass, the like dilute a few corpide to like die and it happened to be Saudis. That's who we ought to be bombing in submission is freaking Saudi Arabia. That's the breeding ground. That's the culture ground. That's where they got all the peaky dishes with a terrorist and every goddamn dish and every madrasa. That's that's where they teach him. Anyway, I'm just much of that in passing. Not going to happen because there are partners in oil. 12 minutes after 11 at 5.60. W. K. O. A. M. Summers over to more barbecues and more vacations. So now it's time to get serious about losing that weight because not only is it ugly and grotesque, you know, one thing about when you're fat, you can't buy any clothes that like look good. That's why all of us who are fat are like really bad, sloppy dresses because what difference is a make? They don't make good clothes. And spider watch Shirley Peters might try to turn it to rationalize or totally feel all or she's now dead. They just don't make good looking clothes for So if you're trying to be in a slob, but the most important part of being in bad health. Here's the answer for you. Balance for life. The beast who I would say was just maybe a year or so away from death. When you, at least, he was close. He was not a virgin. Here's a young guy who was like five foot four, two eighty four. He's lost fifty four pounds. Oh, I'm balance for life. Let's see. April, May, June, July, August. That's like in six months. Right. And you can do the same. Of course, maybe you don't have that much to lose or maybe you have more. You can still do it and it's painless because it's the problem with most people died. What do I eat?

I mean we could But I mean I get a message from Clarence about that on my machine Friday night get off your dog. I mean what I don't get it I think maybe we got some people taking themselves a little bit too seriously The audience is interested in the people around here. Okay. I mean we on a show we make a big deal about the people behind the scenes And this one did this and this one got my check screwed up and this one got a deliberate a day early. Whatever, you know And it kind like spices things up a little bit but generally speaking the audience doesn't tune in a program He heard a program director the general manager the operations manager the guy then sales hole But I guess tomorrow morning will we'll spill the beans 264 votes on that survey and it's almost right down the middle About what you think about GW is how do you feel about GW's plans to invade Iraq? They're not plans anymore, baby. It's gonna happen. We're going in Scared tactics is foreign policy. This is an edit. No, it's not it's a column see I made that mistake with a great. Oh, you would have loved it a great column in the National poster on Friday about all drugs ought to be legalized Okay, not just marijuana not the criminalized, but all drugs should be lit and I thought it was an editorial because it was on the left hand page And then I realized that in the national post which is a very marginal newspaper anyway They're edit turtles are on a right hand side of page and the commentaries are on the left See what I'm saying I say ask backwards. Maybe that's like a brick thing. I don't know But anyway, this is an article by Stephen Jefferson a relation to George Palm Beach Post comments from this past Saturday scared tactics is foreign policy I doubt if a certain age can remember when the foremost terrorist was the boogie man a remorseless creature So we've allowed he was ever ready to wreak destruction at any time Once upon a time the mirror mentioned of his name was enough to keep children in line Parents is out in the maintain their power to make unilateral decisions often mentioned this hobgoblin If you don't do what I tell you do they caution the boogie man will get you or they would promise if you behave I won't let the boogie man get you Stritten with horrendous consequences youngsters rarely ask for specific details are proof of the monster's potential Rather most simply accepted as gospel at a force was out to destroy them and reacted accordingly Fitted an error on the side of being overly cautious than to ask logical questions and risk annihilation In actual politics these days that naive premise though insulting and condescending to an intelligent electorate Still being forced in unamerican public primarily because when confronted with problems we crave scapegoats and simplistic solutions Little one of that is a nation we're allowing ourselves to be manipulated more by our fears than guided by our consciousness consciousness For this election cycle our president is knowing that fear can cancel leads for logical explanations has targeted us for a terrifying boogie man who demands our full focus This monster president abortion sister Saddam Hussein although the terrorist that attacked us at her at home last September came mostly from Saudi Arabia And had allegiance primarily to Osama bin Laden our president and sister without first achieving a clear victory against those fanatics We must invade Iraq to give rid of Saddam Hussein and there's as to question that dictate as the at risk of being labeled unpaid Geoatic Undeniably the US was caught sleeping last 9-11 permanently traumatized by that tragedy where determined to be more vigilant So when our president tells us we need to attack Iraq we listen Apparently so the leaders of France and England having witnessed the terrorist assault upon the once-involvable America They first such attacks in their countries Thus by conscious Dana of our leaders foreign affairs have been placed at the top of America's political agenda for that so-called urgent reason Our domestic problems have been dismissed as frivolous the thoughtary and major corporation that has robbed many Americans of their life savings is no longer a major issue As concerns about economic conditions in this country and the need for improved guidelines to protect investors have been replaced by plans for war A high cost of drugs that has caused many senior citizens Either to stop taking need to need the medications or to take them only as affordable no longer is being debated And strategies to protect the environment the must serve humankind long after irax currently during our own leaders A lot of offices being ignored our president is declared to the nation in the world that prospect of war with Iraq must take precedence Of negligible concern we are told is allowing our forests to be stripped of more trees and our protected land and water Reserved to be plundered for oil to be placed in supply that would be disrupted by minis more war requires our sacrifice and scared to death Too many of us without questioning believe Trauma times by terrorism we prefer to believe in a booky man and evil without conscious a scapegoat in which we can focus all blame That concept of zal'sness of the need to think about the nefarious motives that compel self-serving men to act But in our rational moments errors that we've known is the brutal reality taught us by 911 modern warfare Can no longer be confined within the borders of any country nor can such conflict be limited to designated troops Modern war will accomplish soldiers and civilians in violence too massive to be extinguished easily by peace treaties in that context victory has little meaning W's conflict of interest rights one of our favorites marine dog many of your times yesterday Which a love marine yes, I do She says when George W Bush ran for president he mocked Bill Clinton's addiction to pollsters and promised to tear down the cynical White House Trollace of politics and policy as it turned out mr. Bush didn't need the president to campaign the permanent campaign He has something far more potent to permanent war Carl rovin w have designed a mirror image presidency They take everything poppy did the conservatives regard as a mistake and reverse it the right thought that the father's world was too short Okay, the sons of world will be too long the right thought that the father's worship ended with Sodom's disappearance Okay, the sons of world will start with Sodom's disappearance and build its rationale around that blessed event Like his dad mr. Bush is not keen on delving into tricky domestic issues like social security Healthcare and pension protection.

Let's take it over at any rate about the Carlisle group And the shady relationship with the brits Anyway fortunes her war wait bushes circle after attacks on Iraq is headlined the circle by Andrew Gumble and LA. He says the last time the United States went to war against Iraq Dick Cheney did very nicely from it having served as a fence secretary and fast in the reflected glory of the US military's Suppricingly rapid advance across the desert stands to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait He then managed to reap benefits of a very different time once the war was over and he left government to become chief executive of Halle Burton The Texas Base Oil Services Company when the United Nations relaxed his sanctions regime in 1998 and permitted Iraq to buy spare parts for its oil fields It was Halle Burton under Mr. Cheney's leadership that cleaned up on the contract to repair war damage and you get Sodom's oil pipes slowing in full capacity again Two Halle Burton subsidiaries that business worth almost twenty four million dollars with the man whom these days Mr. Cheney calls a murderous dictator in the world's worst leader Since taking over his George Bush's vice president Mr. Cheney has severed all formal ties with his former employer notably when he cashed in thirty six million dollars in stock options and other benefits At the height of the market in August 2000 but Halle Burton currently struggling with a corporate accounting scandal that may or may not implicate Mr. Cheney could profit all over again if the much threatened new war against Iraq comes to pass which it will We can certainly expect more air strikes against the world fields possibly combined with a ground invasion Then when it's all over someone's gonna have to mop up the damage once again Halle Burton with its previous experience in unparalleled political connections Now limited to Mr. Cheney would be in the pull position for the job Nobody could justify the accused abortion administration wind wage war in Iraq solely is a favorite with friends of the world business and the military and industrial complex But many of the companies that stand again most from a war in joy remarkably close ties to senior figures in the administration And some of the president's closest confidence of shown extraordinary elasticity down the years in their attitudes to president saw it I'm America's on again off again public enemy number one Mr. Cheney has gone from more longer to deal maker in fact a warm-end resist one example Donald Rumsfield occurred to fence secretary as repeatedly raised the specter of Iraq's arsenal of weapons and mass destruction But in 1983 when Mr. Rumsfeld was president Reagan special envoy to Iraq he turned a blind eye to a rack of use of nerve and mustard gas and it's war with Iran Concentrating instead on forging a personal relationship with the Iraqi leader then considered a valuable US ally Mr. Rumsfield was actually in fact that on the day do you and first reported Iraqi use of chemical weapons but chose to remain silent as did the rest of the US establishment Five years later he said it is ability to make friends with Sodom who sent his one of his qualifications for a possible run at the presidency This Bush administration has been much more upfront about the role of oil and deliberations on Iraq than the last one That's partly matter of circumstance since the 911 attacks the stability of Middle Eastern oil states has been a big policy consideration But it also reflects the fact that much of the Bush inner circle including the president himself is made up of former oilman The oil and gas industry has pumped about 50 million dollars to political candidates since the 2000 election There are also uncomfortably cozy ties between the government and the defense industry Mr. Rumsfeld's oldest friend Frank Carlucci a former defense secretary himself Now heads the Carlisle group an investment consortium which has a big interest in the contracting firm united defense Carlisle board includes George Bush senior in James Baker the former secretary of state one program alone the crusader artillery system As are in Carlisle more than two billion dollars in advance government contracts Carlisle European chairman is John Major who may have played a major role in the Ministry of Defense's controversial recent decision to declare Carlisle the preferred bitter for stake in its scientific research division That's a strad with talking about none of these links is legal it is illegal, but that doesn't mean that there's no conflict of interest Messers Bush, Cheney and friends have either sold their stock holdings or put them in a blind trust meaning personal gain is off the agenda Again for their friends and family may well be a byproduct of the looming war against Iran Oh, it says your imagination, Neil After all you're so anti-bush anti-bush anti-bush Trans16 votes on our survey, how do you feel about GW's plans to invade Iraq?

She didn't play Pittsburgh and a jet So we're supposed to be too pretty goddamn good teams in these two weeks As opposed to the two girls teams that often play even George knows that. George could be the lions. Yeah, just by yourself. Gate couple moves in next to Falwell's Church to preach acceptance. Oh, and this week I mentioned to you off the you're how come I haven't talked about it on here because I got too much stuff here. Yeah, on the city confidential on A&E. I guess I already saw watch A&E because if they did, I would have had a Facts by now for sure about the piece they did Saturday night. Now last night did it about Madeline on hearing her family kind of like disappearing. Yeah, disappearing. It was pretty interesting about Austin Texas and how the right wingers are moving in there now. Why used to be a very liberal wide open city is now becoming, but anyway, so certainly the thing was about Doug Danzig or And the willows is Kathy Willows and Jeff and there was Dr. Kennedy was on there as spot and his usual crap as usual anti-human crap. And they had the guy, what else the guy's name who invented who started Spring Break out of a chubby old guy's got to he always word this silly cap with that one of those woolly birds on top with else his name. Well, then any break they had a piece about the the willows on Saturday on city confidential on A&E. See how soon we forget. Well, here right in line with that gay couple moves in next to Falwell's church to preach acceptance. A gay activist and his partner moved across the street from the Reverend Jerry Falwell's church in Lynchburg, Virginia, hoping to correct what they see is the misinformation the past has been spreading about home-o-sexuals. We just want to let's bring the see us and old gay couple and realize that was boring as they are said the Reverend Mel White 62, a minister with a met volunteer community church in LA who goes to role models out of biography. White and Falwell have been acquaintances for more than 15 years before white announced his homosexuality and have since debated Falwell's belief that some gaze can be turned straight. When Falwell partially blamed the 911 attacks on Gaze last year, White City was disappointed that his old friend become so dogmatic and started planning a trip to Lynchburg. Jerry promised to tone down his anti- gay rhetoric, what he said, it broke our hearts to see what he was doing. Falwell, who later apologized for his usually in tempered comments, and even was rubbing his thinking winky doll, said white's move from across the road from the Thomas Road Baptist church is a publicity stunt meant to harass his ministry. But the couple he said is always welcome into church. I can't think of anyone who needs it more Falwell said, Mel White abandoned his wife children and parents to move in with his mayor lover. I hope he turns his life around or turns his wife around. White moved into the forum cottage on Tuesday with Gary Nixon 52 and their dog Bentley, the two who stole a home in Laguna Beach, California signed a one year lease, signed a spend their time visiting with their new neighbors and exploring the city's many parks. We love it. We never lived in a place where the leaves changed White said. Never lived in a place where the leaves changed. Yes. Like right here, looking at this, I feel it changed right now. And October members of White Tacitus Group's sole force will join a couple to restart a local parent's former lesbian's engaged champion go door to door to door to their mother and daughter. We had a couple of months ago. We talked about homosexuality from October 25 to 7. Hundreds of sole force members are expected to arrive in this group to mark the three year anniversary of a nineteen ninety-nine meeting with Falwell. Now we are your neighbors not just in spirit but in fact white said a dinner invitation. He handed handle over to Falwell's office this week. Carol church 56 went white in a service black week of the first Christian church city. He was a church church church church church church church church church church happy white will challenge Falwell and his home community. How do you like that? 157 at 560 WQM. We got managed to one.

And I thought like go in there and actually see somebody because he was too sick to do that. And they got back to him like hours and hours and hours later and so just why you really should go to the Emperor all the time. They call back at 530 like as an afterthought. Like we're closing the doctor couldn't get to you. Your doctor blocked you. Your doctor blows. But just like online detective blows. Anyway, here's the big news and I've saved it for this big new to one hour. One to new hour. Pant is a reener renamed the office depot center. There's a big story of the day.

Mission going to rest more an issue for rest priest and Hawaii. And a rest ward has been issued in Michigan for a former Roman Catholic priest living in Hawaii who charged with criminal sexual conduct. Robert Berkholder 82 of Leeward Oahu was charged August 27 with two counts of secondary criminal sexual conduct. He's accused of assaulting a 13 year old Detroit area boy in 1986. In Detroit. The war for Berkholder's arrest was issued Friday for the Detroit news. He's going to be arrested over the next several days. Douglas Baker with Epidic chief assistant Wayne County prosecutor told the paper. And a recent interview with the news. Berkholder McDonald's having sexual relationship with up to two dozen boys as young as 11. Isn't this interesting here? So in other words, the stories were the ages of the boys. Seems to be very, very young. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. We just got carried away. Berkholder said of the 13 year old boy. He might have been lonely and priest are lonely persons too. He needs friendships and kids love priests. I weakened. I was looking for affection and popped an erection or something like that. Wayne County prosecutor Michael Dougan is granted Berkholder one of the worst pedophiles we ever seen in this day. Berkholder's attorney Irving Turkal of Tukal. See you, KEL Irving Tukal of Bingham Farms to the climb. His client has dementia. Too much of that funny business. What up, my own boys? Is that what they said in the godfather? Something like that. Too much comedy. Too much comedy, but I'm young boys. Tukal said he played a lot for a competency exam in Hawaii. A movie that Wayne County prosecutors are not contesting. Let me ask you about this in the plan. You watch them, sure last night? Of course. Now was the one last night where they out on the snow with a guy that they were going to blow away. And he got away? No. That's an old one. Yes. See, I'm watching because these are the ones that are on Irving night. And I can't forget the life of me. I don't know what that's all about. So I would assume that the new one would have been on that channel. But it wasn't. I watched for about five minutes. And that part of the movie seemed like a rip off. What was that other? The Miller Miller's crossing. Was that it? Okay. Surely took the guy. I mean, it was no snow in that movie, but they took them. Right. I don't know. To me, it's like a poor. It's kind of like a mishmosh of a poor man's godfather. The Miller's crossing. It's like a funny thing. With a lot of four letter words. Which is the only reason that you want the first season so that you can actually understand what's going on and then you'll understand it. Oh, there's the picture that been out. Sheep guy. Nice head year. Man. Black leaders want Leahy out. Stung by what they believe is evidence of further disenfranchisement in last Tuesday's election. National and local black leaders tend to take action against the economy officials. If they don't remove election supervisor, they would let he be for the November election. See their risk because they're saying again that we're disenfranchised. This can't keep happening to one group of people. And no one sees this and doesn't deliberately said, Bishop, all Bishop Victor Curry minister and community leader. And you know what is beside those two things? What he is. He's an asshole. Why people? Cubans, everybody should be mad. He says, even Cubans. Curry on Friday said he'd fight against the transit tax proposal on the November 5th Bellat and groups including the NAACP, the Democratic Black caucus and people that had to leave the struggle for equality, thought to take legal action of changes or not made the elections department. And he's right. Curry said it was used as WMBM radio program on their 10-watt station to campaign against a proposed sales tax to fund a $17 billion expansion mass transit in the county. The taxes, the brain child of Mayor Pinguipakini who says it's finalries congestion improved quality of life in the county. Curry said, Penalis placed a higher priority on that than on insurance citizens can vote. What's more important to the citizens and other tax protection that we never benefited from or making sure our constitutional rights are in place. Victor Curry said, we're going to ensure that every squirrel sooner later finds a nut because he's got his thumb right on it. The also said he would start a countywide petition drive for Lehi's removal. Curry hopes that thousands of signatures will convince Tinga Picania. County manager Steve Shiver and commissioners that Lehi must go. Let's hear it. We want the Saudi deal stop now. However, that I was talking about that in Friday for the 10 of us who saw the movie network. Isn't that ironic another part of the ingenious Opaddy Traskey being 30 years ahead of his time. And here was the Saudis. Remember they were needy for they were up to their own pits and telegrams. Yep. They were sucking telegrams at the White House because the Howard Veal. And poor Robert Duval Frank Hackett was having an interest breakdown. Right. Because Saudi Arabia was taken over. They were buying out one of the four major networks in the US. The Saudis, baby. And then of course I think back to that 60 minutes piece. Remember it's many months ago. Sure. And they showed that Saudi sheek that son of a bitch and they're watching CNBC. There's the stock ticker going on all these things. And all these people lined up to kiss his ring and kiss his ass. Right. They get together so they can bow down and kiss him.

And actually, if you've indicated Chicago, Tribing columnist Bob Green. Did you realize that Bob Green had a sexual thing going on? Um, not that one. Oh, resign after acknowledging he engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with a teenage girl the newspaper said yesterday. In a note on the paper, Sprunt page editor Ann Emery Lepinsky said Green ignores the sexual conduct with a girl in her late teens whom whom he met in connection with his column. Green 55 told the AP in an email Sunday. There have been indiscretions in my life that I'm not proud of. He didn't address the conduct. I'll enter his resignation. I don't have the words to express this sadness. I feel Green wrote. I'm very sorry for anyone I've let down. I'm including the readers who for so long meant so much further. Discuss the matter. Today, I need to be with my family and loved ones. He wrote Green has written extensively on social issues in American life and columns that appeared in the Tribune four times a week and were syndicated for newspapers around the country. Kind of like a Doug Dan's a good thing. Here's speaking of that. Remember Doug Dan's a girl was like never forget. No, yeah, big big crusader, big flag waiver like for D.C. and morality and then we'll big day with a corroborage president to re-insure. He was waving it. In 1998 Green was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for columns on local children whose lives were mishandled by the judicial welfare systems. He's also written several books and provided commentary on Tribune on WGN TV. Home of the Cubs. Home of the Cubs and they still suck. Green's behavior was a serious violation of Tribune ethics and standards for a serialist of Pinsky wrote in Sunday's editions. We deeply regret we're regret the conduct. It's effect on a young woman in the impact that disclosure was had on the trust our readers placed in Green and his newspaper. The Tribune first heard the allegations after receiving an anonymous complaint last week. Prompting an inquiry by editors and other Tribune officials of Pinsky wrote. The conduct occurred some years ago, she said. Green was suspended by the paper which then saw his resignation. He submitted it Saturday night. Gary Whiteman, a spokesman for Tribune company said the news paper would have no further comment. Here's this story again. We've had it before but it keeps the rearing its lovely head. Nevada voters may legalize marijuana. They're going to want up with the same thing that on you weren't here when we had this there about Santa Cruz. They had a free pot. A free pot day is a protest of the federal government. Remember we had the stir about they rated the legal cannabis to a joint stir. Right. The medical marijuana places. And the DEA went in there and they rated them even though they have local ordinances and statewide ordinance that permit the growing of medical marijuana. And so now we may have another contact on the DEA. I'm here to watch this very carefully. Nevada voters may legalize marijuana. Nevada they love gambling and tolerate prostitution. Now they're talking about legalizing pot. I'm right. I measure on a ballot of member Fitt will make Nevada the first state to allow adults to possess marijuana up to three ounces and up maybe a hundred joint. People over 21 would be allowed to smoke in their homes. See and here in Canada they're talking about 16 legalization. 16 Nevada they're talking people over 21 would be a, oh you know what the legal drinking age is here? 18. 19. Okay. 21. 19. People over 21 would be allowed to smoke in their homes but not in cars of pubic places. Probably sold in state license mode shops and tax like cigarettes. This initiative will allow the police to spend more time going after murderers, rapeers and other violent criminals said Billy Rogers later the group that's pushing the measure whether would actually take effect as federal law, banned, marriage, we need to position the White House to come out strongly against the idea. Also Nevada voters would have to approve the proposal again in 2004 before came law. In other words, on the ballot in 2004 would say, are you sure? Yeah, there have to be a line there. Are you sure? Right. Nevada home of the nation's gambling capital has long had a fondness for what others forbid although prostitutions banned in Las Vegas, Reno Carson City in a 49 state. It is legal intent of Nevada's 17 counties. The 30 license brothers are in the state are monitored by the state health division. An addition, Vegas says a multitude of out-call entertainment services that are thought to be fronts for call girl businesses. Thought to be. But to vote on marijuana representing remarkable about face and Nevada's attitude towards pot. A year ago in Nevada have more than a strictest marijuana laws. Possession of a single joint was a felony published by a year or more in prison. In 2000, Nevada voters approved the use of medical marijuana and the legislature voted in 2000 to make possession of less than an ounce of pot a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a thousand dollar five. Opinion pulls on the marijuana measures on a vadins almost evenly split with opponents gaining ground. What measure are we sending our youth at this initiative passes that it's okay to take drugs, hit school counselor Teresa Jempsa. If marijuana becomes legal and much drug is next, the plan was put on the November ballot after the group led by Rogers Nevada's for responsible enforcement candidate necessary 75,000 signatures. She and South Florida were voting again on, you know, should we take Fag right away and there they're voting on something like a little more progressive. Moving forward a little bit even though it's taken him a whole long time. And in South Florida, moving backward, backward, that's the word for South Florida. Asked backward, which is why we can't get a goddamn election done right. Ever, ever, never, and it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. Terminies for and secret service BND voiced out to any Western intelligence reports that have warned of Iraq's advanced weapons advanced destruction program. The daily Berliners Zeitthong said that the harranking BND official is saying in Berlin last Thursday, acknowledging that Iraq was in fact continuing to develop its weapons advanced destruction program. The official noted let us doubt whether these programs are nearing a successful conclusion. The official added the all-away rack order to you and arms inspect it. Leave the country 98. The BND is still managed to obtain a lot of information on Iraq's weapons program. According to a 1999 BND report, Iraq would be capable of reaching the technological level of a 1990 arms program, which included a remarkable nuclear infrastructure. Huh? That last sentence is kind of like, you know, it's less like hanging there. They would be they could be, but they're not close. It's basically what it boils down to. Are they close?

They want to really like it. When they actually do go to Italy and how the Italian talk about them. Yeah, you would love that. I really know how they've batted in what I'm about that. You would chuckle the deaf feeling. In fact, he batted in the hook and muscle of number one Carlos Buffon, Julan. In Channel 7. Is there anything he's saying? What are the Italians saying? And we thought the Germans would take. Robert Fisk, America's case for war has built on blindness, hypocrisy, and lies. George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld are willing to ignore the realities of the Middle East. The result can only be catastrophic. Great. Robert Fisk in the independent, other Brit paper. Years ago, in a snug underground restaurant in downtown Tehran, drinking duke, the UK. Do you do it? Do you queue? And Iranian beverage of mint and yogurt. Sautam Hussein's former head of nuclear research told me what happened when he made a personal appearance. Why? I'll just die justing that. Mint and yogurt. Sautam Hussein's former head of nuclear research told me what happened when he made a personal appearance for the release of a friend from prison. I was taken directly from my bag that office to the director of state security. He said, I was thrown down the stairs to an underground cell and stripped and crushed up on a wheel attached to the ceiling. Send the director came to see me. You will tell us all about your friends everything you said. And your field of research, you are an expert at my field of research. I'm the best man. That's when the whipping in the electrodes began. All this happened, of course, when Sautam Hussein was still our friend. When we were encouraging him to go on telling Iranians in his 1980-88 war against Iran. When he was government under President Bush Sr. was giving a report. He was giving a report for a financial agricultural assistance funding. Not long before Sautam's piloted part of missile in the American warship called the Stark and almost sunk it, pilot error claims Sautam. The mercenessal had been mistaken for an Iranian oil tanker and the US government cheerfully forgave the Iraqi dictator. Those were the days. But sitting in the UN General Assembly last week watching Bush Jr. tell us with all his text and passion about the beatings and the whippings and the rapes in Iraq, you would have thought they'd just been discovered. We're sure, brazen, historical hypocrisy that would have been difficult to beat that part of President's speech. Saddam had appears to him into a bad guy when he invaded Kuwait in 1990. Before that, he was just a loyal ally of the US as a strong man as the news agency boys like to crawl our dictators rather than a tyrant. But the real eye in the President's speech, that which is dominated American political discourse into the crimes against humanity, a 9-11 last year, was the virtual absence of any attempt to explain the real reasons while the US has fought itself under attack. In his vendacious article in this newspaper last week, President Bush's defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld also attempted to mask this reality. These September 11th assault, he announced was an attack on people who believe in freedom who practiced tolerance and who defend the inaliable rights of man. He made his usual absolutely no reference to the Middle East to America's woeful bias policies in that region, to its ruthless support for Arab dictators who do its bidding for Saddam Hussein, for example at a time when the head of Iraqi nuclear research was undergoing his cavalry. Not in order to America's military presence in the holiest of Muslim lands, in order with unconditional support for Israel's occupation of Palestinian land in the West Bank and Gaza. Oddly a very faint ghost of this reality did creep into the start of the President who ended with a dress last week. It was contained in two sentences whose importance was totally ignored by the American press and whose true meaning might have been lost amidst abortion itself, giving that he didn't write his speech, but it was revealing nonetheless. Our common security he said is challenged by regional conflicts, ethnic and religious strife that is ancient and but not inevitable. In the Middle East there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides, then he repeated his old line about the need for an independent and democratic Palestine. This was perhaps as close as we've gotten so far to an official admission that this whole terrible crisis is about the Middle East. If this is a simple war for civilization against evil, the line that Mr. Bush was so coolly peddling against these survivors of 9-11 and the victims' relatives last week, then one of these regional challenges, lighted Palestine in, in, in sinewated way into the text of President Bush's UN speech. Needless to say, this strange and comfortable little truth was of no interest in the American Washington media, whose willful refutes will investigate the real political causes of this whole catastrophe as led to a news coverage that is his bizarre as it is schizophrenic. Before dawn on 9-11 last week I watched six American TV channels and saw the twin-towers fall to the ground 18 times. The few references to the suicide killers who committed the crime may not a single mention the fact that they were Arabs. Last week, the Washington Post and the New York Times went to agonizing lengths to separate their Middle East coverage from the 9-11 September commemorations as they might be committing some form of sacralage or reacting in bad taste if they did not. The challenge for the administration to offer a coherent and persuasive explanation of how the Iraq danger is connected to the 9-11 attacks is about as far as the Washington Post got in smelling Iraq, and that only dropped into the 7-perg of an 8-perg ref in a tutorial. All references to Palestine are illegal to a settlement or Israeli occupation of Arab land were simply erased from the public conscience last week. When Hanan Arshwari, the most humane of Palestine in women tried to speak in Colorado University on 9-11, Jewish groups organized a massive demonstration against her. U.S. television simply did not acknowledge the Palestinian tragedy. It's a tribute to her own reporting that at least John Pooja's trench in program, Palestine is still the issue as being shown on ITV that's in Britain tomorrow night all that the disgracefully late time of 11-05 PM. But maybe all this no longer matters. When Mr. Rumsfeld complained so outrageously as he did when asked for proof of Iraq's nuclear potential that the absence of evidence doesn't mean the evidence of absence, we might as well end all moral debate. When Mr. Rumsfeld refers to the so-called occupied West Bank, he reveals himself to be a very disreputable man. When he advances the policy of a preemptive act of war as he did in the independent on Sunday last week, he forgets Israel's preemptive 1982 invasion of Lebanon which caused 17,500 Arab lives and 20 years of occupation and it didn't retreat and military defeat for Israel. Strange things are going on in the Middle East right now. Arab military intelligence reports to the shifting of mass of U.S. arm shipments around the region, not just to got her in Kuwait, but to the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean. American and military is, as Israeli military planners and intelligence analysts are said to have met twice in Tel Aviv to discuss the potential outcome of the next Middle East war. The destruction of Sodom and the breakup of Saudi Arabia likely scenario for rat crumbles have long been to Israeli dreams. As the West discovered during its fruitful period of neutrality between 1939 and 41, war crimes the pumps of the economy, is that what's going on today the preparation of a war to reflote the West economy? My Israeli colleague Amir Ahas once defined the mehar job as journalists, the monitor the centers of power. Never has been so important for us to do just that for if we fail will become the mouthpiece of power. So a few thoughts for the coming weeks. Remember the days when Sodom was America's friend. Remember that Arabs committed the crimes against humanity, 9-11 last year, and if they came from a place called the Middle East, a place of injustice and occupation and torture. Remember Palestine, remember that a year ago no one spoke of Iraq, only of Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and I suppose remember that evil is a good crowd for, but a mighty hard enemy to shoot down with the missile. Wow. Yeah, kind of hard to shoot that evil down with the missile, ain't it? That's 20-1 at 5-60 WQA, and most of the, well not most, but a lot of the good articles are in the bread papers, yes indeed, because they don't have to panorist much correct. 20-1 we got the mad dog coming along who's going to rave about that big dog and went against the Indianapolis culture yesterday who can't, we just don't have a watch, they don't have a clock, that's the problem.
