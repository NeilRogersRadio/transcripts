In fact, your friend Richard Beather, he had one day last week, he had a seriously hit a woman on there that had breast-to-size of watermelon. I'm not exaggerating. I have, she could barely stand up. Forget about walks. She could barely in fact, her, unless she looked like you a little bit, only in different places. Well, thank you so much, Cheryl. I want to tell you, do you know how? Hello, Cheryl. How are you? It can be true. Cheryl is not only Jewish, but she happens to run this entire radio station. Nobody knows that yet, but without Cheryl, we couldn't function here. Okay, seriously, that's the gut, and she looks absolutely ravishing by the way, she does. She does. And oh, he left refills open on here, so I can write in like 25. At a boy, Joshua, that's my pill boy. It's my buddy. So anyway, this is the best. This is so good, this pizza chef, man, it's just like spastic. And Al, of course, arrived just only moments before the food came. I followed the truck. Yeah, I believe it. You probably followed trucks all over town. So he brought in nine muffins. What are you doing about this? Are you going to do something about this? Is there actually our people out there who like you? I mean, I'm not a dog. I didn't know a Caroline, I just placed it. I can't do it here. You need to know. You don't need to die. You need to shrink, is what you need. You have mental illness. I mean, a man with your fame and money should not suffer from, I mean, how are you set a problem? You know, he'd look like what how he turned out. My fingernails are not as long as his. No, but no, I need a lockup. I didn't. Well, you don't want to get, but the church said, too. Yeah. I'm running it then because I'm running in Pompano for office. So I'm back in politics. Oh, you're back on that. Yeah, I'm fine. Why not? You get a lot of females away. You get freemales. Why did you just come to work here on the weekend? Do like a pornographic talk show? Can they be an inferior? Very inferior. And you get fed free all weekend. That is a pill. No, seriously. Since I saw you on Tom Snyder, his only maybe two, three weeks ago on that was that that was taped, right? No, it was locked. It was locked. Well, that's right because you were taking calls. Yeah. I was in there. There was that one bitch that I was very offended by. I guess he was upset because Tom had you on the show. Yeah, she'll never just turn it off. He was just upset that thank you, Cheryl. She was just hysterical that he had you on. It's that because he was such he's got this goody two shoes image with that phony. And he's a phony. That's what Pompano's me about Tom. Oh, get out of here. You remember years ago he had on his old show, he had Madeleine Mariao here's Renegade son. The one that found God all of a sudden. He had that son on the ear. And he says to him after this conversation about this and the old bag and he says, well, welcome back. You know, you found the Lord. And everybody that knows Tom's there tells me he's a flaming hit the ass just like I am an all-errorist. There you go. He's a phony. See, I don't go for that. He's wrong. It's one thing for a to-do show business, but another thing to come out like that. And so that would be like you coming on and saying you knew a straight priest. Yeah. Yeah, I had a straight priest. Yeah, right. Exactly. I believe that. Okay, let me see. We got to keep doing bricks here, which is good. It's food breaks. We need to be because in order to make just a maintain that way. Can you imagine? Seriously, I want everybody to stop at a imagine how much food somebody has to eat. To maintain the kind of weight that this man is building and expand on it because you are expanding rapidly. But 12,000 calories just to maintain. Right. And so there's like about 20,000 there. So by the time you get to the ballpark, how many seats did you have to buy? How many rows did you have to buy to sit your fan asked on her at your robby state? They're going to have to drop this man down in a crane. This is the only man who will attend the opening day in a Marlons to be dropped from a crane. So when you see this gigantic thing being lowered into its seats, you'll know it's the famous L and be dropping free screw magazines out for everybody. Unbelievable. Pizza scoop away. Yeah, it is. Have another piece. 11, 23 on the IOD network. If you have to miss any of today's show live from 10 to 2, remember you can join me for the best of Neil again tonight from 6 till 8 on news talk radio 6, 20 WSU This is news talk radio 6, 20 WSU and 11, 27. You want to repeat the conversation we just had to break? No, that's not. No, but I was talking about the food of the city. I'm talking about the one we just had here about. I don't think it about the thing. Yeah. Oh God, this is how he's always thinking about eating something. This man out there. Oh God. Yeah. So anyway, L is going out to Joe Robby state. He'd never been there before. Never been there. And I said they have great hot-fudge Sundays. If somebody's going to have to call George, somebody, because we got a couple of openings there because they're getting pissed off. But seriously, somebody will call in and let us know if the marlins are going to have the same concession stuff that they had for the dolphins for the marlins. I would assume so. Because I think those places by their way in to the stadium. No matter what the event is going on there. So anyway, they do have Carvelle Stanzer there. And you can get a hot-fudge Sunday with not just a regular hot-fudge Sunday. I'm chocolate ice cream, of course, not on Medellit because chocolate is much richer and much more calories. But with cherries and strawberries and like strawberry sauce on top of the hot-fudge. And if that isn't at least 5000 calories. Well, well, I need that. So you need that first because that sends your blood sugar at L of Aates into at least a thousand and then after that nothing will make any deal. He missed the point. Is a seven-dening stretch when I want to do some exercise. I have to make the lure I can take. In fact, that is my exercise. I want to have a take with a seven-dening stretch. And that would be the extent because most exercise takes too much time and there's too much sweat. Too much expenditure. So if you just do seven-dening exercises, I could do the chop. Yeah, I could do the chop. You can wait from your- you're looking very good shape from the elbow forward. Your next one shape. If I bought a little finger tips. Well, I pull my stomach in like, go, it's- it's a wave. You would be great. In fact, let's fire dolphin Denny's ass and make Al the new mascot for the dolphins. I don't need an outfit. God, all right. You could just bounce your ass out around on it and feel like incredible. Maybe, in fact, he'd order the heat auto sign up. You could just bounce your ass all over the court. Now, what you do look like a huge walking ball. What was the of the schmoo? Remember the schmoo? I love the schmoo. The ass. The schmoo. You look like a schmoo that's been blown up all the way around. You really do. What are you laughing about? It's not funny. What are we going to do? You started telling us that you're going to order to a liner for another quack. You're going on the right side now? Well, yeah. Yeah. But you don't do it. Are you going to do it? They didn't even want to do it. You're going up there. But I'm going to be sin and beautiful and I'm going to be crucible and I'm going to be available. And I'm going to be a big hunk. Yeah. And I'm going to be Peter North tomorrow too. I'm going to wake up and I'm going to look at the mirror and surprise. I'm going to get a penal in plant. I'm going to do everything. I'm going to do it like the one that you wanted. I did. I'll be doing too many shows with Mr. Eagle over there. I think he been on the cane show too many times. I don't do it. I don't even talk to him. Really? Yeah. He didn't even have the courtesy of calling. Seeing how I'm doing after the divorce. To me, that's not a friend. Oh, I should have known he was a schmock. I mean, I got to be a, you know, you learned the hard way. I'll never, to be a little slow. I really am. I'm a schmock. I would have defended him. But I never again. He's a puts. Let him let him in. And, you know, and Nick Navarro. You know, you enjoyed it the hip by the way. Bestieality. All the losers get your children's going to have friend Harald or, you know, say, Yeah. Another fredding pathetic. So, what is a screw going to do with thing on Jay Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson? That's what I thought that's good. We did it when he was alive. Did you? Anyone? We did it. I might, my first arrest. We had an article, the Jay Edgar Hoover, a faggot. I did it arrested twice. Are you serious? Where did I? 1969. It's easy now to do it. I did it when he was alive. Yeah. Well, that's the one I raised the book came out. Now is because he's dead. Yeah. He makes Queens look bad, doesn't he? Yeah. Quite a book. Did you read the book? No, but I know you've been carrying on the father. You have to read the book. I read the excerpts on it. Can you imagine all the snacks that you get while you're reading that book? It's about a 500 page book. Can you balance it on the page? And then the exposat out 60 minutes on the priest? Oh, that's the best of all. Yeah. That's unbelievable. What about the AIDS rate for Catholic priests? And polls by 10%. Mm-hmm. Yeah. How many rapists are pedophiles? Very few, right? Because they're not celibate. Well, I don't think that's it. I think it's primarily because they have the to fill in and the tallest knowledge stuff gets in a way and they can't, they can't, you know, they give up after while. Oh, it's a two full and then he have all that small stuff. Yeah, that's, I think you are, um, how was the, especially on Passover? A great stereotype for Jews. Because Jews traditionally have been much, and that's why there are so few Jews in the world because they were never big on reproduction like Catholics. Yeah. Because, or especially like the reanals, look at them for the whole time. Yeah, they're almost all skinny and they're like a billion's up because they're big on reproduction. Jews that was like a mandatory thing. Like just keep the family going and have one or two kids at the most, but eating was much more of a big thing. Eating is everything. I mean, it should think when people talk to me about, oh, you're the publishers screw, you must go from Felicia to this to that, the colleague, as I say no. No, I go from stuff there with the highest astronomy. I mean, I never have had a sex fantasy. I have fantasies such as I own the Carnegie Dellies. I'll tell you one thing, after that thing you did, the movie with Gloria Leonard, that would eliminate anybody's sex fantasies anyway, that would turn everybody off. Well, that was good. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, functioned in a point of film. How many guys can say that? With the bull die, like that, turn on us. But anyway, I didn't say that. Did I? No, I didn't. It didn't mean it. No, it is true though, isn't it? Well, bye, she's by. Oh, okay. In other words, she wants that she's got a bite. Yeah. So you fantasize about food alive? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, hugged. The, the hugged and I was playing this extras. Get me so excited to think of a close shower. Have you had the, the, the, the caramel cone crunch, a peanut butter burst? You took it by just kind of north. Okay. Yes. I'm talking food. And that's why you can't eat it. You can't eat it. Did you really eat the nine muffins? I eat three. Yeah. Because you have to have something to do with the long lines. What was the story with your divorce? Because he used to bring that little abit. He had a round here all the time. He had my little dog on a leash. Yeah. That's what he really are cleaning woman. She's swear to God. She cleaned the pot, and she wrote me a letter. She's just a gold egg. Because the chicks have got a rich fat you and figured she's poor. Yeah. And then she take it to the cleaners. Good or what? She's trying. But I have a pre-nupsual. I learned, you know, if the, if the, if the, if the, if the, if the, I've never noticed that you're learning. I mean, never married anybody who has more troubles than you. Disfunctional family's fall down drunk fathers. You know, you don't, uh, get involved with people. Always that attracted you. She worshiped me. I should have known that was an indication of insanity. Yeah. Needing serious health. Yeah. In the little pick. The, the, the picture. So was her health scenario. Yeah. It was really nutty. Which is a closest she was ever going to come with you. With you on the, um, other end. Yeah. We never had sex. I should have known. You were right. I should have, I should have been chewed up a bit. What do you mean you never had sex? Well, we had sex never. Actually, we had it seven times. And you were married for, for how long? Three years. Ha ha ha ha. Based on the pre-nupsual. The king of sex folks, but that, that gives that, yeah. Oh, no, no, I'm dysfunctional. I've learned now. It's been a time when they were probably like, uh, three or four of them in the first year. It was, it was, it was, it was three the first year. Yeah. And it was two months before. Four, two year for the next two year. That's why I got fat. I, I, I, I switched to food. I mean, that's what I think. I mean, that's what I think. You've been fighting fat your whole life. Is there a cure? You know there isn't. Two hour dying day. We will be obsessed with food. Yeah, but, then, right. Do I look like the shade? No, you're one, not as fat as the sea. Actually, you're, you're a little quarter. You know why? A little, yeah, I'm not skinny. Yeah, I'm not a pound over. You don't look like a. 25 pounds. If I long, you look like I, I'd look like Peter Nore. Yeah. From the, a weight up. I was a bag over my head and the rest of my body. But seriously, if I lost 25 pounds for me, I'd be in great shape. Okay. But the thing is, when you get health, see nothing alarms you evidently. Because I had a little stroke. Yeah. See, that was a warning, eyes. Yeah. So, I had the thing with a gall bladder. I had that out of thought I was dying when they took that out. Then I had a gall bladder. We're attacking without the gall bladder. I had to go back in the hospital. I've been through a crappy couple of years. Yeah. You finally say to yourself, you know, like, I can eat this now. But I'll compensate later in the day. I won't have like a big meal. Where'd I get night? Do you know how to deal with it? No. And only on the nights when I go to the track, I have something there. I'm trying to cut that way back. But other than that, on other nights, I don't even eat dinner. Yeah. You sound like a scared. You have to cut out. You're not a sweetie. I love ice cream. I mean, ice cream is what I obsess over. Yeah. Well, you never got hooked on. What were those damn things I was eating? Those drumsticks. Yeah. Drumsticks. Did you retry those? No. With the ice cream drumsticks. Yeah. Oh, great. That's what you meant really. No. Drumsticks. Ice cream drumsticks. Did you shove them right in? And when you go to the supermarket, see, when you go to the convenience store, it's no good because you can buy one at a time. I used to get them two at a time. Because between the convenience store and my house was just enough time need to. In the car. In the car. But if you go to the supermarket, you have to buy them in a box of like a dozen. See, you can eat 12. And I would take them home like on a Saturday morning. I'd go to win a taxi. I'd buy the box of a dozen. And by the end of the weekend, they all be gone. All of them. Yeah. Well, that's what happens. Because they're different kinds of the ones that have like the caramel cream in the center. Then there was that are like the chocolate on chocolate. They're like three different kinds. What do you laugh at? Did I see you getting a rose? No, I'm not around. You're the one that's getting a rose. You're sweating again. You're red in a face. And you're sweating again. You need to be locked up somewhere. You were right when you said that. You need to be locked up. I do. I do. And they just. Is it a death wish? Or is it no? I do wish. It's it's it's being a two. Is that it? Being a two. Is it food? Always. Overcompensating for the famine that might come. You know what I'm right? In other words, if Bush would have got elected again, you're still been a good shape. Right. If they sent us to summer camp. I would outlive you. You got an extra hundred pounds. Right. You would die the 19th day. I would die the 400th day. Yeah. Feeding with my fat. Beautiful. Why don't we have like a naked picture of Algo's seeing on a front of the next thing. I'm telling you, you'd sell like a hundred times as many copies. These are probably like by the whole world up with the money you'd get from the first of their people. Fritz, what the the people have to be larger. Yeah. Oh, just just make it this way instead of that way. He's printed a horizontal instead of vertical. Okay. Let's talk about your favorite binge with food. After we do this break. We do have a lot of spots on it. This isn't like Tom Snyder on CNBC. Where it's like basically public television pretending to be a real show. I mean, who the hell watches CNBC? Did you have any response from that show? Three. Three friends. It's 11.38 on the IOD network. Randy Rhodes is here tonight. 7 to 11 on news talk radio 620 WSUN. Oh, look. It's Grace. Hi, Randy. Hi. Hey, your program was a fanfare. Oh, you don't have to suck up to me too. Do you? I'm here. Stop it. I don't have a chance in hell of surviving a tamp-up. Surprise. They even called us to turn the satellite on tonight. When Terry called to turn the satellite on, I was really quite shocked. You know, it gets me mad. Oh, it's a doctor's mother day. And this guy from the pier, gone. Was it a gynecologist? No, you're not. Oh, you're not. Oh, you're not. I think I can't throw it. Okay, same shape table, yeah. Anyway, this year of pier, got me, got me, got me, right? People right over in front of me. No, it's no. Go, I slow up. He goes over the other way and I get here, I'll be done. He comes in front of me again. So when I go by him I get in the finger. Is that in the doctor's office, wow. Yeah, I have to. That's amazing. You talk radio 620 WSUN. It's the Neo Roger show. You can talk to Neo live by calling toll free 1-800-944-9463. Brigh. That's a good shmuck. Anyway, it's 1141. This is good stuff, you know? See now, I'm just, it's your fifth pizza. So it is not. You know what's nice? I'm having three slices total. Okay, since I'm not this is the line. It's your like 330 calories of slices. You already have a thousand. How do you know how much this is a slice? I memorized. There's no fat for only. The cheese. We can tell you the cheese is protein. Yeah. There are a lot of things that are protein. That are good for you. Cheese is good. So what's new on the porno scene now? Okay, I made my first, my first porno film for weeks ago. I don't even think of it. Oh, God. So the be the algal scene line of sex films. I'm not in it. Wait a minute. Is that a guy or a girl around the right arm? Richard Bay. Is that a guy? Is this another dike show? Oh, say. Is that a guy or a girl? It's a guy. It's a goedo. It's one of those new, Jersey, goedo. Can I ask you a question? I don't want any, New Yorkers to be offended. But I've said it many times before. Why is it not only? Well, there are a lot of Jews in New York. But why is it that people from New York are so sexless? Almost. What do you laugh? Almost every New Yorker that I met, they're cold, impersonal. They have like sexes like a, like a function. There is no emotion, no passion. They'd be good in that church because they know passion. So they can't commit any sins. There's this very cold thing with New Yorkers. What is that? Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely. No, for New Yorkers. It's so sexless. The weather is cold. In fact, you look on his show. Richard Bay any day. And once in a while, he brings some, Yeah, she was pretty. Once in a while, he'll have some people. Look like that. But more often than not, see that on the, I forget about her on the stage. The, the woman that's on a left a young, right there. Yeah. She's typical of what you see. They're like New York Valley girls. Well, well, they all live in Jersey. If you tell them what Manhattan girls, a lot of them are hot. I don't agree with you. I think New York City is great. I'm not knocking New York City. I'm not knocking New York City. I'm talking about people from New York. I didn't say the girls. You're forgetting who you're talking to. I'm just talking about New Yorkers in general. Okay. Very sexless. It's like Jews were sexless, which is most. Well, okay, but Jews are looking for the next meal. Did they do that? They have a deal with it. All the pets don't want you into eating. I guess that's where it's at. Can you have sex if they didn't? No, but are you serious? They don't have a line of point. You're not going to be doing stuff in the marina. No, it starts with the hitchcock thing. You know the silhouette of hitchcock. Yeah. They've hitchhiked. Why don't you feel the shy lens? Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you go? We had, we had, we had films. But it's hard because he's been $12,000 for a full length movie. Five sex scenes. We had to stop to shoot for two hours because one guy could not get an erection. For two hours. Is that the one you were talking about? Or the, it's amazing. But a sex from campy that good. There is enough money to do a set and take. Scripps on the port and you'd rather have a pretty 19 year old girl in a, when a hands from 25 year old guy did somebody who could speak lines. Exactly. That's, that's the genre. So you just accepted, right? It's not just this, you know, a shock. Okay, getting back to April, her spell. What are we going to do about this guy? And you got his, is he really his day? He's a good guy. Yeah. How can you be a press agent? Really, really like it. I'm saying that, they're all got to put him on the air. He don't want to talk. Yeah. Well, I had lunch with him. I love a because he's nice. He's absolutely so defibrably. But he doesn't need as much as you do. He's a lot. He's a lot. He grabs my food. Doesn't want to lunch with him. Yeah. I hate to see anybody try to grab your food. It is fighting words. No, he does not. The thing with the new post was the most exciting thing I've ever seen. It would be as if you were taking over this radio. It was like it was like he turned an ear post into screw magazine for two days. He would have if he had to, he had to time. Yeah. Might have increased the circulation. Well, I think that the papers in America should be like the English papers have these page three women. Well, you see breasts. Why not? Why not? Why can't we see boobs? Yeah. I think it'll probably double the post circulation. Yeah, give it a shot. You sound like Howard Beal now. You sound like something out of network. No, but it's true. They'll go for it. So, for it. You do look center. Now, don't forget I'm looking at you over the console. So, I can't see you. I don't even know why I'm trying to fill in like around the edges here. You're right. You have nothing to do with this. This is just a sham. This is just, I'm going to this. The screw magazine is just the means by which to break in the dough to buy the food. That is exactly what it is. Right. Because you don't give a crappy right. He's going to go back and half an hour and quit wasting all this time. You don't care about that. I don't care about that. And all. I don't. I care about good stuff cabbage. But you don't care about even good food. In other words, any food. As long as it has a lot of taste and preferably the higher the fat content and the higher the salt content, the more you like it. It should be taste and the higher the sugar content. Okay. Session one food. I had some picking duck tonight to go. It was very fatty. I'm really concerned about food. I went to this place to pump on the market. There's a place upstairs. All right. I'll make this last year. I'm excited. Wait a minute. I want to ask you because I know you'll never make it. It was 60 and I might. Okay. How about your wife. You have no wife. You did. Have a girlfriend. Yeah. But the great. How about leaving me in your will? I'll leave you. Come on. I'll leave you. I'll leave you. I'll leave you. I'll leave you. The point of collection. I review film for penas. I'll leave you. All the x-rated films. Right. What do I get if you croak? No chance. The chances. I have the caught. The chances are. I croak in before you. I'm not. At least the sweat finally stopped. Okay. You came in here. The sweat was pouring off your body. It looked like you had just done like 500 push-ups in a pickle pad. Look like you were back with Gloria Leonard again. I had to walk 18 steps. No one carried me in. And you're. Let's go back to Duke again. You're going on the right side. Yeah. Number three weeks. And what's that going to accomplish? How long are they going to lock you up? How long are they going to lock you up four weeks? They'll give me a start. And how much are you going to lose in four weeks? 20 pounds. It'll give me stars. 20 pounds. It's a start. You know how 20 pounds was show up on you? If you lost 20, if you got up out of the chair and you lost 20 pounds right now. If you went downstairs and had a big gigantic movement and lost 20 bucks. Nobody would ever see it. No talk about a needle and a haste. Talk about dropping a drop of water in the Atlantic. The money pounds wouldn't even be a beginner. He's one year. And then when you get out of there and you've been eating rice. Okay. But I'm going to throw four weeks and fruit. Don't want to you're going to do that. You're going to do that. 60 minutes in the guy with the cocaine that picture. It's the same thing you came trying. I mean, you know, so in other words, you're giving up though. No. I want to try again. But if I, if I could pitch a lady, then I'd be for 20. No, I'm going to try. I want to be thin and beautiful and clear. I want to see a look at the hong. I'm going to have to give up a strong. Yeah. No, you're laughing. But do you wait and see? Okay. I have another slice. It's 1148 on the IOD network. They'd be sure to join Rick and Sots today. 2 to 6 on news talk radio 620. WSUN. Well, you know what? Wake up, San 4. We ain't coming out. Okay. Good. Yeah.

I don't want you to die on the ear here. I feel guilty. I feel like I contributed to your demise. I don't want to be responsible for that. Now, like if it happens between here in the ballpark, it could be in accumulation. It could have been like the best drama you say. Which are the peaking duck probably. He likes it. Yeah. Do you take a blood sugar? I mean, you must have diabetes. No, I don't. You don't. How is that possible? It shows you ice cream, ice cream, fight things. Seriously, what is your blood sugar? Do you have any idea? No, I don't know. I know my blood pressure. I'm on low presser. And I have a cholesterol I take mevacore. What is your cholesterol? Clestrel is about 240. You said you 175. I can't believe that. Yeah, but my last time was a little higher. It was over 200. Okay. So I got to stop eating things like pizza again after today. Okay. Yeah, next time. You don't know what your blood sugar is? No, I should look it up. Once the last time you went to a doctor. A few more four weeks ago. Yeah. And up to blood tests. They didn't. They took your blood. Yeah, it was a mevacore. And you're not diabetic. Not that. You will be soon. And you'll be taking insulin. Doesn't make any difference. You'll be taking insulin. And they'll have to start chopping your legs off. Every day you give yourself an injection. No, I don't take insulin. I take, thank God. I take a role medication. Orl. Can you relate to that? You're a food pig. No, no, I am a food pig. But with a little bit of control, you have no control. No, no, no. I have never seen a person in fact. I'm trying to think of a parallel. Like if I were to chase he like me. Fad Rich is, but he doesn't look as bad as you do. I mean, he's big. I don't know how much he weighs, but it's like more proportion. But you're like this. I said it's like, like, your head is like regular size. I mean, the neck is getting a little, what do you think about 19 now? Yes. Yeah, 19. See, he was probably a 17 before. I started as a 16. Okay. I was a content. So your head, if you took your head like right from the beard up. Beautiful. Perfect. Put it on the wall somewhere. Huh? On to the plate. From the chin down, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And then around the middle, which is the worst to your heart. This is where it is. It's like this enormous, schmoole like thing. Like I said, it's like somebody took a tube and they put a helium. Seriously, I'm not joking about that. Like I blow up. How old is the walking blow up doll? That would be a good piece for screw. Everybody should have an alcohol. You're compressing me so. Oh, because I'm trying to get you. What do you need? Do you have a mirror in the house? Do you like Dracula? I call a mirror. You have to look at him. You have to look at a mirror. You have to stand stark naked before this day is over. I want you to stand stark naked and look at the mirror. A little man. But you're probably haven't done it in your hand while you're doing it. Because I know you want everything else in your hand. Because you can't find that. You're very cruel. No, I'm not. I'm trying to appeal to something, but obviously not. It's going to work. Why don't you say this. You don't care. Be honest with us. You don't care what we can make some news here. We can make breaking news. Elgoltz means it's for the first time. He's going to eat himself to death, but with a smile. Why don't you just say that? Is it true? He's a little... He's a little... No, I won't do it for spite. Because I want to outlive all my ex-wives. Really, too. Yeah. That's a truth. With it one year, I'm going to be here and you're going to say, How'd you do it? Lead me. Master. I'll be in Waco with my brethren. Oh, truthfully. You're going to see it all. You'll be in Waco? Yes. You're going to lock yourself in and wait for pace off. What is that all about? Here's this for a business of maniac over there. They're locked up. Well, when Passover comes, then something big's going to happen over there. What is that all about? But do you have to keep wanting to know Jews? The other way, you'd have pizza delivery trucks and Chinese delivery trucks. No food in 38 days. That's what you think. Jeff Cohen from Pizza Loft is probably out of the room over there right now. What of our people? Anywhere there's a cat in the body and so deliver. Look at this. You started to choke on it now. Don't you have a tax? Do you have like coughing attacks fit? I cough a lot. Yeah. But that's all in like many seizures. Because you had one of those before. Because I said something during the break. You said that whether it's sweat, it's a mama chest. I know what. Yeah. Exactly. I want to start right after I get full at the stadium. I want to have enough food. Because I'll be there then. Possibly. Any other concession people is maybe I want to call for take out just in case. Because I know they're prepared for a huge crowd for opening day. They didn't count on you showing up. So what would you have there today on it? Are you like this rehab? Are you a dopenance? No, penis. No, no, no. And you got to take them out of the shell to experience too many calories. Take them out of the shell. It's like exercise. Yeah. Any kind of. Like you probably don't eat like crabs. You're required to slow and requires a lot of energy to get shell to good. Michelle. Okay. And the three hot dogs, three hot dogs. What else are they? How about the big pretzels with mustard? Very high like in. It's good. Yeah. You know what else? Did they have any cotton candy? No cotton candy. That's good. It's a little short. How about the missed a youth fair? We just finished with the day count a youth fair. You could have gone out there and gotten some. I love cotton candy. I've had it in years. Great. You know what I had last week? That was great for the first time in years. Bit of honey. Wow. Yeah. Once the last time you had a bit honey. No, look. Oh, you wouldn't like that. That's not your kind of candy bar because you have to peel each section. Also, Robert. I heard a bunch of teeth. So forget about that. But you have to peel each one off the section. Yeah. So your kind of candy bar, which I've also had a couple recently, was the big king-sized Snickers. Oh, great. Which you just peel it and just pop the whole thing. I love it. Yeah. Poor device. Yeah. How can I say, I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. Did you see Fadso with that Deloise rate? Wasn't it? I love it. Because this is like what this is all over again. You could be Oscar Lopetus. Remember the guy? Yeah. From Shelby Checkers? Yeah. Well, you know, this is a sad experience. No, no. Because it's just a period of addiction. It's a period of adjustment. Well, I'm going to be sitting again. I was sitting once I was sitting again. He's from Gargantua, the just fat. See, you know what would have happened to you? The problem if you would have been the way you were before. Before you went on the off the fast. You were fat. But not dangerously fat. You were you. Yeah. Okay. Now you try to be something else. And the frustration level is so great. And not being able to be that slim whatever. That you're over you're going the other way. That this is what we do. This is the real thing in the fat. Is the frustration level causes you because you can't in a few days wake up and look like Peter and ortho where it is you want to look. Then you just go crazy. And now you're going to keep doing this accordion thing. Can we do it? In fact, you're right about therapy. You learned that we are very, we find it hard to be moderate. I bet you all parts of your life. You are accessible because I am. Yeah. Fat pizza is the compulsive of the family. Other than gambling. I've done gambling. Well, thank you. I can't pitch you moderate. Very moderate. So that's it. Watch if you race is almost every night. Watch if you can't talk about this. You're obsessive. No, I'm not. Watch it. Only sex in the food. For me, it would be just a food. Yeah. Well, have a great time at the game. Thank you. You won't have any food tomorrow. I'm very happy to see. I wish I could say it was an uplifting experience. But I want to see your friend here, a Bush felt press agent. He's looking at me this whole hour. See this guy's a bastard. I'm trying to somehow shame you and do it. This is beyond the point of funny. No, no. I mean, you could be funny and being laughed at. Like, God, look at how it's but that's not you. No, I'm going to grab hold. And yeah, you're going to grab hold. Wow, how are you going to do that? I'm going to take a search party for you to grab hold. But look at this guy. That is the press agent. A name's press agent Randy. He is so thin. I don't think he enjoys food as much as I do. He's busy. He's busy having sex with other things in his mouth. Okay. Have a great time out. Have a great time out. Good to see you. Say hi to top slider and Tommy's a lying, phony hypocrite. And have a great time at the game. Go Marlins. No need too much. Okay.

Woke water for the coffee. And pray, don't worry. Okay, well be long now. Couple of hours man. How goldstit will be out there if you feel like a list in the stadium. If you're sitting in your seat and you feel a stadium like a listing toward one side, you'll know what side he's sitting on. God, a monster in the porno industry, a monster in the human race. This man, what did you see? There's like a beach ball with legs. George said, Alex, like a gigantic beach ball with legs. We love you, Al. We want you to live at least more than another six months and tell the next meal. The man lives from meal to meal, which is like continuous, never ending. He blew off the day lines by the way, seven, five, one, all three day lines. You're open. Sorry about that. God, the pizza chef, I got to tell you that is some of the best stuff in the history of the world. And because it's made in those brick ovens, it's not like... Pizza chef gourmet pizza, they use only high gluten flour, so Al's are to be really clogging up heavily now as we speak. And there are at 1.8685 West, Dixie and North Miami Beach. There are Oakland and Pine Island up by me in, what is that? That sunrise? Oakland Park, whatever that is. And God, and it's a franchise, they're going to be all over the state, including Sarri Soda according to the guy earlier, tremendous. And especially that taco schmoco, what is it called? It's cold. What does it call? It's a whole A. Oh, A. Oh, God, that's good. Oh, they're Mexican, oh, there it is. God, that's good. Does the ordinary one have beans? Oh, it does have beans, so be sure if you're like me, and all like the beans, do not ask, make sure no beans on me, on my mind. Speaking of beans. Hey. I'm gonna watch the marlins play. Oh. But I'll watch them put the game away. I'll watch Felix Ways and Charlie Howe. Kick their ass and look out now. Marlins are going to win today and he'll look out. Oh, yes, yes, come on. They're going to win today. Oh, the marlins are going. Kicks are bad today. So how was it yesterday? He's gone. He just sings his thing and he leaves. He doesn't speak to me. That's all right. After yesterday, I guess he wouldn't want to, anyway. Well, this audience man, we could put God on the air and on the weekend. They don't want to speak to anybody. Okay, they don't want to call. Which reminds me, I don't want to take a cheap shot at Annemaria. What she is doing on the air. I mean, Mitch Lewis is a great talent, creative guy, good guy, horrible show. What she is doing, does she really believe she belongs on the air? Does she really think so? Come on, George, you're her good pie, Zon. She really believes she should be doing that. Okay, he will, he says, speak to Weevil and I will say nothing. Because she'll cut me off. To open lines of date, come on, let's go. Okay, so how old's thing killed us, you'll. Let's get with it. 7519-463, it's Marlins Day. It's Mani the Marlins Day. And in spite of that, come to a clock because we're a, we're a faithful loyal, D people, we're all going to be listening to Rick and Suds. At 205, I swear I'll never read another pizza again until next meal. The man is just, seriously, he, three muffins just, he was in this room for an hour. Exactly an hour. Shovel down, street big. I don't know what was in him, blueberry, whatever the hell they were because they shouldn't leave any behind muffins. Got only there. Oh, they are there. House, you, let me see the bag. I don't want any. I just want to inspect to see what they are and how big they are and what's it. Oh my god, the bag, get her hernia just look at this. Isn't it heavy? Oh look at these. These are boo. I wonder if I should have one of those. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, oh, and a smell so good, Al. I hate you. God. Those are beautiful. Maybe just a little, a little piece. What my fingers. Hmm, they're blueberry. I don't know, I wonder where he had three of those. And they're like, well, it's a two four. Now he lied. He had four of them because he said that they were nine. He had four. And I think I'll have one. So the slot that he is. Ha ha ha ha. See, I could be just as big as he was. They once upon a time I did go 266. At the most I ever way back, I was in Sarasota. And of course, when you're in Sarasota, that's all you can do is eat. I weighed 266 pounds. And that was like, so what is that? It's like about 76 pounds, 78 pounds more than I weigh now. But this man is going in the other direction. So he ate four of these. He says he had three, but he had the other one without even knowing it. I mean, that's fat when you eat so much that you eat stuff and you don't even know you weighed it. That's fat. Then he had got only I'd have no idea how many pieces of pizza. Now, this was just keep in mind. This is only like an appetizer. Okay. Now he's on his way to the stadium. He's going to take a 20 to least two or three hot dogs plus the carvel. His eyes lit up like a pinball machine when I told him about the hot-fudge carvel with the strawberries and the cherries. Here's Miami on the Sterline. Hello. Yeah. Mr. Roger. Yes, sir. This is the weight watcher, the dish and this more inner part. That's it. Hey, does all you're talking about is food making me hungry. That's where we're at. But it's not one of the ask you something about for a long time have been hearing you read off the ratings and the trends. Well, it's a good thing I didn't look in his bag for these blueberry muffins. Well, yeah, you're already starting to eat one of those. Mom into it. I also speak brown ones. Not that big. These are like small. I know the ones you're talking about. These are more human. Big mama. Mm-hmm. I explained to me how the ratings work and the trends because I don't understand the system. What do you mean? Well, you read off that. Yeah. That. All right. You wrote show went from a 4.9 to a 5.3. What about does that work? How does what work? The trends and the ratings. They sent out diaries. They picked up. They picked names out of a hat. And they sent them out. And they allegedly have this very scientific way of doing it. And people fill them out. And they mail them in if they think about it. And if not, they get lost. And they would work. And that's supposed to be a scientific methodology. And if we talk about it, they list us on page 5. Be the book, a saying, we're bad guys. And we're influencing the audience, which is a bunch of crap. But what's the highest? Is it 10? Would be your 100? No. High is who would be 100? 100%. 100%. I see. So we share of the audience. When you're talking about 5.95.9% of the audience. Of the people who are listening at that time. Right. No, the people who are listening. Not of who are pulled of the end. They extrapolated over the entire listening audience. A ledge. Right. Real scientific method there. Right. OK, just wanted to see how that work. Well, it's like everything else. It's a polycrap. It's like everything else in life. Have a great day, pal. You bet you. OK. Open line in the storyline. Here's something that says, would you pass my number to Al Goldstein? I would love to interview him for a story. You can give it to him. David, somebody, rather? OK. Well, we'll do it, David. Although I see he lives in the grove. So beware of him. 1213 on the IOD network. You can wake up with Bob Lassiter every weekday morning from 6 to 10. A news talk radio 620, WSUN.

If you see the writer with the hockey news, they don't come any better than Neo Roger. Alex thinks it's a cross-center. To the lead climb, they take the shot of Burrah Huskies. It gets around him, center of it, but there's Gilmore. And he's away again. Where Chefsky is with him and will pay his catching up. Neo Moore hangs onto it. He goes in. Find a kick of loose. Now the pass. It's a good one. The shot goes towards the Huskies. He will shot three out of things. Wow. Can I greet Chefsky? My dear, my dear Gilmore. This is your boy and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs. They don't come any better than Neo Roger. Wow. You know something? I could eat that whole bag of these. That's a good user. You want one, short? See, that's why you're a puny little run. That's why you don't grow up like you ate your weedies or something. Then by your puny little thing. Because you don't eat right. These are great. Now I take back everything I said about Al. Okay? He's just a natural guy. He's not trying to resist all these urges. He's just diving into it. God, I'm sorry. I opened up that bag. And I guarantee that in the back of my mind when I opened up the bag, it wasn't just to see how big they were or what they were made of. It was to see if there was something good in there. And God were they ever. I could eat the other four or three whatever's in there. But I won't. Now you had. Here's a lady in Miami. Yeah, hi, Neo. Hi. I want you to go. My chances were of getting tickets to date to the game. Because I've got my cyber jacks in my popcorn in my hot dog. But no. Can I answer your question? Yeah. Unless you want to pay a scalper, 100 bucks a seat outside the ballpark. I'd say pretty slim. Really? Yeah. Oh well. Thanks guys. All right. Just turn on your TV and get your cracker jacks in popcorn and big pretzels in the 20 or 30 hot dogs. And you can enjoy like Al's going to enjoy it. Okay. Thank you. I hope it landed date. 751 food. Boy, those are good muffins. I wonder where he got those. Where'd you get those, Al, baby? Man, those were good. And they weren't the real. I know the ones the caller is talking about. You know the ones that you get like at the mall. Those enormous. They're like for a big meal. Where'd you get those? My favorite muffins. Oh yeah. My favorite muffin in the affineter room. All right, Mike. When that is name? Mike. And don't come bother me at the game, Mike. And don't come bother me at the track anymore. It's just a hot shot, the pop at a flash running around probably tonal. His piezons there at the place where he works, which I won't mention on it here this time again. Oh, I really told that son of a bitch off, but I told him yeah. I mean, where did you intrude upon my life? Did I discover you or was it the other way around? However, rich insist that you continue to give him those. He'll ritual tell you on the nights that I'm not going to be there. Okay. I'm sure that's the way they got this covered. Knights, what I'm not at the track and rich happens to be there. Those are the Knights that he comes forth with the good information. Oh, Wolop is gonna jog. He's gonna pay $16 and riches up there. He's making 100, he's making $1,000. I'm the Knights, what I'm there. He's like giving him stiffs. So I won't be there tonight. No chance it might be in the Pompatau Park. Rich is gonna be there all by himself. Okay. Here's a plantation. Hello. How many food do you eat? What is it? How many food do you eat? How many food do you eat? Let me ask you something.

How many food do you eat? Your 10 years old and that's the way you speak. God help us, the human race man. There's no hope for us at all. No wonder Alice just eating at least a taste good, at least it's satisfying his immediate urges. Because I think the guy in what the wacko and wake will have a point. This could be our last piece of it. So let's just pick out extra butter on the monsters that I'd guys. Bradenton. Oh, I didn't do the thing. Hello. Hi. Hi. This is your chronic every three weeks.

You have to eat a lot and sweat a hell of a lot to get a whole hour on this show. I'm not exaggerating. He was sweating so profusely in his face was so red, especially when he started laughing. I know. I was preventing to the phone. I was convinced that he was not going to make it through that hour. I mean, he was just barely functioning. I want to wish you be the chicée de laur. Oh, and likewise, back at you. Japanese too. Are you cereal or Japanese you? Yes, I am. Well, how much sushi do you have on pace? Yeah. Unlikely, huh?

I wanted to say Neil God. Well, that's great. May I? Go ahead. Neil. Oh, God. How's that? Well, it sounds like I've got the audience sufficiently aroused even if he wasn't. Have a great day. Hey, I wanted to ask you something. Happy pace, I'll ask you. Yes. Was the hockey game yet named? Was the hockey team yet named? Ah, yeah. Go ahead. We're going to call him.

Here's the drive into left footer field. That fall has got to be! That I hear! It's gone! It's 715. There's a little home run champion of all time. And it's Henry Aren. The player works are going. Henry Aren is coming around third. His teammate for home play had less than a little round. Two balls, one strike. What's in the? The runners lead. A lot of Roman right center. He hits one there. We can dance in the streets. But two ones. Swing lane, grab the ball. One round is in. Here's the play. Here's the play. Here's the play. There's the play. There's the play. There's the play. There's the play. There's the play. There's the play. So let me ask you that they win. 12 28. We have an open line in day. 715. On hang your head. That was unconscious. And we'll even in the moment of excitement. Harry is just frosted. Here's the mobile and Tampa. Hello. How come he's playing? And the same to you. All right. You and Rick and Scott got to be doing something right. Everybody calls me from New York to get to it on hold because we got you on. Really? You have my head. It's a tackle. The national magazine said put me back on hold. I'm going to put people at that beautiful part of the body. Everybody have grand eyes. Okay. All right. Listen. I want to leave you with the talk alone in the room. I'm actually a useful part of the body for outgold. For the amount of food that he's back in a way. Yeah. Every time caught the open, crumple is in the head. And back to you. Take care of the great life. Bye. Open line in the green line. 11944. Did anybody ever call about the stadium concessions? They did not. Why not? And did anybody ever call with a cell phone from. They're supposed to have more than just the football pair. Hmm. Oh, they are. But I'm sure that Carvelle still has that thing because I know that L will definitely want to make a trip to the Carvelle. See, ordinarily as ice cream goes, I hate to say this because. But Carvelle is not very exciting. I'm sorry because there's some ice people at on, you know. But especially on pace off because most people at on Carvelle are Jewish. For whatever the reason was Tom Carvelle Jewish, I don't think so. But the stuff is kosher even for pace off. But the Carvelle at the stadium is like extra special. I don't know what there is about it. But I guess it's the cherries and the strawberries and the hot fudge. And God is that good. In fact after, you know, like in half time, it did all of them get even if it's a crappy game you have one of those needs to say. Oh God. Yeah. Here's St. Peter'sburg. Hey. Yes sir. About Jim Skyler. Yes. I listen on the weekend and he's actually. My. I'm pretty good. But, you know, when you get through listen to Joey, it's tough to, it's tough to hear funny anymore. I kept hearing that line yesterday. What a tough act to follow and everybody meeting. How could anybody have an audience after Joey? And then there was some old bag named Rutha called in. And he said, why do you have a real tough act to follow? Because he's the best. And, and his credit, Scott, or hung up on her and I was curing in the car. Well, I'll tell you, you know, when I'm working on the weekend, I'll just put the radio on and it's background noise. Right. And till something comes up and then I'll listen. And then, uh, so a lot of times, you know, I'll have Joey on. And I'm not really hearing anything. But, uh, I've kind of wiened myself as that, uh, where I'm not turning him on. Because it is really, uh, it's just my sound overblown. But, I think it impairs my ability to hear humor. Yeah. And it pairs your ability to function as a human being. On Saturday, I think it was, I get in my car. I turn on a radio, which I always have on six ten being as loyal as I am until it comes time to turn it off. And he has got the first call was, uh, Oh, that's right. The very first call was Bill from Newport Richie. He had him on for 15 minutes. There is nobody on this radio station besides him. He won't even tolerate Bill from Newport Richie. He had him on for close to 15 minutes. He goes into a commercial break. He comes back and who do we go to next?
