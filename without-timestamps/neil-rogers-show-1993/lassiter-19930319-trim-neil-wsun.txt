One more time. Don't like slough on it. How come my level is so low now? You got my mic turned off. No, I don't have your mic. Turn off. Turn off. I love my mic. See you're not fooling me. He's trying to like upstage me now. I'm not trying to watch stage. You've got a different mic than I do. Your mic, my mic is highly directional. Yours is not. And when I raise my voice, I can hear feedback in your mic. Feed this. Yeah, you feel it. Slough over that. That was like a very- It was like the microphone. No, not the microphone. It was pointed. It was meaningful. It goes to show it. That sometimes people who are inhibited, people who are living in a little, like this narrow little cloistered world brought up in this kind of an endothal mentality. When they actually hear there's an option like somebody could think for themselves. It's like a mirror. I still, I'm screaming over here in that God damn needle isn't even moving on it. What are you looking at the wrong one? This is the one. I don't want to go anywhere. It's not like that. Look. See what I'm talking about is what? What a different way. Great that thing up. Let's somebody hear this God damn station. Well, you know, one of you don't have any numbers on this station. The work. When you walk in a radio station, and you see the view, the needle is barely moving. What? Come on. Come on. Right is. Lay that thing on the right. Good man. Lay that baby over there to start the damn thing. So they'll be listening in Jacksonville. Why do we want people listening in Jacksonville? You're right. Exactly. I'll turn it back down again. My turn all the way off is Trump. Let's go to say Peter'sburg. Either St. Petersburg, you're on the air at the BDSU and with the doctor. What's going on? Like, doesn't last a minute. No. I think Fred that. Fred that pops the famous religious caller formerly Jacob from Fumma with her. I think he's after your bot. What do you mean formerly Jacob? What does that mean? He was one of Bob's old coars and that's the way his name is. Jake. And now he's Fred. Well, if you'd like to know the truth, I'd like to know the truth. Well, I'd like to know the truth. Well, I'd like to know the truth. But, uh, so sure man, I hope they're in any poor richy. I hope they have big enough shirts to fit over their Colossumy bags tomorrow. They're clapping shirts. So Bill and Fred and Jacob are doing like a little three week. Right now as we see just they are clapping. Stop! Stop! Oh man! I can't wait to see the Colossumy shirt show. Oh, funny quote. Hey, hey, now. Yeah. Closing your great botlap that has got man. Have a great look. You ever heard of some kind of radio? Sure. To talk show. You know, people phone in while he's on the air and make a beef. Call what about? Why I think Joe, whatever. I'm just a buggy in that's what you talk about. Sometimes he agrees with the caller. By the time he says some straight. So when I said you never listen to him, he goes to the other talk shows around. But for my money he's the best. Why does he get results? Well, no. He doesn't do anything except talk. Well, and I guess it just gives you a chance to unload. You know how it is. You gotta beef. You tell it to somebody and you feel better. Bob, God. This time we go to Newport Ridge. What's your problem? Talk about a self-stroking exercise. Get serious. What do you mean self-stroking exercise? Where we call that exercise. Now did you say Newport Ridge? We're going to Newport Ridge. Do we have to, how many questions do we get? I think you'll be delightfully surprised. Newport Ridge, you're on the air at WSC Run. What's happening, Big Bob? You see? You're a different voice in Newport Ridge. That's right. Make an progress man. There are hundreds. On any Sunday, 100. He's bright. He's a liar. Violent? Are you sure? I took you in the college. I've got something coming. Oh, it's on. Former WFL employees. Both former W-W-W ended you work there. Pretty much as a last week. As a last week. Just a start-man. So I worked there, board-up a couple of times. I don't want to talk too much. So that's one finished business there. We know one of your most loyal listeners. Yeah. Well, when we were on finished business. We here would want to offend him. No. I don't know. But I know he's listening. He spends more time listening to your show than he is concentrating on his show. Well, he likes good radio. That's why he listens over here. He just has not reproduced this. He would know good radio if one slid up his hands. So he was listening. So he was listening to the station. Now he's gone. He's gone. Monitoring so he can write letters to arbitron. So they said, dire we again. They said it. That is true. He's out of his freaking mind. Well, hold a hold on there. No, one way your business is getting up there. I mean, you know, when we get in the closet. You're going to get in the closet. I'm sorry. I wish just I'm probably David Paul's illegitimate brother. Has the last check cleared? Oh, yes. Okay. So you don't have any unfinished business. Matt, spill your guts. What's going on over there? Well, I have nothing. Nothing. There will be nothing shed about you on the radio. Well, I know that way. We know that. How about off the radio in the halls? Oh, off the radio. There's, but everyone listens to you. And we'll let it. Everyone. Oh, man. It's great. I have. We've had people trying and call the show and then, you know, get Perch words on. Oh, you're kidding. Well, Lionel called one day. There. Yes, he did. On serious, too. But then Lionel's just a chronic caller. And, probably ever was a caller. It's always still his. Oh, I tell you, he's done it. Yeah, well, you know, Lionel and I, God, man. I feel so bad. Lionel and I have a light in common, you know. I always wanted to be a lawyer. He always wanted to be a top show host. And neither of us ever got our dream. Well, I just wanted to comment, say, Did you guys win my work in Fiche? I'm damn, man. Big Bob. Hey, well, you know. Come on over. Yeah, I know. But thanks a lot. I'll catch you guys tomorrow. Oh, hi. Congratulations for getting out. Hey, be sure to tell us who you are. Huh? Be sure to tell me how you are. Oh, yeah. You know, I don't care what the situation is. Because there'll be a lot of other radio people there, too. So be sure and tell us. All right. Okay. Thank you. I'm seriously, when we did the thing at the Clearwater Mall. Yeah. Like days afterward, I was told through the rape line that the every person who works in radio and some who are on the outside looking in would at that thing check it out. They did. Wasn't an incredible gathering. Have an employed Tampa Bay radio people as well as some employed as well. But I do get spy reports. If you're pardoning expression, I don't use the word spy reports on my show. I got to get some errors talking in front of you. He's my radio god. I do get spy reports that. What are you making faces? Come on. Come on. Let's go. Your pacing. You're talking about my show. But they talk about my show up in Dama Halls at WFL. I probably haven't been meeting every day. Did it sit down and analyze it? Oh, no, no, no, no. I mean, they liked the show. Yeah. We're talking about the employees out of court. Well, I was told me at the game last night, which he was paying no attention to. He was telling me that at the news paper's here. And at the TV stations and then news departments, everybody who works in TV news here, listen to this station. Yeah. That's true. But how come they won't talk about it? How come the goddamn Tampa Tribune is given a song to dance about Ron and Ron who aren't even on the air anymore? And Mason Dixon with his crone poem, figure up his butt. Here you come up hearing himself. He has a selfie audience. Exactly. He's talking to her. You know, not our audience. He already said, so this, the audience had reads in the Tampa Tribune that he said checkers. And up Chuck said, the Olive Garden. Well, last night, on Newstalk, ready to 620, W.S.U.N. Let's go to a new York. And then they were right. Well, no, it's very believable. New York, hi, you're on the air at W.S.U.N. Well, the no talk goes like new. Who told you yet what's red or feel? I literally met on your coat and started the coat. They couldn't even cop or feel. I love it. Was that belt being called in from the house? I don't think so. It's voices in that deep. Oh, about saying Peter's word got their signature on the air. W.S.U.N. I'm a bad dog. How are you doing? Oh, it's a pretty good thing yourself. Pretty good. Hello, Neo. No guiding light for today. No, over to many basketballs. This is what your favorite callers, chronic chronic rose junior. Yeah, hi. Yeah. Glad you're new God. Glad you had a safe trip up. I thought you were flying. Wow, look at this. Good. Come on. We got food. See all I got to do is come in here. I attracted like a magnet rose. Oh, there's plenty of stuff up and down to four straight. Yeah. So did you have a nice two got up there safely. You must have found down 120 miles now. No. No. Now we did not. As a matter of fact, I've made it in four hours. And it would have been less than that. Except when you're coming up 75 and you get around four miles. Yeah. God, are there those people old and slow and those picking man old men? Yeah. They're like a convoy. They're like in all three lanes and they're like all going about 45, 48 miles an hour. And everybody's just tearing it out trying to get around him. It's impossible and impossible. I wanted to tell you that my sister was down from Boston, my steps to the stir. And she listened to the whole show from beginning to end. I mean, from the last to the right through to Randy Lovejal. Right. And she's a total hockey baven. And she ought to be because she's the daughter of the late Walter Brown. So she wants to know if it's the call to say a little to you. Well, say a little to her. Okay. Hello her. Our name's Marge. Time March. Okay. Take anything. Have a great day. You're all around here. Bye. Bye. Oh, great. Now we can enter inventory of the food here. Do we have anything to drink? Like sodas like diet sodas. How come last night? So how come last night at the game when Todd said, do you anybody want to soda? And you said, I'll have a coke. And then he said, like diet or regularly said regular musmite. Dietbettic friend. Are you eating sugar? What do you mean? I'm eating sugar. Just what I asked. I occasionally asked. I can't. But dietbettic was eating sugar now. I've been admitted to you that I had amin amizet to hotel in the many barlash. Now you'd be upset. I mean, I can't all of a sudden you're so concerned about my health. I'm not. I didn't think so. What is that? What is in that? I don't know. Here. Can we take a pubic at that? Well, now is this the stuff from the deli? Oh, that's your omelet, blob. Look at the size of that thing. That is. That's your omelet. Why you don't have to eat all of this. Shortes is deli and restraud. Judy and Michael shorts at 1706 of the Elmabri in Tampa. Coacher and concher. And catering and joy. And for glam and for fun. And you almost all other on baking. There's stuff that's phenomenal. It's great. Do they advertise on WSUN? Like, well, why not? Well, let's go. I have got to wake up this place. Man, I might have to take a month off and stay over here. And wake these people up and get this into a real radio station. A month off and go. Go that. You're on down there at the end of the hall with their goddamn Neil Diamond records. Who do you want to hear that crap? I'm not going to hear this into a real radio station. Now that Ville Vita is home and invalid. A month off and stay here? Yeah. Oh, my God. What's wrong with that? Well, that's what I want to enjoy being here. I'm going to enjoy being here. Same Peter's. Same Peter's burger on the air. Good morning. Good morning, Saint. No, I'd like to start off. By thanking you, Robert, for introducing me to a Mr. Robert English All. Oh, yeah. You're so okay, sure. In the minute, the Messiah. Who's at some kind of communist Robert English All? You're going to who he is? Yes. Yes. Who would have known when you were good? Really? Never one thought Robert. We have a foreker who we need to start over. Here's here's this stuff. I don't know where he was going. Go ahead, go on. Oh, that is a Neil Roberts. What is a Neil Roberts? Yeah. I don't know. But you know, let me go. Right after Tim and Paul kept you going. Yeah. Here's static on my radio. Yeah. And then a two-a-pick up. Good. Good. I'm busy in check out the school. Okay, these guys, okay, with me. Just say anything you want. I'm checking the food out. Okay. And look at that beautiful bread. If you ever said so, those mixed-rion Pumper Nicolette is incredible. Okay. I'm going to end my call. Yes, they're still here. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Okay, come down. Get a great call. Oh, God. But I'll do that later when I get home. Let's go to Sepner. I'll set up your on the RWS-U-N. Neil, how? Oh, Neil. Just an robbing, talking to you. Oh, bed. I don't even vibrate in two. Yeah? I might even be. You're right. Don't wear your batteries out. Oh, Neil. You're so tired. Damn. Could you people talk longer? You know, we're trying to eat. Exactly. Try to get to damn food organized. And we got a bunch of short ones on the phone. Okay. Oh, I can't put a long one to run on. If they don't come any shorter than that one. I look. All right. So that we can eat just the... Wait, what up? It's got like all kinds of good vegetables and stuff, isn't it? Right now, and my arm was getting cold. So, you know, we've even had a few more. We've got to put one on the wall. We've even had a little bit of time on the phone. Well, we've got to... Let's go to a celebrity line. You're a whole rose. Clown my darling. Just keep talking, honey. Is this the rose? Just... Yeah, hello. And you talked to this bitch? Hey, asshole. Yeah. Yeah, real asshole. I'm no chronic, Neil. So, then what do you call me an asshole for? Because kind of a breeding is that. You think calling me a chronic ass? You disgusting filthy bitch. What kind of a breeding is that? I come over here in the first word out of your ugly, up-pustilled mouth is asshole. But you've been calling me a counter. You was slud. You've been calling me a chronic. And that's... I don't even know who you are. I hear your show, Neil, because I like your show. So, why can't you listen? Why do you have to call? Good. You tell everybody. I'm a chronic. And that's not true. I just stand out because I'm good. Yeah, you stand out, huh? Yeah, I'm a good caller, Neil. Stand out on this side. And that bitch that called a wild girl that chronic. Everybody do is a bitch. And asshole, why don't you clean up your act. Gargolotch, your thing with horror from you. Yes, right. Clean up your colostomy back, honey. I'm not a lot of room. You have a lot of room to talk to you, bitch. Whoa. Anyway, listen. Hey, how's it going? Yes, Rose. You're... I get a lot better than Neil. Yeah, you know what? I find very amusing Rose. My chronic suck around bitch. What I find most amusing is that you're about the third one. Well, you're the best or Neil's the best. Why can't you get a listen to the radio? And it always trying to pit this one against the other one, okay? If you like Bob, listen to Bob. If you like me, listen and don't ever call. And that you're as for the whole audience. While you're reading the way it goes, is your number one. And we're concerned that number two and Neil's like number three. And Randy is a bitch. Just to listen and cut the crap, okay? Well, for this, you get up in the middle of the night. It's true, honey. Ninety-fourty-eighths a time. Let's see your lastner on Newstalk Radio. Ah, six-twent double USUN. Great foot. Okay, all. Let's ram it a couple more. Quick calls so I can get out of here and go home and go. I'm going to leave you by the way. Okay, great question. Mark and Josh, what's your address? I'm afraid to love to see you. What's uh, what do we have? Oh my god. Guess who just walked in. Guess who just walked in. I'll be so happy. Um, I, you can't see him from there. Jacksonville, hi there, Jackson. You're on the air. Matt the Huck. Hey, I'm doing, man. Look who's here. What the hell is going on? Get a pan, sir. Jacksonville, listen and four. Neil? What? If you don't want Jacksonville, listen to this. Pretty lovely Jacksonville, sir. Yep, huh? That was mom that said he don't want Jacksonville. Oh, you got it all wrong. God, that's what I heard. You only difference between Jacksonville, Tampa and Miami and the number of assholes for square it. Exactly. What about up? The number of square inches. God, I went down and came up here from Clearwater. And had a dog named Bubba. Why did you move from Clearwater to Jacksonville? Yeah, I got a promotion. Actually, I live in a small place. How could you possibly get a promotion? I mean, I know the Clearwater is a, you know, prize winner, man. But how could you possibly get a promotion? I would take you from Clearwater to Jacksonville. Well, actually, it's a smaller town than Jacksonville. About side of Jacksonville. And a town of about a thousand people. No way to make it. Are you the guy that called before? No. Huh? No, I'm not, you talk to this gentleman that came in here that brought us all this crap. Are you the guy that called, said you were coming in? Yeah. We gave him the, uh, good to see you, by the way. Oh, you're the see you, but I'll give this guy. No, not you. This guy that came in here brought us, say, uh, right. I want to grab a catalog and a bunch of stuff in a bunch of M&M. So we just gave him a pornographic album. Right. Hey, wait, Bob. Yeah. When you were on Florida, I can't believe you're back. I can't believe him back either. So, you're doing a great job with this show. He is doing a great job. He is doing a great job. You want to know something? The monster in a business, sir. I don't like sports talk. But you do a good job. I do a damn good job. You make it. How about those leaves, huh? How about them, leave? They did it. They kicked some ass. Well, I'm a, I'm a penguins fan. Well, that one nice night too, by the way. Okay. Now I didn't care about it. In fact, well, keep up with this work. Okay. Here you're, thank you. Have a great day. Mr. Chairman, I'm just a way from the side of that. It's a way from the side of that. It's a way from the side of that. Would you take care of the calls and stuff with a damn food here. It's a radio show. Not a goddamn restaurant, last. It's a land. Oh, lakes. Either land. You're on the air. W.S.U.N. All land. Let's go. Go on. Huh. Well, then. Didn't want to talk to them anyway. Most people are going to lakes for bizarre. Let's go to Tampa. Hi there. It's happy you're on the air. W.S.U.S.U.N. Hey, Bob. I talked to Neil the other day. Yeah. Have you played just your field quings for me? And I did. Yes, sir. And I was just inviting you. We're going tonight in the Marnight. No, I'm Drew. That's too bad. We can't go there tonight. Well, we'll be there tonight. I just hope I had picked up the check for all of us. Okay. I don't work. There'll be about 20, 30 of us. All right. And we're going for my vice president's birthday. I've got to say happy birthday to him. Happy birthday, Pete. And I did not bring that card. But that's. We got to do birthdays on Wednesday. No. Why not? Because it says you're not a nice guy. That's why. Anyway, next time you get a little bit of free time Neil and you're up. And Bob, I'll take you to. Oh, correct. Okay. No problem. It's a deal. Thanks. It was going to Don and Tell us. You. You're a lovely wife. Right. Allegedly curtains. Susie. But I'm sure they'll come up with some other excuse on that. I thought we're going to basketball fair. That was last night. What's the excuse tonight, Kurt? I always got a hand. Nobody in there. That's all it. And Bob's running on its own. Bob Neil. That's it. That's it. That's it. That as far as I know. Okay. Isn't it? And of course, we don't. Oh, see how low. Be trying to revolve your only air WSU in. Good morning, Mr. Lasseter. Good morning, they're upon. I'm going to page just tomorrow.

Mr. Rogers is hiding your shoes and grass. You'll be wearing it. Mr. Rogers is known to give about the lady you're wrist. I'll be wearing it. The slip is a matter of fact. It'll be lovely. What color dressed and shy he'll shoot in the bag? Maybe we'll give you the slip. How's that? I'll be there. Okay. Great. Bring your white hood to with you. Let's go to a bomb armor. Hi there, Bob. You're on the RWSU end. Good morning. Good morning, Bob. Are you still living in this 6 to 10 spot, huh? You know, you've made it to this side yet. Man, I love this. I really enjoy like the hours. Come on in, bird. Oh, man. Well, you used to be the rating for very important to you. Oh, it's still hard. But you would own this. You're on market. If you were on after some of us was brain woke up in the morning. Well, you're saving off from this cold gun. Oh, the market. You see, this is the most prestigious time. If I can make this big fly, I'm going to earn so much. Oh, God damn much money from this company. It's beyond belief. Head foam. Yeah. Seven to eleven. What a pretty well. Seven to eleven to be okay with me. We just had the kind of walk this company along. And yes. Hey, guys. No worries. Just the radio show going on here. Don't worry. We just have to kind of walk this company along into the 20th century. You know? All right. We are going to succeed. We are going to succeed. How do you like that? Right. Why did these assholes were going to do it? You got it. I guess you probably will. You know, we're still listening even though you know. Six to ten. What? God. Well, now wait a second. I was on an afternoon drive. People rearrange their lives. Listen, and after to drive, right? I don't know. Yeah. You probably do too, right? Yeah. We're going to get you up at six in the morning.

We've got wives. Well, send it back to their parents and cut the crap. Okay. Oh. Can you read it? And now you're going to put Richie tomorrow? No. No. No. We're going to peaches. We're going to peaches. We're going to put our food. We're going to put our food. We're going to put our food. That's where a lot of people hang out. But those are mostly. We have to. People. Well, listen. It's been a treat. Yeah, really. And stay up. Okay. Okay. Well, just about the end of the day here for some of us. Well, that was a relief. I thought I was bad when the food came in. But you're like, it's just total disinterest. Like, oh, we got to hit the board over here. Like, he isn't no interest in the show and the calls are anything else. It's going out. He's standing there shoveling it down his fat piece. Why don't get four or five meals brought in every day to me. Like you do. I have a big and plead and Ben fetch for food in here. And so far, I've really got. Let's see. I have a Wednesdays once a month from the pickle makers who come in and critique my show. And I've got two days and Thursdays from Michael who's a fan of these in the now at a great Delhi at 1706 Southdale, Mabri. Well, not you all. God, I've got a message here for you. Is that it? This. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. People see things. We haven't had one report this morning. Not one miserable little report this morning on Kurt's gig at Blubber Hill. I mean, I get all the promotion yesterday all the begging, the pleading and nothing. Marvin and Wendy went out there and know that. So that's two more than they would have had. That's probably like a half a dozen. TJ, how about you? Did you go there after the SLA thing? How do you come on? Let's go. People. Oh, I get into my hotel room last night. I turn on the TV. It happens to be on 44 a T.O.G. And what's on the news? What? The FLA thing. That's news. That's a news story. And there's Lionel talking about, wow, we like to press the flush without a stairs and get their end planning. Well, he does. You like seeing how his past lot of his business card proved. It comes to find out the only people that showed up there with the ones who have ever seen Bruce Williams really. Yeah. And it wasn't even on Tuesday. Probably down. But almost 576 WSU and a lastator on AM620 WSU and the trick of the, I was a deep car. Was that Rose? By the way, was that specifically for that bitch? What did you just play? I, uh, why don't you just get rid of her? That would be a sign of the group at the hall. Get out of here. I've been here for what? This is the fourth day. We're starting a patch. You know what? They should've got the thing for you. You know, calls and the thing on tape. She's like a co-host. I'll let you see. I'll let you see. I just can't work on this. I just can't work on this. I just can't work on this. I just can't work on this. I just can't work on this. I just can't work on this. I just can't work on this. I'm not as in one for a couple of months. Here. I think she just has the thing for you, Matt. Let's go to Tampa. I can't be your own the air. WSUN. Hello, Mr. After Mr. Roger. Hey, Mr. Sarah. Welcome to Tampa. Thank you so much. I thought that was the end of the call. No, I wouldn't hang up on you, guys. I just want to say I just, I just turned in. You guys a couple of weeks ago and it's much more, much refreshing from that. That's right, sir. That's right, sir. I'm going to put that fill in late. Yeah, like I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm really going to pay 10 bucks to see those guys. Yeah, or even $9.70. It's more to go see them. Yeah. You know, I'm often, I would have paid 10 bucks to see. I would have gone except I was afraid they'd throw me out. Well, I think just, I don't know, they just too much stick. You know, like old-born, don't stuff like that. That's right. We don't do stick, you're, Matt. You know, Mr. After I want to thank you for the tape and the little letter. Oh, you're quite welcome. Hey, bye, took a do-mouth box personally. My softened fill out the, uh, the, uh, and we'll open everything. Yeah, appreciate it. So you're welcome. And, uh, Neil, um, you know, I, I, to tell you the truth, I do catch your show more than then Bob's just because I get up later. But it's nice that both of you guys on the air, because you sound like you have a good before together. The best. Oh, yeah. You know, people say, well, Jan, they said a little bit of shit. You're creeping you. That's nonsense. You've got a good time, sir. I want you guys to do it. You know, I mean, you guys complimenting each other, you know, you're going to pick up on the other dots. Exactly. That's right. Whatever he doesn't pick up, I do. Let's go to St. Petersburg, St. on the air, W.S. Okay. Yeah. Hi, Bob. Hey, uh, hi, you don't say, okay, Neil, how are you this one? Okay, sir. Listen, if I don't normally call it a flame. Yeah. What? The fire. But yesterday, yeah. I was invited by Tom Delphita, uh, the dollhouse for lunch and the meat-randy roads, right? You know, and he, I hear you guys rip on him a lot, and I've always felt that maybe those little bit on just... Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. I'm fully after today.

Or your rose on tape. We have rose on the phone. We have rose on the phone. You know, I'm not transferred all these, all of these great listeners and callers to your show. That's the only reason you really took a big gun on. I'm not sure in the book. Quite frankly, I'm throwing the towel or put it on. But I can't, I don't, I can't relate to that. Whatever that means. Miami or Richie or, is it Richie? Is it? Miami. I mean, George, but out. We're having a good time with this. And you're, uh, sticking here. Well, just do what you're paid for, okay?

That's what everybody said. Now, do they? They said, man, it sure is around here. We're all brought in here. Well, it's maybe a year. OK. Neil, what's going to you, and what's going to you, and a Friday morning host, blocking a pool of the bayon Cohesity for a webinar at a moment in front of a PBRA in mayor tree. That's not a great day. The first year, it's probably 10 E plants around the Boris. OK. I actually know how to use that green emphasis on the boat. It didn't touch. Anyway,Awーン. What do you think about twanging the boat? Do you want to talk a bit about what it is that you call itself boys. Yes. Yeah. Before we see that you interest me, The Governor of the Stars. Wiset.

But of course in Bob Neill's case, he don't have to worry about. Because his fingers always like right up around there by the left nostril. And it's a natural. He's from Atlanta. Funny that thought where you had your finger. He's a Neil Borts guy up there in Atlanta. He's the David Pong guy. He doesn't want to see me. Turn the label. What? Well Mike Disney poisoned his mind. I'm sure toward me. He didn't want to see me. But he, uh, I don't think he didn't. Disney are like exactly like this. Oh, well, they Disney was shipped in pack back to WCKG in Chicago. Which is desperately dying radio station. Good place for him. Yeah. He'll fit right in there. Yeah. Wonder how Mike celebrated cent Patrick's day. And he's got to figure out how red his nose is by now. It's 11.35 on the IoT network. You can wake up with Bob last year every week. They're morning from 6 to 10 on news talk radio 620 WSUN. Hey, what was the lady talking about it? I don't know. I can change. She doesn't want to be mixed up with the squirrels of the stuff. Yeah. I understand you left out of that. I have talked to you in three to half years. Oh, another one. Another one. Yeah, yeah. I've heard you on the radio. Okay. So, I'm happy. You know, you're waiting for miserable weeks to call me. I know. I found out about a two and I was driving down the road. That's not me. I'm coming back and I tell you. I got a woody. You got a woody. No. Oh, good. How do I do that? By the way, what's the one that was the long time ago? He's a they are Mercury or a, a Dissoto woody. I never left him. Okay. What is the seward anyway? We came mornings from 6 to 10. It's Bob last year on news talk radio 620 WSUN. It's the Neil Roger show. You can talk to Neil live by calling toll free 1-800-944-9463. Oh, Neil. My queen. Okay, 140. All right. Cut the crab at, uh, that I say 140? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Why is when you're having a good time, doesn't it? Yeah. We're working so hard. It's 1140, 20 till noon. We're at our palatial WSUN studios on the shores of the thing here, man. Now you saw, you know, before I hit it in a rock because it is my show. Much. You know, I have a, do they call like a Bayview? All right. Is that the Bay Tampa Bay? That's Tampa Bay. Right in behind the hotel. And this morning, I get up and I open up the windows. And here's the beaches out there. All I will say, pretty sorry filthy fucking beach. Don't go on them. What do you mean, even in a summertime? Even in a summertime, unless you have the overboots and gloves on. Why not? A lot of people like to walk up and down those shores of Tampa Bay with those large green trash bags and collected fish. Oh, seriously. What is the problem back there? Because I thought this is exciting. I'm on the water here. And then I looked at it and looked like mong. Well, that's, because that's what it is. Oh, it is mong. Mong. So if there's anybody in the audience who doesn't know what mong is, just take a drive up to the thing. Don't drink it though. Just drive up. Don't go near it. Okay, let's do, uh, you were about to say something. I interrupted very rudely for which I don't apologize. No, you mentioned Rick and SUDDs, you know. And I was going to say, you saw SUDDs Wednesday, same Patrick's day, but he was allegedly in the bag. Perfectly coherent. He was. I leave that thought, though. Of course, in his case, how do you tell? Exactly. But he looked okay. Yeah. That's a larger blood sugar. 100. What's the test it now? See, you're trying to compare the smoking thing with these M&Ms and during the break. Because you've settled the errands. I'm going to go out there and smoke. Go out there and smoke. Go shout out. When did I say that last week? I don't think you're earlier. I will never smoke another cigar as long as I live. You know why? No, listen to me. Uh, I smoke it. Maybe it was because George gave me those nasty ones. They spliced the end off of the other day and it like got in my tongue and all over my. Those things irritate the cramp out of your mind. I think they're worse than you know. You know, see how all the little people around here are counting on you. Every time I step out my haul, let me want to make smoke and a share of the body comes up. Okay. Peter comes up to smoke and it affects what the person says. Yeah. Well, what did you do? Just get a new pack? Yeah. Well, it changed smoke them now. No, not much. You're not going to say anything to me. That's true. Yeah. They go to help. Pull this show out of the station. In fact, then you can say douchebag. You're a little people are counting on you. Where's the asterion? Well, we don't have an asterion here. Because there's those smoking and the building. What kind of a person is that? Just try to damn good reason. Use my bottle. Okay. Good. God. No time. He's smoking. God. Sugar. Here's a. Now, what is it? What did he do? I got to get the tentative slot after. Oh, Miami is next to sunrise. I'm very confused because Kurt is like doing his best to screw up the show. It's a little bit of a joke. What? The lighter. It's not the lighter back. Nobody cares. What lighter? Do I have your lighter? Oh, there it is. Oh. Isn't he about ready to go home? Don't you need an asterion? Yes, I do. Where are we going now? Are we going to sunrise? My bag. I need an asterion. Good morning. Yes, sir. Good morning to you. How about the morning? Hi, birdie. Hi. How are you? Turn the label. This isn't the island queen. This is the original one. Wow. The island queen. There you go. Yeah. Oh, man. It is. It's island. Hi, birdie. Are you okay? Yeah. It's when I stop to you. How astonishing to hear from the island queen. High Bob. Either. Why are she sitting on birdslaffin? She don't let just to piss me off for what? I don't know. Look at this. They're grabbing each other. You're not fooling anybody. Okay. These are raids. We've seen them a million times. It's not fooling anybody. Go ahead, queen. I'll be so nice to see you again. Yeah. How does he look? He looks fine. Yeah. It's definitely headphones on. He looks like Mr. Spock on a bed day without the ears. With a beard job. Yeah. Better day. Yeah. It's like the good old day. It's like a little reunion here, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's a douchebag. Good name. A dog. High. High lyrically. Probably the best board I've ever worked with. Sorry, George. I know, I feel like I'm working with a guy. Because Neil keeps trying my amycloth. You didn't hear that. You're just a little kiss. Wasn't that sweet. I'm the late bowl. Yeah. Well, I could go Jeff. It's waiting. Okay. Well, make sure you get it. The do a good job. I'll go with it. Okay. See you later. My.. Whatever happened to a guy, I totally forgot him. He wasn't ready to go. He's still there. They were very him. I am Z probably doing morning. He probably did the one with his brother. He's still there. That's what it took his brother and three might into the gutter and he ever crap about that. I wonder what ever happened to Keith. Now there's a guy who probably wouldn't be too good on a job interview. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't give a real good impression. On the phone, he might be a little better. Probably probably couldn't. He gave good thought. If it's a night, if it's a night. Yeah. Like three in the morning with those crayons, he was very good. He was a piece of work. I'll say that. He was different. Yeah. He was sure different. We commented, do the morning show on Zaytta like 435 a clock at a morning. And he was like in the middle of just in wrapping up again, ready to go home. Yeah. From a late night session with this crayola's and his charts, he didn't come to work till five in the afternoon. That's a later. Yeah. Or later. And that's why he walked out because they started demanding that he come in for meetings like in real times when normal people come in and he said, this grew bad. They said, Keith, we're having the meeting to the side or meetings. Is anybody upset that I'm smoking in here? Evan. Are you serious? Haven't heard anything? I'm not inhaling this by the way. I want to go out. The okay, as long as I make a lot of smoke and make a big to do about this. Now, are they going to like rip my ass for a week after I leave now? And they are. Peter said yes. They'll say, what did this? Oh, it's a win ski. On the left. He's got all your slots. Oh, it's like in a voodoo doll and stick all kind of thing. Can I have a smoking in here? I don't see that. It's having a great impact. I don't see any schmutz on a ceiling. It's a lot more trouble. But all the way is a little too warm still. No, shmutz on the ceiling. Oh, no. Oh, it's so comfortable in here last time. In other words, they don't. Did you see that? I have never seen such a limprist in my life. What if I saw that man? No wonder he wouldn't come to the hockey game. Yeah, that's it. Stand up and toss it down, baby. Who the hell are you kidding, Kurt? What's going on? He was playing a little, he was tossing it. Oh, here's the hotline. Hello. Hello. Nail? Yes. How are the faith last night? Is this Melvita? Yeah. Oh, he's smoking. Volvita, he's smoking. Nail can do anything. He won't. Yes, he's there. How do you like that last night? You fed so. So anyway, we had a great seat. And we had a great time. And we found some SUV and listeners all around us. And it was great. Good. Hi, Tom. Are they, hey, bird? How are you feeling, Tom? Huh? Oh, I'm feeling pretty good. Let me see it again. How are you feeling, Tom? The fever's down. And I'm feeling pretty good. But I'm all packed up. You are? Yeah. Well, I noticed that the one that used to be on Kurt's face is missing now. So is there a coincidence? Maybe you picked it up from him. If Kurt were in the boat that I gave him. He's wearing one. Yeah, he's wearing a pink one. He's said, yeah. He was supposed to be wearing a boat today. Yeah. That's all he's got on. He's just got a pink phone on his head and he's like wrapped up like a little holiday package. Leave him alone. Yeah. I was just going to see what the boy was doing. With this guy, you're going to give him a complex and get him neurotic. Oh, no. Susie stole the boat. She's got it on her head. Isn't that so anything you give to Kurt? He's going to give the Susie. You know what I mean? Well, that she's going to give him a box. Yeah, right. He said he's going to give it to her. But I think he's been saying that a long time. She's even she's laughing at that. She said that'll be the day. Well, what time did you turn the radio on this morning, Tom? So what? What time did you turn the radio on? It's been on all day. Oh. And how's it been? What? Jimmy or on it. You know, I got to be honest with you. We've been doing very well up until this call. But you're like, so I understand you're out of the weather. I don't like blow the whole thing out of the water. I was planning on running a place and come up here for a couple of months at a time. That'd be great. It would be great. Come on up. Because I enjoyed a lot better. Although they would get up. So am I smoking in this room? Are they treating us? They're treating us great. And the shorts is deli on Dale Maybrie. I came up with some great stuff. We don't need any more food. We had a feeding frenzy. We had omelets and potatoes and bagels and the beef. The alis and cookies. And then we had one of our listeners come up and actually got the Dennis Liri CD off our hands and all kinds of stuff. And bucked two extra packs of cigarettes so I can change smoke and we're having a hell of a time and we're having a little grab ass. And Bob is actually staying in the face. What if she do not be well and we're leaving? What do I know? Is she on the floor? Neal's distracted. Oh my god. Yeah, whatever's going on in there. I missed an out time. You're saying, God, this is radio. Yeah. If you could only see it. I usually do that. That's what she was saying. If I could only see it. But anyway, what? And Bob's actually staying there past 10 o'clock. He's going to stick around as long as I want because he appreciates it so much that I came in early this morning. And I would have been on a lot earlier except that I was walking around in the halls trying to get my ass in his station. Tom. Peter, let you in, didn't he? Yeah. Okay, no one knew what time you were coming. I'm not touching any of your lines. Okay. Hey, Tom, can Neal stay at your place next time? He was supposed to stay this time. I'll just move in like to the front seat in your car there on the floor and that bottom right hand in the passenger side there. Well, the saw dust is it makes for a nice little bed to lay in. Neal, have you ever had the chicken park? When I was a kid like most people. But you did have them. How long is this going to last? Did they tell you? They mean that call? No. Yeah. Exactly. That's what I had in mind. Okay. When I heard your voice, probably a week and days. Yeah. 14 days. Which is how much longer? Well, I don't know when I actually started coming down with it. Probably Sunday Saturday Sunday. Yeah. So probably I might be back to a dark and Bob door next week. Because Keith Connor told me that you look like crap on wheels, man. He said that you looked like a pathetic. He said it was embarrassed for you. But I don't think so. What's the hell about that? But you would have enjoyed the hockey game last night, Tom? Yeah. A lot of fights, a lot of action, a leaf swan it. But the lighting were right in there. And pot band made a lot of great say. It was a good game. A lot of enthusiasm. And a security guard waves back. No, actually the security guard. You who was to guard. The security guard number 29 went to us when we came in and I said, Listen, Bob and Neil are only names. Okay, kid. Well, listen, Tom. I don't want to blow you up here, but you're blowing me around. Have a great day, Tom, and feel better. I didn't get to call anybody a douchebag. And we're so sorry that we may well send you to your Tom. And I'll smoke another one just for you. Okay, Tom. Hey, thanks for having me. Peter and Kurt said they miss you desperately. Hey, enjoy your stay. And if you believe that, okay, Tom. Well, Peter for his big band club from state to from coach. You don't need to pay to such a picture, such as sad tragic pathetic picture of Tom and his his pox that everybody here at the station actually thought sorry for him for about ten minutes. I'm into that call. Now I feel sorry for us. Yeah. It's 1151. Now it's a possible. On the IOD network. News talk radio 620 WSUN. This Saturday March 20th from 11 AM till 2 PM.

I don't think it's like really on the ear. I mean, I could hear it. But like, oh, spots are available on the new Rhyber Show. Call up Tony Allen. They give a phone number. It's I have never heard a radio station quite like that. It's like he's sitting in a room somewhere or running the board and making a waiting for the phone to ring the salsa spots. And I, again, it's like the house of the, what's what we do here? It's like a monopoly games. Like a hobby. You write just like here exactly. They remind me just before your show on Mondays. They stole the spot for an hour. They had these two ladies to own an erotic toy shop. Ooh. They need to keep a call in and discuss what they want to do and then they've got. Yeah. It's a pretty interesting. A lot of toy store. Yeah. It's a whole different sort of thing that you can't talk about. Really? Like what? Oh, you'd be surprised. Well, they sure went to the right. You could just think this one on your toes. People coming in and, uh, it guy has, like, his friends. Hey, look at, he's still scratching his head. Uh-huh. He said, what you do with that? You stick it on your toes, sis. But anyway, Sally would be upset. What would you have been a really alarming caller, I think? It's a good one. I'm looking forward to it. Thank you. Anything. Yeah. Since Bruce Wilson, I shared today as our birthday. Think of your toes, sis. Yeah. Yeah. The first and I shared today as our birthday. So if you could play the, uh, I'd be fair, demy more part. I'd be, uh, okay. You're definitely a, a blob is hiding at the rock comedy CD around, okay? All right. Have a great day. Okay. Okay. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Newstalk Radio 620, WSUN, St. Petersburg, Tampa, Clearwater, finally entertaining AM radio, not the same old talk. It's the Neil Audrish show.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I, I, I, I don't believe it. Look in that girl. Neil, God. He's a big name, beauty, who's appeared in movies, and you've seen her in the picture show. Yeah, I saw Ghost Bruce. Whills his her hubby, and she's got a little baby that she brings to the studio, right? She may call, try to tone it out, try the clothes, but the clothes she'd never wear, oh, are the clothes that are painted on the girl, who's naked on the cover of the vanity fair. But he's been waiting for me, and I'm a cover of the vanity fair. But he's been waiting for me, and I'm a cover of the vanity fair. And I'm a color of the vanity fair. I'm turning a body now, I'm a god-pick. But I'm turning a passion for skin type fashion, because she's gone out all the way. She got a body by her, who's yours. But he's been waiting for me, and she got a piece, and I'm a rose, and a man who pillows her with them, and she's looking so beautiful in there. But she ain't seen nothing like the extra money, and I'm a cover of the vanity fair. But he's been waiting for me, and I'm a cover of the vanity fair. But he's been waiting for me, and I'm a cover of the vanity fair. And I'm a cover of the vanity fair. I'm a cover of the vanity fair. I'm turning a body now, and I'm a cover of the vanity fair. But he's been waiting for me, and I'm a god-pick. And I'm a cover of the vanity fair. And I'm a cover of the vanity fair. And I'm a cover of the vanity fair. And I'm a beautiful smile, and she ain't even pregnant this time. So anyway, it's a 12-0-8 blob, as good ready to go out of here. As soon as he puts up, that's awful, foggy that he's smoking. What are you laughing about? The only reason why I told you about it, is that you've bunched up, is because I smoke one in here, and I like Felvita. So are you going to weigh in there? I'm not smoking, man. I would have tried to do it to me, and trouble. Yes. I just smoke a foggy, you know? He's smoking it in here. He's doing it. He lit it up. It's burning over here. You're a trouble, man. You're a trouble maker. And you're a blow-hard man. I agree. So anyway. I've heard anyone. Anyway, you're going to be getting out of here in a couple of minutes. Go home, take an app. We're going to have a great dinner. Don't tell us tonight. The only thing that bothers me is having red... And we still have had no comment about that. About what? About that thing in the tab, a tribune. Of course not. Why? Well, you mean the court nod. You ought to come back Wednesday, man. How do you want the court to be part of it? Here's a big spread, if I can say that, in the local newspaper. And I got only knows where they surveyed these people, except maybe at the unemployment line. And one of the best of this and the best of that. And the best hamburger they got checkers. And a town that's got steak and shake. The an an crystal for that matter. And what's the best pizza pizza hut, which is really colorful. The an the best. Why does this so at the risk of bringing your show down? Why does this surprise you? I called you. The Italian restaurant, the Olive Garden, which is industrial strength. No, no, no, no. Best. I call you about a month before I get this gig. Right? Did I not? And I said, you know, tell me about working mornings. And you said, well, you know, I don't really know. It's all we did. We played records and then we suppose that we took some call. This is not mornings anymore. This is the middle of the day. And they're still not talking about it. Well, you have a distilled morning mentality. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not. What about them? What about what they're doing? Yes, they do. But I'm not here. They're going to be over and over again. Maybe nobody reads the goddamn temperature. Maybe everybody reads the same feet times and you were saying it today. Because they like the history of it. Everybody cares. Maybe nobody's like following along with the pictures and you were saying today. Maybe nobody finds it unusual. Maybe their favorite restaurant is the oligarchen. And you're insulting the hell out of them. People love the oligarchen. Oh, yeah, some people do. I love it. I can't believe it. This is sick of your neurotic one. You have to be joking, aren't you? People I talk with that brown curdled up lettuce. I don't like it at all. You know, I've been there. How would you say earlier? You're talking up to Neil Mann. You're talking up to Neil Mann. Yeah. You're talking up to Neil Mann. Yeah, geez. Everybody. I think you're going to get your job back. You're going to tell him to prove you'll like the oligarchen. No, he doesn't. Especially with the salad. No, he doesn't. He said too many good free meals to have that better. I just don't get it. I just don't understand it. And checkers. Checkers I've never been to. You can't work with me if they were free. I don't know. I can shake it. If I want to hand over. We've had a checkery career. But I mean, checkers. Checkers is like rallies. You know what rallies is? Vickly. Yeah. Same kind of thing. It's where people who only have like loose change. And nothing over a dime. Okay. No, seriously. They drive through there. They reach big down deep. They scour through the car. And they feel the change. And they like toss it at the drive through. And that's it. That's what that is. Okay. So I guess checkers and the oligarchen aren't going to be advertising any time soon on WS-1 or W-I-O-D or W-W-C. Of course, in four miars, you don't make any difference. We're going to be advertising on W-W-C-N. I don't get it. How does he pay the electric bill over there? Well, I don't even know how to make four miars. I have the knowledge, aren't you? They don't. Thought it up skill mark. What do they have in four miars? Besides a lot of old decaying dry up people. They have the erotic. What is it, women? What is it? What was that? Oh. Oh. George said they got... That's what he said. They have the erotic toy store. In four miars? It's not what the guy said. And then we're all in the night. But now, it was that old lady got confused. It was a candle shot they opened on. Erotic toy store. Are you out of your inventory? No, no. That was the guy who had his tosis. Yeah. Yeah. And he was talking about this erotic toy store. And they didn't know it was. I hallucinated. It's Sally open up a business in four miars. What's going on? What a sense of humor. I wonder how that energizer bunny is doing with her. You know, she does use this kind of battery. Did you know that? You know why? Is it keep going? It's her writing notes. No, that's right. You were personal. He's writing a personal note. Oh, God. I'm just shocked. I'm just shocked. And he's like drawing a picture too. You know, that disgusting, correct god almighty. And talk about an exaggeration. So how are we doing on the phone guys? I don't plan on taking any calls the rest of the day. No, we'll take one or two. Now you're sticking around, right? If you insist. I insist. And you're leaving. God, I insist. Oh, okay. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. He didn't get something wrong. I don't want you to be grumpy. You're out loud. You're out loud. Yeah. Here isn't a hint. Deal. Special me. Shut up my mic. I get it. Now listen, how do I? Well, I don't want to curte to feel bad or feel anything. But just before during the news, I was reading out. Did you type it on the screen? Also? Yeah. Then what? You just came in here to be close to me again. So you could write this. I don't understand. If I come back here often. He might even shake my hand. I doubt it. You want to try it? You don't do that. You don't think he'll do it. Come on, Kurt. Just one time. Doubtful. You don't think he'll do it. No. Come on. Let's see if he'll do it. I wouldn't do it. What do you shake my hand? Yeah. You see this? This is an interesting exercise. I think this is a... Hey, look at her. Hey, you got a bucket. He's got a bucket. Just a joke. Get out of here, Kurt. It says if you thought the pizza from floor is had a lot of onions before you went and see nothing yet from Marvin and George burping and farting. And it says on the bottom of the thing which I read which is your Kurt type. If you thought you couldn't get it on there, how about the message? Put it up on the... It wouldn't fit a shop on there? Yeah. Everything he says is another line. If you notice that, the guy is just... He wouldn't check my hand. It's okay, blah, we'll see you later.

That was one of the most frightening exercises I have ever seen in my life. Oh look at that. Oh my god. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You see that? How his little finger crossed, little pinky girl. No, it did. Look at that. When somebody shakes hands with you and they do this, What does that mean? What's already here is in a face. Yes. Kurt, it's just a radio show. Susie, will you talk to him? Please. I want to hear it. He just did. No, it's just seriously. Shake my hand. He went like that. What does that mean, Susie? He did. He did. And then he was in here and he drew a picture. He looked like the state of Florida, I thought. God, it's just a show. If I knew that he was so uptight about this, I'd picked on somebody else. Although I can't find anybody in the building to pick on. No, there is no, you're right. Well, I wouldn't say personality is the word. But anyway, great. Go get busy and do something. Well, you're getting nervous. Anyway, that was incredible. I mean, how many people have you shaken hands with your life who went like that? And I can't do it on the radio. But it's like with the little finger like, you know, never. That's like a message. It is. Isn't it? I don't know. Wouldn't you think so? Well, it's like a silent message. Well, it's like if you went in the elevator and somebody ghost you, it would be like a silent message. Wouldn't it? What the hell? Okay. And you know what they say at the metro zoo, you can't pass up a ghost. That's what Ron McGill always says. But what is the message? So anyway, Joe Gerston's in jail.

We don't want to forget Steve. Do we, George? No. Just in case for him. No, we don't. Just in case for next year. So we only got four calls now or what? Because I don't really plan on taking any. Do we have a bunch of calls? On six calls. We have said that's pretty good. Because Keith is in there showing, given instructions to Kurt and how to do something. I don't know what he was banging on something. So anyway, let's do a mobile insane Pete. Oh, I see what he's doing. He's got a whole enthusiasm. Is this something new? What keeps wife going to think about this? Oh, she's at home. She don't care. Hello. I got some news for you. Okay. Okay. I need to check this every day. You like it? Yeah. Oh, good. Wow.

You got to be kidding me. Are you serious? You realized that there are people in other parts of the state not to mention the much-dreaded Miami and Fort Laterdale. We would kill for a steak and shake and you guys are eating a checkers. Well, there's one over in like one that I stopped at one time and I got a steak and shake. Yeah. We have three. I want to milk shake and start with. Yeah. I got milk. Actually, shaking. That was about it. There's still shaking it. Oh, they were shaking. Maybe they didn't finish shaking it. Oh, it was for it. He was really working. He made me hell. He was good. It made me hell. You know, speaking of making you ill, I am watching a scene in here. Are you trying to convince us something because we remain unconvinced to is he okay? She is like sloppered all over anybody. Over every guy in the building, she and Peter are like hugging and kissing. George would like to be in on this. I'll tell you that. Absolutely. Yeah, bet you.

Feel good. Okay. Have a great day, pal. Excellent. Not again the drift of it. He actually responded. And even though we may have not agreed with his response, well maybe we ought to try checkers. Although I'm not eating meat. Maybe you ought to try it. Do you have a checker in Lakeland? Yeah. But I'm kind of hooked. What would you be willing to try it? I guess so. Over the weekend. Hmm. I know so Monday you can call in with a report. This will see this is like almost a topic. Oh, God. Ah. Ah. So in other words, you don't want to be the guinea pig. I'm going to hand up on that. No. But I think that you could do the drive through. Okay. Huh? Well, I like almost like a Rick and Suds thing like a drive through challenge. Oh. Okay. The challenge is whether you come out of the library or not. I think about it. But you know I got this kind of like going to Carl not Carl's Duneers. That the one where they had the thing Carl Junior in California. Yeah. Wasn't it Carl? No. It was a jacket of Bach. Yeah. That's the payphone challenge. Drive through challenge. Yeah.

What was that? Alan, uh, blue work, blue work. Clueless. I do it, gliss. I think he was in a hockey game last night. I can't, and I do want to say, how come that guy who is like the, uh, the real groupy there and right in front of a blob last night, who was like a barrel of fun and allowed mouth and a good guy. He never recalled in today for about the hockey game. Because I wanted to tell him that Dave Andrew Chuck and Dave Ella were both out of our line of last night, two of our big important stars. So don't keep making excuses because you guys played just fine and handled your unbeatous and all the fights but lost in the game. So I guess if you're like a macho man, it's more important that you win the fights even if you lose the game, right? Even you would agree with that. Oh, right. No question. Okay. We've got, uh, I think Dave and Brown are probably like laying down a little bit again. Thanks, sir. You have keyweights on the starline. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yeah. Is it better there? Yeah. Can I ask him a question, please? Yeah. Do you paint your bald spot? Oh, no. Is this a rumple, Neil? He'd like to respond, you sure, okay? Please. I don't have a bald spot. Maybe he's like a kater that's right, paper, isn't he? Well, go on and get a case, how's that? Send him to that jump guy. Maybe he can do marical. Okay. Have a great day, come on. Well, if we had time, we'd paint the bald spot. We started now. I think by next program, my favorite is to jump. I like that call better than the previous. Yeah. A lot better than Helen Glyss and the chic of AeroB, writing it on his horse through an Aples or whatever, he was talking about. I have no idea what that was. From the Yorknall. He must have been confused with Aperacial, huh? He called from New York. And you believe Aperacial would like, oh, and even the players, even players to get the New York Post. That is right, man. And there's a hersfield theater in South Florida, isn't it? Right. Yeah. In fact, that's the only place when you go and you pay your money to get the ticket they spitting your face. Yeah. Yeah, stay there. Any hair. Now, how many calls we got George? Because I'm a little bit nervous here, even alive. What? Cinco. Five. But don't start with this ass, financial. The first we got a guy in Hebrew. Now we got Cinco, Cinque, all the way. Oh, yeah. And Oive. Oh, you know, he's driving into the yonkers in the 10th race tonight. We have a, what was the guy's name? Mario's one at a, okay. In date, 7519463 and Broward 524 and our out of town lines. And we're not even giving these numbers. And that's probably a bad mistake. Because I don't know what they are. I think it's 1-800-944, yeah. 9463. And we'd like to get a lot of response about steak and shake. I can't, I cannot believe that there's, I mean, different strokes for different folks. And it was a good guy. But he just got crappy taste except the show. He likes checkers and he hated steak and shake. That's not possible. Well, yes it is. If I were still eating meat and a lot of grease and fat and stuff like that, I would be at Stake and Shake right now just clawing my way in the inside. I'd be grabbing at it. You remember the story was I would be just reaching out to touch it. Oh, God. Yeah. Three years ago when I moved up here to Lakeland. And the first night in town, where did I go to eat? Do you ever get out of the house? I have never, seriously. Other than, you know, you don't get WL, yes you do. WL are on a cable over here. You know, a ceremony, Kessler that does the noon news with the white ghostly faith. Forget about the nuts. Okay, he's like, he's like, sir, I'll leave without the nuts. Pasty, white complexion. I mean, doesn't she ever let you out of the house? No, seriously, this is Florida. Okay, I realize it's the winter time. But that's dangerous man. That is right and pasty and a complexion too. So anyway, what? Oh, what was I saying? I was talking about the first night I moved to, I didn't say pasty. Okay. I said pasty. I went to Stake and Shake the very first night. I was here. We got caught up a day. I was booking it. Yeah. Let me know. You can sleep there. Can you rest? Why didn't you go to the hospital? Hey, you didением to be back at aestey regenerative hot water. No one in your family could take it. They couldn't.
