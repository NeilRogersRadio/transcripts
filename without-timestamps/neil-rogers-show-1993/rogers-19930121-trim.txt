Joan Collins speaks over a month. I'd love to hundreds of men over the year. Okay, just this morning. Hey, guys. I've created a perfume to be giled to a trot. What's the favorite? I really don't cook it up. If you get it right. Exactly the same as what you do. Joan Collins, floppy seconds. The perfume to have to be honest. Just remember, more than you want. Like my perfume. You know you. Yeah. How are you? You've been doing all these things. You've been doing a lot of things. Every morning, a bottle of atomizer or fire extinguisher size. With a very similar setup, we got a beautiful board. We're sitting right out here by the water. It's palatial. The pelicans are dropping on the renegades. And this is great. Are we on? Are they getting anything? Hello, America. I feel like Lloyd Lindsay Young would know math. We still don't know. That's where it is here. We're just talking to each other. And the engineers have got their finger in there, Ron. Miami lost. Oh, we're gone. What are you? Oh, and Ryan. They brought one. They're going to go down the board down there and he can't find you. Has none of this been on in Miami? No. But it's good. The practice camp either. It hasn't been on in Tampa either. So no. Been on in the production room. Oh, well that's good. We can do a show for the guys in the production studio. How do you like it so far? Yeah. Either. No. They're going to give us a signal right there. How do you like it so far? Either. It's on. It is. It is. We're on. We're just like saying that's great. It's just great. It's just like that. It's on. WVP. Oh, my gosh. That's good. I'm going to get out of my starboard. Who? Who? WVP. Are we on a Miami? No. No. I'm going to get out of my starboard. In 75 of the Paul beaches, KB degrees in Miami. So, guys, I steal the bits from the radio. Hey, what many fit been dollars? I steal some diamonds. I steal the bits from the Neo-Roger show. Hey, that's ponderous. You disrespect. Oh, you'll hear it. A very nice field man that I make them mind. I have the creativity of a fly. I steal bits from the Neo-Roger show. It may not be as bad as it will think. So, yeah. All right. Let's take it to the call. I'm tired of this. I'll take it up at you. Join us this afternoon to getting it to for those wild and crazy guys written suds and it's six. It's sports dog six tears. This is the Neo-Roger show. Right. I'm going to try it. Go, go. Go, go. You're not getting questions. We're going to be doing this for two hours. I think we're going to. This is a study. It's open high and under the board and there are one. All the S.U.N. people have been taken hostage by a jay core and open is behind the whole thing. It's a pot. It's a pot. What they don't understand though is we're used to this. We enjoy it. We're having a good time. It really brings back some old memories of the best. So we're not on the air, right? Guys. They say nothing. They don't say yes or no. In other words, they don't know what the hell's going on. So let's just say a few choice words. We'll see. Then we'll get an answer right. Ben. Huh? That's the deal. Tom. Belveda. What's the deal? Tom. Tom. But how come we didn't hear the car? We heard the car. You didn't hear the car. We didn't. We sure is. We heard it. Oh, you're right. Well, how come we don't hear it? Why does it have to be in queue? Dave's one. Dave's one. Dave's one. Dave's one. Dave's one. Dave's one. Please. Can I get another one. No, I can. Wait a second. Okay, now I want to hear it. And that's. I don't hear in the oh Roger. I do not hear it. Wait a second. I am here. This isn't Where are you taking Qfu? Were you sending Qfu? What is he from? What is he from? like this is a major cuter out. Any idea what I'm doing here with this be-one talent. Floppy's second day to the art the perfume to have when you're having more than more. Like my current talent. But not the work. It's got the only product. It's just like Joan Collins, Floppy's second. More in-bottle, atomizer, or fire extinguisher, not coming any minute now. Well, I don't think he's going to come in here at this point. I can't blame him. Well, I want that to be great when some people are in here alone playing with this equipment every day, huh? That'll be really great. So what's the deal? Are we on? We don't know. We don't know. Now, why you give me headsets? What's he going to do? He won't hear the car. It got a- We have- Can I have a- You're going to aim one at each of us? I'm going to aim something at you in a second. Believe me. Okay. Anyway, it's 10-15-10-14 something like that. And we're on the air. We don't believe we're on the air. I think they're just facifying that. So we don't go ballistic here now, right? Nobody's on here. This is a joke. It makes back this big flood of memories from Zeta. Yeah. We really, really on here. George, we've been taking hostage. Please call emergency immediately. And I'll get us to the hell out of here. So anyway, I get in here yesterday afternoon. Tom Belvita and Todd. What the hell is Todd's last name? Oh, Lisa. He doesn't have a land name. Lisa is in a Lisa Campbell. And they meet me at the airport and I get my rental car. And they give me directions. And I go to a polacial. I mean an incredible hotel. And I'm like in staying at- What are they call those things? Like in the penthouse. I mean, in the suite, the most beautiful, the most incredible. And really polacial. You just couldn't believe it. Not your socks off. And of course, they didn't wear any socks. And then they picked me up and took me to an incredible. And he walked out of here again. To a phenomenal hotel in restaurant. I must say that immediately, the food in Tampa is if that's a barometer. Yeah. Because we know Bern steakhouse, everybody knows that. And we know Crystal and Stake in Shake. You bet. But they took me to an hotel in restaurant on Dale Mavery, which is just down to road from Crystal. And right across the street from the very prestigious building pancake camp. And it was from Mendus. From Mendus. I'm telling you. What are you laughing about? Well, you know, you haven't changed. He's still laughing. It's not funny. It's not funny. He's still laughing. I always just think that. Is this an audition for the Joey Reynolds show? Not at all. I'm telling you, I just knew there was a reason why he came here. So early, it's an audition for Joey. Bill Marshall is getting still. He just can't tackle like you can't. He can't do it. He can't do it. He's original. He's always best. Yeah. That's what Joey is doing in his cast. Trust me. It proves that all things aren't always true. So anyway, we have this tremendous meal. And then, Bill Vita takes me back to my hotel. I go back up to my palatial. I mean, and there's like a bath. They put a bathroom about FOIA, and there's like dancing violinists in the, well, almost. And here's a big platter like vegetables and dip. Well, we said dip on it. I think they were talking about me. And seriously, in the many bars, like having your own convenience stir up there, they are really doing this right. I want, and I called up Randy on here. I was so excited. And I want to repeat it again. Everybody on our staff, including Rick and Suds and Randy, I was going to say, and Jim, but I don't think I want to say that because he might take me up on it. Should the kiss me all over my body, because we had a tailgate party a week ago Sunday, the one for the San Diego game. And Bob Green and little Torpey Bob have you ever seen him with David Paul Neal. He's going to show up at the tailgate party. And I just seize the opportunity, you know what? Because Bob Neal is such a, when a guy has like an imposing presence, like Nick Trigoni, I'm not saying he's imposing, but he does have some, he does have like a broken nose. So he really knows some important people. And you don't want to step on his toes. But Bob Neal is such like a nebish. Yeah. And so you don't have any compunctions about like jumping all over. We're just grabbing a bite of the neck and picking him up and just shaking him all over it. Like get some crap done, man. Take care of us. Treat us like stars. So we have gone from, originally was going to be on the only one coming over. Yeah. I'm going to have to hitchhike. They're going to put me up at the YMCA from that kind of an ambiance to royalty treatment. We've gone from one extreme to the hysterical opposite where everybody gets a Randy's getting a Lincoln town car when she comes in today. No. Oh, yeah. You're serious. Yes. Yes, I am serious. You know what this can be like when you go back home to be pressing? Yes. And I hope that Mitch Wayne is listening right now. By the way, because we're sitting here we got a polacial. I got my own board. I can control the levels. I can shut his mic off, which I'm looking forward to. Yeah. There we go. It's like Kyle Eisenberg. Yeah. And we got like equipment up the ass here. If I can say that and we got these beautiful, what are these? Dean? Dean on the CD player. CD players? I mean like state of the art that you're right. Like we have in the coast. And we can't have on the AM because it's only a Puky AM station within H. Jeremy Day. Yeah. Right. This is like downtown man. Plus we have WSUN Country Music fans. We got Country Music on a dance. Yeah. So for those of you who loved Rick on a stick and Neil on a stick, you're going to love picking your nose on a stick. Or with a stick. As a matter of fact, it's got like a little thing in there. And yet it says right nostril and left nostril. And she'll show you which one you can pick with. I want to try again. Can I try a cart which one? Well, what did he do? He said, okay, I'm going to point my head. My head is guy. He said I'm going to point a head. So that's all right. What does that mean? I'm going to point a head. Said at each one. Well, it's there. You get one side. I get the other. Are we going to hear it through there? Well, let's see. Let's try it. A good question. I mean, it could be four hours of agony or four hours of ecstasy all depending upon what you say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was Bob. Who? You know, where's the control for that? Where's the level on the, you're asking a lot. Wait a minute. Here we go. Yeah. That's great. It's not you don't have the sense that you're on here anywhere. So I'm happy to say almost anything now. Not even close because you're so loose and so relaxed. It's like a dry run. Yeah. Can I say that? If you don't know. I think like being like, say dry run now. Nothing like being like, oh, yeah. They just the runs. Which I think I had after. So what was the name of that restaurant time? Tom. You know, I got news for him. And this guy has got a personality like my dogs and this guy is such a, the restaurant, the great Italian restaurant where we ate at last night. Which all time kept talking about us, how everybody had their nose out of joint. I kept doing like this. Is that man want to live or not? It keeps, oh, there's Guido and he keeps pushing his nose after this. That's not a good way to make friends and influence people taught. What is it? Don't tell. Don't tell. I want to show you how much cloud we got in this market already. Okay. Because having been over here like about 12 hours, everybody in this whole area should be over here kissing our ass right now. Don't you agree? Absolutely. Even would put our signal into this place. Yeah. Oh, dude. Don't it? Tell us. Don't it? Tell us? Yeah. Yeah. What I mean, this man is on top of it. God. And if you ever get soft, now here's the next excitement. Look, the phone calls are starting to come in. Now will we take a call? You want to take one now? I want to take one. I want to take one. I do a break. Yeah, let's see if it works. Okay. Hey, George. We're going to see if it works. Here's a. Now wait a minute. Are we going to hear the call the same way we heard? The cart? Do it. Do it. Do it. That was George. Do it. Do it. Are we going to hear the caller over the headphones? Hey, just put a lid on a hot shot. Okay, I'll talk to Guido about you. If you don't cut the craft. Um. We're going to hear it in a little speaker. Okay, let's punch it up, George. Like I said, four-laternale. What the hell is going on? Hey, yeah. It worked. How time? Now where's that coming? Here we go. Are we on or are we on? Hey, that's part of the ambience that we enjoy, man. Don't go pee in on our parade, okay? Oh, no, I'm not. Hey, do you know what I'm saying? Let me see if this works. Oh, yeah. Hey, you're doing it. We are doing it. So what's going on over there? What are we missing? Well, nothing today. So far. Tell him, I don't know. I don't know. I will tell you this. When I drop Randy off at the airport, I'm going to tell him what a good time he's in for. When you drop Randy off? Yeah, I'm taking it to the airport this afternoon. Who is this? It's Lenny's a limo drive. Oh, Lenny's a limo guy. I heard you Lenny. Were you listening last night when I called Randy with a great call? Oh, I must have missed. What happened? Like I said, yeah. Yeah, I'd be there, Lenny. No, I, you can actually hear you. I was at barely. We can barely hear you. And now is this going to control that level or what? Wait a minute. I can barely hear you. Oh, yeah, I got it. Yes. Yes. Let's hear it for the WSU and engineering staff. And these guys are on top of it. And if they ever get off of it, man, it's going to be big news. You sound better on the phone. I could hardly hear you before. Oh, no, you go because I just cranked it up, man. There you go. I just reached over and cranked that baby went to the lake over there. It's great. It's beautiful. They got like pelicans over here and they got like vast wilderness. And you can smell the salt in the air and you can breathe. Are you in a mall? Are we at a mall? Are you in the mall? No, we're in the radio station where the Polatial beautiful state of the yard WSU when you could get off the forest studios. Yeah, when you first went on, I was like, what's going on? I heard all this mumpo jump on them. Yeah, that's what we're here for. Less than mumpo jump. In fact, that's what we're having for lunch. Mumpo jump. This is great. Well, you guys don't like you're having a good time on it. We're having a great time. The bird is here. We have a special, a surprise guest coming in any moment who may reconsider the whole idea with the things going on. So listen, Lenny, what's the deal? You're taking her to the airport. Take her to the airport. And I want you to tell her that Tom Velvita and I, how do you like that? The King and Queen are going to be there to pick, I'm not sure which is which. Pick her up at the airport because the time is never better before. Oh, okay. I'm taking her up at two. So she should be in there. Right. And then I'm going to take her in her beautiful town car. I'm going to go with her to the hotel and show her the palatial diggs over there. Get her situated. It's going to be great. She has never had royalty treatment like this. Well, you may come off the plane suddenly. I'll bring her a little bottle of champagne. Great. Well, tell her just to rush up to me and kiss me all over my ass immediately. Okay. Let her know. Okay, Lenny. All right, deal. Have a great day. Bye bye now. Bye. Okay. Oh, my god. The day is lost. Oh, let's over. Hey, it's lost. It is all over. Oh, I knew what I knew it. So anyway, why don't we keep hearing that voice over in over 10, 28 were brought casting from the the spikken span, the polatial, the so clean. It's almost nauseating studio. No, sir. It's sterile is the word that comes to mind. It's beautiful. But there's a certain amount of sterility. Okay. Like there's IOD. No, listen to me. There's IOD on the one hand, which is basically like a toilet because it's been abused. And because people who are there have no respect for the equipment and they write on stuff and it's like it's like crappy. Okay. And this is the ultimate other extreme. Okay. Where it's like so sterile. It's almost like a like there's going to be some kind of open heart surgery in here. Yeah. Well, that's an FLA. There's going to be the open heart surgery. So anyway. I mean, it could be four hours of agony or four hours of ecstasy all depending upon what you say. Uh, look who just happened to pop in this studio here this morning. Bob. Bob on tapers. Bob line. Oh, wait a minute. Listen. First I got a you want phones. What a pretty young man. A little bit. Hey, one head phone. Yeah. Just a minute. Wait a minute. Happy birthday to Adam. We love you, sweetie.

Birthdays are an important part of our show. I like what you want to do. Yeah, that's for damn sure. Not so fat. And you either, Bob. Boy, I tell you between the two of us we've lost like probably a whole Opie. And I was kidding about that. And maybe even a Bob Neo. If you want headphones. Yes. Well, there are headphones here. I don't want to do anything. But then I'm not going to hear. Go ahead. Have some headphones, Bob, last. Oh, Primadan, I get your own headphones. I want my headphones. Nurse, Brad, you've got to get my face here with a head for. See, he won't perform without headphones. Yeah, that's what his wife said. Jesus. His wife says he will not perform without head for us. For at least part of it, anyway. 1030 at the Wild. What did the Schmendrix done for Myers-Must think of this? All right, let's take a call while he's trying to get his body put together again. Now, I don't understand what they owe. I see. So in other words, we've taken the lines and what we've done is I got a clear water. Hello. Good morning. Welcome to the West Coast. Yes, sir. I got a tremendous, the air is fresh. The birds are dropping it. It enormous stuff on our heads. It's great. Well, I was at the game Sunday. And you signed my poster for me. I really appreciate that great. Brad, lady, sign it. It was good to meet you. Well, it was great to be head, man. I'm bringing my sister down to beach. I don't have clear water. Great. Clear water, mall Saturday, 230 to 430. We want at least 5,000 people. Okay? Him the frog. Huh? Him the frog. Yeah, him the frog. Yeah, she'll be there. What are you doing up to? Oh, Bobbi, wait a minute. You don't have to. I can't wait. I'm going to talk to the caller because I cannot hear the caller in my head. You will not hear the caller in my head. Oh, man. You guys want to reconsider. This man is the biggest pedadana in the business. Okay. I cannot hear the caller in my head. No, no. You're not going to hear me. No, you're not going to hear me. Are you? I don't know. You hear it. Go ahead, talk guy. Oh, scarpon. What are you doing? Hold on. Okay. Get his cords untied. Hold on. I'm sure you didn't hear it on tie lines. That's it. So we can get me here the damn thing. I'm sitting here. I know that I'm on the ear. I can function. This guy's like, oh, God, he's got to hear those deep tones of his own voice. We've already been back. He's got up this ear for him. Yeah. Can you hear that? Oh, yes. Better. It's better. Okay. Boy, what's up in the head? I can't hear the guy. It's on mobile as hell. Since he put the headphones on man, so I can't put a stock over your head. It's on mobile as hell. Can you understand what he said? No, no, can't understand a word you're saying, man. You are so muffled and sounds like you got 40 pounds of Bob Neal in your mouth. Hey, so Bob is going to be down there tomorrow. Bob is going to be at the mall Saturday. That is correct. He's going to join us for a little appearance just to say hi to his old friends in Tampa and just well, about Pyrrotte O'Connor. Bob, I'm working. I'm going to be at the, uh, say, marginal, marginal. The pens of getting enough security. I think it's a free of you. Yeah. Well, listen, so you're in a water? Yes. And how is the beginning of the show today? It's like I said, it's definitely good. Don't need to tease all of the you have WSU and signal. If you could get inside Tom Belviness car and just take a whiff of the aroma of hedges. Seriously, aroma of hedges in that car. I have never seen anything so filthy, so disgusting, so gross. I mean, here's this. They're really doing it a big putting us in these polatial digs and he picks me up in a car that I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Himmler, man. I've never seen anything like in my life. I'll have a great day, pal. I'll see you in the water. Do you speak? Okay, wait a minute. Go ahead. Get it over on Daniel and your, do you speak? Oh, okay. See you Saturday. Have a great life and get out of our face. Am I right? Oh, you haven't seen it as car. So Bob, Blanceter is here and what brings you by Bob? Oh, just, uh, the favorite movie. Passing by, I heard that you're going to be in talent, uh. They can't talk. He can't talk with the headphones on. He can't talk with the headphones, or what happened to my other last-inter-car. Yeah, this is exciting. All right, now Lancer can take one or two approaches. If he wants to, I'll be telling Monday, I'll know seriously. He can always do that. He can always practice that or he can go back to to that. To his trademark, which means you're going to have to put a sock over your mouth when you start talking on this station. What? What was one? That noise. That's you, man. That's your trademark. That's the mark that you've left that you imprinted on the S of I-I-R-Compations app. From Tampa to Chicago to back to Tampa again. We, we don't talk about Chicago. I was bigger than you. Well, I should have brought my WSJs along. Yeah, I'd have been great. Now I've been a great man. And great. Just for, you know, let's do a couple hours on Cap City's broadcasting. How much you love their ass? And they will do like the last two hours on J-Corp. Oh, yeah. That cover's the whole show today. I'll just get up and leave now. Oh, seriously. They are treating us so well. I'm not used to this. I'm going through culture shock. Because this is Cox Broadcasting, isn't it still owned by Cox? You bet. That's a monology. As a matter of fact, when you work for this company for 25 years, I didn't know this, but Henry Barrow told me this, that some companies give you a watch when you retire. And they give you a beautiful ring. It's known as the Cox Ring. What's wrong with you? Yeah. After your first year, you get it. It's another class. And you notice, I would not have said that in Miami. OK, 1035 on A-I-O-D Network. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Ah-mm. Ah, Martha, you can't get up. What do you mean? Yeah, the older I'm getting the tougher it is to climb out a bed and stop today. George doesn't know it, but this morning he's getting prudent. A brand new breakfast drink that'll get him open active before he knows it. Here, honey. Drink this. Mmm, not bad. Tastes like Grembery, Juicy and Dunna. I'm feeling good. I feel like I could move a mountain. Come here, you little muffin. Oh, George. So let age get you down. Try the new breakfast drinks, sweeping the rest homes of America. You're prontang. Prontang. It's Thor's everywhere. What's Nappel, too, Bob? 1039. I W I O D. W S U N. And W W W C N. I hope I just did nothing about them. They're never here about them. We'll be a bad Tony Allen. We just don't give a crap about you today. OK, we got more important crap going on here today. Speaking of crap, so Bob Lasseter is here with us the Victorian tones. And I can just hear that staff meeting at FLA this afternoon at noon. I'm just here, I'm just here. Oh, me! See a Thursday to go over there at noon. So what day did you start, Bob? Oh, they, they, they, they, they, they don't start. They're gonna start on the wrong foot, man. I'm telling you, don't start that foamy of the craft. I'm not going to hire you over there. They found a better talent from them. Well, they hired you over here. Bob Lasseter starts on WSUN any day now. Well, well, Monday at February 1. Monday for more efforts. The week from next Monday, Lasseter's gonna be on at what time, 6 to 10 in the morning, doing morning grab. We finally got a lead in. We finally got a lead in which means getting up at about 3.30 in the morning every morning. And getting in like two pounds of mucus out of your assynuses. Going to be a kind of like a mad dog's breakfast diner, where we'll be serving bitter coffee. I will be the early waiter. What the hell is that? I have no idea. Yeah. In other words, we have no idea what you're gonna do. We will need a money. The executive is a, a cox they loved the idea. So here's the deal, all you, and we, I don't want to hear from all those old ladies, please I'm begging you because he could clear the whole deal if I can use that expression. It comes out of the whole thing. The, the encestry. Yeah, right. Trust me. Uh, if the first call about Lasseter being on S.U.N is, hello Bob. It's so wonderful. We're so exciting. And he would change you a lot of when our callouts to me, bad. That's it. Well, why is it those calls are a key for you? That's why they have the escape clause and not trust me. Okay. So there you go. S.U.N Tampa Bay, Lasseter returns. And at just a time we saved until about 20 of so that by noon, they can have lots of kale, pectate for the FLA staff meeting today. I've been here since like, you know, the crack of dawn. I've been hiding the, uh, I think they're ashamed of me. So in other words, this is a first. I was saying to the bird that this is one of the few times in a history of the business that anything has been kept under wraps because I've known about it for about what two weeks. Something like that. And it never seeped out. No, it didn't have a clue. It didn't have a clue. What was going on? No. And nobody is going to have a clue. Well, inside the building, they didn't know about this. That was right. They all have sour looks on their faces now, but they'll get over it. And no, the good part of it is nobody's getting canned. When you feel bad if people were getting blown out for you to be on an arcade movie, one. Oh man. Oh, you just broke his day. No, no, you know what, what goes. What goes around comes around. So in other words, you would like to have some people feel the same medicine. You got when you got your ass to toss.alps. I, I know, whoa, that's not, they just, that's not true. Yeah, not really true. It's not, not really what happened. Yes, it is. It's got fired man. I got the canned. Fired. Thermal show. Wow. Did you have a great show up there? It's a crappy station. Well, I, what, what, what really happened to Nellis, I was doing great. And then I, I, I like all the strange in Miami. And I had him leave your show every day and send into me. Yeah. And I sat home every night and I transpired. Everything that you said, and I went in the next day and did your day. I think you got that. I had to go to the other side. I started doing that about seven, eight years ago. When you started doing that. Oh. Let's take a con. Get these phones smoking. I have no idea what's going on in the phone because the phones are coming in down there. Okay. Five, two, four, W.I. would be in Broward. Five, one, W.I. would be in D.D. And D.D. you cannot smoke in here. I'm not that I'm interested. But you can't smoke in here. Mm-hm. No, seriously, is that true or what? Well, and 1,800, 94, 4,4, W.I. would be on the Tampa line. That line should be smoking as I would be. If that line isn't smoking now, if all those old ladies aren't just just, just rubbing their knees together, man. There's something wrong now. Bob, do you know where Green Leaf is? No, I don't know. Let's do Green Leaf. Hello. Green Leaf. Good morning. Green Leaf is near Lakeland, right where the bird apparently is. Oh my god. Are they rehearsed of it? Well, look. Yeah. Well, Neil, if it's bird wants to, if bird lives near Lakeland, he must want to live in a place for family trees. Don't branch. Oh, oh.

I was going to have a hotel room last night waiting for a Rick or Riley to show up. Cause he drove over with his a cheerleading wife. And seriously, and so he shows up a quarter after midnight with the cards and all the stuff I had to bring in here this morning, which it was a heavy box by the way, Riley. And so I'm listening to Randy and I got so animated and excited. I caught her on the air to tell her the good news about how well we're being treated. And then I got to listen to best of Neal tapes again. And I was enjoying it. Oh, yeah. Which is frightening, okay. But sitting over here in this area and being able to hear like a real radio station. Yeah. These people should be absolutely just, just licking us all over our body parts. Well, Neal, the next time you come up here, maybe we can get you into Central Forty, come over and trash the parks on the air. Great. Can I call somebody to do that? Sure. If it'll end the call, you bet. Okay. Okay. John, a group of a girl bank village branch here to do his best. Okay. See you. You're going to do it. Everyone has to end their call by one.

He yells. That's why it's mic. He yells. I think that's why he got blown out of L.S. Can't really hear. Bad mic technique and heart of hearing. Other than that. No, seriously, because he's got a really great voice. But he just can't hear himself. So he screams and chows and gets raspy and then gets all psychotic. What do you mean? I scream and shout.

He's at it 20 years to his life. He's not a business. Well, the reception here in Miami is kind of distant. What do you mean by that? Well, you know, it's just not quite as sharp as it is. You know, you know, you know, something this is all psychological. I have and I do want to say this. No, sir, I'm glad you mentioned it. Because we keep getting these calls. Probably OPEs people because half our calls from over here have been from FLA anyway. But we keep and go, you know, it just doesn't sound right on S.U.N.

It is a great honor. Speak to you, sir. Name right. I'm a big fan. Oh, I'm not six to a butt. My brother. Well, we're going to bench sir. And it's what I meant. Exactly what I meant. My brother went down to Miami for the relief effort. And he started listening to you. He came back to Tampa. And he said, you got listening to Mr. Rogers. He's a phenomenal. Mr. Rogers. Well, you had to let her respect for you. So do I. God. Neil, man. You're in the rain, too. I am. But what happened to the world? I'll be real brief with my call. I want to say, you know, go friends, go marlins, go bucks, and go lightning. Yeah. We're off. We're already in the district. I'm going to be it. Now, listen. Are you going to feel? Are you going to the game tonight? I'm going to hate me like poison because I'm going to. I will be under my breath going. Don't leave. Stop. Hey. What are you? I mean, 35 years of being a maple leaf band doesn't end quickly. That's the story. I mean, I hope the lightning wins all other games, like maybe another one. Sometimes soon because it hasn't been too much lately. But when you're playing the leaf, you know, definitely. Oh, yeah. It'll be great. I'll see you there. Okay. I'll be there. Thank you. Good luck. Sorry. John Jones, you are the biggest douchebag I know. See. I didn't know you were the best sign. I didn't know that. I just see my sandals. I have to do something up. When you please, I'm begging you. You get even like close to the mic. I know you have the gigantic debris and boy. I just want to clear. I know you're here around those heavy. Do you know why I'm not going to do that? I understand that you find top like an old team. They all kind of dogs. You have to be boring. It is. However, when your car is caught, I'll say things like go things that you consider to be good radio. Did you hear that caller? Bob. That caller was like a living and breathing human being. He was like under the age of 30 even I would say. Well under the age of 30. In our public had acne. Oh, he doesn't have any acne. Man, his skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom. That guy. Is it? Oh, you changed me. That's right. Man, that piece is too big for me, John. Anyway, it's 11.30. Let's do a mobile in Miami. Oh. More like an handle. Yes. Neil, man. Poor girls. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. Is this a pink report? Absolutely. I don't think I brought it. I think I brought my fortune. Okay. Not bad. Not bad. Okay. It's on a show of expressway. Just have to told you there's five and envelopeers still in it, man. Where is it? On the show of expressway. 74 just north of the toll boat. See? I found it. It's terrible. They suck. Have a great day. Oh, hello. Hello. What are you up to? Tell you where the cops are. We have a big report. That's a public service. And what I'm idiot? What I'm more on? You better get with it. This is part of this. This is an old the time. I mean, the times they are changing, Bob. Yeah. I don't get what I'm real. The times are changing. Please, soon. Level 31. And I'm glad you're here today, because you're starting to get the drift of what real radio is all about instead of that old. Hello, Bob. What kind of a dog? Well, you think I have a dog. I was really caught. I'm itching from head to toe. Can I borrow Sally's instrument for just a week or two? I'll bet you'd like to. I'm not this kid. By the way, the paramedics have been like, I've been bored to tears since she got married the other day. Like a week and a half. Oh, look at these. You end to over here. Look at where? Where's this guy from? When I'm worried you guys were on what TV station? I sure hope it's 13. He can't talk. He says. He says, that allowed the talk. He's not allowed to talk. He can't even say what number. Oh, can't attend. Channel 10. Please from Channel 10. Like I said, my favorite station in this market. ABC. ABC. Sure. Sure. Well, we've got a Zad. You're a 10. I watched the... I watched the... I've been in this year last night. And, um, of course, I haven't seen that many balls in many, uh, presidential elections. Have you? I mean, there were more balls going on. 11. 11 balls? Yeah. Even Bob came, man. Let's go to a pool. Ha! Clear water, hello. Clear water. Yeah. Welcome, Neil. Welcome, Hans. Bob. The man does last in there. Yes. We got a last in her car and he's out of the egg. I'm in. Bob. Oh, Bob. Got. How's my feet? Muffie's great. I think you're pardoned. Muffie's my white. Oh. The muffie. And how is your dog? I don't know feet. Uh, but I don't know. I don't know how to look at you. I don't know how to look at you. I don't know how to look at you. I don't know how to look at you. I don't know how to look at you. I don't know how to look at you. It's okay, though. Ah, yeah. It's far as I know. It's okay. Can you get the parents? You remember how so cute to come with you? Oh, sure. Sure. I know. No dogs and no smoking in the studio here. Bob. Not a pretty good relationship. We have missed you so much here. You don't know what we've been putting up with. You don't know how much I've missed you. Oh, wait. I'm so happy. I'm not our old people. I know. I know. I was Neil. Neil fantasizes. I hate to be able to find a way to keep your mediocre career alive. A few months ago. Every call. Every one. And you will not debate this because it was your life. Tell me. I'm really a year. But not to the first time, even. You've been missing the great vibrations we got when you came here. Your voice. Put our hands on the radio. Talk a lot. You know. You are like, you are like the answer to his prayer, sir. Like a collar under the age of 100. I knew. I was like, you know, I'm not your agent. We're going to bring good things. There you go. How much better can it get? None. Saturday. Saturday. I'm looking forward to seeing all of you. I just want to say just one thing. Yes sir. I'm closing. I'm going. Stop. Oh. Okay. Now there's staff meetings coming up at about like 26 minutes and eight seconds. Not that we're counting or anything like that. You don't think they're going to be agitated. Are they? No. Now that this is like rapidly becoming a real ideal situation. You know, just because it's been a year. I mean, sixes in the months to come. All of we can't talk about arbitraris or the books or the diaries. Why not? We can't even mention Anne Frank's diary. I'm serious. If I mentioned that, he'd be on that damn type right here immediately. Flip it out those letters to arbitraris. Man is out of his mind. Well, he does not concern about us. He wants to make sure you understand that. He thinks that as he wins a joke, Pipe the N radio tape radio shows don't work except the course of a large ass, which is on tape, by the way. Yeah. They lied about you. Yeah, they don't actually come out and say, but they do everything in their power to try to give the appearance that it's like a live show. Well, she's they could run two hours of a live show. But they don't. But they don't. But that pipe didn't stop. It doesn't work. Oh, that doesn't make a lot of brilliant decisions over there. Well, let me come back from the break. We're going to spend like the next hour and a half or ripping a j-core. And open and talking about what a geek he is and about how he changes it under where we five minutes. Because he's so damn nervous about how Randy Michaels keeps getting on the phone and two and his ass out. Holy, yeah. I wouldn't know. I'm in over here. 135 on the IOD network. First. No, okay. Just ignore him. We have different levels of control. Okay. Like, we're on his board. They're like controlling it. No, they're not controlling it in there. Are they? They have no control over anything in there. It's quite frankly, they look a little bit out of control. You guys have no control over anything in there, right? This is fun. Is this? I can say yes. Yes. As whole. So. They do it. So he's got one level of control and then George back there has got like the, No, I don't think so. I think they got the ultimate control in there, right? They can look and pull it all. No, you can cut it off, right? So George, Marty Pants back there, cut the crap. So anyway, the banana cake is great. And they're bringing some spaghetti from some bizarre place. What is it? You're going to write Miami from this room. We're going from this room. You can control what's in Miami. Oh, he's taking control on S.U.N. Who gives a crap about that? Go to Miami. So, somebody said, now the next caller can clarify this for somebody said that this Mike sounds real muddy. And George said, take the birds Mike. And he got a look on his personal hand. I mean, this is his opportunity back in this in the limelight for one day for like four hours of his future meaningless life. He's got one chance to come back at the start. And George wants to give him the muddy crappy Mike. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? I have this crisp clear Mike here. And George wants to take it away and give it to you. He says, you're a hot shot. I don't need a crisp clear mark. Hot shot. Yeah. Well, dot the eye. Yeah. So what do you think Bob? Are you into so far? Oh, I've had this much fun. You haven't been here one hour. I haven't been here in four years in some odd. Three and a half years. The times have changed here, man. He's been here already for you now. Before they were going to be. Me now. I mean, you were doing fairly well before with your future. Eight to nine shares and whatever it is. But now they're really way future. Eight to nine. You do better? You know what? Eight shares. I was looking at the end. That was eight. You're going to mail. Work in 10. You know how many people I represent. Oh. In this market. I was looking at some of those numbers like in the like at night time. And you can have like two big means listening and it represents like a six year. And this market. Well, I'm not an absolute right. We are not a big one. I would like Tom Belvedre to bring us a copy of the books. We'll be very nice. You said that they would do that to Tom Belvedre. Bring us a copy of the Tampa book. I think he's cooking right now. I think he's in the kitchen. I'm boiling some spaghetti at the moment. Yeah. He's on the pond. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. How was that? I woke up this morning. Yeah. It's about time man. Believe that or not. I thought it was like the dead by contact. This is not another last of the guys. Hello. What the hell is the monkey? What do you mean? How the monkey? And a box. Probably coming back. Yeah. We're going to have a lot of people over here. Morning. Yeah.

Have a great day at home. You're going to kick the old with your sand. Get him out of here. You've got a crappy phone. It's feeding back at a sounds like a crap. Let's do St. Petersburg. Hello. St. Tweet. He just did his. Why did not just do him. I said clear water. So there will be a little behind in here. Okay. They're playing little grab ass in the other room with each other. Oh, let's do it. Huh? You're trying to read his little bit. Well, don't say that on there. Don't start screwing around with us. George. These guys in here and I got their crap together. Okay. So don't try to pull it over on us. You guys have your crap together. Yeah. This is crap. Let's go to St. T. Hello. Clear water. Are you in clear water? Good morning. So with the other guy wasn't St. T. I don't know. I'm confused. You're going to trouble to them. Let me say it again. Clear water. Yes. Hello. Well, you sound like crap. Hell. It must be the system.

He had to say on the show to get dumped. What did he do? I would imagine. You want to try? I think I could you could you write it down on a piece of paper or something in pass. He turned just my call. If I could tell you how much excitement I could do in that. Yeah. Yeah. I could. I could. I could. In my. Oh, here's a right on a star line. Hello. When you said you didn't worry about this. Oh, man. This George. Talk about losing it. Yeah. Guys over there. Yes. Yeah. It's time to top on how you got to take the first point. We have birds. I can give her a bit of a good. Did you ruin her your show? Think time. Get out of my house. Get out. Get them off of your. Okay. But you do have a point. Let's go. Well, the guy you wanted to make a point. It's only for one day. She either. So damn impatient. He'll be gone tomorrow. I'll be back in there. That was a good one. That was a good one. That was a good one. With his Tampa Tribune on the bottom. Yeah, it look, I can't help. You know, I just can't. You can't pull himself. You want to be here. He wants to be a part of our passing parade. Okay. Here's Brandon. Hello. You go, Bob. Blacks are there. Yes. You know, Bob and I go back. A few years. The reason why I said it. Brandon. I'm really cool from the ground. Because you're going from what? Broward. I take it part. You're calling from where? Broward. I'd call him from Broward. I'd like to wear it now. Is there a city? Is there like a place? Sir? I like to wear a lot of my bags. No, but I used to call Bob Blastard from Brandon. When he was on WFL 8, might I say that? Yeah. Okay. Not again. Bob was on WFL 8. He was in my bag. He was my favorite. He said to me, he said, what is your mint? I'm a mint that brought him to the US. You have said to him, what's for broken? Yeah, you really didn't. How about Sunday's 10 or two? We wait. Hey, don't. Hey, Neil. Don't suck up. Okay. Like I said, your voice. But you went to the hotel. So suck up, Neil. No. I've been down here for two months. Okay. Wait. That's for Daniel. No, Bob. I had you guys. But you get Bob Blastard to get out of here. You got something. That guy is great. He's not going to be on down there. I'll make a part. He's going to be on up here. What do you mean up here? Where's up here? Brandon. Right up here. Just take a little. Right up here. What? He's not coming down here to the hammy? No. I'm not on your knees. I'm not on your knees. You think you're talking to George Michael? Hey, hey, Bob. Yeah. What are you going to be at? What's the station? Uh, um. It's WSUN. Tell WSUN. Tell WSUN. It'll be done. Right? Yeah, the sun. Okay. You're not coming down here. Because it's got to be. It will change your hair. That's out of town. Yeah, baby. And what's up, you, too? Hey, you'll change your hair. That's out of town. But he's a deal's great. And you're a great. I'll catch you later, baby. Don't care. Which we can say the same. What? What is this? Um, 47. On the island being networked. Fire the goddamn teeth. I take outside. Take my own damn ass. I have no cavity. I know. I'm going to fix my sorry. Oh, yeah. What? You told. You're a good son. Charlie Brown. Now, showing on a double bill with nightmare on Sesame Street. Probably six to WI or D and lunch is arrived. I'm not talking about the crap that Joel bought. I mean, the Ouija BG. He was right. The BG is made lunch for us. He BGB's. The chef is going to cook special. Remember there was more green said that. No, I happen to him. Yeah. Well, we all remember both. Yeah. Nice. I'll be the sky. Yeah. Nice glasses. With the iron a sky. I'm not sure how he used to love that record. I still love it. I still do love it. But somebody stole my CD. Oh, oh. I'm still on from the IOD library. Shocking. So Bob Lanceter has gotten up the momentarily and stepped out. Probably smaller chainsmoking in the kitchen. I'm sure that's what you say if he could be here right now. Let's do a mobile. Mobile in a Peter'sburg. Hello. Yeah. Hey, you know what? I was just trying to find out that the satellite city has done. Can't be full of art. Yeah. And they had these failures that did all. Big, big of cute all over the ground. Really? How to tell about time gets through there. I got a dog story for you. Yeah. What do you call a little dog with very short legs and steel ball? Next call story. What's that? What's that? That was not a phone throwing up. Oh, my God. Are you okay, Bob? You all right? Yeah. Listen, we can't all be as classy as the Bob Lanceter show. Okay. I would like to get part of those calls. Seriously. I think it's my fault. I know we'd be loaded. You'd be like, below and then board out over there. If we would love those people to call. I don't want to repress you. I don't want to pull you back. I don't want to give you. I want to jump start your show. We want you up to at least a ten share after the first trend in the morning. Okay. Well, I think what I'm planning on doing that. By the way, I look at the hour by hour in here and boy from ten to two. We should do two bad and book it also the six to seven and ran in it pretty well. And Rick and son. Oh, I'm sorry. We actually had a couple hours to do this there. I'm talking about my ratings here. And like in dinner last night, all he's talking about. Well, I was like a 72 share and they have to know. And you could look at the book and see the right today was in the toilet at FLA. And as soon as I came on, the numbers went skyrocketing to it. And as soon as way I went off, the radio is all went in. The opposite. The radio is all went in the opposite. Every word of it was the letter. You admit it. You're funny. You fat phony. Why don't you admit it that you're a pompous ass like all the rest of this. Wait, is that phony? You admit it yourself. But I walked in here that I've lost a lot of weight. And almost fat phony like that. Okay. It's part of the club. It's Neil and Bob. They used to be fat phony guys. We're not just going to put on more weight. I can't wait to put on more weight. By the way, so I don't know. This is from Luigi B.G. Pasta and each of the factory and it's good stuff. Well, you shot. I've already heard you hear me. Hi, do you hear me and Parmesan spaghetti with black olives, mushrooms, onions, broccoli, and green peppers, and no meat, Bob. No meat. I'm not going that far. Here's a lady in Western. Maybe even me to get it. Hi. Hi. Could you have a pop just got to come and get it, so they'll keep the fleets off. Oh, that's right. Come and get a dog food for your dog. You'll never have fleets. Your dog skin will be like silk. You need a dog food, too. Didn't say I endorse it. That's what I use. It is not a sponsor. It's just something that a product that I love. Come and get it. It's in the pocket bag. Get them on. No, I'm not trying to get them on or get them off for that man. So are Bob's ratings real or they kind of like Joey kind of make believe me? My ratings were very real. No. I know you don't like requests and you probably didn't bring your cards. I brought some. I brought a few, but not the one you want. Whatever it is. What is it? Do you have to go over the guy you'd be able to get him to get off? No, I hate to burden no. Oh, okay. Second request for that. Yeah, that's still number two with a bullet by the way. Oh, that's a regretted lie. So are you excited about Bob coming back to Tampa even though you're not here? Just say yes, make him feel good. Oh, sure. Yeah. Oh, God. Man. You can tell me over there with them. Ah, huh. Have a great day. Okay, bye. Bye. It's amazing that my presence here would suddenly make people think of that card. They want to hear it. They have to hear it and she can tell where I'm. Embarrassed. Come on. It's a surprise to you. I didn't know. I think there's a message there. Yeah. That's what I was getting. I'm not sure what it is, but I think I have an idea. Say hello to Gail Seren. Hello, channel 8. Hello. Yeah. You know, anchors on channel 8. Is that a good channel not because 10 people are before. And it really sucks. I like 13. Perfectly. Take that, channel 8. I like to hear all the guy from 80's. I just came out. That won't make the news. I don't think. You can't. They can't add it. You're talking about the age of the girls he likes. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, but 13's a little better. No, my favorite. Yeah. And it's great to say that right love a guy standing right here. Right. It's a little big up. You know, he has this number on the camera too. Oh, channel 8. We love it. Yes. Hey, Gail Seren. 10 year old girls in Lakeland by the way, the bridge. He's going to be right on the way home. Can you look, girl? So let's do now. We're going to have more calls than add on a board. Huh? I'll hurry up there right there. I think in George keeps playing with these guys over here. I was doing a tremendous job. By the way, these people at us you went art. What are you talking about? That was your thing. They're the best clothes. Oh, I wasn't. I said they are the best. And they're doing a good job too. Five, two, four, four, seven, five, one and a day. And the out of town line. That's where we want to get these tremendous. Come on. Let's have some of Bob's old friends, man. Underlined the old. 1,800, 9,449,463. 1,800, 9,449,449. Try the sabotage. I haven't even officially started yet. He's a year-old. Sorry you. I'm going to tap a note on the I-O-D network. All right. We're going to get them. Hi. I'm Jim Morrison. And that was me 25 years ago. I've fixed my death because I thought Mark and Roll was dying. And the future wasn't retail. And I was right. Just listening to these great specials. We're having a great time. And I was right. Just listening to these great specials. We're having down at my gift shop, the lizard king. That's right for lizard king. Where the mojo might be rising, but the prices are falling. Come on. They be we're lighting a fire under these specials. Like fine lizard boots, handbags, belts, and wallets. And this is not the end. My beautiful friend, break on through to the other side of savings. With great deal, the lizard longs are ready. Lizzard hand tools. Even lizard dishware. So come on. There's no time to wallow in the mire. Hurry on. Down to the lizard king. Where I am a lizard king. And I will sell anything. What happened there? Did you see that? That was bizarre. I didn't know if that was the real Bob or if that was the card. I couldn't tell. Is it real? Or got it, baby. Got it. I just had the Argal Socker. Anyway, 12 of 17 at W.O.D. I think we got it under control now. Don't we? It sounds crisp and clear. If you think it sounds muddy, then you're out of your mind. Because everybody in here tells me it sounds sensational. And don't pay any attention to that. Look at that. Here's our prop and a harness copy. Thank you Becky. We still love you Becky. Allow it's a hell of a lot better over here. Yeah. Oh, my first grab in Tampa. Okay. I feel so much better now. And that was not contrived. That was a real one. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, I think Joel's just backing up now. That sounds good. You just got during the night. Let's do a high level. Oh, hello. Hi, hello. Hi, Leah. Oh, my. Yes, sir. I feel better. I'm going to go to the family tonight. All right. Okay. I could want to listen about the emergency broke. About what? The emergency broke. The emergency broke. Yes. Yes. EBS. But I know you continue to sound should be changed. But for some more suitable for a man. Just like. Oh, my God. Yeah. Just going to test the emergency telemundo. Okay. So anyway, over here, they're showing it over and over again and just over and like from right side and left side. You know, it's the best day from the backside. It's the best day. I've seen in a while. Yeah. What can you say? About your partner. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? I can't say that. I can't say large hands. Yeah. I can't say large hands. You're good. Listen to that. And so it's on over there from nine to noon. Mark Clarkson. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That large ass wanted me. I mean, that guy. Just pathetic. See, I've heard all those people over there. And don't give me the sign as by the line. Oh, it was a really good guy. And he's got a great said line. Oh, blows. He's got the most irritating gravel voice. Sounds like something. He did a rotor rotor in his throat or something. And maybe they did. Here is a Tampa. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Welcome to Tampa. Thank you so much. We are so damn excited to be here. It's great far beyond our wildest expectations. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, um, you're choked up as what you're really. You're choked up. Yeah. You're choked up. Yeah. You know, it's a job from public. Are you kidding me? I'm not kidding. It's public. John, you remember sure. John, he used to come down in South Lake.

You sound very depressed. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah. He always liked the last time you called me. It was great here. And from you, you sounded like manic. Four people blew their brains out after your call. Four. Yeah. And I was like, what am I going to be in our side of it? I don't think so. He's certainly welcome to come by. I don't know. What else are you going to do? Well, what is he up to? He's going to sign the bird on the stick. Yeah. I don't think they want to see me. You know what the other ear? See in Miami. I mean something to people. But I hear they don't know me. They don't know me. He's going to go to the Mollon Lakeland and hang out. Yeah. What's he doing? I'm retired. Yeah.

Well, do you remember the guy that did morning drive? What has that got to do with Bob? You mean Larry Lugek? No. I'm talking about Clark Weber. Clark Weber. Yeah. I thought he was dead. And then I heard him do with PSA's on Lard F. For the American thermocologic. But he is dead. What is he doing? They just forgot to tell him. I mean, why was he like Carl the Susan Walker? He was on the air for 20 years after he died. What does that have to do with Bob? Well, it gets with WLS and he used to be there. But he was on WLS when it was like doing talk. You're talking about back in the days when it was a good station. Yeah. Which was long before Bob got in there. Am I right? Yeah. Yeah. WLS. Man, it's another cap city. It's a crap. It's another way like WLS in New York. It's that boring, online, topical crap that nobody under the age of 100 wants to hear anymore. Yeah. Last thing you said talk about race relations every day of the week. I get some of this. It look wonderful. Every day. Yeah. Well, the regulations well. Like in the dog track. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Bye, bye. How come we're not hearing those old, I want ladies, man. I want some ladies on the Florida lines. I want them to greet Bob. I know you're out there. You are the one that had all the old ladies. I didn't. There were never people that said, hello Bob. It was always hello on the, oh, wow. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 1-800-944. Back of the days when you were good. I want a lady. Whoa. I want her now. I want her to be a Bob last in her gropey. And we want her under immediately. If not sooner. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Gone? Hello. Hello. Yes. I was right about Ed McMan being retired, huh? About what? About Ed McMan being retired. What about it? Well, someone had said that Ed McMan was retired. And you were, oh, is this Steve from Hollywood? Oh, my, guys. You can, you can even tell me an analogy. Even over a year, I can tell you're annoying voice Steve. Yeah. Well, the only person I know who in the midst of all this crap that's going on here would call about Ed McMan. Well, I thought I had a little fun with you, but apparently I did. Yeah, he did. I thought he was trying to rip me. I don't know what he was doing. I wouldn't do that Mr. Bird. Okay. That's going to be sure. Oh, hey. That way. See, I'm so slow. I didn't even catch on to that. I didn't. Why wasn't you drifted? Well, he did not answer it. He just said what the drift was. Well, that's what it was, but in my weird sense of humor, I guess it wasn't an effective as usual. Oh. Good luck in the apricot. Oh, that's not real. Is it? That was a tape wasn't it? Well, does it matter? Not really. Oh. Yeah. That's why we made sure we had a real muddy connection that they see. You can't tell if it's real or a mammarex. All right. Good luck over the tap of the deal. We're doing it Steve. Bye. Have a great day. That's Steve from Hollywood. Oh, Bob. How come you know all of your college by the time? Because they're all coming over and play a canaster. But he didn't do it like me. We have bridge games. We have our bridge and we have bridges and glasses. Oh, man. Let me give those numbers out. Because I have no idea what's going on in date. Three, three, five, one, and Taughto. Let's go. And we're gonna go. Go at 1-5, one, and Vowret about 2-4. The World Famous, 800 Florida Line, where we're desperate. We'll get her on immediately. If we have to crash into the middle of a break, if we have, one of your old fans. I don't know. So that ain't good for Ben. Just fire. It's an asshole celebration and they're all out on the street. See them on the sidewalk over here, I'm shuffling feet. That's $25.00 an asshole from the native. That's the night good people at the asshole number three. We've got the asshole freedom. That's all for me. That's all for Jesus. That's all for God. That's all for Jesus. That's all for Christ. That's all for the asshole. That's all for God. Unbelievable. We've got assholes making money for making all the rules. Taking all our jobs and filling us by the truth. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. What do you want to tell me? I really made a grave. My own life, my own life just another half-hole on the road. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. That's all for God. Okay, don't take it personally. I can tell already this bag sounds so much better. Doesn't it, George? You're so into it. It's just a mail. Just intimidated by the one I didn't intimidate. Just to try not to stir up any food in the bread. He knows how these engineer holes are. Man, they're all cut out the same. Huh? Dave Solinsky, made your asshole. Okay, that is named Dave Solinsky. Even Tom Bell, he just said, okay. He's a good guy. He's all right. We need him one more day. Cut that. Bob, we got a lady. If you don't want to talk to the last of the lady, I'm sure. Hello. Hello, Mr. Rotterrace? Yes. I put up with four hours of your film and simpleness on our public airway. Every day and overlapped it, I could prevail. But with Mr. Last in our returning, Mr. Oh, he's amazing. He's amazing. Baby's out of the values of mothers and mothers. I think that you see. Where the fire just starts again, Mr. Strait, but do you know that? Mr. Rotterrace and I will prevail. Faith is the way how you're doing, honey. For five minutes, I will be back to the show. Oh, you're going to do the jugs on this page. Whoa. Oh. I... You're going to burn in the hell. I thought you were going to... Oh, Bob, tell us about that. Yeah, but can I touch those jugs before I have to burn? Oh, oh. Now I like her. Hi, honey. Oh, you need her call. You need her call. Yeah. She sounded like she was right on the edge of... I think maybe she's the one at Font Sally's apparatus. Anyway, it's the love. Is that... Now that's 20 years. Ellen Box was a normal man. With a nice home, a lovely family, and a cushy job with his father-in-law's company. Normal about his until just three weeks ago. Hi, honey. How was your day? Come out of an esoteric Monday, I fear going up being button on the west when we see if I can't focus it in to the best of my ability. Ellen Box is suffering from Bob Lassard's disease. Oh, are you feeling alright, Ellen? Absolutely insane. I see things that nobody else seems to see. Or at least, Keras would admit that they say. Bob Lassard's disease attacks the central nervous system, causing otherwise normal people to communicate like suicidal maniacs. Wow, if you today, I don't want to talk to you. What's more, Bob Lassard's disease is the one form of depression, which is actually contagious. God, just listing that voice, I want to jump off a building. You're the lowest of a lawyer at Nate. You're a gum bag. Please send whatever you can today to post office box 1-800-Devindport, Iowa. Honey, it's Friday night. You know what that means. Bitching and moaning and screaming and hotoring. Please help. Yeah.
