Here it come. Make beans make bubbles in the bathtub. Ready? Here give me the microphone. Reveal the sperm. Lots of baked beans during national baked bean bud. Oh, it's gonna be big. This mess. It's brought to you by the national baked bean counselor. Wow, fossil arm. I, Luis Miguel. It's 1129. See this? And we have an open line in Broward 524WDD over. He actually has last night's first ever. Panthers game is just so underwhelming that I'm astonished. We had two calls, one from a guy who had no idea what the score was, then from some of those picker in Tampa, who thinks that their in Pupa is God and Felix Potpain had the best you ever had in the NHL last year, which he doesn't have any idea what he's talking about. And that said, hockey in Florida, maybe it's a mistake after all. Here's the color red, yellow. Yes, sir. Let me make a short. It's a quote to the quote for a second here. Okay? Yes, sir. The heat. The heat sucks. Yeah. Okay. If you can't understand what to do, then you can watch him. Yeah. The Dolphins are my great football fan, but I wish him all the luck. Don't need it. Okay, my lines. Marlin' time. I'm going to about 25% of the games. Right. Okay, I'm not a season. I'll take it all the way. They will. And I'll follow it. I'm not a season boy. You're not? The station is. I get dice, squeeze out their tickets. Oh, yeah. Look at you. Now, it isn't hockey. I've been in the USA for 15 years. Right. I've been able to watch more than five minutes as a full last night. Yeah. Are you watching my last night? Go pass the ball away. Right. I got excited last night. Well, thank you, God. It was a pretty good game. Big time. And they were behind three nothing. And it looked like, you know, they just roll over and kind of play dead just get old practice and they got right back in there and they kicked them as. And they did it. And I'll tell you where. After work, the one game is not saying anymore. It's weak. Right. Now you're talking. Outstanding. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Outstanding, man. There's a word that goes between out and standing, but I can't say it. Out, in standing. Anyway, we have an open line in date. Seven, five, once we got one new hockey fan there, which is good because we'll find him a good seat. I can't find anybody, but we'll find him a good one. Right there in the front row, right in front of the Weasement Gel. Okay. Let's do Tampa. Hello. Yeah, you're doing. Okay. That's a great job. You're doing the fantastic guy. Anyone can talk about the hockey game. Did you tell him to tell you to say that by the way? No. Okay. Let me correct you on something. What did I say now? Okay. First off, the capacity of the Lakeland Civic Center. Five thousand. Right. But last night, they anticipated about four thousand people there. Why is that? We had 38, 76. Because that's what they had last year. They just really said there's not much enthusiasm on going to the games in Lakeland. Why not? Is that just the way it is? It's a bad place. It's bad access. It's a small area. I mean, it's just not a good place to see hockey. No, no, no, no. I'm just saying you were, you were just, you were just, you were just, you were right. I hope you're right. I just thought that because I'm here in so much about this hyped up rival. We ought to thought they'd have been standing online all the way to Barton. I don't know. You just wait till the thunder dome. Do we get over there? Okay. Good crowd. All right. You're supposed to break the all-time record. It's a thunder dome. I think we're 25,000. They were going, I'm going again tonight. Where they playing tonight. Where they going tonight, playing the blues. Oh, they're in Lakeland again tonight. Yeah. And Lakeland again tonight. Yeah. And Curtis Joseph won't be there. Aren't you lucky? Exactly. Why? What the hell was he taking in some of those games against us last year? And against the blackhawks, my God. This guy was on heavy duty juice. They must have run out in the last couple of games against the Leafs. But boy, he was doing it. I don't know about right now. Yeah, he is doing. The first game, in fact, that clip I played a Gilmore scoring in the second overtime. He had 62 saves in that game. Yeah. And again, that I went to on at Tuesday night to game. I went to we had like 20, some saves in the first period. 26 saves, I think. Well, I'm not sucking up to you, but I love to leave. That's my team. I'm going to stand behind the light. How do you like that guy that called before about Felix Pothman about how was this? Probably had the best year he ever had. I didn't hear. Oh, really? Yeah. He's trying to tell me about how Darren Pupis, so great in Pothman isn't so good. It was probably the best year he ever had. Of course, it was his first year in the league. But don't confuse this guy with the fact. I hate to disagree with that man. He's wrong. Yeah. He's wrong. Okay. That's the best. The Zito and Bobby Clark kissed him made up last night. Yeah, you know, I don't want to get like Joey Reynolds now. He keeps thinking up behind guys and kissing him. Guess who I met last night. This is no shot either. Yeah. I met D-man, I think. Did you? Yeah. He was wandering around. He was dressed really fine. Did he like the Zito kiss him on the ball? No. No. I think kisses ring. I didn't do anything. I guarantee S Zito ain't got to be coming up between behind Wayne Hizinger and kissing him on the cheek. I guarantee you that. Well, of course. Yeah. Will they calm the waste magnet or whatever. Bad joke. The waste magnet? Yeah. It's in waste. You better watch out. I'll waste you if you don't watch it. He's got all the right connection. What I'm worried about him up here. No, not the right. Gretzky's playing tonight, too. Is he? Yeah. So tonight will be an exciting game. I thought you said you're playing the blues tonight. Yeah. And Gretzky's playing? Brent. Oh, Brent Gretzky. Okay. Yeah. Anyway, I waited for Brent Gretzky. We're playing. I come over there and I stick him right in the nose. Wait a minute. Go back up here. What? When you're going to come back up the Tampa? October 9. I don't have a hood. October 9. Oh, for the at least. Exactly. No, not the least. Gendopanthers in the lightning. Oh, yeah. Okay. I've got. I'm all excited. Sorry. And I went to the Leafs do play up there, which is, I forget when it is. The 13th. Right. Okay. Good to you. Trust me. All right. They call me Mr. Puckman. Don't forget it. You are a Puckman. I know.

He would just pull the tug of his hair in the front and then he's do like an old smooth. Yeah. Oh, he was gross. He was trying to be like Michael Jackson.

He's a male model. Oh, there you go. He was in the men from Cuba calendar, which all the other guys were ugly and he was out of this world. I don't know. I'm going to tell you something Orlando, you locked out because you stood out of it. You must have had something to do with that. You must have had some pull. Look at that. What's the house? What's the house? He stood out. Oh, it's good. No, really because if you go down on South Beach, you will see so many beautiful Cuban guys. I mean, really hot looking guys. Am I right? Yeah, you do. I'm asking him. Oh, but no. No, don't. Don't. Stop it. Yeah. Yeah. Why is he so quiet? Because he's turning a deeper shade of pale man because he is the mama's list in right now. I get very embarrassed easily. Your mama's a good. Your mama. Your mama. My mama. Yeah. Why mama. But anyway, so they could probably find a lot of really hot looking guys, uh, down there on South Beach. But they had all these ugly guys in in Orlando who's like a 45 on a scale of three. Wow. Yeah.

Well, I'm, I wanted to tell all those gentlemen that are talking about the West Coast. I'm on the West Coast, and I'm a big hockey fan. Yeah. And I watched the game last night. They called you the puck master, right Margaret? Yes. Yeah. Don't do that to me. Okay. And it was a fantastic game. You saw it? Yes I did. Great. I love hockey. It was really a thrill because they both were very good. They were real good. Very good. And some of those guys are better than others though. Some of them were real good. Some of them not so good. Yeah, but the score should have been bigger than what it was. Should have been a lot bigger. That's what I've always said. Should have been a lot bigger. We have to make do with what you got Margaret. I guess. Yeah. Okay. Right. Now to the depressing thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got to watch. I was fortunate. There are unfortunate as a case may be. By the way, Margaret, you ever read the advocate? Well, I'm sorry.
