You want to accept my call. Right. Well, hold the girl back and then you'll know there's something when you call. Try to trick George. Yeah. I mean, what? He always liked my call. You never said one thing bad about my calls. I always said one day he hates me. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that you were chronic. They called 600 times a day all over the radio. We don't call. Yeah, but she always calls one time, per station. That's grower. That's not true. You know, I'm going to call last for about every three weeks. Stupid Neil. Yeah. Well, it's only been about a week and a half. This time, Rosie. Yeah. But he rose. Neil, the bitch. Yeah. Yeah, you are. Uh-huh. Now, Rose, remember what happened the last time you got into a screaming shot match with somebody on the radio? See, Ward in a second here. Cronic. Do you remember Rose, what happened the last time? No. Yeah, you paid for it. It was me and Bill. And what happened to Bill? That's nice. Well, this is a good idea. Don't you get a lesson. Don't you go calling Neil any names or nothing now, Rose? No. Do he, Bob, would I hire Neil, die? I don't know. Neil would die. Well, he, I'm dying from the call already, Rose. All right. I already died a couple of days ago. He wasn't getting any calls. Yeah. So, where she could be on the 10 in the morning? We're working on it, Rose. I think he should. We thought that we fought that the refrigerator magnets would do it today, but he is survived and is in great shape. That's not just too early, but if he make it a six-bob, you can make it anywhere and anyhow. That's right, Rose. 9.40 for the time. And a lot of them are on AM620. And I look up. And there's a furry little friend out there eating out of the four more to go. And it's just about time to take us. We better run, Cronic and some calls here. Let's go to Sarasota, hi there Sarasota, you're on the air. Hey, Bob, morning. Good morning. How you nail? Once in a hell, you are, Neil. I'm like, great. Great. Oh, good. He didn't have a set of phones on yet, sir. Anyway, I felt like a real jerk didn't morning, you know. I would listen to all that, but that's very good. I got the phone and I called him. Oh, hold it. Yeah. Now look down on my roll of decks. I was on on the IOD number. The IOD number. Yeah, we got them both on the same. I've got them both on the same one. I've checked it in the answer. Nobody answered. I'll be damned. I had a call down there this morning, and nobody answered. But don't you hear that? Anyway, how's the IOD number? Oh, oh, oh, what gave you so much? I followed you up north, and I was up in New York here. You were the one following me. And I got to hear the big Howard sperm for the first time. Oh, yeah. What do you think? Well, I had a ran a car and drifted across the aisle. It was on the automatic key, and then I had to sort of search it out. I was a North and the only came. That's the way it once. I met just a week. Yeah, a lot of time. Hey, Ronald. He was on a station called K-Royant. Yeah, right. And I thought if you guys ever thought you had a whole bunch of people on the studio at one time, he brings it a whole month. He was going to have it on some people to do the show. He does. He has a lot of people off the air doing it. He was down on the floor, getting a massage from a scow who sent in new pictures from Cleveland and he flew over in and caught it all about the different ways they do things. And Cleveland, he got all excited. They do it differently, Cleveland. Thanks so. You're going to be about to steal. Anyways, my call from the yard that bit. His mother called. Oh, she ripped some another one. I mean, she says, powered boring, boring show this morning. I mean, no, that's not a. Well, care is mother calls her on the dark hall. Maybe that's where she got the stunt from her. Maybe it's where Howard got it from. Maybe Howard's been listening to the dark hall. Randy's mother calls her on the air too. That's when the normal really will it when her mom started calling. Yeah, but I'll tell you. It was even a different show. It's a really different sound difference. And the crammed with commercials and there's been bites of them hollering back of worth in yellow and a lot of promuling stuff and comedy action. Yeah, well, we don't do that kind of radio here, man. But anyhow, these guys are bad influence on you, Bob. Coming up from Miami. You think so? All they do is eat and eat and eat and eat. We mean, I'm the one that's been getting the food for them. They didn't get any food on their own. Oh, but boy, they all eat. Such as a pig, you know, he's always. I mean, well, Neil said me for years down there, well, months down there in Miami and I just trying to re-earn the favor. Well, anyway, I was, I was on strategy with Jim Schuyler. Well, that was a different Jim Schuyler. That was her quantity. He must, he must owe you money or something because he was really giving you all sorts of accolades. Great. Popping to that guy from Milwaukee to BMW FLA and he's on their all kinds. Oh, yeah, Jay Marvin. All the people with no lines are on quantity, right? Well, hey, you're all doing whatever happened to that sort of thing. Name and all these names of them. Yeah, dynamite. Yeah, like their own names. Well, what happened to Rob Huyler and Bob Huyler and he died, however. Yes, did. Well, thanks for the call, man. Okay. Take care. All right, Dad. It was Bob Huyler and Bob Huyler. I don't even know him. He am all X-ray and Lewis. Oh, the general manager. I used to call it three o'clock in the morning because he was just going to bed at that hour, just getting up. Oh, yeah, just coming into the station. Right. Oh, Bob. Yeah. Well, if it's five seven six WSUN, that should do the trick. Last year on AM 620, WSUN, it's not. Yeah. But I can't get what good weather. I'll put that to the list of you here pretty girl shank, don't ever do it. Okay. Care of bitch. Oh, well, when some lose some. Let's go to the next car. It's got to go. We've got to go. Like that last one. Week. Week. It's the best you could do. Week. Who was that? Are you serious? You didn't recognize that voice? Not the way for it to reach you up again. Oh, that does have a fast. Oh, yeah. You're right. Round and round and round. She goes. Where she's done. Nobody knows. One of those two second dropings on up to a minute. Mark that's always on my favorite. It's cute up up. Yeah, I know I was looking for something else. Well, let's just hear that. Short. Good. You don't recognize that voice? Kurt? Yes. But here you see, when Kurt's really into what he's doing, this is the kind of enthusiasm he can have. Bob, god. Isn't that great versus? They'll be the... God. Good. Good. Good. Oh, sure. Let's not go anywhere. Let's say. What is my show that you were ripping Randy and Ash and nobody heard it earlier this morning? Oh, she did. Very proper way. Back to the fact that she's not. Why is she always bitching about what everybody else is like? Well, I do. Well, since you brought it up, I kind of, you know, explained to her this morning that, you know, 23 years and years and years and years of success is what gets you. The box a couple of trends is not exactly what the show is. I know. Things that because she was on she and she was in New York. That's not what she was doing. She was doing something. Nothing that's there. Well, it's a ball game hunting. You got to pay her dues, bitch. That's right. And, you know, pay them to me and to kneel. Right, so not much of a check. We understand that but we'll take it. Well, they can't all. For a night with heaven or head there or whatever your hello name is. And then they forget about the cash. Oh, okay. Not going to take the call. In fact this morning, Randy was still wandering around on the park and I'm waiting to see if any of those hookers were still driving around. Really? Yeah.
