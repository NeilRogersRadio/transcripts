I'm glad the holiday season is dead.
Yes.
Had enough work but it wasn't no club man.
And now there's an egg in inside my head.
But still got light up on your home.
But after midnight, I'm telling you everyone.
Should have taken them down.
Take them down, you lazy bum.
You need a job to feel the aims to top, top, top, top.
One down the line.
Take down the line.
Should have backed them up.
Can you wear me one, one, one?
Three.
Who cares?
596.
A very strong second.
That's what I voted.
Who cares?
Who gives a flying choice?
Liar 348.
Is that streaming gonna stay down?
No, it's back up again.
But we've had a dozen dropouts in five minutes.
Coward 198.
Who's next saving 186?
Loser 161.
Loser.
Absolutely correct sir.
Great coach, 51.
That's the joke vote I guess for Friday's poll.
Trigger 46 and I hate this poll.
Only 24.
Solventay Uno.
Only 1%.
They liked it.
Well it's something to them to get all whipped up about.
It's gotta always be something negative in South Florida.
We hate you know.
Camplin revises Roller Q.A.
Oh anyway before we get to that, here's today's poll.
Speak in a hate.
Yeah.
Well.
He's a freaking genius 248.
If I'm such a genius, then how come I'm working for these people?
That's my question.
People that can't even get a facts sent from your house to their ass.
Those bedtime stories 32.
See that's contrary to your thinking.
To hear him suffer 27.
18 dropouts and it's dead again.
It's down.
The streaming is down.
Let's back up.
18.
So very jackass rights.
Ed Camplin, whose late night talk show was dropped recently by WQM5.
60 cents Saturday.
He'll remain at the station with a new rule.
Camplin will be the host on the show from 7 to 10 p.m.
Week nights when WQM doesn't have a game.
Which is not tonight.
The stands for nothing.
Absolutely.
They're married men who now walk with a spring in their step.
Did you lose weight though?
Their wives are happier now that their husbands have talked to their doctor.
Tonight on Dateline NBC, join me, Chris Hansen, as we take a look into prescription
male enhancement products.
This is just like any other middle class neighborhood.
And this is Bob.
Bob talked to his doctor and got a prescription for enzyme, the male enhancement.
What are you doing here Bob?
God, who are prescription male enhancement?
How did you get my bedroom?
It's not looking at my wife.
What's going on?
Tonight on Dateline NBC.
Who is that honey?
It's a Chris guy from Dateline.
Want a lollipop little boy?
10, 16 to 5, 60.
So anyway, here's a reply.
I've got a tree now to my blog already.
Not exciting.
But the only reason I'm going to read this one is because it's interesting.
And it's from Allied Radio.
Who the hell is Allied Radio?
Do we know what does that mean?
I don't know.
It's somebody.
Some guy.
Anyway, it says, you know, I don't find that stuff boring at all.
In other words, am I talking about the Myspace crap?
It says, I guess it's because I know what you're talking about.
So, we'll be correct.
Sure.
698 in the pool.
We're going to have, well, we might make our thoughts.
I don't know.
So, Josh is training Chris today.
Is that the deal?
Yeah, he's sitting next to me right now.
Sitting on your lap?
Yes.
You should see it.
They're facing each other.
They're facing each other.
They're giving good face.
Well, whatever.
Here's the fact that came in this morning from Lew and Tammy.
We listen to you for multiple reasons, for a laugh, for multiple orgasms,
for a laugh, for the stories, for the way you reacted to the calls,
and for your genius.
All I'm a genius is looking at people I'm working for.
We've got 37 dropouts on the screen.
We've been on for 18 minutes.
Keeping our pace of two a minute and then a little bit extra,
just like I said, for a clear suck on the ear.
But those tapes are, first of all, there's not going to be any tapes.
Okay?
Because there isn't going to be any extension.
I'm not, yeah, I've got two years to go less a week.
Not that I'm counting.
In fact, on the blog, I'm going to figure out exactly how many days I have left
in my two years, and counting them down on the blog on Myspace.
Well, you can put a countdown time around your Myspace.
Can I?
Sure.
How do you do that?
Well, you can help me with that, since you're the technical wizard.
Right.
Anyway, getting back to this, I don't want to get all whipped up about this,
because what's the point?
Nothing is ever going to change with this after if there isn't food that a long time ago.
If you want to see any commentator or any talking head on TV who really tells the truth
and tells it like it is, and it's got a big, gigantic pair,
then he's the guy in MSNBC, 8 to 9 PM on countdown nightly, Keith Oberman,
MSNBC.
I know almost to be under the age of 100 don't watch MSNBC,
and certainly, hopefully, don't watch CNN, and that propaganda like Wolf Blitzkrieg,
that crap.
700 main reason I listen to Neil is, for laughs, total 9 to think,
because in honor of the fact that everything is technically so screwed up,
since they listen for laughs, I'm thinking, I can put that like on an end of the loop,
and just look so cool, if that's what you're talking about.
There you go, right?
Huh?
What do you think?
And then maybe every now and then just a variety,
throwing something a little bit different.
Yeah, what's that?
Let's laugh about that a little bit.
I know, it really gets my panties in a while.
Cut it out.
Calm down.
728 votes on the poll.
The main reason I listen to Neil is, for laughs, 299.
Anybody want to camel?
He's a freaking genius, 275.
I walk a mile for a camel.
You know, it's too bad all you punks for a 200 remember when we had a cigarette advertising,
the Faggot advertising on TV.
I remember.
Lucky Streck means, fine tobacco, LSD,
and FT call for Philip Morris that was Johnny,
he was the little guy, little midget guy.
Let's see, here's the fact that it's just trying to listen on Jonathan's plantation.
I've been telling you that you can't listen online.
It says, it's next to impossible today, that's right,
because we've got 51 dropouts in 24 minutes to be.
Biker and Blykker and fourth in New York City is where the source of the,
boy, it must be some heavy duty farting, huh?
It must have been an Mexican fiesta over the weekend, think?
Maybe Taco Bell, right?
Maybe Taco Bell was given a two-for-one burrito or something.
I still haven't get it over to Taco Bell lately.
I apologize to myself for tonight.
I love Taco Bell, and even the smell.
738, and I never finished reading this.
For last 304, he's a freaking genius to 80 ride.
Those bedtime stories, 36, 53 dropouts in 26 minutes to hear him suffer 31 like today,
because QM is a technical disaster A industry joke.
The crazy caller is 28. I'm bored 23.
I hate this pull 23. I break from all sports 12, and I hate Neil back.
Just like our management does, 11.
Sounds small business.
Congratulations, get alive.
I feel good.
Pete and I are here in heaven.
Bye!
It's President Jareb R4.
Hello, James Brown, hardest working man in show business.
You know that song, Hot Pants, has always been one of my favorites.
Take it, Jareb.
I've always considered you a great man.
And as you know, it's a man's world.
In for those!
Saddam Hussein.
How did he get here?
I don't know.
I'll call St. Peter.
He's one of my favorite five.
Hello, St. Pete.
It's Gerald Ford.
I don't know how to finally know him.
You know Saddam Hussein is here with us, right?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Typo?
I see.
Okay, thank you.
What did he say?
Good job.
Wait for it.
Get it from the other hand.
Okay.
I'm in.
1031, we're almost keeping up with that.
We have 59 dropouts, but the streaming is back up.
It'll stay there for a couple of seconds.
It'll drop out again and back up.
And nobody can listen online.
Very good, Joe.
You're really doing it.
You want to crack engineering staff viewers.
The Beesley production, baby.
I'm not holding anything back anymore.
These people are a joke.
They're an industry joke.
They're an insult to my intelligence.
I have to work in the business for about 100 years.
I've never seen so many people with such little professionalism.
It's schlock.
You know, fish off in the morning and fake your way through the day
and schlock your way through life.
It's a schlockhouse.
59 dropouts, 750 votes on a pool.
All the numbers all the time.
WDQYM, hello.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry I just shut off the radio.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I had so much excitement and pleasure
after viewing the Patriots' win yesterday.
It was on that final play, the return to reception for a touch now.
I'm Brady.
Had that defensive back in his arms and I said,
oh my, what do you like to have been there?
Yes.
Okay, good thinking, pal.
You're right on target all the way around.
Would I like to be in Tom Brady's arms?
You bet.
I wouldn't mind being in Ryan Phillips arms in that movie.
I saw last night.
I never mentioned that on the year.
I saw what you did last summer.
I know it's all.
I saw who you did.
I know who you did last summer.
I know who you did last summer.
In a Ryan Phillips case, believe me, it would be a long list.
Boy, he sure looked good in that movie.
Man, he wasn't talking like this.
He talked like a real hot punk.
You know, I might have liked that movie if you weren't talking like this.
He wasn't talking like that at all.
And who else was in that?
What's his name?
Freddie Prinz, Jr.?
He looked pretty good, too, but you know something I always liked him.
I thought he was kind of a...
I don't dislike him as much as I wanted to.
I'm talking about how he looks and I'm talking about his acting.
No, he's adequate.
He's okay.
I have a relation about the fact that we aren't streaming our show right now
and haven't been for many minutes.
No.
Well, why not?
Well, just weren't told him.
We're back up again.
62 drafts, but we're back up.
Who did you tell, Josh?
No, he's out of the room.
Oh.
He's out there screaming and yelling and banging on the door and engineering.
You morons!
What are you doing to the neorodgers, you're again, you idiots, you lunatics!
But, you know, you had it right when you suspected it.
It probably wasn't on, you know, anyone's end.
It wasn't what?
It wasn't what?
Probably not on anyone's particular end, if you know what I mean.
Like something wrong with the line again.
I'm assuming you're talking about?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
No.
I wouldn't put anything past that bunch of...
I mean, the fact that we go through an entire day last week
in a major market radio station and we can't send the facts,
we can't send a freaking facts.
Jesus Christ, they're going to have to get us a new building.
They're close to kinkos or staples or something like that.
What kind of goofball, huh?
That's a good idea, maybe if they've moved it downstairs or something.
A kinkos.
If they move lockdown stairs.
Like a...
What is downstairs?
Now I know the credit unions go on.
What's downstairs now?
Oh, it was empty for a long time.
Just now they remodeled it and they got like some world financial or something.
I bet you they got a facts machine.
Probably.
It works too.
The dentist office downstairs too, probably.
And I bet you the dentist has an orifice too.
WQIM, hello.
Neil!
Yes, sir.
I love your show, man.
I'm all for science and research and stuff but the cloning thing,
I can't figure why.
Why do they want to clone animals?
I mean, don't we have a shortage of chickens and cows or something?
No.
I don't know what's going on.
Anyway, I really love your show.
Could you play that thing that used to be the girl from Empazema, Empazema?
The girl with Empazema, you got it, Pali.
Thank you, Neil.
Okay, if you got him a smoking baby, and the S-faggot's too.
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
Let's see, that's the other word, a girl with Empazema.
Coming up by any moment.
I might play it till two o'clock because I'm so nauseated and disgusted with all the stuff that's going on there.
Hey, smokey, Joe, let me tell you something, man.
You have really changed my altitude a lot.
And a start with that really crappy lunch too.
That's steak.
I wouldn't feed that steak to my dog if they were still alive.
They were the evening, though.
That's the problem with them.
Oh, yeah.
My mother killed Tiny.
You know that.
Every time we come back from vacation, that dog would have pancreateitis, and he'd have that look on his face.
By the way, Jason and Pendle stopped trying to facts that article about Jared Lido.
It's not coming through, and it's just a tiny up the machine.
She's got an article about Jared Lido.
I want to see it right now.
No, that's okay.
I don't naked right on.
I want to see Ryan for Leap now.
See, that movie was 1997.
So, that's...
Am I right about that?
I'll tell you a little bit more.
So, Ryan for Leap was like 22 and that movie was made.
I'm going to tell you, he never looked better in the history of his life.
At least I've never seen.
He looked pristine and clean, and he was speaking like, yeah, he's supposed to be like a punk.
Not talking like destiny, thing funny like that.
He looked good.
How come I never saw that before?
I was teen screened.
That's probably why.
It was okay.
I mean, it was way overdone.
And, you know, it's just the Zygdon's egg.
But it kept you, you know.
And then, of course, he dies toward the end.
But then, again, so there's almost anybody else I'm not ruined in the movie for.
Who doesn't die is a pretty famous junior who, yeah.
And the one chick, what the hell is that?
Who was in it?
Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Jennifer Love Vera, Michelle Geller.
Yeah, right.
And the two of them were young and pristine with big, shapely, simple boobs.
So there's something for everybody in that movie.
I saw who you did.
I know who you did last summer.
Can you imagine, God, I might talk about Ryan Philly.
He could do anybody he wanted to, basically.
He's one of those people, you know.
There are a few people like that.
Not too many who could do just about anybody they wanted.
You know, like Brady Quinn, Tom Brady, the Brady Bunch, Alice, WQA, and Hello.
QA, and Hello.
Hey, I saw that on your computer.
Are you faxes?
I had the same thing in my computer.
I went to rjones.com.
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe that's where that smell is coming from.
WQA, and Hello.
I'm Drankin.
WQA, and Hello.
Oh, keep going.
QA, and Hello.
QA, and Hello.
WQA, and Hello.
Okay.
WQA, and Line 9.
Hello.
Oh, now this thing is acting up again.
It's doing strange things.
WQA, and Hello.
Hello, and Hello.
Yes, T.
Yeah, I did see.
Yeah.
Okay, that takes care of all the calls for today.
806 votes on the pool.
And I noticed by the way that the crazy callers are way down the list there.
They're not doing well at all.
I can't imagine why.
And by the way, thank you so much, Joyce Fitch, for your tremendous cooperation
to help make this show what it could be, okay?
To help make it a shadow of what it should be and could be.
Because this is the company that refuses to cooperate.
We always have this adversarial relationship because they just...
It's not that they can't, but they won't.
They won't do it.
They won't lift up pinky finger, man.
And by the way, we're still up, and we still only got 62 dropouts, and you're like that.
A rad.
So maybe since Joyce went back there and threatened the George Corsa with death.
He threatened to bring a...
What's his name over from the West Coast?
Bob Vermouth.
If you guys can't get it straight, now we'll bring a real engineer over Bob Vermouth.
And he sure did a great job.
You should have seen when he left an Amsterdam.
The Dutch engineer guy thought he was going to kill himself.
He just left.
He just left a mess there, and as you recall, it didn't work worth a crap.
Remember the one day I put Rimmeron trying to call me?
Oh, yeah.
I remember the day you tried.
Yeah, Rimmer Underwater, which is not a bad idea.
The main reason I listen to Neil is for laughs, 333.
He's a freaking genius, 305.
That's why he works for a bunch of far-bison at Goiam.
With an IQ, the size of your little digit, those bedtime stories are only 39.
To hear him suffer 34, those crazy callers only 29.
Why don't you hear that crap?
Because on board 27, a break from all sports is 14.

He's not holding anything back.
He said he has never in his life imagined even dreamed in his worst nightmare working with a bigger bunch of do nothing slime balls than a QAM.
That's what he told me before the show.
Tigger, you know, Tigger up in Orlando.
From Winnie the Pooh.
The bouncy sidekick to Walt Disney World's Winnie the Pooh is in Troutwood Law again.
That Tigger man is always in his head.
That's why all the employees at Disney, gay.
A Disney employee playing the fame cartoon characters under investigation after a New Hampshire family accused them of punching their 14 year old son during a home video session at Disney MGM Studios.
You go, Tigger, I think that's a great idea.
Somebody's wise ass punk kids man.
Just haul off and smack him.
That's what I should.
That's a good idea.
That's right.
You know, there's nothing worse than wise acre kids.
You know what I'm talking about?
Do I know what you're talking about?
Yeah, you do.
I'm sure your kids are well behaved.
Yeah, but it's the other people's children that really cause a problem.
I see.
Because your kids see it and then they wonder, you know why they're not allowed to behave that way and then you have to hit them twice as hard.
Oh, what keep doing it?
The Orange County Sheriff's Office is at it.
They said it took a report from Jerry Monaco's senior.
I wonder if he's kin to Joe Mars senior or Harold Fisher senior or Jim Merrimon senior.
A report from Jerry Monaco or a Dany Irvine senior.
From Jerry Monaco senior, stating that Tigger struck his son Jerry Jr. on the head about 12, 35 day afternoon.
You go Tigger, run your side, baby.
He felt that Tigger was essentially punched his son and he filed a police report, said, definitely Carlos Padilla.
Or is that Padilla?
Remember that Jose Padilla who then be Padilla?
Right now the allegation is that a battery occurred.
Of course we see a little of that family video tape when we see what appears to be a battery.
We need to talk all sides to see exactly what happened.
Maybe Sally Fitzloste, maybe he dropped out.
That's a good point.
Padilla or Padilla identified the man in the Tigger costume as Michael J. Fettelham, 31 of Kissimmee.
Oh, what a place, Kissimmee.
Fettelham could not be reached for comments said or evening.
Padilla said deputies have been reached for the home and the investigation is ongoing.
You know, I had, where the hell's that other comment?
See you thought that once I said I put that blog up there there would be 80's in comments.
That's what Josh told me.
Well, you did it today, didn't you?
You just started doing it.
Yeah.
Just calm down.
I realized the first one is my first blog entry is not all that's situlating and it's not that relevant to it.
Like the second one is going to be about how I feel about this radio station and its management and its engineering and its sales and its schlock, whatever it is.
Now what the hell did I do with that?
See this is another thing that bugs it out of me.
Let's see, I click on where it says blog up there in the, where Don Colio's head is.
There we go.
It says you have no subscriptions.
I still don't understand what the hell that means.
But anyway, where's the comments? Where's the fourth one?
Here we go.
From Strangelove in Hollywood, who from a distance looks really interesting within his post-up pictures on his page.
Don't look all that interesting.
Maybe that's why he goes home alone every night.
He said, well, whatever.
He's a good guy. Strangelove.
He said, someone once used my picture and pretended to be someone else.
I'll never understand the life of me why they did that.
Are people so miserable with themselves that they have to pretend that they're somebody else?
Yes, absolutely.
Yeah, yeah.
It's the internet and now that we got this my space and your face and all this other crap.
It's a place for people who want to play games.
You know, it's for people who got too much time on their head, played little games like little babies, like infants, like little children.
And just like I said, if somebody doesn't want to tell me where the hell they live, forget about even the city.
Just the county they're in.
I don't want to be involved with somebody like that.
What's with all the secrets, huh?
What's with all the freaking secrets?
Who are you people hiding from?
Probably they're in the damn federal witness protection program.
That could be.
Friday's incident.
I bet you that's where Jacob is.
He's vanished.
He's in the witness protection program.
Hey, Jacob.
Friday's incident is the second nearly three years involving Tigard costume Disney workers in February 2004, a 13-year-old girl and her mother reported being groped and molested by somebody dressed as Tigard Magic Kingdoms Tune Town.
Oh, I've got a great line for that, but you're not going to use it and you know what it is.
Oh.
Sheriff's official surrested Michael Shartran 38, but a jury later acquitted him and he was reinstated as a Disney employee.
In that case, the girl and her mother reported Tigard groped their breasts during a photo session.
You go, Tigard.
When in doubt, pop them out.
Padea said Friday's confrontation was taped by Jerry Monaco, senior actor reviewing the footage with his family.
They decided to come forward.
Disney official said federalins have been suspended and until an internal investigation in the Sheriff's criminal inquiry are completed.
We received a complaint that a character allegedly struck a guest at Zeroyas Suarez, a Disney spokeswoman,
and actually a physical altercation between characters and guests is not tolerated.
The Monaco's home video shot by Jerry Senior shows a towering Tigard staring next to Jerry Monastani next to Jerry Monaco,
Jr., while his mother and two brothers, Neil are standing in front of the costume character.
In a series of seconds, Tigard grabs and locks Jerry Jr.'s left arm with his right arm and then throws a left jab at the teenager's face.
Maybe the kid farted at him or something like that.
Or the kid said something to him like, you're fair.
Which probably is true because he works at Disney.
The Monaco couldn't be reached for comment Saturday at the Greenville, New Hampshire home, but the father and son told TV reporters,
Tigard threw a punch without provocation.
At first I thought he was just kidding around and playing around them when he actually grabbed my arm, Jerry Jr.'s said.
His father said their Disney vacation was marred, did it?
You don't come here for this. I mean Disney is supposed to be a safe place.
It's supposed to be a place that you come and enjoy with your family.
At first I was upset with my son. He said I thought he did something at Tigard.
He probably needed him in the nuts or something like that.
But then I reviewed the tape and it's pretty clear for just no reason he clocked him in the face.
How do you like that? He clocked him in the face.
That damn Tigard.
Yeah, the wonderful thing about Tigard and Tigard is a wonderful thing.
The top's made it a rubber.

Boy, I'm telling you this. We are calm down now on our streaming.
We apologize to those people who are maybe listening online right now.
And congratulations on your perspacacious, on your perseverance.
You ought to see all the zillions of people we have listening online.
And you know what the reason is? It's a bogus number because they listen for two minutes.
And they get knocked off and they log on again.
So it looks like we got a zillion people listening online today.
And up until this hour, last few minutes, we don't have anybody listening online.
Because once again, here we am, can't get it done.
I'm sure that once Josh is full time over there on a QN.com.
You're never going to have problems like this.
Oh, yeah.
You're not eating, are you now?
There's a lot of big meal here on the show.
This is your last supper?
That's right.
Wow.
This may, and the fact that they won't even tell you whether it is or if it isn't.
I mean, you know, is that a difficult question?
Well, they decided that it is.
Josh and Chris decided that it would be.
I see.
It's like my confabulating with somebody online and asking like,
what county do you live in?
Is it brown or is it, and like no response?
And I'm thinking, is that a difficult question?
Huh?
You know what I'm saying?
Too much freaking mystery with you online game players, baby.
Too much mystery and intrigue.
Look at that. The sun just poked through the fog here, man.
Although it's going to start.
We're going to start.
I hit the break the news to all my fellow Torontonians,
but little winners coming.
WDQA and hello.
I'm still playing.
WDQA and hello.
Neil, I've been a fan for over 12 years.
Now, I guess what we still hate you like poison.
Chronic.
Quick drink in that chronic tonic.
Race is, have you seen the Tigger video?
No, this is Ray University Dodge, who's really chronic.
Almost as chronic as the one we just had on the phone.
The one that should be punched is the father from milking this.
They were posing for a picture and little horse playing suit.
Nobody was punched, but the greedy father should be.
Check out the video since Ray.
So you just horse it around and right away they want to make something.
Make a big simist to try to get a few bucks out of Disney.
That's probably what it's all about.
Okay, thanks Ray and get a life by the way.
Ray.
I have no life.
WDQA and hello.
Hello.
Yes sir.
Yes, is this QIM?
Yes it is.
I want Neil to play a continuous loop of Nick Savon, say he's not going out.
Yeah, we don't care about Nick Savon, go away.
Oh, oh, oh.
And get to it snappy, would you?
Yeah, WDQA and hello.
5608, 5608, 5608, 5608, the Verizon singular wireless line.
We're going to take about a big pile of stuff here.
You know what?
I don't think I'm going to read any of it.
I just don't have the enthusiasm to do it.
I've had my kishkis have been worn out that first hour today.
That was like doing a 60 hour marathon at first hour.
But we are often streaming now.
We had only 62 dropouts in the first hour.
I'm going to tell you, dropout is the word.
If you want to know about our management middle level, upper middle, you want to know about the beastly, dropout is the word.
As in that dropout from school, I'm talking about dropout from the human race like that.
Or maybe drop out of the tree in between streaming on the banjo and picking you nose.
Now what that was I supposed to play?
Oh, the girl with the infosima.
Excuse me, I'll get to it.
Yeah.
1113.
That's another one, Gary Sarner.
There's another genius.
Yeah, you're doing it, baby.
Let me tell you.
Oh, yeah, I'm taking a day.
A day, a day.
Oh, baby, I can't get me in a day.
Oh, that's why I'm supposed to play another one, sorry.
The girl he's gonna do at home?
Yeah.
While I forgot all about it cuz my old timer is this kicking in.
Here it is.
Then gets in the Astrid Gilbertal Astrid Gilbertal
The girl with empathy might keep smoking and when she passes she flips her ashes
When she smokes she's like the chimney that shoots up clouds on smiths on her stick
That when she passes she passes gas and goes
Oh but she wants to quit badly
Capping up big junky lungers
Yes she would keep them up gladly
But it's there when she has to go pee
She sits on the can and likes to pee
Shocked and felled in and sickly
The girl with empathy might go smoking and when she passes she smiles with big yellow teeth
Oh but she's smoking
Oh but she's smoking
Oh but she's smoking
Oh but she wants to quit badly
But it's there when she has to go pee
She sits on the can and likes to pee
Shocked and felled in and sickly
The girl with empathy might go smoking and then she flashes that smile with big yellow teeth
And gunk on the meat
She just cannot breathe
It's only a least
Can I have a light please?
No
Honey passed 11 at 5.60 Q.M.

A federal bankruptcy court in New York rule Thursday
The case could proceed despite the fact that they're America's file from Chantra Love and Bank of America
Under federal law legal proceedings against the company are frozen when the company declares bankruptcy
CACI, international, asked the bankruptcy court in November to allow its case to go forward arguing that it claims against
Scare America are covered by insurance policy
Any damages will be paid out of that policy and not from the company's assets
The company sued our American its parent company Picon LLC as well as Rhodes in the fall of 2005 for defamation
The suit stem from comments he made August 25th and 6th 2005 on a video show
According to the complaint she accused CACI employees of raping and murdering Iraqis of Indians at Abu Gharr prison claims that the CACI said were false and defamatory
They're seeking a million dollars in compensatory damages and 10 million impudentive damages
And Air America is spokeswoman to climb the coming of the lawsuit. They got problems made at Scare America
US District Court dismissed the case but CACI appealed that ruling the bankruptcy court decision laws that appealed it proceed
Air America declared bankruptcy October 13 but a company spokeswoman said last month it was supposed to reach a deal with a via
Arlington Virginia based CACI is an information technology consulting firm against most of its revenue from government contracts
A subsidiary company provided it's a written interrogators for the US military and Iraq the company acknowledges from place
And a part of the perpetrator how do you like that what are you thinking in brief?

Ponderous crazy and unacceptable on board 31 that's why they listen to a board well we kill some good time for you
I hate this pull 15 I hate Neil 14 it's a break from all sports 14 and he speaks the truth
Coming up tonight inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story
They topped the charts with an upbeat little number about a very particular sexual fantasy
They didn't even give a crap that it was scientifically impossible they were the weather girls
It's raining but I don't know if it's raining but song is an abomination against God
Reverend Peter vent is a fire and grinched old preacher who believes the weather girls 1980s hit is an abomination against God
I just said that sorry for God has sent many plays rain and from the sky blood fire even frogs
But for the sky to deposit men into the waiting hungry sweaty loins of moistened harlots is nothing but an abomination against God
Testify a brother now I tell you if and I mean if the all powerful did decide to rain men upon this earth
It would not be a simple festival of lust no it would actually be very dangerous it would go something like this
The horror the horror and the weirdest thing brothers and sisters is that somehow this blasphemous old to promiscuity
Very quickly became an anthem for the homosexual may I quote Corinthian 613 for the prophet did say the gays like this thing go figure
The weather girls if loving them is wrong I don't want to be right it's a big juicy sobbing wet look at your business tonight on inside the bar
It's raining men and they all look like Ryan Salipan I know who you did last summer
I got her outside 917 votes by buddy Mike up at FSU who's from Cooper City but goes to FSU when listen is online
He's not in a very good mood today because he's been trying to listen and he's really a peoed about it real bad
Not too happy hang in there Mike just hang 63 dropouts well that's only one since like an hour ago
And it's up it's up and running out we're streaming it baby and guess what I'm going to do in a couple of minutes
I give up what he can do besides jump out the window I'm going to eat my lunch right here on the air since the job that new audience was usual
Well since we're all enjoying our farewell lunch for Josh Cortes today maybe now is it for sure that tomorrow you're going to be out of there
What about Chris how's Chris doing over there he's doing good he left he'll be here tomorrow good job by Chris yeah I guess
Wow did he get back to know Chris did we get him some food for his trouble no he didn't want any I asked
Oh he's not going to be doing a very good job anybody that is involved with this show and doesn't want to eat a lot of free food
What it looks like he eats a lot of free food is he fat yes oh no anyway I'm going to be in a couple of wings here in a minute they're in the flavor wave right now
All right and I got my French's monster here my flavor wave every every Saturday it's flavor wave bacon Saturday because it comes out perfect
It's a routine thing now it does yeah we have cooks evenly all the grease strips off of it well you're talking about real bacon not the other
No real because my mic is you hear me every morning before the show either outside
I was just going to ask you what conch nighters what you can't get it there it's Canadian though no no wonder because every microwave bacon I get it
Oh it was stuffed on their sucks the only good one I found is Schneiders and it's yeah well you come up here and get some or you just send some town no
924 votes in a pool so I'm going to have a couple of weenies right here on the year during the show wow with my French is a yellow monster
Yeah the flavor wave is great I use it almost every single day now what company did you get that front remember that one guy who was it
Yeah I haven't never sprained down that one day like they're writing a book everybody's writing a book
That would be a good book yeah the good book says 5 6 7 0 5 60 fact I may go out and get to it when you hear that beep beep you know how
when the flavor wave is done cooking and the thing about the flavor wave is even when the cooking time is done yeah it goes like
when the cook time is done it's still the elements still stays on it comes on every now and so it keeps the food warm on right
It is a fine machine mine WQ I am hello WQ I am hello Q I M
Hello yes sir yeah no which one was that the same one
Wow could have fooled me but what are we at what Chris yeah Chris actually fades in faster and you do remember when you were on vacation that week
and Tahoe oh yeah they get like about a half a half a word out it's like they just disappear while we'll have to make in the new board
off of the show then won't we I'm going to go get my weenies you like it
and off he goes so when we last left this conversation you didn't know what office you were going to be operating out of
I think I put you in the bullpen they've already got like bunk desks in there I'm thinking maybe they're going to give me like a mini desk
and I'll be up against the wall I see you know you could always use the other side of Allison's desk because I mean she didn't think it could get any worse
that's what we're looking at guess what what's that two people per desk in the bullpen oh yeah you're going to be sitting in somebody's lap in there
double duty you're going to be sitting in Allison's lap yeah my mouse to it here can you hear it I can hear it clinking around
now do you fear or do you dip I swear it all over the way in her man there we go and then I take my knife and I like even it out you know what I mean
absolutely so it's like nice and there were no clumping and you don't want to a big mustard deposit you know the good thing about the flavor
right and when you close something even like this yeah it's like it was cruffed in the grill yeah and the other good thing is that you know since it's clear and all lit up
and you can see how far along your food is coming it's nice and because some people that are very paranoid about raw chicken like some of us who got served raw chicken a lot as a kid
thanks mom can can satisfy themselves that it's nice and burnt before they get into it well I'll be damned so this is our farewell lunch with Josh quarters we think sure thanks how we may he may or may not have a place to sit when he moves over to qm.com
he might just have to move over to the other side of the little card table that we have over here on the side at least we have a
little card table for a place to squeeze in and it's what it looks like so far and if Chris isn't one of those five things I want to all the free food you can come in and have your free food every day is to him I probably still will be and we got you
to explore we got to train really well I watch the story I guess my dog is a cafe of wine huh yeah see now this feels more like at home you know
you know you should hear me eat on the ear right I haven't been doing that 189 by the way the scariest morning not too bad that's good that's not great but I mean I just can't
break through that level I don't know what it is maybe there's a few I'm sure way yeah yeah that wasn't me what was that
so I was a judge where expect can feel solstice me to call any second now okay Jim Scholar get rid of him he's a crazy person yes he is if you tell the truth people I got to think you're crazy now look at you look at me not too happy with what I see the
reason main reason I was in the 1131 votes we got the thousand licked easy man you are such a
negative a little you know why just because just guys Joe Bell called you on Friday and live to you no actually he repeated
everything that he said to you behind my back so yeah that he thinks he's stuck on here uh huh and the tapes are better there aren't
going to be any tapes because there isn't going to be any extension there isn't going to be any need of working four days a

individuals if they like put me down as a friend again open up their profiles so I could like

inseparable best thourooses what they are ridiculous five six seven here's my last call see if we're

you know with the holidays and everything this is the beginning of the see you thought it was last
Tuesday so did I but it wasn't surprise yeah no seriously this is the beginning of going back to
real reality and the kids aren't even back in school yet right they yes brother they yes and
of course in no way well brow are they gonna learn there anyway five six seven oh five sixty
especially now that they got no more pumpernicks what are you gonna learn in brow for grindout
lana that the old people steal the silverware and the sweet and low and the rolls and the
deal pickles you know those old bags that start that stuff the deal pickles in their purse with all
the hair and the toe jam and oh man that must be real appetizing when you get home trying to gum
on the pickles from a pumpernicks they're even using like a little zip lock bag in there when
surprise me here's a message from Phil he says Joe Bell is an a-hole if he thinks tapes are
better than George haven't they done enough damage to the program in the past years with all the
timeslot changes firing Joe Rose putting Galdion here seems like the program managers work at
trying to screw things up Phil absolutely you got it yeah tapes my they will never be any more
these stupid best stuff tapes this this is Joe Bell's nimble mind to work again wow you know the
audience wants to hear Neil when they turn on Fred like in a summertime when I'm not there three
days a week and when we still are number one by a mile and beat the whole lot of the other segments
on the station by a mile got them fooled now this is a guy who just doesn't like you on here that's
all right it goes around well I'm sure Greg probably you know gave him a talking to it said oh George
you don't want him on there you don't kill the ratings and you can't sell the show when George is
on by that like that like I said it's a good point there are no negotiations going on there
are not going to be any and you know for once in my life I'm going to butcher up see the problem
with me is and I will admit it I'm weak just like this thing with all this online crap man I'm weak
in the case of the online stuff as you know and I make no apologies for it I'm a sucker for a
cute face that's all I mean that that's me you know you're either the only one there of course not
if it was just me I'd say well I was wrong with me well everybody is there most people are
anyway some people are a little bit wiser than that they've had some bad they've been burned too
many times right scarred they've put their hand on the stove too many times they don't want to get
burned again and in the case of this place I keep saying well I got a you know two years to go

I'm even gonna change my size how do you like that this is pretty quick whenever I shave my balls

The wind's freaking on Nicky Finn
She did the jarl stun
To do galling, can
For her her mind would will
When she crept of molten burl
She wore it out bit
Like a rapper
Cause I've no admission
She could have no maker
She robbed the comedy show
Like Jojen Ways to
But never happened to Abby
She was on second
I don't know if I'm sorry
She was a filthin' and chaplain
Waiting for gay couples
And Charles Limber to do that
The president was Hoover
There was no TV
And no I love the scene
Also free actin' high
1990, 1990, 1925
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
We're about 10 years too late
Yep, that's when things were great
When thing was president
O.J. was innocent
But we could still see friends
And few percent blood dead
Barely added internet
And there was no spaniards
Never heard about bin Laden
Wall Street was always in the black
We still care about my gun
And not about sneak attacks
And all that great music
Yeah, you could take your big
Like it was sent from God
No cell phones, no things don't
No, I'd pause
Play no racist or hoody
That brandy was a cutie
There was a land that's more sex
And Julius Blip from love
And the fulcans were smashing
The Beatles tried to dash in
But something white feels right since
1919, 1990, but
Woo-hoo!
1990, but
Woo-hoo!
You know Mariah
And Whitney
They beat the pants on Britney
We still had some teasers
But also there was Wizard and We had so feet
We hogged in
Yeah, she was good for dogging
I wondered if she's through my bath
19, 1995
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!
2004's your sucks
Next year we'll have more luck
I can see it now
I bet they'll cure Matt Gow
Might even fight a cure
For that guy Michael Moore
When you feel you're SUV
That gas will all be free
Even when we're stuck to our taxes
Depends it's will still go down
And rather we'll not use taxes
Osama will be found
I know it will be peace
Throughout the Middle East
All kids will graduate
And clear eyes will be
So straight please let it be great year
I sure hated this year
Don't eat War's art, elections
And no more blue infections
And C.E. will be
Cleaners and start jumps
We'll be leaners
Let's all look down
The bright side is
2000, 2000, 2005
Okay, it is a 1205
Oh, I thought this story wasn't going to print out
But now it's printing out
Excellent
A little bit on the slow side
That's probably because it's from the Herald
Here's some videos for all you drug drivers
Wait a minute, where the hell is the story
Here's a blank page, says Miami Herald
Here it is
About 300 drug driving cases in Broward County
Could be thrown out following a state of political
Arrolling in proper maintenance of the alcohol breath test machines
Renders the results
Inadmissible
The fourth district court of appeal upheld the judges
Really tossed out and toxilized the results in a DUI case
Because the machine had been tested with tap water
Instead of distilled water
The FDA requires that the breath test machines use the still water
The fence of attorneys argue that tap water may skew the results
But the both the Groud Sheriff's Office and the Navy police department used tap water to test their machines
So if you had a DUI, it kind of like
Turned your life upside down for a while, too bad your sprues
Unless you're one of the current 300 pending ones
How do you like that?
Well, what do you know
I'm sorry
So anyway, mission to Mars, that's a Gerolitos group and I'm not going to read this whole thing
Thank you very much.
30 seconds to Mars
30 seconds, why?
That's the name of the group.
What do I call it?
Mission to Mars.
That's okay.
Do you like it?
Well, the headline on a story says mission to Mars
Okay, I understand.
And my being a little bit off my feet today
My eyes were wandering, my mind was wandering
I understand.
You should see up the date about Jared, you know
Well, you were telling me that he's given up the music
That's what the story says
Is that what this story says?
I don't think it's a word for her because it's too long
Thanks Tracy, but enough already with that
Plus he's about 35, 36, and he's going to be an old man
Too late for me.
Geezer.
And I hate Neil, I hate this fool, I got 15 apiece
Well, guess what? I hate those 15 too
I do like that like poison
WDQYM, hello
Hello, Mr. Neil
Yes, could you play
What is that? Could you play?
What is that?
In other words, you have nothing to say, this is a request?
No, no, well, it's one that you haven't played in a while
And since you're playing the fart sounds again, I figure you can play this bit again
Who says we're playing fart sounds again?
Are you hallucinating again?
The raspberry's in there
Yeah, what is it?
My anus?
Yeah, your anus is exactly right, that's just what I was thinking when I heard your voice
I thought my aching angel
God
Wow
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60, and the other rising and singular rising
So maybe I will play that
What's wrong with that?
I don't know. Nothing wrong with it. I don't think so
No, nothing wrong with a Joycemind having a resident. Too bad Joyce.
Joyce doesn't run this show. She does nothing for this show except in her fear and tried to do everything in her power
And my earthwhile attorney, he's sitting back there with his finger deep inside his thumb
Some young guys
I'm going to tell you something normal. You ought to be raising a holy hell, writing a letter, making a phone call
That's not going to get the job done. These people need to be brought to justice
You know what I'm saying?
I know what you're saying
And for justice, we better get a hold of Don Coyote
That's right, or somebody. The guy that ran our MySpace page looks like Don Coyote unto me
WQA and Hello
Hi, I'm a Kira Tommy
WQA and Hello
I like Project 3
QA and
Hello
Hey, how are you?
I was hearing you went to Mohican Sun the other day
I went to what?
Mohican Sun the casino
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I want to know the name of the casino you go to
WQA and Hello
QA and
I've got a phone and
WQA and Hello
That's a that's a food bee
It's a what?
Kaka?
WQA and Hello
WQA and Hello
Yes, I saw Rocky 37 yesterday
And
He lost
Oh, okay, thanks for those. I'm going to have to waste our money in our time on it. Piece of crap
Slice the law and is this guy got talent?
No, can he act?
No, he's garbage
He just turned 90 by the way, not really. He votes on the pool
5, 6, 7, come on, keep him coming
Baby, you can do it right up till 2
You can do I'm positive
I think starting tomorrow we're doing the music format
All right, oldies, oldie moldies
Something old, something new
There's a definite void for that in the market. We got all these great jingles
Effect there's one guy that used to work for the beesleys
I think it was a trap
In a lot of these messages you get, a lot of these emails you get on my space
They're a trap and he wants you to write back and say oh yeah the beesleys, they're waiting
Cycle, Christ already said
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh yeah, we got so many jingles man, might as well put them to use
What a waste have them sitting there in the DCS
And now the Chris is going to be starting tomorrow, right?
Yeah, we don't want to have to put a lot of pressure on him on the very first official day of the jump
Assuming that Josh is actually going over to the other side
I am
Oh it's official now?
Well, like I said Clarence said for Chris and I to decide and we decided tomorrow
Let's stop prolonging this
For Chris and I to decide
Well what does that mean?
Meaning like I have to show him a few things and I feel like he knows more
Yeah, that's why he ran out of there
That's why he ran out of there, you should have seen it
I don't want to see it
It's not what you think
Show him a few things
Oh brother, I didn't expect that color
Oh brother, talk about another shade of pale
Good for Chris, yeah good for him, run him out
Damn good thing, Muff didn't come in there in the middle of that demonstration
990p votes, we're going to have a thousand votes by the end of the break
Which really makes me feel
I like it
You wanted more and you got it
The man's dog is back singing more duet on the bandage scene
You too
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Over the 80s is back carrying up with the great singing more take his
Which even more big stars the mad dog does them all
Baby
Everything
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
It's an all new British invasion
With the mad dog singing like a man
I like it
I like it
The truth is peeing out
That you managed was truly the fifth people
You got to get it in love and he's giving it in love
Everyone loves the land
And now your head's to stay
You know it's every stage you're gonna be all right
And you're gonna be all right
Here's the mad dog's ender and touching tribute to the king
I love this
All right
All right
That's a random among anyway
The mad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again
Now I don't think so
So we had Luke the Grotsey family with it and tell him either his brains or his signature would
Why don't they contract that's some of the fish is cute
All right
All right
All right
And it's this volume new
Available now if you move quickly
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
That's a wonderful
Double UQM
In Miami
All the music all the time
I'm pretty music-filled to a fly
All right
I'm not asking I'm telling
And I would love it
It's not a question of like all right or like
I'm acknowledging not a proofy
Well I mean I'm sitting here
You know evaluating this whole Joe Bell business and I'm thinking to myself
You know we've been over these many many years
We're with some real losers
Boozers and losers
And this guy he just he don't get it
I mean you know you spend 45 minutes on the phone
This on the heels of that very important lunch you know with Bruce Beasley and Norman
All those other crap and you you're spew your guts out and you tell them what you need and what you want and what life is all about and but a beep but a boop but a boop but a boop but a boop
Oh yeah sure hey pal you know
And then after 45 minutes on the phone it's like well I don't know what to tell you
I know what to tell you
The main reason I listen to Neil is for laughs 411 he's a freaking genius 362
Those bedtime stories 50 to hear him suffer 43 I'm bored 41 I can understand the crazy colors 39
He speaks the truth 32 a break from all sports 17 I hate Neil 15 and I hate this pool only 15 only 1 and a half percent
I got is that thing real?
You know the diamond just wasn't my style so I began working nights down here
There's a janitor in the sole office building just to keep busy I guess because I'm a little bit more
But hey there's the big cheese now big how you doing tonight? Hey we're gonna lay right here. How you doing? You have it a pretty tough night?
Yeah tonight night you're gonna watch it and watch the game tonight. Yeah, I'm in across the street free piece of
Beer night over there. I'm pretty tough day. I thought I just watched the game with the fellows over at the bar. Oh yeah
I'm just gonna listen to it on this old radio here to Antenna's kind of shaking
I'm gonna make green color TV over there. It's best picture. I'm a big screen color great picture. I heard it is
Glad you're like to be there when you know I got all my work done and all really here. You're all done? Yeah, you're supposed maybe I could
Well, I'll tell you what
I got my BMW in the garage. I got a blop-pooed Nick radio and there I can pick up the you can drive me anything
No, no, I'll give my car keys. Why don't you clean up my car? I got a wicked thing in the back seat
Yeah, I've got something to drink. I'm including up with Simon is it. I'll be back in about two hours
I don't maybe I'll bring a piece of pizza, okay dad
Well, that was a thanks lot to hear my keys and be careful with the straights of the car now be back in about two hours
Yeah, I got a little bit of a watch. You're not gonna bring while you
Ungrateful you after said you were worth was
Tell you can't be my son. Nobody's that ungrateful you
Take your stain BMW and run that mother
Right into the damn river

Last night I took a walk every time
I played a play called Family Day Bar
I had to come and see what I could see
That brother, where I was, I was around
I was certainly sure
That girl and Thomas I was all alone here
And I was always looking for a hand with me
My heart was quiet and I was looking for a hand
Together, down, I like a girl I'm going to pass
I like a little kid, and around
I like a merry-go-round
Me and Lynn, and I were not friends
They came around and were rocking bands
And when I was looking for a hand girl I was
And just one of us all
You never know where the hands will
When you stop them, one of us will burn
And we'll let them tell it all
That I call this a song
We need to say that all of us are fair
When and you're round, we're rocking bands
And every single one I gave that girl a hug
And just one of us all
You never know where they took that ring
And when you stop them, you have to come and tell them
Where it's real, and I'm telling them
Oh, I've got an acolyte card
And I'm telling them it's hard to bear
You know it's hard to bear
Or it's great to radio with what the kids want
And you have
I'm going down, I'm going five
It's nearly one million new and five
It's in a ride
It's in a ride
Gotta get me home
By the morning light
I got no fear to ride a train
I'm really drowning in the pouring rain
It's in a ride
It's in a ride
Gotta get me home
To the baby side
Ride, ride, ride
It's in a ride
Ride, ride, ride

Ride, ride, ride

It's in a ride

In a way too long
From the baby side

She's so pretty, lost in fire
I'm gonna make her mad over here

Won't you pardon me
Pretty woman
I couldn't ever see

And you don't know me
That can be
Are you lonely
And just like me
Oh

Okay
I just thought you were on home
I played
The next tomorrow night
Put away
What do I see
Ah!
Did you walk in the back to me
Oh yeah
Did you walk in the back to me
Oh
Pretty woman
A little bit of a format change this afternoon
You have something I'm kind of enjoying it myself
Yeah well you haven't played a song I don't like yet
Well there you go
Oh man I taste in the oldies
I'm talking about moldy oldies
Right
Is the best
And I don't know
Is that even Ricky Tiki's probably tipping his smelly camp to me
You know I said here and I finally decided
You know I finally butched up
Remember I was talking about an hour ago about butchering up a little bit
Yes he worked
And I can't depend on Linfrist and Norma Kent
Because she's got a composer letter
And she's got a while in between runaways or whatever he's doing
And of course smoky Joe Bell
That's his whole thing is blowing smoke
You know as you discovered on Friday
Blowing smoke
Well you were probably had the old
But that's beside the point
So I'm just going to give it back
You know what I mean by that?
I do
Exactly
They want to give me like a lame effort
I'll give them the same
The main reason I listen to Neil is
A thousand ninety two votes
And of course we could probably add the nifty oldie music
But we won't do that yet
Till a couple of weeks
Oh oh
The main reason I listen is for laughs 435
He's a freaking genius 375
Those bedtime stories 51
He speaks the truth 47
Well that's climbing the ladder does it matter?
No
To hear him suffer 47
Because he works for the beesleys
I'm bored 46
The crazy caller is 41
A break from all sports 18
I hate this poll 17
I hate Neil like poison that miserable old bastard 15
I just pray to quit
I like to shave my legs, arms and buns
While listening to the Neil Rogers
One to two hours
I hate this poll 17
I hate this poll 17
I hate this poll 17
I hate this poll 17
I hate this poll 17
I hate this poll 17

We're hopping in the time machine
Hold on, won't you come along and change?
Here's the golden vector from the WQAN
Right now

I hate this poll 17

Oh, alright
I'll sleep in and lie in the middle of a good dream
I thought it was a wake-up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
You're fair with four I go and say
I hold my pillow to my head
And spring up in my bed
Streaming out the words I've read
I think I love her, you know
I think I love you
This morning I woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with it
And so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
And never talk about it
And did not go and shout it when you walked into it
I think I love her
I think I love you
For one of my four brain-outs
I'm a breath that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for
I'm not me
I think I love you
This is not what life can fail
You like it always
We're in need of things
But I never felt this way
I think I love you
I think I love you
For one of my four brain-outs
I'm a breath that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for
I think I love you
This morning I woke up with this feeling
I think I love you
This is not what life can fail
So it's what it's made of
I never felt this way
You really don't have to worry
I only want to make you happy
And if you shake it away, I will
But I think there's still a better way
I'd better stay around
And love you
You think I have a need
Let me ask you to
You'll think here
Let me cure love me
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
Well, I sure love him
I'll say that very proudly
But that's a long time ago
That's another era and another age
But anyway, hey David, you're ferried
So I'm going to chapter one at 560 WDQ
I'm a little format-change here today
You know something we might like enough
It might continue all week long
You know what I was jamming out to that
We're here
There's a whole lot of segment there
You've been on it?
Just ask Josh, man, I was a one-man karaoke show in here
I love you, man
I like this so much
I like this so far
And I'm Josh probably don't like into this music
Because it's way before his time
I don't have a problem with it
I'm not listening to it into my car
But I don't have a problem with it
Do you like it?
I do
Well, I'm good
Because we want you to go on in your last day
With a big smile on your face
You know?
Are you going up with a big smile on your face?
He's good
He's good
From the early year on your big fat push
1125 votes on a pole
We're not too bad on there
I don't know what this line really means
Maybe if it's explained to me
It's the new year, are your feet hurting?
No
What?
Oh, I thought you were asking me a question
Can you explain what that line means?
No, I can't
I asked Brian Schmuss, maybe he'll say this
I'm not talking about your pretty side
Am I junior, honey?
Am I junior, honey?
I'm going down the shower
Where the mother wants
Go to hang from trees and play banjo
You got some food on the station
All new Frank won't be ready
Oh, now as North
Carolina goes
Rolly's a big city
You know?
And that's where the beesleaves had to go
For Golly, Riley Joe
Oh, I knew GM
He'll do what he can
Shake your hand like a friend
Then quickly walk away
They had Joe go to five-six-oh
With ratings and the toilet mold
To get those
Flaming sportful mose
In order and control
And then so
Golly, Rolly Joe
A vah-fueler
And in the loathe let's mose
Go and hear what blows
Golly is on show
He'll make a big change
And read a range
It's worse for the same
He hasn't done a thing
No, for what goes
All the air had to
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue
About a poor
Not that essentially
Blows sportful radio
The GM
Oh, five-six-oh
Golly, Rolly Joe
Seek K of W. Motham Sound
Ah!
Night's sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to
You were my destiny
If I was open wide
I knew it would be my pride
I'm satisfied to use
That it came out of love for you
Golly, Rolly Joe
When you leave
I'm always begging time
Oh, baby
You will win
You will be there for me
There's no need to know
No, no, no, no
For what?
We got love
Show love that you know
You're home
You're home I need
To get by

Which isn't nearly as entertaining as Wayne's press conference
The honey tune yeah
Spent two years learning California
Standing in line clutching my jeans
Open I didn't soap my underers
Cause I knew my brother was so weird
All that night I felt water retention
I stood in line said things I'd rather not mention right now
Just after midnight I looked up
Saw the signs saying half a new year
But we're closed now but I said
I gotta be so bad
But now we're giving a say
To prevent myself from feeling my shoe
So I gotta be so bad
What do I do?
What do I do?
I told him say
We're wonderful
WQKL in Miami
We did together sing the way back where
Sometimes I never want to see you again
But I want to know after all the years
You're still the one I want to spend in Miami
You're still the one going on to the stage
You're the one that's in my head
We're still coming home and you're still the one
I know that you're being everyday
You're my name so I do my way to you again
I just wanted to go
I wanted to go
I'm still the one that's in my head
We're still wonderful
And you're still the one you think is
You're still the one that makes me proud
You're still the one that's in my head
We're still wonderful

You're still the one and you're still the one
You're still the one who gets scratched by me
You're still the one that's in my head
We're still wonderful and you're still the one
You are still the one that makes me proud

She came out of you yesterday
Oh right, this is song in my heart
And the chance to be yours forever
I couldn't feel my secure
I know I couldn't feel any better
Oh Lord, ever knows
Because I'm a child of you
I'm a child of you

You never hear it
If I said to you
Oh Lord, ever know, how much I love you, how much it shows.
Oh Lord, ever, ever knows.
I was never without you, trying to make it a love.
Oh Lord, ever know, what there's nothing about you.
Now your heart is my heart, if it's all in my heart.
And the chance to be your scarlet love, couldn't feel more secure.
I know I couldn't feel any effect of, oh Lord, ever know.
Oh Lord, ever know, how much I love you, how much it shows.
Oh Lord, ever, ever knows.
Oh Lord, ever know, how much I love you, how much it shows.
Oh Lord, ever, ever know, what there's nothing about you.
