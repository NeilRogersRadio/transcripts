Sometimes I feel that life is having me by.
Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile.
And I turn on my radio.
It makes me smile like a child.
Theil's rudges on my radio.

Too bad we can't play the real good ones.
Oh, yeah.
Wow, there's a lot of good stuff we can't play.
I'm so whipped up about the...
You told me yesterday about this disc.
No, not that kind of disc.
Does this day send me a long time ago?
Right.
I went to scouring through here.
And there are some really great stuff on here.
Yes, there is.
Including all that boring stuff.
Do you know a coffee, book, chick?
Hello.
See now when you get the movie with the real subtitles.
I'll put your friends on the screen.
I like you.
Do you like me?
I do like you.
You're one of my friends.
You're a nice young man and I am your friend.
You will be my boyfriend.
I won't be your boyfriend.
Why not?
You don't like me?
I can be.
You don't like me.
No boyfriend, yeah.
Sure.
You got to see it.
This is something called a movie show.
It's a movie show.
It's a movie show.
It's been in my country.
I'll tell you which one of these I like the best is...
...Mitch Lewis.
Oh, yeah.
It makes Lewis Lewis lose.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
I want to be a man.
All right.
There we go.
And I'll tell you about your people.
Of course.
Well, let's just say...
...Mitch Yem Foo...
...Kilabira Mepato...
That's also a bit.
How about your partner?
That's also a bit.
No.
Of course it is.
What?
You think I'm stupid or something?
I don't answer please.
What is a Mexican Julian?
No, is he a Mexican?
No, I'm a Mexican Julian.
Why?
You can't lie.
You can't say anything.
Sometimes I feel...
...that I don't want to smile.
Wow, wow.
I like to smile on my radio.
Next, I smile.
I just smile.
I like to know my radio.
New, I just want my radio.
New, I just want my radio.
New, I just want my radio.
You feel...
...new, I just want my radio.
Oh.
Oh, I say exactly.
But there's a whole bunch of good ones.
Too bad we can't play the really good one there that I like the best.
But we can't play this.
Sure, it's good.
Sure, it's good.
Sure, it's sweet to the point.
Don't my favorite though.
The original is always the best.
Oh, oh, oh.
We're full.
Sometimes I feel...
...like life passing by.
Oh, hey.
Sometimes I feel...
...that's a little bit like people don't want to smile.
Oh, it'll listen to show of their nice.
Maybe it's my like a child.
You walk a life horse.
You can hear me get by my friend.
Bill Carter on a radio.
You won't stop.
Bill Carter on a radio.
Married, oh yeah.
Quack solid.
Too bad we can have time to play it.
Throw the Jews down the well.
I guess we do.
But we don't.
So you know, I showed...
...Bokobrand didn't want to see that movie.
I showed him one scene from it.
Bokobrand?
Yeah, and I thought he was going to vomit and die.
Really?
So, please.
That's why I felt watching that raising your zone of ear tonight.
Well, what's the couple scenes I thought I was going to vomit and die?
But for different reasons, trust me.
Not because it was funny.
You know, I was thinking to myself as I watched that.
What a pile of crap, man.
That's what I was thinking.
There's some real gems on here on this disc.
Yeah, there are.
Some of the lost treasures, for example, a heraldosin.
Isn't that right?
That was the idea.
No, she doesn't have it.
That's not true at all.
Don't you...
You don't have a penis.
It's a wonder-developed penis.
That's what I was told when I was a small child.
But Bokob, isn't it the fact that it's really your big problem?
You were told it's a small child.
You said that you were a himaferdite.
I was told a lot of things when I was a small child.
So, were you lied to you, Bokobrand?
I don't think I was lied to about my past.
No, not at all.
Did you live your life in your early informative years as a woman?
Yes.
And it is totally...
It is totally my whole life.
How?
I...
I had to wonder...
I'm a very athletic person.
I've always been a jeans and t-shirt type girl.
You fail.
I wonder when it could unclose if I looked like a dyke.
I wonder if it's the way I wear my hair.
People are going to think I'm a dyke.
Absolutely.
I wonder what people are thinking about me.
I wonder how in the hell did I let this happen to me?
How could I see this?
Always check the package, baby.
Canter.
There's Al Gore sitting there, the former Vice President.
It says happening now, I'm seeing him.
You're in rocks.
Oh my God he is...
Good intentions, I'll give him that.
Of course he was elected president in 2000.
But all those things aside, it's like a comedy, you know?
Anyway, here's the pull result from yesterday and we killed a lot of good time with it sometimes. I feel I love that stuff
Call living in the past I guess. Well the past part of the past wasn't so bad in fact there are stuff if we could just select
Those portions of the past that we can go back and relive
Take me back to World Cup week it's not that long ago memory is still fresh in my mind
1524 votes on a pull from yesterday if somebody from out of town visits South Florida make sure they don't miss and
Look at this man. You talk about a feather in my cap
Oh god the legendary near Roger show wins hands down your pants 387
Make sure they don't miss it. I would advise them not to come in a first place 358
That's my advice anybody listening around the universe. Oh look at this hundreds lineup for sheep testicles
Well, we'll get to that story in a moment
South Beach 297 there you go a lot of plastic people would like a lot of jewelry like tons of jewelry just dripping from their neck and
Lots of gay people. They're outbound flight. Don't miss that 179 in fact
You'll probably after the first hour or two you want to turn around make sure you catch it
I hate this pull only 73 a mere 4.7 percent not bad
The sawgrass mills mall I evade it so schmaltzy man 42. I have no idea. You know like I told you you know
Where it is compared to my house? I don't know what the big attraction is maybe somebody can explain it to me the sawgrass mill
It's big. There are 700 different languages spoken there every day and not one of them is English 42 votes little Havana
Speaking to English 39
No speaking English a key the early bird dinner 31
The jungle queen dinner crew is 31 lots of jungle queens my guy 23 and I I don't get it
Cemetery village 22 Metro Zoo 22 the monkey general 12 the parachungal only five soltampo chinkway and
Veskaya only three
Now that's kind of surprising isn't it?
I mean we put it on the at the end of the pool, but nevertheless yeah
Well, what only three for Veskaya, which is supposed to be like legendary
What's the big dealer? I've never been there. What's the big thing? It's big. It's beautiful beautiful gardens beautiful house beautiful
Antiques for people who are into that kind of thing for big houses in the big big old houses with
Carbon statues and gray
He was into base stuff was he 797 votes on a day's pool so Chris can just sit back easy and duck brought everybody in breakfast there this morning
Nice go crazy. He brought in an order of chicken fingers for us to share, but thank you, though. I gave it to Chris and
Then I thought you said he brought everybody in breakfast like he brought a lot of food in
To try to pacify you because it's your hot Wednesday
You guys keep getting the scoot over every Wednesday because nothing's taken career
So so in order to pacify for that he brought you in an order of chicken fingers
Yes, which I gave to Chris, but thank you stuff just the same. Yeah, what is the big deal with that?
He paid for it himself. Wow. Whoo heavy duty duster. Hey, Duff you're fairy
11 past 10 at 560. We got no bogging today
We got a full four hours man
And I'm sure we got a lot of additions to our pool for today
I see Tom Brady's already on there and most of the guys that want to be Tom Brady
It's not because well because they want to be wealthy and they want to be a big famous jocke
It's because of who he's doing you know they want to be they want to take his place
And who can blame them when you come right down with I
Wouldn't mind being Tom Brady. I'd rather be Brady Quinn. He's a few years younger
Although if I was Brady Quinn, I would have gone and ordained could I've ever lived that down? Oh now the fighting Irish touchdown
Jesus baby. Oh brother. There's another redundancy. What is that fighting Irish for that pole that we're gonna do?
Drunken Irish fighting Irish drunk an Irishman. Oh, yeah, I do like that pole's a great idea
It's not the one for tomorrow though already fast that they don't forget to change it this afternoon because it's wood by Wednesday
I'll be fighting the good batter with hopefully a good machine on this afternoon. Oh
I think you know just just
Common Luxus sooner or later. I'm not kind of do you know what I'm gonna think do for a good day at woodmine?
Yeah, do or not is the case may be do the do is
Do do you do that already done that I read done done do do
No, hello everyone. This is more you've over chose to occur in a fair
They don't come any better than Neil Roger several days ago
I commented briefly on some recent statements that have been made by some members of Congress about Iraq and it's important to make this point at
The outset
The President of the United States purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence
American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq go out every day into some of the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions
These brave Americans were sent into battle for a deliberate falsehood
Pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program
There is no denying that the President lied to the American people
This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety. It's also something I enjoy
It's one of the reasons I've stayed in the business and I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life
The President and his administration
Hey our country and hate the liberties for which we stand
They dwell in the shadows have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained by any standard of morality
The President of the United States is dishonest and reprehensible and none of us should want it any other way
Thank you very much
Thank you, Dick
1017 at 560 W.Q. I'm happy it wins the two here's our lineup today
We got the mad dog at two the power hour hank of the mad dog together one of those very rare days between four and five a second
No, the power hour everybody take a shower and then you got Hank solo with the world golf championships at the Ralph
I love that one promo that we're playing where it's like they're describing golf on a radio
That is really simulating craft for a cane hotline at seven and any can item midnight tonight
You know one thing since they blew out any case I'm more than I was before and very often hours when people might actually be awake
It's scary
Speaking of scary right on the hills of that channy bit Doug Thompson writes
Well, you're not gonna read that already because you got to get to this pool and they're gonna be a zygian
names that people want to put on the pool
Let's get a zygian zany
Zany collars today. I got a lot of an appalling like those. Yeah, those are my favorite and him too of course
Doug Thompson says George W. Bush and the looming shadow of Richard and Nixon
With each passing day George W. Bush's actions more closely mirror those of another monumentally failed president
Richard and Nixon tricky dick
Bush's performance Tuesday night trying to wiggle out of the escalating controversy over the politically motivated
Fireings of a US attorney's is just another example of Nixon reborn and a corrupt president trapped by his own lies and malfeasance
My refusing to let political guru Carl Rove and former White House council hearing admirers testify under oath before Congress
Bush is forcing a showdown that'll cripple is already weakened presidency
Yet Bush like Nixon reigns arrogant until the end determined to ignore the law political necessity or common sense
Given the lies on top of lies that the White House has told Congress over the past six years
There's no way either the House or Senate will accept unsworn off the record testimony for me the Rove or Myers
The Democratic leadership of Congress and a growing number of Republicans want both on the record under oath where they can face
Purgatory charges for the lies they will inevitably inevitably tell
An increasingly bipartisan anger toward the way the Bush administration conducts his business surface like a title
Wavy as today when the Senate voted 94 to 2
To revoke Bush's authority to replace US attorneys a growing number of Republicans no longer stand by their embattled and scandal-ridden
President and Bush like Nixon is fighting himself increasingly isolated from his own party and the American people
The Bush that appeared before the cameras Tuesday that was not the swaggering W. Ahold
But one of the look of a cornered animal wounded but defiant as
Young reporter writing about a constitutional crisis in 1974
I saw the same look in Nixon's eyes that he scrambled for political cover amid the growing Watergate scandal
Nixon like Bush did on a crumbling political base pet by as many lies and bots to tempt to cover up his misdeeds
Nixon released transcripts of White House conversations calling an extraordinary cooperation with Congress and its probe of Watergate
Last night Bush used pretty much the same words to describe the White House release of emails and other records on the attorney
Fireings history will forever define Nixon's failed presidency through Watergate and his fligrid attempt to subvert the Constitution
History will forever define Bush's failed president seat through the Iraq War debacle and as many attempts to subvert the Constitution
Both men violated their own to uphold the Constitution both failed to serve the people both broke the law one resigned in disgrace
The final chapter on the other remains unwritten
But we can be sure that the chapter when closed will reveal another sorted period in American history right?
Stug Thompson
I hope they don't come and get you too soon
They're probably trying to try to dance down right now. They got that IP address
They're right and I think they got the GP RS. They're like, you know, they're gonna shoe sell it
Hounds they got their dividing just like that that the boys got the BG boards for that boy Scott that we were treated to
455,000 hours of a cover John
I don't think it's done. It's just wait for the ABC movie of the week. I can't wait. Here's the poll today
And we already Chris about 832 on there aren't you really proud of that? Oh, I'm super proud 832
Most if you could be or I see I see let me read it the way it's written. Okay, cuz I didn't write I don't write these anymore
Anyhow if I could be somebody else for one day
I would be Hugh Heftar 250 see I hate to break
I know I know what you guys are driving at but you know the problem is Hugh Heftar is probably about 140 years old right now
It's probably as limp as a Chinese noodle and you're just you know, you have things for that a lot of good memories
I guess that's all you want is my address
Yeah, I probably got that too probably got like you know some people have bowls full of candy on the
Copy table. He's got bowls full of all that crap. He's got him like an a pes dispenser. He carries
Oh
They still make pes dispensers in that's way yes, they do I love that
The only problem with that is that when you're like a sugar holic like I've been almost all my life is it don't do it
You take that little dispenser like a like a little cigarette lighter like a little fag lighter
We'll fill it up with baby fill it up with peasant and you like eat the whole roll
Hugh Heftar 250 for I gotta be me 209. Oh, let's play that again. Now Sammy Davis here you go. Keep an eye out for Sammy
I gotta be me 209. That's just
Knowing this crowd that's particularly ridiculous Tiger Woods a hundred
Huh, and that's that because of his hot blonde wife is that what that's all about?
It's gotta be yes and his money
Well, there you go. It's not about combo. I'm proud that's why he's got that hot blonde wife. There's no question
I hate this pose. It's kind of like Wayne Greskey needle nose
I mean who the hell would want it get anywhere near him, but he's got a hot young blonde wife
There's a lot of money. I hate this pull 597 percent. That's a little bit too high if he acts me
Howard Stern 42 Bill Clinton 40 Neil Rogers 36
The only thing I could say about that is if you were me for one day you could be legendary
For a day or like the old TV game show queen for a day
George W. Bush 35
Anyone but who I am 29
Anybody but me 29
Wayne Heising a 17 Tom Brady is moving up the ladder fast man. They want Tom's action believe you me

Klingon and add-on. He's already up to 15 vote. He's right on Wayne's ass
Why would anybody want to be a win? Don't we want to add Bill Gates on there because of all his money?

This is just the this is kind of a skeleton list from our whoever sent this in over university dodge

Phil's presents the game's greatest scores
He was born Thomas Edward Brady Jr
And he grew to rule a new England dynasty three Super Bowl rings twice Super Bowl NDP
And a playoff resume akin to a first class ticket to Canton, Ohio
However his powers on the gridiron gives way only to his powers in the bedroom
For late in the 2006 season Tom Brady achieved the greatest back to back scoring feet in the modern era
First he impregnated sultry Hollywood starlet Bridget Moynihan
Then against all odds this heroic field general bedded and inseminated
lingerie Supermodel
Buncheon
In honor of his triumphs between the hash marks and between the sheets
We bequeath the laurels and regale among the games greatest scores number 12
Tom Brady
Nice 1046. How's Tommy doing on the pool? By the way, he's all the way up to 23 votes. He's right
I'm right behind anyone but who I am
Larry Kramer writes why do straights hate gays in the LA Times an 1872 year old gay man isn't hopeful about the future
It's a good article. I'm just gonna read it
Larry Kramer's founder of the protest group act up an author of the tragedy of today's gays today's gays
He says dear straight people
Why do you hate gay people so much? Gays are hated. Proof me wrong. Your top general does call us immoral
Marine general Peter Pace shimmer of the joint cheeses in charge of an estimated 65,000 gay lesbian troops
Some fighting for our country in Iraq
A right wing political commentator and colder gets away with calling a straight presidential candidate a faggot
Even gyrism killer of all people is making really tacky jokes about gay parents in his column
This I guess doesn't qualify as hate except that it's so distasteful and dumb often a first step on the way to hate
Senators help me rot in Clinton and Barack Obama try to duck the questions that paces big if he raised confirming what gay people know
That there's not one candidate running for public office anywhere who dares to come right on and equifically and say decent support of things about us
Gays shouldn't vote for any of them
There's not a candidate or major public figure who would not sell gays down the river
We've seen this time after time even from supposedly progressive politicians like Bill Clinton with his don't ask
Tell policy on gays in the military and his support of the hideous defensive marriage act
Of course it's possible that being shunned by gays will make politicians more popular
But at least we'll have ourself respect to vote for them is to collude with them in their uttered disdain for us
Don't any of you wonder why heterosexual treat gay so brutally year after year after year as your people take away our manhood our womanhood our personhood
Why even as we die you don't leave us alone
What can we leave our surviving lovers is tacked for more punitively than what you leave your legal surviving spouses
Why do you do this?
My lover will be unable to afford to live in the house we've made for each other over our lifetime together. This doesn't happen to you
Taxation without representation is what led to the revolutionary war gay people have paid all the taxes you have
But you have equality and we don't and there's no sign that this situation will change anytime soon
President Bush will leave a legacy of hate for us that will take many decades to cleanse
He has packed virtually every court and every civil service position in the land where people don't like us
So even with the most tolerant of new presidents
Gays will be unable to break free from this yoke of hate
Courts ruled against gays with hateful regularity and of course the supreme court is not going to give us our quality
And in the end so to speak it's from the supreme court that such equality must come if all of this isn't hate. I don't know what hate is
Our feeble gay movement confines most of its demands to marriage
But political candidates are not talking about and we're not demanding that they talk about equality
My lover and I don't want to get married just yet, but we want to be sure to be equal
You must know that gays get beaten up all the time all over the world
If someone beats you up because of who you are you're racer ethnic origin. That's considered a hate crime
But in most states gays are not included in hate crime measures and Congress is refused to include us in a federal act
Homosexuality is a punishable crime in the zygian countries as is any activism on behalf of it
Punishable means prison punishable means death the US government refused our request that a protest after gay teenagers were hanged in Iran
But it protested many other foreign
Cruelties who cares if a faggot dies parts of the Episcopal Church in the US are joining with the Nigerian Archbishop
Who believes gays should be put in prison?
Episcopalians whoever thought we'd have to worry about Episcopalians
Well whoever thought we'd have to worry about Florida a young gay man was just killed in Florida because of his sexual orientation
I get reports of gays slain in our country every week few of them even make the news
Few are prosecuted you consider it acceptable that 20,000 Christian youths make an annual pilgrimage to San Francisco
To pray for gay souls. This is not free speech. This is another version of hate
It's all one world of gay hate and it always was
Gays will realize that the more we become visible the more we come out of the closet the more we're hated
Don't those of you straights who claim not to hate us have a responsibility to announce the hate
Why is it socially acceptable to joke about girly men or to discriminate against us legally with constitutional amendments ban in gay marriage
Because we cannot marry we can pass on only a fraction of our estates
We don't have equal part out parenting rights and we can't live with a foreigner
We love who doesn't have government permission to stay in this country
These are the equal protections that the Bill of Rights for Finns for all of us
Why do you hate us so much that you won't permit us to legally love?
I'm almost 72 and I've been hated all my life and I don't see much change coming. I think your hate is evil
What do we do to you that's so awful?
Why do you feel compelled to come after us with such frightful energy to this somehow make you feel safer and legitimate?
What possible harm comes to you if we marry or our tax just like you or are protected from assault by laws that say
It's morally wrong to assault people out of hatred
The reasons always out for our religious ones, but certainly they're not based on the love all religions proclaim
And even if your objections to gays our religious why do you have to legislate them so hatefully make no mistake
Forbiting gay people to love her marry is based on hate pure and simple
You may say you don't hate us, but the people you vote for do so what's the difference?
Our own company's democratic process that clears us to be unequal which means in a democracy that our enemy is you
You treat us like crumbs you hate us and sadly we let you do it
I don't hate you. You go Larry. You're fair. What? I don't hate you man. Well, you're going too bad. Yes, you do
So I don't let me ask you well
Let me ask you one thing about you like it see
I'd like to hold you on the pole. They like our pole today although they don't I am just shocked
I mean this pole is so wide open you'd thought there'd be a zillion people that they would want to put on here
You know as opposed to the stupid thing last Friday well of all the stupid expressions. Yeah, well that was pretty good. Well, is all right
I mean, there's a lot of stupid expression that has a lot of stupid people and lots you know
922 on that pole none for George Rodriguez yet in Paul Allen's guts. He's got one
What nobody wants to be you? No question. No kidding trust. I think even I think even you probably was just gonna say that
Oh

I would be blank. I mean you'd think there's be a billion choices on there, you know like poopy combo
They've got away
Gene Rayburn things like that, you know Paul Lind
John Stockwell
WQ a-m hello
Good morning. You good morning, sir
Yeah, this is the guy that called a couple days ago with the look up racy
at question
about you know
Sleep with the features. I had just something else you guys want me want to check when by the way
I was right as if that was a comment
I just thought I mentioned it again
Couple days voice don't know from no godfather. What is it the only thing maybe
George didn't look at the script well. I'm a rough. I say if I'm my doctor from Miami. I don't try to talk to us big English
Michael Waxing racy to his wife got played in the casino, you know with the bingo and she took his hand
And she said hello Mr. Paul, what the hell is that?
Mr. Paul that's what she called him
He called him Mr. Paul when he said hello to him and the last kill the man being what this dates, you know
Okay, well, we'll find out. I know what he's talking about
No, I don't I don't think should I should a quote with the first one was good. Oh now. Let's see. Oh look at this
Bob Norman has new updated information on Joe Rose on his blog Bob Norman. You're a jackass. Okay, you're an idiot a jackass
It says Joe Rose has been called in the principles office now. Who's this uh two and from and whatever it's an email to me from
Someone who saw that on Bob Norman's blog and that central Joe Rose has been called in the principles office
NBC6 to explain what he said in the last week about the deserability of black women whom he distinguishes red bones and chocolates or as Ray
Negan would say chocolates
It's gonna be a chocolate no Orleans
Ray Negan knucklehead
He's meeting today with stationing say this was the yesterday station executive about the comments to me last Wednesday on his radio show on seven
I did a ticket according to Broward times supporter Elgin Jones who's dogging this case. He's dogganit
He's bird dogganit
Jones just now interviewed Larry McDaniel NBC6 vice president programming told him the station is looking at the matter that Rose was coming
The office to explain what he meant when he said on the area prefer his red bones or lightskin black women at chocolates and that he understand most black men feel the same way
I left a message with McDaniel the confirm it but I've nerd back from him
But we don't even know who this is this. Oh, this is Bob Norman stuff
While NBC6 is looking at the matter the tickets hiding under the bleachers on this story
It hasn't returned numerous phone calls emails from Jones asking for comment which reporter
Feeling you're left him a bit blistered when Tim hardaway made his comments about hating gay people on their station
They blasted at every where he said but in this case they know who can return a phone call probably because it's much to do about nothing
Bob Norman
Rumors are still rumbling that similar roses co-workers are upset about the comments
His boss as Jones happens to be a black woman
So he really stepped into it into a bucket of stuff
But should the former Ted NB can by NBC and were that often to be for being so idiotic? No, that would be wrong
For one thing is audience other than Attorney Jack Thompson apparently wasn't offended by it
Which is always the case Rose must not be real big in the black women demographic
But he should definitely be made to apologize publicly for being such an insensitive bonehead says
Bob Norman hey body out of apologize for being a bone and making a mountain out of a whole hill the idiot
Pakistan police in Faratia are hunting a man who dug up his father's two-year-old corpse and took it home in a hijacked
Andoans to try to bring him back to life all right

A girl's beloved dog in a grizzly nightmare written by Mary Lynn Smith and the Minneapolis St. Paul St. Archibune. This is a very sad story
Crystal Brown's world was turned upside down a month ago when Chevy her four-year-old Australian shepherd mixed didn't come home
What kind of a name is that for a dog anyway Chevy people made their dogs all kinds of stuff
Pretty stupid name
I told him everything and he never shared any of my secrets at crystal 17 who's had some trouble times in her young life
Chevy was her therapy dog and she leaned on him for comfort and support. This is a very sad story
Two weeks ago a gift wrapped box was left at the house where she lives with her grandmother in St. Paul's
Rice street area inside the box crystal was horrified to find her dog's head
This was so cruel crystal said this is one sick twisted person the incidents considered so shocking that the remains
Society of the United States announced it's offering a reward of up to 25 hundred buss for information
You have to an arrest and conviction
Homicide investigators are looking into the case because of the implied terroristic threat St. Paul police are in jingray said a
Terroristic threat I
Didn't realize that the beheading the dog was a right I guess everything could be terrorism couldn't yeah
You scared the hell out of me right now
This was extraordinarily heinous said the El Bartlett the Humane Society
Debbie Manjure for animal cruelty issues. I deal with hundreds and hundreds of cruelty cases each year when I read about this case
It took my breath away. It's horrible. He said
This case Bartlett said as far worse than a recent episode in Ash gosh, Wisconsin where a 49-year-old man
Decapitated to his kittens because they were annoying
Sending the dogs headed the teenager was a malicious act Bartlett said that level of the property is beyond belief surely brown
Crystal's grandma said that Chevy wandered off after she let him out one night mid-Fibre
Crystal peppered the neighborhood with missing posters and went door-to-door with two photos of Chevy and hopes that somebody had spotted him
She rode the bus countless times to the St. Paul animal shelter and called there thousands of times she said
I felt empty crystal said I couldn't talk to anyone who was my dog or was just me and him
And a dog named Boo
Well
Who did that?
Don't tell me very ugly guy too by the way. Mm-hmm. Because when you got it. Yeah. Yeah. That's right
What is no no no?
Here's a hint. It's a kind of dog Sorta
It is Sorta. It's a kind of nine. I don't know. Lobo. Oh
Lebia
Excuse me
Then Shirley Brown came home one day and found a box wrapped in red paper on her front steps with batteries taped to the box
Congratulations, Crystal notes said this side off batteries included and it's sick
Surely Brown placed the box on her granddaughters bedroom dresser. I was surprised and excited crystal said
I thought it was a gift for my cousin
She tore off the paper and ripped open the box inside. She found Valentine candy and a black garbage bag
And then she saw her dogs face
Crystal screamed and ran to the kitchen to find grandma is this my dog grandma? No, that's not my dog is it my dog? Mm-hmm
Grace said investigate is believe the case is an isolated incident and the suspect knows the family
We don't know what the motive would be Grace said. It's a terrible thing to do to somebody's pet
Anybody with information regarding the case? I mean, I well we're not gonna give out phone numbers for the same fault
Police Chevy crystal said was the best Frenchie ever had he was more patient than any person I ever met
That dog waited for years for me to get myself together
So crystal then of course began to cry and get shy and who can blame her
That dog didn't care what I did what I didn't do
But anyone did to me he didn't care about anyway. I just wanted to love me the way I loved him
Crystal's got a new puppy now another Australian shepherd that she's named diesel
The puppies know Chevy not yet anyway. Hopefully he'll be my best friend crystal said hopefully he'll be my guide through life crystal and diesel
Let's hope now let me ask you if crystal turns out to be a lesbian
With that make diesel a diesel. Oh, no, I don't even go there. Okay, well
I won't go there

Hello, I'd like to be Henry Barrow and sit some wine in the dolphin press box all day long. Okay, Henry and by the way
Put the food down put down the chow Henry
I wonder if he ever lost any weight that that was
I hate to say because Henry you know, we always liked him Henry's a good guy
But that was discussing that day he came in we hadn't seen Henry used to be the news director WI would do 100 years ago when we worked there
I was with a pretty good guy and he was like a little guy, you know
Kind of funny looking I didn't say that I was
Immediately looking for that thing in here and of course it only takes about two seconds. Oh
He's a little guy kind of funny look actually kind of very distinguished looking now would say when you say with a must-a-ash
That's right this thing which you know snapping always with the suit on you know the whole deal didn't look like a wine swilling drug at all
No, all he was and then he came into QAM there several years ago got a very very abriant and hot young daughter
What's he's not so young anymore, but brilliant nice nice young lady
But to make a long story short he had ballooned up to like you know, he was still like about four feet tall but weighed about 600 pounds
It was a disheartening to see that
But yeah, when you get a lot of free wine and the wine tasting then you get the cheese and the crackers and more wine and all other
Whatever just ballooned up, but that's what the business will do to you
It was just to take your insides and just twist them like twisted cookies. We do have that though. Don't we?
Twist the police. I got some right now

Here's what you wanted what you asked for mr. Johnson oh
Wait a minute. Oh, that was that I get in and hold it
Mark it is down
Oh
Well my broker's calling and he's telling me the market's falling now
We stand in my
And don't call it come and jump with me
My socks are fading even though I'm on some heavy trading
The payment I'm in
You don't seem all whipped up about that oh yeah
The house committee investing in the firing of U.S. Attorneys by the Justice Department authorize the issuing of subpoenas of top aids to
President Bush today in a voice vote. They stopped sure to visually subpoenas themselves
The motion passed to authorize the chairman of wishing subpoena said a spokesperson for our judiciary committee chairman John
Connures a statement on the authorization will soon be forthcoming. Well, there's swillery on your TV said oh
Interesting. Oh my gosh. He's got the personality of a dead boofo toe man. She is weak weak. Oh
God look at her she's like she looks like Larry King and drag all hunched up like that. But she wears suspenders
You think that wouldn't surprise me and she definitely ain't got any boobs. I'll say to that
The authorization provided for subpoenas to secure testimony to hearing and to obtain documents from these individuals as well
As unre-dacted documents
Unredacted from the Department of Justice and White House pursuant to the committee's investigation
But a beep bit a boop about a subpoenas for the following individuals will be covered by the authorization decals
Samson Carl Rove Harry admirers William Kelly and Scott Jennings
About a beep bit a boop bit about we will not necessarily issue the subpoenas immediately send aid in the email to raw
Story we're trying to do what we can to avoid that but the vote will offer the possibility the possibility that the White House will definitely choose to stone wall and slow walk the investigation
But a beep bit a boop but a boop but a boop. In other words, how many times did they have to lie before they all wind up and jailed together?
How much more of this BS do we have to listen to before everybody gets a free gigantic shak-tobody on and gets laid
That's what we all want to know. Let's get to the important stuff. Now what's this thing you just sent me here?
Filthy perversion. It is oh good
Wine bath for the nads mud pack for the sack pleasures heavenly a pledges heavenly pleasure
I wine back for the nads and a mud pack for the sack
Like I kind of a ring to it doesn't it? It does
Japan's ever inventive sex industries latest innovations in the action of the facial a mud pack for the penis
According to spa whatever publication that is spa
A 30s of our recent years taking a harder line on the flesh trade and other little play on words a very clever
Herburell this is on the MSNBC website by the way
So you think that it would be much less to suggestive and much less grotesque in which case we wouldn't care
Authorities have in recent years taken a harder line on the flesh trade prompting operators to come up with an increasing
Variety of services aimed at providing pleasure but circulating the long arm of the law
Well, how can you have any pleasure if you don't have a long arm
Right the mud pack for the penis which follows a wine bath for the go nads is part of an Italian style aesthetic treatment offered by a
Tokyo based service called the arrow money
Sounds to not the sounds those sounds Japanese to me sounds Italian huh? Adamani
Sounds so schmaltsy a whole lot of operations similar to ours bring up an insure term
We need to provide a service nobody else was offering and this was it the Adamani boss tells spa
Our sales point is that we also offer variations including having the service performed by multiple workers groups of two or three women
Or he can have it performed by a shy woman or another one who'll be talking dirty while she's doing it
Oh, what the shia
one
The arrow money's I'm out of shia woman who's talking dirty
The arrow money's boss as the service began with a motto of providing health and beauty to the willian anus
Yeah, that sounds real Japanese doesn't
Willianus I do that guy what time will you with one of you the service involves using a hotel sink or face washing basin
Fill you with warm water and wine try the wine
This is aimed at improving the circulation instead of inserting the face in there and however the client places their bottom in the bowl
Allowing the penis and anus to be stuck in the studs of their
Semoye
Oh come on that's French no kidding. No, it's Japanese
Spine notes that the washing is performed by at least one woman who the Adamani insist must be in her 20s or 30s at the oldest
once the basic
Basin finished as finished the genitals are swathed in a chunk of mud supposedly to cleanse the skin
Once they're completely covered the woman or a woman providing the service then they show their handiwork so to speak
Oh, wait a minute. I can't read this
Well, I'll read it until the client reaches climax or what spot calls the ascent to heaven. Yeah, well that sounds odd about
Discribable that sounds very sexual to me is what it sounds like
Hmm sound like some kind of a whole house to make it is what it sounds like. I thought there was like something really uh, you know
What different gonna happen? It's just sound like you know
Just just a different way of achieving the same old means you're all the way. Oh sitting sitting in the sink is something to think

Wish a lot of people would like to see a show these days with some you know some celebrity who would tinkle on the panel
But anyway, no thanks. That's not much that especially for you
That's what I'm here for and don sure what put them on here. Are you crazy person or what honey? Are you crazy?

Whoever the hell he is the god your breasts are beautiful several days ago
I commented briefly on some recent statements that have been made by some members of congress about Iraq and it's important to make this point
At the outset
The president of the United States
Purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence
American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq go out every day into some of the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions
These brave Americans were sent into battle for a deliberate falsehood
pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program
There is no denying that the president lied to the American people
This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety
It's also something I enjoy
It's one of the reasons I've stayed in the business and I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life
The president and his administration hate our country and hate the liberties for which we stand
They dwell in the shadows have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained by any standard of morality
The president of the United States is dishonest and reprehensible
And none of us should want it any other way
Thank you very much
Some of these were going to be a click of leading term with everything in justice
For what we stand up to stand on this young Ponzi. Whatever you were saying right
So what was that deal that we had just before the atop of the hour?
There's something about anybody want to uh

epitome of desperation

Clarence. She's called the voicemail

Pretending to be a producer and it's got to be his wife or his daughter or something like that because he's in the background

but I'm deluding myself.
Bob Fattrakis and Harvey Wasserman write, in a bull move to restore treacherous elections in Ohio,
Ohio's newly elected secretary of state Jennifer Brunner has requested the resignation of all four members of the Cairoga County Board of Elections.
The two Democrats and two Republicans were formally asked to resign by the close of business on March 21, which sounds like today.
Cairoga County includes the heavily democratic city of Cleveland, Brunner's a Democrat who was elected to Ohio as a secretary of state of November 2006.
felony convictions have also resolved in 18-month prison sentences for two employees of the Cairoga B.O.E. as a result of what the county prosecutor in the case calls,
the ringing of the outcome in the recount following the 2004 presidential election.
Further problems surfaced in the conduct of Cairoga County's May 2006 primary, in a wake of which Michael Hu executive director of the county's Board of Elections recently also resigned and did.
Intended in the shake up in Ohio's biggest county reflects a widening storm surrounding the outcome of the 2004 presidential election and the conduct of elections over all the nation's most pivotal state.
Among those Brunner's answer to resign is Cairoga County Board of Elections chairman Robert Bennett, who chairs Ohio as Republican party.
Bennett responded to Brunner by saying that he refused to resign. He's placed the blame for the May 2006 primary problems on private voting machine vendors, including die-bold.
Bennett claims the ringing of the 2004 presidential recount was caused by the Cairoga County prosecutors office according to Columbus Dispatch.
To make a long story short, the election was stolen. Anybody here? No. Any interest? No. No. Well, we already know that. Any anybody here give a crap? No. No.
56670560. That's why it's pointless for me to sit here and read that whole entire thing. It's pointless. Right.
Even you say that. That's right. They just don't care. What's that got to do with dancing with the stars? And this poll here looks like it's frozen. I could be wrong. Yeah, 1048.
Are we still on the air? Are we getting ready to do a Marlon game or what? One, oh, four, eight. It's been stuck there for like, I don't know.

We got a new reality. I have no idea what's going on. I have like an out of body experience. I'm going to go out and lay on the patio here for a few minutes during the next hour. WDQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, I said a question for you. You can hear both spots. WDQAM. Hello.
WDQAM. Hello. I fell as great show. How's it going? Okay. So I just got back to a list of the radio. Did you resolve that? Because I think you guys had a late night recording of the early show, something like a triple cast or something that I was asking about before. Then we resolve what? You know, the guy said that you played recording of the show later. But what does that mean? Did we resolve it? Like there was some kind of a dilemma going on?
What does that mean? I don't know about it a little, but I just wanted to find out if you guys clarified that. Clarify this. Yeah, exactly.

Hey, I got a lot of. I'm serious. I'm not joking. A thousand 48. How is that possible? We went nine minutes without another vote on the poll.

How do you know that? Well, I don't know. People on the radio have a fake name.
All we heard was from some broad that keeps calling and talking about Don Sherwood. That doesn't mean he's still alive. She can be say Abe Lincoln.
I got a voicemail from Don Sherwood. You did? How long ago? Like last month? Yeah.
Don. Yeah. Say what? What did he? What is he wants? What's he doing on the show? He wants to muscle in on the show.
What does that mean? Sit it on the show? What does that mean? Sit it on the show? I want to sit in a chair. He wants to be your sidekick.
Yeah, kick this. Okay. Back down. Anthony says your biggest fan. Anthony who has facts before and whatever.
How about putting Paraseltan onto this pool? No. Anthony says I think it would be a lot of fun to be here.
Well, how much dressing up like her Anthony and see what everybody says and get a needle nose like her.
So Anthony or biggest fan? Hey, Anthony, get some help before it's too late.
So we did get a big chunk of votes given on the pool in between something happened.

I hate to say it. But with that, I'm going to say you hate to say you don't hate to say it.

We got one in 5-6.
We got two in the other.
I'm ready like that.
I just went of our technical to people who are here.
And despite the fact we ran out of space or whatever the story is, he's peddling now.
Does nobody's peddling?
Space.
5-6-7-0-5-60.
We got an hour to kill.
See, I think that we ought to have the ball games every day.
These people talking about tapes.
Let's play tapes of yesterday's ball game.
We kind of had the pregame show staring 11 minutes ago.
I could be already a third of the way to Woodbine for Christ's sakes.
I could be on the way to lose my ass today.
5-6-7-0-5-60.
See, that was a great format we had Monday for however long we were on.
A couple of hours in it yesterday.
We managed to squeeze.
It took a little bit of an incredible amount of kick into the pantaloonies and stuff like that.
And then today it's like, oh geez, we can't do this.
They don't look.
They ain't got it, okay?
You cannot take 400 pounds of chicken droppings and turn it into a freaking sauce-verage steak.
You can't do it.
And that's south Florida, man.
I'm ready to take the whole phone like I did on a Toyota in Monday.
Take the whole Aspirators and take it on the balcony as long as I don't hurt anybody.
And just drop it over the edge.
I have some guy downstairs like the cons.
He airs for something.
Yeah.
Keep the street clear.
Maybe put some cones up.
That's a good idea.
Just take all anything he has to do with his phone and just dump it over the edge.
And have him hold the microphone down there too so we can hear the crash.
WQAM.
Hello.
Bill.
Yes, sir.
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Okay.
Hey, I want to ask you something.
What do my calls, it says you would boss Vegas yesterday?
You said what?
I said what?
I said you would boss Vegas.
You call yesterday?
Yeah.
And you call them if you're here.
It doesn't get along with you guys.
Rikies?
No, that's one that brings you guys to your guys' breakfast.
Char-hut.
Char-hut.
The reason why they're not going to be speaking to you people anymore.
You got poorly in the back and they fear poorly.
They fear what it's going to do to their bottom line.
Portally?
That's the truth.
Yeah, that's the big point.
Rotundo in the back.
That's the guy.
Oh, is that it?
He's not in the back.
He's in the front.
Right.
He's in the front.
You like it like that?
WQAM, how?
It makes it easier to maneuver.
QAM.
I have a question for George.
Yes.
George.
Right here, man.
Who?
Lily Allen, I am your wine her.
Who?
Lily Allen, I am your wine her.
It's the same.
It's from London.
I don't know who they are.
Lily Allen, how's that?
Because that's one I've heard of.
That's the one you heard of?
You haven't heard of Amy Wine her?
No.
She's good, Jeff.
She sounds like Erica Biden.
Okay, boring.
Boring, boring.
WQAM, hello.
No, don't listen to other people.
You're awesome.
However, Canada sucks.
Okay, thank you.
WQAM, hello.
Yes, sir.
Hi.
Why don't you let you guys know?
I'm not going to be because of this wireless car that you have on the end for your laptop.
I'm able to listen to you.
You have to be in a random way, sir.
Keep up the good work.
Keep up the good work.
Oh my god.
This is really something.
It's a fly opener if it's anything.
Love it.

All they know, Hugh Hefner, Hugh Hefner, Hugh Hefner.
Look at all the broads he did.
Yeah, again, he's 145 years old, okay?
He's probably got a bag.
They probably got, you know, keeping him alive with tubes in his nose.
301.
I got to be me, 256.
And of course, listening to these people on the phone, it's obvious why.
Tiger Woods 125.
Because he's got that hot blind wife.
I hate this pool.
88.
It keeps going up 7.9%.
I don't blame you.
Howard Stern 40, 70, or just 46.
I'm writing how he's asked.
Bill Clinton 46.
George W. 45.
Tom Brady 39.
Tommy's climbing the ladder fast.
Anybody but who I am 33.
Bill Gates 19.
Wayne Heisinga 18.
Hillary Clinton at 9.
Nine guys want to be Hillary.
They want to be that macho, that butcher.
George Rodriguez, look at that.
You're all way up to 8.
You're writing a Hillary's house.
Maybe they want to work with you.
You pass Paul Allen like he was sitting out in a prone position, 7 for Paul Allen.
Shaquille O'Neill, Shaq's got 6.
Brady Quinn 5, Ron Jeremy 4, Vanessa Perredease 4, and Peter North, the old straight shooter 3.
Or a problem with that is Peter District 145.
He can still bring it though.
He can still bring it if he catch my drift.
Love 115 votes.
He can still bring it and he can still send it.
WQAM, hello.
Neil, I would really love to see the one I ever do to you guys.
Yeah.
Put that on your list.
Because what did I ever do to you?
WQAM, hello.
Oh, yes.
Neil.
Yeah.
Do you have a list of WSDR?
Or what?
NPR?
No.
Because they have an interview with the lay on yesterday that would make your choice.
Sure.
I don't want to hear about Tom Delay.
I don't want to hear that he was on yesterday morning on the day of the show.
I don't want to hear that he was on the meet the press with Tim Russell.
I don't care about Tom Delay.
Get it through your brain, OK?
I don't freaking care.
The fact that they keep bringing this criminal and sticking on the air all over the place.
And you people keep the law.
Listen to it.
What is wrong with you?
I don't think we're ever going to discuss politics on the show again.
I think since we're making up all these new rules this week for everything, for every part of my life,
let's make up that one too.
No more.
Until at least the turn of the year.
Until we have an election coming.
Till there's something we're talking about.
All these great political experts out there, they had Tom Delay on NPR.
And this one really ripped him an ass about you.
And who cares?
That's like saying that they brought 400 pounds of elephant crap on it.
And put it on the table.
I said it smelled bad.
Wow.
Even in the Bible they never had revelations like that, baby.
Man.
Is that heavy duty or what?
That's duty.
WDQA and Hello.
God these colors suck.
WDQA and Hello.

How does it remove the middle finger?
Yeah.
And I don't know what happened to Al.
He's not here.
Yeah.
He lost everything, man.
Oh, that's too bad.
All right.
Good show, Neil.
Thank you.
Okay, sir.
Okay, good luck.
Bad call, good show.
Poor Al, man.
That's what we, let's get Al on here and see if he can like, go to a slander of few people.
I hate the irony.
There you go.

Yeah.
This is your all-powerful and friendly vice president.
See, he, one ton of most good thing.
I'm too, give you a better understanding here.

There's only something you do with the door, as always.
You were not lying into a water.
He was the detigling is all along.
I was a close relative to Zatamu, chained in the inshundra.
Oh, fair, boop, fair.
They called me uncle, okay.

Yes, mommy.
It was I.
It was I.
It was also I who sent the ant's rats.
It was I who sunk the beach mark.
It was I who outed battery play.
Not Bob, no back-o-car road.
Yeah, nothing to do with it whatsoever.
It was all me.
It was also I who killed Shundra Levy in the blonde in a hoop.
It was I who was the mastermind behind the mannequin idol.
It was I who hired me to cross me to read the headlines despite every time I speak in bed of it.
Oh!
It was I who played saturated fads and shiko sticks.
What else can I tell you?
Okay, okay.
It was I who invented skinny jeans.
Of which no one of questionable girls can wear.
Is it my phone time of my jungle lotion?
Oh, boy, that's your torture to me.
I have been dead for three years.
I don't sure when.
And so, one sixteen and five sixty-watt QAM.
So anyhow, I ever whether you saw this, whether you have the copy that I get with the disc every week from chicken neck.

Wow.

Oh, boy.
And never would we look at one another.
I thought you were a child.
I thought you were a child.
You were a child.
I thought you were a child.
And all the bad things I've done in history.
All the wrongs may only be where I know.
Where you've got time to wish to make it all.
Let's go.
Oh!
This is the first time I've ever shown you.
And darling, you've been sharing all this with me.
Let me tell you now.
When I was a child, I thought I'd wait.
And I was a child.
And I was a child.
Oh!
Like a religious experience.
Great.
When that incredible, I like it.
It had kind of a cow-soul's flavor to it, which I like.
The cow-piles?
Yeah.
You know, no.
Crime sheeners.
It really is a crime sheeners.
She had two big hits up on her roof and it could be where I love.
Which if he has the other one, it could be where I love.
I may just have an accident on the floor right in the room.
Oh, yeah.
In the studio, huh?
We'll find it for you.
Wow.
When that piece of something would happen, you'll revelation me before they stick my fat old ass in the ground.

I'm just one of those guys now.

Oh!
Cut the crap.
You got money to lose today.
You can't do that.
Yeah, like I said.

It seems to me I could be wrong, but I love you guys.
We've had a real obsession with that.
Let them ask.
You know what I'm saying?
Let them ask.
That's all you know from it.
Let them ask.
Let them session.
Get over it, okay?
Come off with something a little bit new and more original.
Instead of using my old tried and true material from 100 to last 100 years.
Let them help.
It damn, they're killing them.
That's right.
It's Lewis Knowsworth's hat.
Let them.

I've got to play drums with a hook.
Very well.
Yeah, it sounded pretty good to me.
He's got a very prominent there.
Okay, well, good old Captain Hook.
Sit out in there.
There's a little crying chain in Stryvia.
Now we're making some real progress, baby.
Now we're really kicking ass ancient style.
The drummer for the crying chains had a hook.
WQAM, hello.
Neil, are you still thinking of Carl?
Yeah.
You got one?
Yes.
Okay.
Just checking.

Okay, Sidney Crosby.
Sidney Crosby.
What's the big red hockey player this guy?
Oh, I'm sure he's got millions of dollars.
And he's getting whatever the hell he wants, you know?
When you're a big job like that, no matter how grotesque your schnauzes

Make no mistake about that.
He shoots, he scores, you know what I'm saying?
It's my drift.

WNQAM, hello.
Where's Pete?
He's from Pepper Pine, center.
WNQAM, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Cut a call for Neil.
Let me say it again.
This is Neil, sir.
That's fine, Neil.
That was quick.
What's the question?
Why don't you keep pushing the button on that rectum bit that he pushes?
He's getting kind of trite.
That he pushes?
Yeah, obviously when he says rectum.
Well, who's he?
Wait a minute, who's he?
Your colleague, yes, he is in the Miami end.
He's not pushing any button.
I'm doing it right here.
He don't push any buttons, okay?
He's putting the button on your dumb call.
Why does he keep pushing the button?
He's blaming you for that.
It's getting kind of stale as what he says.
Well, maybe if you do a little cleansing, you might help.
I've got a bidet.
Yeah, there you go.
Little body wars couldn't hurt.
There are two QAAM, hello.
Yeah, two thumbs up for that saw, Neil.
When you like that?
Excellent.
There you go, excellent.
This guy actually liked.
Usually when I play music, which I try to avoid, like to play,
and I wasn't doing it to kill time, it's just that he put it on the visc.
And I was just so overwhelmed by the fact he put it on there.
Overwhelmed, emotional, like almost in tears, almost.
Do you think it's that good?
I liked it.
I liked it a lot.
Well, thank God I've never heard it since maybe then.
Since you were up on the roof.
Right.
WQA, hello.
Yeah, I knew it.
Since the roofer is around the roof.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Yeah, huh?
WQA, hello.
Don't mind me.
I'm just pooping.
WQA, hello.
Yeah, when I called you earlier today and asked you to play that bidet.
You called me earlier today?
About the automobile thing.
You're calling again a second time today.
What do you try to tell us, sir?
I have no luck.
You asked me why I didn't say hello, Neil and all that.
Right.
Well, everybody else said that he why should I?
Because it's a common courtesy.
When you pick up the phone and you call somebody, you say hello, Schmengrick.
Hello, Schmengrick.
In your case, look in the mirror.
You'll see Schmengrick, okay?
You'll see Schmengrick, Schlemazel, Schmengeggi, Schmuck, all of these things.
All of these things.
That's what you'll see.

miserable and unhappy. And those around you, love 158 votes on the pool. We need, you
know, we could still do it. What do you think, Chris? People really want to be nice. We
can do it. Nice. Yeah, that would be nice. I think tonight, I guess, I don't know.
Depends on how long I stay with mine. How much I lose. I was going to say we're going
to watch Borat. The one is actually, I can watch with English. And what's the difference
between this one you sent me now? Because they have one like Portuguese subtitle or something?
Yeah, something. This one has the real deal DVD English subtitles, which is about half
the jokes are actually subtitled. And it's great. And also like all the scenes that didn't
make it into the theater version because of length, you know how that goes. Yeah.
Bing bang bang bang bang. Bing bang. Bing bang bang.
Bing bang bang.
Very nice. Very nice. So I'm going to watch it because that thing kind of threw me any
way we need 42 votes in 27 minutes. That's less than two a minute to get to 1200. But
I think this thing is frozen again. I'm just starting to get a little bit suspicious.
is Eric I think is dibbling with us today you know. Don't you it's still stuck
there 11.58 I keep refreshing it I know we got a shot and it's still every time I
refresh it it still stays there so maybe nobody is listening you think that's
possible we have had 21 drop out. 11.59 what 11.59 we have had 21 drop outs on
our on our thing I'm gonna send our my space one of my phone oh we got a few
drop outs on our my space make no mistake about that and you know I never
checked I double-checked a see if Christopher did his research and
rechecked it on sure what thing and he never followed up on it you know all you
wanted to do is give me to play a old needle again which I didn't and that was
the end of that you know I'm easy I'm easy Chris 1160 votes they're coming in
by the ones say we're gonna need 40 votes in 26 minutes and I do the math as
they say and that's another one we should add on a pull-ass right to do the math
right I mentioned it but I don't think we ever put it on there that is so
freaking annoying 11.61 they're just trickling in by the ones I think we better go
back to the bedtime story starting tomorrow I think I chased the entire
audience and when I think the audience chased the audience away here's a
facts while we're waiting for the votes to pour up and you'll see there I'll
click on one of these times and be a big chunk they'll come through for us you'll
see 11.63 see there's two there's a pair oh what a pair here's a note from
Frank and Melbourne he says a note on Judge Larry Court of the Pottsmoker we
talked about that story yesterday I had a family location from a court a few
years ago my ex had taken our child out of state to find a court order not to do
so I managed to find who we get her served she and her new hubby show up he's a
rich eye doctor that holds surgical patients my argument was to have the court
take the child from the ex-dude who are having fled the state and not allowing
visitation according to Florida case law court a should of switch custody
instead after a morning of arguing courted a Claire's a lunchtime break we all
leave but the judges an hour late he claimed to have had a flat tire but the
ex-new husband were gone the judge told me let him go for a funeral the result
was they and my child let the court's jurisdiction and even if court had ruled
for me my daughter was gone took a bribe had a flat had a talk who knows justice
forget about it says Frank he says yes I'm gonna turn you this new show every day
thank you Frank and Melbourne and I'm so sorry that you know Judge Court had a
lot of smoke a big fat one or whatever he was doing how do you like that huh
don't freaking judge court hang his hands I'm seriously different never wanna
be this a different man forget don't do as I do do as I say that's the American
effing way that's what they're that's what everybody tells you don't do as I do
do as I say they talk you like all of religious freaks give you a big strong
advance and they're all doing anything if it's still warm they're doing it if
it's a warm blow-up dollar doing it even if it's lukewarm or if it's like
luke and Matthew 1171 we need 29 votes in 24 minutes that's barely over one
minute now don't you think a high-priced legendary show like this ought to be
able to do that okay but it's just I keep refreshing and ordinarily there's

ourselves either that or Eric is a didliner and then all of a sudden he'll open
the thing up again there'd be like 240 at the end we need 28 votes in 23
minutes on this show that should be a no-brainer to get to our twelve hundred
to get to our goal to make us feel good about this show is in spread of these

was a grasser that's what I call a Michigan state it was a grasser a
stretch court in health and he likes his grassers in fact I left my watch and
my grassers right out there that's I'm gonna ruin the story I don't want to tell
the whole story because I've told it a hundred times on the air but that's a
grasser is what it is and I mean I guess I do have to explain it because maybe
maybe maybe that's just a word that the kids made out how do I know you know when
you're in college your people kids make up all kinds of crap because there's
no way you're there for to be a smart ass and does not to learn anything I
didn't learn a smart thing and like I've told you a million times it's a damn
good thing that I'm trying to think if there was anybody in my I'm I for in my
dorm in each hall hall as you can see if there was any guy that really looked
even close to good and I went no they were all ugly because they would have
been pretty all though as a matter of fact they did catch a couple of guys they
yeah and my on my floor I don't remember who they were and they were ugly too
but they cut a couple of guys in the sack doing hankies thank you with each
other how do you like that or her yeah how do you like that kind of guy and of
course you know can you imagine having to to live that down afterward oh boy
wow I would have changed underwear and changed dormitories and changed schools
and changed the planets I mean that of course this is back in early in 60-61
hundred years ago I was in college and you know what a bunch of you see there's
nothing more vicious more rotten than kids as you know little kids especially
but of course college kids because they're smart asses in college you know right
oh yeah and so you've got somebody that you found out is a gay or is like well
whatever you know or likes to wear ladies underwear or whatever it is and you
catch him in the act of putting on the ladies underwear or in the act of you
know hankies spank you with each other in the dorm room while I think you know
when you think you'd lock the freaking door maybe the roommate came in you know
that's probably got to be a very unsettling sound when you hear the key in the
door oh probably if they were like in the heat of passionate in here the key
in the door that's right probably a lot of any breathing going on you know so
you don't hear that key in the door and only for doing it all and the door
squeaks open and oh no what's going on in here what are you laughing about
yeah that would be can you imagine anything more rather not well not good in
fact all these years I kind of I don't know I didn't block it out like and oh
we got 1194 we're gonna make our 1200 votes let's hear it all right this is
almost like a crazy but we can go Monday we can go well whenever the hell it was
remember that day when we got 1500 and some votes during the show back when we
still had an audience remember that but when you come right down to it I mean
what's the big deal of 90 we don't even have the 1200 yet so that was a
premature evaluation but but up until I started telling the story about the
grasser in fact I'm flicking this and it's still up 94 that would be pretty
embarrassing if we don't get the other six votes so some of you who voted me
for please do it again to make sure we get it because otherwise I would have
gone through all that effort to play all it's still a 94 I think Eric is got
his foot on a break this is a very spastic day here on this
internet you know 1195 now there's one oh the big news on CNN grassfire in
Miami oh my God I showed W Channel 7 WSVN now the rest of the world can
understand how depressing it is to live in Miami grassfire I wonder where the
hell it is they're having a grasser and it got out of there were having a
