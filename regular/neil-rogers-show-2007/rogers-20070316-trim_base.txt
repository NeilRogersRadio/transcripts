This has Timmy hardaway. He'll tell you know Timmy good old Timmy. He may I hate gay people
He wore a jockstrap old Timmy, you know, this is the jockstrap station, baby
I was trying to print out the thing that very jackass wrote this morning about how QA must have been very intensive
Disgressions to try to get the dolphin broadcast back and of course the ticket is still you know trying to
Hang on they're squeezing it. Well, it's hope they do and Mr
Of systemry maddets says he wants to be back on the broadcast if we get the games. Oh right
Nothing I mean there's nothing really and I don't think Jim Sarni writes a regular column for the Sun sent no anymore
If you google Jim Sarni on a sent cell website it says what?
What who yeah
And then you tell me I want to find out what he wrote and they'll say
Well, anybody want to know what that old toad wrote but in any rate
It's a Friday nothing wrong with that March 16th and we're all saying panties that we survived the eyes of March yesterday
Nothing really special happened nobody got nobody got knife. I guess today nobody I know stabbed stabbed in the back probably somebody did somewhere but
A lot of that stuff going on going on here the drilling yeah, I do I was just gonna ask you what's all that racket vibrating it
I don't know what they're telling us man. I thought it was college hoops. We got tennis going on
Maybe we got a real racket a Q.I.M. Which of course that's what I got a real racket
Anyway, here's the poll from yesterday. Well, I'll tell you
Charlie B. Oh first I got to tell Chris. They're happy 30th birthday Chris somebody on the
Myspace want to meet a wish it's not the Chris you know or I know but it's some
And also they want to be say hey Chris you're fair like that see how I have bled we have 268 friends in Myspace
I have a little advice by the way about Myspace a little a little bit. You know what I mean? Yeah
Well, it knows if it all depends on what you're doing on there if you're just dealing around that's fine
If you're looking to like meet somebody to make a friend or an acquaintance or like get late or something like that
If the other person on there is evasive and doesn't want to give you very much information like even the
Town that they live in or much less like a last name or a phone number something like that
I would just take it with a green assault and probably like delete them immediately. You know if they don't want to uh
That that's just my suggestion
You know what I'm saying what do you say?
Because they're just too many a it's an anonymous thing. It's an anonymous
Who's
Makes people are forthcoming anyone to give you like a real name and this and that that's anyway Charlie B
He was very apologetic
Yeah
This is a good pull somebody said and this is great
But what are you apologizing child? So some of your pull suck? That's okay. A lot of our pull suck too
We're getting paid to do this stuff
So just because the one yesterday was weak. I mean we did wind up with the whole bunch of votes. How many like um, let's see
1400 all right
Today's pull is terrible to a court of the audience. I think today's pull is fine
And yet I hate this pull is when the hands down your pants. It's not even close way out in front of all the rest
I hate this pull because the flow is just full of hate and you know what I understand
If you're trapped in a outdoor septic tank and outdoor assess pool like stuff, but in actually you're probably going to be a little more
Hostile than the run of the mill schmuck running around on the loose
This is a good pull somebody said in this one might be good for uh front for uh what what day is it for over the weekend?
Well, no, don't tell me that this other one is gonna stay up all the way over the weekend
See I get ahead of myself on these now. I realize the one that's on it right now is the Friday pull it stays up there through the weekend
I might change this on I don't know
Sooner sooner rather than later
When Neil show ends early because of marlin's baseball I
Listen every second of the baseball broadcast smash my radio with a hammer sitting in dark room and pout
Taking that because I'm usually exhausted after Neil show anyway. Play my best in the LCDs
Switch to the sports hole station across the street work on my fantasy league roster
Pray that the marlin's via slow painful death listen to rush listen to magic listen to power
Turn off my radio until it's time for Neil's next show or read the bible there you go
Pray for us to come back when that marlin game comes on man
Well, you know what I haven't gotten any assistance on because I'm trying to get some Chicago tourist information
Here for a friend of mine who's making this first trip. I haven't been there in about 400 years. I love Chicago
It's a great city
But the pizza I asked this the other day and the pizza thing. I'm not getting any uh
Yeah, I mean you can go online and I've done that
And you can read all those reviews, but I'd like to you know hear from like the living and breathing person
Maybe a fax would be good. Okay. Maybe we'll get some calls. I you know, I have no
Because the list that I've got Lou Melnotties, which has been there for like five generations
I guess Jordanos which is uh
Geordonos is great
But I'm told that the lines are like around a block all the time to get in that joint
Geno's east pizza. We know all which everybody rates real high
But I'm told that pizza. We have dwee which is the same one in rock cross-free this much better
And Chicago pizza oven grind remember we had to call about that the other day. Yes. It's like pizza in a bowl
Pizza in a bowl. Hmm. So that's the list I've got so far. Maybe we'll get some advice on that from some people who maybe from Chicago or whatever
You know will you all the most of the Midwest people around the west coast of Florida?
We've obviously got a few out there, but nevertheless. Oh today is the right day today is Friday right
I want to double check before are we this today's Friday
BSO deputies will conduct the UI saturation patrols tonight

Tonight till 5.30 in morning 5.30 morning like come out and just have a wild blast. Okay. Here's the um
Full result from yesterday
Come to QA and hello. Hey, oh good morning. I'm from
I'll be down here for eight years. Rosadis is a real good spin truck
Rosadis Rosadis is good at the franchise with a spin truck and then you when you were in Chicago down by
Comiskey market stuff. There's no home run in pizza is very good too. What is it?
Home run in pizza home run in yeah, but those are very
Pizza from Chicago. Okay, I'll run right in thanks a lot. Tell us here you go right off the bat
That's why I punched that up because he was like a huh
You knew that although we weren't at Comiskey park we were a wriggly field but never less than since ones on north side and ones on the south side
But nevertheless home run in and Rosadis sounds a real small-sie man sounds a good
Too bad I can't eat no pizza, you know
And even if I got one probably the pizza thief would come and steal it unwittingly
Here's the pull from yesterday and again. This was a Charlie B's. I guess and I don't was this one of his
I don't know what he's apologizing for. Of course he's got plenty to apologize today's whatever
Anybody that works as feverishly as that guy to send us like a half a dozen pulls almost every day
Don't be apologizing for nothing Charlie. That's right. What I mean? We don't look a pull horse in the mouth
That's for show
Embarrassingly I don't know and then we got a bunch of other blanks to fill in. I know the answers to all these
970 69.2% great Americans who know their crap who think they do I hate this pull
153 10.9%

At every day I can smell it man
You can smell the hate in the year and I just asked myself what uh is it all about why why why is there so much
Why are these people so filled with nausea and disgust and just hatred and content for anything and everybody else
Anything that's breathing anything that's even the blades of grass
They like go out of their way to step on not just step on the grasses. They're walking
But like you know crunch it in with the shoe, you know like you're putting out a cigarette. Yeah, how people do that?

She's working for power now. Who is scurrying? She made a comeback. Yeah, that's right
I'm just saying all of all the Greg's buddies that like she's over power because he's over there now
That's right. She's over in the side of building to be close to Greg

Let's see
Just about air week ass connected with sports love to use expression he or she is in control of their own destiny
That's that's not good. It says well if one could control destiny wouldn't be destiny would it?
Well, yeah, it says maybe the dumbest sports expression could be a subcategory or separate pool. Oh, yeah
He takes it to the hole well. I open up some avenues. I guess I do you
Last night my uncle Tony joined my wife and kids at the olive tree restaurant now my uncle Tony
He's an Italian cuisine connoisseur if it ain't perfect
He's not happy now
I couldn't believe it when he said the chicken parmesan was the best he'd ever tasted
Plus he kept raven about the free breadsticks and all the salad you could eat my uncle Tony
Recommends you come down to the olive tree because when you're here you're family and by that
I mean you know in the family like last night this couple was done eating right and they were
Walking out and my uncle says where you going and they say we're heading not to see a movie and Tony says huh, huh
Not until you head down to the four eighth club and put a hit on a
Pobo moroni and these people freaked out right they start laughing because they didn't realize my uncle was serious
And then once you eat at the olive tree you're in the family, right?
So Tony stands up and he says what's so funny?
Do I am news you am I some kind of clown or something?
Then he takes a steak knife right and he starts sticking this guy and he's sticking him right
Well anyway the meal was great the olive tree restaurant when you're here your family forever
Right 1047 least for a half hour at least still
They bring the wheel to the table like I get said them cork out of the bottle
I still keep thinking about Celetto and that exasperated look like you know you ever gonna get that thing
Open seeing get out of here. We can talk. You know. What's wrong with you?
Somebody fasses this in I don't think you do one of these qualify
I found it in the last place I looked
I mean that is stupid. It's a stupid thing to say because obviously
Yeah, I if you if you found it then wherever you found it that was the last place you look even if it was the first place you looked
It still was the last place you look I thought it the second to the last place I looked oh, well that's good
The least it wasn't the very last I hate when that happens and then and says love. He's a sharp as a cue ball
See this is this is an expressions for goyam
Because the way it's really said sharp as a mozza ball as the way it said or the way that most the Gentiles would say sharp as a
marble not sharp
Hello you
Huh great you're cutting out
What do you mean by that? Well that you were talking and then you weren't now you are again
Yeah, well how many times that happens? So just one all my lights are all just relax. Okay, you get so damn it
I don't even know about it. It's like what you tell me yesterday about the bokeh about chicken neck
The station has and paintings and why don't have any paintings anywhere whenever the hell was that?
To grand in our rear as he says there what like two thousand dollars behind
Well, I a guy like him can't afford to be too grand in or in your ears. I know
My god when you people gonna get with it
And one hell of this is this audience you know I have had one call or one fax about the Chicago pizza
Which is okay? I guess you know the best way to do it when you go somewhere you try yourself then you find out
Because everybody in their brother can give you all kinds of suggestions and tell you this but a beat but a book
Although it would be nice to get a few pointers like if you're going to Rome
I'll tell you about my favorite trot 3 and my favorite pizza rear in Rome
On the Prince of E Amadeo via Prince of E Amadeo
Well, what a great trot 3 imagine. I just love that place. In fact if I if I wait like 130 pounds if I was underweight
Not diabetic. I would just get on a plane right now and go there and just man
Juman juman to the food in a Roma baby unless I have I will admit this. I did have a couple of bad meals there
You know when somebody tells you oh, it's such a great place for food. You can't get a bad meal there
Well if you're going to wrong joint, you know, you can get a bad meal anywhere
You know what I'm saying what he made her he was with that again. You know what I'm saying
There was another poll too
Oh, now here you go. Here's some South Florida tourists and my suggestions
If somebody from out of town visits South Florida make sure they don't miss see what I would do is make sure they didn't do it
Right if I want to be a nice guy say oh don't go there. You don't want to go to South Florida
Make sure they don't miss South Beach and that for a zoo the monkey jungle little Havana the near Roger show now. We're talking
Oh god. What else is there the jungle queen dinner crew speaking of queens saw grass mills mall
My Kai spelled my Kia

Oh
A lot of faxes this morning man. Oh here. Oh and you know something
This is the winter and I say it all the time and I hate saying it because it's they're got a very excellent point
Can I be honest with you
Or to be honest with you I say that all the time. I don't know why because I am honest to them honest to a fault
I'm not one of those I mean L.I. when I need to like anybody else, but not that much
You know what do you mean? No, and then to like friends of mine. I don't lie
And I'm trying to think if I even like tell white lies. I just don't lie. There's no point
Right, but when somebody says can I be honest with him the faxes is no lie to me. I prefer that right if you were married
You'd lie a lot
But I'm not married and isn't that a wonderful thing? Yeah, maybe that's why I'm still alive. Maybe why I made it to 64 maybe make it to 94 okay
Because I'm not in a that persuasion or is a pet boom would say friendly persuasion
It's 20 days ago you got 810 votes on a pool there were creeped we're creeping along toward the 900 mark
We'll get to a thousand bite to not too much more than that though
Because let me see how much they hate
You know 21.7 22% hate to pull us the leading and the interesting part of it is
It's part of the fact that they hate to pull so much we're getting a zillion calls with people coming up with other expressions
It's a great pull
There's the damn thing wrong with it
Is there anything wrong with it? No, here's a fact. I'm not gonna bother to send
Yes, it's the it says how could we forget the stupidest expression frequently used by this

I just say all of the above, you know
Sure, it's hard to pick one out and say yeah, they weren't very good. I'm talking about the first two movies
Obviously in the third we could start getting carried away. I was pretend it didn't never happened
Pretend that it won't I still say there was some really good stuff in here too bad
They ruined the good story with all the bad acting but and the bad dialogue and the bad
whatever
I remember all the talk there was gonna be godfather for well who the hell was still gonna be alive
There was nobody left Michael died. Remember he dropped the orange. They all had
Marlowe's name was had the orange peel in his mouth. They're trying to scare the granted there. He's trying to scare Anthony
Remember he was there going through and then of course the bug spray like orange is killed if you're a dog
I guess so I guess and that's because oranges the citrus fruit come from Florida. They're killers. Well, you're being else in Florida
See do you think they're a lot of old people in Florida when those people came to Florida they were like
30 about like five years ago now they all look like 80 and 90 and 100ness because they've had a rough life in Florida

Entire CNBC crew even the cameraman ought to be in jail for that
Whilst the new economy against the old time and instead of that they get this crazy cramer guy and then all of a sudden he's like a a bit called hero

Oh
Okay, I don't think that one's going to blind up on a pull, but that's kind of cute
I mean yeah on a scale of zero
Let's see see these people have been frustrated because we don't do the building polls anymore
Thank the Lord. I hated those all doesn't it boring the man the myth the legend all right
They must be talking about
Legendary the man the myth the legend that's stupid and for the sports nerds anything beginning with walkoff walkoff
Run walkoff single walkoff walk etc walkoff home run
I think we can just stick with a walkoff home run thing
I mean if we want to do the sports ones. I mean there's 80's in those and he has fans responsible for most of them
Oh Sammy goes yard
Well, what does that mean Sammy goes yard?
Sally goes around the roses. What the hell does that mean Sammy goes yard cuz he and all money goes yard a walkoff home run
And like I told Josh when we're arguing about this last year or the season before it just sounds so stupid
You know like oh he had a run of gamers over let's everybody walk off now
And then I got to run off the field they're gonna walk off walk off my ass. Okay, and it was a more long walk
I'll get a walk. I'll get a walk. I would be maybe about 10 miles couldn't hurt
Walkoff home run
The desperation see this is the thing now another you got the cable all these sports cable channels in the SPM's got about 50 different channels of their own
And all the other cramp on there they have to they have to try to like take something really terminally boring and make it real exciting
And really spice it up a little bit so they come up with just stupid cliches
Which of course Chris Burman and I don't mind Chris Burman
He was funny from about five minutes you know about 20 years ago
But he's one of the biggest
One of the guiltiest of all I was speaking of guilty. There's Carl Rhodes patients from all and oh my god
One of the all one's this whole crowd gonna wind up in prison
That's what I'd like no federal prison. Let's see him all all chain together on the chain gang
Like we could sweep that could be the theme song for the administration of sand cook working on the chain gang
You got that yes, I do. I love that song you do have to yeah
This is the time of year
Everyone's a little bit higher this say Colleen would you be wanting to come over to my place to have me
A wax my shell
Now that I want my Patrick
If you be wet in the green I know there's a smart lassie
She's making sure her lad is wearing the kelly green protection of leprecha condom
Don't be wishin' on a folded clover. I'll file in for the gift of gab
Especially if you're planning on kissing some bloody stones
What have you be doubting your protection with the apricondoms they're strong enough for a man
But I like them too. So check yourself as different condom and your work be catching anything else
1119 to 560s every QAM I go and speak of that here's that story in leprecha
I've tried ten times to read this
First years of facts from dick who says it's one of the stomest things people say these days nowadays is it is what it is
Okay, as opposed to it ain't what it is right it is what it isn't
What that was that supposed to mean he says I hate that one is you would say like poison
He's also sick of people say support the troops especially the hypocrites in DC
And he also says don't ever change. I'll write. I won't can't too late
There was no pata gold behind the dancing roadside leprecha only speeding tickets
Dozens of drivers in the Orlando area found out the hard way yesterday after passing an orange county shift deputy dressed as a leprecha
And warning drivers to slow down
Alazza detector clock cars above his side reading watch your speed or cost you a pata gold and several officers on motorcycles
Chase those who didn't heed the advice deputy Richard Lockman said police are beginning out about a ticket a minutes and say to clock yesterday morning
It was dressed in a green leprecha not filled with a hat tight white knickers and a fake red beard
When about he faked him out Lockman did the same thing with Christmas Elf outfit in December speeders complained that being stuffed by a deputy and
Customers in trapment. I think it's just ridiculous Lockman said the elf didn't force anybody to speed
No, I think he's got a point there. Oh look at this guy secret service arrest man after he jumps the fence of the White House
Maybe just was tried again for like a little lunch, okay? Maybe he made a little lunch for lunch. Oh the fanny wanted an autograph and they dragged his
Not conflicted answer. I'm looking right now with a guy with a beard and gray
You know he probably just looking for maybe spare some change mister something like that, you know
I really hate that. Yeah, I'm very tired of that. I'm just I would say that's probably the only thing
That I really dislike here intensely. I'm trying to think of anything else
I mean, you know the bad winter days which you only had like three or four all year, but
That's the only thing that really bugs me
Is there a way too many homeless people here which I guess you could probably see in any big city and too much of that and
And there are guys just like walking down the street who don't look like you know like that guy there like
They're a destitute or prostitute and oh, you know what some change pal. No
sorry
And I used to say sorry and then I don't even know I just keep walking or now you say sorry
Sorry, no, there's a sorry sorry. Oh, yeah, sorry
That's the Canadian way. Sorry

Okay, what are these people doing on the loose if you have they find it with like a pin joint in your ass tray
Going away for 20 years minimum
But if you're like a sex offender you're gonna run around raping and the pillaging and looting and plundering and abusing
Then it's like around you know we're gonna be about 20 minutes
Until you cool off. We'll be able to take a cold shower on the inside and then we'll turn your ass out again
They just can't figure out while they while these things happen
It's like the Catholic Church moving and priest around you. Oh, if we just move into a different location
Maybe they'll come up with a different vocation

Let's see here's a fact that says oh yeah, this one was on that other lengthy one a few fry short of a happy meal
Like that although I do like 24 cent short of a quarter is good
You dance with the one that what brung you
That sounds like a real redneck you think you dance with the one what brung you
Mm-hmm and
Chomping at the bit which stupid schmit used to say champion of it. Oh
This is osky formerly from Montreal and definitely not a frog. Oh, what's that bit there with the airplane stuff?
And where he says there's a sale of pennies. What's that bit called? Oh, Titanic. That's it
Just see before you could even answer
It was okay. Well, I'll play that after the break make a nice break
And also here's another Chris we got lots of Chris is on there so many Chris isn't so little time, you know
Who says I used to live in Miami several years ago and listen to you. I now live in Utah
I'm sorry Chris and listen online heard you talking about the food in Chicago
Geordano is the best place. That's the best piece I've ever had in my life
He says uh, but I'll be put a boop a bit about anyway. I love the show and glad to be listening again
Thanks Chris in Utah and that nice see somebody online is telling me you know on the phone on the fax
They don't want to give me any advice about that. Maybe they never been to Chicago. Maybe they never had no Chicago piece of leafish stick
Really great stuff that weighs about a half upon the slides
It really is something man
And I still don't understand because we did have uh, uno is once a part of time in South Florida
Anything that's good doesn't last too long in that right like Sonic
Sonic went by by mm-hmm. Well, I'll be damned
Anything that's really fantastic like godfather's right
I mean, I know you still got that one probably up by the Hess station if it's still there
Did you tell me it was or wasn't I'm really I don't know I think I told you know that I just find out
Fudruckers is gone. What's gonna be next?
First it was corkies now it's fudruckers and it was godfather's right
I'm gonna tell you man when I was at WS news
That's when I discovered there was a godfather's on sunset. They're not far from where taco vb used to be
And I don't care what anybody says any of my people online there give me about the taco v with the best thing was about a beep
The best thing was the squeeze cheese man
Hmm they had that orange the real orange moussi and squeeze cheese that they put in the burritos and on the tacos
Oh, my taco v was great. I mean I do like Taco Bell, but it ain't no taco viva
mm-hmm
And right on that simple strip shopping center that on sunset
Between I want to say like a hundred and seventh f and the whatever in Galilee road
Right in between there was the first godfather's and I wasn't w's news and it came on ears a sponsor in the manager that place
I've put it a story a million times, but I can't get heavier out of my mind. Hey, have you
He was the young guy in his early 20s and his family you know started the
Well his family actually all bought a bin jail or something really well
They were like you know, no, I don't know. They had a bunch of businesses. I don't know and I see all on the up and up or whatever
That means there's another stupid expression on the up and up is huh? That's a monkey business. I don't know
But he was a fine young man and he just loved me man
Haviour hey, Haviour boy, but now that's his Indian years ago. He must be in a wheelchair or something right now
He must have a walker see that's the depressing part
I think back to all those days like the days of Zeta, you know, and all those because it was on FM
So we had all those living and breathing young people listening
It's a miracle. We have any young people listen here on AM on a scratchy AM radio station
I mean, it's a freaking miracle
Especially with a tremendous promotion at this station gives for everybody
And especially following well, I don't want to say I don't want to go into that because then I should feel what do the guy say I should feel guilty?
Yeah, they should feel guilty on payday. They should feel really guilty those guys WQ. I am hello
Dale yes, sir. I got a few of them boy here
Yeah, I might have missed the last couple of minutes of the Haviour he's already forgive me is the Pope Catholic is the Pope Catholic?
I like that. Is the Pope Jewish? Yeah does the Pope wear a funny hat?
Okay, there's one that you say all the time and I don't just don't get it side by each
Oh, that's a Canadian thing if the the only person I ever heard say that is Frank Suley who's a great racetrack announcer
calls harness racing at Western fear used to be a woodbite and he used to say when the horses were like next to each other instead of side by side
He would say side by each which is just a Canadian thing I guess I don't know
Okay now by duck in a row you got all these ducks in a row your ducks in a row. Yeah, there they are all lined up
Let's get them. That's the way Cheney likes them all lined up
All right now this one you say you don't call you say it doesn't bear
What is it does a bear?
Dog on bear does a bear oh those are the bear in the woods yeah that's right yeah
Okay, I would imagine probably the answer is yes
Yeah, like the Pope Catholic right okay now
Let me get off the subject a little bit because
Couple of guys on you show it you talk about all the time and I show it
Well, yeah, I've got a nice show here
Yeah
You talk about a guy I must be Jewish because I don't know

During a speech on the House floor on the Thursday yesterday
Representative little Dennis Kucinichibal how declared that impeachment may well be the only remedy which remains to stop a war of aggression against Iran
The 2004 presidential candidate was running again in 2008 told raw story that in his house floor statement
It speaks for itself this house cannot avoid its constitutionally authorized responsibility to restrain the abuse of executive power
He said on the four yesterday the administration has been preparing for an aggressive war against Iran
There was no solid direct evidence that Iran has got the intention of attacking the US or its allies
He noted that since the US is a signatory to the UN Charter constituent treaty among nations of the world
And article two states that all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force
Against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state that even the threat of a war of aggression is ill-eagle
Article six of the constitution makes such treaties the supreme law of the land because they said this administration is openly threatened to
aggression against the Iranian violation of the US Constitution and the UN Charter but a beep bit of boop bit of op
And they said boy you sure are funny looking Dennis
And they won't listen to him because he's like a little goofball, but he's great
He's got the balls to speak up and tell it like it is
And anybody in America who's got the balls to speak up and tell like it is it's like oh gee. What's he starting complaining again?
Quit your complaining quit your bitchin

They must be feeling really porky down there. I'm telling you that there must be something really hostile
Like you know the fact that the weather is so bad. It's dark. It looks like three o'clock in the morning instead of like

I'd only be 95
So we have an update from Curtis. Yes, the G stands for Girlfriend Experience
No, well, that was pretty easy nothing x-rated about that. Well, what does that mean?
You've got no girlfriend. Girlfriend Experience
I have no idea depends on what context. I really don't know and quite frankly don't care, but nevertheless
It stands for Girlfriend Experience, pal. This is supposed to be an educational show and there you go
Well, we just got through a ton of games and we can put us call back
Call back Curtis. We want to find out what kind of hate you spank you. What was that in there? Yeah
Girlfriend Experience is that experience or experience girlfriend experiment
It's just an experience
Listen, we're not asking your dead ass. We're asking Curtis. He's obviously the expert pervert on his our kind of guy on the show
567 is obviously he's doing more than just watching the ball scores there on his computer screen
You know, I'm saying as much further than he's going to more than websites than just espn.com
Is what I'm thinking could be wrong about that, but I doubt it adieu did wqway and hello
And here yes sir
I rather you would actually call a hooker a girlfriend being that you would go to them to do things that you wouldn't do your girlfriend anyway
but
Just a quick thing about your show. I love you show, but
Can you read one of those taxes?
Why don't you get yourself a shredder instead of ripping the paper? I mean I'm getting tired of the ripping of the paper
I like it so you don't like ripping the paper go rip a rip your ass. He's getting he's getting tired of it
He might be on the verge of the game. He's getting tired of it. What a schmuck man
You you are wise so many people millions of people are dying their desperate. They're like is it's like trying to break the door down in a prison
Trying to get out of that place
We got to get out of this place remember that sure Eric burden and animals. That's correct
We got to get on this place because there's too many people like you sir looking for a problem
There's any problem you love the show. He just got through Sanio loves the show
But why did you quit tearing up because I feel like it because it makes me feel good
Okay, I rip it up with my own bare hands makes me feel real masculine. You know like a real man almost well closes all over again
Schmuck

And who the fuck it to
That's what the public wants to hear the house of the rising sun the animals man is this number one hit?

Hello, oh, good. You yes, sir
How are you sir? Okay

Wow, that was very educational
Yeah, the work of pd guy he's another one
He's a good bullet between the ears. I was gonna say in the brain, but we couldn't find it
Maybe just in his back home. Wtc.ym. Hello
Yes, sir
Humpty, yeah brutal
Need to be they need to be shot a lot of shooting needs to be done, pali should be a capital fence and
Real quick about pizza in Chicago. I'd say it's like what beach should I go to in Florida?
Just look around a little bit and you'll be fine
It's all good. It's all good. Okay, thanks pali
Like bubble would say it's all good although. I think geodano is based on the thing I got on the from the guy in Utah
And what I heard from a friend of mine who's a Chicago
I wouldn't say expert, but knows it pretty well
He said geodano is his great-ness probably why it's so busy there's lined up like 80
You know the one thing about the Chicago pizza and I'm trying to think of what station I worked in
Where we headed the they'll send it air express, you know, they put it in the with those what do they call those things?
I give up friends. Huh? They call them Fred. They pack them on dry ice is what I'm trying. Oh, okay
And we got I'm a thing with Sarah Soda like back in the 73 when I worked there WSP being we got a Chicago pizza
delivered the air express like that
And then there was some other stuff that we had was it the Chicago dogs
I don't know some other food that we had shipped and it's damn good
And if you go on the websites of all these places like Geno's East and Luma, Nadi's and geodanos most of those joints
Will will ship them anywhere in the country?
And so the fact that you're stuck like an ash debula or higher somewhere you're thinking oh gee
I wish I had some of that reading good Chicago style pizza or whatever there are a lot of places like that that'll send you
You know
Just don't stick your hands in the dry ice. That's my best suggestion to you. Not a really good idea now put it on your tongue
That's better. That's always the best
WQAM hello
WQAM hello
Hey Neil I got a few cliches. Oh sure 20 or 30 would be good go. I got a couple of hours. So

Sometimes they push it a little bit too far. He knew exactly when to bail out when in that time to bail out
Sound like he was reprising the airplane a bit that we played a little bit ago. Yeah, boy bridges
Lloyd bridges is dead. How about some of the other people that are Peter Graves is still alive and doing those nice guy co-spots
Oh, that's one of my very least favorite ones on tangerine
I plan on some tangerine look lost and answer the door. I was one lucky woman
I was unless you saw airplane you have no idea what that even means right
Am I right? It is a tie-in. There's no question. Oh sure. He's reprising the same bag character that he was an airplane
I was here growing man naked today. Right
As a matter of fact
Oh

And say that when number one, top of the heat, we can't be beat.
Again we have one who's thought bombing our land.
Why not start to save you?
Let's make your party lot of best.
And hold our breath.
And when all the boys are there, I'll do a show with that sick chair and save good vibes.
I'm right, I'm right, I'm right, who's heaven heads.
Bang bang, you're dead.
Did anybody ever attempt Josh Cortes on the back of the head and say, hey, there's no stories on here.
There's no bedtime stories.
Which I sent him a whole bunch yesterday.
He gave me a song and an insight into the cinema.
But my old time was in that band.
He's either in a meeting or not here.
He's why?
Either in a meeting or not here.
Wasn't that great?
Well, that's okay.
Listen, that's the QAM exercise.
He's too busy and practically irrelevant at the composite.
He's a damn little head and send a check.
That's the laughing button, but it's true.
I mean, why not help when I send a check when I send like, you know, 15, 20 important stories.
And there's nothing on there.
And our vast audience out there is like going back again and again.
Where is the stuff we're supposed to read today?
We're all those intellectual stories for all those egg heads out here.
Scott in Pinellas Park says he said, by the way, Pinellas Park is the only place
that could make Tamrak look good.
Excellent point, Scott.
A few more.
It's a win-win situation.
From the get-go, he or she is a partial stranger.
Yeah, that's interesting.
A partial stranger.
He or she's no day at the beach.
And it says the toll fee numbers are working if you're calling from the 727 area code.
Well, that's a record of Scott that will teach you to live in the 727 area code.
Don't do it again.
But here's my very favorite.
It's from Dave, who says, add this to your dumbest expressions poll.
This is my favorite.
We're not going to put this one on there, but this is, nothing is even close.
You want to hear it?
Ready?
Robert Creeper, the grim reaper and the Lord of the Board.
Nice going, Dave.
I mean, I just nausea inducing.
It's just puke inducing, you know.
56670560, pound 560, and leave a rise in singular wireless line.
Proaching a thousand out of that.
We're making our approach right now.
We're going to be landing any second.
975 votes.
And of course, you know, it will be a soft landing on the show.
Dominic Q.A.N.
Hello.
With that Lord of the Board spelled D-O-A-R-D or D-O-R-E-D.
D-O-R-E-D, yeah.
Board of the Board.
I'm going to either way.
Listen, I have the opposite of this.
I think the greatest expression has come into modern usage.
Yeah.
I'm sure that George will agree with me.
Friends with benefits.
Friends with benefits.
That's a good expression when you get it.
Because the renders marriage obsolete.
Amen.
Amen to that, sir.
You're holding weekend.
And you too.
Have a lovely weekend and a lovely life, wife, life.
56670560, pound 560, and leave a rise in singular wireless line.
Don't forget, join the QM Street team right now till 2 o'clock.
At the Verizon Wireless Store at 100th South Viscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami, the QM Street team.
Maybe George Cordis is down there on the street.
He ought to be.
Stop buying when prices get autographs from the heat dancers.
No stories on our website today, George Cordis.
I just mentioned that in passing.
And that check that was just, oh man, it was like writing my hand in all of a sudden.
Oh.
Oh.
Remember that guy I called before?
Oh, I know.
I'm never a thing of stories.
Don't worry.
I'm shredding those.
WQAM, hello.
Here, good afternoon.
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, dear sir.
We don't need any new articles on the web because we know you'll read them all on the air.
Here.
There was a, that's probably George's boyfriend.
WQAM has a lot of things to do with the web.
Hello.
Yeah, can I come in?
Speaking.
Speaking.
Yeah, hey.
Just for a day, I have done this expression.
That's the way they're kicking crumbles.
Yeah, that's not good.
No, get it.
I don't think so.
So he can crackers in there, man.
Not a good idea.
Kind of like the sums up this business.
Too many crumbs.
Summers up pretty well to me.
5.67.05.60 and 0.05.60 in the Verizon.
Remember what I said before about people who are not in the industry.
People who think that they're very funny.
Like Bill Marip, for example.
When that guy called me for instance, did we get Bill Marip here in Canada?
No, he's banned at the border, pal.
B-O-B, banned on the border.
Man, twerp, giving the word twerp, new definition.
And when he was sucking up, because he's got around his show all the time, and coders.
See, there's a man of no principles whatsoever.
Right.
He pretends to be this great liberal and this great anti-right wing hero.
And then, but the hillkiss and coders ass has grotesque and nauseating as a thought may be,
because she's a guest on the show all the time.
Oh, yeah, I'll have her back, and I don't have always agreed with what she's saying.
And then, oh, what a simple whim.
I think he ought to well open the rubber creeper to the Lord of the Bordon, Mia.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, how about hello, these lucks.
WQAM, hello.
Anyhow, how's it going?
Okay, sir.
I've noticed that you guys for a couple of years now, and I've never really felt your pain when you say this.
My amy's bad and self-ported is bad as much as I did last night when I went to the youth fair.
And the people there, man, terrible, terrible, terrible, and I'm talking about like,
even older people also, you know, not just the young kids.
You want even older ones?
Yeah, most, mostly older people.
Yeah, the 30s, the 30-year-olds, when it is, and I'm 24 years old.
I'm not 40 or 50 or 60 complaining.
I'm a young guy.
Yeah.
And the people down here are just, I don't know what they think of themselves, are they looking for something mirror?
And it's just sad, it's sad, man.
What?
Tell me about it.
Good over, Neil.
I'm moving in.
Okay, see you.
Send a picture, pal.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 in the horizon, see you at a wireless line.
I guess I'll give a quick rundown.
Okay, I'll say one thing.
We haven't had a whole lot of repeats like usual.
980 votes on the poll.
The dumbest expression that people say is, I hate this poll is down to an even 20%.
We got a shot at getting under that.
196.
That's scandalous.
Two shakes of a lamb's tail, 125, a pig in a poke 84.
Never stole a freight train, 76.
That's one of my favorites.
In a coons' age, 70.
I don't want to be saying that.
Look at these split, 67.
Mm-hmm.
Feather in your cap, 49.
That is a door nail, 48.
I never heard of the dumb expression, 43.
Where you must not get out of the house too much, I guess.
First time, Paula, long time listed, 23.
I despise that.
You know what I mean?
23.
Dumbest dirt, 21.
As the crow flies, 16.
But my whistle, 16.

Make it snappy three.
Who invented that?
You shouldn't, wasn't that Greg Reed who said that?
Don't Schmidt, were you we?
I don't know.
Make it snappy three.
Good to go with three.
It is what it is, too.
Pack your patients, too.
A lot of packing going out, I'll tell you that right now.
In the next two, not for nothing one.
Have your cake and eat it, too, one.
I think Al Pacino said that several times.
What is that bunch of, uh, sex offender with his parents?
The family?
Oh, filled that little kid.
Uh, it's just sick.
Really sick.
I think they ought to take the whole family and execute them on the NBC nightly news.
No votes for win-win situation is the Pope Catholic.
I heard that.
Hot to trot by hooker by crook, airfew in my shoes.
No votes yet.
Out of 93.
So this half hour Chris will go over a thousand an hour to spare.
Or we can replace him in a Marlins game for me, as they would be there.
Sounds good.
Did they win?
Uh, I think so.
No.
And does anybody care?
No.
Even they don't care.

Now let's see.
19.7%.
Let's hear it.
We got 120%.
We started out with like what?
89% or something.
They hated it.
Too much hate down there.
Stop hating.
Reach out and tap somebody under the shoulder and say,
I love you.
Or just live.
Let me go out in the hall to do that.
Go out in the hall and grab somebody.
Go get Tommy and kiss him on the cheek.
Say, I love you Tommy.
He'll smack you on.
Rich says,
but you just relax.
Rich says,
Fubruckers are still around a date county.
See if he's been more time a date county,
you'd find out what's really going on.
You're talking about me?
Yeah.
Well Chris lives there.
He ought to know.
He doesn't know.
He thinks a guy,
although he shouldn't know where the food is though.
It says it's in the roundness to the international mall.
Sonic is also in the date county still.
See if he's going to date county.
He'd find the good stuff.
Finally, there's also a Godfather's Pizza inside a head station on bird road
next to Tammy and me Park.
So how do you like that?
And of course the Godfather's.
Which I know we asked the one on the baby road extension.
In a head station,
I think that was the first head station that had the Godfather's.
Remember they came by a couple times and they brought us pizza.
Remember that?
Oh.
And the pizza doesn't really travel all that well as you know.
I mean traditional style does,
but I'm talking about that kind of thick, the thick kind.
Like steak.
Steak doesn't travel well.
It's going to be on the year.
Although over the years I guess we've had people brought us in steak.
And then there was always Smith and Wolensky came here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's not go there speaking of expression.
Oh.
Don't even go there.
I like that.
I like to hate that one.
That's one of my least favorites.
Don't even go there.
Oh.
Brother.
So Godfather's is still around,
but not like the original one.
No.
That was so good.
Especially that one on sunset with my buddy Javier.
Hey Javier, come over here and sit down.
I'm not going to sit down with my lamb.
Well I sure wonder if he went to the Pokey with the rest of the family.
But he was a popular guy in Nero if he did.
Here's one from Ed in Fort Lauderdale.
He says as Nercupon.
I love it.
That was good.
Not getting ahead of myself.
As Nercupon.
I'm right.
As Nervus as a Forky Pine in a Balloon Factory.
That is cute.
Isn't that cute?
Yes it is.
Nervus as a Forky Pine in a Balloon Factory.
You know what I'm looking for?
I can.
That's probably just about not going to find it.
I'm not going to put that on there.
I'm sure.
Because that's, hey it's cute.
But who the hell ever heard of that?
Anybody ever heard that?
No.
Anybody ever say that?
No.
No.
I think we're approaching a thousand on the pole.
Get ready.
Get ready for a real exciting moment here.
9.97.
Uh oh.
Uh oh.
See I didn't want to let that thing go all the way through.
Little just a-
Oh no, that wasn't good.
Try it again.
Okay that was good.
About a half a bomb.
Which Georgia's half a bomb is better than known.

He's calling Eater.
Oh man, not to that Chris.
It goes to show the fact people are the funny people.
You know just look at him.
You're laugh.
Now seriously he's funny guy.
Don't realize you're funny yet but you'll see.
He's funny looking so he's halfway there.
Oh now that's because that was a gratuitously it was honest of course but it was gratuitously nasty in the inventory.
Yeah what would you do then?
He hasn't sought me out yet.
He's feeling bad about that.
He doesn't have a hot girlfriend to come in here and give me a handful ass.
How do you know he doesn't have a hot girlfriend?
Trust me.
Are you seeing his girlfriend?
I haven't seen no of course not.
If he had I'd seen her by now.
You know what that would be like.
It would be like somebody showing you a baby picture and you say you know proud father or mother just had a baby.
And you say gee that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen in my life.
He's just not going to do that.
No you're not.
So the fact that you're saying he doesn't have a hot girlfriend.
How do you know?
Because he doesn't have any.
That's how he said the other day he said he was like working on one.
I think I know what he yeah he's working on it.
I think I know what he knew.
He's got a lot of somebody closes the deal.
Do you have any Q.A.M.
How about closes the deal?
Yes sir.
How's he on?
Great.
How about that loose?
How does it loose?
It's a loose.
And it could loose.
Okay this is a loose.
He sounds like he was getting tickled by that like with the feather.
Like with the goose feather or goose down.
What is goose down?
You know how they make goose down?
Do they make goose down?
Do they make goose down?
Oh my hands.
Oh my hands.
Oh my hands.
Is the feathers from the needle?
998 in the pole.
No, see you shouldn't do that.
No, yeah.
Don't cut your chickens before they had.
That's another stupid expression.
You know this this pool today even there is a lot of stupid crap on here.
It makes it makes you realize how conditioned we are that so much of our lives at least verbally is spent exchanging stupid ass expressions that we hear and we get we get hooked with them you know.
And just keeps saying I'm over and over again.
Am I correct?
I think absolutely correct.
But Robert Greeper the alluring of the board the schmuck of the puck.
He's he's the then that one is it.
Thanks a lot Dave.
And the guy's name is Dave Ryder not not really the Dave Ryder radio Dave Ryder.
I wonder if he's still alive.
I don't know.
Dave Ryder that hired me at W.Y. and Z away from W.S. News that that's quite a story.
W.S. News.
Because I handed my contract at WNWS that if I stayed I forget to the end of the contract I got a twenty twenty five thousand dollar bonus.
And I stayed till the end of the deal and then after I sealed the deal and the meantime I and Z hired me away and they tried to I had to go to court and Cheryl's ex husband the judge Lenny what was his name?
Leonard I can't think of what his name was but anyway we had to have a trial as to whether my non-compete would hold up in court or I could go to work for I and Z.
And of course we won.
Henry Rothblatt sent the one of his flunky attorneys in there to argue my case the judge Lenny or you can't remember his name.
No.
Whatever you drive me to budget has to be Lenny Mark's head.
I can't think of what his name was.
Some Jewish guy.
Well, I know Cheryl was murdered.
You know he was Jewish and he had a lot of money.
That wasn't Ripken.
Leonard Ripken.
And that's about what do you say like that?
Yeah Leonard Ripken.
That's about what he was saying.
That's about what he was saying.
That's about what he was saying.
That was the last name.
All the time we knew her.
That's about the last name.

For this very antsy hostile crowd.

What a disgusting thought that is for those people
I mean for some people it might be a very erotic thought but for those people it's a grotesque and horrendous thought
I mean like to think that those people are reproducing that's the problem maybe for sterilization. That's what we need
They can do all the hanky spanky. They want. I don't want to deprive anybody of their happiness
But jeez Louise no more making no more babies with them people with that crowd that red necky in red crowd
Okay, let's see what this says it says my oh yeah

What I just from that cream man mr. Ross
On a way man. He just he just left. We just got two of the thing we're Frankie Pintangely
And you give your loyalty to a Jew before you undress that's right small potatoes is both about well
I started I haven't rocked to be very proud but I would say
The board goes back five six seven oh five sixty you know for a poll that they claim they hated like poison at the beginning of the show
See leave it to me leave it to this old bag to teach them that they liked it
You know what I'm saying because the right in the beginning of the show I said to them
You like it and his own oh no
Beach of that time. Yeah, it is I got the quickest finger in the North baby. Let me tell you what I heard
Yeah, believe me. Oh no. Well, we'll see WQ. I am hello
Hello, Mr. Mill yes, sir
Alice who is it?
This is a man
Busy as a three-legged bird dog in a cubby of quail huh
Yeah
and
And oh that was it. Oh, okay
I'm I waited because I was positive there might have had to be more because he saw it so he sounded so authoritative
And so pleased to be on the radio to share his expertise with the audience to share something
WQ I am hello
Yeah, Neil yes, sir. I got a couple for you. Okay, five will get you ten
Not a woodbine it won't five dollars to get you ten said it would buy me. Maybe that's what they meant by that five
I'll get to ten sent and two peas in a pod and two peas or five long time
Okay, yeah, pali
See yeah, he sure tickled a hell out of him. You must have found that further again
First the feather was in his camp and then it must have been that dome got in his place somewhere because he was just tickled
That's what that it was okay. It was you know what not maybe the greatest call in history of the human race
Seriously well when is the last time we didn't anything like this that's had this kind of response
I mean it's probably only 75 million stupid expression
But when's the last time and now are you are we gonna find out where that damn sonic was? I'll I'm sure I'll get the information
Yeah, I'm not the huh, I mean I'm not gonna drive a lot of time right now and go on down to my amitagot find sonic not
But those would see that's another thing like adventure car hop in sagas mass. I told you already warned from our
Arnie woo-woo again and not Arnie Warren
Arnie Ginsburg from W. M. A. X. and Boston he owned that adventure car hop
And that was a great place on the way to rocking him park to lose our money back when I lived in Boston in the early 60s
Always with stuff at adventure car hop and it was those those were great the old car hops
Am I right? Yeah, no, I like the a and w used to go there all the time and
In some of those places the girls would come out on roller skates. That's right. Am I right? Yes
And of course then when they would trip and fall and trade would go flying and all your food on the ground
It wasn't quite so cute when the food would go flying
And some of those heterogies got to look up her dress while she was flopping
That's right, but whatever thought it was somebody else's food. Right. That's right. Oh look at that
She's Sarah over there. She just took a slip and fall and all the food went flying
But look at that, you know back. Yeah, that's what it looks like to me, but never left
So we are really kicking a big family today. We'll find out where that Sonic is in fact
I wouldn't be surprised if George takes the whole family out this weekend of Sonic
Hey, if one was close by you and you know the well I'm gonna find out for you where it is north Miami's not like a million miles from Hollywood
Where you are for Christ's sakes would you? No, no, but still last time I look
Whatever his name is Josh quarters and put no stories up
Where are you Josh? Yeah, so you know that check I was thinking about for Josh
Yeah, occasionally I said I'm gonna listen a good moon wanna you know send away
Nice job, John
People that use snappy openers for their show segments like that one to two-hour
This court finds you give to
I
Burn it
Where is the part and who needed the most I can't believe this I could actually go to jail
Cuz scooter there be as totally toast
Crap not working for you
They said he skills me all the way
He lied and now
He's
And we just need to see him gone
Shoulder saliva just to get us to war the whole story was I can say
Live
Sky high while we're getting poor
Push and chain me must have been high to think we let them
Just need to see them gone
Live behind a bad day
Shooters don't know if the fence is on but they figured it out
It's when you are told
Genie sense of life. They're all going down
Nothing out of that fight you let us
Us a safe clear
I hope they long down to you and changing you a time
It will be yourself
I
Want to one at five sixty W. It's our award winning gigantic one to our let me just take a look and see now
Maybe I'm picking on Josh quarters needlessly, but yeah, well, I think he probably did was he you know
He posted the stories and he forgot to hit the button whatever. No, there's nothing on there
There's nothing on there and
Work work and he be working
You know, I'm saying the met texted
Yeah, send him a text message and say hey you jackass you just blew a nice fat check down the drain because you ain't doing your job
I mean wouldn't it make sense for him to like to double check after we does that just to see if they're on here like oh
Yeah, let's see. There's all the 20 stories in the assembly or sometimes eight or nine or ten or only seven or eight on the weekends
You know because I don't want to overwork his fat ass
But nevertheless we do the best we can house judiciary committee chairman John Connors today
Yes to them. Sorry. Well, whatever
Central editor of the US Attorney General Alberto Vio Fadganzala's demanding answers to allegations that he may have advised the president
To shut down an investigation of the White House's domestic wiretapping surveillance program because of his involvement with the program
It would be an extraordinary abuse of authority if you advise the president on this matter after learning that your own conduct was to be investigated
Connures wrote
Roth story reported earlier yesterday in a statement released by Senator Russ Finegul that expressed some of our concerns about the reports
Concerny the attorney general's possible rule in blocking investigation which he may have been a target. I'll ride put him all in jail
Throw away the key
Connures also issued a statement about ABC News reports of emails linking Carl Rove to the US Attorney firing scandal
These latest reports if through our proof positive that lower level officials in the Justice Department are being hung out to drive
So the statement this goes all the way to the top of the justice department the most senior White House staff
Connures question the truthfulness of testimony given to the West Congress by the Justice Department and but it be pretty good about well there you go now you go John good
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have shredded that I tore it up on the area
560
560 leave a rise did we ever find out where Sonic was yet or what when you're not going there anyway? Oh, Chris found out he looked at one is in Naples
Now that is not true
Really because I'm on their website and I put in for the closest one within 150 miles of Miami
I got an email here the close ones at the hundred Miami one they found one and they also had that other email before from somebody who said
There's a sonic and date county and together Godfather guy. Oh, they must be drinking something because go to the sonic website
closest one is a West Coast
The closest one is on the West Coast
correct
Are you sure well look into the bottom of that before this hour's on I'm gonna tell you right now right
Well, kid the bottom of the sonic dilemma. We'll find out what intersection it's supposed to be at and just
WQ a n hello
Checkers so I don't think there's any sonic's down here
No way no way checkers down here. Yeah, there's chubby chubby checker down there
W checker you got it. Okay, okay, I'm saying how to down delabies at chubby checkers
Well, this is a real dilemma that we got in the middle of now all of a sudden like a one minute one guy saying one thing and then the next
Minute I'm getting a message yet. There is one I found he did a he did a some kind of a search and
Chris of course who's to anything it has to do with food he searching for it with both hands
WQ a m sonic line hello

Yeah, in your case, I'm sure you're like it because what else you got going on. I have no nothing
Yeah, this is turned into a real mystery now real dilemma the sonic thing you know one minute
I'm here one thing and the next minute I'm here
Another thing and then probably a couple minutes on the channel
So I if everybody in Dave County or even all over South Florida head out for sonic tonight
Just start looking for just stop at every street corner and say don't they is sonic
Don't is WQ a m hello
Hey, Nino. Yes, sir
Good morning. If you watch on
This man the Valerie plane that's the money. Oh people should be good to the firing squad. Yeah, okay
We know that it's old news WQ a m hello
Neil yes, sir. I can't believe it's been an hour man and nobody's given you the real definition of the GFE yet
It's a code word man. Yeah
It's a code word that means the girl will do a monocle of energy without a condom
They can't well, isn't that nice? Okay. Well, I want we wouldn't have is that on the sheet you had there that gave you all that information
You're right. I never got that far. Thank you Steve. We got it here north Miami 149
75 West Dixie highway what a guy is so now we need an agent to go over there and order up a bacon cheeseburger
North Miami 149 75 West Dixie highway. Well, I think I think we ought to like send him a bill or something
Because you know the power of the show back when we used to have an audience back when people used to
It's right listen to me so I remember those days wasn't that long ago, man till Joe Bell came to town
Well, there's that Peggy Eddenfield again with no teeth
The child of the child lived in the same mobile home park as the suspect. Oh mobile home park see trailer trash
See what I'm saying. I don't want to knock everybody lose in a trailer park, but Josh says the story's been up there
What city was that also
What what are you talking about 149 75 West Dixie highway? That's North Miami, okay
What are you questioning now? I got that information from my main man on there my number one correspond to the universe and the
Teleando you're questioning how big your pardon
No, he's not an evil illegal alien
Oh, you never know what am I looking for? Oh, I'm looking for the stories are not there
Well, if they are then he must have posted them with yesterday's or something like that
See the stories may be there, but the stats are just not sure what I'm up on today
I don't know and you know what I'm sorry that I even mentioned sorry Josh and you're still like it no check
Well, what did he say what what what I'm curious? He said he'll go check and then he came back and here he is now and he says I checked in the
Rept there
Yeah, but what about on the stats thing it shows no stories it shows no stats
He said I'm on his
I beg your pardon. He said it does on his it shows stats on your page for today. Yes from March 16
2007 this doesn't show any story read by anybody doesn't even show any
Get out of here. I saw a gaslight man. You got to be kidding me boring movie
It was great. Yeah, there's no sonic on that address either
Well, what does that mean?
Oh, this is turning into a
Mess what how do you know there's no sonic on that address?
If you put a sonic driving dot com
Yeah, have a store locator button you put any address or even just like a town and how many miles away from that address and it tells you
Where the closest ones are?
Maybe maybe it's subsonic maybe a super sonic
It'll be a shame if people started wasting their time going there and like you've come to find out it wasn't there
Maybe it's a decoy, you know, that's right. Somebody's waiting there to make it something else there
Maybe there's one of those hot to go is left over from the Pepsi people
Wasn't it Pepsi was a coke I think was Pepsi, wouldn't I don't recall they started the hot to go because they were pissed off because the other
Chains were only doing Coca-Cola coke instead of Pepsi and so is as their way of rebuilding we're gonna show you guys a thing or two
We're gonna put all you fast food guys out of our business
So they open up those hot to go they weren't so hot and they did go they were guys and go away Pepsi has lots of businesses like Taco Bell and KFC
For example, Miguel said he's gonna go check for us
Check for you what it's gonna go drive over to the address
He's gonna drive over to that address to see if the sonic is really there
Well, that would be quite a shame. It's got nothing better to do their damn few stations in America that would do that for you
Where they have the promotions guy go and drive over to see if they're really a such a place
And we're big time here, huh?
We're big time we can maybe that was out there information that my buddy found on the internet's there
That could be it. I mean just because it's on the internet
It might have been there 75 years ago. It might have been there when George Washington was a baby for all we know
But will Miguel's gonna go right over there and check that to me sounds like that
Not far from where the well-known since the up to three a few blocks because I used to live there and
Twin Lakes Racking Club. Mm-hmm. I'm 441 and 100 and I want to say 51 right by their year Golden Glades Interchange
Back when there were like 10 or 20 white people lived in that neighborhood and part of town
I mean, I'm just I'm just saying it like it is, you know
Not to the same thing wrong with that but that part of town is kind of changing demographics in the intervening years
Eric says yes, the stories were posted with the wrong date for some reason. Yeah
You won't see the stats until tomorrow. Oh, I don't really care what the stats are all that much
Is just that if I don't see anything on there to me I start getting panicking like that you know me
Yeah, just like that because I think oh error. What's his name?
Justin put them up there at all so they are on there somewhere just look around you'll find some crap
Just like the sonic thing if it's not right where we told you was just keep looking around you'll find one so
I guess what what we found something you found someone
Their website you have to like
Check different things and if you check everything to the club
There's one on 1520 North Miami North. Wait a minute. So there's a bunch of Sonic's around and we'll count more down in the day counting
For it. We have one. I'm sorry. These are three are Kansas
So we have 1520 North Maine Miami North what?
Never mind the sites all messed up
North America yeah, I'm such before they're giving us a whole local home and also
You know this is turned into a real
Picking a poke to go back to the original topic today. You're poking a pig. Yeah, poking it
I mean, what are you talking about
Hey, I'm just looking at this. I thought you just said you found one. Okay, and where does it say Miami?
It says like I clicked on it Miami Ohio. Yeah, it's like Miami Ohio Miami Kansas everything else
We're not getting a something for Florida right now, so what we'll keep checking
This has become a little I don't think I can emotionally deal with this
I mean ask me if I care do I really care? No, it'll be nice nice for the audience to find out nice for everybody to find out
I mean don't be so Miguel is really on his way over there to that location see if they're really is a Sonic
Apparently, it's what he said that now that is special. Thanks Miguel. You're the best man
That is really I guarantee you the guys across the street aren't gonna be doing that
You can be damn sure that Sid Rosenstein grants burger shorts. He ain't doing that
They're sitting around fat and sassy now. We're gonna have big trend. We had it
It wasn't something first of all and believe me and ain't gonna happen again
Hi there you
bruh
still
Hi there bothered by those pesky religious fanatics
Excuse me have you made peace with the ultimate supreme being?
Leave me on!
Yes, you could try blowing them up
Pardon me sir, but did you know that your moral soul is in danger?
But think of the mess not to mention those legal fees. That's why we at Lingham Labs have developed Jehovah Way
The clean simple way to rid yourself of those annoying acolytes
Jesus
Knock it off!
Where are we?
What are we doing here?
Man, I gotta get a life too!
Yes, Jehovah Way proven safe and effective and for those annoying encounters at the airport
It's new travel-sized Jehovah Way
Hi, they're Christmas! Christmas Christmas!
Hey, where do I get the stupid clothes and what's my hair? My hair!
Yes, Jehovah Way, little spray that keeps fanatics away
Look for it in the pest control section of your local hardware store
Okay, 118 at 560 WQ I am the mystery continues
I went on the sonic thing myself just out of curiosity and I typed in Miami, Florida
And anywhere there's nowhere within 10 miles according to that
Then we get this back from Tracy and the king of one of our regular friends who says
I don't know the exact address but there's a sonic burger on Biscayne just north of downtown
Just out of the new times building, have a great day, you two Tracy
So there's two sonic stuff we got here and we get better check it out
The one in North Miami at 149.75 Dixie Highway
I mean it's entirely possible that maybe they disappeared and maybe these are new locations again
Possible or not as the case may be but I will say this
At least got us off those stupid cliches and expressions that we're getting 80 million phone calls about
What was it on Biscayne?
It doesn't have an address, she says there's a son for you are really something because there's a checkers on 1650 Biscayne Boulevard
Yeah
Maybe they're seeing checkers and thinking it's sonic because you know as we all know Tracy's not all there
Well, what does that mean? I think he's confusing Tracy with Tammy. Oh, I apologize and I apologize Tracy's a sweetheart for you
It's been nice knowing you man
But you got 10 female listeners and friends about eight of them they got you know an IQ larger than their thumbnail
And he's ripping Tracy. I think they're both going to come over and kill him cool good
She said is a sonic burger on Biscayne just north of downtown just out of the new times building we'll find out from this crowd WQA and hello
Yeah, speak to me speaking
Neil yeah
How about you can't make a
We're done with that crap. Okay WQA and hello
And the how you doing okay sir? There is a sonic on southwest 104th Street just
of us one
104th Street Southwest just east of us one in the candle area that is correct
Maybe Josh calls
Information and says give the red the phone number to sonic on south goes on in 4th Street names crazy. He may get it
He may get it you may get the phone number and be able to
Lay this just to be the rough. Okay. Thanks pal. You got it. Okay. There you go call up
411 if you can handle that
Take your finger off the food they call it finger food. He's fingering it
Take the finger off the food log it up to a stick it in the phone. They're called 411 ask for sonic. Where did he say?
104th wherever where he said
Maybe you're something maybe there's a bunch of them and they just aren't on their website yet
Maybe they just from open maybe they replace some of the old checkers with some right I mean this guy sounded lucky and IQ
Larger than this thumbnail. He sounded legit sounds legit to me sounds like a human being right WQA and hello
Is it Neil? It is
Neil how you doing? I've been listening to you guys for 20 years. Love to show excellent. Good taste
Hey, the closest sonic I know of is in Arcadia. Extern year in Arcadia. There's a good one there. That's where the nut houses too
Hey, yeah one more thing. Yep
Cali shake my humming. I fuck
Yeah, right. Good bleep there too by the way not
I even hit it again. This is me on the safe side. We all did. Oh, yeah
Anyway, so we got Tracy with the one and then Steve said is one of North Miami and this other guy said there's one in Kendall
I think there's a sonic at every street corral. Oh, if you ask me
I
Sure hope at least it's like CS one of those things. You know like your hope. It's lucky used to be you know
Yeah, it's really good if people are all the effort to find it WQA and hello
Neil yes, sir the one that's on dick the highway
140 something or another long gone gone about
Eight ten years now really yeah, it became a
Jamaican place, you know how the neighborhood is. Oh, no. Oh, yeah, but you should know anything that's
good in South Florida as a blast that is that is correct look at flood rockers look at
Some of the other chain. Oh, are be um hardy, you know, right on uh-huh, you know
So yeah, I kiss that one goodbye. I know there's one of four peers. There's one in Naples
See in South Florida, they can only have things that you can you can gum you can't you have to don't need to have teeth to eat them
Well, let's just go and get the next blender that's on sale at RJ. Okay. Take care
Yeah, Apple sauce doing how about a take out apple sauce to be good. Oh, oh all much
Yeah, I mean you don't have to build a drive for these the senior citizens will build one for you
Everything that you can gum over there you could have apple sauce
So what I'm most sexy highway
I wouldn't be wasting my time going over there because this guy said it's long gone like like somebody that
The good things in South Florida used to be what video they probably bailed out just like I did
So that one's gone, but then we got the one in Kendall there, you know, and now did you call up?
He's on the phone now he's on the phone right now getting the address and finding out the exact location if there really is a sonic burger
You'll hear it first right here, man
Are you sure
Well, one exciting week. I was started Monday with a 1500 and some odd votes and just about shattered the I mean shattered the world record
And out of the day we got this sonic business. Okay, which
Quite frankly didn't everybody think that they were long gone now. What's the story Chris? You like yeah
411 has no sonics listed at all in date or Broward County
Well that's that
Well, that's the guy talking about Tracy's got this one here. Maybe people are remembering sonics that were there
You know yesterday
But these are people who live there see
Like Tracy actually lives in this guy to call the
Yeah, so Kendall 104th I drive Kendall a lot. I don't remember seeing a sonic at all
And you know this man would remember a sonic if he saw oh
Oh, I'm gonna pop it. We got to go to the canes after this. I'll check 104th in Kendall
Well, but we're jealous. Oh, well, hey McGell you better
Tell him to forget about it, but bring me back a bacon cheeseburger anyway
Oh, man
Bring one back from the AW you know here. We got everybody all whipped up and we thought we really had our
Our finger on it so to speak focus says they have them in Orlando. Well, let's go to Orlando. I'm on my way now Q a.m
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. What about the big one that got away. Yeah, okay. W Q a.m. Hello
A meal
Yes, there is no
Sonics and day County this like you've been said, bro
I drive all over day county every single day. There's no sonic that was there on way 60 highway
It's left in 1997
1997 brother. Sorry, man. Love you, Neil
Thanks for the bad news palies. Thanks
So there you go. We're doing a little investigation. It's where I work on here
We're saving some people a lot of drive around when it be something to make your plans to like go ahead dinner
There's something tonight and then you drive over there and there's like a big empty lot
I'll tell you what else I wonder if it's still there
You know what that was that diner. There was the first McDonald's in Florida
Right on a biscane boulevard. I know that when you're talking about with the
The very famous diner that was been there for a zine years and they're both gone right the brown derby
What are you talking about making a joke? No, you know the diner I'm talking about yes
Very famous place and and the McDonald's there was the first one in the state
And I had actually gone through there you know, gone through the drive through there a few times 100 years ago
That's long gone
And and you're telling me that it's not interesting reminiscing about the places that are gone at least we at least we do a pubic service until the audience
Don't go there. It's not there. No, no, don't go there man
You're wasting your time and you're very expensive gasoline and thank you mr. President for that very inexpensive
Vaseline so we misunderstood
We thought that a guy was saying thank you for the low prices on gasoline and it's Vaseline
Because that's what this is about synopsis are doing to us all don't send five pages of sonic maps from university dodgy
maniacs
What what does that mean why are they doing that?
What do you mean why?
Because they can no more so what are the maps to tell you not here
They don't exist the closest one is like in the Orlando Melbourne
Oh
How to stress again depressing everybody was all whipped up into a frenzy about this it was like all good times
Maybe good times. I'm gonna play that theme just to piss you off
And there ain't no sonic no mo well
Just like that song by bill withers ain't no sunshine anymore. Remember that depressing to go withers
He did lean on me. Yeah, he was depressing like Bobby Goldsboro
All those suicide records, you know, and if you and if they weren't about suicide when they listen to me wanted to commit suicide
Mm-hmm 26 pants one so there's no signing in
Any mo
I'm a girl says he's turning around. Yeah turn around Miguel. Sorry. Thank you anyway pal. Thank you
Well, say the gas the gas Boston Armand Lake a guy like Miguel. I mean, you know, he's a good guy
But he can't afford to be wasted in half a decade gas just to drive down there in the sea. Oh, that used to be here like
What do you guys say 10 years ago? He's probably in the QA with Van anyways
He's probably sitting in the parking lot
With somehow chick who's not his wife. Oh, I'm sorry. That's I that was a bad idea
27

Good what was it you heard me
I was visiting for some excuse me sorry
Old days
This town was once alive
They even had to regret
There were things to do all night
Broward and in day but the old fart walking dead and the power to let
The crooked wheels who just got off the boat I heard he'll ride your
This is the day that Miami died
The best for the one who brought us home
Through Miami
Then you believe there was a time
They had casinos and hallendale
Oh my god try to organize the crime
But the experiment had failed when the brain did gave you down and door the false of sound
They pissed along the plate
It's a big cut in the screen
I heard the old Rogers
Oh well
I'm touching it baby
Well, punch it again
Yeah, the day radio died how about a sequel to that brother
And here I thought there was no chance to be anything in that oh yeah
I don't know what oh yeah what
Burn me once I found out that there are those things usually come in
When you least expect that
I see
Well anyway I hit the thing 400 times if that's enough too bad
Here's the fact that says these guys these jokers are mistaking checkers for sonics
That's a checkers on 104th in Pinecrest
Not a sonic okay
I have no idea what the one that um oh and Chuck wants Tracy's picture on the website
No way Chuck just leave our listeners alone okay quick look into molest all of our listeners
Chuck says this is a great fact over him Chuck. He says this is really special
Last time I ate at sonic in Tampa. I had a double burger within
This is great with the minutes. I had violent diarrhea and I had to go to the bathroom
The sonic only was a drive-through we needless to say I went in my pants. Thank God they gave me a handful of paper napkins
I drove back the
And I drove back the next day to ask for my money back and they were closed
Said Chuck what a story how's it up to make you up Chuck
Oh, well maybe there's maybe there's a blessing in the skies there you see right
Speaking of stupid cliches. It's a blessing in the skies
There is no more sonic because it'll just go right through you like an h-bomb
Like a nuclear weapon in your kishkis. Well, so there you go wait we tried
And for just a couple of times there for a couple of moments see that anything really good like that in the food in the area food man
A lot of good stuff that's come to town though, especially fast food things chains like that
Mm-hmm, and they they just you know if it's at least it all solid like if there's any real meat in it
You know then you require actual teeth to chew it. It probably can be around too long
Which is kind of sad
WQIM sonic line hello
Hey
Yeah, yeah, you don't listen
I know that I'm anti-plotive said that impeachment was off the table
But just hearing the start of Mrs. Plains the testimony
You know, I want to know what's going through this woman's mind
The only thing that she sure said was she has no idea how many of her contacts were killed worldwide
And the extent of a damage that Carl Robin arrested a bushman to dip towards this country
That's her major thing was a weapon to match the stuff
No, okay pal. I'll call Nancy right now until I pass it along you if there it
I mean, what what do you want me to do about it?
So I mean everyone like fix it. Oh, I'm gonna okay. I'll fix it on Monday
Let's rest up over the weekend. Let's drive around looking for sonic burgers
And then once we get a good rest and a good meal on our perfect then then we can roll in like Ross furrows is roll up your streams and do new do
Lift up the hook that engine and get out the old studies and do do do
I think I sonic man. He did did did
He do did it Q.A.M. Hello. Yeah, listen tell me all that the closest
Uh, Sonic is in Melbourne. Okay. I looked it up on my GPS
You're positive now. Yes, sir. I am okay. Thank you. What you want the address? I give it to you now
Well, no we're not going to Melbourne. I'll go into that
Okay, thank you closest Sonic is in Melbourne. So I get my car right now. It's 130 in the afternoon
You can be up there by a rush hour time
You fill it up and then the way like I said bring up some depends like the astronaut like the lady astronaut
I bring a whole bunch of depends because from what Chuck said it might might be kind of interesting drive home, you know
So I'm gonna Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, what's up, Neil? I'm the topic of a restaurant attrition in South Florida
Yes, there was a place called cheeseburger and paradise that opened up in the fashion mall
It was right next to bone fish grill, which I really don't care much for
It had great burgers. It was real cheap. I'm using nice atmosphere
He listed after about eight months the places shut down because they shut down the whole fashion mall
And I've not heard any plans of the place reopening. So
It's another one of the great restaurants that just disappears in his car for the course man
Typically, I never go on pally thanks for the bad news man
Well, let's South Florida for you can't complain about the taste in tongue as there isn't any, you know
Not saying there aren't any good restaurants left because that would be really a stupid and bad thing to say
There are some but a lot of the places that we used to love man long gone
Long gone including sonic evidently all gone
And let me ask you this
Since it's the same ownership. Why is it that people are getting checkers confused?
Oh with sonic like Tracy am I
I'm gonna lay out same kind of sign? I don't know
Same kind of sign that says what this is sonic and over on the kidding. It's really checkers like that
There's no it is. They're spelling it wrong. Oh, so KERS right sokers
I wonder how Bob Soaker is doing
Remember our good old weatherman Bob Soaker are ready from channel seven wonder how is he doing still fat probably
W.A.M. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, I'm a son of a there's a
There's a place on Griffin Road. It's where he has to yilvin Boulevard. It's called. Oh, yeah, uh, W.A.M. Hello
Neil. I'm yes, Neil. I've never heard so much misinformation in my life
Checkers and and sonic are not the same company. It was checkers and rallies. Oh rallies. Oh rallies
Those were the and checkers is garbage
Sonic used to be down there used to be a location where you said on North Miami Beach or on
Dixie highway. They used to be one in Davie
Um on Nova Drive. There used to be one in Kendall and I think there was one in homestead
Neil used to weigh 360 pounds believe me. I know my junk food
Here is that this is a guy we can trust. They are long gone since about the mid 90s mid to late 90s
They're all gone
They're in other parts of Florida just like hardies is long gone and there are other parts of Florida
Hardies and water burger which is also another good chain. They have in Tampa area Orlando and the pan handle not down here
Um, but sonic is long gone from here whether the lever tried to come back. I don't know
But this is an area that you know, I don't have to tell you you're long gone too
No, but there's been a lot of misinformation. There used to be sonic's here. They are gone
Thanks pal. This is the voice and the body of experience. Well, I'm no longer that quite that body only 260 now
I'm not congratulating. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Okay
Well, he's probably glad because it sounded me like he liked sonic and he's glad they're gone because he would know
Like with Chris it's good thing that it's not there because Chris would be if that one in Kendall was
Still open down here. You'd be stopping there tonight two three four times. Oh, yeah, sure
Guarante you wouldn't be going there. I mean, I went there a couple times. It wasn't like a push. I went out of my way to go to
Oh, Tracey and Kendall says thanks Chris. I was wrong. I was thinking sonic, but it is checkers
We still love you Tracey. You're the best
I was wrong. It's amazing how we're getting misinformation from some of our most trusted correspondents today
Which is of course, which is good because it's helped to kill a whole hour here
But no mole you might like sonic but it ain't round no mole
Just like him
Now what's all just happening or don't tell me I knocked the thing that's the audition line again. I hate when I get so animated
David that I just
Clang on that thing and knock it off the
I went for new systems
I was thinking about losing weight
I stepped on the scale and I got a measure and say
We said we need a mister is always so much that we can do
I think life was searching for me the only thing for you
I'm certain of my fighting on the right
I'm sorry
I don't have to
I don't have to go and dance
I don't have the worry about no
Vogue is around my fuzz
Because life was such you know
I'm a brand new man
Look up the mover
Fuck the fat out of splash you can't
Fuck the fat out of my baby
You can't suck the cell you bleed
Something bad off my head
Hey, suck the way you're around me
I'm not going to step on the fat all the time so anyway sonic forget about it
It's long gone ain't no sonic and date ain't no sonic and brown or ain't no sonic and Palm Beach
Ain't no sonic no mole anywhere near any of you folks unless you listen, you know
Listen on the internet. Mm-hmm. No dropouts today. All right
Let's see here's an email on my mind space from somebody says jordanos jino's east and the others are all okay
To very good but lu malnades and
Duay are the best of the best
lu malnades and pizzeria duay
Says I agree with the people who say that pizzeria duay and jodanas can be inconsistent
But then malnades is consistently good. It says don't go to any of the suburban locations
Which are essentially franchises and where quality can be can very wildly to put it mildly
Widenly to put it mildly always go to the mother church location to get the real thing
Thanks very much whoever said that in for them
So the deal is the real deal the real deal no punches pude is
The lu malnades and pizzeria duay
Uno duay train pizzeria train pizzeria quattro and yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda
So that was pretty exciting about all that sonic stuff, huh? Yes, it was but mystery salt boy. We're like the Scooby-Doo gang
Oh
Man, that was a zelma, huh?
So how's the goani?
Yeah, that's what I thought you said well at least we got off this stupid thing with these clichés anyway
There was a great there was a great sonic. Oh, it was super sonic
That's the way I would look at it when you say a little bit
I'm positive that I never ate there, you know, I'm a just it just I mean I know I know what it looked like
Because I remember having seen him what back in the day, you know, when I was there when I was forced to be there
But I'm just positive. I never ate there
Thousand ninety-one votes on the pool. I'm not going to a&w after the show, but I doubt it
Well, they have the diet route here now, right? They do
But they saw the story as soon they have it at the restaurant a&w makes diet route here
Well, yeah, like in a real supermarket. Mm-hmm
I don't really go to the real supermarket that often I have two of them very easy walking business if I want so lazy
But it's just so much easier to go to like here. That's why they call it convenience store means everything is priced triple the ordinary price and you don't have to go too far
lazy
The dumbest expression that people say is I hate this pulls down to 18.8% let's hear it
Not bad
I hate this full toy
Well, our goal was to get under 20% which was really scandalous and obnoxious two shakes of a lamb's tail 128
Well, that would be good to order exotic two shakes and a lamb's tail if they have that
I didn't have great milkshakes too. I
I don't recall ever having one there
I
Thought that's one of the things they were really famous for the long. I'm sure
What do you say Chris? Well Chris never went to Sonic. Did you yeah a couple times?
You didn't know it's not too excited about it where the shakes is good as stake in shake. I don't think I ever had a shake there
The stake the shakes at stake in shake are absolute phenomenal phenomenal not good sensational. They're okay
