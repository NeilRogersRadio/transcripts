Need some more level on here Chris
B.A.B.
For a lot of the
Need some more level of being nice
Are you know what the hell is going on
If I put up any hire
I will push off the board
That was their level
It's all very loud
It's Friday
You're fast
You're marveled at dancing with a star
You loved skating with a star
And now prepare to B.A.B.
It's Twister with a star
Okay, Joey Patone
Left hand on blue
I can't reach
Joey, your other left hand
Twister with a star
Your favorite flexible celebrities
All tangled up in one crazy competition
Heather Mills
Left leg on yellow
Oh yes, I think I can
Yes, yes, there it is
Hey wait, no fair, she's using her stop
Just when you thought we went out of stupid celebrity reality competitions
We'd drag out the plastic mat and cardboard spinner board
Twister with a star
John O'Hirley
Looks like the right leg on green was you're undoing
Ah yes, unfortunately I now have a severe grind for
But to be all tossing up with one Paulina Poroskaba was well worth it didn't do
Don't miss them, not enough nuttiness
Till night on Twister with a star
Well, the vendors they got that in their job
Okay, they killed them, they murdered them
Yep, destroyed them and the slime ball, scum bucket
Why wouldn't call them murder?
Well, he'd like to be
At any rate, that's the big story
Although I'm sure Chris wants to hear about the Patriots getting fined because you're jealous
You know, the same jealousy of the dolphin parents
You bet, right? I'm officially
New England Patriots were fined $250,000 and could have to give up a first round draft choice
After NFL Commissioner Roger Videll decided to the team broke NFL rules
Even though everybody does it
By video taping an opponent on the field during last week's game against the New York Jets
Even though every other team in the league does it and they admit it and never less
Patriots coach Bill Bollochek was personally fined $500,000 as well
Half a million bucks Chris
Not to help them out
No, I think you should set it all to me
The Patriots were caught having a video assistant taping the defensive signals of New York Jets
While on the field of play, direct violation of NFL rules
The tape was confiscated and sent to the NFL
But the league rule that because the tape was seized in the first quarter
It had no bearing on the outcome of the game
Ha ha ha ha ha ha, alright
No kidding
Oh brother, that said, Kudell came down hard on the Patriots and continues his stance
Of punishing harshly those who break the rules set forth by the league
While his come down hard on players like Pac-Man Jones and Michael Vick
Pac-Man Jones, is he kind of Coco Crisp?
Yeah
But Elis also now shown to crack down on organizations and even coaches who break the rules
Bill Bollochek opposes us for what he termed the embarrassment, distraction and penalty his mistake caused
Although it again, Billy Boy, don't do it again because then Chris will be saying,
Raaah, I think she, they cheat, nah
Exactly, that's what you'll be saying because you're a crybaby
And if you're going to be a dolphin, you have to be a crybaby
Here's the schedule for today speaking of dolphins
We got that all asses in there but only at 7 o'clock tonight
We got Mad Dog at 2, the power hour with Mad Dog and Henry Goldberg at 4 o'clock
Hank, all by himself, 5 to 7
Miami dolphins all access, this is our dolphins infomercial between 7 and 8 35 followed by the Marlins game
Any interest?
No
A little teeny tiny interest?
No
For 10 for us
A dolphin pregame shows, I mean the Marlins, 8 35, 905, the Marlins have Colorado to play their Rockies in a very pivotal game
Not
Here's the pull result from yesterday
And don't forget if my phone rings I'm moving up and running the other room
I'll cue something up
Yeah
Oh, I'll just spin some wax
That's what I mean
Oh, I see, screw something up
Wouldn't be the first time
1226 votes on the pull yesterday and I just go and brand it all by the way Charlie B is back for those people interested in the polls
Which there aren't too many
And Charlie sends me an emotional email this morning about he was on a three week vacation
And Yadi, Yadi, Yadi, Yadi and how he got such a big kick out of us yesterday wondering where the hell is Charlie B
Where all the polls?
And then he starts out by sending a couple of really crappy polls
I realize you're out of practice Charlie, but the stuff you send in I wouldn't wish it on Paul and Ron
You know that's what you send in
Brandon is taking your role
You know, first it was Sean against Charlie B and that's Brandon against Charlie B and Brandon sent me a couple of decent ones
And this was his
What is the most emasculating thing for a guy?
1226 votes
Having a girl tell your family or friends that your size is inadequate
364
Teeny tiny
Being impotent 176
You know this the first two both have to do with your penis
What?
Having Neil Rogers kick your ass 151
I said penis I don't want to say it again because Joyce will get all upset
Joyce just got a problem
I remember the day that Clarence came in was a Clarence or Duff
No it was Clarence because Duff wasn't PD back in the Joyce date
And he said Joyce has a problem with penis
That was the line too
That was exactly what he said
That's what I don't know that
Most emasculating thing for a guy having Neil Rogers kick your ass 151
Being raped by a guy 122
Carrying your wife or girlfriend's purse 106
How sweet
Having your girl kick your ass 104
Buying tampon 77 with George is admitted to doing
Sure
Why not having a gay guy kick your ass 37
Being raped by a girl 35
Spending a day alone with your mother-in-law 29
Being seen crying 20 and being sterile got only five
I mean that's yeah we can't blame you for that
It's an act of nature it's an act of a guy
I feel good
That's what it is
585 vote on today's pool
Well this isn't a pool it's the survey
And you know something that's pretty weak
Although it did go up there late my fault it's my bad
I was busy yesterday I was involved in buying a car
Thank you
Not for you
Yeah if I was buying a car for Chris
Go to one
Yeah
587 tally so far which is very very embarrassingly weak
Ethnic survey which of these are you I know we did the demographic one
Early in the week and that's what they're going to say
You're sending it in you're mailing it in the it's another one of those ethnic polls
Yeah right
Whatever
It's kind of interesting even George said it was interesting
He usually hates the polls so
No I just hate coming up with them and carrying them up
Ethnic survey which are you Anglo male non-Hispanic of course
409 almost 70%
And of course even if you're like Jewish that makes you an angler in the South Florida
Which I always find most amusing
Hispanic male 72
That's not so bad 12.2%
Right
Because we know there's a lot more who won't admit it
Subhuman 42 now George asked me this morning before the show
Why did you put that on there?
Right human
In other words you just gave something for the smartasses to vote
Right
I would have to give the smartasses nothing to vote for
Until I'm Haba Bama and Dread like you say
Haba Bama
Sub-Baba Bama Human Subhuman 42
And I believe it too Subhuman
Anglo female 33 Black male 19
Hispanic female
So am I take quite a while only for Hispanic females my God
So far anyway
Native American male 3
Engines Native Americans
Now let me ask you something do Native Americans
I guess it depends on the person but
Do they are resenting called engines?
I guess you'd yeah it depends on the person you got to act something
Only if you're a
And they resented a lot
Anyway Native American male 3 Black female 3 Asian female 1 Asian male 1
And Native American female none
No papoos
No papoos is the little baby on the back right?
Right
Over that we just got one
We just got a Native American female 1
Just came in 599
Hey we got a wall we should have put that on there
They love that
So there's the survey we're taking the course with only 595 on there
That indicates things are really rough
Rough red and sore
So here's the big story that they were hyperventilating about all day yesterday
Just filming at the mouth and rightfully so I guess
The man suspected of killing one day
Cop and wounding three others in the shootout yesterday morning was cornered and shot dead
In a Pembroke Pines condo complex sometime before midnight
Dave Mayor Carlos Alvarez and police director Robert Parker speaking at a news conference
Told reporters police had shot Sean Sherwin-Labit at Heron Pond condos
305 Southwest 85th Avenue
He was armed with a loaded weapon
And had additional ammunition said Parker was said to be was wearing body armor
He had the mindset of surviving your confrontation with law enforcement Parker added
Police learned if the beats were about to lay through
It's interesting that yesterday they had the wrong guy's name and the wrong picture
Because of the wallet that was left
You know when they're kind of interesting and they showed the wrong picture of the wrong guy
Yeah, we're looking for you all
I did not know that even though he's some guy in Jacksonville
Police learned if the beats were about to lay through
They sent a special team of heavily armed officers to the condo complex
When the team of officers arrived they spotted chased and curried a beat by the apartment complex pool
The deadly drama that took place at the apartment complex brought to an end an exhausting emotional day for police and the public
That began early yesterday with the routine burglary detailing South-aid
What happened next was anything but routine
One day the officer was shot dead three wounded a massive man hundred cross-off
Throwed a dangerous killer on the run for hours caught and shot Dave
This is a very sad day for us Alvarez said during an emotional press conference
Some crucial details were made unclear but based on interviews and preliminary forensic analysis
Several enforcement officials gave this account of the beats actions
Two officers spotted the suspect driving alone in an old Honda Accord near a housing development
It self-washed 280th street and 143rd court
The officers tried to stop the beat but he took off
Far from the man who did his girlfriend's house the officers called for backup
The girlfriend who was not identified showed up to the same time as police and the beat
From inside the house police say the baby opened far through a window with an assault rifle possibly an 8K-47
Strecking some a honor 37 delivered in date and in the neck and kill him
LeBeth and ran out of the house to take this brief shot some honor again before bolting for his car firing wildly
The other officers now arriving at the scene the man didn't hesitate to shoot Alvarez said
Officer Jodie Wright 31 was shot in the leg her knee shattered
She shouted into her radio officers were downed and helped
Bullets graze the other two officers Carlton 34 and Tomas tuned into her 37
Police say LeBeth sped away with the officers in pursuit
He cranked into a fence along the Black Creek Canal at Southwest 129th Avenue 203rd street jumped out of the car
Apparently ditching his weapon which police recovered and disappeared on foot
Afraid to leave some a honor officers picked him up and drove him out of the development of the squad car
Paramedics pronounced the officer dead
A team was across his street from where at least one of the officers was shot gave the hero of an account of the incident
That missions with initial police conclusions the 15-year-old said she had run outside after a grandmother said
Police were pointing her gun at a woman she said she saw a car out from her the driver's side to open
A woman was in the passenger seat and two children in the back
She said the woman got out grabbed the children ran into the house just before the shooting started
I heard somebody say daddy know like a little girl. That's when they started shooting
The shooting came from inside the house across the street
She said as soon as she heard the shots she ran inside her own house and watched from the front window
I saw the police officer lying on the ground she said I think he shot out the window because there were holes in the window where the officer was laying
Within minutes police began swarming the scene in the surrounding neighborhood and searching one house
They stumbled upon an indoor marijuana farm
Oh my god
Wow
Good thing you weren't down there
Right?
Doing a little business
Streets and local highway exits were closed to seal off escape routes causing nightmarish traffic backups and keeping residents from their homes into the night
Cars were stopped trunk search
The search later extended to Broward County who were police believed the suspect whose mother lives in Margate might head
Police erected then dismantled a cordon around that neighborhood but remained stationed outside the house end of the night
For hours police misidentified the suspect
The first bullet and they should shortly before noon describe the heavy-set white male
Soon afterward police received an auto tag the belonging man who they mistakenly believed owned the Honda
Driven by the shooter then they released another aeronious identification
Kevin Wainer 30 this time with a photograph
Wow at about four p.m. police identified a labi 25 is the correct suspect
They said a second photograph had released earlier identified as Wainers was in fact labi
And that's what he's feeling right now kind of labi as in dead
So there you go another nightmarish and crazy people with guns especially with assault weapons which the Republicans love
They just can't get enough AK-47s and all kinds of wild weapons to suit the right way the gun nuts the NRA
Remember what the NRA were saying they said well one boy's gets in we're gonna have our own that's right next to the in the oral off
Remember that that's what they were saying and they had a good point
What biggest name?

So keep yourself some hardware and both the other fellow away now
They've all got guns guns guns up there on the streets to pay
They've got guns up there on the streets to pay
They've got a music sheet brought it into show in town now
So in town
Billy Brothers love you and pretty expensive to sell now
So now it's much of a sell
They can bear as a feature angel in them out before the bell bell
Now they've got guns guns guns out there on the streets to pay

And now they carry away
So what if Johnny can't read he can still join the NRA night
Don't hit that gun, gun, gun, gun, pick it all for each other
Waitations, please, and you have all got guns guns guns up there on the streets to pay
They've got a music sheet brought it into show in town now
So what if Johnny can't read he can still join the NRA night
Don't hit that gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, pick it all for each other
But during the course of history of human events
The fact that anybody ever invented guns in the first place
Should be a pretty good commentary on the human race, shouldn't it?
I mean, that's a little bit too deep and too philosophical, isn't it?
Yeah, it's actually on the Friday
They invented the pointy stick so you know
Pointy stick was a good start and they should just stuck it, you know what I'm saying?
But don't continue where?
His jokes will get very upset
Six hundred twenty nine people of a tallied and unmarried were at least we got somebody in every category but not all that many
Pretty weak
I remember once upon a time when we had an audience
Remember those days boy, it was sure there was a lot of time ago but still I remember
Yeah, well they don't seem to care about that
We're not into audience, we're not into promotion, we're not into like a radio, we start
We're into ratings, no God forbid, we're into spots
Spots, we lot, spots
Oh yeah, if you've got some money, so we'll do you spot
Former Republican Congressman Mark Foley, gay
Who's emails and instant messages caused an uproar and became the butt?
Blackdum of a thousand jokes might have scored yet again, says ha ha ha ha
Boy, who wrote this, on the raw story?
Well, he's pretty raw
According to ABC, Florida laws may spare the congressman because of the state's three-year statute limitations
Florida did not start a criminal investigation of Foley until November 2006
Making it nearly impossible to prosecute an explicit instant message fully sent away
17-year-old high school student in 2003. Who's to blame?
House leadership for one who had knowledge of folies in appropriate behavior for years.
The emails originally leaked out of the Office of Representative Rodney Alexander, Republican
Illusion, a Democrat-comer-publican who changed parties in 2004.
But the untold story is that the media too had a hand in protecting folie.
They had a hand in it. I can't tell you where, but...
Backdome seems to be really busy. I don't like the guy that he was called with all the stuff.
Remember every day? I have two parakeets and 16 gidgings in my ass.
Remember that guy? Yeah.
The messages first crossed the desk of the St. Pete Times in 2005,
raw stories also were through various sources that ABC had elements of the folies
story a year prior to the article's release.
The critical instant message conversation cited by a law enforcement, however,
didn't emerge until after ABC published their story.
In August 2006, Harper's Magazine also admitted they received the first batch of
over-friendly emails a month earlier. Overly, friendly. Right.
St. Pete is the Bertam executive editor near Brown. Defendant is decision not to run the
folie story. After they received creepy messages from a Louisiana page in which
folie was seeking to photograph.
I led deliberations with our top editors. We concluded we didn't have enough
substantiated information to reach beyond Inuendo Brown wrote in an October 2,
2006 editorial. We couldn't come up with a strong enough case to explain to a teenager's
parents why over their vehement plans to please to drop the matter, we needed to make
their son the subject of the story and the incredible scrutiny that would sure follow.
It ended up to this conclusion, Brown. I did the print what we had seemed to be a shortcut
to taint a member of Congress that went on actually having the goods.
Oh my god. Can I read that last sentence again?
Talk about quadruple in you window. To print what we had seemed to be a shortcut to taint
a member of Congress without actually having the goods.
Wow. Lane Hudson, the former human rights campaign staffer who first posed the emails online,
they posting what's for a ABC and a running of story, said he wasn't surprised.
The fact that folie is getting away with it is symptomatic of how things work in
Washington Hudson said Republicans in Congress knew about it for years and did nothing about it.
The FBI did nothing about it and the media failed its responsibility to properly investigate it.
By the way, my phone is not going to ring.
They're already rang and she left me a message.
All right nice. Yep.
My friend from State Farm. I love State Farm by the way.
Can I say that? I don't know if they advertise on the station but I do like that a lot.
Well what? I said I don't know if they have.
Well I just did say that.
All right.
For the first time, Brown, well maybe they'll give me a better deal now.
For the first time, Ross Story will also have been having had the email exchange
between folie and a mail page prior to ABC's publication.
This site didn't receive the emails until roughly a week prior to ABC's release and was
unable to acquire a second source to publish the story.
We didn't have the more explicit I.M.
conversations and now folie probably will get away.
Barring any extraordinary circumstances, it's very unlikely for charges to be filed in a case
once the statute limitations has run its course.
I.A. Groober.
Or is that grubber as in grubber Tuchas?
I.A. Groober a former federal public defender and professor of law at F.I.U.
told ABC News.
I shouldn't have said grubber Tuchas.
That's bad. That's fat ass.
Federal officials turned the case over to Florida after concluding that folie did not engage in
any actual sexual conduct until the former pages had turned 18 and therefore not violated federal law.
Washington, EC Law defines the age of consent as 16.
How do you like that?
Florida Law stipulates that using the Internet to seduce solicit,
Laura were entice a minor to commit any illegal act relating to lootless or indecent exposure
as a third degree felony, this would include email and instant messages, instant massages.
Mike Rogers, the gay blogger who first suggested folie was gay on his website blog active,
also said the media had failed.
Mike Rogers is the same guy that was outing Larry Craig long time ago.
You know the toe tap and Larry?
Once again, the mainstream media spailed in its role in a great democracy, said Mike Rogers,
despite even being constitutional protectors to produce pursued stories,
the papers in Florida not only protected a political career,
most likely so they could have continued access to congressman folie,
but they stood in the way of reporting a crime.
With a statute of limitations passed, the blame for markfulties escaped from the law,
squarely falls on the heads of the newspapers that had this evidence.
The House, led by Democrats, has also stomped Florida's investigation,
lawyers for the Chamber of Blocked Investigators access to folies computers,
saying they were the equivalent of congressional papers which only folie could release.
The action followed on the heels of what was later ruled an unconstitutional invasion
and representative William Jefferson's House office in a robbery inquiry.
That's representative Jefferson L.
I called cash in the freezer.
ABC was the first report that I'll tell you what,
if you keep your cash cash in the freezer, it's unlikely to get stolen.
Wouldn't you think?
I imagine that's a good one.
ABC was the first report the action by the House's lawyers,
folie resigned hours after more troubling messages,
but former congressional pages became public by ABC on September 29, 2006,
proving beyond a shadow of a doubt not only was he gay,
but he was also a pedophile or trying to be anyway.
Well, he was grooming them until they became legal agent.
Oh, let's have a birthday party, and I like that.
According to media bistro, ABC news,
and maybe I could cater the birthday party.
I could pay for it anyway.
All right.
According to media bistro, ABC news, the blotter,
which sparked the investigation that exposed luteants to the message
sent by Republican congressman,
remarked folie to a congressional page,
and rocked Congress.
While the 2007 National Headliner Award for Television Affiliated Online Journalism
forwards reporting on the scandal, how do you like that?
ABC news, the blotter,
well, there you go.
It's all old stuff.
Nobody in his fault potatoes now.
Now that we got Larry Craig to kick around,
648 people have touted in there on our survey.
Ethnic survey, which are you anglo-male non-Hispanic,
443, 68.3% Hispanic male 81, 12.5%.
That's not bad.
Whatever that means.
I mean, that's everybody under what?
50 words to cut off when they don't.
I haven't done it.
I didn't do the thing with the ages on this one.
We already did that.
I don't want it all to get missing.
I'm so depressing.
Plus, we can do that one next week.
Who wants those old listeners anyway?
Whatever they are.
We knew.
Some human 47 will take anybody if they're breathing or close to it,
if they're still like a little warm.

A guest who's back in the news, George.
Oh, Jay.
Oh, good guess.
Oh, it was on CNN at end.
I know just moments ago.
Las Vegas Metro Police confirmed early this morning
that OJ Simpson was questioned in connection to a theft
at the Palastation Casino.
Remember the palastation?
No, that was the Imperial Palace, wasn't it?
Yes.
Oh, sorry.
Wrong one.
Wrong palace.
Police spokesman Jose Montoya said Simpson
was questioned about a hotel room
breaking at the Casino late Thursday night.
Montoya said the theft involved sports member
or media but offered no further details.
Oh, no.
Police said Simpson has been released
and has believed to be in Las Vegas.
He was supposed to give a deposition in Miami today
in a bankruptcy case involving his eldest daughter.
It was canceled because Simpson had told attorneys
he'd be out of town.
A news conference will be held later this morning,
it's a Fox five Vegas.
How do you like that?
He was supposed to give a deposition in Miami
to the day but he's in Vegas.
I wonder what he's doing in Vegas.
Certainly not gambling.
I hope not with the Browns and the Simpson's money.
An empty bag?
That would be gold.
What's his name?
That would be really bad.
Especially right after Russia's show
it would be messing with the goldman's money in Vegas.
Don't be plunging it away, OJ.
Six hundred and sixty-one people
are going to retaliate in an hour.
I think if we don't get to a thousand of the on this,
I mean this is just a survey.
That means we fold up our tent
and Georgia's going to be on our Monday.
Remember what I told you?
Yeah.
But I'm picking up that new car on Monday
and you know, you know,
you want to spin it around town.
Oh, I started telling you this yesterday, I think,
and I never got back to it.
It'll make you feel a little bit better
about being stuck in that right hole called South Florida.
If you think the driving there is bad,
you ain't seen nothing yet.
Sorry, I'll take it.
I'll lose my goose.
What?
I'll take it.
No, I'm done.
Tanya, you're wrong.
You assume and probably won't be so.
I assume that there couldn't possibly be any driving worse
than the swill that passes his driving in South Florida.
It's a picnic compared to what's going on here.
I'll take it.
First of all, there's five million people here
and there aren't enough roads.
There's one major east-west highway
the Garden of Expressway and that's it.
I mean, it's just ridiculous.
And there's all these old Chinese people
who got the driver's license,
I think in a box of wantons and it's just amazing.
But nevertheless, not a good place to have a car.
Jewish holidays have collided with youth football out west
to Stephanie Horrath in the sunset.
And I wonder what ever happened to old Mike Horrath.
He used to be a channel six.
He was a photographer.
Remember Mike Horrath?
Nope.
Once upon a time, he sure looked good.
I'll say that he was a good guy.
Young Mike.
Maybe that's a long time ago.
What?
Maybe that's why you remember him.
And I know.
Because you look good, that's right.
I don't remember ugly people.
I mean, I do.
I remember some ugly people I'm trying to forget them though.
And of course, that's the motto of the right winners
is don't do who we do do what we talk about.
Is that what it is don't do who we're in?
The western communities football league
which draws about a thousand kids.
This is Wellington, by the way.
Scheduled practices during Russia, Shawna,
and games during Yumkipper, two of the holiest days
in the Jewish calendar and some parents are pissed off.
Oy!
Well, actually, it says in the Sun Central upset,
but I'm saying pissed off because we can still say it.
One of the very few things we can still say as in.
Pits off, it's neat, fired up when I hear someone say that.
Right, well, we're pissed off.
That you said that.
I'm shocked at the level of intolerance I'm receiving
from our foreign minority religion said,
Jeremy Slesher, whose eight-year-old son,
Jacob Rosenblum, is playing football for the first time
this year.
Well, guess what, Jeremy, you shouldn't be having your kid
handling that pig skin.
It's trache.
It's wrong with you.
It says my Jewish son shouldn't be afforded
the same opportunities as a Christian child playing football.
Give me the ball, give me the ball.
Most Saturdays the league, along with,
I guess it's our favorite Jewish athlete of all time,
and we don't have to be Sandy Kofax, is that correct Chris?
I'm not sure about Hank Greenberg and Al Rosen and Joel Horland.
What about Jack Inning?
Who?
Jake Feibler.
Like I said, our favorite, not our most incompetent,
our most inept.
How about Murray Rose?
He was a swimmer and in the 1802 Olympics,
he won about 85 gold medals of swimmer from our striker.
From down under, Murray Rose was Jewish and Christel
named Murray Rose, you know.
So anyway, we do it.
He was hot too, man.
Whoo!
But anyway, and what about the Mark Spitz?
Huh?
I don't want to get into work.
Most Saturdays the league, along with it's sisterly,
from Boyton Beach, convenes at Village Park and Royal Union
to play 30 football games.
Slusher said he asked that these September 22nd games
which fall on young Kiberbe moved to the following Sunday.
He was told the change wouldn't be made,
but that his son wouldn't be penalized
for missing games and practices during the holidays.
Mike Pignato, the league's president, declined to discuss the situation,
didn't let it say it's difficult to reschedule game day
for all the teams.
Try getting 30 different groups of people,
20 on a team together, and all the referees and volunteers
that go with it, he said.
Pignato said he didn't know how many kids in the league are Jewish.
In emails to the slushes, Pignato said he received only one complaint
about the games scheduled on young Kiberbe.
He also wrote that the league would not schedule Sunday again.
What day is young Kiberbe, by the way?
It's next Saturday.
It's the 22nd, it's a week from tomorrow.
So what kind of a screwing is that?
That means I can't take off for young Kiberbe,
because everybody knows what a religious said,
you I'm going to go to Shul.
I'll drive there, because I'm Orthodox.
The village has gotten involved to its park and recreation for,
oh, I missed part of this.
Pignato said he received only one complaint about the games scheduled on young Kiberbe.
He also wrote that the league would not schedule Sunday games
because of intolerance to minority religions,
but because throughout my 50 years of existence,
some days have seemed to have a theme of family day
that involves all religions,
includes the lives of all interiors, board members,
all the referees who don't want to work on Sunday.
What about the people in the NFL?
That's what they want to do,
is they want to watch an NFL football.
Not fooling us.
The village has gotten involved to its park and recreation board
will meet tonight to consider a new policy that would for big games on the fields,
during its holidays like young Kiberbe,
Rajeshana Christmas and Easter,
said Jim Barnes, the village's leisure services director,
the policy is ordered to a staff policy
that's in place now from village run programs.
If the park board passes it,
the policy will go to the village council for approval.
The board means that 6 p.m. in the village hall
at 14,000 green bar are boulevard.
Barnes said it's the first time in his four years that the village
has this kind of conflict between holidays and sports has occurred.
Councilwoman Laura Cohen learned the problem
when some Jewish parents approached her about it,
her seven-year-old someplace football in the league.
I think it's brought to our attention
in an area we need to discuss as a council
and come up with a policy on it, said,
a Laura Cohen, and her brother Marty Cohen.
How many people we got on this thing here?
676.
I mean, you've got to understand, this is the entire audience.
And you wonder why we get no rational phone calls
while we're sitting here talking to ourselves like talking
into a tin can?
I don't wonder.
Is there any?
Yeah, like that.
What? Oh, you don't know, I don't wonder.
I don't need, I don't wonder either,
because I see Johnny Joe, he's still there.
He clears up Bell.
Go get his name.
Something best out of town.
This is my brother, I've got a Bell.
I'm a 60-year-old man.
Bill Bell.
Hey, fourth leader.
Third guy, f***ing blow!
This is Larry Craig calling.
You can reach me on myself.
All inspector is now willing to come out.
Larry Craig.
Republicans want you to go away.
I'm willing to fight.
What's your ego makes you try to stay?
No one believes in Larry Craig.
Stupidly.
We've reached shape ice-state for little bits.
I tried to have a man and heart to free.
Tired of all your hypocrisy.
Oh, Larry Craig, give up your seat.
If you have to go then just go best you don't stay.
He does my intent to resign.
I knew dead.
Something wrong you don't belong.
Now Larry Craig.
Larry Craig.
Give me into the turn, son of a-
I gave.
And I give up.
Your new office will be named of men.
No one believes in Larry Craig.
Hey Larry.
You're fair.
I'm going to sit on you.
You're up.
147 at 5.60 W.A.M.
13th Hill 11th on a Friday, September,
El Cautorsia, September.
When does people come back?
From, I guess, one.
Rainers from North, from Uranus, from outer space.
We've got to be back in our schools.
I'm not talking about those people.
I'm talking about like the snowbirds, you know that.
That's a good part of our audience.
Uh, neurocasting.
In case you haven't.
I'll let you know because they show up in Hollywood and drove as a prog.
Oh no, they drove.
They drove you.
You know something?
No.
I'll take it with you.
It's really going to be bad.
It's really going to be bad.
Now you're going to have, I don't know, it's good for you.
The frogs won't be coming because of the incredibly weak.
Now let me turn it around.
Let me think about the other way.
I guess, again, it works the other way.
The Canadian dollars are the 30-year high now thanks to George Bush and the trillion
dollars they've flushed down the toilet in Iraq.
And so now the Canadian dollar, the loony, is up to, let me take a puke at it here
on the business network.
And I'm going to scream.
I'll let out such a good shrie when I see it.
It was over 96 cents when I looked at it like, oh, geez, oh, that's not the right number.
Can you believe that?
So in other words, it's almost even Stephen.
Wow.
Is that pathetic or what?
Yeah, what?
No, no, 96.99, it's almost 97 cents.
Do you understand how devastating that is?
No.
So that means there's going to be a lot of frogs coming down there because they're
about to actually work something out.
You're going to be dead-yewed with frogs from Quebec.
Yeah.
Each being on Quebecer.
Boy, they are, like I said, the slime of the earth, the French.
I don't know what that's all about.
I hope we have some French people listening out there because believe you me,
we appreciate the fact you're listening, but we still can't sustain you.
And take your French and shove it.
God.
I'm serious.
If you walked in with a fistful of $1,000 bills into retail outlet Montreal,
if your body was covered with $1,000 bills and you didn't speak French,
they don't want to do business with it.
They don't even talk to you.
They don't want to know for me.
Well, that keeps it simple then.
Yeah, you just don't go there.
That's right.
697 people are listening.
That's a start.
That's our ethnic survey.
Which are you Anglo-Mail, non-Hispanic, 473, about 68%.
Hispanic, male, 87, 12.4%.
Subhuman 51.
We believe that.
So you don't like that being on there.
I think it's nothing.
What?
Should we take it off?
It's too late now.
It's never too late.
Although Cornelia's brother is insisting to roast it.
It's too late to remember back to me.
It's like the same as like I hate this poll or something.
You know.
It adds a little levity to it.
And otherwise very boring matter-of-fact kind of survey.
Without a lot of levity, it's not done.
What?
We could add a lot of levity then.
What does that mean?
We're going to put way more funny choices than just that on there.
All right, Eric, take it off of there.
But then that's going to bring us down to like 697.
You put it like I'm a cat, I'm a dog, you know, I'm an alien from another animal.
What about that?
Okay, well take some human off of there.
Eric will do it.
Anglo-Female 47, black male 23.
In other words, you're taking these polls very seriously even though you don't can't stand them.
Either you know, pick one, is it a survey or is it a joke?
Or is it just a joke?
Pick one.
Huh?
I'm picking one right now and we're going to have a-
Oh geez.
I can't tell you where to win it from, but you can imagine.
I'm back home.
Ooh.
Looked a little CD to me.
Anglo-Female 47, black male 24, Native American male 6, Hispanic female still only 4.
See if we take those 52 off of the sub-humans it's going to be bad.
But go ahead Eric, take it off of the weekend and let-
Hispanic female 4, black female 3, our ethnic ladies not too many.
Native American female only 1, Asian female and Asian male 1 apiece.
I'm thinking the Asian female might be Eric's wife you think?
Maybe.
I'm sure he already voted.
Why?
I'm sure he already voted from his household.
What does that mean?
You know you can only vote once per you know IP address.
The pool is down while Eric takes off sub-human and it's going to be embarrassing now.
It's gone.
Oh, it's gone already?
No, the pool is down, he's reworking it.
Oh I see.
Why do you say that?
Why do you just talk out of your ass?
Well, it's down.
It's down.
I mean I know Eric is very good, but it's going to take him like maybe 20, 30 seconds.
But 30 man.
I'll move that idiotic and then those 52 people maybe they'll have the co-hounds to come back on here
and tell us who they are instead of trying to be a bunch of smart-asses, okay?
Like the callers.
I called the other day and made a funny sound.
I hope yeah.
Remember that?
That was on my shirt.
That was Bobby.
I don't hear from Bobby anymore.
Almost into people on my face to be very honest with you, but who cares?
I hear from the important people.
I hear from the professor and Brandon and heard from Mike at FSU this morning, which I'll
get back to you one of these days, Mike, very soon.
He's a good kid.
Who else?
It's about it.
And then Sport and Hollywood, you depressing man, go away.
The people I am hearing from out there now, most of them I don't want to like Charlie be
again coming back.
We're glad to have you back, Charlie, but you're star with the polls, man.
I wouldn't wish those on anybody.
I would wish them on Joey Remmelts.
Well, look at that.
Eric did a fine job.
The only problem is now.
We're down to 654 folks on there.
Boy, we're going to be hard pressed against them.
The thousand of them I think.
And this is just a survey.
Now we'll do it.
You sure of that?
Yes.
Watchdog asks why Bush's kid brother is getting federal bucks.
Oh, no.
An independent watchdog, agencies asked the Department of Education to investigate why
President Bush's younger brother, Neil, has received money or mark for the President's
signature education initiative to sell a curriculum program that hasn't been subjected
to the rigorous evaluation of deserves.
Bunch of crooks, baby.
That's what it's all about.
A bunch of crooks, not just the Bush family, all the families.
The Rockefeller is the Kennedy's.
You name it.
All the families.
The Clintons.
Oh, no.
You can't say that.
I just did.
Neil Bush 52, who has no background whatsoever in education, found an ignite.
Ignite learning in 1999 with donations from his parents and a slate of international
business interests, the company produces curriculum on wheels devices, computer
projectors that are preloaded with software aimed at preparing students for standardized
tests that are the central tend to the presence no child left behind law.
No child.
Remember that song, Honey Child by Martin Van Dillis?
It's on the flip side of Nancy on the street by the way.
I had no idea.
Well, there you go.
Honey Child, yeah, I think you've got it, it's a good song.
I got it here somewhere, but I'm sure I'm not going to look for it.
On a Friday when we're supposed to be playing a tape, honey child, there it is.
That's on the flip side of what Nancy on the street.
And it's there with some dials.
Yeah, honey child, that's the menus.
I just like that.
I thought you were just slurry.
Ethnic slurry.
Honey Child.
The cows, COW, curriculum on wheels are sold to school districts that have cost a
3840 to 200 bucks although they haven't been subjected to peer reviewed signs of
study, according to citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington.
Oh, cruise says nearly a million dollars have been spent on the systems in 16 schools
which are mostly in Texas where George W. served as governor before his election in 2004
to where brother Jeb Bush was governor, Fadass Jen.
The watchdog group is requesting an investigation from the education department's inspector general
alleging that the ignite systems do not meet the standards laid out by Congress dictating
how NCLB funds can be spent.
It is astonishing that tax, I'm going to start screaming.
Like Joe Rose does on the spot.
It is astonishing.
That taxpayer dollars are being spent on unproven educational projects to the financial
benefit of the president's brother.
Melanie Sloan, cruise executive director said in news release.
The IG should investigate whether children's educations are being sacrificed so that Neil
Bush can break in federal funds.
And we all know the answer is absolutely.
Neil Bush first attracted public scrutiny for his role in the SNL scandals of late 80s when
a Colorado SNL who's 40 served failed.
That scandal cost the taxpayers $1.6 billion.
Remember the Silverado banking scandal?
Sure we do.
Some school districts identified by crews spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal
money on the mobile projectors which include curriculum for math, science, and social studies.
In addition to their baseline cost, $3800 for a single sub-deck cow or $4200 for one covering
all three subjects.
The units imposed on schools a $1,000 annual licensing and upkeep fee crews says.
Schools also had the option of purchasing lifetime contracts for $6800 for the New
York Times.
Although there's no direct evidence of presidential nepotism on behalf of his baby brother,
Neil Bush did benefit from his mother's large ass in the wake of Hurricane Katrina last
year.
Barbara Bush donated an undisclosed amount of money to a hurricane relief fund overseen
by former president, Stewart-Turber, Walker Bush and Bill Clinton.
In earmark, part of those funds for purchase of Ignite software must be just a coincidence,
of course.
An interview earlier this year with the Times Neil Bush denied using his brother's position
to purchase his product.
He claimed he was inspired to start the company after struggling with this Lexi while he
was in school.
Right.
Ignite's website includes anecdotal testimonials from teachers who have used the program,
but some teachers are less than impressed with the system, saying it's a plant's
wrote memorization for critical thinking skills.
As a review, it uses catchy phrases and tunes, Jeremy Seafker, a middle school science teacher
who has used the program for all the times, but as far as scientific investigation and
inquiry, I don't think it's very good.
Ironically, among the schools that have shunned the program is a Texas Elementary School
named for Neil Bush's father.
After reviewing the program, Bush is not interested.
Our principal of George H. Herbert Walker Bush Elementary in Midland, Texas wrote,
in the email to ignite obtained by crew, we feel our money is better spent elsewhere.
We ain't interested.
Oh, there's Bill Bollacek who got fine a half a million bucks.
Tom Brady will hand it over to him.
No problem, right?
All right.
670 people on the survey.
Now, George, please now that we got that Indiana crap off of there.
And we got, and now we got two Asian males just because of that.
See that?
Some people were too embarrassed to come on there because they thought it was just a goofball
part.
I didn't take it seriously.
Take it seriously, man.
Take it seriously.
420 or 560 QAM.
And the sports leader.
This is the Neil Roger show.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.
This is your brain.
Any questions?
I know Congressman Neymar Foley.
We're at the $3 bill on Republican Foley.
He goes trolling in the chat room.
Look in for young page boys that are young and smooth.
Bush Roy was curved with the hot mark face.
He invites me up to this place for Republican man page grab ass games.
Well, I told my congressman, hey, go go wrong.
Remove your tongue.
I gotta go home.
He said the only other thing that I want to do.
They stick my nose in the round lounds of your moon.
A petapile Republican Greek, but here's the spin.
They'll get you the thing.
Mark Foley had too much to drink.
It's $1.103 at $5.60 over to QAM.
Happy Friday to you.
Happy New Year.
