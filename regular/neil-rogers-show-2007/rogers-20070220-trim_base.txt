I have to get my trimmer there
The one at Brittany stole the shaver head
I have to get it right there in my ear
Hair growing in your ears
Hair starts more hair from your nose
And just all kinds of funky stuff
It starts going into places
I have to pop it up in your head
Hair growing in my ear
I hate this pool 60
8.5%
Well, shame on you
Nothing, I am looking forward to it
51
Oh, well, what is that?
A lie?
They're looking forward to growing old.
I get it.
And now in a way, I could understand that because, you know, at least if you grow old,
I mean, you didn't make the alternative.
You're not dead.
But I'm looking forward to getting old.
I got news for you.
A bad thinking, 51.
Take it from me.
Not a good idea.
Not that I feel older in.
I feel just like me, you know.
I feel whatever I can.
The thing I hate most about growing old is I pooped my pants 51.
In my case, I don't think that's a byproduct of age.
I think that's just a byproduct of my intestinal lack of whatever, you know.
Well, I just have gastrointestinal problems.
I've had that for years.
Just like you should know.
You've got what do you tell me you've got?
I don't know.
Well, whatever it is, I don't know.
Stomach issues.
You call it a carpenter, and things.
Yeah, I can't imagine why that he's sitting there eating, talking to eating at the
same time.
Eating how he's known.
That's great.
Young chicks won't like me anymore.
47, of course, the assumption is they did you in the first place, you know.
47 say the word.
And my kids will stick me in a home.
Only seven.
Hmm.
I never really thought about that.
Because I don't have any kids.
Number one, but I do have friends who I don't know.
They could probably, is there something like that?
Is that like the Baker Rack thing?
I mean, is it possible for your friends to stick you in some kind of a home?
I don't think so.
Do they have legal authority to do that?
Let's if you give them legal authority.
Like, no, I'm not doing that.
I'm not giving them a lot, but I'm not giving them that.
Stick my ass in a home.
Like, what's your name?
Like Sarah Goldfarb.
Oh, yeah.
712 votes on the poll about growing old.

I notice we ran an extra legal ID there, which is good.
You can never run too many legal IDs, Chris.
Yeah, I'm a new disclaimer, I will.
That's okay, not a problem.
I'd rather hit the legal ID than a super disclaimer.
Oh, the opinions, ah!
The opinions in the flamma on Neils Shore
got nothing to do with the Beasley's, you know?
Is if they don't know already.
We don't want nothing to do with him.
The greatest ID, maybe not the greatest,
but the one my favorite radio station ID was WKNR and Detroit.
Which really, the station was licensed to Dearborn,
which is a suburb of Detroit.
A lot of Arabs by the way, Dearborn.
A lot of Muslims.
What's up with that?
With the ID used to be WKNR, Dearborn,
with offices in the Sheraton Cadillac Detroit.
And of course, the offices were like, you know,
like a PO box, like a, you know,
like a mail drop or a female drop.
That was the offices.
And a mail drop?
It made it sound more like it was at Detroit station.
But it was a great station, Kier 13.
Those were the days, man.
See, this business sucks.
This business is all done.
It's over.
It's over.
We'll get to the story about the X7 series.
Have we had any faxes of that yet?
No.
Although I didn't mention it yesterday,
and we were way ahead everybody on that, as usual.
Breaking news.
That's right.
Way ahead of the whole world.
But here's an interesting story that somebody faxed in no less.
Thank you, Brian.
It's not our friend, Brian.
It's a different Brian, not chicken neck.
Booker restaurant, mania.
So you know what that makes me think of booker restaurant,
mania?
Prague.
No.
Dracula?
Yeah.
We had a hoeing foot a castle.
By the way, thank you, stuff.
Oh, Steph, I got you a new monitor?
By new, we mean old, but it works.
And you guys working on it, and we found an old monitor
laying around that works.
Yeah.
And so back in business, as soon as this thing reboots.
Speaking of this poll we're doing today about being old,
how many years have you been calling me the old man?
I think I was like 30 or something when you start calling me the old man.
That's right.
It's a relative term.
I see.
That's old as compared to you.
Pretty soon, I'll be old as compared to everybody.
Not if I'm still on the year in South Florida.
That's one of the good things.
You're never old.
Josh Cortes used to call me the not quite so old man.
I see.
Josh Cortes, by the way, got his flavor wave oven courtesy.
You're truly there.
Okay.
Now did he say anything?
I didn't come in here and like give me a big kiss.
He made all kinds of sick, disgusting stuff.
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you.
Made all kinds of slurping, sucking stuff.
That would roast Chris.
That was Josh.
What?
Josh is over here having his breakfast.
Oh, he's in there.
He's in there eating our free foods.
Having bacon and probably warming it up on the flavor wave.
You don't have to thank me.
It's just a mac dough.
As somebody we know would say it's a labor of love.
Now when Eric always says,
you know, that's cereal and bacon together in the morning.
I hear he's a cereal eater.
He calls it bacon flakes.
Yeah.
Well, he provides the flake part.
Well, I hope you enjoy it and have a lot of wonderful meals
with your Russian and a girlfriend.
Book a restaurant mania.
See that helps get the flame out of your throat.
Never thought about that.
Like that.
A Roman priest.
Hey, I'm sorry.
A Romanian priest who let a days long exorcism ritual.
Oh, I have a little sound effects on this too.
That's my bad.
That the power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.
A Romanian priest who let days long exorcism rituals for a young
uncle to end it with the woman's death was sentenced to a state of 14 years in prison.
The power of Christ compels you.
Oh, I like that little lash there.
I remember when her stomach was like getting all gripped open.
And remember the one scene.
I'm trying to remember what at what point of the movie were.
Who played the mother?
Sarah Goldfarb.
No, and in the exorcist,
it got the same person.
Oh, I did.
You're right.
It is Sarah Goldfarb.
Boy, we are getting old.
Any hot way, whoever played Sarah Goldfarb in Requiem,
that's the one who played the mother.
Anyway, she pulls back the sheets and it says on her chest, on her belly.
On Lundabrhe says, help me.
Remember that?
Sure.
Four nuns were also sentenced in the case.
The dead nun,
Marseca Irina Cornicci,
believes she heard the devil talking to her.
The power of Christ compels you.
She was treated for schizophrenia,
but when she relapsed, Daniel Petru Koregano,
a monk who served as the priest of this included Holy Trinity covenant in
Northeast Romania and four other nuns tried exercise.
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.
See, I mean, whatever his name is.
John, she could be enjoying some delicious pea soup right now,
who were having nexus in the studio, along with his flakes.
Cornicci, 23, was tied up for several days at the...
This does make any sense.
Several days without food or water,
and chained to a cross.
All right, she died of dehydration, exhaustion, and suffocation.
Huh?
The power of Christ compels you.
The court of the Northeast of Vaslui,
convicted Cornicci and the nuns of Hordin Cornicci captive,
resulting in her death.
One of the nuns, Nicoletta Arliniu, was sent state-years in prison,
and the other three, and it's got the names which are not going to waste my time with,
received five-year sentences.
Dozens of Koregano supporters packed the court room and prayed for the priest,
several burst into tears when the verdict was announced.
Fourteen years in prison, the defendant's lawyer is time to appeal.
The power of Christ compels you.
Cornicci is a death prompted Romania's dominant orthodox church to promise reforms,
including psychological tests for those seeking to enter monasteries,
speaking to somebody who needs a psychological test.
I'm asking to ensure that I'm...
Oh my God.
The orthodox church was as benefited from a religious revival in recent years,
condemned the ritual at the covenant as abominable.
Abominable.
The power of Christ compels you.
And Banda Koregano, from the priesthood,
next to the medicated de Fournons from the church.
In 1999, when the Vatican issued its first new guidelines for 16,
since 1614, for driving out devils.
The power of Christ compels you.
Yeah, we're sending modern in Jersey.
The power of Christ compels you.
You're placed for them, by the way.
The power of Christ compels you.
Yeah, one more time.
The power of Christ compels you.
Thank you.
It urged its priest to take modern psychiatry into account and deciding who should be exercised.
I could use a little exercise myself.
I'm going on for a long walk right now.
I'll be back.
I'm in about 155.
Orthodox churches also regularly perform exercises and rituals,
but Koregano's methods were criticized by church officials
as excessively harsh,
notably the dropped out from the church's religious education program.
Well, you're going to have an exercise and don't have some drop-off to it on.
That's the list I hear.
QIAM, hello.
Not there, and it's probably a good thing.
You never know, though.
WDQIAM, hello.
Hi.
Yes, sir.
A couple things.
Ellen Bernstein was the mother and-
Thank you. That's correct.
She's a great actress, yeah.
But I know she also plays Goldfarb.
About being elderly and somebody taking you away.
Anybody can call the abuse hotline.
It's for abuse and neglect.
If they think an old person is,
you know, like living with 19 cats or being a virus.
My needs, yes.
Right.
But I'm hoping I have florist stuff like that.
Yeah.
So if that's going on in your place up there, be careful.
Okay, well, I'm going to throw the cats off the balcony right now.
Okay.
Thank you.
Neil.
Never mind.
I'm out.
Bye.
See you.
He wanted me, man.
Can you tell?
I can be surprised.
Yeah, he wanted me badly.
I love you, pal.
750 votes on today's pool.
Well, I sure if I could just get the last remnants of this.
You know what I mean?
I remember like with a shovel.
If I could just stick that shovel down my throat
and just shovel away,
shovel off the buffalo would be good for somebody not for me.
You know, 1214 friends at my space, by the way.
Now, let me just say this, the fact that there are people
who voluntarily live in buffalo and upstate near,
that tells me that there's a real problem with the human race.
Hi, I'm Tally.
It's straight from the Vatican,
introducing new Catholic life,
the religion with one third the guilt of your regular faith.
New Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity,
but it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine.
More of a family.
More of a family.
With Catholic life, there's no confessions, no sermons,
and no lingering afterlife.
It's the perfect alternative for modern agnostics
who don't want to take any chances.
Our services are held three times a year
and they're only 15 minutes long.
Plus, there's no added guilt for sneaking out during communion.
We've dropped that too.
Look for our church, Bobele, and your neighborhood.
Hey, you might be in the front pew.
For ye of little faith, try Catholic life,
because a little faith is all you need.
1031, how about some to fill in, man?
That would be really good.
770 votes on the poll.
Make 1000, even though this is not one of those
rock-a-missacum kind of polls,
you know, why are those really not-down, drag-out,
get all whipped up to a frenzy.
Like the body wash thing, for example.
That's pretty controversial.
You know, I guess.
I mean, should be, should be automatic.
That's like saying,
do you get out of bed in the morning?
Will the sun shine again somewhere?
Yeah, it's something like that, really controversial.
Sun will come out tomorrow.
WDQAM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Joins.
I hope you're all right.
I hope you're better with the throat.
A small grandmother's, which is I used over the years.
You're probably from your childhood.
It's the cup.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Full cup of the hot meal.
Full table spoon, I'm sorry, of the real butter.
Full table spoon of the honey.
Mix it up and see if it.
Okay, mix it up and see if it okay.
I'll be mixing it right now.
Okay, what was he saying?
Butter and honey and something like that.
I don't know.
Thought he said sniff it.
Yes, yes, sniff this.
Okay, pal, I like them.
Yes, they have it.
If you have a strong constitution,
which America used to have before Bush.
Seven hundred and seventy four votes on the pool.
Now, my throat is fine.
I just have the remnants of the flame from the ass end of a cold.
There's nothing worse than the ass end of a bag cold.
Although this wasn't even a bad cold.
This is a bad story, though.
This is very sad.
A three-year-old girl died this morning
after being run over by her family's car in the driveway
of her Danubee Chome, according to the BS.
Oh!
The accident happened about eight o'clock this morning
in the hundred block of Northwest 13th Avenue.
Both the girl and her mother were outside in the driveway.
Their names haven't been released.
Though details remain sketchy,
the mother may have sent the girl back inside the families.
One of the story do place to put on a jacket,
said Elliott Cohen, BS, so spoken.
Is it chilly this morning still?
No, it's cool.
Nice.
Yeah, cool.
Very nice.
Teachered weather.
So in other words,
the little girl didn't really need a jacket.
No, no, no.
And if she wouldn't have gone back inside,
she'd still be like,
I don't want the mother to feel bad,
but you know,
if you're clipping overbearing,
there's nothing worse than an overbearing mother.
Just ask me.
Or George, he'll tell you.
Now, don't forget your glasses now.
Oh, brother.
Some of the girl ended up behind the red sedan
which went into reverse.
The child was run over
and rushed to Memorial Region in the hospital.
Hollywood, she was pronounced dead.
And investigations, that are way to determine
exactly what happened on Monday night in West State.
A four-year-old boy was killed
when he fell out of his mother's car
and was hit by a sports coupe.
Police are still looking for the driver in that incident.
Boy.
Tell you one thing,
there's a, I think there's a moral in all these stories.
The better, the best plan is stay inside.
Don't leave the house, right?
Let's see if it always cats running around.
Well, that was a little bit in this hard shooting
with that guy.
I said, I should have asked him,
I should have asked him what the relationship has to be
with the people before they can like have you committed
or whatever he said, you know, right?
And I was, if it's just somebody out on a street
who thinks you're a crazy person
or somebody who's your close personal friend
or whatever.
And they just decided they're going to call
and have you put away, oh, he's crazy.
He's a little bit crazy.
Like, you know, even if they're a total stranger.
Don't you start with that stranger stuff again.
Now, are we ever going to get that clip or not?
My close friend, I'm taking every day.
Close personal friend Brandon was going to get me that
but he I'm sure he's still working on it.
Taping every day.
That's all that other good stuff.
Which you said was Kenny's sonny, by the way.
He's very upset about that.
Right.
Still love you, Brandon.
He's working on it and the clip too.
He's a stranger.
I said, I think she's taking over a little ratio
because she's, he's got her mom like every other night now.
Even though we can't stand him.
I've watched the show.
She did take over.
Well, she's on a lot.
I'll tell you that.
She was on a getting other night.
All I did watching.
I missed the tip.
I don't like her as a guest.
I mean, I do like her on her show when she's
bitching people out.
But it's right.
Yes.
What do I care what she thinks about Anne and the cool?
I know there are legal ramifications there.
But what do I care?
But, you know, yeah.
Oh, look at this.
It's a miracle that yesterday at Block from Endering,
836 on 57th Avenue, you saved my day
by not entering that nightmare.
Well, you're welcome.
How do you like that?
Because I went on the year and I gave the thing.
And of course, we don't have a news department here at QM
because unless it has to do with sports,
nobody could possibly care about it.
So we have no news department.
So naturally, we were going to give you any information
about the traffic mess on 836 because of that wreck.
So I saw it on CNN and put it on the year.
And here's somebody nice enough to fax me and say,
thank you that you saved my day
by not getting me on it tonight.
And then there's some other stuff on here.
I've tacked our couple of articles on birth order and being gay.
While the results substantially, the small percentage in gay men,
it clearly shows to be a bot,
to be biologically driven and not a choice.
We all have a family member somewhere in a world of the closet.
Biologically driven, not a choice.
Amen.
Well, that's obvious.
Two, Ray Kel Milgo,
formerly Miller, oh, look at that lavender.
Hmm.
I wonder what that means, lavender.
Gay.
Ray Kel Milgo, formerly Miller,
electronics, they were pioneers in software
and hardware of modern technology.
Wow.
Remember I was talking the other day
about when I first moved out to plantation acres
the only thing out there was Ray Kel Milgo?
Must have been on Friday.
Was it really?
Well, I don't know.
How I watched them build the sawgrass mill.
Oh, yeah, it must have been on Friday.
We're talking about what tells the big deal.
I keep asking that question.
Nobody can answer me that because nobody who lives in South
fold actually goes to the sawgrass.
Right.
It's all the Brazilian toadistas, I guess.
I don't know what the semi-ad campaign
that run into those places.
I would say the one thing I do like
is the food court, the one that's got Nathan's in it.
Not because the food court's so great.
I just like Nathan's.
Don't you?
I like Nathan's.
Nathan's.
Nathan's.
For a quick call it says,
when sit, oh no.
Oh, that, this is horrible.
And then George writes,
trust me, you don't want the other four pages with this pull.
For a quote,
I mean, the article, the other four pages of the article
that they're talking about, and it's, you know,
ponderous from Wikipedia, you don't want it.
Oh, about birth order and being gay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, biological, we've heard.
Listen, I already know that.
And I'm not going to sit here and try to convince people
because the people out there who want to use their own ignorance
as an excuse for bigotry,
they're going to continue doing that.
Oh, it's a choice.
You chose to be gay.
Right.
Okay, whatever you're saying.
If it makes you happy to believe that,
if it substantiates your hate and your intolerance
and your stupidity, great, more power to you.
For a quick pull, I don't think I really want to read this
about your member when you're taking a dump on the toilet.
Drop it inside the bowl and forget it.
Rest it on the toilet seat and forget it.
Oh, jeez, I'm not even reading the rest of that.
Yeah.
How about just forget it?
Yeah, forget it, I think it's a good part.
This call to this faxer, this person was doing really well
thanking me for avoiding the mess.
And then he just turned my life in a pure instant crap
with that whole thing about what do you do?
I mean, it's just hang down your head, Tom Dooley.
I think again, is the opera advance.
786 votes on the pool.
The thing I hate most about growing old is,
I think we left an operative one out.
What's that dying?
Yeah.
Getting close to death.
No, it's a thing that would be good.
Getting close to death.
I don't feel close to death though today.
In fact, if you would ask me aside from the flim,
the last very last remnants of this call,
what'd you be going by tomorrow?
But if you would ask me, I would say,
I feel no different now than I was when I was like, say, 50.
Since you think 50 is old.
I don't feel any different.
Well, no, there's that old stupid cliche.
You're only as old as you feel.
Right.
Yeah, my response to that is, feel this, you know.
But I don't feel a day or 50.
I don't feel a day over 17.
Well, good for you.
786 on the pool, make the thousand of that.
I was a little worried about that.
Had a really slow start because it's a crappy pool.
Now I shouldn't say that.
Somebody send it in.
Don't ever knock a pool that somebody sent in
because they're not ever seeing the other one.
They take it personal.
I won't be able to afford to live 195.
We'll start saving right now.
Okay, put away some money.
All you young punks out there.
Trust me when I tell you.
Oh, no.
Wow, that sounded like a fall.
You know what it was?
It was my cable box.
It just slugged right off the top of the,
because I was being very emphatic.
And I didn't hit it that hard.
I hit the counter here.
And it just slugged off the top of my little citizen TV
right on the floor.
But it's okay.
It'll be fine.
Picture still there.
I won't be able to afford to live 195.
Put somebody away, George.
Yep.
The winky won't work.
The winky or the wonky 103.
I am old 84.
Oh, I am.
Everything droops 82.
Hair growing in my ears.
76.
Nobody like a forest growing in your ears.
All the scissors, all the tweezers, all the,
oh, yanking.
Young chicks won't,
don't like me anymore.
64.
And they probably don't know anyway.
I hate this full 64.
8.1%.
Not good.
Nothing.
I'm looking forward to it.
57 crazy people.
I pooped my pants 55.
Also not good.
And my kids will stick me in a home.
7.
And if they don't,
some stranger out on the street.
Or maybe Judge Judy will do it.
I can't baby.
Attorney General Janet Reno
has purchased a red Ford pickup truck.
Hi.
I'm Janet with abs of granite.
Today I've got my travel and companion.
A legal alien Paco by my side.
Go and have a look at that.
Paco is my full time houseboy.
And part time of slave.
Go and have a look at that.
He'll be riding shotgun with me till we hit Florida.
Then I'm gonna dump his tiny little can can in Miami.
And push him off with a volleyball
and an inflatable super bowl chair.
I need some me time.
It's all about Janet and the open highway.
I've grown weary of Paco anyway.
Hola, Mujacha.
He's been leaving his stinky cigars all over my apartment.
Trying to convince me to do a Monica whiskey forum.
That's not for me.
I told him.
Hey Paco, that's an exit.
Hola, Mujacha.
Plus I gotta shot it.
Hooking big up with Ellen now that all fully blown.
He and his out of the picture.
Nothing like rambling down and interstate.
That clear your mind.
Hola, Mujacha.
We looking for Janet Reno.
Red Ford pickup truck traveling the country side.
Later this month 1046 at 560 W.
Let's take a look at that schedule.
Mad Dog at two power hour with Hank and the Mad Dog together.
Of course, Humphor is back today.
And then he'll be on solo 5 to 7 Hank over.
Panther preview with seven to panthers to play the lightning
in Tampa Bay at 730.
And then overnight of course it's the anxious ESPN radio.
Guess who died?
Who died?
Somebody you never heard of.
But remember we played short-fat fan yesterday.
And in the song it was like Jim Dandy to rescue.
Jim Dandy was by was it LeVern Baker?
Did Jim Dandy, I don't know.
I'll see you in the video.
To the rescue.
Why are you parton?
I'll look it up.
Now go ahead.
William Dandy, a 35 year old, I mean a 35 year
board school administrator.
What is it?
I don't have no Jim Dandy.
I'll find it.
A 35 year brown school administrator became one of the first
principals as a predominantly white school.
The I had this morning of a brief film.
This family member said he was 79.
Mr. Dandy began his career in a brown school system in 58 as a guidance counselor.
A dillard high.
Then in all black school and a segregated four-larter day.
You know four-larter day was a really really bigoted place.
You do understand that don't you?
Wasn't everywhere?
Well I guess but I mean I'm talking about for a very long time.
In fact the it was like Goyesh Heaven was four-larter day.
The Goyesh moved there to get away from the Jews who were
predominantly in Miami Beach.
They moved there to get away from the blacks and then moved there to get away
certainly from your people.
Of course that didn't work out too well.
Is there any part of day to brown out that your people haven't like?
I don't want to say overrun that would sound like a very sarcastic term.
But they haven't just like infected and fest I mean like you know what I mean?
No.
We're on our way to Canada too.
Well guess what?
Enjoy it while you can.
The RCMP will be right there at the border, right?
Yeah yeah.
I don't have too many Cuban hockey players.
There's that many Fernandez.
Not yet.
Not everything.
Just wait.
Eighth hour eleven votes on the poll.
We'll make a thousand and Chris is pretty astonished because we had a very weak start.
A second US aircraft carrier has arrived in Middle Eastern waters has promised by US President
Bush in January.
I mean an escalating crisis with nearby Iran over its nuclear program.
You'll be pleased to know by the way that my cable, my digital cable box is back on top of the
TV.
And there's no problem.
See now that everything they started calling things solid state which meant that they used
like transistors instead of tubes you know.
Right?
Tube.
For example and this is another thing when you get to be an old fart like me.
You remember you remember things that a lot of you younger punks can't you find incomprehensible.
Like for example when's the last time either one of you had the TV repairman in the house?
I beg your pardon.
Right.
When was the last time?
When was the first time?
Exactly.
How about you Chris?
You ever have a TV repairman?
About six, eight months ago.
Yeah.
For what?
48 inch widescreen?
No I don't mean for what kind of TV I mean for what problem?
It just wasn't the only one.
48 inch widescreen TV?
Yeah.
HD?
HD ready.
Yeah I don't have it.
HD ready my ass.
Come on.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
Come on man.
That's like saying.
Go ahead.
It was overheating or something like that so the guy would come in and switch something out.
He switched it.
But you had him in like not like George is 100 years old.
He's never had a TV repairman.
No we just use the pliers like everybody else.
But back in the day when we used to have all those
tubes.
This is in the TV.
And he's burning head like huh?
They would burn out.
Tubes would burn out.
And so you know the TV would go on the fritz and you go into a panic.
Oh gee what do we do not have to go to a TV repairman?
And he would come and open it up and almost almost every time would be some kind of a
tube.
Once it'll be the picture tube.
Now I don't want to get into a big because I'm totally
ignorant about these sets that we have today.
Although I do know that my 46 inch HD set in the other room.
My Samsung.
Yeah.
That there's a thing.
You know it's got a mean bulb.
Okay.
They last for I don't know how long.
Hopefully a lot longer.
And there's a you can see where you just unscrew a thing and there's like a panel and
just unscrew like a light bulb.
Anybody knew when to put it in there which I think is about 500 bucks.
Whatever.
But they last for a couple of years I think or more than that.
Okay.
But that's what used to happen all the time when you had a TV.
Right.
And the horizontal hold.
When's the last time the horizontal hold on your TV gave out?
Do they even have those?
I don't think that we even have those on TVs anymore.
Do we?
I don't know.
Those knobs.
The V-hold and the H-hold.
Yeah the vertical hold the horizontal hold.
And the picture would like go like sideways and then would I start rolling.
When you CC our rolling.
If you buy it you know what they have them on is like we bought a little battery
operated for the hurricane kind of TV.
Yeah.
And it had that that stuff going.
Yeah.
But other than that no I've never seen one.
What kind of a TV in the year 2007 has got a vertical hold button and a horizontal hold
because it just doesn't happen.
Right.
The picture just doesn't keep rolling and rolling because we made all these advances.
So the point being that when they drop this box on the floor nothing to go wrong
because it's all like got transistor sisters inside or whatever it's got.
Are they even transistors or is it beyond that?
Am I in my way behind the times?
No I think they are are still transistors in there.
Wow.
Boy am I on top of stuff or what?
Ha ha ha ha ha.
I got a lot of gadgets and gizmos.
I have no idea how they work and you know what what the events is to make.
As long as you know how to do it a lot more the events is to make one.
That's why we have engineers like stuff who fixed this monitor here.
All during a commercial break what a world went operation to.
I think you're saying brought in an old crappy one that just happens to still be working.
Yeah but you know how these monitors are hooked up they were like all these wires
and everything and everything in them.
Oh yeah.
They do them and everything and he's right.
Tor everything apart got the shop back.
Nice going step man.
I think you all went to the department and placed it all in four minutes.
Yeah man one of my favorite calls of all time is to was the guy that
who obviously must work like you.
He must be Maddie Bell's boyfriend or something.
And he called and said you know you had a problem you got a problem with QA
and we've had a problem every station you've been on Neil and I said how long have I been on this
to too long too long.
That was Maddie Bell's buddy I guess.
He cracked me up.
Yeah it must be me okay it's not the business don't ask anybody else in this business
if they have any problem.
But in fact it had been several stations that worked out where I wouldn't say I really
had much of a problem.
WNWS I was there like nine years.
I think right now I'm tied I think I was at IOD for nine years
and WS News for eight or nine and now nine plus at the QAM.
So I think this is my you know that's a long time to be on one station.
Am I right?
Yeah it is.
KAT I was only there two years.
INZ I think between INZ and Zeta I was there like six I believe six years.
And speaking of radio which is a piece of crap the two main U.S. satellite radio providers
which I told you yesterday.
Sirius and XM agreed to merge and stock for stock.
The L.A. would create if it's approved a 13 billion dollar company including 1.6 billion in debt.
And the reason that they had to do this merger is because
side by each individually they weren't going to cut it and I told you that a long time ago
remember people were giving me a lot of crap.
Oh you're wrong Neil there's nothing like satellite radio that's the way of the future
and I kept saying I don't think too many people at least not that big of a percentage
are going to pay for something that they can get for free unless there's really
something spectacular on there you know over and above Howard Stern.
And they aren't in fact the two if you put the two of them together they got about seven
million customers nationwide.
Well what seven million people?
Not gonna.
A country of 300 million people which is probably like 270 or 260 million adults.
What seven million people?
Not enough.
Tiny slice of the pie.
Under terms of the deal which as long as it anticipated XM stockholders get 4.6 years in Sirius
XM and Sirius shareholders would each own 50% of the combined company.
Veteran media executive Mel Carmes and currently Sirius CE.
Oh will be CE.
Oh will be combined company and Gary Parsons now chairman of XM will hold the same position
in the new company.
Both executive members will be on the 12 member board of the new company.
Each company will get to name four additional directors each and General Motors in
American Honda will each get to name a director.
The deal will need to win regulatory and shareholder approval once received the
company's expected deal could close by the end of this year.
Although the deal will combine the two largest US satellite providers into one entity
the companies are likely to argue that the deal will not limit competition in satellite radio space
due to competition the company's face from other types of media including the internet and
devices such as the iPod.
Likely story.
In a press release the company said the deal will help create greater programming and content choices
speed up technological innovation and improve financial performance.
The combination will create a company with $15 billion in revenue always wrong about the number
based on analyst estimates in about 14 million subscribers.
Still a Paltry number.
Still a very Paltry number.
I mean for me I wouldn't pay I don't listen to the radio here anyway and when I'm there I
don't listen to the radio.
What am I going to listen to?
Magic what I'm saying?
Old magic.
Why do I need to listen to magic when I can talk to Rick Shaw personal on the earhead's right?
I don't need to turn on the radio to talk to Rick Shaw you know you could call him at home.
I don't think so.
I could write him on my space thing he's one of our friends we got 1214 on my space
and we got 830 votes on the pool about getting old.
We didn't add that thing under about getting close to death did we?
Did we?
No we did not.
I mean isn't that the main negative about getting old besides all the illness and the disease and
and the flamm- and the fracking and stuff?
I would think so.
Well let's get that on there.
831 votes.
And the thing that they worry about most about getting old is not being able to afford to live 205.
And you know what no problem George will send you a change
in theります čov수� or
esaуем
No no no toy any questions
Uh-huh
ge
Uh-huh
Yeah
Oh, the real love just ended with you, even though we don't know much about you.
No dot in that words no way McCain works on one with an outlast name Barack Obama.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so Barack Obama can't go ahead and read.
Absolutely.
It's 11.11 at 5.60 W.Q.I.M.
Well, this is the stubborn among, I guess, you know, the very last remnants of the...
They just doesn't want to come out.
How about if you took it like a vacuum cleaner and you stuck it down your trove, yeah, it sucked it all out of you,
you sucked all the flim out of your ducks.
How would that be?
It sucked the ducks.
Anyway, WB, who's one of our very best faxers, says, speaking of TV repair service in the home,
do you remember the TV tube?
Tube!
Testing machines and stores that would allow you to test your TV.
Tube!
After you pulled them from your set, I sure do.
If a tube tested bad, there was a lack of replacement.
Tube!
In the compartment below the test unit, pick the tube, if you work your ass and fix your own set,
and then he says, damn, I feel old.
Plus, he says, he has the best part of getting old, I say, if you like crap, and don't mind the thought of dying.
Oh, no!
Woo!
How do you like that?
Yeah.
Makes sense.
Well, I have a reset point yet.
Thank goodness.
Thank the Lord.
Thank everybody.
And you did put that getting close to death, we've got four votes already, 846.
846 vote.
5670560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.
WDQA-M, hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay, sir.
Hey, have you tried darkling with warm salt water?
Do you get all that mung out of your throat?
That doesn't do it.
That's for a sore throat.
No, it's to get the flam out of it, exfoliate on the...
President exfoliated?
Yeah.
Okay, I'm going to go do that.
I'll take a couple hours now and I'll go do it.
Stay away from the dairy.
Okay.
Alright.
See ya.
Oh, that's a Jewish guy, okay?
He knows his milk, it can play shit.
Stay away from dairy, man.
All that cheese.
That's what creates all that extra flam.
And I'm a cheese man.
In fact, you know what, I could have for lunch.
I could take a slab of cheese and go put some other kind like a slab of mozzarella cheese.
And put some cheddar cheese on it.
Just put them in a newcom and just melt it all together.
Just have a big mung vest of cheese.
Oh, I love cheese.
Not good for you though, I don't think.
Is it?
I don't imagine.
But what do you know about it?
You a cheese guy, I'm a cheese guy.
I love what you talk about it.
Is that this conversation?
That's why I used to like dalt so much.
You used to like that.
In fact, you know what, uh, crystal is got.
And I'm not talking about your wife, I mean the food chain.
They've got, well, I'm sure a lot of other places have now too, but I think they were the original ones with the cheese fries.
Okay, yeah.
Man.
Now there's nothing like going through the drive-through at crystal and tampon, dalt-maybree.
And getting a whole bag full, a whole sack full of those little nasty burgers, you know, little cheeseburgers.
And then a bunch of cheese fries.
Oh yeah.
And then you get on the highway, you just go up the road there on dalt-maybree and you get on, what is that road?
I don't know, a brother.
Yeah, as a way.
Well, you get on the expressway, whatever it is.
And you're eating out of the sack, of course, while you're driving.
And you get the cheese fries, you get the, the, the, the goopy cheese, you know, all over your hands and all over your shirt.
And then all over the steering wheel of your beautiful Corvette and you get on cheese, you know.
It's pretty good though.
You think of cheese?
It is really pretty good.
Yeah, the cheese fries are crystal.
Too bad we do.
Now we do have that one supposedly.
Where is it?
I don't know.
Ah, cheese.
It's somewhere like in, in Broward.
I believe.
850 people, so then we finally got steak and chicken southward.
They have cheese fries also or not, or I just remember.
They have great shakes.
They do have cheese fries.
Their burgers, unfortunately, are all that good because they fall apart.
You know, they like fall into like sections, you know.
What are you going to do?
And then you can have it like all over your shirt and all over your pantaloonies and all what's that all over your clothes?
Oh, it's cheeseburger, you know.
But their shakes are really great at steak and shake.
Especially like when they're on sunrise.
70 QAM, hello.
QAM.
Yeah, you're talking about the TV toots.
Yes.
Yeah, we used to get the 6L Q6, which is a horizontal vertical tube.
We used them in the liniers for the CP radio.
Well, that is pretty informative, man.
I'm going to mark all of that down.
Was that some heavy duty stuff or what?
Woo!
Did you mark that down?
What?
I don't know whatever the hell he said.
He had the name of the...
The name of the...
Q!
And all that stuff and where he stuck it and stuff like that.
I thought that was extraordinarily entertaining.
Maybe he could have his own show on Saturday right between the No Punches Pooh Guy and the golf show.
To talk about where do you stick your...
Phew!
WQAM, hello.
Was that some heavy duty stuff?
QAM.
Hey, that was pretty good.
That was great, yeah.
Is that a very important thing?
That reminds me, I used to...
You know, you could take a...
You could go to a drugstore or a place like that and they had these machines that used to test those two.
Really?
And I'm not even that old.
I mean, he used to...
You know, he used to keep you thing work.
He took the two baths, went to the drugstore, you put it in a machine and had all those different size holes in it.
So it's where it was.
That's how it was just right.
Right.
How old are you?
54.
54.
Oh, that's pretty old.
Oh, it is a hole.
Not that you've heard of me, not by my standards, but generally speaking, you've heard of like Chris and George there.
You know, I had this dream last night about a T.P.
And the other night I had a dream about a tent.
And I'm sorry, I had a dream about a wig wand.
Do you think I'm a little bit too tense?
Hmm.
I thought you were going to say...
I had a dream about a peppy, is what I thought you were going to say.
That's not good.
That would have been funnier.
That would have been a hell of a lot more entertaining and not killed as much time.
859 votes on a poll.
The poll is about getting old.
And don't think that I did this.
This is something somebody sent in.
I'm not all that worried about getting old.
I feel young and aspry.
865 votes on a poll.
The thing I hate most about growing old is I won't be able to afford to live 213.
The winky won't work.
110.
Everything droops.
88.
I am old.
87 of us.
Old Farts.
Here growing in my ears.
86.
That's a good one.
In fact, you know something no matter how often or how quickly you like, uh, squeeze it out or you shave it up.
Yeah.
It just keeps coming back.
I know.
Never heard on your head would grow as fast as there in your ears.
You'd really have something.
Young chicks won't like me anymore.
80.
I hate this poll 65 down to 7.5 percent.
Thank.
Thank.
Thanks God.
Uh, nothing I'm looking forward to.
It's 61.
Absolutely crazy people.
If they're going back to W.B.
facts.
I would say like for the last 20 years of her life, my mother used to say to me every time I go over for lunch every Tuesday.
She'd say, oh no.
What's it all about?
If I had a gun, I would shoot myself.
And you'd say what made it go by or no, I say you're livid right right up the street.
There is 441.
You know, all those pawn shops, ma, but anyway, her.
Uh, I poop my pants 60.
You don't have to be old to do that.
Isn't that interesting?
How like when you're an infant and you got the diapers on and little babies of poop their pants?
And then when you get to be old again, it's called like going through a second childhood.
Just like I do now.
It was full of trouble.
I told you that.
You keep accusing me of that.
Yeah.
Whatever.
No, there is nothing wrong with it.
I'm enjoying it.
My kids will stick me in a home eight and getting close to the seven.
I told you about my landlord from Sarasota.
The one I said, oh, I'm not worried about dying because by the time I get that age, they'll
have a cure and people to live forever.
I was like, I'm doing what he's dead.
Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, said yesterday the war in Iraq has been mismanaged
for years and former defense secretary, Ramesthal, to be remembered as one of the worst in history.
Easy to say now, Johnny, well, I said to this John McCain, he gives me Philke's man.
He makes me want a kaka.
We're paying a very heavy price for the mismanagement.
That's the kindest word I can give you of Donald Romes, all of this word here as on the senator be saying.
The price is very, very heavy, kind of like Chris, very heavy.
And I regretted enormously, McCain told an overflow crowd of more than 800-year retirement community
near Hilton Head, Ireland, South Carolina.
Beautiful.
Can you recognize him?
What?
It's a beautiful place.
Hilton Head, Ireland.
Is it?
It's the only thing beautiful about South Carolina that I've seen.
Are you hate South Carolina being the North Carolina guy that you are?
That's right.
You gotta go through South Carolina to get there.
Ah!
McCain, the Republican on the senator armed service committee complained that Ramesthal never put enough troops on the ground to succeed in Iraq.
Of course, succeeding, I have no idea what the hell is supposed to mean.
What does succeeding mean?
Kill all the people that hate each other?
Well, I would mean kill everybody, basically.
Kill everybody that won't play ball with us and do what we say and give us all that oil and, you know, goose step.
Croatia probes Hitler likeness and jokes on sugar packets.
There's a picture of Adolfo that, you know, the one thing about him that was funny.
I'll say that is that mustache and the zoo, you know.
He was a funny guy.
He was a real fashion player.
Kind of like me as a matter of fact.
Small packets of sugar bearing likeness that Adolf Hitler and carrying a holocaust jokes have been found in some cafes in Croatia, prompting an investigation.
The office of the state prosecutor's city yesterday, the local district attorney in the eastern town of Posega
has opened an investigation and is currently looking at the matter.
The Novi list, daily newspaper, Novi, you know, where Novi is, that's in Detroit.
That's right.
That's right.
The way to Wolverine Harnest Raceway, Detroit Racecourse, no longer there in LaVonia, Novi.
The Novi list, in fact, there was a great skipper's table.
There was a great smorgasbord.
I told you this story about how my friend, Dar, he was a salesman at the station I worked at.
We would have double headers.
We'd go like, I mean, I don't know if I ever worked or anything like that.
But on a day off or something, when we both had the day off, we would drive over to Detroit
and the afternoon go to the Thurbera races at Detroit Racecourse and then go have dinner at Skipper's table at the buffet
and then drive over to Hazel Park to the Harnest Racing at night and lose our ass.
The Novi list, daily newspaper, reported that officials at a small factory in Posega confirm the sugar packs were produced on their premises.
The incident will embarrass the government, which has been keen to play down the country's past links with Nazism, Croatia.
I never knew that. Did you? I knew that the Austrians were much worse than the crowds ever were.
Right. I didn't know about Croatia.
Well, did we learn something already?
It's not even 1130 and we already learned something very impromulium portante here today.
Croatia's used stasha regime, sided with the Nazis in WW2 and forced ethnic laws under which thousands of Serbs Jews and Gypsies,
oh, as well as anti-fascist quotes were killed in local concentration camps in 1941 to 1945.
The Jerusalem-based anti-Nazi Simon Vesenthal Center said in statement and it protested the matter to Croatia's authorities.
Its director, FRIM ZURAF, expressed his revolts in and discussed that such an item could be produced these days in the country in which the Holocaust not only took place,
but was for the most part carried out by local Nazi collaborators.
If nothing else, this is a disgusting expression of nostalgia for the Third Reich and a period during which Jews served in Gypsies,
where mass murdered in Croatia, it said.
And there's a picture of a smiling, smirking adult with his arm at that 45 degree angle and that Silesia Smustag.
Although he does make a hell of a seasoning though.
Isn't that just NSG? It's still even make that accent?
I don't know about Adolfo.
Oh, accent is NSG, that's correct.
That is correct. I love it.
You do?
That's sprinkled on my tongue.
No wonder you're sick all the time. You use an accent?
That's NSG, man.
It's monosodium glutamine.
I love NSG, it makes my teeth tingle.
God, poor man's acid.
In fact, if you sit on it, let go.
Talk about a tingle.
870-860 on the pool.
And leave it to South Florida, man.
Nobody in South Florida wants to get off the couch.
God, your breasts are beautiful.
Absolutely.
Huh?
This is the end of Back Street.
All right.
After this door is complete.
We realized it was bad that we were older than most of your dads.
Kids are saying we stink. They'd rather see and sing.
Oh, yeah.
Because we got such a tune.
And 8J, he can be really rude.
To went down the aisle.
How we can be filed.
Now the Back Street boys are breaking the heart.
So what about that great reality TV show?
There was a Nick and Aaron Carter that was down for about two weeks.
Is that thing still on?
I don't even know what you're talking about.
Yeah, they had their own show where they were like living together and they were like,
huh?
I'm glad I blinked and missed that.
Oh, yeah.
That was on for about five minutes.
And then when I think it's throwing up, that is still on also.
I don't know.
But there was so much crap on now.
Oh, yeah.
And of course, when you got a good cable system, like I've got, and you got 800 channels on my Rogers cable system,
named after yours truly.
When I came up here, they renamed the stadium the Rogers Center, you know?
Table company Rogers.
Table company.
All of these things.
They give you, they give you your due as opposed to South Florida.
And you realize we're like only nine days away from that big day from March 1st?
What about March 1st 1976, Neil Rogers comes to WKAT 1360 on the Val Ketch2CAD to do a three-sixth in the afternoon.
And the average age of our listening audience was death plus ten.
Talk about getting old.
Oh my God.
Unbelievable.
And of course, the only people we had listening, we could hear the signal KAT with the old user on Miami Beach.
Now you even remember those days.
I do.
Back before Art Deco and before South Beach.
I did all this other stuff.
Talk about it.
You could be looking at these old people rocking on the rocking chairs there in the building.
That's right.
That was their audience.
Hello, Neil.
And now I'm one of them.
But I like I told you.
I put it back then and I'm still saying the same thing now.
I think I lived up to my promise.
I'm never going to become like them.
I'm never going to become bitter.
Just because chronologically you reach a certain age doesn't mean you have to act your age.
It's one thing to act your age when you're like 15 instead of acting like 10.
What does that really mean?
Act your age.
Parents say that to their kids all like, come on.
Quick doing that. Act your age.
Stop doing whatever it is that you're doing at the moment.
I see. Well, why don't you act your age, Ma?
Instead of acting like some kind of an emotional cripple.
Oh, they got there in the first place.
This is because Ma was acting her age.
I see.
You know, that time Brady knocking up that chick.
I just can't believe that I always thought he was such a clean cut guy.
That article yesterday just, it's just, I didn't know whether the screen or jump out the window.
I mean, a clean cut guy.
So therefore he wasn't having any sex.
Is that what defines a clean cut guy?
Is that he's not getting laid?
Nine times married.
Oh, it's at least married.
Is that what it is?
Chris?
Who knows?
Is that what you're waiting for?
I think clean.
No, I'll be willing to be the father of her child if she likes him.
Yeah, but you'll raise that thing.
Yeah, you'll raise it.
You'll raise it.
You'll raise it.
Not the kid either.
900 votes on the pool.
We got that we're going to make our thousand of it.
We're crushing along as they say in cemetery village.
We're crushing along.
Moving very, very slowly.
As old people tend to do.
We're shuffling.
Have any QIM?
Hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I said I was talking about two earlier TV tubes.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm not that old.
I'm like 47.
I remember.
You're going to this is no better than a tube.
I used to six.
I used to six out of six GCs for my job.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Six out of GCs.
Yeah.
Okay.
You're just going to get rid of them.
God.
This phone thing.
I'm sure it's the connection between here and there because last couple of months.
But that again, line one hasn't worked in about two years now.
So why should I worry about that?
Right.
That's the same guy again with his GLC 6th day was sitting on, you know,
probably got it from Joel Feinberg, no doubt.
WDQYM, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
How you doing?
Thank you.
Upcoming.
Neil, you are being prompt, pretty good diet.
Right?
You have pretty good success with them?
No.
You haven't?
With diets?
Yeah, I'm on a new diet called the slap off.
You heard of it?
Yes, like this.
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the Verizon Singular wireless line.
All the amateur comedians this morning, the guy with the...
Chew!
Yeah.
I think that guy needs to have his...
Chew!
...five would be a good idea so that he doesn't reproduce.
In fact, the thought of this audience reproducing quite frankly leaves me a little bit limp.
If I can say that, leaves me very unnervous.
Although I don't think we have to worry about too many of our chronic's reproducing because
that's not what they're into, you know?
If you catch my drift, we get...
WQAM, hello.
Cute life.
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Okay, Pally.
All right, listen, being 51 now, I really...
It upsets me getting older to think what things used to cost.
The 50 cent candy bar was a nickel we were young.
I have no shake in a hamburger, it was a quarter, so...
I don't know if you can use that on your pulpit, but things used to cost.
And watch your produce because they're full of chemicals.
Produce man out.
Oh, but at least he only got that in as a clothing shop today to produce God.
That was great.
Crazy person.
But he does have a good point.
But then, isn't that I won't be able to afford to live, isn't that, like, including inflation and all this ridiculous?
I remember used to be like a dime for a comic book.
Right?
Now, how much does a comic book cost now?
Does anybody...the kids buy comic books? I'm sure they do, obviously.
Yeah, I guess.
How do I...
Oh, how much did they cost?
All there were...there were like a dollar last time I remember...
A dollar?
20 years ago.
I think there might be a five-but...
I don't know.
There are about five bucks, I think, now.
For a comic book.
Get outta here.
Yep.
Five bucks for a comic book?
You've got to be kidding me.
You're a veteran, aren't you?
He might be.
That's a good buy one.
Maybe it's $3.95, who the hell knows?
Or could be...
Eight bucks.
But, could be.
I'll be there.
I'm off the job breakers.
We used to get out of this little...
And I wonder where all the money really went for all that stuff.
You know, little glass things.
Or the vending machines.
Or the vending machines.
Or the vending machines.
Yeah, probably.
They always had a sticker on the machines.
Yeah, yeah.
This goes to the American Legion and the veterans and the disabled children.
And, of course, they did not.
You know, the risk...
That guy put it in his pocket.
Oh, like Sean Canoney, they're with a homeless voice.
That kind of crap.
That kind of scam.
Mm-hmm.
All those glass globes, man, that had the job breakers were good.
Oh, my God.
Just tear...
I had one of those not that long ago.
A few months ago.
Were we still talking about job breakers?
Yeah.
Okay.
And I'm assuming we're talking about the same thing.
Nothing over something.
They were actually like gum inside after you sucked them long enough.
They were gum.
Yeah.
But the job breakers were not.
They were like solid.
And they had each layer was hot.
In fact, correct.
Sometimes you call them redhots, right?
Atomic fireballs.
Ooh.
Redhots were not job breakers.
Redhots were those little ones that you'd get in the box and you'd empty the whole box in your mouth.
Yeah.
And I don't think they make them as hot as they used to.
Either that or...
I don't think that's what I was going to say.
Or we've matured.
But they used to really be...
BAAAMING!
But if you eat too many that are...
BAAAMING!
I'm sure that makes you gay.
That's probably what happened to me as I ate too many of those damn redhots.
Redhots?
Oh, okay.
Or redhots.
Redhots, actually.
In upstate New York, whitehots and redhots, which you know thanks to our friend Wayne Arnold.
Whitehots are like, you know, hot dogs that are like made from pork.
They look like bratwursts but they're whitehots.
Mm-hmm.
And the...
Or in upstate New York they call redhots.
Either redhots are Texas hots.
And I have no idea what that means.
Why are they called Texas hots?
I don't know.
They started in Texas?
No, I sure doubt that.
Do you think hot dogs started in Texas?
Are you a crazy person or what?
Oh, yeah, I am a crazy person, but I know that.
Whitehots and redhots are Texas.
And that was Don and Bob's baby talking about living in the past.
God was that good.
Mm-hmm.

That was good stuff.
And now it's gone.

What's got me Coke bottles?
I don't know what the hell that is.
I don't know what the hell that is.

I don't know what the hell that is.
I don't know what the hell that is.
I don't know what the hell that is.
I don't know what the hell that is.
I don't know what the hell that is.
I beg your pardon?
Still talking about candy?
And what is gummy coke bottles? What is that?
I assume it's like gummy bears, but in the shape of it, flavor of coke.
Cucola.
Oh, I know the shape is.
I've never tried those, but I have seen them before.
They're actually coke.
Well try and you'll gag on them.
Are we getting close to a thousand out of the pool?
That's all I care about.
Once we do that, 9.19 will be enough to bad.
And you said it wouldn't hit a thousand.
Somebody chew way him. Hello.
Gummy coke bottles are great.
They're just like the little gummy bears, but they're in the shape of a teddy bear,
and they have some coke tasting chipper sauce inside them.
Ooh, gross.
Yummy. Bye.
See ya.
Well that was sweet.
That was really sweet, wasn't it?
Yes, that was cute.
Shane Gibson, the environmental Bahamas immigration minister,
whose friendship with Anna Nicole Smith touched off an island while a wild controversy
mon has abruptly resigned from his cabinet post.
I've been to Target of Relenless attacks.
My good name has been Be Smurched.
My integrity has been impugned.
Oh, I love this.
Be smurched and impugned.
And my character has been assassinated.
Never have so many lies and falsehoods been told Gibson said late Sunday.
I'm stayed on radio and TV in the Bahamas mon.
Although I'm stepping down from the cabinet, I have every intention of continuing my quest
to bring the full truth of this matter to the Bahamian people yet.
Gibson's relationship with Smith, the actress, was mysterious death in a Hollywood hotel
earlier this month, touched off an international custody battle over her baby girl,
has stirred controversy in the Bahamas mon.
A week ago, as you well know, photos of Gibson Smith and a warm embrace appeared in the
Nassau Tribune newspaper, sparking allegations that he'd given her special treatments
to grant her permanent residency in the Bahamas since he did not meet all the necessary requirements.
I unconditionally deny that I ever abused my ministerial office by granting Anna Nicole
any permit of which he was undeserving or for which he would not qualify in the Bahamas
and longest of immigration policies Gibson said Sunday.
And you know what I say in regard to the whole thing?
This should be everybody's biggest problem, isn't it?
I guess.
After the photos were first published, Gibson appeared alive on government-owned ZMS radio
and TV with his wife Jackie at his side and said the photos were completely innocent.
He did not have any sexual relationship with his celebrity and said his entire family
newsmith and a partner and lawyer Howard K. Stern.
Gibson's a member of Prime Minister Perry Christie's ruling progressive leader party,
a liberal party, whatever the hell it is, the PLP.
At the time of Smith's death, her baby daughter Daniel Lynn,
Danny Lynn, Hope Marshall Stern, was staying in the Bahamas with Gibson's mother.
All it goes on and on.
I can't take anymore, okay?
I don't care which body is hot, which body is warm, which one is the daddy, which one had the Tony.
I can't stand no more of that.
I'd rather hear about Coke bottle.
What is it, candy?
Okay.
Is that what it's called?
Gummy Coke.
Gummy Coke.
Yummy, gummy Coke.
I never saw that in my life.
Where would you find that only in the bottle caps?
Yeah.
How about your pardon?
At a candy place or places that sell a wide variety of exotic candies like Jackson's ice cream, for example?
Hmm.
What do you guys think of it?
They're trolling for more free ice cream.
Over the weekend, and it was great.
You know, Jackson was great.
Well, of course you pay.
They're going to give you a schlepper like you.
You're going to get free ice cream at Jackson's and you could increase it.
The guys when they were in here, they invited me over, but nevertheless took the family.
That's a good way to do it.
Don't be a schnorer, man.
Don't be a schnorer.
It's too much like South Florida.
Don't be a schnorer.
If they want you to pay up, just like Bernlaks here told me.
I never, I never believe in trying to pay back a favor with, you know, with a freebie is what he was trying to say.
Cheap bastard.
He's dead now, though.
I can say it.
Not that I was looking for a freebie.
I didn't even know I was going to meet him over there, you know, but came over and just tinkled all over me like I was the greatest things in slice to the halibah.
Oh, Mr. Rogers, all the people from Miami to come in here.
They all say they heard about us on your show.
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
And that, as you know, you've been there, right?
Where?
Bernstake House in Tampa.
No.
No.
You've never been there?
No.
How about you, Chris?
No, sir.
Really?
The Tampa is not exactly one of the places I travel to often.
Well, why not?
I'm not talking about all the time.
What do you mean?
The way you can't go besides push gardens.
Bernstake House and old people.
Crystal, trailer parks, rednecks, inbreds.
And that's one thing about Tampa.
Not everybody in that area lives in a trailer park, but they might as well.
Isn't that a good way to describe the Tampa Bay area?
Yeah.
The strangest conglomeration of people.
I don't know what it's all about.
They all look like the people in Nashville,
like the product of centuries of inbreeding, you know?
I don't say that because the Panthers are playing the lighting in Tampa tonight.
That has nothing to do with it, but they are.
Gellie will be on.
Well, again, is he going to be on, he won't be on TV tonight.
Asco is straighter, does the weekend games on TV for ESPN.
And so they get Gellie on TV.
And boy, when he starts speaking on, you know, the one thing about an HD set,
not only is the picture good, but the audio is sensational.
So it gets a really...
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
Stereo, it's just really fantastical.
924 on the pole, we're going to be very close.
Not one, I can over 1000 by the top of the air.
But we're closing in on it.
You're right, Chris.
I should know that when I sit down here every day, no matter what.
How stupid the pole question is, no matter how inane it might be,
no matter how lame of a star we get off to,
this audience comes through for us.
Not necessarily on the phone, just on the pole.
Or we'll be on the phone pole.
WDQIM, hello.
Yes, may I speak to you, please?
Speaking.
Hey, Neil, are they storing, uh, in the cold Smith and, uh, James Brown in the same spot?
Yeah.
They are?
No.
Ah.
Oh.
And then you know the interesting thing about him?
No.
He sounded like an articulate, almost intelligent person to me.
I mean, when I punched it up?
No.
Except for the fact that he asked to speak to Neil.
Yeah, exactly.
That should have been a tip off right in the beginning.
That was a little bit of a clue.
I wonder where they're storing his victim.
Asked.
20-till-noone.
Now, Clarice was in this morning in an incredibly good mood,
and I asked him for some programming tips.
He said, talk a lot of hockey to this.
Neil.
Yeah.
96 miles across the sea.
2 to 70 beaches of Miami.
Oh, great.
It's all it takes to reach it.
Save the talent.
And escape plans.
Escape plans.
Escape plans.
To throw away the radic lamp was on our head.
Now we have to use toilet paper instead.
Escape the new Miami.
Next target of a band.
A tropical paradise loaded with that.
The thing you wear out.
I don't know.
I don't know.
There's something a size thing.
Yeah.
But we really rather drink our tea.
The good, good splash of you.
Throw ten seas of hope.
Pointed towards Miami and off we go.
To where the angry humans swatter their goat.
To the attack.
Attack.
Attack.
Attack.
That's our plan.
The safe plan.
The safe plan.
The safe plan.
The plans are planned.
The safe plan.
125 is 560 WQA.
And I'm going to tell you something.
I think maybe I better have all my close personal friends sign a
an agreement that they're going to stick me in a home.
But I get to be old and feeble and see now.
Like any other couple of weeks.
Yeah.
Ah, like that.
Oh, I love doing that on the year now.
See, I used to close the day of Mike.
No, I don't do that.
But then it's going to take away the spot newty of it.
Now that everything is reality TV and reality radio and all
other BS.
What a fones you're kind of tailed off there.
We had a little something going for a while.
But we don't want to overdo it.
560, 7.0560.
Pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.
Is airheads is that also candy or is that I'm reading someone?
It is.
Yeah, I was airheads.
I don't know.
But it's candy.
I've seen it in the candy rack.
What happened?
No, I'm just, I'm just, okay, the latest message to explain it.
What was it we were asking about?
We were asking about the clip, what clip was it we wanted?
Oh, Judge Judy.
Now Brandon didn't respond about that.
Maybe he was listening to that part of the show.
Or maybe he just started trying to find all your crap.
I don't want to want to say that.
You're a stranger.
I love that.
It's sort of like a fruit flavored taffy and there's a number on your teeth though, he says.
Correct.
About airheads?
I never heard of that.
Well, I don't, I don't, in fact, in, um, Amsterdam.
Well, anywhere you go, there's all these great candy shops, you know.
Oh my god, I don't go in there.
In fact, on the dam racquet Amsterdam, there's a place called JAMIN.
Yaman, I guess you don't pronounce the jam.
Jammin.
No, they're not jammin at Yaman.
In fact, I think that's how you pronounce it in Dutch.
I could be wrong, but I think it's called Yaman.
Yeah, Yaman.
And that's where I get my Ben and Jerry's ice cream.
When you walk in the door right in the front, it's the Ben and Jerry's counter is there.
And then the back, it's just a gigantic candy store.
Talk about a kid in a candy store.
That's me and Amsterdam.
Well, that's another story.
WQAN, hello.
Not there.
Bad move.
Why don't I just punch up all the ones that aren't rainy?
WQAN, hello.
Hey, man, how are you?
Okay, sir.
Long time listener seldom call unless I really have something to say.
I have a question for you, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I lived in Cherokee, so I lived up in Baldwin, New York.
I'm so sorry.
Listen, you are on the radio station up there, WHN62, WHN.
No, but I know the station.
You do, over to every Chevy.
I could swear I was up there in like 75, 76 going to school.
I didn't know if you already down in Florida, but I felt that you were on the radio station up there.
I just not.
No, sir.
75, I was a WJN home Palm Beach in 76.
I was at WKAT online, maybe.
Catch the cat.
Neil, feel better.
Have a good day, buddy.
Thanks, pal.
You too.
I'm going to listen to that.
You're going to appreciate it.
Thanks.
Well, there's a good guy, even if he is from upstate New York City,
where you're from, you can't control or you were born.
You know, a lot of things in life that you can't control.
All you can do is just be who you are.
It'll be a wonderful person.
Be all of these things.
All of these things.
Yeah, especially if you're in South Florida.
In fact, if you're a nice person in South Florida, you stand out like a sore thumb.
I think this afternoon I'm going to go into the candy store.
There's one right off the street, no matter if fact.
It's like what you were talking about.
It's like that Yaman in Amsterdam.
That's a chain of places, by the way.
Yaman?
Yaman.
Yaman.
And I don't know.
I don't dare venture into the back of it.
It's one of those places where all the stuff is in jars and you buy it by, you know, you bag it and they weigh it.
You paid by the way.
Just like over in a red light district.
You paid by the lane.
What is that?
Oh, we're going to play the candy wrapper this hour.
I can't wait here.
Yeah, let's put the candy wrapper on it.
And let's just go home.
Now what is that?
It's the candy man.
But you're the favorite.
It's the candy man as one of your people.
What are my people's, up to people's?
Yeah, it's one of the most famous candy.
I see.
One way to fill out.
I was just going to play this.
Yeah.
Get on.
Uh-huh.
Get low.
So sit down.
I think it's the candy shop.
I think it's the village shop.
You're the girl and some stuff.
She's going to see it at the shop.
Oh, I think it's the candy shop.
Don't even have a taste of my mouth.
What the hell?
What does that have to do with it?
I guess you washed the candy down with the Jesus dude.
You put a little straw on the can.
I guess.
Candy man.
Now what is this?
Sounds like Frankie Rally in the Four Seasons Mine.
You're right about that.
He's a girl, candy girl.
What do I tell you, candy girl?
Why no my four seasons are water.
And it says that Brandon says if you love the sour candy, try warheads.
Ever have warheads?
Not lately, but it sounds good.
I do like sour candy.
You like sour?
Candy.
Oh!
I'm so glad the candy's something to have in you.
I'm already naked.
Oh yeah, let's play that instead of this.
It sounds like a mollor.
Yes and that.
Every time he speaks, it's the way God wants it to be.
Yeah, chocolate.
He can't even say the word right, chocolate.
He says a mollor on it and then they re-elect it.
Because he did such a fabulous job.
That's American people for their masochists.
The more you screw him over and the more incompetent and ignorant you are, the more they like you.
Look at it South Florida.
Look at all the idiots that kept getting re-elected a year after you.
How about you remember where I was?
His name John Lamello and some rise?
Okay.
I think he croaked in me.
I wonder what he said.
Lemon jello.
John Lamello.
Many Playboy playmates have died young.
Did you know that?
No.
What do you do now?
See it's an educational show for those of you out there.
You nay sayers?
You nay gay sayers?
The slushed event in the Coldsmith is a Playboy Playmate in 1992 made a remember of an exclusive
sorority.
Her death at 39 put her in a more grisly club.
Playmates who haven't reached their 50th birthday.
Automobile accidents, drug overdoses, homicide.
There's that homicides of playing crack.
All of playing lives of playmates.
The cause of Smith's death is still unqueer.
It's sad how many girls we've lost at Peter Gowlin who photographed a number of center
folds for Playboy in the 50s and 60s with the help of his wife.
In 68 Gowlin photographed Paige Young.
In 74 she was dead of a drug overdose.
Jane Mansfield of the Playmate he photographed died in the car crash in 1967.
He was only 34 and boy did she have a peer on her.
Yes, she did.
It's a curse to be beautiful, Gowlin said.
More than 600 women of Grace Playboy center fold since the magazine began publishing in the 50s.
Their lives after the magazine have been both in and out of the spotlight.
But their limited number in Playboy's wide circulation has meant that the death of one can become bombshell news.
Bombshell baby who in a bomba grande.
Perhaps the force met the most headlong grabbing death of a playmate was that of 20 year old Dorothy Stratton.
Never heard of her, did you?
Yes.
Just months after she began the magazine's Playmate of the Year in 1980,
she was murdered by her jealous, estranged husband.
Oh, you probably would.
She was the playmate of the year in 80.
Playboy founder Hugh Hefner said that he and others never really got over Stratton's death.
The magazine ran a tribute to her and her movies were made about her life.
There's a picture of her on our wall in here.
And is there really?
Has Galaxina.
Even Meyer, a 55 playmate, was one of more than 550 people killed when two airliners collided on takeoff at Teneree Bay in the Canary Islands in 1977.
She was only 46.
More recently, Ellen Louise Malego, known as in Playboy a star-stowe, was found murdered at 40 in Coral Springs in 1997.
I didn't do it.
Oh, sounds really demoted, and they Chris?
I didn't do it.
You did it.
You never heard of it.
Marilyn Monroe, the cover girl for the magazine's inaugural issue, famously dotted 36 from a 62-ovalosal sleeping postal legs.
She was murdered.
We all know that.
Another thing about this new footage of Jackie and JFK that they keep showing on all the newscasts,
which doesn't really show anything except them smiling in the limo, a minute and a half before he got assassinated.
And every one of the narrations on the newscasts about this is, well, it shows the Texas book depository where Lee Harvey Oswald shot the fatal bullets and blah, blah, blah.
And even though there's a conspiracy theory, there is no doubt that Oswald was alone in the session.
Right, Yamama, right.
This is the kind of brainwashing that goes on in America that's passed off as news.
Maybe the person that shot this new video is the one that actually killed him.
Yeah, there you go. Maybe it was Cock Robyn.
Or maybe it was just Robyn.
Tanya Cruz, Carol Willis, in 1970, played me to the air clothe of Jenny's all-died in car accidents in the 60s and 70s while still only in their 20s.
Playmate Willie Ray pictured on Playboy's first stock certificates was 23 when she died of a drug overdose in 73.
Boy, 28-year-old, Playmate, Elizabeth Bridges died in 2002 after being found unresponsive and dead.
Oh, there's nothing worse than being unresponsive and dead.
I know.
Playboy sent you died of natural causes, but a coroner's report said Bridges died of an accidental drug overdose.
There have been some that do too much booze and too much drugs, just as in the general population said former Playboy editor Grechian Edgren, author of the Playmate book six decades of centerfolds.
A page on Playboy's website is dedicated to remembering Smith.
Perhaps Billy Joel should write a sequel to his song, Only the Good Die Young, simply changing the last word to beautiful.
Only the Good Die Beautiful.
Well, Miss you, Vicki, photo editor Gary Cole wrote on the site's blog using Smith's real first name.
That emotional doesn't it like make you want to just break down and get all Lucy and Lucy and Lucy?
Lucy? How's Desi doing, by the way?
Dead?
He's still dead.
And so I guess everybody on the show is dead.
Lucy and Desi and Vivian, what was your name?
Vivian Pants.
In your pants.
William Farley.
What?
William Farley.
William Farley.
Farley?
William Farley.
I don't know where the R goes.
William Farley?
How about Farley?
Granger, man.
Well, you better know your Lucy for a Cuban guy.
You should know your Lucy stuff.
I know his name.
950 votes.
I can sing Babalu.
Babalu?
How about Babalu?
Huh?
Exactly.
What does that mean?
It means anybody who would say it is a moron is what it means.
950, during the next hour, we'll get our thousand.
Chris, he was spot on as they say.
And why did they say that spot on?
Why did the British talk like so stupid?
Why did they always do that?
What's up?
Was that what it is?
You realize that it's already 38 and it's going to be 40 today here?
Holy moly, it's a freaking heat wave.
The biggest name is of this talent.
I'm going outside naked.
Oh, me, Mr. Boots.
And I've been living in the 12th of the Warner Nile.
Oh wow.
And we realize and we have for no reason at all.
Unless you run on this land, or make your own a fall.
You don't need to go to rehab for something that you say.
There's no step for a whim for Higgins or one game.
Yes.
If you just threw one jam, you're supposed to be a little grass.
You don't need to go to rehab for making racial slurs.
Or if you're on the way, happens to be her.
Rehast not for exhaustion or something you need to spend.
Rehast not for food, be squeezed, or put in conflict to see.
You don't need to go to rehab.
Just apologize.
And control your ego.
Stop making a noise.
Come on to it 560.
WNQ, I'm happy Tuesday tonight.
Amari is Ask Wednesday.
It is.
Oh no, I better get some butter.
Wow.
Is it really?
I thought Ask Wednesday was before Easter.
Am I getting confused?
Let's go ask Wednesday and good Friday.
You better get one at my house.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, well it's evidently too long.
Look at the calendar back there.
Yes.
That's one day is Washington's birthday.
Really?
It means today's Marty Grubb bean.
Well, we don't celebrate Washington's birthday.
Where we did that yesterday with President Stain.
And everybody at QAM, Bushman's holiday.
All kinds of people took off like it was a real holiday.
Slackers.
And they know what Friday is.
Why big party?
You know what Friday is.
What is that?
You'll off at one.
Oh, excellent.
Now we're talking.
That's the kind of holiday that I like.
Georgia Beyond One.
Do you remember that by the way?
George?
Yeah, I'll be playing music and talking about religion.
All right.
Kind of show that Clarence can really sink her teeth in it.
Or maybe playing religious music.
You know, this fast that you sent me,
this is really, well, I mean, there's nothing here.
It says very interesting article link below.
And it's got a link to a New Zealand, you know, this long link.
And of course, the only way I would go to it is to
detect the whole damn thing, which I'm not going to do it.
It says the end might be closer than we think.
Check the link.
Check the link because the end is closer than we think.
And that really stink.
It's very interesting article for me, New Zealand paper.
See, I don't want to go on a year on a great day like this.
It's going to be 40 degrees today.
I'm on a great mood, life is sweet.
Everything is good.
And I got to go on a year reading stories about how the world is going to come to an end.
I don't want to read that kind of story.
I'll pick it out.
It might be humorous.
What do you mean, check it out?
You check it out.
I'm going to check it out.
Oh, you're going to check it out.
Yeah, you go ahead.
I'm typing it in there.
It'll take me an hour.
So right ahead, have yourself a great time.
Tomorrow's Ask Wednesday for all your religious notes out there for all your guest keys.
Yesterday we had one of those really great calls, man.
We had a couple of them, but one really great call from some religious notes.
Well, the Bible says this and he's doing all this live to his crap.
And of course, he would know live to his from Leviathan.
I mean, he didn't know what the hell I'm talking about.
And the Bible says this and yadi,adi,adi,adi.
And as soon as I start hearing that, I say goodbye.
I know I'm dealing with the mood of a crazy person.
And all these years that have been screaming and wailing about this stuff.
Oh, he's an atheist and he's this.
And the meantime, take a look at the world today in which we live.
Take a look at these crazy people.
It's the Shiites and the Shi'a, the Sunnis, but it'll be pretty open.
He's really the Jews and the Arabs again.
Good.
Golly Miss Molly.
You only think after 5,000 years they could cut the crap already.
At least agree on what's kosher and what's halal for crying out loud.
One thing about the Jews and the Arabs, they're both circumspect and not too big of that pig.
WDQ, I am hello.
I got a confession to make.
Yes.
If you don't mind.
I went to Saras for a year and it sucks.
You went to what?
I went to Saras for a year.
For a year.
And I got to tell you the reception sucks.
Sturns are not funny anymore.
Oh, serious, serious.
Why can't you say it's why I can understand it's serious.
I can't get it out.
Yes.
Yeah.
It's serious.
But it's okay.
I'm not going to pay money for radio.
Even with all the big bucks I got, with all the extra cash that I got, I'm not buying radio.
No thanks.
It would be like pay TV.
What's the last time you're buying radio?
I know they still have it.
All of us have cable.
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about watch a premium.
How about you Chris?
You watch this pay-per-view crack?
Nope.
I was my case.
Who's going to pay the listener radio?
And quite frankly, I can hear all about Howard Kastern for free.
I don't need to listen to Howard Stern.
Hey Robb, anything else Robb?
Anything else Robb?
Anything else?
Remember those days?
It was kind of like he just refused to go home.
I mean, this is a guy who I got.
I mean, with the gigantic money he's making I can understand.
It's one thing to love your work.
But when you love it to the point that you want to stay on forever, and they have to drag you out of the studio, bodily kicking and screaming, you know?
Don't you think it's a little bit over the top?
I love it, man.
Evidently.
WQAN, hello.
QAN.
Hey, what's up?
Yes, sir.
Wanted to talk to you, Neil.
Speaking.
Neil Audrey.
Yes, I am.
I just wanted to find out what to gain, what your plan is for the O.A. President or election.
What my plan is?
What were you voting for?
Which way am I voting?
You have to ask me which way I'm voting.
Barack Obama is the man, sir.
That's the accurate question.
I agree with you.
I will vote for him.
I'm an independent.
I agree with you 100%.
I agree with everything 400%.
Sharp guy.
Read what he's written.
He's a smart guy.
He was against Bolton to be appointed to the...
He said that Bolton was revolted and I attend to a group.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Same thing with Robert, the Supreme Court of the...
No, they were appointing him.
Sharp.
He was against the war from the start and he warned against it.
He was right all along.
That's what we need.
From the back he's the man, man.
Well, I'm an independent.
I'm telling you.
Hillary is the one.
I won't vote for her.
From the other side maybe Giuliani.
Oh.
That's my two cents.
Okay, Pally.
I like Barack.
You're right.
That's the guy.
Vote early enough.
I'm saying goodbye.
Vote early enough.
Just say goodbye.
It's a good idea.
We're probably getting close to a thousand votes on the poll.
I say, moment 970.
We're creeping along because you know when you get to be old like me
and all these other people that are voting about being old.
You kind of like Chris a little bit.
You know, you're Shufflin.
You know, like rushing over the computer to cast your vote.
You're taking your sweet time.
Ten votes for my kids are going to stick me in a home.
Well, guess what?
Let them stick this.
I guess that's one good thing about not having any kids.
Is it not going to be around to stick your ass in the home even though you don't want to go
and you're kicking and screaming?
I don't want to go.
Yeah.
WDQAM.
Hello.
QAM.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, you just made me think about what you're going to do.
You said you would never pay for a radio.
I was in Walmart the other day buying a television and they said,
as of 2009, there would be no more free TV.
Right.
Do you know that?
Meaning what?
What does that mean?
You know, you can't get TV stations from the air anymore.
You're just going to have to have cable or nothing.
I think your first mistake was going to Walmart.
Well, they had a sign on the television saying that.
As of 2009, that's a pretty big deal.
Yeah, if you don't have a cable.
That's true.
And isn't it a little unconstitutional?
Don't you think?
I don't know.
Yeah, it says right in the Constitution that TV's got to be free.
I remember James Madison wrote that as a matter of fact and they fourth amendment.
Remember that?
It's one of the Bill of Rights.
Fourth President wrote that and the Bill of Rights, he said,
TV's got to be free.
Remember that song by the rest of those people got to be free?
Yes.
TV got to be free.
What is he talking about?
How they going to cut the signals off over there?
They're all going to be on, coming from a satellite?
I knew you were going to free that.
He looks cavalier, man.
He's not dead, is he?
I don't think so.
I sure hope not.
They were good.
Yes, they were.
I would say 1969.
People's got to be free.
I could be way off on that.
But that would be my best guess.
Is that my last guess?
68.
See, I'm always within one.
And if you're within one, the board goes back and it's okay.
You've got concentration and constipation.
I did like that show concentration, even though you didn't.
No, I like concentration itself.
And then it was classic concentration.
You were just 40 hours.
It was just hours to be.
I bet you're pardoned?
Will a fortune that I found very boring and easy.
974 votes on the pool.
I'm not saying the word.
You know, you just every now and then, you're two colors.
It's flat right now.
You know, he's out of the will, isn't he?
He was never in it.
You know, you know something?
Well, yeah, the rascals again.
Groove it.
No, close though.
It's a beautiful morning.
Oh, which reminds me of the parody.
I knew we had a great parody that I love.
And I never played it because it starts out in such a low, you know.
That's Groove.
Right.
Something it sure is.
It's a terrorist one.
It's a terrorist one.
You see, when I've discovered I was talking to somebody about this the other day.
And that is this, that whole business with a Jacob D.
You know, I remember in the will and all the controversy.
See, Norma Kent, as you know, occasionally is very, you know, got his thumb on it.
But occasionally, he doesn't know what he's talking about.
You can put anybody in your will.
You don't even have to tell them about it.
If I wanted to put you in my will, I could do it.
I don't need your shoe size and all this overcraft.
I can, you know, where there's a will, there's a way.
That's right.
See?
I mean, somebody could tear the check up.
You know, that's their option.
Turn up for the problem.
Never the last.
Won't bother me.
I'm going to be dead anyway.
What am I going to know?
Right.
I'm going to be insulted.
A Rydians, dumb ass jerseys.
I'd say like number one in Mid-Dayson's, have any of this talking about it?
That's what he thought about it.
Let's see about Insertion.
Oh, let's get that in there, John.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
I'm going to be late.
Look like it's time to tell my change.
Question about this, don't always say the same.
All that I'm going to do, it never tells me to do.
Because at her rates, she must be insane.
Just sitting here, resting my bones.
Worrying why my wife won't leave me alone.
We've talked it over, but I never win.
I just wind up schlepping through the wall again.
Oi, so I sit on the bench in the array.
Reading for the lonely bastard take me away.
Oi, you're just sitting on the bench in the array.
With my phone, crying.
There it is.
About ten times I've been waiting all day and I'm getting this bitch.
I'm going to be late.
It's our time, sonny.
It's our time.
That was one of the most disgusting events I've told you about
a Chinese restaurant eight or a hundred years ago.
Somewhere in Broward County.
Going with a friend or two and we're in all these old conkers
are standing in line.
I don't remember the exact conversation, but it came down to ball.
Like they were ahead of us.
And what am I doing here anyway?
It's our time, sonny.
Sonny, my ass, I was like 40 years old.
Yeah, sonny.
Of course, compared to her, I was sonny.
She was about 140.
And you should have said, I'm sorry I understand you're going to be dead soon.
Please go ahead.
And guess what? That's a good news she is.
In fact, let me dance on the graves a lot of the detractors
like that first week I was on the air at WKAT 1976.
March of 1976, boys and girls.
And I'm on the air and I finish up my first week
and comes this nasty old,
a hateful, miserable bastard on the phone.
Hey, Rodgers, you stink.
You'll never make it a year in this time.
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM.
And of course, the good news is he's dead now
because that was 31 years ago, almost.
In fact, a week from Thursday, it'll be 31 years exactly.
What's everybody getting me for my 31 anniversary?
I'm going to give you my best wishes because they don't charge you, you know, customs on that.
I see.
Oh, and that's right, that would be better if you put something in the box.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wrong.
Well, guess what the package is down to the FedEx from chicken head. Yeah, you think some you in here this week or not?
No, well good. Well, next week I'm gonna give them something this week for next week. Well, that's good. Oh
Like I got that and what else am I gonna get the all the little Richard thing? Oh
Yeah
Somebody out there's got to get us the judge duty drop where she says you're a stranger
That's gonna be a tough one. See I never heard that I heard you do it. What you do right? Very well
You know some things you do well something
Oh, yeah
991 on the pull by the bottom of the hour by the time the little hand hits your ass. It's gonna be a thousand votes on there
And Chris is right. I was very well when I sat down here this morning at about eight twenty or whatever
There were like 500 and some odd votes and I thought well, that's not very and that's not a good sign
You were worried I was extremely worried because we don't get to a thousand. It's like a it's like a blow to my ego
You know, and of course I don't have any ego
But it's it's not good. It's just it leaves you with a bad taste. I'm out like those gummy bears
Or what was it that Aaron summers was only talking about oh
That had to be one of the worst shows in the history of radio a
Nickel put that in here. I'm prude doing a sex show. Yeah, prude doing a
In which you're not allowed to really say much of anything anyhow, but there was a oh and of course like Steve Nichol said
He didn't care what the show was good or she got ratings. She's got a great ass
That was his line. She's got a great ass. She also wouldn't let gay people on until we found out about it
And you made fun of her for it and then all of a sudden that policy changed really. Yeah, well, I'll be damn
It's kind of like when I had that dating show on W. Just New Year's ago
I wonder if there's still any couples around that got married as a result of the show
I got a lot of people hooked up in the married from the dating show and I apologize for that
Because there's nothing worse than being involved in getting people married. Oh, you know, I don't have to tell you
What five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and leave Verizon singular wireless line WQ. I am hello
Q. I.m. With the radio off
Okay, sir
I just got a couple things first of all what is your thoughts and feelings on global warming?
It's bad. That's my thoughts and feelings. It's bad, okay
Whoo
What's your thoughts and feelings pal? You about about that?
What's your thoughts and feelings George about what I'm too old have any thoughts and certainly much too intensive
Feeling I have thoughtless feelings. I know that
995 votes on the pool not too bad the old fart's pool. That's me
In fact 96 of us that I am old
Now is that mean chronologically or I don't know
Wanted to me well, I don't I don't want to sound like old because then Joel Feinberg across the street
I'll say see the man who's old Jews on the air over there. Who the hell are you to be talking about Jews Joel?
My name Feinberg and he's got that stucuses need you wish all so what's his name? Yes, of course weener. Yeah John Weener boy if anybody ever lived up to their name man
God those people are and of course now that's a football season
The one thing that left me so limp and there has been no nothing written about it. Of course not in this town
Because we don't have anybody with any real opinions
They write articles that are really worthwhile very often in the newspapers and the fish wrappers
But Jimmy Cifalus being brought back regardless of which station is going to get the rights for the dolphins
I mean that to me is absolutely
Unspeakable and that too it's unspeakable
In fact as as Luda Chris is this may sound before you know
It's something there was no play by play guy around I would bring Mo back before I put him on there
You agree Chris?
Yeah, I actually heard about a
Howard David saying hello to I guess Sid yesterday
Sent sit a text message according to Jesse
Send him a text message about what about doing the games saying hello. I heard you today. You sound greater
I don't know I was it was as I was leaving yesterday
Jesse was coming in because he had his show last night. So he said yeah during one of our commercials
He flipped over to that other station. Yeah, and Sid said on the air. Hey Howard. Thanks for the text message
Just got it. Thanks for whatever blah blah blah. I'm like that's just sad
Isn't that pathetic birds of a feather lose together? Well, he can go over there and have a you know a point nine or whatever he had last time
It was on this station. Hey, you'll never guess what's on MSNBC right now. What's that?
And it's cool. Okay, I'm gonna go on MSNBC
Whatever it is. Oh, yeah
Question why there's Howard K. Sturren personal relationship with Annacole began in 2000. Here's the
Who guarding her intentions for the burial plot?
I'm gonna plot if I fear any more of this
Or there's some kind of a plot that you're behind begin to trim you under this crack
The problem
Almost ever new a relative personal relationship with him again in 2000. Well, what does that really mean personal relationship?
Is that is that in regard to the old inout is that what they're talking about or what is that?
It was
When did that begin when
When did it become the
Yeah
Probably about a week and a half
After Dan was I before that
I
Was in consolaboo
That's what I'm upset about is the kid died now and everybody pissed me off
You could have cleaned him up a little bit
Given machine with the shower
Would you would have given him the detox treatment? Yeah, I would have cleaned him up for David's a bitch
Where
When
old
you
I'm sure that Moe's love for Sid and the kid over there across the street is because
it's packed these on opposite me and anything that just like the time he went on that
other show, remember that?
Yeah.
Anything that he can do to deep success, how are we going to survive if Moe's buddies
with Sid across the street Sid and the kid?
A couple of guys that got bounced out of New York, I'm sure they had that in common.
Here's the facts that explains what that guy was talking about, which I had forgotten about
this.
Depending on the outcome of the discussions in Congress, television as we know it may
end at exactly midnight, December 31, 2006.
Wow, somebody must have told everybody.
This is from the MSNBC website, okay?
It's all.
Yeah, as you already noticed.
Yeah, December 31, 2006, now that it's February 20, 2007.
That's the day Congress targeted a decade ago for the end of analog television broadcasting
and a full cut over to a digital format.
So I guess they pushed it up to 2009 according to what the other guy said, I don't know.
I mean, you sluppers out there with your rabbit ears.
If you can't afford cable, please.
George will pay the bill.
Just send the bill to the sale.
Yeah, George will agree.
What?
No problem, man.
If enforced, that means that overnight somewhere around 70 million television sets, now connected
to rabbit ears, rooftop antennas will suddenly and forever go blank unless they're owner's
purchase a special converter box.
Back when legislation was written New Year's Eve 2006, probably looked as safely distant
as the dark side of the moon.
But now that date is right around the corner.
It says, what's the date on this thing?
I don't know.
It does never date on it.
And Congress and the FCC are struggling mightily to figure out what to do.
Congress, however, looked itself a loophole in the 1996 legislation and could actually
let the cut-off date slide by, which obviously they did.
It's slud by.
But powerful lobbyists now are pressing legislators to set a date certain for the analog
lights out.
Lights out with Frank Gallup, I remember that show on Monday nights.
Oh, that was a scary show.
Lights out.
The debate over when to throw the switches is a strange group of big money.
High technology, homeland security and the single unanswerable question.
Just how angry are the couch potatoes going to be?
It's also a textbook example of the future almost never happens as fast as technologists
promise.
How many people, 70 minutes, to many?
70 million ravideers?
Yeah, in bare mind, there are people that live in like a rural area.
In the sticks, yeah.
In the sticks, baby.
In the sticks.
In the poor or, you know, those weird people that just aren't interested in television.
Like all those sluckers in Caracas that I told you about when I drove in the camp from
Los Montañas down in the downtown sea.
And everyone of those little huts had a tin roof and a little TV antenna on top.
So they had their little TV, they didn't have probably no food at that night.
But then of course at night time they go down and rob the abacords in downtown and get
enough money to know about whatever they want.
A bunch of booze.
Here's the fact that says don't show your age.
You're talking about satellite radio working is like your parents saying no one will pay
for cable.
Satellite blows regular radio away, new pull for you, think that needle is out of touch.
Oh, things that needle is out of touch with.
And they sent that twice just to make sure that you didn't really have.
Just to give me a little stoch.
Yeah, satellite blows regular radio away.
That's why they had emerged the other day and between the two of them got 14 million subscribers.
I'm out of touch like your parents saying nobody will pay for cable.
My parents didn't say that.
I never said that either.
I always love cable.
I'm a big cable proponent.
It makes sense because it gives you lots of great choices.
Unfortunately satellite radio is, you know, I mean we got Dr. what's your name on there?
Dr. Laura.
Oh boy.
And we got a bunch of other opera is on there on satellite radio.
The same crap that you'll find on television for free or for cable, whatever.
So obviously that's one of Stern's people.
No question about that.
But you're ahead to send it twice.
I mean you're bringing out a lot of touch.
Things that needle is out of touch with.
You know my response to that is touch this.
I'm still doing fairly well for an out of touch old geezer.
Okay.
I'm not doing so bad.
I have very few complaints as a matter of fact.
I'm going to the fact that this business sucks.
What?
No sciatica.
No sciatica.
I have no brositis, bronchitis.
I have like no water pneumonia.
Got no leaves.
No doubts about it.
No doubt.
No doubt.
No doubt.
I want to scream a shout.
I got some fat.
I do want to scream in chat and twist in chat like the eyes of brothers.
You should have seen me do the twist baby and he's show hall.
The thought of you dancing is like.
It's like you're out to running.
It works out too well because you cut a rug dancing with.
The girl I was dancing with she just kind of like gave up.
She kind of looked at what I was doing and she thought like that.
I couldn't figure out why she kept wandering away from me.
Hey it's just it's more of a card.
It's very so queen.
Okay.
I'm not blaming anybody.
I'm blaming myself for being a little bit close.
And I was the only one.
And that's the eyes of the brothers.
That's what you said.
Yeah.
I thought maybe you would say the one by the Beatles which would really kiss me off because
of all the people who didn't need to be recording other people's crap.
Yeah there is.
And like Mr. Postman and all that stuff.
That they ripped off.
I mean they didn't need to be doing that man look at all the great stuff they don't need
to go there.
And George Harrison said that they had to go there and be stealing Motown stuff.
My God.
What is wrong with you people's?
1026 votes.
How do we pass the thousand I didn't even mention it.
We just breathed on by you know what like that like that bitch at the wood by another day.
Breased right on by but that was that was so rank.
I mean I can't I can't even there are no words to describe right in the middle of lunch
are apologize.
It was so rank and it really stinks.
God put my ass right in the tank.
But then of course if you win there it's money in the bank.
WDQ I am hello.
Hey Uncle Deal.
Yes sir.
You picked me up cold.
A long time lease and I'm from North Miami.
I'm living up here.
I have a tell you that to a couple weeks ago.
I wish I was a bunch of old yet this.
I moved to Lake Worth.
Right.
Wow.
Well I just heard 50 the 30th of March and I'm on the beach right now and it reminds me
of the days when I grew up in North Miami.
I was now harbor all over you know all the New York bags and Jersey and you know it's
a different world up here.
I mean it's like Miami used to me but it's you know I've not made the right choice.
I can tell you that.
But I just want to say I don't have a urgent a long time.
I turned you on and you're talking about all the old restaurants and I enjoy when you
do shows like that.
But it brings up a lot of memories of that at the time when Miami was nice.
For all of us so far it's right.
All of us so far.
And I think about serious you know I looked into that Stern deal and you know what it's
a place of money.
They think for 14 hours or any five cents a month they think it out.
I have a little boom box.
I have it in my car.
This guy takes off more and he's fine.
You know what I think he's really eight days lost.
There's so much a curse for it.
It's not bad.
Not above the lust.
He's pretty good.
He's kind of entertaining.
He's kind of like you know used to be when he used to be able to talk to him.
Yeah well he could just say crap right.
Right exactly.
Exactly before he had a value.
You can't even say crap you know.
He can't even take one now.
But he has pretty entertaining.
I mean he's going off the wall.
I mean I be slugs.
Stern's boring.
He's not being boring to me.
I'm a good one as I talk to you and good luck.
Okay thanks pal.
Don't get old.
Or too late.
1029 votes on a pool.
So that guy's not all I'm impressed.
Listen if you like XM Radio, if you like Serious, if you like Sad Light Radio, great.
If you like fish go on and have a great fish dinner okay.
I'm sure.
Let's pick up the 10.
I mean you know I'm not one of those people that says because I like it there for you have to like it.
Or because I like a certain kind of music you know.
You like it.
Oh boy.
My figure was already on the button.
You like it.
Oh man that's bad.
Do you like it?
No, not that one.
That's I can't believe you did that to me.
I was just right on the verge.
My my mind deck's finger.
I'm just thinking straight up in the air.
Yeah.
Faster.
1029 on a pool.
What's our goal today?
Our goal is a thousand.
I would say.
But third man.
We go on more vote a thousand thirty.
That's good enough for these people.
Well that clearest this morning comes in here.
He was sure.
He was licky licky kissy kissy.
I couldn't believe it.
What was that all about?
The other day off.
He was in a good mood.
I was going to go to the next work yesterday.
Boyz right?
You got to give him more days off.
What's the next?
Keynes.
Oh look at that.
Talk about my psychic powers.
Keynes basketball tomorrow night against Virginia but it must be a home game.
Because otherwise he wouldn't be there today probably.
Must be a home game right Chris.
Is it a home game?
Who knows anything about Keynes basketball?
Steph.
Knows what he engineers the games.
Exactly.
That's all he knows.
That's all he knows.
Oh no.
It's the same.
Steph that came in this morning and hooked the Georgia jump with that monitor.
Steph that's all down.
But he couldn't tell you who they're playing.
He just knows when he has to be there.
I see.
Well he must also know where he's going to be.
That's right.
Since they're playing Virginia tomorrow with a banjo underneath.
It must be a home game for the Hooray Keynes.
And I also noticed that Hooray Keynes baseball is starting up again pretty soon.
Did I dream that or what?
It's already started.
This Sunday February 25 inside the batter's box for a Keynes baseball free game.
And the Keynes versus Elon.
What is Elon?
Is there really such a place?
I know in the beginning of the season they always play a bunch of girls schools.
You know, like Buffalo and all these other pansy colleges.
What is Elon?
It's Sisters of the Poor Part 2.
Seriously, what's on the Zags?
The Keynes against Elon?
I'm going to Google it during a break.
I never heard of such a place.
Well they just lost two out of three to the Gators this past weekend.
Oh no.
Not for the free weekend.
They took three against UCLA.
I see.
Well there you go.
I think I'm going to come back and do UM baseball again.
Boy I was awesome.
You know I'm legendary.
I'm legendary doing the talk show.
But I was even more legendary.
Those six years I did UM baseball.
I was sensational.
And the secret, the secret of my success beside the fact that I'm great in legendary was
the fact that I had that extra microphone for crowd noise.
And I stood twisted and tweaked during the game.
And then the microphone too.
The ball.
That explains a lot.
I twisted and tweaked it and of course George was smoking.
So you can see the f***ing ball.
Tonight on the funeral channel it's a very special look at presidential

Join us for 21 guns, 6 feet under on the funeral channel.
Then stay tuned for funniest funniest funniest funniest wakiest wakes with all new ball bearer

Can you hear that?

No no.
It's just me.
Gotcha.
That's a good one.
Funniest funniest funniest wakiest wakes has all your favorite burial blueberries.

He was a volunteer crossdresser.
I mean crossing God.
I'm sorry.
Let me start over.
Always a nice full of polarity on the funniest funniest funniest wakes.
Following 21 guns, 6 feet under.
Tonight on the funeral channel.
What does that say?
It says a correctional facility in North Carolina.
Elon.
Is that correct?
Oh no.
That's correct.
Elon University.
I think I read that wrong.
I know why they're playing Elon.
A private comprehensive co-education author said correctional answers.
Why are they playing them?
Because it is the alma mater of Jim Morris, the baseball coach.
So he has one of the schedule every year.
Give me a break.
Jimmy.
What is wrong with you?
Who now wants to go see Elon University?
Who now ever heard of such crap?
You know who else graduated from there?
Give me a clue.
He wants one.
He wants one other coach for you, huh?
Head coach?
Ron Fraser.
No.
Let me go.
I don't have any idea who the current coach is.
Frank Hayes, the basketball coach.
Like I would know that.
And Trader Jack McKeehan went there.
Yeah.
Is he still alive, by the way?
Yeah.
He's smoking cigars.
Mmm.
He's talking about old.
Well, see.
Here's another one.
And this is the one I wanted to read the story from New Zealand about the world's coming
to when and get everybody depressed, which I won't do.
It says, have XM radio for a year and a half?
Subscribers, you ran out a few months ago.
Haven't renewed.
No reason for XM if you're in the music with Adventive iPod, etc.
But for sports nerds, XM series is good.
Or if you're in the National Talk Radio, I think it's geared to people who drive for living
salespeople, truck drivers, etc.
I have a feeling after trying it out, not many people will not renew their subscriptions, etc.
How do you like that?
And of course, what talk shows are you going to hear on there other than Stern and Bubba Love Faucet?
What are you going to hear?
Talk that is not in the National Talk Radio.
I don't know.
Is an Opry and Anth, the Anthony on there?
Oh, Opry and Anth, and the XM?
Well, I'm what about, don't forget.
You're forgetting two of the most important people.
Died on Mike!
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
And don't care less.

You would Daniel wish with a life.
She wanted to crawl inside that space where he was.
All right, let's start the rapid start.
I mean, let's start the rapid up this this area.
You're on a r I would just request a joke seems awfully Jewish to me.
Doesn't it seems very Jewish? Yeah, crazy.
The answer would go for some period.
Crazy Jew with who?
With Mr. Stern.
What issue?
I would like him to both authenticate and I would like to inquire of him as to some tapes that were done of Ann and Nicole discussing both her relationship with her mother.
How about the tapes that were done when he impregnated her?
Are we going to see those or what?
And today's hearing to several who gets to bury Ann and Nicole Smith,
with Rower Judge Larry Sidelin, say I told you he was Jewish, told the cram courtroom they should give her in death a dignity and the beauties she wanted in her life.
Isn't that a lovely one of us?
That's sentimental.
Sentimental.
Crawley says about 1045 this morning is about 25 people, including Smith's parents, her companion Howard K. Stern,
and ex-lover Larry Birkhead went to the judges chambers for a closed conference.
But obviously they're back.
The first hour of the hearing was dominated by back and forth sniping as the attorneys jumped out of their seat starry with each other.
A near brawl it says.
Those that have like mini-mob scene erupts.
Christ of Barth Stern's attorney told the court that Birkhead's attorney Deborah Opry, I wonder if she's keen to win for you, Opry.
Opry?
She was during a filling smith during the proceedings.
Opry looked stunned.
I wonder if she's keen to the granola, Opry.
But did not deny the allegations.
If there's anything worse than country music, I've never heard it.
She remained tight-lipped.
I guess maybe similar rap music.
Some of that could pop.
Jazz?
Ah, all I jazz.
All I jazz sounds awfully gay to me.
She remained tight-lipped as the judge had managed all parties to keep the piece.
Keep the piece, baby.
Keep the face and keep the piece.
Just like over in the Middle East.
Keep the piece.
Before the recess, Scythe and Nurgie, everyone to cooperate for the sake of five-month-old Daniel Lin.
See, I can't say it right, and I don't care.
Smith's daughter, who's the subject of a custody dispute between Steward and Birkhead.
Doesn't sound like a spot on a ship, the Birkhead?
Yet does.
I see.
Right behind the bulkhead.
Yeah.
Scythe and Nurgie often use colourful language to help ease the tension in the courtroom, predict that one day,
Daniel Lin may see the videos of the hearing.
No one's going to say anything negative he said amid the Bickering Lawers.
I need positive vibrations here.
Oh, he could have gotten Brian Wilson to do that.
Let me ask you, Brian.
Do you like it?
Maybe one of it.
Have any of your partner?
There we go.
Boy, I'm sure a little slow.
Should vibrations, baby, as my least favourite B-4 song.
I like it.
I've been overrated.
Everybody says, oh, that's the greatest song, and that's the best song in the everyday.
That's a piece of genius.
I like the pieces of them all.
I like it.
I like the logic.
Not good.
I'm happy for it.
I want to hear the rest of the story here that you're reading.
Well, there we go.
That's not bad.
It's a reminder of every one of the child, Sadler and I, Stern, to write the baby's name
and magic marker on a courtroom, Asla, and Stern comply.
Write it and magic marker.
You idiot.
Well, this is like a stupid.
He's like a crazy person.
Is it a judge?
Yes.
The least he's got a whole ahead.
He's almost bald.
The least he's got a whole ahead.
I don't like the purple guy.
It's like a head.
Meanwhile, outside the courtroom, a parade of gockers lined up to Kensuk lips of the players in the case, the players, or at least to get a seat in the courtroom, which is open to the public.
About 10 people signed up at 830, hoping to snack one of the few seats left in the courtroom behind the media.
David and Linda Pillosov, snowbirds from New York, noted that the event was quite respectful.
This place is a zoo, it's a wild day, David Pillosov said.
But others weren't so impressed with the attention the case has brought to Fort Lauderdale.
A few screamed at the media to get a life.
Get a life.
I have no life.
Questioning why Smith's death was even news.
Amen.
But Smith fans said they can't get enough of the story.
First of all, if they're her fans, that doesn't surprise me in the least.
I am here in support of Anna Nicole, steering an especially Danielins said Gwen Walker or Fort Lauderdale.
I feel like I knew her personally.
She was our Cinderella story.
She went from rags to riches.
How's Tony Bennett doing?
I think he went from rags to riches myself.
And he still can't sing.
Walker brought Lauderdale to give Stern Pudgy her support and love.
We're very interested in court cases in general, especially this one,
which is everyone's attention David Pillosov said.
Where's that Pillosov?
A horror to reporters and some members of the public crowd outside the courtroom before the hearing began.
And it's going on.
If you're under a fire, it's just a lot of hope.
I have to do that one at the time.
I don't have time.
I want to see you.
I have time.
He's no excuse to violate the rules of evidence.
But I appreciate your reminding me of that.
You say it, you don't prove or hate.
But here's a fine effort, David.
That is totally foreign to the way things are going to be decided.
But I'm protecting you, Texas.
So when you ain't brought down any outfit, David,
when you get back to Texas, they're going to remember your text.
Let me ask you a question.
You're right.
This is a joke.
It's a comedy routine.
This guy who does his stand-up stick with every word out of honor.
If we could look at this important will during the lunch hour,
we might go faster when we get back.
They sing it.
I mean, like that, they're looking at Neil's world-yard during the lunch hour.
I'll be damned.
Of course, it's the 1256 or what though.
I think the lunch hour is on.
If not a tumor, it's the one to two hour.
Huh?
Looking for love in the deceptive way.
With somebody's picture stolen from my space.
No one would doubt if I had some of fake profile.
Trolling online.
Oh, no, no.

Oh, the time.
Everybody lies online.

First of all, that is the Howard Kister and I understand.
As you could have been covering the stage from the beginning.
And one of the new nuggets that he would say is that he is suggesting that he was sort of telling Anna,
well maybe you should be buried, maybe your final place, maybe all of our final place.
How could this story be complete without Rita?
Hey, Rita.
Who you been home to the desperate and lonely, even though I may be incredibly homely?
You never know it's my reason for nothing but lies.
Trolling online.
Trolling online.

The stage lies, the instant, that's the way it's worth time.

One, all three at five, sixty, WQ, I'm happy Tuesday.
I think I got the last of the flim out.
Didn't it sound like it?
I think one in doubt.
I got it out.
All I will say is that I'm going out for lunch.
Which I almost never do.
I have even a restaurant I would say maybe once a month.
But I'm going to like, I mean, nothing I got some kind of a limiter or quota.
What's the difference with me as long as it's good food?
But I'm going to go out for it and maybe give me some maceball soup today.
Wouldn't that be good?
Yeah, it would be.
It just kind of cleans up all of my throat.
Yeah, for my throat.
1,075 votes on the pool.
I think we got a real shot at 1,100 a day.
What do you think, Chris?
Oh, definitely.
Easy pickings.
Jackson seemed to have said it about his flavor wave this morning.
I didn't expect it to be like him.
Oh, he should have seen him jumping around.
I think he was around.
He did cartwheels.
Get out of here.
No, I'm serious.
He was an anti-climactic actor.
I probably shouldn't have told him ahead of time.
Look, I didn't have the microphone on when he first discovered it.
So, you know, he already leaped around the room or lepped.
He lepped around.
Like a lever than everything.
And then by the time he got on my lepper or schlepper.
He had calmed down considerably by the time he got on the microphone.
And he had a full mouth of cereal when he was saying,
I see.
He had a mouthful.
I wouldn't be the first time.
I'm not one of those people I expect somebody to kiss my ass if I do something nice for them.
I just, hey, that's tacky.
I hate people like that.
Oh, look what I did for you.
I hate that.
People do something so they can hold it over your head.
Right?
Can't stand that.
If somebody gave me $10 million, then they wanted to hold over my head for the rest of my life.
I mean, I'd take the cash and I would, you know, like disappear.
1978 votes on the pool.
The thing I hate most about growing old is.
Oh, the aches and pains.
I don't really have a lot of aches and pains.
I have like a little sinus here from this cold and from this changing weather.
I got a pain in my ass but it's gotten at me to grow an old.
No, it's your life.
It's one of those things.
Like Bobby Joby said, it's my life and my wife.
Oh, I'm sorry.
40 degrees.
It's 40.
It's 40 degrees of Fahrenheit in the big city.
I'm not going to ask you because you don't care because you don't care.
Okay, I care.
That means I can take a nice leisurely walk to lunch.
Lunch today have me a fine lunch with some mottable soup.
Maybe a little meatloaf.
Mm.
Thought, do you know anybody who doesn't like meatloaf?
Ah!
I'm not talking about the singer.
I'm talking about the food.
No, I know some about, you know, vegetarians and stuff but what do they know?
Well, you know, screw them, okay?
I screw them.
You can take your vegetarianism and stick it where the horse's ass hangs out.
That means more for me.
Oh, for me!
God.
People with their fetishes, you know?
Who in the right mind doesn't like a nice juicy stick?
You know anybody other than these?
I'll tell you the only people I know who aren't in the vet are the...
Peta?
People, yeah.
Right.
The fanatical vegetarians.
And even in their case, I haven't had a taste.
I think people claim to be vegetarians.
Right.
Sneak and ice burger or juicy snake steak that they want it.
Or they want it.
Never a snake steak?
No, but it's on the way.
Yeah, the blue which it produces is the custard or bellorites.
And that is of course assuming that they're still going to be flying.
I never flew jet blue.
And I'm sure you didn't either because you don't fly anywhere because you're a stripper.
They're going to pay all those stranded passengers and got tourists.
The whole airline business is really in bad shape.
Let me recommend to you very highly, okay?
KLM.
Okay.
Not to you but for the audience.
I'm just telling you, next time you go to Europe.
Spensive as hell.
But I mean, I guess in coach maybe you could afford it.
Schlepper class maybe back there in cargo.
Or they have the urge.
Steerage.
They have the back.
I'll give you the back.
I'll give you the smelly animals in the back.
Mm-hmm.
But I'm just telling you, they do a damn good job.
I'm doing a flying KLM.
I didn't always enjoy the boarding process.
And I think a friend of mine, my friend here, he and I wrote complaints.
We sent them emails.
Remember that about a year and a half ago?
Yeah.
And they actually paid attention every spot I do.
And they made a much greater effort to try to like board their flights in a civilized way.
As opposed to everybody going pushing up at the gate and the, you know,
and the attendance going, oh, what do we do now like that, you know?
The whole thing that does bug me though is that they board.
They let people traveling with small children on first.
First they put the GIMS on, which I can understand that.
Sure.
Every year, one does that.
But then they have people traveling with small children.
Then business class and elite, the platinum, whatever it is,
card members, then they go on after that.
When you're paying the kind of money to fly in business class that some of us do,
you don't care about those people with a small children.
Why did they got to get on first?
Can you explain that to me?
I can understand people who are handicapped or crippled or in a wheelchair or whatever.
But why did the people with a small children got to get on before they were people paying the big bucks?
Can you explain that to me, sir?
Probably because they're going to be walking by the people in business class,
being pains in the ass as they go.
No, they're not. The business class is off to the one side and then they're going to go in supper class.
They're going to make the right term when they get on there with those punky little kids.
Because I sure don't want them in business class with no crying little babies.
I'll tell you that.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
God. It's like a staff meeting at QAM.
Speaking of that, once the last time there was a staff meeting at QAM.
Well, they have all kinds of meetings all the time, but.
No, no, I know that.
We don't. No.
Not with the people on the year.
Not that you have.
The sexual harassment meeting was the last meeting that I attended.
No, we didn't.
Last year or some time.
And of course, I wasn't invited about that meeting.
I don't think I was invited.
No. How long was that meeting?
Was I up here?
I was here.
Yeah, there was one last year.
Yeah, a few months ago.
A sexual harassment meeting.
I was Greg involved in this.
No.
I'm not saying it is one of the, you know, I'm not sure which end of the meeting he would have been in on.
He might have attended one of them.
Yeah, he should.
See, the thing with me is when I was down there other than JP, who was, was he ever officially an employer?
Was he always an intern?
Here at this radio station?
JP.
JP.
Long Pablo.
Yeah.
I don't remember him that this radio station.
Have you lost your grasp online?
Granted, I'm not keeping track of these guys like you are.
He was one of your people.
He was pop-up on Pablo.
Of course, it was at that radio station.
He filled in for you when you were on vacation one week.
The Harry, you talk about him all the time.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
I talk about him all the time.
You talk about him all the time.
I talk about how Harry he was.
Yeah.
He was really Harry, but I don't remember his presence in this radio station.
I thought he was at the other place.
You've lost it.
Well, I'll take the word for him.
I'm supposed to be the one that's old and senile.
I can tell you about all the female interns or employees, few that they are that have been through here.
You can take of the guy.
That's your job.
I just go that he had a big old ball spot on the back of his head and hair like a gorilla sticking up out of his collar.
He had a ball spot?
Yeah.
He did his best to come over it.
Other than him, there was nobody there that I would have wanted with, especially harassing the first place.
And then after you told me about his hairy hair problem, his little red-brown wolf boy in Mexico, you know, that you see every once in a while.
Well, that's the way to go.
You can't remember him being there.
It's not that long ago.
In fact, he came back to visit once or twice.
Okay.
And he actually called me at home once.
He left a message on my answering machine.
How did he go?
I didn't speak to him.
I never called him back.
I don't know where that leg was.
Why would I call him back?
I don't know.
Hot gay sex?
Oh.
Believe me, from the stories he was telling me, he was having a lot of hot sex, all right.
But it sure wasn't gay.
No.
Tell me about all the things.
I guess he was in some fraternity and the thing that he did, he humiliated and he grayed the chicks.
He told you those stories, didn't he?
No, not to me.
Oh, he was in a fraternity.
That's all I need to know.
Yeah, well, there you go.
Oh, in other words, there was hot gay sex.
But not with me.
Anyway, I can't believe you don't remember him being there.
That's just whatever.
That would be like my saying to you, I can't remember what's your name being there.
The intern that you were like hovering over and having a crawl around like I don't expect to do.
You just mentioned it the other day.
Yes, I did.
What was your name?
Sheridan.
Shannon.
I was close.
I had the wrong SH.
But of course I remember her.
So what does it have to do with me?
See, your turn, this whole thing, and something that's not.
As you gay.
Yeah, that's right.
He was a pretty kid.
He was a pretty guy.
He was a nice guy.
He was a nice guy and a pretty guy.
And he wasn't all uptight either.
He never came in the set of my life though, but he wasn't uptight.
The thing I hate most about growing old, I won't be able to afford to live 251.
We got a thousand ninety-five votes.
Chris is right.
We can make 1100 today if we really put our nose to the grindstone.
What another stupid expression.
Put your nose to the grindstone.
You don't have a mind.
You guys may have a mind.
It's been the time that the guy stuck his dinging in the, was it a lathe?
Remember, that was an IOD I had the story.
Remember that?
It's a belt sander.
And we have it here on a, you know, on a CD if you want to hear it.
No, I don't want to hear it.
Anyway, it was a belt sander.
Wow.
No, we better not be telling those stories now.
That was the PJ days, pre-joice.
It was that I had to do with his dinging and he was trying to do what I was doing.
The thing was self-repair.
Yeah, it's grown.
It was doing a little self-abusing and it wounded up needing self-repair.
I love that dictionary definition of the word masturbation, self-abuse.
The thing I hate most about growing old is I won't be able to afford to live 251.
Young chicks won't like me anymore.
That's moving up 126.
The winky won't work.
Maybe that's why they don't like you.
126.
I am old, 107 of us old farts.
That's me.
Hair growing in my ears and clumps, 105 in chunks.
Everything droops, 100.
I hit this 482, 7.4%.
Not happy with that.
Nothing I'm looking forward to at 78 clowns.
I pooped my pants 64, getting close to death, closer to death 49, and my kids will stick me in a home only 11.
So, let me say, a thousand ninety nine during the break, big votes coming in.
That's your buddy.
No, no, he wanted it.
But he never told me that.
Damn, he didn't want it from you.
Oh.
0605.
Volcanoes.
Olbilo.
Olbilo.

Well, congratulations, get a life
What I'm tripped you, sure, is a way on air
Turn the ass in, don't look at me, I didn't put that in there
No, neither
I know I do them a little loose every now and then myself
I apologize, profusely
Not, not, loose, loose balls
11, 11 on the pole, 111 votes
By the way, can I send out a personal message for right ahead?
Tracey Narlins, in honor of Marty Gras, send us a Marty Gras King's cake
So, thank you Marty Gras, what?
King's King's cake
What does that mean?
It's like, as opposed to Queen, it's like roundish
Yeah, just like me, these round green
It's like a giant donut with all kinds of multi-colored frosting on it and it smells great
And we're gonna get into it right after the show
All right
Frosting up our elbows, thank you for your face
So dry
Well, I don't get any of it up here
Good
You said it's like frosted?
It's yeah, it's like a cake with frosting on it, but it's a...
Well, let me tell you one thing about that
That really frosts my ass a little bit
Yeah, well, I feel amazed when I use that sometime
Those are the days, baby, the hairy, carry days, the cub days
Of course, your famous trip to Chicago for five minutes?
Yeah
23 hours
You know, you know something that was so bad, that was so stupid
That show, were you there when I was actually doing the show, were you already gone by?
I had already been your producer for a year and a half
See, I had already missed the previous years
I was an asset for a sobster again, I was just asking were you still there?
I thought I was gonna go the previous year and Marvin went instead
And then the following year...
It says a hint
Yeah, exactly
And the following year they acted like...
Why is it that I would do that?
They hated you and a Q and they hate you too
What is it?
They seem to slip around with you
Because I'm your whipping boy because they can't punish you, they need you
And they need to be on good terms with you
But anything to do, when you fart, I get beaten
Wow
Oh
Oh
Anyway, they sent me in that room there in Murphy's Bleacher's bar right across the Mercury field
With a microphone and a phone and of course the calls were the usually nothing but cranks
I don't think we had like one real phone call that day
And of course nobody cared
I mean, you know, it's a sports show and on that station
Which certainly wasn't a sports station, we had sports talk from 6th to 7th or 9th
It was just a regular talk station
And so they blew away about 95% of the audience
And I'm supposed to sit there and do a show sitting in a room with a microphone
I mean, you know, I got through it okay, but then they bring over Bob Rennley
Who's an ex-cubbs catcher or a giant's catcher and becomes horrible broadcaster on the radio
And you know, I'm talking about the Cubs
Well, I bet Clara's would love that
A sports show
And it went over like, you know
Like an 800-pound pole vault or not good
Republican presidential candidate John McCain looking to improve his standing with the party's conservative odors
You know, you talk about a walker
How come Carrie kept you know like crap
This McCain is the worst freaking walker
And all of a sudden today is ripping the rumours fell to the ass now that he's long gone
He said Sunday the court decision that legalized abortion should be overturned
Oh my god
I do not support Rovers' way to be overturned here
His owner said it told about 800 people, 800 Yahoo's in South Carolina, one of the early voting states
Pandering to the red necks
McCain also vowed that if elected he would appoint judges who strictly interpret the constitution of the U.S. did not legislate from the bench
That's the right wing take
The landmark 73 decision in Robey Wade gave women the right to choose an abortion-determinated pregnancy
The Supreme Court has narrowly upheld the decision with the presence of an increasing number of more conservative justices on the court
Raising the possibility that abortion rights would be limited
Social conservatives, Nazis, are a critical voting block in the Republican presidential primaries
McCain's campaign also announced early Sunday that he had been endorsed by former Oklahoma governor Frank Keating
Who had been considering his own bid for the White House and former Texas Senator of the Drulling Field Graham
Who failed in his bid for the Republican nomination in 96
Keating told the crowd, he is the only candidate who is a true blue Ronald Reagan conservative
But a bit a bit a bit about and McCain scheduled that was attended rally a Sunday evening promoting an absence program
Which we know how well that works. He's just just sucking up to those right wing Nazis man
The Christian evangelical Nazi bastards. That's where he's coming from now
Got a good poll for tomorrow already faxed it there. How do you like that? Am I getting way ahead of myself?
Well that's because I'm going out for a nice leisurely lunch
Aren't you proud of me little mots of balls soup? I'm going forward to it. Maybe some meatloaf
Mmm, that doesn't have to be gravy
Here's the poll for tomorrow. See if you approve. I mean I've already sent it but I could change it
We have 215 by the way on our my space 215 friends
And I'm just wondering because I know you already told me about this you gave me a lecture about the way people respond
And the way people don't and the fact that you know I mean I've got my two close personal friends on there
They respond all the time but that's that's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the like a zirtec or whatever that guy's name was
I don't know what his name was beginning with a Zy something I mean he was on there all the time
And Harry Potter guy from Detroit he was on there all the time and there were a whole bunch of people who were like
And then Johnny G sends Georgian email this morning
And what did it say again? It said I'm sorry. Yeah
That's what I mean. I don't know the subject line said I'm sorry. Yeah. The message said I'm sorry
Well we don't know what he did and I didn't even say no for what? Did you do something to me that I don't know about?
I mean never responded. No. I'm sorry
Well maybe just sorry it looked in the mirror and he realized he was Johnny G and he said oh I'm so sorry he didn't send me no message at all today
Thank God maybe he's moving over into your territory now. Oh Johnny G. What does that mean?
What do you mean by that? Well he's he this is an email he sent to you right? Yeah. Oh I see what you mean like he's gonna start bugging me instead of you
Yeah. Oh man. Oh right. Don't be sorry Johnny George loves hearing from you. Yeah bring it on. What do you got?
Oh anyway here's this poll that somebody sent you know who sent it that Charles B who sent it about a hundred really good polls maybe this isn't one of them.
What is the reaction you get when you tell others you listen to me. Oh never done this. The first question is interesting. Yeah. Then I can't stand that bastard and then all right so do I as an laughter and then a bunch of swearing you get away from me.
He's still on I thought he retired or died. Who's Neil Rogers? That's cool. When's he on what station? You fncomy pinco ain't he the greatest? You like him too? I love him. He's the center of my universe. I want to meet him. Stalk him. Do him. Be him.
I don't tell anyone I listen to Neil I hate this poll. How's that great? I like the stocking option especially how about I want to skin him and wear his flesh. Yeah there you go. That sounds like a plan I'm sure wouldn't be the first time. I think we probably have a few people out there who would love to do that.
I can't I can't fight it now. I'm sure that's not the first time. Believe me. They'll be a career. I mean something as simple as that. I've lost my magic man just like those godfather clips I used to be able to just pull him out of my ass.
This is legitimate. Right. He was on biography a couple nights ago Al Pacino man I love him most of the time. The only movie he was ever and I couldn't stand was plus cruising which I didn't watch it. I watched just enough to get revolted and I made the mistake of watching it.
Yeah. Should have been called losing and boozing. He wasn't very depressing. Yeah very depressing and very morbid and very stereotypical. It's a fact like okay. Right and the moral of that fact movie as as is the case with most fact movies is the only reason that gay men are straight men are straight as because you just haven't tried it.
Don't you know I see.
I don't know I feel what I was about to see. You heard they were speaking in time. That's the first one that made me believe.
I thought my tongue to the beat.
I do forgive me. Cause now I speak in time. That makes me a believer. And I'm having fun.
Playing around with my mouth. I speak in time.
One thirty two orders. Mitt Romney and they're talking about courting the religious right. He's all of a sudden he's a really far-bison.
All the cranners there's McCain but a beep that a boop that about. And let's repeal Roe v Wade and let's have no more sex except if he gets a little bit and that's about it.
Same old tired craft man Republican party just a bunch of pandewars. That's all a lot of a bunch of pandewars but they're the worst. Speaking of that.
The second most powerful member of the Texas House has circulated a Georgia lawmakers call for a broad assault on teaching of evolution.
Oh my god. See what I mean. Yeah. The anti-science anti-intelligence, Neanderthal, Austroch, Sticky Red and the Sand Party.
House appropriations committee chairman Warren Chisholm Republican of Pampa. That's not Tampa. It's Pampa as in Texas.
Used House operations Tuesday today to deliver a memo from Georgia State Representative Ben Bridges.
The memo assails what it calls the evolution monopoly in the schools.
Mr. Bridges memo claims the teaching of evolution amounts to indoctrinating students in an ancient Jewish sect beliefs.
Ancient Jewish secret. Memor the ancient Chinese secret? No. In a speed of evidence long hidden but now available to everyone demonstrates conclusively that the so-called secular evolution science is the big bang 15 billion year often it creates an scenario of the Pharisee religion rights Mr. Bridges.
A Republican from Cleveland, Georgia. He is arguing against teaching of evolution in Georgia schools for several years. Sounds like a really enlightened human being.
Not. He then refers to a website. Fixed earth.com. Fixed earth.com. That contains a model built for state legislatures.
I choose to pass to attack instruction that evolution is an unconstitutional establishment of religion. I didn't know that evolution had to do with religion. Oh it does? They say it does.
Mr. Bridges also supplies the link to a document that describes scientists Carl Sagan and Albert Einstein as Kabbalists.
See there's that word again that you always tell me. And lament Hollywood was probably because I had a good teacher. And lament Hollywood's unrelenting role in flooding the movie theaters with explicit or implicit endorsement of evolutionism.
Mr. Chism says you know is Mr. Bridges from their joint service on the committee of the national conference of state legislatures.
That is the courtesy to a member of the Georgia legislature that's all of this at Mr. Chism, a social conservative who opposes abortion rights and wants the state to prefer heterosexuals over gays and lesbians and recruiting foster parents.
He authored the 2005 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Oh how unusual. What a surprise.
Mr. Chism was asked if Mr. Bridges now reflects his own views. No, absolutely though I'm a Christian I believe in creation he said.
Creation science is the idea that the earth was created in some six days six thousand years ago.
That's right. Creation science. Right.
You want to teach creation as well as the fact of evolution Mr. Chism said that we said all of those kinds of sciences have holes in them but I'm not about teaching religion in school.
He said they have holes in them just like your correct Mr. Chism.
You're talking about red states and blue states. Why don't they come right out and talk about redneck America baby a bunch of the indythal redneck Bible thumping lunatics.
That's what America is all about. It's about 50 50 manners. There's about 50% of people who live like in civilized places who understand a little bit about what life is all about.
We have enough enlightenment to be like human beings and then there's about 50% of our like-trailer trash Bible thumping lunatics.
Sheep humping Bible thumping tub thumping whatever they are. I'm just thinking about lunch.
Gonna have a tub of soup. Yeah, it would be nice jump into a nice hot bathtub with soup and get all the schmutz from your all in the soup before you eat it.
I still say taking a bath man is just it's not good. No, you're sitting in your own juice. You're in your own schmutz and your own what juices.
Ooh, 138 votes on the pool or sitting in the bathtub with the juice. I know that Matt Damon want to get in the tub with you.
I remember that. Who wouldn't want to get in the tub with Matt Damon when you come right down to it? Hey Matt. You're married.
You're married. I'm a good pardon. We wouldn't most of the people you're talking to that you're listening right now. Yeah, that's why I said it.
Oh, that's exactly why I said it. Don't you understand me by now after 100 years? Don't you understand? It's got nothing.
Oh, someone was there to help me. Help me. Somebody help me.
Geico got my claim and works right away and I was actually able to enjoy my Thanksgiving.
Las Vegas greatest.
Geico real service real savings. Now we need the very very beginning where he says no.
Now you know I said it in step on that. I know that was I mean I don't like it. I even left where he said Geico.
I don't mind giving them plugs. They got the best spots going. Yeah, they do. I don't know if they can think about their insurance, whether it's good, bad or indifferent.
I don't care because I don't have them anyway. Now I wouldn't yell at you. I don't know what you stepping on it like that.
You have become such such an ass liquor last year. I don't know what your story is. And it become what is that all about?
What do you think that's going to get you? I mean the chances of you being in my will on a scale of my sensitivity. What will?
Yeah, exactly right. Now I think won't is the word not will won't won't happen.
George on the other hand is still he's still thinking because you guys planted this in his mind. You know like the old man's going to leave me a couple hundred grand.
Some like that. I just want you to work for another five years at least. No problem. You'd be the board off. Well go to Joe Bell until they're sent. I'll be 70 by the time.
I'm going to tell you right now I'm working till I croak. I've decided that in fact you know my trip to Berlin, which I told clearance wasn't all that great.
And I came back early and saw because I went alone and the weather was you know going over to Europe in the middle of the winter time, especially alone.
It's not a great idea. It's just yeah, I just wasn't in the mood. I was crass and a lude but not necessarily in the mood and nude but nevertheless.
It's just taught me a valuable lesson about this whole retiring business traveling the world sounds wonderful you know.
But it gets old. It gets very old and as you get older you don't have the enthusiasm or the energy to like fight all the people in the airports and go through all the delays and all the
aggravation and the stress there's a lot of stress involved in that. You know what I mean? What do you mean?
So what I'm saying is that convinced myself that this early retirement business is crazy. And of course having said that if Joe Bell was a real mention if he really
or you know was concerned about the future of this radio station, he would have been on the phone with Norma that afternoon saying, oh I heard Neil say he wants to work until he croaks, which I've said before.
But I don't see them extending any you know our branch in my direction. In fact I'm thinking that a week from Thursday on the first to March my 31st anniversary on the
Irrntown that's the day they should announce like a till death extension a TDE till death extension to my contract.
All right. I'm saying. And of course that way you know the big bucks are still coming in. I can go to wood mine all the time, lose my ass, have no problem.
Take care of all my people, which I take care of half the universe and I enjoy doing it. No problem. What's the thing that's a good idea?
I would go in right after the show right before. Oh and also your buddy Brandon was telling me about whatever that cake is that you got the king.
The marty grachink. The marty grachink. He said it's like a giant cinnamon roll or something. He said. Yeah.
With a lot of frosting on it. And he said. Where did he say? I don't know where his messages. He said something about there's like a little king in the inside of it.
So if you're more your bite down what it's a little baby. I think it's supposed to be good luck or something if you find the baby.
And have you found it? Don't bite down on the baby. Well he's really wound up today. I'll say I think you did it with that.
What were you asking for before or that clip judge Judy? Oh, yeah. Just ranger. I love it.
20 till till we go really sports intensive at two o'clock in the references. Thank God for that.
This is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers.
That's a movie.
Huh?
His name is Ralph. He's a spoiler. He caught the goalie election. Now he is back. George pushes back. And Carrie is mad.
He likes to get around by the throat. He is afraid he might rock the moat. But all of my friends with rings in their nose.
Stainy really like his room full close. He is rough later boy. He is no corporate joy. And that is good enough for me.
He's not a pretty face too bad he can't win the race. And that could do it for the GOP.
He is a better boy. He don't have to annoy both of the two major parties. All of us like our friends.
Well, before him again. Cause he stays bad at any speed. He is rough later boy. He is no corporate joy.
He is an A-hole and the reason I play that is because former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader says he is considering a presidential run in 2008.
Oh my God.
And strongly suggests over the weekend that he would end the race of Senator Hillary Clinton Wednesday Democratic Party nomination.
The San Francisco Chronicle will be saying. She does another bad version of Bill Clinton.
Nader told KGO radio host Ron Owens and San Francisco. Ron Owens by the way is great. KGO is a great talk station.
I just mentioned that in passing. Okay.
Asked to describe Clinton the firm under for the Democratic presidential nomination. He ran in advance of the primaries. Nader said.
Flatters, panders, coasting, fraud runner, looking for a coronation, not taking on the huge waste in the military budget as a member of the Armed Services Commission.
Never going after the corporate crimes against pensions against workers. She has no political fortitude.
Asked specifically if he would run in 2008. Nader said it is too early to say. But I am considering it.
We are going to see what the Democrats come up with. And if it is her. Oh, well if it is her, oh, you period.
Barack Obama is the man and these people calling asking. Well, once you are at take, what do you know. I have already told you 8 million times.
Open up your ears. Get the white seat built up out of there.
Guess who writes this column in the International Hero Tribune will the US attack Iran. I will give you one guess.
Are you about. World police team America world police. Oh, Hans Wicks. Yeah. You know how. Oh, I can say that. Bricks.
He says well, the United States use armed force against Iran. Hardly any foreign policy issue is how to write now. American planes are reported to be patrolling along the border between Iraq and Iran.
And US forces have been authorized to kill Iranian agents in Iraq. Two US aircraft carriers are in the Gulf and missile defenses have been installed in Gulf states.
The military build up is either the scary to Iran or to prepare for American attacks on Iran.
Many remember that there was US military build up in the Gulf during the autumn of 2002 and the first months of 2003.
And the US attack on Iraq followed in March is something similar underway now.
Most commentators note that a large part of the American people would disapprove of more military adventures.
Yet many worry that the Bush administration might be tempted to play up Iran's activities as an important reason for the energy in Iraq and reduce the attention of the debacle and arrive by opening a new front through bombings in Iran.
Many government share the conviction of the Bush administration that the aim of Iran's program for the enrichment of Iran means to give Iran at least the ability to make a nuclear weapon in a few years.
They support the demand of the UN Security Council that Iran stops the program and believe that economic sanctions that prohibit the delivery of material and equipment for the program may influence Iran.
However, practically all are of the view that a military attack would be disastrous. Although it might delay the program of enrichment of a few years, it would at the same time probably lead the full national acceptance of the program, increased the Iranian support for terrorism and perhaps a crisis in the supply delivery of oil.
Iran's response to the action of the Security Council has so far been to reduce U.S. inspectors' access to Iranian nuclear installations and at the same time declared readiness for talks provided that the council dropped the demand that the program for enrichment must be suspended before talks are opened.
Iran is thus on a collision course with the resolution adopted by the council while Washington declares that diplomacy rather than military actions on the agenda, the administration evidently believes that enabled administrations may have an impact.
A recent column in the Washington Times suggested that even more explicit demonstration, the launching of a missile on the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, now used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.
In Europe and elsewhere, people are worried that mistakes might lead to an armed conflict or to an Iranian withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty or refuse of inspection by the international atomic energy agency. So what can be done?
In the case of North Korea, the United States seems to be able to sit down for talks without demanding that the production of plutonium be stopped prior to the talks and even indicate that an agreement could constitute the opening of diplomatic relations and guarantees against the tax and returned for denuclearization.
It is difficult to understand why in the case of Iran, this suspension of the program for enrichment uranium has been made a precondition for any talks in which suspension is the main subject.
It isn't long ago that an American commissioner by former Secretary of State James Baker and former representative Lee Hamilton declared that the U.S. auto-engaging talks with Iran and Syria.
Yet despite the dire situation in Iraq, the Bush administration who first talked to Iran and Syria through public statements and military threats is a little like the boss who said they'd like to have exchanges of views with his subordinates, they should come to present their views and walk out with his views.
Unless humility, humility and approach might give better results. Such an approach is now being tested in the case of North Korea. Line up in Iran too, asks Hans Bwix.
I have so many lines and I just can't use any of them. That's bad.
I'm going to say you don't want to get, huh? I got a good Kim Jong Il impersonation, but I can't use any of his lines. Don't be doing that. How about our ballroom?
Anybody that hasn't seen the movie Team America World Police, you're a square as a cardboard box. I mean, even I've watched it about three times already.
It's funny every time. Yeah. It's a hoot. It's great.
It 1157 on a pool. Chris would have really leaned on it today heavily, but of course I think all that food that you keep, you're going to gain all that weight back working there. That's what I'm afraid of.
So I'm doing my best not to go overboard like a lot of this stuff.
Don't go crazy there. In fact, there was a good idea. You had the George Curtis in there earlier. I noticed sucking up some of the free food. That's good. That's good.
Get him in there and give him all the slop over. You know what I mean? Pass along all the slop over to a Curtis.
And then of course he can heat it up on a nice flavor wave. I use that thing almost every day. That's good.
I don't know. Anybody that I talked into getting one that isn't like enchanted with it. I mean, what's not to like?
Except the fact that eventually it's, you know, that thing is going to burn out and they'll have to either replace it or get a new one. I can handle it 100 bucks.
Do you know how long it takes to lose 100 bucks Canadian it would bind to a bad machine mine maybe two, three minutes, maybe five minutes. Yeah, I guess maybe five. Maybe if you take it slow.
If you don't bang it too fast in the button either when you're playing those nickels.
I got news for you can play the nickels and you can play like up to 40 or 50 nickels per what is 50 nickels?
I think they're two and a half. Five nickels is what it is. So that's like two, let's like over two bucks a play for Christ's sakes.
Don't get suckered in man. A fool in his money are soon parted. Don't get suckered in. If there's anything I can't stand it's people who like gambling.
Oh, you know what tomorrow is by the way speaking of not be able to stand people a gamble. You know what tomorrow is? Hope that no tomorrow's would bind Wednesday. I know. Yeah, you know.
Maybe I'll find me a good machine. I don't think there is anything anymore. I think they had somebody come in the middle night and haul all the good machines out.
They said that old Jew Fag is over here winning money every once in a while. We better put an end to that. And you know what? They did a good job of it too.
And five six oh WQ and they have all the boy they need to keep the gas low. Nothing more than to a complete greed. No one to control it.
That's a ridiculous call. Except with the Internet sets. Now these guys are screwing you all.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I thought they made me right so they got it. It's higher each time. Wait, wait, wait. I thought they made me. They're making profits. I don't know.
I don't know.
Welcome.
That's something that's right.
Welcome to the band.
The band.
Let's abuse some more prisoners. Make them scream nice and loud.
I'll be going to wait.
Bye bye bye.
I'll be going to wait.
