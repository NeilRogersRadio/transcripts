No question this pack on with a record is the topic of best bet and condition of W and R and A.
I bet Hayfield, you've got this started for price so she's wishing I am to have best talent.
Oh, that'll all be fine.
I am a patient by hand.
I'm not so rich.
I'm fine.
WQ AM.
I'm not saying OJ.
Oh.
For a lot of day.
Change!
Stent your palminor covers over this performance by the Dalton.
OJ OJ OJ OJ
You can't be cool.

You can't be cool.
You can't be cool.
Oh.

You can't be cool.
I am a patient by hand.
I am a patient by hand.
I'm not saying true.
I'm cool.
I am a patient by hand.
Stent my mind.
When she turned off all the lights.
There's no place where she could hide.
I know OJ was gonna get hurt.
OJ went out to kill her.
OJ went out to kill her.
OJ went out to kill her.
OJ went out to kill her.
Oh right.
OJ went out to kill her.
That's right.
One day.
The jury's gonna set free OJ.
Roe, we know we're gonna head your way.
Oh yeah.
It's gonna get you.
It's true.
OJ is gonna come after you.
And then he'll get away with that one too.
OJ is gonna get you.
OJ is gonna get you.
OJ is gonna get you.
It's gonna get you.
Oh, you're right.
OJ is gonna get you.
One night.
OJ, OJ, OJ, OJ.
You killed the goal.
You killed the goal.
OJ, OJ, OJ.
You killed the goal.
You killed the goal.
You killed the goal.
That doesn't even translate.
You killed the goal.
You killed the goal.
Oh!
OJ is gonna get you.
We'll chase gonna get you, we'll chase gonna get you.
We'll chase gonna get you tonight.
Yes he is, if you don't kid you, it gets a whole bunch of others.
Well I'm telling you, I don't know which is the best thing that happened on the weekend.
The fact that the dolphins got crushed by Dallas in a desperately bad performance.
The fact that the Patriots just kicked the crap out of San Diego last night.
Or the fact that OJ is back in jail.
Alright, what a fine weekend.
George doesn't care about any of them.
Why do you care about OJ?
Yeah, I mean whatever.
Well that's another football thing.
Not really, it's a murderer thing.
No, it's a football thing.
Give me the volume of all.
There was his football member Abilia that he wanted back.
OJ Simpson was arrested yesterday and faces multiple felony charges
and alleged armed robbery of collectors involving the former football star grates.
Sports member Abilia authorities be saying.
Simpson was arrested shortly after 11 o'clock yesterday morning Captain James Dylan said,
I wonder if he's getting to Marshall Dylan, think?
Doubt it.
Or maybe Matt Dylan.
The charges against Simpson will include robbery with a deadly weapon.
Conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a firearm all felony is Dylan said.
I wonder if he's getting to Cory Dylan, he's retired.
Several police officers were seen entering the hotel where Simpson is staying.
A security guard said police took Simpson out a side door shortly after the arrest.
We've only seen that about four million times being handcuffed, taken off in handcuffs
with that Schmidt Eaton look on his face.
God is he a piece of scum.
Oh baby.
At least one of the persons been arrested.
Police say yesterday there's many of six people could be arrested.
A connection with the alleged armed robbery that occurred inside a room inside the palestation casino hotel last Thursday.
Simpson 60 said he and the people with him were retrieving items that belonged to him.
Right.
Simpson said there were no guns involved that he went to the room at the casino only to get stolen momentos
that include this Hall of Fame certificate in a picture of him with a Jay Egger, a gay Egger Hoover.
Oh, Matt's made an heaven.
Simpson told the AP Saturday he didn't call the police to help reclaim the items because he has found the police unresponsive to him ever since he had to do those murders.
The police since my trouble have not worked out for me.
He said, noting that whenever he called the police it just becomes a story about O.J.
I wonder what the water notes he thinks about O.J. being back in jail.
I wonder what Square and things about O.J.
I wonder what Greg Reed thinks about it and all those other losers.
I bet they figure he got a bug rap.
That's for sure.
He's real roto.
He just can't get a square deal.
Although it looks to me like he's been getting at least one or two square meals because he's looked a little on a punchy side.
Good.
Maybe he'll have a stroke.
The Highsman Trophy winner, XNFL star and actor lives in candles, been a tabloid staple since his ex-wife and Goldman were killed in 94.
Police said two firearms and other evidence were seized into the private residence early yesterday.
Even though we see there were no firearms involved, but they seized him anyhow.
Walter Alexander, 46th of Arizona, was arrested Saturday night in two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a dead weapon.
We saw the two firearms police said they seized other evidence during early morning searches of two residents.
It was evidence that a crime that was committed, Nichols said, and I believe we recovered something, some clothing, that the individual was wearing in the commission of a robbery.
Simpson said the auction house, Tom owner, Tom Ricchio called in several weeks ago to say some collectors were selling some of his items.
Ricchio set up a meeting with collectors under the guise that they had a private collector interested in buying Simpson's items.
Simpson said he was accompanied by several men he met at a wedding cocktail party and then they took the collectibles.
They went in and they grabbed him. At gunpoint, even though he lied about that, of course.
Alfred Beardsley, one of the sports memorabilia collectors involved in the alleged robbers and he wants the case dropped and that he's on OJ side.
He's on OJ side. You know something? That's not the good side to be on, believe me. I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so.
You know anybody else who's on OJ side, beside the against, I mentioned only moments ago, the OJ liquor is out there.
Oh, we love OJ, we love you OJ, we're big fans, OJ. Give me the ball.
You know crap like that. I'm delirious and I think what I read over the weekend is he can get up to 30 years.
Excellent.
But third man.
So if I couldn't put him away from murdering two people, maybe gone and armed robbery for some sports memorabilia might do it.
Talk about stupid. Talk about a slime ball. Scum. Scum on two legs. That's OJ.
And anybody out there that still make an excuse for him or trying to turn into a racial thing, screw you. That's my comment. Screw you.
Here's the poll. Oh, it was a survey. That's right from over the weekend. Our ethnic survey.
Well, look at that. 1643 people checked in. That's the entire audience. I'm convinced of that.
We are playing with an empty deck, but you know Friday morning at 10 we got another trend coming out. Whoopie.
I know you're excited about it. Yeah, well, I'm curious about it.
I am curious yellow.
What? Here's the ethnic survey. Which are you Anglo male non-Hispanic 1127 68.5%.
1127 Hispanic male 230. I'll just under 14%.
Whatever. Anglo female 109 black male 65 Native American female 27 Native American male 27.
How do you think that's just a coincidence or what? Maybe 27 apiece for the engines.
Asian female 17 black female 14 Hispanic female 14 Asian male.
Solomon T. Trace only 13 or 1643 people who took the time who cared enough to send a very best.
Which most people don't. Although like I said, that could be the entire audience.
Wouldn't surprise me at all the way this outfit is operating things these days.
I'm so glad I didn't get to hear Jimmy Cifilis yesterday on the game. Did you hear the broad cast of all Chris?
I heard the first half and part of the second quarter, third quarter.
Really? Would they like to poke it in their beer or what?
Actually, once the end of the third quarter started, it was pretty much that they were just saying there's nothing good you can say about the steam right now.
That's correct. And as far as cam cam is concerned, what I'd say it sounds like a comic book character.
Who is cam cam cam?
Once again, the organization tried to pedal a chicken liver to Nazis. You know, it just didn't make any sense to me.
516 votes out today's pool. This is Brandon's pool by the way.
And he's giving me a son to dance about all its his favorite pool. Well, guess what? It ain't nobody else's because we only got 516 votes and I put it on like late yesterday afternoon.
Well, on a Sunday, they're watching football.
The line then last night, they're watching the Patriots just destroy the chargers, destroy demolish.
I just mentioned that in passing because there's a lot of jealous fools and Southful.
Oh, yeah, well the Patriots cheat and y'all, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah, right. Whatever you say.
What's the most embarrassing factor of old age that's Brandon's pool?
You lose control of your bowels 127.
Now, these, these first two, which are almost exactly tied, as they're really distinctions, you have to wear diapers or a bag 125.
I mean, I see some concoction. I mean, connection.
Excuse me.
Yeah. Well, it's kind of the same thing.
Kind of, but not exactly.
Have to wear diapers or a bag 125. Oh, boy.
Tons of ear and nose here are 68. That is correct. Well, I spend more time shaving my ear here.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. It grows in clumps and chunks.
Losing your memory 56.
You go see now 34, which I think also goes to hand in hand with the other one.
You lose your hair.
But third, man.
That should be our biggest problem.
Getting poked and prodded 18, your hair goes gray or white 18.
Why is that so bad? You know, it makes you look extinguished.
Right, whatever.
You lose your teeth 18. I got all my teeth.
You can't get it up 12.
And your body sags or wrinkles 12 out of 527 votes.
How about that, OJ?
Oh, brother. That makes me so happy because anything bad that happens to him
gives me nearly sexual excitement.
At my old age, that can't be all bad.
By the way, did the branch, branch, much to anything about that?
Do we know if we have a new tag this week or anything going on with that sales department?
Well, what we have going on there under the guise of sales is nothing short of the day.
We have a new tag for brandy's in the box.
His branch on the case is he involved in any way shape or form with my close personal friend's brandy's.
I mean, I've noticed that slowly but surely,
all the fine clients I've had over the years are vanishing like that vanishing cream you just smeared on and just everything disappears.
Oh, yeah.
You can check my chair, my dirty underwear, my clean mask, my great beer, and my clothes.
You can strip my walls, and you can take my balls and the hacker chip I used to blow my nose.
And you can take my knives, my career knives, my toothbrush, and my can of apple cheese.
You can take my pants, and that lamp I bought in France, so that they can picture of AC and Joe Green.
But don't take my art, my any warhol art, keep your bad hands off my husband, show me, too.
Because they picture my art, my any warhol art, I'm a pizza menu, my gawo, me to do.
You know what I mean, baby? Don't take my art, my any warhol art, because that stuff I like and I can't let it pass.
Because if you touch my art, my any warhol art, I'm gonna keep my Bruno's while I'm flying away.
Not though somebody asked me to do a Molly shoot then he would never win.
I think we're ready for another OJ trial, don't you? Sure what not.
Remember when we started the Iraq attack, and what did I say? I said it's all about OIL and M011, that was the day that that punt called in.
Oh thank you Mr. President for those low gas prices.
How'd that work out?
You see, I learned Greenspan on 60 minutes last night.
He did look at day over 600.
He looked like an enthusiast's grandpa on a bad day.
The man once regarded as the world's most powerful,
bankerized bluntly declared that the Iraq war was largely about OIL.
How do you like that?
I mean, what the hell would I know?
I don't want to say I told you so, but you know what?
You told us so?
Yes.
Appointed by Ronnie Raygun in 1987 and retired last year
after serving four presidents,
Alan Greenspan has been the leading Republican economist for a generation
and has uttered instantly moved world markets,
just like some of us move our bowels.
In his long awaited memoir out in the US today,
Greenspan 81 have served as chairman of the US Federal Reserve
for almost two decades, right?
I'm saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everybody knows.
The Iraq war is largely about OIL, OIL.
In the age of turbulence adventures in the New World,
he's also crystal queer in his opinion to last two bosses,
harshly criticizing George W. Bush for abandoning fiscal constraint,
and praising Bill Clinton's anti-deficit policies during the 90s
as an act of political courage.
He also speaks of Clinton's sharp and curious mind,
an old-fashioned caution about the dangers of debt.
Greenspan's damning comments about the war
come as a survey of Iraqis which was released last week,
claims that up to 1.2 million people may have died
because of the war in Iraq, lending their way to a 2006 survey
in the Lancet that reported similarly high levels.
1.2 million people, nice going, W. The Butcher of Washington, baby.
More than 1 million deaths were already being suggested by anti-war campaigners,
but such high counts have consistently been rejected by US and UK officials
because it's embarrassing.
The estimates extrapolated from the sample of 1411 adults around Iraq
were collected by British polling agency ORB,
which asked Iranians the selection of Iraqis how many people living in their household have died
as a result of the violence rather than from natural causes.
Previous estimates gave a range between 390,940,000,
the most prominent of which collected by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
and reported in the Lancet October 2006 to suggested 655 deaths.
Although the household survey was carried out by a polling organization
rather than researchers, it's again raised as expected that the 2000s
being based is caused a far more substantial death toll
unofficially acknowledged because it's too embarrassing.
The ORB survey follows an early report by the organization
which suggested that 1 in 4 Iraqi adults had lost a family murder of violence,
the latest survey suggests that in Baghdad, that number is as high as 1 out of 2.
If true, these latest figures would suggest that death toll in Iraq
now exceeds that of the Iran-Den genocide in which about 800,000 died.
Samal and Greenspan says it was all about OIL.
I mean, what would I know? Right, but when he says it, people say,
oh my God, maybe he's got a point. Maybe that's what it's all about.
Maybe it's not to make us safe.
Make Americans safe from those dangerous Iraqis.
556 on the pool, Chris, I got some bad news for you.
I mean, it was bad enough that your team got clobbered yesterday
and just incredibly enough performance.
Trent Green, you know, I don't care how good he looks for a guy at his age,
he sure can't play no more, you know.
Maybe those other five concussions he had have gotten to him.
Maybe the fact that his offensive line is weakened that he has no receivers
and no running backs. Maybe the fact that the team sucks might have something to do with it.
And I even the defense looks like they just basically aren't got it no more.
They're getting old and tired.
Kind of like me.
But the bad news is that the pool, you haven't got a Chinaman's chance in hell
to get 1,000 votes today, Chris.
We'll see.
We'll see what.
We might get it.
You have 556 votes on this pool.
They'll chip into it.
At 10.22 in the AM, are you crazy person or what? They'll chip what?
What are they on a golf course? Maybe that's where they're playing my strong and golf with...
They're going now.
I think I'm much to do.
Remember I told you about that stupid Florida January 29th primary?
It about how you hope may not mean anything in the primaries.
Florida Democrats unable to work out a compromise to avoid harsh sanctions imposed
by the Democratic National Committee,
a priority to give in and declare the January 29th presidential primary meaningless.
Nice. Very nice. Very stupid.
While State Party officials insist no consensus is the reason what the party should do,
there's a growing recognition that within the next week Democrats will announce a plan
that renders the primary vote non-binding in order to comply with national party rules.
Florida Democrats will instead decide sometime after January 29th which presidential candidate
is the winner of the state still gets to the national convention.
Once suggested plan is to have Democrats vote by mail.
Although another proposal that may win up cost for Democrats to hold a state convention,
sometime after February 5th.
The positive thing about this is reality may finally be setting in that the party that delegates
will not be selected on the 29th of January.
And if we want to have delegates, we need to have an alternate plan and said,
Alan Katz, a telehazier attorney member of the Democratic National Committee.
John Ausman, longtime party activist from telehazier,
a state member of the DNC said Friday that State Party and Chairman Kieran Thurman
planned to back up plan to spend at least $2.3 million to distribute collect and tell
he votes by mail.
Well, I'm going to send a whole bunch of men all for a Barack Obama.
I'm voting to 4,000 times.
Ausman sent an email to a party stalwart across the state announcing the move
but State Party officials quickly asserted it's not true.
The party has not made a decision and there is no announcement imminent said Thurman
in the email she sent out to members of the Florida Democratic Party State Executive Committee.
Vote by mail is just one of several proposals we were discussing she'd be saying.
Wow.
They screwed it all up.
They're going to make your vote meaningless.
God only knows.
God only knows.
How's Brian Wilson doing, by the way?
Is he still in bed with the teddy bear?
I'm going to do an OJ poll tomorrow because I'm so I'm just, I can't even, I'm beside myself.
I mean, there are some people who just never learn, never change, never learn.
I mean, you can take the, well, what is it? You can take the bag out of the city.
Careful.
You can't take the scum out of the bag. Is that what it goes?
Something like that.
Out of the S bag.
That whole business about words and stuff, you know.
We're going to have to do something about that.
If we have any chance of making any kind of a comeback, of making any kind of impact, what?
What's the use of any chance?
You know, 563 votes on the poll.
What's the most embarrassing factor of old age?
Oh, there you go.
About to get underway any minute now.
We originally heard the first scheduled court appearance would be on Thursday as you may know in this situation.
There he is in the handcuffs.
And I was allowed to have bail, I should say.
And this charges against robbery, assault, burglary and conspiracy.
Again, these pictures coming in from Las Vegas.
And the worst part for OJ is that Johnny Cochrane is still dead.
How do you like that? That's the worst part.
Of course, he can always try out Bobby Shapiro, even though he said he was dead a couple weeks ago.
He's still alive.
And certainly Alan Dushewitch, I didn't run back.
And who is that little midget guy, that little trippy, very, a, Dreck?
Shrek?
Right.
Very, very, very, Dreck.
Now, he looked a little like Todd Dreck.
About two feet tall.
Real piece of turd.
570 votes on the poll.
Most embarrassing factor of old age.
I'm not going to read the results because most of them have to do with like a losing control of yours.
The biggest name is the best out of two of his neurologists.
4205.
62am.
Naked.
Fourth.
Later.
Town of bloody fly.
Oh.
Fly.
Oh.
The bloody fly.
Oh.
You fell.
I went to OJ's estate and something wasn't right.
I took a walk on down the street and I cooked out my flashlights.
And I suspected something funny when I saw Smarter Slug.
Then I jumped over the wall and then I'd done Hato's door.
He told me about some folks he heard so I looked around some more.
And I suspected something funny when I found a bloody fly.
A bloody fly.
Oh.
The bloody fly.
Oh.
Next thing we knew, OJ went on a lost beat.
Rumble right.
Now he's in an LA jail charge for Kabul on the site.
Oh.
And I believe it's first degree.
Murder is guilty of.
It's because.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
The bloody fly.
1031.
But the browser and the Goldman's already said there's strokes now about this stupid ass book,
which is number one on the Amazon.com best seller list, by the way.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
If I do it.
And then they change an image to like, uh, what do they call it?
I don't know.
Slime ball.
Did it.
Slime ball.
I forget what they changed.
You did it.
Here's how.
Yeah, that's right.
He didn't.
Here's the murder by a slime ball who's in jail again in Vegas.
It just pleases me so much.
I can't be getting to tell you.
Maybe there is a God, you know.
Damn.
God.
I don't know.
No, there's not.
Speaking of that, the Roman Catholic diocese of Pittsburgh said today it's created a $1.25 million
dollar fund to settle 32 lawsuits alleging abuse, arranging by priests.
More isolated incidents.
Speaking of murderers.
He settled on that court for more than 18 years.
Michael McKeesey is the new attorney's interim designation as a DOS.
But fair judge.
You did right.
Fair judge.
Oh, boy.
An adjoint statement on attorney for the plaintiff's the diocese said a wanted to settle even though
Pennsylvania courts citing these statute limitations of barbed wire from his from filing
personal injury claims.
Attorney Alan Nates Perrer, who represents the plaintiff, said the gesture is very much appreciated.
Off an institution's birthday sorts of things under the rug as soon as possible, Perrer
said this statement.
It's important and admirable for the diocese to set forward off to these people help and
some form of compensation.
It's admirable.
What a bunch of admirable child molesters.
The diocese will also offer a program of counseling and healing.
Bishop Paul J. Bradley, a DOS citizen administrator, praised both sides for moving from an adversarial
relationship toward conciliation and agreement.
This is important for all involved so that true healing can begin Bradley said.
Three lawsuits against the diocese that Perrer was handling also remained pending against the diocese.
So the Reverend Ronald Linguine, a DOS citizen spokesman, Pittsburgh's got one of the largest
Catholic dioceses in the country with more than 760,000 personers make up nearly 40% of
the population in the sixth county area.
I never knew that.
I knew St. Louis was like heavy duty Catholic.
But Pittsburgh, how do you like that?
I'd know it in.
Well, now you know, see how educational it is?
Got bad news for a chris if we make 900 a day on the pole, but it's a miracle.
Okay, 596.
Well, it's not a good pole, you know.
Plus we don't have anybody listening.
We put those two ingredients together and you got some bad news bears.
Not good.
Got some more interesting news here.
Another piece of information that I've been hitting at for a long time.
Nobody wants to believe me about condom Lisa.
But it's true.
I never doubted you.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice co-owned a home and shared a line of credit with another woman.
According to the Washington Post, diplomat, corresponded to the law.
Oh my god.
Glenn Kessler, who reveals the information and his new book, The Confedant,
Condoleezza Rice and the creation of the Bush Legacy.
Kessler discussed the revelations with talk show host and gay author Michelangelo
Signeur really Friday on his Sirius Radio Show.
According to the book, Rice owns, hey, Neil, you ought to walk over to Sirius.
You know, just wander out over there and see what they say.
According to the book, Rice owns a home together with Randy Bean.
Boy, if this, if the picture, there's a picture that goes with this story on raw story.
And if this is the, she's a white, old, disheveled, nasty looking like a, like a bag lady.
Excellent.
According to the book, Rice owns a home together with Randy Bean.
A documentary filmmaker once worked with Bill Moyers, Kessler made the discovery by looking through real estate records.
Well, I'll be dang, baby.
Condoleezza? Oh, no.
Bean explained the joint ownership and line of credit to Kessler by saying she had medical bills
which selected her financially drained and rice helped her by co-purchasing the house along with a third person,
quite blacker as Stanford professors openly gays.
Oh, that's just a coincidence, I guess.
Sure. When you think?
Absolutely.
Blacker, latest oldest line of credit to Rice and Bean.
Rice and Bean. Sounds like lunch is ready.
I know.
Who wanna eat that?
Woo!
Kessler mentions rumors about Rice's sexuality in the book and notes that many older single heterosexual women have been unfairly targeted with regard to their sexual orientation.
Gay.
He also says Rice has been the focus of nasty attacks and deservedly so, by the way.
When asked about the revelations on senior Relays show Kessler said he did not know if this meant there was something more to the relationship
between the woman and beyond a friendship.
Perhaps the most popular remaining high profile figure in the Bush administration, Rice was promoted to succeed by Bush by many of her backers.
She repeatedly declined offers to run for president in 2008, will return to Stanford and part her departure from the White House.
Rice faced attacks from liberals in the gay community over the state department's reluctance to rebuke Iran for the hanging of gay teenagers.
The gay rights lobby human rights campaign called on Rice in 2005 to condemn Iran's human rights abuses after the hanging of two gay teenagers and to express indignation over other horrific human rights abuses against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people across the globe.
They called under to condemn it and she did not.
The secretary has remained silent on whether gay should be allowed to serve in the military and hasn't commented on the permanent Partners Immigration Act.
Andy Hum, a New York gay journalist who discussed the Iran hangings on his TV show, Gay USA, says Rice's silence gives consent.
Kandi Rice works for an administration that uses a text on gay rights to win votes, Hum told raw story.
She has stood by silently while the president has proposed writing anti-gay discrimination to the Constitution.
Whenever she's given the opportunity to distance herself from their anti-gay policies, she punts.
Silence gives consent, he be saying.
Senior running a strip of the brief coat from a Kressler's book on his blog, after she began Secretary of State, she came to a party at Beckler at Blackers House, kicked off her shoes and began dancing through the Night to Rock and Roll Kissler, right?
Blacker who's gay wanted to show his partner how tight her behind is, he postured him that if he aimed a quarter at her butt it would bounce off like a rocket.
Why?
He was right.
Right, a rice who was dancing didn't realize what he had done and when everyone began laughing hysterically, she was flattered and proud.
She had a proud, but dumb ass.
The blogger who first posted emails about former representative Mark Foley solicitation of male congressional pages also questioned Rice's silence, like Lane Hudson.
Hudson says Secretary Rice has typified the justice position that many Republicans have between their public and private lives.
She has a state department that is a little to move foreign governments around the world in the direction of equal rights for their citizens.
Steve Clemens, who blogs that the Washington Note and who travels in high level foreign policy circles, told Ross that Condoleez and May or May not be gay, but she's in a relationship which legitimately raises these kinds of questions.
Before we took off, as the president and first lady had close relationships with a number of gay men, including Charles Francis, whose brother managed Bush's reluctant campaign for Texas governor.
Any guy named Francis, look out.
What if he's came to Arlene, Francis, you think?
No.
607 out of pull.
You're not eating how he's are you?
Mm-hmm.
We got this Thursday.
Oh, that's where we got to spot right here.
I'll tell you who we got in a second.
Good. Good.
For the pleasure.
So Condoleez is gay.
Well, we knew that.
Cell hating.
The whole cell hating fact seems to be part and parcel like the centerpiece of this whole Bush and not to be in this place.
Is there a lot of money in that or something? I mean, what's the deal with that?
A lot of money and what?
Being a self-hating fact-turn coat, uh, hit it for it.
Asking that punch, she'll tell you.
Oh, look at that.
Here is a pool of a... a bed that just came in.
Magically.
Hard to fit, come to Brandy's with great selection of men's and women, so that sales not going on.
Brian, you're an idiot.
You are a major a-holder.
You're useless as breast on a damn pencil, man. You're pathetic.
Pragic.
That's where a sales guy, okay?
Schmuck.
Schmendrick.
Schmural.
Chi-mi-onto.
How do you like that?
Half hour after the spot runs, I get a tag.
This is the kind of service that you get from our sales department.
You can't complain about the service because there isn't any.
Oh, there was that meal.
Making trouble again.
You know, we just want the spots.
That's all.
We want the money.
That's all the equipment making trouble.
Couldn't it pick him?
Brian, Schmutz, on his second tour of duty of QAM.
Far with you, I'd go over and do a- I would do a joyous right there on his picture on the wall.
Is he still like care?
Yeah.
As much as he cares.
No, we don't care.
We know.
We know what they are.
You can smell it.
Oh, yeah, that's Brian.
Schmutz.
Twenty-be-four-eleven is five-sixty-dovey-dq.
And what's that schedule today?
Let's take a puke at it.
Jim managed to, to four-power-hour-four-to-five with Mad Dog and the Humper.
Hank, all by himself, five-to-six-thirty.
Marlon's on deck at six-thirty.
The Marlon's role is the final score in Colorado yesterday,
85-0-7-13-0-3.
Marlon's on deck at six-thirty.
And the Marlon's had had a land of to play the Braves at seven-o-five.
Any interest at all?
No.
And that big game.
And then overnight with Eddie Kay, game night, whatever he called out after the baseball game.
We call it desperate.
See you.
Y'all.
The Ramsies went on.
They passed a lot of technical tests.
You know what happened?
Nobody believes it.
Mr. Bayon.
You know, so if I'm not going to benefit,
I'm not going to be some dance and want to be for you guys.
O.J., Mr. Bayon's.
I'm just passing to begin with.
What makes you think you've passed the trial?
Simple.
Sign off.
Tell me I do it.
What makes you think you've passed it now?
You murdered Nicole.
And you know you did it.
And you know I mean you're just amazing.
And what if you ever given me a ride?
You've never given me a damn penny.
Now, what's that?
You know it.

No, no not that one.

Come on now.
A little closer to home.
Why?
A little closer to home.
If you have a hobby, I think it's this.
A baby is a fox.
A little closer to home.
Don't tell me you don't know the song.
No, I know.
I've never heard of my life.
It's a...
Roozing.
It's a huge hit.
Where were you?
Please.
Apparently.
Maybe...
Roozing.
Roozing.
Choozing.
So anyway, the point is that he's taking every group that was ever invented, Simon, a garfunkel,
and he's made a poll for each one of them.
We're the list of songs, which I guess is his idea.
Oh, look at all the work I did.
You're not going to be ripping me again, you're not going to be ripping me again, you're not going to be...
Because all the polls are the same.
That's not a poll idea.
All you have to do is tell me, like, take every recording art and take Perry Como, you know, please.
And what's your favorite song by anybody who was ever born?
It's like taking the telephone directory, which I'm going to be reading the rest of the week, by the way.
Don't you agree with me?
You already did.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't like these kinds of things anyway.
No.
But, I mean, like, some of the choices that he made were a little, you know, like Bob Marley.
And Peter Paul and Mary, as much as you and I eat Peter Paul and Mary.
How many people listening in this audience know from Peter Paul and Mary?
Right.
But I mean, I hear this throughout the day.
I mentioned from last Friday, I was mumbling to you before the show, and somebody fasts us in it.
A lot of people are behind the eighth ball here.

Communism local newspapers reported yesterday. How do you like that?
Ambassador my ass. F. We're an ambassador.
The singer who is not Jewish arrived in Israel Wednesday on the eve of the Jewish New Year to attend a conference on
Kabbalah or Jewish mysticism. Kabbalah? Kabbalah? Kabbalah?
What do you say? How are you saying it? I know.
How it is supposed to be said? Right. Let me ask you this.
What differences make how you say it? Is it a lie?
Because it's English and people might want to understand what you're saying.
Other than that, I don't care.
Madonna met Paris in his official Jerusalem resident Saturday evening in the two exchange gifts,
with Madonna receiving a lavishly bound copy of the Jewish Bible, not to be confused with the Goyeshire Bible,
and certainly not the Quran, Oye Vey.
She gave for as a volume of the Book of Splendor, the guiding text of Kabbalah,
and described the Shimon Paris the man I admire in love with Madonna, the idiot Aurenoah Daily reported.
Is that idiot or idiot?
A Paris-aid confirmed the meeting but had no details.
You don't know how popular the Book of Splendor is among Hollywood actors,
either you are quoted Madonna is telling Paris,
everyone I meet talks to me only about that.
I'm an ambassador for Judaism, she'd be saying, Oye Vey.
Madonna, who was raised in Roman Catholic, has taken the Hebrew name Esther.
Oye Vey, it's Esther.
I wonder if she's big at the Hometoxin in form Esther.
This is the next form, we'll test her.
She's taken the Hebrew name Esther and has been seen wearing a red thread on her wrist
in a Jewish tradition to ward off the evil eye.
What is that? Have you ever heard of that before in your life?
It's a Kabbalah thing.
She's been seen wearing a red thread on her wrist in Jewish tradition to ward off the evil eye.
I never heard of such bubble mice, she's okay.
I don't know.
It's a Kabbalah thing.
Well it says here in a Jewish tradition.
That's what the Kabbalah is a Jewish thing.
No, it's not.
It's a Jewish...
Bubble mice, it's Jewish mysticism.
Oh, well in that case.
But her interest in Kabbalah in recent years, Kabbalah, has been criticized by Orthodox Jews who say it's an abomination.
I say Hub Mollandreared.
All of Getski's, man, of all stripes, varieties, smells.
All the celebrities who flew in for the Kabbalah conference,
including movie star Demi Moore and her husband actor, Ashton Kuchikou,
Rosie O'Donnell, and fashion designer Donna Karan.
Oh, I wonder if Donna's being the Karan.
Is that how you say that?
K-A-R-N, I never heard of it.
Karan.
I don't know.
Donna Karan I think.
How do you know about fashion designers?
It sounds kind of like a topic to me.
I thought Donna came here from director husband Guy Ritchie.
I wonder if he's kin to fat Ritchie or Trevor Ritchie, who drives it woodbine and Mohawk.
The Ha-A-R-S daily quoted Kuchikou, who is telling a group of Israeli businessmen entertainers on Saturday,
that Kabbalah had answered fundamental questions in his life and made him a better actor.
Oh, my God, can you believe that or what?
Another crazy person.
Rabbis who specialize in Kabbalah have criticized the interest by non-Jewish celebrities in the subject, by Goyam.
Jewish tradition holds that Kabbalah is so powerful and complicated that only bona fide students begin to approach it,
and then only after age 40, among the elements of Kabbalah, are mystical revelations drawn from holy books by recombination of letters and other signs.
Wow.
Are you familiar with all this crap?
Are you?
Yes.
You are?
Sure, I had a friend that was in the Lord, this mysticism Jewish or otherwise.
And he was all in the Lord.
Amen.
Every culture has their voodoo magic, you know, back, you know, like wild tailed legends and everything like that.
The whole thing with that golem, you've heard the golem story, right? That has to do with that.
Goyam?
Yes.
Rabbis were especially incensed by Madonna song Isaac about the revered 16th century Kabbalah's Rabbi Yitzhakaluria,
which featured under 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor.
During her visit to Madonna, Pants of visits site sacred to Kabbalah, it was not known how long she intends to stay.
Madonna paid her first visit to Israel three years ago on another Kabbalah center trip.
I can't believe that I'm celebrating the new year with you in Israel, Maari of newspaper quoted her as telling Shimo and Perraza on Saturday.
It's a dream come true.
We always knew she was a crazy bitch, and now we really know for sure that an East Rodman thing, kind of like, since did for me.
I mean, who would get close enough to him to even smell him, much less, you know, doing anything else?
681 votes on our aging and bircing poll, and it is embarrassing.
They're not getting all excited about it, Brandon. I'm sorry.
Do you think it's a bad poll question? Can you in an understanding?
I think they're all bad.
No, seriously. Come on. You can be a little more discriminating than that.
No, I think this is a good poll as far as they go.
As far as polls go?
Sure.
So the audience just has bad taste is what you're saying?
Or they're just not getting around to it or whatever. Who knows?
Or maybe they just don't care about it anymore.
Maybe they just don't care. That's it.
Yeah. It's like South Florida. They don't care.
What does it have to do with the ball game yesterday?
What does it have to do with, ah, ah, ah, are we good?
And of course, let me point this out to you.
This Thursday, we got a hurricane game. Unfortunately, it doesn't start at noon or something like that. That would be sweet.
But we got Hurricanes Game Bay Thursday at 3.30 and then you have in Texas A&M at 7.30. Well, Thursday night.
You mean to say we got four hours of a pregame crap?
Absolutely.
Look, a lot of spots in there. I'll guarantee you that.
Correct.
A lot of spots. That's what it's all about.
Oh, and also Chris wants to a complain.
Is it Thursday that you've got this ridiculous assignment that they work like 15 hours?
Correct.
That's because you work on this show and because their clearance is trying to do everything in his power to screw us in and punish you because you're associated with this show.
So he's got Chris down to work this show.
The Mad Dog show at 2.
Hurricanes Game Bay is 15 hours on the board.
Yes, I'm like that.
And you're going to do it?
We'll see.
Looking out the extra bucks you're going to be raking in.
What's that? Like 2.25 an hour times 15.
It's like over 30 bucks.
Bucks.
Bucks.
Christ, I feel like 37.50 something like that.
15 hours on the board.
Sounds to me like something illegal.
Like, you know, you ought to take them to the some board somewhere.
Yeah.
Finally complained.
And that's one of the reasons I have to do this is because they blew out Miguel because whoever they hired to replace Miguel can't run the board like Miguel could do so able and well and can't be sure he could but got for a bit I should ask him.
You know, I like this guy.
No one, him to get fired again already.
He's like one guy.
The new promotion to the guy is a very nice guy.
And if you know, we ask him to be part of the show, he'll, you know, that's it.
That'll be it for him.
Well, no, if he I see, in other words, he'll give can.
There'll be on the Schmidt list.
Anybody associated with this program immediately becomes on a QM Schmidt list or if you like it or a.
You're talking to me already.
Yeah, then they're going to take you out there and hang you from the flagpole off front.
That's okay.
We'll see what happens Friday morning at 10 o'clock when those next trends come up.
We'll see whether George is going to be mostly George in the summer, especially August.
Whether you can hang out with those gigantic numbers, not gigantic per se, but relatively speaking, you know.
Right.
Five may not be gigantic, but compared to one or two, it's monstrous.
The biggest name is Randy McStoward.
He's the biggest name of this.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.
The fourth leader.
Perika loves to watch boobs and butts and boinking.
And I want emergency.
You just want one over here now to 325 Greta Green.
He's that.
Please.
What is he doing?
He's threatening you.
I...
No one's not.
Where's your bad woman?
Where's he just harassing you.
You're going to hear him in minutes.
No, that's not.
Stop!
Do you have a line so we can know what's going on so the police get to you, okay?
Oh, George, no!
That's not the 12th line.
The KC comes there.
I need to hear what's going on right.
You hear that line?
Does he really?
No.
Okay.
If he has even drinking...
It's not whether you win or lose.
It's out from the kids.
1117 at 560.
Oh, Jason Jail, in case you were sleeping over the weekend or in case you were just obsessed with the football.
There's a connection there, a football connection.
Maybe the dolphins ought to suit him up.
What do you think, Chris?
No.
I'm thinking he could sure play on that team.
No.
And accomplish just as much as they're accomplishing which ain't much.
687 on the Chris is very, very weak pool today.
And he apologizes for that.
That was a huge randoms pool.
Oh, you're right.
Now, he's got the one about the burger joints for a Wednesday.
How many times have we done that?
30 minutes.
But that's okay.
That's okay.
Everybody else is doing basically like what QA is doing.
You know what I mean?
You know the two words?
Oh, okay.
I was going to think of a couple of that words.
Well, that too.
One of them would be faking that.
Maureen Dowd says, will Rudy let her Rudy up?
It's on.
Or rather it's back on.
Rudy versus Hillary.
A New York Steel Cage match pinning two eye gouging hair pulling kick him till they're dead bruh.
For months, Hillary's company may arrive as for the Democratic nomination of Tiptoe
around her, letting their wives take shots at the frontrunner.
Barack Obama looks weary when he's on stage with Hillary, but Michelle stepped up.
Some women feel it's a woman's turn, you know?
They feel like it's Hillary's turn.
That I reject because democracy isn't supposed to be about whose turn it is.
That followed Elizabeth Edwards take down a Hillary.
She's just not as vocal as a woman's advocate as I want to see.
John is.
Obama and Edwards probably figured the criticism would sound less lots of you coming from their wives,
but it just made them seem as though they were hiding behind their wives skirts.
And her Rudy, he may wear skirts, but he's not afraid to take down a skirt.
He put up an ad Friday on his campaign website, Slimey Hershey-Hippockwitt,
for running an anti-war campaign after supporting the president on the authorization for war.
Obama has been trying to make this point for quite a while,
but so gingerly that every time he sneaks up on a Hillary surges ahead,
Rudy doesn't do ginger.
Hillary's been trying to do Rudy up corralling around ground zero and playing the fear card,
saying that if there were a terrorist attack before the election,
only she could stop the Republicans from keeping the White House.
But Rudy aims to de-rudi her.
His ad is an instant cult classic with a solemn trumpet that's reminiscent of taps
and a narrator who sounds like the guy who does trailers for in a world-gone wrong disaster flicks.
Kind of like the guy does our IDs, you know?
With the fake John Prasin devoice.
Your team, your crap, you're...
You know something, if they win seven games this year, Chris, it's going to be a major miracle?
Correct.
Now, just when Hillary was basking in a reinvention of herself right some are re-invited,
Rudy sprang out of the Republican primary shadows and shoved her back.
He ignores her attempts to be new Hillary, a senator who loves men in uniform,
who's not afraid to use military power, and who's tough enough to deal with bin Laden.
He re-cancers to his old Hillary, a code pink-pink-o-first lady,
and an opportunist from a White House that had a reputation for having a flower child
this taste for the military, electing Shrew who made a secret socialist health care plan
and left gazing to the military and certainly can't be trusted to fight the jihadists.
In 2002, the white words flashed on a black screen, Hillary Clinton voted to authorize
military action in Iraq because she believed it was the right thing to do.
Then it goes to a clip of Hillary speaking on the Senate floor during the war authorization debate
that Obama had been too refined to highlight.
If left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological
and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons,
she said, in echo of Kandy, that dyke.
He has also given aid and comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including our kind of members,
so it is with conviction that I support this resolution as being in the best interest of our nation,
she said.
Then the narrator intones, but now that she's running for president, Hillary Clinton has changed her position,
even joining with the radical group move on.org, the radical group,
an attacking American general Patreas when she said it would require a willing suspension of disbelief to believe him.
Just when our troops need all our support to finish the job, Hillary Clinton is turning her back on them
and the narrator concludes.
These are harsh images of Hillary looking brittle and dark glasses to go with the harsh words.
Rudy has decided that the best way to win his primaries to show he can beat the woman on the way to winning hers.
He can't campaign on family values or the sanctity of marriage, he can't whip up any fears on abortion or gays,
he can't campaign on this plan to get out of Iraq because he doesn't have one.
He can't campaign as the tough guy air to bush because nobody likes bush,
he can't campaign on attacking Iran because it'll sound like crazy dick-chaining.
He can't campaign on the economy because he's W. Redux facing a possible recession because of the mortgage crisis,
he can't campaign on Rudy from the mountaintop 12 commitments because no one knows what they are
and they don't mention the word Iraq.
But it can be the only man in the field toughen up to slap around a woman.
The irony is that if you could loosen up Hillary with a few jacking gingers,
she'd probably be closer to her re-invention than his caricature.
She probably secretly supports the surge, knowing that after its footer she may reap the whirlwind.
And then the Republicans who have lied, stalled and mismanaged in every way imaginable
will paint her as Miz cut and run, turning her back on the military again.
That's what Marine Dowd said, whatever that means.
What does it mean?
That he's got nothing.
No, he's got plenty of nothing. That's Rudy Giuliani, baby.
He's got plenty of nothing, but he sure walked around a lot in Times Square.
Closed down all the four-no joints and then of course he wandered around a lot during a...
Oh, in fact last night, well, what channel was it on? It was an MSNBC.
They showed it about 100 times as they were wanting to do on the weekend when they had no programming.
They showed their 9-11 special, you know?
Yeah.
And if there was anybody who doubted still at Katie Kirk as a total bubblehead,
all you had to do was watch, because they were showing, naturally being on MSNBC,
they were showing the NBC news coverage of that day with Tom Bokin and Katie Kirk.
Because it started like in the middle of the Today Show.
There was Matt and Katie, you know?
And she was saying, oh, well, people are curious about what this is all about.
And then they're going on about, well, we're hearing that.
It may have been a small commuter plane, a small commuter plane that tore through the whole day
and building it left a hold of size of Mount Everest in it? Right.
She just... I mean, I granted she wasn't making that up, but nevertheless, she's totally inept.
15 million years CBS' Pan for the suck wind. It's just... it's incredible.
Even Kathy Willett's not a good one. Never got paid like that.
699, Chris. Oh, Chris is on the... he's on the verge of greatness, boy.
When he gets to 700 with this crappy pull, he's going to say, wow, see, I'm doing it.
I do it. Maybe you can write... co-write that book with OJ. I do it.
Okay. In fact, I'd wait until after Thursday, after you do 15 hours on the board.
Have you had a conversation with your program director about that?
Like, what the hell are you doing to me and why are you doing this?
And nobody can be made to work 15 consecutive hours running the board or doing any other damn thing?
That'll be after the show.
Are you going to have a conversation with him? I'm going to try to.
Yeah. And what are we... we're going to hear about this tomorrow on the air, of course.
On the air. Okay.
I want you to record it. I want you to go in there.
Guns blazing, baby. Screaming and yelling and wailing and bitching and moaning and carrying on like a lunatic.
That's what I want you to do.
Saying, you stoop a little geek gay.
You little faggot you clearance. You simple then.
Why can't he put his boyfriend, Robert Greeper on here?
I think Robert's going to be working with me on the actual hurricanes.
Oh, that's right. His name is on there. Yeah, 2 to 12.
Well, he's only on 10 hours.
And then he's going to get up and work in a morning shift?
Well, what is this?
This schedule looks like it was made out by a crazy person clearance.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Crazy person. Somebody, I maniac who needs to be taken in Baker Rack and put him in a straight jacket
and call in Baker Rack his ass.
You know how that works, the Baker Rack?
Yeah, they do.
They come in and they put your ass away, clearance. That's what you need.
In fact, I call up right now. Maybe we can get a package deal for Joe and Joyce and Clarence.
702, Chris is pulled by the way.
And he is mighty proud. He is pleased as punch as Hubert Humphrey would say.
Remember Hubert Humphrey, you died on the front of Time Magazine?
No.

4.256 QAM.
Thanks, sports leader.
The sense of power or power covers over this performance by the Dalton.
Cheers.
I sure hope this is the one that's got the lead in it.
We're just 50,000 A-holes away from home.
We'll find out when.
Miami has a Dalton still no worse football team.
I'll stop him if I think that.
There are every gamblers nightmare.
There are every bookie stream.
They dance for any touchdowns, not even one field goal.
And when you say Miami, you're so cock-and-toy let goal goes there.
That's a lot.
Miami Dalton.
Oh.
Miami Dalton.
Miami Dalton's number.
How many teams in the league?
32.
Miami Dalton.
Miami Dalton.
Don't bet on them, you'll always lose.
The Dalton's can't beat anyone, can't even beat the spread.
I wish that Vince Lombardi could come back from the dead.
Nick Saven makes them practice while he wears that stupid hat.
Hill end up like their last-net coach at loser day one set.
And they're up.
Miami Dalton.
Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's number.
How many teams in the league?
32.
Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's.
I miss Don Shula, how about you?
Some dolphins are in trouble with lots of legal stripes.
They're tight and like so word, got by feeding up his wife.
Half the team are criminal.
The other half sun drugs.
And this is what will happen when you draft up bunch of bugs and they're the Miami Dalton.
Miami Dalton.
Miami Dalton's number.
How many teams in the league?
32.
Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's.
They really are a monthly crew.
But dolphins have no blocking.
They've got no passing game.
I've got just one suggestion.
They ought to change their name.
Do the Miami tampons.
And why do such a thing?
They're good for just one period and have no second string.
And they're the Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's number.
How many teams in the league?
Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's.
Again the fans begin to boo.
They want to boo.
You suck.
But dolphins have no balls except the ones they're playing with.
I just can't wait to see how Ricky Williams takes on it.
It doesn't matter if he never has another token.
It seems that this team's playoff dreams have all gone up.
They're smoking their luck.
Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's.
Miami Dalton's number.
How many teams in the league?

Software Maker leveraged its dominant position in the market for PC operating systems
into workgroup, server operating systems, and media players.
European regulators contended that as a result, Microsoft not only thwarted competitors such
as real networks, but hindered innovation in ultimately consumers.
As a result of the 2004 ruling, the Redmond Washington-based Microsoft was ordered to
share information about its operating system with competitors and offer a version of Windows
without Windows Media Player.
The court did rule that Microsoft's favor, one instance, rejecting the EU's decision
will point a third party to monitor Microsoft's compliance which was to be paid by the company.
Microsoft officials offered little reactions to the court's decision saying they wanted
more time to study the court's 248-page ruling.
We will study the decision carefully and if there are additional steps that we need, we'll
take them in order to comply with it.
We will take them, said Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel for Microsoft.
That's one of our strongest convictions as we go forward.
European regulators cheered the decision.
The court ruling shows that the commission was right to take its decision.
The EU's commission and the competition commissioner at Neely Crow said this statement.
The commission will do its utmost to ensure that Microsoft comply swiftly.
Microsoft will have two months to appeal the court's decision.
OJ, by the way, being taken off in shackles, baby, with that green prison garbana or whatever
that crap was he was wearing, it was a beautiful thing to see and they keep showing it over
and over and over again.
Because it goes to show you sooner or later, crap comes back and smacks you right in
the ass some time.
Right?
Right.
Look what happened to Hitler.
I mean, he was just OJ on a bigger scale, that's all.
726 votes on the pool.
Your hair goes gray or white is still only got 18 votes.
See, I talked them out of that.
I mean, that should be our worst problem when we get old.
Your hair goes gray or white.
Who wouldn't want to be a little gay?
Gray or white.
Now, let me ask you this.
Do you think that somebody is going to find a way to turn this latest OJ business into
a racial thing?
What do you mean, going to find a way?
Oh.
It must be, you know, a crack that they, and of course the audio they keep playing over
and over again.
Get up against the mother f and wall by the way.
Like that.
But there were no guns involved and there was no, you know.
Oh.
I mean, how stupid you have to be to continue doing the same crack.
I'm going to have at least an allegor of this.
He does different crack, you know, seeming satellites signals.
Well when you have no moral compass, as they say.
Moral compass?
Yeah.
What does that mean?
Is an excuse in other words when you're a slime ball?
No, no, it's not an excuse.
It's a reason.
Right.
When you're a slime ball, when you don't know the difference between right and wrong or
don't wear, then you do think like that.
You think like that's all the time.
Sure, and you kill people with a physical difference.
You can get off the matter.
What you do like you did after murdering two people and you're like, right?
Well, obviously he can.
And there's still about two people who come running around.
Oh, oh, Jay, could I have your autograph, oh, Jay?
I'll never forget that.
Well, I'm the whole golf tournament thing in general.
I could never forget.
I'll take that to my grave.
With the one of the calls we had, some Jackass who had something, I don't know if it was
a Jersey or a football, something autographed by OJ.
He was going to the golf tournament to get an autograph.
And I said, why are you going to do that?
And he said, it might be worth something someday.
Right, remember that?
Sure.
It might be worth something someday.
In other words, I don't have any principles.
I don't have any schoolables no matter how much of a low life slime, that's kind of like
the slime balls that were buying the paintings by John Wayne Gacy.
I don't want to mention Mr. Ego by name because he might be sniffing something that peppercorn
sauce, but nevertheless.
I mean, have a little bit of principle.
I mean, what's the point?
Frank Rich says, well, the Democrats will betray us.
I don't have time to do that before the break, but I'll do it after the break.
Frank Rich, he's good, New York Times.
Didn't cost anything for me to read it to either.
Oh, Neil's on the air reading bedtime stories.
He's not taking the great colors anymore like Reverend Jones and what did I ever do to
you guys and Sean Byne and all those.
That's right.
I had a dream last night about James Carville.
Really?
I'm sorry.
And he paced it on a little bit of hair.
I have no idea.
He was in front of some building where I was and I didn't recognize him at first and
then I went back and I said, hey, hi, Jim.
Not that I know him or anything like that, but I just recognized him from being on TV
immediately in times of being a bald-headed geek and being married to that right-wing
bitch, Mary Magdalene.
Strange the kind of thing.
I wonder what that means.
Let's start having those people on here.
The people with the bio-rhythms and with the astrological vision.
We have to be.
Who don't you belong?
Not that we're going to take any calls.
That would really be frustrating.
Okay, we're going to, Ernie Sochens going to be on to do bio-rhythms today when we're not
taking any calls.
Are you bastard?
I'm on my bio-rhythm.
I want my reading.
I want to know about me, me, me.
It's like that whole business about somebody said I was special.
You know, and you ever notice all these people like Ronald from Axe Murder or something.
Well, he told me I was special.
And we said you were the special on that night said dinner menu.
You're the special.
People are so, it's just, it's very sad.
Then again, who might have talked, you know, I'm going to go pick up that car this afternoon.
Now, why do you say it with such, you know, just didn't we all have to start bringing
you drive at some point in our lives?
We all did, yeah.
Yeah, all of us.
Right.
And the first car I had, I got into a wreck.
Didn't you tell me the same thing?
You didn't tell me the same thing?
No.
Who would tell me that?
I don't know.
Not me.
I had a little 1960 Corp here and I was out two little long one day and I just drive and
like, you know, I had not a car in the world and looking at the billboards and the signs
and some point back in front of me, he was making a left turn and I had the Bobbid look and
about a Bing right in the rear end of that guy.
So that's how I'll start it up.
Raccoon.
Actually had a funny line there.
Yeah.
So they give this man a raise.
When it comes to ass man, here's the expert.
This name.
Let's go.
Let's go.
This is the hydrogen extractor of the 560 QAM.
I think it's fourth leader.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
You know, when I was eight.
I used to watch you bust and tackles.
Now you walk around and tackles.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Stay.
Keep on out to the time.
Just remember to stay with your back to the corner.
Or you'll be walking like Tina Turner.
Oh!
I'm not really a part of that.
The implications of him being back in a slammer again.
There might be some people over there who don't cut in the locker.
Double murderers, you know, unless they are themselves.
Well, they might be a total lie.
Practice makes prefect.
Isn't that what they say in the church?
Practice makes prefect, or the prefect wants to practice.
BG and Crayl Springs sends a fact that it's very disturbing to me.
And you ought to be, it says juice up the transmitter, juice written in capital letters.
BG lives in Crayl Springs and it says, with your signal, they feel like I'm in the mountains of Nepal.
I guess the weather, of course, in Mark is creating the static and fading.
What kind of weather you've got going on?
It's sunny and beautiful here.
It was raining earlier, it was one.
You got some weather issues.
Is that possible?
Not in sunny South Florida.
Not on the 17th of September.
It says it's the same radio I always use.
So I know it's not my system.
Since most of the time, you sound like you're sitting in the next room.
Well, guess what, BG?
I am in the next room and I'm going to get your ass,
just sending me this depressing fact.
And that's good to know, you know, because nobody tells us nothing.
Maybe that tube interference is running roughshod with our signal again.
Or maybe we're running about 10 watts because, you know, with this radio G,
we got in there now.
There in this cost-cutting mode.
Got a cut back, you know, we can't buy any paper clips or paper towels
or we can't buy any effects paper stuff like that.
You're spending too much money.
Or give raises.
Or give raises to people who are going to work 50 hours on Thursday
because we got some stupid ass UN football game against Texas A&N,
which I noticed I did a little homework on that.
Really?
And I see Texas A&M even though they play little girl schools.
They score like about 45, 55 points every game, every game, every week.
Doesn't that concern you since the UN was like,
gave up 51 points to Oklahoma?
Didn't they?
Yeah.
Now granted, they beat, you know, the girls teams that they played,
which, you know, what a schedule that is.
Oh, we played and we won a couple of games.
You have a big deal against little girls teams.
And with all apologies to, you know, the people at FIU,
it's from a football standpoint.
It's what is a division one quadruple A something like that.
So they're giving one.
They want to eight classes Z.
Get out of here.
One A, my ass.
FIU, my ass.
What is wrong with you, man?
They're division one A.
Well, I don't care what they are, A.
The little girl schools for our football is considered.
There may be a wonderful institution of higher learning.
I have no idea.
What do you think?
Yeah.
I think the professor graduated from there who keeps them.
By the way, emailing me stuff that isn't coming through.
Don't you love that when people, I mean, I don't want to get into a
snit with my good close friend, but it keeps trying to send me a copy
and pasting their link to a car that he made by tonight on eBay.
Right.
And every time I click on, I paste it.
It says, it's, you know, it's screwed up.
It's not going to write.
They can't access this page.
What are you thinking about?
Are you a crazy person?
I say, yeah, that's me.
But anyway, he went to FIU.
So I'm sure that there's some upstanding, you know, people will learn something that went there.
You think I was supposed to never see Miami.
I mean, the beast went to you and didn't he?
Correct.
That's what said.
Well, what does that tell you?
Huh?
J. Roqueach.
J. Roquea with his Roqueach pickles, man.
He went to you, and he's still doing those stupid games.
I see he missed his first game ever because he had to go do a Poxky around with something.
J. Roqueach, a man who refuses to grow up, kind of like the Mike Rosenthal of the broadcast booth of the APA booth.
There's Alan Greenspan who wrote a day over 900.
What is that?
He's definitely stall who wrote like a day over 800 or so.
I wonder who's older, Vanna Wider, Leslie Stahl.
Good question.
Does anybody care?
Do you think this audience even knows who Leslie Stahl is?
Yeah, there she is.
There she is.
There she is.
What?
There?
Over there on the TV?
Well, not right now.
It's got Alan.
Oh, now it's at 600-year-old Alan Greenspan.
Yeah.
Frank Wider says, will the Democrats betray us?
Sir, I don't know, actually.
The fact that America's surrogate commander and chief David Patrance could not say whether the war in America is making America safer
was already needed to take away from last week's festivities in Washington.
Everything else was a verbal cragmire as administration and spin and senatorial preening fought to a numbing standoff.
Not that many Americans were watching, the country knew going in that the White House would win this campaign to stay its course of indefinitely shoveling our troops in treasure into the bottomless pit of Iraq.
The only troops coming home alive are with their limbs intact and President Bush's troop reduction.
Are those who were scheduled to be withdrawn by April anyway?
Otherwise, the President would have had to extend combat towards yet again, mobilize more reserves or bring back the draft.
On the sixth anniversary of the day that did not change everything General Patrance couldn't say were safer because he knows were not.
Last Sunday, Michael Shire, former chief of the CIA, is also some of his lawmen who'd explained why.
He wrote in the Daily News that Al Qaeda, under the de facto protection of Provert Musharraf, is on balance more threatening the day than it was on 9-11, and as goes Pakistan, so goes Afghanistan.
On Tuesday, just as the Senate hearings began, Lisa Myers of NBC News reported on a Taliban camp near Kabul and in a very abnormally controlled by the Afghan government we installed, its training bomb makers to attack America.
Little of this registered in or beyond the beltway, new bin Laden tapes and the latest 9-11 memorial rights notwithstanding were back in a 9-10 mindset.
Bin Laden said Francis Towns at the top White House Homeland Security official is virtually impotent.
Karyn Hughes, the Bush-Krony and charge of America's PR on the Jihadist world, recently held a press conference in owning Cal Ripken, Jr. are international special sports envoy.
We are once more sleepwalking through history, fiddling while Al Qaeda not in Iraq prepares to burn.
This is why the parallels between Vietnam and Iraq, including those in Iraq with and Mr. Bush's recent false analogies, can take us only so far.
Our situation is greater than it wasn't Vietnam.
Certainly, there are some eerie symmetries between Patreas sales pitch last week, and it's often known as historical anti-Sedan, General William Westmoreland, similar mission for LBJ before Congress, April 28, 1967.
Westmoreland, too, refused to acknowledge that our troops were caught in a civil war.
He spoke as well of the repeated successes of the American trained South Vietnamese military and ticked off its growing number of combat-ready battalions.
The strategy we're following at this time is the proper one that General Assuret America, and it's producing results.
Those fabulous results related our final departure from Vietnam for another eight years just short of the nine to ten years General Patreas said may be needed for counterinsurgency in Iraq.
But there's a crucial difference between the Westmoreland show of 67 and the 2007 revival by General Patreas and Ambassador Ryan Al Thakrocker.
Westmoreland played a way full and largely enthusiastic house.
Most Americans still supported the war in Vietnam and trusted him so did all but a few members of Congress regardless of party.
All three networks preempted the midday programming for Westmoreland's congressional appearance.
Our Iraq commander by contrast appeared before a divided and stalemated Congress just as an ABC News Washington Post-Poll found that most Americans believed he would over-high progress in Iraq.
No network interrupted the soap opera for his testimony on cable to hearings fought for coverage with Britney Spears like this self-immolation and the fate of Madeline McCann are latest Jambanay Ramsey stand in.
General Patreas and Ambassador Krocker could grab an hour prime time TV only by slinking into the safe foxhole of Fox News where Brit Hume shaperoned them on a gloomy bunker like set before an audience of merely one and a half million true believers.
Their briefing for America as Fox titled it was all too fittingly interrupted early on for commercial promising pharmaceutical relief from erectile dysfunction.
Even if military victory were achievable in Iraq America couldn't win a war abandoned by its own citizens the evaporation of that support was ratified by voters last November for that they were rewarded with the surge.
Now their mood is turned darker Americans haven't really abandoned the war they don't want to hear anything that might remind them of it or the war of war in general.
Katie Courts much promoted week long visit to the front produced ratings matching the CBS newscast all time low.
Angelina Jolie's movie about Daniel Pearl sank without a trace even Clint Eastwood's wildly acclaimed movies about WWW2 went begging over its latest season 24 lost to third of its viewers just as bushed between January's prime time address in last weeks.
You can't blame the public for changing the channel people realize the president's real plan for victory is to let his successor clean up the mess.
They don't want to see American troops dying for that cause but what can they do Americans voted the GOP out of power and Congress a clear majority consistently tell polls that they want out of Iraq and still every day is groundhog day.
Our America unlike Vietnam era America is often more resigned than angry though the latest New York Times CBS news poll find that only 5% trust the president to wrap up the war the figure for the barely democratic control party.
Congress 21% is an almost as resounding vote of no confidence.
Last week Democrats often earned that rating especially those running for president.
It's true they don't have the votes to overcome a bush veto of any war legislation but that doesn't mean that Democrats have to go on holiday.
Few used their time to across examine general Patrasian ambassador Crocker on their disingenuous talking points choosing instead to regurgitate stump sentiments or ask uncoordinated redunded questions.
It's telling that one question that drew blood are we safer was asked by Republican John Warner who's retiring from the Senate.
Americans are looking for leadership somewhere anywhere at least while the democratic presidential contenders might have shown the guts to soundly slap the general betray his headline on the end placed by move on.org in the times.
It only deflate a counterproductive distraction.
This left wing brand of juvenile name calling is as what was as the defeat of cuts and the cut and run McCarthyism from the right.
It at once undermined the serious charges against the data in the Patras report including those charges in the same move on ad and love the worst cheerleaders to hyperventilate about a side show.
General betrayers gave Republicans a furlough to avoid ownership of an Iraq policy that now has a supporting both sides of the Shi'i versus Sunni bloodvath while simultaneously shutting America's doors on the millions of American of Iraqi refugees.
The bloodvath is so far created.
It's also past time for the democratic presidential candidates to stop getting bogged down and bickering about who has the faster timeline for withdrawal or the more enforceable deadline.
Every one of these plans is academic anyways long as Bush has a veto pan.
The security of America is more important.
Their one said than trying to outpand one another in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The democratic presidential candidates in the Senate need all the unity and focus they can muster to move this story forward and that starts with the two marquee draws Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
It's essential to turn up the heat full-time Washington for any and every legislative roadblock to administration policy that they and their peers can induce principled or frightened Republicans to endorse.
They should summon the new Chief of Central Command and General Patras boss Admiral William Fallon for tough questioning.
He is reportedly concerned about our last military redness and trouble struck beyond Iraq and why not grow the joint chiefs and those half-dozen or so generals who turned down the White House post of wars our last fall.
The wars should be front and center of Congress every day.
Mr. Bush confident that he got away with repackaging the same bankrupt policies with no-sant- with a nonsensical new slogan return on success Thursday night is counting on the public's continued apathy as he kicks the can down the road and bides his time until January 22, 2009.
He has after all nothing more to lose.
The job for real leaders is to wake up America to the urgent reality.
We can't afford to punt until an auguration day in a war that each day drains America resources and will.
Our national security can't be held hostage indefinitely to a presence narcissistic need to compound his areas rather than admit them.
The enemy votes to cataclysmic events on the ground and Iraq including Thursday's murder the SUNY travel leader Mr. Bush embraced two weeks ago as a symbol of hope have never arrived according to this administration's optimistic timetable nor have major kind of attacks in the West.
It's national suicide to understand the daydream that they'll start doing so now.

You're a homicide, a wacko.
Traces of blood all around.
That match your DNA.
Traces of blood.

You close your eyes and sell crap.
Traces of blood still there.

Oh, Jay, tell me.
How is the search for the real killer, Gullik?
This fire, man.
I've been looking at golf courses all across America.
Been off table beach.
Been on spyglass.
You didn't.
I ain't found them yet, though.
Why are you just working at golf courses?
Uh, that's mostly where I find myself.
I don't go golf courses.
Can you be anywhere else?
No, I don't think so.
They go me on the golf course.
Oh, Jay is just plain crazy.
Here's the hint.
He says it.
My Gullik cold be our enemy.
He said he made my shut Clark's career.
But she's lucky.
He didn't cut her right behind the ear.
Still said he didn't do it.
That's all Jay.
But everybody knew it.
That's all Jay.
The prosecutor's new in and so did this.
He's still out there.
You know, when you think, I mean, we're thinking rationally, you know, like thinking people.
What do you think that if after you get away with murdering two people in cold blood and leaving all that DNA and all the evidence?
Right.
And you still get off and get away with it.
And you're able to hide and floor it and not pay any of the money that, you know, the money is supposed to be transferred into the ground.
The judgment against you.
You know, judgment.
See, that's the word that doesn't fit with him.
Is he in gun any?
Can't complain about OJ's judgment.
He in gun none.
When you think that you'd be like kissing the ground like good, say, oh, I got away with it.
And now I'm going to just play my little sword.
That's right.
Really low.
Right.
And keep my eyes free.
He can't do it.
No.
He can't do it.
Because it's a crazy person.
And a slime ball.
And a thug.
And an idiot.
A moron.
Who is so widely admired by people.
See, he reminds me of what's wrong with this radio station.
And what's wrong with this whole all sports mentality in the first place.
There's something wrong with it.
Like.
Like that.
And I watched a lot of football yesterday.
So it's not like I'm anti sports like George.
I'm not like anti-Somantic, you know.
Watched a lot of football.
Including almost the entire papiates game last night.
Oh, yeah.
38-14, my god.
They just, they took San Diego and they wiped the field with their ass.
Even Chris would have to admit that.
And you watched the game last night or not.
Yeah, most of it.
And am I right?
Yes.
It was a slaughter.
Much like the cowboy who died.
Dolphin game was a slaughter.
Well, that quite was.
At least the dolphins and cowboys were close through the first half.
Yeah.
In other words, it was never 24 or nothing is what you're trying to say.
Exactly.
771 votes on our very mediocre pool.
Branded osis in apology, by the way.
He's a good guy, but he just, you know,
he had the one good pool last week and right away,
oh, I'm a pool expert.
I'm going to show you, you know.
And then he's got the one with the burger chains,
which you think we even ought to do that?
No.
Although, let me take that back.
Yeah, sure, because it beats whatever we're going to have otherwise.
It beats Charlie Vee and what's your favorite son in the Garfunkel song?
Look, we can't be choosy because we're not coming up with anything better either.
Oh, I got the one for tomorrow.
I got my OJ pool.
All right.
It's not like real, you know.
Still, we can revisit that every once in a while.
Nice of him to stay in the news like that for us.
OJ?
Now, let me ask you this.
Don't you think that, right?
Now, since like Paul, who was it?
Frank Wirtz said, America doesn't want to hear about this anymore,
but all the dead people and all the, they're tired of it.
They're burned out because they don't know what to do.
Right.
Well, what can they do?
And so, wouldn't you think that maybe we'd rather have like another OJ mini series,
you know, with a trial on TV and a whole new video?
Sure.
Well, no, we got to do it right.
We got to start out with another slow speed chase.
First of all.
No, it'd be good.
That was memorable.
Remember, we were big.
Yeah, a Pontiac Solstice would be good.
I'd be glad that you're on the keys.
Hey, get a thalada here, OJ.
Get that thing out of here.
I don't think you'll wreck it, do you?
You didn't wreck the Bronco.
No, he wasn't driving.
He wasn't driving.
That's right.
I forgot about that in the back seat.
We can get an EC up here.
That's right.
He was in the back seat with a gun who was in.
That's what I'm going to be if the solstice had a back seat,
which he doesn't.
I'm going to be in the riding shotgun with a shotgun.
Does it have a rumble seat?
Oh, let's get ready to tumble, rumble.
Anyway, here's the survey, such as it is 775.
It's not a survey.
It's a freaking poll.
It's a really bad one.
Oh, and how come nobody else has told us about the signal?
Have you had anybody give me any information about that?
No.
Why are you chuckling when I ask you that question?
Nobody cares.
See, the audience thinks you're joking.
I know better.
I know you're not joking.
That's the part that makes me...
Well, I like hitting the tag for Brandy's a half hour after I did the spot.
Hey, it's been a little late.
Never.
He couldn't find out it was logged in the first break, you know,
and do something about it before the spot already ran with the wrong tag.
Because he's an idiot.
He's Brian Schmuss.
What was claimed to fame was that his current wife, then his girlfriend,
and he were making a woppy in the press...
In the press...
Are both at the Rienter Arena there.
Panther game.
Well, I knew there was something to like about him.
Yeah, they were doing it.
What's the most embarrassing factor of old age is the poll question?
Brandy came up with this.
Brandy, who used to be my friend until today,
until they came up with this poll, nice.
All right.
He lose control of your bowels 190.
That is not what happens when you die.
In fact, I noticed...
What did they say?
I noticed on the news a lot of the scenes from a rack that we see a lot of the tape from a rack.
They're carrying bodies away and there's like so out pantaloons.
You know, you can see that they're dead and at the very end.
In the very end, they lost control.
Of course, I guess at that point, you don't really care.
The embarrassment factor, it vanishes once you're dead.
You lose control of your bowels 190.
You have to wear diapers or a bag 179, which to me, I don't really see the difference,
but it's a good thing I put that other one on there, you know?
Otherwise, we'd be sucking wind on this poll.
We'd be sucking like our signal is today according to that guy in Coral Springs.
I mean, it's not like Coral Springs is all that far away, you know?
Not like we got a thing from a guy in Jacksonville or something like that.
Can't hear you guys today.
What's wrong?
You know, like that.
Maybe we cut down to like a thousand watts.
Maybe.
Seven some cash, you know, for rainy day.
Tons of nose and ear hair when you go old, 85,
take it from old Neil Mann, that's for show.
Lots of nose and ear hair.
Losing your memory 71 can't get enough no more 60.
Want a pet?
You go see now, 48.
Your body, your sags, your wrinkles, 40.
You lose your hair, 36.
You lose your teeth, 25.
Getting poked and prodded, 23.
Depending, of course, on where you're getting poked.
And your hair goes gray or white only 19, a 776.
Well, I think you got 800 licks for sure.
What are we going for 900 today?
Yeah, about that.
Which is not bad on a really marginal pool.
And especially when we're running about six watts,
and nobody can hear us anyway.
Nice going fat ass, Johnny.
Joe, I'm going to tell you, man, you are really running this station.
You're really running it, yeah?
When you say?
I would.
Now, do you see him at all anymore?
Does he come on this morning?
And what are they saying?
Hello, and this and that?
Hello, and this and that.
The small time.
We're both small.
You playing small ball?
Pro 13 at 560 WQM.
Oh boy!
I am guilty.
What the hell?
I got angry.
I killed Nicole.
Absolutely.
Here I am.
I understand.
I will tell it all.
About a man who no longer can be playing pro football.
Everywhere people stare each and every day.
They see me on TV.
And I give them say.
Hey, you didn't hide that glove of a day.
You're fairly.
Hey, you didn't hide that glove of a day.
Justifying I won't lie like Kato Kailin.
His defense makes no sense, led by Johnny Coquins.
Now I see the jury look at DNA.
Gather around all the browns.
Let me give them say.
You're fairly.
Hey, you didn't hide that glove of a day.
I'm tired of it.
Hey, you didn't hide that glove of a day.
Hey, you didn't hide that glove of a day.
Hey, you didn't hide that glove of a day.
I'm tired of it.

Simpson. I hate him like poison. He's pure scum. I hope he wrought in jail. He's misunderstood. I'm a fan or I'm a huge fan.
Don't you think that covers the entire spectrum of OJ sentiment?
And then something. Yeah, all the way did leave out that
So I think as soon as we get to 900, it's up to be very soon. I'll change the pool. Do I have your permission to do that, Chris?
Yes, or I'm gonna like it screw you. Ted Rawl writes the war party Democrats
Slided for long Iraq and reporters go along. That's your favorite George. Ted Rawl is a good guy to me. Yeah, the cartoons the articles
They're all great correct. He says Americans don't know how their government works Democrats and controller Congress are taking advantage of our
Ignorance to continue the war in Iraq which brings up two questions
Why won't the anti-war Democrats act to stop the carnage and why are reporters calling them on it?
Democrats writes Charles Babington and AP Adam that appeared in hundreds of newspapers control both chambers of Congress
But lack the numbers to override President Bush's vetoes of bids to mandate truth withdrawals from Iraq
It's a half-truth at best the Democrats narrow majority is less than the two-thirds majority they need to override a veto
Here's the full truth that doesn't matter
In June fairness and accuracy in reporting's extra magazine wrote if the Democratic controlled Congress wanted to force the Bush administration
Or accept a bill a within a withdrawal timeline
It didn't have to pass the bill over Bush's veto
It just had to make clear that no Iraq war spending to build out of timeline would be forthcoming
Democratic leaders know that and here's how I know they know days after taking control of Congress on January 30th
Invited five constitutional law experts to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee to ask them how they could end the war
Four out of five of the experts were that the Democrats could stop the Iraq war just like that just like that
Today we've heard convincing testimony and analysis that Congress has the power to stop the war for once to a senator
Russ fine-gold Democrat of Wisconsin's had yet a month later still no one in sight
The Democrats won the 2006 elections with promises to win the war weeks after taking over Congress
However Republicans spooked them with one of the most ludicrous talking points of all time cutting off the money
They said would abandon US soldiers at the front their ammo dwindling is all cut in surgeons swarmed over them
Actually the fact that I have to write this face to the American rights intellectual dishonesty the troops would go to the airport
They would board airplanes they would fly home
Democrats worry that they'll be portrayed as weak on defense if they act unilaterally to pull out of Iraq
Irony ironies there was sing out to avoid looking wimpy
Forcing Republicans to vote with them to end the war they calculate would give them political cover extra continued Democrats may not have wanted to pay
These imposing political costs of cutting off funding
But news coverage should have made clear that this wasn't choice not something forced on them by lack of a veto prognority
Rather than set the record straight the media continues to spread the Democrats can't stop the Republicans war crap this week
Michael Duffy time magazine says if Democrats had more votes especially in the house
They might be able to force Bush to change course but Bush will fight any resolution fancy giving me with the veto that is things
Stand now the Democrats cannot override but the president's critics will try
Continue to try hoping to attract moderate Republicans who are fearful of losing their seats next year
Occasionally time invites me to its Christmas party if I score an invite this year
He says my present for their fact checkers will be a copy of the Constitution
Brian Nolton in New York Times
Nolton dutifully quoted Democratic Senator Joe Biden's claim that there were political limits on his party even with a congressional majority itself since November's midterm elections
This is the president's war Biden said unless we get 67 votes to operate right as veto
There's nothing we can do to stop it not only do the Times fail to call Biden on his brazen lie it gave him the last word
You think the Democrats would want to end the Iraq war before they're likely to be taking to the White House
But that's because you're a human being not a politician
Politicians are happy to dispatch hundreds of young American men and women of certain death along with thousands of Iraqis if the bloodshed squeezes out an extra half percentage at the polls
Read in Pelosi prefer to run against a disastrous ongoing Republican war then point out to a fragile Democratic brokered peace
Why are so many respected journalists
Peridim the Democratic Party lying? I suspect that corporate media culture rather than Judith Milo style malfeasance is largely to blame
Inkstate newsrooms have been replaced by bullpen offices indistinguishable from those of banks or insurance companies
Reporters used to come from the working classes. They distressed at politicians and businessmen and politicians and businessmen load them today
Journalist are products of cookie cutter journalism schools because graduate schools really offer scholarships
Few come from the lower middle class. They look like businessmen when they meet a politician
They see a possible friend they were suits and ties and when a US Senator like Joe Biden feeds him a line of crap
They gobbled up says your close personal friend and buddy
He's great about gobbled up. I
Wouldn't be surprised if by the bottom of the hour we got our 900 votes. We got a 94
I
Now we can change the poll and everybody can start ripping. Oh Jay the ass the gigantic big nasty smelly pimply ass that he so
Generally deserves is a generously a genuine why he deserves it?
He's a turd oh
You're wrong. The old Joe was a great player. Maybe he would at Josh Strap
He was a great broadcasting great actor too. Don't forget those great movies. He was
Was that one?
The towering inferno was in it. I don't remember that
Some of those disaster movies in other words if old Joe was in it it was a disaster
So was that long enough that the religion story or what the other one?
I don't know yet the anti-religious story well, I told you I guess I I read it fast enough sometimes I look at this and oh
It's a whole bunch of pages Jesus
Well, when you got experience rambling on you know reading the newspaper the telephone director which I'm gonna be doing the rest of the week
You can really pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop like motor mouth
Still a 94 on a poll what is wrong with these people?
When you think that by the time I got to a scene. Hey, we're gonna have 900 by the bottom. They wouldn't we had it?
Shoulder
Shoulder could have what a back in the day remember those days. I keep asking that question because I'm sure you it's like a test, you know
Like I remember when we were in radio
I remember that I remember that partly I pined for those guys
When sports talk I can probably like six till what was it two hours or one hour two hours six to eight right?
Mm-hmm VM in the PM
And even at that point it was like oh gee what are we gonna talk about today the dolphins?
So yeah, this has been going on for a lot of years hasn't it Chris how many years since they made the playoffs is it's five
It's five years and this is gonna be six
Anybody think in the future gonna make the playoffs this year? No Chris? No
I'm Anna Nicole Smith's former attorney in BFF Howard K. Stun and I'm Larry Burkhead the father of Anna's baby
In her new slanderous book TV anchor Rita Cosby claims that Larry and I are gay love
It's fat pig is gonna get sued. I'm a manly man. Oh, yes you are. Is that a new shit?
Don't you love it? I really think it sets off my eyes
It's to die for
Anyway Rita Cosby we will prove that we're not gay. Yeah
How are we gonna do that? We will kiss then everyone will see how
Disgusted we are
Oh, uh, we do it right here in front of everyone good point. Let's go into men's room
It's very romantic in here Larry. Hey Howard did you just tap my foot? It wasn't me
Farry it was after this when I'm in the stall. I just have a wife stand. Uh, aren't you Senator Larry Craig? Yes, but I'm not gay
I don't do those kind of things neither do we
So what are you guys doing in here? We came in here to kiss
Yeah, but we're only a kiss and a proof or not gay. What are you doing?
Instead of to Craig checking the stall for undercover cop reporters are other Republicans
All clear. Okay, boy. Pucker up
blonde ambition the untold story behind Anna Nicole Smith's death by Rita Cosby coming soon to a men's room near you
This is I with this news. It now appears that Senator Larry Craig may not go quietly after all a half hour before announcing his intent
He left this message apparently meant for his lawyer at the wrong number
Billy, this is Larry Craig calling. I am gay. I seek activity and bathrooms
I lower my pan the squid my leg. I hope Idahoans will allow me to continue serving gay people at the Minneapolis airport
Thank you
Welcome to the 560 WKM. Okay, the new pull is up the OJ pull and I got to be honest with it. It's hard to choose, you know
We have five oats on there and maybe it's gonna be slow because it's difficult to choose
I voted for I hate him like poison
But he's pure scum and I hope he rots in jail also our sentiments of mine. I'm sure yours as well
I'm gonna vote for I hope he rots in jail. I hope you rots. I'll take kill him. Senator
Geettle really think about him enough to hate him. How about I hope he they kill him in jail. All right
How about that Chris or rape him? Okay
What's the most embarrassing factor of old age we squeaked out we squeezed out 900 votes when it doubts squeeze it out
Don't do it
You lose oh well the very first choice on here is like when it doubts squeeze it out you lose control of your bowel
298 said you have to wear diapers or a bag
tons of ear and nose hair 92 losing your memory 87 can't get it off 76
But like bubble would say that all depends on what it is
Your body sags are wrinkles 52 you've seen out 52
You lose your hair 38 you lose your teeth 32
Getting poked in prod at 26 and your hair goes gray or white only 20 out of 900 votes
Now let's see how the new pool is coming. I just couldn't wait you know because I have I have this anti oh here it is
Well all right since it says oh we didn't get to hear the audio again
He just he just played it for the four million time. I'm sure everybody's heard it by now get up against the mother
Effin wall I want my crap back you know like that
He says it was just a misunderstanding oh 24 votes are starting to come in a big chance now that they know we got the new
Pull up now that we cut up with the delay how long a delay we run in about 25 days now
Yeah 30 seconds just wait a couple weeks. We got a real good show in there for you
24 votes. What's your take on OJ Simpson?
I hope he rocks in jail 11 now let's see did you also add I hope they kill him in jail or rate him or something like that. I didn't add it
Rodding is fine. All right here we go. I hope he rocks in jail 11. I hate him like poison five. I'm a huge fan four
I'm a huge fan four now is that for real or just to piss me off
I hope they kill him in jail three. He's pure scum three. He's misunderstood too and I'm a fan none
I'm a fan zero
And then turning it over to a news organization unless OJ's not really knowing what's going on
But the thing that OJ said right from the beginning there were no guns involved and everybody makes money off of OJ
Hey, we had two lawyers that lost the law. Oh here we go. No, you're a politician. This will be
OJ's a profit base for everybody. Okay, but does the tape leave any doubt in your mind that
Sure, the voice that is presumed to be his that sounds like the person in charge on that tape that that can't be good
Well, if there's no guns involved and you're not going to do it and you come any to say I want my stuff back
That's not technically robbery if OJ did not know guns were involved
He's saying hey, I want my stuff back and he's screaming in yelling not many people are gonna prosecute that of course
Unless you want to become famous for prosecuting
Okay, be sure you hear that part about it's technically is not robbery
I mean break this down for folks if you take my iPod and leave with it
Can I bust up in your room and say hey, give me that and is that still considered robbery gun or not?
Can I still threaten you in a way in which it's still robbery?
Absolutely not and when you threaten me I'm gonna pick up my cell phone and call 911 and call the police
I mean you can act DJ Bernstein. I wonder what the BJ stands for
They'll get your stuff back
But at a certain point when you make a threat or you bring a weapon or someone your with brings a weapon
Which is what's alleged here then you've got a problem and you've got the kind of charges that I'm a huge fan for
And I'm a fan one we got five people out of 36 who are still fans no matter what he does
Oh, it's the juice. It's OJ. He's great. They love OJ
No matter what he does
He could come to their home and get on their front porch and squat and drop
400 pounds of
Stinking smelly manure
And they would say hey, that's the best smell of crap. I've ever smelled my life, you know what?
It must be good because even though we smelled it it was OJ the Delta like that to come testify possibly against OJ
Leaving OJ standing there with no bail right now. What are the chances though?
Through if he goes in there with this group of folks that he didn't know they had guns
I can't you really make that argument well, you know, we just don't know yet
Of course not
Now are you big on the air? Well, what kind of phone are you doing these days?
Kind of phone like what cell phone yeah the the old sidekick until my contract runs out then I'm gonna
Ask you about the sidekick because I know somebody that's driving me absolutely insane at once one and of course
Rarges bought out the phyto they used to make sidekick and they don't make it anymore
So what what's the deal on sidekick is it good or is it a piece of
In some ways yes in some ways no overall. I hate it though really it sucks as a phone if you do a lot of emailing and texting
Then it's great and what about the iPhone which should your close friend Dave was here this weekend
Showed me the iPhone. I think it's a crap. I have no really nifty and yeah, it looks good
I have no personal experience with it so I can't answer that because like when you text message somebody on iPhone
It doesn't even go like thing you like and you can't adjust the level on it. You can't make it loud, you know, right
Apple likes options. I see
Palm just unleashed its long-room retrio 500 v
For photo phones and subscribers in Europe and it boasts a new flatter style that we've been seeing in many fuzzy photos
Peak inside and there's not much new going on it says here. This is on what this is on Yahoo
Said to arrive in Europe in South Africa next month, but not award on pricing or US release
But I'm sure we'll see here in the near future
The 500 of these new shell represents the most significant trio we designed years somebody told me the trio is a piece of crap
Is that true? I don't have personal knowledge. I got my blackberry. You know something. I I'm fine
I don't need anything else anything new. I'm not you know
Just fine with me
Flatter and with more rounded edges the 500 v not to be confused with the upcoming central for a sprint
There's a striking resemblance to the dash on T-Mobile and it's a welcome change for a phone that looked more or less the same since 2002
Beneath the new shell, however, we're still talking windows mobile six the stripped down version of WM6
Actually, which means no touch screen or status instead you navigate with a soft keys in the four-way mouse
You get a decent suite of mobile office apps including word excel and PowerPoint plus push email
Companion that said was supposed to see a trio with a new
Something based. I can't read it before the years on me. They'll even reverse proms forciens. I can't read it
What about you interested in the 500 v or he had enough of the trio line it says here. I don't have any of it
I've heard of the trio's crap
What do you say you had one scene one? I've seen them, but I haven't used them. So I mean I I know people that have the
say that they're great
I mean, I like the features when I look at what it does
Yeah, but I haven't used it you know it takes using it to have a real
Steel one go. I mean find a place where somebody's got one and go in there with some of four armed thugs and say
Up against them. I'll give us them on the f and phone like that, you know
And then of course you can always say oh well, it's no not a robbery just we want my crap back, you know say was yours
We're awaiting the there's gonna be a press conference in Vegas
Which I wouldn't be surprised if they have one of those podiums, you know
With 6,000 microphones on it and they keep showing us the shot of the podium and any second now we're gonna have a thing
What's your take on OJ Simpson who's back in the news and as usual in a
Negatory disgusting grotesque subhuman unacceptable way
I hope he rots in jail 20. He's pure scum 13. I hope they kill him in jail 9. Wow can I change my vote?
I'm a huge fan 7 I
Hate him like poison five. He's misunderstood too and I'm a fan one
We have eight out of 57 where either a big fan or just slightly stupid
What the hell is your
Forty-two five sixty QAM the fourth leader say cheese
You
Oxygen to pull the plug on OJ
Nobody wants to hear what he has to say
The book and the show were
Tid
being
She
This is the one we say, should I go away?
I don't believe there's ever been a question
That the juice man is guilty of sin
Maybe we'll always miss when he calls those two people
And shut up, or chase shut up
You had a bad day and two people died
The cheer is that you go, but you really should have cried
You shouldn't have cried, but not one single sin
Because nobody cares, you can't afford to pay rent
We all want to say shut up, or wait
There's no way this can be done
We're due to drinking, so chase shut up
That's the movie
Shut up, or wait
Chris, I got some real miraculous comeback here today
Me, or I'm curious, do you want to know why?
Why?
We're going to make a thousand votes
We'll get that in my madness
We got 900 on the first floor, right? We got 89 on this one
And you know the way they're coming in a big chunks on OJ, Pro and Con
And in between, underline the con part
We're going to make a hundred on this by two o'clock
Didn't I say we hit a thousand today?
You said the dolphins suck
Osset said we hit a thousand
Didn't you say the dolphins suck and Trent Green is an embarrassing old man
No, I didn't think I'd complain about their offense because they don't have one
And that what you said?
Not quite
And did you say Trent says, and Emma's going to beat the Hurricanes on Thursday
Even though you're going to be running the board with creepy, robber creeper
And that what you said?
Maybe
We got 90, we only need ten more to get to a hundred, which means a thousand
Now I realize we'll put an asterisk next to it in our record book
No, we won't
No, we will not
We'll take it by hook or by crook
Robert Fisk, who writes for the independent and Britain, says in the Colosseum
Thoughts turned to death
Do I have time to do this?
If you talk fast
I don't want to talk fast
At midnight on Thursday I lay on my back in the Colosseum and looked at a pageant of stars above Rome
Where the lion's torn to gladiators and only a few meters from the cross
Marking the place of St. Paul's Cruisive Fiction
Marted him of course has become an uneasy word of this stage of the in this age of the suicide bomber
I can only reflect on how a center of cruelty could become one of the greatest tourist attractions of our times
An attend intelligence station had asked me to talk about capital punishment in the Middle East for a series on American executions and death row prisoners
Two generators had melted down an attempt to flood the ancient arena with light hence the moment of reflection
Readers with serious money may also like to know that it cost 75,000 pounds that's $150,000 to hire the Colosseum for 24 hours
A cool hot 10,500 pounds just for a little night under the stars
And who could not think of capital punishment in the Colosseum?
Watching the first episode of the Italian TV series which we come to the visits of Italian man and woman to two Americans with spent years on death row in Texas
I was struck by how both prisoners who may or may not have remembered amid their drug-induced comas whether or not they murdered anybody had clearly reformed
Both deeply regretted their crimes both pray the one day they could return to live good lives
To care for their children to go shopping walk the dog in other words they were no longer the criminals they were when they were sentenced
Given their predicament I guess anyone would reform but I suspect that killer innocence is not what the death sentence is about
My dad was perfectly aware that the young Australian soldier he was already directs to the first world war and killed a British military policeman in Paris
But the Australian promised to live an upright and straightforward life at pardoned
My father refused to kill the Australian somebody else shot him instead
Capital punishment for those who believe in it is almost a passion
I rather think it's close to an addiction something like smoking alcohol or a smoking or alcohol which can be cured only by total accidents
And no excuses for secret Japanese executions or lethal injections in Texas or head chopping outside Saudi Arabian mosques
But how do you reach this stage when humanity is so obsessed with death in so barbaric a form?
Whenever the Iranian string up drug dealers or rapists and who knows their guilt or innocence the cranes which hoist these unfortunate into the sky like death thrashes are always surrounded by thousands of men and women often chanting
God is great. They did this even when a young woman was hanged
Surely some of these people are against such terrible punishment but there is it seems something primal in our desire for judicial killings
George Bernard Shaw once wrote that if Christians were thrown to the lions in the world Albert Hall they would be a packed house every night
I'm sure he was right. Did not those thousands of Romans pack this very same sinister call a seam in which I was lying to watch just such a carnage?
Wasn't Sodom who stands execution part of our very own attempt to distract the Iraqis with bread and circuses?
The shrieking executioners on the mobile phone video in the bag that equivalent the gladiators putting the enemies to the sword?
Nor let us remember as execution only the prerogative of states and presidents the IRA practice capital punishment the Taliban practices execution and sodas al-Qaeda
Of some have been loved and I heard this from him in prison believes in the Islamic punishment of head chopping
I remember the crowds who lynched three Palestinian collaborators in heaven in 2001 their near-naked bodies later swinging from electric pylons while small children through stones at their torsos
The thousands who chewed when their carcasses were tossed with a roar of laughter into a garbage truck
I was so appalled that I couldn't write a my notebook and instead drew pictures of this obscenity
They still are in the pages of my notebook today hanging upside down like Saint Paul legs a skew above their heads their bodies punctured by cigarette burns
The leading antagonist in the preposterous war on terror which were also supposed to be fighting
Mr. Bush and bin Laden are always talking about death and sacrifice although in his latest video tape the latter showed a touching faith in American democracy when he claimed the American people had voted for Bush's first presidency
For bin Laden 9-11-2001 was punishment for America's bloodshed in the Muslim world
Indeed more and more attacks by both the role of the North and North of Iraq soldiers are turning into revenge operations
Was not the first seat to fallujah revenge for the killing and desecration of bodies of American mercenaries
Wasn't Abu Gharr part of our revenge for 9-11 and the failures in Iraq?
Many of the suicide attacks in the Middle East and Palestine and Afghanistan in Iraq are specifically named after martyrs killed in the previous operations
Al-Qaeda in Iraq stated explicitly that it executed U.S. troops in retaliation for the rape and murder of an Iraqi girl south of Baghdad
Yet I fear the real problem goes beyond the individual act of killing judicial or otherwise in a weird frightening way we believe in violent death
We regard it as a policy option much as we do much as to do with self-preservation on a national scale as punishment for named and individual wrongdoers
We believe in war for what is a great aggression? The invasion of Iraq in 2003 for example except capital punishment on a mass scale
We civilize nations like the dark armies we believe we are fighting are convinced that the inflection of death on an awesome scale can be morally justified
And that's the problem I'm afraid when we go to war we're all putting on hoods and pulling the hangman's lever
And as long as we send our armies on the rampage whatever the justification will all go on streaming up and shooting and chopping off the heads of our criminals and murderers
With the same enthusiasm as the Romans cheered on the men of blood in the Coliseum 2000 years ago
Maybe we can take OJ to the Coliseum what do you think?
Sounds great I'll fetch the lions
String his hands up oh we need three more votes for that 100 to get us to a thousand for the day I think we can do it
No two more two more we'll do that easy
Once you take out OJ Simpson I hope he rots in jail 27 he's pure scum 26 I hope they kill him in jail 21
I'm a huge fan nine I hate him like poison eight he's misunderstood six
He just wants to be loved and I'm a fan one out of 98 I think we're gonna make that 100
You did a Chris you pulled it out and spread it as horrendous grotesque embarrassing pull about how it is to be old
