And he's from...
A lot of bitches!
Five!
With your Rogers eyes for its whole radio, W-Q-A-L!
Well, I know my sister all my life.
That is why she's now my wife.
And I think my son may know it's true.
He's my nephew too.
Well, my daddy is my uncle Joe.
My mother is my dear Aunt Floyd.
It's very plain to see you.
My first cousin is me.
Well, I got your test message.
George and I have test message back and forth on my space this morning.
Because there are people having issues.
Their pages are not receiving no mail.
They just stand up and say,
I'm a priest.
Yeah, my space is screwed up.
And of course, our Q-A-M situation.
All the technical problems all the time, man.
It's just a part of life.
You just have to go with the flow.
Isn't that how it goes?
Right.
Go with the flow, because some technical things really blow.
Is the way it goes.
But I got your little test on here.
Is it exciting?
Oh, yeah.
Here's the pull from yesterday.
And speaking of pull, let's see.
I hate this pull today.
Oh, look at that.
It's in second place, 17.5%.
How about you, George, voted 100 times.
I told you I voted twice for Gong-Show.
Oh.
Which is winning.
Right.
Well, that's just silly people, you know?
And why do they need the Gong-Show when they've already got American Idol?
Because only the opening rounds are like the Gong-Show.
And then it gets really boring and who cares about that.
Well, I don't know, because I don't watch it anyway.
Oh, there's Susan Candy-Odie again.
Or what weird people do weird things.
Well, whatever.
Here's the pull from yesterday.
1352 votes.
Pretty weak, as a matter of fact.
What is the reaction you get when you see?
I know that this Charles B is really appreciate all these pulls people send in.
But when all of the pulls you people keep sending in are about, well, Niole,
or what is he wearing when he's sitting there?
And when's the last time he had wild diarrhea?
Yeah, all this other stuff about...
Damn!
Enough with that already.
It's really ponderous.
But it killed today.
It killed a pull.
Just like I got killed yesterday.
It would buy him.
Well, it would buy him Wednesday.
It would buy him everyday is good to be, uh, not good.
No good machines, man.
But that's the way it goes.
It's only money.
Why is that important?
What's the reaction you get when you tell others you listen to Niole?
Who's Niole Rogers?
326.24.1%.
And part of that is the tremendous promotion we get here on WQYM.
You can't complain about our promotion because we don't get any.
I don't tell anyone I listen to Niole, 169.
Probably a good idea.
Keep it quiet.
Keep it in the family.
All right.
So do I.
All right.
151.
Well, that's good.
Very enthusiastic.
But that's only 11%.
It's not like, you know,
although Chris said yesterday that everybody out there loves me.
You really believe that?
No.
No.
He's not saying.
Well, George answered for me.
No.
I can't stand that bastard.
Uh, how many?
Wait a minute.
All right.
So do I.
151.
Well, that's not too bad.
Still only 11%.
I can't stand the bastard.
111.
There's so many choices on here that I'm trying to read sideways.
He's still on.
I thought he retired or died.
Did, did, did, did 90.
You like Niole too?
I love him.
He's the center of my universe.
I want to meet him, stalk him, do him, be him.
Wear his skin, body suit, 78.
Ain't he the greatest, 67?
Why?
57.
Why are you listening to that?
55.
Laughter 55.
Laughter like, yeah, muted laughter.
I hate this poll only 52.
Yesterday 3.8% so it's better be your negative attitude.
So you were the one who was being a negative.
Yeah.
You F and Cami Pinto 48.
When you see on what station 38, why are you listening to a Fag 34?
F you get away from me 15 and why are you listening to an atheist 6?
What is so funny about that?
It just was.
Was it really?
Well, you're tickled easily.
That's good to say.
Yes.
Let's take a look at today's poll which George hates this one like poison.
It does him good.
Yeah, the hell you don't.
Didn't he say all they yesterday that he hated this poll?
I'm speaking objectively.
I think most people don't care about game shows that don't exist anymore.
I don't think we don't care about game shows.
759 votes, mister.
Let me tell you that.
And even the second place I hate this poll.
Oh, yeah.
And you want to know why I hate this poll?
Isn't it the second place because the other ones are so divided up.
And the ones that Brandon said in this morning, I forgot to add those on.
And that's okay.
Or because most people don't remember any of those shows.
I got other issues with this MySpacecraft, man.
MySpace is the Antichrist.
It's the Lose.
It does.
And maybe because I took Tom off of the yesterday, I think he's punishing you.
You know, I had a lot about that.
Although I think that's fine.
What?
I hadn't thought about that.
Yeah, think about that.
But my page is working fine.
It's other people's pages that have got issues.
But that's okay.
There's more than one way to slice a fish.
Which now do you fuck gameshow should they bring back to TV?
I don't see anything wrong with that poll.
770 votes.
And George thinks it's another one is all living in the past, polls.
It's for old people.
Well, you know what, too bad.
It's something that will be.
But the gong show.
The gong show.
150 votes.
He's bringing the same people back.
The Chuck Bear's die.
Chuck Bear's.
He did not die.
Sure, he's still in the tank.
It's probably very well preserved.
Yeah, he's the killing people from the CIA.
He's probably killing a bunch of Iraqi militants in surgeons.
But there's Prince Harry over there.
He's deployed in Iraq.
There he is.
What do they say?
Actually, he was a maggot magnet or something like that.
The target of hostility and all kinds of sunfire.
Too bad they don't kill a whole royal family.
That would be good.
That's bad.
I shouldn't have said that.
But I do mean that.
They don't make me sick.
Get a little much of it.
Including the Queen's sisters.
Now, didn't the one of them die?
She died from cancer?
Something?
Which one?
They all look so freaking constipated.
Which, of course, they are constant with a priest.
Anemic.
Pasty, nasty.
They look like sour.
They're going to look sour.
They look like they really don't go regular.
I'll tell you that.
With all that crap that they eat, they ought to be going every five minutes.
Which 90-Funk Game Show should they try to bring back to TV?
The Gong Show wins 158 hands down your pants.
I hate this pull 135.
17.5% hated.
They hate.
Uh-oh.
We don't like all that hate.
All that negative attitude.
So anyway, what's your last fourth century?
The newlywed Game 95.
Match Game 74.
That's what I voted.
I love that show.
And you're right, Gene Rayburn's dead.
And it would never be the same.
It would never be the same without him.
With his bell-bottom pants.
And those lapels.
And those mutton-chop cyberns.
You always laugh at me when I say that.
That's what they were.
That's what they called the mutton-chop cyberns back in the 70s.
Gene didn't have those, but Richard Dawson.
Yes, he did.
He did have those.
You were absolutely incorrect, sir.
All right.
Gene Rayburn had mutton-chop cyberns.
All right.
He has those big bell-bottom pants.
And they have those real thin, pencil-thin microphones.
Remember the ones I used to hand-held my try?
Anyway, it looked like an antenna.
It did.
With a ball on it.
Newlywed Game 95.
Match Game 77.
Let's make a deal of 40.
Monty Hall still alive.
He's a good Canadian Jewish boy.
He's 150 years old.
Let's make a deal of 40.
He made millions from that show of Monty Hall.
He's a very wealthy guy.
Do you know that?
Yes.
Canadian guy.
When Benstein's money, 38, you know, Benstein,
you can shove it, okay?
You can wipe with all your money.
I hate him.
Right wing piece of turrets.
Self-hating, right wing, uh, schmuck.
The dating game 34.
Now, he might still be alive with, uh, Jim Lane.
All right.
I can't even imagine.
I remember...
I don't remember what the hell it was on.
But they brought back somebody old game show hosts.
Maybe it was on the biography channel.
I don't know, but they brought them back.
And, you know, when you haven't seen a celebrity in about...
Oh, 20, 30, 40 years.
And then all of a sudden, you see him for the first time.
He's like, oh my God, he's got the mask of death on his face.
He don't look a day over 180.
You know what I mean?
Not not good.
I could once they go away, it's a good idea.
Don't come back.
Don't come back.
We don't want to see again.
It's too depressing.
It's a reminder like the poll we did yet, or the other day,
about to get an old.
The dating game 34, thoughts my line 26, they're all dead.
They're all dead except soupy sales.
To tell the truth 25, Bud Coyer, he's long dead.
He was Superman on the radio, Bud Coyer.
And I do think, I'm not positive, but I think he killed himself too,
and then George Reeves killed himself, Superman on television.
Not good to be super, man, guess not.
A pyramid 23.
Oh, I love the pyramid. Dick Clark's still alive.
They could vege him up a little bit.
Yeah.
Well, if anybody deserved it, you know, Michael Moore,
sure showed him up for what he was.
And all those years that we worship Dick.
Concentration 22, the Joker's Wild 20,
named that tune 20.
Now that was Tom Kennedy, I'm not named that tune.
Who was, what was he who was like Jack Narrow's brother?
Jack Narrow's, what show was he on?
He was on a bunch of shows, Jack Narrow's.
Oh, they were both right.
They were both professional gameshow hosts.
And they were brothers.
Tom Kennedy was on the internet too.
And that was pretty good show.
I could name that tune in three notes.
That, that, that, that, that's it.
Love Connection 19.
That was the very anxious Chuck Swillery.
Boy, do I dislike him.
You can't complain about his talent.
He don't have any.
He almost, I mean, I, I know you don't like the wheel of fortune,
but back when they first went on, before they would just
have the regular prizes and mostly cash.
And you'd have so much money that you'd win.
And then you'd go shopping.
Remember that?
Oh, yeah.
Let's go shopping and they had the ceramic Dalmatian
and all those stupid, chinsy things.
Let's go shopping.
And anyway, that show Dan knew went off the year
because Chuck Swillery, and how much talent
does it take to be the host on that show?
I mean, what does Pat Say Jack do?
Does he say anything clever?
I'm using, I mean, I like him.
He's fine.
But he, you know, he doesn't do much.
And the same with your girlfriend, Vanna.
Password 15, Alan Ludden.
He's dead, long since dead.
He was married to that beard that bull-like Betty White.
Card Sharks 8, truth or consequences 8,
the reason I know that Alan Ludden was gay
because Bill Carter used to work with him at WMEX in Boston.
They told me about some event that they had.
Some people were dancing and Alan Ludden was dancing
with his boyfriend or something like that.
I don't know.
They're making a difference.
He's long dead.
So you can out people who are dead.
What are they going to say about it?
Right?
Like Selenio, James Dean.
They're dead.
Selenminio.
No, not James Dean.
Yes.
Card Sharks 8, truth or consequences 8.
Bob Barker can go on that when he gets off the apprises right.
Say it all the century, six.
That was a bad show.
And I do believe that the uncle's Joe Dodgiole was on there.
Get out, Jack.
Get out, Jack.
That was before your time in your lucky.
He was one of the greatest tributes to illiteracy in the history
of America, man.
There have been so many of them.
Joe Grasiole.
I used to call him Joe Dodgiole because he used to do the Chrysler spots.
Joe Dodgiole.
Get out, Jack.
Man, was he illiterate?
When Luzid draw a five, I don't even remember that.
High rollers too.
Wasn't that Alex Trebek?
I'll take your word for it.
Another Canadian, by the way, your buddy Alex Trebek from Majeprity.
Can't stand that show and I can't stand him.
I used to like him when he was on constipation.
But then he got to be a real student electoral.
And he had all tales too.
Oh, we should also have, let's see, 800.
We should also have, oh no, better go back to that email.
If it's still there, this myspace thing that they man is really spastic.
Don't anybody get all panicky out there if your page is all screwed up?
It's just a whole bunch of people.
I'll take anybody else except, you know.
Except me.
Other people.
This wasn't too happy about it.
I understand the nature of the beast.
Are you starting to pick on me now or what?
Yes.
Oh, I can't find it now.
I think it's in the trash or whatever the hell I do with it.
Sorry Braden.
Where are his suggestions?
Oh, brother.
Well, what about, uh, press your luck.
Press your pants and press your luck.
How's that sound?
Yeah.
So there's a couple more you can add on there.
Press your, I mean, one more.
Press your luck.
I don't think the polls go over all I bet.
I mean, a lot of people hate it like you because they're young,
functioning, they don't remember any of these shows.
And anybody doesn't remember the Gong Show or watch the game show,
Chandler, you're missing some pretty good stuff.
The Gong Show is great.
You know that you have the Gong Show movie with a lot of outtakes
and behind the scenes.
And it was actually pretty funny the movie.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
And you did see the movie about Chuck Berry.
I did and I didn't have to.
That was very good.
Confessions of a dangerous mind.
Very good.
Excellent.
George is on top of it today.
I just might let him do the rest of the show.
In the banana republic, baby.
Only in Miami.
Absolutely.
Get me a ticket for an aeroplane.
Dr. Goody around a wheel of fortune game.
I just got to win.
Spin the wheel again.
Ovena, pick me a letter.
Bank rock.
What do you mean, bank?
I don't care how much money I got to spend.
Can't stand to look.
Get bad say.
Jack again.
Won't throw in the towers.
Still like by your powers.
Ovena, pick me a letter.
Hey, man.
What do you mean?
I'm not a fan of the game.
I'm not a fan of the game.
I'm not a fan of the game.
I'm not a fan of the game.
I'm not a fan of the game.

Lesson Safety has been changed.
8 problems in Lithuania.
......?
썹?
But deep inside your ass.
Anyway, getting back to the pool.
I hate when they do that.
Why can't they do it before the show?
They used to do it.
In fact, they used to do it like 7.30 in the morning.
Your line there is sound asleep and all of a sudden,
BAM!
You're like that, you know?
Not good.
All the old people probably complained.
All the old people probably complained.
I beg your pardon?
All the old people probably complained.
877 votes, you mean like me?
Maybe.
I don't complain.
I'm one of those people that runs around and come out.
I'm one of those condo-commando types,
like you have in South Florida running around.
I'll cheat and making so much noise down the hall.
And they got kids down here.
Yeah, I'm not one of those people.
I never will be.
877 on the pool, George.
That's not too shabby.
We'll have way over 900 by the top of the hour.
We're going to get 1,000 easy today.
It's fun, George.
It's a negative attitude.
Even though 18.1% of the percentage keeps going up by the way.
They hate to pull.
They're just kissing your ass.
Oh yeah.
They always do that.
Which cloudy fun game show should they bring back to TV?
Maybe the Gong Show 174.
Maybe they can bring back that bold like JP Morgan on there.
I think they're one.
She's dead.
I don't think so.
And what about rib-tailor?
You know, one's that.
One constant about a lot of the game shows the panelists.
Not back in the day.
They're really old ones like what's my line or to tell the truth.
But in later years, most of the, a lot of the panel is not most.
But many of them work.
Yeah.
Like Charles Nelson and Raleigh.
That's proud.
JP Morgan.
What's my line?
Yeah.
With Super Sales and Bennett Sir and Arlene Francis and Dorothy Killgallon and your host,
John Charles Daily also had long since dead.
He used to wear bow ties.
I'm really, I don't know.
I'm just deaf on guys that wear bow ties.
I hate this pool 159.
18% hated.
Well, we know I don't really care.
But they're still listening.
See, if they weren't involved and if they weren't in the middle of this,
then they wouldn't, you know, it's a different story.
It's not a tune out.
It's by the way you say.
The newlywed game 104.
Match game 86.
Wind Bens Dines, Money 43.
How can that have 43 votes?
First of all, it's one of the worst shows in history.
He's one of the most obnoxious bastards ever to come down the aisle.
I'll tell you why.
Why is that?
It's one that half the audience can remember in name.
Let's make a deal 43.
The dating game 41 to tell the truth 31.
The pyramid 27.
Now, I noticed we only put pyramid as opposed to like the $10,000 pyramid or the $25,000 or whatever.
The idea or the $100,000 pyramid.
Pyramid 27.
Don't we have a bit on it, but I have no idea what it's called.
I love it too, but I don't know what it is.
And it's...
Refreshed with everything.
Oh, it's about the pyramid.
Is it George Bush thing?
I don't know.
What's my line 26?
Concentration 25.
Now, the match in the board goes back.
I like that, Cheryl.
Q-downs was the first host and then art James and then the anxious Alex Treby.
I like it too.
I was not bad at it.
Oh, that was easy.
Although it was no match game, which was my favorite.
Name that tune 23.
Love Connection 22.
The Joker's Wild 21.
As Jack Berry would say, Joker, Joker, Joker.
Remember that he was terrible.
He was probably the worst game show host.
And he made a lot of money doing it too.
And then he got to jail and was there just standing right.
I think you may have won.
Yeah.
The Joker's...
Oh, well, how come that's not on here?
21.
21 needs to be on here.
That was with Charles Alfridevine, Nordrop and Charles Van Doren.
Or what a memory.
Are you too impressed?
No.
I know.
The Joker's Wild 21.
Do we put 21 on there or do it now?
Okay.
Password 16.
Card Charge 9.
Truth of consequences 9.
Sailor the Century 7.
Get that Jack!
He probably is one of my least favorite people that was ever on television in history.
Not just as a game show host, but also when he used to do Blow by Blow on a baseball games
and boy, he did Blow.
Joe Dodge, Yola.
Sailor the Century 7.
When losing draw 5.
Press your luck too.
Whammy.
Whammy.
In fact, I think that you went off the year when the announcer came on and said,
Whammy!
Got it, sucks.
High rulers to tabletales to remote control 1, Tick-Tack Dole 1.
That was Twinkie Martin deal with 400 teeth.
And the $64,000 challenge and question out of $888 votes.
They just went on there and they got the big old 21 man.
That was Jack Berry.
Now what?
I don't know if everyone's involved.
A bigger part?
You know what else, Permissing?
Go right ahead.
Hollywood squares.
Oh yeah, Hollywood squares with Peter Marshall and Paul Lin and Cliff Arquette, Charlie Weaver
and George Gobel.
Right.
And Joseph Gubbles and all that crowd.
Yeah, I like match game a lot.
And they could find somebody to do with that.
That's the problem when they bring these shows back like 400 times now.
They've tried to bring back family few.
They had to really be Anderson and they got this other goofy guy that's under trying to be funny.
If you don't have the right host for that show no matter how good the concept is,
just like Will Torture man, when Chuck Swallow was on it, that thing was a bomb.
Even the damn ceramic Dalmatian kept running off the set.
You know what it is?
So Drunk and Abnotchus was Richard Dawson was.
He was good on that.
He was a 14 man.
That's right, right, Seth?
That's right, I hate you.
He was good.
And then of course the fact that he would kiss all the chicks on the left.
Oh, why did he kiss the guys on the left?
Oh, because he wasn't a fake.
Oh, how do you know that?
I don't know that.
He has a son.
He actually, he was, he was married and divorced then about 400 times.
I'm not just drunk.
But nevertheless, very funny host.
I mean, that's the way it is in life.
There are a lot of very good hosts and they tend to be Abnotchus in real life.
Twenty twenty before 11 at QAN.
The U.
Gah!
Attention, sporthold.
Are you gay and hard all day?
Make it stay the flaccid way.
With new, hard away, the anti-irepid oil Robertson Heller.
Hello, this is Don Amici.
Perhaps you remember me from such film as trading places and cocoon.
I was excited to come back to tell you about this unexciting product designed to unexcite you.
Next time you're standing in the locker room surrounded by naked men.
Just wrap your lips around the things a guard shaped hard away in Heller.
Before you begin to hate yourself or getting around.
And you'll soften to a fliable mushroom that folds neatly into a confident and lean gaps.
Up a hard away anti-gay and teeth the bag gets away.
The old juxtaposed just take what used to be hide your hard away.
Ten forty five and five sixty WQIM.
So here's a fact from Nick.
I just read his thing.
Actually his messages came through. Just fine.
So I guess it's selective.
If they don't like him, maybe your my space is all screwed up today.
I think they don't like Chris.
That is correct.
But you said you've had these problems before.
Oh yeah, but apparently a friend has told me right now that
my my space page is all banged up.
They can't send receive nothing to me.
So they want?
They can't send me anything.
What do you mean it's all banged up?
What does that mean?
It's my space.
It's uncapable.
Yeah.
Well thank god my page ain't all banged up.
Just keep it all on a communicate with things like that.
But nevertheless, I'll survive.
And they will too.
Nick says I sent the old man to my space messages.
I just read him, okay Nick just calm down.
Okay.
These people are so damn pushy man they're worse than I am.
He hasn't read him yet.
I just read him.
Game show never already tried to bring back the Gong show and press your luck.
They were respectively called extreme Gong.
That's with a G, two G's, extreme Gong and whanny.
As in whanny got it sucks.
I just got through playing it.
They were very short-lived.
So all these jackasses going to bring the Gong show back wouldn't even tune in when they did it.
And the problem is it's like when they tried to bring back the famous restaurant
with different owners and a different menu and different food.
And you know you can bring back the name of a place.
Listen if I had even been in the name of the places I like it like that.
I Chris Kenner.
I had no idea that they were trying to bring back the Gong show.
I would have watched it if I'd known it was on there.
Yeah.
Somebody would have put a book or something like that.
Like the poll we took yesterday.
Neil Rogers is he still on?
Who the hell is that?
Where is he?
You know all that stuff.
One thing we don't want to do on this show is they're living in the past.
And if there's anybody living in the past,
it's way more than I'll ever begin to do it.
It's our close personal bald-handed buddy, chicken-neck.
And I don't know if you give him the kind of swirl that you give me about it.
Yes.
My God.
He is like Dorothy Phil Galen, reincarnated, I think.
He records old game shows from Cartoon Networks and then he gives them to me to watch.
And that's the reason that he's so good because he's a certified,
a crazy person.
Yes, he's real.
We love him.
Yeah, we do, but he's crazy.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Hi, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
Hey, I had a birthday a couple of days ago.
Yeah.
I just wanted to get a shout out for that, but real quick.
Well, what do you mean you want to get a shout out for that a couple of days ago?
I called, hello.
What birthday was it?
I actually ate it with a couple of weeks ago.
A couple of weeks ago.
I had a birthday back in November.
No, no, no, January 29th.
It's Oprah's birthday, unfortunately.
That's like a month ago.
Well, yeah.
And you want to give a shout out because you had a birthday about a month ago.
What birthday was it?
Was it like a major number?
It was actually 31.
I was 31.
31, like my 31st anniversary next month, like I said, a birthday.
Oh, we got something in common, you know?
Right.
There were 30 years in crappy Florida.
One more thing.
That Brock and Leigh remain you were ragging on yesterday.
Yeah.
It was funny.
I was thinking it should be called Brock and Locke.
You know, because he's a hebe.
Barack Obama is a hebe?
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No kidding.
Julie, Julie, we're going to say hebe.
Okay, you ready for that?
He's a hebe.
I'm not voting for you.
Holy cow, KFC asked the Vatican to bless its fish.
We're going to the death direct.
Sensor letter to the Vatican asking for a vanidic for 16th.
Oh, this is the best to bestow his papal blessing on the new fish snacker sandwich Vatican officials confirmed they have received the request.
We will keep you posted.
Oh, KFC our fish is blessed by the Vatican.
All right.
And they're showing this guy.
He's got all the ashes on his thumb and he's smirring these people on a forehead.
I'm going to tell you something.
I didn't see anybody yesterday.
It would bind on the street anywhere in my building with ashes.
A smirred on their forehead.
Because yesterday was ass Wednesday.
I'm going to tell you a series.
I really mean this from the bottom of my part.
Any of you people out there, if you allow them to do that to you, if you subject yourself to this kind of ridiculous crap, then I just want to cry.
You know, I just want to cry.
So I Steve Alimo said every day I want to cry.
So remember Steve Alimo from Rochester?
No, you don't.
Steve Alimo, whatever is name.
Billy Goat, since the fact he says, I'm young and I like to watch the old game shows on TV land.
I like the old happy go lucky themes and the outfits people had on back then.
He had most of them in the 70s.
They're the bell bottom pants and a lot in shop hair dudes.
Met in shop, whatever they were.
Cyburns.
It helps me understand how Bulk of Brian comes up with his bits.
There you go, Billy Goat.
Right.
Because he's living in the past.
He's in a time warp.
He's warped and he's in a time warp.
It says, hey chicken, you're stuck in a time warp.
Absolutely correct.
Let's make a deal and card charts.
There's another one needs to be on there.
Now let me say this to you.
Okay about card charts.
All right.
There were two different announcers on card charts.
Jim Perry was the good announcer in card charts.
That was great.
Huh?
Card charts is on it.
It is?
Yes.
It is not.
It's got ten votes.
You could have fooled me.
Card charts is on there.
And well, but it's a good thing that he mentioned.
Because Jim Perry was the good announcer and then they put the umptuous,
the most obnoxious game show host of all of them.
Bob U-Banks on there, you know, from the newlywed game.
Who always looked like he had a stiff neck.
He always had like, he had his neck at a neck brace.
There's something really bizarre about him.
How I thought his head was too big for his body.
Is that what it was?
Could have been.
Like it was.
Ready to fall over.
He was really the bad purple guy.
Maybe they should rub their hips together.
All right.
Two heads are better than one.
But anyway.
Yeah, that was pretty good show card charts.
I like it.
Although that also was slow and kind of drag.
You know.
And then they would waste a lot of the show talking to contestants asking a lot of.
See, that's the one thing on game shows that I hate.
Me too.
Is when they waste a lot of time getting the whole biography and the names of all the relatives
and all the people that they owe money to.
Oh, geez.
Give me a break already.
Will you please?
Let me show the.
You can play along too.
And and moves.
Yeah, that's right.
And moves.
Like even in the squeal of fortune,
you know that they do the first toss-up thing there.
And then oh, yeah.
Well, hey, Billy Smith.
Let's go over here and find out about Billy and his 15 kids.
It is a mother who gives a rat.
Oh, exactly.
Why do we have to go into all of that nonsense?
All that fine rise they say in Ethiopia.
Oh, my God.
I bet you we got the 21 doesn't have any votes.
So that was a good show.
Even though it was fixed.
918.
See, we're going to have a thousand meter early on this in spite of your negative.
Negatory attitude.
That's right.
I probably passed the negative attitude on the yesterday when I was so negative.
17.8% though hate the poll.
They hate it.
W-Q-A-M. Hello.
Q-A-M.
Yeah, Neil, please.
Yes sir, speaking.
Neil.
Yeah.
The original name that tune was George DeWitt.
He got caught.
Never heard of him.
He got caught in that peyola.
This is the wholesale pharmacy guy, Cornel.
Oh.
Yeah, but it was George DeWitt.
He used to hang around with Mike Gordon.
He was flying there playing with him in North Bay Village.
All right, guys.
Neil.
Okay, thanks for the, see the wholesale pharmacy with some useful information.
This was strictly useless, but at any rate, Mike DeWitt or whatever he said, Mike Gordon and I want to have with.
Now look at that.
That's interesting because I guess that's because I'm trying, I'm hitting this thing over and over.
We didn't do that again today because our engineering department blows.
And do we ever find out what it was this morning that had the pot like practically closed in there?
Robert Griefer probably playing the fast and loose.
And you know who probably puts them in charge of that as your boyfriend clearance.
Yeah, closed the pot so the old man can't even hear the show.
Oh, yeah, I really care like I want to hear that anyway.
WQAM, hello.
QAM.
Hey, Neil, I'm going to test your memory.
You didn't put Gary Moore's show on there.
Here we did.
I've got a secret.
Oh, no, no, no.
The early Gary Moore show.
Think black and white, 1952.
I haven't got any idea.
Beat the clock.
Oh, that wasn't Gary Moore.
That was Bud Codger.
All right.
Well, okay, so my memory is bad.
I'm not out there, right?
Beat the clock.
They used to have these stupid stunts like, you know, take six cups of water and stick them over the mundo shine with their teeth and think of that.
Yeah, beat the clock.
They had a whole version of it.
We used to play it.
I'm sure you did.
I think I think maybe a little bit too much.
Okay, we like to appell.
Yeah, he used to pay beat the clock.
Okay, what do we got on there?
And you say, yeah, clock.
923, okay?
We're going to clean your clock if you don't cut the crap.
I don't know if the audience seems to be into this heavy duty.
I don't know why you're so sour, man.
So sour.
I think we need to make those damn sour candies.
That's it.
Maybe two of them.
Job breakers.
Oh, that sounds pretty good though.
The ones that just scalded the linings.
Yeah, when you threw with those, all the skin from the inside of your mouth is like all raw and gone and think of it.
It's good.
WQA and hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Get right to the point with respect to your pole.
The Liars Club with Alan Ludden.
Oh, yeah, I remember that was done for about five minutes.
What about the GE College Bowl with Alan Ludden?
You know, Alan Ludden, the Liars Club with Larry Holtvis was on Betty Wood.
I just get to your saying.
I said, yeah, I remember it.
It was done for about five minutes.
All right.
And then closing with respect to George Corso.
He's an idiot because the toll-free line still doesn't work from Derby Lane, Jackass.
Okay, thanks, Pally.
You're a Jackass course.
So that's what this call was said from St. Pete.
From Derby Lane.
Derby Lane's been closed down for about 50 years.
Maybe if you call from a place where they have a phone.
Derby Lane.
Is that what he's talking about?
Derby Lane?
The one in St. Pete?
That was the dog track.
That was America's oldest dog track.
In fact, that may be the pole for tomorrow.
Name old racetracks and dog tracks that are no longer...
How about harness racing drivers who are dead like Elmer Conrad, huh?
Now we're talking.
See that shirt, you have real fast.
What?
930 votes on this pole.
Now what did this guy just say?
Because I wasn't paying a damn bit of attention to whatever he said.
I must...
He just...
Yeah, right.
Exactly. He tuned me out.
Who's on the hotline?
Or does somebody on the bat line?
Maybe it's from...
Oh, look at that.
Maybe it's your end's course, though.
Bat line. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Dick Feinberg.
Hey, Dick, how you doing?
Good. I just heard you mention racetracks, so...
I just mentioned Elmer Conrad.
Listen, you mentioned George Feneman earlier.
Yeah, but you've been here all the time.
And my favorite chill, with crowd chill.
You bet your life.
Da da da da da da, duck them sound pages 100 dollars.
Right. How can we don't have that on there? You bet your life.
And I'll tell you another one that you might remember because you're no far like me.
Remember Mike Stooky and Panimime Quiz?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
The...
Absolutely.
The one thing that you bet your life did give us the greatest quiz show question ever.
Yeah.
Who is very grand, too?
Yeah, that's correct. That is absolutely correct. I remember that.
But, you know, somebody, a crowd show impersonator could...
And a...
George...
And a person...
George Feminit, yeah.
Yeah, they would...
I think they could make a fortune with that show, bring that back.
Okay.
How you doing, Dick? Everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
So, I was good.
Yeah, just...
Just hanging out, listening to you.
You know, I'd hate to get a job, so I'd, you know, that tend to do so much stuff.
Yeah, and my good thinking.
Deeds working, that's what I always say. Okay, take care of yourself.
Okay, thanks.
See you.
Panimime Quiz and you bet your life.
Russell and Las Vegas says, Queen for a day, yeah, that's it, or is it Queens for a day?
You know, we had a bunch of Queens.
Queen for a day with Jack Bailey.
Speaking of harness drivers, Dick, Jack Bailey from Vernon Downs.
We really love that NBA experience.
I've here though, thought they were making...
Oh, no, look at that.
Are you reading this?
And I'm going to read that on a year.
So...
Don't go.
You're playing.
Any questions?
Here, stand for naked man.
In the shower soul.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young, young
and watch the Lord's Song stars through the country fr
cauliflower rolls over in the spring and spring with fucking
sels
This is not a circus and I'm not a clown.
We put a little bit of up and you like my red nose
and they pulled out the patch out of nose.
950 votes on the pool and I don't see Panamai Mquizz on there.
Did I just get through saying Panamai Mquizz when the Dick Finder called in
with you but your life I see you but your life.
Yeah but I don't see no Panamai Mquizz.
Is that because nobody knows how to spell Panamai?
That might be it.
Oh, Palamai? Panamai?
Either that or Chris just tuned it out.
Panamai Mquizz, man.
The host was Mike Stokey.
Remember Stokey's on the, I guess I shouldn't say remember.
They're still around. But that's still peanut brittle.
All the rest of the stuff, man.
You drive up by 95 and you're going up north and all the rest of the stuff.
Of course nowadays they've got all the, you know, they've got your Wendy's and Mickey D's and Burger King
and Kentucky Fried and RB's and all of these.
But they've also got the Stokeys right there at the, whatever.
Am I right? Still around.
As far as I know.
What a horrible place.
Peanut brittle, it's older than Methusel's grandma.
Don't think I've actually eaten there in my memory.
Maybe as a kid.
Hans Connoreed in a mining gingled room on Panamai Mquizz.
I'm sure that chicken I can remember is that and he and I are probably the only two.
They were both 100 years old when the show was on.
So they, if they were with us today, they'd be about 250.
But they're not. They're all dead.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM.
When's the, uh, my favorite cereal bowl coming out?
Tomorrow.
That's coming tomorrow.
Quisky.
Yeah.
Quisky, Quisky.
WDQAM, hello.
Hi, Mr.
Sounded a little bit sour to me that guy with his cereal, didn't he?
Sour cereal.
QAM, he probably likes hot and sour cereal, especially the sour part.
QAM.
Hello.
Yes.
Hey, uh, the name that tube.
The name that tube by Dick earth or me?
Uh, uh, see those little people you were talking about, okay?
That's the crowd that you're all excited about.
Or just like that.
Something about it is...
SHOOT!
...tied, which they should be.
I sure hope they do tie them, baby, because if you're going to reproduce,
the world's in big, deep trouble up here right now, Pally.
Iraq insurgents use chlorine and bomb attacks, speaking of a world-beam and tremble,
a truck bomb that combined explosives with chlorine gas blew up in southern Baghdad yesterday,
and official sediment represent a new and deadly tactic by insurgents against Iraqi civilians,
those poor shluppers over there.
It was at least the third truck bomb that a month to employ chlorine, a greenish gas.
Oh, ever a cut any greenish gas I sure have.
Also used in WWI, which burns the skin and can be fatal after just a few concentrated breaths.
Ha, ha, ha.
The bomb killed at least two people and wounded 32 of us, many of them sent to hospitals,
coughing and wheezing, police and medical officials said.
Iraqi and American officials said the use of chlorine seemed aimed to bringing a new level of fear and havoc to Iraq
as a new security plan for Baghdad takes shape.
Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman, said the attacks highlighted the fluidity of insurgent tactics in Iraq,
dominated by militant groups that often notice and repeated attacks that attract the most attention and cause the most suffering, the most surice.
Insurgents have shifted tactics to focus on helicopters, and yesterday one group forced down an American Black Hawk helicopter
to be eight sections of them since January 20th.
The enemy is adaptive Colonel Garver said the enemy wants to win.
Ha, I thought the enemy always wanted to lose because we're the good guys.
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
Sure, whatever.
963 votes, this half hour we're going over a thousand, and pretty damn close to it, and then you're gonna have egg on your push.
You're gonna have like a whole omelette on your face.
Paper or plastic, that's George's idea for tomorrow's pool.
Paper or plastic?
Normal or spastic?
WQAM, hello.
Speaking of green gas. WQAM, hello.
Good evening, yes.
I was trying to send you an email with a video I saw from Annie Colesmith out of Europe, where she was completely drugged out in the clown face, and this guy how it's normal.
You remember when it's been on TV on every channel for the past three days?
You have seen that already?
Yeah, about 400 times.
Oh, dude.
Alright, sorry, man.
And move to my own location.
What do you mean you were trying to send it to me, or what happened to it?
It's got to return.
It's at meal delivery.
It's meal roger at wqam.com, right?
Yeah, baby.
I'll see you later.
So get in here.
I don't know.
You know what?
How many times you tell these people that's not your email address?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I understand that.
The only way you're gonna get me a message is I'm like, my space, and that thing's all screwed up today anyway.
Although some of the messages are coming through just fine.
Now, how does that work, Chris?
If they don't like you, they screw up your pages at the dealer.
What?
I think it's just like their random way to screw with people.
I don't know.
But what do you mean to screw with people?
What is that?
In other words, they picked you off.
They picked you off of the crowd.
And they said we're gonna screw up Chris's email.
You know, they throw names in a hat and they pick it out.
It's kind of the same thing.
Yeah, well, tell that Tom guy to pick this.
Schmuck.
WQAM.
Hello.
Transpired, Dave.
WQAM, hello.
QAM.
Paper and plastic.
Don't you remember when extra and you have to bring your own bags?
I have to bring to New Year's Eve, but there are.
You have to bring your own bag or buy a bag.
It's supermarkets all over the world.
I know there comes as a great shock to a lot of you spoiled people out there.
Paper or plastic, my ass. How do you like that?
In Europe.
In all, every supermarket I've ever been.
And they don't give you the bag.
Well, they give you like one of those cheap little real thin plastic bags
that if you put more than a quarter of an ounce worth of food and they're just
falls all over the ground, you know, the bag splits open.
But if you want a real bag, you have to pay for it.
You know, a couple of whatever.
Yeah.
Maybe a 50 cent, 50 euro cent.
Meaning you might as well bring your own bag.
I mean, what do you do with the old ones anyway?
And if you get one of the good cloth bags, they sell like an Amsterdam.
I'm the same thing like an Albert Heine.
Hi, class, lovely.
Right.
Then, you know, if you're smart, you take it with you when you go shopping.
But of course, a lot of times when you leave the hotel if you're a tourist or even when I had the apartment.
You know, you don't think I'm going to go to the store.
And then you're not going to walk all the way home to go and pick up your little 50 cent bag
to go back in there unless you're really super cheap.
Okay.
But that's the way it works in the real world, okay, sir?
Una sacca.
WDQAM.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Love the poll.
18-year-old guy.
Love the poll.
Hey.
What about that new, too smart of you or a five-year-old?
Can I ignore the course or play that?
WDQAM.
Hello.
QAM.
Hola.
I just pressed this one and it's still stuff I know.
See, this is not working at all.
No.
No.
And I don't want to go off on a rant again about our technical incompetence here at QAM and about Joe Bell and doesn't give a crap in course of, of course, like, I'm glad the course, though, guys, calling.
I maybe he'll call 400 times today because you're right.
Be somebody that knows him.
Obviously, you've got a real bug up his ass about George Corso, who's our chief engineer, and I use the term very loosely.
Oh, yeah.
WDQAM.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes.
I have one for the poll.
Yeah.
I hope it may already be down there.
I don't know.
Take that dough with the...
Oh, it's already down there, sir.
It's already got three votes.
Not two, not two and two good.
All right.
That was with the winker.
Yeah, see that?
He didn't even know what the hell I'm talking about.
The winker, wink Martin, dude, you quizzling.
You cyppled in, man.
All right.
All right.
See, they think it's a poll building show again.
Well, which...
We don't mind adding a few because, you know, there are obviously 80,000 that we could put on there.
Sure.
What's upon a time back in the day that we're like, Zillion game shows on TV.
They were all over the place.
And it was pretty entertaining.
I mean, it wasn't like, you know, what's your name show?
DeGenerate.
Or some of the crap that's on now.
But then what is?
Exactly.
What could possibly be like Jerry Springer show?
What could be like that?
If you're like 12 years old and got, you know, Britney's life?
Well, I got a Britney story in my pile here.
As a matter of fact, it was sitting there next to me.
There's a judge again.
Is it about her miss shape and head?
And what did it help with?
No, it's about the side.
Guys, miss shape and the medical exam.
There's Judge Sidelin, okay?
Judge Sidelin.
Yes, George Sidelin.
I tell you one thing.
You notice he waxes his ball spot.
Look at the way the light is reflecting off that child.
All right.
All right.
I'm just watching the tune.
Let me see.
It looks like a, I guess I have some apples when you go in the supermarket.
Yeah.
So shiny man.
A very cool white.
This guy has, he has waxed that thing and his head too.
Big time.
Said you will not have to submit anyone at this point in time to DNA.
Look at the size of that wedding band he's got on there.
My God, I must go to about $80 billion.
Look at that.
Look at that thing.
Good.
Golly Miss Molly.
970 votes.
Well, at least whoever he's married to, she's getting a lot of laughs.
Probably mostly, mostly at night time I would think.
From your honey.
All right.
I believe that we have in our future.
If I keep carrying on this way.
If I say I'm sober it was just a lie.
I am so freaking high.
But it is easier than go to a meat.
And see how my name is with me.
I started long ago.
Smokes were fallen, dear, a little dull.
Herald with an LSD.
Angel dust and some feyote.
Love, crystal, that's their next to see.
Lying if I say that I'm sure free.
Airpods are your retreat.
They found some time on me.
You found the greatest drugs you're all inside of me.
Love and I've seen you.
It's like when we do the polls about the greatest actor.
And we have people on there like Grace Kelly and Liz Taylor and William Holden.
People like that.
How about the same people you're talking about?
Who knows about these games shows.
What do you think they know about those people?
And about Judy Garland and the Wizard of Odds and so on.
Well, those movies were to go out there.
There are some of these movies that you're talking about.
The classics, Ageless and seen by everyone no matter what their age.
Oh, there.
Okay.
Anybody seen the Wizard of Odds?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
Everybody out there hasn't seen the Wizard of Odds hold your hand up.
Look at that.
My God, it's overwhelming.
It's well-me, man.
As Britney Spears was reportedly checking out of a drug rehab center for the second time in a week.
Her estranged husband was making plans to go to court amid a custody dispute over their two children.
Say her estranged husband?
Her very strange husband, and her very strange behavior, and who we really care is okay to talk about what it used to be.
Kevin Federline and his lawyer were scheduled to appear at a downtown courthouse today for an emergency hearing superior court spokesman Alan Perichini told the MP.
But since it's only 8-20 in the morning out there, I'm sure they got plenty of time.
Yo, give me a beat!
I'll give you something.
In fact, here's another one for you.
Our best information is he will be here and she won't, said Perichini, but anything is possible.
It was no more issue Federline planned to raise.
Federline and Spears have two sons, House said, five month old Jaden James, and seventeen month old Sean Preston.
Jaden James.
I see.
Federline filed paper seeking his father's support in sole custody of the children after his spurious off-to-wender two-year marriage last November.
A temporary court order issued February 1 granted a couple joint custody until the end of this month.
Perichini said Federline's lawyer would try to convince a superior court commissioner that the matter is urgent enough to be handled quickly as in Pronto Tonto.
Well, look at this.
Roll X watches on my Blackboard.
I don't want any Roll X watches.
Sorry, even for five bucks.
One X or two.
Go ahead.
One X or two.
I didn't look at it.
I deleted it already.
It was on my Blackboard.
It was an email.
There was always peddling credit.
There's always spam on it, man.
Spurs bolted from a live rehab facility early yesterday, less than day after checking in.
See, that's why you were so confused because she just went from the other one to this one, and less than day after she was there.
I went out.
I went out.
I wasn't confused. That's what I was trying to tell you.
I'm not even going to respond.
I wouldn't even dignify that with a response.
Okay.
It was the second time in a week that Spurs reportedly entered a rehab facility and checked out before her first day was finished.
Federal lines manager Dan Demetro said there would be no comment on the latest Spirits departure.
Well, what's this day?
She's on the loose again.
What a quitter.
Yeah, she's in rehab for like five minutes at a time.
Maybe she just didn't have all that serious about the rehab.
You think?
Maybe we're not here.
You're clubbing up for her.
You see, once upon a time, a lot of people would have cared.
All the guys would have cared about that.
But now, like I said, think what she used to be, especially after dealing with him.
WDQYM, hello.
Jim!
WDQYM, hello.
Little more oxygen next time would be good.
QYM.
You know you're doing a good poll on game shows.
How about on the host's, man?
There's some killer host of some of those shows.
Yeah.
Like a Jamm Murray and Jean Rayberg.
Yeah.
Gary Madder's is the favorite, never mind.
Yeah.
He sounded like a radio guy, didn't he?
Yeah, he did.
He sounded like somebody who's obviously suffered a stress of way too many years in his business.
It's okay, Pally.
We can relate.
Give him a little pat on the head.
Tell him everything's going to be okay, even though of course it won't be.
It'll be just fine.
Are you sure?
WDQYM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Good.
Good.
How did you get through the consequences on your list?
Is Bob Barker, through the consequences on your list?
Is that on there?
With Bob Barker, who is correct?
It was on from through the consequences New Mexico, as a matter of fact.
Do you see if it's, uh, it's not on there.
Well, nine bucks.
Okay, he's got nine e-modes.
It's like I said, it's on there, yeah.
Okay, because he's going to need the jobs and he's got to go somewhere.
All right, buddy, keep the good work.
Okay.
What do you say he said he's got the good stuff and sounded like it.
Hey, it's nice to share.
Yeah, those magic mushrooms that came in on Monday, man, they just spread it all around town now.
Maybe that's what happened to everybody's Myspace page.
Maybe they got like a little, a little something something to them.
Which now the fun game show should they bring back to TV?
The Gong Show 204.
Nothing else is even close.
204.
Well, I mean, newlywed, newlywed game.
Oh, my God.
Are you people off your rocker or what?
Now, wait a minute.
That's something you like actually likes game shows.
That was the normal show.
It was funny.
They were always saying stupid, funny crap.
And it was always very obviously contrived and always hit.
And everything.
And by the way, little kid when I was a little bit.
Or something in the greatest show ever.
You hit his body, my back.
He's on with his stiff neck.
I didn't want to watch it.
I hated that show.
Gong Show 204.
I hate this pool, 171.
That's down to 17.2%.
That's one of our all time highest totals on the hate to pool.
Too bad.
The newlywed game, 13.
Match game, 99.
Now, there was a show.
How could the newlywed game be ahead of match game?
Well, there I agree with you.
I don't think a lot of people really saw or got match game.
They didn't get it?
I don't think they got it.
What do you mean they didn't get it?
What does that mean?
What was there to get?
Was this the first game?
Was it an intellectual show?
Well, you know, humor and comedy.
You have to have a brain cell to get it, to understand it, the jokes.
A lot of double entendres, a lot of subtlety to the humor that was going on on that show.
Yeah.
As opposed to somebody slipping and falling, which everyone can get.
Match game, 99.
Let's make a deal 50.
Win Ben stives money, 45.
The dating game, 45.
I'm going to make this pool only because it bears out again in general how bad people's taste is.
Clear eyes.
Dating game, 45.
To tell the truth, 34.
Concentration and the pyramid, both have...
The pyramid only have 30.
Oh, because it's up.
Ah!
Ah!
I'm being...
I'm not being fine with the response.
Name that 2nd, 27.
What's my line 26?
The Joker's Vile 23.
The Love Connection 22.
That also with the very anxious Chuck Swillery.
Horrible guy.
Horrible host.
Just a bad human being, I believe.
I could be wrong.
Password 17.
Card Sharks 11.
And like I said, the one with Jim Perry was good.
The one with the...
What's his name?
Stisnack, not good.
No, I don't like Chuck Swillery either.
You know who he reminds me of.
Somebody doing a bad Joe Rose impersonation.
Like Joe Rose's evil brother.
Hmm.
His evil twin?
Yeah.
His...
Not a white guy.
The consequences 9.
Sail of the Century 7.
And that's amazing to me that that's got 7 votes.
Because I just barely remember that show.
It was on for about 4 minutes.
I just barely even remember it.
Sail of the Century.
Hollywood Square is 5.
That of course is the original Hollywood Square.
It's not this newer one that they brought back.
Whoopi Goldberg and all these other people.
Original, not so bad.
New one, blows hard.
You know who else was on the original one?
What was your name?
The old guy?
No, not Anne Frank.
Marie.
Not Anne Marie.
What's your name?
Rosey.
What was your name?
Not Rosey.
Not Ronald.
Rosey the...
Whatever.
And also the bigger picker upper or Rosey was on there too.
Wait 30 seconds.
But what was your name?
Rose Marie.
Rose Marie.
Oh, I don't know.
I tell them more show.
Yes.
Hollywood Square is 5.
Press your lock 5.
When was your draw 5?
Remote control 4.
I have no idea what that show was.
213.
Tick-tack Doe 3 with the winker.
The walker.
High rollers 2.
Telted havel tails 2.
You bet your life won.
Beat the clock 1.
And no votes for Panamion Quiz.
That's disgraceful.
The $64,000 question or the $64,000 challenge out of 995 all got the big...
Oh!
That's bad.
And by the bottom of the hour we're going to have our 1000 votes Mr. Smarty Panamion.
Son of a bitch.
This is I with the skewed.
Poppins has Britney Spears and her to rehab facility Wednesday.
But then check yourself out one day later.
Her less than model behavior lately has raised a lot of eyebrows.
Video taken early Sunday morning in New York shows Britney Spears getting out of her limo.
And a pottle of what appears to be vomit is visible in the back seats.
Her driver covers her with vomit as she rushes by the cameras.
Newspaper reports they Britney was partying at Manhattan's Club 10 June,
drinking tequila from a bottle.
And just roving so she could vomit.
And now video of her vomit shows Britney in a less than flattering light.
1.
52.
560.
4.000 votes is not even noon yet.
We got 1,000 and 6 votes.
9.
Whatever the hell it is.
6.9.
7.11.
Somebody Q.A.M. Hello.
I see that.
I heard a masculine way.
I give it the old punch and I saw it click.
Punch it again.
There we go.
Q.A.M. Hello.
Mr. Neal.
Yeah.
Such a beautiful day to hear your voice.
You enjoy it to make my morning.
I'm a smoke for a while because of school and now it's great.
That's very much for when I wasn't smoking.
For right now.
For always being there for me.
I love the pauses.
I love the pauses.
I love the pauses.
I find myself laughing hysterically every time the pauses come out.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
Alright.
Wow.
Yeah.
This is the Earth technically.
I might as well take this box and he put it on my balcony and I'm just hanging over there.
Like Tom Dulley said.
It's just a sick joke.
But you know what?
We don't really care.
They don't care?
Why should we care?
Why should I get all worked up into a sweat about it?
That's right.
Screw it.
If you don't care Joe Bell, we don't care either.
How do you like that Joe?
A technical disaster, a laughing stock of the broadcast industry.
Most amusing and abusing sad, very sad.
WNQIM, hello.
QIM, hola.
Judge Jody makes me dovey.
WNQIM, hello.
How about the moon?
WNQIM, hello.
I shoulda get all of it.
Yes sir.
Did you do on name that tune?
Did I do it?
No I never did that Joe.
But it's on a pool.
It's on 27 vote.
How about password?
Password.
How about password?
How come we don't have password on there?
Alan Lutton, what about him?
It's got 17 votes.
What mean the will, junior?
Did they hear?
That's a good idea.
Since you people have no material, just look at whatever is on a pool.
Look on your pewter.
That's right.
Call it in and suggest it to us.
Did they hear how many votes it's got?
Did they not try to bring back names that tune?
Because I've always wanted them to.
No, no, they're going to bring it back.
Oh good.
It's in the works.
It's in the wind.
I'm afraid they're going in the wind.
I can name that tune in four notes.
I can name it in one.
Da, da, da.
One.
I'll name it one.
I'll name it by the clue.
By what clue?
They would give you a little clue and then they would play the ditty.
They had different games within the game as you don't.
You know, for a guy that's so deadly on these game shows,
you seem to have it's an expert key to these in your reality.
I didn't say that I didn't like game shows ever.
Well maybe all the people out there like it.
It would certainly seem so.
We've got 80 trillion votes on the pool.
We got a thousand and fourteen votes in.
So only 1135 in a big city.
And the end of the course of it.
Hearing is still on CNN.
And everyone, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
And it never ends.
Well that judges anyway.
Well that's because he wants to have this A-ring circus man.
This is not a circus.
When he put the Pax Adams nose on this one,
that's made it was glowing too.
It was like one of those four lesson ones.
That to me was like a little bit of a hint.
WDQIM, hello.
It was just a hot cool little spec.
Because he feels like it.
WDQIM, hello.
Hi Neil.
Because he can be, yes sir.
Got a question for George and I.
Yeah huh.
WDQIM, hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
Are you watching the news of that out there mixed in firefighter?
You guys twin boys, they're in Jose and Jose.
Oh yeah.
That's a little older than you.
Yeah older than Mathusa's great grandfather, okay.
Very very good material sir.
Yeah.
This guy's probably auditioning to be a guest at a blind show.
Let me ask you sir.
What was your worst sports injury?
Obviously what was the hate injury?
I don't think there's any question about that.
Some kind of a hate injury.
Wow.
WDQIM, hello.
QAM.
Hey how about one for the poll?
Yeah.
Anybody here want to couch potatoes, art stomachs and three is a match with Bill Cohen.
No, three is a match.
I remember that.
Wasn't that the one that had like the rocks, the green rocks, pretty weird show.
Nobody's going to know that show.
Never heard of it.
Yeah, like I was saying nobody would even hear of it.
I think I heard a couch potato though but I never saw it.
Couch potatoes if you want to put it on there.
I never heard of such a show.
We know that very jackass is there.
And you know something?
Yes, dude.
What's that guy they got on the morning show who's supposed to be like Feds?
You know, what is that guy who goes out and does the stupid interviews?
Manning.
He talked like that manning.
Well, manning come up with Barry Jackass from the hero.
And I'm going to tell you something.
You would have thought that that was the funniest line in the history of the human race.
So those guys, the 18 guests that they had in the studio were like, go flying and puke.
Ah!
You would have thought that the world was coming to be a very jackass.
Well maybe they never heard that before.
No, it was pretty original.
In fact that manning guy, he really does it for me.
I'll tell you.
He's very funny, manning.
I'm going to see now you got me picking on a morning show and that's not good.
That's better.
Those guys are really trying very hard to be as filthy as they can.
A thousand and 22 votes on the pool and a $64,000 challenge and a $64,000 question don't have any.
And those were two of the two of the biggest of all time.
I'm telling you right now.
I'm going to show you what these people know.
WDQIM, hello.
WDQIM, hola.
Hello.
Yes sir.
And this nail?
Sounds like me, yeah.
Hey, heck.
I have a game show out double there.
What the hell was that?
It was a Nickelodeon.
It was good for the content.
It was what?
It was a good show.
Okay, double there.
We'll put it on there.
I never heard of it.
Was on Nickelodeon.
Was it like a really good show?
Yeah, kids and the parents would compete together and they would do horrible things to the parents.
Well, in a lot of cases probably well deserved to drop them in vatsungu.
What a kayak.
Stabil and fun.
This kayak's versatility means no one has to stay unsure.
Promotion kayak.
And of the win at this kayak equipment goes in supply.
A fabric softener.
Ultra downy over there.
Oh, that's so annoying.
It's a really depressing experience.
Feel the softest smell.
The refreshing sound.
The more than that.
It's virtually free of static.
New downy.
Allison, what do you bid on that kayak?
Bob Barker just turned 172 days.
Let's hear it for old Bob.
Nice going, Bobby.
Now there was one of the tabloids that said he's retiring this June because he's dying or something like that.
He must be dying a slow death or something.
Maybe he's planning it.
In fact, the guy that was waiting for me to announce when my funeral is going to be.
I think Bob Barker on his last show is going to announce where the funeral is going to be and the date to that guy.
He likes to attend celebrity funerals.
Remember that guy?
Oh, yeah.
Somebody QYM.
Hello.
Yes, good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Are the good folks at WQAM still offering the spend a day with the gay DJ?
What are you talking about?
Why'd I like to come down?
Yeah.
Go on down.
I'd like to go down.
It wouldn't be the first time.
WQAM, hello.
How about the show I'm a hot?
Are you hot?
That was him.
That was the show.
Are you hot?
Yes.
First of all, it wouldn't be called a game show.
Nope.
That was good.
It was on ABC and it was on 4 or 5 weeks and I had too many hot looking people on there.
And the answer was absolutely yes.
They were hot.
And they said, oh, we don't want to put that on there.
I mean, I guess technically it's a game show.
I guess technically speaking, it's a game show.
It is?
I don't know.
That was a game show.
Well, we got to be fine with him because he said he wanted to be on a gay show.
759 is wrong.
That's not the right price.
You can just flip.
If you wish, then you'll have $7,000.
I'm not flip this.
He makes me flip my way.
For $110, he don't look that bad.
You know?
A little hard time.
How many times are you ready?
How many are you, Martin?
He looks like he's dead already.
Like I said, for $183.
He looks like he's from the petrified forest.
Like he's in bomb.
I know a game show George liked.
Yeah.
American Gladiators.
Yeah.
Actually, you want to put it on there?
Parts of it.
Sure.
They had American, they had some hot babes with nice asses.
Well, there you go.
What more could you want?
For Rogers' God.
The death of anonical smith is a blessed and messy and very complicated legal battle.
You know what honestly?
I don't know where to start.
This fraternity issue is getting crazy.
We now have someone else stepping up saying, I could be the father.
Michael Jackson.
So now you're claiming that you're the father of anonicals baby.
You two had a relationship.
You told it to sex.
It's a lie.
So how many times did you guys do it?
Eight, nine, yeah.
Right.
I would cry.
So what did you guys do?
You know, everything you've been imagine.
Michael, you cannot convince me that you two hit a grand slam home run.
We have the footage.
We have all the footage.
What?
You two videos?
Okay, roll them.
Okay, this is so hard.
I can't watch this.
My own sperm cells all over the wall, the floor, the ceiling, the starting.
So bad.
I'm going to be sick.
He had the footage.
He had the footage.
Boy, he's really something.
Can't say it on the internet.
146.14 will know to QAM.
So your close personal friend Brandon says, couch potatoes was a short live game show hosted by Mark Summers.
Who also hosted double-deer, slash super-sloppy double-deer, slash family double-deer,
which I love growing up as a kid.
He says it was a show that put Nickelodeon on the map was on for seven years.
Well, you like that for some of our useless trivia?
That's important stuff.
I think Brandon is chicken neck in a previous life.
You know, I mean, I think he's the new chicken neck.
He's the new chicken neck.
He's the new chicken neck.
Gear it up right in about 50 years.
Chicken neck junior.
Chicken neck junior.
For a week, attorney is battling for the remains of aninacol smith that fought with one another, fought off the media.
See that again.
It's in a Sunsental, fought with one another, my ass from the associate press.
How about fought with each other?
Now with one another.
Kind of English is that.
What kind of grammar would that be?
Fought off the media and fought for a chance to speak.
Now their biggest fight is against the clock.
Circuit Judge Larry Sidelin has said a self-imposed Friday morning deadline to wish he would
decision in the case tomorrow, which blows down a way tug-of-war between smith's estranged
mother, Virgie Arthur, who wants to bring her daughter's back home to Texas or body,
and attorney turned boyfriend Howard Case-dure and who wants a burial in the Bahamas month.
Sidelin said he has no time to waste since the county's chief medical examiner warned against
that decision needs to be made soon.
Before her body becomes too decomposed, I for a public viewing, for a public smelling.
You think it'll pass the sniff test?
No, it didn't, uh, what she was alive.
The judge says, I've got a gun to my head.
It's only.
We could only pray.
Sidelin indicated the star testimony yesterday that he wanted to reach a compromise agreement,
but it was unclear what that might be.
But a beat bit of up and they actually already met another right now on CNN.
Shame on them.
There is the queen or so Iran and a new UN report saying that Iran has ignored a deadline
to halt uranium enrichment and also be by a program that is quote,
on an industrial scale.
We'll have analysis and reaction.
Yeah, let's analyze it for while.
It's like when we have election night and they can't just give you the results they have to have
all these people on their analyzing, but a beat bit of a beat bit above all these analysts.
A lot of analysts in the world, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I do.
5.670560, 05.560 in the Verizon Singular Wireless Line, WQAM.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I got a tooth for your pole.
Wow.
Okay.
Wind loser draw.
Yeah, that's not.
And Flamingo forch in the Florida Lottery Game Show.
Yeah, right.
That's a show.
There used to be.
No, it's not.
It's not a show.
It's like, it's a lot of draw.
Get out of here, sir.
But when losing draw was one.
Now, who's the host on when losing draw?
I remember that show.
I don't know.
You don't remember that show?
They used to have to draw.
I remember that thing.
Charles Nelson Rady was on it.
He was on every show.
Who was the host on when losing draw?
You better Google it, okay?
Well, wait 30 seconds for both of Brian Answer.
I can say you better Google it.
I hear me down.
You can say you're using Google it.
No, Chris is Googling it now.
Who is it?
Vicki Lawrence.
The anxious Vicki Lawrence, who was always out with Carol Burnett from the Carol Burnett
show.
The night the lights went down in Joja.
I emailed you a link to what?
Vicki Peter has all the game shows on it.
Do they really?
Yeah, but that's so fun.
If we do that, then we got them all.
Couch potatoes only lasted one season.
Well, Brandon says that something was on seven seasons.
Maybe it was all the various versions.
I don't know.
Quite frankly, don't really care.
I don't remember it.
And don't watch Nickelodeon anyway.
I am trying to find the game show channel on here.
It's on here somewhere.
I know it's on my thing.
Star.
Huh?
BBC.
And there's an TV.
Let's press it from MTV on it.
Let's set it away.
I download Metro.
It's a spot for a metric.
Book channel, Bravo channel.
Let's put the book channel on.
Okay, and learn something.
You're really smart.
Oh, not tonight.
The lights went out in Joja.
What?
Did she sing?
Or what?
Did Vicki Lawrence vancoucete do it?
There's the follow-up channel.
Retro channel.
TSC.
The book channel.
I don't have any idea where the game is.
Maybe somebody I know out there, maybe Brando will do that.
He rules the Rogers cable that I got and finds all these channels for me.
I have no idea where I'm going to find a game show channel.
Because that would be, I mean, we could play the themes.
I got all this here on the flow.
Yeah.
And I've also got some other good stuff too, like, uh...
I like that.
And for variety.
I've got anybody not love this, huh?
This has got schmaltz.
It's over there in the closed lab, baby.
But it's got schmaltz.
Well, not a lot of, not a lot of misploded.
Am I right?
That's a schmaltz-y song.
I love it.
What do we got on the pool?
We're going to make 11 today.
We'll make a 1044.
We'll make 1200 today, I believe, on the pool.
That's my goal.
1200 votes on the pool.
We'll be outstanding.
WDQYM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil, what's up?
We're starting to ensure that these have the married couples on.
And they've asked them, like, they separate them and ask them a question.
Do you have a answer?
No, not newlyweds.
That was the one with, oh, the guy with the hair we used to be on that, who's dead.
Oh, yeah.
I think it wasn't newlyweds.
No, it was not the newlyweds.
You know, they used to have the headphones on.
Oh, gee, he got out of a brain hemorrhage or something like that, was the host.
Oh, what was it?
They used to have the set, everything was green on that show.
The whole set was green.
Wow, one thing I saw a question one time.
The question was, where is the weirdest place you guys had to set?
That's the newlyweds.
I was expecting to hear, like, the email, some kind of looking...
Yeah, I know what you're going to say.
Back home.
I have that clip.
No, but that's not the show I'm talking about.
You're talking about.
Where they would sit there with the headphones.
What the hell was that host name?
He died.
He had a brain hemorrhage.
He was a young guy.
I couldn't stand.
Oh, look.
A bird to a convy.
A convy like that.
For a memory, huh?
Well, I'll give you credit when you can think of the name of the show.
I never do that.
I'm never going to remember the name of the show.
But Birdconvy was the host and they would separate the couples and you'd see they had the headphones on,
be sitting off stage and then the...
What was it?
Tattletails.
Was that it?
Was that Tattletails?
Well, Chris just googled it.
Well, he's got Tattletails, one loser draw, and super password.
Maybe that was Tattletails.
That's got two votes.
Never saw it.
Birdconvy's got two votes.
He's dead.
He's a brain-spluded.
Bernard is about whaling, convy.
No relation.
Who's Bobby Van?
Bobby Van is also dead.
He was a band leader or something, or some kind of a musician.
And Bobby Van was a frequent guest on those kind of shows, on those game shows.
Bobby Van, he was married to Elaine Joyce.
Bokeh Brown says yes, it was Tattletails.
What you're thinking of.
He was married to Elaine Joyce.
Talk about a memory for very unimportant, for grotesquely unimportant things.
My mind needs a serious douche.
WNQIM, hello.
Hey, Tattletails was a show of Birdconvy.
And the win loser draw was a birth and birth production, Birdconvy and Bird Reynolds.
Bird Reynolds was involved in that, and no wonder Dom Delewies was on so much.
Yeah, he was one of the...
He was show off from time to time on screen, but it was...
I always watched the end, it was Birdton Burton, that was Convy, and he was also on Tattletails.
That wasn't a bad show.
No, I love it.
Chiropran was always on there.
Well, nothing's perfect.
Okay, thanks, Falley.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6.
See, everybody knows you don't have to be some kind of an old codger to know these shows.
I think I'd just be like, I'd say 80, 90, something like that, at least maybe a little more than that.
That was wrong with you.
I actually remember win loser draw.
Yeah, that wasn't bad.
It was like a parlor game, you know?
Kind of like Pandamon Quiz was the same thing.
Parlor game.
You know, some of those games, I'm sure.
Dom Delewies, QA, hello.
I know, I know, bro.
Okay, sir.
How about a treasure hunt with Jan Murray?
Get that out of there.
Parlor, how about a very, very late Jan Murray, right?
All right, that's a good one.
Thanks, Falley.
You got a treasure hunt on there, Jan Murray.
He was so Jewish, and he's so dead.
1051 votes on the pool.
Now, you've got to be older, remember, Jan Murray.
I think that that guy, and chicken, I think,
and I were probably the only three people in the world, remember Jan Murray.
Who?
He was very Jewish.
He was a very Jewish host, and he was a comedian, a stand-up guy.
You know, he's a real stand-up guy, so to speak.
How many hit records did he have?
Which now, defunct game show should they bring back to TV?
The Gong Show 207.
I hate this pool 180 down to 17.1%.
The newlywed game on 18.
Match game 106.
Let's make a deal 54.
When Ben stands money 48, that's the one that pisses me off that it's on there.
Because that show just, oh, Claire Rys.
Oh, he is just nauseating.
But dating game 47, it's television, 235.
Constitue, page, concentration 31.
The pyramid is only got...
Factor, the man.
It was the best show of all time.
It's better what you say.
What's my line 28, named that 2 and 27?
The Joker's Wild 26.
I love connection 23.
And of course they did bring the pyramid back with Donnie Osman,
and it went over like Halovah in Siberia.
Yeah, I think.
So you couldn't play along with the pyramid, because you saw what the answer was already.
So what could you do except why?
Yeah, but it was exciting, man.
It was like, it's a sister in the agency.
Come on, come on.
You know, like that.
You didn't, though, you don't care.
Because you were a heart-ass.
I saw off the edge.
Nothing worse, there's...
Everybody likes a little ass, but there's nothing worse than a heart-ass.
Love Connection 23, password 19, card charge 11, truth or consequence is 9.
Remote control 8, press your lock 8, say hello to Century 7.
Hollywood squares is about 5 when loser draw a 5.
That was a good show.
You bet your life for 21, 3, tick-tax, dough 3, high rollers 3, tattletails 2.
American Gladiators 1, Panamon.
Quiz finally got 1.
I'll write.
I must be chicken neck.
Beat the clock 1, 64,000 dollar question finally got 1.
When loser draw a non, double their non-couch potatoes, then the 64,000 dollar challenge
done.
And you'll never guess the name of the host.
It's not the same one you're thinking of.
The name of the host of the 64,000 dollar challenge.
Sunny?
Day?
Not the same one that we know.
Sunny?
Photo?
No.
Fox?
There you go.
Beat it 12 to 1, our R on WQM.
He said he did it.
But Wall has lost one of its most dynamic and influential superstar.
Really dead, really dead.
James Brown died early this morning in Atlanta hospital.
He said he said, playing in a box with a flower by his head.
He's not very, not very good-leave Mary.
Young girl, a wife wants some of this red.
Everyone already said farewell.
There's been over a month and you're starting to smell.
Bunches of people are in your will.
So just why are you lying here still?
Lying in the living room.
You don't say a word.
I'm waiting for you to say, oh, then get on up.
The man I'm twisting, no one will bury me.
No one will bury me.
And I'm starting to rock by the minute.
Did you bury me this minute?
Maybe no one will bury me.
No one will bury me.
When you put me in the ground, fight tomorrow.
And I'm really starting to believe that you think I'm insensible.
I'm dying out of here.
Get right back in there, Jimmy.
It's trouble 1-560 WQM.
Here's a fact.
Look at this.
Looky, looky.
Here comes cookie.
I can't believe it.
It says Uncle Meal, I just wanted to say I love the pool today.
I grew up in the 70s watching all these great games shows from back in the day.
They sure be all the crappy reality shows that were force fed nowadays.
Amen, whoever wrote that.
See that?
Game shows are reality shows.
What's in the label anyway?
I beg your pardon?
It's just another label unscripted television.
It's a show without a script.
1066 votes on the pool.
Not too shabby considering George H.
It liked poison.
Yeah.
That I would die as a result of it.
That's right.
Wait a year, this fact I just got.
Hey, Niela, look what I found on the Clear Channel job listing site.
If anyone wants it, here's the link to a plot.
Go for that job.
Yeah, clear careers.clearchannel.com.
Title, job title, program directed WIOD, WINZ.
The program director is responsible for managing, developing, evaluating, executing, all programming content.
Executing is the operator word.
They killed it.
This person also oversees the brand team for the radio stations.
This is a highly creative and detailed oriented position.
Qualified candidates must be able to motivate, direct and coach high profile error talent, high pro, coach high profile error talent.
That was like you, George, when the Clearist was coaching.
That was right.
And possess extraordinary leadership skills.
It must also bring a passion for the position and excel in all aspects of the news talk format and radio program management.
Although it says news slash talk, new talk, not news talk, new talk format.
Well, job category radio.
That's debatable.
Location Miramar, Florida.
Full time.
Job requirements.
Three years full time, direct responsibility for radio program management.
Maybe Clearist can go over there, work for a team channel.
Do they have a sports station?
Not yet, but they sure are.
It's WIOD and WINZ.
WINZ is a scare America.
What will the media program director for scare America?
We can't have too many sports stations in town can't have too many program directors.
Let me tell you that.
Well, he's either in the shop today.
Clearist is not there today?
No, tomorrow.
Hold.
Or tomorrow because now let's see.
What is that?
He's not doing the baseball, is he?
Oh, that's right.
Kane's basketball ever, genius 10 times a Saturday.
And today's only Thursday.
So he probably had to get ahead start.
He's probably up on the Hershey Highway up there.

What a joke.
And pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.

Hello.
Hey, Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I don't have a computer in front of me so I can't check the poll but is the tell the truth on there?
Yes, it is.
It is okay.
It's 37 votes.
It's doing pretty well considering it was on 100 years ago.
Yeah, I like that show.
It's like you had to read people.
Yeah.
Peace, brother.
Okay, peace out.
Peace on this.
5670560.
pound 560 and the Verizon singular wireless line.
WQAM.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I think everyone's missing bowling for dollars.
Yeah, everybody's missing the big one, yeah.
Click.
There you go.
Is bowling for dollars, remember that?
No.
I mean, I'm sure there was such a thing on there but let's get to the risk.
Well, I'm sure there must have been.
There was championship bowling with Fred Wolff from WXYZ and Detroit.
600 years ago.
You're right.
Nobody under the age of 100 gives a crap about any of this.
But who cares?
WQAM.
Hello.
Let me clear.
WQAM.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil.
I've got a take-back dough with Wiki Martin Del.
Yeah, how about the fact that it's already on there and I can even actually see how many of this is going to be.
Let me say, this is what, listen, I got a good pile of stuff here that I might delve into because this is what we're going to get from now to a client.
It's people calling on the gym and reciting back to us all the stuff that's already on the freaking pole.
See?
That's why that whole pool building crap was the biggest bunch of swells.
Oh, there's Prince Harry.
He's saying they get this in a magnet magnet.
They're going to blow his crap away.
Won't that be sad, huh?
Yeah.
Well, let's put that big gold crown on his helmet.
Maybe they wouldn't be so hard to, you know.
You mean the big target?
You mean the big target?
Yeah.
1777 votes and the Gong Show has got it licked, man.
They got it, they got my hands down, 210.
And the Newlywood game is what it was on the team.
And that's game finally starting to make a little bit of a move with the one away.
Now that we've bitched the audience out about that.
Reminded them that it was funny and filthy.
Filthy.
We're always doing these, you know, jokes.
Yeah, the little, uh, innately.
Wink, wink, wink.
They couldn't possibly do these guys.
WQAM, hello.
QAM.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
How about Johnny Carson's old show?
Who do you trust?
Yeah, that was, uh, unmemorable, right?
Who do you trust?
That's where he got his start.
Yep.
Okay.
Okay.
Yep.
You want to put that on there?
Johnny Carson started on a show called Who Do You Trust?
It was on for about four minutes in order in the world.
So, uh, you can put it on if you want.
You can do whatever the hell you want, you know,
since you're so enchanted with this phone, you came up with this idea anyway.
That's right.
5.670560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
Florida House Republican leaders yesterday unveiled a proposal to radically redesign the state's tax system
in a way that seeks to ease home ownership costs, but could drive a deeper financial way between the poor and the wealthy across Florida.
The proposal was as voters to abolish property taxes on homes and put caps on local government spending in exchange for adopting the nation's property.
The proposal was as high as state-wide sales tax.
Presently, California's got the highest statewide tax at 7.25%, including 1% that goes to local governments.
A proposed constitutional amendment if passed by the legislature would go to voters later this year or at the 2018 election if approved
I would raise Florida statewide sales tax by two and a half points from six to eight and a half percent.
Critics say the changes would hurt the poor who don't own property, who have cheaper housing, could lead to
painful budget cuts by city and county governments.
But advocates call it the most dramatic and several proposals that have released an advance of the 2007 legislative session in which Democrats and Republicans agree will focus on
meeting last year's campaign pledges to slice property taxes.
But a meat bit a moop bit a while. Under the plan voters would be asked to eliminate all property taxes on home state property.
Home state properties are primary residents of which a person is home state exemption.
Taxes will still be paid on vacation or second homes as is, etc. All of this crap.
WDQ I am, hello.
Yes, I have a game show for you.
Yes. Supermarket sweep.
Oh, yeah, that was supposed to also Joe Dodgiella.
You know, I was a little kid back then. It was back in the early 60s. I was pretty young, but I read very vaguely.
It was pretty bad. So I'm pretty sure it must have been him. Okay. If it was bad, he might have been on it and I think he was.
Yeah, you might be right.
Okay. Thanks, pal.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Supermarket sweep with Joe Dodgiella. Get a check. WDQ I am, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
And I have a suggestion for your poll that's not on there.
Yeah. The dating game.
The dating game isn't on there. It's only got 47 votes.
Oh, I got one. How about the GONG show, George?
What a great idea.
You know, what did I take about those days when we were doing the poll building stuff?
And I went and what ever happened to that retard that used to call it.
Poll building's boring. Poll building. What ever happened to him?
Oh, I'm sure he's out there.
Maybe he died or something really. That would be spectacular.
We're special. We can have a big celebration.
And we can invite the guy that wants to go to the celebrity funerals to that guy's wedding.
We have all the dance on his grave.
Poll building's boring. Poll building's boring.
That's the soft-flute effing wave, man. Malcontents. Malcontents. WDQ I am. Hello.
Hi. Well, I haven't been able to get to the computer today.
But what about Groucho and you bet your life?
Yeah. A big finder from my old friend from Palpatown Park called it in.
Okay. Thanks.
Okay. Thanks.
How's it going? Has it got any votes?
You bet your life.
It's good. It's good. Groucho was funny.
It's got six votes already. He called it about an hour ago.
And also what? Filthy.
You bet your life was filthy? Groucho had some lines.
He did, but not on a show. He didn't. Are you crazy?
Well, one of them got the show ended, so I heard.
Can I have something to with shaving?
I just do something with the cigar.
Oh, I see. Well, same difference.
Yeah. WDQ I am. Hello.
Hey, Neil. Yes sir.
Remember treasure hunt?
Yeah. With Daniel. It's on there.
Oh, it is. Yeah.
I met one split second with Tom Kennedy.
Yeah, we don't have that one on there.
And that's because of you.
Yeah. I'm not doing this anymore.
I'm done with these calls.
You take them if you want.
No, thank you.
No, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
They're calling in mostly the same stuff we already got on.
There's about 50 different things on there.
And they're calling in and repeating the same crap over and over and over again.
And that's because these kind of, the guy was right, pulled building blows.
And I didn't want to, I didn't want to build a pool today.
Because no matter what question you ask, the question that they always answer is name something.
That's the only thing they say.
I got one for the poll.
I got one for the poll.
Yeah, we all went for your poll too.
Okay, fly off it.
Yeah, that's why I took that poll.
What? So they could just call up and name something.
Because I don't want to do anyway.
How about name that too?
Oh, that's right.
One note.
Now, you ever named a song in one note?
I would name them a clue.
Yeah, from the clue.
Same thing I can do there.
I can do that.
I'm not quite as dumb as you think I am.
Okay, just because I want to see.
By the way, as your child, I would, you know,
all the old people that supposedly knew all this music.
I blew them all the way too.
Well, I would sit there in the living room and play with all these old collars.
Excellent.
I'm very proud of you.
Look, look where it got you.
That's right.
Making the big bucks.
12 minutes past noon at 5.67.
How many QM times?
It's New Guinea.
Play it, baby.
Ain't great, Blitz.
Every time I have to look at you, I can't come notice.
There's not much peace, Lord.
All that you're capable of running his brain inside his nose.
Nothing else remains of the state of oxygen.
That's why you're always forced to be passionate about the truth.
He bought a Dean to inhale the furthest line.
He was born into money, but he's so kind and dumb.
Without his name, it would be your only spot.
Life of the party is his college day.
It's a bit left in the two cells for a brain and a nasal part again.
That's the reason he's forever weak.
He had the nasal part again.
I bought my ticket and I'm holding my passport tight.
I had a dump at a HMGD and that thing.
I dumped it.
I was at 1217 at 516 WQM.
Bob Michaels in Dallas says 20-year-listener here from Dallas.
Loved your show when I vacationed the keys and I listen to every day online.
Excellent Bob.
Good choice.
I made my forties and I love the pyramid shows.
The highlight for me was the killer music and bells and applause when somebody at the end of each round.
I got a, what the hell is it called?
Something pyramid.
The Donnie Osmond version was lame when somebody won.
Yes, that's correct.
It says you are one of the best talents in the radio business.
How do you like that?
And you are...
That's so rude, me correct.
So I bought Michaels in Dallas.
Thank you Bob.
And that's sweet.
That's sweet.
A connoble walk.
How do you say that?
A connoble walk was constant.
I'm very clearly imagining that.
A connoble walk.
A man says he broke into an apartment with a cavalry sword because he thought he heard a woman being raped.
But the south Ashley was from a pornographic movie that his upstairs neighbor was watching.
Now I feel stupid since James Van Iveren who has been charged in the case.
This really is nothing but a mistake.
According to a criminal complaint, the neighbor told police that Van Iveren pounded on the door and kicked it open without warning February 12th.
Damaging the frame and lock.
Where is she, Van Iveren demanded, thrusting the sword at the neighbor the complaint said.
I wonder which one was the really good swordsman.
Where is she, the neighbor told police Van Iveren became increasingly aggressive.
As he repeated the question and sifting and heard a woman being raped at it, the complaint said that with a sword pointed at him,
the neighbor had led Van Iveren through the apartment, opening closet doors to prove he was alone.
The neighbor later played for police.
The part of the DVD he believed Van Iveren heard downstairs.
Van Iveren 39 of a connoble walk was charged with criminal trespass, criminal damage, and disorderly conduct, all while using a dangerous weapon at a zoo in Courtsmarch 5.
Together they misdemeanor counts, carry a maximum sentence of 33 months in jail.
Good. Keep this yant that away from everybody else.
Let them watch their porn or one piece for crime.
Everybody knows that when you rescue a rape victim, you're supposed to use a Scottish claim or a samurai sword.
Yes, certainly not any of some crappy old sword.
Van Iveren said he heard a woman screaming for help grab the sword, bounded up the stairs, kicked in the apartment door,
and front of the man who lived there.
I intended to hold it behind my back and not that I frozen instead and what happened happened.
He told him a walkie journal sentinel.
Crap happens and it happened.
Contesting his neighbors account Van Iveren said he didn't look anywhere in the apartment except the front room,
and then he never threatened the neighbor with a sword.
I had the sword extended, but that was all he said.
I guarantee that wasn't all that was being extended in that apartment.
Van Iveren lives with his mother in the downstairs apartment,
saying he didn't call police when he heard the noises because he doesn't have a telephone.
Oh, he lives with mommy, doesn't have a telephone.
He said he barely knew the upstairs tenant.
Police he's Van Iveren's sword was he said was a family heirloom.
How do you like that?
How do you like them bananas?
Tinkquant the banana.
Speaking to your favorite judge, Scydlin, there's a whole column here about him.
Yeah, what it is.
What it is?
Judge Larry Scydlin with his distinctive Bronx.
What does that say?
Honk.
Don't that says honk?
If you're horny.
Down to earth approach and plain language is as much a part of the show in Broward Circuit Court as the case he's presiding over.
Scydlin is hearing arguments over the status of the earthly remains of Anacole but a beep but a beep but a beep.
Some legal observers and one of the participants say Scydlin is allowed to proceed to become a circus.
It's a circus.
He bristled and then accusation is in court.
Don't use that term.
It turns me off Scydlin's school to the lawyer.
There's no circus here, my friend.
There's nothing circus.
If you want to say circus, say circus equals attention, which of course is what he wants.
He thrives on it.
It's all he wants.
CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Tuben, sharply criticized Scydlin for allowing lawyers to scramble for days followed by dramatic but marginally relevant testimony.
This may be the most ridiculous legal proceeding I've ever watched, Tuben said.
This judge is one of the least competent judges I've ever seen.
He's letting this thing meander all over creation, most of because he seemed to enjoy being on television.
Court anchor, Court TV anchor, Lisa Bloom says it's all wearing a little thin.
Close to the home of Scydlin also has critics where the hero 22% lawyers responded to the 2004 Broward County bar pull found Scydlin unqualified.
A blog of the Justice Antiquity Association who Broward concludes that Scydlin is among other things a victim of his intercomedian.
Scydlin who was in court couldn't be reached but Dale Ross, the bar with circuits, chief judge, respotted to CNN in an email.
It's not appropriate for me to make comment regarding the facts in a particular case to send out another judge nor his or her legal rulings nor the handling of the case.
With the chatty of sides about his wife, his lunch, his daily run and his New York roots, Scydlin is holding his own against the case's colorful characters.
A sample of Wednesday's crap from the bench, maybe this eccentric judge can get something done he said.
Let's face it, money is the root of all evil am I right? Later on you're going to have me with a box of tissues.
The judge's offbeat folks in his combines the directness of a judge's duty with the touchy-feated common sense of a Dr. Phil. He could be auditioning for his own TV show.
I think he's a combination of Jackie Mason and my yoga instructor said, gloomy wants to talk about the journey and everybody reducing their stress and everybody putting their arms around each other singing, Kumbaya.
Oh, let's do it. Kumbaya.
He's very entertained, there's no question about it she had but it's not about entertainment. In court TV we keep in mind that these are real people here.
Scydlin took jurisdiction and we can go over and the Smith spot, quickly referring to what is that baby and declaring that it belongs to me now, he allowed TV cameras into his chambers then to the courtroom.
He ordered a swab of DNA taking for paternity test and release Smith's world of the media. He said he would hold hearings for as long as it takes to bring the warring sides together.
Each day in court begins with an unusually long statement by Scydlin on Wednesday he began by saying that while the proceedings might not be as important as the war in Iraq, a little girl's life is at stake.
Oh, Jim, glad that he finally admitted it's not quite as important as the war in Iraq.
Almost but not quite.
What is this fax say? It says don't answer the phone. Oh, I don't want any more game shows stuff.
It's more game shows than a fax star.
There's nothing wrong with the pool and the concept of it is that these people want to have 4,000 names of shows that run for about two seconds on here and the question is which now to fun game shows should they bring back.
Well, if the show was a flop the first time when it was on for about two minutes and nobody ever heard of it why would we want to bring it back.
Now the poll question isn't name as many game shows as you can and you're right that's what used to say about the poll when we did the poll building.
Oh, every time name somebody something it doesn't mean that's something or somebody.
Seriously, you callers out there you're so pathetic that there are no words in the language to describe it.
I think pathetic is an insult to all pathetic people in the world. It's an understanding.
Oh, I got one for the poll. You mentioned the wrong show yet. How about let's make a deal.
It's a greeting process. Scytheland continued all of us are suffering and feeling the weight of it.
He or she ever went to bond and be nice.
Legal observers say issues involving the child's custody and paternity area relevant to the central issue before him which is Smith's burial.
Scytheland of building deeply taned for many or caby with a very shiny ball spot which you know he waxes has been on the bench for 29 years.
He presides over family and probate matters. He talks about calling upon well healed pals to provide their private jets to show her witnesses and maybe carry Smith's corpse to his final resting place on a moment's notice.
He has said he likes to put people in his courtroom and he said they can come together on matters of life and death and also he calls one of Arthur's lawyers Texas and speaks repeatedly about preserving the beauty and dignity of Smith's corpse while looking out for the best interest of her infant daughter Danny Lynn.
But it is Scytheland's sheer volume of words that seems to be causing the most discomfort.
I would simply say that this judge is too long-winded and too focused on making speeches about himself Bloom said they do this a monologue about his background it starts to wear thin.
It was wearing thin from day one Bloom said.
Tuban called to hearings a total waste of time deciding which would be fairly straightforward manner who's the next of kin and what were an enculsmist wishes.
The decision assumed emergency late Tuesday when a medical examiner Joshua Perper with a funky head called Scytheland on the bench to say Smith's in bomb corpses began to deteriorate the county more.
It stinks maybe it smells bad. Oh man it's funky it's bad.
But Mr. Stern to give it back to her because there's what we're getting this thing goes on and I hear people saying oh this is just like the OJ thing you know I'm a Michael Jackson trail I don't see any comparison at all.
Do you know anybody who's interested in an all these shenanigans going on of course the reason I read that is because it kills them good time and they're like carrying on 100 hours a day about it.
But anybody who really has an interest in this desperately needs to find a life please crack or please.
Okay how's the poll coming what without it and when the poll is closed by the way I don't care if they call it in if they fax it and if they throw a rock through my window here with a name written around a piece of paper.
But look there's a carrier pigeon and there's a Brittany all ball headed again.
No one in fact there are a bunch of pigeons out there right now pooping all over my patio.
Which now to funk game show should they bring back to the TV the goal show to 16 I hate this poll 189 16.9%.
We finally got that under 17.
Nubi Web Game 121 match game 111 after that small potatoes now not reading that list of 600 shows.
Congratulations man and say cheese.
Are you a former astronaut and feeling depressed irritable irrational and vengeful.
Are you having difficulty adjusting from the highs of orbit to the lows of everyday life.
Then you may be suffering from PISSD post initial space shuttle event disorder.
The warning signs of PISSD include wearing disguises rubber hose and plastic bag collecting a sudden fondness for knives and pepper spray and the desire to take long car rides simmering in your own extratory fluids.
If you suffer from any or all of these symptoms you're not alone literally ones of former astronauts suffer from PISSD post initial space shuttle event disorder.
But there is hope at the Lisa no accessor for the bat crap insane caller visit to get the help you need because no one wants to see you go through life being PISSD.
Except for the 24 hour news networks 1231 29 to 1 and 560 W.D. Q.I.M.
Let's take a whole bunch of calls. What are you saying?
No but as soon as they say that they want to add one to the poll you have to say the word game or show or poll they're gone.
560.560 I don't want any more we got 8 million game shows on there already okay can you deal with them you understand including some of us even remember W.D. Q.I.M. Hello.
Yes sir 560. What did I just say sir I said W.D. Q.I.M. is that 560? I'm sorry sir I had the radio down and I got one for your poll.
Yeah okay good.
I love it. I got one for your poll. Why you're really novelty man how unusual I got one I got one for you to thank fat one W.D. Q.I.M. Hello.
Hey Neil is it true that no punches are pulled on W.D. Q.I.M. Hello. Who did more for the game show?
W.D. Q.I.M. Wow okay like I said she was a bad idea in the first place it was on your idea I'm sorry I don't know who that was it was my idea it was a bad idea not not the poll there's nothing wrong with the poll but these people are just trying to prove that you're right I guess it's not the poll first it's just then it's just then they have a problem
but it's called life they have a serious life problem.
By the way Chris how's your Myspace thing coming still screw up? Oh yeah. Oh now that you mentioned it during that last break I want to respond to somebody that had sent me something.
Yeah and it didn't work. Got that same error message so a lot of people are having problems today.
In other words it's like a disease that's spreading and growing maybe the disease is called Myspace ineptness and it's probably a good idea to stick your email your high and your Yahoo your outlook whatever you use is a nice thing like something like the same thing.
It's a nice thing but as far as the communication tool it's not good. So in other words it's like growing exponentially now like everybody's Myspace thing is getting all screwed up.
Yeah well apparently there's some virus that's going around with people are hacking into your pictures and stuff.
What are you talking about? People are using the pictures that you post on your page. Yeah they're hacking into your account through them somehow.
And doing what? Whatever they wish. Well how does that prevent them from receiving and sending messages? I mean you know being is technically inept design what they'll do I know about that.
I guess the viruses are you know slowing down the Myspace so everything is getting clogged up and it's just you know as if my space wasn't bad enough it's making it even three times worse.
Does that answer your question George whatever he just said? Yeah the question of slowing it down it's a question that it's interrupted the communication you can't remember.
Myspace my face cannot pass everything. Yeah so you click on an email it's processing it to go to that email.
You reply to the email it's processing it so you can reply to it with all the hacking that's all the virus.
Why can't you open it? Why can't you open it? The system the Myspace servers are just being so overloaded it can't really handle your request so you get an error.
Well screw them. Heart. Your mama. Well if that's the case how come I can send to certain people and other people I can't explain?
Huh? Because it's my space. When you're steering wheel breaks how come it turns right and not left. That's why it's called it's broken.
What did I tell you a long time ago my space blows over it's okay for what it was and I'm very grateful for what it ever did but at least some part of it anyway.
But the bottom line is it's got issues inadequate. It's got issues and I think I've been very lucky let's see what has it been.
And when did he put that thing on October? He months I guess. And I started like paying attention with December so I see December.
Like only about three months maybe four months and I haven't had like except for that day that you know who blocked us and gave us a bunch of crap.
Other than that. Well that was Ethan that's right excuse me was Ethan it wasn't the moon though what's the name crazy person.
A group of businessmen in the northern Mexican city of Chihuahua broke a tasty record.
This past week making a hunk of meat on the skewer begin up to serve 24,000 tacos.
In the Friday event of the Taco Ton the meat for a pastured taco a variety of the Mexican dish that consisted pork swashed on a mistake weighed 3.9 tons and was 13 feet high.
Officials from the Guinness Book of World records recognize the hunk of meat as the world's largest skewer of kebab meat.
Notimex reported that's some hunk of meat man 13 point. What is it 3.9 tons? That's a sizeable hunk of meat.
Person to the vast snack were sold with the drink for a dollar a piece of hungry spectators to allow a business man finance the megataco and gave proceeds from sales to a home for abandoned children.
Wasn't that sweet huh? That lovely I got one for the pool by the way.
Seriously these people these people are just impossible there's just no help for them and they're like a bunch of disobedient children no matter what you tell them I think a lot of need a good spanking is what they need.
I'll go get the cricket bat how about ding dong school with Francis Horowitz let's bring that back she can get the paddle out and paddle all the one thing she's spanking anybody and show but a lot of kids should have gotten a good spanking.
We have it going on here all the time. Yeah that's what I'm hearing that's what I'm always always doing.
I was spanking for guilty maybe that's why guilty is the way he is now but I doubted.
I think he was that way from the day he walked in the building.
Here's a fact from a zap of bob it's a parenthesis clueless the best shows George does about those religious fakers.
Did I tell you that yesterday that's what you said if he thinks those shows are hard to listen to just try to listen to the mad dogs show with five minutes of show an intimate commercial break not to mention the East St.
and begins and ends with a live spot masturbating as part of the show time as Frank's apple said there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over wow how do you like that.
I never knew by Frank's apple said that did you know there's a big difference you know I figure what it isn't that we can't play you always tell me we should play the whole thing but then again you have to talk about
yeah well that's a besides the point and if you're going to take me in and take care of me after I'm out on the street then you know maybe that I don't think I want to live in the middle of all that.
Hey I'll do everything except change your diapers all right I mean I have my wife.
You've got a very heavy duty household there and I think I can have a lot of you.
We have 1140 votes on the phone today.
We have another crispy of us that fantastically excellent technological explanation of why my space is so screwed up and white is a piece of turd and you understood none of it.
I understand then think you were saying you know what you're telling it's you're saying it's slowing everything down correct because it's got a virus in it.
The virus just making my space do even more governs the work.
Yeah wow.
People like a red.
How do they get that other the my space people that do that their business.
Maybe they'll take support people.
Oh they're actually lunch man for a few months.
Think of it this way.
How easy would it for you to be doing this talk show right now while eating a peanut butter sandwich.
You could do it.
I've done a lot of shows eating lots of food man even more without the glass of milk.
I'm with a glass of milk without the glass of milk.
Do you think that I drink milk are you a crazy person or what I knew that you're a fact guy but I'm drinking milk with my peanut butter sandwich.
But probably on one of your own and probably on one bread that kills bodies eight ways too.
That paste to you a white wonder bread it's like it's like eating cardboard.
Candy.
Oh fat.
So anyway when do we get the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
I guess you know who's bringing those for the big event.
Barry Jackass.
Oh that's right.
If you could have heard the good foing that was going on when what's his name what's his name again.
Mani.
Mani when mani came up Barry Jackass when he came up with that you would have thought it was the greatest line in history of the biggest act.
So you know what I went to the biggest act.
That's when he came up with that you would have thought it was the greatest line in history of the biggest act.
The biggest act.
You Roger.
I'm giving you a little chance to go to the next game.
No problem.
Hey, get gay.
GAY!
GAY!
Welcome to the gay games.
I love those running shoes.
Oh my god where did you get those?
We have Oodles of events like the hundred meter brand and the synchronized
assay. I hope I win a gold medal. It's fun to access the rise.
Bloodscaled girls with everything you're killing. We just adore the gay games.
Check out our giant torture. It's not the only thing for him.
45 and 5 what he say.
But that's what I thought he said. The Bush administration expected
to announce today that it will exempt children from the new rules of
a required people to show past sports when in the US and land or
sea borders. All those little kid terrorists baby. That's what it's
going to allow in now. Well, they got bombs in them. The new past
board requirements are expected to take effect as soon as January
2008. But I'll be expected announcement. Children age 15 or younger
with parental consent will be allowed across the borders at land and sea
entry points with a certified copy of their birth certificate rather than
past sports. Children age 16 through 18 traveling with school religious
cultural athletic groups. Under what else the division will also be allowed to
travel only with their birth certificates. The details were described by
Department of Homeland Security official requested and then maybe because he
announced the management media. That's good. So there won't be any 14-year-old
terrorists. We know that they don't have those like in the middle east, right?
Right. Any 14-year-old suicide bombers? No problem.
Now we're not going to do any more about the end of the call study. Are you sure?
About the story study? There's one. What do you know? It never ends. It never ends.
Just like on your TV said, the wire services it just never ends.
And on the call summits x-boy friend testified today that he attempted to
curb the Starlet's drug use as the judge referred to the long-term
campaign in Howard case during his maybe and a neighbor. You know, this judge
isn't he's not presiding over a trial. He's doing a running commentary. Right.
Circuit Judge Laurie Sardland began the sixth day of a hearing to the
side of the famous miss body with a long via tribe saying the centerful
lack to strong support system and speculated that a relationship with a
strange mother, Virgy Arthur and X-Borff and Larry Birkhead,
stoward because of overuse of prescription drugs. We have Stern. Is he a bad guy?
Or is he a fellow that has some form of a lover? We don't know Sardland said.
Whatever relationship he had with her, he would be called maybe in a neighbor.
Stern's attorney, Krista Barth, rose an objection but Sardland continued
him a promise to be a long day of testimony. Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap,
they had just grandling on. The judge set a self-imposed deadline to rule by
tomorrow so dismissing bomb body won't he compose too much for a public viewing?
Oh, that would be really nasty for noses where her ass is supposed to be.
Arthur wants to bring Smith home to her native Texas and Attorney
Trinboyfriend Stern wants a burial in the Bahamas where her son Daniel
died in a front drunk related causes last year. What a shame that was.
Birkhead testified that, I mean, if he would have been really, really ugly,
I'd say, well, I don't know who cares, you know? That's just the way the world is,
you know? If you're ugly and you die, nobody really cares.
But if once upon a time you were kind of like, you know, not too bad,
if he, oh, gee, what a shame. Birkhead testified that when he visited the Bahamas
homelessmith in Stern's shared last year, he became increasingly concerned about her medicine use.
Medicine. They kept bringing more and more drugs in the house he had,
saying that Stern told him that Smith needed the prescriptions to live.
Sounds like a female Elvis to me. Maybe that'll take her body up to Graceland, wouldn't that be good?
Graceland? Now that it takes her up to Graceland, man, and slas-slap her down with a bunch of lard.
Like a lard ass. He actually was a lard ass much of her life.
So far, the testimony has been peppered with details of Smith's sensualy, Aesons.
And the deal. Oh, well, he is a little lonesome. Let's bring some company for Elvis.
And the deal is allegedly being pursued to profit. You know I was nailed at right on the-
and that's why I potted it down and he stopped it just to make me look bad.
Are you lost? See that?
Arthur was hammered yesterday with questions about any compensation she has or would receive from
news organizations for access to interviews or footage after deaths of her daughter and grandson.
She frequently said no to questions about arrangements with specific media outlets and side-step
other questions or things she'd understand. And Stern and Birkhead denied getting paid.
Certainly nobody would exploit the death of a superstar like Anne and Nicole by trying to,
you know, make some kind of financial gain. Would they?
A couple from Washington State faced his charges after auto-work has found more than 100.
And by the way, you know, Josh was in it this morning, Josh Cordis.
Yeah. And I don't want to like play Butch Boss with him or something, but he did this to you one day.
And I know I sent him more than five stories yesterday. It was with by Wednesday,
but I know damn well. I sent him more than five stories. And that's what we got on the website.
I think to make up for it, I'm going to send him about 40 today. Maybe 50, 50.
While the Chris Goh spank him or flogged him.
Yes, spank him with some Chris Goh case.
Here.
You should be able to bring, bring Duffin. She'll take care of it.
Nothing.
Got a lot of practice with the Chris Goh event.
A couple from Washington State faced his charges after auto-work has found more than 150 pounds
of marijuana in their pickups, jury rig, gas tank, and loaded the police.
The 48-year-old man in 62-year-old woman were being held in the Ramsey County
Jail and suspicion of possession of a controlled substance. They told investigators they were
driving from Yakima, Washington to Chicago. According to Kent Bailey, acting agent in charge of
the US DEA's Twin Cities office, their bad luck is their vehicle had some fuel problems,
and they ended up taking it to a minus shop.
Bailey be saying.
Wonder why I said he'll problem.
He said the fuel problems had been caused by some marijuana getting loose in the tank.
That's not what you hide it.
How do you know?
Also, the tank couldn't hold much gas, so the pair might have had a fuel up every 100 miles or so.
At the auto shop on the east side where the couple stopped Monday,
mechanic Daniel Reese noted the truck had a modified gas tank with fresh weld marks.
When the two were told the tank needed to be replaced, they were adamant that the repair
wasn't needed, Bailey said. Eventually, they re-lended with insisted that the pickups old tank be saved.
Workers who became suspicious and called police found that the gas tank had been converted into
two compartments, one contained fuel, while the other had 157 pounds of marijuana worth about
157 grand. That comes out to sounds like a thousand bucks a pound to me.
Boy, you're not paying that much, are you?
No, no.
Bailey quitted a Reese for recognizing something was suspicious.
That's exactly what we need because we didn't have enough law enforcement to cover every corner.
He said it was absolutely sharp thinking.
Absolutely.
Using the phone number the door left with might has investigators tracked them to the
Hastings Inn and the rest of them. They found 700,000 Mexican pesos equivalent to about 64 grand.
Do not go to Mexico. Let me tell you that again.
A little warning from me. Do not go on a cruise. Do not go to Mexico. All of these things.
Forget about it. Don't make a bad mistake. No waste your hard earned money with a bunch of
foolishness. Speaking of foolishness, here's that poll.
And I'm so delighted that I took this.
1150, and by the way, with all that controversy about caspitators, which was on a sure time,
it was the other one it was on seven years. Branding got very hostile about that fact that
it got caught up ripped him and asked. 1158 on the poll. We'll make 1200 easy. I know what
you're worried about. Everything is just fine. Fine is wine. You get all panicky just because
the mice face things all screwed up. Why can't you be? Why can't you be kind and collected like
me for Christ's sake? Exactly. Because I'm not on drugs right now.
Oh, maybe I think maybe I ought to start.
See, why do these things happen to me? Why is it that the timing of these things,
not that it would ever be a good time? Just look at these things happen. I have bad luck.
Like yesterday, it would bind with bad machines, man. Bad luck.
And then last night in the lotto, the two people won seven million piece for the $14 million
or $649 lotto. I won 15 bucks. Man. Which now-defun game show should they bring back to TV? That's
the poll question. We've got a lot of 158 votes. The gong show wins this one. Hands down your
pantaloonies, man. 222. I hate this poll. 193 down to 8.12.16.6%. That's not too bad,
considering we started around 18. The newlywed game on 26 match game on 13. And then it's way
down. Those are the top ones. Wait on let's make a deal. 57. When Ben stands money, 53.
Fah. The dating game 50 to tell the true 37. Concentration, 33. Not a match and the board goes back.
Didn't you like the way that those things turn those squares? You know, and I hate actually.
It was pretty neat. What's my line 32? Pyramid 31, which includes the $25,000 pyramid.
The $50,000 and the $100,000 pyramid. And Bill Cohen, who you noticed, didn't like wander around
very much during all those shows. I always thought that he had a wooden leg. Where did I read that?
It was not correct. He had the polio as a child. And he was a crippled. He had the wooden
unit. He was handicapped. The cripple sounds really bad, isn't it? Handy crap.
What's my line 32? Pyramid 31. The Joker's Wild has got-
Joker. Joker. He was the worst game show host of all time, Jack. He was the host of a show,
a kid show. When I was a little kid. And the name of the show was Winky Dink and you.
Now, can you imagine if they tried to put a show on television today named Winky Dink and you,
they'd get right out of town on a railman. The religious nuts would be just all over them like
Stink on Joyce. Winky Dink, my ass. Anyway, in that first one. Yes, had a set in the box cap from
some kind of cereal or some crap, which of course I did. And you got a plastic screen that you
put over the TV screen. Well, she had a plastic and it had like blue tinting on the top for the sky.
And like pink tinting in the middle like for, you know, people, uh, what I would. And then,
yeah, right. And then the bottom was a green like for grass. And what we did was you took the
piece of plastic and you just smeared it over the TV screen. And then you were like a member of
Winky Dink. Why are you playing that? Do you know the name of it?
The draw two. They baby Cortez. Happy organ? No. Rinky Dink. Oh, Rinky Dink.
I know the song. Rinky Dink. I'm gonna use a baby. Winky Dink. Name that 2 and 28 Love Connection 24,
password 21, card charts 12, truth of consequences 12, press your luck 10, you bet your life 8, Hollywood
squares, uh, eight, several of the century eight American gladiators. Everyone lose a draw.
Seven 21s got four. Tick that go four beat the clock three. It's $64,000 question three. High
rollers three. Supermarket sweep two double there two. Taddle Pales two. Treasure out one with
late Jan Murray's dead. Panama and quiz one. $64,000 challenge with sunny fox. No, not that one. One.
And no votes for who do you trust. When will Zodra or couch potatoes like that? Very jackass style.
It's got the real. And when I'm up in Belkettiga slapping all the women with painted lips around the
bowl. I listen to the new Rogers one to two. I mean I listen to the new Rogers. They're in balance
one to two hours. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Re-intestinal good end. I'm in thick hell of God. Who shows that? Are the gifts I miss that
they're back to making gate shows again. Oh my god.
No.
Secret is because, you don't say, surface contract three.
He needs a home.
He's with us, locked into this.
Asked for a word, he relived once upon a mile.
Now, match me, tell the truth, pray to the bank,
They've got to love you, they don't know what you're doing.
What you call the money is the same.
He said, he said, come and tell us never mind,
That your life there was very fightin' in.
How is mud and not to make you come out here?
And feel comin' if it wasn't for them, they wouldn't be
They can do it, chose again.
Don't hesitate, don't hesitate,
They'll be more than they'll ever be,
They'll be more than they'll ever be.
You can't really have to get Dorothy Kogall in there,
He's obsessed with Dorothy Kogall.
Did you ever see her?
She made it a point.
She had no chin and she also had an interview schedule
with Jack Ruby.
And then what happened?
And then she died.
Oh, she died?
Yeah.
Not for you.
Well, he died of cancer.
I guess that was really.
He went to the feeling fine one night.
And then the next day he woke up with cancer when he died.
Like in about five minutes.
But yeah, she was supposed to have this big interview.
He was going to spill all the beans about what was the whole Lee Harvey Oswald thing
and the JFK assassination.
And she died mysteriously.
So I'm sure the chicken echo will spend hours, you know, just ask him about Dorothy Kilgale.
I don't have to.
Well, he still talks about it.
It's a whole multimedia presentation when the main comes up.
Oh, well, they were back back in the day back in the out.
I don't know the 50s, 60s, maybe early 70s.
Well, I guess through the 70s, there were some people who were professional game show panelists.
Yeah, like Betty White and Charles Nelson Riley.
And who else?
Paul.
Paul.
And Paul Ed was just in Hollywood Square.
Sorry, he was on a bunch of other ones.
But there were several.
They were like professional panelists on every damn game show.
Tattletails was a very bad show, by the way.
I'm glad I couldn't remember the name, but the one with the word comedy.
It was a bad show.
Don't remember it.
Horrible.
And the husband and wife were beyond.
And they would alternate.
And the wives would be sitting on the panel.
And they would have little TV screens in front of them.
And you'd show the husband who was off stage with a bunch of headphones on.
So we could, you know, they would turn the audio off or turn it on.
So we couldn't hear her answer, et cetera, and so on.
That kind of crap.
5.670560.
This is the intelligentsia, our baby, between now and two o'clock.
You'll see.
Nobody's going to be suggesting any more for the poll.
Because if you do, it's going to be your last suggestion.
5.670560 and Palm 560.
I'm even rising in singular wireless line.
How about that drain weight, huh, Chris?
Oh, it's very bad.
That's bad.
I mean, what's that guy to do with?
He's doing it.
I don't know what it was.
They're done.
If he's out for any extent of time, I'll ask you if I care.
I was only saying it facetiously.
Now you want to give me a serious answer about that.
I'm trying to get us out of the sportscaster up.
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
2am, hello.
Robert, cue Lewis.
Right.
I remember right.
There was another one.
And Gary Moore.
Yeah.
Anyways, now what I called about.
The movie I was watching last night, I thought about it.
Because one of your guys is it.
And I called it to give you a movie spy review.
That is Flyboys, which James Franco.
Oh, I love James Franco sometimes.
Sometimes.
It's pretty good in this.
It's got a lot of good, in a non-game way.
It's got a lot of good looking guys.
Yeah.
Anyway, it's setting a lot of the address to go World War I.
Pretty good.
And the other one was infamous, as opposed to Capote.
I've seen both and I liked him from a way.
Well, it sounds too gay for me.
Okay, thanks for that, Pally.
And to watch out for that truck.
I'm going to go back all.
Flyboys.
That's all.
And it's got some pretty faces, like the guy said, but yeah.
As a movie, it blew.
Well, you know, the thing with James Franco is he's, I don't know how to, like a comedian.
Not a comedian, but a comedian.
You didn't do a bad job.
It didn't do the movie.
The movie didn't suck because of him.
I mean, I don't want to suggest because what do I know about him?
You know, it goes on these bizarre diets.
It's a times it gets very anorexic looking.
And then there are other times when he looks very normal.
Like in Tristan and Zolt, he looked fine in there.
And he was running around naked and half the movie on the beach with what's your name.
But he looked fine.
But like in Spider-Man, I thought he looked pretty gaunt.
You know, he looked, well, what do you want?
I think I'm going to watch those again.
I really, I really enjoyed that.
They were going to look forward to number three.
And then three coming out this summer.
WDQ-AM, hello.
I'm out of town.
Here's the long distance.
WDQ-AM, hello.
How are you doing today, Neil?
Excellent.
I have five two things.
I don't hear anyone complaining about this sales chance increase with the property tax
is being...
Yeah, because they don't know that much about it yet.
And they haven't done the math yet.
And they haven't figured out whether it's going to cost them a fortune or whether in a long one it's going to save it.
I haven't really put my pencil to my ass on it.
Okay. And the second thing, I was watching CNN in the morning yesterday.
In Mexico, they have a theme ride where you get to be a...
I think you leave those immigrants and get to feel what they feel like.
They get chased by people shooting in the air.
Right. Good.
Good conditioning.
I like it.
If they're shooting in the air, they're getting this off.
They're trying to get their nails in.
But it's for real.
All right. We have what I say.
Okay. Thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
He's got a parrot on his shoulder back here.
Maybe a Mexican parrot.
We think it's on his shoulder.
566-50560, Palm 560 in the Verizon Singular Wireless Line.
We got the Mad Dog at 2 of the power hour with Hank and the Mad Dog together 4 to 5.
Humpersolo 5 to 7 has got an asterisk on the schedule.
I have no idea what that means.
That means that there was a change from the previous schedule that was put out,
which you actually didn't see because that schedule was given to us twice in one day.
I see. Ask me if I care.
Then we got Pants of Preview at 7, 7, 30, and so Pants is hosting the Episper Penguins.
Sydney Crosby of Gany Melkin, the most exciting team in the NHL, I would say.
Pretty damn entertaining.
I'd be there if I was you.
And of course most of you won't.
And then after the hockey game in Scheme, I would just see Adler,
who takes it all much too seriously, by the way.
Correct.
Am I right?
Yep. Good guy, but yeah, he gets a little...
He's a very good guy, but he takes it all very seriously.
Maybe that's why he works for Q and maybe because...
What's his name?
Whatever the hell his name is.
Clarence found him on a street corner somewhere reading racing forms or something.
He takes it all very, very serious.
Well, Jesse graduated from UM.
Oh, well, I explained it.
QAM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you?
Pretty good.
Hey, I have a comment about the game shows.
Yes sir.
What about it?
Yes sir.
And game shows that's on TV today.
What is it?
What about the most idiotic and stupid game shows that's actually on TV today?
What about it?
Like, you'll know the ill or one horse is a hundred.
You know, your poll is about good game shows that people remember from the old days.
Well, no, but the poll, the poll question is, which now-deafunk game shows should they bring back to TV show?
But something that's on now, how can it be now-deafunked and how can they bring it back when it hasn't gone away yet?
No, no, I'm not an home on a computer, so I didn't know what the poll was.
That's what I thought was the most idiotic and stupid game shows that are on these days are just crap.
They're just crap.
They're just crap.
They're just crap.
Right, they're just like the sitcoms that are on today.
They're also just crap.
Exactly.
Hey man, have a good day.
Thanks a lot.
I'm back to you.
Okay.
When you agree that that one word sums up most of what's-oh, don't tell me we have a MySpace.
It doesn't work.
My close personal friend says it doesn't work.
I can't even open the inbox and see what message I have.
It's to find sending messages until they're-
They're having issues.
It's find sending messages here until they're back up.
Do you understand what that means?
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
They're screwed up today and for the first time.
No, but it says it's find sending messages here until they're back up.
All out of MySpace?
No, this is a text message.
Well, that's what he's saying.
It's find send him messages through the text message until MySpace is back up.
Right.
And that's why I told him I'll communicate on Hotmail and not on here.
See, it's one thing.
Let me say this to you, okay?
And thank the Lord.
Because I probably shouldn't say this on the ear, but I will anyway.
I'm sure it's crossed his mind.
But you know how insecure I am.
That's the understatement of the century.
And you meet somebody online on MySpace, for example,
which is a very unreliable place to be meeting and greeting.
I mean, for me, it's worked fine.
I, like you said, I just have been very lucky.
I had very little problem.
No, it's fine for meeting and greeting.
It's not fine for a continuous meeting.
But if you want to get in contact with somebody and you don't want to, you know,
you've got some reason to be in touch and you don't have the regular email or phone or whatever
or way to text message them, you're a screwed man.
Now, can you imagine if that was the only contact at this particular point in time?
I would have been like that.
I would have been like ready to jump off the abelkin at it.
Oh, geez, here it is because I'm a maniac.
Help me!
And I see this.
And I ask you, right, I see these things and I want it because look,
what am I supposed to know about this?
I mean, a 64-year-old queen on MySpace.
I mean, come on, okay?
With 1217 friends, including a couple of good ones and one really, very, very, very, very good one.
I mean, you know, what is that?
So the fact that I'm under in the first place at all is a major miracle,
but the idea that I'm supposed to be able to relate to the technical scripts of the course,
everybody has been telling me and warning me and because I've been lucky, I said,
ah, yeah, you people are so cynical.
But I'm wrong.
Everybody's been telling me that it's a, he's a crap, MySpace.
And that works whenever it feels like that's right.
And then when we have these brain parts like this, God only knows when hell is going to come back.
And their attitude is, hey, it's a free service, quick for bitching.
And how do you think I felt this morning when I sent such an important, such a meaningless,
listen, nothing that I send is all that important, okay?
It wasn't, it was no thing, it was no big deal.
But you send somebody something and then you realize they can't read it,
you can't open it anymore.
And I'm like, well, well, well, well, you know, in fact, I think I said here for an hour this morning,
going, oh, what, oh, what, oh, what, oh, what, oh, what, oh, what, oh, what,
just like that.
Tonight, by an hour and a half, and George kept panting me on the head saying,
just relax, calm down, it's MySpace, I just would have just relaxed.
Should I have a volume?
Message that explains it right here.
It doesn't work at least for me.
I can't even open the inbox and see what message I have and or anything.
It's fine sending messages on here until they're back up.
So in other words, it looks like the message is sent,
but then when it comes back up again and you try to like open it, you can't do it.
Yeah, that's the deal.
So there, it's not with everybody.
I mean, I can send them with certain people and go through and like with you.
Correct.
But with the other one, I want to send you a message for it.
I'm going to tell you something.
I'm right here, you're right here.
No, then I'm going to send you a message.
I've got a message for you, mister.
Beware of exploding balls.
What the hell on access all it was?
The death of Anna Nicole Smith.
You know what?
Honestly, this paternity issue is crazy.
We now have someone else stepping up saying, I could be the father.
I've got a surprise for you.
Homer, let me guess.
You dated Anna Nicole.
You pretty lady.
Oh.
And you guys got freaky deaky?
Something very close exactly along those lines.
And I knocked her up.
We're healing.
Damn right.
How is that possible?
Do I have to draw you a diagram?
Homer, you're a cartoon character.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't for Fest, you're no at all.
And cartoon characters cannot knock off humans.
Oh crap, I forgot.
I don't want to be in here.
Okay, what do you think?
At 560 WDQM, 118.
Here's the fact says, what about Kitty Carlisle?
As a perpetual game show panelist.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, she was on a Hots my line and to tell the truth.
And she was on every damn show.
Kitty Carlisle.
I have no idea what else she did.
Where else she came from.
Betty White.
Yelp.
Vicki Lawrence.
Carol Burnett.
She was on a password lock.
Carol Burnett.
A top army general blamed a breakdown of leadership for poor living conditions of wounded soldiers
at the U.S. Army's renowned Walver Read Medical Center.
But General Richard Cody, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army said, no one has been relieved
of command or disciplined since the problems were exposed over the weekend by the Washington
Post.
Clearly, we've had a breakdown of leadership and bureaucratic medical and contractual
processes, dog down a speedy solution to these problems, Cody said, at a Pentagon
news conference.
The Post said, convalescing soldiers in one army building were living in rooms with
mold-covered walls, holes in the ceiling, and infestations of rodents and cockroaches.
The series set off a fewer with the White House expressing shock and lawmakers' demanding
action.
I thought we already had a fewer in the White House.
What a little mustache.
Cody said he inspected building 18 where 76 service members are housed and found that
their room is arranged from being very good to not being good, not good.
Kind of like this poll today, not good.
Not for the poll, not good, but just the phone response, not good, embarrassing.
They were well furnished, he said, but the upkeep of the infrastructure, the walls and stuff
wasn't the speedy, he said.
The general attributed the lives and standards to officers who were inexperienced and too
low-ranking for the job they be having.
He said appropriate actions have been taken, but no one has been relieved of command or fired.
We will do the right thing across the board as we continue to assess where ledger failure
and breakdowns were.
He said, Cody said the army also is reviewing its procedures for handling wounded soldiers
and their families following complaints of bureaucratic red tape.
They're really taking good care of our soldiers, I'll tell you.
The ones who are still alive and the ones who still have enough body parts to put back together again.
I think I'm having some issues, by the way.
What?
You're actually...
I think I'm having some of my own internet issues, I could be wrong.
Maybe the internet is going to just collapse today.
See end of the world.
You think that's it?
Yeah, see I'm on my hot mail and I'm signing my password to go into it and it says it's incorrect.
Well I know it's not incorrect.
What the hell is that all about?
How's that possible?
See what I'm saying?
Everything is all bald up, bald screwed up.
How the hell is that possible?
Get out, Gorker, on the internet all.
I mean is it possible somebody can...
a little with you change your password or something?
I'm gonna be impossible.
But that's not likely.
Well then how come it won't go through?
Issues, problems, glitches, bugs, viruses, variables, sunspots, the moon and the raindrops.
Oh man, there is something really going on here man.
Something really strange going on.
Hot mail, not mail, my space, your space.
Wow, just enough to drive you absolutely after what.
I'm not gonna worry about this second, you know.
56050560, pound 560 and they've arrived in the singular wireless line.
WQAM, hello.
How you doing?
WQAM, hello.
Hey Neil, don't be scared.
Have your animal spayed or neutered?
Well that was Bob Barker, Jr. Jr.
WQAM, hello.
Hey Neil.
Yeah.
This is not a poll suggestion but a challenge.
I would like to see them try to bring back name that tune with all the twill we got on the air today.
What is that man?
What is that name?
Well it's a day, the music.
I don't think anybody would get in one of them right with the beat that's coming out.
Well I see what you're saying.
We're gonna bet with the crap that passes from music today.
Yeah, that's an apropos comment.
I would agree with that.
Name this hip hop tune right.
Good point.
See the guy actually had something to say.
Oh that's here that I get a ricky thing by day baby Cortez.
How about the happy organ or the happy rinky thing?
How are we doing on a poll?
We're gonna make what was our what we're trying to get to?
Five votes?
1187.
Oh yeah we got 1200 like no problem.
Yeah that thing with my hot male.
I don't want to start getting people nervous and suspicious about what's going on here.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah well you won't.
And of course the fact that Chris, now you know let's see you're on my space.
Is that the one you're looking at and you're my space thing?
Not right now.
No but I mean you were before.
Yeah before yeah.
But it's unconnected.
Well you know.
Whatever it is.
Welcome to the internet.
I'm just gonna do this one more time.
Okay play more Dave baby Cortez.
And this is Chris.
Candy shot.
Yeah we'll go through now.
Password's in close.
But wrong.
Password is in correct.
I know it's in the sense.
Right?
I don't know whatever.
In the clothes.
I have to sit in the clothes.
Here you go you're candy shot.
Oh well that takes care of that I guess.
That's not working even now.
Now how the hell is all this happening?
I don't want to get people nervous or anything like that.
But when all of a sudden you're hot male which has been working fine all morning long.
And you can't get through it and it says the password's in correct.
That's very funny.
Somebody has been on your podcasting with the whole internet it would seem to me.
Not not just me.
Huh?
Right?
Is it possible?
Yes.
It's not working.
No seriously in one way.
How can anybody do that?
Are you kidding me?
You know I'm not kidding you.
You work with equipment every day.
Yes.
On any given day any number of the pieces of equipment that are supposed to work don't the way that they're supposed to be working.
Yeah but it's in this place.
Especially in this place.
Yeah.
So you're getting your car one day and something's wrong with it and you say to the mechanic it worked fine yesterday and the mechanic looks that you like you're a crazy player.
Are you not understanding there's nothing wrong with my piece of equipment?
No.
No.
You understand the internet is an unreliable piece of equipment.
Hotmail has problems many times.
Oh shit.
We've already had the conversation about hotmail.
Here's another thing on the list of 5,000 things that he refuses to listen to.
Hotmail sucks almost as bad as my space.
Really?
It's unreliable.
It's what?
Unreliable.
I'll be damned.
And all of this time.
Their servers are also inadequate for the amount of usage that it gets.
And so things get periodic with it.
So the essentially go back to my other, my real, what you call the real or Yahoo which even though they have problems, they have problems too.
You can get webmail or Gmail.
They have fewer problems than hotmail.
Or Gmail.
Ultimately, you will have to lease problems with a real non-webmail based email.
I see.
Looks to me like there's some internet source film in baby.
I could be wrong about that.
Maybe we're being infested and invaded.
And nobody knows.
Oh, you have the terrorist cyber invasion.
Cyber invasion.
Now, did you say that you had, you couldn't send, what was the, you know, I responded to several people today.
Three of them went through just fine and one of them could not.
And I got the same error that you did.
So it's affecting some people and not others.
I see.
The wicked worm.
We wear the wicked worm, man.
It's twisting and turning.
Look out for that wicked worm.
Holy mackerel.
This is Joe Boyle on the Voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
And you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God.
I'm an internet man pulling the nails off all over the world.
With one hand on the board, I keep the other one free.
So I can look at naked girls.
Making Polynesian lezzies and piss loving teens.
And girls who are guides.
Choose my credit card to purchase an adult ID.
That gets me right into the sun.
For the China Dolls at ChinaVol.com, make my hand start to turn.
And for hot young ones, I just rolled on down.
Hit menu and return.
Pickle Chuckles in your needles in barely 18.
And chips with a bone.
After teens who like your teas, I look more back to see my cute tiny city hoes.
What did he say?
Okay, anyway, here's a very useful thank you to this Windows email virus going around.
Oh, that's your buddy Bill Gates again.
It says working at GoDaddy, we hear about different viruses going around.
There is a web-based email going around affecting email access.
Well, I'm sure affected my just now because I can't get on it for however money.
Huh? I said, how do you like that?
I don't like it. It says, make sure you and everyone including the old download latest updates are Microsoft.
I've seen people have been able to access email at all until they installed the update.
I always do.
Well, I thought I always did too, but evidently not.
Maybe not. It might not be in your computer, the problem.
Meaning what?
That it could be on the servers that handle your email.
For example, hotmail.
It's one of the reasons.
It just got hit with the virus is what you're telling me in my computer.
That's a probability.
That's a probability.
I see.
Well, there's only one way to react to that.
And I'm sure that everybody would agree.
Right.
We got some serious internet source, baby.
Where is Al Gore when we need him?
Oh, there's a Hilux Willary and Barack Obama.
She couldn't hold a candle to him. She probably liked to.
Is that a mot fire?
Oh, here's the thing about Flamingo Fortune.
The guy called it about before.
It was a Florida lottery game show that aired in the mid to late 90s.
It was originally produced on the banner of Mark Goodson Productions.
Remember Goodson, Todd, and they did all the quichos?
No, you don't.
No.
One taping cycle later, five shows in the year, the production company then became Jonathan Goodson Productions.
Long discussed as the first solo production for JGP.
The show's original answer was Rich Fields, who is now Bob Barker's permanent announcer on the prices right.
Rich was the announcer on Flamingo Fortune for three seasons.
I wonder if he was kind of fat-rich Fields or Pepe Fields or Strawberry Fields forever.
The original host were JD Roberto and Lisa Stall Sullivan.
Lisa was a former model from the nighttime version of prices, right?
JD Roberto was placed after the first season and replaced with former ABC kids shows Michael Young.
Flamingo Fortune was produced by Jonathan Goodson Productions at Universal Studios in Florida.
I never heard of it.
I never saw it.
I thought he was talking about the Elado Draus show, but there was actually a quicho that nobody saw.
And I think I didn't put that on it.
So anyway, Vergie Arthur's lawyer is diabetic and he just about passed out.
He needed to eat.
Good.
Man, Jeman.
He almost had a flat right there in the courtroom.
Well, I tell you, man, you talk about angst between the internet and between the Anan and the Cool business and the Abolt-Hitted Judge.
Judge, a male judge, Judy.
Her mother's a pig and a skank and a money chasing money, grubbing white trash pieces of filth, by the way.
But you like her a lot?
Yeah, she's great.
Like mother like daughter?
So there are all kinds of stuff going around.
But do you think that's in my computer now or what?
No.
Although, always do the updates.
That's a good idea.
Yeah.
I mean, you probably had it set on automatic.
That's a new computer.
Well, let me ask you something.
If you get a virus in your computer and then you do the updates,
does that eliminate it?
Uh, I've never had the pleasure of having a virus in my computer.
What about you, Chris?
You're a computer expert.
You're supposed to be a maven on this crap.
I don't want to have my computer infested with all kinds of crap in it.
If you get a virus, you have to run a virus scan program.
Just updating the latest patch won't get rid of your virus.
Do you want to run that by me again?
No.
The answer is no.
The answer is no what?
Doing the update will not get rid of your virus.
So I have to do a virus scan?
Yes.
Okay.
What's like not?
What's I never used?
Well, other things seem to be working on there.
I don't know.
After the show I consider and poshky around with it the whole day,
it's not likely that you got a virus in your computer.
It's more likely that the virus is out there affecting other things
and other people, like the servers.
It says there's a web-based email of virus going around affecting email access.
Right.
Uh-oh.
In other words, remember when I was trying to explain the difference between
webmail and real email, webmail being a hotmail in Yahoo and Gmail.
That's what she's referring to in that email there.
Web-based email, the virus is affecting web-based email.
Well, this is her Marosi.
Thanks, Rosie.
She's a sweet-hunt.
Are we no Rosie?
Yes, I do.
Crackling?
All the time.
Well, that's what we need.
There's a lot more computer experts out there because, and may, might that be,
might that be involved in the Myspace research that is also,
technically speaking, that is also web-based email?
Right.
So, it isn't just that my base is incompetent or an F,
but the fact that they've got a virus in addition to being incompetent and an F,
they might have a virus.
So, I would take like a long syringe and fill up with something really good
and stick it on your monitors, what I would do.
When I be good at it.
Or stick it in your computer.
Or you can fit it.
Yeah.
Man, oh man.
Who would have believed when I got out of the sack this morning that we would be involved in all these cyber problems, you know what?
Another reason that this whole cyber life.
Well, I'm going to tell you, it's a then good thing that there's other,
there's more than one way to skin a cat, you know what I mean?
What?
The long way or the short way?
No, I'm just saying this.
Or the long way to communicate with people because otherwise, like I told you before,
you know me, I'm like, I can't deal with that.
I don't function well.
When there are people, I want to reach out and touch.
Not literally, but you know, figuratively speaking.
I want to be able to touch them everyone once in a while, you know what I mean?
I don't want to like be in limbo and just, whatever.
But everything is fine.
Everything is under control.
I can't get on my hotmail and my space is screwed up.
But other than that, Yahoo! looks pretty good.
And you say fed all of that.
Now I could do another, I could open up another hotmail account.
But now I would say my name is what I'd recommend is using really mail.
Not opening up another account on a bad piece of webmail.
You are.
You are so milleous in about that.
Oh, there's a lawyer for Larry Birkin.
I think I came to these conclusions that today.
Already it has. No.
Power changed.
You're not agree.
The Bahamas does not need to be a biological father.
A American law governs that child.
She is a US citizen.
All of you in the media have the power to put the pressure on the Bahamas government to do what is right.
Bahamas is a behavior government.
He was talking about there, of course, the babies in the Bahamas in their transfigure.
I have no other laws.
This is a law that is a behavior government.
A very complicated law.
He's very good.
He's not smart like a telling a person.
He's not a kind of a white guy.
Jack Ancestina.
The trestidate who is a real history.
Who the father of the baby is.
And apparently that judge agreed on that.
So she was commenting on that.
And obviously we'll have much, much more.
I'm sure we will.

Up to 107 42 or 15 return,
Yeah, because the message I sent last night that didn't go through and that I couldn't read I just opened it up
Oh, right. Is that exciting or what though? So maybe Chris now maybe Chris can give us a little assistance on this
Because we've got 1217 my space friends out there and probably a lot of other people are on my space and use it for email
Who aren't friends of ours Nate us like poison but never less?
Now can you go on it there and check when and doubt check it out and see if you can open those messages that were
Unopenedable before I will go there and check
Please wouldn't this be exciting a little right on the air run not that I anything to do with it just just crap happens
You know what I mean see an end seems to be spending a lot of time itself floor lately
You just had a big fire on Miami Beach just now
What does that have to do with your my space page mister?
Well, I'm waiting for my things to load up with our wonderful internet, so it does what oh that's right
We won't be on the air long enough. It's 147 over. We only have 13 minutes left
Pacific Missouri. It's not the traditional till death. It was part interrupt by the way any time if you get exciting news there
We're both excited about huh or both gonna try it
We start mail it never okay, and of course you're by the time you get on it will be like about 1 4 30
About whatever 4 20. It's not the traditional till death. It was part
But Scott Amzler and Miranda Miranda Patterson believe getting hitched in a graveyard is just thinking outside the box
So to speak next lover are gonna get hitched in a great George probably things what sorry
I expect it error has occurred
Or still not going through
Correct
Well, how can I was able to open up this thing that I sent well?
I don't know I don't know
I'll find out
Come September the Illinois couple are special to place their undying love among the dearly departed and there's St. Louis
Subber Pacific Missouri in the city cemetery even though those who approved the request are dead set against it
You think that's a little play on words. They're dead set against it a lot of
The wedding wouldn't be out of character for Amzler 27 a computer expert for a financial company by day and a rehabber of old
Horses by night. Oh man
Seems to me. He's got a grave problem a rehabber
The graveyard he said just as a certain tranquility and
something for
Enough shows I can't read the word something into the young couple insist
There'll be a small private tradition wedding except for the bagpipes
Amzler's refurbished hers and throng of eternally silent witnesses
People are gonna think how they want I don't actively try to convince people that my interests are normal or logical
I'm so said I'm not a freak or a Satan worshiper. Oh too bad or cult member. It just goes with our theme
What's wrong with a Satan worshiper, huh?
Deep down the couple said it just seemed right deep down and say how deep I'm gonna talk about the bg's how deep is your love?
Yeah, Amzler and Patterson are recently moved to Collins. I got a new one also you did. Yes, they know so it didn't work for you guys
And probably if I went back on it, it's not working either and I don't know
I don't know if anybody any false hope. Yeah, don't go on with that
Everyone else in the world who uses the internet understands that it's unreliable at best. So you're the only one freaking out
Do I sound freaked out now you're flipping? Wigging
Wigging Wigging Wigging
Just because I said nothing wrong with being a Satan worshiper. I'm not no wicken. Which one are you talking about?
Amzler and Patterson recently moved to Collins, Illinois became an admin not long after they met in November 2005 at a birthday party
Where Patterson 21 was to have been these celebrants blind date?
Amzler showed up on a retooled herst at Cobb Patterson's eye. It was retooled. I
Wanted a ride in it, but I'd check it out the last minutes
By their first date weeks later on New Year's Eve Patterson, New Amzler was the one not long after which he quit her factory job in Sullivan, Missouri and moved in with Amzler in Troy, Illinois
Amzler proposed lies doing a fixing of the side of the 65 hers which the two call Ibbur a plate with a simple message
Will you marry me? Oh, isn't that romantic and a hers
George thinks it's very appropriate both of you are letting me a funeral part in the ride
Simmature and the hers. You should just save time and climb right into the grave
Will you marry me? Seconds later the rings lit on the way crying Patterson's finger
She received that grise and engagement gift and had only one stipulation the wedding had to be outside in a gazebo
Her worries were kind of like in the Godfather were they married on in a gazebo?
That's what it looked like to me. Yes, look like a gazebo. I'm not really sure what a gazebo is
But it looks whatever they want to read on the background. Yeah, I know what it is. I mean in other words
I know it when I see it. Mm-hmm
Just like one of the supreme court justice is he couldn't define pornography
But he say he knew it when he see it and he probably sees it a lot
Her worries were laid to rest while she and Amstler drove to her dad's house while traveling on I-44
Patterson spotted a gazebo on a hilltop only defined it was in a graveyard no worries
The view was just gorgeous. She said she said to him and this is where I want to get married
When the couple called last fall for permission to use the three acres cemetery
Which they to all the way back to the Civil War city clerk Joanne Honey told them the local cemetery committee would have to decide
When I spoke to them they were just a normal young couple who wanted to have a wedding someplace
They thought was nice and serene for a very small intimate wedding. Honey said they weren't any cult group raising like that
Much of Satan worshipers a bunch of witches a bunch of Wiccans
Bill Holtman is said when you're an ultimate on the cemetery panel wasn't sure what to think
He said it's strange to me. It's kind of unusual thing around here
He said of the county town where roughly 50 700 residents roll up the sidewalks at nine o'clock and everybody goes to bed
It kind of sounds like Indianapolis to me like a real exciting place
Wedding in a cemetery excellent idea because it'll be the death of at least one of them anyway. Well anyway. I don't want to go into that
All we're that three-story building on Miami Beach and abandoned three-story buildings on fire
Maybe that's what Chris was talking about before he told us the buildings about how he's a my space is still screwed up
Well, I was hoping mine that seemed to unscrew a little bit, you know
So that's our full question tomorrow would you rather be unglued or unscrewed?
