and mother used to say, oh the blame in their Christmas.
Yeah.
You used to say.
You did a lot of things.
You Rogers, our sports hall radio, WQL.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've got wild diarrhea by the way, so I might be able to out of it now.
Oh, you can tell the fans.
I bloody diarrhea, just like this.
Yeah.
You'll be in trouble with the peacefully clamble.
Totally totally totally.
Don't play a part.
God forbid, don't be doing it man.
10.02 at 5.60 WDQM.
Like I said, happy holidays with everyone you're celebrating and even if you're not, even if you're a sour puss, try to be happy anyhow.
We're trying to be happy all of it's not easy.
Nope.
And if you think it's been unpleasant so far, just these very few days, you just wait.
Wait till I think about tomorrow's one that Schmidt's going to hit the fan.
But nevertheless, it's a pretty sad commentary when you have to work for people who are as low down and obnoxious and unprofessional.
And by the way, I have a wonderful email from IMEF Humm Tree Guy.
From yesterday, he says, BBGI continues to tank a new all-time low of $5.44.
Wow, $5.44. Don't buy BBGI, man. In fact, that's so like crazy.
Because once they get sued and once all the news gets out about all their business practices and not paying their bills and stuff, it's going to go even lower than that.
It might have a minus in front of it.
That's why I say it's just so unbelievable that this is a company that's on a stock exchange that actually is a public corporation that shares to the public and doesn't pay their bills and conducts these really marginal, bizarre business practices, but nevertheless.
That'll all come out in the wash.
Also, we say that you see the Joan Fleischmann article this morning. No, I don't read that, Swill.
On Anviships' campaign of 30 years...
So, 30, man.
Helen Buckner dying. Was she in, and was she a lesbian?
What?
Well, see, and then he emailed me today's thing. He wasn't old enough to remember Anviships.
Which is good, because we need some people on the day to be offered. And by the way, foodie quit going on the year and bragging about your numbers being up 50%.
You don't know what the hell your numbers are, because there's no hourly in the trends.
Anybody who's in the business knows that. So you're full of crap, and IOD went down in the last trend.
So how could you possibly be up 50% over what?
50% over what? Certainly not from the last number.
How do you like that? If there's one thing I can't stand besides no talent eight holes that go on here pretending to be talk show hosts,
is people that go on and lie about the numbers.
Mr. Ego was always famous for that.
Oh, well, we had it there. You don't even show up. You're not even like an asterisk.
Okay, Mr. Ego, you and your boyfriend there?
Jesus, God.
Now, I just found something here on the edge of the counter, because I'm kind of cleaning things up.
Well, Mr. Case, that engineer shows up to a case they ever decide to pay him, and it comes in here to fix the dump button and the intercom.
And a few other minor things in here. I mean, you know, the studio has been very functional and great, certainly better than that one.
And served me well for six years plus. But, you know, there's a thing called maintenance, which these people don't know from and don't believe in.
And it hasn't been a wonder who this is online six Q. I.m.
Hello. Yes.
All right.
All right.
Two things quickly.
Big restaurants in Toronto. Have you tried the Yosos in Yorkville?
Try what?
Yosos.
Never heard of it.
Try it. Check it out. It's in Yorkville.
Okay.
The dry nose and all sorts of things all over the walls there.
Great. But really good restaurant.
Don't say that again. Joyce don't, she's got a problem with the giant. Go ahead.
Right. And second, back in the 80s when you were on data, you did a message for my answering machine.
Is it possible for you to do it again?
No.
Okay. So anyway, I found this thing on the counter here that somebody faxed me and the data this fax was March 23rd, 2004.
Wow.
How do you like that?
That's a reach. And it says, sometimes ago I came across a quote that was attributed to Emel Zola, which I paraphrase as
civilization will thrive when the last stone from the last church falls on the last priest.
Oh, I love that. No wonder I say that.
Is good.
Let me read that again.
We get that on a teacher and little little shmerkla.
Wow.
Let me read it again.
That's close to the point.
That's close to the point.
That's close to the point.
By the way, we had a couple of sales people come in this morning and also Joe Jason Jerks, Jacks came in to say hi.
He's a good guy.
He just doesn't belong on the air.
That's always a good guy.
Seems like it.
I don't know.
You say he's a good guy.
Yes.
It seems very nice.
It's not personal.
It's all business.
Okay. Jerks, Jacks, whatever your name is.
Civilization will thrive when the last stone from last church falls on the last priest.
Boy, how well said.
I'm going to put that right back over there and save.
Oh, it's wide and under that mouse.
Spider run under your mouse.
I'm not joking about the Adirri thing.
I don't have no idea why it's probably like, you know, Gaster intestinal from grief from these bastards.
Right.
I don't have a full-on case, but I might have to make a match.
Oh my God, poor Chris.
What are you going to be doing when George and I are both making a wild run?
Better get a song all locked in love.
Yeah, it's not some songs, right?
Wow.
How about prison games?
It's more minutes long.
Spin some wax.
Here's the poll from yesterday.
We wound up with 216 votes.
We should use a couple hundred of those for today because we're not going to get anywhere near a thousand.
Because it's five days before Christmas, man.
And the people out there that go in are running around like they were given crap away.
And even the Jews are out there for their goiish friends, you know.
And the Jews that also want to be as goiish as possible.
Wouldn't you have thought that would have gone out by now?
It's 2007 for quite a lot.
Stop trying to assimilate already.
Okay, we just had a Chanooka and we had plenty of time there to be Jews.
If you want to.
If you choose to be Jews.
Don't try to be goiim and do with a Christmas tree and try to impress your...
You're all we don't want our kids to be left out or what?
Why don't you go and celebrate Hajj?
Go to Mika.
It's all just...
I'm going to read that thing again several times.
Good.
That's the greatest evil in the world.
I mean, there's greed and there's a big business in all the other.
Which is most of what the world is all about is money.
But religion, man, without religion people might actually be able to think.
And then a lot of folks would be in big trouble if people could think.
What's an argument nobody can solve?
So you got to fight about it violently, you know.
Right.
Nobody can prove their position.
She may look like I've told you before.
Man invented questions and of course there have to be answers for all questions.
So, when man has a question that he hasn't got the answer for, he makes one up.
Right.
A whole bunch of men.
And we argue about the various hands.
That's right.
Well, no, my answer is better than yours is.
God knows.
Only God knows.
My, my Lebanese, Kendra.
By the way, one 1200 bucks a wood buying yesterday afternoon.
I usually don't talk about how much I win or lose.
But I'm going to do it just to rub it in that jackass that quarter-shlock-eye.
He'll be calling.
Oh, I'm sure he will.
I have no problem with it.
Anybody call.
Just go right ahead and call and have a good time.
These people don't care.
This radio station doesn't give a crap about anything other than spots.
Let's get some more spots on here, baby.
What is this turning into?
What?
It's like the light bulb.
Now, I don't think you were ever radioed it immediately familiar with the WFTL with the light bulb.
No, no, not at all.
I don't listen to talk radio.
Well, only old, and I do mean real old radio yenta groupies listen to the light bulb.
WFTL.
Norma Kent was on there and Mr. Ego and Chris Kaufman.
I know.
I know.
Chris Kaufman, Eric Spiderman, and El Knight and a bunch of other people that didn't belong
on here.
But anyway, and what they did was that every break was a whole bunch of them doing recorded
live spots.
Every break.
Everybody on the station was doing another recorded live spot.
And it's just sounded so schlock.
It was just unbelievable.
Plus most of the people on there were schlocked to begin with.
I forgot Alice Rantel.
She was on there too.
And that's what we're starting to sound like, but nevertheless.
What's one word that sums up Neil's 2007 with WDQM?
That was the poll question yesterday.
We had 216 votes.
Unesplainable, 214.
Unesplainable.
Unesplainable.
What?
That's what I voted.
Screwed 194.
Tragic 177.
Great 156.
I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
Tired 136.
Depressing 14.
Sad 90.
Suicidal 66.
Horrid 47.
Expensive 22.
You should only know.
It's alright.
Expensive by my choice.
I take care of the universe.
I have no regrets.
I have no problems.
Now let's take a look at what's happening on today's poll.
It's not too exciting.
Chris is really down in the dumps.
What are you talking about?
Because you know we're not going to get anywhere in your $1,000.
Today is Thursday.
That means it's our 50-50 deal at noon.
Which I think is going to be a little bit more exciting.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
I don't know what's in your $1,000.
It's been a week.
Oh, you want to know why?
Because I guess Eric had a change this because I wasn't around.
I was a woodbine winning $1,200.
Slacker.
I had a good machine mine.
My favorite machine, the dollar wheel of fortune.
Which I don't usually play $1,000 anymore.
But I just had a feeling this machine was going to be good.
And sure enough, it gave me $500 on a line twice and $300 on a line once.
And $200 on a line once.
When machine starts paying on the line, wheel of fortune I'm talking about.
And that's the machine you want to stick with.
The wheel, eh, you know, what drug gave you the best experience before I read the result of the pool.
I had a really funny, uh, good email from Jim still in England on the Myspace there.
He says, I don't know the name of the drug, but it made me high as a kite for the rest of the day.
I broke my ankle back in 95, needed an operation to fix it.
I remember some kind of gas max being put on me before the operation knocked me out.
I woke up in the recovery room, have a vague recollection of a nurse of some kind
and telling me that the best paying color is the anal one.
I didn't have time to disagree before something was shoved up my rear.
I had some people physically later in the day.
They almost had a hold me down. I was so up.
So for your pool, a needle up the ass.
And thanks for helping me pass another year so far.
Jim still in England.
Well, thank you. Jim, good luck to you.
You'll need it over there.
486 on a pool. I'll be the result when we come back.
We got to do the break because we got a lot of spots.
I can't believe we got to head salespeople coming.
I guess they embarrassed them, didn't I?
I guess they made it like the play.
We are prosani non-grady now.
You know, run me out.
And of course after today, after this afternoon, we're really going to be on the out.
But that's okay.
That's okay, jolly.
You made your bed.
Now you're going to lie your big fat bloody ass in it.
At least I don't have bloody diarrhea.
I'll say that.
Thank God for that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
From minutes after 10 to 560 WQM, your sportsman who was stationed.
Oh, God, Neil.
I've heard of Rudolph and his shiny nose.
And we all know Frosty who's made out of snow.
But all of those stories seem kind of gay.
Because we all know who brightens up our holiday.
Gay.
Mr. Hanky, the Christmas food.
Small and brown, he comes from you.
It comes through, it here he comes.
Squeezing between your festive buns.
A present from down below.
Spreading joy with a high heel.
He's seen the love inside of you.
Cause he's a piece of food.
Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny.
He can be brown or greenish brown.
But if you a fiber on Christmas Eve, he might come to your tile.
Mr. Hanky, the Christmas food.
He loves me.
I love you.
Therefore, by curiously, he loves you.
I can make a mystery, and keep you.
Uh oh, what was that?
That's very...
Where's the hell where he's at?
He's coming.
Come on, do it, boy.
I'm trying.
The way I can see it, man.
Here he comes.
How are you, boy?
I'm Mr. Hanky, the Christmas food.
Shades and screaming to our love you.
That's staying song time, time, time, quiet.
Now before I know it, why?
Here's a game I like to play.
Stick me in your mouth and try to say,
Howdy, oh, oh, oh, yum, yum, yum.
Christmas time has come.
Sometimes he's ready.
Sometimes he's firm.
Sometimes he's ready.
Sometimes he hangs up the end of your ass
and won't fall in the toilet.
Cause he's just clinging to your spink, though.
And he won't drop up and say,
Shake your ass around,
Jolly get to drop in the toilet, and finally it does.
Mr. Hanky, the Christmas food.
Christmas leaves he must leave too.
Christmas leaves he must leave too.
I should tell my friends,
He's never gone.
He's no one to share with me,
He's never gone.
Hey, oh!
Hey, oh!
Okay, 10.19 at 5.60.
That's it for you in a holiday spirits.
WDQA and hello.
Nail.
Yes.
I want to give joy of eating a better animal.
You can bitch.
Go ahead with our blessing.
Give it to me for the press of none.
5.607.05.60.
You're going to take a lot of calls from now on this next year.
However long we're here.
Right.
And pound 5.60 on the...
For the resident singular wireless line.
Let me QAN, hello.
Yes, good morning.
It's a good meal.
Speaking, yes.
You may not recognize me,
but this is me.
I have no life, guys.
Really?
I have no life.
I have no life.
I have no life.
I want to wish you a very holy and merry Christmas.
Is that really you, on a trip?
I have no life.
I have no life.
I have no life.
I still have no life.
I have no life.
But I wanted to wish you a very holy and merry Christmas.
And I'll request that you could play the bridge dender.
I have no life.
I'll work on it.
I'll think about it.
I'll give it to a very serious thought.
I'll give it a little custom good time.
I have no life.
And have merry Christmas to you in George.
OK, and happy Etonica.
What?
What do you say?
Hello.
I'm a sinner.
Sorry, I'm reloading the fast.
I said, huh?
Merry Christmas to you in George.
No, I'm not after that.
Happy Etonica.
Happy Etonica.
No, he didn't say that.
Did he?
He said, Pupik.
He said, Pupik?
I don't know what he said.
We are better watch yourself, man,
because God only knows what these bastards
They're probably sitting out there and they're probably sitting in a conference room somewhere.
Oh, somebody says a puppet on the air.
We're going to take that show off and put the sports pitch on tomorrow.
Well, you know what?
If he says something bad, go ahead and dump it, Neil.
Yeah, I can't.
That's the point.
I can't because I got no idea.
My equipment has fallen apart here and they sure as hell don't want to pay no engineer
to come here or maybe it's the other way around.
The engineer who's a really great guy up here, he don't want to show up here because he
knows they're not going to pay him.
A company that doesn't pay people, whoever heard us such things, whoever heard us such things.
That's why it's taken until now, until this moment before finally advised up and had the
intestinal fortitude to say, hey, go ahead and sue their ass, okay?
And we will.
Because obviously when they let it be known that they want you out the door, okay,
finders, no, there's no reason to like hold anything back at this point.
A company that doesn't pay its bills.
It's not just chicken act.
They don't want to pay anybody.
They don't want to pay people.
You think that people are supposed to be in business and have been for many, many years.
You think they'd understand that people work for you and you pay them.
They don't come to show up every day because they like the way you look or because they
like the side of the company or because they like some ehol, it's working in Naples or
something like that.
They show up because it's a job.
They want to get paid.
They want to get money, honey.
And these people don't want to pay.
They don't want to pay their bills.
I think that anybody who might consider buying a share of stock in his horseball company
should know that.
B.B.G.I.
My ass.
How do you do that?
They don't do business like a company like even like a mom and pop company, even mom
and pop have to pay their bills.
Not these people.
We don't line up.
We don't line up.
Pay Booker Brian.
We don't line up.
Pay the engineer.
We don't line up.
Pay everybody on payday.
We don't line up.
B.B.G.I.M.
Hello.
Neil?
Yes?
Do you know how Peter North gets his arm back?
B.B.G.I.M.
Hello.
Neil.
It's Dr. C. Rota.
It's Dr. C. Rota and the H.A.
Who?
Dr. C. Rota.
Yeah.
Dr. C. Rota and Jody B.G.I.M.
W.D.C.Y.M.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Good morning, Neil.
Good morning, J. Sir.
Who is it that these people don't pay?
I mean, may you unkind them?
Sometimes.
Sometimes not.
We're right.
Last paid.
Last paid.
No.
We had to make phone calls because the check was sitting around somewhere.
They paid people whenever they feel like it, if they feel like it.
What does everybody do when they don't pay them?
They just cry and they go, we don't feel like paying you?
That's correct.
That's pretty much the story.
Well, you know, you just be glad we're paying you with all is their attitude.
We'll get around to it when we pay you.
We'll pay you.
That's terrible.
Well, thank you for everything, Neil.
Welcome, sir.
You're welcome.
The price was right, too.
516 on the poll worked.
Jones in for 800.
Yeah.
And if we get to 8, maybe we can get to 9.
No thousand of a criss- I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I was starting to say before Eric had to put the new poll up there.
Because I didn't come back.
How was it would buy, you know, slacker?
No, I'm not.
I don't apologize for it.
I mean, I want a 1200 bucks.
I'd rather have that money than worry about whether we get a thousand votes on the poll.
How much money is that going to make me?
Zipity doodah.
Zipity eh?
I've got a lot of people.
I've got to take care of it in this world.
You know that?
And so I've got to win a lot of money.
Tax-free money, too, by the way.
Unlike the states, when you win the lotto or you win money at the casino here, there's no tax on it.
Which is the way it should be.
Of course, anybody knows that.
Even a child knows that.
In fact, probably all your kids will be playing the lotto.
Give your kids a lottery ticket for a Christmas.
That's a good gift.
It's $47 million an hour or something like that in Florida.
Thought about your kids a lottery ticket.
And maybe if you're really ice to them, they might share if they win.
Or maybe not, they'll just move out.
W-D-Q-A-M-H-L-O.
A meal.
Yes, sir.
I have questions after you for George.
Do you know the number one?
Let me ask you something, okay?
Yes.
Who's down in the air today?
Is it me or George?
I mean, George is here, of course.
I do, but I have questions for George, though.
No, what?
Call George when he's on, okay?
I'm not putting up with him more that way.
He's not.
I mean, I mean, I'm about roarscating sign language.
George is just fine when he's on doing his thing about his life.
I'm not into that, okay?
I'm not into sign language, all right?
Here's one for you, sir.
That's not in how you do it.
That sign language, that's right.
You're number one.
I'll show you the right way.
I know the right way.
And you don't.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey there.
Yeah.
I can't listen to any more Q-A-M after the afternoon.
It's like spot-to-go.
Okay.
Dump it.
5.19 on the pool.
And like I said, we're creeping along.
It's five days before Christmas.
Don't have any great expectations.
And the good news is that George is on vacation next week,
because I'm a good guy.
And number two, is that I'm working on Monday.
Because I'm a fool.
I should tell him, I mean, Christmas Eve,
or you kidding me, I'm such a devout boy.
I can't even.
I can't even.
Gotta make it party to go to, do ya?
And then, no, I don't.
Although I think me and the Paco are going to find a place that's open on Christmas Eve
and that they have dinner.
And that's good.
Oh good.
That's what I've been promised.
You should do the No-Chay Boina thing with him.
If you're going to start again today, I'm going to get up.
What are you going to go and see?
What are you talking about?
That's what it's called.
What does that mean?
That's what you do on Christmas Eve as you celebrate late into the night,
and then at midnight you open some presents.
No, no more presents.
I can't afford no presents.
You don't need no projects.
You're going to find sixty QAM.
The fourth leader.
Roger, God.
Before it happens, you get it here on New Sensei.
John, I miss the Tachtra host made a low-key return to the airway this morning.
I miss again, expressed remorse for the racist and sexist comments that got him fired.
I will never say anything in my lifetime.
That will make any of these never-ending elements regret that they accepted my apology.
Civil rights activists do plan to protest here this morning back to the studio.
News in six.
You're fairly well, John.
I miss was quite delightful.
But some folks thought his jokes were spiteful.
He got tricked off the radio.
He said ho, he said ho, he said ho.
No, he had it all.
And it seems his career was wrecked now.
That's politically incorrect now.
And management said he had the go.
He said ho, he said ho, he said ho.
Maybe what he did wasn't right.
And it started to be a storm.
Even if you're old cranky and white.
Sometimes you've got to conform.
Time's back on the air now.
What does anybody really care now?
A moral of the story you know.
Don't say ho, don't say ho, don't say ho.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, 1032 at 560 WQ AM.
How's that marginal poll coming along me?
Not so great.
Not so hot.
31 votes.
What?
535.
It's still just fine.
Okay, I said if we get 800 votes, I'll be satisfied.
Okay.
56670560.560 on the Verizon singular wireless line.
There's your president.
But what I want to assure people out there is that you're a moron.
You're a dumb-o, you're a butcher.
You're a murderer, although jolly-dohsir.
It doesn't agree with my views about the president.
Up yours jolly-doh, up your fat, ugly and nasty blood-induced ass.
WQ AM, hello.
Well, listen to that.
You like it?
Sounds like an England phone ring.
Yeah, we're just going to say it.
Sounds like one of them European.
No, I'm not.
Here you are.
I can smell it.
WQ AM, hello.
Leave Neil alone.
He's worked for you for so many years.
He's done a radio show with no support.
You don't even put billboards up.
Leave him alone.
You've probably just even hear him talk with the president.
He's done for you.
Leave him alone.
And I did find out yesterday.
Hey, weren't you proud of me?
I'm very proud of you.
It's called crazed-is-not what it's under, crazed-yeah.
And how f**king there it is?
Yeah, like that.
Lots of you are clean up by the way, sweetie.
Get the chlorox out.
Do shit out.
WQ AM, hello.
QAM.
Going once.
Going twice.
WQ AM, hello.
Oh, oh, guess what?
What?
Connected to a server, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Don't tell me we're having problems.
The guy who's got a guy on the air anyway though.
I do, hello.
Yeah, what's up, Neil?
Yes, sir.
First of all, the Asforza Sports Committee was concerned.
I think they were talking about putting on the two slides at night
to replace whoever is there right now.
I think it's the beast.
And I really hope they do that.
I mean, she kind of reminds me of a little bit where she's floating around
from whatever, whatever.
Oh yeah.
And also one more thing.
Over those.
She's the worst out of the eyes person.
Like, Carve, did you ever heard of her in my life?
Another thing too, um...
They've already had her on by the way, and she was a colossal failure the first time.
I would they want to put her on again?
Yeah, they talk about parcels being a new head coach and a dolphin and other thing up a list.
No, he's the, oh yeah.
Like, I want to talk about that.
He's the new, uh, the Chief of the Cook and Model washer.
When everybody else bales off their rotten sinking ship,
Bill Parcell is the big tuneable be there to handle it all.
Who the hell knows?
And who cares?
Call up on the sports nerds, or call the fabulous sports babe.
She'll tell you, she would know Bill Parcells if he stuck his foot up her ass.
Yeah, she's very entertaining the fabulous sports babe.
And, uh...
Yeah.
Like you said, just repeating the same as swill over it.
Over it.
Over it.
Over it.
Over it until your head wants to explode.
W-A-M, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Uh, is there a late-to-year late-patrix?
Did they ever hear a direct deposit?
Nobody waits in line to check the more or wait.
Yeah, we've been through this a million times here.
I understand that this company has direct deposit,
but sometimes they don't put the money in the bank.
And I can't get it so they say because I have a corporation,
which is alive, but they just don't want to give me the money.
They missed the direct part, I guess.
Yeah, they missed the pot.
Okay.
Now, some of these things we've been through so many a million times,
every Monday, not everybody can listen every minute of every day,
which we're not too happy about, by the way.
And we share this hell of hope that we get a big December on every market
and bonus money out of these cheap bastards.
Well, that'd be great, but that would be so fitting.
In fact, I extrapolated what we had and also what the afternoon had in that month and November.
If my math is correct, they had like a nine share in the afternoon and men.
And we had a seven something.
So, uh, I'm going to be leaving Hank is leaving in a couple of less than two weeks,
like in 11 days, and they're blowing off the people that have the big numbers.
And that's what they want.
They want those little tiny numbers that they can relate to.
Okay, I've seen a few tiny numbers, like in the mirror.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
I'm going to you.
Yeah.
We'll have Doppin' and listen to it, Kuda.
W-Q-Y-M, hello.
Yeah, sir.
Oh, yeah, agreeing from Third World South Florida.
Listen, the reason I hate the footage, you?
Yeah.
Yeah, because, first of all, he has no Cahoney.
Second of all, he thinks he's pandering to these South Beach get-o-neo hot babes,
but she's not.
And lastly, there's a bunch of-
He's not a hot babe.
No, not South Beach.
He's a history-old fart man.
His face is so ready.
It looks like he just joined the engines.
And lastly, there's a bunch of these, uh, I get to keep them to keep calling and show them thinking
they're making some sort of a different theory, you know, in the society of South Florida.
He's totally all face, he's wrong, he's irrelevant.
I'm over.
And out.
I guess that guy don't like the footy show, man.
Footy sucks, man.
Ah, somebody better send him a message.
You okay?
Tell me he doesn't belong on the ear.
Even to say hello anymore.
You're done footy, you're out.
Your day has passed.
Join the rest of us who are just beginning a budding career.
32 years.
I was thinking about that this morning.
It's almost half my life.
I've been sweating over hot microphone in this Godforsaken market.
32 years.
And I get the royal beastly foot up my ass.
Well, let me just tell you something.
Okay.
It's not just a question of not paying people on time.
It's a question of writing contracts with people.
And then not abiding by any of the, uh, it's at least they're consistent.
It's not that there's some of the contract that they don't live up to.
They don't live up to any of it.
Any of it.
There isn't one paragraph in there that they, uh, abide by.
And of course, when you have the stupid feeling that you think you're going to work for these people the rest of your life,
and if they've got enough intelligence to, uh, you know, keep, keep sending the checks up, uh,
you don't rock the boat too much.
And then when you realize that there are a bunch of liars and thieves and gypsies and fools like Joe Bell,
and then you say to yourself, well, you know what?
Why the hell is there anything back now?
Okay.
Sue their freaking ass.
Hold their feet to the fire until it burns, until their feet cinched, until their toes curl up.
And it'll like a bunch of, uh, like, what's that stuff like, uh, pork, pork rinds?
Until Joe Bell's big toes look like fried pork rinds.
Can you envision that right now?
I'd rather not.
I can't see it.
I can smell it.
WQAM, hello.
Shula is a bula.
WQAM, hello.
Daniel.
Yes, sir.
I was wondering if you could be on any other station, which one would it be?
A good one.
A real one.
Anyone that's a real one.
But what's wrong with the autopet?
Well, what do you mean by that?
You mean in this one?
If you can go anywhere, if you could be on any other station, where would you go?
Let me say it again.
A real station where they would pay me some money and support the show and promote it and live up to their contractual obligations and pay by people and pay everybody else.
That's all I ask.
I don't ask for a lot.
Just live up to what's on the piece of paper there.
That's all they won't do it.
They can't do it.
They don't want it.
They don't want it.
And whenever Joyce gets up on the wrong side of bed, which is almost every day,
oh well, don't play this and don't do that.
And corporate doesn't want you to play that no more fart sound.
And it never ends.
It never ends.
I remember saying a long time ago to Charlie, Joe, during one of his incipit phone calls to me.
How come it is that we always seem to have this adversarial relationship?
What is the reason?
Oh, well, I don't know, but you're right.
Oh, it just doesn't seem that way.
And that's because you're an A-hole.
That's why a man who's supposed to be a management when you ask him a reasonable question about a serious problem doing your program.
A man who's supposed to be a manager type doesn't say, oh, well, I don't know what to tell you, Neil.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Yeah, pork rinds is not kosher, but it is.
Atkins approved by the word.
No car.
The best talent here is Neil Wright.
What do you expect the more professional players on any way?
You are me.
Orc.
Orc.
Holy macken on.
This is Joe Bow on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
And you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neil Guides.
I'm your host.
Well, he's got my gun.
But that's all right with me.
Because it was sprayed without a quad.
You're fairies.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas while I'm smoking all of my wine.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas while I'm smoking all of my wine.
Police got my gun.
Police got my gun.
Police got my gun.
They can't be scared at all I got.
Police got my gun.
Police got my gun.
Police got my gun.
They busted me in a parking lot.
Oh, black.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas.
I want to wish them a Merry Christmas while I'm smoking all of my wine.
1047 and 560 WQM.
Let's take a look at that sportsman who is scheduled.
What's the story?
Is man a dog back to the air?
I don't think so.
Who's on?
Is Curtis on again?
Probably.
What do you mean you don't think so?
Is this a schedule by...
I don't know.
My psychic...
That's right.
You know he's got all those days off.
I guess he's got him up.
I'm up.
You guess?
I'm not asking what you guess.
I'm asking somebody tell me who the hell is going to be on this station?
I will find that.
Which I promote the hell out of it all the time like everybody else should.
Somebody who's on 2-4 probably Curtis, we don't know.
I don't know.
I mean what kind of a program director we got besides an overgrown child?
The hopper is going to be on here.
It says Hank Goldberg at Park.
Now Park was...
That's the park at a Somal Hard Rock.
Yeah.
And I'm supposed to know that.
Yeah, well you know.
Here's what it says on here.
Hank Goldberg at Park.
Rooster, am I asked by the way, professor?
Rooster.
Remember Rooster, a cogburn?
What was the name of that rooster, Cobb?
I don't know what it was.
Rooster, a cogburn.
Wasn't it a...what you call it?
It was a watcher movie.
John Wayne movie.
Oh my god, no wonder I hated it.
The Duke.
Oh the Duke.
That was a real man.
Yeah, his name was Mirion.
Hank Goldberg at the someplace five to six.
Then we got dolphins all asses with Hank six to seven.
Oh, that's right.
We got to move that thing up to make Wayne happy.
Because we got Hurricane basketballing on there again.
Hurricane warm up at seven then.
The U.M. in North Florida, 730 followed by Clarence's boyfriend.
Oh, the beast.
It's a sports fraternity.
It's not a sports bar with a microphone anymore.
It's just a sports fraternity.
Clarence and his boyfriend.
They've handed the keys to the kingdom over to an overgrown child.
Here you go, Clarence.
Have a good time.
You and your buddies.
Guess at least they...
Oh!
Sure.
Well this phone is pretty weak.
For a minute there, it looks like we're going to have something going, didn't it?
Chris?
No.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, it did.
A few minutes ago we had a little something going, well what do you mean no?
What do you mean no Mr. Negatory?
Huh?
I'm not negative.
56670560.
So you're not the...
You better play your cards right because when we get that massive judgment in court,
I'm going to have to take care of your ass, right?
Well, here's a little bit...
Oh.
A hard ass to...
Until they stick his ass in the box, right?
Uh-huh.
A hard ass.
That's you.
Uh-huh.
QAM, hello.
Yeah, I'd like to pick the Jill Bell, please.
Yeah, go ahead.
Give him the message.
This is Richard Finster with the Bridge Tenders Union and all 32 of our Bridge Tenders
have sent a petition that we want you to keep Neil on the radio.
I don't want to be on a station.
Well, I work on it.
You can't really get out of here.
I don't want to be on this horse ball with this horse and buggy company
and they know that and I hate them like poison.
I'm sure the feeling is mutual.
It should make for a really great year.
Especially once that suit hits the court this afternoon.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Pound 5, 60 and they've arrived in Singular.
Wireless line.
Man, it will be all today too.
What are you going to see and who told you that?
Alison.
Alison.
Alison knows what else is going on.
She's the only one in a place that knows what's going on.
She ought to be the general manager and a program director.
And she actually listens to the show.
How do you like that?
She doesn't hate us like poison.
Like Clarence does and like Jolly Joe Bell does.
And it's better the fact that he lies like a big fat tub of garbage.
Like a tub of human, subhuman garbage.
Excuse me.
Subhuman.
I haven't had a good sub in a long time.
That's because I can't eat the bread.
Right?
I do like a good sub of grinder.
Like a whole new Boston.
Oh my God.
A Joanimo's man.
Those are the days, baby.
One thing about Boston, you can get really fat there in a short period of time.
I did.
And it got me a deferment from the army during Vietnam in 1963.
Because I was two pounds over for my height.
Did I ever tell you that?
No.
The limit for my height was 210.
And if you were over 210, you got an automatic deferment because you're too fat.
Good thing you made a big rep.
I was too tall.
Oh yeah, I had this spaghetti dinner.
I had a big spaghetti dinner, baby.
Oh, Lord.
Oh yeah.
I had pasta coming out of my ears and my stomach.
Oh, brother.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
If you go ahead, you can.
And can.
Are we on can?
Is there anything else that you can say or are you capable of or not?
No.
No, that's it.
Why do I want to give them a chance for the new year?
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Q-A-M, you know how fast the radio turned up so we could squeeze himself here in the side of his own voice?
Q-A-M.
Not there?
Shame on you.
Q-A-M, hello.
Nick.
Now let me ask you something.
Is there something happening on your end?
Chris?
On my end?
Yeah.
No.
I punched up this last guy and he vanished before I could say, uh, what's your arm?
I heard him say, Nick.
Yeah, that was it.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Uncle Neil.
Yes.
Is Richard brought down the NHL Hall of Fame?
W-Q-A-M, hello.
It puts the material in the basket.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
My diary has a delicious taste.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, Neil, I got a question for you.
If radio station like WCVF all new radio, all new radio, 88 in New York City, wanted to hire you for say three million a year, would you work in that market?
Why would you come up with that station first of all?
I mean, well, what kind of, uh, what does that mean?
Well, I'm just choosing a station that I'm going to work in New York City.
Yeah, that's my thing.
If K-A-B-C wanted to put you on here for ten million dollars tomorrow, would you do it?
Well, what does that mean?
Where did you pick that out of?
Who's asked that you picked that out of?
Well, I know you're used to working in this market.
I was just wondering if you'd switched to another market, even though, you know, the money was right.
You know something?
I can work in any market and still sit here on my ass in the same just like I'm doing right now.
Okay.
Well, I hope you stay on the radio because you're great and I hope you get the money you want.
Okay, thanks.
You're welcome.
It's not just about money.
It's about working for people that they want you, numbered and V, want to promote your show and want to support it.
They don't want to support it.
They don't want to do anything.
And that's always been that way since day one.
Their idea of business transaction is maybe sooner or later getting around to paying you, and that's it.
That's all they want to feel obligated to do.
Other than that, screw you.
And that's not just me.
That's the whole, that's their mentality.
This company is a broadcasting company like I'm a brain surgeon, like I'm a rocket scientist, like I'm a freaking Einstein-like genius.
Now, that's how much broadcast ability these people are got.
None.
Zero.
Zippity.
I don't care if they own 8 million radio stations, and that's why their stock is tanking.
Tanking badly, because more and more air every day people are catching on.
Are you, are you shimitting me?
These, these, those picking red necks from Noun Naples?
Give us a break.
Get serious.
And if anybody starts with that serious crap again, oh.
I'm so sick and tired of hearing about, well, you know, they're not paying anybody any money.
Well, then screw that.
Okay.
I don't do charity at my advanced stage or any age.
I don't do charity.
I've paid my dues.
I'm not working for the benefit of, you know, to enhance Howard's ego anymore.
I'm so sick and tired of him already would, you know, great.
He's making 50 million.
How about 500 million in a year Howard?
How much do you need?
The most, and I'll say it again, he is the greatest, not air talent, but the greatest self promoter I've ever encountered in my life.
Every time he farts, the whole world has to know what flavor it is and believe me, that's what's making him all that money.
So I, so I give him that much, but in terms of that serious thing, you can have it.
And he, he's on all day.
You don't understand that.
He's on all day.
Yeah, I do channels, I believe what?
I do understand that.
He said, all day.
WNQ-I-M, hello.
Hi Neil, how are you?
Okay, sir.
Not being holiday, see you, sir.
Back to you.
I have to tell you, I don't know how in the world they live.
I was living to the stations and I was, for a second, I saw Hayden Coulter on Hannity, Nazi and Combe.
How that woman fused Venom and gets away with it is beyond me.
Because he's a right winger, right winger, he can say whatever you want, whether it's Michael Savage or Ant-Man Coulter or Miss Drogre, these other Nazis, he can say whatever you want.
And of course, if he's an elective atel of the Hun, they want you off the Ir-Media Leaf not sooner.
I did be something interesting though.
They always say that they've been selling authors, but they don't, what they don't tell you is that the Christian right by 60% of the books before they come out.
Right.
That's the, that they don't tell you.
Like Bill O'Reilly, he says he has number one, you know, books and...
Well, tell him and Dreard, man.
Anyway, happy New Year.
Back to you.
I think I kind of brought him to a halt there for a second, didn't I?
Yep.
We need more goiim speaking Yiddish, baby.
Then it'll be fun.
Then we'll find out who the real Jews are.
The Palestinians, the Israelis or the Gifts or the Saudis.
The Saudis, maybe the Saudis are really a bunch of Jews in drag.
That could be it.
In disguise, we'll shock the hell out of you, baby.
Just when you count us out like Jerry Lewis would, uh, Gary Lewis would say.
Jerry Lewis is still alive.
Oh my God.
Yep.
Scary, and his head is back to like, only four times normal size now, isn't it?
Remember when it was like 45 times normal size?
Head to zone.
Your shell.
Oh my God.
Any questions?
Have you been abused in the workplace?
Rent or screwed?
Place your career in my zoky smooth hands.
Hello.
This is Norma Kent.
For the lore orifices of the Norma Kent.
If you meet me to conduct business on your behalf, let me explore for you.
It may take up to 13 months for me to explore, but I will explore for you.
Call 1-800-There's so many men to explore.
That's 1-800-Maybe I should not schedule syndication meetings for Christmas day.
If your cell phone does not work because you're in California, call 1-800-I want you to keep Neil hostage to South Florida.
Call now, and you will receive a free cell phone, one that works almost as good as born.
Call 2-800-I want you to keep your cell phone, one that works as good as born.
That wasn't my cell phone, his name is StaysR.
Oh no.
1102 says George Vacker won.
Yeah, no, he's not.
He's not?
Not yet.
Maybe he went off into accounting there to take care of that business that I asked him to do yesterday.
Or he might be likely one of the magic rooms.
Yeah, because I was over in the bullpen.
You know, Allison for letting us know about you know, Mandachan today.
And Lee comes in holding one hand over his eye.
He's like, I think I just lost an eye.
Like, wow, it's morning goes, because the smell and the bathroom, you know, I think I lost an eye from it.
Oh my, oh my, oh my.
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh.
That might be George, and so he came back into here, and George still was back into the studio.
So, you know, he's still not back?
Still not back it.
Wow, maybe we'll get a call in lunch.
George may get may have gotten flushed down the turlith
Or maybe as an act of retribution maybe the beastly people maybe jolly joe bell had him kidnapped in the hallway that's that's more likely
When you think quite possibly I think we're on a virgin 600 votes on your pool Chris
hope so
597 like I said run the verge of a major purge
Maybe this was George is doing as he's already over the verge of a major purge if the flee was holding his nose
That's only I maybe flee was holding his nose in his eye because of the stench of common or that hovers over the QAM studios over the entire building
Reading juliani's sick what we know that he's checked out of a hospital today after being admitted overnight for flu-like symptoms
What a woose he's got the flu. He's in the hospital
Don't you hate that every ten days old cockers get the flu now like with me
I was there five days in Amsterdam and inside the room
There wasn't enough heat to like heat up your ass
It was just pathetic and then spread of that and spread of my scratch. He throw it. I never got sick
I thought you had a warmer there with you and that was the last day. I finally wise up
I mean that's my own stupidity a lot of you in the space you don't have something else. No, he did not I
Wish see there you go again with your smart ass horse crap man
What do you know something and you know you know you're when that when that settlement comes down from this big fat lawsuit
We're slapping them when when that comes down. You're not gonna get very much
Oh, I like it thumb bucks
I'm not lucky. Curried away. I was thinking more like eight bucks. Yeah, hey, I'll take that. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you will
It's like two weeks paid. Oh
There's yours come back in or not that yet. Wow
Holy moly holy canola man should we call him?
He ordinarily when he's got one of these deals. He sends me a text message. He hasn't sent me nothing
Maybe he left his phone the other room. Yeah, he might have left his phone
He might have had to run out so fast, you know made a quick move
Oh, what happened to that call we had on six there that was the one
Yeah, I guess they're one thing is five days before Christmas if we can make it true
If we can just get through the new year, although who knows what's gonna happen, you know
They might have Mandarin melodies on here mid days of pretty soon all depending as long as those checks keep coming
I don't care. I don't care not a car on the board here. We are five days before Christmas
At all through the house
Not a creature was stirring that even allows
Oh, he's back
Dorgeous back. Okay, he can give us a report now on his extra-curricular activity
Which flea said really stumped like the end of the world. That was me that was you wow sure
Jack is flea walked into that he think he thinks he left an eye from the smell emanating out of there. Well, I have both my eyes
Yeah, can't be pretty thing else though. How do you like that?
Flea lost
Oh
Because of the stench
In that turret I have to own it. Well, that's okay. It's we warned the audience that it was just one of those things
It's we're getting out of our system. It's we got QA and disease. We got your bell disease is what we got
I don't know if I'm done. Well, I don't know if I'm done either
Well, I think we are done
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the horizon and singular wireless line
WDQ I am hello
Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay?
I got a suggestion for you. You're the king or queen of radio. Why don't you just open a bill radio station?
Yeah, right. Why don't you open up a can of worms? Okay? Why don't you just open up your own radio station?
You know some of your people are so stupid that it pains me in the groin. Okay? It pained. I was speaking to pain in the groin
Guess who called my house down there yesterday
Pain in the groin is that supposed to be a hint? Somebody I haven't know. Somebody I haven't heard from in a long time
No, there's a hint. Really?
Stand major still alive still alive and
I'm trying to think of why he called what was the excuse that he was calling. I don't know. I don't remember what it was
Well, maybe he was going to pay me that to grand back which ought to be worth about a hundred grand now. That's okay. It's there no problem. No heart feelings. Just stay the hell away
Now I wish him luck. I wish all the talent in the business luck. He, you know, he had a certain amount of talent.
How about what kind of a watch should be about later lately? What kind of a watch? You got any interesting what? What about that Milky Way dark? You like that?
I don't know. Stan was just, you know, he ought to stick to the politics stance to the right wing horse crack. I wish him all the luck. I really do. You'll need it.
677 votes on that marginal poll we got. I got a good poll for tomorrow. You want to hear it? Yes, please. No.
Oh, no, this is notable deaths. I've got the list here that I don't even know where to go. Somebody wants us to add LSD to the poll. Doug, go ahead. LSD, go ahead and put it on there. Stick it.
Who's death? What celebrity's death during 2007 meant the most to you? And I got a list here of like 34 the last of which was Dan Fogelberg and just before that I turn her and before that evil can evil.
Norman Mauler Robert Gleim, our cell, our so Leon and Humsley Luciano Pavarotti, Merv Griffin, Max Roach and his brother Cockroach. Don't just say his first name though.
The Tammy Faye Messner, Lady Bird Johnson, Reverend Jerry Falwell, Wally Sheraw, the astronaut, David Halberstam, not our friend, but the other one, the author. Boris Yeltsin, Kurt Vonnegut Jr. Eddie Robinson.
Eddie Robinson, there was now, there was Eddie Robinson, the first basement for the Yankees. I wonder which Eddie Robinson is. I'm going to have to Google it.
Arthur Slesinger, Jr., the author. And then Nicole Mollie Ivens, and here's my, oh, Reverend F. Dryden, and Father Dryden, I used to have him on my show all the time. He was great, a liberal priest. He was a member of the House from Massachusetts.
Father Dryden, man, he used to tell him like it was and it would be. He was great. He's dead. Art book walled, and then bunch of other ones. And that's not a bad pull. And they're going to say, oh, we don't care about any of those people. We don't want to care.
Because it's not Florida, baby. We just don't care like the phone here. Look at that. They could be calling me. I mean, there's got to be a few Jews out there for Christ's sake that aren't running around with Christmas gifts. Now, Hanukkah's over. Tisha Bows is a long way away. What's the excuse?
I wonder if Howard Kleinberg is okay and his wife. That one hockey game. I went to I didn't see them. I didn't see almost anybody. I recognized it was like, oh, brother, and the report, the fire reports, I'm getting is that there are many games. There's like 3, 4,000 people there.
And it's really well worth having two sports stations in this market because the interest in sport is so intense. It's such a sports intensive for running phony market, man.
We love the heat. We love the panthers. We love the dolphins. We're all and the Marlins forget about it. You can go bowling. You have your own section in the stadium. WQA M Hello.
Yes. I have one for the death list for 1995. The Neil Rogers show.
Yeah. Yeah. WQA M Hello. Hey, Neil. It's a pleasure to speak to the most underutilized talent on radio today.
And I support you wherever you go. And I want to let you know that you've taught this guy every year this turn. He knows and I use them constantly and I'm spreading the good work.
Excellent. And have a great holiday. I want to put your feet up and celebrate your career and wherever you land, we will all be there and enjoying it. And that's all I have to say.
Okay. I'm going to be so much. Have a wonderful holiday, but I'm not putting my legs up in here. Just not my bag, baby.
615 votes on the pool. Let's take a look at what the result is there. Maybe read it right once or twice during the show. It's just not that good. It's okay.
Who did this come from? It came from a Sean the pole guy as opposed to Sean the Felix the cat guy.
What drug gave you the best experience? Booze 153 grass 152. I never used drugs or booze 76 powder cocaine 47 KWALUDE 36 hash 35.
X to C 31 sugar 28 azucadl. That was what I voted. That's the only one I do sugar. I'm just addicted. I'm just oh god.
Morphine 17 crack 14 twilight gas 10. I see how square I am. I don't even know what that is. What?
Twilight gas. I like nitrous. I don't know. Is that what they're talking about? I've never heard it called that.
And I thought I was the one who's out of touch. What is that Chris twilight gas? I have no idea because I was wondering what that was.
I remember twilight time by the platters. How did these shades of night are falling? What?
I'm pretty sure that's the nitrous that like the dead is good. Heroin 9 speed 6 and acid LSD 2 out of 621.
Twilight gas. You got twilight time by the platters? Yeah. Heavenly shades. Tony Williams and the platters but they were good.
Back in the day of course back when music was music and man were men. So Ann Bishop was a die car like that was a big secret.
My god I can't believe that the people aren't aware of that. That's why she hated me so much because I was out.
And used to talk about all kinds of facts stuff on the year. And so she hated me like poison and especially since I used to refer to her as a bull bike.
Too bad. And now you're dead and I'm still plugging along man. Still getting the big pay tax. Oh what I was asking before you were why you were doing a big dump.
Was did you go to accounting and take care of that issue from here? No. I'll do it for the next break.
No I don't mean now during the show you can do it after the show at any or before the show where you know I don't mean if you want to do it during the break that's fine.
And then you can stop by the teabroom again and kind of clear the air. Maybe you want to stop by Joe Bell's office and clear the air.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
I'm just going to smell real bad.
That's a good way for fun.
The fun is really boring.
I need to show the fun.
I'm using your old cream slash only got you today.
Slap.
There's that my ratings have bottomed out in this case.
Which radio have you rebonded to?
I'm gonna get you some old woods and sweet geese.
All you need is now.
All you need is now.
All you need is now.
And then show.
And then show.
Oh, no, no.
Oh, I don't get you move my sand.
You'll fight away something.
Check, hold me to give you this.
What?
What are you gonna do?
Fight me, huh?
I got a punch.
11-18, so Gellie never returned your message, I guess,
on your text message yesterday?
No, not yet.
Well, I'll be done.
Come on, Gellie.
Fast up.
Let's hear it.
Okay, he's probably looking for my job.
That little twerp, that backstabbing little weasel.
He might get a squeak, Meister.
What?
He might just get it too.
Who cares, you know?
You can have it tomorrow, baby.
Just keep the text coming.
How am I getting paid off for a year?
Like I did that seven months with the tax, and that was really sweet.
That was a nightmare for me, but that's another story.
Why is that?
Because I was working here in the production department.
Yeah.
With people who don't speak the language of radio.
Correct.
No one on either side of it.
You survived, and you're still around.
Barely.
Jack Linkblower is dead.
Jack Linkblower is dead.
He followed his broadcasting icon, Father Art Linkblower's footsteps in the 50s, became the host of his TV shows as
Houton Annie, and special events like the Miss Universe page and died he was 70.
Linkblower, president of Linkblower, and a prize is died of lymphoma yesterday, at his home in Cluj del California.
His father told the times I went to.
Art, of course, is still alive.
Art Linkblower.
He's 150 years old.
He's on with Larry all the time.
All the old cockers all the time, man.
As the son of the man who hosted a long-running people are funny and house part of our radio and TV.
Linkblower made a smooth transition into broadcasting in the early age and it goes on.
I mean, it goes on forever.
Like this is somebody important, you know.
What was this from?
Oh, this is from La Shawna, thanks Sean.
The fear is the cat guy.
It provides me with a lot of good stuff even though you don't know it.
He's still doing a lot of good cramp.
56670560, pound 560 on the Verizon Singular wireless line on a spectacular Thursday, December 20.
Today is like the direct deposit day for you people getting paid.
In fact, that's what Jerks Jack said this morning when he came in before the show, Jason Jerks.
He said, I sure hope that money is there today, ho ho ho.
Seems like a good guy, you know.
It's just too bad that he sounds so bad on the air.
Come to QA and hello.
QA ballot just kept finished eating and they should somebody QA and hello.
Do you know that Eddie Robinson?
Yeah.
It was the football coach for gambling.
Oh, that's right. The doctor like the guy, right?
Yeah. Hey, listen, can I get Mickey to call Eris and say?
Now, do you remember Eddie Robinson played first base for the Yankees once upon a time?
I'll remember him, yeah.
Do you do remember him?
I'm up there.
Yeah, you and me both.
Well, you know, one day will be dead and then we can forget about this crap.
Okay, I'll work on it.
Hey.
Okay.
5 6 7 0 5 60.
Come on, it's 20th of December.
It's five days before Christmas.
Where is your Christmas gift to us a really great phone call on the show, huh?
You think I'm serious about that?
No. That would be nice.
Yeah, Eddie. Are you crazy or what?
As if I have to ask.
Look where we are, man.
I'm crazy.
Look where we are.
I'm like those guys though.
Yeah.
Ten years of visibly broadcasting, baby.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.
I think the audience really believes that I make a lot of this crap off.
They do. They don't believe any of it.
Really?
Every time I go to one of those appearances, oh, that's funny.
That's really true.
Yeah, because nobody ever heard of such things before.
There is nobody in business who just, well, maybe somewhere, some little mom and pop or some individual
or shyster somewhere, but there's no company, no reputable, reliable, responsible, real honest
to God company anywhere in the universe that doesn't pay their people.
What was that?
Velcro.
Velcro, Velcro, what?
Like my shoes?
Okay.
If you wish.
You have Velcro shoes?
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
It's for old people.
It gets what?
If the shoe fits.
If the Velcro shoe fits.
So much for crisping in that will?
Oh, well.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
All of them.
It's for old fat slabs.
It's saying that I think about it.
I was told the same thing so I had to stop wearing mine.
You know something?
I see.
I don't wear shoes or any other damn thing based on, you know, what somebody else tells me.
I'm a fat old slab.
I've always been, and I've done pretty damn well, okay?
Okay.
For an old fat slab, I've done pretty damn well.
It's sloppy.
Although I will say this, I told you that day that I was dragged to Harry Rosen in the Eden Center,
forced to buy thousands of dollars worth of expensive clothing.
And like, when I go out to dinner with my friend Paco who you hate like poison,
he'll insist that I put on like, you know, some real honest guy clothes where I looks like human.
So don't embarrass him?
Yeah, that's right.
I mean, maybe he doesn't want to be seen with some fat old slab who looks like he just crawled out of a dumpster.
And I don't blame him, okay?
Although I don't like long sleeve shirts.
I will say that.
That's about the only thing I, well, most of the time here, I still wear shorts,
I don't like long sleeve even like this time of the year.
But he forced me to buy a bunch of long sleeve shirts, and they're very nice, they're beautiful,
but I hate them.
I don't like them.
You know, once last time you wore long sleeve shirt.
Long time.
Very long time.
Hate them.
W.A.M. Hello.
It's like wearing your seat belt in the car with your eyes dressed up to a fancy party or something.
I hate that seat belt, man.
Q.A.M.
Not there.
Q.A.M. hola.
Not there either.
Q.A.M.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Q.A.M.
I'm curious about that voice over with Howard Davis.
Why do you have the patience to story on that?
Yes, sir.
When he just said what I was in, he's speaking about Howard Davis about it.
He wanted to say, what is the story about that drop as if he wanted a story about that.
Did I just played all you need is Mo?
Yes.
Or what?
Yeah, or the the man that drops saying Howard David's a bitch. What about it?
What's the story as if there's a story?
Manage said it we recorded it we play it. He said it for us. That's right
He did it for us because he's a good guy man
It's that's right him and Hank in the Joe Rose. There's some people in there we like and some people actually might actually like us a little bit
Maybe not you mean syphilis, but I don't know these lights
Is even my rip of an ass on ear. He still sends me a mind-space stuff once in a while
He understands it's not business. It's personal or is it the other way around?
WDQA M hello
Hello, yes, sir
Bumblebee tuna Bumblebee tuna Gage it WDQA M hello
Hello, yes, how are you? Very good. I was just gonna tell you that there's a movie on
On the internet that people can access so they can really kind of like get a little bit of an education
The he has some zebra he has an Eddie I as in I you know all about zeitgeist
Okay, thanks. Oh zeitgeist. It's on our website the link to it for crying out loud. I miss guy
Well, yeah, he meant well. It is everybody ought to watch it, but they won't it's a little bit too cerebral for most of the slabs out there in
Radio land
Most of the people are worried about give me the ball give me the ball
And a big tuna baby. Yeah, he's gonna really turn it around a little bit late for that this year
What do I they did that this year to try to save face?
So maybe they might sell some tickets for next year for that swill at their try to put over on the public
Who are you?
4.25
6.2.am
The fourth leader all the crap you can unwrap all the slime all the time
Get more on like Mitchell call up and they say stupid things
That they don't have any bases on because somebody on this radio station who's on between nine and one
Decides to poison everybody because for him it's a bit and the idiots that listen to him they actually buy in
That is pretty dumb to buy in well they buy in because they're idiots
You know why they because their brains are soft like marshmallows and they can be twisted and turned any which way you want
They go great with smores though. That's exactly right. You're on a roll today. I like it
So the brains are soft and they say stupid things because they don't have enough intelligence to come up with an original thought of their own
So they listen to people that can manipulate them to make them say make them think whatever they want
The only thing missing is the cool aid
Thank you Jim who's on today who's who's doing the show today Jorge that's George deal George Rodriguez
Neil Rogers coming back or see none next year. No. Is he really damn?
I got a deal
How I say it's in it and you know while people say you know, you're knocking you know
It's not not this is what you know it is it shows you how effective the guy is that he can manipulate the stupidity that listens between
Nine and one you might agree with that probably and he's laughing his ass off all the way to the bank
He's absolutely late. You know it is. He's laughing at you Mitch because you're a M-O-R-O-N
I'll spell it out for you and now I'll tell you what I just said it means moron
Because you can't spell all right. I don't think I ever played that one there maybe a hundred years ago
It's been a while
What is your story? Are you like having an intestinal?
Yeah, that's it
Or just a mental breakdown
It started yesterday you were like a little off your feet and today you seem like I don't know
Whatever is he just in today Chris or what is he like standing by the doorway getting ready to make a run for it a little gash
Just maybe I don't know what's going on with his phone. Maybe maybe it's five days before Christmas
That's what it is or maybe they're just jumping off all jumping off the sinking ship. I don't know what it is
We got six fifty six on your polo which means it gives us a real good shot of 800
All right five six seven oh five sixty. Let's get this phone smoking baby. You can do it and
And pound five sixty on the Verizon singular wireless line. Don't forget every minute every second
They you spend on the phone with me is that much less time you're gonna have spending your hard-earned money
Well you crazy people running around oh no, we only have five days left till Christmas near you
You understand crash on i95 at the golden glades
As closed but all the one of the northbound lanes now this happened a while ago it happened like a ten oh nine
The FHP urged motorists to avoid northbound i95 between downtown and the glades
The crash was at the entrance of the flyover
I mean it fire rescue was on the scene. I said Miami did I'm very sorry did county details of the crash were not immediately available
All but the furthest right-hand lane was blocked the furthest right-hand lane
This isn't a herald what a bunch of goobers
Meanwhile a double-roll over crash northbound just north of northwest 120 fifths rate was starting to clear
See that's how crazy they are out there now. It's the holidays man
They're crashing the rush lupin their they're lapping their one and they're like crazy people
Are you doing that doing what?
Acting like a crazy person because it's the holidays you got to go Christmas shopping. I've already done that
I'm good been there done that good. We'll quit acting like a crazy or so. I'm starting acting a little crazy now
WQ I am hello. Oh
He hit it. He hit it from the moon
WQ I am hello
WQ I am hello hello. Yes, sir
Hey Neil how you doing? Okay, how you doing? Not bad. I got a little issue here
It's raining out and every time I wish your wife or go on the station breaks up. What should I do?
Turn to a state you can hear is a good idea
Turn on a station you can actually hear that's a good idea when you think
That's what I'm gonna work on a station that people can actually hear with a signal that like isn't being like
Drowned out by Castro interference and B that the it's like when you're on 441 and driving under those height
The electric wires, you know the power and
Have you ever tried listening well Christian listen anyway, right? Well, I guess you never have I guess Chris is probably tried
Try to do what to hear the station on 441 on certain days when you're driving up the Hershey highway there
If you're driving under where the power lines are
And I remember Greg read line to me too. Oh, you know, we can go 50,000 watts
All the way didn't say we were gonna he said we could go. Yeah chickens could be too great
They'll tell you like how a deal said any crack you want to hear
To get you the sign in agreement then they don't live up to it. That's the best part
They don't live up to it and when it comes to paying people they don't want to we don't want to we're the bees leaves
Okay, we're bigger than that. We don't have to pay people they they want to work for us for free because of the honor of it
We don't want to work for the honor
I mean is there anybody who ever heard of such crap of such a monkey business?
WQ a.m. Hello
Yeah, we wish you an early death early soon couldn't be soon enough
WQ a.m. Hello
Yeah, hey
Okay, I want the Christmas is defining a good machine month if you cannot win
I've been having up bad string of luck at the hard rock and I'm leaving town this weekend
Then I just wanted to you know wish you good happy end of the year and all the guys over there as well
Okay, thanks, family. I want to have another box of wood by my son mine every guy
Yeah, yeah, I don't put my sheen mine. I had a good machine. Can I request some cleats on your feet? Okay, you got it
Love you good luck. You'll leave it
So why I got some news you might like okay?
The apparent job three place Hank the apparent job. Yeah, well, you know the job of a place Hank apparently is going to
They're a kind of a guy named Peter Brown
Yeah, for me of a sporting news radio
No, apparently that's the guy who's getting the job
My god Peter Brown
Correct now do you just make that up or what no?
Someone's been a time some information
Who's that I'm not gonna tell you that that's why they're still feeding me information I see you want me to reveal your sources
Exactly, but you didn't get a return call from Gellie. So Gellie didn't get you struck out Gellie
You're not getting the five to seven brown Peter is good in it
You know Jason Whitlock you've heard of that one, right? No
Yeah, from no, I think he's one that yeah from his pin
I think he's the one that wrote that article about Sean Taylor a couple weeks ago that you read yes
Apparently he was offered it
But they didn't offer enough to catch so we turn it down right there you go because they want everybody to work on a cheap
That's what it's all about they want people they want to hire a bunch of low-rent district people that are gonna work for almost nothing
And they think they can still jam up to log with spots
Well guess well when those numbers start coming out and they're like vanishing rapidly and the numbers start with a oh zero
Even the most supportive sponsors out there even the heaviest jocks nippers in town who are in business
They're not gonna want to be a subsidizing that with their hard-earned cash because they don't want to like flush it down the toilet
jolly joe Peter Brown
Is coming to town
Right it down
And Hank is getting shoved out the door his big fat
I got so so so unceremoniously that was now what has even say lately?
How has he been of course he's only had a short period of time?
It's not like us for the whole year in a lawsuit, you know
And also by the way has nothing to do with whether or not they wanted to pay me the money or keep me here
That they're entitled to put on whoever the hell they want you know after my contracts done or sooner if they want
It's about the grotesque unacceptable monkey business practices this company engages and and rights contracts with all sorts of people
And it doesn't live up to them
And I'm so sick and tired a little a little people I'm not that little I'm you know
I'm like a medium person, but like the little people get squashed by corporations that do whatever they want to you
Well, if you don't like it take us to court. Okay
If you don't like it, you know give it a little lawyer well, maybe I might do that someday too
675 votes on the pull we're going over 700 this hour boy. We got a real good shot at like 750 WDQ. I am hello

And all credibility to hell
And then it says brown only be Greg Carmison station in Milwaukee and one ratings book only great job Peter
Took you two years to beat the competition
PS the only reason Brown is doing this is because he needs a job. He is desperate. It says this was um

Well, maybe a little later on when things get really slow in about two minutes. Somebody Q.A.M. Hello
Meal. Yes, sir
So this thing with Hank was this a personality conflict with Joe Bell or are they just cheap because Hank was
In yesterday that he they told him that it had nothing to do with ratings
And he said you know, but he never heard that at 30 years of being in the business that it had nothing to do with ratings
So I'm just curious what the deal is
The deal is that Joe Bell is a thin skin piece of turd jackass
I know he and Hank don't get along
He knows Hank hates him like poison
He knows that I hate him like poison and so both of us have to go
We and the trend came out yesterday Hank went through the roof. We went through the roof
Yeah, the shows of the ratings must go don't you understand? So they don't want to fire them
They just want a low-volume so he leaves
Of course when you offer somebody a 50% paid cut like they did to him and to meet you think somebody's gonna sit around and take that
Good, no, he shouldn't
And then they said if you don't like 50% how about 60% instead instead of being like a real business person
Not having a little bit of decency and saying well, we want to go in a different direction
We should the best the luck. Thanks for the great jump. Oh, they play games with us. That's a joke
Yeah, Neil, I've been listening to you for like 20 years. Take it easy. Have a good holiday. Thanks pal YouTube
Yeah, it's still kids. It's Joe Bell and of course the last conversation that he called with his lies about extending my contract
Oh, you know that Bruce Beasley and I we don't care about the what you say about us on the air because we know it's just part of the show
That's incredible to me. Yeah, did you take care of that accounting thing or what?
what
Now listen, I don't want you're gonna keep saying that and then you're gonna let it slide. I'm like nothing slide
You are you see you used to be as reliable as or as the rocket your broader and now you're already so care of it
Fasting. I thought you said you didn't do it and then I did what you did tell her about the race
I went and talked to my department head and he said he would take care of it. Oh him. I thought you said you took care of it
That's what you're supposed to do
Give your department head
If you must
We kept with the thought of it just makes me want to vomit. Okay. Just makes me want to go on a balcony

Speaking of politics just two weeks until the Iowa caucuses the democratic presidential candidates appear to be in a dead heat in
Iowa
According to a new CNN opinion research corporation pool every day they got a new pool
And then we just have one yesterday that said swallory was like oh, that was New Hampshire
30% of likely Iowa Democratic caucus goers support swallory
Barack Obama is about 28 and Janet wits 26 or you talk about tight new pool release this morning
swallory 30
Barack Obama 28 and Janet wits 26
With the pool sampling error at plus or minus 4 percentage points. It's a virtual tie
New Mexico governor Bill Richardson's at 7% with their remaining democratic candidates all need lower
Single digits kind of like Joel Feinberg station over there. They oh lower. Oh, oh, oh, oh
You never called Norma Kent back by the way Joel Feinberg
So you like to say he likes to pretend put on a good act, you know
Called and left me a message and he called left normal message and then when Norma tries to call him back twice he doesn't return to call
So do you think he's really serious? No, I can use that word of course not
In addition to which I don't want to work for you and I don't want to work for another sports nerd station
Ten years. We've been prisoners of a bunch of sports jocks sniffing jocks sucking idiots. It's pathetic
On the republicans side in Iowa
33% of likely GOP caucus scores support former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Oh my god that far bison
Former message uses governor Mick Romney comes in second to 25 points and Rudy Giuliani with a mere 11%
John McCain and Fred Thompson are tied at nine and for that idiot that called me yesterday. Are you afraid of Ron Paul Neal?
He's got six percent
six percent
With the rest of the republican field in the lower single digits
How do you like that?
Ron Paul just the internet the phenom is all he is and he can raise all the money in the world go on

Prop 16 at 560 WQM so anyway here's there from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel online the data on this one is
November 30th of 2006 November 30 last year
Yeah, what he was talker Peter Brown the highest profile personality on radio station
WS SPAM was fired Thursday
Brown said he was extremely surprised to get the news about 130 PM when he was preparing to handle his regular two to six PM shift at the station
Brown said he'd been talking with the general manager before left on Thanksgiving holiday
The two discussed the terms of the third year of Brown's contract an option year for both parties
I was under the impression we were working on that Brown said
Brown joined the station in January
2005 when it was trying to build its new sports talk format and competition with w.a.ukam
Which was the only all-talk sports station in town
WS SP is owned by intercom a company from Pennsylvania which owns radio stations in
22 markets brown city wasn't given a reason for this missile
Ryan McGuire the program director of WS SP announced his departure in a news release
Thursday afternoon
I don't have any more comment than when I put in a release McGuire said in a phone interview
McGuire asked why was asked why brown was fired
I continue there certainly are a multitude of factors that go in any type of decision like this McGuire said
about a respect certainly for Peter and for the company
I'd love to those to remain private I'm not liberty to talk about those
what I will say is Peter is a professional who's been doing sports radio for a long time
I wish him no ill-real at all all of us wish him the very best of what will probably be a
continuing broadcast career brown 41 suspects his salary might have been initial for a station that
doesn't generate big ratings numbers I make a lot more than a lot of other people brown said
they've had a program director change if he had all those things up you know what I mean
yeah what do you mean brown said it was pleased with the quality of national sports figures he was
able to deliver to his show I thought I was starting to hit my stride in Milwaukee brown said
I really like to market a lot I had a lot of the smart sports fans I was starting to pick up speed
people were starting to warm to what I do but you're fired at it brown worked at 2 to 6 p.m.
slot on weekdays an hour of a show we played from 6 to 7 p.m. oh boy the high energy brown

Wexler indicated he hoped he'd received at least fifty thousand signatures of support online when
he announced along with the house judiciary committee colleagues his intention to bring me for
that body the subject of impeaching George W Bush and Dick Cheney since that initial announcement
support has reached levels that enable Wexler to double his initial expectation as he just passed
a hundred thousand mark he's now hopeful of receiving two hundred and fifty thousand signatures
of support and his ever to anticipate initiating action before the end of the year you go Bobby there's
a good guy Bobby Wexler it's significant to note that when congressman Wexler approached the
mainstream media by running his announcement as an op ed piece that he was spurned by those stalwarts
of the mainstream media the New York Times the LA Times the Washington Post the Boston Globe and USA
today perhaps those prestigious publications were mythed Wexler for not supplying something
currently newsworthy about the exports of Britney Spears of Paris Hilton rather than concerning
himself with saving the US Constitution and American democracy the only mainstream publication
going to print Wexler's vital message was the leading newspaper in the some state of Florida
the Harold which ran an edited version of his op ed and it's led into the under section
the anxious hero I wonder if LA Breffer had some to do with that don't call here Ellie ever
it is time for the people this is a bill here in Smirking Chip time for the people to take a
stand and ignore the tear to step into the voices of the Joe Klein's Tom Friedman's and George
Wills and United Winter Regime of the seat and corruption in which the US Constitution has been
more than trashed and assaulted it's been removed from the current system of government which
neo-conmarauders hijacked democracy and substituted an orderly inversion of suppression of the many by the
few past 100,000 years going to get over and get the Zidane signatures on it carry champion

job November 20 but after lobbying for the station publicly and privately WGCL TV is giving
her a second chance thanks god she's back on the air January 7th no longer doing weekend anchor
work and since it'll be reported with the 930 AM to 630 PM weekday shift in mid November she
champion said what some thought was an astie profanity when she didn't realize the mic was on
she later told Richard Price of the mainland institute she actually said mother Saka but admitted
even that was problematic they thought she said mother F.A. Scratcher right but she said she made
a mistake but felt she didn't deserve to be fired over based on the audio I heard right

no 900. Well, it's five days before Christmas. If these people don't have something else,
you know, we're going on in that. Then God helped them and God helped us and... Damn, God!
WQAM, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing, brother? Great. Good, good. Hey, I got
a little skyward for this morning. I heard you were wanting stuff to a quarter-slot guy.
Is that true? Or I'm just... I said we wanted to kill a quarter-slot guy. That's what
I said. Schmuck. A deal. I said we'd like to put your head in a vice and we'd like to have
percolise come along. You just squeeze it. So your head was a size of a BB. Don't be hatred.
Show the love of it to Christmas science. Love your ass, okay? Love your ass. Stick your head in it and have a
good time. We hate you. We despise you. We, the whole audience would like to just pound you silly.
With a baseball bat, with a brick quarter-slot guy. I heard you want to talk to
there. No, we want you to go away, but that means you won't. We want you to die. Die, die, inu.

A strong showing by Huckabee in the January 29th primary could up and Giuliani was counting
out a route in Florida to carry him through other large states, building a week later,
the New York mayor is the closest Florida has to a hometown candidate.
Right.
There are some buildings and advantages that will be difficult for Huckabee to overcome
said Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio, who endorsed the former Governor of Arkansas last
week, could even be in striking distance to Giuliani, would be a huge victory for any
of the candidates in a huge bloated Giuliani.
Huckabee's challenge makeup for the months that rivals Giuliani, Romney Thompson,
the McCain have spent positioning staff, mobilizing volunteers, and tapping donors around
Florida and do it in six weeks.
Oh yeah, he's got to get all those born again, boy, a man.
Of course there's a lot of them in Florida.
It's a Bible, Bible, Thump, and Yehu state, as if anybody doesn't know that.
All the Jews jammed into Boker and all the Cubans jammed into the county and other, well,
of course, you know, your people.
If it's a Republican, they like it.
We like it.
We like him.
We don't care.
Of course, if he was Catholic, they'd like him even better.
You know, if he had like a bunch of rosary beads that I'd cross, like Dracula, like
if I had a Helsing, maybe some wolf, you couldn't hurt.
WDQ-YM, hello.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
Wouldn't it be good if it could be wind?
Because no, he can't win the presidency.
Too much of a religious villain.
Yeah, right.
That's what you think.
You know, that's thought crossed by mine, but you know, something never count demagoguers
out in America.
He's pulling well in all the Yahoo stage, right?
Yeah, like Florida.
Exactly.
Well, we just all luck.
Okay.
Good luck to you, sir.
Okay.
Don't be so sacrilegious of this time of year.
Okay.
Oh, wait.
And a manger that child is laying there and, yeah.
And Yosuke wonders how they got there.
Because Joseph and Mary, they didn't do no hanky spanky.
Because Joseph was gay.
Wouldn't that make the story a little bit more believable, do you think?
I mean, that's saying a story about the virgin.
How many religions had that before?
105,000?
Yeah.
All the stories are very important.
And the sewers, tenor, all that.
And the crucifixion and the returning.
Oh, my God.
And all these fairy tales continue living on through the centuries, through the ages, because
it's big, big tax exempt business.
768 in the pool.
Come on.
Let's get to 800.
And then we then we fly from there.
You'll see.
Dominic Q.A.
And hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I can't talk to you.
Speaking.
Hello, Neil.
Hello, caller.
Are they going to, uh, when a small radio station is off board to finally pick you up,
are they going to allow you to tell us where you're going?
Like they got a choice.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Uh, Neil, you're the best bug.
Yes, I am.
Okay, see you, pal.
I feel like I'm going to be on here assuming that we finish out the whole year.
There were, although I have my doubts.
I don't know.
Who knows?
I mean, like I said at the beginning of the show, if you think it's been on the show,
it's been on pleasant last several days, a couple of weeks, whatever it's been, it's going
to become a lot more unpleasant.
I would imagine because once they get sued, they're going to say, oh, geez, we can't let
you stay on here.
Well, why not?
Why the hell not?
I mean, they could, you know, just give me a long vacation and just keep paying me.
Yeah, bro.
What?
They're not going to do that.
No, they're not because you know what, uh, Jolly Joe said and what Bruce Beasley says, oh,
no, we're not going to pay Neil one dime for not working.
Okay?
We're going to pay, blah, blah, blah, blah.
We'll be right.
So just let me stay on here and crucify your stupid ass.
How do you like that $5.8?
Beginning of the year, BBGI, Beasley Stuck was about nine bucks, nine and a half.
And suddenly, in recent days, it's taken a precipitous slide about a week ago with $750,
and now it's $5.8.
And it's dropping like a rock, man, like people are just petrified.
I mean, who that would want to invest in people who do business like this.
And that line to Hank about well we don't care it's not about ratings
Yeah, well what the hell is it about then fed as jolly Joe if it's not about ratings in revenue then what could it possibly be about?
It's about the way I'm hello
Deal yes, sir. Hey
Just want to say thank you for the many years
I drive for a living and a surreal shame that you're going up the air pali
I'm going off the air
Oh, I hear you you're leaving ancient leaving this station that doesn't mean I'm going off the air
Well, if you happen to resurface in South Florida somewhere, I'll listen to you if not good luck to you
Best of luck. Thank you so much to you. Oh, I am going off the air right. I'm not going anywhere
I'm gonna work until I croak and of course these people are trying to accelerate that process. That's the problem
I don't know what to tell you deal
Oh, I don't know what to tell you and you know
He never had the co-hons to respond to my couple of emails that I sent him so I won't waste my time sending anymore
Because he's fineless and gulless and a coward and a liar and a backstabber and a bloody piece of theory
I don't know how that got on the air clearance. Let's go have a conference about it
Oh, and nothing ever followed up on it. I did it on that pay your bills
I mean what what could be possibly objectionable about that? It's all true. It's embarrassing
But it's all true. They don't pay their bills. They don't pay people. They don't fix the equipment. They don't live up to their contracts
They suck
And they make life miserable for everybody who tries to collect the paycheck that last that last
Fiasco they had
That one is never going to escape my memory until the day they stick my ass in a box and turn it that right now
And there's people like poor George and
Chris and everybody in the building the little people
Well, you should be glad you're the pay isn't due for another five days anyway technically
So you should be glad you're gonna check it all
Ah, isn't that basically the altitude? Yes pretty much
That sucks
I wonder what time their show is on how many people tune into the WDQM because the beesle zone or because
Joyce's the corporate attorney or because Bruce beesle is a sports nerd who sniffs jobstrap's in the spirit time
WDQA and hello Q a m ola
No, yes, sir
I wish I could spend my Christmas fishing with Susan Gray. Yeah, great WQA and hello
We will follow you wherever yeah, but Q a m hello
Meal what is the Louis and Connie doing these days? Who?
Louis and Connie oh, yeah, come to the Q a m hello
Yes, Neil yes, are you sure? Rose's friend? What does that mean?
Yeah, I'm the kind of explanation and apology for the idiom that's going on in the morning with him and Jack is smack and smack and all of it
773 I love your words. Okay, Joe's a good guy
Good broadcasted to when he isn't just doing eight million spots and they're being settled with whatever that is
773 I think we got the 800 look maybe even 850 you never know. Let's not the set our sights too high
You know because they're a couple of chunks now
We did a phenomenal job on the Schulter steaks who certificates by the way
We sold out a hundred and about how long 14 minutes correct? Wow a hundred not 50 like we do some weeks but a hundred
All I can say is
I'm really impressed
You believe me? No, no, you know WQ a m hello. Neil yes sir
You know the wobbles down with the dolphin to practice in
The WQ a m hello
WQ a m hello

You're 560 Q a m
The fourth leader
The doer
Hey, look honey. It's a politically correct garylar. Oh how nice
And by white we don't mean Caucasian and by Christmas we mean winter holidays
And by no we don't mean to assume that we know more than you
You
Is that all right?
Unless they're hearing impaired then we respectfully direct your attention to Barry who's signing over there by your mailbox

We have mad dog on today too now. Let me take a look at that schedule. So we got the Peter Brown is coming or not. Did he deny that?
Uh, he denied that anyone has been hired for that position. Yes
It's the 20th of December. Hanks last show is like the December 31th a week from what next month. Oh, why does that surprise you?
You've gone to this before here. Yeah, we have gone to this before where they're so very late things.
Limbo shows when you do it that way you always wind up with the best talent out there. Right. Maybe they're going to have a series of auditions
Oh my god
Maybe they find somebody who worked cheaper than Peter Brown because he said something that in the walkie story about how maybe a salary at something to do with his getting can
It looks to me like this guy who's gotten canned everywhere he's ever worked. I couldn't be wrong about that
Remember we once had a guy that was candid
He ever worked before and boy he sure stirred up a lot of crap man. Sure missing. Remember the day that yeah, you know something those were better days
Those were better days one of the first calls I ever had from jolly joebell was hello Neil joebell
More how are how are david's done his last show on wq way? I remember that it like like he was bragging about you know
We miss you mo. I mean, you know you were you sucked on the air and you were an idiot, but nevertheless
At least it was some fun
It was like some life something going on other than just give me the ball give me the ball. Let's go out to camp. Let's go
You know, oh my god. Let's go out to practice because it makes perfect and what about the big tuna

And by the way jolly joe your private investigator did a phenomenal job in cleaning up our phone situation
You did a spectacular you know one thing about him
He's consistent everything he did was a failure everything

I mean they could be right but nevertheless never less. We don't want to how do I can we verify that you know
566 just some sour pus over there. So another worst in sour grapes, you know
I mean it's nothing that legitimate sour grapes like we do because we've done a job job. I mean what are the people that over there
What are they accomplished over there besides having that bogus July
And that's sui crap, you know
Pretty sad commentary when that's the best that they can bring to the table and of course, did the kid wow
That it sounded like him without the accent
Wtq a and hello and he'll try to find Glenn and Miramar. You know, where's that?
Yeah, he's the the shooting range okay. Go shoot him
Wtq a and hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I just wanted to say. I don't really have any material
I just wanted to say that I've been a big fan of your show for a long time and I love Georgia show too
How are you doing George? Yeah, and I just wanted to say good luck in the future. I know you got one more year left
But uh
There's got to be something better down the road buddy. So don't let these but holes
Get on your nerves just tell them to keep the money coming and I'm out of shit. Hey man like I said before I'll say it again
drop us do's and drop out
Joe's
Oh
56705 60 pound 560 on the Verizon singular wireless line
786 on your pull crispy that 800 lick easy. You're all right
Wtq a and hello
Yes, sir every time this year I get Christmas linkage. I don't know how to stop it
Yeah, that's what the book sounds good
So where did you get that focus information about Peter Brown his parents denying it if it's if he's denying it that means it's probably true
He came in all the food was in here to get his uh his slice of meat or whatever like that and he has where he got some food
He wanted to note yes, I think I don't know. I was too busy paying attention to my food
I wasn't paying attention to him or that article you were reading so I didn't know how do you let him have food?
um
I didn't let him have any food see the foods all in the studio over there on the other side of the equipment from me
And he can I get mine and what's going on on the other side of my mind? I don't care. I don't think he got any actually whatever
So do you want to hear the story? Yeah, I'm listening
So he comes in and asks where did Neil get that article about Peter Brown is that his name? Yes, and I said
I don't know and because he's got it from fuck Brown. All right
And I said we haven't hired anybody and I said all right whatever. I don't care
That was it. Well, that's not what Chris says now. Who do you believe Chris or the source that Chris had or
Clarence I'm paying no attention to any of it. Yeah, well you don't care anyway. It's right your hard-ass. I don't care
Not everybody Q a m. Hello. Yes. I want to just kiss it. Neil. Yeah, just this WQ a m. Hello
Q a m. Hello
Q a m. Uh, Neil. Yes. Hey, how are you? Okay. Hey look um, there's uh, I like your fault today
But there's two two two things that you guys forgot
One is called Jen Ken um look that off George
Um, and the other one's
Okay, tell me later fan fan. I think is what he's saying
What he said I have no idea. No, I don't worry about it
And I still say there's no such thing as that uh, what is it?
Or we we change it tonight for you. I got rid of it
See because one day the reason that I put that together is when uh you go to a dentist
Don't they sometimes say do you want the twilight anesthesia is that not something that uh, I've never heard that
Okay, well, I've never had the pleasure in a dentist office
But I've heard that that's what it's called
So I think that's the reason that that is off is either and if you saw my illness you'd understand why what you need to do with that
I guess no, I got a great dentist in matter of fact. He's an old Russian guy old Russian Jew. He's great
Do you want to know his name? Yeah, no. Come any Q a m. Hello
Yeah, I want you to play down great. So I'll kick your ass. Yeah, I guess well
Yes, yeah, I told you that's the same guy. Sure. No, there's one on there put it on there
Frankie Lime and the teenager guy got a new at least he's got new routine though
WDQ a m hello
WQ a m hello
Yeah, that was Joe
Let me ask you something um given the fact that these people have trouble paying do you think that there's an option that they're actually going to buy you out like past it?
Could be no
Probably not probably not
Probably not
No, probably not
Probably not
So that well these people don't have any shame Northenders, this thing about not paying people I've been screaming about that for years on here and they just like uh, you know, they bite their tongue and let it bleed
They don't want to pay why would they want to pay if I'm working they don't want to pay me if I'm working why they want to pay me for not working well
Yeah, but the the the recourses are sit there and have them you know have you ripped them every day for the rest of your year
Well, that's right. That's right. Well, which is what happened with Paxton you were on you know in a pack
So we got tired of listening to you we rip him and then finally they bought your contract out well from your mouth to their ass
Right, and then what happens is George in the interim, you know like the rightist right the big guys are paying the little guys
He's got to go what the work as a delivery driver for a while right that sounds like a possibility
I'm handling cardboard sign on right five. I was dairy overpass. That's terrible man. You don't have the same contract
I have a big hat. He could be like the sit-in chupacabra
My contract says that they can fire me beat me and I still have to pay them
That's unbelievable. So even if they bow at Niels contract you're you're just whatever you just don't worry about George
I take care of everybody
Don't worry about him. He's not going to miss any meal. I'll follow you wherever you go
I've been a month. I'll use since it's hurricane Andrew
What I first send into you back in iod days and I'll follow you around wherever you are. Thanks a lot
Thanks see this is the way it works in radio and that is that if you have something if you got a loyal large audience
They do follow you. That's what happened. That's why they wanted me on the station in the first place
Greg to his credit cut and pasted everything that he liked from iod the whole sports department and you
I
Mean from a m to f m back to a m from a morning to a nighttime the midday from you know all of these things
All of these things and their damn few of us in in history this market who you can do that
You know that's why the reconcilencing was so sad
Because I think rich has thought they did you just went on a year and automatically the iod the audience would be there
And they get a number and guess what?
Share value is that a bit bad. By the way, if you were doing the recon such show they might have followed that's correct
But he wasn't doing it. He was being the stock market maven
but you're like that
And you know after being a goofball on the year and sometimes a funny one you know for all those years and all of a sudden
He's gonna have credibility talking about the stock
Share value my ass
oh
I always step on it last the little shmurkler but maybe i know i've done a better job
That's because of not any hurry. I'm just sitting here very quietly mighty man. I'm business being a good boy

Done okay good
Two for the price of none i like that
Doug Thompson writes is Washington burning
Well, he's writing something almost every day now he must be getting pissed off and fired up at a boy duggy
Write a lot of stuff before they come and drag your ass away
He says the mysterious fire in the old executive office building on the White House grounds sent conspiracy theorists in the overdrive Thursday
What they wondered went up and smoked by President Cheney sweet of offices in the OEOB
Hey, we love a good conspiracy theory here at Capitol Hill blue
We learned long ago that anything is possible from the bush boys and girls at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
So we're happy to join in the latest guessing game of what did they know and when did they burn it
Since the fire erupted in Cheney's office is speculation deepens Cheney is after all the Darth Vader of Bush
Go the black knight most often accused of being behind all the nefarious actions of what many considered to be the most corrupt presidential
administration in American history
So what did the fire reduce to ashes just as federal judges congress and British's own attorney general lunches probes into the various high crimes and mr
Meeners
If evidence was destroyed
Most obvious would be any memos relating to that meeting of White House lawyers Cheney and God knows who else discuss what to do about those pesky
CIA tapes that showed torture of detainees
Or maybe a some of speculated those White House visitor logs that showed just which holy rollers came to
Chateau Bush to help the president commune with God and seek new justifications for killing people in Iraq
But this could be just a the tip of the ash pile so much wrong to win so little opportunity to burn our own favor list of what went into the fire
Results of Bush's latest urine test what did the president snort and when did he snort it or maybe he just went back to drinking if he wasn't drunk or stolen some of his actions of late could give sobriety a bad name
White president Cheney's bar tag from that day on the ranch in Texas when he shot his lawyer friend in the face
This as he wasn't drunk but it's been owned alive
Those pictures of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and sentiment duty leader Harry Reid locked in a 69 and achieved motel on US
Once out the Washington Bush got what he wants from Congress last year. Maybe he doesn't need them anymore
Plants for the invasion of Iran now that the new program is shut down over the other White House has to come up with a new set of lies to just to find another war
Photos of first daughter Barbie Bush dancing topless at that fret party in college
Hustle publisher Larry flim offered a million bucks for them, but they never turned up in print. Maybe Bush paid more
Plants to remain in power in 2009 by declaring a national emergency declaring martial law and suspending habeas corpus
Lincoln didn't he was a Republican too
Secret service photos of Cheney not a host senator Larry Craig together in that men's room staffed him in theapolis airport
And photos of encoder giving Bush a lactance in the overall office. No, not even Bush is that desperate says Dougie T
Cute
Marginally cute not like fall down on your ass and the hour go nuts
806 we did it. Oh, we got the 100 votes that we were looking for now. We can go home. Okay
God take a deep breath
Exhaillin just relax all the pressures off
Nobody Q a m hello
The motivation station wants you. Yeah, the motivation station my ass
That was a big success
I want now see I still know the call of his other one of mr. Ego's on your W is it? I don't know
Nobody knows. I don't think I want to know
I don't think he what I want to know that he cares no five six seven oh five sixty
We're doing a little screenless here this last hour
Let me take a look at these numbers here and see if down near the bottom of the numbers
Like in the morning. That's mr. Ego's hours and I know he's got a humongous tune in audience in his own mind
This is a man who never had any numbers in this market. It's amazing all years. He was on one one time
I think I'd W. S. Newsie had a reasonable number the rest of the time and and I think the first book at the i.o.d
Remember when he was following me. Yes
Some of the numbers are oh look at that a 1.8. I think that's it NMA
W NMA I do believe that's it from a one two to a point eight to a one eight twenty four in the market out of
30
Some odd and I do mean out of 30 some odd stations
34 not too bad. There's Steve. Oh nice go on baby. Keep plugging away
Keep pumpinos fake body parts

Not too promising a 49 that's a bitch because it's Thanksgiving unique a lot of turkey
Even with the gravy, but don't eat this stuffing and of course. What's the best part?
Stuffing same Christmas, right? Right?
a 50
You know for a fast-slop like you I'm talking about the lectable a good stuff that people are going to be eating any day now
I'm probably eating already and you're talking about the pole again when you stop with your pull obsession
Okay on the old fag. I'm the one supposed to have a pull obsession like I will be I have recording its entirety to the night
Christine. Oh, okay
And it's on air. It's pristine Christine and I fast forward into that scene in the hospital again where what's his name is him John Stockwell Dennis
Dennis is in the bed man in a hospital. We got a broken leg. He's got his leg up in the air. Oh, baby, but anyway
I just watched it you know 40 50 times
He's got that real tight pair of gray on these on air rant wow
John Stockwell. He was a pretty young man. Now he's a ugly middle-aged guy
gross
Like I told you before it's like anything else in life, you know
You got an old Surlorn steak that maybe 20 years ago was just juicy and the lectable and delicious and now it's still sitting on the table man
Everybody in abandoned building somewhere like that abandoned warehouse
Where where my picture is?
If anything was ever appropriate man that was it was that perfect
Yep, Pub said here's a picture in the LNW QAM on the back of an abandoned building somewhere
Which beats the hell out of all the promotion we've had from QAM which there isn't any none
Not minimal not a little bit. Not just teeny tiny none
Zero and and then you compound that by thinking about the excuse
Can you imagine any rational human being saying oh well? We can't even host in your contract
We can't afford to promote you Neo. We have no much promotional budget because all the money we lose on the marlins
Have you ever in your life in the history of your freaking life?
Have you ever heard anything so pathetic and absolutely unacceptable? Nope
We lost that well don't look at me
I didn't sign the deal with the marlins. I didn't lose all that money for you
I don't need to have you put those stupid games on and destroy our ratings on those day games. I didn't need that
Not to mention this hurricane basketball games that clearance forced that on us too when we must to old points
That's the excuse
I mean if you were to sit down with a sane rational person who's just you know from the outside
Who has no preconceived notions about what's going on with this this company and this station and our experience with it and some other people as well like the Humper
And you you explained it you know and very calm rational matter of fact language and wrote it out in long hand
They they wouldn't believe it
In my right they would not nobody does all you'll like is nobody comes up with these things
Nobody goes out of the way not to compete and makes up stories about oh gee
We lost all this money on this crap while they lost all the money on the crap because that's what they're obsessed with
Hank Orberg didn't lose the money. Neil Rogers didn't lose the money
They lost money on a freaking dolphins and the marlins and the panthers got only knows because you could go bowling in that damn arena
I scrolled by the way Wayne
That was a classic at the end of the year. It's very important that we play this and I'm gonna tell you something right now
You can mark it down right if Howard County would change their mind and decide they wanted to build this facility
I will not play here
Because I will not have you guys
Looking at me for the next 10 years saying here's a guy that said one thing. I went out and did something else
Well guess what right there was a guy that said well something. I went out and did something else
You played there and you know
And they parlor that franchise into the turd and nobody goes there anymore and of course he dumped it
Like he's going to do with it offence now. He's you know talking to people about dumping that off too
That's his favorite deal man. He takes something. He buys it
He destroys it and then he dumps it off
He gets rid of it like oh, you know like like dropping a hot potato like dropping a gigantic turd
You know what I mean? I don't even
