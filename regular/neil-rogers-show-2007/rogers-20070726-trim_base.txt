No predispensing unusual sentences doesn't want one sprouting in his small town a horror house that is
Because if you have a horror house something else sprouts in your town so chicken itty and that interesting with his name is
I know the brother chicken George story well no way to get to the meat of this you order three-man charge with soliciting sex to take turns dressing in bright yellow chicken costumes while
Carrying a sign that reads no chicken ranch in Painsville chicken Eddie got it I'm probably not saying his name right and who
He'll cares the sign in costume referred to the world famous chicken ranch or prostitution house in Nevada where sex
From money is legal at least in certain places
Painsville borrowed the costume from a woman who wears it to cheer patients up at a local hospice the chicken costume

After the woman interrupted Thompson by questioning his conservative credentials
Like the candidate said don't fuss at me. You asked a question. Let me answer it

The
Later she shouted at Thompson as the news conference ended police officers took her outside of fence
Area near the hangar and stood with her until the former Tennessee Senator departed kind of like keeping an eye on her ass
Maybe she had a shapely lovely ass who knows all I doubt it. Sorry picture there. She didn't look too attractive to me

late too late five five hundred and fifty two votes on our pool I think our goal
is six hundred I shouldn't hung up on that lady she saw me a lady call and
no less the very first one right of the box they said Broward County will never
be the same they said history was made hundred this is from the Iskum
Sentinel which by the way they changed their website if you notice that and
really blows the old format was much better much preferable to this new artsy
farcey when it sucks I just thought I mentioned that not that they're going to
listen to me but it really is bad hundreds of people descended on city hall
asked actually not worth Tuesday I'm sorry to announce mayor Jim Noggle for his
record of inflammatory comments most recently about gays although Kenny Walker
on our morning show this morning briefly announced that Jim Noggle loves gay
people to which we all went right a line of broward leaders and government
civil rights of gay rights and religion took the stage Tuesday saying it was
important to let the world know that Noggle doesn't speak for the entire county
or even a city of Fort Lauderdale mayor Noggle speaks only for one very small
person himself said County Commissioner Stacy Ritter one of three County
commissioners who be speaking my name is growing quickly against the 16 year
mayor since he was quoted in the South Florida Sun Sentinel on the 4th of July
about the 250 thousand dollar self-cleaning toilet the city planned it later
next for the beach the mayor said one thing you liked about the robotic
commode was its security features the freestanding toilet with the tour
homosexual activity said of course we know that there's no heterosexual couples
ever having sex on the beach either okay that's okay that's also you took your
kids out there long an evening walk on the beach and there was a heterosexual
couple having sex right there in the sand right on the beach that would be okay
that would be good would be good useful a tool for later in life there'll be a
learning experience or maybe a yearning experience Noggle said public restrooms
are plagued by gay sex in Fort Lauderdale even though police said it's not a
problem he also said he doesn't use the term gay because homosexuals are on
happy even though he loves the gay community according to Kenny Walker who's a
retard a just pathetic we got another month and a plus of them all my god
will never survive it we are doomed oh he didn't say that again Noggle didn't
attend the rally Tuesday but he staged his own news conference earlier in the
day and we already been through that and he apologized but not to gay people
apologize to children in parents of the community for not being aware the problem
he said explain that he found websites advising gays to cruise for sex in two
city park restrooms in the turlits I apologize for not bringing this forward
earlier he said maybe some lives could have been saved county property appraised
a Lori parish a lifetime for Lauderdale resident like Noggle said he was spewing
hate and giving the wrong impression that the county doesn't welcome gays that's
why they like him on our morning show because he's a hate spuer he's a hate
spewing idiot on behalf of the public officials in broder county per se
the rally apologize for him not being man enough to do so she said his
comments galvanize the community though Noggle has been criticized for what
some consider outlined his comments in the past former vice mayor Dean Trent
Alice at this time was different people were fed up he said right up to here is
Brian Cox with say remember that right up to here up to where here oh don't
ever take sides with anyone against the family again ever ever this has never
happened before in for Lauderdale he said the crowd we are united for change I
just got a most amusing message on air for some people are ready really defensive
Jesus just a radio show will you please everybody just calm down I got two
hours and five minutes before I get my ass out of here we're just everybody
leave me alone please just a radio show I'm just dealing with you in the
TV room of course two of the mayor's colleagues commissioner Cindy Hutchinson
and vice mayor Carlton Moore spoke out so did well matters mayor head of the ACL
and others this mayor must be treated as the bigot he is urged Matt former
the National Game of the Intense Force that's why Kenny and Bo like him so
much because he's a bigot and a crazy person and make sure that he has shunned
everywhere he goes not allowed to any gathering where decent people are like in a
TV room for example if there's a bunch of guys doing the limbo rock in the
TV room make sure he don't get in County Commissioner Diana Wasserman Rubin
said some people were using the Bible to attack Gays no come on look at back
to you Diana the Jesus I know would love everyone regardless she shouted as the
crowd shared her name is Wasserman Rubin and she's talking about Jesus I don't
know which Jesus these people are talking about that's not my Jesus Wasserman
Rubin didn't sound awfully Jewish to you that I mean not what would I know about
things like that but I mean that sounds really wouldn't you think so I think
she's like you know about Jesus a Jew for Jesus then the giant showing dwarf

30 men no supporters to led by conservative radio talk show is Janet Fogler
a faith to action dot org whoever the hell she is oh Janet Folger she must
be kind to Pete Balfolder someone held aside with the words sin with a circle
in slasherwood on the rally side was a similar poster but the word inside the
circle was hate ban hate ban Jim Noggle ban Kenny and Bo which will be doing
but not soon enough Noggle is said he based his ideas about unhappy Gays on his
miserable friend Norm Kent Kent a lawyer and publisher of National Gays News
out count told the crowd Tuesday I'm a happy gay man hey Norma you're fairy how
like that Norma gets in the story wow overhead probably be getting a message
on here from him too soon overhead planes displayed banners once said

and his partner Anthony need wiki we're in the news in May when they
complain that while in for a lot of the Hollywood airport and employee read
from the Leviticus in the Bible warning that if a man lies with a man they
should be put to that that employee was for remember that story yes you do
of course over the PA was just an accident it was just he was just fun and
just like Jim Noggle he's probably just fun and because Kenny and Bo said he's
just a wonderful guy this is the Neil Roger show this is your brain
food to drink or any questions is this summer movie giving you that uneasy
feeling in a pit of your stomach Harry Potter and the order of fries let the
feast be good something's wrong inside me
I'm asked for this to happen Harry must use his powers to purge the evil
trans fats Harry Potter and the order of fries at the moment he's all been
waiting for everybody just come down to me
partial regurgitation requires 11.021560 WQ I mean just add a little more
mystery you know we're gonna be getting another one of those fart alarm tests
are we yeah so I close the door I could open door if you want to hear all that
crap okay but you don't want to hear they haven't started yet they had the
initial my heavy attention please you know all that so and then pretty soon
they'll be the wheeling the sirens and all that absolutely right like that
just as loud as they can possibly make it don't panic it's just a test but if
there was any change you might be sleeping in all the way there's 11 o'clock
you're sleeping get up you know uh five hundred and seventy four vote on the
pool our goal is uh... six hundred I guess I don't know we don't have a goal
today it's you know my wife has to have a goal who needs a freaking goal right
right exactly who's your favorite Florida born entertainer of all time Jim Morrison
it's pretty good battle here Tom Petty Tom Petty are you people crazy or what
I mean would you think this should be a battle I voted for Jim Morrison but I
gave some thought to Tom Petty he's great had a lot of good songs you put him
in the same league with Jim Morrison is that what you're telling us not what I said
at all is it that what he said Chris or hello there's a
and this will go on for like a half an hour remember the last time they did
just that they got stuck and they couldn't shut the thing off you know
oh just what we needed okay I'm leaving now I had a plane to kick
I'm not leaving for a few hours but a stuck and can't get off yeah that's
what it was anyway Tom Petty one thirteen he's driven by twenty one it's a
horse race Sydney Park T.A. has got the seventy two they call me Mr.
Tibs does anybody say yes and then after that it's a really small potato
that's why the pool is so weak Charlie B I guess because everybody else is
just a sucking hind leg they don't wait thirty three Wesley Snipes twenty five
Ronnie Van Zan twenty five Luther Campbell twenty four and that's all I'm reading
well Daryl Hammond's got twenty one I'm not reading anybody out of twenty isn't
that the way it's supposed to be you don't diddle with anybody under twenty
and Mark Consuelos has got still none and even done even Scott Stantfond
he got one and Donnie Van Zan's got one but Mark Consuelos has still got the
big one speaking of the big block solid five to seven this afternoon repeating
the five to seven from this morning why don't we just play the tape from five
to seven this morning all right because you know he's going to be talking about
Michael Vick and the dolphins camp opens and they just signed this ten-year-old
quarterback that they drafted instead of Brady Quinn because the Brady
is a rumor to be gay whatever the deal is you know but we don't want to be
knocking the dolphin organization because we have the dolphins on our station
now when you have a team on your station you don't knock the organization by the
way we give away those gift certificates or what yes you know I'm kidding I mean
I know but hey I just want to be sure okay I'm just double-checking I'm a
fifteen hundred friends of my space for McGill we're still here if he got
stabbed in the back and fired he'd probably come in and say give me a
verbal pat on the ass building security speaking speaking rich for a
change okay speaking lace for Christchurch you idiot are they done yet or
what now during the test you will hear in other words they're not done yet
it's gonna go on and on although I think you stopped cutting out good well
let's say one word no come on let's have a little verbal intercourse here
that's what you're not cutting out which means that somebody did something on
that and I didn't need to do it all that they just enjoy having me caught
around on my hands in the show playing junior engineer which by the way for five
and a half years I've been a miraculous job how many times have we had to have
the Toronto under come in here like maybe two or three in a whole time I would say
maybe three which is less than once a year and you want to know why why because
I'm a freaking genius man when they give me that money twice a month they may not
think they're getting their money's worth because I'm working like about five
hours a year some like that they're getting their money's worth and then some
and if you want an honest opinion just ask me I'll tell you five five hundred
eighty one vote our goal is five eighty two and Jim Morrison's got a 21
vote leave on Tom Petty we got a pretty good horse race they're considering
we got our goal we got what we got to go good okay that's enough oh speaking
of Jim Nogel again by the way who was a peed on all over this morning on the
Kenny and Voh morning show which is obviously like it what I bet you like that
considering he's in the bathroom business he's definitely the
best but just so his vocamper he's just obsessed with bathrooms and how they
smell and who left the load behind did I ever tell you about my I don't think I
mentioned on the air I wrote about it to one of my correspondence on there to
my favorite online correspondent who's very defensive today but nevertheless
about my uncle read what about it I never talked about you never know I had an
uncle read my father's brother okay he was the black sheep of the family I'm
sure he's long since dead so I can talk about it on the air but anyway every few
years when I was a kid he would show up at the house and he was you know kind of
a Yehu kind of guy and I never I never like kind of a red Nikki kind of guy red
he had red here so that's why they called him red be helpful got it red got it
and anyway the only there's only one thing I remember about him besides the
fact that he looked really a smarmy and like he hadn't bathed in a very long
time and probably hadn't is that he didn't I guess he wasn't really used to
flush toilets all that much okay because every time he would use the commode
ahead of you you go in there would be a surprise waiting for you in the bowl
every not not once in a while every time so maybe he didn't know what that little
handle was there on the side you know maybe just couldn't handle it at least he
was consistent I'll say that for him you always left you a big surprise oh geez
yeah I mean it's not it's not pleasant looking at your own is not a really
pretty sight but have it to go in here and look at somebody else's waiting for
you like oh man one good thing though I guess for my health standpoint it
wasn't red oh anyway a little more on Jim Nogel because you've got so much
positive ask kissing this morning by Kenny and Bowen our anxious morning show
I mean just kissy kissy kissy licky licky licky for a lot of day I'll

recommend that rest of the maximum prison term of 99 years and pay 10 grand
and fines of stock by prosecutors on each of the four convictions the punishment
exceeds the range for secondary felonies but because rest of his criminal record
includes two convictions for secondary felonies committed as a juvenile
prosecutors were able to seek punishment usually reserved for first-degree
felonies judge William Bosworth I wonder if he's kind of Tom Bosley judge William
Bosworth immediately sends rest of who showed little emotion he will not be
eligible for proletelies served at least 30 years including the two years he's
been jailed since his arrest rest of the climate the request of his tearful
mother fever attorney Shelley Fowler his court appointed backup counsel said
she wasn't surprised by the verdict since he admitted the charges on the
stand I expected it to be a large number of followers said it's difficult to
represent yourself since you don't know what you can and can't say on the
stand my hands were cut and tied his teenage accuser now 17 city was pleased with
the verdict the start telegram usually does not name accusers in sex crime cases

a pool they've seated six hundred who would have ever who would have
thunk it next time I hear anybody say who to think it my presence I'm gonna
put a crap away just just ungineral principle doesn't it and though you who

supposed to be funny well it is whatever supposed to be clever supposed to be very
clever who to think it it's it's a sports kind of thing it's the same the same
people use all those sports cliches Jimmy goes yard you know walk off home run

I'm a new one I'm gonna start promoting the hell out of Joseph's and the
thunder everybody about those certificates I mean we want to be able to give
some useful information you know as opposed to what we usually do which is
read the poll which is useless information but man people are attracted to it
like stink on a on a vocamper I don't know I just I mean I've I've discussed
that before I told you that time in West Palm Beach when I had a very in WGNL
a very grotesque anxious it was my stomach I guess you know because I lost all
that weight I lost a hundred pounds a year then I started eating again and my
inner is what used to all that the you know that a pack of food and they weren't
like digesting properly I don't know what the excuse was but anyway it was
really bad it was an embarrassingly bad and so I'm in the hallway and one of the
salespeople goes in there and came running out and said oh my god near you
want to believe what it smells like in there somebody must have died in there
I said oh geez not of course admitting that it was me well I mean would you ever
admit that you were the one that done it no not me well there is a Dana
bash well I said there are about a half a dozen people it's seen in I'd like to

up the ramp of the guard house you identify Joseph says you destination
drive halfway around the circle of the Joseph Center I'll give that again

there's another one bullets flying all over the place like a bunch of crazy
people are running around and you want to know why because there are and a
crazy you are probably the more likely you got a bunch of guns but you can't say
that because America just loves guns more endowed rights to column in the New
York Times is this yesterday or today I guess yesterday but I was not in the
area yesterday and did you read it no but why not I was busy don't tell me you're
taking phone calls all day every day are you really yes we have 22 minutes to
go and then we open up the WQM store WQM dot com and Joseph's on the water is
gonna be a we got 50 one hundred dollar for the circus and they only cost you
fifty bucks a piece of safe half on a really a nifty meal what are you guys
eating I'm having some Kalamari oysters Rockefeller the lobster biscuit I'm
sipping on but he also brought a whole bunch of other dishes that I might go
and yeah he's really nice guy but what about Chris with the Russian girlfriend
they want to be having a lamb or something they haven't brought it over yet
Mary brought a little lamb is it making buying sounds are you like you like you
shearing it no he's sharing it and you're cutting out really bad now I can't
and we can't even communicate yeah it's like that only worse because it just
cuts out for like you know a whole word anyway marine dad says brothers and
sisters that's the name of a column in yesterday's New York Times he says W
is Odyssey is one of the audacity in history a black sheep who left above the
expectations and crashed back down it must be a crushing burden for president
Bush who have brought the opposite of what he intended in so many profound ways
for me one of the most amazing reversals brought about by W's reign of error is
this he may have turned my sister into a Democrat as a girl Peggy Shivered in
the bitter culture a cultist John Kennedy's inaugural speech and when she saw
Deputy D. Bohn and Richards and they Texas debated on before she thought this guy
will be the greatest president since JFK he's so good looking bright he's got
everything going for him she volunteered in the Republican invention in 2000
totalling a W stands for women's side I stuck into her into the press
planet breakfast with George and Laura and had a tackler when to the
Constanation report she began cheering as if at a redskins game she flew to
vice Virginia to work a phone bank for W she set up all election night in vain
she cut back on Christmas presents to give him money and probably displayed
pictures of herself at fundraisers one with W one with Dick Cheney she cancelled
her time subscription when I wrote about the rigged buildup to the Iraq war and
called Bush world my chronicle of W's war preality that silly book she wants
told her to be part of that she couldn't totally choose W over me because she
knew if she were dying he wouldn't come and hold my hand on a marine will so
imagine my surprise when she started talking about voting for Barack Obama or
John Edwards if they stopped pussy-footing around Hillary W is loyalty to
Cheney as her dispresence she says sadly when Cheney picked himself as
vice president W should have said bug off he could have made his own bank
when instead of choosing leftovers if only he had bowed his father listened
to Paul and said a Cheney rumsold on Iraq not only is W brought himself down
he's brought down John McCain who I wanted to support but can't because of the
war I grew up in the shadow of water reading was used to seeing service men
without limbs but recently after watching a special on soldiers coming home
for a rack with brain injuries I picked up a picture of my four nephews and I
know how I'd feel if they had fought in Iraq and came home without limbs or in
body bags we're spending billions on this war yet veterans and their children
are practically getting nothing I'm no longer Republicans you said I'm an
American I'll cast my vote for the person I believe will start the process to
get out of Iraq unless of course it's Hillary I knew my family's cocky red
state of mind had changed one of my orally-esque brothers used a mocking
nickname for W and expressed disgust about Iraq another Kevin praises W on
the economy but not an immigration noting that our father who came from Ireland
in steerage at 19 had a fight in W W wonder when citizenship the secret key to
the puzzle is the word illegal he says he supports W on Iraq but argues that
but agrees that one of the president's greatest assets loyalty is turned into
his Achilles heel when I started my sales career and older rep advised me stay
away from the mean drinkers in the bar they start to fight but someone else
always gets hit George Bush is getting hit because he won't move away from
mean drinkers he said the word neocon bother me because I have a diversion
of solitary continues an uncomfortable visual of chainy wolf wits and rum
spelled manning the situation room in a scene reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove and
general Buck turgid- turgid son no more than 10 to 20 million killed tops
so depending on their breaks began to haunt me how could we have underestimated
the post-war situation Iraq so badly as our intelligence that bad or do
the people make decisions even care the Republicans got exactly what they
deserve in last election he said they fell on the same sword they had brilliantly
wielded the game power Tom delay was his corrupt as Jim right to any
hand to his anept as Tom Foley even as the moral I state Kevin Warns Democrats
memoed an anti-inherry a default blind date to the promise not the basis for
long-term relationship my sister still has a picture of W up but chainy is
face down in the laundry room
hello very good morning you watching beta series 24 a summer of news we'll begin
by translating the rhetoric of the latest speech from President Bush I believe
we can succeed in Iraq and I know we must translation my ego won't allow me to
admit failure so I'm running out the clock until 2009 or impeachment so
goal shared by the Iraqis and our coalition partners a decent number of
mostly living Iraqis agree as well as 34 soldiers from Estonia I like to
fish on this sentence he could be speaking literally but we believe this is
either secret code to his evangelical base or another failed reference 9-11
all these extremist groups would be involved in by precipitous American withdrawal
which would confuse and frighten friends and allies in the region meaning that
the American army just up and left without telling anyone the 34 soldiers from
Estonia would be confused and alone
bases throughout the Middle East have a stake in stable Iraq
translation like any good mafia so dick cheney has given Middle Eastern
countries a small cut of the action as we remove our oil from underneath their
sand I look forward to picking back nose actually right there he's just being
literal thank you very much
okay 13th of noon so many facets is for the pull how about Debbie Harry from
Blondie was born right here in Miami we want to put Debbie Harry on her sure we
do about Harry Harry and Debbie Harry Harry
Carrie Debbie Harry now you know they've got a bad thing to say now and I'm this
is this because the QM stores and open it is it because we have some kind of a
crash on the thing or what because I'm clicking on it and won't open maybe it's
because it's not open yet no that's not the way it works schmuck okay I don't
know well I'm just telling you it's because you never clicked on what about you
Chris are you able to get on it yeah I want you QM got you are clicked on
deals have price deals and it went right to the page well I'm not what those
are all about I can't get in 40 seconds I'm a good friend 11 minutes and 40
seconds until I don't really care about that what I care about is how come I can't
get on it now you probably screwed something up
yeah it's always me isn't it yep always me because I'm just in it and
the incompetent and idiotic and and I'm making like three thousand fifty
cents an hour like you are Chris I wish I was making that much that was like a
little shot okay let me just take a puket what we got here who's your favorite
Florida born to entertain it of all time how many vote we got six fifty
boy that's pretty weak that is really weak and I know George is gonna push
the hell out of it and I wanted to are the aren't you not what is it what Jim
Morrison 151 and Tom Petty 131 to 20 vote apart we got a pretty good race
there I would say I mean there's no contest I mean Tom Petty couldn't lick
Jim Morrison's ass although probably now would wouldn't who would want to
anyway right no even if he were still alive 151 to 131 Sydney Poytty's got 80 are
you eating is that what you know it oh for a great sake I'm clicking on
that open now thing and I'm talking to you nothing I'll talk to my mouth for
it's always worked in the past Chris what could the problem possibly be I think
they're overloading it I think it's just you well if you're overloading and how
come he can get on there I'll tell you I think you did someone there's one wrong
I click on where it says in the arrived you're showing my every face comes up
there with that stupid bio and a whole deal but if I click on that open now it's
is and I nothing happens maybe they're blocking Canadian user and eat yeah
maybe Canadian users are getting blood must be it not
fate anyways got 36 Wesley stifes 29 Ronnie van Zant 27 Gerald Ham and 26 Luther
Campbell 25 and nobody else has got even 20 so strictly a two-house race so I
guess we're gonna have to leave it up to Chris because he's the only one who can
get on at damn thing am I right about that sure okay we'll leave it in your
capable hands okay when we get to noon keep keep your eye peeled on that
and see how fast those certificates go for Joseph will do well I'm a little
nervous about leaving something that important up to you but I'm sure you can
handle it okay I can handle it put a lot of pressure Oscar the cat now what is
it why are you playing that just I'm later yeah I know who it is nobody
I don't want to hear it's on Oscar the cat seems to have an uncanny
knack for predicting when nursing home patients are going to die by
curling up next to them during their final hours his accuracy observed in
25 cases as let the staff to call family members once he has chosen someone it
usually means they have less than four hours to live oh my god don't let this
cat curl up next to you or you're a dead man you'll be singing on time over here
he does make too many mistakes he seems to understand when patients are about
to die so Dr. David Dosa in the interview he describes a phenomenon in a
poignant essay in today's issue of the New England Urinal of Medicine many
family members take some solace from it he said they appreciate the
companionship that the cat provides for their dying loved one said Dosa a
geriatrician and assistant professor medicine at Brown University the two
year old feline was adopted as a kitten grew up in a third floor dementia unit
at the Steer House nursing and rehabilitation center how do you like that in a
third floor dementia unit the facility treats people with Alzheimer's
Parkinson's other illnesses after about six months the staff noticed that Oscar
would make his own rounds just like the doctors and nurses he'd sniff and
observe patients and then sit beside people who wind up dying in just a few
hours if the kitty cat comes to visit your ass you're gonna be dead soon dose
to said Oscar seems to take his work seriously is generally a loof this is not a
cat that's friendly to people he said I wonder if there's like maybe a
connection to dying because the cat comes to visit them you think maybe as
opposed to him being so like psychic and crap
he wears such a clown Oscar is better predicting death than the people who
work there said Dr. Joan Tenno a Brown University who treats patients at the
nursing home as an expert on care for the terminal ill she was convinced of
Oscar's talent when he made his 13th correct call while observing one patient
Tenno said she noticed the woman wasn't eating was breathing with difficulty
and their legs had a bluish tinge signs that often mean that death is near a
bluish tinge that might like to start a good sign I have bloomed in their legs and
bluish stock then what can I do Oscar wouldn't stay in South of the room most
so Tenno thought his streak was broken instead it turned out that doctor's
prediction was roughly 10 hours to early sure enough during the patient's
final two hours nurses told Tenno that Oscar joined the woman at her bedside
just before she croaked doctor say most of the people get a visit from the
sweet face gray and white cat are so early probably don't know he's there so
patients are not worth it is a harbinger of death most families are grateful for
the advanced warning though one wanted us to run out of the room while the
family member died while Oscar is put outside he paces in me houses this
pleasure no one is certain of Oscar's behavior scientifically significant or
points to a cause Tenno wonders if the can notices tell-tale sense of the
behavior of the nurses who raised him Nicholas Dobbin who directs an animal
behavior clinic at Tufts University coming school of veterinary medicine and
has read those his article said the only way to know is to carefully document
how Oscar divides this time between the living and the dying the living in
those who are yelling I'm dying over here if Oscar really is a fully a furry
grim reaper all under these kind of the grim reaper Robert creeper the grim
reaper the board sure if I still really is a furry grim reaper now you say
that because George is eating or what no right here no both of them it's also
possible to be able to be given myself senator pleasures like a heated blanket
placed on a dying person don't mention nursing home staffers are concerned
but explaining Oscar so long as he gives families a better chance of saying goodbye
to the dying Oscar recently received a wall plaque publicly committing his
compassionate hospice care he got a wall plaque the cat that's America for
you baby all the Shfinery all the time Shfinery right now a good word I think
somebody made that up I think a lot of words that I have heard in my lifetime
I think my family just made him up probably my mother especially 669 votes on

Well, why didn't you say it just like holding one and you're still talking? I mean I touch you nine you're talking you're cutting out
Still by the way really bad they better check that out before like you know only got four days until I work again till Tuesday
Oh, we got plenty of time. Oh, and by the way speaking to that
The following week I don't work at all you are aware of that aren't you if you got that marked on the calendar
See that that first week in August that vacation ordinarily would be like hey great. I'm on vacation
But it's not a big deal because I'm getting this like an extra two days off. I never told us your second whole week
The first week in August I don't work
That has to be clear. I'm sorry. We can't say yes or no yet
Well
Well, what I want to say and this isn't really the first week because the first of August is Wednesday
So so the following Tuesday and Thursday you won't hear me. I mean, you know
You can sit there and wait here me, but you won't you won't hear me you won't see me you won't feel me you want to smell me
Got it. How many we got left still seven a
Refreshing right now
Yeah, oh back up at 12 so someone else couldn't handle it
It's back up to 12. Yeah, which means someone thought they could handle it and then you know went back up again
Yeah, they were just slow and filling it out and it said too bad so that I
Still can't get on it. I feel that that's 95% of the fun of this view for me is
Looking at the thing and watching the things tick off it or you know, I'm getting a little ticked off myself not being able to get on there
See you're a lawyer
Now what would the reason be for that is a is it a computer thing?
Taliban
What yeah, it's the terrorist paladam. It's the tourist. Oh in the al-Qaeda. It's al-Qaeda done it
I'll kind of put on you all's problem about tied it into our feet either al-Qaeda or al-Ranger's one or the other
A university Colorado professors have been fired after a two-year saga with the university
Which the professor was accused of plagiarism and research misconduct they don't like his attitude man because he's got a big mouth
And he tells it like it is
The CU board of Regents announced it's eight to one vote to fire award Churchill just after 5.35 p.m
On Tuesday bringing the day long executive session to an end
Churchill's attorney David Lane said he'll file a civil rights lawsuit against the school accusing Colorado University
Of violating his free speech rights
Within a year hopefully we'll have a trial lane said we're out of kangaroo court and going to a real court
And that's a plus for today. I'm going to know where Churchill said he ain't going to go away easy
If Churchill wins the lawsuit Lane said the school can end up by paying Churchill's legal fees and they have to reinstate him
Today's message is there'll be payback for free speech lane added the board said an academic misconduct
As is reason for firing Churchill Churchill support is met him with t-shirt signs and drums following the board's decision
Lane said he and his client are now on the offense Churchill received one of your salary as a tenured professor following his dismissal
See what officials said how many we got left Chris 15
Well, what are you talking about the thing is going back up again now?
Yeah, well the stuff said that if their credit card is declined then he went back into the queue and you're cutting out real bad again now
So you got 15 of those left there hundred dollars gives you to get certificates for 50 bucks for Josephson water
15 of them left. That's not a good sign. Although it's only trouble wait exactly
Just calm down take your time and I only wish I could see it the count because you could you could be making it up
You could say oh, we got all 50 left
Why would I do that just to be an ass?
nah
white
Well, representative Mark Udell supported the board's decision to fire Churchill in a release statement academic freedom goes hand in hand with freedom of speech
Even the most controversial unpopular views will inevitably find a safe haven in our colleges and universities
That doesn't mean all ideas are equal and for sure that inflammatory ideas are beyond reproach
Nerd is excused teachers of professors for ordering nonsense and calling an instruction
He added that Churchill's actions went far beyond giving voice to represent reprehensible points of view
And that is dismissal was about a academic conduct
Within minutes of an 8 a.m. Meeting Tuesday the CEO board of Regents decided to go to executive session to discuss whether the fire Churchill
Churchill and Lane argued their case before the board
But they said they wanted to do it publicly, but the board voted to go into executive session behind closed doors to hear the case
But a beep bit of boot put about what there's no such thing as freedom of speech anymore
We know that so what else is this guy thinking about freedom of speech my ass. That's ancient history in America
Maybe in Canada we got freedom of speech or like in needle-ons places like that where
Maybe in Denmark Sweden
Norway
Finland places like that maybe they have a certain amount of freedom of speech not in America no more. It's in the past
It's in the rear
Just look in your rear view mirror and you'll see freedom all over the place
695 votes. We're gonna make 700 easy. Now what was our goal 8 million? I don't care what it was
I'm just ticked off that I still can't see that thing are we still at 15?
Yes, you know what I'm thinking I'm thinking about other people. Oh, we're at 14 a lot of other people can't get on this thing either
I have no problem with it so well you have no problem. Okay. I'm having a problem and the fact that this is kind of dragging a little bit
I mean that that's not a good sign
I think people are having a problem. They're clicking on it. I'll find out what's over the website
Yeah, this is Josh Curtis's website. I think maybe a little bit too much hanky
Thank you with a Russian girlfriend after you took to Vegas after you came back and make sure that George
Didn't the pochki around with the goods

It would have been thinking but he wasn't paying any attention. He was eating the free food. Did not sell it?
What did not sell it 700 you must have cut out. What do we got now?
699 no, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about so you're gonna all your numbers messed up. That's the problem. 14
14
Just a number day today. What can I say?
14 that's not very many votes
How much of I clicked that view current again. It's gonna go over 700. Let me see
Okay, I said 699 not too good. Okay, I'm gonna with dispense with playing a bit right now
So I can straighten this thing out for you. We got an young left and the reason I was able to get on there
Yeah, yeah, you with me. There's a problem with the link. There's a problem with the link the link it's stink
And you know, which way were you clicking on the one underneath the my picture?
And I hope I'm gonna sign a bigger burn
Well, that's one that I used to get to it and there was a problem with it. Okay, Mr. Hot shot, Mr. Faso
That one I'm clicking and now let's see this is anything no, but if you click the near Roger show and you go down on the right hand side
And just not all that far down on the right hand side
There's another thing and it works fine QA and half price deals and there's Joseph's on the yada yada and there's six six left
Well, I got a idea on that's what I just clicked and I checked on two other computers during the break and all those were connecting fine
So I'm just telling you right now, Mr. Hot shot. See why would I make it up?
Have it I've been telling you since the quarter of that the thing doesn't work. Haven't I been telling you that yes?
We know what's working fine. Yeah, well great. I'm glad it works for you. You're in the building great
Six times this time. Yeah, I'm two hundred miles away and it doesn't work nished from here. Okay, not for me
The building would have nothing to do with it. Let me try it again. Well, whatever
Being on the same server whatever the deal is I haven't got the fogiest clue
I just tried it again. No way no dice. I'm clicking that other one there
Why if you click my picture there if you can handle it and go to that page and on the right hand column
You'll see the thing there. Neils have price deals with green and blue and orange and all of this stuff all of these
You know how that goes all of these things that's right and
There's the thing there's the page and says six there's six left
And I guarantee you there wouldn't be any left if we you know if this thing was working for everybody would but I'll take your work for now
There's nine see
Because they check them out we find out there's a bunch of deadbeats out there like Bokobrine, you know
Bokobrine and now there's nine
Yeah, yeah, I think he's probably got his finger in it would be the first place. He's had that finger back home Robert
That's Robert creepier the grim reepier the Lord of the board on a station. It's badly hoarded
Oh, it's gonna be so good winter row starts now what day's that gonna be tomorrow?
Okay, are you still eating or what no between feeding right now waiting for to
You're between feedings. Yeah, they just keep bringing it. It's it's insane really and I can't stop eating it because it's good so
And the price is right you know it and the price is right on these certificates too if we can get rid of these last nine
I
Don't like to drag this thing out especially when I'm leaving at one o'clock wouldn't be bad if I dragged it all the way up
One o'clock. Oh, it'll give me something to talk about
Well, what do you mean by that? Are you suggesting I don't know how to talk about one one how to that?
What they would yeah, that's what I'm suggesting what day was that show that it will give me something to talk about
I'm talking about
You're not everything everybody says all the time. I'll speed your senility now as opposed to playing that got off a music
You like to just devastate the audience with right?
I
Well, I keep refreshing this thing and it I think moving you know, I got the page though. That's a good news still about nine
I'm off
Well, it's dog days, you know, it's July 26th your fault
Hey, it must be my fault must because I'm on now George was on they've been gone in two shakes of lambs to whatever that means
Isn't that right they say that more states are bucking the national crackdown on sex offenders
That's bucking by pairing back punishment for teenagers who have consensual sex with underage partners
Governors in seven states have signed bills the past two months
It means no prosecution for some teens or no requirement to register as a sex offender states very widely
How they prosecute consensual teen sex which prosecuted referred to as Romeo and Juliet cases Romeo and Julietta
But some remain tough on teens are several years older than their partners illegal
I'd you consent varies from 14 to 18 depending on the state
The issue is through debate recently through the Georgia case of Gianarlo Wilson 21 boy
We heard a lot about that he's serving a 10-year sentence for receiving all sex from a 15-year-old girl at a New Year's party
He was 17 she was 15 and they threw him in a slamer for 10 years only in America baby
The only thing worse he could add was maybe like a pin joint
Then he got like life he got an electric chair the Georgia Supreme Court heard arguments Friday whether to release some last Friday
Officials in some states say tough law should be changed as Georgia to last year to focus on
Predator is not irresponsible teenagers. I was that interesting irresponsible. How about horny teenagers?
Is that redundant? I have imagined they say those teens need to be punished for labeling them as sex offenders on public
Registries may do more harm than good. Let's capture the truly 10% of our predators at Allison Taylor
Executive director the Texas Council on sex offender treatment and independent governor appointed board
She says June all offenders are less likely than adults to commit another sex crime and more receptive to treatment
This month Texas revamped how it classifies sex offenders Taylor says some teens were getting lower risk rating and not have to register
The changes in some states including Oklahoma mirror a federal law that states must implement by 2009
The Adam Walsh act outlines who must register but exempts teens convicted of consensual sex if the age difference is no more than four years
And the younger one is at least 13 states can be stricter. So in other words if the chick is 14 and the guy is like 19
No good the age difference has to be no more than four years got it got it if she's like 16 and he's 20
He's going to the slamer. No no more than four years. How about if he's 20 and a half?
Okay, see what I'm saying I understand stupid Arizona will end the registration for some why not to young
Eight eight you're suggesting eight for consensual sex. No, I'm suggesting eight
eight
That's what I got I just I double check nothing. I'll believe you about a double-check you don't believe me
I don't why do you just know jump about could to I know that that's what that's what that's called us told me
Arizona will end registration for some convicted teens or not will not require registration of the sex partners
And no more than five years apart age in Florida teens may potentially keep their names off the registry if the age gap is within four years
It depends on how big the gap is
Other state limits limit when they will prosecute Indiana will not prosecute teens if they're in a dating relationship and the age gap is four years or less
Connecticut will not prosecute the age gap is three years or less up from two years
I
mean you really think if it's anybody's business
No, they're like he's like 19 and she's a 16 or 15. Why is anybody's business? Oh, cuz that's the law
It's the law. I see maybe I'll have to play that all I want to play read a book again before I leave two three more times
As many states passed up a laws on sex offenders that include law minimum sentences like time electronic modern ring even the death penalty some law
Make his a reluctant to ease punishment. It's a sensitive issue says Democratic state senator Don Betzold of Minnesota
He says some lawmakers don't want to be seen as soft on crime others want to overt unintended consequences of the sweeping crack down on sex offenders
He pushed a bill that we remove the sex registry requirement for some kids under 16 it passed the state Senate
But died in the house similar measures failed to pass this year in Maine in New Hampshire
Some law make you say there should be some
Consequences for teens there should be some recognition. This is wrongful behavior
So Connecticut state representative Arthur O'Neill a Republican of course
We have a problem with older boys taking advantage of younger girls. How about if older girls take advantage of younger boys?
How about that? That's good. That's good. That's a good thing right? Right?
Having some of them is always good boys take advantage of younger boys. How about that?
He's not bad. That's bad. Yeah. It was disgusting
Such a
Mercy for the tea room all the water they all right for in Jim Noggle and can I can he walk or are

Either do well, it slows it down when people are going on air with bogus credit cards or whatever
You know bogus people with bogus stories and bogus lives, you know, I mean
No, what do you mean? I don't know
Now house judiciary committee voted to contempt the Congress citations Wednesday against what house chief is to have Josh Bolton president Bush's former legal counselor
Harry admires that the partially
The 22 the 17 party line vote which would sanction the pair for favor to comply with subpoenas on the fairings of several federal prosecutors
Advanced the citation to full house a
Senior Democratic official who spoke on the condition of an anemones said the house itself likely would take up the citations after the Congress's
August recess committee chairman John Conier said the panel had nothing to lose by advancing the citations
Because it wouldn't allow the president to lead to flood Congress authority
Republicans warned that a contempt citation would lose and federal court even forgot that far
But a bit bit of a bit about the heartage and impure tree
Like I said, no freedom of speech no more laws no more anything. It's just they make it up as they go along
That's the Bush F and way
Well, we still got nine. I guess like I said, I'm not you know Chris can keep an eye on it. You got your eye on it? Of course
I got my own this term is so that they just writing. Oh, that sounds really good. It is really good

And who and Ken Ken block he's another one
Yeah, huh you enjoy seeing those people yeah a lot in
In Mondays debate with the benefit of having time to think through her response. This is a Katrina vanden who elimination
Why Obama got it right?
Hillary Clinton poses the foreign policy sophisticated to Barack Obama the bold leader who didn't hesitate to say that he would meet with the leaders of Cuba
Iran North Korea Siri and Ben-Athawala
My colleague David Kornar used that a BAM was committed a major blunder reflecting his life a foreign policy experience
My colleague area Berman posted his smart and sharp counter to David's argument on behalf of those like Hillary Clinton
Who are steeped in the nuances language and minefields of foreign policy but I feel strongly enough to weigh in on this debates his Katrina
Those nuances in minefields can also be trapped
Witness how far Clinton's nuanced experience got her when confronted with the 2002 Iraq war resolution
David may well be right that Obama's opponents will try to exploit his response
But from a foreign policy point of view was Obama's response so wrong and Clinton so right?
Her husband's administration generally followed Hillary's approach during his two terms president Clinton did not meet with the del Castro
Hoover Chavez or with leaders of Iran Siri and North Korea while generally pursuing a policy of friend isolate these countries
But what did the Clinton approach actually accomplish the respective regimes of Castro and Cuba and Chavez and Venezuela
But only going stronger and more influential all through Latin America
Although Syria was forced to withdraw military forces from Lebanon last year the regime of Bashar Assad as his firmly in French and powers was his fathers and
In spite of the odious politics and qualities of Osmedina jet Iran carries more weight in the Middle East today
That it didn't nearly 90s while American power and standing had declined considerably
Indeed both Clinton and Bush may have missed a historic opportunity to open a new chapter with Iran when reformer
Mohammed Kati me was elected 97
And President Clinton taken the bold step of that was suggested and met with pre without pre-conditioned with
President Kati me and I D.E.R.9 instead of pursuing sanctions might not that democratic reformers be in power in Iran
Might not we have a healthy and growing trading relationship with an economically reformed Iran might Iran have kept its nuclear program
And cooperated with us and managing regional relations including the peaceful downfall of Saddam Hussein
We don't know because the foreign policy sophisticated thought it was too politically risky for Clinton to make such a bold move
Above all foreign policies matter simultaneously projecting American confidence and American humility and
Signalling that he was willing to meet with leaders of these countries Obama was signaling that the US has the confidence in its values to meet with anyone
But he also signals certain humility that reflects the understanding that's an ex-president
Must reach out to the rest of the world a not merely issue conditions from the White House and threaten military force if it
Does not get its way
That's what Katrina says Katrina vanden who a hooverly editor of the nation you go Katrina
But of course Barack Obama they're gonna, you know, whether Osama
Barack Obama and all this every every time he far its it's gonna be the wrong flavor no matter what flavor it was no matter
What he had for breakfast. It's always gonna be the wrong flavor
You know I'm saying what he said and that's because in a racist country like America
He tends to be the wrong flavor. He's got an uphill battle. I mean I'm all for him. I'm 10,000 percent for him
I mean I think he's I mean Dennis Kucinich obviously is great in what he says, but he's you know with the weakest link
He's two feet tall. He's got a bad hair piece. He talks like Jolly, you know other than that. He's a dynamite candidate
He says all the right things but nobody takes him seriously. You know what I mean by that?
Now we're back up to eight on that thing what I think is bouncing up and down back and forth
You people you deadbeats out there with the no good credit cards quit trying to buy stuff
Don't you go see get the feeling that's what's going on. I yeah something's up. We might have
Well, this happens every week sure
But the fact that we still have eight left that doesn't please me in the least but as first we have to you've been

The food that you're still eating still eating this tiramisu still sucking down a free food. Oh, yes
When you're making the big bucks. That's right
Now let's see what do we got left we got still stuck on
A fractured or something why I don't know there got to be a glitch. There's got to be a glitch
I know I had a glitch. Yeah, let me say it again
If you scratch it on there the regular way just click on my ugly picture in the upper left hand corner
Works as the nea larger show and when you get to that page with my ugly face on it in the right hand column
You'll find that the thing and that one works that link works
I mean Chris is trying to give me a bunch of crap
You know, but then is there anything new about that?
That Thompson's got to calm. Although certainly wouldn't it be remiss if I didn't read this not all that long
The tyrannical reign of King George duck Thompson on Capitol Hill blue dot com which has always been Georgia's very favorite political web
Yes
He says bush wins because Congress does nothing and I would say as usual he is
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez returned to Capitol Hill Tuesday and he'll be always does when he testifies before Congress
He lied
Gonzalez lied so often that reporting the fact that he lied as no longer news if the Attorney General's lips are moving
You can bet he's lying his latest round of lies
claiming he didn't breathe lawmakers about a terrorist surveillance program directly
Comfort it's a four-page memo from the Office of National Intelligence Director's Office showing that Gonzalez did in fact
Discuss the program with a congressional leaders angry senators including Republican Arlen Spectre said they may need a special prosecutor
To bring Gonzalez to justice for perjury. Yeah, right
It is a fact that Gonzalez lies. It's also a fact that nothing will be done about it because Congress in the West is led by a democratic party that talks a big game
But can't deliver in the clutch
Kind of like Joel Feinberg talks a big game can't deliver in the clutch
Gonzalez has been caught lying so many times that he should have lost his job months ago yet here he is
We turn to the hell to lie some more
Over in the house the jenny's year a community voted to site former White House counsel Harry admirers
Might our chief of staff Josh Bolton for contempt for refusing to testify about they politically motivated firing of US attorneys big deal
The White House is already announced that it will not allow the justice department to investigate any such content
Nor will the department be allowed to enforce the will of Congress
Yes, there's a pattern here Congress blows a lot of hot air president George W. Bush goes on his merry way
Congress votes to bring the troops home from Iraq Bush veto is the bill it goes back to the Hill but Democrats don't have the votes to sustain a veto
Congress passed a law Bush doesn't like he amends the bill with a signing statement that says allow us him to ignore any provision of the bill he doesn't like
Over the last six years Bush has found a lot of things he doesn't like in bills coming out of Congress and
Mended more than through signing statements than any president in history Congress bitches and moans and then doesn't do anything
The court find Bush's action is domestic spying program unconstitutional Bush ignores the court ruling and proceeds and the court does nothing
And six years Bush aided and evaded by price president Dick Cheney and the politically devious Carl Rove
Has turned the presidency in an absolute monarchy that answers to no one not to Congress not to the courts and not to
Constituutions certainly not to the people
Congress moans and frets and does nothing some Democratic House members want to impeach Bush and Cheney house speaker Nancy Pelosi says no impeachment is off the table
Senator Russ Fangle wants Bush at least sent you to have the Senate but majority leader Harry Reid says no
Last November voters in this country put the Democrats in charge of Congress of the mandate to do something about the despotic rule of George
W. Bush and said the Democrats like the corrupt Republican leadership that covered for Bush for 12 years did nothing
It's time for a third choice. That's what Doug Thompson say. How about that Thompson for prison?
Okay, I'll take it and Michael Moore for a V. Okay

You see that movie yet. So that's what you did. Yes. It's no Magnolia, but then what is?
What could be I can't believe the way you just rip and tear it at that movie?
I don't know why you got such a bug. I can't believe how you keep making up what I say still eight votes on the eight not eight votes
Still a certificate slug for Joseph son of water

Maybe they're just not listening to me maybe because guilty was on or because
Danielle Cole has won a diamond engagement ring for five years since shortly before she and her fiance moved in together
There was surprise she was pregnant at the time
Otherwise she and Christopher a fiener would probably be long-murried by now

They need to send these stars from breathe and they need to go, go, go
Then they lower hand and power a silt and jump
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Britney thinks she's fine
But she out of her mind
They've been sent a back and breathe

One o'clock, 5'60m WQAM, I'm here talking about the similarities between cooking and doing what we do with Joseph Sayer last name officially
Maggi
Maggi?
So that's all right, we'll need to say, we were first we were saying Maggi and then Maggi and I guess those are Zoroastrian priests like the ones that visited Jesus
And then Maggi, we were saying Maggi, where are you from?
Originally New Haven Connecticut
You're having Connecticut, what ethnicity is that name? Is that like Italian?
It's Italian
Excellent
And the food is excellent, we're going to talk about that in a second
But yeah, whenever people come into the studio we've had a lot of guests these days restaurant guests and so I've had that conversation with several of the chefs that have been in here
This is pretty amazing how you guys do this and I say it's exactly the same thing that you guys do in a kitchen especially when you're a chef mixing all these elements together at a certain time, amounts and times
And things like that because I did the cooking thing although it's not the same thing that you do because you're an actual, you know, we were just following a procedure
You guys are creative, hopefully like we are over here
So you asked me how long I've been in the radio business, how long have you been chef-ing, how long have you been cooking?
Well actually I haven't been cooking
Yeah, tell them now for a number of years
Tell them you're busy, you're doing an important radio interview right now
Hey, mine goes off all the time too, you saw me text and I'll join this show
I grew up with this fun business, my whole life I was making pizzas from 11 years old to 16 years old
And my friend is restaurant Connecticut
Heated's a business
Really? That's funny business, because I hated talk radio when I get into it, I don't want to quit
Yeah, that's bizarre, then the Neil thing happened, that's another story, we'll talk about that some other day
But you have, because the copy here, we didn't know anything about you until we started doing this for you
This is not your first restaurant, Joseph's on the water
No, we have a fish grill in Dainia for 21 years
Okay
And then in 01 sold it, took two years sabbatical
And then in 03 the people on the board of directors at the Hemisphere's complex in Helen Dale got a hold of me
Have known me for many many many years and asked me if I'd be interested in coming over there
They had one of their restaurants coming available and I hadn't even heard of the first place
Yeah, he got, I'm sorry
Sound off like you have a pair
Yeah, were you in the military?
No
No, neither, neither, neither, neither
Well, you're a popular guy, I'm sorry
At least I put my phone on silent, so when I got text from my mistress, it doesn't die due to you on the air
I'm very excited about going there, my wife is too
Thank you, appreciate it
We'll flip a coin to see who gets to go first
And the Hootsies are probably going to want to go there
Well, you know, we had that big data, I showed you the presentation, over there
Everybody was so warm and wonderful and now we are talking about stage 2
Either with the same Hootsies or with a different pair
Maybe one's on the air
Maybe Josh will come
I thought you meant maybe Breece you walked in here
Yeah, very nice girl
Very nice girl and so I'm talking about taking her and Lucy Lopez down
Well, we want to mix it up, take them to new and exciting places
What did you bring us over here?
Because I forgot already, I know the Terremisu was great, I didn't have any of the Flun
Or the other really fun, but I might take some of that home
We have a couple guys on the kitchen, Latin persuasion
And so our Flun is, you've very, very persuaded them to be Latin?
We did down the road actually
And you brought, I can't remember what you were
It was just a snapper grouper
Run it down because I forgot
Sure, it won't happen
Tell us what you're proud of at your restaurant
We're very heavy in seafood
But there's many, many, many non-sea food lovers out there
Because those individuals we have a very extensive steaks, red meats, everything from beer shops
And we've brought some like a lamb today
Yeah, I've had some lamb, it's just a prejudicial thing
I've always had bad experiences with it
Christian enjoyed it
Yeah, I did
It's very good
It was a very short list of things I'm not crazy about, lamb and scallops
You'd be surprised at the raspberry
I don't know, I know raspberries are huge and you guys in the fancy restaurant business
You put raspberry on everything, don't you?
The desserts of the raspberry, they put raspberry on the cheque
They put raspberry on the cheque, they put raspberry on the cheque
They give you raspberries and you walk in there
They have a big, low raspberry in the past
What about strawberries?
What ever happened to strawberries?
It used to be strawberries and somebody, one of you to people, one of you chef types
And you really fancy people
And it's going to be raspberries now forever
I've seen blackberries though more and more
I taste them blackberries are very, very good for you
I love them because we were talking about North Carolina
We got the wild blackberries all over the place up there
Right, and there's a wonderful
I will just shred my hands up because they got thorns
They got nasty thorns
Oh, shred my hands up, picking blackberries whenever they're going on
They're wonderful
I have no idea, I know they're great for the fancy restaurant business
Because raspberries blow
I hate them
Somebody, I wanted before we run out of time
I wanted you to give people directions
Nice
In a nice way
Because it is
And I equated to Burton Jax
Remember before terrorism shut them down
It was a very difficult place to get to
It was almost impossible to give people direction convoluted
And that's what everyone liked about it
It was very exclusive because you, nobody wound up there
Nobody ever got there by accident
You had to know about it
Know where you were going and it was a big secret
And that was all part of the fun
So, Duff was all concerned
And he typed these directions out
And everything like that
And I said, just give the phone number out
They'll walk them in
So, why do you tell people how to find you?
It's really easy
If you're coming down from Hellendale Beach Boulevard
You're going east all the way to the beach
When you can't go any further
Let's say when a witches south ocean drive
You take a ride
And you're going down three traffic lights
The third traffic light
The street sign says hemisphere
Hence the also the complex of hemispheres
You take another right at that street sign
But you cannot see us from the street
Because we do sit back on the property on the inner grisle
Sure, you go up in the water
You got the huge, beautiful, got 100 feet of down with water
Real nice inside, outside
Exactly that
Patio dining or inside dining
Every night we have cabaret
We have a piano bar
Five dancing
Not dancing
Not dancing
Customers use the night the night the vanilla
Joe and Joe play
Actually, it's wonderful for either
Dining or conversation
Or cocktails
Any one of the above
And of course the destination being outside
When the evening is really nice
So let me ask you this as a, you know, because you're a chef so you light
Well I'm not really chef by trade
I've cooked for many many many many years
And now I'm in the front green people saying hi, how are you?
What a fun, but you get to eat whatever that hell you want
Oh no, absolutely
What a great hooker we're talking about every day about every business has its perks like mine
I get to take other people's girlfriends out of the fridge of the job
And pretend that you could just all be great
To a trade, to a coin switch
That's possible? Let's do it for a nice period
We've got something like that you bet
You've eaten meat and now we've eaten meat and let people, you know, grease my palm for good seat
Yeah, there you go
Meat take back for a good seat
And anything I want, I get to eat
Thank you
So what do you like since it's your place?
What do you like? See this is like the guy that can have anything to eat? What does he like best?
Well I like it
If it's, we're very heavy in seafood
If it's seafood, I'm going after it
I'm sure there's everybody likes seafood for the most part of the world
And the wrong place if you don't
Yeah, you really are
I mean down here, everyone's coming down and probably one of the main questions they ask all the concierge in hotels is
Want a good seafood restaurant
Sure, sure
We better be able to live up to that or what's the point of being on the water
Well you'd be surprised
Even though we have been surprised
Yeah, the more very surprised
And it's never see seafood as an unpleasant surprise
When it's not good
And it'll put you off of it for a long time
Absolutely
Like one bad fish meal put you off for like a couple months at least
So many places are using frozen
I love that expression fresh frozen
I mean
That's right, that's an oxymoron
I like it
It's so much easier to obviously use a frozen filet because you have as many as you want
Anytime you want and you can do what you want with it
But then again when you do that
The taste is just
Sure, and the texture
Absolutely, you can tell from
It's weeping on the plate
Right, now fresh fish is where it's at
It takes a lot more pain and trouble
So you still have an answer what's your favorite thing?
My favorite is either black and
pardon me
Either black
Grupper, Atlantic black, which is what we had over the nominal
I love Grupper
The yellow tail is wonderful
The tuna we use a 2 plus quality with that means is
One
Number one tuna usually goes to Japan
It says the highest end tuna is they just say they go nuts for it
They do all the time for the sashimi
And if you serve them bad sashimi they'll kill you
Yeah, but they'll pay right through
They pay they pay
Sure, and 2 plus quality is the next
Grade
Under, number one
And that's all you use
You cut that with a spoon
Right, just just a wonderful product
And fresh, like I said
Well usually, well no, we don't do anything sushi-wise
But what we do is we take the fresh tuna
And we'll lightly cover it with black and white sesame seeds
And then we'll pan-sear it
Usually we like it to be pan-seared around here
And that's your thing
You go for it
Really nice, that's all good
And the Grupper, big time
The Grupper is great
And we prepare any of the fish five or six different ways
We will boil it, we'll bake it, we'll blacken it, we'll do it souffle
We'll do it Mediterranean style
Any way you like to beat it, smell it
We'll whack it around
It's crazy, makes it different
That sounds wonderful, then you got the steaks and everything like that
Yeah, a lot of red meat because there's many, many people that are not
Oh yeah
Oh, it's in the sea that way or another
Carried the bottle
Because yeah, because that's me, because I'm a pig
No, I don't think so
You saw me eat, you know what, you might be right
And I'm trying to eat like that all the time
But I'm going not to
And I'm just saving it for Thursdays trying to just keep it under control for Thursdays
Because I'm not going to pass up the opportunity to have the food that our fine sponsors bring in
And we're obligated to go visit you
The question now is how many times am I going to show up there
Oh, I hope a lot
Many different, you know, bunches of huchis
Am I going to not say you know me
As many as you can handle, I guess
Hey, that sounds like a challenge
I'll see what I can do, you know, because I know radio huchis and they're just like us
They'll go anywhere for free meal and so
And I can't say that they'll do anything because I haven't tried to get them to do everything yet
But they'll do a lot for a free meal
You may be surprised, radio people, male or female
They'll do a lot for a free meal
That's nice
Yeah, so we've got some radio hose
That might be interested in some free fine fish and steaks over there
Joseph's on the water
Want to give your phone number out so that more people won't remember
They're not going to write these directions down
They're just going to call and make a reservation
Well, the website, they can get on their website
Josephswannthewater.com
And there you can see the menu, you can see the inside of the restaurant
Lovely ambience
Outside in the patio
We have like a 100 feet of dockage for boats
Full liquor bar
It's lovely
I can just drop in like if on crack and prostitute night if I'm driving by with the hose
I just like hey, ho
You want to stop and hear and have some fish
I know the guy, he'll hook us up
I'm on a budget
I want to impress chicks
Like a rich guy but I don't have the money
So I think we're all in the same room
For all these connections over here to make it look like I'm a big shot
Actually, I'll tell you something
Because we are, it's hard to find this
It's a bit convoluted
It's off the beaten track
That's a draw
Well, in itself, I mean, it's funny
People will say it's the best kept streak going
It really is
Or we're gonna let it out
We're gonna let it out
Believe me, people coming in once an individual comes in, we see them often quite often
They like tiramisu
And if they go in their north of the tiramisu and they don't like it, they can come to it
And punch me in the stomach
You don't have a stomach anymore
No, well, I can tighten it up
They have to warn me, not like that Houdini thing
Don't catch me on the wears, let me tighten it up first
Then you can punch me in the stomach
Only if you didn't like tiramisu and you better convince me that you didn't
Because it was the best tiramisu I've had in my life
And it's one of my favorite things
So it's rage, I might go there and just have dessert
I'll ask the Houdci if that's what she wants to do
Thank you so much Joseph, we're out of time
Thank you for feeding us today
Hope you're enjoying your place up
Thanks George, for Joseph's on the water
Helen Dale Beach Boulevard
Call them and ask for directions
I'm not going to remember
113 on 560 WQAM
The streets I say from dangerous curves
And western style haircuts
Is the job of the brave men and women of
Fashion cops Tehran
We are approaching the trailer park
Where a man is apparently using products
Possibly hergell
He is considered quite and dangerous
Hey buddy, hey buddy
What is in your pocket, eh?
Nothing?
Let me see
A tube of deepened dough
It is not mine
A friend asked me to hold it for him
Who is your friend, Divinilize?
You are going to leave for a long time
Instead of fashion cops Tehran
All suspects are considered
Guilty until proven innocent
Thank you Joseph, thank you for the food
I'll see you
Who knows, maybe sooner than you think
You have no idea what the hell I got going on
560-560 and date in Broward
877-785-634-5 is toll free everywhere else
Palant 560 is free if you have AT&T
And Verizon Wireless
Hey, how you doing over there Chris?
I'm doing great, what about you?
Wow, I need a nap
I think I'm going to have a nap
I think we'll be taking a nap before skating tonight
You're going?
Yes
We'll see if that actually happens
She's threatened that before
She has gone before, you know
She's capable of skating, she has skates
It's just one of these things
It's kind of like that
I'm going to feel that
Normal, good
How much are you not going to be skating backwards like you?
No, no, like you
Good
See, I don't consider myself good
I used to be, that's what I always tell people
I used to be
In that crowd, I'm middle of the pack
For some reason, it doesn't consider themselves good
You hot dog it pretty well
I do my best to hot dog it
But that's still, I don't consider that good
That's just me doing as good as I can
How's that?
Now, was skating the same back last week or no?
I didn't see them last week
So we're going to fill out the competition
Hopefully they did well in the competition
And we will ask them
No, good is what I used to be
And good is what you see some of the other people do on the floor out there
You know, what I do are the basics
And maybe, all right, I'll give you this
I do the basics well
Okay, we'll give you that
Those are the basics
What some of these other people are doing out there
Are some amazing stunts and tricks
What's yeah, used to be able to do that stuff
And then I got old
And maybe I would still be able to do it
If I had never stopped
But you stopped and for, I don't know
Like 20 years
I didn't do anything
Joseph forgot his cell phone
Oh hey, Duff, bring Joseph back
Should I text Duff right here
Yes
I'm going to text Duff Lindsay
Right here Duff
So what is it called, sliding
What is that one that they do where you have to do it
You have to get off the ring
And then kind of all
Shuffle, shuffle
There's nothing to that
I don't even know why they have a special session for shuffling
All right, I'm talking
Because it looks the same time which I do all day long
Joseph, yeah, but they're just bouncing
Is all they're doing
Joseph forgot his, he was so excited about being on the radio
Joseph forgot his phone
Duff texting while talking
Your talent says new skill I've developed
QIM Chris is busy
Yeah, I forgot about that
Don't worry about it
You want it, what do you want?
Talk to George
Okay, go right ahead, turn the radio off and start talking
Oh, George!
No four-play, just like my sex life
Man, that's the way we like it, huh?
Get straight to the point
Yeah, I mean, I like some four-play but you know
Not to say that you're boring or anything, but where's Lucy?
You know, it's not a scheduled day, see what's going on is it's Thursday
And that's all right, I understand, you know, I'd much rather have Lucy right here
I got to tell you honestly, she's really, I don't know what it is, but the interaction you guys have, it sounds great on you
Everybody says the same thing, and I like it, and she likes it, and the audience likes it, we've only had two complaints out of a hundred
Comparatives
You guys will be able to work it out, where you've been
Here, let me tell you what's going to happen
If it's good, the management of this radio station, and every other radio station in this town is going to hate it
There is no suit wearing MFR in this town that knows what good radio is, so there's no chance that anyone that is good will ever have a radio station in this town
So basically before you know it, you and Lucy will be a thing in a pack
We'll be going somewhere to another town or something like that, but yeah, you better believe it
What you will hear a lot of, a really bad, sucking mediocre acts in this town, that they get paid a lot of money to suck and get low ratings
That's what you'll hear
That's what I'm seeing
I guess we'll wait for tomorrow
Yeah, well it's going to be a speaking sense tomorrow, but I told Lucy to make a cameo, she has to give SUDs a lap dance
We'll appreciate it
We're not scheduled to come in today, so she would not you know not even waiting to, although we got to talk some stuff
You do Joseph phone, all right, it's right over here on a on a napkin
QAIM, hello
George, you forgot Meredith Manson and Johnny Depp on the list, man
Put them on there later
Later, would you put Johnny Depp wasn't born here, Johnny Depp we already talked about, he was born where?
Yenem's belt can talk
Can I see you in the long time?
But Marilyn Manson, I know he is a local boy like this is where he got his act started
Oh excuse me, term a superb
But hey, Lucy, by popular demand, look at this, you hear the guy, did you hear what the guy just said?
The guy called up and said hey not that you're boring or anything but where's Lucy?
Sure he am
And I said it was an unscheduled, because it's Thursday, I wasn't even, I'm not even supposed to be on today
I was just saying what are you doing here?
Lazy Fat Fag took off early
Marilyn Manson born in Ohio
Was any born in Florida?
No, Ohio, see a lot of people used to live here like Johnny Depp and Marilyn Manson, they grew up here but they were born somewhere else
Also, being that I'm on QAIM right now, a famous baseball player
What's his name? A-Rod
I don't know, I'm trying to find yet another video
Yeah, Lucy, so Keith Hernandez from the Met
And we're going with Enter Tanner, so
Oh, okay
I don't know, I'm trying to be on QAIM
Let me hear your name, I'm just going to vote
Because you were born here somewhere in the United States?
Yes, I was
You, Miguel, I was born in Jersey
The guy that made this drop for us?
Oh yeah, love him
No, that was Bokeh Brian anyway
Let me hear that
Oh yeah, that's Bokeh Brian speaking with a Spanish accent
Speaking a Spanish accent
Explain to me why you like
Just, just, Jude Lucy Lopez and Miguel Esco-Barn
All these other American born
Have accents?
Have accents
I'm a wreath, you understand I'm a wreath right?
Yeah, I know, I know you're a wreath
But I think it's, I personally feel that I have an accent because all the other kids I went to school with
Have accents
Have accents and if you're rounded
Yeah, and if you're rounded you just pick it up
Well, I know, that's...
Is it going to New York accent?
I learned to talk like this
Before I learned to talk like this
Right
Because of the red lens in New York
I really, I've tried
Very hard
Say hard
I don't want to say it because I've got to top it up that guy called me
He's like, I'm gonna use you in a comedy biv with all these things
I got a request for a drop the thing that you said to the little goodbye wish
Yesterday about the thing with mustaches
That's a great drop, we have to cart that up
Look at me, how old I am, cart that up
I don't even know what to call it anymore

Everybody has to just leave him alone and I'm like, but I can't help but I have to do it
However many Psychos there are in this town, they're all listeners of this show

How can we find a nice bisexual girl, you marry her?
And then she doesn't like carpet anymore
