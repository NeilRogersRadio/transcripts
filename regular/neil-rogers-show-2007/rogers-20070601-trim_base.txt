The Friday you bested!
If you're a DJ who's also Caucasian,
don't even mention the blacks or the Asians.
Athletic women with short curly hair.
These are the things you can't stay on the air.
Homeless men talking about things quite disgusting.
The FCC through your door will be fusing.
But only functions don't even go there.
These are the things you can't stay on the air.
When our show up done comes to protest,
troubles on the way.
Apologize for all the things that you said.
And update your resume.
How time it is?
That's even without joy.
That's just the regular ordinary,
politically correct FCC-regulated crap.
Hey, it's Friday.
George is going to be on a 1 o'clock because I'm getting a hell out of here.
Thanks for the warning.
What do you mean by that?
Like I said, George is going to be on about 1.
Right.
So let's see what we got going here.
We got big news today.
Barry Jackass and the Amami Herald.
Joe Rose News.
We want you Joe.
Come on back.
We want you back.
Mombites at Jackson's song.
I want you back.
We don't need to play it.
No good.
That's a good idea.
Let's play that till 12-12.
We need anything more right now.
Talk to the troops.
Barry Jackass says,
Rose remains conflicted on decision.
Now the first paragraph sounds really promising.
Popular morning host Joe Rose said yesterday he told 790 the ticket.
He probably won't resign with them.
Which would pave the way for move to WDQAM.
But Rose said he remains conflicted.
Now keep going back and forth about a decision.
Quit waffling Joe.
We want you back.
Come to a real radio station.
And not to make believe place for the bunch of upfalls.
A real radio station?
Well, I guess this is a real radio station.
I got to go to Lily a little bit for Joe.
He knows he's been here already.
He's been here a hundred times.
So here already knows the New York.
Yeah.
Maybe that's why he's, you know, having in high.
You mean the fact you got lied to so many times?
Right.
I've got to go down like everybody gets over here.
Well, you sure are a negativity.
Can I go on with Barry Jackass?
If you need him back badly.
Badly.
Come on, Joe.
Tell me you want to blank check.
So if Rose says he isn't sure what he wants to do very right.
What do you tell the ticket last week he probably won't resign.
To get them off my back, he said.
Get off my back, Joe.
Will you idiot?
You in it more often.
You're fairie.
The ticket is repeatedly pushed for an answer about his future, even though his contract
doesn't expire to August 31.
Rose understandably doesn't want to be pressured.
Nobody likes pressure, baby.
No pressure.
It's like pushing 70 in my eye.
He said it's pushing me to get married before I want to get married.
They can't take a deep breath.
791 in an answer a month ago.
Rose Deleads Fortescasthorod NBC6 is not permitted contractually to have contact with WQM
until September 1.
But QAM's interest in his services is no secret.
If he moves to WQM, he could begin work the day after his 790 contract ends
and would replace Kenny Walker and Kim Bo-Kamper.
Oh, then we'd lose all those nifty sportswriters like Harvey with a squeaky voice.
I think we'd add a learn how to play on clay.
Wow, and he's got a wife.
Anyway, Rose B. WQM's warning should...
You don't know what his name is, Chris.
Who is it, Harvey?
Harvey?
He'll call.
Harvey, what?
He'll call.
What is that?
I have no idea what he's saying.
Are you saying a name or just making a sound with your mouth?
Both.
Wow.
Field Cove.
Select some kind of a disease.
Rose B. WQM's morning show in the latest ratings book.
And a leave, if he leaves the ticket, it could swing the balance of a very tight battle between the stations.
For the entire day, the ticket would be QM for the first time in most recent ratings book.
Based on a bogeist January, by the way, Barry, but that's okay because they're moving in one direction.
And we've been, you know, we've got issues.
My wife and other people close to me,
keep asking me what I'm going to do, Rose,
said, I don't know, I keep waiting for a light to turn on.
Well, turn the big light on outside there, and let Joe see it.
Turn at light bulb over his head and remind him what a bozo Joel Feinberg is, what a lunatic.
Meanwhile, Rose said that Alphans have told him that if he moves to QM,
he'd be allowed to join Jimmy Cifilis and Jim Manage in a three-man booth.
But Rose said he's not sure if he would do that and wants to talk with Manage and Cifilis before deciding.
That Alphans are moving their games back to QM after two years on the ticket,
where Cifilis and Rose were the announcers,
and by the way, that Alphans were mighty, mighty, mighty unhappy with the job they did over there,
especially while all the way around.
That Alphans and QM have discussed a three-man booth for several months,
even before they struck a deal for broadcast rights.
The idea momentarily lost steam in late April,
one of the decision-makers raised serious concerns about whether a three-man booth would be one too many,
according to an executive directly involved in those discussions.
One of many of the decision-makers, wow.
But since then, resistance to a three-man booth has dissipated largely because QM doesn't want to any impediment
to this group of Rose from joining the station.
We want to joe badly, okay? We'll like each put a pint of blood on the front doorstep just to get your ass back.
And here comes the best part. Here comes, oh, baby.
From Barry's mouth to God's ass,
if Rose leaves, the ticket likely would move Sid Rosenbergstein crants to Rose's slot
and hired Jason Jackson to follow Boob Shamby's show.
Who is Jason Jackson, Chris?
He used to be a local sports guy on the TV.
Now he does like, you know, heat coverage and stuff like that.
In other words, he's not qualified to be doing a talk show.
The station is talking about the possibility of Rose moving Rose andbergstein crants to Rose's slot before September,
if 790 becomes convinced Rose will leave.
Under that scenario, Rose could work at another time slot until it's contracted expires,
or leave they are all together to say bye-bye.
And I'm assuming they'd have to pay him off.
The ticket was still holding out some hope yesterday that Rose would stay.
I love joe and I want him on my station, Sid Joel, fineberg, Chief Executive Officer of the ticket.
When joe comes a lot of advertisers and ratings, but if somebody doesn't want to be there, you can't force him to be there.
Good thing, joe. He has every right to wait out his contract and see what's available to him,
but I can't sit around and wait for somebody to tell me on the last day of August that he's going to WQAF.
Well, good thing, joe.
In fact, one artist released him from his contract this weekend and so he can start Monday.
Oh, that's bad. That would be bad for Kimi and Bo. No Moe show.
So all this stuff continues to be negotiated in the newspapers with very jackass.
Like it always has been. Has that where it always takes place?
So far, Sun Sentinel, of course, has come Sentinel.
They got no big fat Jim Sarni over there anymore, the big Bufo Toad, so as a result, they're out of the loop.
We did a nice even 1500 votes on the pool yesterday.
We're going to have a low number today because it's Friday. It's the first of all, Uno de Julio.
And as a result, a lot of people are already bailed out for the weekend and for holidays and stuff, kids out of school, all this stuff.
So that's a good excuse, isn't it?
Sure, why not?
Well, no, you understand that we got like a little bit of a skeleton crew out there, even more so than usual.
1500 votes on yesterday's pool and today's pool is like, isn't this the one you hated about the TV guest show panelists?
No, the restaurants that no longer exist was the one I hate.
Although this one's close.
Yeah.
So you've got the wrong answer on there.
What do you mean?
For the one option.
What do you talk about?
I missed out on the Golden Age of Game Show's two young my loss. It should say, I'm not an old codger.
I thought you said you didn't hate this pool.
I don't.
Sure.
I am an old codger. I remember half of these people.
I remember half of these people because I am an old codger.
I see that.
I'm not an old codger.
I don't know any of these names.
No, so for that, you missed out.
What's your favorite TV private eye or cuff series from the past that was yesterday's award winning pool?
We got 1500 votes, 1300 during the show, Chris.
And again, Chris gets a little pat on the back of the head, but it's not going to happen today.
If you guys get to 1000 after I leave at 1245, it'll be a real miracle.
Well, just to make sure we're going to shut it down as soon as you go.
Good thinking.
The Rockford Files wins way or with 249.
I don't understand why.
Well, you said it was a good show and you don't even like those kind of shows.
So maybe that's why.
Maybe it had like, it had charm.
Nice.
It's funny.
He only got the team beat out of them.
Colombo 188.
Magnum PU 174.
God only knows why because boys that a bad bad show.
Tom, sell it.
Hey, Tommy.
You're fairy.
Moonlighting 103.
I still don't know what that is.
I know what mooning is, but moonlighting, you're very fortunate that you didn't see it.
You would have hated it.
It has moments, but it's a moonlight.
Yeah.
Like to show like one cheek.
Sure.
Cojak 65.
Well, what a drop off from those top four to Cojak.
It'll take me about an hour and a half to go through this list and it'll be time for me to get out of here.
There he goes again.
Glad is.
That's all he cares.
90 by 61.
Charlie's Angel's 51.
Streets of San Francisco 49.
With Carl Maldon with the big nose.
Did we discover he was dead or alive yesterday?

For an old coup, he was okay.
Bad show though.
Chips 14.
Perry Mason had only 13.
Then we leave that off for some reason?
Yeah, I don't know.
He never got a fair shake.
Perry.
And who was it that played in that show?
Della Street.
Her son was the mayor of all American hero.
William Cant.
Have we discussed that a million times?
Yes, the actors who played Della Street on Perry Mason.
Her son was William Cant.
Right.
He was a cool Cant.
Perry Mason 13.

Mod Squad 4.
Barretta 4.
Matt Houston 3.
McCloud 2.
That was Dennis Weber.
He's still dead.
The rookies had 2.
How could the rookies only have 2?
That was in each show.
Old.
What?
Old.
What do you mean, old?
So, a lot of these old.
You know what I mean?
Matt Houston, that was Dean Martin.
He's been dead for 80 years for Christ's sake.
Neuro Wolf had 1.
Neuro Wolf had 1.
And you can bet your bottom dime that that was that schmuck.
That's Schmendrick.
That's Scent of Faxon.
That was very indignant that I was not.
Because William Conrad, who knew how much played Neuro.
It was a bad show.
It was a good book.
Good series of books by Rex Dowd.
But the terrible show.
And Surfside 6 had Sultan to Uno.
Out of 1500.
Today's poor, we'll get into that.
Now that's going to take like 3 hours to read.
Fuck, fly Friday, you bastards.
This is high.
That is why I can't afford it.
God will sit on the pitch.
Walkin' school.
From the time.
And I know the price ain't going down.
He did.

I actually like to start by saying.
I think you've gotten a bit of nerve.
You must say what you like out.
You say that you are mine.
It gets only edge of time.
So you've gotten a bit of nerve.
Should I say what you like out?
It's all I see, it's all I see.
You're happy when I'm on my knees.
But they find that it's land.
So if you want me to put your back.
But I'm all in that big nerve.
Should I say what should I go?
Should I say what should I go?
Should I say what should I go?
If I go, then we'll be troubled.
If I say, it would be doubled.
So I'm all in that big nerve.
Don't let the door hitch in the answer in a way out of town.
That's George Bush's poodle Tony Blair.
Of course, 695 oats on it pulled today.
What are you shooting for?
Well, you know, shoot for whatever you can get.
Like Jack Corvorkian says, if you see him, shoot him.
He's going to kill some people.
Will he kill again?
You know, you people that see him and you ought to be in jail.
You ought to be on death row.
Yeah.
For how to be one of his major meaners.
Man, you talk about lies and propaganda.
Here's the schedule today.
By the way, when George finishes up,
he's going to lead into something really prestigious.
You and baseball, the Hurricanes against Louisville,
and the NCAA Columbia Regional.
Can't we start that game now?
Let's do it.
All right.
That's it too.
That's you're the lead-ins.
You better build up a region.
Yeah.
You and baseball game, eh?
Like they do for us?
Followed by a Hank Goldberg till 7 o'clock,
then we got Miami Dolphin's All Access from 7 to 7 30
because it's part of the Dolphin deal.
And then you got Marlins on Deck at 7 30.
And Marlins at the Brewer's 805, how they do last night.
They were like tied 3-3 in the sixth.
I saw the school last year.
They lost?
Yeah.
Oh, geez.
And then we got GeneNet with Eddie Kay after the Marlins allosing.
I mean, eh, at Milwaukee.
That's bad.
You can't keep losing like that or people are going to like stop coming
to the, oh, they already did?
Too bad.
Doug Thompson's got a little rant here today.
I'm the president.
Really, Ripson asked to your president, probably.
Oh, gee, don't read that.
That's again, Mr. President, for those bargain-based,
gas prices.
I've got an article on that that's going to make you really wild.
You're going to vomit.
By the way, your mic was open during that first spot in the last break.
You were coughing.
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.
I just thought I mentioned that.
It's not important, President Kay.
Was it?
Custard, was I?
You know.
I usually am.
Was there a racconvated to boost oil prices?
The value of Exxon reserves rose by $666 billion.
But we'll get to that.
That'll get you very angry.
I don't want to get you angry on a Friday.
It's the weekend.
Everybody should be happy.
It's a Luno de Hunio.
And Doug Thompson is pretty pissed off.
But he's always pissed off.
I'm the president.
He says, President George W. Bush is paranoid, Megalomania is so rampant that close friends
and supporters worry about the man's sanity and freebies lost his tenuous grip on reality.
Bush, who's arrogant, stubborn as knows, no bounds is so wrapped up in his obsession with
being present and commander in chief that his behavior shocks his most ardent supporters.
Right syndicated calmness, Georgian gaiar, friends of his from Texas were shocked recently
to find him nearly wild-eyed, thumping himself on the chest three times while he repeated,
I am the president.
He also made a clear he was setting a rack up so his successor couldn't get out of
our country's destiny.
Arnold de Borsgrave, the rammed-bors supporter edits the right-wing Washington Times and runs
what is left of UPI also reports on the meeting.
The self-described decider is the antithesis of self-knowing, like an old seedog he relishes
the idea of plowing into rough seas.
When a recent visitor asked him what assurance he could give about his successor in 2009
Bush replied, Will Fitzsitz will be locked in.
The visitor left for a place and wondered whether that might mean US would be in a wider
war in the region by then, and any event it didn't sound like twilight time from Mr. Bush.
A text in front of Longstandy called on him recently and confided it was Washington
hosts the Mr. Bush had said three times, bringing a clenched fist to his chest on the president.
Reminding visiting political opponents of this would be normal, but the close friend he
said was taken a back of it as he had never before seen Mr. Bush in his mode as in Paiala.
What these close friends see as a madman on the edge of the lusional paranoid who's brain is
fried by too many years of hard drinking and probably too much cocaine of his nose.
How do you like that? Too much cocaine of his nose.
Comparative Bush, Richard Nixon appears sane and stone-cold sober.
Hell history will probably cast legendary drunk Ulysses S. Grant as the president more controlled
himself. Not only is he wrapped up in the aura of omnipresent but now he's determined
that anyone who follows him will have to live with his legacy of lies deceit and despair
has failed war in Iraq, his camps around our country's destiny.
The fate of this nation indeed, the fate of the world may well depend on the deranged mind
of a truly insane president of the USA.
That's what Doug Thompson says. He has pissed off and fired up.
You go Doug until they come and take your ass away.
Oh, it's just a matter of time. We got 700 even now in the pool.
I can go down and read that whole listing, but that would be cheap.
Do it. Do it.
Do you encourage me to read that whole list of all those people that nobody knows who they are?
I think you must be on a payroll across the street and by the way if you are convinced you want them.
You know what? I might as well be. Everybody else here is.
I think so. I think you may have a point there.
I think we have some internal saboteurs there. I could be wrong about that, but like I've said before,
the damage, the wrecking ball that they have wreaked that they've tossed around in that joint.
I mean, they have good intentions as yours. How could fool me if their intent was to destroy and pillage and plunder and rape and butcher.
Well, they're doing a heck of a job, Brownie.
Okay, I'll read them. 703. Just real fast. Paul in 274. After that, it's just no contest.
I missed out on the Golden Age of Game shows in 99 to many young punks.
Charles Nelson Riley 65, Richard Rossin 64, after that at Small Potatoes.
That's all I need to read. The rest of them don't have hardly any.
Although Peggy Cash, he's got one. She's on the bottom.
Wouldn't be the first time, Peggy. Charlie Weber's got only a small pair. He's dead. Long since dead.
Cliff Arquette. And what's his daughter's name again?
Arquette.
Who are they? Rosanna and Patricia.
Rosanna. 703 on a pool. You got to shout it, making a thousand. It's on your shoulders now.
I watched my hands of it. Yeah, well, I got some things to do that later on. I got to kill some people.
I got to do a Dr. Jeff. Then I can be on CNN. Well, he killed more people.
We only hope.
Oh, man. You folks over there. People that watch them, they sit there and they're watching, you know, their eyes wide open and like a stupified.
I suggest that those people, read a book. Read a mother F in book is a good idea.
Have somebody read that to you? Yeah, we'll do it Monday morning. Have somebody read one two.
Yeah, three is even a better idea. If you're that stupid, just have somebody read one to you.
It would be a good idea. Anything? That would help.
22 before 11 at 5.60 W.D. Q.A. and boy, I can't wait for that. You and baseball game.
I might have to cancel all my travel plans and just stick around just to hear the dulcet tones of...
Jersey, Jackie. Stocks, okay.
Well, that is a really something for you.
Yeah, take me some of that to play by play because I haven't heard enough of it on the promos, you know?
That guy with a deep voice. We have radio play by play.
That's just another excuse to fill up some time with some more football games.
That's all. Like the audience doesn't know. Like if there's anybody out there who doesn't know what play by play sounds like.
And then of course they play stuff that isn't real play by play because it's...
Jersey, Jackie.
You know, that's that stuff. But that's okay.
We're just here. We're not here for a good time just to kill some time and take as much cash out as we can.
That's what it says on the wall. You know, just give us the F and money, right?
Right.
Junior, honey.
I just saw a big sign at the side of the road.
It says the price per gallon is four thousand.
Four thousand.
Oh, no.
I got it. That's you being. That's as big as a whale.
And I can't believe the gas is four bucks.
I got me a Hummer and the mileage is from me.
So, hold it up for some more of Eric gasoline money.
Four bucks is a really high price.
And a fool gets a name.
Four bucks.
Four bucks.
And you believe that.
Wine and then a cream and a swear and then a crime.
I may have to cite because I can't afford buying four bucks. It's crazy.
Four bucks is crazy.
But everybody's having the pay and the pay and the pay and the pay.
Four bucks.
Oh, no.
Thank you again Mr. President. We can't say that too much man.
17 before 11 at 5.60. In fact, I'm going to skip this.
I want to get to that article about was the racconvated the boost oil price is question mark.
Value of Exxon reserves rose by $666 million.
And isn't it ironic that the number is 666?
Is there a little bit of irony there?
What do you think?
Sodom Hussein may have been deposed in order to limit a maximum production.
Let's keep world oil prices artificially high.
This could be the real reason behind the invasion of Iraq by the Anglo-American forces and their allies.
writes Sherwood Ross on the smirking chimp.
According to Great Palazzo, new book armed madhouse.
When OPEC raises the price of crude, big oil makes out big time.
Palazzo makes the point of racks out putting a 2003 to 5 period following the invasion saw.
A decline in oil production. In fact, it dropped to below the level of the 1995 to 2003 oil for food arrangement.
That a lot of rectus sell 2 million barrels a day to raise cash for humanitarian purposes.
Whether by design or happenstance.
This decline in Iraqi output has resulted in tripling the profits of the five US oil majors to $89 billion for a single year.
2005 compared to pre-invasion 2002, Palazzo writes.
He points out the oil majors not simply passive resellers of oil production, but reserves of their own which rise in tandem with oil prices.
The rise in the price of oil after the first three years of Iraq war boosted the value of, by the way, Ed Bill Cullen, the pulley.
He was not only a game show host, but he was also a panelist on many, many shows before most of us were born.
Most of you got it, Bill Cullen?
We got it.
What are we associating with anything?
To tell the truth.
The rise in the price of oil after the first three years of the Iraq war boosted the value of the reserves of extra mobile oil alone by just over $666 billion.
What's more, Sherwan oil, where a secretor estate kind of leads the rise and service director gained a quarter of a trillion dollars in value.
Another big winner in the Iraq war is Saudi Arabia.
The war stoked jump in oil prices, the rise put $120 billion in the Saudi's treasury in 2004, triple its normal take.
Among the big losers have been American motorists now paying about $330 for gallon of gas.
What's more, the oil spike has pushed as promised U.S. industry, casting American estimated 1.2 million jobs.
Higher borrowing costs for business since the beginning of the Iraq war are bleeding, manufacturing, investment, and policy.
Rising oil prices are in anomaly.
The world's petroleum reserves have doubled from $648 billion to 1.2 trillion barrels in the past 25 years.
According to free market laws, the supply and demand discovered these immense new pools should cause prices to drop.
Big oil's interest is in suppressing production, for rights stating in their international industry policy of suppressing the Iraqi oil production has been in place since 1927.
Iraq has 74 known oil fields, but only 15 are in production, and 526 known pools of oil which only 125 have been drilled.
In 2005, Iraq exported only 1.4 million barrels of oil daily, less than under Hussein, less than half its old OPEC quota, and less than a fourth of its ultimate capacity.
Though technically owned by the Iraqis through their state oil company, we can expect the Iraqi crew to be gathered and controlled downstream by the same old hands, British petroleum, sharerun, and other IOC's international companies that first through the nation's borders politely fulfilling Iraq's quota assigned by the Saudis no more may be less plast rights.
In addition to clamping a lid on Iraqi production, he charges the U.S. promoted sabotage of oil piping, loading and refining systems in Venezuela to limit that country's production.
Palasra reminds the Venezuelan once the topic's ported to the U.S. broke the back of the 73-year-old oil embargo by replacing the oil which was run by Saudi Arabia.
Hugo Chavez despised by Bush, was not likely to save Bush's bacon by busting another embargo, therefore Chavez had to go immediately.
Palasra said that OPEC is a front for the IOC's. If oil companies had created this cartel to fix prices, that would have made it a criminal conspiracy. Cartels are illegal.
But when governments can spare for the same purpose, the illegal conspiracy turns into a legitimate alliance in sovereign states.
OPEC's government makes the price fixing perfectly legal and big oil reach the rewards.
What's more, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations take Americans money at the pump and in their heating and electric bills and use it to buy up U.S. government notes.
In 2005 Palasra says $243 billion in petrodollas was collected from Americans by OPEC, fordors then bought up $111 billion U.S. government deaths.
All the goodies from nuclear subs to tax cuts to war mess of Virginia appeared to be free to the taxpayer-placed rights. It's all just put on the tab, the national debt, including the interest on it.
The actual cash needed to pay for these budget busters is first collected from U.S. consumers via the hidden oil tax for which Mr. Bush takes no blame.
That's enough to make your blood boil isn't it? Enough to really piss you off and fire you up.
Yeah, like that. Not that anybody cares. Why should we care about things like that when we get important stuff going on? Like is Dr. Jekyll going to kill some more people?
I say right now, get seeing an off the air, blow off their towers, their transmitters, knock them off the air. We don't want to hurt anybody although there are some people there might not be a bad idea.
I don't want to mention any names, Wolf. What? Maybe they can just be lightly wounded.
Yeah, lightly a kill wounded. 732 on the pool. What are you going to shoot for a thousand you guys? I say you guys because it's in your hands. I'm leaving them less than two hours. I'm out of here.
I'll be long gone down the road with a heavy load and a buffo toe. Speaking of buffo toe, Al Gore is against any intent to impeach Bush.
Remember that embarrassing performance by him that we saw in Fair and High 911 when he was a vice president and presiding over the Senate and all these poor bastards got up there and desperately trying to oppose the certification of the phony, the fixed 2000 presidential election that he stood there and butterbeak butterbeak butterbeak butterbeak way bang and I gavill just as big and fat as ever.
Former vice president Al Gore astonished critic of George W. Bush has said he doesn't agree with calls for impeaching the president due to lack of time and consensus.
And he just know that he would say consensus the way he is that, you know, oh silly sound. He's a silly sounding guy. Many Democrats feel that Bush would be impeached for allegedly misleading the country deliberately and to lead up to the war in Iraq. Oh no, kidding. Like this is rocket science. Okay. Oh, let's sit down and figure that out.
With the year and a half to go in his chairman, no consensus in the country as a whole to support such a proposition. Any realistic analysis of that as a policy option would lead one question the allocation of time resources, Gore said during interview with PBS press.
And whether he believed that impeachment is a good use of time, co replied, I don't think it is. I don't think it would be successful.
On being asked whether he threw the towel into soon in the 2000 presidential elections where he narrowly lost to Bush allegedly, Gore said he had taken the fight as far as he could and the only other option left was a violent revolution. All right. Now that's the algorithm on here.
He's fat enough to lead it and he can get Dr. Jack to team up with him there and they go out and kill some people.
I took it all the way to the final Supreme Court decision and in our system there is no intermediate step between the final Supreme Court decision and a violent revolution said, Al.
So at that point having taken it as far as one could then the question becomes, are we going to be a nation of laws and not people he replied?
Do I support the rule of law even though I disagree with the Supreme Court decision? I did disagree with it. I think that those of us who disagree with it will have the better the argument in history yet.
Yeah, if we're still here to have any history left, you bet. So you're a person you.
I'm going to tell you something. I don't want to, you know, some paranoid or anything like that, but I just have the feeling that some people may get, you know, made an offer they can't refuse.
I could be one people. A lot of people. Yeah. Right. Somebody makes them an offer they can't refuse and all of a sudden they say, well, you know, maybe that's not such a good idea and yada yada yada.
But it would be put a loop and up and they say things that sound absolutely idiotic.
Uh-huh. Now where all here it is. I want to make them an offer. There you go. Nobody says it like him.
What your favorite game shows celebrity pan list pastor president, we get Bill culinary. He doesn't have any votes. 742. I think you're going to make a thousand a day and then you can really all weekend log.
You can just bounce around like that dancing guy. They shouldn't see an advancing cadet.
742. Here's just the top four. The others are all and then the second choice isn't even a show. It's, you know, they don't know.
Paul and Hollywood Square is toned 86 kilo in the competition man. They're all way behind is behind and I don't blame them.
I missed out on the golden age of games shows two young my lost 105. And George is not too happy with that choice. What do you say should have been? I'm not an old fart.
So who gives a flying crap? Are you trying to say they don't care about this poll today or you try to say you don't care about it? No, I think it's fine. It's just some people might not.
Well, you know what your mama? How do you like that? Yeah, my mom read a book read a mother scratching book. That's my suggestion. Those people.
You don't like to pull just go off in the corner and get a nice book. Get the some Shakespearean piece of garbage and sit there in a corner. Read it. Pretend you understand what they're talking about.
Missed out on the golden age 105 Richard Dawson 71 and Charles Nelson Riley who just croaked the other day 66 and again, no, he deserves it. He deserves to be in the top bunch.
He probably saw a bunch or two in his time.
Leonard Doyle writes in the independent UK. Do I have time for this?
Yes.
You don't even have any idea this could be 15 pages for all you know how do you know? Yes, well, just a way to do it. That's all you just an O'shampra Valkyred tour.
That's right. And you're right. I do have time. Goldman Sachs marches on with Bush's candidate for the World Bank.
In Goldman Sachs we trust was the title of one of the chapters of John Kenneth Galbriott's The Great Crash is the kind of the crooked dealings that trigger the great stock market bust of the 1920s.
President George Bush will not have had that on flattering chapter in Wall Street bank's history in mind as he nominated Robert Zelek to head the World Bank Wednesday.
Mr. Zollock 53 is a senior executive of Goldman Sachs who had so recently was the deputy US Secretary of State.
Before then he was the U.S. Trade Representative where he dealt abrasively with globalization, nihilist as he described opponents of American trade policy toward the developing world.
World reaction to his nomination was broadly positive, but Francis foreign minister Bernard Kushner as in Kushner and Tullus said Mr. Zollock must move swiftly to restore confidence in the World Bank's role in rolling back poverty.
Kush mirror my ass. Oh, I'm sorry. How do you do that? Between the part of your double jointed between the partners in the World Bank it's mainly a question of confidence.
President Bush's nomination of another Goldman Sachs senior executive is unsurprising given that the bank enjoys virtual revolving your access to the White House.
Last year the Wall Street bank raised eyebrows when ahead of its employees a $500 million bonus or 623 grand for each one.
The chief executive was given an extra $52 million spending money. I'd like to have $52 million spending money wouldn't you? For some bummin' around money.
At the World Bank he left have to quickly apply bomb to the raw wounds caused by the forced removal of Mr. Bush's neocon ally Paul Wolfowitz.
Those wounds were still in evidence as Bush went out of his way to thank Mr. Wolfowitz while he lavish praise and Mr. Zollock's record is a diplomat and trade negotiator.
Wolfowitz left under a cloud after pressing for large compensation deal for his girlfriend who also worked at the bank.
But for all the honeyed words about Mr. Zollock's role in reuniting the two Germany's and bringing China into the WTO it's his hard-nosed reputation as a free trade zealot that precedes him at the World Bank.
While calling for a level playing field and demanding open markets for American goods in the developing world the US still subsidizes agriculture to the tune of $8 billion a year.
Development economists say that the combination of subsidies on US cotton corn and wheat in particular devastate the economies of African countries.
The Bank's 24-member board which is dominated by European donors must now approve the appointment in a statement the board said that it was essential that the next president among other things have political objectivity and independence.
The Bank's new chief needs to quickly persuade countries to contribute nearly $30 billion to fund a high profile program of writing interest free loans to the world's poorest countries.
The test of Zollock is whether he manages to turn around the bank which has been in huge disarray said Elizabeth Stewart senior policy advisor for Oxfam International.
And as far as people's favorite bank goldman says Robert Zollock the World Bank nominee is formally a deputy to Congolese Erise.
He was a key diplomat in China policies before joining Goldman Sachs is managing director advice chairman for international strategy.
John Bolton the White House chief of staff is also a former Goldman Sachs executive Robert Rubin former US Treasury Secretary former partner with Goldman Sachs.
John Corzine governor of New Jersey was co-head of Goldman Sachs with Mr. Paulson until left the doorpours struggle.
And Henry Paulson the US Treasury Secretary was former Goldman Sachs chief executive as a China expert for Goldman Sachs he opted to maneuver the investment bank into pole position in China as the country joined the WTO.
And on and on a code.
Just pawns on a big ass chess board baby so enjoy life have a good time and screw your brains up.

And he'll send us all the columns the same time so we have him immediately not soon it was a great column that's why I pushed it up in my
pilot because it you know because people are forming it the mouth about getting raped raped.
It's all about oil baby that's what it's about I told you that way back in the beginning ammo any wine OIL I was the one voice here sitting
screaming and yelling and hollering and bitching and moaning what do we get a phone call from some 10 year old punk on the phone.
Thank you Mr. President for the low guys prices assuming of course that we're going to stick the baby up to the oil wells there in Iraq and like all the press oil is going to come way
way down you know like a quarter a gallon ride.
Just pathetic what's this guy on earth screaming in P.I.L. in North Carolina if you want P.I.L. and you'd be pretty screaming too I guess he looks like a
screamer let's see an informant but bomb their towers knocked him off the air man they don't give any news all they give is propaganda.
They're like they're just like Joseph Kerbels in the whole propaganda machine in Nazi Germany and that that's what CNN is like and of course Fox they make them look like liberals.
It's way because as long as Wolf's quick is on there doing the work of you know the Israelis he's like an Israeli spy you know when it comes on there with that beer and everything and talking in a real
pathetic style like oh Jesus God what is and then we got the big debates coming up starting Sunday only.
Yeah I'm going to be sure Mr. I don't think I'll be able to watch it I think I'll be in flight.
Oh no you think you think I ought to tape it no no I'll let you tell me about it I will conservative religious figures are mentioned in the new major US news media.
Let me try that again because I put an extra word in there that that screws it up conservative religious figures are mentioned in the major US news media as many as 2.8 times as often as progressive religious figures as a new study released in Washington this week and I noticed that they're peeing all over Billy Graham on there was it Larry King had the oh my god Jesus God Almighty just think that all over Billy Graham.
Oh I feel like I'm a 10 in my own funeral only we wish all this crap with these get skis these exploiters of humans stupidity and desperation man just breaking in the tax free dough Billy Graham my ass the report left behind the skewed representation of religion and major news media
analyze the number of times conservative and progressive religious leaders were quoted mentioned in the interview in newspaper and TV media outlets it's a goi is your belt baby that's the problem and too many goi.
conservative religious leaders were found to be interviewed on average 2.8 times more often than progressives 3.8 times more on TV news networks and 2.7 times is often in the major news papers and of course nobody reads the newspaper anywhere anyhow.
The overwhelming presence in the news media conservative religious voices leads to the false implication that to be religious is to be conservative and worse that to be progressive is to like faith or even to be against faith said that rabbi David sapperstein director religious action center for reform Judaism.
People of faith have long been will continue to be active leaders on progressive causes for justice our faith compels it he says the spirit of Abraham compels it the spirit of Moses compels it and don't give me that yersky stuff.
The report released by media matters from her case press watchdog group challenges the presentation of religion the major media is a politically divisive force how about getting that the fact is now from the guy that sure would sure would shorts right sure would spend right that that's great.
To really a feather in my camp goes to show there actually is somebody listen out there how do you like that maybe paying attention what these people are trying to tell you for Christ's sakes.
The major media presents the West religious spectrum is divided between cultural conservatives who ground their political values and religious beliefs and secular liberals who simply don't participate in the debate.
It's important to note that the main study purposely did not take into account religious leaders who celebrity influence make them political figures and news makers in their own right these leaders include James Dopson Jerry Fowell Reston pieces Jesse Jackson Pat Robertson Al Sharpton the anxious Al Sharpton.
The study was carried out in response to the media's coverage of the 2004 election which values voters ostensibly those who oppose abortion and same sex marriage were said to have largely impacted the outcome of the presidential election process.
Excuse me process. It covers the period following election day November 2nd 2004 through the end of last year.
Media matters argues that this assessment is inaccurate and the media's portrayal of values voters is misleading and that it suggests that centrist or progressive voters don't care about values in the national political arena.
Recent polls have confirmed that the prevalent moral issues are those which are of greatest concern to moderate and progressive voters.
A 2006 Zoggy International Exit poll found that the moral issues cited most by voters was the Warner Rack and all those innocent people being used as human sacrifice dead and mained and etc.
More than twice as many voters said greed and materialism or poverty and economic justice were the most urgent moral crisis in American culture compared to the number who said abortion and same sex marriage.
90% of U.S. citizens identified themselves as religious according to report by the Center for American Vaguars in Public Life but only 32% identified themselves as conservative.
Far Bisson. The disparity between the media's portrayal of right-wing religious citizens and the reality of moderate and progressive religious citizens pointed out by number of religious leaders present at the release of the media matters report is due to both the media's biases and the way the moderate and progressive religious communities present themselves to the media.
The religious right is known for short answers that fit in the sound bite while most of the moderate or progressive religious communities answers are 10, 15 or 20 minutes sermon said Reverend Bob Edgar, General Secretary of the National Council of Churches of Christ at the release of the report.
Christianity may be monotheistic but it's not monolithic he be saying. The religious progresses in moderate tendency to see the gray areas or is that the gay areas of a problem and the nuances of ethical and moral questions is one of the movement's greatest strengths.
As well as one of the reasons it doesn't receive as much media place as several of the religious leaders at the report's release.
This report clearly indicates what we've always suspected that the media prefers to see the world through a simple lens, a casual event of which is that the right and conservative voice can often take control of a conversation said Reverend Dr. Jim Forbes hosted the Air America program the time is now.
So what do we do now? Those of us who call ourselves progresses need to speak out and be heard, he said.
And Bob CNN knocked their towers off the air knock him off the air now before it's too late before the horses out of the barn and down the road a hundred yards.
By the way when hell is that bellman coming up?
The what's that next next Saturday's that a week from tomorrow?
I would think so. Well maybe I'll Google it you certainly won't because you just don't care about I don't care about that.
You don't care about important things like horse racing and yet what I'm not here if they've just calls in you pretend that you know something that's right.
I'm like I'm going to know something about right here to kill some time.
I'll take this man. I wouldn't wish that race on Heinrich Himmler. I'm Heiney on Himmler's Heiney. That's how bad it was.

When our short term comes to protest troubles on the way.
I apologize for all the things that you said and update your resume.
Update your resume.

798. During this, whenever, during this next couple of minutes will be over 800. And Chris will say, oh yeah, we're going to do something.
Yeah, you'll do something all right. New York Times editorial today.
But I better read faster when I got an hour and 23 minutes. Probably less than that.
I got my shirt on already.
Good.
Not my pantaloonies though. I'm going to just leave with a shirt on. No pants.
Why not?
Well, it's warm, you know. Editorial in the New York Times today playing to the crowd talk about warming.
Yeah, your president, all of a sudden discovered something called global warming.
Wow. President Bush has been feeling the heat on global warming says the times he's been feeling it from Congress, from state governors, from the business community.
And most recently and powerfully from America's closest foreign allies who are fed up with this passivity on the issue and desperate for him to show some real leadership.
So yesterday, Mr. Bush stepped up before the microphones in Washington to announce that he would help convene a series of meetings beginning this fall of the world's 15 biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.
The West is number one, by the way. We're number one to develop a long-term global strategy for dealing with climate change.
He offered no details beyond the general hope that the nations involved would voluntarily establish midterm national targets and would increase their investments in new and cleaner technologies.
Given Mr. Bush's history of denial and obstructionism when it comes to climate change, there are good reasons to be cynical about this sudden enthusiasm coming as it does on the eve of the meeting of the group of eight industrialized nations.
Most of these nations, and in particular the meetings host Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, were deeply offended by the administration's rude rejection of Mrs. Merkel's proposal for deep mandatory cuts and emissions by mid-century.
Cuts have up to 80% by 2050 have been recommended by many of the world's top scientists as necessary to award the worst consequences of climate change.
Mr. Bush gave no indication that he's any more sympathetic to Mrs. Merkel's ideas than he was a week ago.
Indeed, this spokesman made clear that he remains as hostile as ever to most of the mechanisms associated with a 97-key-o-to-record which included a firm-if-monic cap on emissions.
Many European leaders are still bristling over countless erises 2001 declaration that the treaty was dead on arrival.
As rhetoric, some of what Mr. Bush had to say was different in heartening, he ignores the need for real reductions in greenhouse gases as opposed to his earlier strategy of allowing increases in emissions as long as they didn't exceed the rate of economic growth.
He said he found the scientific evidence of a link between climate change and human activity to be increasingly persuasive.
He agreed that big developing nations like China and India absolutely had to be part of the solution.
Yet he remains convinced that technology holds most of the answers and that the regulatory restraints that many experts regard as a necessary condition of technological process are largely unnecessary.
He says further that his goal is to produce a common strategy in 18 months.
That would coincide roughly speaking with his departure from public life, suggesting his real goal is to leave the heavy lifting to his successor.

Marie Coco in the truth dig.com writes,
Goren, she and Joanne forces Vard.
She got a big pile of stuff here today and you want to know why?
Because I have a, got to get out of here.
And so I got to make the most of my time to save the world.
Don't I?
To save the universe of itself.
To save mankind.
It's never worry.
But that's what we're here for.
You know, I was just thinking when that awful guy with a deep voice, you know,
who's trying so hard to sound like John Faisenda.
I was listening to that and I'm thinking to myself back in the IOD days.
It was the same thing.
And that wasn't even a sports station.
We had sports talk.
I was only an hour night.
But you remember how we used to belly ache about the fact that it's 90% of the promotion
went into the dolphins in the canes and the canes in the dolphin.
Remember that?
Of course.
Because it's ball games, baby.
That's the important stuff.
And they were probably losing money on it too, you know.
You know, they were.
Well, there you go.
Just like these people.
Did the canes get any numbers on the station?
No.
Of course not.
Even UM football.
And God forbid if they have a crappy season, which I don't want to repeat.
But, you know,
Oh, it's just it's frustrating.
That's all of it.
It's not that we're belly ache in about it.
We'll continue taking the money.
I'll take the big bucks and George will continue taking, you know, leftover.

And I wore active as Cindy She and his announcer retirement as an icon of the movement against the Iraq war.
A conflict that took the life of her son Casey and Katerpolded she in a chaotic and often cruel journey through the ugly precinct of political activism in the age of Bush.
Al Gore has launched another book, The Assault on Reason.
In it he indulges his pension for intellectualism alongside his utter horror at the degradation of politics.
And the destructive policies he lays at the White House door.
These have their roots, Gore, argues, and the deceit and manipulations present in Bush and his administration practice, artfully and dangerously, for too long and with too little consequence.
Besides the opposition of the Iraq Miss Adventure, the two have little in common other than having born the contempt of a media culture that finds them easy targets for ridicule.
Now they return the sentiment.
The media turned its gaze on she and when she launched visuals along the dusty road leading to Bush's vacation ranch in Crawford, Texas.
For a time back in the obvious 2005, she was a serendipitous gift to reporters during the slow news days of summer.
You couldn't conjure up a better story than that of a grieving mother braving heat and all manner of other indignities to confront the present who's war had taken her son's life.
The Kankasey drama was one of the first public manifestations of what hadn't fully emerged yet as the deepening of public dissatisfaction over Iraq. She and was an overnight celebrity.
So the right wing course immediately smeared her. She and was part of a psychological warfare campaign against her own country in the time of wars they've conservative-funded David Horowitz.
She was the poster child for a surrender, say Thomas Frank Aftany, Fox News talker extorted near Bill O'Reilly claim that some we don't know which military family fell she and conduct borders on treasonous.
Nearly two years later, an after-aid descended into the clutches radical politics, she and's resignation letter, lines as unequally a left wing commentators, who she says he'd to say abuse upon her once he held the Democratic party to account for its role in sustaining the war.
She and's letter is a rambling account of her journey to disillusion, but amid the pain is a truth that has no ideology. Kasey died for a country which cares more about who'll be the next American idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months.
It's a complaint I've heard from returning Iraq veterans who are astonished at the trivial infotainment that passed the news at home.
It's echoed by Gore who laments in his book that it's simply no longer possible to ignore the strangeness of our public discourse.
Starting with the OJ Simpson trial, Gore resents the serial obsessions that dominate coverage and so help define what the public thinks is important.
You know their names, John Van A and the Runaway Bride, Natalie Holloway and Michael Jackson, and of course Gore writes we can't forget Brittany and K-Fitt and Lindsay in Paris and Nicole.
While these noisy psychograms get saturation coverage, Gore says our nation was in the process of more quietly making what future historians will certainly describe as a series of catastrophically making this mistaken decisions on more in peace, climate change and other issues.
Gore, the school, is a familiar character in his own political saga, the same fellow who was ridiculed for assigning sign audibly during a 2000 presidential campaign debate, but like she and he speaks the truth.
The country didn't make so many bad decisions about it, wrackleable warring torture or the indefinite detention of alleged terrorists and the absence of information about these policies and their historic consequences, it ignored what information was available.
For this absence of reason, Gore offers no antidote nor does anybody. He suggested more political discourse be conducted over the internet, which happens to be where some of the violist commentary and wildest conspiracy theories circulate.
Eventually these peculiar dark ages will end. We can only hope historians see them as an aberration, not an early marker of decline.

Cindy as she is farewell
three is really sad you know she's one of the
this is the message that you get in america today somebody really makes an
effort really tries hard really
investor all their energies to try to do the right thing and they know they
can really feel the
peed on and that's the end of that's right
Cindy she and John Nichols rights never set up to be the face of the anti-war
movement she was a mom thrust by an ugly circumstance
and lovely faith to the forefront of a movement that was struggling to find
its voice
she gave it that voices on its player who spoke her mind sometimes
intemperately often imperfectly always sincerely
and backed up her words with actions
her unscripted activism allowed her to succeed where others had failed
in touching hearts and calling the disengaged and the disenchanted and the
downright angry to believe once more in the prospect
that citizens can make real the promise of american experiment
so was that when she announced that she was resigning from a rollout she
never saw
the loss was palpable
yes the anti-war movement took her for granted she was expected to show up
draw a crowd will be accepted out regions of tax aquatics risk arrest
and get up the next morning and do it again
was only when she explained an appointment letter that she would no longer be
the
sissy fuss of a trouble movement who the hell is that
okay i don't know
i'm afraid to even pronounce it well well well
s i s y p h u s
of a trouble movement that anyone bothered to think about an essential
player should become
sissy fiss
sissy puss
at any rate
nobody is given more to the piece movement in recent years emotionally physically
spiritually explained him carford international director of progressive
american democrats of america with code pink and her own gold star families for
peace p d a was the group with which he was most closely aligned during a
period of non-stop anti-war activism that began after the death of her son army
specialist kacy she in a bag that ambush
she became a national phenomenon when in august 2005 she set up camp outside
jord bushes ran chat and Crawford taxes and demanded a talk with the president
about her loss
and about his responsibility when the war before any more mother suffered her
fate
on a more old a weekend that felt as hours after congressman bushes demand for
more war funding she in reach which he described as a is heartbreaking conclusions
the first conclusion is that i was the darling of the so-called left as long as i
limited my protested jorge bush in the republican party
of course i was slandered and liable by the right is a tool of the democratic
party this label is to marginalize me in my message
how could a woman have an original thought or be working outside of our two
party system she wrote however when i started to hold the democratic party
the same standards i held the republicans support from i cost her to do we
rode
and the left started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used
i guess nobody paid attention me when i said that the issue of peace in people
dying for no reason is not a matter of right or left but right and wrong
she and wasn't whining in her resignation letter she was despairing for a
republic to which he had shown a pay for its allegiance
she and i had over the past several years appeared frequently on stage together
and we talked a lot about politics but it was only over time that came to
understand she is a
jeffersonian democrat in the best sense of that term she believed as the third
president did that people should not fear their government
government should fear the people now she has come to question whether the
world of the citizenry will prevail it's reasonable to argue with she and
about her reader politics and assessment of politicians she's the first to
admit she's no expert on campaign strategy or legislative tactics but we
should recognize the troubling term politics of taking woman of democracy's
true believers and her intense activism by saying i'm deemed erratic because i
believe that partisan politics should be left at the wayside when hundreds of
thousands of people are dying from a war based on lies that's supported by
democrats and republicans alike it amazes me she said that people are sharp
on the issues and can zero win like the laser beam on lies misinterpretations
and political expediency when it comes to one party refuse to recognize it in
their own party blind party loyalty is dangerous whenever a side of the
cruise on if we don't find alternatives to the corrupt two-party system
our representative republican will die and be replaced with what we're rapidly
descending to would nirier check her balance a fascist corporate wasteland
we haven't seen the last is in the sheen but this may be the last we see of her
is that Jeffersonian democrat who believed so deeply and unapologetically in
america's promise to my mind this is the truest measure of darkness in which we
now find ourselves that's what john michael right did you look that up for
by the way sure cysophus was a great king who was by all accounts of some of
the bitch so when he died the gods condemned them to roll a rock up a hill
where upon it would roll back down the hill and he would have to roll it back up a
hill so it represents a futile task stuck a rock up and I see well you're
a rock see there you go he stuck a rock up his and that's what they'd love to do
get everybody the hell out of there man bring air be last man woman and child out
of there who didn't belong there and uh... let the if they want to kill each other

a man has captured what nessie watchers say
as possible footage of the supposed
mythical creature beneath scottlands
most mysterious lake
oh wow
i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw this jet black thing
about forty five feet long moving
fairly fast in the water said Gordon Holmes
the 55 year old lab technician
from shipply yorkshire who took the video on Saturday
what you like Gordon Holmes
i wonder if he's going to shylock Holmes
nessie watcher and marine biologist
adrian shine
viewed the video and hope to properly
analyze it the coming months
he's going to analyze it
i see myself as a skeptical interpreter
of what happens in the lock
but i do keep an open mind about these things
there's no doubt that some of the best footage i've seen
said shine
of the way to near this
he's from the Loch Ness 2000 center
in drumnet drop kits
on the shores of the lake
you don't say drumnet rocket
i don't think you said
Holmes said whatever was moved about
and whatever was moved in about six miles
an hour kept in furloughly straight course
oh and by the way how those whales doing
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
you know you people in the news
uh... in brine waves are on NBC every night
all in the amount of interest in these two whales
is so under
yeah because you keep putting it on the air
that's why
who gives the crap so there's two stranded whales somewhere
okay well good luck to him
okay give him a compass in the road map
it's a whale of a story
brine Williams can't understand how
there's just so much interest in this
yeah because you keep you keep stuff
at a down our throat
you crazy people
it's like saying jibbitt don't understand
why there's so much interest in the runaway bride
my initial thought is it could be a very big eel
they have serpent-like features and they may explain sightings
in Loch Ness over the years is what the this guy said
shine the shine man
Loch Ness is surrounded by myth it's the largest inland body of water in
Britain and it about 750 feet to the bottom it's
even deeper than the North Sea
and when you talk about silly man if you are thinking about the brits when you
although i guess the people in South Africa and India
and all around the world who were part of that empire
yes they didn't feel they were too silly did they
no there are a number of possible explanations of the sightings in the
Loch it could be some biological creature it could just be the waves of the
Loch or could be some psychological phenomenon and as much as we see what we
want to see like people will see angels in the sky and Jesus in the clouds
Abraham Solomon in their closet while many sightings can be attributed to a
drop of local whiskey legends of Scottish monsters date back to one of the
founders of the Christian church in scullin st. columba
oh i thought he was married to the fat ass governor
grout outgoing who wrote about them in five sixty five a.d
more recently there've been more than four thousand purported
nessie sightings since he was first caught on camera by a surgeon on
vacation in the 1930s boy nessie's one old uh
turd any it it is yes whatever it is since then the faithful
speculated about it being a completely unknown
species a sturgeon oh a sturgeon let's slice it up and have it for dinner
even though they haven't been native discotland's orders for many many years
we've been a last surviving dinosaur oh maybe it's deno the dinosaur
or maybe it's the purple thinking winky real or imagine this he's long been a
Scottish emblem she's been amused for a cuddly toys and immortalized on t-shirts

The race driver that never wins, that he win, is he real?
Now she hear all you kids. They call me Mr. Rims. Oh, one day sooner or when I reach in my rocket, idiot. Oh, where, hey baby, you showed us, find today.
Oh, Mr. Rims, did you win the race? Oh, where I came in, it's under this place. Well, you earn yourself some ribs on a plane.
Oh, get that on him. How's about a date? I'm on an annual date, that's him. Not if you keep calling in last.
That's why you don't go out with me. You ain't too slow, you get the beat.
Well, I may be slow on the street, but I show be fast on my feet.
We can't wait for you. We can't wait for you. We can't wait for you.
We can't wait for you. We can't wait for you.
They call him Mr. Rims.
877, man, it feels like heaven, so you got that all straightened out, and now Chris was confevillating with me there during the break.
And I thought we were on the air, actually. No. Well, that's good, because they would be like awkward. That would be bush-ling is what it would.
We sure don't want to do that on QAM. And of course, on the morning, on the morning when Barry Jackass writes the color of Joe Rose,
probably not going back to 790, and very possibly coming back over here, and how he would replace the Kenny and Bull Morning Show,
on this morning, they go ahead and they put on another sportswriter. It's almost like a death wish.
What do you think Charles Bronson thinks of that show? I bet he likes it.
Yeah, for sure.
Death wish. And what was this sportswriter's name?
Hi, Bianca. What was his name?
Harvey Fielkall.
Yeah, don't say that again.
You're the name you're asked for that.
Wow. I just, I don't know what, well, you know, I guess when you read it in the newspaper that you're going to be replaced by somebody, hopefully,
it's probably not a good sign. I'm sure that they're well aware, you know.
They're well aware where the door is.
This is from the nation, by the way.
Ember's occupation says the nation.
This month marks the 40th anniversary of Israel's occupation of the West Bank on the strip in East Jerusalem.
A lot of escape readers noticed that the three writers who reflect on the occasion in this issue,
although coming from widely different backgrounds and perspectives, Miran Ben-Navinisti is a native born Israeli
and former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Sirimak Dissy is a Palestinian-American academic,
and Brian Kluge, as an Oya Kluge, is a British and Jewish-Oxford philosopher,
expresses similar pessimism regarding the two-state solution.
Each of them favorably discusses some form of binational or democratic state in all of Israel's Palestine,
who citizens would have equal rights to share its sovereignty.
Nation editors didn't seek out these conclusions during the day they represented change in our policy.
For many years, this magazine has supported a two-state solution in which Israel would fully withdraw from the territories occupied in 67,
in accordance with UN resolutions, and a state of Palestine would be formed in those territories with a capital in East Jerusalem.
When we recognize that as realities on the ground shifts so much their thinking,
many have begun to wonder whether partition is still possible given the growing sentiments in the West Bank,
growing settlements, the collapse of the peace process, the hardening of Israeli attitudes in the face of a second bloody interfauna,
that is sent to the Palestinian National Camp into Freckleside, and the unwillingness or inability of the Bush administration
to re-engage in serious peace talks, or to reason recognize that democratically elected Palestinian government.
But to abandon the two-state solution as a way out of today, seemingly insuperable barriers,
doesn't so much answer questions as raised new ones.
The chief difficulty is perhaps in popular reception from both Israelis and the Palestinians,
while a large percentage of Israelis anywhere from 40 to 60 percent depending on when and how they're asked
supported two-state solution, 95 percent are more viscerally and fatically opposed both of binational and secular democratic models.
The mainstream of the Palestinian Liberation Movement for its part has for three decades supported a two-state solution,
and even the Islamist Hamas is indicated in what acquiesce.
As with the Israelis, there's no real political constituency in the Palestinian community for the binational or democratic model,
just support from a certain of growing number of intellectuals.
Also, the Palestinian case for a separate independent state is supported by a vast body of international law and many UN resolutions.
If the movement were to abandon the model of national liberation in favor of participation as equal citizens in a one-state or by national policy,
it will weaken these legal and diplomatic defenses, and the overwhelming consensus of the international community in favor of the UN.
And it goes on a great length that's on our website and let's occupation.
And it goes on and on and we've got both Blitzkrieg on CNN.
I'm talking right now, man. CNN, when and doubt, let's take them out.
What do you say?
All right, let's have an anti-CNN revolution.
See, everybody thinks that Fox News is the enemy. Fox News is as naked as a, you know, a graveyard.
At least everybody knows what that's all about.
Right. We all know anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail than their left testicle.
It knows all about Fox fake news.
But CNN putting on this pretense in here, and now we've got CNN International, which is very stodgy.
We've got a webinar where violence is so fake.
There's that who falls with a Nigerian.
Yeah, sound very intellectual in the audio, and the meantime, it's just another propaganda piece.
There's nothing like proper gander.
Like, if you look at a window and there's a bunch of people doing wild stuff, that's a proper gander.
Is that an improper game?
Well, it depends on who's doing it and who's looking.
Right.
882 on the pool.
You better work on it, Chris. I'm telling you right now.
I don't want, I don't want to come back Monday morning and find out.
Oh, gee, we had 900 and 80 out of five votes.
I'll hit the one, Grant.
I'm a good partner.
We'll hit the one, Grant.
The fact that you sit there in a chair and you're with your fat ass in that chair and just say things is if, you know,
just because I told you last week or whenever the hell was that you've got this magic wand you've been waving,
because you've been looking out.
Don't get too cocky with that whole deal.
You're like, well, just because I said that's going to make it so, you know.
Well, if we don't hit at least 1,000, George won't come back next week.
That sounds like a challenge.
Yeah.
I bet you Josh Cordis might be there next week.
I forgot all about that.
Well, now you've gone somewhere or what?
Maybe, but maybe not.
Well, what does that mean?
I'm trying to get a posse together to get the hell out of town, but it might not happen.
Oh, posse, you said that.
Yeah, I might just stay in town and commit adultery.
Hmm, that sounds like something to do with a posse.
Sure.
883.
Well, they could do it all together.
Who's your favorite game show celebrity, a panelist, pastor, president?
It's not, yeah, it's not one of George's favorites.
It's for old parts like me, you know.
You said you knew a bunch of these.
I knew at least half of them.
Let me ask you this.
Who on this pool?
Don't you know?
Let me go through it here.
Paul and by the way, it's kicking everybody's ass.
He's got 332.
Nobody's even close.
Go ahead.
Orson, I know who Orson being his.
Yeah.
You know, I know a lot of these because of you.
You know, all of them.
The only one on here you might not know is Bennett's surf.
I don't know Bennett's surf.
From what's my line?
He would glass his bald goofy guy and writer.
He was a writer.
What's my line?
Was that in the 50s?
Love before any of you?
What?
Bokobrion burns DVDs of those old game shows and make you watch them.
I understand, but who else I hear the watch them?
Other than that, otherwise I wouldn't know half these people.
Peggy Cass, I don't know.
Fat.
What?
He was on to tell the truth in the sum of those shows.
Yeah.
That's it.
Well, so there you go.
You know all the other ones.
I told you, Mr. All's timers.
I'm an old timer too.
Get it right, Mr. All timers.
I'm going to heal with the old age.
I'm going to be a Yentah one.
I'm thinking about the people under 50.
Yeah.
Well, they have a place to vote on.
Every got 14% who said I missed out on the Golden Age of Game shows.
Two young my lost.
And you're forgetting a lot of people watch the Game Show Channel.
Who?
Chicken neck and the...
I don't know.
I do watch Mac game.
And Brandon, I think those two and then nobody else.
The Mac game reruns.
And it's amazing for what they could save back in those days.
Yeah.
You know, in the old Freedom Days.
Right.
That was a pretty raw show.
And it worked in the 70s.
Gazing, everything was a filthy double on time.
It was great.
That is correct.
I've actually joyced with it like bleeped out.
Everything they had on those shows.
Bleep her.
Let's bring back Gene Rayburn to kick her ass.
With those bell bottoms in the long and mutton chop.
Big like bells.
He didn't have a lot of stuff.
He didn't have a lot of stuff.
It's like St. John's sideburns.
Richard Dawson had mutton chops.
Gene Rayburn didn't have.
Yeah.
No Gene Rayburn did once upon a time.
Don't be giving me a giant Rayburn lesson now.
What is wrong with you?
Went through this before and Book of Brian said,
Yeah, he's crazy.
Gene Rayburn never had sideburns.
And I said, I know.
He's crazy, man.
Okay.
Whatever you say.
I know nothing.
Okay.
You know some things.
Yeah.
I'm looking, Desi.
One thing I don't know is how to make this dirty.
Make this work fast, real fast.
I mean, I do know how to do.
I just can't.
Gene Rayburn is like, like.
That's the bad Gene Rayburn is like.
Was it a shame that Gene Rayburn is like?
Yeah, he had those sideburns.
I'm telling you right now.
One once upon a time.
Maybe just for like a week.
What differences am I?
Why would anybody in their right mind argue about this?
It's the most important thing in the world.
What?
Mutton Chop sideburns?
You know it.
Who had them and who didn't?
Oh.
Okay.
Mutton.
Oops.
John.
87 on that pool.
I'm working for it.
I've got my fingers and legs crossed for you.
Okay, Chris.
Thank you.
Because if you don't have a thousand, man,
it's going to be Josh Corden.
And when Josh comes back and sits in Georgia's chair next week,
I wonder where Tyra might be sitting in the following way.
He wear of exploding balls.
Goodbye, Charles Nelson Riley.
We rested your head on your favorite pillow that you used to fight.
To help enjoy your underground view.
You'll need a pair of concrete shoes.
Now, maybe that I have wrapped a kid in some floating.
Dumb dog of what's so dumb that when she paid a visit to your grave
Instead of how her sheet placed it to pay.
That purple one yourself haunted out.
You would think in your day when you couldn't say that you were sleeping the day.
But that's okay.
Seems everybody knew anyway.
And finally fly, I'll let you what the fly.
Dumb del Awee spread summers and her husband Jack would like to say.
Let it go.
Let it go.
12.50 to 5.60 W to QAM.
Don't forget we got the UN baseball game at 2 o'clock.
Be sure and get real close to that dial.
Get your hand right on it and the dial too.
Grassroots donors dump GOP Republican National Committee sacks its telemarketing team.
What a shame.
Not.
Faced with significantly declining contributions from grassroots donors,
the Republican National Committee is fired.
Its entire team of telephone solicitors, according to the report today, is lost in time.
That's bad.
Faced with an estimated 40% fall off in small donor contributions.
And aging phone bank equipment that the RNC said would cost too much to update.
And halfway, the committee's chief of staff, some of the solicitation staff,
and told them they were out of work effective immediately,
fired staff members told the times Ralph Z. Howl wrote in the paper.
Your fire did it.
Some of the 65 telephone solicitors told the times that grassroots donors are especially angry
with immigration reform compromise that President Bush and some top Republican leaders are pushing.
But one of the fired RNC workers said that the White House was deliberately ignoring these attitudes.
We haven't heard anyone in our donor calls who supported the President in immigration.
We write these comments up from each call, give them to a supervisor who passes them on to the Finance Director or National Chairman.
The former phone solicitor said in the times,
When I talked with the White House, the people there told me they got nothing but positive comments on the President's immigration stand.
I guess Lou Dobbs hasn't called there yet, huh?
I reckon not. You're a hero.
Crazy person.
Oh, or you, I agree with him, but again, he's a crazy person.
Subsequently, Nancy Reich, rich from the Center for Responsive Politics, noted a major dip in fundraising by the RNC
and other Republican Party institutions.
Well, maybe fascism isn't all that popular American no-mo.
The GOP's overall hall from its three national fundraising committees is down 25% from the equivalent period in 2005.
All right.
Just like the church for quite a lot of other, their contributions are made out by 99%.
Only the dumbest of the dumb can continue subsidizing this gigantic closet, but nevertheless.
Am I going to make a difference?
No.
Am I going to have any impact on anybody?
No.
No.
It's okay.
We'll change my paycheck.
904, you're on your way, Chris. You're on your way to San Jose.
Coop, aren't you thrilled?
Wow.
Extremely thrilled.
On Friday, I'll who know the junior, who know the junio, the junior.
Mitt Romney says, I'm not anti-gay.
I just played one on TV.
That's on the Smirking Chimp.
I'm Jim David.
I wonder if he's kind of Howard David.
Oh, God.
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
Or Ted David.
I never really thought about that.
You think that Ted David might be kind to know how he did David?
Distant relations, maybe.
Wow.
See, I'll get even with you, Ted, for that crap you people were peddling on CNBC.
The new economy and the old economy and all this other garbage.
Wow.
A bunch of shistors.
Anyway, this article says Mitt Romney, that used car salesman presidential candidate,
has come up with a new offer to convince us to buy his pencil.
I'm not anti-gay.
He said, what you look for in a leader is someone who will welcome and treat with respect,
people who have made different choices, and have different beliefs in their lives, and have differences.
I have nothing but respect and feelings of tolerance for people with differences for myself,
and feel that with regards to those who are gay, I oppose discrimination against gay people.
I'm not anti-gay.
I know there are some Republicans, there are some people in the country who are looking for someone who was anti-gay,
and that's not me.
How about anti-neil?
Hmm.
It says here by Jim David.
Hmm.
Looks to me like he saw that opposing any type of legal recognition for gay couples
would help him win over the social concern that he so desperately needs, so he did it.
He had no problem with equality for gays when running for governor and pro-gay state.
Now that he's in the big leagues, he seems to want to do anything to win over the right wingers.
Maybe he could imprison a Muslim in his basement.
According to the AP, he noted that one of his cabinet members was gay and that he appoints gays to positions of responsibility as administration.
Whenever anyone uses the, some of my best friends or arguments step out of the way of the flying horse manure.
He said he's opposed to gay marriage because it's not the best interest of children.
Okay, I double their mitt to walk in a dick-chainy's office, and tell him he thinks that Mary and Heather shouldn't raise little sand
because it's not the kids' best interest, as well as that he has no problem with the fact that Heather has no parental rights whatsoever in the state of Virginia.
Would Cheney be able to hiss his, go f yourself to a Mormon?
Yeah, hiss.
Those who want to have it both ways say something like, I like you gay people, you're my friends.
You do my wife's area, have great parties, and you have a real flair with pillows and fabrics.
Go ahead and live your lives and do whatever God forsaken things you do behind closed doors,
and go to your all-night dance parties and give millions to the travel industry.
But if you ask for any equality, forget it.
Romney is doing everything he can to present himself as the winner of the swimsuit and evening gown competition and even miscongeniality.
He shows pictures of his younger mug looking every inch to teen beat coverboy.
He parades his perfect sons, Scooter, Biff, Abercrombie, Fitch, and the Viver as the perfect American family, along with his perfect wife,
perfect marriage and perfect micacown.
He understands that Americans only want an image and that his family has it all over the flandering ex-president,
Julianne's revolving door marriages and that drug and the drunken bush twins.
Americans want a first family that looks great on a souvenir dinner plate.
As far as some Republicans or some people in the country who are looking for someone who is anti-gay and that's not me,
well he's done a pretty good imitation of one so far.
He did everything to prevent the legalization of gay marriage in Massachusetts but chain himself to the state house door.
He has said that we need the anti-gay federal marriage amendment of that issue in Congress so many times that you think it's a chatty, catty recording.
Now he swivels around and says he's not anti-gay.
If you buy that, I have a great core veridoceridia.
Counting this guy's flip-flops is like counting bourbon stains on Lindsey Lohan's mattress.
Wow.
It was shot there. It must be because he's a Mormon.
Oh, see every time somebody takes a shot of me around me, it's going to be the anti-mormon.
Yeah, right. He's throwing it away.
They don't want to wear that magic underwears.
Why not?
They've been going to the 14.
Now what kind of pill quailudes we discovered was 714, right?
I don't know my drugs, man.
I don't know anything about drugs.
Well, I'm not a pill-popper all the time.
I didn't say you were. I just said you know a little something about that.
Little. You probably know some people who are poppin' them.
Yeah.
And pills too.
I've seen a few people poppin'.
Uh-huh, poppin'.
And not pills necessarily, but anyway, so what is it?
Oh, it's 916. Now anyway, thank God.
We don't have to deal with that whole 914 thing.
And then I'll get emails about it and we'll get faxes.
You're about to start learning your crap, mister, because you assured I don't.
I don't know what damn thing about it.
And don't want to know.
93, by the way, is the number on the low tension?
The benazzin pearl, whatever it is, my blood pressure pill?
93. I looked at it the other day.
Just so I'd have some idea.
You gotta know what your numbers are, man.
If you're popping a lot of pills, take a look at the numbers before you put it in your mouth.
Raw story says, President Bush's surge strategy in Iraq is to blame for the spike in the American death toll.
And that's according to the Christian science monitor.
According to Lieutenant General O'Dierno, these surge has paid dividends.
I wonder if he's got a first name.
Of the surges paid dividends, 17,946 insurgency tain, 3,180 killed in the 2016 Wooded Sense January.
But it's come at a high cost in American lives.
The new strategy under General David Patrace has left US forces more exposed,
and led to the third bloodiest months since the start of the war,
since the Christian science monitor,
there were 110 confirmed American deaths in the month of May.
Further, most of the violence is in and around Baghdad,
where sectarian tensions run high,
that makes political reconciliation difficult,
and the violence won't be questioned until that happens,
according to O'Dierno, who has no first name.
I will not be too optimistic.
I'll wait and see.
I've been here too long to be optimistic about anything we've moved forward with these days.
Michael O'Hanland, an analyst at Washington DC's Think Tank,
the Brookings Institute, says that the core level of violence continues,
if it continues over the summer, then the surge would have to be judged as ultimately fuel.
O'Hanland says it's possible you could have progressed not to US fatality rates go down for a while.
I think it's relatively hard to imagine that we'd start losing 100 people a month of the summer
and be able to term this strategy successful.
And the beat goes on, and the body's continuing coming in,
the flag-grade coffins, and Cindy Sheen, you know, throws in the towel, basically.
And everybody says, oh, we don't want to talk about the bad stuff that's happening.
Let's talk about the good things that are happening over there.
Right.
The final of the children of Iraq, because I asked the brothers they can come to with their appetite and aim.
Right. Of course, it's not built yet, and probably never will be,
but nevertheless, it was an honorable idea.
But we've already spent the money.
We're right.
You're money.
All right.
Oh my God, that story about the oil man.
Now, you got to call that guy.
Yeah, but I call him.
He was personal friend of his son, and it was him, the show.
It's just amazing, isn't it?
Sherwood Ross, sounds Jewish.
Sure wouldn't know.
What terms does it make?
I mean, why would I say something like that?
It sounds like Spencer Ross.
Sherwood would like to get email from him.
And Stan Berstein, I know Stan is a Jewish.
I wonder how Stan Berstein is, you know, racing from Yonkers, racing from Roosevelt.
One of the great folks who have been harness racing history, the great Stan Berstein, sure he's still alive.
Don't you start talking about the buggy horses again.
Okay, I won't.
And what were you saying before about Pompano, this guy?
Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about.
What language are you speaking, Chris?
I said that you read and I used to remember things.
You said Pompano.
Don't you know what Pompano is?
We're taking Pompano, you know.
Yeah, I didn't say that.
You're just confused.
Because I was confused.
Okay, so I made a mistake.
And you wanted to make a big bloody issue out of it, okay?
Okay.
Many of the day I feel I made a mistake and that was sitting down on this chair at 10 o'clock at the morning.
But then all of a sudden twice a month I say, maybe it wasn't such a bad move after all.
Why the, you bastard.
When you no longer can say any other everyday voice.
We got a pretty funny movement, way to do it.
No matter how I was sorry.
We can't wait until they play.
Sure, thank you boys.
Wow, a big smile.
Walking at the morning like he did the snow.
And she never even played the shell.
And never tried to run away.
Take a draw, focus, contract.
And I read it for you, sign.
It says we reserve the ride to pay as little as we like.
Or you'll be on the unemployment line.
Sign on the line.
Everything will be fine.
Yes.
Oh, I think we'll win.
Why the big smile?
Walking at the morning like he did the snow.
And she never even played the shell.
You don't even have a signing out.
20, 560 WQM.
And the fact that Dr. Jack got out today and the fact that Joyce is still walking around.
Maybe there's a correlation.
You're probably shouldn't have thought out loud.
Not have 27 votes.
But we got your 1000 crystal make it easy.
Easy.
Don't go pushing beyond that.
You know whatever you get, you'll get.
Who?
Who know the, who know the, who know the, who knew?
Whatever the hell it is.
The onion, the onion.
Right.
The onion, the onion.
Researchers may have figured out what makes La Vita so dolce.
And a Roma.
A report from Italy's National Research Council, Valencia.
Did they find that there are traces.
Wait until you hear this.
I never have a smelta there.
You know, I smell a lot of other things.
There are traces of cocaine and cannabis in the year of the eternal city in a Roma.
Really now?
Yes.
The institute may have discovered during a study of toxic substances in the year of Rome.
Toronto.
That's the Italian T-A-R-A-N-T-O.
What was I saying just the other day about?
Uneariginal names for cities got to hear that.
Toronto and the heel of Bucce, Italy, as well as in Algiers.
The results found that in Rome there were traces of cocaine and cannabis, as well as nicotine,
caffeine and benzoprene, which is commonly released in cigarette smoke and auto emissions.
Yeah, there's lots of emissions in Rome.
I'll tell you that.
From personal experience, the highest concentration of cocaine were found in the center of Roman,
especially in the area of the University of Los Appienza, said Dr. Angelo Cettinato,
who led the investigation?
Researchers can't say for sure what the high concentration of registered in those locations,
but Cettinato was stressed that the findings don't necessarily mean that cocaine and cannabis
are more heavily used there.
The report said the maximum concentration of cocaine in Rome, 0.1 nanograms per cubic meter,
was five times less than the legal limit for toxic substances in the year.
Nevertheless, researchers said even the small amount was reason for concern.
There were small traces of drugs found in Toronto, in Italy, and none in Algiers.
Well, maybe that's why everybody's bailing out of Algiers.
All those Moroccans in Algiers, they're like all over the place.
They're like the plague in Frankfurt and in London and just everywhere.
All the other day, they went out, man.
Any place where you see the people bailing out like crazy, like South Florida, for example,
went in doubt they're bailing out, you know there's something really stinks.
You know what I mean by that?
No, what do you mean by that?
In addition to which this article is so idiotic.
Thanks anyway, by the way, Sean, Mr. O'Katman.
Felix O'Kat.
But because in Rome, the pollution from automobiles is so heavy and so thick
that on one of those real hot summer days, you could plot from it.
You know I'm talking about the smog?
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Makes L.A. seem like an oxygen tent.
But nevertheless, 932 on a pool.
You're going to make your thousand.
Proud now?
Yes.
See Fred Thompson's got what it takes to be a Republican.
He's an actor.
He used to be a politician and then turned it to be an actor.
And his claim to fame and politics was ripping the hell out of Janet.
We know every time he had a chance, he was ripping her an ass, picking on that poor old Janet.
Old Dyke.
Now he's an actor, so that makes him qualified.
Like George Murphy and Ronald Reagan and Arnold and all these other...
Yeah, a bunch of bad actors.
With his movie star, Sviger, Bluff Manor and Conservative Track Record, actor and
ex-Senator Fred Thompson is poised to rock a Republican presidential race that has
left many true believers cold.
The star of internationally syndicated law and odor and movies like comfort but
October will vault into the top tier of the 2008 White House sweepstakes and
an immediate challenge to hard-running Republicans, John McCain, mid-Romney and
Rudy Giuliani.
Thompson, a craggy 64-year-old, six-foot, six-former attorney from Tennessee, has
dropped broad hints about a run for the White House for weeks and is expected to formally
start raising campaign cash in just in the next few days.
Like it's a surprise, right?
Right.
I can't remember exactly the poem when I said I'm going to do this, Thompson told you I
said it and interview published yesterday.
But when I did, the thing that occurred to me, I'm going to tell people I'm thinking
about it and see what kind of reaction I get.
I think a lot of people are going to say...
Oh my God.
Thompson's big screen career, playing spoken politics and hawkish anti-Washington concertedism
heavy-voke memories for some Republicans of Ronald Reagan, who's revered by party faithful
in the gold standard for each party presidential candidate.
Ronnie Reagan.
Isn't it amazing what the passage of time will do?
I guess everybody must have caught Alzheimer's from Ronny because they forgot what I'm not
see he will.
I hate these guys.
Starsley anti-abortion pro-gun, pro-tax cuts, Thompson brands are waiting in president
Mahmoud Ahmed in the Jada, pirate and accuses Democrats of investing in the U.S. defeat in
Iraq.
He harbors a dark world view of looming future threats to civilization which he laid out
in a keynote speech in California this month, in which he wore the nuclear North Korea
and Iran, and accused China and Russia of playing aggressive international energy politics.
The United States NATO allies, he wore worse slumbering through a showdown with al-Qaeda's
forces of nihilism and darkness.
In recent blog posts he rebuked foreigners that don't like the U.S.
Our natural tendency is to tell the French for example, we'd rather not hear from them until
the day when they need this to bail them out again.
Thompson's hulking figure in slow southern drawl have overshadowed the shed of the Republican
race for weeks, even though he hasn't taken part in crowd of 10 candidate debates, the
third of which is said for next week in New Hampshire and they say he won't be there.
If it's expected he formerly launches a campaign in early July, his presence will add another
oversized political personality to a wide open race already featuring heavy weights like Hillary Clinton
and Rudy Giuliani.
But a beep bit of a boop a lot, and that's some Fred Thompson.
Another fascist.
So why shouldn't it be the perfect candidate for the Republicans, huh?
Right.
Another Ronnie Reagan without the slick here, without any hair, basically.
Fred Thompson, F. Murr, candidate.
But nevertheless, okay, you're gonna be on it a few minutes here and boy, what a shame that is.
I got my pantalooies on and my shirt and my shoes.
Good.
Ready to make a run for the cab.
So it's like a little bonus, they're gonna get a little, a little taste of Georgia here before I, you know,
before that summer schedule starts.
When the hell does that start?
Pretty damn soon.
The 25th is when it starts, but then of course your vacation starts on the 15th.
Right.
So in other words, after the 14th, this business of working like five days a week, some weeks,
that goes away for like three months for a long, long time.
That's for suckers.
I must be a crazy person working five days a week, four whole hours a day on the air,
and of course they help people say, oh, do you want a piece of cake, you know,
sitting there talking crap for four hours, yeah, you try to talk crap for four hours, man.
Especially in this God forsaken place where every day it's like, what are you gonna do for me today, fatso?
What are you gonna do for me today, fatboy?
Huh? Like that.
Is that what they say?
That's what they say.
Well, I say what I'm gonna do now is the last break and then I'm gonna get out of here.
Right.
How do you like that?
I know.
Now you're not gonna play music, are you?
No, no.
All the day stuff.
Look, you've done the holiday, you refuse to do holidays anymore and you know why.
What are you talking about?
The holiday shows, you know they're a death knell, you know nobody's participating.
No, nobody's participating.
Everybody's at the beach.
I know, I know exactly why.
Because it doesn't matter.
You could put a tape on there but then you'd get the day off and for crying out loud,
we don't want to get the show going on.
I'm expecting too many days off.
Once you start giving people a bunch of days off, then they expect a lot of days off.
After that.
And money.
Right, and even money for not working.
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's that.
23 till 1 and if there's another thing I can't stand, it's that at 2 o'clock we have a U.M. baseball game.
Oh wow.
Man, we are just, we're punishers.
You know, we're punishing ourselves.
We're beating ourselves up, man.
We're flagulating it.
U.M. baseball against Louisville and the NCAA Columbia Regional at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
The hump will be on after that.
Good luck, hump, real needed.
Wow.
You think we got problems following well.
936 on that pole.
You'll slide into a thousand easy by 2 o'clock.
You don't have to worry about being ashamed, Chris.
Everything is just fine as wine.
Okay, cool.
I leaned out of him a little before, and I said, we don't want to get Chris all embarrassed and humiliated.
The fact I'm leaving early, they'd fly out of here because, you know, then you'd feel bad.
Yeah, money would come and you'd sit there and you wouldn't say a word because cordists is going to be in there.
And you're highly intimidated by him.
Oh, yeah.
So I'm here for the moment when I'm back in line.
I'm twice as tall, WQA.
They're sitting around with anticipation.
Watching the clock up there on the wall.
Yeah.
In the bell goes off for shortcuts and now.
And the big sum people break down the door.
And the hell breaks loose when schools let the kids out.
School, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school
school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, school, education, school...
Wow, look at that excellent timing for that news too. I get out at one fifty eight boy
There's slice in two minutes off of the Friday and it's a perfect. I mean, that's where you would want it, right?
I'll take it. I'll take those precious two minutes. Yeah, don't spend them all at once
I will because it's a vacation next week
Was planning on going somewhere, but it's not gonna work out. We were I was trying to get a guy trip to North Carolina going
Which which those are fun?
And no absolutely no, you know, none of the the significant others out there need to worry
We don't go to redneck bars and try to pick up women. Only that's our official story
The official stories we go up with lots of booze and guns and drink and shoot like the good old days speaking of the good old days
Guess what I did yesterday. Did you um
Over here me talking to Miguel this morning about it. No talk about reliving my youth. I heard you saying something
I didn't hear what you did. I was roller skaten like the good old days
Adult night at galaxy. How was it? It was great
Let's give you the in lines of the regular. I do that. Well, I have both I have a pair of each
I use the in lines for outdoors and the quads as they're called for the indoors because that's what we were all raised on
Exactly is quads and of course when the in lines came out I went and bought me a pair
It's not a fact that I didn't have skates in those days
I like left them in Montana. They got flooded. They got wet. They got lost
So I bought the in lines and I can't do the things on the in lines that I can do on the quads
And not to mention and I always had this argument with it was not an argument. Well, I guess maybe it is it
All of the discussions with the wife or arguments and
And she goes well why don't you just I keep trying to go to the roller rink and the schedules are weird
Yeah, you mentioned something before the adult night is too late. It used to be at 7.30 now
It's an 8.30. I'm ready at 7.30. 8.30 to 11.30 is just way too late. I'm already
Relaxed and sleeping by that time by 30. I don't need to go
Get something starting especially on a work night on Thursday nights
So so there's that and then there's no one wants to go with me
So I went alone. I tried to get some friends to go. They were supposed to maybe show up
They were gonna possibly probably show up and they didn't you know that goes I said well. I'm going anyway
But the wife keeps complaining about me going there. I think she's she thinks I'm gonna
I don't know meet somebody and just matter if I should even said that well, you know
Maybe you'll meet some roller girl or something. I said I hope I do
Hey, she looks like Heather Graham. Why not? Why not?
Roller girl there the crowd is a motion of sure crowd that I do what that I bring my watch on skate
I brought my own skates. I have a pair of each I see or indoor skates. I brought a pair of indoor skates
I have indoor quads for the rink and then outdoor in lines for the outdoors
But here's the thing about the outdoors in case anybody hasn't noticed in Florida
It's really hot and muggy outside lot not the kind of place that I want to skate and there's no disco music or
Or 70s funk. There's no Rick James. There's no Debbie Deb
Did it?
Did it? I should place some in the background over here just for audio aids
There's no snack bar with large giant buckets of you know soda slices of pizza
No disco lights no air conditioning in the outdoors of Florida the winter not so bad
But then I don't know. I just like the atmosphere. I like the ability to skate around till I'm tired grab a coke sit drink it
Rest up let the sweat dry and then go do it again not to mention not to mention that you get to see some people doing some amazing things out there sometimes
Yes, and there was there was some guy doing back flips and weird things
So it's kind of like going to the circus and people say hey you talk about being a sports spectator
No, no, no, I was a participant. I'm wearing skates on my shoes on my feet. I'm out there
contributing and and as a matter of fact, this isn't like I'm a spectator. This is the competition. This is the guy that I'm trying to look
You know well, there's no way that I was gonna look as good as these guys on wheels first of all they're younger
And they they're obviously there all the time, but it was a great time and I had a story
I came home like the wife went to the spa and I went to the roller rink and I thought I was gonna come home with a story to make her jealous
And she had one too
Oh well, yeah, yeah, hers was actually better than mine because I I met someone
Name the Terry a lady see I was out there skating sideways and I saw only one other person out there skating sideways and it was this
This lady by the name of Terry Terry sideways bless her heart. Yes, your feet pointed opposite direction. Okay
Go around around around around so I
Wanted to do some spinning in the middle where you hold you know you interlock hands and you spin around each other really really fast and
I guess many of those people would have been able to do it
But if you can go sideways then you can definitely do that so I approached her and she said yeah, let's do it sunny
Terry was I don't know how I hate to say how old I think she might have been
She was cuz she said just not too fast cuz I have a bad knee did she have gray hair?
Probably under the color that she was okay
She was a very good skater very good skater. She was wearing leotards her body was
Better than anyone her age
Should have been I can't remember seeing a leotard outside of like a gym well in a long time
It's not what the young skater girls wear obviously
Nevertheless, we spun we spun in all the directions and then
And then she said so how come you don't go sideways here? That's that I've been doing it all night. She will do it again now. It's sunny boy
So that was my jealousy story come home with that find out that the light that the wife was making time with the
The the teenage lifeguard at the at the at the YMCA
Talking about Lincoln Park and Ramstein and all this stuff and I said oh honey if you want to make you a mixed disc that you can give and she just I don't need your help
Oh, I mean help said I know I know you don't need my help honey. I know I'm just trying to be nice over here
I'll drive you to your freaking adulterous hookup
That's how nice I am
Besides it'll get her out of my hair for a little while
Who knows what I could be doing while she's doing
Something or someone so I walk in I walk home
I walk home
I get home and I walk into the middle of an argument between her and the teen daughter because teen daughter
apparently has an eye for this lifeguard as well
So they're over here bitch slap in each other over this lifeguard and I said honey to the daughter
I says to the daughter I says don't you know that your mom's gonna just cast him off after she has her way within a couple times
Don't you know your mom's a slut
That's how you came into existence don't you know all these things already by now haven't already told you
Yeah, but all the guys coming in now to the house that aren't me hasn't that tipped you off
To how slutty your mom is and how she just you know she does a volume business while daddy's at work making money to feed her and you and
And your sister
Don't you know that by now? I can't see
Telling your daughter that hey just wait for a sloppiest seconds after your mother. Yeah, mom you know you can have your mom's leaving's
You know you just if not if you if you plan to actually compete with your mother you've got a challenge ahead of you because
She's she's quite skilled
And she knows exactly what to say to a guy
To get him into bed, you know when you're teenage you don't know you don't know what to say and you don't know when to say it and this nut
The wife knows exactly what to say to get a guy into bed. This is a younger kid my daughter. Oh, the lifeguard. He's
20 more or less
I can't see you taking more than hey you busy
Something like that I had a shorter version. She she was just say yes
Or now or just point or just point to a direction maybe you'll know sign language you can just point
To that direction over there
So skating is fun. It's just here we go again
But by the way they play great music during those flashback nights on adult night and they do it again on Sunday night again
Way too effing late on a work night. Although next week vacation. Maybe that's what I'll do because I got nothing going on
Maybe roller skating drugs and adultery
Personally, I'll settle for two out of three of those things personally what personally the the quad skates that I prefer
Yeah, along with the really big wheels
Sure, my name sizeable as a matter of fact they're in the back of the drug or just in case
So a roller skating adventure spontaneously occur now you when you say that you prefer does that imply that you actually
A have the ability and B have the desire to go roller skating because I'm just dying for someone to go skating at any time
I don't have my own skates anymore. I used to have the inline high dial skates, which I just said no man
I'll buy you a freaking pair of skate to Bilgo skating
Yeah, I'm off for skates. I used to mean friends used to go all the time you could use some roller skating
Yes, it's amazing how how many calories it burns and easily see these are the kinds of exercise routines that I'm up for anymore
They're fun fun easy like I'll do the yoga because they play this really quiet music
Relaxing music and you're laying on the ground
It's exercise you can do while laying down. I can do that
You might break a sweat you might not and here's another thing about yoga you can totally fake your way through like I don't feel like doing this
All right, I'm uncomfortable. I'm not doing that anymore. You just stop you just sit there like a lump. That's what half the class does that
So that's easy and then the roller skating thing you skate till you're tired or till you
Get to the point where you're you might get tired. You're afraid you might get tired
You sit down and have a coke and a slice of pizza pizza all for me
So I have a good time and you know that guy's gonna go like roller skating
Faggot remember that you weren't here for that not nothing else here. Yeah, I know it's not cool
I'm sorry and I'm criticizing Neil for living in the past there were young people there
There was you know at 16 and over there with the whole spectrum was there there were some gray hairs there
Still tearing the floor up though
Like with skills that I could only envy some old people there were 50 plus 60 year old dudes out there that had
Moves I never saw before in my life
And there were some dug teenage and young 20 somethings and everything in between was out there
As long as I'm not dressing up like a gold member then you know, no, no nothing like that
No, no one eating back skin over there unless it was me
But it's a good time and I and I'm gonna be going there like because you know what else I've got this this new kick
I'm on where I decided to get off my ass just a little bit during the week
Maybe once or twice during the week instead of sitting and slowly melting into the bed liquefying as my bones turned to jelly
Uh for the rest of my life, which is kind of what I had been doing for the past 10 years or so because what's the point?
I decided I'm gonna get up and move around a little bit like that bit that we have the deal on Jenny ultra-nitch fast slim watchers
Move around more it's a great way to lose weight
So I did and I feel all my legs are all what do you call it sore and rubbery today
And it's a good feeling it feels like hey actually got off my ass yesterday
Nothing on TV anymore all the Thursday shows they had the season finale's last week office great ending for all the office watchers out there
You don't
I missed the the season finale. I saw the whole Olympics to become the leader and everything right
But I think I missed a season finale. It was good. It was uh it was very good lots of surprises lots of comedy um
You know those of us who were pulling for Jim and Pammy
Jim loves his panty
Oh, so he uh oh yeah, I don't want to ruin it for you, but yeah, because that's one of the things there
It's uh it was good. It was a good ending everything everything and I guess all we have loved anymore is the shield one more episode
I think of the shield and that's that
Boy talk about ending it well last week. I'll use shield people last week this week Tuesday
That was freaking spectacular speaking of ending. I guess schools out right now right right now. This was the last day of
Dayd County yesterday with Howard yesterday. I was two days ago. Right um
Dayd County under before Briar. Okay
So it's over because Briar was over uh over with yesterday
So weren't so that's it schools out. I'll play some schools out songs. I guess because I'm uh I'm required to by law
I think on the last day of school and and that's it and the summer schedule is going to start you heard Neil promo all of that and we're killing this hour
At least well almost an hour until uh one fifty eight. Oh sweet
Boy, what am I going to do with those two minutes? It's four till one on five sixty wqa m

Well, it's um
Davy's what like near Nova's uh, yeah, Nova's not the same thing. What's the actresses?
Not that far. It's like university. Just north of Sheridan. All right. Yes. That's not bad
It's not bad actually. Um, I think you can from where you're at way down in uh
Key West is that where you drive toward Tougas don't you live somewhere there's north Cuba? Don't you live in uh and on the aisle of pines and Cuba somewhere
We're really really far south yeah, you take like a white pike i75 turn back to Hollywood somewhere like that. It's not such a slip
um
I tried desperately to get friends to go with me uh yesterday and nobody would and but what do you think of uh, you know
They announced couples skate and here's all these goobers out there these punks out there skating up by themselves
Um that uh, they're not pulling up to have someone go with him. I just I feel I would feel like a dork
Skating by myself when they're playing a romantic song. It's like going to a restaurant by yourself or something and just sitting there with the candle
At a table and and you know when they find out that you're alone and they come take all the places
All the other places away from there. It's like uh, they're alone
It just you you look like a sad pathetic fool speaking of sad pathetic fools. Look at this guy over here the um
The the TB guy what a hole what a bunghole um, I'm actually thinking that silly moon fry the tea. Oh, what do you want?
E she has a huge boobs. Let me change it to that one smaller
I know she got them rebooped reduced. I've seen this show. Okay. I'm just gonna big nose
I'm gonna put it on
their the uh sconged on a little davey
Speaking of boobs. Yeah Andrew speaker
Andrew speaker and and a tape they tape recorded his conversation with his lawyer and the cdc and everything so that he could cover his ass
um
And he traveled all around the world with TB what a what a what a guy who do you dislike more him?
Or the spammer? Well, I'll answer the question right now
They did you see this did you hear that they arrested one of the top spammers? You know how much we all love spam and really all that stuff yeah
Robert Robert Alan solo way a 27 year old man living in uh, where was it Seattle or somewhere
He he would use viruses uh that would infect other people's computers to turn them into zombie computers to have other people's computers email the spam everywhere
He's one of the top-timmed spammers in the world
And I'm trying to I'm looking for he he's um they're charging him with 35 counts
Male fraud wire fraud email fraud aggravated identity theft money laundering all of these things uh and they're only I don't know what they're
They're seeking but they're trying to get his money back 770 300,000. That's not very much
From his company and he's got a public defender. How do you like this guy?
Seriously, I would got I would dance on his brains
All that money is using a public defender. Yeah, I so we're defending him
I would club him to death and giggle like a girl while doing it
I love the scammers these scammers boy. Yeah, where does the line form for that guy the tuberculosis guy and then the um the spamer guy
I guess we could possibly take some phone calls today, right? Just to be novel just to be cute
Although you don't have to answer this one because I know who it is. Q. I'm alone
I was so weird you found George. Yeah, oh yeah, I was wrong
Jim the lawn guy. Hey Jim. How are you? Hey man? Hey listen the inline skate man. I was heard you talking about them things
Yeah, are there things tough to
To ride on I'd never know no actually actually not even though I prefer the this side by sides or the quads
the inlines have a have a
Stiff boot if you will so your ankle doesn't move sideways as much and and you also don't tend to fall forward or backwards
because the
The blade area is longer than than the quad area. Do you know what I mean? Yeah kind of like being on skiing
It's very difficult to fall forward on them unless you try
So no, it's not as a matter of fact for a new skater the inlines are probably better than the other kind
Even though and then people are gonna call up and argue I like the other kind better
I'm more comfortable on the other on the quads. All right, maybe I'll try those inlines
I've been there you check in those out. I just I can't do a thing with them especially on the ring man
Slide around all over the place on that floor. It's like glass when you're using in line skates Q. I am hello
Hey, how are you doing? Oh great?
I'm coke. I don't get let down with the last couple of sopranos what I got it feeling
We are you know at this point. It's kind of like we're just coasting to the end
Aren't we we made the commitment from the beginning? We're not expecting anything. We just want to see it end somehow
Right, well if they're smart they could do with style. It should have done left it open
And then there could be the first time I remember the consumer could go to the movies
Sure
A movie but I want two other things I want to ask you I had heard that before that they were thinking about that
But what do I you know I hear lots of things go ahead
You know if there's something out there a red chorogen virus that hit my wife's computer while she was
On any a website dealing with
Teachers and it backdoored us and it totally split I hate it back doors
As a matter of fact, that's why I don't bend over in less my back stool. Well, right
And also I want to say thank God you heard a purple haze
I saw mr. Red haze have a go on George. All right. Take it easy. There's red haze in town, and I don't have any QA. Hello
QA. I am hello
Yo man. I was telling you to go to a gold coast like months ago. It's crazy. That you went to
Listen listen because I'm actually closer to gold coast
But I check out there well first of all they don't have a website. So I have no idea what their schedule is
Um the last time that I went to gold coast it was the wrong night
You gotta go on Tuesday night Tuesday night of Tuesday night's gay and lesbian night
I call the most lesbian and mixed night. There's a bunch of FIU
People that go out there and believe me. I called them up. They said gay and lesbian night. So guess what
Sorry
Ladies ladies night I'll go there, but I don't know any ladies QA. I am hello
Yeah, George. Yeah
Have you heard about the new quentin Tarantino movie?
Hostel too
Yeah, I thought it was quentin Tarantino presents in other words they just paid him to use his name like they did on the first one
Yeah, I think we've talked
Yes, he does and in hostile once sucked and I can't imagine that hostile two will be better QA. I am hello
George. Yeah, and your opinion what
Band or just you're gonna cover song and made it better than the original
You know we could build a list because a lot of songs that you think are original are actually a cover of something so ancient
That you never heard of it before right well
One thing I have is whiskey the jar. Then Lizzy did it awesome, but it
It that song is like older than dirt
Yeah, yeah, I really like wayward back. I can't answer that quickly. I'll make a list and then the next time that I'm on which is gonna be
In a week or two weeks
Well talk about that. That's an excellent thing to discuss which cover then when you know what we can take a poll
Yeah, okay, we can kill a poll with that what covers song was better than the original
Awesome. Thank you. All right. Thank you. We'll discuss QA hello
Hey, it was nice to hear you talk about skating and about um Debbie Deb
I love Debbie Deb and when I got my iphone I was so excited that I tuned has Debbie Deb and Megatons and freestyle

What else will happen Debbie Deb?
I got Debbie Gibson too. I bet show up here. I got this too
I don't know where we're playing this we need to go into break. We got to take the breaks a little bit earlier than usual this summer

Marlins in the braves at 805.
Ed Kaplan whenever the hell the game ends.
So this isn't something interesting.
I've fetched.
I'm going to surprise you with my comments.
I surprise a lot of people sometimes.
E-Harmony sued in California for excluding gaze.
Did you hear about that story?
I've heard something about it in the whole story.
E-Harmony apparently was founded in 2000 by evangelical Christian, Dr. Neal Clark Warren
and still has strong ties with religious conservative groups of like focus on the family.
They have 12 million registered users.
They have the ad campaign.
This and that.
And their defense is that their technique is based on research that they do and their
research has to do with what makes men and women compatible and they just haven't gone
there.
They haven't done research about what makes same-sex couples compatible.
Same-sex suckles.
Really compatible.
Yeah.
And here's the thing on that.
If you go into a business and they don't want to do business with you, walk out.
Just walk away.
It's the same as when you hear people bitch and people call the show.
I wanted to do a business and they didn't speak any English.
So do the thing that would piss them off the most.
Turn around, spin on your heel, do a 180 and go patronize a business that will accommodate you.
We could build a long list of reasons why you'll want to turn around and walk out of a business.
They don't speak the language that I prefer or the language that I exclusively speak.
Because even though I speak another language and a little bit of another, even if that, you know,
like I'm, you know, I can get by and sign language now as you know.
I can even offend the deaf, which was the goal.
Hitting on deaf chicks and being able to offend deaf people.
There's a whole segment of the population out there not being pissed off by what I have to say.
And I'm not, yeah, I'm not going to let them get away with that.
But if, but I prefer doing business in English because that's the language that I know best
and I'm most comfortable in. So if they can't accommodate me in English, I leave.
If they don't want to do business with short people, I leave.
You know, you might think that's funny. But like I walk into a bar, I can't get a drink.
I have to stand on a chair and jump up and down to get somebody to notice me.
So if they don't notice me, I leave.
If your online dating matchmaking service doesn't want to accommodate your sexuality,
go to one that does. Give them your money.
It's economic evolution. It's economic democracy.
As a business owner, you should not have to cater to a clientele that you find
unsavory or that you feel that you can't accommodate.
That's America. That's freedom right there.
E-harmony does not have to accommodate anyone.
And as a matter of fact, doesn't that the match.com add or something like that?
So many millions of people have been rejected by E-harmony.
But we won't reach. And I'm thinking that that's a commercial.
In other words, you're saying that you'll take anyone.
So if I go to match.com, I don't know what kind of maniac I'm going to find out there
because you people take anybody. Is that what you're saying in your commercial?
Yes.
You ever know anyone to get busted because of match.com?
I haven't. I have.
Was it fun to hear about?
Yeah, absolutely fun to hear about.
My suggestion to use that if you're in a relationship, if you're married,
if you have a girlfriend or if there's a male or female that you're stringing along
for your own selfish, convenient purposes, bear in mind that they might find your profile
on match.com and realize that their relationship with you is not what you're representing it adds.
But on the other hand, it does make for some funny and amusing episodes in life.
QIAM, hello.
Hey, what's up, Joe?
How you doing?
All right, man. I'm the guy at St. Helios' Grinehouse Street.
Sweet.
I've been watching him.
I already had one of them actually on VHS, so it's good to have them on a DVD format.
That's cool. Yeah, no. I was just calling to see if you'd watch them.
Oh, you know it, man.
I put them on for my friends all the pipe-pitten ends and we had a great time with that.
Cool, man.
We smoked bowls and enjoyed them all.
Love the somethings weird, whatever company or videos or whatever you call them?
Yeah.
They're my favorite.
As you know, I live for those movies.
My brother got me started in those and then he died and left me his collection.
And we were adding to it while he was alive too.
And I might add to it still.
This is great. By the way, Bokobrine scored this for me.
This is just the music, isn't that great?
Instead of, you know, because I mean, at the beginning of all the DVDs,
as you know, they have the clips of the movies to this tune.
And Bokobrine actually found the tune for it.
Or I did. One of us did.
So thanks. Yes, thank you very much.
All right.
Well, I'm listening.
I'm listening.
Since you got a lot to watching, I'm just a moron.
Okay.
Not trailers, but some actual films this time.
So, I'll email you for the address or whatever, but just to let you know,
I'm going to send you some more stuff.
Great. I love it.
Keep building that collection.
All right. I like it when listeners send me stuff.
QI Am Hello, Chris is distracting.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Who is this?
Who are you?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes. Hello.
Hello.
This is great. We could kill all day doing this.
Yeah, we could.
Are you a normal person? Are you the same person?
Richard Dawson was not a match game.
Richard Dawson was on Family Feud.
Richard Dawson, my brain-dead friend, was the host of Family Feud,
but he was a panelist on Match Game, the most popular panelist of all.
I didn't know that.
Well, there you go.
We're here to educate.
It's Infotainment at its best here on the Neil Rogers Show.
QI Am Hello.
Let's talk about Dean Rayburn and today's fightburn.
Let's go ahead.
You first.
You draw your, you know, it's hard to agree with him, but you're right.
I know.
Definitely.
Yeah, he definitely did.
He was thinking of Richard Dawson.
We watched the game.
Remember when was it, was it the game show network?
Was it playing them back-to-back, like two episodes back-to-back of Match Game?
Oh, it's great.
You couldn't I love that network.
I will listen to that.
The panelist sounds like a great deal.
Sounds fantastic, man.
How are you going to do it?
Yeah, but, you know, not with anybody that, you know, not with you.
I'm not going to have to do it.
Of course, any good.
The Coral is good.
One of these days, we'll get another guy trip going.
There was a fun.
I don't have to do all the driving.
I don't have to do all the wood chopping and hauling.
You know, should a bear attack us.
You know, we'll draw straws to see who has the deal with it.
I live at the top of North Carolina.
North, north.
Every time you hear about North or South something like North South Dakota, East West Virginia,
there's a reason for that.
And it usually involves one group as a bunch of backwards mug warms,
and the other group doesn't want to have anything to do with them.
I'm thinking of moving to cranberry.
I don't know where that is.
Oh, geez.
Need the derived.
All right.
We'll have a good time and let me know how it is when you get there.
QAIM, hello.
Hey, George.
How are you?
A rainy, good afternoon to you.
Is it raining? Great.
I heard it's going to rain all weekend long.
You know what that means?
I'm not going to have to do anything.
I'm not that drive anywhere.
I'm not going to have to do any yard work.
I'm not going to step in fetch.
No, no.
Now, listen, I want to do.
I wanted to thank you for the victim of today.
The Chick-Fil-A coupons.
Oh, you're very welcome.
Chick-Fil-A is great.
And a cool little calendar.
I wanted to say about Dickie Dawson.
I met him once.
He was a totally disagreeable SOB.
This is what I heard.
No, he might have been drunk, though.
Do you allow him a little bit of slack?
I don't know.
I don't know.
He was paying.
Sure.
I mean, the way you can smell weed on somebody's breath,
you can smell Scotch.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, fuck.
I mean, there was no question during the filming of that show.
During the taping, I should say, that he was plastered.
But I'm a huge fan of him.
And I really like him.
Sure.
And the running man.
Yeah, he was good in the running man.
He was good in Hogan's Heroes.
And, you know, so he was a drunk.
He's a lush.
Anyway, have a great day.
Thanks for the crew, folks.
You bet. Have several.

The answer is easy if you take logically.

Just drop off the key.

I could have done a little bit more with that.
Stephen Hawking, ladies and gentlemen, 29 till 2 o'clock, 560 WQAM.
We're out of here at 2-till.
What a bonus.
You know, I knew that when Clarence came in,
I said, I got the best news in his waving his arms and he's all excited.
I knew it was going to be something very negligible.
Sure.
Especially what was it that Memorial Day?
Initially, we thought we were getting out of here at 115.
Yeah.
That is significant.
That's worth getting excited about.
Now, a psych.
145.
We'll take it.
Other than nothing.
We'll take 30 seconds.
At this point, QYM hello.
Enjoy what you're doing.
How are you?
I'm not too bad.
A while ago, I sent you a CD by a band called Benadictum.
I know you got it.
Is that the heavy metal band?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, if you want my review, yeah, I got it.
I listened to it.
I listened to it twice.
What did you prefer?
I thought they're good.
The songs aren't bad.
The sound is very dated.
I don't think they have a future.
I like track number four, whatever that was called.
I listened to that one actually more than twice because I thought it was good.
It just sounds very retro but not in a good way.
You know what I mean?
It just sounds like people that are playing some of the old tunes that they liked.
Although they're original enough and they've got the skill,
I just think that they need a tweaking, a retooling, if you will.
Just the sound of them because their tunes were original enough,
but the sound of it sounds very, very throwbackish, you know, very old school,
but not different enough.
Like, you know what I mean?
When retro is good, it just reminds you of some old sound, but it's obviously not.
This was just very much stuck in the past.
Okay.
But as far as their skill goes, you know, they're good.
Here.
All right.
I'd go to a show.
If they played at a bar, I'd go there and enjoy myself.
Okay, good.
All right.
No problem.
And, you know, I wish I could say nicer things, but there you go.
QA, hello.
Hello, George.
How are you?
I'm doing fine.
Hey, that music you were playing before the break for the coming attractions.
That used to be the music for the old Spider-Man cartoon from the 60s.
Get out.
That's something for you.
You're in tune?
Yeah.
This, this here?
Yeah, that's from the 60s.
I was not thinking to watch.
From the 60s, though, yeah.
It's a little bit before my time.
I mean, I was born in the 60s, but I don't remember no TV from then,
unless it was a rerun.
Well, no.
Yeah, it was the old Spider-Man cartoons, and it was really good.
It was one that the cartoon was really good from the 60s, because I remember the music.
Well, good.
Well, thank you for that.
All right.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
I keep QA.M. Hello.
Hello.
Hello, George.
Hello, Collar.
Even a Jorge.
What do you think?
Hey, that's a Mate.
He started backtrack up on you, man.
No, of course not.
And you've got some time-killing material.
I want to hear it.
I don't care how back you have to go.
Hey, man.
This morning, I was listening to those idiots.
What's his name?
Paul?
I don't know.
We've been getting a lot of spy reports, and quite frankly, we don't care.
Are you calling from inside the building?
No, negative.
Listen.
It's a very old strategy.
They have a small audience.
We have a large audience.
They want us to talk about them.
It's a siphon effect.
When someone with a large crowd talks about someone with a small crowd,
the person with a small crowd benefits, and we don't need to talk about them.
Oh, you're absolutely right.
That's all about what I was talking about.
Anyways, hey, to do that, I have a little area.
A bit about the Reader book.
Where'd you get that from, bro?
Okay.
Let me, let me, let me, I got it from my daughter.
Her circle of friends was aware of it.
I don't know who discovered it first.
The guy's name is D.Might, ARMA.
He has a Myspace site.
You got your crayon?
Yeah.
All right, here's, right, right, this down.
Myspace.com forward slash K-N-O-T-A-Rapper.
Not a rapper.
Not a rapper.
K-N-O-T-A-Rapper.
And that's his Myspace site.
The song that you hear is playing.
I stole it right off his Myspace site.
I rolled it onto one of our devices over here,
and bleeped it, processed it, and re-safe it.
And served it up for y'all.
Dude, that is so true to 90% of the chicks in South Florida.
And Neil is God, Dr. C.
Yes he is.
Talk to you again.
QAim hello.
George.
What?
Hey, I'm Dr. Michael Moreland, I'm just freaking boring.
Can I put it in a request?
I will consider your request seriously.
And turn it in the back seat.
Dr. Kelo, please.
No, no.
QAim hello.
It's long, I normally fall into something like that,
but no, Neil played it just recently, like last week.
Hello.
George.
Yeah.
What's up, brother?
You tell me.
That's it.
I heard you've come before talking about things that come from Scotland,
and I know you've indicated me on a really big thing.
That was Neil talking about that, but whatever, I'll take it.
Okay, but anyways, you said the backpipes, actually the backpipes were
originated in the Middle East.
Okay, well in the Scottish you affected it.
I'm not going to, I mean everybody had backpipes actually.
The Irish did, the Spanish did, the English did.
It's just that, yeah, they made it famous.
I don't know that they came from the Middle East.
I'll take your word for it.
How's that?
Cool.
Sounds good.
Have a good weekend.
All right, take it easy.
A lot of stuff came from the Middle East, but we don't want to talk about that.
Give them any credit.
QAim hello.
Hey, George, what's up, buddy?
How are you?
Hey, man, I got two songs that were covered.
One was the Festival of the Opera by Blink 182.
They covered with the Phantom theme?
Oh, dude, it's really good.
You can find it in a line wire, and the other one is the Metro, you know, the Old Berlin or whatever.
Yeah.
By alkaline treel.
And you can find that in line wire also.
But the Blink 182.1 of Phantom is about, I swear, it's like a minute and a half, but it's really good, man.
You want to try one and check it out.
Metro by alkaline treel and the Blink version of Phantom.
Right, right.
I still like Adam's song.
Blink 182, it's really cool.
All right, all right, buddy, take it easy.
QAim hello.
Hello.
George.
Collar.
George.
Collar.
QFeedler.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
QAim hello.
George.
Yes.
May I ask for a request of the Bonic Bear Ways, get it.
Oh, man, what's with all these, uh, I see a theme developing over here.
Kill some good time.
It will kill some good time.
It will kill it bad.
I'll consider it, all right.
Thanks, man.
All right, bye.
How you doing?
Because, well, here's the thing, you won't play that.
He doesn't think it's funny.
I don't know if that he doesn't think it's funny.
Well, it's long.
It's too long.
And that's the truth.
It's way too long.
Way longer than it needs to be.
QAim hello.
But George kills him good time.
Yeah, hello.
Hey, man.
Next month is the Hootie Low.
What all is that about?
I have no idea.
I never heard of that.
Hootie Low?
Yeah, yeah.
It's like some Polynesian festival, like the EMR and different places.
I don't know.
I'll ask my contact in the Polynesian community about it.
All right, cool.
Back to you on that, but not today.
QAim hello.
Hey, George.
How are you?
Good.
I was just curious.
Now, what's the story with LineWire?
I mean, why is it that Napster gets shut down?
That LineWire is up and running with no problem.
I wish I could dance with that.
I don't know.
I presume that it's only a matter of time before they get around to them.
Okay.
Well, I thought maybe that was...
Was Napster here?
Well, you know, I never got to use Napster.
I was not into that at the time.
By the time Napster shut down, that's when I was starting to figure out what to do and how to do it.
So I don't know exactly what the deal is with that, but you're right.
I don't know.
I guess it's because of the legal ease that LineWire uses the licensing agreement, that it's peer to peer.
In other words, you accept the responsibility.
They're just providing you with some software, what you do with it.
I don't know if you notice that when you install it, you have to click.
I will not use this for any illegal activity like 500 times before it'll install.
Yeah, and...
And there you go.
So we still don't know.
QAim hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, this is George.
This is George.
Hey, George, I was wondering, is anyway you could please, please say that and read a book song.
I was looking for it on this really, really funny.
It is really funny.
Listen, myspace.com forward slash because you want the uncut version.
Yeah.
You want to hear all those words that we can't share because...
All I find is a minute or so.
Christians have a problem with it even though there's nothing in the Bible about any of those words.
Myspace.com forward slash.
All I find is a woman aversion.
No, no, he's got it on there on his player, man.
The whole thing, the full length song.
That's where I got it.
All right, thank you.
Trust me.
All right, and you might be able to find it online where.
222 on all stealing other people's material radio, Polyron, 560 WQAM.
You know, all those sounds scare the hell out of me.
That promo should be illegal.
This station presents...
What's if they were alive today?
June 4th, 1968.
Helen Keller dies at the age of 87.
Keller despite being blind and deaf.
Was it inspiration due to several people around the globe?
But we ask...
What if she were alive today?
All right, our next comic coming to this stage is a chucklehead favorite.
You're in a lover.
Please welcome the self-deprecating humor of Helen Keller.
Come on, let her...
Come on out.
There she goes.
Come on, Helen.
Hey, how you doing?
We're the great looking audience.
How did I burn the side of my face today?
I answered the island.
How did I burn the other side?
They called back.
Thank you, I was good mate.
Join us again for another What's If They Were Alive Today?
All right, because we're going to have to do some math over here.
You got your calculator.
If that last break is 4.5, we have to leave 2 minutes early.
That means we have to leave 6.5 minutes before that set.
54.5?
That sound right?
53.5.
53.5?
Like I said, see, I can't do math.
Math is my thing.
That's including the break.
All right, let me ask you this, because let's do this.
I think the read of book needs to be played.
It's fresh.
It's not like the other tired bits that the people are requesting.
The ebonyx, airways, and what else was it?
The towyard complaint.
By the way, for those of you with the notebooks, the turn on the back seat,
that's what everyone calls it, is called towyard complaint.
We didn't name it.
That's what it was called when we got it.
That happens all the time.
The audience re-names things in case you didn't know.
Like Bridgetender.
They just kept requesting the Bridgetender.
Play the Bridgetender.
That guy isn't a Bridgetender.
It's an old man who has a boat, who was complaining, who called up complaining.
And they were talking about the Bridgetender.
See?
When that guy made that call, I carted it up.
Thank you, Ms. Lewis.
He said, that's a pretty funny call.
You should cart that whole thing up.
And I said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And I labeled it old boat dude, because it was an old dude with a boat.
And that's what the cart was called forever,
up until we dubbed it into the DCS.
And then finally, when we dubbed it into the DCS,
it's like, just put it in there under Bridge Tender.
Nobody'll know what you're talking about.
If you don't say freaking Bridge Tender.
QAM hello.
Hey, Georgie.
How are you?
What's going on?
You tell me.
What kind of vehicle you're looking for?
Uh, Toyota truck.
Only Toyota.
And only truck.
Uh, OK, no problem.
I know.
I got your facts.
If I didn't respond to it, what do you think?
I don't know, you know.
And I saw those Honda trucks.
They looked nice, but as a matter of fact,
I was in traffic sitting right next to one.
And every bit is big if not bigger than the Durango.
Right.
And I want to go a little bit smaller.
I don't make the kind of money Chris makes.
Make the, want you to, want you to the element?
To what now the element?
Yeah.
We need to look.
I need a truck, something with a bed
that I can throw dirt into the back of.
I got you.
I need the BMW.
I need a tall crap.
The SUV, I throw things into the back of it.
Then I've got dirt and wood pulp and chips and mulch
and, you know, on the carpeting.
And it goes into the cracks and everything like that.
I need me a good redneck worthy clutch.
I got you.
I got you.
I guess Toyota's aren't redneck worthy
if you get right down to it, you know, but whatever.
No problem, buddy.
Whatever makes you happy.
That's all made me happy.
It would be a two seat like a Corvette or a Mar-2
or something like that.
Or maybe one of those little three wheel things
that nobody else can fit in.
And they can get Chris to the best.
All right.
But yeah, there you go.
All right, buddy.
Later on.
Say hi to the wife.
QIM hello.
Why do people that know me call me on the air?
Hello.
Actually, he doesn't, you know.
He only knows me from the church.
Hello.
Hi, George.
How are you?
Excellent, buddy.
How are you doing?
Doing great.
Good to hear.
I was just starting.
313, wait a second.
All right, Chris, add this.
2 and 4 and a half is 6 and a half.
And 313 is what?
9.43.
Okay, thank you.
All right, continue.
Yes, sorry.
That's all right.
I'll read a book.
Actually, you can check out YouTube.
Yes.
Somebody, I don't know if you already heard about it,
but there's so many made a video.
Yeah.
In regards to it.
And there's also actually a cartoon as well.
The reading rainbow version, kind of,
with a little clip from reading rainbow.
Here's a man now, dog has a loop of it.
That was the first thing that I encountered.
Right, but there's actually also,
there was originally a cartoon short on a BET.
All right.
There's actually on the right side, you know,
with the other videos.
Well, he's our new hero.
He deserves the education award of the year.
I completely agree.
D might arm out.
Bomanie, D might arm out.
What a name.
You're not going to sell anything with that name, D might.
But anyway, I just want to let you in with some of those.
Just in case they haven't checked it out.
So check out YouTube.
All right, we will.
All right, you said 945, Chris.
940, something.
It was 313 on the song, right?
OK, 943.
All right, we got 15 seconds then.
QA and hello.
George.
Yeah.
Hey, you said you're looking for a truck?
Yeah, tell you what, the Ford with the 300C
against 6 cylinder, greatest truck on the plant.
I'll consider your consideration.
But I would like a jet car.
Thank you very much.
That's it.
We're out here.
We're going to play that song.
And then we're going to split ski.
It's 10 to 2 on 560 QAM.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, ready.
What's up, y'all?
This your boy, D might.
See how you do songs with like hooks and concepts, it's right?
But for me, that man trying to go black,
no, it's a box of boxes.
Check this out, y'all.
