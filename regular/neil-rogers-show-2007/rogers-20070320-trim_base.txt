owdie
the tongue and tongue
but they'll get it through it
Tosses their hot dogs when your fin is too wet
Heavily with the K-Miles
Oh, it's a quick time for K-Miles
And all employees as they K-Miles
Get fired out of the way
No more pills on two shots but underwear
No more fussy slippers to 99 a pair
No more obnoxious, defy me this day
Too bad the night's coming back here again
Tell me where the K-Miles
Oh, now it's quick time for K-Miles
And all employees as they K-Miles
Get fired out of the way
There's the word schwa come to mind, huh?
But I used to shop when I was there
When I was there six, seven years ago
I shopped at the K-Miles just to piss off the people at Walmart
Yeah, I do that with Tosses
Not that they paid any attention
But I shouldn't have held a big sign
Hey, I'm the Elijah's, I'm shoppin' at K-Miles
Just because I can't stand you back to do with their Walmart
And they always say, yeah, who cares?
Who cares, you fad old faggot?
That's what they would've said
By the way, I got a fact yesterday afternoon
Ladies and gentlemen, this is quite a day today for me
This is a revolutionary day, this is two in a row
Now what was yesterday was such a big deal above
I don't know, was Huzha
Oh, with early release day
Well, that's right, we had the unexpected Marlon's Astros game
How'd that come out Chris, who won a game?
Anybody care?
No, they lost four to them
Oh, the Marlon's lost?
Oh, the Marlon's, we don't care
And today is a revolutionary, every day
Just keeps bringing bigger and better, more wonderful news
The sun is shining, it's gonna be
Let's see what the temperature is in case castrenable
Once they're ready on the sleeve and put it on the show tomorrow
Let's see, oh, it's minus 10
It looks really nice sitting here looking outside
What's that? It's gonna be only a zero
But sunny, it's beautiful
Camarro's gonna be five, which is 41 and Thursday
It's gonna be 18 Celsius
Alright, 65 degrees
But that's gonna be a good day for me to do the show running around naked
My box is sure it's outside on the street, wouldn't it be good?
Yeah, it would be, take that cordless mic with you
No, I could do it
So yesterday afternoon, I get, let's see, what's the time of this?
I don't know what it is
I don't know, like
No, it's funny, because it says 11.44 am, which is not the correct time
No, I guess the facts machine has the wrong time on it
Must be on the specific time
One minute after the end of the show
No, two all-one yesterday afternoon, I get a fact from George Rodriguez
And it says, it's from the script of the Godfather
And it says, Salvatortescio brings in Luca Brassi's bulletproof vest
Delivered with a fish inside
Sonny Santino says, what the hell is this?
And then...
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish
It's a Sicilian message, it means Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish
It says, Pete Clemenza
Right
And George writes, I looked it up, you're right, I'm wrong
Well, that's pretty powerful, of course, isn't it?
Is that the way the world works?
That's the wrong way, I'm right, all the time, just ask me and I'll tell you
I mean, what's it I'm all I get right? Not too often
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish
Let's just play that all of it, huh?
Yeah, I like it a lot
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish
Can't you tell by the...
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish
Jesus, God, anybody that's seen a movie 600 times like we all have
and you don't know that's Clemenza?
In fact, I want you to listen, let's see
Canoli, let's try and be able to get 400 drop-ins on here
Now let's listen to some Tessio, huh?
Get some Tessio, so you can hear how they sound
We all have an E-Tessio, we gotta have that
Forget about words, we listen
It leaves it good, take the Canoli
Sounds different
It sounds different, it sleeps with the fish
It sounds different
You gotta have the get me off the...
Even Sunny won't be able to call up Luca Brassi
Yeah, well, let me worry about Luca
The interesting part about this thing is that all these years we've been calling him Luca Brassi
And his name is...
Luca Brassi
Yeah, it's Brassi, we're trying to renew that, like in Brassi
In fact, even in the DCS here, it's got Luca Brassi under...
Long Coyote
Under that drop, I put it that...
That Clemenza line, because Clemenza says Brassi
Do you know what I mean?
Do I have to find it again?
Yes, I just got off it at them, a section here
Now you're gonna make me go back there again?
Yes
Where Clemenza, Pete Clemenza says...
Luca Brassi sleeps with the fish
Yes, it's Brassi, Brassi
Not Brassi
Grazie
Grazie
Grazie
Yeah, let's start Palatariani on the Oshawa
There we go
Mamma mia
Yeah, Mamma mia
That's the spicy meatball
Mamma mia
Anyway, let's get this thing going to do now
Everybody to call in yesterday is ready to call back again today and then someone we had a short...
What?
That was great, that's my kind of show
Right, see if you can say something different today too, that'd be really good
No, I like the guy, the young guy, the call didn't...
I don't wanna say kid, I don't know how old he was
It means to me anybody under 80 is a kid
But he said, I don't know what I'm supposed to say
That was good
Maybe he'll call back and say that again today, what do you think?
Maybe he'll have something to say
I'm kinda refining, I'm refining the show, Jack Ma'am
I'm just not refining, I'm just retuning it, I'm rejiggering it, can I say that?
No
No
I'm re-tooling it, I don't think I can say that either
Retuning, fine tuning

that's why those Iraq so that's sad look under one good so there we go 913
votes we got a thousand lick nothing that's what it's after the top of the
first hour today dog Thompson do I dare read this from Capitol Hill blue I will
because once we get these calls man it's gonna be a heavy heavy day wq
way I think I call hello Neil God yes sir Mary's restaurant now pre-owned
cuisine what I tell you changing hoods man hey I'm a third generation listener and
I was very disappointed yesterday when the Marlins came on I had to put the button
and I pushed the button and went over to sit Rosencreen stands you know
my mom what's your David is boyfriend and he was talking about the odds of who
was gonna win dancing with the stars oh all right I'm pathetic is that thanks
for the good news that is beyond pathetic thank you very much
out of all I said Rosenstein cramps you keep it up dancing with a star that's
worth that anyway dog Thompson says I'm trying and failing to understand why
me the press gave an indicted former member of Congress a corrupt
politician to resign and disgrace a forum upon which to expose hate and
division Sunday as president Bush is illegal in a moral Iraq war
enters its 50 year is Tim Russell so desperate for controversy that he has to
book Tom delay easily one of the most criminal political hacks in Washington on
the top rated Sunday news talk show and let him call war protesters unpatriotic
and claim that anybody wants to end the Iraq war is aiding and abiding the
enemy delay is political vermin one step away from a jail cell for
influence peddling and taking grabs and yet there he was on eat the press being
treated with difference by Lackdog Russert instead of pretending to any
standard journalism or decency Russert let delay expand on why he thinks
those who protest the war are not patriots said delay well it's my opinion
that when you go to war we ought to all come together so to speak we can debate
going to war that's a legitimate debate but once you have our soldiers and
our our young people dying on the battlefield we should come together and we
shouldn't have what we had yesterday in the mall in Washington DC when those
are not in my mind my opinion patriots that are talking about impeaching
they commander in chief when asked if he thought congressional attempts to
set it with drawday forgetting the hell out of a rack fell into the same
category delay replied I think it's aiding and abiding the enemy when you tell
the enemy what your strategy is that's aiding and abiding the enemy because they
can use that strategy come back and harm your soldiers Russert who some
feels a strong interview or let delay walk all over him when he tried to
question delay on his praise a failed former secretary defense rums for
all delay shot back the premise of your question is always put forward
without the rest of the story and maybe we ought to have Paul Harvey here to talk
about the rest of the story good day Russert said nothing and didn't push to
get an answer to his question and steady went to another guest it's bad enough
that corrupt slime like Tom Delay remained in Congress as long as he did it's
worse that after as many crimes finally cut up with him and he was forced to
resign by his own Republican colleagues he's then given a podium on a
national news show to continue his hate filled diet tribes his claim that we
ought to all come together as political hypocrisy of the worst kind in Congress
delay thrived on dividing and conquering he refused to cooperate work to destroy
any attempts at coalition building Tom Delay is a crook he was so corrupt that
even in the past Republican leadership of Congress itself the most
corrupt in modern times they could no longer tolerate his presence Tim Russert
is not a journalist he's a political hack an on practicing lawyer who worked
for New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in New York Governor Mario Cuomo
Crooks belong in jail not on television political hacks belong in the dust
been of history Tim Russert owes his viewers an apology for giving a crook
a national form then he owes journalism the decency to resign and let
somebody with real credentials take over eat the press nice going doggy how do
you feel a real feel the field is they like that he's good yes one of these days
that we're gonna say open it up Thompson they you know they tried to drag his
answer way that one time remember they ever find it the cave he's hiding it yeah
well he's probably hanging out with a caveman got away knows what they're doing
in there oh dancing you're all in common east is that would be a good poll
question how much how much would they have to pay you to have sex with the
caveman with the pissed off caveman oh god how many how many million 30
million for me even then I don't think I can handle it well 925 and a pool

MARK WAR Madonna 3
1102 at 5.60 WQA. We can keep this up till, uh, won't we add a ball game today? I guess
it'll 12.50. Till least 155. What do you think? I could do it. Yeah?
I guess it with this important fact is very short though. Let's see, some photo visitors
sites. Oh, give me a break. Loyal female fan. Okay, well, we love you, honey, but boy,
this is weak. The last solar shops and restaurants, she wants to stand these to the
pool. Okay? Must see a visitor site. Lost all the shops and restaurants and the Shark
Valley Park bike or tram ride to see the alligators and the birds. The birds. Remember how
it feel here? Was in touch with nature. He was, you know, with birds and, remember that
scene? Uh-huh. And then all of a sudden they like pop right on the floor again. Poor
howard bill. Just like that. Shark Valley Park bike or tram ride to see the alligators
and the birds. Okay. Well, thanks, we had a great, very much, but never mind. I turned
that up for the guy to get some stuff because I don't have a shredder. I got a shredder
all right. Okay. It's called your acto. It was what it's called. Got over a thousand
votes already. Now, what did you say? 1200 today? Correct. That's Chris's, Chris's
girl today is 1200. Well, there's a plane of four-letter day. A little tiny plane landing
here. Collapse, I want to touch down. Little teeny tiny plane. Looks like the one from
the Jackson's. But everything, nobody got, nobody got, nobody got hurt. 1024, we got
1200 leaked. WDQAM. Hello. Hi. This is Bruce. I'm the Q1st of what man it is. WDQAM. Hello.
Hey, you know, you know, last week they were showing JFK on HBO and it's kind of scary.
Probably looking good by now. Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of rotting wave. Anyway, the similarities
between the way they did things back then with Jim Garrison and the discrediting him and
everything. Either what they do today. They probably watched the movie before the inauguration
and got the ideas from that. But anyway, the only thing to call and tell you your savage
and I'm out of material. Okay. So he said, which 5.670560 and pound 560 in the
Verizon singular wireless line. WDQAM. Hello. Hi. I would like to know if you or George
has seen a movie called The Rivers of Crafts? No. Yes. George says yes. I say no. And?
George, didn't make any sense to you at all if you like it? There were funny parts and
other. You like it? Yeah. Okay. I didn't get it. So what did you think of it? Well, my
boyfriend brought it over and I only watched 15 minutes of it because it was really strange.
I couldn't watch it. I didn't get it. It's not for everyone. Okay. Thank you. What's
it about? It's a bunch of comedians telling the same joke over and over again. It is? Yeah.
Are you serious? Sure. I've got you. I've got you. I've got you. I've got you.
I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior. I'm a senior.
Hello. Yes. Hey. Can I speak with Neil? Speaking. Neil, how are you doing? Okay. How are you doing?
I'm doing good. Doing good. Hey, I got one for the poll. Yeah. The question was what? What was the
question again? How could you have one for the poll if you don't know what the question is?
No, it was okay. So when someone comes down here, what they shouldn't miss, right? Right. That's correct.
Okay. They shouldn't miss or damn fly it out. That's not bad. I like that. I like that. That's good. If someone from
out of town visits South Florida, make sure they don't miss their outgoing. That's great. How's that? Right. Don't you like that?
I like it. That's beautiful. In fact, let me ask the entire audience. Do you like it? Yeah, they like it.
You're getting a sitting ovation, sir. Excellent job. Okay. That was fantastic. You see, if we take 40,000
calls like this, we're going to put this. See, the reason I'm doing this is because I feel sometimes I feel like we're
dying over here. You know what I mean? Like we're just drowning on the Titanic. And this station seems to be
a stale. His last year is Wonder Bread. That's the line I used yesterday, but you know, you can never say that too often.
Because Wonder Bread fills you eight different ways. But it's like cotton pantons, a matter of fact, wonder bread, isn't it?
Yeah, that's good. And so I think we got to like revitalize this place. I mean, who else is going to do it
beside the legendary Neil? Okay? And read a little bit of life back into this sleepy, dying giant. You know, because there's no football going on
now for a long time. And even the draft show is not until April 15 or something like that. And this is that time of the
year. I mean, hockey, anybody care about the panties or the national hockey league or the playoffs? Who's going to make it?
Anybody care even a little bit about that? And of course the heat. Well, you know, they wonder all last year. Yeah, who cares?
WDQ-AM, hello. Hold on.
Okay. WDQ-AM, hello.
Yeah, good morning, my friend. Good morning, sir.
What are you going to do about this? This is pretty my two-year-old Golden Wichiro and Steve, the damn dog food.
So I'm going to see what he's going to get to happen from now on.
I feed him people food. Okay? Feed him, uh, shat-telling all would be good. Yeah, see everybody's all whipped up about that.
You see a bunch of animals die from that dog food. I got the story in my pile here. I'll never get to it though.
Do you think I should? I think you should. It's important dog lover like we are. Dog lover like we are.
Well, I like dogs too. Still that one. Yeah. I wish I could have a dog here, man. I wish, oh, here it is.
Pedal owners nervous over the fallout from dual-gattainted food.
You know, these people have feed their dogs. I mean, I mean, I mean, you know how much I love dogs. I'm a big dog lover.
But people have feed their dogs like they cook up like a lamb, you know, and all this other gravy.
Oh, oh, all this people food. And then their kids are eating like a gravy train, you know.
Makes it sound gravy. Yeah, just that water.
The federal government yesterday released new troubling details about manufacturing or testing.
They said, prompted the recall of 60 million cans and pouches of potentially fatal pet food from store shelves throughout North America.
I got a potentially fatal pouch and I better do something about it. Is it a pouch or a punch?
The manufacturer on tario, Canada based menu foods. They've had a bit of been screaming about it here. A lot of screamers.
Tasted its moist pet food beginning in late February feeding the product to 40 to 50 dogs and cats after a series of complaints from pet owners.
Seven of those animals died. According to Steven Sunderloff, the FDA's tapetanurian, the mix of species was not immediately known.
Sounds pretty species to me, huh? They tested it more spread food. Let's feed it to these dogs and see if they stay alive or croak, you know.
And seven of them died. How come they didn't eat it? Menu foods, my ass.
Those tests prompted a massive product we called the gun last Friday.
A federal investigation is focusing on weak gluten, a common filler as a likely source of contamination.
Weak gluten. Is that what they mean by gluten for punishment? I think so.
The FDA has yet to tell how many reports it's received to cats and dogs suffering kidney failure or death.
The company's reported 10 deaths, nine cats and a dog. Well, only one dog but nine cats. That's not too bad.
Menu foods, manufacturers, and cells more than 50 North American brands, including IMs, America's choice, and Yukonuba.
You can what?
Yukonuba, if you try, the company became aware of a potential problem after receiving a number of older
complaints that dogs and cats were vomiting and suffering kidney failure after you got to the pubic and their gut set.
Well, Tide used to do that all the time just to piss me off, you know.
They would start chewing up a bunch of garbage and crap on the carpet, you know.
Any kind of mung-knows, and then they'd get all that lint in this throwy-dunk.
Right.
Oh, the food was sold under both store and major brand labels and Walmart, publics, windix, and other large retailers.
Soundflow to pet stores, among those, to pull some fed-pood products.
As a result of the recall, well, I'm a little tongue-tied here today. I don't know why I would do it.
I think I feel like I'm on drugs. And this is a good way to do it because cheaply you don't do any.
I feel like I'm on speed or something.
A pet smarts store in Evan Turret took down some 120 items previously offered for sale, shoppers have been returning them for refunds.
We want our money back, the dogs keeping his guts.
Although many food cells, its food under numerous brands, the FDA's sundaugh noted that the company's recall effects only about 1% of the total pet food supply.
The new recall covers the company's cuts and gravy-style food, which consists of chunks of meat and gravy sold in cans and four pouches from December 3rd to March 6th.
We're still trying to find out what the true picture is out there of animals. It's really just impossible to extrapolate at this point.
I don't think we can say extrapolate, can we?
No.
Other companies, Nestle Peer and the Pet Care Company, Procter and Gamble, the health pet nutritionist said that it's a precautionary recalling voluntarily some products made by many new foods.
The many unanswered questions surrounding the product recalls led to palpable anxiety among pet owners during the past few days.
Owners worry they may have poisoned, they may have poisoned, they beloved, campaigned unintentionally.
Carrier Silver, receptionist at Alton Road Animal Hospital on Miami Beach, said the clinic got 30 phone calls.
About 30 men!
During eight hours it was open Sunday, one person said it all except for his kidney failure and what a note the food was to blame.
And who to sue, I'm sure.
Silver said people described symptoms and what are their drugs and cats diagnosed over the phone, which you can't be done.
Hello, doctor, my dog, I've made his tail is hanging down, Tom Dooley.
I think people are starting to get a little crazy but we can't make a proper analization without blood work silver said it's obviously something people care about.
Although many foods designated two phone numbers that pet owners could call for information, 866 463 67 38 and 866 895 2708 many animal lovers said they couldn't get through.
Should I give those numbers again?
I in time.
In time!
Like Linda Blair said, I'll go and get around to it.
Wheat gluten itself will not cause kidney failure leading up to investigate to suspect contamination by other substances including heavy metals like cadmium and letter of fungal toxins.
Aflotoxin, a corn fungus sparked a 2005 dog food recall.
There's a fungus among us.
What is it?
Aflotoxin.
Many foods, folks, will mincerate tweets to the AP radio company who was still trying to finger it out.
They're trying to finger it out.
There's a fungus among you a study like that and George says you're right and I'm wrong.
Whatever the subject is, you're right I'm wrong.
Yeah, it's the most fun.
After all these years I got one, one out of 17 years.

Missy Boyz got a problem.
Crazy, crazy you think I have problems.
More than just being dumb.
It's called insanity.
All morning long before the show, George is sitting there.
George is the expert at North Carolina.
George knows it all, baby.
They found him alive.
How do you like that?
I don't know.
They hit him with five shots and he's still alive.
That's because he read that hatchet book.

WQAM, hello.
Hi Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Rob.
Just to make a short story.
I'm part in a gas pump.
It's raining like hell down here.
I'm part of the gas pump.
I hear bang.
Car hits me.
Now, trust me.
Okay, yeah, exactly.
Thank you.
So I go and round it back.
My truck is looking.
And guys, you know, he's getting out of the car and he says,
oh, I couldn't see you.
I couldn't see you now.
My truck is a huge truck.
Anyway, I says, well, you do some damage to your car.
He gets out and he has sandals and white socks.
Okay, I got to tell you something.
So I helped him out.
I said, well, you can probably get this car out of the salvage.
I looked at the car and it was a Volvo.
I said, well, you're going to be paying some bucks.
He's disguised in tears.
My wife's going to kill me.
Oh, my God.
My wife's going to kill me.
And of course, on the front plate is Ontario.
I'm out of Ontario.
Well, it's because wife kills him.
Yeah, all on the front plate is Ontario.
All the bad drivers are from Canada.
You see that?
You've been talking about the frogs.
That's how stupid this guy is.
Okay?
Yeah, all the bad, all the blue hair is all the people that are creating drive-thrues
where there aren't any drive-thrues.
Yeah, that's all South Floridians, baby.
But they're all in Ontario.
I'll take my chances here.
In fact, I don't miss driving period.
Look, it's like a contest to see who can be the worst driver down here.
Yeah.
Well, at least they're participating in it.
On the front, my son played his on Terry.
Notice how fake this story was.
First it was this, and then it was the Volvo and something else.
Schmuck.
Yeah, that Canada really sucks, Near.
You better get out of there while they're getting this good.
Okay.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
I'm on my way.

But did you guys know that the singer from Boston killed himself?
Yeah, that's old news, man.
Yeah, I knew I saw it.
Hey, easy for you to laugh, man.
Very funny, huh?
Elvis dies in a crapper.
This guy's laughing about it.
That would be funny unless it was you.
5-6-7, that's because I'm legendary.
Damn, God!
You can almost think about it.
I really feel like we started yesterday and we kind of cut off into past like I was at birth.
A little bit overdone if you asked me.
But we started yesterday and then the ball game came along.
But today, today we're putting this damn thing back on a map.
Okay?
In spite of Joe Bell, in spite of Clarence don't call me a Jack As Dero,
in spite of all this other hazard riots going on, in spite of the square table and the oblong table and that crap.
Jesus, got all mighty.
That toast I guarantee if you check that out, he's still on the payroll across the street, he's got to be.

True story.
I'm having dinner over there at Manero's stay-cow's before it shut down.
And the jockey like Frankie Dittori.
Yeah, I don't know if he...
Did you get the Derby horse this year?
How do I know if he's got the green horse?
I'm not sure.
But anyway, he's in there with his manager, Andy Rothman, and they're having...
Greatest shock in the world, by the way.
Oh, Andy Rothman is having dinner.
Yeah.
Andy Rothman and him are having dinner and Manero's stay-cow's.
You always pick Frankie Dittori or whatever more he's on, you know?
Yeah.
So, let me ask you this question.
Yeah.
Who's Andy Rothman?
He's a really good friend of mine who really...
Obviously, really, really good.
You're fair.
Yeah.
Probably not as good as you'd like him to be, but it sounds like a really, really good friend.
Maybe that's why he knows David Sugarman and Steve Stone.
Wow.
You talk about...
This guy's almost as good as the Harry Benson guy we had years ago.

Mostly in England, as you know?
And when he's over here in the big races, plunge your guts.
Don't pay any attention to what the Huppert tells you.
Okay?
Plunge your guts on Frankie Dittori, man.
When the money is down, he's going to be in town.
Whatever that means.

Chany is in the hospital.
Oh, this is good news.
Wait a minute.
The vice president is over at George Washington University in the middle of the...
Ah, just a check-out.
Well, don't give us no false alarms, okay?
On you.
Jesus Christ Almighty.
Chany is in the hospital, Virginia.
They're checking to see if he's got any heart, which is highly unlikely.
1075 votes on the poll today, I think.
And you said, 1200, I'm going to say...
We can do better than that.
I mean, that's not exactly going out on a limb, you know?
Chris.
You see the already collapsed arm.
Huh?
I'm there.
Collapse from hunger.
Now, you guys don't have food come into the...
Yeah, of course.
We're in the highways.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, highways, for taking care of our people.
They're okay.
The White House is just a routine check-up to see if...
First they're going to do the lobotomy to see if there's any brain in there.
They're going to start looking in his...
Right, go first.
And then they're going to check to see if he's really all-heart.
The worst evil doer on the face of their...
He makes Hermann Garing look like a Sunday school teacher.
That's what this guy does.
Of course, beware of their Sunday school teacher.
The biggest names.
He can only say how he is.
He can only say how he is.

I see that ad was on NBC News last night.
That's on the internet, making the rounds.
Nobody knows who put it on.
And supposedly it was the Barack Obama campaign behind it.
No.
Negative ad about her.
You didn't see that?
No.
The comparator like to a Nazi bitch and stuff like this.
And all these people are like,
and the end is Barack Obama campaign.
Which of course it's not.
But that's the kind of crap that winds up on the internet.
You wait and see, Mr.
You might see nothing yet.
You're going to see a political lynching that they're going to try and him like you have never dreamed in your wildest imagination.
You'll see.
Anyone in the why?
Why?
Because it's the American-F and wait.
So this kid that you said is that he's alive, he's able to walk, he was found about a mile and a half from camp.
Life goes on, CNN has spent hours and hours.
There's 300 million people in the USA.
And they just picked out this goofy kid with a red hair and a glasses and they said,
well let's make a big difference about this.
You know?
1094 votes on the poll though.
1094.
I'm going for 13, man.
I'm not settling for 1200 today.
No way Jose.
Because we got two and a half hours for Christ.
Yes, do it!
Yeah, we can do 1300 today.
Chris.
What are you going to say then?
Let's say we can do it.
1094 on there right now.
And because it's, yeah, we do 1300 in this poll.
It's not a bad poll.
It's not a great poll.
It's a poll.

Yeah.
We asked him, uh, 70% of the American public voted.
Well, let me ask you this question.
What do they put him on there for in the first place?
That's the question.
Now whether he tore up in the West.
Let me and you and the rest of it, you know, not these, uh, you know, marching down the street.

Chris said 1200.
I'm saying 13, man.
We won't settle for less than 13 today.

You'll see everybody gets a free party in their pants.
WDQAM.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I'm driving down 95 C. Waterdale in a monsoon.
Yeah.
And my wife calls me and starts freaking out and talking about poison, cat food.
I don't know if you're thinking about it or standing about it.
Never heard anything about it.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Tell her, don't eat too much of it.
Okay, that's the best, that'd be the best line.
Don't just taste a little bit first to make sure.
And then if you pass out, call me back or not.
Jesus, God almighty, man.
It's just to talk about, I'm supposed to be out of touch.
Touch this.
Well, there's that guy's the kids father we're going to keep showing him.

Here's a nice pool suggestion from our friends at university
who don't do any work down there at all.
I like this pool suggestion.
If I could be somebody else for one day,
we never did this before.
I did a similar one where if you could trade lives with someone
but like permanently.
This is a good one.
If I could be somebody for just one day.
Right I would be I'd be Bill Jace cuz then I read the bell like a whole bunch of checks to myself on the next day
Go back to be me. Yeah very good next day. Go back to being like
Pretty queen I go back to being Brady Quinn. Mm-hmm
I'll tell you one thing if I was Brady Quinn for a day. I'd be real busy. I'll take it that
My my my look out now. I'd be real busy
And look at this George W. Bush look at the names they have on here. You want to be George W. Bush for one day?
God
You Bill Clinton swore to be Clinton Wayne Heizinga, you know, wow
That'll change your complexion. I guess Tiger Woods that would also probably change most of your complexion
Well, that sounded like a racial comment to me. Let's get your rose on it
Hugh Hefner Neil Rogers. Oh, yeah, oh good Howard sperm anybody who but who I am I then that's certainly in South Florida
That would definitely go for big when we did this pull I gotta be me

You got it. I'll see now you got you got the songs out of the guys really by artist all of the above
I see and I hate this pool. Yeah, it's not a bad one
Now you think I'd give the phone numbers again on the dog food thing
Because you know very seriously we have a lot of dual lovers out there and the fact the word dog lovers
If there's menu foods is got two phone numbers that pet owners could call for information before you go poisoning your dog
Your cat. I go ahead give it a shot. You don't put your dog

I believe it was like two days ago
So I shouldn't bother with it. It's just a lot of men have been yesterday. I know it
I thought ESPN yesterday after me recently signed off the linebacker
Joy Porter didn't need long to live up to his reputation as one of the NFL's most controversial players
It says he was set it for misderminer battery Sunday night after allegedly punching another NFL player in the face at a Vegas casino
Anya used to go to Vegas a lot. Oh no
Porter had a brief altercation with Cincinnati Bengals left tackle Levi Jones
Oh Levi is coming there's at the Eli is coming. He'll be dog night. Eli. How about Levi Harner? He's been dead. How many years?
Well the gaming table that palms casino Vegas police department spokesman Martin Wright said right said Jones who chose to price charges
Received on-site medical treatment for a small cut Jones also claimed several of his gold chains were stolen during the melee
A source said the six five three hundred and seven pound Jones is telling those close to him that he was jumped at the table by six
other people over with Porter the source said Jones is claiming was hitting the back of the head by one of Porter's
Associates just before being punched in the push by the six three two hundred and fifty pound linebacker

Now what is the story from La Paz Bolivia La Paz
I don't know how you use it. I think it was like a speech. You can't lie. I don't know how they talk in Bolivia is it all?
Look a brassy I think that's pretty outrageous that way after all these years we've been calling to look a bratsy and
And we're wrong. Yeah, go. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
I am Marlon and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding
ha ha ha ha ha
He's a very scary guy
The farmers and women it says always Coca Cola out of Bolivia's Coca growers have their way
The farmers want the word coka drop by the u.s. software and company arguing that the potent shrub
belongs to the cultural heritage of this
Andean nation
Bolivia or the coke relief in poses in India life
I got Andean music
Or the coke relief in fuses every day life and is sacred to many
That's Andean music the choice
is. I see. Play by Andy. How about Amos and Andy music? A commission of
Koch industry representatives advising an assembly regarding Bolivia's
constitution past a resolution last week calling on the Atlanta based
company to take Koko out of its name asking the UN to decriminalize the
leaf. Go leaf go. The resolution demands international companies that
include in their commercial name the name of Koko refrain from using the name
of their sacred leaf in their products. Yes, how about just Khoa? Would you
care for a Kola? Well, I don't like that coke. Kola anyway. So they can
call it whatever they want. How about they call it Kaka Cola? Yeah, how about the
uncool? See Pepsi Cola works fine with me and they're not upset about that.
That's a lot of my drink in here. Oh, I'm drinking a diet coke with caffeine.
That explains why I'm so hopped up today like a Mexican jumping bee. The
commission which met for three days in super 250-fire miles southeast of La
Paz is part of an effort led by President Ivo Morales to rehabilitate the
image of the plant used in the Andean and these for millennia but better known
as the basing wheel you know cocaine. We better send our fat ass governor's
daughter to check it out. I'll go with it. Koko Cola stated last week its
trademark is the most valuable and recognized brand in the world baby and is
protected under Bolivian law. Don't be messing with our Koka baby. The statement
repeated the company's past and I was that Koka Cola's ever used cocaine is
an ingredient but with sound and I wasn't a natural coca leaf was used to flavor
the soda. They need to understand our situation said David Herrera, a state
government supervisor for the Koka rich Chapade region. They exported Koka's
raw material for Koka Cola and we can't even freely sell it in Bolivia. Who now
wants a living Bolivia anyway? The Bolivian government regulates the sale of
cocaine and prevent use by the drug trade and its natural state degree leave is
only a mild stimulant. Let me see I got I got it in here. What's that? Malta
stimulant? In my plans. In Bolivia. In Bolivia. I only wish to put
a pledge. I only wish. In Bolivia's white
color office is Koka T. you're certain instead of coffee. I have a piece of advice
for all you young punks under 100 out there. Don't get old okay. That's my
piece of advice. Don't ever get old. Oh it's so it'll happen to you. Oh no. Huh? Yeah
exactly. In Bolivia's white color orifices Koka T. is served instead of coffee
and the country's farmers, miners and truckers chew believe to get through the
long work days. That's what we do with two aim is not what they do in the sales
department. They chew on coca leaves. I don't think so. Not those leaves. They're
chewing on something. The government wants to you enter the criminalized trade
and coca based products to promote its exports. Moralesay former Koka grower
thinks an international market for a Koka to ride products such as tea, flour,
liquor even toothpaste would draw some of the companies and watch out what kind of
toothpaste you use in baby. I should. I should. I should. I should. I should. Would
draw some of the companies estimated 65,500 acres of cocoa away from the drug
trade but the US which finds which funds Bolivia and Koka eradication program is
adamantly opposed to such proposals continue to encourage more cocoa
production. I'm sure you don't want to have that happen doing. No yeah that would
be better. Things go better with cocoa baby. 1145 on a poll we got 13 hundred
of it easy today. It's fight about crowd fat Chris's a salami. Cracked through a
frist. Somebody. Somebody you can do I am hello. Hey God. Yes sir. I was just
what I want to tell you that there I went to Bolivia one time and because of the
altitude you get real bad headaches. Yeah and they gave you this tea that takes
it away and I didn't find out so later that the tea contained the coca leaves
and it makes you feel real good afterwards. I mean it was it wasn't it wasn't it
was drinking it or snorting it. No you're drinking it just opened up your blood
vessels and you're drinking it makes you you know release those headaches but
hey one other question for for George there for once a year. I'm going to go to
China in November and I'm taking up my trip in Beijing and I'm thinking of going
to another country but since Beijing is so far north I wanted to get the
colors and your opinion of you know where where I'm supposed to go maybe Tokyo or
something. Okay yeah go to Japan instead of China. I'm asking George this I just had a
friend that came back from China. Oh I'm okay. Okay anyway something
guys later. Hey George yeah go Cooper. Okay see this is all inside. Apparently
yeah I'm just yeah I'm just going to China and I don't care what my friend says
about how fun it was in China. Don't go there. Yeah it's the Mexico of Asia. Really?
It's it's the in Japan they use the Chinese illegal aliens to do their cheap labor
the way that we do with the Mexicans over here. I see. So what does that mean?
Don't go to China. And what about Japan? Go to Japan. Now would you rather be learning Japanese or
turning Japanese? 152 votes on the pool. 1152 if someone from out of town visits
South Florida make sure they don't miss the near Roger show. He's legendary man he's a
fat old fag and he's a real hoot. That's right. You're gonna see I just I just want to give
people a little uh that's my goal now the rest of the time I'm on here. We're not gonna save the
world from George Bush or any of the other Nazis out there. Just a little chuckle every now and then
like that. That's all we can do man. That's a public service and the price is right. I would advise
them not to come 304 that was my vote. Don't go to South Florida you'll regret it and you may
never get out. South beach 232 I hate this pool in near 62 5.3%. They're outbound flight. Don't

wait a couple of months before actually putting it out. I'm sorry my son is breaking it.
Did you just ask him not to break the block? I'm so out to be elected. Yes. After George Bush gets
reelected print all you want. We won't care then. Why would I want to do that?
Hello. Money growing up. What? Why? Why? Why? Oh my. If you're booked for a lease the terrorist win.

Don't forget if you're seeing the Joyce Line New Borough as in Gustave a little bit the terrorist win.
Don't forget those things. Okay. That's right. 1169 votes on a poll and Chris was saying 1200 votes today.
Man you sell me really short. Nature already did that. I don't know. Really sure. What is wrong with you?
In fact you know something? If I really if I were to know what I know now of course that's what life is all about.
If I'd have just known back then what I know now all new young people out there just remember what all Uncle the
old told you okay know it now meaning when you're young know it now and do it now and enjoy it now.
Believe me because then you get all like me and you'll think well if only I had known then because
that you're ain't going to happen now like a our chance 1171 oh god see this is the punishment I
get for making fun of old people all those years that's right all those years on the air I'm talking
about all the early bird dinners and the old crutches and all the old people with the lime game and now I'm
one of them. Yeah. Oh god. I'm not by a long shot yet. What do you mean by that? Well you're not
nearly as cretchy as they are. No no I'm not and then Sam like them I'm just talking about the
from the age factor from the max factor. Let's see what do we got on the pool 1171 let me refresh it
because I'm thinking well I know we're going to do 13 1172 see that they're coming in by the ones

by you young punks we don't want no spring break on four-large of day old beat we don't want no young
punks on South Beach with all that heavy jewelry on and all them tubing the goofballs down there and

you'd make it with pork. 5 6 7 0 5 60 fats. Trayf baby it's not halal. You sound like one of them
terrorists to me you better start to have a lot of fat. It's not interesting how much in common.
This is what really is it's it's almost amusing it's sick but it would be funny if it wasn't all
the death in the blood shed. The Jews in the Arabs who got so much in common know they're in the
circumcision thing and they don't want to eat trayf they don't want pork and kosher and halal I
guess they're basically the same thing right and all this has a ride you know there's no feud like a
family feud yeah that must be it WDQA M hello WDQA M hello

course because it was so legendary 5 6 7 I see I I shouldn't know yesterday it was just an
aberration because I got all whipped up and I'm thinking to myself what it it's like one of those
things if you could package it and sell it you know I mean that that's how good it was like like
occasionally like there one call we had earlier I have no idea what was so good about it but there
was one you know and if you could just package it and sell it and multiply it and make you know
make color of it but they can't do it we want everybody listening there this business about being
the same four or five idiot colors on there let's get four or five thousand idiot colors then
we'll have something okay jolly joe bill then I'll believe what you say about this phone being
all I damn high-falute and important like we had yesterday yesterday it was like a fly opener man
was I unbelievable wasn't it it was great even George who was probably the worst hard
ass I've ever known in my life even George says it was great you just heard him say it was
big and say what we'll and say like with real enthusiasm you know I can say like Tony the tiger you
know that'll make WQAM hello don't do it QAM nearly yes sir I'm another idiot caller yeah I love you man
okay bring it back okay WQAM hello yeah so I call the gas from Chicago a dim-witted symbol boy
okay because the Boston did not blow up the baseball the Chicago ball from Barclay in the
Barclay ball that could flew up so before you guys tell people in it he didn't eat it himself
what was he talking about long hits five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty
in the Verizon singular wireless line that must have been Bobby you know from our mice face
thing Bobby go away Bobby WQAM hello now I like speaking ill speaking sir hey Neil I am an idiot but

take it's really good for your heart gets your pulse rate down I said it's very important stuff
you know I've been taking it for years and they haven't they you know I used to hate GNC because
I thought that everything they made was really very generic and very I don't know I think they
just have everything yeah you know they've had all the same stuff and bottles with different labels
on you know but but actually they do have some pretty good stuff now and the coq 10 is great so I
go there because I can't get it anywhere else I mean you can get it in drug stores and stuff but
not this particular brand because it's GNC brand so I guess it makes sense if you want GNC brand
where do you go you don't go to rexhall you don't go to shoppers drug bar day you go to a GNC

Broward Circuit Judge Lawrence Corda is facing a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession oh my god
after city police officers say they busted in for smoking pot in a Hollywood park Sunday afternoon
the judge played a role in the end of the Kulsmith case when he briefly handled a small part of the
paternity battle over the former playboy centerful's infant daughter court of 59 was not arrested
but was issued a notice to appear April 26th in the satellite courthouse in a Hollywood
court and state law enforcement records show no prior legal problems for the judge so
he could qualify for a first-time offender pretrial drug diversion program but the allegation
that he used in legal drug could result in a complaint to the judicial qualification commission
and possible discipline like whips and chains maybe man if the judicial watchdog agency found
his conduct violated judicial rules he could face a reprimandor removal from the bench anyone
can file a complaint with the commission court I couldn't be reached for comment this by messages
left with his judicial assistant and chambers on Monday it wasn't clear if he had hired an attorney
his assistant setting was on the bench Monday presiding over trial also unclear was whether
court a family court judge would remain on the bench while the charge is pending the judicial
qualification mission said Monday that no complaints been filed with the agency so far and at this
point it's up to Broward Chiefs Judge Dale Ross to decide if courtes should continue to work
is resolved about two p.m. Sunday three officers who were in Stanley Goldemore Memorial Park

odor what they found to be marriage a weeny Rodi said they followed the smell of a gentleman

right but he was being active with it the officers who were in plain clothes and exercising while
on duty is permitted by department policy said the joint tested positive for marijuana it tested
positive for marijuana oh I know how they test the difference okay thirty two hundred dead soldiers

And certainly not trying to save the world.
But the global warming thing is out of this world.
Great stories today about it.
But how on earth do you think that the rest of the world is going to get on the job with us?
There's no way we can save it.

This is the kind of show that we're going to be doing for now.
I don't care whether Jolly, Rolly, or Joe or anybody else in there.
I'm just doing my show.
I'm doing my thing.
I got my personal consultant's author advising me, you know.
Maybe I'll get Walter Sabre on the phone to, you know, give me some really bad advice.
This is what they want.
Sitting here and reading all these depressing stories about George Bush's in Nazi and big Chinese in Nazi.
And here I'm carrying Rumsfeld was in Nazi.
I mean, we all night Carl Roe was in Nazi.
Is there any news about them?
What are we going to do about it?
Huh?
Huh?
Exactly.
And I blame George for it.
Sorry about that.
Promoting all those stupid aspects.
I mean, I've got a few, you know.
Scientists accused his White House of Nazi tactics.

Oh, not another priest.
Jesus, God Almighty.
Jesus, Chrysler Motors.
Delray beats no less.
Ah.
A priest accused along with another clergyman.
Oh, we know who these guys are.
This is just enough Chuck on this story.
A priest accused along with another clergyman.
And if stealing more than $8 million from their church,
once cracked that an auditor parish funds was a waste of money,
well, then look at the date on this March 9th.
I already did this story.
Sorry, I got all excited.
I already had done this story, man.
This is March 9th.
And today is March 20th.
Last time I checked, we had this looked awfully familiar about Father Gwinin and John Skien.
They're Skien and the Skien on Thin Ice.
So whatever they're doing, hand in hand, gland in hand.
All this crap with a church.
You think you're not sick now, Brandon?
I'm going to come over there and put you way into a coma.

Oh, the odd men.
Oh, my God.
He's got the...
Gremlins with your friend Zach Gallagher.
Well, good.
Enjoy it.
Brandon, I turn out right now.
Warm up the set.
Jesus, God Almighty.
Oh, my life.
My what happened to my life?
Sometimes I feel...
You know how that goes.
I wish I had the original one.
You do, don't you?
No, I don't.
The build called her one.
That's what I...
I would not.
This is not the original one.
Are you any reminder what?
Sometimes I feel myself...
Was it on that CD I sent you while back?
What?
It's on the original.
I don't know.
I'm not out of here.
The dream and again.
I just love that man.
I just love when they pick it like that.
Starts bleeding all over the place.
Club AD at an impol.
It's Tuesday, March 20th.
The day that the old man finally gave up with a mush.
You know, no more mushing.
Remember I told you I used to have that guy named BuzzMushin?
No, Fat Guy.
Yeah, I did.
It's smelling and smelling.
When I worked there for about a week.
I told you that story.
This was a big fat guy and we go to breakfast together.
I was, you know, 80 dollar a week job.
It's snowing and snowing because they couldn't find any of us a real job.
So they hired us, you know, as a counselor, job counselors.
Total bunch of crap.
At any rate, BuzzMushin was this fat guy's name.
And we go into the diner across from where we worked in Hollywood.
And he would order like pancakes and French toast and bacon and cereal and the two eggs and a small diet drink.
That's a true story.
Yeah, sorry.
Food or like everything on a menu and then a small diet drink.
BuzzMushin.
Enough of the mushin, baby.
Okay, I get the message.
Okay, hang on a second.
Who?
Who?
Tell me what this is.
Oh, no, the original.
Let's sit.
Sometimes I feel.
Oh, my God.
Like life.
Pass me by.
Sometimes I feel.
Like people don't want to smile.
You got it.
It's a mess.
C.D.S.
I do.
You sent me one.
The whole bunch of miscellaneous crap on it, remember?
The nebocca brine package.
Biff collar on a radio.
Biff collar on a radio.
Maridio.
That's what that's.
That's what that's.
Mmm.
That's a bunch of weaverisms and stuff on there.
Or just a sort of crap that I found on cards.
Really?
Things.
I've tried.
They don't make a much build cauldron anymore, I'll take it that.
Okay, now this is not the disc, but this is an interesting one.
It's got a lot of stuff on there that I never played with.
You're going down.
Explosion will be an extraordinary magnitude.
Oh, maybe that's why I never played with.
I'm a moon nerd.
Get their basketball down in there.
Spank with moon rocks.
Alright.
Nothing like getting spank with moon rocks.
Isn't that how you get your moon off?
I'm a moon nerd.
Get their basketball down in there.
Spank with moon rocks.
Okay, 1292 votes on a poll.
I told you we had 13 in the bank.
Oh, and there's that ugly kid with glasses.
That boy scout cubed in North Carolina.
He's going to get medical attention after being a member of the United States.
And then they'll take him up in the woods and see if they can move him again.
They try like hell.
And he came back.
So I have it a bad pit.
And you take it out of the woods and you let it go and hope that it...
And then all of a sudden there's a scratching at the door.
Oh, no, not you again.
WQAM, hello.
QAM.
QAM.
What is it?
It's Ron and there's a good one.
That's not the question.
Who it is, it's a quote of one of those.
Wow.
WQAM, hello.
Oh, I can.
W. Well, thanks for finding the answer in the question.
QAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
We got a big fan out here in Mahokie.
Yeah.
And you know, South Florida radio hasn't been the same since Rick and Sons last.
Yeah, thank God.
I'm in Mahokie.
Yeah, Rick Routi was big in Mahokie.
In fact, the son said he probably owned a long in the Mahokie.
Now we said, in the Mahokie.
In the Mahokie.
1292, I bet if I refresh this baby, and then I say we're going to go way over 13 today.
1295, they're coming in little chunks now, Chris.
Eat your heart out.
And the Perichungles got full.
I thought that the, I guess way back when it wasn't in the Gables, the Perichungle or was it in the Grove.
I'm trying to think it was a South Miami where was it?
It would be original.
It would be down 111.
112.
112 in Galloway or something.
I forgot the other cross three.
Galloway, that's where Norman Brothers produces.
Man, do I love Norman Brothers' produce?
I wonder if it's still there.
It is.
Can't believe it used to be okay before it got so overcrowded.
Nobody's speaking English no more.
That was the problem.
No, No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
WQ way.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Jerry, about the Judge and Ann and the Colonel got called in the car.
Smoke a weed.
WQA and Hello.
Call the police.
WQA and Hello.
That's still got nothing.
You sure now?
Okay, just double second.
5, 6, 7, he can call 2, 3 times a day.
Just in case, one of these days, he'll say, oh, I got something.
But it might be contagious, you never know.
So you'll see that they'll make it come back.
You just, you know, you expect too much all at once.
I'm sticking with it, man. I'm going to persevere.
Alright, I'm sticking my nose right to the old Brian Stahl.
So if I could be like, like Glenn Campbell, man, I'll be a Brian Stone Cowboy.
WQA and Hello.
QA and Hello.
Yeah, very general used to be the cross tree was one 12th and the whole cover.
Right.
Right.
And didn't it go out with the hurricane or something?
They moved it over to the beach.
It's like I'm a little island now.
Very jungle island.
Well, and then inevitably nobody can get there because there's nobody going.
Nobody wants to go.
There are four votes.
Four votes out of 495.
That's pretty lame.
That's pretty lame.
To go see the parrots in the McCaws, you know, you can go see the parrots in the Trappocanon.
Next time you go to Vegas.
Okay.
You ever go in the Trappocanon?
Sure.
I just had pretty good luck in the Trappocanon.
That's where the rap city used to be.
That is correct.
Oh, man.
Was that a great restaurant?
They had the damn best.
The best.
What is the dessert I'm trying to think of now?
Not bake the last one.
What's the other one?
Banana's Foster.
Banana's Foster.
Now you're talking.
Now we finally got to the meat of the matter.
Banana's Foster.
I think we might have had that there too.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Seeing you wonder, you scratch your head.
You're going to have to go to the so great when out of business.
The rap city restaurant inside the Trappocanon.
Maybe somebody will know.
Maybe somebody knows Jaime Roth.
Or maybe Frankie Pantangely might know.
Come and have a problem with nothing.
Can you hit it on the side of the picture more than night?
Frankie.
I sure will shoot it.
Mike.
Are you shooting high up in the St. Aaron Mountains?
And you're making, uh, what do you think it's happening?
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's happening.
Oh, I'm looking at this.
Sorry, Frankie.
Brockport, New York.
That's right near Rochester, my hometown.
Oh, it's all over the place.
It's like a disease.
It's spreading.
A 52-year-old Roman Catholic priest is accused of forcibly touching a female coworker.
Well, at least it's a female, as time.
And well, then say what she was.
The Reverend Peter Aynon Bodu was arrested and charged with three misdemeanor counts
of harassment and one of forcible touching.
He was a reign before Brockport Village Judge Lys Friday,
released to return to court December 6th.
And this is the 16th of March.
The DIC Sir Rochester said in the statement that Aynon Bodu requested and was granted a
personally evabisance until a finalist was sentenced to the charges.
The charges accused him of kissing a woman with whom he worked a few months ago.
Little didn't say where he kissed her though.
Remember that song by the Everly Brothers?
Where I kissed you?
Yeah.
Aynon Bodu was ordained in his native Ghana in 1984.
Where I kissed you?
Backed away.
And came to Rochester in 1988.
He served the pastor of the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Brockport
since 1999.
Oh, I love that's my favorite church.
The Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Brockport.
I'm going right now.
I'm going to get on my knees.
Here's one that says, are we ever going to be able to listen to your show here in Orlando?
Yeah, it gets your computer.
I moved here five years ago, but 90% of talk radio is conservative.
The only good show is the Phillips file, but he's known as the Rogers.
And this is Viva la Canada.
I think it's Phillips or something?
No, Phillips.
What's that guy's name?
He's always talking about me like everybody else.
I can't think of it.
Garden Phillips?
Midnight Phillips?
No.
Phillips show.
No.
Phillips screwdriver.
I like that.
I always get to have one in your back pocket.
Don't sit down fast, though.
13 out of 11 votes, baby.
Unbelievable.
I'm the only one.
I'm the only one.
Not as unbelievable as the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary before.
Now the folks get bent on you.
And the powers you possess.
Or since you saved his life with your flight scissors, right?
He's got a job for you to do.
What?
What?
Virgin Mary.
Virgin Mary.
You have a brand new style too.
We love the way you want your doom.
With the victory on your chest and full proofs to light dress,
The bending of the war of prayer.
Oh.
Virgin Mary.
Virgin Mary.
Who's with the speed of what the sound?
Sex of that nice, straight to hell.
When a building starts to roll,
We go to the east and we know
Your expression comes with my hateful.
Oh.
What is that?
What is it?
All that we say and do is right.
I know that.
One 19, that's what our management says here.
That's the esports mafia, QAAM.
13 out of 11 votes on a poll in case you didn't hear me talking over the Virgin Mary.
Don't be talking over the Virgin Mary man.
She might have something really important they'd say,
Especially when she's hanging on to them over passage in Chicago,
Or on the side of the bank building in clear water.
She hangs out in some very strange places of the Virgin Mary.
Paul and the Gable says the pair of jungle moves to Watson Island and now it sucks.
Maybe that's why it's bringing up the rear on our poll today.
I knew there had to be a reason.
It says it's just another modern iteration of a once classic place to visit.
It might as well go on the way of the serpentarium.
It says, oh no.
Norman is still strong.
Norman brothers as a shorties.
Isn't that why they spend a billion dollars to build the metro rail so that everybody goes to the shorties bar.
That's right.
I'm going to tell you something.
They must know the right people because when somebody, when the government spends a billion dollars of your tax dollars,
So everybody can go to lunch at shorties.
You've got to say, all right.
I respect that a lot.
13, 15 out of 14.
If we really put the pedal to the metal man,
Did I say something about 14?
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Did I say that?
So the guy that called earlier for my email is writing a book about churches and clergy and the things they do.
They do things they say and he's heard me talk about my experiences and wants to pick my brain and get some stories.
Well, I can say that on the air.
I guess he didn't want to.
Well, why not?
I don't know.
I think he's not embarrassing.
He just flipped a little cash out of the table for this or what?
He's not really any treasure island scams.
Hi, a pally.
Or something like that.
I wish, but so far.
I know something that I just don't on me.
This is, I don't know how to say it, but this has been a phenomenal day for me.
Well, I'm serious.
It's been great all day.
A watershed day.
It's been a watershed day.
I don't know what that means, but they say that.
I mean, I'm going to the watershed and get spanked with the moon night.
I'm going to the sun over.
You know what they say?
On the moon?
Nerds get their pants pulled down and they are spanked with moon rock.
Oh.
But that's another piece of good news.
It's been a long time since Fatboy has bugged us.
You know, that particular Fatboy?
Yeah.
That one like,
Hi, a pally.
Yeah.
But this has been a watershed day in my life.
I don't know what it's just, everything is like falling into place.
Like it like in a puzzle.
You know, you're taking the pieces of a puzzle and putting them together.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds awfully melodramatic to me.
And it is.
Oh.
Don't tell me another one.
Worcester.
This is from Worcester Mass, or some people say,
would you please pass the Worcester Shire Sauce?
Or is it Worcester?
They say it's a somewhere.
Isn't it amazing how it literates some people are?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Pass the Worcester or Shorch?
A suspended priest who was arrested earlier this year after allegedly assaulting
his mother and sister has been arrested again on similar charges.
Well, maybe there are a couple of bitches who knows, you know?
The Reverend Joseph Koonin, 50, was arrested Friday,
and it's scheduled to be arraigned in doubly court next Monday on charges
including domestic assault and battery.
On a person over 65, his mother and a disabled person, his sister is mentally retarded.
Oh, lovely.
Lovely.
Pops.
He also faces charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, a 12 pack of Pepsi.
Oh.
I hate when they use that.
Ah!
Ha!
Worcester police charge in Anthony Saud told the telegram and he said it was to
that both women had superficial injuries.
Police were called to the residents by a neighbor who had been contacted by Koonin's sister, Patricia Loiselle.
Koonin lives with a sister and mother, Mabel Koonin.
Mabel, black label.
You ever hear those spots?
Of course not.
Nope.
He was removed from, isn't it amazing?
Not amazing.
But it's kind of neat that in different parts of the country there are different like regional
beers, you know?
Like Genesee, Jenny, in North-State, New York, and black label.
Now who is a...
What are the callings black label?
Is that who makes black label callings?
I don't know.
I'll take your word for it.
Mabel, black label.
And then of course there's always the one from Utica.
You see.
Utica club.
You see.
He was removed from ministry at St. John's.
When I start battling like this, this means for sure that I'm...
They're going to find me like a little pile of soddest at the bottom, hopefully after two o'clock.
Right here at the bottom of my chair.
He was removed from ministry at St. John's.
Roman Catholic Church in August 2002 by former Worcester Dyshees Bishop.
Daniel Riley, an oak him to Rick, after allegations at Koonin committed sexual misconduct in the 70s,
before he became a priest, before he put on the frock.
Now let me ask you, if you put on the frock, does that make you look like...
Friar tuck?
Friar frock.
Friar.
Friar.
Friar.
Friar frock.
And then try to wear that baby.
And I think I am becoming an important thing.
I've just been too much... so much exciting activity today.
I'm like...
I'm going to fall into a pile of mush right in the chair.
No more mush.
In February, Koonin was arrested on charges including domestic assault and battery,
and intimidating a witness after another dispute between Koonin and sister and his mother.
Sounds like some domestic problems there, you know?
In August, both women filed statements with the court asking that the charges be drafted
and the charges later dismissed.
But he's back at it again.
Lots of priestess there were lots of problem, multi-problems, as they say, in Italia.
That guy was telling me about the bumper sticker.
Can you believe that guy?
About the Neo-Guy bumper sticker in Italy and Rome?
Why would he make up a story like that?
Yeah, that's right.
What kind of a lunatic, what kind of a maniac caught on the Neo-Rodger show?
What kind of a story like that?
I mean, there's way better stories to make up if you were going to make one up.
Watch your language, Brandon. He's back again on this incident.
I'm telling you, these guys have got me going upside the back where it must be punishment.
It must be punishment for something evil I've done.
Well, you deserve it.
I do deserve it.
Too much mush.
Too much mush?
The dogs that I did arrive right, race?
And what is the I did arrive, race?
Or is it that dick-perton bit at that time?
Yeah, it's a long-distance dog sled race.
Dog sled race.
In a last one.
And they say mush to the dogs?
They do.
They do the dogs say to them like, point.
I think it's Eskimo or Inuit.
1320 Inuit.
Oh, we got the Inuits here, baby.
That's what I heard.
Yeah.
Say mush to what they've actually been doing.
I can't get out of the new I knew DeFo's a real...
Yeah.
Say mush to what it's he if they give you some.
Oh, enough of the mush, okay?
That's what Buzz said.
Enough of the mush.
I'll have 14 pancakes.
I have 16 orders of bacon and some sausage on the side.
And a small diet drink.
What a guy.
I wonder if he's still alive.
You know, I wonder if he's interesting to...
I mean, not that it's important.
I wouldn't spend a lot of time online trying to find Buzz mush in, you know?
Or like some of the other people from my checkered past doing stupid jobs like that.
But it would just be interesting to know, you know?
Oh, no, he's dead.
And I would go like, oh, right.
What a surprise.
Something maybe feel the spirit of Christ can come.
To step on church.
A bunch of men of a white neighbor.
A riot.
Just like the ones I used to know.
Where the ones were trimmed and cars had rimmed.
It seemed so very long ago.
I'm dreaming of a white neighbor.
With every force inside I'll ride.
May your days be merry and bright.
And may all your new neighbors be white.
By the way, what's the guy's name?
The new times Bob Norman that wrote that crap yesterday about...
Suffolored a self-appointed censor in the Joe Rose thing.
And all that crap about red bone and all that.
Hand bone.
Seat bone.
Connected to the seat bone and whatever.
Bob Norman, you were an idiot, okay?
Well, I've never agreed with Thompson before.
But, yeah.
In other words, glorifying him and pretend that he actually may have a legitimate point here.
As opposed to being the perpetual Ojon Prabhakator.
I've cut the crap, Bob Norman, whoever you are.
Good thing nobody reads that crap anyway.
All those handouts, publications, you know.
Nobody reads them anyhow.
1339 votes on the poll.
What are I saying to Chris?
We could have had a really shy...
We could have had a shot.
We could have had greatness today, man.
Although I think we didn't achieve greatness.
What do you call it?
A watershed day in the history of my life today?
That's what I called it, even though I don't know what that means.
I don't need it, but I'll take it.
Say watershed day in my existence.
All the way around on the show.
Online, offline, inline.
I'm going to go to the store and stand, online.
Now, is that only something I think only Jews do that.
They stand online, New York Jews.
Everybody else stands inline.
But New York Jews stand online.
I was online for half an hour.
I've heard that before.
Well, maybe they were Jews.
I don't know.
I didn't check ID.
They were Jewish.
I didn't Jewish stand online for half an hour.
It depends on what's in the line.
I have no patience.
I have to learn.
I have to be taught.
Otherwise, if I don't learn to get some patience, I'm going to get a spike.
I'm going to learn.
Learn.
Get their pants pulled down and they are spanked with murals.
Welcome.
Oh, WQA and hello.
They are going to have to do it.
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. Colour.
What do you got?
Something that deserves to be on the list.
It's truly online or kind of friends when they come in at Sforbate Season.
I take them to it.
It's truly the slice of 1950's Miami is the Venetian Pool, a rural game.
The what?
The Venetian Pool and rural game.
It is a natural rock-poori pool that they decorate it up in 1950.
It's a 40-50's stuff.
It must be for anybody who's never seen it.
I'll try to make it worse for it.
Okay, I'll tell you.
Don't put it on there.
What about this kayak?
Huh?
What about it?
It shouldn't be on the list.
There's nothing wrong with the sky.
Well, I've never been there.
It's a big fancy house on the water there.
It's old.
It's got some antiques inside.
And that's it?
Well, I mean, there are some people that really enjoy that kind of thing.
You know, never been down in the ground.
There are four votes on our award-winning pool today on a great Tuesday, March 20th.
A banner day in the history of the New York Roger Show and my life in Georgia's life and Chris.
And everybody else out there too.
And all the shifts at sea.
I have no idea why, but I'm just made that up.
1344, if someone from out of town visits out Florida,
make sure they don't miss blank.
That's the pool.
They don't miss blank.
And believe me, if they come to South Florida, they're going to get plenty of f***ing blank.
It almost isn't up to inspire me to play.
Gina's blank.
As in, Gina's dead.
Right, right.
Gina's dead.
But not enough.
And no, I'm not turning on the game show channel.
Sorry.
Okay, the legendary New York Roger Show is leading the way.
How do you like that?
Boy, is that a nice pad on my back?
I've had so many pads to them.
I'm ready to pass out on the floor.
I like a pad on the shoulder and a pad on the back.
But not quite so hard, you know what I'm saying?
Don't push me off the chair, guys.
Legendary New York Roger Show, 353.
Don't miss it.
Especially now that we're actually having a real...
You know, this is what it's going to be, baby.
Right now, I'm coming to that right now.
And I don't care how many times George gives me.
Oh, you need to go back to reading a whole bunch of bedtime.
I'll read a couple here and there.
I'll slip one in, you know, when you least expect it.
But I'm banged.
Here you go, like that.
I'll slip one of those in your shoe.
I would advise them not to come to South Florida.
339, including me.
That would be my best advice.
Don't do it, please.
Like that story that William Holden was telling at the beginning of the
network when they're getting drunk at the bar, him and Howard Beale.
And he says, hey, can't be taken into the foot of the George Washington Bridge.
Remember, he was doing a remote.
And the cab driver says, don't do it, pal.
You got your whole life idea, pal.
South Beach 269.
Don't miss your outbound flight, 111.
Whatever you do, that's in fact, jump on the wing.
You know, that expression of wing in a prayer.
I would jump on the wing if that's what it took to get out of there.
Can you believe how stupid I was when I left my winter coat?
I told you that story last time I came back up here.
I was so depressed standing there in the checkout line.
You know, and I'm thinking to myself, all the times that I flown back and forth
from here down there and back.
And generally, you're taking consideration.
It's 7580 degrees down there.
And it's like a zero up here, you know, or like maybe a 25.
Or maybe if you're lucky.
And I'm standing there.
I felt I just wanted to sit down on the floor and put my head in my hands and cry.
Have you ever had that feeling? Well, probably you every day.
Oh.
The routebound flight 111.
I hate this pool 65.
I mean, it's 75 or 4.8%. That's pretty good. They like it.
And we didn't even ask it to begin in the show today.
You like it?
But we should do that from now on.
Not that I'll pay any attention. There's whatever we want to do.
Sog rest mills mall. Don't miss it, man.
40 votes for the Sog rest mills mall. It's an attraction.
Why, Neil? I haven't got any idea.
You could throw a rock from my house to the Sog rest mills mall.
In fact, if you're smart, you would.
Little Havana 36. Don't miss that.
That'll make you get on Zip Lane.
Early bird dinner is got.
About 30, man.
The Jungle Queen dinner cruise 28.
Now, let me ask you something about the early bird.
Are as many places offered it as they used to know that all the old Jews are dead?
You're asking us.
Well, I mean, just general opinion. I mean, you get around town a little bit.
As far as I know.
You know, the thing about old people, they keep making more.
That's right. Don't tell me.
The Jungle Queen dinner cruise 28.
Now, you guys out there. Don't ever get old.
That's my best advice. Believe me. Take my advice.
My Kai 22, Cemetery Village 21.
How does the My Kai even qualify as a tourist attraction?
I know they got the, you know, the Polynesians show and all the glitzy.
Right, they got the garden there and...
Yeah, that. I hear garden My Ass.
The Jungle get a rake. Maybe a hoe.
Maybe I can be like Moa. I can get raked in it.
My Kai 22, Cemetery Village 21.
The Metro Zoo where you'll find the Amchus Juan McGill.
Well, you know, I never played that open.
I don't know why. Probably because the Chris would have never sprained down.
The one in two hours, the one we run McGill.
This is round McGill from Amchus, and I listen to that.
You know, Rodgers, one in two hours.
Hell, let's eat better than sex with the animals.
When I was with all the sound effects here,
I'd never be a thunk about it before. Who'da thunk it?
Um, Metro Zoo 19, Monkey Jungle 12, speaking of that.
And a parrot jungle only for so-called Quattro.
So, Tonto Quattro.
How come it can be Quattro and Uno?
How come the Italians and the Spaniards could give...
Yeah, how come they could agree on two numbers there?
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
I don't know. Huh?
Oh, what's the guy who did with Joseph Gacchi?
I had the wrong button. I was trying to say...
How come Uno and Quattro?
Cinco and Cinque? Huh?
Trace and Tray?
Yeah.
Duo, uh, those and, uh, do we?
Nive and Nive.
Oh, then.
Oh, to Metro Zoo?
Mm-hmm.
Sea and...
No.
Twenty before two, you see this?
Twenty till two or QA.
Hey, hold on.
I feel in coherence today. I don't know what it is.
This hasn't been a show today.
This whole thing has been like an experience.
Did it really happen?
No, I mean by that?
No.
I don't think I do either. That's your gonna wake up and you're gonna have to show all the...
Third, yeah. I'm gonna wake up and realize it's like seven in the morning.
I gotta get up now and get ready to do all this.
And do this and do that. And it's only Tuesday.
The good news is Thursday, another mile I gave it 12.50. Oh yeah.
Ow!
It's been good for my internship at the...
You're ratings are dying now.
Well, I don't wanna show you what a fake ass said I was to your hand-house.
Rectums?
Yes, does your good fight somebody good enough to film my begging pants?
Are you mean easy?
Huh?
Very no chance I'll let it be coming back.
I'm excited considering a lucrative act.
If you wanna know what it'll say if I'm shutting that transmitter to the lounge...
Why?
That's easy.
Sure.
Oh, you need a smile.
I think I'm gonna wake up.
Oh, you need a smile.
I'm gonna wake up.
Oh, you need a smile.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I think your old dreams last only got to the day.
I think that my ratings have bottomed out in the night.
And I think I'll have to re-loathe these two of them today and civil wars.
And we did...
That's what you need to know.
Now we're drinking.
Oh, you need a smile.
I don't know.
Oh, you need a smile.
Oh, you need a smile.
Oh, you need a smile.
You fight away something.
You can't hold me to give me this.
You see?
What the hell?
Are you gonna go fight me?
On the moon?
Nerds get their pants pulled down a mare.
Spank with Murat.
Okay, 14 go through.
I can't wait for that 1360 people.
It's man, Chris, you really missed a golden opportunity.
I apologize.
We could have another day just like last Monday.
Remember last Monday when we had 1500 and some odd votes and I do underline the odd part on a show.
And we were going nuts.
I was going nuts.
I think that was the beginning of the day.
Turn around, so to speak.
Turn around.
Back your pants.
Back down.
And go to the moon.
Or just moon the audience.
Boy, this, this, uh, whoever is sending us all these stories,
I don't know.
Working overtime.
And that's good.
I like these stories.
Driver's sex charge is added.
In diamond brought back against priest as well.
Covington, Kentucky.
Oh, that's a place you don't want to be.
Or is this, and I'm sure it must be.
This says Cincinnati.com.
But isn't Covington and Kentucky?
Yes, it is.
I don't know.
It is.
You never know.
Yes, it is.
Remember, yes, it is by the Beatles.
That was the flip side of something really good.
Was that the flip side of yesterday?
Yes, it is.
You don't have that by the Beatles?
By the Beatles?
Yes, it is.
Well, let's hear it.
That's a great song.
And why this thing isn't working.
Yeah, kick it.
Smack it a little bit, okay?
Spank it with moon rocks.
That'd be nice.
A former school bus driver was invited in Kenton County, Kentucky, on charges of sexually
exploding a child today.
Andrew Greyboe, or is that grab on?
Forty of Florence was invited on two counts of first-degree astronomy.
And one of the first-degree rape that had issued to another felony.
All the charges grab penalty of 20 years to life in prison.
Kenton Commonwealth Attorney, Rob Sanders, and Greyboe sexually has flooded a preteen
from June 2004 through April 2005 when he lived in Cometon.
Investigators said they found movies of the sex-floor exploitation and Greyboe's computer
clinical records.
The records stated that movies were among a large amount of pornographic material confiscated.
Greyboe remains in the Boone County jail where he faces sexually, a charges of sexually
has flooded another child.
What if it's the old Boone in the box in the Boone County jail, do you think?
Don't tell me there's more of this.
Oh, no, it's something else, okay.
It says that he was arrested January 25 on eight counts of use of a minor in a sexual
performance.
Boone County Sheriff Deputy said he was having sexual relations with a 16-year-old student
who wrote his Boone County school bus and evidently was riding more than that.
Circuit Judge Patricia Sumi will arrange grew a group on the County charges April 2nd in Cometon.
In a separate case today, the grand jury brought back an indictment against the Reverend Thomas
A. M. Gakey, who has been on medical leave since 2000 from the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.
Oh, no.
When does it ever stop?
Will it ever stop, huh?
Father, you have to know all the boys.
No chance.
Gakey was indicted on a charge of first-degree possession of a controlled substance upon a felony
possible about to five years in prison.
Investigators said they found 0.02 grams of crack cocaine and geeky's car as well as a
straw.
Maybe he was just rick and a soda pop.
Spoons and crack pipes and leather bag between the front seats as well as black and white
photographs of well-endowed men.
Oh, wow.
Put all those things together.
What do you guys?
All of these things.
He was also indicted on one kind of possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor.
Pictures of well-endowed men.
Black and white photos, though, not full color.
Gakey was arrested January 8th by members of the Northern Kentucky Drug Strike Force
outside the Hampton Inn in Covington.
He told police you now lives in Tampa.
All right.
He had previously served as pastor of two churches in Dayton, Ohio.
Narcotics agents responding to a tip watch as Gakey left his hotel room with two other men.
Oh, what were they doing in that room, huh?
A father.
When the three got into his car, the agents approached and asked him to get out.
Gakey remains free on bond.
He'll be arrained in Kent and Circuit Court today.
Before Judge Stephen Yeager or is that Yeager as in Yarmory, Yager?
I don't think so.
Let's have some hockey talk.
What do you say?
Let's get rumor on the phone.
Do a hockey show.
No.
And that's another good thing.
Not only don't we see fat boy anymore.
That's another reason I'm in such a good mood today.
You know who else I never hear from anymore?
Rimmer?
Ever, ever here.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
In other words, if it's free, it's me.
All right.
Well, that's really good news.
13th and 167 votes.
You see, we really, I mean, we're going to be on the edge of 14 as it is.
Now, without the big push, I mean, we're certainly not going to get 33 votes in nine minutes.
But we're going to be right on the precipice, man.
Right on the edge of such phenomenal greatness.
This isn't just legendary.
This is almost unspeakable, you know what?
It's almost like a religious experience that you arrived at your show.
That's what they say.
They're good.
And they do.
That's KNEEL, do you?
They kneel.
That's why leading on the pool out of 1367 votes.
If someone from out of town visits out for them, make sure they don't miss the legendary Near Rogers show.
355.
Over a quarter of the respondents are like tinkling all over my leg.
Excuse me while I go get a towel, please.
Just like that duck.
Too bad we can't play that anymore.
Just stop and think about all the great things you've done.
I do sometimes I do.
And I show it to be five.
Even more than I out normally to.
Yeah.
Anyway, here's the fact that it says having played tour guide for many of his interviewer sky is a must see for those who want to.
Did we put this guy on there?
Why not?
Some cultural history.
Sure.
The gardens are as beautiful as the house.
The gardens are very beautiful.
Apedition pool is also very historical and cool to see, but probably around five on a top ten list.
The sky it says it would put number two.
The new parachungal is a sham attourist trap.
Whereas the old parachungal was pretty cool since, says, whoever this is.
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you so very much.
The new parachungal is, you know, for the birds.
I still would like to see a macaul once again before I die.
Now, when you go into the trap of Canada, the point I was trying to make before, is that when you go across, you know how they have those walkways like from the MGM grand.
And you go right across and you're like in the trap of Canada.
And you walk through the lobby in there and you've got all those parrots.
Right.
They just hang out on those, what do you call those things?
Parrots?
No, no, but they hang out on those wooden things.
They just branch with perch?
Yeah, they're on a perch.
That's it, perch.
And those of us go fishing in, and like the French say, perch on this is Jompazze.
That's what the French say.
