What is that?
I give up.
You hear that?
I heard it.
I thought it was you.
What was that?
What was it me?
It was me, the next thing auto-starter after the open.
Oh, nice!
My friend said, what is that?
If you listen to the new IOD
No.
The show's a daytime, all better
You've never known it by the way
That they are promoting
The first portion of you
No, it's always
Hangover, it's only version
Josie, that can say
I don't know by now
No, it's not
No one gives a crap about any of that
It's a talent that brings
And all money
And if that's all
There's got to be a doubt
The talent is losing out
And buddy, if they screw it up
And I
Ah!
Tune in out to the show
He went rick and souter
What they listen and fall
They made him never be in debt
Oh, they all you'll ever see
I'm not drinking on the billboard
It's a cost for the sports or the weather
It's always hangover and sunny version
Josie, that can't be
They all know by now
No one ever listens
Without other graphs
It's a talent that keeps the plays running
And if that's all
There's got to be a doubt
The talent is losing out
And buddy, if they screw it up
And I
Tune in out to the show
Tune in out to the show
Went in doubt, Tune it out
Go to that
Boy, this is the best fried pig I've ever had in my life
He's taken this one from me
And I've discovered that's a long day of cooking in a microwave
The longer you're naked
Yeah, the crisp root is
Oh yeah
Mmm, it's amazing
You can feel those tumors just building in my...
Back down
Even the balls of my body, you know
Isn't bacon supposed to be because it's got all these nitrites and nitrates?
Isn't bad for you?
That's what they say
Mmm
And you know what? Ask me if I care
No
At this stage of my life, after all the crap I beat in my life, who cares?
Right?
Right
Very bad formula to start out on a money-money-moaning food
Yeah, that's bad radio
It is very bad radio
And of course, that's like all I've talked about the Myspace, although I will say
We're number one, damn it
Yeah
That December monthly, man
It is scary
I don't think we're gonna get a thousand votes today Chris, what are we gonna do about that?
Oh, we'll do it
And that's because everybody was watching the quotes and beat the Patriots last night
Well, there you go, Nioh, you're Patriots lost, you're void in duty
You know something?
How did the dolphins do in the playoffs this year?
Were there brand new spanking coach, were there 18 coach in last to four seasons?
How they do?
He's like losing any games like we said, didn't lose any playoff games
How they have a game?
How they blew that lead, I have no idea, but you know what?
Takes the pressure off, Chris is very happy, hates the Patriots
You know it, I see
There's some other friends I have out there who also hate Tom Brady
If the media doesn't want to like shower him with affection for the next year, I'll fill in, how's that?
That's not exactly what the word that was used, but it was like that, you know?
I'll fill in, I thought I'll go for it
So they lost, whoopie do, you know, and life goes on
It won't change my life in least bit
So I feel out of sync here, because I usually eat to bake in around 845
I'm going to have to set a little reminder or something
Ha ha ha ha, raw
Time to eat
You know what that would be?
Set a reminder, I mean it would be very nice
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking
Anyway, okay, let's get the show going here, I got all these numbers

I mean I don't want to poo poo and we hope that everybody on the station does great because it means more money for us
Yeah, what do you think the chances of ever getting that secondary bonus for the whole wall station?

Any interest in those panthers? No, I'm gonna tell you the games last week
Between Caroline and then the least game on Thursday. There weren't enough people in there you could have
It was embarrassing you could have shoved him into a telephone booth
That's how Florida for you man in the fact that we actually do well speaking English. It's a major. That's other bonus for us
Oh, yeah, no pick it up on here and we're I hear Castro's dad by the way and we're still kicking ass
I'm still waiting for that telegram what a job guys and for Joe to come in there and give you a big kiss on the lips that obviously I'll pass

Actually, make a phone call and wipe your butt with it. It's just amazing to me. Isn't it? Yes, it is

I have called 515. I have no material 376. Well, I shouldn't stop you. It doesn't stop most of the colors
I'm a listener not a caller. I'll listen to a stranger and a listener 344

Facts machine all idea from Sean or somebody else to be pleased to know that I went to woodbind Saturday and Sunday and broke even
I won I'm Saturday and give it all back but I played with their money yesterday with no pressure
I was knowing I had the bonus money meant no

I'm not that bad. I probably before you show you
Smart ass
Anyway, maybe somebody can answer for us. This is a very interesting question. Okay, and I have my doubts that anybody knows
Although when it comes to technical crap, you know, I'm good at that. Pots getting around with it
But I'm not so good at the understanding it
Now when you're doing the my space thing and you're writing somebody a message and you write the word online in the message
It doesn't print out the word online if you write it the whole I and e and smaller if you print caps
Well, I could hyphenated it'll show up
But if you just print oh well and oh and L I and e and smaller it doesn't show up
It just does that dot and that's it
Like
Yeah, like that that that that yeah, so maybe somebody knows the answer for that then this seemed a little strange and you didn't
Know I had you a permanent you sent me a message and it's just that that that that that that that that that that that like that
It wouldn't print out

His new girlfriend is Leo de Caprio's old girlfriend, so he doesn't have he's been spent a lot of time with her and he doesn't have the
Focus in the juice. Yeah, I'm sure it was yeah

Yeah, I'm gonna be a little bit of a scholar. Yeah, all right go ahead and I really don't care bears and the quotes to me
Oh my god Chris is all excited about it. That's only because the Patriots are not in it. That's why he likes it
Yeah, maybe I think it's that dolphin
You know jealousy is what it sounds like to me dolphin jealousy is what it's all about
We're so tired those patriots they already won three super balls and that about about all that other crap
How did dolphins do in their super bowl attempt since 19 and what was it was the last time they were in there?
No, that's last time they won 184. Oh, I made it 8.45 one of those long time ago Danny boy was still around wasn't it?

712 votes on a pool. I think we got a shot if we can get to like seven. Oh, yeah
We'll make it we'll make our thousand you'll see we're gonna push on it
We got to get a lot of votes on that pool because the audience has been screwing off
They were watching the games yesterday and then they all went out and got drunk and got laid and stuff like that
Disgusting things that the Lord will frown upon and you're gonna burn in hell make no mistake about it
Am I right? Right the Lord works in mysterious ways. Here's some good news for a change
Well, not great news, but key legislators reached a final compromise last night
And how to solve Florida's property insurance woes and the whole last incentive will vote on the plan today the last day of a week-long
Emergency session
Republican governor Charlie gay Christ
They said again Charlie gay gave a tentative stamp of approval to the bipartisan deal reached after four days of intense talks between House and Senate negotiators
Legislative leaders promised the plan will deliver rate relief to homeowners statewide have been sucked and I mean soft
They've been stuck baby with soaring insurance premiums after two devastating hurricane seasons in 2005
rate cut estimates for customers of private insurance companies range from seven to
35% on the windstorm coverage in their policies
Customers of citizens property insurance corp the state back insurer for homeowners who can't get private insurance could see up to a
20% reduction in their premiums. All right
There's gonna be a rate relief around the states that represent him Adam had has no
Republican Delray Beach talk much. What's the bacon?
Never eat just like right before you go on here. Just when I'm on radio. That's a bad radio man
That's the near Roger show its bad radio bad
Far too long these scales have been tipped over the insurance industry and I think our action is certainly put that in balance as
Adam but others only caution that time will tell if the rate relief materializes as hope and whether homeowners are satisfied
We sure hope that you're all getting satisfied
This will be a success or a failure on a family by family basis that house democratically to Dan Gilbert of Miami Beach
But we've stopped the hemorrhaging and there won't be an obscene rate increase this year. That's a given
Legislators also caution that insurance breaks will not come immediately
It's likely to be months before anyone sees any rates drop. I know everybody wants it now
But if they know the cavalry's been just as facts. They just have to hold a fort a little while longer
Yeah, that's right. That's what Steve Geller Helen there be said. They all want it now, but they'll have to wait
That's a way life works believe you me. You may want it real bad, but you can have to wait

I think we're gonna make our thousand of dance but at the very precipitously slow start
I think so
Three criminal prosecutions that know how his biggest county of open wood strong indications that the cover-up of the theft of the 2004 presidential election is starting to unravel
Oh my god!
Prosecutors say these cases involve rigging the recount and chi-hoag accounting that's Cleveland
where tens of thousands of votes were shifted from John Curie to George W. Bush or else not counted at all
Meanwhile, corroborating evidence continues to surface throughout Ohio, illuminating the GOP's theft of the presidency
By the way, this is by Harvey Washington and he and Bob Fortrackis were writing a book about the theft of the 2010 election
And only 80 million articles are read by them, you remember?
Yes, I mean yes, no
And also by the way, there are people out there trying my buddies have tried to write online online and they can't write online
By the way, that message that I tried to write it on still hasn't shown up in my sent folder
Wow!
Oh, they look very hate-coward
Issues!
Wow!
According to the AP, county prosecutor Kevin Baxter opened the chi-hoag a trial by charging that the evidence will show that this recount was rigged maybe not for political reasons but rigged on the less
Baxter said the three election workers did this so they could spend a day rather than weeks or months on the recount
Jack Willen made in the county election board third ranking employee faces six counts of misconduct involving ballot review, Rosie Greer
Not the one you're thinking of, Rosie Greer the board's ballot department manager and Kathleen Dreamer on a system manager also are charged
Is Kathleen a Dreamer?
All three are paid on paid administrative leave and are being supported by the county board of elections
The county prosecutors do not pledge vote for it nor do they say they stand in the recount effect of the election's outcome
But here's the big butt, that's the one
Cleveland, which usually gives Democrats an extremely heavy margin, was crucial to Bush's alleged victory of roughly 118,000 votes out of 5.5 million counted
Some 600,000 votes were cast or counted in Cairoga County but official turnout in vote counts varied wildly and improperly from precinct to precinct
I'll speak in a while, there she is
How we can achieve that, though!
Oh my god, everybody's running for president, man
Several predominantly black precincts where voters went more than 80% for Carrie, we're put it turned out to 30%
About 30, man!
Or less, and one ward, only a 7% turnout was reported while surrounding precincts were nearly 10 times as high
Independent studies indicate Carrie got cost thousands of votes in Cairoga County, the rightfully should have been counted in this column
In the Cairoga case, the poll workers of charge with circumventing state recount laws that require a random sampling of at least 3%
3% of the votes cast to give in precinct to be recounted by hand and machine by a good machine, man!
They prosecute some charges that the workers instead hand picked sample precincts to recount that they did not have questionable results
Are you following that? I'm not
What? Once they were able to match those recounts with official results, they could do the rest of the recount by machine
In effect, right away in the entire process, meaningless, this was a very high-shot operation that said prosecutor Baxter
Baxter
Similar allegations have been made in other counties indeed, such illegal non-random recounting procedures appear to have been common throughout the state
Carrie not by board of election employees with a passive consent of Secretary of State, the right-wing Senator Jake-Heneth Blackwell
And it goes on, but it'll be pretty good, but about
And of course nobody cares, the mainstream media, the MSM, they care about it, are they be calling up?
Are they going to fly in that? No, they don't, fly in fig? Absolutely not
It's interesting you're lying in my space and on the rest of the internet, you can type any word you want in the world in no problem
Well, there's some places that have, you know, but on line
Language filters, language filters, no, I've never encountered that before
That's what I'm saying, you can text the F word, the SH, whatever you want, and it'll print that no problem at all
Believe me, I do it all the time because I'm an old pervert potty mouth
And everybody I know on there is the same, but you're perverts, it's why I like them
But on line, I mean, is there something you're subversive about that? Huh?
Oh, must be
I don't get it, and it's just always does the same, dot, dot, dot, like it's in the Morse code or something
Well, we're going to make our thousand today, it's a very tough assignment, but this audience is coming through for us
And thanks again to the loyal audience, man, for making us, because I heard a rumor over the weekend
I was a woodbine and somebody said
We're number one, David!
I said, yeah, I think you could be right

then thank heaven for 7.11 or whatever that goes, the bread is on 11,
and we'll make our thousand.
And then what?
We go home?
Then we go home.
A suspicious package was found today at my international, but it was harmless.
The authority said it was an accident if nobody got hurt.
The item in somebody's luggage was not a threat.
Airports spokesman Mark Henderson said it was not yet clear what the object was.
The item was discovered near an X-ray machine in terminal A shortly before 6 this morning.
Officer Thomas Froggy said,
Froggy, plunk your magic twanger, Froggy.
Can you remember what they actually said on the Buster Brown show?
Andy Devine, who weighed about 800 pounds,
he looked like the beast and hank sewed together.
I'll take your work for it.
Andy Devine, the Buster Brown show, plunk your magic twanger, Froggy.
I don't think they could say that until TV now.
Nope.
You can't be plunking your magic twanger.
The immediate area was cleared by the authorities and not expect flights to be delayed.
This is just standard procedure, Froggy said.
I wonder what's going to happen if Froggy?
Crocs?
When we have a suspicious package, we clear around the area and we call the bomb squad to check it out.
Oh yeah, we were of that suspicious package.
That's what I always say.
And I'm telling you, I've got so much stuff here that it's just unbelievable today.
You want to know why?
Why?
Well, because I'm highly motivated.
You want to know why I'm highly motivated?
I don't want to know why.
Air number one, dammit!
What are you going to say?
That?
Oh, that's part of it.
No question about that.
American seems sour on the state of the Union and the president of Bush's address on the subject.
The poll finds most believed the country is on the wrong track a complete flip flop from five years ago.
A complete turnaround.
Turn around as in...
Correct them.
That song, turn around, look at me.
Bye.
Turn around as someone...turn around.
I don't know.
No, wait before you were born.
Turn around.
Can you find it?
You got it?
Now, how have you got your stuff alphabetized by artists, by artist, by artist, by a name of the song or why?
Any of these music organizer, machines, alphabetized, and into any way that you want to be.
Is that it?
So you just type a name in the shirt, and if it's got that word in the title or in the artist's title, whatever it comes up.
And put it in something like that.
Yes.
Is that the four lands?
What is it?
The Bobs.
Or the Bobs?
Wow, turn around and look at me.
Well, that wasn't the original one.
The Bobs.
Well, you're kidding.
Oh, I would say 66, 67, 68.
68.
Well, I would say I was getting closer.
I was getting there.
You chucked me off your credit set.
Most people also are not competent.
That Bush and the Democrats were not in control of Congress and share responsibility with him for running the country.
We can work together to solve his problems and associate a press AOL poll now finds.
After the same time, Americans see the President is likeable to size and strong, but also stubborn.
And only a minority think he's honest.
44% down from 53% two years ago.
You know what is approval rating is now?
The new poll, do you see that?
31%.
31%.
But third, man.
Which means 69%.
Say, uh-uh.
No thanks, Georgie.
How do you like them?
Or rotten apples, huh?
All this bloodshed murder in the Democrats.
You're going to have to be better.
See, Democrats are all too busy running for president.
They're all running.
Everybody.
And then swallery comes out yesterday.
First it was Barack and then swallery and Joe Biden.
He's running.
And then of course, uh, that brown back.
That's a crazy person from Kansas on the other side.
On the Nazi side.
So I'm saying brown back, who never met a gay person that he didn't want to fry in an oven.
Or a Jew or anybody else, he don't like or probably darkies too.
Are you dark folks, man?
Uh, I'd run for the hills.
Where the hell did that expression come from?
Run for the hills?
Uh, probably because that was a safe place.
I don't know.
So many stupid expressions in so little time, you know what?
What about even Stephen?
Where the hell did that come from?
I don't know.
It rhymes.
Is that what it is?
Silly.
There's so many stupid expressions.
So the ones that have the same kind of sound to it.
Even Schmendrick?
How's that?
796.
Oh, we got the 800.
Look, now they're heavy duty.
They're coming in big, big chunks.
Must be that microwave bacon.
It was good.
Bagged hand hoe.
And colder discovers.
It really is just like L.A.
Do I have time for this before the, uh, yeah, I do.
It's not that long.
It takes up several pages, but there aren't too many words on each page.
RJ Escoe and his smirklingchimp.com writes.
Critics have called hand colders comparison of bagged-out L.A.
Ridiculous, but they haven't heard her searing Iraqi gangland journal.
They haven't read it excerpted for the first time anywhere.
There are those who suggest that her Haiti is a conservative commentator has now passed,
and that this public television performance proves it.
But wait till you see this, you'll never be the same.
So read, you skip this, read, and learn.
Anzirag journal notes from a gang war.
Bagged dead, hot and muggy night, but then aren't they all?
My military escort was Sergeant Henderson, and we are here to prove that this town was just like Los Angeles.
Well, that's why I was here.
The sergeant was already here, in fact, he'd been here quite a while.
We died at sevenish at a vegan halal eatery.
Halal, that's like kosher to the Arigids.
There was popular with all the trendy downtown types.
We had to call the Minister of Communication to get a sin.
It's just like L.A. after all, it's who you know, not what you know.
The puree of mutton with reduction to saffron was delish.
The puree of mutton with saffron.
Oh, man, but something in my fruit smoothie dessert made my lips puffed.
Wouldn't be the first time, man.
I looked like one of those aging actresses still trying to make it in bagged-ed the city of dreams.
Poor things you see in Strolley Up 14th of July street are hanging in the lobby of the Al-Rachid hotel.
Lips full of collagen and faces paralyzed by Botox, still hoping for that big breakout role in the G-Hob recruitment video, really sad.
We came upon a likely group of young men wearing blue bandanas.
If that wasn't enough proof they were crypts the signs they were throwing confirmed it.
We paved them over.
Boy, as I said, can you fellas tell me anything about gang war?
They laughed to each other and conferred hastily.
I couldn't understand much of what they said, although I distinctly heard the phrase,
bitch better have my money.
I turned to Sergeant Henderson, well I said I'm certainly not going to pay those people.
We're here to help them and they should do it out of gratitude.
He coughed into his sleeve and said nothing.
Let's try the other gang, I said maybe they'll be more helpful.
It wasn't until nice morning that the sergeant realized they tagged his hummer.
We'd heard the music booming from every street corner as we drove into the Saadur city.
Got my mind and my Mathy and my Mathy on my mind.
Oh, I bet you don't have that song in there yet.
No.
Got my mind and my Mathy.
We will go this.
I'm the municipal MAHDI and you spell with a like that.
As in high mionkle.
There's another word I love, high mionkle.
That's like Mashi Pupik and Khai Mshmendrik.
What does it mean?
I have no idea.
It's a guy, high mionkle.
Oh, hi.
We rolled up on the municipal building the easy floor of Mst. Matt Assam on the mic.
Then we heard a voice call out, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
The young man put that a grenade launcher away just over.
The red checkerboard pattern is, coffee, a told us all we needed, no, he was a blood.
Got a bigger word he asked.
Blood replaced the letter C with the letter B at the start of word B as in blood.
C is in crypt, crypt is to the reverse.
Yes, I told him whatever we need your help.
Can you help us to approve this is just a gang war and Baghdad is just like Los Angeles?
He waved my question away impatiently.
I wanted to listen to my music he said.
If you respect my beats, you'll bring my son back to the USA.
Yes?
He began to recite his lyrics.
I'll answer our province on a Saturday night.
My cousins got a berk on low and tight.
Nights getting warm.
I feel kind of freaky.
So don't give your lip about that bitch.
I'm a leaky.
Let's go, Stargis said in my driver.
I think I need a cigarette.
His face was revealing no emotion.
Isn't that big red he replied?
Just gonna say.
Anybody got a big red?
Last stop, the sergeant knows somebody was familiar with this war and with gangs in LA.
It was with a 32nd military police force and a new youth council in the LA ghetto.
Listen lady, he began.
The LA gangs are response to historical forces.
The African American population in that city doubled during WW2 and response to the white population began
enforcing strict segregation in neighborhoods, forcing the African Americans into a close
basis with little outlet for activity.
Black youth began forming clubs for self-defense after some incidents of white on black violence.
And took a breath.
Then in the 1960s, the infusion of organized drug and racqueteria, I cut him off.
I'm not interested in Los Angeles Falls.
I'm interested in how bagged that is no worse than LA.
Can you help me or not?
He looked at me sadly.
Gang was tragic, he said.
But you know, read the papers.
Forty killed by a bomb one day.
Sixty people found torture to death the next day.
Thirty-four thousand civilians killed or racked by violence last year.
Many times that I might have died from an adequate health and other resources.
I turned to Sergeant Henderson.
This guy's a bummer.
I said, why not come up to my hotel room for a little distraction?
He shook his head.
I'm staying here on earth, he said.
I'm hoping you can go home now that the public is not listening to people like you.
Back to the hotel room, alone.
Hey, that's exactly what happened in my last trip to Hollywood when I went there to pitch
my smoke and movie idea.
Hot, lonely, can't get laid to save my life.
I don't care what they say.
This town really is like LA.
This is Manculter.
That's cute.
Isn't that cute?

Oh my god, no punches put on that report, no punches put.
Maybe I'll read the rings again from a Friday for anybody who might have missed them.
Oh, they're entertaining to us.
Huh?
Well, I'll see now we're rubbing it in.
But of course we're used to being number one in fact that's just the way it is.
We're number one, dammit!
You get that bonus money in spite of the fact that these sports shows just suck wind, man.
You can hear those gigantic sucking sounds.
It was unbelievably like a hurricane.
Just rub it?
They were with bad.
No, I said just enjoy it.
816 votes, who poses a greater threat than the human gene pool that's our pool today?
And we're going to make our thousand.
Well, there's a scooter Libby.
What kind of adult calls it?
You know, it has a nickname of scooter, huh?
Adult?
Still risuto?
The scooter.
The scooter?
The scooter lady.
Who?
The scooting lady.
No, she wasn't the scooter.
Now, is it true that she was the guy with the eyes that was his mother?
If she was the same person as the tree lady because that...
Yes, she was.
That was his, yes.
Well, I wonder if she died in early death.
How very sad.
Oh my God.
Who'd have traded her for him?
Who poses a greater threat to the human gene pool?

The average American idol of you were 205.
People who watch poker on TV with one exception, 80.
See, every time I do that, I find out that somebody I know or like watches poker on TV.
And I've been, ah, you know, I don't want to rip them too much.
But it's, I don't know.
I'll have to find out what that's all about.
Do you think I care?
No.
The average American idol contestant 65, MySpace.com members 54 with a few exceptions.
There's some really nice people on there.
There are some nice people.

Very nice.
Very nice.

We got a front footed tie there.
They're even Steven.
I hate this pull 45, 5.5%, and the average knee eruders show caller.
You got to admit, they're not leaked by themselves most of them.
The average caller on the show 43.
This is the Neologic Show.
It's rather dolphin-deaf today.
This is your blind.
I didn't know what...
Oh.
Any questions?
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
It's been over two weeks since he's made a sound.
While his family's acting fickle, he's smelting like a obstacle.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
Right now he's just like a car at the end of the town.
He's already an insane painter, but his corpse is by an eater.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
He's like a single man dead at Boston Town.
While the family gets to close in his body, he's decomposing.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
Absolutely.
The godfather of souls should be having fun.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
It's time to put James Brown's body in the ground.
We're number one, dammit!
Almost 300 dead wounded today is violent surges in Iraq.
This new surge is really working well, isn't it?
The body parts are all over the place.
And I have a difficult time counting how many dead people there are
because they've got to find enough body parts to figure it's like one whole person.
We'll just pick one body part and count that one left feet.
For example, I see.
Wait until you hear this story.
Although there might be a whole bunch of great calls on there, but there aren't.
That's good.
I like starting off Monday real easy, easing into it.
But like I told you before, the show today, some people hate Mondays.
In fact, how about Blue Monday by Fat Stommerer?
You got that?
Okay.
I'm in Imperial records.
Blue Monday, how are they hate?
How big are you, Martin?
Probably have it by a few other people, too.
I don't want to hear about nobody else.
The fat man, Antoine Fat Stommerer, maybe he-to-man.
You don't have it?
For some reason, it ain't coming up.
I can't give it up this morning.
And of course, in my case, like I told you, I enjoy Mondays.
I look forward to it.
Sex Offender applies for school as a boy.
A charter school alerted authorities to a 29-year-old sex offender who tried to enroll there.
Pretending he was just 12.
Now, if you saw the picture on here, it's just-it's just amazing.
And what Sheriff's officials said Friday may have been an attempt to lure children in sex abuse.
The Yavapai County, this is in Phoenix, Yavapai, Phoenix, Sheriff's Office also said,
Neil Havens, Roderick II, con, too many was living with him having sex with him,
and I believe he was a young boy.
One of them, 61-year-old Lonnie Stiffler, called himself Roderick's grandpa when he tried-
Oh, beware of those grandpa's, man.
When he tried to enroll him in Mingus Springs Charter School, his casey price.
He's 29. If you start a picture, you know how old he looks?
30?
No, about 30. I would say-
I'm third, man.
And he's 12.
This is the weirdest case I've seen in 18-years-year-old Sheriff's spokeswoman Susan Quayle said,
if it wasn't so sad, it would be funny, but it's sad. It's pathetic.
A total of four men were in custody in the case Friday.
I'm her age charge, including fraud, forgery, identity theft, and faded register was a sex offender.
Officials at the Charter School in Chino Valley about 90 miles northwest of Phoenix told deputies that papers that the grandfather presented appeared to be fake,
and the boy looked, the so-called boy looked much older than 12.
Yeah, I would say-
About 30, man.
29 sounds realistic.
Stiffler.
Now, let's see, what show I had, or movie had a guy named Stiffler?
Was that the-
American Pirebari.
American Pirebari.
That's Stiffler, yeah.
That's a Canadian guy. What's his name? You mentioned him on Friday.
I don't know.
The actor with the glasses. Come on.
Philip Seymour Hoppen. Doesn't he have three names or something?
No, get out of here. You mentioned him on Friday. Not Philip Seymour Hoppen. The skinny guy with the glasses will play daddy.
Oh, you're doing lovey.
Eugene Levy. Yeah. Oh, what are you eating now?
Grupper fingers.
Grupper fingers.
From how we-
I didn't know Grupper's head fingers.
It was a little-
I'll meet him.
Stiffler and Robert James Snow 43 were very upset when the detectives told them they'd been having a sexual relationship with a 29-year-old man and not a preteen boy quail said.
Well, what does that mean? I don't get it. Go back. I was on this thumb.
Stiffler, they thought that he was a 12-year-old kid and they were having sex with him, but when they found out he was 29, then they were upset about it.
I mean, that's a real pedophile, okay? In other words, well, maybe it was really good and we enjoyed it and had a wonderful time.
He was really great in the sack, but he ate no 12.
Chobby's idea and he was over 18.
Oh, that's a bit-
Dejectives have evidence that Stiffler and Snow enrolled Roderick in other Arizona schools and have notified law enforcement those jurisdictions.
It was unfair whether Roderick had actually attended any schools, but Quail said,
I think what we're looking at is that he's being used to troll for other kids.
He's being used to troll.
How do you like that?
I don't know if he's trolling online or, you know, who knows?
Maybe the wacky one knows about trolling online. What do you think?
Well, that's-
I mentioned on the air that we're open for business on our Myspace page that we got on block.
I mean, what by Saturday morning I didn't email.
I was hoping it was maybe from somebody else, but of course I knew it wouldn't be.
It was from George.
And it said, no, that was very nice of you to tell me that they opened up our, you know, we were on block.
Now, what did the email say?
I was at-
Your account is on block.
Period.
Yeah.
So in other words, they did the big investigation after eight totally, but all of a crazy person,
and insane person decided to toy and fiddle around with our Myspace page because he can't get off of there, you know?
And of course this person was-
And who was the other one?
I forget already.
Who was the one with the naked picture?
Ethan.
Ethan, very good. See what a memory you got.
George is about a memory for naked guys.
Yeah.
She said he'd take this while you're busy.
She said, you know, a group of fingers there, were you pleased?
She said, detectives learned at interviews with the men that Rod Wright convinced Diffle and Snow that he was a boy.
After meeting him two years ago, guess where he met them?
Boys and girls, guess where he met them?
I say-
On the internet.
On the internet.
How do you like that?
The internet.
The phone again.
Twice.
Damn it.
Well, that's because he's singing a little bit.
He beats the beat.
Well, Rod Wright apparently shaved his body here and used makeup to keep up the guys.
Oh, keep up the-
I wonder how you spell that.
G-U-Y-S-N-O-F-G-U-Y-S-E.
Keep up the guys.
That's what they call him, Stiffle, I guess.
Deputies who served a search warrant at a Tino Valley Home Thursday found Stiffle, Snow, Rodric and Brian J. Nellis 34.
Krayal said Nellis was apparently Rod Wright's cellmate in Oklahoma Prison where both served time for sex offenses.
Now what was that thing about?
They were trolling?
Online.
What was that line?
Trolling online?
That's what it said.
Said Vokabryan told me he was trolling online.
There's the unsung hero of the human race, Old Chicken Egg Baby, who looks just like me and at one picture about a hundred years ago.
People are fascinated with that picture.
I am.
I was a monster in a business boy.
I was fat.
Let me tell you my fat story.
185 today, which you know, I'm not sound I'm 5'9", I should really weigh about 160.
170, though I'd be svelved.
You realize I've only got 15 pounds to go?
That's nothing.
That's enough.
That's nothing in the grand scheme of things.
In the grand scheme of my fat, although I can reach down, I gotta put the cure man.
And let me turn sideways and look in the mirror back here.
I mean, look at that picture and it's just a big roadtask man.
I've already traveled since then.
Yeah, but not from the neck.
How you just neck up?
Not from the shoulders, this is just an easy thing.
Oh, geez.
That neck weighs more than your whole body right now.
But the old neck?
Yeah.
The one in that picture there.
Anybody that's got the my space thing, just go on our main page there and just take a look at the Reverend Doctor.
The Reverend Doctor, both of Brian Chicken Egg.
And it's my old picture.
I believe that's from WNWS.
That neck is bigger than most people's torsos.
Is it really?
I was at any rate, when 1973 I'm working at WSPB in Sarasota.
And I weighed 266 pounds.
That's almost 100 pounds more than I weigh now.
266, 15, that's 81 pounds more than I weigh now.
And you know something I'm looking at?
And I'm feeling this big, spare tire I got here on my puppet.
And I'm thinking to myself, if I had 81 pounds more now, not only would I be in a box dead,
but I would be really gruesome like that spashing spas from Haley on our page there.
And all of a sudden I start waking up in the morning and I'm getting these bad headaches and like sweats, you know, on my forehead like a dion over here.
And that was 1973.
That was 33 years ago before so many of you punched out there we've been born.
Even more an idea.
33 freaking years ago.
34 years ago.
What is it 2007?
Where do you got to remind me of these things?
So I go to the doctor and he takes my blood pressure and he says, I'm going to tell you one thing.
If you don't lose a lot of weight real fast, you're going to be dead very soon.
Oh, that's exactly what I said.
Oh, that's what I said.
So when I gave me the medication and I started, I got on the straight narrow path, at least the narrow part.
And I lost 100 pounds in a year.
I did Atkins, I did the Stillman diet.
You know, that was pretty much the water diet.
And then the, what are they used to call the protein sparing fast?
With a hand that liquid protein, you know, and you do a lot of tank water while they need to pee a lot.
All the way to pee.
What?
What's wrong with peeing a lot?
Nothing but those bodies.
The body is 75% water weight, man.
If you can keep peeing all day, it's not too bad.
No, those drinks could they've been good.
Oh, fair.
And another great poll from this business.
I got news for a Sean R. Poll expert out there.
You got some stiff competition here.
I think this must be from Stiffler.
Other than the government who is effing you the hardest right now.
Wow, that is a fantastic, it's got a long list, a beautiful list.
875 votes on the poll.
So anyway, I weighed 266, I get down in a year to 170 pounds.
So that's 4 pounds shy, 96 pounds.
Not bad, huh?
Not bad at all.
And then I started eating.
And I had all these, you know, like normal sized clothes, you know, I had, in fact, we had a tradeout
at some clothing store on Palm Beach.
This was a JNOR in West Palm.
And we had a tradeout with a clothing store.
And of course, that was Bob Bill.
Remember when Bill Tool called when we went on SU Went in Tampa and Bill Tool called in my S boss.
He used to wear those line green Florida pants in the whole deal.
Yeah.
And the boy that he ever scanned that place.
I mean, I shouldn't say scam.
That's a bad choice of words.
He had a lot of tradeouts.
Let's put it that way.
Yeah.
He used it as best he could.
And anyway, so he got me the tradeout for clothes and all these really nifty.
Because when you're slim and you're not a fat cow, you can wear like really good looking clothing.
They don't make good looking clothes for fat people.
You wear like a potato sack.
And I started eating and, you know, and Bill called her in his wife and I would go out for dinners and pasta and this.
And before you know what, the clothes started feeling really tight.
You know, they're not really tight.
And I started to balloon up again.
I think by the time I got to IOD, I was about 240-ish.
Yeah.
So I gained like most of it back.
gained most of it back.
That's insane.
You can't do that.
That's really disgusting.
You know, our good friend Chris here used to be much fatter than he was.
How fat were you?
Well, I called him about 147.
You were what?
35 pounds heavier.
And how much do you weigh now?
About 255.
255?
Yeah.
And you're what?
510.
510s.
You're a little tired of me and weigh 255.
You're a cow, man.
And you used to weigh 290?
Yeah, about that.
Woo!
Now, if you've got to have blood pressure, nope.
Diabetes?
Nope.
You will if you don't cut the crap.
You're going to be diabetic in now.
No pizza, no pasta, no ice cream, no cakes, no candy, no cookies, no nothing, man.
You're going to be very unhappy person.
Oh, fuck me!
Let me get your advice to all my people out there.
All my folks do not get fat.
Although a lot of you, it's a little bit too late.
Because diabetes is one of the most, not a very happy deal, you know?
Well, how do you know that ice cream, Neil?
Well, because it's so hard.
You know, it's in those containers.
I think that makes a difference.
When you're new, it doesn't cut the fat content out?
Yeah, you can pretend it does.
Hey, no crap for me for like, I forget how many days in a row now.
Aren't you proud?
You ought to be a little bit proud.
I am very proud.
185 and still alive?
Very proud.
And 879 votes on the pool.
We got 1,000 licked easy.
And I'm waiting for the big telegram from the visley saying, wonderful work!
Are you old fat, fag?
And George, you, by the way, is the only in the banana republic, baby.
Only in Miami.
Dominoes, the makers of Brooklyn-style pizza, introduce a new dish from the old country.
Dominoes, Amish-style pizza.

With slices so large, thou must fold it.
What brother Jebediah, folding is the devil's work.
Dominoes, Amish-style pizza is a centuries old recipe that's never changed.
What toppings hasdaw?
We're Amish, and thus only allowed to eat planes.
Dominoes, Amish-style pizza.

of course, now, drive on down as this neckelor keeps.
And, step-barn raising, I've raised a powerful hunger.
When shall the pizza be delivered?
Yay, barely, Jebediah.
It will be here in two to four weeks for its free.
Dominoes, Amish-style pizza.
Answer the dominoes. It's dominoes.
It's 1118 at 5.60.
That's one of the things that you really can't deal with, you have it to give up on your diabetic.
And that's pizza.
Oh, for me!
It's all I need to toppings when I get pizza.
I, you know, I eat the toppings before, you know.
Like the papi rune and stuff like that.
You can have the papi rune and all I choose.
But don't eat the crust.
There are a few things more dangerous than crusts, especially if it's like in your underwear, a lot of it.
So here's an interesting fact for one of our chronics.
It says, caught a few minutes of the Sid Rosen-Cranse burger-roostine show on Sunday in time to hear him say, on Sunday.
This Mandarin, this big shot from the Irish show in New York, is working on Sundays.
In time to hear him say that you are now the 300-pound gorilla and getting thinner every day.
Which means he's glued to the show and listen to right now.
How's it going Sid? See you back in the city.
He'll be back there before you know it.
It says, I kid you not though.
He did praise you as one of the all-time greats.
He says, it's his time now.
It's his time now with that incredible 2.0 share.
Boy does he have a lot of humor while?
What a...
...
It's his time now.
The Sid Rosen-Cranse burger-roost show.
I'm 790, the ticket, man.
Nooo.
And by the way, I hate to break the news to everyone that the play was before I met the father that come on one of the ones.
Rocky Collabito.
Did you hear what he said, Rocky Colabito?
No.
Not only have we got a bunch of punks who don't know anything about sports, but we got some really dumb glium there too.
I hate to break the news to you, man.
Let's get the year-long back. That's what we need.
Now let's see what's that schedule like today.
We got any key on, yes we do.
Let's hear it for any cave.
Ooooo!
See, not only did he come back, but now he doesn't have to stay up till like two, three o'clock in the morning before he can go to bed.
He might get out in time and actually hit the strip bars.
Let's see, we got the mad dog at two.
Power our handker to mad dog together.
See, that's another reason we're having like a little bit of problems in the early afternoon is that we never have the main people on.
They never on.
There are people who just don't go to work at all.
You know what I'm saying?
I know what I wish.
I was one of them.
Now what do you say that?
Don't you love being here with me?
They come on in minute.
I love doing the show.
How's that?
The rest of it, I would agree with you.
I second that emotion.
We love doing the show, we love the audience, some more than others by the way.
But it's just one of those things.
Don't like being here in this building, in this city, in this state.
And in that building with some of those people.
1130 on the Myspace.
1130, man.
I should have mentioned it though because quite a one of my broadcasting expert mavens in plantation.
And then if I talk too much about the Myspace, we're going to be done in a couple of months.
We're going to be all done.
You know, it's amazing when people get together and they talk behind your back, George.
I know.
Never say this to me.
Oh, well we're good friends now because we're both like front two four two.
Oh, in other words, my close personal friend Dave and you are like an online.
See what the hell that Myspace brings people together.
We're coming up.
I don't know why you hold a grudge so badly just because it's the way I am.
I don't believe it's forgiveness.
I believe in justice.
Oh, see I made you a couple of friends on there already.
So you ought to be real happy about it.
Especially somebody in your state of mind.
898 votes were on the precipice of 900.
You ever been running the precipice?
Just this morning.
Yeah, I feel like it right now.
Who poses a greater threat to the human gene pool?
Neo-con's 290.
Oh, Wolfowitz and Bill Crystal and Schmendrick Lewis.
Who's the other one?
Richard Poole, like probably a.
The average American Idol Viewer 225 and those two are like way above everybody else.
People who watch Polka on TV 90.
Most, not all, most, almost all.
The average American Idol Contest in 70.
MySpace.com members 65.
Now come on now we got some really nice people on there.
We really do.
It's amazing how many people, especially the ones that are kissing my ass like you wouldn't believe.
Been listing since I was like 10 years old.
I'm 110 now and stuff like that and they're very nice.
The average American Idol Contest in 70.
Oh, I already did that one.
The average Q and a sports show caller 59.
I hate this poll 52 5.7% and the average near Roger Show Caller 47.
Pose a real great threat to the human gene pool.
The one good thing is that most of those people will not be reproducing soon after we're about it too much.
If you catch my good.
Very good.
WQAM, hello.
Buh.
Disappeared real fast.
WQAM, hello.
Hi.
Uh huh.
Another one.
And let's try the other one online.
What's going to be?
Look at that.
They all got the phone jammed up each other.
How do you like that?
And the cord's a little bit too tight.
A drug-resistant bacteria that's infecting wounded US soldiers in Iraq and as spread
to civilian hospitals in parts of Europe accidentally evolved in US military hospitals in Iraq.
Wired magazine reports in a massive expose story today according to Raj Story.
A massive expose.
Wait till we get to the name of this bacteria.
Should I even try reading it?
Oh.
The several thousand word expose is going to bring uncomfortable new light to the bacteria.
As citadel backter, as citadel backter, I got that one right.
As citadel backter, bomb an eye.
What word did you say?
That Pentagon officials previously said was likely a product of Iraqi soil.
What a mess to portray me of they're making over their man.
By creating the most heroic and efficient means of saving lives in history of warfare,
the Pentagon has accidentally invented a machine and it's a bad machine,
for accelerating bacterial evolution and was airlifting the pathogens halfway around the world.
The magazine says, I've got to look into that whole thing.
What magazine is it?
Wired.
Wired.
Wired.
I feel a little wired to do it right now.
903 on the pole we're getting there, man.
We are really going to do it.
You're going to see.
What did I say last Wednesday?
I felt we had turned the corner.
That's what you said.
And then on Thursday, on Thursday, the day the numbers came out and we found it on Friday.
Wired.
Number one, damage.
We had our legs crossed, our eyes crossed, our fingers crossed, our earlobes crossed.
You know, the one of the worst things about getting old and there ain't nothing good about it.
One of the worst things is all the hair that grows in your ears.
Oh, yeah.
Been discovering that little by little.
Even you?
Even you?
Even you?
Like one of the eights?
Like one incidental hair.
You know, I've got that electric shaver thing that I shaved right hand with over you at three, four days.
I pulled right out of there.
And then of course, I also have to shave.
They do have those things that you're sticking your ear in and I'm not talking about what you're thinking about.
But they have those little, um, your, what, what, what, what, yeah, like that.
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.
That will be a lot easier than trying to stick that big shaver thing in there.
Stick it in your ear.
I've been told to do that and now I'm doing it.
But I'm very obedient.
I follow directions very well.
Okay.
You'll see how obedient that can be, all depending on who's given the directions.
Just the way I am in my advanced age, 900 and 300 pool.
Rocky, cool.
If he does, I hear some of this stuff.
You know, it reminds me of the restaurant.
The restaurant, I remember that when D-fo was on it, I find out over the weekend that D-fo is still on from five to seven in the morning over there.
Against the big.
Oh, that's the same big old that a point three in December.
Uh oh.
And how come nobody gave us the five to seven a and breakout with all those sensations?
Is current state of the day or see you offer another one of his facility as some basketball games?
Well, they got a basketball game tomorrow night, but I guess it's a home game.
Cain's in Virginia Tech.
That should get a huge tune in audience.
Cain's basketball.
How many people go to those games?
About third, man.
Just like the Panther games.
For the life of me, you ought to see the article at Damien Cox Road in the Toronto Star just ripping the Panther organization and South Florida and the Panther fans all five of them.
Just rip them and ask.
And deservedly so.
I mean, the last last way you can't call it a crowd, you know, when there's a couple of people on the street corner, you don't call that a crowd.
When the place is more than half empty, you don't call that a stinkin' crowd.
And about half of the people on Thursday were leaf fans anyway.
And it seems to me, final score was Toronto 3 and Florida 2.
Even though the least we've heard of the four-month set against the penguins, but that's the way it goes, you know.
Can't win them all.
Just like the Patriots last night.
Do I feel bad about that?
Of course, I feel a little bit better, but nice to win another Super Bowl and make the Delphin fans eat more junk.
But, it's just one of those things.
Now it's the Bears and the Colts.
And you know who I'm going to be rooting for, the Bears.
How about you, Chris?
Let's go Colts.
You know, is there anything about Chris that we like?
Well, let's stop and think about this.
Is there anything we like to urge?
We think him.
We're off to anyone after the break.
We'll see if either one of us can finish the game.
This is a...
M-O-N-G-A-Y.
As you see, Chris.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

Which I mean what a lot of you are thinking.
It means before Joyce.
For no good reason, by the way.
Yeah.
Who could understand if there was actually some call for that.
But there isn't.
No, because no, there is a reason.
That's because she hates us like poison.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I mean, she finds that.
I mean, I've told you before.
Like I've told you before, she's done everything to be an impediment to my success.
And throw in every roadblock in my way.
And in spite of that, Joyce.
Clear number one.
Damn it.
Yeah, take that and put it up your bag, honey.
Okay?
Stick it right in the old bag.
And squeeze it a couple of times for old times sake.
Squeeze it for me, bitch.
Two Hollywood teenagers who arrested and charges, they stole nearly $50,000 worth of computers
in equipment from Sheridan Vocational Technical Center and sold them on the street police
said today.
I wonder how much.
One of the teens was identified.
By the way, this computer.
I should really get you one, but you keep telling me it does make any difference.
Or maybe this one won't burn discs and have a problem all day.
Or maybe I will do less.
Since I've been so generous these days, I got that nice fat bonus.
This HP, what is it again?
I don't know what you're talking about.
7220 slim line.
No, it's the slim one.
Oh, I've seen those.
Those are fantastic, man.
They look very nice.
And they work very, very nice.
And it's a beautiful thing.
And I forget, wasn't that expensive either.
I'm going to get you one and send it to you.
Well, Jay, we can, on a fine, this one off.
If I send it, if I send it, there will be a little bit quicker than the, uh,
the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the

be where those Christians, baby, I'm telling you right now they'll burn your ass alive.
Christian later led detectives to the other team. The stolen computers were sold on the streets,
but the herald article still didn't say for how much.
Because if it was like nice and cheap, maybe I get one of those. It's that there's an HP
provision 70 to 20, which is an outstanding computer. I recommend it highly, highly salicy, baby.
I recommend it enthusiastically and with no reservations, is it safe to send signals?
928 votes on the pool. I'm pretty impressed myself. I know you don't get impressed by it there.
It's like a challenge, baby. Everybody enjoys a little bit of a challenge.
Yeah.
It is a challenge.
That's right.
And you'll be pleased to know that I got up at 6.30 this morning. I don't ever get out of
bed at 6.30 anymore. Any for anything.
And I woke up at 5.
I was always wishful often as they say in China.
What word is that mean?
It means I was slapped out.
I haven't even ever woke up.
I've been slapped as much as I'm going to sleep and I'm not having anymore.
I've never heard that turn before.
Oyster shuckin'
Oyster shuckin'
Shuck this.
Shuck you. How do you like that?
Shmuck.
Shuck the shmuck.
Anyway.
And so I laid there and I kept looking at the clock and I'm laying there and I, you know,
and finally around 6.30 I dragged my fat ugly ass out of bed.
That's exciting?
Nope.
I'm thinking we-
I bet you that said Rosencrant Steens spiel thinks it is though and I hopped on the
scale and said 185 and I thought, oh right.
What a wonderful human being I am, you know? I kind of like me a lot.
Frank Rich writes, he's one of my favorite comments and I think maybe I have time for this
before but I don't.
So like I said, I'm going to get to the-
Anyway Florida State created an insurer of last resort. We'll pay almost a million dollars.
The settler lawsuit that leds the former executive took bribes
to steer business to adjusters.
So many crooked people out there alleged.
Citizens property insurance corporate knowledge no wrong doing Friday when it agreed to
pay 950 grand to Houston-based universal risk insurance services to settle the suit
with stem from claims from the devastating 2004 hurricane season.
Universal leds that it was fired in 2004 because it did not make payments to the then
Citizens Chief Operating Officer R Paul Hughes-
Who-
What are his name is?
Halse Bush.
Halse Bush.
That's his name.
H-U-L-S-E-B-U-S-C-H.
Halse Bush.
The company claimed to have learned Halse Bush except at least 25 grand in goods as a bribe
from another adjuster who then won a contract and claims for citizens.
Halse Bush resigned shortly after the allegations remained September 2005.
He has not been charged with a crime.
He didn't return to full message like yesterday as Pennsylvania home by the A&P.
He's thinking about calling back when Dixie Alonblas.
Perry Cohn.
Who?
What are his kin to Marty?
Citizen General Counsel said it was less expensive to settle the case than to continue
fighting in court.
Universal saw 4.6 million dollars in damages.
We just don't have enough information out of no definitively whether wrong doing
by others did or did not occur at Cohn said.
The company said it may seek damages if criminal charges are ever brought in the case.
Citizens spokesman Rocky Scott-
I wonder what happened to Rocky Raccoon?
What that was the guy's name?
H-E-B-U-L-S-C-H.
Not Rocky, it's only you.
Rocky, you know who I'm talking about?
No.
He used to be a guest on my show back in the days when I had those boring guests on here.
It was a two-school teacher in Dave County.
Sorry.
Rocky, uh, oh my god.
I bet you somebody out there might know but probably not.
Rocky the Flies Quirl.
That's the one.
Citizen spokesman Rocky Scott said Universal's suggested contract was taken away from the company
because it was unable to add to where the handbook claims to have been through it during the
2004 storms.
Universal executives did not return a full message left at their headquarters on Sunday.
And by the way, there's almost no snow on the ground.
It's the 22nd of January.
Not that there's anything such as global warming you understand.
I know it's the, uh, one of the El Nino, maybe it's El Nino.
That's what they say.
A lot of it's El Nino and a lot of it's global warming.
Minus seven, I have no idea what that is.
What is that about like 20, uh, yeah, I don't know.
20 something degrees of Fahrenheit.
Not too toasty.
It's a little honestly said, but there's almost no snow very little.
All the only stuff that's left is what's frozen over from Monday.
When we had about an inch.
Of course, today is Monday and I do have about an inch.
930 votes on the pool.
Nine what?
About 30, man.
Not bad.
We'll get close to that thousand before two shakes of your, uh, hamhawk.
Two shakes of a lamb's tail, my ass.
This is the most disgusting program.
I urge everyone to complain to this station.
A man attempts to investigate the disappearance of two people.
But he is hindered by a lower intestinal problem.
You're gonna be in my way.
You won't want to miss random fart.
Um, anyway, they're on a f**k.
It's edge of your seat tension for obvious reason.
Boy, where did that come from?
I'm sorry.
Anyway, your husband.
Random fart.
He probably follow your nose to a theater area.
That one.
Okay, that's the question.
There's Queen Elizabeth the tooth that he ever farted.
And of course, the obvious answer is, uh, uh,
A lot of problems in the oil when I heard his cuisine.
The royal fart.
That's why they have those expressions on their faces.
Rocky Raisin, how do you like that?
Never heard of them.
Well, what the would you know about that?
Nothing.
Here's more than a message.
South of us, 19th street is named after him.
In the Shenandoah area says your buddy Moishi.
Well, how do you like that?
I knew he knew something.
Rocky Raisin, he's got a street named after him.
Well, he's not dead then, is he?
Do it can they name streets after living people?
I don't think so.
I'm not really sure that.
They can do anything they want.
But we have that kind of shulic expressway.
Is he alive?
I said living people.
Well, I mean, brains in a jar.
Brain dead doesn't count.
Oh, no.
Where is that though?
There it is.
Gunsula!
They have them!
Yeah, when you're a close best personal friends there.
Very sad.
Frank Ritz says lying like it's 2003.
Those who forget history may be doomed to repeat it,
but who could imagine we'd already be in danger
of replaying that rotten year 2003?
Scooter Libby.
The mastermind behind the White House's bogus interiors
for giddling up the war in Iraq
is back at Washington's center stage,
proudly defending the indefensible
and a perjury trial.
Ahmed Chaliby, the pebbler of flawed people
in intelligence height by Mr. Libby,
is back in Clover and Baghdad,
where he purports to lead the government's
Shiite-Bathist reconciliation efforts
in between visits to his pal,
Mahmoud Ahmedinajah and Iran.
I love saying that.
Mahmoud Ahmedinajah.
Oh, no, no, no.
Makes my throat tingle when I say that.
Last but never least is Mr. Libby's former boss
and Mr. Chaliby's former patron,
Dick Cheney, who is back on Sunday morning TV
floating fictions about Iraq
and accusing administration critics of aiding al-Qaeda.
When the vice president went on a tear like this in 2003,
Hawking Iraq's non-existent WMD
and non-existent connections to Mahmoud Ahmed Ata,
he set the stage for war that now kills
Iraqi civilians in rising numbers,
34,000 plus last year,
that are heading under the genocidal realms of Sodom.
Mr. Cheney's latest sales
pretends for a new plan for victory,
promising an even bigger bloodbath.
Mr. Cheney was honest to the least
when he said that the White House's Iraq policy
would remain on full speed ahead,
no matter what happened on November 7th.
Now it's our patriotic duty-political
system to press and to public like to apply the brakes.
Our failure to check the administration
when it right into Iraq in 2003
will look even more shameful
to history if we roll over again for a reboot in 2007.
For all he believed in Washington's scrutiny
of the worst since the election
and for all the heralded
of so far symbolic congressional efforts
to challenge it,
too much lip service is still being paid
into the deceptive PR strategies
used by the administration
to sell its reckless policies.
This time he must do what Tufu did the first time,
call the White House on its lies,
lie should not be confused with you
for missing the competence in denial.
By the way, can I interrupt my reading
it's a long article?
So you sent me something,
Eric found out why I won't print that thing on there online.
There was something in the forums
in the what do you call it,
the technical issues.
There's a focus on the focus?
Yeah, I sent you the link to it,
but I didn't read it because
I'm not going to read that.
Technical several to I know about it.
Thanks, Eric.
I don't want to read.
And by the way, Eric,
what is AIM?
AIM, is that A. Well instant?
Listen, Eric.
Oh, I'm not going to mad.
That poisoned.
Too even invited to check that out,
but I think I'll call it away because A. Well is evil,
but now.
Which you hate worst,
crap, macaroni and cheese are A. Well.
They're all in there together with Walmart.
Mr. Changes Performance last week on Fox News Sunday
illustrates the problem.
His lying is nowhere near its last throws.
Asked by Chris Wallace about the White House's decision
to overrule commanders who recommended
against a true post-colation,
the vice president said,
I don't think we've overruled the commanders.
He claimed we've made enormous progress in Iraq.
He said the administration is not in battle.
Well, maybe that one is denial.
This White House gang is so practiced
in lying with a straight face
that it never thinks twice about recycling its greatest hits.
Hours after Mr. Chany's fox hit,
if your president Bush was on 60 minutes
claiming that before the war,
everybody was wrong on weapons of mass destruction
and that the minute we found out that WMD didn't exist,
he was the first to say so.
Everybody of course was not wrong on WMD,
starting with you on weapons inspection team in Iraq.
Nor was Mr. Bush the first to come clean
once the truth became apparent after the invasion.
On May 29, 2003, two days after a secret
defense intelligence agency sponsored mission
found no biological weapons
and trade was captured by the American forces,
Mr. Bush declared we found the weapons
of mass destruction,
we found biological laboratories.
Right.
But that's all WMD under the bridge.
The most important lies to watch for now are
the new ones being reiterated daily
by the administration's top press
from Mr. Chany and Mr. Chany on down.
You know, Fiasco awaits America
when everyone in the White House
is reading in Unison from the same official script
as they did back in the day when Mushroom clouds
and uranium from Africa with the daily drumbeat.
The latest lies are custom made to prop up the new way
forward that is anything but.
Among the emerging examples is a rewriting
of the history of Iraq's sectarian violence.
The fictional version was initially laid out
by Mr. Bush in January 10th prime time speech
and has since been repeated on television
by both Mr. Chany and National Security Adviser
Stephen Hadley.
Last Sunday and by Mr. Bush again on PBS's
New Zower Tuesday.
It goes like this.
sectarian violence didn't start spiraling out of control
until the summer of 2006
actor Sunni Terrorist bombed the Golden Mosque
in Samara and forced the Shiites to take revenge.
But as Mark Sybal of Maclatchy newspapers
noted last week, the president's account
understates by at least 15 months.
When Shiites clasped began targeting Sunni
politicians and clerks,
they were visible in embryo long before that.
The times among others reported this far back
in September 2003
that Shiite militias were becoming more radical,
more dangerous and anti-American.
Like us, Andy American.
The reasons Mr. Bush pretends that Shiite
killing started only last year are obvious enough.
He wants to duck a capability for failing to recognize
the sectarian violence from the outset.
Much as he failed to recognize the Sunni
insurgency before it,
and to underplay the interactability of the
Civil War to which he will now sacrifice
fresh American flesh.
An equally big lies.
Fresh American flesh.
As Ms. Foley would say,
with or without the silk underwear on.
An equally big lies.
The administration's constant claim that it's on the same page
as Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki as we go full speed ahead.
Only last month Mr. Maliki told the Wall Street Journal
that he wished he could be done with his role as a
vice leader before the end of this term.
Now we're asked to believe not merely that he's a strong man
capable of inquisiting the death squads of the
anti-American cleric Mokata al-Sadr,
his political ally,
but also that he can be trusted to produce the troops he failed
to supply last year's failed Baghdad crackdown.
It as recently as November,
there still wasn't a singular raki
but having capable of fighting on its own.
Not Uno.
Hardly a day pass without Mr. Maliki mocking the White House's
professed faith in him.
In the past week or so alone, he's presented over a second botched hanging,
despite the laying it for more than two weeks to put in place new guidelines,
charged Condi Rice with giving a morale boost to the terrorist
because he criticized him.
An overworld American objections to a point
an obscure commander from deep-in-cheai territory
to run the Baghdad surge.
His government doesn't even try to hide its greater religions to Iran.
Mr. Maliki's foreign minister has asked for the release of the five Iranian
detainment in American raid on an Iranian office in northern Iraq this month
and on Monday called for setting up more Iranian consulants in Iraq.
The president's pretense that Mr. Maliki and his inept ill-equipped militia
in infiltrated security forces can advance American interest in this war
is Neville Chamberlain like in its NIFT in this ingenuousness.
Oh, I love that.
It's NIFT in this ingenuousness.
Both of them?
An American military official in Baghdad read the writing on the wall
to the Times last week,
we're implementing a strategy to win boldly government that is actually part of the problem.
We are being played like a pawn.
That's why the most destructive live-all, maybe the White House is constant
referring that its doomed strategy is the only one anyone is proposed.
Administration,
Criticist, Mr. Cheney said last Sunday have absolutely nothing to offer in its place
as if the Iraq study group, John Worth and Joe Biden,
less of yellow plans,
among others,
didn't predate the White House's own.
In reality, we're learning peace by peace that the White House has no plan.
Ms. Rice has now downsized the surge escalation into an augmentation
and inadvertently divulging how the Pentagon is improvising,
struggling small deployments and fits and starts.
No one can plausibly explain how a parallel chain of command
sending American and Iraqi troops into urban street combat side by side
will work with Iraqis in the lead.
It'll report to a committee led by Mr. Maliki,
or how a billion dollars in new American reconstruction spending
will accomplish what the 30 billion thrown down the drain
in previous reconstruction spending did not.
About 30, man.
All of this replaced 2003 when the White House refused to consider any plan,
including existing ones in the Pentagon and the State Department,
bureaucracy's for coping with a broken post-Sautomarack.
Then is that every stage of the war since then the only administration plan was for a propaganda
campaign to ban Boozle American voters into believing that victory was just around the corner.
The next push on the way forward propaganda campaign arrives tomorrow night
with the State of the Union address, why are we going to, I'm sure,
going to miss that.
Perchew?
Yeah, I am.
I wouldn't want you to be paid me by the millisecond.
The good news is that the Democrats have chosen Jim Webb,
the New Virginia Center to give their official response.
Mr. Webb, a Reagan administration Navy Secretary, and the father of a son currently serving
Interrac has already provoked a testy exchange about the war with the president of White House
reception for freshmen in Congress.
He's the kind of guy likely to keep a scorecard of the lies on Tuesday night.
Whether he does or not, it's incumbent on all those talking heads who are fell for a shock and
awe and mission accomplished in 2003, not to let history repeat itself in 2007, facing the truth is
the only way forward Interrac's Frank rich in the New York Times yesterday.
You go Frank, baby.
A great American if he asked me.
So who died that 71-year-old actor from a whatever show that was that I didn't watch?
Ron Carey from Barney Miller and other hated Barney Miller.
I mean, is that just respectful when a guy dies and he was on that show and I said,
oh, I hated that show.
I didn't watch it.
Oh, I liked it.
You like Barney Miller?
Back then, yeah.
Was that to show with a guy with a mustache, Lenthal?
Lenthal?
Lenthal?
Lenthal, yeah.
Oh, hate that.
Cornball, hell then.
He's like a throwback to those back in the day, the olden times, like in the 1890s.
Like Rudy Valley.
947 votes, but it slowed down a little bit on here because now that we've assumed the
thousand, which will make easy, but see the way they are?
I manipulate them like, remember in the beginning of the Godfather of Crociado,
the puppets on the strings?
That's right.
Who's holding the strings?
It's one thing to be manipulated, but it damn well better feel good.
948 votes, who post a greater threat to the human gene pool?
Neocons 304.
Hubman Dread, as they say in Finland.
Why, I sure love Helsinki, man.
I love it.
The average American Idol viewer 241, those are the only two like even above 100.
How about Neocons, watch American Idol?
People who watch poker on TV 95.
By the way, sorry.
Yes.
Pokebriand just reminded me.
Chikonek, yeah?
Yeah.
That Ron Kerry was Jr.
As in...
That's the Hanikunja.
Oh, that's who that was.
I thought the name was from a...
He was good.
Yeah.
You love bread.
I like bread.
You love bread.
That's right.
Thank you, Pokebriand.
Yeah, thanks you, Chikonek.
My mind.
People who watch better not read that again.
The average American Idol, what?
I don't want to get anybody aggravated.
It's just one of those things.
You know me.
I'm just such a...
Askissor.
The average American Idol contest in 74.
MySpace.com member is 67 with many, many exceptions.
The average is WQM, a sports show caller 65.
I hate this full 54.
The average Nierage show caller 49.
So our caller is as infrequent and as grotesque so many of them are.
They got the sports nerd callers beat.
Our sports nerd callers may actually say a few words every now and then.
But it's pretty much...
Well, what do you think about Jimmy and Danny and Danny and Jimmy?
What about that...
No good next statement in my audio.
Now is that thing you told me before to show?
Is that a secret or what?
I don't know.
About the big promotion.
I bet I'm not saying anything.
Because every time I open up a mouth and not that I care about me
but I don't want to get your answer in how water is going to disappear.
Oh, there goes Georgie.
What do you mean?
You don't care.
I don't understand.
You don't care how much hot water I'm like.
I didn't send you that to you.
Check it.
Okay, it's only a couple of grand.
Whatever.
I mean, don't.
Well, Ella.
So you tell me that Christlosses is Republican.
He hates the Patriots.
He's rooting for the cults and Sandi paid men,
which is one of the most unshiss.
But he does tip the delivery guy for the food.
That's right.
He hates fags too, did I mention that?
Great.
And this show.
Boy, I got this box here.
That was intentional.
Just seeing, just testing it, I'll see.
Thoughts what's going to happen a lot from now on.
We find out where your true colors are.
What about 380?
We got some fat people in that building,
voicing them to think I got them there.
Yeah, fat people in radio.
How unusual.
People who sit on their ass all day like me.
During this break, I'm going to get up and run around
a room a couple of times.
Do you believe me?
No.
No chance.
1157, a QM time.
This is Brady Quinn.
Whatever I shape up all.
I listen to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.
Or black.
Screw you!
Oh!
This is Story of a coach named Nick Saving.
He is the guy who just deserted the doffins.
Seems he doesn't care what other people might call him.
He sunk another nail into the doffins coffin.
It didn't take long for Nick to decide.
He was gonna leave and coat the grins and tie.
You fairy.
Whenever he was asked about it, he always lies.
We watch Nick take the money and run.
Go on, take the money and run.
So long, take the money and run.
Go on, take the money and run.
So long, take the money and run.
No longer on the sidelines in that stupid hat.
With the team and now they're feeling so flat.
I wonder what Wayne Highson go really things of that.
The doffins are sinking, ship and dick is all right.
Every excuse Nick gets for leaving sounds lame.
A whole lot of money.
You coach football games.
And if it was you, you know that you do the same.
I guess that's why Nick doesn't feel any shame.
Go on, take the money and run.
So long, take the money and run.
Go on, take the money and run.
So long, take the money and run.
Take the money and run.
Absolutely.
Hi, my Nick.
And who cares, you know.
So that promotion we're telling me about sounds really.
Oh man, that should do it.
When you think you're going to put Kenny and Bo right over the top,
I would think so.
I have no doubt.
So you know, it's toast ideas.
I would you tell me?
I think he's going to be toast pretty soon.
That's the rumor.
What is his story anyway?
See like pretty good guys.
He, I don't know if I had to maybe be maybe five words with him.
Come on.
I'm telling you toast.
Yeah.
Now where do we know him from?
We'll see on one of those other shows.
So if he's made up for breakfast food,
it must be for date all and run.
Old Paul and ancient Ron.
They did okay.
They had a pretty good number in there on front.
Hey, listen, I give the, I don't make up stories.
Okay, some of these people in this market,
they've been doing it for years.
Oh, I like like for real.
I'd be found out of staring the hell he did, you know.
One of the first things the Humber told me about for when he came on here with us.
He's a liar.
That's what the Humber said.
Okay.
He said he's a freaking liar.
That was, that's what he said.
I mean, I don't know.
I could care about him.
Let's one way or the other.
Why do we good job on our license there, Scott?
970 votes on the poll.
This is the half hour we go.
We're a thousand.
I told him we'd ease into it.
Did I say that?
We had only like six something when we started.
I believe.
Did you see the single right?
Elliot Rodriguez?
No, there's a thing.
Only about, I cannot stand him, man.
I think I think back to those alien days, man.
He was just a professional hulio during those days.
Him and Ricky Tiki Sanchez, who was on CNN last night as my channel,
as my channel switched real fast.
Yeah, lucky you.
It's on automatic pilot when Ricky Sanchez comes out and move to the next channel.
When CGS 4 anchor, Elliot Rodriguez was sued for divorce by his wife for 13 years,
who then argued that a judge should have worked
with a bigger cut of their assets.
He reluctantly made a decision that puts him in a very small fraternity.
Rodriguez, 50, decided to ask for alimony.
Any relation, George?
I'm sorry.
What is it?
It's only like 42 million Rodriguez's in Florida.
I know.
Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was one Rodriguez and he was very busy.
Well, what does that mean?
Oh, I see.
In other words, that's where you all came from.
Yeah, that's right.
Despite laws in Florida deciding to be goose devour,
he's going to take alimony.
What a chula.
What the hell does that mean?
That sounds like something you're disgusting and perverted.
It sounds like something you're highlighting.
Disgusting, but not perverted.
Oh, despite laws in Florida deciding to reduce divorce to a matter of numbers,
and will make the influences of age-old gender biases,
few men ever seek alimony lawyers say an even fewer ever get it,
and the alimony either.
Whether it's fragile male ego or the continuing disparity in incomes between men and women,
in the absence of any studies, lawyers elect a theorized,
men don't go after the money to loss as they can have.
A lot of lawyers feel uncomfortable even asking for alimony,
even if the men are entitled because it's a very tough
roto hose that promised divorce to Trinity and drew line-off.
They know a lot of judges raise their eyebrows at it.
However, as women increasing the outpace their husbands and earnings,
the percentage of women who earn more jump from nearly 18% in 1987 to more than 25% in 2004,
the number of men receiving alimony will surely rise.
When you look at the stats of where people make money, it's in the small businesses,
and most small businesses are owned by women.
Says forensic accountant Loretta Fabricant, who currently has two cases,
in which the husbands be seeking alimony.
She says she wants self-defense,
probably, to husband when 10 grand a month in the support.
I'll take it. I don't need it, but I'll take it.
I'll take whatever they're giving.
I'll take that bonus money, too, by the way.
Thank you. Joe Bell.
And he come in and give you that big kiss that you've been waiting for?
No.
I'm the chief rectum.
No, I'm getting start, I'm starting to get a little bit put out.
I better check all my other 800 emails that I got.
I'll tell you one thing about this thing.
Like I said, you last week, this is a Myspace place.
This thing is keeping me real busy.
I mean, oh man, do that.
I am doing about 16 different shows at the same time.
Should it be good for losing weight, wouldn't you think?
I'm not.
Now do you think it's possible?
What's the date today? 22nd?
Yeah, then in about a month, I could lose another 15 pounds.
And that shouldn't be hard at all.
It's possible, but you know.
But what?
I mean, don't set your goal so high that if you don't make it,
you'll be all crushed and go eat some ice cream.
This year, Faber can't consult a woman who hit a big
in the recent real estate boom after calculating how much
it would cost her the woman decided not to divorce her husband.
It's going to become more prevalent as more and more women escalating their
professions. Faber can't be seen as co-anchor of the 530 PM
newscast and an Emmy winning reporter Rodriguez earns 300 grand a year.
His wife, the univision anchor, Maria Elena Salinas.
Did I say that right? Maria Elena Salinas?
Sure. 51.
To the Quattro Uno, I'm sure I'm doing a tag you know.
Earns more, the numbers are so similar, you know, I get all confused,
but that's all I can say in Spanish or Italian anyways, a few numbers.
I've seen a few good numbers.
She earns more, upward to 2 million a year,
with a 60 grand a month available for expenses, he's saying,
she earns 2 million here, he's making 300 grand,
it's just bad for a pucks like him.
What's wrong with 300 grand a year?
Well, I'll take it like a better if my wife earned 2 million a year,
something whatever the hell she makes.
More what a nasty divorce that would be.
The couple also owns a very hasty one too.
The couple also owns a four bedroom 39 square foot house and croak tables,
and a 2,000 square foot condo in Kibisky,
together valid over 2.1 million.
Does sound to me let them missing any meals on Tidda Hat?
No.
Rodriguez said he would happily ascettle for an even split of their assets,
but his wife who left on Mother's Day in Fountain of Diverse,
argued that she had contributed more to their thing,
and therefore was entitled to more.
She also asked for child support.
Rodriguez agreed both should support their two daughters,
and that is why she'd get the house and croak tables
if he got paid for his hat.
He's now living in the couple's condo in faces,
mortgage, tax and maintenance fees of 5,500 each month he says.
Those condo commandos will get your ass man if you don't watch out.
He also argued that he was entitled to Alamonian turney's fees
to maintain the marital lifestyle.
That's one thing that's a little bit ugly,
his lower earnings his wife condo would do to his own lack of ambition.
His lower earnings his wife said,
redo to his own lack of ambition.
Are you laughing at Alamonian Rodriguez now?
What is wrong with you man?
It's so insensitive.
That is your test.
That's one thing's a little bit ugly.
His lower earnings is what kind of a dude who is lack of ambition.
How do you like that?
That's not the real thing.
That's not the name.
Write him a heart.
Write the middle of the back.
Write them a solar of plexus.
Let's just leave that on, Bill.
And here's something I think we could play that for four hours
and eight minutes to get the best numbers on the station.
Don't you?
Let's try it for a few months.
Our position is that once they're divorced they're simply no need
since the service is attorney,
but his insurance and Alamonian Rodriguez is not eating Alamonian
when it makes 200 grand.
He can support himself like everybody else
making 300 grand a year.
I remember when I made 300 grand a year.
You know what that was?
Well, let's have a go.
The first year at IOD.
I shouldn't be talking about how much money I make
because then there are people, you know,
clean-ons come out of the woodwork.
So, lean to the, so lean to the side
that Rodriguez had contributed to her career
if anything she argued he constantly criticized during complaint.
The only reason that Thosmond didn't further advanced his own career
was due to his lack of desire to do so
so lean to the attorney's road.
We're reluctant to be cast as a poster boy for Alamonian
where Rodriguez explained the instructions he gave
as attorneys.
I said, look, I'm a journalist.
What I do for living is gather information.
I've gathered the information in this case
and you can give it all to all of you very high-priced lawyers.
Now, please apply to my case
and let me move on.
He said to telephone interview.
Instead, I find myself in the middle of this legal battle
that I don't want to be part of.
That's what your buddy, Elliot, Arada Rodriguez said.
He says that he's going after the Alamonian
because he's entitled to it
because of the difference in salaries and marital lifestyle.
If he wasn't entitled to it, he says he wouldn't want it.
But it isn't that simple.
It says in the Harold.
In 95, in a seminal case that brought the same issue
in a bitter courtroom battle, attorney Alice Hector,
a partner with Steel Hector and Davis, found her divorce
after a stay at home husband, Robert Young.
Father knows best, not that Robert Young,
admitted to having an affair.
After a 10-year battle over the 14-year marriage,
where Young walked away,
we just 36 ran in Alamonian.
Florida Supreme Court made Alamonian gender
neutral in 1980, said attorney Mark Maurice Cutner,
who's representing Rodriguez.
Every case he said is supposed to be based
on the fairly straightforward set of operative facts.
Speaking of Maurice Cutner,
I wonder how I've been not saying.
I wonder how Mark Cune is doing.
And Mark Cune.
I do.
Did you ever meet him?
Remember we had that big seminar then?
Who the hell was that?
That seminar.
There wasn't Walter Sabre, was it?
Yeah, it was.
And that was my one and only encounter with my brother.
Oh my god, what a jackass.
Walter Sabre, who I turned out to want to be our friend
on my space and I told him,
get lost, Walter.
A radio consultant.
You know, people that are really broadcasters,
they broadcast, people that can't broadcast,
they're consultants.
And people are really managers.
Higher than you.
Yeah, and people that can't manage,
you're going to get appointed to be general manager.
Glorified salespeople are most managers.
That's why the Casper was such a genius.
He had been a salesman,
but he was a programming maven.
He understood that it was more than just going out
and selling a bunch of spots
and say, give us the damn money.
We want your money, honey.
Sonny.
So the guy who played the Dom Delewese's brother,
Jr.
Oh my god, he died.
What was his name again?
Ron Carey.
Grab my junior, honey.
Very sad day for the human race.
God.
No sour stays but she drinks more than she eats.
Nicole Paz,
like a last time.
Tap rotsy,
down low,
stone with camera.
And in pictures,
she looks so soft.
Oh.
My god,
he's good.
He's a good boss.
She's skinny like a skeleton,
and you're all right.
My daughter's skinny.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She's skinny like a skeleton.
Oh.
She wants to get high.
So high.
She wants to drink and smoke in that city.
Oh, not it.
She's the same rich.
Real green.
Oh, yeah.
My daughter's skinny.
Oh,
skinny like a skeleton.
My pain is getting higher.
But skinny like a skeleton.
I wonder if there's a reason for that, you think?
That his daughter's so little on the anorexia-proof inside.
Can't imagine what it might be.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking more like that.
Ron Kerry of Miller TV succumbed it.
I guess he was a little pudgy, huh?
Maybe he had too many pieces of bread.
Possible.
Ron Kerry, the puckish comedic actor,
puckish.
Maybe he was a hockey fan.
The puckish comedic actor played officer Carl Levin on a situation comedy.
Barney Miller was a member of Melbourne's troop film such as
High Anxiety in Silent Movie.
Died of a stroke last Tuesday.
He was 71.
But the news shrugged out around slowly, didn't it?
Because they just had it on the yesterdays.
And then of course this is from, I don't know where from, the early times.
Ron Kerry was truly talented, very funny.
One of the dearest men I've ever worked with.
Brooks who also cast Mr. Heary as Swiftus in the Roman era segment of history of the world part one
said in a statement.
I wonder if he was akin to biggest, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh five out of seven, five whatever it takes out, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh leaves, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
By the way, Schmender threw across the street.
Joel Feinberg said, remember good times which you hated that theme so bad?
He got a theme for the tickets called Bad Times.
Now let's see, where is the good times?
Good time where you hated.
That's why I'm planning.
Not to aggravate you, but just to try to prove that you're wrong.
As usual.
Good time.
Good time.
Good time.
And the most amazing things I hated that show, I couldn't stand that show, but I was
thinking that the theme is great.
I hated both of them.
He and the show.
What is this part's great?
Under water?
Wow.
It just stopped.
Good.
It just stopped by itself.
Good time.
I think my Denon machine, or I could mine.
I'm not the only one.
I'm the only one.
What am I?
The only one.
You don't like good times, Steve?
Ah, it's okay.
Here's the only good version.
Good times.
Yeah.
Oh.
As love at Mr. Curie was the patrolman who was eager to transfer into the detective squad,
a former state of comic he broke into his film, playing a Boston cab driver in the outer
towners, the 1970 comedy starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis.
Mr. Curie's film credits also include playing Dom D'Aloy's brother.
Get the honey, too.
In the vicinity comedy drama Faso was written and directed by Anne Bancroff and was great.
You saw it, right Chris?
Faso?
Not yet.
Uh oh.
Maybe that'll inspire him to lose the record.
I was on such a role here, man.
I was on a jelly role.
Told you this guy was no good.
Oh.
At least he's consistent.
There's something you said for that.
Mr. Curie who also appeared in the Scores of Commercials for a Pride being a supporting player
and a character actor.
He was a player.
Stars are stars.
He told NewsDane 89, but without us, the show wouldn't go on.
He was born Ronald Joseph Sassinia.
Was that Satinia in Italy?
It would be, I don't know.
In 1935 to December 11th in Newark, New Jersey.
He launched a standup career in New York's...
In New York after earning a bachelor's degree from communications from Seton Hall in
South Orange, New Jersey.
And he survived by somebody, but it chopped off in a home.
Whatever you think.
I'm sure it was chopped off on your end, too.
He was the worst when somebody chopped off your end.
A thousand eighteen votes on the pool, baby.
And of course, at birth they did that to me.
And boy, they really got carried away.
Very unfair.
I should sue the moiled.
You know, I'm sure he's dead long since, but if I had the ability I would do it.
So the estate.
The estate of the moiled.
That's right.
What kind of a job is that anyway?
What kind of person, yay, wants to slice off a foreskin.
All of it like the proctologist who wakes up when they go, you know what, that's what I
want to get into.
I know a lot of you guys want to get into that.
No pun intended.
I say get away from me.
Get away.
Get away.
There are a lot of there.
A few people out there.
I would do virtually anything for them, but guess what?
That's not one of them.
No way, Jose.
What if it was really small?
No.
I beg your pardon?
The request.
Oh.
Who posted a greater threat to the human gene pool besides George?
That's our pool question.
A thousand.
Oh, there there.
There's Mr. Speaker.
They present the eye.
Look at all these schmenders.
They're with Bush speaking of schmenders.
Oh, talk.
Oh, tomorrow night's the big night.
So I have something planned for tomorrow.
I do.
Neocons 327.
The average American idol viewer 256, almost 100 behind.
And now people who watch poker on TV's got over 100 and 40.
Uh-oh.
The average American idol contestant 77, myspace.com members 73, except for those of us select people
who are wonderful folks just to ask us.
We'll tell you.
The average of the QM Sports Showcolor 69.
Uh-oh.
I hate this pool 63, 6.1%.
And the average Neil Rogers Showcolor, a mere Chinquanta, Chinquanta banana.
And don't forget.
Get the honey, Junior.
Wash, bruh.
Wash, bruh.
Wash, bruh.
Fashion models.
Sure they're beautiful and glamorous.
But did you know that every night many go to bed hungry?
Hi, I'm Sally Struthers for the Feed the Models Foundation.
For just 10 days a day, you can help feed a starving model like Nikki.
I was too thin, but thanks to Feed the Models, no I can eat and eat and eat.
But I still don't get them all.
Hey, you, I really hate you.
You skinny wench.
When you sponsor a model, you'll get a letter of thanks plus a photo.
But you know it's been heavily airbrushed because nobody looks that good.
That's what you think, chubby girl.
Caught Feed the Models today because I really don't know how much more of this I can take before I fall off and hit somebody.
But as long as you don't sip on me.
Oh, that makes out so much.
Feed the Models.
If you don't have to know, please bring more gold from slim to none.
Hello, I'm Carol O'Cala.
To close the album, our own song, we dedicated to you then and to you now.
Now we're a young person.
Will you listen to me, Britchain?
Boy, the way Glenn will play.
So let me play it for you.
Array!
Because like me, we had a great house for the day.
It don't well friskate.
And everybody wants this way.
We are all a small, right great house for the day.
Have you knew what you were doing?
There's for girls and men, woman.
History can use a bad life, baby, to put her again.
People seem to need your hands.
If we always break the rent,
Fricks were in a sink and can't come back again.
Don't we ever say this to me?
I've had to watch the judges win.
Have you sound like a DJ?
The course you want to rock in.
And we sure didn't say to anyone.
Case with me, I really saw the song.
I know just you want to move on.
Those were the days.
Alright, let's do the themes again.
TV things.
We haven't done that in a long, long time.
You're right.
What do you think?
Let's do it.
Let's do that for tomorrow.
Although I've got all these other great pools.
Now that one that's regular renew.
We've got all kinds of pool ascenders now.
Which is beautiful.
He missed something on this pool.
Yeah, I must say.
Well, she's not on there, so.
Well, I could be interpreted more than one way,
but I'm sure I get you.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I think in your case,
because it will only be interpreted one way.
Oh, I'm speaking of the tree lady.
And some returner out there who would never want to grow up.
This is Shirley Jones, working with the right states and oversees.
Is that sweet?
Alright.
Somebody step by day.
Hey, Bonitucci, okay, before he muffle fire.
Hello, world, and a song.
Hello, world, and a song.
That's the same as the book.
Come on, get happy.
A whole lot of love in his life will be breaking.
We'll make you happy.
You're fairly good.
Okay, David, calm down.
1045 votes on the pool.
We're going to go over 1100 today on a day
when we just had kind of a week start.
That's because everybody was like passed out and drained
from those football games yesterday.
Especially the Patriots blowing at big lead against...
I bet you'll love that all the fans were having nervous breakdown,
including Chris when they had that 21-3 lead.
Not just the game was over, no one learned about it.
Oh.
Well, look at this.
Concerns about monopolies and fears of a possible fascist take over the US media.
Have prompted a Democratic congressman to push to be stored
a fairness doctrine according to Raj Storey.
Media reform is the most important issue
confronting our Democratic Republic and the people of our country.
Representative Maurice Hinchy, Democratic New York said
that the free presidential media reform conference
held in Memphis, Tennessee last weekend.
This is a critical moment in history that may determine the future
of our country maybe forever.
Hinchy told Raj's story plans to reintroduce the Media Ownership Reform Act,
Mora, that would break up media monopolies and restore
the fairness doctrine, which was eliminated by the FCC under the Reagan administration.
Remember Ronnie Ray Gunn?
Fashista?
I don't remember.
Fashista with a grease down here and he abusted around the shoe polish?
If Raj shoots his mouth off, he must give equal access to our side.
Hinchy said the American public will begin to get both sides
or all sides of an issue that is basic fundamental way democracy,
he be saying.
Last year Hinchy had reduced House Bill 3302 Mora
but Republicans blocked the Measure and Committee.
He also founded the future of American media caucus in Congress in 2005
with Democrats now in control of Congress.
A new media reform measure is expected to be a side of the House Energy and Congress
committed within the next couple of weeks.
Hinchy's staff be confirmed.
We'll be trying hard to get the subcommittee and the full committee chairman
to bring this to the House floor Hinchy.
Fledz, a companion bill being produced on the Senate side by Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Mora would restore the fairness doctrine, reinstate the National Cap on ownership of radio
estaciones, those are the number of radio stations that one company can own in the local market,
and reinstate the 25% National Cap on TV ownership among other things.
All of these things.
All of these things.
The bill's no grandfathering provision would compel media conglomerates
that if they were to comply with new ownership limitations,
Mora would also require public interest reports from broadcasters
and require more independently produced programming on TV.
In addition to establishes new public interest obligations to assure
that broadcasters meet the needs of local communities and requires increased sustained public input
and I'll reach to you the people they voice in programming.
But let me ask you one question.
What does that have to do with sports?
Oh, nothing.
And with sports.
It doesn't matter.
Talk Radio has become dominated by shows that are right wing,
even the old fascist he said adding that even the best newspapers
give readers a con job by reporting false information fed by the administration.
This should make every single citizen America deeply concerned he told the conference attendees
what lies will they tell in the future to jeopardize democratic republic
or even end this democratic republic.
That's the objective of many of those involved.
Fascist, fascist, fascist, communista, batista.
It's all these things.
How's the elder one?
How's the least that?
Oh no.
Maybe it wasn't Ryan Kerry that time.
Maybe it was Fidel.
He should have listened to Hyde and Ra.
To Rocky Colovito.
Who was it on that spot?
It's some gory man.
Too many.
What spot?
What spot?
The one where he said Rocky Colovito.
I couldn't believe that.
I don't know.
I don't know.
He was going this morning.
We're supposed to be a sports station.
We've got some Schmendrich on there doing Rocky Colovito.
I mean, granted, he's probably, you know,
hadn't played him about a hundred years, but nevertheless.
So what's an ombudsman?
An ombudsman is a guy who's like, you know, like a people's spokesman.
Oh, like your butt.
Who's that?
It's on the CNN International there.
Yeah, but what's that got to do?
Oh, yeah, that's what you're talking about when a man...
A bud's.
Yeah, the right.
Like the people's buddy.
That's right.
An ombudsman who's like, goes to Bafford of people
and like, when he gets screwed, which is all the time.
And don't even feel good.
I've said one thing.
The phone is nice and quiet on a Monday.
I'm not prepared on a Monday for a whole lot.
Oh, now I looked at it and as soon as I said that,
it's almost like we have no delay.
WQAM, hello.
Oh, I'm going to get it.
WQAM, hello.
I'm up.
Okay, like I said, why did I look over there?
It was a bad move on my part.
WQAM, hello.
Oh, wow.

Go ahead.
Hey, yes.

You love dogs.
Mm-hmm.
And just so you know, I am big.
I am big.
Let your qualifies in the call issue.

What's your hope the dog don't want up in a microwave.
And he'll want to be in big with him.

Well, congratulations, sir.
That's all I can tell you.
Congratulations.

Northern Irish police.
Perfectly.
Look at that.
Northern Ireland.
You're racked all over the world.
There was good religion stuff there.
Man, they're doing it.
And let me tell you folks out there right now.
Because I don't want to get back on a religious cake here today
because it's Monday and whatever else, whatever other reason.
No, I might just...
That's the one thing religions do better than anybody else.
Killsle people.
That's right.
Usually a whole lot of them.
21 before 1 at 560 W.
We got the mad dog at 2.
The big power hour with the Henry Goldberg and the mad dog
together.
4 to 5.
And then Hank's solo 5 to 7.
And I never got to the rest of the schedule.
I interrupted myself somehow in some way.
Opening tip with Bimbo Couls.
No wonder I never got to that point at 7 o'clock with some Bimbo.
And then we got any K at 730 because we don't have the heat cam.
But we got any K on when actually a lot of you will be awake.
Embroidered night lights.
730 to 10.
God, your breasts are beautiful.
Yes.
Absolutely.
Do fairly.
Cheek water, eat soy milk, and ow.
Looks like the faker rose, guys.
Snows from the funny robots.
Barbara Bush has body bells and eyes full of the rice not loud.
It happens when she relies.
She raised her grin in a cloud.
Barbara Bush has body bells and eyes.
She says,
Hold and grab me.
And she raised four times the exact face.
She controls it.
And takes the bricks to a table.
And the next day, one more voice.
What's like she's carrying an old informant between us, died in high.
Body bells and eyes.
She says,
She's a teacher,
Call up.
And then she's always the rice.
The clock keeps when the white she's taught.
Barbara Bush has body bells and eyes.
She gave us a short push and she's pushed.
Not a bad, she's the ill and bothered bush.
She'll be rich and fat.
And smells just like the mad at sauce.
Not a big hat.
Barbara Bush, we've had the sonist for nine on a bad day with body bells and eyes.
So 46, we haven't played that in a long time.
Last of the stuff we haven't done in a long time, like I said,
Crap, how do you like that, Joyce?
Yeah, a good day without a good day is not a good day anymore.
President Bush, speaking of Crap, faces the nation this week more unpopular than any president on the University of the Unicens, Richard Nixon old tricky Dixins in 1974.
Nixon was beleaguered by the Watergate scandal for a Bush three decades later, if the war in Iraq plus his general incompetence, of course.
With his unpopular troop surge on the table, his high rating matches his job rating matches the worst of his presidency, 33%.
This is what pulls this, ABC or whatever.
33% of Americans of purpose working or fist while 65% disapproved, 2 to 1 negative matching his career low last May.
He's feeling mighty low.
Only three posts were presidents who gone lower.
Jimmy Carter, Nixon and Harry Truman only won his head a higher disapproval rating and that was tricky dick.
And now we got tricky dick chaining.
For Bush, the bad news just starts there.
This may over the unpopular war is dragging him down across the board from his personal ratings with position visa V, the resurgence Democrats.
It's all a remarkable come down for a president who shortly after 9-11 shows a proper rating surred of the highest for any president and polls since 1938.
Today by contrast, 71% of the ABC news watch in post-Aid the government has headed seriously off on the wrong track to loose like tracks, baby, to loose blood track.
The most since budget battles led to a highly unpopular government shutdown in the early 1966.
Bush's war leadership clearly is the prime complaint, 64% called the war a mistake, more than said so about Vietnam during that war.
The intensity of this statement, the sentiment of our harvest only grown.
51% of Americans now strongly disapproved Bush's job performance overall and majority for the first time.
Does 17% strongly approve a 3-1 negative ratio?
Through a partisan lens, 3-4% of Republicans continue to approve of Bush.
Oh, how very sad. I wonder if Chris approves of Bush.
Nope.
But with much diminished vigor, there are only about half as many Republicans who strongly approve 42%
as there are Democrats who strongly disapproved 76% and among two of his core support groups, conservatives and evangelical white Protestants.
Oi!
He's a career lows and overall approval.
Oi is right.
So let's see, Tom Dodd is running and Hillary is running at the Gooplaw from Iowa to always runs at nobody ever heard of.
He's running and Barack is running.
And who are we without?
I'm sure I must let somebody out.
I don't know.
Everybody in their brothers running.
Here's a flight you probably didn't want to be on.
The pilot of a continental airlines flight became ill after takeoff and later was pronounced dead after the plane made an emergency landing.
The 210 passengers on the flight which departed from Houston, Texas were never in danger and the co-pilot landed the plane safely.
The airlines only said the pilots suffered a serious medical problem, continental believes the pilot died of natural causes.
That flight bound for Portia Foyote to Mexico took off from Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport was diverted to McAllen Miller in Houston.
The flight continued in Mexico with a new crew.
Well, they didn't die on the plane but of course if they're going to Mexico there's a good chance they won't come back to lie.
A little more advice from the old grandpa and the old okay.
Don't go on cruise ships number one and don't go to Mexico no matter how you get there number two.
Do not do it.
And speaking of number two that's probably what you'll be doing a lot of time.
I need to one of them, you know cruise ship.
How about a cruise to Mexico?
How's that sound?
No thank you.
Chris can take my trip.
No passo.
I've been on many accrues.
You have?
Not in the past five years but yeah.
And why is that?
My dad's been in the cruise business for almost my life.
Oh!
Boy you are digging a hole so deep that they're never going to find your ass again.
Remember those kids they found under John Wayne Gacy's house?
In the crawl?
Oh yeah.
That's where they're going to find Chris.
He's going to be crawling in space.
Oh I have to get thinned up to fit under their first.
My girlfriend's father.
His girlfriend's father.
His girlfriend's father.
Oh yeah can't wait to meet that bitch.
I mean WDQA and hello.
I have a picture.
WDQA and hello.
Who's that?
Who you're calling?
The nail.
This is he.
This is nail?
Yeah this is a nail.
I want to know.
Do you pay these one of those the quality of the show?
I beg your pardon?
Do you pay these one of those the quality of the show?
Yeah 50 bucks.
Did you get a check?
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Hello this is Peter Graves.
My little daily care isn't so much to ask is it?
Hello.
That's got to be the one you know isn't it?
Top 10.
I love that.
These are weird versions.
I've never discussed that before.
I got other versions of them.
There's a few versions around.
How about the Vestal versions?
What's that all about?
Who are the Vestal versions?
Priestess of the Goddess, Hestia.
And what is the wider shade of pale anyway?
I like it.
It's not like a drug thing to me.
I like vocal hair I'm though.
Conchisted or was good?
I realize it's got like nothing to do with the music today but then again is there any music today?
So if there is I don't hear too much of it.
And then see that's my being old me again you know.
There you go.
I love that song.
What are my all time favorites?
It's a wider shade of pale.
I have no idea what it's all about.
That's because I'm an old funny study.
And the song is older than the Lososla too.
Older than Isch Capibre.
19.
Oh I'm almost 66.
67.
Oh gee going in the wrong direction.
That's me always going in the wrong direction.
And if you get the talk up on this one it will be a real feather in my cap.
You know this.
I know where it is.
I know where it is.
I know where to find it.
Believe me if it's out there I'll find it.
If it's good I'll find it.
Hopefully.
Okay that's enough.
WDQA and hello.
Hey, how are you?
Okay sir.
You were talking about Rocky raisin.
He was my teacher.
I went to Shenandoah back in the like 17.
Wow.
He was a great guy.
He was like one of those artsy farcey kind of teachers.
Yeah you know what I like about him.
He was a science teacher.
He was good.
He's got a center king.
I can't tell you guys learned a lot of things from him.
You know.
I mean you know you know he was alright.
I think it was room 304.
And I'll be down because I was at 305 East Shaw Hall at Michigan State.
How do you like that?
Those great numbers man.
There weren't so many great numbers in my dorm though.
Thank God I probably really got a lot of trouble.
I told you that before.
A lot of ugly kids in my dormitory.
They probably did that on purpose.
Because they thought if we put anybody hot in there that Faggot's going to go crazy and start you know.
Trying to grab onto guys and stuff.
I'll tell you very embarrassing.
I mean nothing actually happened but it's just an admission again in my old age of what a pervert I am.
Okay I'm sitting there at my machine yesterday it would buy.
And a young couple comes in.
If you would have seen this chick you would have gone crazy.
I mean she was just a knockout.
Okay.
Okay.
Her boyfriend was almost as pretty as she was.
Okay.
You catch the drift of this.
I said they were like early 20s.
Huh?
Okay.
Early 20s.
Well you know it's very busy.
It's a Sunday afternoon.
It's very crowded.
I'm sitting there at my machine.
Now I discovered that the two of them are standing almost directly behind me.
And I know I shouldn't say this on the ear and you're going to should stop me at this point.
And the thought crossed my mind.
Again it's only a thought.
You know there's nothing.
There is no law against thinking things.
But yet.
Well no.
Really right.
Your government and action they're working on it.
And I wanted to like reach back and slide my leg.
Be not my leg, my hand.
Between.
I can't say it.
You know what I'm thinking about.
I know what you're thinking.
Right between his legs up to the young.
And I thought I mean the thought for like a half a second.
Not that I would certainly do it unless I wanted to get number one punched my lights out.
And number two dragged off and threw it in the Husqaw.
But it just crossed my mind.
And I thought to myself, man you are a very very preferred bastard.
And I'm very happy about it.
I'm proud of you.
Well I mean is that a normal thought of course?
No, no.
And I was at the best part.
And if you're looking for a letter by both of her knobs and just give them a little twist.
You know it was all a Sunday and I have an insur yesterday by the way.
As I was looking for printer cables maybe that's why I didn't find any.
Yeah.
Because there were just other things to distract me.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean the thought it's just that I don't think that's ever crossed my mind before.
It's just reaching that would have been so easy with standing right behind me.
And that is it turned out whoever was playing next to me, the machine next to me left.
And he sat down there and put a 20 year to in there.
It was playing at that machine.
And I thought, oh gee I hope you went and don't ever leave.
And that's bad.
That is very bad.
You sound like some kind of a prevert to which I would say,
absolutely correct.
That is right.
And very proud of it too by the way.
President Hugo Chavez of Nathuela returned to his weekly radio and TV broadcast yesterday
exterling the ideals of socialism and said go to hell to the US for what he called unacceptable
meddling and Venezuela's affairs.
Go to hell.
Nathuela?
Oh gee.
The National Assembly controlled by the President's political allies expected the final provilist week
to what caused the enabling law and allowing him to pass a series of laws by decree during an 18-18 month period.
On Friday, the US State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said that Chavez's plans on law
causes some concern.
Well, too bad, Tom.
Too bad.
When he said go to hell, push this interview.
When he saw the moron idiot Schmendrick?
I think he Schmendrick.
And when Hugo Chavez calls you a Schmendrick, you are a Schmendrick.
May no mistake about it.
I still waiting for my big email from Joe Bell saying, phenomenal job boys on the ratings man.
You guys are kicking serious big fat nasty ass.
He just got the round.
And when I'm up in Belkittiga, slapping old women with painted lips around the pole.
I listen to the Neal Rogers one or two.
I mean, I listen to the Neal Rogers Aaron balance one or two hours.
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.
He's been working my internship at the ratings in Dianna.
Oh.
Well, I don't want to show you what a big ass said I was to your hand, how?
You're done, you can find somebody good enough to fill my piggy pants?
Are you lazy?
Very no chance I'll have to be coming back.
I try to consider a little greater than a counteract.
If you want to know what I'll say to you from shutting that transmitted the lounge.
Why?
That's easy.
Sure.
Oh, she needs a smile.
I think I'm going to have one.
Oh, she needs a smile.
I'm out of breath.
Oh, she needs a smile.
It don't grow.
I'm out of breath.
I'm out of breath.
I think your own time class only got to the day.
I said my ratings have bottomed out in the day.
Which radio have the remoteies doing the thing in the woods?
And we did.
Oh, she needs just now.
Now we can't get it.
Oh, she needs just now.
Oh, she needs to be the show.
It's all wrong.
I'm out of breath.
I hope you can hold my hand.
You have to find a way something.
Hold me and give me this.
It's him.
Are you going to go fire me?
I just can't get enough of that.
I don't know about you, but I just can't get enough of that.
It's great.
It is great.
It's classic.
101 at 560 WDQ AM.
How about some Coke Classic?
What do you say?
No.
I don't think so.
What is that new one?
Yeah, Coke one.
Coke one.
What is that?
It's got one calorie.
Yeah, so three one calorie.
I guess between the regular and diet or something.
Did they ever try that with Pepsi one?
Memphis police officers observing an attack on anti-bush protesters
but drove away and failed the intervene to activists who run the scene-tooled raw story.
It's pretty raw.
We were down on Beale Street, late on Friday night.
How do you like that?
On Beale Street.
I'm a mad ass hell.
I don't think I think so anymore.
Maybe they needed an after-justice of Beale, do you think?
No.
We were down on Beale Street, late on Friday night, said Barbara Cummings, a peace activist
with a backbone campaign.
Self-destructing described as a grassroots effort to emboldened citizens
and looked at officials to stand up for progressive values.
Cummings, a grandmother from Spring Valley, California, had come to Memphis to attend the
Free Press National Media Reform Conference but believes her own free speech was for
Taylor Wall's attendance.
As the Vietnam report has been filed, they pull these departments spokesmen so they
can't investigate the charge without a report.
The backbone campaign had staged a march down Beale Street, the musical heart of Memphis,
which included individuals representing President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney,
Secretary of State Condom, Pleaser Rise, and former Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld.
But Clyde and Prisoners got our outfits.
Another member accompanied by the marchers while reading a loud list of war crimes allegedly
committed alleged mayas by the Bush administration.
At first Cummings we called, we were very, very well received, people were smiling,
taking pictures and saying, thank you, thanks God.
In the second block we had a veteran in the wheelchair guiding us, I sensed rather than
heard something going on, I couldn't get the mask off at first.
Cummings continued, I saw arms and legs everywhere, some guy came out of a bar and had blinds on us,
he hit two members in the back of the head.
One of the protesters took off his mask and struck back at us as a salience we noted,
then some bouts who came out of a bar and there was a melee.
Finally, pulling off her mask, she said she saw legs and arms flying everywhere,
flying and flailing no doubt.
According to Cummings another demonstrator interviewed by the raw story,
a Memphis police car was parked at the end of the street from which officers
should have been able to see the frantic scene, but Cummings claimed the Memphis police officer
took one look and they just drove away.
Laurie Perdue of Moore's Bill and O'Neill confirmed Cummings account,
what happened to protecting the service she asked?
These officers did not protect or serve, even like a little dessert.
What's your thoughts, what do you think about dessert?
Perdue a former US military information officer and current member of veterans for peace,
acted as a guide during the march since the large mask and restricted vision of the marchers,
while serving in Turkey as an 19 year old military police officer,
Perdue told raw story that she had witnessed Kurdish people fling from the right
when Sodom was saying gas the Kurds, when he dropped that evil gas,
like I did in the shower this morning, and boy it was enjoyable.
Oh, I'm a fire.
I think that's one of my great fantasies would be like to spend an hour of
a day farting in the shower in a real hot steamy shower.
Oh, call that a power shower.
I've carried the memory all my life of women running up to us,
pleading, please help me, she said they met us, turned our cameras off,
and our military did not.
Perdue falls to the US government,
fulfilling the telepublic truth about events that are right both then and now.
According to both activists after the Memphis police officers left,
the scuffle concluded the protesters walked away.
However, a young veteran, a young Iraq war veteran, who obviously been drinking
was very emotional, then confronted the group.
What are you, why are you doing this to our president, the veteran,
asked, you don't understand what we've been through, what we've done?
He then reportedly told the protesters that he harbored doubts about the president's
role in line-loving terror attacks.
What if he did it, the bad ass rhetorically, according to Cummings, kind of like OJ,
what if I did it?
According to Cummings, a long time peace activist who volunteers at military hospitals
for assisted wounded soldiers, but he's still the commander in chief.
We thought we were killing Iraqis to protect you, he said,
right, don't you see Iraqis at every street corner, getting ready to attack your ass?
Oh yeah, come on up, look out!
Cummings added he was crying and into a hearing,
we said we love you and support the troops, we've had many young Iraq veterans who are our friends.
I'm still active duty, don't know what to do, the man told, reportedly told the actor,
Cummings said we tried to hug him, but he pushed us away.
Oh, I had that happen.
In fact, I'm sure that would have happened at Woodbine yesterday, right after the punch in the mouth.
How did I admit that? That was a disgusting thought.
I don't think that's all I want to do.
I don't like that. No, no, no.
Trust me.
We think boy, I sure would like to, but you know, not that specific, you know?
Sure we do.
No, okay.
Well, I'm going to, then I better make up for last time.
This girl, the best biest today, I could tell you for an hour of what I was thinking about doing, right?
If you would have seen this couple, man, it would buy.
You would have been climbing on the machine, just grabbing for anything that you'd get your hands on.
You would have been pulling the handle.
The protesters put their masks back onto resume in their march, but then Cummings recalled another guy,
and he said, I pulled off my mask and he said, I didn't know you were lady.
I see.
By the way, speaking of whatever I was just talking about, perverted and dangerous stuff.
No.
Whatever happened to that thing that clearance was supposed to send me, huh?
That Chris has already, have you had one of those presented to you?
No.
No.
Is that just a fantasy, or are they too embarrassed to send me that?
Because it would be extraordinarily embarrassing to send me something to fill out, like I don't know anything about this business that I've only been in for about 400 years.
Don't you think it would be just a little bit embarrassing?
Well, in this place, see, that's relative turf.
I know how much fines are in the Maxis.
I see.
But I didn't tell you that.
A wrong flight on a wrong airline.
This history is from the last week, but it's just in my pilot.
It deserves, you know, I like traveling, but I don't like the flying part.
In other words, I like when I get there and have a great time.
I don't like all the chaos at the airport.
They're getting on the plane, getting the boarding process.
As the plane rolled down the runway, one passenger was bewildered when a flight attendant welcomed travelers aboard the Milwaukee-Bond flight.
Milwaukee, he thought he was going to New York.
Turns out he had accidentally boarded the wrong flight on the wrong airline.
Schmuck.
And in today's post-9-11 climate, that's the sort of thing that can cause airport security to break out and hives.
The whole thing was a simple human error, so Carol Skoonika, I spoke to person from Midwest Airlines.
This fellow was in a rush, and the employees didn't check his destination thoroughly.
Here's how airline officials described the problem.
The passenger was not identified, was running late for a flight to New York's JFK airport.
He rushed to a Delta ticket counter to check in.
After clearing security, the man screwed over to what he thought was his gate.
Outside the jetway, he handed an employee his boarding pass.
While some airlines use barcode technology to scan the tickets, Midwest does not.
Skoonika said employees visually inspect the tickets.
In this case, they allowed the man who held a Delta ticket to board the plane.
He has a Delta ticket, he gets on a Midwest plane, okay?
Wrong gate, wrong Schmuck, and idiot.
In this case, they allowed the man who held a Delta ticket to get on the plane.
Happy to have made his flight, he took his seat in the deep breath.
Like that.
After the plane pushed away from the gate, the attendant welcomed the passengers to the Milwaukee-Bond flight.
The man sprang out of his seat, he jumped.
Why did he jump?
The pilot turned the plane around return to the gate.
The man disembarked and went running for his New York-Bond flight.
End of story not quite.
The Midwest captain ordered the plane emptied and inspected.
A Broward Sheriff's office, K-I-N team arrived, and found no problems onboard the aircraft.
We checked the man's seat.
Oh, I bet they did.
Welcome.
The laboratories, the overhead bins, the Skoonika said,
we were thinking we'd rather air on a set of caution.
After half an hour, the plane was thirty-four departure arrived in Milwaukee only 45 minutes late.
As for the wayward pass, the man made his Delta flight to New York.
Let's hear it for the wayward pass, and do it.
A moron, man.
A schmuck, a schmender, give it their verboism an idiot.
And you like that.
And this is what happens.
I mean, every time you fly, not every time, but most of the time.
There are always those stragglers.
There are people like me who are professionally early.
You know what I mean?
Compulsive, compulsively early.
I'd rather get there early, sit down, get a newspaper, drink a soda, whatever, and just relax.
As opposed to these other crazy people who are rushing, rushing,
it does one thing to be brushing and another thing to be rushing.
Bushing, rushing, rushing.
113 votes on the pool.
Not too shabby, if you ask me.
Everton Chris is mildly impressed.
I love it.
Who poses a gram?
I'm just going to pretend I didn't even hear that.
I think he's practicing now to be sitting on the other side of the phone.
He wants to be a caller now.
I'll take it slow, you know.
He can only help.
Yeah, it couldn't be, couldn't be any worse.
In fact, today it could be an improvement.
Who poses a gram?
And we had actually one real call today or were not.
Oh, yeah, the guy who was the student of that person.
Squirrel or whatever.
The student of the squirrel?
Who lost his nuts?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The guy who called and said he was the student of that art teacher, whatever, he used to come on here.
Oh, Rocky Raisin.
Rocky Rascal.
What Rocky is squirrel?
Oh, brother.
I'm sorry, I guess Rocky's not with the, he must sleep with the fishes now, huh?
Yeah, his family was, he was a science teacher.
I had like a really different approach to teaching and wanting to kids to have a lot of fun and yadda yadda and whatever.
That was a, I stepped as a guest on my show back in the day.
About a hundred years ago when I used to do it.
And I apologize if there's anybody still alive.
Remember those shows I'm sorry.
Nobody's perfect.
Neo-Con's represents the biggest threat to the human gene for 555.
Nobody even close.
The average American Idol viewer 281.
People who watch poker on TV, 109, uh oh.
The average American Idol contestant 84, myspace.com member 79, shame on you.
The average QMS sports show caller 74.
I hate this pool 66 5.99%.
And the average near Roger show caller 55, which may increase after this hour.
Well, let me tell you something, my proud friend.
Oh, I think I forgot something.
I'm not really sure.
Wonder what is missing.
Hope, easy nothing under my dress.
And the photographs all over the place.
You have to be careful.
I have no common sense in.
Oh, it's just so cheaply made.
I'm freezing busy.
Where's my underwear?
I put a pair.
No, really, I swear.
Hope, free, free, free, oh.
Completely exposed.
Don't think I'm a-oh.
I'm just an idiot.
Where's my underwear?
Something I'm in.
Please help me carry.
Hope, free, free, free, all over the web.
My comeback is dead.
I'm such an idiot.
Yeah, you are giving me hair.
Anybody that was cohabiting with a sleaze bag that Kevin-oh, my god.
Oh, yo, yeah.
Kevin, yo, yo, yo, I'll go away.
What's 16 at 5, 16 at 5, so you can mad dog a two then the power hour between 4 and 5?
How'd that power hour do?
A big number?
No.
In fact, none of the sports.
In fact, I think the Humper.
Where was the breakdown here?
Where was the hour by hour?
There are some parts of the day if you put the two sports stations together.
It's still an embarrassing, embarrassing.
Well, it's just the way it is.
Like, Maddie Bell would tell you, if there was a rapier, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Maddie.
You were an idiot, but not that dumb.
Like, where a rapier once told you, if we just had more sports stations,
we'd bring a lot more people to sports talk radio.
And that's because these are people who really believe that there are as many sports,
and that there are so many people out there like them.
People who idolize OJ and want them to sign their jocks.
Stuff like that.
A program to themselves.
That is precisely correct, sir.
But I heard a rumor during the lunch hours, a matter of fact, not thought of hanging lunch,
but I heard a rumor.
We're number one, Debbie!
And I'm still waiting for that guy to come in here and just pat you on the back so hard your teeth fly out.
Wouldn't that be great?
Should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade?
This is the National CNN poll.
62% no 29% yes.
And he liked that.
Overwhelming support.
This is the government that we got another.
Watch the turn of clock by 50 years.
Let's get prayer back in the schools if we could get the kids just to read the Bible,
you know, like the Muslims do.
Like the Braggheads read that Quran.
Rainwash them real good.
And give them that magic flying carpet.
My rule hot taught, oh brother.
I still think that it was one of the great moments.
I didn't realize it at the time, you know.
At the time, it seemed rather insignificant.
I'm 13 years old.
I got my Mr. Batinsky, my Bar Mitzvah tutor.
My tutor.
I liked that movie, by the way.
That was a good movie.
That was a good movie.
It was an accepted February.
But anyway, he's a, you know, he's told me about the Bible, this, the Bible, that,
the Torah, and he said to me, it's all mulch med.
And I thought, hey, that makes sense to me.
And from that moment on, I realized, this is a biblical scholar.
This is a man who could, he even knew who he had sought Shmendraquist.
Wait till you hear this.
This, this, this, just.
And after yesterday's Washington Post asks the question,
what if it had been President Jeb instead of George Bush?
Oh, talk about a fat, dumb ass idiot.
Today would have marked his sixth state of the Union dress and it might have been his best yet,
theorizes SV dates, Tallahassee Bureau chief for the Palm Beach Post,
and author of Jeb America's next Bush.
Oh, good God.
Oh my God.
That's all I need is more of that.
No more Bush.
Don't have to say anything.
The nation is in great shape.
President Jeb Bush would have reported record tax cuts proponing the economy to greater heights,
a revolutionary school vouchers program for the first time,
granting low-income parents real education choices,
and five years after the victory of Osama bin Laden,
the final 20,000 U.S. troops returning home from Iraq, he continues.
The ads, October Jeb Bush, were eight years as a state-cabber reporter,
and convinced he remains the GOP conservative wing's best hope for a poster-back comeback.
And his own political ambitions burn as brightly as ever, perhaps 2012 or 16,
or why not maybe even 2008, if things break right, he says.
This about is obviously doing way too many drugs.
Magic mushrooms, I believe.
According to date, Jeb Bush doesn't do defeat.
Jeb in W.R. seven years of profit have much in common,
that's for sure they're both major A-holes.
Both are stubborn.
Both of their peer-convents that anything the government does the private sector can do better,
both are enamored of tax cuts for the rich,
and both seem to believe that voters don't have the right to observe the workings of their administration
and should simply trust them to do the right thing.
You know those devious plans he had?
Oh yeah.
However, the two display real differences on issues spanning crisis management,
fiscal policy, foreign policy, and perhaps most important personal style.
You know, although W.R. has got the drunken daughters,
and of course Jeb's got the daughter with a nose problem.
Jeb pays much more attention to detail than his brother,
and his former dog in the company and advancing as a genuiner,
meaning that a Jeb presence here with the past seven years would have been distinct from his brothers
and a future one would be as well.
Why I sure hope I croak before that happens.
Man.
You know something that that should be a good poll to take someday.
One of the positives about dying is that you won't be around to see blank, you know.
Right, the global floods and the great flood.
Hey, better call Noah and get him to work on that ark.
Oh, you might be around to see that.
You think?
Maybe next week.
Right, it could.
In Rochester, we had a chain of appliance tourism was called Noah's Ark.
That'll look like there's a little tribute for you all.
You're watching Stereons out there.
Remember the day back in the day.
See, that's one of the, in fact, there are a lot of cities where nostalgia is really great,
because that's when those cities were great and now they suck like Rochester and Detroit.
I mean Boston's OK now, but it's a shadow of what it used to be.
Boston was great.
We're going to Boston.
I think I've asked you this a hundred times.
No.
And you always say no.
Well, why not?
Get out there and travel to you.
People and do not go to Mexico.
I'm telling you right now.
No.
And you people that are thinking about going to Mexico,
I'm going to come to your house and paddle you with a, I'm going to beat you with a whip.
1122 votes on the pool.
Well, we made our 1100 easy.
In fact, we need to really put on the big, the big press we might have made 12.
But I don't like the pressure.
You know, too much pressure?
Not good.
WDQA, I'm not lying.
Hello.
OK, well, that's one.
That may be even the second best one next to the escrow guy.
WDQA, I'm hello.
I'm Neil.
Thanks for making my call.
Thanks for making your call, sir.
Oh, the lock straps.
I know it's a little bit of a way.
They picked knives, right?
I was looking at the treasures and nothing.
Yeah, pick this.
That sounded like your buddy.
It was.
Oh, then why was the honor so long?
Chris, who is this buddy?
WDQA, I'm hello.
Hello.
Very, very sweet.
Very crazy person.
That's who it is.
Maybe you can display it to Chris during the break while you're beating him over the head with that.
That's right.
WDQA, I'm hello.
I look at to know that he will.
Yes, he will.
He will.
Say that he will.
Chris is in their dreams.
I will say this.
He's real quick on that button more.
He can really move that finger.
That's what Dustin.
QA, I'm hello.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay, I guess that was it.
Out of material.
WDQA, I'm hello.
First time was there in Lone-Dent Baller.
Looking at that picture on your page.
What's up with that?
What's up with what?
When is that balled?
What's that thing?
What's the picture with the fat face?
That's what happened.
Doctor, man.
Oh, man.
Is there any full leg body shots?
I'm sorry.
Thank God.
No, thank you.
What a grotesque out that was.
Yeah, that sounded a little like that, wasn't it?
Okay.
That wasn't him.
I already dropped him, but this thing.
Oh, that's a off-tourist.
It just, it works when it feels like it.
It kind of like some people I know.
They, you know, work when they feel like it.
It's like me.
I should be getting paid extra today.
I'm doing like about three shows for the price of one.
But yes, something to pay is not too bad.
And the sun is breaking through today, and there's not too much snow out there.
It's a 22nd of January.
I'm telling you right now, there is no such thing as global warming.
It's just another one that I'm coming, pinko, a propaganda pieces.
And what about that Elliott Rodriguez, huh?
Trying to get out of it.
That is funny.
Not a funny story.
And the funniest part, of course, is about that line about, well,
he, I didn't do better because he has no ambition.
It lacks ambition.
I keep an eye on him.
I think what he lacks is talent.
If he lacks me.
I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so.
I think he lacks talent.
Well, look at that.
It's minus five.
It's like, it's getting close to maybe 25 or 26.
I don't know.
See, the pluses I know very well, and the conversion between whatever it is,
Fahrenheit and the Celsius.
But when it comes to the minuses, I mean minus one, minus one is...
Fuck, third man.
...because 0 is 32.
It's freezing.
Minus two is 28.
But then after that, I get a little fuzzy and hazy and like that, you know.
And I used to be so angry.
When I was in school, man, I was a genius.
I was a mathematical wizard.
I had 99 algebra three.
Wow, I could not do math.
Algebra and geometry and all that stuff.
Yeah, it's the basic stuff that comes through me.
What about the tree?
Trig, yeah, whatever.
It's just those basic equations, like double digits, adding all the time.
It was all the time they wasted in the school teaching us all that crap.
I know.
Pythagoras, whatever.
Pythagorean theorem.
That is the thing.
That is the thing with B squared equals C squared.
Right.
And who gives a flying crap?
Okay, what Pythagoras?
They would say that it makes your mind work.
He gives you the thing.
Yeah, that's something else that makes my life work, too.
Yeah, just like me, it would buy me yesterday.
Well, I wanted to reach there and lend that young man a hand.
But that's the disgusting thing to say.
I just can't believe I said that.
Although lately, you'll notice I say whatever the hell's on my mind.
Why not?
Why not?
Am I going to like hurt my image?
Am I going to ruin my image as an old pervert fag?
Well, what the hell?
The difference is I'm like, I don't give a crap on anybody else.
Thanks.
See, that's another message for all you punks out there.
Do not live your lives based on what you think other to try to impress other people.
You know what I'm saying?
What do you say?
I'm saying, don't try to live your life according to what you want other people to think.
It's a bunch of crap.
It's a bunch of hog watches, what it is.
So anyway, I'm sitting there with my machine.
Oh, man, you know, something if it looks good, try to grab it.
I mean, think about it.
If you don't actually do it, I'm not suggesting you should actually do it.
Because you're going to want to get a knuckle sandwich, okay, buddy?
And that would be really bad, okay?
Okay.
It would be a knuckle sandwich.
It would by knock me off my good machine.
Actually, it turned out not to be such a good machine, man.
Yesterday, Saturday was okay.
It was fine.
And then yesterday they'd take it back.
They'd give it a take.
They'd give it a take.
It's the old in and out.
They'd give it a lot.
And then they'd take it all back.
And then a little extra thick hand.
You know what's how, there just doesn't seem to be the buzz.
I thought it would be, I mean, you know, that article we had on Friday about all the money
to the slots are pulling in for the state, much more than they anticipated ahead of predictions.
But there doesn't seem to be yet the buzz about it.
You know, I didn't hear too many people talking about it.
Although I do hear some people saying, well, at least it's a breath of fresh air
that we got like real slot machines instead of having to play that bingo crap first.
Joe Bo on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority
Neil Goh.
Oh, Paulie wants to hear him no more.
First, Marlon Brando was the Godfather.
Then Al Pacino was Godfather 2 and 3.
Now, get ready for the ultimate Godfather.
Godfather 4.
Godfather, you must have heard from me these are goons that are coming in the bunma house
with town.
And they're heading to my family.
Maybe you can order a hit or something.
I'm dead by here.
Come here super bad.
Make it feel good.
You get up like a sense machine.
Get him, gotta give it up.
Turn it new.
Get on the good foot.
Make a burger, go sweat.
Ham says.
Pea, pea, pea, pea.
Ow.
Godfather, pardon me.
But you just have done the look like any of the other colly on his.
Colly only, Ramy, only macaroni.
It's gonna be none of that.
The heaven soul food.
And I'm jealous, be fast.
Gotta make it ring on the coast and go for it.
Ow.
The Godfather 4 is starring James Brown.
The Godfather of soul.
He'll make you an offer.
You can't understand.
That's the dead Godfather of soul.
But I tell you one thing.
I'm the only person in the world.
There was not a big James Brown fan.
A great tissue.
I'm just, I'm out of touch.
I'm out of step with the rest of the human race.
And I'm pretty proud of that.
1140 votes on the pool.
Not too bad.
Not too bad.
There's your president by the way with the troops.
The Americans are very, very negative toward this president.
Well, thank God for that.
There's Bill Schneider.
Get a haircut, Bill.
Would you please?
Wait till you hear this.
Now, wasn't it the Bush one that was doing the skydiving and stuff, you know?
Yes.
Yes, it was.
And unfortunately, he made it.
A 68-year-old skydiver apparently suffered a heart attack or a stroke during a weekend jump
and was dead when he reached the ground in Zeffer Hills, the DOA.
DOG.
Dead on the ground.
Johnny Gates was like them, made no effort to deploy his primary parachute as he fell to the ground seven.
Maybe it was a sui side.
His reserve parachute opened his design at 800 feet, but Gates was dead when he touched down.
One would think.
TKH's manager of Skydive City in Zeffer Hills says video shows Gates apparently,
video shows Gates apparently twitching as he fell.
It was twitching.
It was an out of the ordinary movement he said, and ought to have to be performed in German War Kills Gates.
He was a fixture at the airport and made more than 1,000 jumps in 25 years of skydiving.
He was an icon and now he's a dead icon.
How do you like that?
More than 1,000 jumps and then one to many.
1,000 was good, but 1,000 wasn't good.
Not too good.
Tom Hullsack, that's the guy from Iowa.
Tom Hullsack, nobody ever heard of him.
Nobody has any, even he don't know who he is.
And he's running for prison.
And there's Barack Obama, America's next president.
All right, Barack, you go, man.
And then they keep showing these different polls and one shows Hillary's way ahead.
And then they just showed one.
One is John Edwards, who says, oh, that's San Brownback.
He looks just like John Edwards.
San Brownford.
San Brown, yeah, stepping San Brown shirt.
John Edwards, that's another one.
I keep forgetting to mention you want to know why because he's very forgettable.
Boring.
Oh my God, is he weak?
Pathetic.
I don't hear a fact coming over there, do I?
Yes.
Let me reach her back and get it.
It says, Neil on fire and Fuego.
See?
That sounds like...
FAAAMING!
Been listening and grinning and scratching for three and a half hours.
Man, it's good to have Uncle Leo, the real stream of consciousness and Theo,
back and fabric and also under.
What is that?
I don't know.
Well, that's because I'm down to 185.
I got my weight down, baby, and I got a little bit of energy.
Once I get into 170s, I'm going to be so dangerous.
This show is going to be...
Smoking.
You'll see.
You'll see.
That's correct.
In fact, you know, you're...
I'm even more enthusiastic.
I'll think of a step further.
Very nice.
That's right.
Very nice, not just nice.
Well, on fire.
And the reason for that being that I've lost the weight, I'm enthused.
And I got all kinds of crap going on here on this computer over here.
And it's just...
I've put me in a good mood.
I'm doing shows for 600 different people over here, at least two in particular.
I mean, all the other ones listening as well.
You know, I don't want them to think,
well, you're just entertaining all your friends on there.
I'm not...
Well, that's part of it.
Well, speaking of a flying stuff, well, what do you mean?
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
I'm here to entertain, man.
I'm easy.
It's all right.
I'm downloading porn.
Good for you.
I'm thinking about that couple at the Whip-Bind last night.
Oh, brother.
A nine-year-old boy with a history of steaming cars and running away,
sneaked out of a plane bound for Texas, getting caught after a flood in Airport connection.
This is in Lakewood, Washington.
Samadz Booker, sounds Indian to me, man.
And Indians don't say man.
But anyway, apparently, I've obtained a Southwest Airlines boarding card
and made a three-airport security last week, hoping to separate...
Hopping to separate flights,
but letting in San Antonio, Texas, short of his Dallas destination.
The fourth greater remained in juvenile custody in San Antonio.
I've been trying to get his grant to his grand-paw in Dallas for used to live.
The airline said in the statement, a young man approached the ticket counter.
It's the equivalent international airport requesting a boarding pass
and said his mother was already in the boarding area.
The young man's information massed to pay ticket was reservation for the flight.
Based on the information he gave us, he was issued a boarding pass, the airline said.
It was not listed as a child, because he told the agency it was 12 years old.
Maybe it was a 29-year-old guy.
Well, let me ask you.
Can you tell the difference that easily between 9 and 12, I would think you could.
You were 9 and 12?
Yeah, let's think of some of those weird growth illnesses, you know.
Like the kids have sometimes.
They got a weird growth illness.
The airline employees in San Antonio stopped to manage from boarding another flight
when he couldn't explain why he didn't have a boarding pass for that flight.
Said David Herbert, hebert Hoover, spoken for the San Antonio International Airport.
The boy was unhappy after his family moved to Lakewood outside Tacoma.
His illness he began Sunday when he stole a car that was left running out.
When he stole a car that was left running outside of neighbor's house,
only he spotted by police near the interchange of I-5 and state Route 512-30.
Police pursued some oddget speeds of up to 90 miles an hour until he took an exit
and the engine blew after which the car went over a curb and crossed it into a tree.
He refused to come out of the car, so officers broke a window to unlock the door,
and immediately recognized him as a frequent runaway in a car thief.
He was released to his mother, but he ran away again, authority said.
The Pierce County Washington prosecutor filed three charges against Booker R1 Z in juvenile court
all related to the vehicle theft. The charges were sent to San Antonio Tona,
but they weren't sure what the next step would be.
Last month the boy crashed his stolen car before being caught by police in Tacoma.
More recently he was caught in Seattle in the stolen car that had run out of gas.
The mother believes he learned to drive from playing video games on a PlayStation.
Oh my god, some of you kids out there, some of you punks that are playing at PlayStation.
John Wayne knows what kind of ever it behavior they like to be illegal.
What is it? They should be illegal.
What's that PlayStation?
Yeah, everything seems to be good.
Anybody ever got a bad idea from should be illegal.
You're starting to sound a little wacky and they've been devised that anyone ever used to hurt someone else.
Like a pen, a rock, to be able to cars.
Fingers, legal, fingers, chop them up.
I think that's what I would have gotten yesterday, like two fingers in the eye.
I mean, how come such thoughts cross your mind?
I'm not apologizing for it and I'm not really embarrassed about it.
You'd be harder to admit it you can too.
But that wasn't just lust. That was disgusting.
What do you think lust is? People don't think, hey, I just...
It's one thing to sit there and think, boy, there's a hot couple, man.
I sure like to, you know, do it. But that's one thing.
What to actually think of a specific thing like that of reaching back and running my hand up in between his pantaloo.
What kind of a disgusting foul vulgar thing is that?
I wonder if that's going to be on that exam.
I don't think they're going to send it.
Fingers.
And I still don't see that email from Jo Bell.
I was positive.
I see 80 million other emails and I'm very happy to see everyone.
But I don't see any from...
Oh, wait a minute. Here you go. Here's a new one.
Let's see if it's from Old Smokey Jo.
No, it is absolutely not. It's from actually somebody I like.
21 before 2 at 5, 60 WQM are...
Oh God.
So, cannabis are home and even bread.
High falls and feet will not cure on your head.
If the sugarides and you fire,
Shides you eat and your good will see.
It's a legal drug recording tool.
A good old IOC.
Oh, right.
Oh, baby tree.
Coriander tree.
Oh, cannabis is that that's gone to me.
Oh.
Oh, cannabis is that that's gone to me.
Oh, we got to have a hockey game after that.
Game of engines. That was incredible.
Then she can stay for and who are in the play.
How do you like that? Good old Spartans, man.
Good old. So, do you think I care about the Spartans? Of course not.
Well, there's Darryl Sittler.
He was the answer to that.
That's a tribute course that I touched.
Smokey Jo to heaven.
You think I don't know my maple leaf trivia mister?
Ten points among game against the Boston Bruins.
Hero Sittler, five goals.
Who are you, kid? Mr. Darryl.
That a beautiful thing.
You would know Hero Sittler from Adolf Hitler.
Who?
Shame on you. Exactly.
There's another.
Well, there you go.
That was the answer to somebody on the Myspace.
He's an expert.
We're going to test you with some trivia.
Ask me something difficult, okay?
What kind of a bow tie was fostered who were wearing in 1932
in the first game of Maple Leaf Guards?
Ask me something like that.
What color was the bow tie, Schmuck?
Not the who scored the most points.
Give me a break.
Lastly, I don't know if you saw this story.
A white F-450, a light green Volkswagen Golf,
and an electric blue Corvette.
Oh.
These vehicles were not lined up at an auto-shrower,
but they were pulled out of a murky canal in Southwest Bowered
last week as part of an operation by BSO and the National Insurance
Crime Bureau.
That's BS.
Nearly two dozen BS.
Oh.
Drivers spent today under water in a canal long Griffin Road
between US-27 and Bajavel, Bata Venture Boulevard,
and Western Baja Venture.
The drivers pulled up 31 vehicles, 27 of which have been previously
reported stolen according to BS.
Oh.
I like that.
The other four were still being traced.
14 of the 27 stolen cars were found with the keys in the ignition.
None of the vehicles was connected to any of the crimes
according to the Sheriff's Office.
Among the recovered vehicles, see if you want any of these.
A 64-4-T bird.
A 77-try-omp.
Oh, they're nice.
A 77-catal-ack.
And several newer model cars, trucks, SUVs, and quantity BS.
Oh.
The vast majority of cars dumped in canals are insurance fraud cases,
BS, spokesman Elliott Cohen said.
Most of the time, it's people that don't want to pay their car pay,
but it's no more.
It's a Joseph Castro.
A start-up.
A special agent with the National Insurance Crime Bureau.
Then they file a false police report cleaning their car with stolen.
But the recovery operations conserve another purpose, finding missing people.
It made the average fund the body of 18-year-old Matthew Sterling in the front seat of his red 4-F-150.
Said Merge in the canal not too far from the Canal the investigators searched Wednesday.
Sterling had been missing for six months.
Jesus.
His family has made it their mission out of other families,
find lost ones in canals and other waterways.
He had been missing for six months, and he was in a canal, the car.
Did.
Remember the movie Christine?
I'm sure you do.
We've talked about that 80 million times.
We said, a funky, uh, a good kid who was also in, um, the rest to kill.
The kid with the glasses.
Oh, I forget.
But John Stockwell was in Christine.
Oh, boy, I like that movie a lot.
Mostly him.
Uh, they teamed up the family, teamed up with Dinora Perry, founder of Missing Children International Ministries,
and organization that uses volunteers to look for missing children.
On January 6th, the volunteer groups conducted a search along the C-11 South New River Canal spanning a mile and a half west of
the Bona Venter Boulevard, volunteers located six cars, information that was later shared with the BS.
Oh, said Allison McManisterlings, aunt, aunt.
I don't say aunt.
I just can't do it.
You know, I know it's very ghost to say aunt, but I actually can't say aunt.
You could, uh, you know, meet it halfway.
And, uh, and see, uh, the grandest is stood on the bank of the canal when his toe-press pulled up car after car,
since he was pleased that the BS was finally doing the right thing.
It's about time he said, I'm rather making sure that no one is in those cars.
Cohen said the agency's operation was not planning to respond to the findings by the McManister group.
This was originally planned for November, he said, but was postponed due to the death of Deputy Brian Tefford.
He was gunned out on November after a traffic stop in Tamarack.
I have no idea what that has to do with this, but nevertheless, Cohen said BS, so will continue working with the National Insurance Crime Bureau to organize similar operations throughout the route,
to create some merged cars.
Isn't that amazing?
All these people that go fishing in the canals, are just pulled up at a 64-T bird.
Hey, that'd be something for a chain.
It would be something.
