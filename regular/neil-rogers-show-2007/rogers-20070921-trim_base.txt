Your person is program really reproduced without the express information of WQA.
Who's that idiot running the board in there?
Crank that level up so somebody in the world can hear it you idiot.
Oh brother.
Go in there and get that kid a spank in me.
Start up again.
Rx-x.
Crank it up.
Open it up.
Oh.
B1.
WQA.
The level up.
The neil Roger show.
I want to be radio with me.
That's what I would like to do.
I'm radio with you.
Just a little bit.
And then, right.
I hear some chunks back there that goes on a record.
77775.
Neil.
Crank it.
Or pound five.
Bank it on your 18.
You idiot.
And for your fair wireless phone.
Right.
The opinion expressed by Neil.
His guess for his colleagues.
Do not breath.
We love it though.
We love it.
We love it.
We love it.
We love it.
We love it.
We love it.
Now the neil Roger show.
Who's there?
I'm 560 WQA.
What's that in again?
He was here last night.
He's not there now.
Correct.
Oh.
Don't be blame in good old rock.
It's Friday.
You first, dude.
I'll be Roy Sittin.
I'll be Roy Falker.
And even I sound this way because I have my nose.
Inside.
Oh, J's asked.
What you do, Danny?
What you do, Roy?
I think you did that microphone down a little bit lower than I should.
You got it.
Oh, J's the theme of the director's old to chronic John's niffit.
Is he eating so much he'd be better and do with his right people?
If he calls me for John.
You be here to folks like me and my life-lady girlfriend have an indurable finish for doing the damn endearing thing with Spongebob's John.
Like my clothing person, a friend of J.
I took the second.
Could you move over a little bit, OJ?
I don't want, but you're not supposed to quit your own.
You're eating with me.
Don't let that get out of there.
Get out of there.
I'm gonna wear a proper bar here.
Don't worry about your hands.
I kind of want-
I don't worry about OJ disease.
You're still complaining at this station.
I don't think I ever played that before in my life.
Nope.
Do you?
Nope.
Well, how about that?
I just like the last part where he says to find out more about OJ disease,
seek employment at this station, which I think is perfecto.
Nice going, chicken egg.
Well, don't let me forget next week I got to send him a couple of bucks.
If I have it.
If I have it.
Today I'm picking up that car.
How do you like that, boys and girls?
Beautiful 2007 Pontiac Solstice.
I guess to say, Solstice convertible would be redundant because they all are.
Alright.
What was that?
Chris sneezing.
Chris sneezing, I could hear it all the way through the glass.
He's been here for a hundred hours.
Oh, that's right yesterday was a marathon day and what happened?
Besides the Canes won.
Oh, they had a big victory yesterday.
Are we excited about that on this show?
No.
Who cares?
Screw them.
My left at 12.20 in the morning.
I got home at one.
Took a shower.
Went to sleep.
We got up again at seven.
So you worked from 10 in the morning.
I'm five.
I was here at about 8.50 yesterday.
We're not talking about when you got there.
You're not going to start getting paid for when you arrive in the building.
Is there a show up at five in the morning?
No, I do get paid when I get here.
Yeah.
You get paid for when you come in the building?
Yeah.
Of course.
Well, whoever heard of that, you're like, you punch a time clock or some crap like that?
No, I have to fly out of time.
That sounds like mean you're a labor to me.
I go in there and punch clearance right in the mouth.
I kick him in the chin and punch him in the mouth.
Like who was here maybe?
Always not there.
Oh, that's right.
He had that big hurray cane game yesterday.
Is he involved in that in any way?
He's part of the four hour pregame and he does like in game scoreboards.
So what does that have to do with the not being there today?
What do you get over work yesterday?
I guess he was going to come in a little bit later.
Oh, well poor baby.
Clarence can't come in because he had to work four whole extra out one.
He was there anyway.
So what difference is it made?
He doesn't do squat.
Can't even make the damn schedule out right.
But don't start making with clearance.
Okay, because I'm going to read a good mood.
I'm picking up my new car today and we got the ratings coming out in a couple minutes.
And then we can go into a deep, deep depression.
What do you think?
I already asked George yesterday.
What is Chris think?
If you can't think.
What do you want to have to?
Well, after yesterday's traumatic experience.
Well, what do you want to know?
What do you think the numbers you're going to be like today?
I don't want to know.
The roof of the roof.
It's going to be stoop-handous.
Oh, wonderful.
He's a funny one.
Yeah.
Not just for the $1480 votes.
You realize we could have had $1,500.
Yeah, well this is what I pushed.
Yeah, if you would have just pushed it, schmuck.
The best burgers come or came from.
Fudruckers, $300.
Fudruckers wins hands down your pantaloonies.
The interesting part about that is most of them are closed down now.
What did you say there's only one?
There's three in the state of Florida.
No, but there's only one here.
Yeah, down in Miami, one in Wellington and one in Orlando.
Wow.
Charger 220.
So those two were like way ahead of everybody else.
Wendy's 118, steak and shake 114.
That was a good race for turd.
In and out, 100.
I don't understand that.
I mean, how can that meant that many people in our audience have
even ever heard of much less gone and eat at in and out.
Maybe they're thinking of something else.
I think it is.
That's what I was thinking.
White castle 99.
Royal castle 94.
Side by each.
Rudy 67.
That's good.
I'm glad to see Rudy's did so well.
The reservely so was a late addition and they went zooming up there and then kind of slowed down a little bit.
Been a long time since there was any Rudy's.
I think Rudy's was gone before we even left IOD.
Yep.
Wasn't it?
Yep.
Well.
And some east market, that's gone.
What else used to be over there?
Anything that we liked?
What on 79th Street?
Yeah.
Flores?
Flores?
That's right.
Very good.
See?
I'll let's morph toward this game but then against the Wazrugis.
It was on this game.
Checker's slash rallies 43.
Burger King 42.
Hard E36.
Crystal 28.
Mickey D's 26 from McDonald's.
Well.
Red Croc doesn't care because he's still dead.
And they've sold 80 trillion of those little burgers.
Sonic 24, Jacket of Box 23.
Jacks Hamburgers 21.
Flanagan's 18.
Big boy 18.
What a burger 16.
What a burger.
Five guys 12.
Fat Burger 12.
I'm not a burger eater 10.
Vick and Irv's 10.
Vick and Irv's is excellent but then again, you know, when you're dealing with this software,
then we'll let go of him.
Duffy's tabern 8.
Burger Queen 7.
Burger Chef 7.
I'm a vegetarian 4.
And Hot Now, dead last with 3.
Hot Now.
Not Hot Now, not ever.
There was one out there on the Baby Road extension.
You know where I'm talking about?
Out there via him.
There's a Eliza Brothers big boy or some kind of big boy on there.
I mean, I know the Baby Road extension.
Yeah.
Well, that's where it is.
All right.
By 3.95.
Where it was?
Where it was.
That's where it was right out there.
And that's in the woods right close by a big boy.
I'm sure big boy must still be there, although I don't even know if I ever ate in that place.
And that one.
The big boy used to have that great strawberry that the cherry pie or whatever it was.
Was it strawberry pie?
I don't know.
Cherry pie sounds good.
No, strawberry pie.
Hmm.
Either one.
It was really good.
That was the 4 yesterday on the burgers and Brandon's all excited about that.
We got 14 out of 80 votes.
Nice work there.
Today's full.
Now, let's just start with the numbers.
Who's bringing them in?
If clearance isn't there.
And why wouldn't he be there on them?
I wouldn't be there on the more than 10.
Why?
I believe he's supposed to get in there.
Maybe he's working on it right now in the numbers too.
Maybe he's in there with Fat As, Joey, Joe, and they're like, you know, remember the last time they didn't like it?
I don't want to bring him in.
Which I don't blame.
I don't remember the big delay we had.
Oh, yeah.
I got to take him down to Joe first to get his approval and pass it by Boopus and all this other crap, you know.
Just bring us the numbers and quit the farting around.
I'm going to play fart sounds for hours.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, that'll teach you a little weasel.
I can go see if he's here.
No, if you want.
Yeah, I mean, nice idea.
Let's see if we're going to get the numbers.
I don't want to tease it for like two hours and then, oh, well, you know, they wouldn't give us the numbers.
I have a backpack.
Because I have a feeling it's going to be.
I mean, I hope I'm wrong, you know, because this should be a big day.
But if I had caps, I would play that.
I don't have that.
7 out of 13 votes so far on our poll today.
I think we'll make 1,000 even though it's not the best.
It's one of Charlie B's.
In fact, it's the only one of Charlie B's that I would even consider.
Well, he's Charlie.
You're really desperate, you know.
Here's a guy that, you know, we gave him a big hand and he got all swelled up there.
Oh, I'm the poll guy.
I'm the new Roger show on the guy comes up with all these great poll ideas.
All right, Josh isn't here yet.
Yeah, but I just actually saw Joe Bella as a leaving the studio.
Yes, he's going to go grab the numbers from Tom Callacucci or something.
Tom Callacucci, Gucci.
Yeah, I think he's a power 96 dude.
Tom Callacucci, Gucci.
Oh, that's great.
He's going to grab him.
Fantastic, Charlie Joe.
Make sure you don't trip over himself in a hallway.
I'm sure he'll be.
That would be really bad.
Oh, 750 vote.
I think the college cops who teased the group ball guy at UF would make President Abu
Greb Dumb Schmidt proud, 127 president.
Abu Greb Dumb Schmidt proud, 127.
In second place, they did the right thing, 114.
That makes me just want to go on strike.
I just want to go and sit in the corner and just impale myself with sharp objects.
They did the right thing, 114.
Do you believe that?
Okay, why not?
They're coupling cop wannabes who flank the police exam 102.
I mean, there's so many silly choices on here.
I added one.
Showed the world again yet democracy is dead in Florida, 89.
We're itching to play cops and robbers with their new toy tasers, 82.
Our bunch of trigger-happy ghoul in the 70 would look more stylish and get stopped up around 52.
Should have used guns, 50.
Oh, that nice.
We want to sugar rush from too many crispy creams to one, one who won.
That's probably the right answer.
Should have their own show for and our two right in the head, even for wackin' on four.
That's what you said should have their own show?
Absolutely, I'd watch it.
They just run around teasing people.
Absolutely.
Yeah, the taser.
The one in the 80's, bro, don't tease me, bro.
The equality.
Ow, ow.
That was special.
You got to know that.
I think it was great.
I think it was really great.
Nice goin' at him, or whatever your name was, from Western.
And Mike Mayo wrote a really wishy-walk sheet wimpy piece about a misty tomb,
which he didn't really say anything, huh?
Well, they were carried away, but he didn't say anything.
It was like all over the place.
Maybe one day somebody who writes a column in South Florida will develop the balls to actually write something,
and that says, yeah, hold your breath.
I know it's unlikely, but that says something.
So we got 721 on there, and Chris knows we'll get to 1000 votes easy the day.
No 14 number of the day.
Oh, well.
It could be damn sure about that.
So we got all this stuff about Hillary.
The advocate, once I know, is Hillary a daik.
And then that the book, from two years ago, the truth about Hillary,
which for the first time, we got a whole bunch of interesting information here,
some sleazy stuff about Bill and Hillary in here.
But in the meantime, so what's the story, Chris?
He's a fanized Jolly Joe.
Joe is gonna be bringing him into this.
He's gonna be bringing him in.
Oh, and wait till you see the look on his fat face.
Oh, what the hell is that?
Who's the best out of this new logic?
42562 AM.
They exports later.
No person has ever lived in this.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh god.
No.
The stuff made me out of control by corporate goals who have no head, no nation.
Trainers get every pass to run like Carl Rowe, who leaked out information on playing your loyalty to his men through some value.
You follow them into hell.
Well, they're famous, you're under their high, high, high, high, high.
Oh, they're famous, if you never fall in, if they're home in the show.
Well, the mind sees a battle for that ain't no war.
It's an old new patient.
No, the babies in half for Christ for the human right.
And then they play a special special by you don't be proud of that friend and all the life.
The Christmas soldiers from hell are all who dare to pay their lives.
That's when we are flared away alive.
They're paid in lies.
You never keep running, you never keep running.
You're alive, you're holding on.
They got you no life, they're in high control.
They paid in lies, you're an average in high old, baby, house, no kiddos.
You're fairy.
Twenty-teen, well, I love that.
I'm going to play that all day.
Now, what's the story?
As bad as Johnny Joe is he in there with the numbers now or what?
No.
What do you say it like that?
Not yet.
Not yet, it's 18 after 10 for Jesus' body.
I don't know how they're going to be.
Why?
Pageants.
I'll tell you what, I'm going to sit back in the chair and just going to dummy up until he comes in there with those damn numbers for Christ's sake.
Remember back in the day once upon a time when Miguel was there for example.
Yeah.
And on ratings day we knew whatever time, like let's say it was 11 o'clock in the morning and like at 11.03, 11.04, he'd be in there and you'd be shoving the stuff into the machine and my machine would be cranking it.
I'd have the taxes in the, you know, we could spend some wax.
Spend some wax my ass.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, I've been playing that right when the zero opens in Johnny Joe.
As a matter of fact, considering all of this current events lately, what's going on in Louisiana, I think that would be very rare.
Yeah, that would be a good one to play.
I'm thinking sure, sure.
Time for some reparations and rehabilitation and palpitation and,
crapitation.
Restitution.
Yeah.
What are we going to do about this fat guy?
That's why, you know, by the time he waddles over there, it'll be midnight already.
Should we have somebody a little more spry to be able to run around the building of this?
I don't think of spry, I don't think of Johnny Joe.
He might surprise you.
Yeah, like a, a lot of things I would think of when I think of the Humper, but spry would not be one of them, you know.
I wouldn't see, I wouldn't think in doing like a tinkerbell hip hop or on a,
I like that word.
We don't get to use it as much as we have.
Yeah.
I'm just, I'm by my time already.
I'm already by 19.
I'm by my tongue and I've got to stir about his hill.
We had dyke and stuff like that, but a whole pile of it would explain those things.
Yeah.
He gives me spiel keys, man.
I just, I don't, I don't see what it is, but then again, look at the poll and number two on the poll is they,
cops did the right thing.
They, they keystone cops make believe cops at UF.
Mm-hmm.
Did the right thing?
Uh-huh.
They tasted the right thing.
He was, he looked really dangerous.
Oh, you have a gun?
No.
A knife?
No.
A weapon of any kind?
No, both of them.
Look, he looked dangerous.
Oh.
Was he threatening anybody?
No.
No.
But never to life.
He spoke too long and they didn't like what he was saying, and so therefore, mm-hmm.
Oh.
Like hell.
Oh.
Oh.
You have to do this, I do.
I do.
You got more experience.
I have much to do right.
Mm-hmm.
Lately.
Yeah.
A lot of pain is just about that.
That's my whole life is turned to pain.
Oh, it's always good what other people can relate to.
You really come in and never what?
If I was Chris, I'd be out there and there we go.
Here's Josh.
Here is the bad Joe in there now or what?
Josh.
Oh, Josh.
Oh, Josh.
Everybody's looked so.
Nobody's even looked.
Here we go.
Many people.
Nobody has looked yet.
Yeah.
I don't see anything.
Oh, I'd be the first one to see it.
If they were to look, they wouldn't have brought it in there.
We'd have been going on with this.
We could have gone all the way to about 145 with this routine.
Like when they coming in already.
Are you sending me stuff or are you looking?
Don't peek.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
What?
I mean, there's impatient and then there's impatient.
What?
You're supposed to go to get them in early.
Over at the machine, he handed them to me.
I just turned, I put it in the machine.
I'm not looking at nothing.
What does that mean?
That you're getting them right now.
Oh.
I didn't look at anything.
Oh.
So nobody can do this.
Why would you surprise Christ?
Because you're so impatient.
Like I'm going to sit here and look at them before I stick them in the facts machine.
I have no idea.
What are you doing?
I can't say 100 miles away.
I'm going to tell your chomping at the bill.
Okay, well I'm waiting for a machine to start cranking.
And I had a good machine it would by yesterday.
It was there for an hour, one over a grand.
It's not too bad.
I don't want to rub anybody's nose in it.
Maybe the quarter-slot guy.
Take a look at that.
He's probably in Vegas.
Good place for him.
Maybe they'll turn loose those tigers.
They'd lie in with tigers, whatever they are.
Miguel says he's got the numbers if we need them.
I'm sure he does.
Okay.
Here's something happening on my fax machine, man.
It's a good machine.
Actually, it's not a good machine.
These things, well it's only one page.
Many 18 plus radio mambi, which means old Julio's got the adiresness trend, old Julio.
Although they were never in last time but they went way up 5.7 share for radio mambi.
And WCMQFAMA number two, again, same as last time.
No change.
This is June July and Augusto.
WIOD third overall.
This is the whole week.
4.4 share in man.
W big went up quite a bit.
4.2.
Wow.
Paul and Ron.
They're working almost as many hours as you did yesterday.
Chris only they're doing it every day.
Oh well.
You got to hand it to them how they can make that material stretch out over such a short period, long period of time.
Waxi, a 3.3 overall in man.
And you know, what do you...
Oh, look at that.
Did we have a precipitous drop or what?
Absolutely.
Wow.
From a 3.0 in a last trend to a 2.5.
What did I tell you?
I knew this was going to be like the end of the world.
It is.
You ought to cue that out the end of the world.
Who did that?
Wow.
Who?
End of the world and we know it.
I already know it George.
The end of the world.
Skeeter Davis.
Who?
Wasn't that who did it?
What a brain I got.
We edged out I and Z though.
We edged out scared America they had a 2.4 in man.
Which they shouldn't even be a factor to be honest with it.
So cross the street.
Let's see.
They go up with the streets.
You know, they dropped a little bit too.
Oh, Skeeter Davis.
Why are we killing ourselves?
I guess this is going to be a long time.
We got lots of choices for Ed to the win.
Go!
The dreams are fine.
Well, this is really a really hard pill to swallow.
I'll tell you that.
Forcipetist drop as we're dropping off the face of the globe.
And Fanace Jolly Joe is waddling around to building him and clearing it.
Oh, we're really doing it boy.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
You keep telling.
Don't play those bark sounds.
We're going to show him who's boss.
Oh, oh, oh.
What a joke.
Okay, mornings, baby.
Now we're starting to get to the meat of the matter.
Don't forget I want persons 25.52 so I can extrapolate the men 25.54.
Because we don't have any women at least.
Not according to the arbitrage.
When we do our own survey, we got a bunch of women alleged.
An audio mom B.
Look at that.
Old Julios have down the no park at Alde d'Iri.
6.3 for men 18 plus in the morning.
Big 5.4.
They went way up to.
They were second, but they're share went way up.
Radio Amorno speaking English.
So it's all nobody who speaks English got any diaries.
Radio hot hot 105 5.0.
They went way up.
It's all as they say in the trade.
Spos and Sprows.
CNQ FAMA 4.0.
So the top five stations except for big are all ethnic.
W.I.D went way up 2.90 with 3.90 in the morning and men.
Power 3.40 with 3.60.
They went up marginally.
L.A.X.C.
3.70 with 3.3.
And of course that says,
no, would that be said to the kid?
Yeah, sure with.
Dropped.
When Joe was no with their.
Of course, let's see.
I.N.Z.3.0.
Where the hell are we?
Are we even on this next page?
No.
Wow, the Kenny and Bull morning show.
Sure, well, I can't play that with a f***ing.
Yeah, one of those.
With a blast.
What would you say?
Oh, but at least you know something?
Are you there?
Am I talking?
Where's the.
Oh, there's something to be said for consistency.
They had a 1.9 and made June in July in the previous trend.
Kenny and Bull and I stayed right there with a 1.9 in this soap.
Boy, did that show suck or what?
Of June.
That was just a killer.
A killer from the nilr.
A 1.9.
Boy, that is really deadly.
Let's see in midday, 10 to 3.
Oh, we're not even on the first page now.
Oh, my God.
Woo!
CMQFN number 162,
a radio mom B60,
IOD third, 5.9.
That's Russian at Holcroft.
We dropped from, and look at that.
We tied with Waxi midday.
Tied.
They had a 3.3.
We had a 3.3.
Yeah, only we had a slightly bigger cum.
So that's, you know, that's a 3.
How do you like that?
Well, that's 10 to 3.
Yeah.
Food's a 2 to 3 hour.
A 3.3.
That is absolutely what, what did I tell you?
I knew this.
There was no doubt in my mind.
You could feel it.
You could smell it.
You could see it.
You could sense it.
It's everywhere.
It's in the air.
It's like a bad, bad egg fart.
Hey, check your email, by the way.
For what?
During the break.
Something good?
I didn't say that.
We'll find out.
What biggest name?
The best talent.
You know, his mail log is 4.256.
QAM.
The fourth leader.
Since Jesus was an infant.
And you put Joe Bell on air on a, hello, Neil.
The break star is a, hello, Neil.
I'm a, well, Joe Bell.
And I'm answering him on the intercom.
But the intercom doesn't work.
It's like everything else now.
The dump button, the intercom.
Everything is falling apart.
So you weren't hearing me when I was responding.
Is that the deal?
Half the time we were, half the time we weren't.
And then, half the time, because I was doing it on, on Mike.
Yeah.
So, he would take it off the air.
Well, I would take you off the air.
But what?
I would took you off the air, but then we couldn't hear anything.
Also, so.
What are you talking about?
We're in the middle of a radio show.
And here's the, what was his, uh, skill?
What do you want to tell me?
That he sent you an email with, uh, something.
Number.
Some number, something.
What 80 million numbers and about Bruce Beasley
congratulate everybody on a wonderful, uh, second trend.
What is he talking about?
We stuck the joyd out.
We sucked wind.
Of course, across the street, they had a one in June, July and August
in the month of, and according to this, I don't, I don't understand
what this means.
I don't, I don't, there's so many numbers and so many pages
and so much crap here.
And I'm in the middle of the radio show.
Look, I'm supposed to extrapolate all this
in the middle of trying to do a show.
This man is clueless, clueless, clueless.
Jesus, God Almighty.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
Look, I'm supposed to print out 100 pages and like digest it and figure out
I can't even make heads of tails of what that whole thing is.
And Bruce Beasley sends a message, congratulations to all the
Beasley stations for a wonderful job and a wonderful job on what?
6 a.m. to midnight, persons 12 plus,
taxi, a 0.7 in June, July and August.
According to this, like they fell off the face of the earth.
I guess that's why it's not important that we do well, but that they do badly.
And I just go and Joel, you idiot.
I'm still looking for Q.A.M.
I don't even see Q.A.M.
I mean, I printed out a bunch of pages here.
Here we are.
June, July and August.
What is this?
This is persons 12 plus, a 1.5 share.
Now that's something that'd be pretty excited about.
I'd be sending out, man, most of the whole world about that.
Look at this.
We did a 1.5 boys and girls and across the street they did a...
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't understand any of it, do you?
I mean, I'm just looking at the regular screen.
I don't even know what you're looking at, so.
Well, as much as X trends, overview report,
it's got 80 billion numbers and you can't make out heads...
Oh, persons 25, 54, this might be interesting.
I don't know.
I didn't print out enough pages because I don't...
I didn't have enough stacked...
Facts paper stacked in there.
I didn't have enough stacked paper.
Facts in there, yeah.
I don't know.
He's got all kinds of crap.
Like I'm supposed to be able to do that.
Like, well, I'm sitting here like...
Like, I'm not doing anything.
Well, can the middle of pretending to do a radio show for Christ's...
You goofball, you fat ass, you cypilled it.
You destroyed us.
You're butchered us.
And now you guys are running around,
slapping each other, running back.
Good job!
What do I tell you?
That would be their reaction.
Great job.
I mean, is there something I'm missing here?
I mean, take a look at that 10-3 word.
Not even on the damn first page.
Not even on the first freaking page.
And George is saying, well, that's 10-3.
You're getting as bad as he is.
Yeah.
We're tied with the waxy and mid-if for ninth.
In man 18 plus.
Yeah, that's not good.
I didn't say what.
But we're not going to be tied.
I said death now.
I mean, test it.
Death now.
He's going.
Hello, now.
Showbale.
Showbale.
So, he didn't say anything to you.
Just check my email.
Did he sent you some email with some more numbers or something today?
I got news for you.
If anybody who could make this stuff out,
who could figure this out,
would have to be Einstein's twin brother.
Okay?
The X-Trans overview report.
And it's the winner and Scott...
I don't think you're supposed to be saying that either.
What?
So stop.
I'm not supposed to be saying that.
Yeah.
That's the second time I've dumped you.
So stop.
Why is that?
All right.
Let's go into a big explanation and then I'll dump that.
So in other words, this is like...
Yeah.
How about you stop saying the source? How's that?
I understand what you're saying.
All right.
Maybe it's x-rated.
Maybe.
It's pornographic to me.
Maybe it's porn.
Yeah.
Let's start doing that.
We'll get a number with it.
That's when I would say that porn sure is special.
You talk about a show stopper.
See, this intercom doesn't work.
I can't tell you how many times I've tried.
I tried to explain that to Joe too.
We're not set up.
We're not really set up for that.
We kind of have to go through a whole big deal
and it still doesn't really work out the way that it's supposed to.
It's just...
I mean, you don't hear anything over the intercom.
See, here's the high rate that I should launch into.
I'm going to show off them like I'm going to say something.
No, no. Here's the high rate that I could launch into for what it's worth.
The studios don't do the things that we would like the studios to do.
They never did.
And no amount of complaining, begging, whining.
But once upon a time, this intercom worked.
Once upon a time.
Now, I'm going to give you an demonstration.
I'm shutting off the mic and then I'll say something.
It's never worked, right?
If you ever were under the impression that it ever did.
I'll be here.
I heard something.
I said, not here this.
You know how the...
Probably you've got a crank down so low you can't hear it.
You know the part where you're not supposed to go on the air.
Yeah.
That's the part that never works.
You always go on the air.
You're not supposed to.
So no, the intercom goes down the air.
It's not supposed to.
I thought that was only when I didn't hold it down for a long time.
Well, that's the theory.
Why are you starting up?
You know, how many years have we been doing this?
I don't remember.
Have any problem if they do it in a way that anybody can deal with.
And this man has come in there and single-handedly turned my life upside down
and the show upside down, which is appropriate.
I think it's...
I think it's...
Projects finally.
That's what he's been doing for almost two years now.
Turn everybody's life upside down.
You know, can you hear me?
Joe Bell.
Yeah, I can hear you, Joe.
What do you want?
What do you want, Joe?
What do you want?
What are you trying to prove?
This is again typical for our business.
Let's make up a story.
Every station finds a story.
We're number one in pigmies under three feet tall.
We're number one in people who've ever heard a word of English.
We're number one in something.
Number one in guys who tapped their toe in the teardrum.
Stuff like that.
I mean, if you're going to try to peddle me a story based off of this,
I want to puke.
And you would agree.
Yeah.
If you could peddle a story, I'd offer three three and in the morning a one nine
and a three two in the afternoon and men.
Talk about the vanishing audience and across the street that even though, you know,
overall, that's because they had that one gigantic month in there.
When that disappears, they're going to let me off the air.
Then you're going to make the transmitter glow.
Maybe glow, but not glow.
Nice going, Joe.
You suck too.
I mean, I can go back during this next break and print out some more of this fabulous stuff.
But it's just, I only wish you could see it.
I'm glad I can't.
And of course, I had to go on my Adobe thing there and crank it up so that the print wasn't so
miniscule that nobody could read it with a Mount Palemar telescope.
Ordinarily, the numbers come in.
I read them good, bad, or indifferent.
I give you all the stations.
How's this one doing?
How's that one?
And that's the way we do it.
But oh no, we've got jolly Joe in there now.
And jolly Joe is faxing me.
He's emailing me crap from, I don't even know what the hell it is.
From another universe.
I got all my pages all jumbled up here and all this Kakarai.
It's unbelievable to me.
Let's see, the professor says number one in Guy.
Yeah, we're number one in Guy's nickname to Professor.
Very good, Professor.
Wow.
Good point.
I knew that.
There's something we're number one in.
We're number one in Guy's name, Charlie B, who sent us polls.
We're number one in Guy's name, Brandon, who sent us burger polls.
Right?
Yes.
Right.
Yes.
See?
CC, senior, senedita.
I got, I just got a mess here now.
Person's 25 to 54.
I'm just going to read numbers.
I'm going to fix his fan ass and believe me, a team of surgeons couldn't do that.
But I'll give it my best.
Person's 25 to 54.
And the morning, radio on more.
This is all Julios, baby.
Nobody who speaks English got any diaries in August.
In August though, everybody else was on vacation except for old Julios.
And young Julio, 25 to 54, radio on more my ass.
And 8.2 shared the number one.
Radio on more.
Hot 105, 7.3.
Sposed in Shadows.
Ethnic says all that came in August.
Big 5.8.
And the morning, and of course, our morning show.
I mean, how many pages would I have to get before I find that?
About 30, man.
The Kenny and Bo Morning abortion, which was another joble bell creation, by the way.
Oh, it's just temporary.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Waxy, that went down to a 2-2.
Nice going, Sid the kid.
Go back to New York.
Okay, see if I'll let I miss out.
QAM, 1-0 to a 1-4.
See, we're making a little progress.
There are 1.4 in person's 25 to 54, which means in men's 25 to 54, they had about a 2-8.
Are you impressed or what?
Nope.
I'm depressed.
I'm ready to blow my brains out.
Thanks to Jolly Joe.
New York, can you hear me?
Joe Val.
New York, can you hear me?
And he didn't hear anything.
I was standing in response.
None of it came through.
He heard it once or twice, but.
And so why didn't he tell me whatever he was going to tell me?
And now you're fixing me black pages.
That wasn't pretty useful.
Well, that's what I got.
Well, let me see if my tone was dead.
One moment, please.
I just as received you, page 12, page 600, page, whatever.
I'm going to print out some more of this, what I can't say during me.
Why is that?
Oh, it's because.
Just because.
How's that secret?
Don't say it.
The biggest name.
The best out of all.
I know.
4.560.
I'm the sports leader.
Stop.
I'm the biggest name.
Stop.
Back to the black pages, please.
I think you're easily dead.
You're not workers.
Stop.
I'm sorry.
Stop.
I'm sorry, save.
Stop.
I'm the sports leader.
Stop.
New York.
Stop.
Now.
Where the mother wants to go to hang from trees and play banjo.
You got some who own a station on.
Newfangled raiding old.
Now I's North.
Caroline goes.
Rolly's a big city, you know.
And that's where the beesleaves had to go for jolly, Riley Jones.
A new GM.
He'll do what he can.
Shake your hand like a friend.
Then quickly walk away.
They had joes.
Go to 560 with raiding in the toilet mold to get those.
Blaming sportful moes and order and control.
Absolutely.
And so, jolly, Rolly, Joe, a bugger and in the loathe let's moat.
Go and here's what blows.
It's going to be his own show.
I'll make a big change.
And read a rage.
It's worse on the same.
He hasn't done a thing.
For what goes on the air at two.
Joe don't have a stinkin' clue.
About a four.
Not that essentially blows sportful radio.
The GM.
Oh, 560.
Jolly, Rolly, Joe.
Wow.
I can't make kids or tales of these things that I'm not supposed to talk about.
And the stuff I am supposed to talk about, I'm getting nothing but blind pages.
And I tell you to stop and they keep coming.
Okay.
You keep telling me to stop.
Let me explain what happened on this end.
I handed a stack of papers.
I put them in the machine and I pressed send.
And then I was handed another stack of papers.
I put them in the machine and pressed send.
I think that's it.
That's all that happened.
I have it.
The last stack of papers.
They didn't print out.
They came through my blank page.
And there's nothing to stop.
They came through blank.
Okay, let me say again.
There's nothing for me to stop doing on this end.
I stopped it 40 minutes ago.
I didn't do anything more than I, you know, or less.
No kids, surely.
Well, no kids, no kids, no kids, no kids.
So, Christmas fall.
And I'd love to know, as opposed to sending me 4,000 pages of manure here that I can't see
if through that.
Nobody in the...
I've only been doing this for 100 years and I still can't figure out what this is all about.
And listen to that.
You hear that?
The machine is cranking up another blank page.
That's what's going to come through there.
I've made your life on it.
Right now.
But Fat Ass Jolly Joe enjoys his life on it.
Why didn't Facts No Blinks is?
Another blank page.
Good.
Another blank page, folks.
See, this is supposed to be...
I guess we're going to turn this into a comedy because it's so pathetic.
Okay.
So, yeah, that's what they're trying to do.
Might as well laugh because you don't want to cry.
Not on your head.
Wow.
Ow, ow, ow.
I want to be like that kid.
I guess what I want to do looking at these numbers.
Persons 25 to 54 or 6 a.m. to midnight.
Okay.
I mean, I'd love to know how I could read this.
I have looked at all these years.
I've been doing...
Examining the ratings and reporting of money here in Yadi Yadi Yadi.
QAM.
June, July and August.
Persons 25 to 54.
2.0.
That means men about a four share.
That's pathetic.
Although these other numbers don't make any sense either.
I don't know what these numbers are.
Oh, that's for the whole station.
2.0.
So, that's up from a 1.6.
Okay.
And a 1.9 in the spring.
Didn't we do good in the spring?
I don't know.
We did good sometime years ago before Johnny Joe came along.
I don't know.
And Bruce Beasley sends a memo.
Oh, congratulations to all the Beasley stations.
Wonderful second track.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Sounds like Reverend Jones now.
Wonderful show, Neil.
Like, right?
Yep.
I think it's the same person.
I think that is Bruce Beasley.
How would it explain to us?
What?
I said that would explain to us.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure would.
See, I am mailing it in there.
The guy who talks about the numbers.
All I talk about is numbers and you're mailing it.
I am mailing it in because I'm just going to put a stamp on this Canadian No Less.
And I'm going to just walk out of here.
What is this man thinking about?
Why doesn't he tell me something?
Why doesn't he write me something?
If there's a point that he wants to make instead of setting me 4,000 pages
and believe me, I stopped on this other machine long ago.
Your fact, either your fast machine is dead or one of mine is.
Okay.
The last several pages that came through were blank.
Okay, I don't just believe you.
I just didn't do it.
I'm going to be reading this.
Including the 25 of 54.
Now, persons 25 54 you must have it there.
Right.
I said, okay, that is men 1810 to 3.
Well, I didn't get that.
That's what didn't come out.
When we got to midday, when we got to what I cared about, then it stopped printing out.
On the person 25 54.
Yeah, midday.
10 to 3.
What do you got?
One moment please.
Come on, you can do it.
I know that.
Let's let George do it, okay?
And then the guy can call you at home and say, you're mailing it in, obviously.
Everybody's numbers, numbers on the pole, numbers on the ratings, numbers, numbers, numbers.
10 to 3 from the top.
Yes.
WFLC, a 6-6.
Aha, the coast.
Oh, one.
God.
The coast.
By your other favorite radio station, WLYF.
Oh, life.
One to 6-1.
Then from what?
What they have?
A 6-1.
Oh.
A more.
Oh my God.
Radio Amoria.
Big 5-1.
Hot.
4-6.
CMQ-41.
Y-1039.
I-O-D-37.
Yeah.
Turn to the page.
E-D-R-36.
Kiss.
3-3.
Love.
3-1.
Tied with magic.
3-1.
Yeah.
Radio Ritmo, RTO.
Is that written?
Yes.
2-6.
Tied with power.
2-6.
W-M-I-B-2-5.
R-M-A-2-4.
Turn to the page.
Wax-E-2-2.
Tied with Q-A-M-2-2.
17th.
Time for 17th.
Shall I go on?
It means in men we had a 4-something.
Like about a 4-3 or a 4-4?
2554.
You can kiss that bonus money.
Good buy, miss.
Yeah, it's a kiss right now.
It's kissed off.
And I didn't predict this.
Then I'd take it this year.
Yeah, you did.
I knew it.
There was no doubt in my mind.
You can tell it when you've been doing this a long time.
You see it on the internet, on our website.
You see it on everything.
Walgit Blink.
Again.
August must have been like dropping off the face of the globe.
Because in 2554 we had a 2-9, I think, in the Elans trend.
And like I told you, we were dropping off a really solid May and a rock solid.
A rock solid.
And hanging on to a horrendous nightmarish June.
It will disappear when the summer book comes out next month.
But even so.
Oh, Neil.
I don't know what to tell you, Neil.
Oh.
Well, I mean, you would think that the fact that he sent me all the time.
There was some saving grace in it.
You know what I mean?
There was something to salvage there.
Well, maybe he'll send you an email explaining that.
Then, well, wouldn't that make sense in the first place?
If you want to tell me something, say it.
Say something in plain English.
Or when I say, you're okay.
I'm going to interpret it here.
I'll go wake him up.
I mean, what are we talking about here, Jolly Joe?
My God.
Waxy Titus in Persons 2554 and midday.
In Augusto.
And that's, so what's his name?
That's what's his name?
Sergio Banderis, whatever name is that name?
They do it in the Sadanos.
Jorge Sadano.
Look at that.
Persons 12 plus they had a .7 in the last train.
.7.
Zero .7 across the street.
And they're singing at the same.
The bottom line is that, you know, those months there's nothing going on anyway
beside the Marlins.
Anybody care about the Marlins?
No.
They stink.
They're like 21 games under.
Then they lose again last night.
Five or one?
No, they won't.
They said they won a game last night.
Wow, only 20 games.
Oh, against the mats.
That's right.
I think I swept by the braves.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Well, I've got 50,000 pages of swan.
Very concerned about why nothing is happening with that other fangs machine.
Facts me as something now, like not a rating sheet.
Well, I guess it's not a rating sheet over here.
Yeah, this just facts me one page from your machine, man.
Cover that sheet of it.
And then I'll, maybe I'll fatch your page.
How's that?
Sounds great.
We'll be facking it back home.
Sounds almost sexual to me.
Which I haven't even gotten to, is how we had died here.
I got a whole power, really interesting stuff here.
We wasted the whole first hour, damn it.
Because fat ass, jolly, jolly.
Neil, joebell.
You haven't got how you had been.
No, no, we didn't waste it.
We spent it.
We killed it.
We put you down.
Oh, I'm so upset about it.
Not.
822 on the full.
There's another number for you for that jackass.
Oh, you're mailing it in.
You know something?
I might as well mail it in.
We got Joe Rose in the morning, by the way, for those who haven't heard about it.
Joe Rose is back on his station, the big dog, the wild man, the wild child.
I got what it screams loud and does a lot of spots in his good guy.
Joe Rose is back on QAM, 7 to 10 in the morning.
The reason I'm doing that is because he gets to know, nobody would know it.
Unless they already listened.
Nobody would know.
But Johnny Joe, you know, he and Bruce Beasley, we're going to be the best sports station in history.
They have destroyed us.
We are dead.
We surrender.
I'm dying on the hands.
10, 156 at 560 WQAM.
Let's see if there's anything on this page before I do the spot.
Good.
Yeah, there is.
So, evidently, it has something new with the transmission there.
I guess I don't know.
I'm not fishing with the transmission.
So, you could go ahead and send me the right, but I don't want them.
I don't want them.
Okay.
I don't want them.
I don't want to smell them.
I don't want to touch them.
I don't want to be near them.
The biggest names, the best talent.
How are all of them?
And you're holding for Miami Dolphins football.
The AMA's Haslicks.
Sports radio, 560 WQAM.
Oh, wow.
Miami.
Corn Lutterdale.
This station stands for nothing.
Hey kids, Saturday mornings right after Pee Weermann don't miss the tiny terror of television dog.
Today we're talking about parents who dump us at Grandma's house.
And I'm sick of it.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
It's the Junior Morton Downey Show.
So, Granny, where those cookies you promised me, huh?
Well, I'm right here.
I didn't have a home.
Oh, she didn't have time for my cookies.
Look how lame excuses that.
But you had plenty of time to dye your hair blue, didn't you?
Huh?
Blue!
This challenge, he's in the dealer.
He's spoiled, right?
Now Morton, as your father, I think you should apologize to your grandma.
Oh, now get a lot of this Pablo and Puking liberal whip.
Zippet, dad, zip it.
You want to man here?
You want to be here?
You want me here?
Well, well, well.
He's the temperate tantrum dog show host, you'll want to spank.
And don't try and tell me I'm too old to be sucking on my pacifier.
I'll suck on it as long as I want, because this is America.
And tell him for some solution, don't be calming flat.
I'll suck it as much as I want.
Yes, he really sucks.
What?
Please, Junior Morton Downey.
Oh, look at that.
MIT's doing the rest of it after allegedly walking into a bottle of Boston's Logan Air Force with a fake bomb.
Well, what a rocket scientist.
So does free.
So you're facking me all this crap from clearance with these extrapolations.
And look at that.
The morning, actually, this is my fault.
I asked for this.
What do you mean by that?
I said, hey, do we have those, you know, those trendy breakfast things?
We had a 2.6 in the men over on the station from a 2.7 in July.
Bottom line is we are suck.
Mornings went from a 1.5 in July to a 2.8.
And of course, they're gone, Kenny and Boat.
Midday, we went from a 4.7 in July to a 2.5 in August, mostly George.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
You suck.
3 to 7.
2.1 in July.
4.0 in the afternoon.
Oh, my God.
Now, where's the stuff for a cross-street?
Because they're always sending that.
Do we have the waxy breakdowns?
Come on, clearance.
What?
I thought I was it.
What?
Isn't it?
No, this is all QAM.
There's no WG.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
You're right.
It's got the comparative.
Excuse me.
I didn't look good deep enough.
Well, if you saw the pile of manure I've got, it's in here.
You could smell it all the way down there.
Oh, and August, that's what they're excited about.
It's not important that we have big numbers, but that dual fineberg has small numbers.
August, they fell apart.
August, overall, in many teen plus, QAM, a 2.6 in Waxi, a 1.5.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Joel.
You're fairy.
Mornings, QAM, a 2.8.
Waxi, a 1.4.
The only problem that is 1.4 in the morning, that was said to the kid, I guess.
Well, they hate you, Sid.
They're not ready for that.
I'm not just New York crap in the morning.
They're never ready for it.
Mid days, we had a 2.5, but they had a 1.4.
Not important that you did great in that month, or as they did, a horrendous.
They suck.
Afternoons, we had a 4.
They had a 2.1, August.
Now you feel a little bit better?
Seven in Midnight, we had a 2.1.
That's the Marlins, and they had a 0.5, Kevin Rogers.
It's the wrong Rogers.
Feel good.
How do you like that?
And then there's all this other stuff.
Person is 2554.
Let's see how we did in midday.
I haven't even seen this yet.
Oh, my God, from a 3.5 in July to a 1.7 in August, a disaster.
But the good news is they went from a 3.6 in July to a 0.8 in midday.
That's Jorge Zedano.
And in the mornings, one 1 said, the kid, man, you put the 2 stations together, you still have a good number.
That's the bottom line.
But that's why they're celebrating.
Oh, and Bruce Beasley sends an email, a message, a letter from Garcia saying,
great job, all the way around.
Oh, wonderful, strong second to ride.
I wouldn't wish these numbers on Hining Manouche, on Mike Disney.
I wouldn't wish these numbers on Buddy Bud Pax and anybody.
Oh, my God, I've got Ajud and now I thought this was going to be a testing day in other ways, but this is...
Yeah, it's testing.
What do we do now?
And this is a rationale is that they fell apart across the street in the summertime.
And we have the dolphins now.
We have the big voice on there, the John F.A.J. Jr. voice.
More sports, the games, the bull crap, the, you know, the Jock Strant.
Wow, this is...
And seriously, if you could see them, and I didn't print them all out,
if I did, I just don't, I've only got one case of Fax paper.
If you could see the 80 trillion pages of this other stuff that I'm not supposed to talk about, whatever it is.
And it's just, it's like a heads-your-tales thing.
I mean, like try to figure it out.
I don't know what that all it is.
I guess if I sat down if I had time, it wasn't pretending to be doing a radio show,
maybe I could figure it out.
God.
But anyway, we stuck in a stuck worst.
There you go, that's a good way to do it.
Yeah, that's basically what the story is here.
We stuck, they stuck part of it.
Larry Jack has died, didn't he?
Because he disappeared, he isn't ready anymore, comms in the herald.
And just when I thought I had that herald problem,
straight now with their obnoxious website,
it did the same thing to me again this morning, I had a type in there.
And what's your password if you, if you was,
gave us the information less than 40 years ago,
give it to us again, you know.
And so I type in the so, and Larry Jack has to have a calm for days and weeks.
And what's he going to write about now?
Now that his voice across the street fell off the face of the globe.
Well, we got Joe LaRose in the morning, seven to ten.
Nobody knows about him, but we got Joe LaRose the big dog.
And Bruce Beasley writes,
it's great job, guy, no wonder.
That's why this is going on, what's going on?
Oh, I really got that Bruce Beasley's a buffalo, you know.
The nation's largest game, let's be a news magazine.
I'm sure they're talking about the advocate in this roster, a story,
but it doesn't mention the advocate for some bizarre reason,
which is long straight away from reporting on
gay and lesbians in the closet in Congress who vote against gay rights.
Has a question for Senator Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Daily News,
an interview with the magazine's News and Featured Editor,
Sean Kennedy, to be published next week, the editor asks,
how do you respond to the occasional rumor that you're a lesbian?
People say a lot of things about me,
so I really don't pay any attention to it, swillery remarked.
It's not true, but it's something that I have no control over.
People will say what they want to say.
Dike.
Clinton has been chased by tabloid rumors of her sexuality for years,
none with credible evidence.
Some fostered by conservatives, including the much-blind,
the truth about Hillary, which I got a wild story about that
in my pile next, if we have time to get to it in between all these numbers.
The New York Times Company is about.com,
even includes an entry as Hillary Clinton, the lesbian.
Gaydar Sabi Kennedy told Daily News he's convinced she's not.
I 100% believe she's a straight heterosexual woman, he said.
The ice princess.
Maybe she's just too cold for anything that moves.
Possible.
And in slight, this is an old article,
but I had to look it up after reading that thing right there.
June 22nd, 2005, and it's about that book,
The Truth About Hillary.
I think I better do the break, because once I get started on this,
you're going to want to hear you're going to be hanging on the air seat.
I'm already hanging.
Are you hanging?
About the edge of a rope.
And you do understand that he, that ass-jolly Joe,
he never followed up by sending me like any kind of an email that said anything.
Well, what are they so excited about?
Because we suck, and they suck even worse across the street.
Therefore, it's okay.
It's not important that you succeed, but that your enemies fail.
Because we'll do anything to hurt Joel Feinberg.
Oh, bunch of overgrown children in the sandbox
with their balls and their jocks straps, and that's what we're in the middle of.
Joe Rose is on by the way, and the morning,
he's back on QAM.
Seven to 10 AM.
846 votes on our pool.
I think the college cops who taser the football guy, the goofball guy, UF.
See how I said, football.
The goofball guy would make present Abu Ghraib Dhammishmat proud.
146.
See, Charlie, you're trying to get too creative here.
That is going to take me an hour just to read the pool after all this other fall.
It's been going on.
Yeah, make it concise.
Get to the point, Charlie B.
They did the right thing, 132.
That makes me sicker than these numbers.
Our cop wannabe is who flanked the police exam, 122.
Show the world yet again, democracy is dead in Florida, 101.
We're reaching to play cops and robbers with the new toy tasers, 100.
Don't taser me, bro.
Don't taser me.
That's what he said, don't taser me.
All right.
God.
There are a bunch of trigger-happy goons, 85.
Should have used gun, 64.
Would look more stylish than a Gestapo Brown, 60.
We're on a sugar rush from too many crispy creams, 21.
Should have their own show, 8.
And are too wracked in the head for even Wacken Hut.
Solamente, see if they.
What's the biggest name?
The best talent.
You know his new budget.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.
The sports leader.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
It's a mad dog.
Yeah, a mad bitch.
Oh, right.
Sport Radio 560 QAM.
The sports leader.
I love eating nuts.
Oh, boys and girls.
Jolly Joe Santa Claus Bell here.
And getting Christmas for you all here round.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
I'm here to tell you all about the inflatable Joyce Nudu Doll.
Oh, hold it in life-like skin and authentic model picture.
The Joyce Nudu Doll.
Come with a story that holds where you get past the bar.
You can practice and play until you get it right.
But keep in mind, your only license to practice within the floor walls of a designated
room.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
The Joyce Nudu Doll comes with its own nest of beeslead.
Made of 100% real shredded dollar bills that they have stolen.
The beeslead worms are slimy, but fun creatures that breed rocks.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
The Joyce Nudu Doll.
Good, Christy Fun for any Christian family of Manson Family Values.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Ordears today.
Or the measly, measly sum of only two, aways and boars.
Maybe we'll send you one.
Oh, oh, oh.
When we get around to it.
Oh, oh, oh.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I'm Hathena at 560WQM.
Here's a very uplifting fact.
It says average shows get average ratings high, Neil.
Long time, long time.
The Neil Rogers show will ever enjoy those high ratings again.
Your hands have been tied.
Your freedom of speech has been compromised to the extent that all the funny contents
been removed.
Absolutely correct, sir.
You're doing the best you can.
I'm sure, and I still think you're the best amp for hours on AM Radio Ever.
Thank you for all the great eat past years of very funny stuff.
But the show isn't funny anymore, and I think a lot of oil fans have given up.
Love you, tons.
Slick.
How do you like that?
It sounds to me like it's from PD Lenny.
Sure.
Or Joel Feinberg.
Or Joel Feinberg or both.
Maybe they're both sitting together over lunch.
Over brunch.
But whatever.
You know something?
I'll take the money.
The one part of it is correct.
My hands.
Our hands have been tied.
And then, of course, most recently, within the last couple of days, an email from Clarence.
No more fart sounds.
Do me a favor.
Get rid of the fart sounds.
And, you know, we got it up to the fart sounds.
Screw you, Clarence.
Drop dead.
And Johnny Jobelle never did follow it up with any kind of email explaining what it is that he's also
you've worked about.
I guess because you got a pat on the back from Bruce Beasley.
Oh, good job there, Johnny Jobelle.
Talk about the blind leading the blind.
My God.
But you know something?
We just do the best you can, like the fact sure.
That's all.
No, we'll do this.
And we can't even play that one bit.
Can't even play it.
You know what I'm talking about?
No.
Far, seven, seven.
I say, can't play it one.
We can't play almost anything.
But we shouldn't.
We can't even play that.
Why?
Because, oh, well, you know, she wants to see me.
You want to sue us.
And we're good.
Yeah, the story was she never even heard it or heard of it.
Right.
That's right.
She never even heard the bitch.
She wasn't threatening us to anybody.
But they just decided, well, you know, we don't want to get a choice all upset.
No.
This company has brought it as much business being in the broadcasting business as I have,
going to Mount Sinai today, putting on a pair of rubber gloves and becoming a proctologist.
Right.
A woman was arrested by a state police at Logan International Airport in Boston today after she was found with a fake bomb.
Una bomba.
How do you say fake?
Make believe.
I don't know.
Because I'm going to make believe speak.
No.
Una bomba.
Make believe.
Star Simpson, 19, had a computer circuit board wiring and a putty that was later determined to be play-doh.
And play if you were in plain view over a black hood and sweatshirt you was wearing.
Since state police are a major Scott Pear, the commanding officer with the airport.
And maybe that's Scott Paray, as in like Michael Paray, who is a bad actor in a lot of bad movies.
Like Eddie and the Cruisers.
Oh, yeah.
Not in a lot of bad movies.
Just in a couple of bad movies.
And then we never saw him.
No, no.
I think all of them were bad.
Yeah.
After Massachusetts Port Authority official notified state police about 8 a.m. stupors and troopers
tracked Simpson down outside terminal C where the arrested her later determined the device
was a fake.
She's extremely lucky.
She followed the instructions of the or deadly force would have been used Paray told the AP.
She's lucky to be in a cell as opposed to the morgue.
Wow.
There you go.
Simpson is an MIT sophomore from Hawaii.
And she was wandering to Logan with a fake bomb.
A computer circuit board wiring and putty that was there determined to be Play-Doh.
I guess she was lonely or bored or bored.
Yeah.
What she wanted her four seconds of fame.
Star Simpson.
Well, speaking of star Simpson, what about OJ?
We haven't heard about OJ today.
I know nothing new about OJ.
Well, that's because you're not watching the local channels.
Well, like what?
What do you mean like what?
Like they're camped out on his front lawn.
What?
What do you want?
Doing what?
Doing what the media surface performers do.
Circusing.
Trent, they got his girlfriend on camera for five seconds last night.
Christy.
Yeah.
Christy Prody.
Oh my god.
Christy Prody.
I can have another one with wild drug scenes at that house again, are we?
But that's it.
He's like nowhere to be found.
But they're camped out there anyway.
Well, who cares?
No, not me.
Anyway, Blake Wilson wrote two years ago, plus slate.
How nasty is the truth about Hillary?
Edward Client's the new biography of the former first lady.
Let's just say that Monica Lewinsky appears on page one.
Groping Bill Clinton's crotch at the rope line outside of cocktail reception for his 50th birthday.
Client, who used to edit The New York Times magazine and now churns out books on the Kennedys,
includes Todd Rehillary Tidbits that he gathered and interviews with most anonymous sources,
ranging from Hillary's first boyfriend to high-ranking White House staffers.
Clinton's spokesman, Philip Reinsfield Reuters, this is a book full of blatant and vicious fabrications
contrived by someone who writes trash for cash.
Want to see what all the fuss is about?
Here's slate's handy guy to the muck that Klein raked in.
And as a whole, I'm going to read them all.
Bill and Hillary in the Budwar.
Page is 91 and 92.
Dolly Kyle Browning, who says she was Bill Clinton's longtime mistress, tells find that Bill asked
you to pray for Hillary to get pregnant.
He and Hillary never had much of a sexual relationship, she explains.
Also, Bill had a low sperm count, and he and Hillary were going to a fertility specialist
in California they'd been trying for quite a while without any success.
Page is 91.
An unnamed source tells Klein that after might have heavy drinking at a Bermuda Resort Bill bragged,
I'm going back to my cottage to rape my wife.
A source says he joined the Clintons for breakfast the next day when we get there he tells Klein,
the place looks like World War III.
There are pillows and busted up furnaces all over the place.
Page 91.
Klein sources search that Bill and Hillary was pregnant by reading the newspaper.
Hillary hasn't been feeling well recently Bill told him.
She went to the doctor and the doctor called a press conference and lo and behold,
I'm holding the Arkansas Gazette reading that my wife is pregnant.
Do you know what, and night that happened, Bill continued was in Bermuda and you were there, he said.
Page 70.
Klein reports that Bill was already a veteran womanizer when he and Hillary met at EAR law school.
Bill's pattern, one of his classmates, tells Klein was seduction and betrayal.
The latter seemed to come as an exiled to him as the former.
He would do anything as long as he got what he wanted from people.
Page 213.
Klein alleges that Clinton recently had in the fair with a divorced woman in early 40s who lived in Chapacquan, New York.
Klein says Clinton would spend the night at her house while a secret service set parked in the driveway.
Kind of like the Godfather.
Page 99.
Member Santino.
Little Rock private investigator Ivan Duda.
Duda, Duda, Duda tells Klein that Hillary called him after Bill was defeated in the second governor's race.
According to Duda, she said, I want you to get rid of all these bitches he's seeing.
I want you to give me the names and addresses and phone numbers and we can get them under control.
Page 110.
Klein writes that Hillary and her deputy chief of staff, Evelyn Lieberman, allowed Bill to keep a number of mistresses on the White House staff.
Klein repeats the characteristically sketchy claim of a high level White House staffer who tells him that the assumption among the women in the White House was that Bill took one staffer on political trips and that she stayed with him in his hotel room.
Page 22.
Michael Galster from Arkansas Prison Con tractor route social connections of the Clinton's tell us Klein that when he considered blowing the whistle on a crooked scheme that implicated Bill, Vince Foster came into intimidate him.
You know what your noncooperation means as far as the states renewing your orthopedic contract, don't you, Mike?
According to Galster was accepted as fact that Hillary and Vince were sleeping together.
Page 49 and 52, Jim McGoyen, Goyam, Hillary's first boyfriend tells Klein that when he crossed her she gave him a bloody nose.
Later when he plowed her with some well-aimed thrones in a snowball fight she attacked him.
She got pretty angry and came after me punching and hitting me in the chest and face.
Next day she broke up with him, Jim became a high school guidance counselor.
Page 168 and I am a source close to Daniel Patrick Moynihan tells Klein that when Hillary met the incumbent senator to discuss her bid for a seat, things went so badly that Moynihan left the room.
During the meeting the source says Liz Moynihan told Hillary the reason you're not doing well in New York is because Jews don't like you.
How do you like that?
Huh, we knew that though didn't we?
Yeah.
Page 175, Klein got his hands on a confidential fundraising plant for Hillary's Senate campaign that was drafted early in 1999.
She and her staff set out to raise $25 million in a hard money and planned to raise more than two-thirds of the money from out of state.
Page 169, Klein's gossipy source also tells him that Liz Moynihan and Hillary is said Hillary is duplicitous, she would say or do anything that would forward to her ambitions.
She can look you straight to the eye and lie and sort of not know she's lying.
Lying isn't sufficient word, it's distortion, distorting the truth that fit the case.
Page is 221 and 2, Klein asserts that when a group of women came to us, Senator Hillary is support the child care bill. She next the idea.
It's not going to fly Hillary supposedly told them, I'm not going to spend my political capital on something that's doomed before it starts.
The leader of the group tells Klein, I think Hillary's ambition simply got the better of her and that she'll do anything to get the White House.
Page is 238 and 9, Hillary kept her own 2008 prospects in mind throughout the Carrie Edwards campaign.
Think of that famous line of her from New Hampshire of 92 at anonymous Democratic political tells Klein, she said she campaigned until the last dog dies.
Well the dogs were still alive and barking when she stopped campaigning for John Kerry.
Page is 62 and 3. A college classmate of Hillary tells Klein the notion of a woman being a lesbian was fascinating to Hillary, but she was much more interested in lesbianism as a political statement than a sexual practice.
Hillary talked about it a lot, read lesbian literature, and embraced it as a revolutionary concept.
Page 220. An anonymous doctor who had knowledge of such matters tells Klein that Hillary has been both talks to the hilt.
Page is 24 and 5. Hillary's friends tell Klein that she hates the way she looks.
Klein writes, as the young woman Hillary had felt so hopelessly unattractive, she didn't bother to shave her legs and underarm her and deliberately dressed badly so she wouldn't have to compete with more attractive women in the contest she couldn't possibly win.
Page 84. Dolly Kyle Browning on Hillary when she arrived in Arkansas to help with the 1974 congressional race, you should have seen her, no you should have smelled her.
Page 25. A physician who had observed Hillary a close court inspectulates that her lumpy legs and bad figure may be the result of chronic lymphedema, circulatory system disorder that may have been caused by an obstetrical infectious suspected contracted after her pregnancy with Chelsea.
Page 105. An anonymous White House official tells Klein that Hillary's office pulled strings to get Monica a job as a White House intern as a favor for a major fundraiser Walter K.
Every summer we would put 500 kids and jobs on paid interns at the White House, not the government agencies, official said, at least 50 then came to big donors, it wasn't a big deal.
Page is 136 and 7. Hillary claimed to remember a living history that she first went to truth about Bill and Monica that he admitted the affair to the grand jury.
Klein asserts that she must have known earlier because she commissioned Robert Schwum to write a speech for Bill that admitted the truth.
Klein then says she scrapped the speech.
And Page 106, Klein reports that Monica and Bill were able to begin their affair during the 1995 federal government shutdown because of short staff how they couldn't keep an eye on him.
During this time of White House source tells Klein Bill Clinton was wandering around the White House unchecked normally when Hillary's people were there, the president wasn't allowed to wander.
How do you like that? Now do you like for a better or worse now?
Say the biggest name of the sum.
Best out of 10 is Neil Rogers, 42569 AM.
And the fourth leader, Holy Cow, Aaron's coming.
All right.
Where are we going to read?
That Osama married Sadat.
An Elvis lived in his heart and the picked wood lives in France.
Every time I checked out my groceries, you always made my day.
Look Hillary adopted an alien baby and there's a bad boy who lives in a cave.
So good five weeks they will do when the headlines say this all how.
The only way I will pay for is showing you the doubt.
No stradamas spent by us and for a boy I'm going to miss Anger too.
So now where can I read all the future lines without the weekly world news?
Oh I don't know what it is about now.
Why little voices or their big noses, who feeds hats, titles, meckles, I don't know they just rub me the wrong way.
And I send the tis a lips and every speech of love regifts its in the news.
Hillary hates Jews.
Yes.
New week hatred for the whole dust and people's monstrel.
Six in the news.
Oh boy.
Hillary hates Jews.
You won't catch her like an amonora.
No.
God she must have a wonderful aura.
One she speaks I want to cry.
She could use a good rap by its in the news.
Oh boy.
Hillary hates Jews.
Let's take a look at that line up today.
The award winning line up on WQM or once upon a time we used to have an audience out there.
We used to kick some big fat pimpley marginal ass and now it's a whole new.
You know that whole routine he went through there in the middle of the show while I'm on the air trying to talk on the intercom.
That tells you right there what he knows about this business, about the show, about life.
Fan asked Johnny Joe, you're close first of a friend.
But you know damn well that someone that building right now they're sitting in a room saying,
oh well look at August that was mostly George.
You know Neil's not almost at all in August.
George really is dumb.
But anybody else looking out we did not have a spectacular with it.
These are two radio stations that are playing with each other.
That's what I mean and themselves.
That's what I'm talking about.
They are absolutely in a dream world.
They're in La La land.
And once in a while like across the street last month they get a big, a bunch of wire diaries.
They get a big number.
Oh look at this work kicking ass.
Look at that.
And then all of a sudden the next month it's like they got ones and something with, oh yeah like at night.
Joel.
And of course we like I said it's not important that we succeed but that they fail.
And of course we're not even involved in that equation so we got them to do with that.
Eighth and ninety votes on the poll you're going to get a thousand a day in spite of all this Chris.
Cool.
Yeah.
I got that new car and picking up it three this afternoon.
Yeah.
I think I'm going to, well it will be filled up with gas.
That's a one good thing when you buy a new car you know.
For that price it ought to be full of gas, isn't it?
It ought to be but.
Oh it will be.
All right.
But what?
You tell me it's not going to have a full tank of gas?
How the hell am I supposed to know what it's going to have?
Whoever heard it buying a new car and they don't fill up the tank.
Whoever heard a search of things.
Whoever heard it buying a new car.
Oh that's right I forgot.
But I'm thinking I could just hop in that baby and just haul ass.
Yeah you could.
Mm-hmm.
Monday morning you come in there like go always the old man and jolly Joe comes in.
Oh George I was kneel to him today.
I guess he's doing fine to find somewhere somewhere.
Maybe he's in wood buy.
Field time.
I have a time.
Oh.
That you know that even though it was obviously an inside job that facts.
But that's correct.
From slick.
And if you notice the header by the way that's a chronic.
Sure.
Factor.
Did you notice that?
Of course.
Average shows get average ratings.
Right.
Slick.
So if he you know something with a real name that would be good.
Or like even make up a real name.
Love you tons.
Slick.
Your hands have been tied.
Your freedom of speech has been compromised to the extent that all the funny contents been removed.
Well we know that for a long time.
I mean we can't even like it to do that.
Because then I'll get another email from.
Oh Niels is Clarence.
Please stop with the fart sounds.
I do it for me.
Oh stop.
I got to.
I got you this time.
Yes.
Screw you.
Screw you in the slick raincoat that you wear at the aballions.
Jackass.
And these people are.
And then scary part is not so much just the numbers.
I mean it's scary enough.
But the fact that there's that message from Bruce Beasley congratulating all the stations had a wonderful second to trend.
And the bomb.
Thank you so much and they're happy with this.
They're happy with this.
They are they almost be doing the same drugs.
What do you think?
Normal.
Normal can of course.
He's out of the loop.
He's busy trying to stay alive.
I'm here anymore from norm at all.
And whatever.
I don't have time to mess with Norma.
My erstwhile agent.
And I haven't been screaming for months that they're destroying the goose that laid the golden egg.
I haven't been screaming that yelling and yelling and carrying on and trying to anybody who will listen.
Anybody who will listen.
I'm dying out of here.
But nobody will listen.
Not at least not inside the building and not normal can.
See whoever keeps giving me crap about that is right.
If I would have fired his bag of the ass long time ago and got a real agent.
We'd be on serious right now.
We'd be on something.
It could have been a contender.
We could have been a contender.
And instead we got hijacked by this clown or that came in there.
But this clown, that's what he is.
He's a circus clown.
Ha ha ha!
Anyway, Santa Claus and drag.
I mean he didn't say anything to you like, oh boy these numbers really sucker.
He said nothing.
He said that you have it wrong that you need to look at the other numbers that he sent you.
And that's why I told you to look at them.
I have what wrong?
And that's what I guess.

Speaking of the advocate, Donna Paine writes, what's in the genus 6 case for us, meaning gay
people?
She says on Thursday, meaning yesterday, I, too, will be in geno Louisiana to stand with
the thousands of national civil rights activists and other people coming together in the name
of Justice and Fairness.
This rural town of 3,000 residents in central Louisiana is captured national and international
attention since long simmering racial tensions exploded in a series of violent confrontations
between African American and white teenagers at Geno High School.
The charged situation comes to a boil today, meaning yesterday.
The only reason I'm reading this, by the way, is because a lot of us, and I'm sure a lot
of people out there, aren't really all that familiar with the facts in this case, what really
happened, and what started all the at Simons.
The tragic story begins last year when a freshman at the High School in African American
asked the schools principal during the school assembly, if African American students had
permission to sit underneath the white tree of Shani oak on school grounds where white students
frequently congregated.
The white tree.
The principal replied that African American students could sit wherever they wanted.
However, the next day, three nooses in the school color no less were found dangling
from the tree, making an obvious reference to our country's long history of racial intimidation
through heinous lynchings.
Recognizing the seriousness of this incident, the school's principal expelled the white
students responsible only to have his decision overturned by the school board and superintendent
who dismissed the incident as a prank.
The offending students were allowed to return to school and punished only with three days
of in-school suspension.
In response to the superintendent decision, a group of African American students staged
lunchtime protests on campus demonstrating their opposition to the school's racist status
quo by physically occupying the tree.
Then the superintendent called an emergency school assembly at which the town's law enforcement
officials appeared in full uniform and threatened protest leaders.
As tensions mounted, racial fights broke out of the school and on campus.
In one notable incident, an African American student was assaulted hit with a beer bottle
at a party attended by mostly whites and returned six African American students beat unconscious
to white students who allegedly toned the victim at the party.
Although the white student was sent to the hospital and released the same day, the six
African American students who had come to be known as the Gina Six were arrested and
charged with attempted murder.
Five of the sixteen's were charged as adults.
The first student to stand trial Michael Bell, a sixteen-year-old sophomore in school,
football star, faced felony charges of aggravated assault and conspiracy, even though Bell faced
a possible sentence of twenty years in prison, his court appointed a lawyer called no witnesses
in his defense in last June, Bell was convicted before a white judge with an all-white jury.
Last week in part because of growing media attention in the case, an appeals court overturned
Bell's conviction.
However, he still reigns behind bars thanks to a prohibitive bond, charges for three
of the other students have been reduced to aggravated battery.
Before his conviction was overturned, Bell was scheduled to be sentenced yesterday, now
the day has become one for a different kind of action, which some forty thousand people
descended on Gina to protest what's happened.
The real story about the Gina Six is not just about the dramatic showdown between African
American residents and white authority figures in a small rural southern town.
It's about how in our country, even today, certain members of our society continue to be
subjected to blatant prejudice and deny the assurance of fair and equal treatment by
illegal and judicial protests.
Process says Donna, who's a pain.
Yeah, I think now this guy's name was Michael Bell.
I wonder if he's came to a joebell because he ought to be on that grow.
Guaranteen, I'll be glad to pull the switch.

The do-face Mid-Bag Manager of WQAM, M.
One-time Boardwalk Fitchman, Jolly Jo Bell.
How did they know that?
By the name of the shoe is Jo Bell back then.
Why I still have a case of Rolex knock off of my drunk.
Let's get right here calls now, shall we?
Is this Joseph Felicia Mae Bell?
Jo Bell here?
This is a courtesy call from American Express.
You're account to six months to link with.
We expect you to make a payment.
What's your question?
The question Mr. Bell is when?
Oh, last guy's car here.
Oh, hello?
Yes, is this Joseph Felicia Mae Bell?
Jo Bell here?
Mr. Bell, but we're about to foreclose in your house.
Oh, so we're here for you.
What's the meaning of this?
We're from the IRS.
Give us your belongings and come with us, please.
So, what do you win for, Chum?
N.W.Y.
N.W.Y.
You won drunk when you managed?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I was under the influence that I could.
I'm ruined.
They took everything.
All I have left is my virginity.
Now, boy, just have a little joke.
Oh, look, I dropped the dollar.
I'll get it.
Hey, what are you?
It's...
What did it do to you?
What did it do to you?
What did it do to you?
I said, it's...
What did it do to you?
What did it do to you?
What did it do to you?
What did it do to you?
What?
I'm dying on the ground.
Down in Miami, near the Losers' Lullaby,
there's a big, fast, fast, and big jolly joke.
He manages a radio station there,
and becomes the paying bills Joe don't care.
That'd be terrible.
Man, what a baby love, puppies, puppies, puppies,
Chogeneable, watermelon, oh,ongo,pped,
That'd be fun.
Joe's picked a point out thatds we read
at the standing grease.
Pracimably.
I'm not the only one who's been left with no choice,
Let's believe on your desk a steaming pile of joy.
That'd be joeable, man, not a regular alcohol for a hair.
That'd be what we'd be, that'd be joeable, and you'd go, oh, oh, oh, oh, that'd be joeable.
I'm looking forward to seeing that beat joe on the corner of the jog and palm metal pub room.
Walking through the traffic with a cardboard sign that says, oh, that'd be boppa.
Can you smirm me a dime?
We're beating that beat joeable, you're trying to get your fuck off of the pool.
That'd be, that'd be, I'm her fake fucker, but I'm a horrible girl.
A-co-girl, that beat joeable.
Okay, 12-04 at 560 WQM, we continue plotting along, man, plotting straight ahead.
Just with our blinders on, moving straight ahead.
It wasn't so bad, Neon, you're interpreting it all wrong.
The guys across the street really had a bad month. Wow.
Woo!
That convinces me, aren't you convinced?
Yeah, of what?
I don't know.
That we're working for an idiot.
Oh, I'm convinced that there are two stations trying to suck.
And she's sitting very well.
Maybe that's why it's the contest.
It's like a contest for last.
The US dollar, thank you, Mr. President, for those low-gas prices and for that strong American dollar.
Oh, my God.
In fact, he knows what I ought to do right now.
Talk about depression.
Maybe I can work myself into a really deep depression and jump off the balcony here.
And like, Chris' is, I'll take the mic with me.
I mean, the court isn't long enough to go very far, but I can-
Get a cordless sort of mic with you.
Yeah, in fact, I think I can handle-
You know what I mean?
I don't think so.
I don't think it's strong enough to hold, but you never know.
Okay, let's see how that Canadian Illunia is doing.
It was actually over a dollar during the middle of the night,
and then dropped back down to 99.76.
Oh, it is over a dollar.
It's a dollar and one hundredth of its-
Three hundredth of its set as I spoke it went up.
The Canadian dollars were just a hair more than the US dollar as I speak,
which is enough to make me want to pay my brains out.
When I first came up here six years ago,
the Canadian dollars were worth $0.62, so that was a good bargain if you could pay the US dollars.
See what I'm saying?
So now it's lost $0.38, so $0.38 out of $0.62 is more than half of its value.
Do you follow what I'm telling you?
No.
Sure you do.
In other words, I've lost more than 50% of my buying power, like on rent and buying-
Oh, I see.
...things like that.
Yeah.
In addition to which there ain't going to be hardly any American tourists coming here anymore
because the US dollar isn't-
In fact, here's the story I was going to get to before you got me a sidetracked on fat ass jolly joe.
I think that going back to that last bit about doing a steamy pile of joys,
I think that during his lunch hour, which he's probably off lunch for two, three hours,
not a pat himself on the back, oh ho ho ho, we sure did great.
Even Bruce B with semi-nice notes saying, oh good job jolly joe.
Everybody in the building should instead of going to lunch tonight should take turns,
going into his office and dropping a gigantic pile of joys on his desk.
I'm envisioning the scene as I'm saying it.
Can't you see it?
I'm trying not to.
Can't you smell it?
I try to do that either.
Starting with Chris, I think you could probably do a good number on that one.
Throw one in.
And when jolly joe comes back from lunch, surprise a big steamy surprise for good old jolly joe.
Man, what you've done here is almost unspeakable.
I'm sure we can't say it because if it's unspeakable.
Right, whatever we want to say, it's unspeakable.
That's okay.
I'll continue taking the money, thank you.
In fact, hopefully that check will show up on Monday a day early.
I've got them potty trained, they check show up early most of the time now,
and that's the way it better continue being.
Dollar hits new low against the euro.
The US dollar hit a new record low against euro as investors sold the currency after the Federal Reserve's hefty interest rate cut.
The US dollar isn't worth a squat.
In fact, all you people out there that are finding time, you know, your house is being foreclosed and all this other stuff.
You can't afford to buy toilet paper.
Just take whatever dollar bills you can find and wipe your ass with them because that's about what they're worth toilet paper.
Mr. Wipples coming out with new toilet paper that's got like the picture George Washington on it.
The green backdrop below these psychologically key dollar 40 level against the euro,
deepening recent losses.
Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar reached one-to-one parity with the US currency for the first time in 31 freaking years.
Oh my God.
A strong domestic economy and concerns about the US economic slowdown of Linda the Rally on Canada's loony.
How's it going, eh?
The euro reached as much as 140.99 and yesterday's trading in the highest level since the single European currency was launched.
Hints of rate.
So if you're going to be planning on going to Europe, uh, forget it.
I guess that screws your trip up, George.
Oh yeah.
And the Chris too.
All Chris is going to Vegas.
When are you going?
Uh, seventh.
Seventh of the one.
October.
Hints of rate raises from the European Central Bank and stronger European growth have also booted the euro's value.
Analysts to say the impact of the plunging dollar on European consumer businesses may be mixed.
Eurozone consumers may benefit from cheaper prices for some imported goods while in put costs for your zone firms may fall as oil, metals and many raw material prices are quoted in dollars.
However, while the strong euro may cut some import costs, you could also have a negative effect on exports as European made goods become more expensive.
The US of course is Europe's largest trading partner.
It could also hurt growth in Asia with the US being the largest market for China, Korea and other Asian exporters.
The dollar has been weakening for some time.
Thanks to the fact that your president is just pouring like it's coming out of a faucet, pouring millions of dollars down the toilet in Iraq.
The fundamental problem is the growing US trade deficit now more than $700 billion as the US economy is imported far more goods than it's exported.
The economy is in the shambles.
People's homes are being foreclosed and all of this other, hey, everything is great.
Everything's coming up roses, baby.
The S&P is up, although I probably end up today.
I don't know what it is, I don't care.
You care?
No.
Call up Rick Ryan and find out what the fair value is.
Fair value is plus three.
You're an idiot Rick, you're a simple-demand.
There's a guy that parliathed himself out of a really cheesy job.
And poor suds, you know, he took an effort because of the alcohol.
I had a dream, a dream about you, baby.
It's gonna come true, baby.
They think that we're through, but baby.
Just for you, baby.
You'll be, well, you'll be great.
Gonna have the whole world on a plate.
Doesn't hear, doesn't know.
Honey, everything's coming up roses.
Yeah, smells like roses to me.
Can you believe it?
Good ol' Joyce, I'm Joe's desk.
I think that's the best idea, the niftyest idea I had a long time.
I was gonna say the neatest idea, but it probably wouldn't be really neat.
No, or tidy.
You never know, though.
Could be really antiseptic, one of those deals.
Hopefully not.

Something even our audience had turned into whatch are fashes to much of Nazis.
They did the right thing.
He was a grandstanding.
He was making a lot of noise.
He wouldn't give the microphone back.
So, it teased his ass.
Okay, teased him, bro, and do it now.
Teased him, man.
One more time.
He's got a little project.

I can make guys roll.
With my body and booty.
That's where they're both rolls.
For the such a beauty, it's one of those things I've waited for.
Be it such a big girl.
I can make guys roll.
With my body and booty.
That's where they're both rolls.
For the such a beauty, it's one of the things I've worked for.
But be it such a big girl.
Be it such a big girl.
Okay, just look back over those a month or so again.
And you know what?
What?
They suck.
Oh.
17-5-60-QAM.
I thought you were going to see something different.
I mean, that's something the first time.
And I look back over again.
Oh, you're taking it all wrong.
We're doing great.
Even Bruce says so.
I think that's a good pull.
Maybe we'll do it on Monday if I come back.
Or maybe you can do it.
What drug do you think the bees these are doing over there in Naples?
What's their number one drug of choice?
Because they certainly have to be hallucinating.
They have to be hallucinating.
Great job, guys.
Great second trend.
But I'm right.
I think this is what's called diminished expectations.
You know, back when fours and fives were where it was at as far as, you know, the men.
Well, you know, now we got to split the audience with the Joe will across the street.
Yeah, right.
Because we know the kind of swill that he's got on here.
It's garbage.
Swill.
So, you know, when you talk about narrow casting, that's one thing.
But all depending on who's doing the narrow casting, see?
You know what I'm saying?
What?
In other words, if you were talking about coin collecting, it was somebody who really could make it interesting.
And somebody think well, and that's yeah.
Right.
Well, they're all bad examples.
If you're talking about politics, politics, whatever.
If that's all you talk about, but you had somebody who made it really interesting and really, you know, spiced it up, then you got a chance.
But if you talk about politics and you've got somebody who's like, sounds like Lenny Martezza in a bad day, then you probably aren't going to get much of a number.
See what I'm saying?
No.
They don't see what you're saying.
No, they sure don't.
And that's the point.
They think you, and you've been making that point and I have to confess you're right.
They think that you can take anybody no matter what they sound like.
And as long as they're talking about SPRTS, that's all accounts.
I'm getting a sore throat.
Uh-oh.
I'm getting a raw throat.
Don't get sore.
Huh?
Makes me get all worked up from screaming in your own about all this crap.
How nice cup of tea.
Mm-hmm.
I don't want a cup of tea.
What I want to do is like by one o'clock, run out of voice, and you do the one or two are.
Don't do that.
I'll spin wax.
Yeah, spin wax.
And it's obvious that we needed very well in August too, by the way.
What I've been talking about.
All those great calls that Joe Bell likes so much.
It's also helped in August.
No question about that.
What music show, Mr.
on later days?
I'm not laying the blame on your doorstep.
Well, trust me when I tell you, I've never done that in an hour.
I will do it, although it must have been really bad.
It's all right.
And see, that's what Joe thinks this show is all about.
It's what you were forced to do all summer long.
And of course, in the beginning it was okay, but then as time wore on,
and we had the same four callers day after day after day.
And you know, if you're just screened to calls, you'll allow them to do it.
And we did.
Of course, Chris knows how well that worked.
They worked on Chris.
Worked wonderfully, not.
Didn't do a damn thing.
And Joe Bell and the bees, these days, wouldn't lift their little pinky
to do anything for this show because it's not a sports show.
And because they don't like my attitudes.
And they certainly don't like your attitudes.
Oh, no.
George.
That's fine.
Right.
I don't like their attitudes.
They don't like us and we don't like them.
We hate them, like Poison and Wish Something Evil would happen to them.
But they live in a world of dementia and they're like running around.
Oh, look at this.
We had a two in person's 25 54.
We did.
See, I finally figured out how to read that stuff that I'm not supposed to talk about.
How?
And upside down?
Yeah.
In Hebrew.
Right to left.
Well, there's often a dinner job speaking in Hebrew.
You're Ronnie in President's language.
I'm running to the house and play a moment.
But he meets me with a bad boy.
And who cares?
Look at that.
They did the right thing.
This is just a spiked me now.
Hit a man when he's down.
And that's the South-Ford audience, you know?
Sometimes they come through for us on the pool, stuff like that.
But when push comes to shove, they shove it.
Those cops who taser that poor kid at UF, they did the right thing
as first place, 156 out of 951 vote.
We'll have 1,000, but not by much, Chris.
Not going to be like overwhelming.
It's a Friday, you know?
Exactly.
Now, how do you respond to that?
What is your mental process, tell you, when more...
I mean, it's not overwhelming.
It's 16.4%.
But more people vote for that than any of the other 85 categories we have there.
Because all of the other options are again it.
There is no ambivalent thing in on there.
And I always told you to put something like that on there.
For the people that don't give a rat's ass.
Yeah.
The shoulder shrug response.
For the people that don't give a rat's ass, I say don't vote on the pool.
Well, there's nothing...
If it's not a semi-fifth, it's an interest to you.
Or you've been, you know, buried with your head deep in the sand like an ostrich for a long time.
Then just go on to something else.
Well, no, don't tell them that.
What do you mean by that?
We need the votes.
What are you talking about?
That's right.
Like I said, even if you hate the whole idea and don't know what it's all about, vote anyway.
Pick one.
It sounds good to you.
Did the right thing as good as just to piss me off?
157 say.
Those cops did the right thing.
What did that...
Taze his ass.
Don't Taze me, bro!
Ow!
Ow!
That's what I was saying when I saw those numbers.
Ow!
Ow!
But, you know, something going as tough and, like I said, I actually got a little bit agitated
today.
I will confess to that all the way.
You know what?
You don't really start it off?
I don't know.
Breakfast?
I didn't have breakfast.
I had my bacon.
Now what started it off for me was when Jolly Jo was...
He screwed up the whole show.
Why did you let him come in there?
Why don't you tell him, get that out of here, you idiot.
I wanted him to screw up the show.
He owns Belle Bell.
He owns Belle Bell.
How are you doing now?
It's Belle Bell.
The intercom doesn't work.
You fat goofball you.
It doesn't work.
And why should it?
Why should anything else work?
You know?
Just like the thing with a dump gun.
It'll red light that keeps coming on.
And then I have to keep turning it off.
You know, it's not connected to anything anymore, but nevertheless, they never made any effort
to do anything about it.
They got a great engineer here, which is probably whether they don't want to pay him.
Just gone by me.
They don't want to pay him to make a visit over here.
God forbid, I had the whole summer.
He could have come up here anytime and taken care of that.
But why should I worry about it?
I'll leave it in your hands, and you can get canned for not dumping something.
Okay.
The City of Amsterdam announced yesterday will invest up to 15 million euros, which is now 21 million dollars,
to help clean up its famous red light district by buying brothels there.
Oh, no.
The city will help a real estate developer by 51 storefront windows, where prostitutes apply their trade
to convert them into apartments or commercial premises.
Although prostitution has been legal in Neville since 2000, the city's trying to bring about a voluntary cleanup
of Amsterdam's famous red light district, City Mayor Job Cohen told the news conference
that the deal announced yesterday represented a big step since the legalization in 2000,
things have changed, Cohen said.
The law was created for voluntary prostitution, but these days we see trafficking of women,
exploitation, and all kinds of criminal activity, he said.
Yeah, I'm sure I ought to be a lot more worried about the prostitutes behind the windows
than those roster jerks who are peddling drugs in the streets.
We don't want to round them off.
Nope.
Nope.
The fallen, as the prostitution district is known in Dutch, is one of the oldest and most picturesque areas of Amsterdam
and draws hordes of tourists, although they mainly flock there to gawk at the women.
Well, there may be a few of them doing others than just gawking.
It's not about chasing prostitution off the fallen, but it's about fighting crime, Cohen stressed.
City Council member responsible for finance, Lodwike Ossier said,
closing down the prostitutes windows should not have a negative impact on tourism.
We are talking about what we call vertical drinkers.
People walk around the district drinking hand and never sit down in the areas, bars, and restaurants.
He said of the tourist attraction of the area.
What's more important, they tourist attraction are women who are victims.
It's modern slavery asher added.
However, the Dutch sex workers union deroted the draw to criticize the plans.
We believe that less windows means more exploitation of women's spokesmen,
met the block told AFP.
If the windows closed down, women who are being exploited will be hidden somewhere else
where union representatives and health workers can't make contact with them, she said.
The city should go after pimps, not real estate, she be saying.
Real estate developer NV Stocksgoad agreed to pay 25 million euros to buy the stir-up from windows
from Red Light District, Kingpin, Charles Geertz.
Prostitutes hire the windows for around 100 euros for part of the day
and one window usually has several prostitutes for a day,
making it a very lucrative business to hire the windows out.
The city of Amsterdam is here marked up to 15 million euros
to compensate the loss of value in the prostitutes are no longer there.
Under the deal with the municipality Geertz is not allowed to invest the money here
and to the Red Light District again.
Even if he invests outside the wall and he's not allowed to invest in prostitution,
gambling or coffee shops, cannabis cafes allow the summer or jowini.
The 51 prostitute windows will be closed, represent about a third of such windows in the Red Light District.
The city of Amsterdam announced last autumn plans to clean up the area
which has been the city's prostitutions on for more than 100 years.
So even in Amsterdam they went in time, they got to clean it up.
Everything has got... maybe we can send Rudy Giuliani over there after he loses the election.
And he can do like he did in Times Square and clean it up to make sure nobody comes to see anything there.
You know what I'm saying? What do you say?
I'm saying he's full of crap.
Yeah.
Rudy Giuliani has been 85 different wives.
Terror, terror, terror.
Delaware University locked down the campus and canceled classes ahead of the two shootings there.

Or jump in Jacksonville a former parishioner sued a priest and Greek Orthodox church on allegations of sexual assault though
The priest attorney said the lawsuit is frivolous
The suit against the very Reverend Nicholas T. Graff what does that mean very Reverend not just people in right moderately
Very revered these same John the divine Greek Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Mirko was filed this week in Duval County Circuit court
It doesn't identify the 22 year old person or his family members by name
The suit claims that when the person who became a teenager
Graff began exhibiting undue obsessive and inappropriate interest in them including taking the person who tuned from school every day and buying an automobile and clothing
Uh-oh
The lawsuit also claims that Graff gave the teenage person or $500 a week over six year period paid travel expenses
Film bills and tuition and induced him to move into grads home
The behavior escalated into sexual misconduct when the person turned 16 the suit alleges and the summer of
2003 Graff offered the person his mother 300 grand as surrender parental rights, but the mother refused the suit said
Started like he wanted to buy him somebody
The suit alleges that about two years later Graff sexually assaulted the person and filed a petition to formally adopt him
The suit also alleges that the church knew the Graff was under investigation from his conduct father Frank Morango
It's exactly the director of communications for the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America New York City
I had no comment because the Archdiocese hadn't been served with a lawsuit yet
Full calls to Graff's home in the Jacksonville church not answered Graff's attorney Tom Falles
Said he hadn't served with a lawsuit. That's his name with an F-no get out. I all right
Said he hadn't served with a lawsuit. We think it has no merriot and think it's fervilous falles said

You want a boycott fan-ass Jolly Jobelle and Gl有點 rice and Joyce. Sure. Give him a big
for me give him a big sentence. A Roman Catholic priestly the guilty to felony battery with a deadly weapon and an attack on a church soloist at his Las Vegas parish early this year
The Reverend George ШэнIne had been the yesterday in Clark County District Court
that he snatched a wine bottle over the 54-year-old woman's head at our Lady of Las Vegas Catholic Church in January
Prosecutors drop other charges including attempted murder and sexual assault.
Our prosecutors analyze the case.
They spoke with the victim and she thought it was best to resolve this case.
Short of trial, David Rodger said.
I wonder if David's kind of...
Bill God!
Rodger.
These are the woman or her lawyer immediately reached for comment.
Shanaen 53 remained in jail and $1 million bail pending sentencing November 1.
The battery charge carries a maximum prison term of 6 to 15 years, which Shanaen could
be eligible for probation official set.
Who remains suspended by the DIC's Las Vegas, the district attorney said that as a convicted
felon, Shanaen would probably never be appreased again.
Oh no!
Deputy public defender Scott Coffey said Shanaen took responsibility for the attack but
immediately denies there was any sexual assault.
Wait till you're the name of the bishop.
Oh, when we get to that, you'll just...
That's right.
Put a smile on your face.
The woman saying at the church she was hired by Shanaen in October as the Perish events
coordinator.
She accused Shanaen of hitting her in the haze with a wine bottle January 26th, stopping
on her hand, groping her and choking her until she began praying.
Oh, she said he suddenly stopped and fled.
Shanaen was arrested almost a week later near Phoenix.
The woman was treated for a broken hand in the gash on the haze authority saved.
Both sides characterized Shanaen's relationship with his accuses more than priest and parishioner
but they didn't say the two were romantically involved.
Here it comes.
Bishop Joseph Pepe, the head of the Las Vegas Diocese, I know it would work.
His name is P-E-P-E.
It sure is not Pepe.
Bishop Joseph Pepe, the head of Las Vegas Diocese, issued the statement yesterday,
characterizing the church when we were a satan and saying he prayed for unity and strength
in the congregation.
Let's pray for Bishop Pepe.
Let's all say a prayer for Pepe.
You pray for Pepe.
All I do.
I'll pray for something else.
Yeah.
I'll bet you will.
That probably sounds like that.
Yeah.
Sure does.
That is probably a catch to it.
Let's see, 990, are we going to make that thousand of star?
Let's do it this hour, 992 and then the last hour, we can just forget about it.
167 people said those.
Keystone cops did the right thing.
Tased them, bro.
They tased them.
That's the leading category.
16.28% of us astute crowds say, we like it.
Good going, porkers.
You did the right thing.
Tased them, bro.
Tased them.
Out of 992.
I mean, the people, I mean, I know they do, but I just, do people who I...
People still say, bro, I mean, I know they do.
Sure.
I just, I just seem so 70s to me, you know?
Yeah.
I mean, it's really cool you could say, bro, you know, that's very West Coast.
994, we need six more votes in lemons.
I mean, that should be a no-brainer, but based on what I'm seeing on these sheets we've
got here, wow.
Johnny Joe Bell sent me a bunch of crap here, the likes of what you wouldn't say.
I didn't print it all out.
I printed out about six billion pages after that.
I thought, wow, I don't want to waste all my fax paper, you know?
Because they might not pay for any more, because they don't pay for any at all.
You know that's how I never run out of fax paper?
I know it's that.
Yeah.
The Fosh network, which censored the anti-war statement from Sally Field, including
the word GD, see I can't even say it.
God.
Or.
Right.
Damn.
Right.
At some days, any of the words isn't so conservative when it comes to the use of the G word
on Fox News programming, and that's GD hypocrisy, it says, think progress.
And let's face it, if mothers rule the world field center or acceptance speech, there would
be no GD words in the first place.
But a new film compilation from Fox attacks a Robert Greenwald proves the network to let
at least five other GDs go on Blit Thunder as programming.
Yesterday, the conservative newsbusters, a media watchdog, group of others took a swipe
at the Washington Post, Howard Kurtz, for suggesting the censoring of field by Fox had been politically
motivated, as if there's any doubt.
Well, it's an on story that's become a story because of Fox pulling the plug on a
random or sentiment, Kurtz told Glenn Dreck on CNN's reliable sources.
However, that's not what happened.
Newsbusters, Lynn Davidson writes, instead as the orchestra's signalling time was up,
Fox cut fields sound after she uttered G. God, they kept the last part up.
Fox also sends it to others because for obscenity.
During its Emmy broadcast, Fox also sends it remarks from Ray Romano who used the word
screwing, or can you believe that we can even say it on the show in ASS?
Fox is screwing.
And Catherine Heigel, who mouth words, oh, Schmidt after hearing her name call well.
You know, it's something she meld the words.
It says she mow the words ocean.
Oh, okay, Sam, she mow them.
She's a mowder.
So how do you censor that?
You don't show it.
You just wait the video.
They, they, they, they, they bleeped to death.
They bleeped out the video.
They bleeped out the video.
They were mowing, oh Schmidt.
Oh, Schmidt.
Oh, oh.
999, baby.
The next book gets 1,000.
We're going to have Joe Bell said you a billion dollars in cash.
Not.
Well, maybe send you a dollar bill or maybe you'll send you a $3 bill or bill for a dollar
to come to your house.
What?
I said, how's it going?
Freaking Carlos.
He's still there.
I mean, he's got the pictures.
We got 1,000 votes Chris.
We're in the despair.
I'm glad we are pumped and sighted.
Anybody believe us?
I have no lie.
No.
Well, got 1,000 votes.
And here's that poor result.
Okay.
And of course, this one is a long.
It's Charlie B.
It is worst.
The college cops who laser in that goofball U.F.

Now, how I am, they all still Bell.
That was that that impetimize the last this whole Joe Bell experience a few a.m.
That was the epitome of it.
Underline the penny part.
Pity poo.
Anyway, they did the right thing.
I read 69 the taser cops would make president Abu Ghraib a dumb Schmidt proud.
159.
I could play the you know Abu Ghraib, but why bother?
Their cop on a bays and flunk the police exam on 50.
Show them what the Edigan democracy is dead in Florida 117.
We're itching to play cops and robbers with their new toy tasers.
160.
See all of these caters, too many categories on here, Charlie B. You lost it.
I don't know what you were doing in Europe, although I have a pretty good idea, but you
lost it, man.
Our bunch of trigger happy goons 105.
I mean, they all say the same thing, don't they?
Except should have used guns 73 really violent bastards out there.

Sure.
That's what the old people right.
Pacing old people.
I think that's great.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Pacing old parts.
You heard of hazy are too acting ahead for even waking up seven out of a thousand and
five.
Well, we got our thousand within hour and six minutes to spare not that I'm counting
you understand.
Although we are in despair today, but it's just one of those things.
And of course, yeah, it's us.
I think we ought to adopt the Bruce Beasley Jolly Joe attitude.
We're kicking ass baby.
We're doing it.
Just remember, it's not important in life that you succeed, but that everybody else fails.

The OJ Simpson case.
Now here's the deal.
His name is Charles Hurley.
Six months ago.
The OJP's to the charges.
Oh, I'm in an amended complaint filed and opened court this morning.
They would not go to the court.
They would not go to the court.
That's an early blind dollar.
He must surrender his passport.
And the judge before he would say.
You were in.
Monday to Friday to his attorney.
But again, a six person has turned himself in the OJ.
Well, I don't know.
Aren't you excited about that?
A six person is yourself in.
And he's probably going to be singing like a jailbird.
You know.
Singing like a canary.
Ten ten on the pole, Chris.
Nice work.
Well, I think ten ten.
Ten ten.
That's the audience baby.
That's what we got.
I think we got about 1500 people out there.
It's not so bad, Jolly Joe.
Oh, good job, Neil.
Oh, oh, oh.
We lucky people are construction worker.
And they gave you like, you know, all the tools in the whole deal.
And then they put you in a corner in a room somewhere.
And they tied you up.
And they tied your hands behind your back.
And they took the tools away and said,
Well, how come you're not doing a good job of building this joint, you know?
Right.
Or smoking it.
That's what they've done to us.
And you know something too bad.
We're going to continue taking the money.
Either that or they can just pay us off.
Now, you've got a really crappy,
a lot solid contract.
I don't know what you're going to say.
Crappy, is that what you're going to say?
Well, that's the normal Kenfor again, you know.
Take care of George.
He's just like Bob Green.
I'll take care of George.
I'll take care of him.
I've been taking care of him so many times.
I'll take care of him.
And all they do is like,
take both feet and they just shumble right in there.
Uh-huh.
I think that's what they had to do.
It's just maybe on Monday.
Just write me a check for what have I got left?
Are you on change?
You're in three months.
Fifteen months.
Just write a check for the whole amount.
And I won't go anywhere else.
I promise I won't be on the radio.
And I'll just go away and take all my...
See, the bad thing about the solstice is it doesn't have much of a trunk.
Uh-huh.
You know what I mean?
Sure.
So it's not like you could pack up like a whole bunch of real good stuff
and just take off.
You have a whole bunch of real good stuff.
No, not really.
Certainly not clothes, no.
I could always buy a new clothes.
When you get to where you're going, really.
Where is that?
Where you wind up.
Oh.
When you wind up again.
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
Aim the car in a direction and be healthy.
I could just get that new car this afternoon in the hall ass and just take off saying,
where am I going to go?
I don't know.
Maybe Calgary sounds interesting.
Not.
I don't know.
What about Vancouver?
I hear wonderful things about Vancouver.
I'd love to.
Yeah, but it's a long, schlep baby.
Yeah.
That's like driving from Miami to California.
What else you got to do?
Well, that's true.
Not nothing else.
Nothing pressing.
Just wait to die, I guess.
No, nothing pressing.
Just depressing.
Cindy, she and Rice, I tell you what, I'm going to go take a leak now.
This is part of my protest or, normally, I do it during the break, but I'm going to do it now.
Really?
Well, I have to.
I should have done through that last break, but I was so excited about Larry Craig.
It was kind of a toad tap or that music.
You want me to play something and you're going to do that?
I'm not going to do anything.
I'm going to go pee.
With the microphone.
With Bishop Pepe.
No, I'm not going to pee with the microphone.
What are you talking about?
I don't make no like pee.
It's a pee splashing sound.
I don't.
And then Joyce will really get all bent out of shape.
Just so you're pouring water into the sink.
Can't you feel like a minute or I could play another bit?
Whatever.
I'm not going to play that reed of book thing.
What I could say everybody really upset.
I don't know why.
Maybe that's when they turned against us.
Yeah, that was it.
I mean, and the only reason I kept playing it is because that's about the only funny thing we can play anymore, you know?
Well, maybe this is okay.
And then the Lord said, let there be light and love.
There was light from the same people who brought you the much beloved talking Bible.
Comes a new 10 volume set, brilliantly updated for the 80s.
Yes, it's the wrapping Bible.
There was dark everywhere.
Then the man said, I am the light wasn't there.
He said, I'm done good.
There's no doubt on the seventh day.
He just chill out.
Genetics.
Genetics.
Beginning of death.
Beginning of death.
Finally, a good book.
And he was worried.
He was mad.
Check it out.
There's a town called Sodom.
And tomorrow everybody party like no tomorrow.
God will tell.
Say, now my fault.
Go look back or you turn to sod.
That's why you took a peak.
Started to freak.
The cow came up and lit the cheek.
Take a lick, y'all.
Of the cheek, y'all.
Imagine all the thong, all the peribos.
Every sacred, biblical word.
Interpreted by the finest, sucker, emcees of all time.
Genesis.
Exodus.
To the body.
The wrapping Bible.
Making his word fresh again.
That's older than a thuseless, speaking of biblical stuff.
But nevertheless, it's still a rather amusing.
Not funny.
And we can't play any funny anymore.
You know, not fall down and pee in your pants.
Otherwise, it just did pee.
Listen to me.
It's a stand by thing.
We can't play that.
I know it's just a little tidbit of that.
Yeah.
One that we used to play.
That was a tease.
Don't play this and don't do that.
And don't say this.
And surely don't make any of those sounds.
And it's like that.
Jolly Joe, you are a jackass.
My vocabulary, even though it's fairly extensive,
is limited when it comes to describing what a total loser you are.
You are just absolutely the end of the universe.
You are the anti-broadcaster.
Cindy Sheen writes, General, be tray us and move on.org.
She says, I've often been critical of move on.org basically because I feel for the most part
that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy.
However, move on.org was a big help to me of Camp Casey in August 2005
and organized the thousands of candlelight vigils that occurred across the country.
I'll always be grateful to them for that.
I had a policy with my children when we were younger.
I always tried to catch them doing something right, sharing, being kind, etc.
And I would phrase them and give them a treat.
Sounds like a dog.
In that vein, I have to give my 100% support to move on.org in regard to their right on add
in the New York Times.
It's become even the object of a Senate announcement.
It must be hard for move on.org to have 21 Democratic Senators vote to announce the add
when move on.org has been so supportive of the party.
However, I don't think it's appropriate for the Senate to be voting on newspaper ads
when it is a clear first amendment right of anyone in our representative republic to play such ads
whether one agrees with them or not, and with almost half the same Democrats voting
to announce move on's freedom of speech and the Democratic leadership taking impeachment
off the table and giving Bush co-more latitude to despionists,
I wonder which part of our Constitution the Democrats will defile next.
Today, George and his unbridled and unmatched arrogance and just add that stupidity
called the move on add disgusting.
What I find more disgusting is a cowardly commander in chief and all of his supposed underlings
lying to our country in the world and sending our young troops to fight, die, be wounded,
and kill innocent people when they were too busy to do the same in their mistake of war, Vietnam.
What I find disgusting is CNN where a Eli Perizer move on debate a pro-war person
rarely criticizes the occupation or shows the tragic consequences of this war
and they're raising money so poor a rancid book and every constructive surgery on his badly burned face.
That's great but what about examining the reasons the lawyer said was burned in the first place
and start calling for immediate withdrawal of troops?
What about the millions of other rancis who have been wounded or displaced?
Who's telling their stories and raising money for them to be whole and have homes?
What I find disgusting is general betray us allowing himself to be used as a political force field
for the lying administration and lying himself.
Sokkyrian violence is not down 80 percent.
The GAO report in the fact that hundreds of rancis are killed every month,
50,000 leave their homes on a monthly basis directly conquered if these facts.
The only reason some places are safer in the rancis because the neighborhoods have been ethnically cleansed
and the sectarian militias are providing security to small geographic areas.
In the very violent south, she and Mothley are fighting Shia-batter.
It's a disaster that needs to be faced and solved now, not put away until the springer prolongs
so Democrats can get the White House back in 2008.
General betrayers is not going to be trade American as oath of service
but he's betrayed the very troops he should care about more than being a ask-kissing,
little chicken Schmidt to commander-in-chief who spent years betraying the troops.
It's time to truly support our troops and start withdrawing them immediately not to pre-surge levels
but to pre-invasion levels.
It's time to listen to the people of Iraq and force the mercenary killers and other contractors to leave
and give the people of Iraq back their jobs, 50 percent unemployment rate in some areas, some areas higher, and their country.
The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud move on for moving a little closer to the true anti-war movement
and courage then to come with us farther.
Anyone who's concerned with the rapids' life to fascism should be supporting move on in this battle.
Anyone who cares about democracy over Democrats or refugs should join me in supporting move on in this particular struggle
and in bringing move on more fully to the table with the peace movement.
Thanks move on for speaking to the majority of Americans and please stick to your so-called guns,
the struggle is worthwhile.
So Cindy Shin, who's son by the way is still dead.
I was gonna ask about that.
10-20 on the dial, that's the KDK Pittsburgh.
And here's Bob Princeton, Jim Woods with the Pirates game, well that's right, they're both dead.
Damn it.
And Nelly King, well Nelly King do it in a big two.
That's always when I turn the game off as when they let Nelly King, he's another ex-joc.
George gets angry.
What?
Well anything has to do with sports you get angry.
No I don't.
I can't imagine why he's like, does he get angry at Chris?
Now here's the first race it would buy in today.
They're going into the gate.
Dan Loisell, who's just like an autonomous automaton.
He'll be calling the race for it.
So we listen to the first race it would buy.
Or better yet I'll go get my new butt.
Yeah sure.
Let's be a good race for the radio stage.
I know.
Let's talk about Nero casting.
Let's talk about horse racing.
Red River Jane.
Heads into the gate with a cup.
Outside we are into my dreams of Farlus King.
Wonder which horse Justin Stein had in this race.
That's my boy Justin Stein, a Justin.
Oh baby, he's married though.
I shouldn't be talking to this stuff you know.
Oh Neil's going to bet on the cute jockey hole.
I remember that call that day.
That was good now.
Always look at the jockey to see which horse I'm going to bet on before race.
How about Emma Jane Wilson?
You look at the jockey.
She's pretty good.
She's damn good Emma Jane.
They're up the post.
They're off.
Come on you can do it then.
They're off.
Off-slaw was first time starter all the way.
Left follow the base from the outside coming on between horses.
Is this unbridled excitement or what?
It's towards the rail.
Is that a pun bridle or what?
That's why I said it.
Anyway horse racing, that's the neural casting.
Let's talk about the Panthers.
We love the Panthers and Joel's got the Panthers game.
Edamall and Gaines next season too.
Anna Boy Joel, nice trend there.
See that's what they're all excited about.
Not that we're doing that working in ASS who are doing anything that would be really considered by anybody.
That's the fact that they're just, you know, they had a bogus month there in no June or July whatever it was.
And, you know, like I told you before about the trends, you ride three months on them.
Sure.
And when they vanish, when they disappear.
Oh my God, we have like a one last month.
That's what they're saying over there.
Right, that's what they're saying.
That's what Joel is doing, gripping a lot.
And that's to the kid, is he kidding anybody?
And he did that horse ball number.
That was before Joel was over here.
That was against Kenny and Schmoh.
That was the biggest name.
Back to the era.
Back to the era.
Back to the era.
Back to the era.
Back to the era.
Back to the era.
That was the biggest name.
The biggest name.
The best talent.
It's the mad dog.
Oh, and the man that's him.
Sports radio 5.60 QAM.
Sports radio 5.60 QAM.
The sports leader.
Oh, frosting ads.
This is Debbie.
Hi, Debbie.
I'm in the student games operations done.
Okay.
And some body contouring and some liposuction.
And I was wondering if it's Tommy Chalk.
And the lip augmentation cosmetic, the breast surgery, face shift, all of these things.
And I was wondering.
What would you like to start with?
Well, I need to get everything done.
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.
Okay, we don't do that.
No.
Could you do breast implants, though?
Uh, I can't be done, but I don't know if they would do right away.
It was the lotion in the basket.
How much?
Uh, 5,000.
Excellent.
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced, too.
Uh-huh.
Laser surgery.
Uh-huh.
Have the lambs stop crying yet, mommy?
Excuse me?
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.
Okay.
Can you make me look more like a woman?
Well, we'll have to see you first.
And then upon looking at you, we can tell you that when we see you.
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?
Uh, if you'd like to.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Well, you'd like to make an appointment?
Yes.
Okay.
And there is a $100 consultation fee.
That's fine.
Okay.
Okay.
Um...
My name is Buffalo Bill.
Okay, let me get a little information from you.
Okay, just a moment.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Do you want to come in for a consultation for life?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
Do you want to make an appointment?
Do you want to call me back?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
I've got my skin suit and I'm going to go like, eeewww.
Bill.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand that.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Would you like to make an appointment?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Okay, I will talk into the time, okay?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Hello?
Goodbye.
Well, 18 at 5.60 W.D.Q.M.
See, digging out some of these oldie moldies
because as you get toward the very end,
you want to play like maybe we'll play the bridge tender.
All right.
And young Nioh, stuff like that.
10.33 on the pole, not too bad.
I bet you'll make 1100 if Chris were to really lean down
but he's, you know, he's worn out from yesterday.
We can give him a pause at it.
Now, we can give you a pause because you had that 75 hour
day yesterday when I had you on the board working your brains on.
Did you, did you work with Robert Gryper yesterday?
No, Gryper was in this studio doing the Marlins game
and I was working with Robert Gryper.
Well, he was in that studio screwing our equipment up, huh?
Doing the Marlins game?
Correct.
And the Marlins actually won again.
They beat the NETS CH-OK EMS?
Correct.
Notice the red socks in the meds seem to be doing a
simulcast and they both seem to be choking like a pig,
like a horse, gagging.
Am I wrong or have it enough that I pay that much attention
to it?
And they're right.
I'm right.
Maybe the Leafs game is on again.
They play the next edition game against Phoenix last night
right here at the Air Canada Center.
It is on, but they're in a commercial break.
We don't want the spot, do we?
We want the spot.
I don't know.
It sounds good, Bob.
I'll do it with Slice and Watermelon.
Benjans has never been so beautiful.
Heavenly sword.
They took to the team.
Wow.
Hmm.
What is that?
I don't even know what it is.
Anyway, Suzanne Goldberg, or this is right in line
with Cindy Sheen's comment, I just read.
See how I try to piece this all together,
but in the middle of that.
Well, we're going to have second period Leafs lost,
by the way, an exhibition game to Phoenix to Wayne Gretzky.
Needle knows.
Three to two is the final score.
Just in case you missed it.
George missed the game last night.
Were you at the Air Canada Center?
I didn't see it there.
I was near either.
Hello, we get shot away here, and then nobody takes someone
to go to the net, fix up his early bomb at score.
Where's my good buddy, Joe Bowen?
Oh, the Leafs found three-one, heading into the third period.
Had you liked that for a talk-up?
I thought that was really good.
I think Joe would have been impressed.
Refugees in their old land, two-million or backies
forced to flee their homes right.
Suzanne Goldenberg.
I'm the AcommonDreams.org.
Nearly two-million or backies have become refugees
in their own land in the past year.
We drawing the ethnic and sectarian map of Baghdad
and other cities are reported by the Iraqi Red Crescent
said yesterday, and Baghdad alone, nearly a million people
have fled their homes.
Last month, so the sharpest rise so far in the number of
Iraqis forced to abandon their homes, 71.1%.
The forced migration raises questions about claims
from the Bush administration of the civilian protection plan
at the Corvettes worst rate as he is making Iraq safer for Iraqis.
Right.
Instead, data compiled by Red Crescent's staff and volunteers
at Iraq's 18 provinces suggests many Iraqis have failed
to find real safety or sustainable living conditions
after being forced to leave their homes.
Some families have been uprooted twice,
even three times in search of safety, affordable housing,
functioning water, electricity, adequate schools, and jobs.
More than three quarters of the displaced were women
and children under 12, reducing families to poverty
and compounding the sense of social dislocation.
The men who were the breadwinners are no longer part of the family.
They either fled or joined armed groups.
The report said, the vast internal exile began after the bombing
of Shia shrines at Samara in February 2006,
ignited Iraq's sectarian war.
Thousands of Shia's fled Sunni majority neighborhoods
and headed for the south where they are in the majority.
Sunni's fled Shia enclaves for the north and west of the country.
Christians also left their homes in Sunni areas for a Kurdistan.
Some two-minute Iraqis left the country.
Sounds like a bunch of crazy religious nuts to me.
Oh, excuse me.
Now a wave of further migration is underway as Iraqis discover
they can't survive in their original havens.
Unlike the earlier flights, the current movements
are not easily categorized by ethnicity.
Our understanding is that people are just moving
to where they feel safer, said Tim Irwin,
a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Washington.
Although Baghdad is divided largely on ethnic lines by the Tigris,
with Sunni's on the West Bank and Shia's on the east,
some Iraqis are seeking safety and mixed in more sectarian neighborhoods
which have a better level of services.
You know, things like electricity, water, things like that.
It was fair to say at the beginning of the movement
that it was ethnically based and religious based,
Mr. Irwin said people were moving to areas
where their ethnicity was in the majority,
but with these secondary movements, these third movements,
people are continuing to look for safety and security
that may be in homogenous areas or may be in more mixed areas.
The data from the Iraqi Red Cross suggests that violence
followed many families to their new neighborhoods
forcing a second flight.
In other cases, families were forced to move on
from shoulders and schools or government buildings
because they were being sheld.
Some families were made to feel unmoving
in their place of refuge.
The local authorities in the Jaff and Kribbel
offer example have refused to take in migrants who weren't born there.
Others moved because they were becoming a burden to relations
who had taken them in.
Or you know how that is?
The relatives, they unpack the suitcase now.
You're ever going to leave? No.
You know how that is.
You are there aren't you?
I'm right here.
No, okay. Right. Just checking.
You know. Just double checking.
You can never have had too many times.
Still others left because there were no schools for their children.
Schools witnessed a significant increase in the number of students in each classroom.
Many schools are operating two shifts to accommodate the growing number of students' reports.
The constant movement and lack of amenities have taken a heavy toll on the fabric
of Iraqi society to report warrants.
Some teenagers who lost loved ones joined the armed groups
and started taking revenge on innocent people from different ethnic groups.
Rape armed gang, theft, drug addiction was commonplace.
It said the overall picture is that of a human tragedy unprecedented in Iraq's history.
Sounds like we're doing a hell of a job.
Nice going W baby.
Abu Gar-
That's where he ought to be behind bars, along with all of his henchmen.
Dick Cheney and Rumi, the whole crowd, they ought to be behind bars.
And also some of the generals too.
Like general betrayers.
1041 on the survey, we got a sixth arrest in the OJ case.
One more could you want. We have an update on the OJ travel.
One more can anybody want, right? Right.
What kind of- what is with him?
What are you talking about?
Was that Chris Laffin? No, it was Woody Grayburn.
Oh, Woody Grayburn is there.
What the hell is he doing in there? You still have to pony-sell Woody?
You bet you.
Yeah, I bet he does. What a silly person still living in a time warp living in the 60s.
I bet you wouldn't did some good drugs back in the day, you know?
Back in this morning? Yeah, in this morning, him and you.
That's probably what's going on there right now. And what if you mean Woody,
when you're working for fat ass jolly joebell,
you better start taking a lot of drugs, man.
A lot of drugs, whatever you got.
You got heroin, coke, ludes, you got your ecstasy, anything.
I need to be an ecstasy, man.
Today Woody brought me a big steaming bag of crack.
Do the-
All right.
And you know something, I think it's time to take the pipe.
It's fresh, it's popping.
It's time to take the pipe, baby.
That fat ass jolly joe, he's doing it.
That's what Bruce Beasley says.
Great, great trend, guys.
Great trend all the way around.
Man, you guys are just the best.
Can't you just witness it now?
Now, now we're going to be sitting around her plastered over there in Naples.
Just all laid out on the floor, you know.
I'll slumped over their desks.
I'll slumped over each other.
Joyce didn't over there, you know.
She's probably the pivot girl.
Or shouldn't have said that.
Oh, we're going to get a lawsuit from Joyce.
She said something terrible about Joyce.
Ain't no part of the sounds anymore.
I should just play that whole thing the whole deal and just keep playing until two o'clock.
What do you think, Woody?
What's Woody doing there?
Is he bringing you tickets for something?
I'm talking big bag of drugs.
No, it's just, what are you doing these days, Woody?
Well, we are taking over the Jackie Gleason theater and making it a film more Miami Beach.
Oh, sounds boring.
Actually, I could get my new car this afternoon, drive to Buffalo and say, hey, Woody Gravers says hi everybody.
And the bills suck.
You know who the bills are playing this week?
New England.
Yeah.
Now, what do you think is going to be the score in that game?
About 50 to nothing.
For New England.
Buffalo blows and soda of a bill.
Awww!
Hey, man.
Well, listen, you're in that car back.
I beg your pardon?
He thinks they got a quarterback, but they don't.
Oh, yeah, a Luzman.
Luzman.
The name?
Luz.
Underline the Luz part.
He sucks.
Well, listen, have a great life, Woody.
It's nice to touch and base.
Always have a partner.
Make sure it is.
26 past 1, a Q&A.
It's Friday, you bastard.
Senator Larry Craig is denying any wrongdoing.
Despite a guilty plea, stemming from an incident in an airport men's room.
A defiant statement from Idaho Senator Larry Craig.
I am not gay.
I have been gay.
I go.
I go.
All right, let's have a little coming out party.
Come on out and show up for the guy.
I will.
You will go.
I am not gay.
I have been gay.
I go.
I go.
I go.
I go.
I go.
Hello, I am a.
In 1982, the newspaper reported Craig had sex with a man in a bathroom at Union Station in DC.
But now I know your gay, so it's all good, girlfriend.
This is CNN, breaking news.
Senator Larry Craig is denying any wrongdoing despite a guilty plea stemming from an incident in an airport men's room.
Senator Craig, thanks for the interview.
Do I know you?
Have I met you before?
No, don't think we've met.
And could you get your hand off my knee?
I am gay and I cruise and I get on this.
Not interested, Senator.
So how do you pick up guys?
I make eye contact.
I smile at people.
They recognize me.
I go around anywhere hitting on men.
There is one thing I do.
I seek and ask.
Oh, thanks for coming by, Senator.
I hope Idaho and...
will allow me to continue serving gay people at the Minneapolis Airport.
CNN, breaking news.
This is Iowa, Miss News.
A government watchdog blew files in ethics complaints against Idaho Senator Larry Craig.
An undercover police officer said Craig made a sexual advance for him in a restroom at the Minneapolis Safe Paul International Airport.
Craig now says...
Do you want to touch my monkey?
Craig went on the offensive, denying involvement in a gay sex scandal involving Congressman and underage pages.
Help!
He's sucking my special area!
That is a bad place to touch.
No!
I mean, we're touching each other.
In a statement, he said, quote, they were misconstruing my actions.
I extra-touching my penis.
Dispiked meeting guilty to this orderly conduct, the Senator denies any wrongdoing.
They didn't even ask you to touch your winner. He is offered it!
He already resigned a prominent role in the Mitt Romney Proplacement campaign.
Take a walk pervert.
Wow, it's pretty funny stuff.
It's most amusing when self-righteous, hypocritical, right-wing lunatics pull crap and they get caught.
They're so, they were just happening.
Even George is happening right now.
That's probably because he just saw his good buddy of Woody Grieber.
You know it.
That's what they call him Woody.
It's going to be a great weekend.
133 at 560 WDQ. I'm happy Friday to.
If I'm all excited about going to get that car now, you know?
Because it just opens up so many possibilities.
Many of them are not good, but nevertheless.
Life is supposed to be exciting, isn't it?
You betcha.
Well, I'm going to make it real exciting.
In fact, every day when the show is on, assuming I come back on Monday, I could tell you it's new and hey, guess what?
I'm going to hop in a car and go to Woodbuy.
We figured it out.
George and I figured out before the show today the amount of money that I pay in the grand fair a year and two years.
Yeah, in two years it would more than cover the cost of the car.
Right.
And since I've been here going, I've been here a long time.
But since three years, I've been going to Woodbuy.
That means I've spent what do we figure out about 54 grand for cabs in three years?
Not to mention the money I've lost there, which I mean, if I told you that, you break down and cry like a woman.
Well, like a little girl, like a little girl, maybe.
Like a little child, yeah.
But so, you know, it's going to save me a ton of money.
Is that a good way to rationalize?
Sure.
Well, I'm nervous about driving here.
I'll tell you that.
I'm going to say it again.
I know nobody believes me when I say this, but it's true.
Because people say, oh, no, no place could have worse drivers than here.
Well, guess what?
Well, bad guess.
That's a statement, C.
And I have to take your wordports because you have driven here.
See, if anybody that never experienced South Florida were to say that, then I have to say that they're wrong.
The thing of it is where I live in Florida, out there in, you know, in the acres.
And of course, there's no picnic there, like on sunrise, you can get killed trying to pull out a best buy.
You know, that little, you don't even know you know, that's not your area.
Right.
But even you kill just trying to pull out and especially to try to make a left turn on the sunrise, you're going to be dead.
They need a traffic light there, okay, before another 100 people get killed, they won't do it.
Idiots.
So there is some chaotic driving and then of course the soil grass.
And then it's just not the same, but here the city is so congested.
There's five million people here.
And you've got all these old Chinese people.
And you've got all these old India people and ragheads from a very, every kind of raghead, you know.
And a lot of bad drivers that can hear in about all of you, the driver test there is really very difficult.
Well, if that's the case, a lot of these people must have found it under their bed or on the floor somewhere they must have found their license.
Oh, it's in Los Angeles during his first trial.
OJ's girlfriend.
She's more than 20 years his junior.
Wow.
By 1999, they were both living here in Miami.
That year, a 911 call placed by Simpson from Prote's apartment.
Anybody there need rest here?
I've been doing drugs for two days with f***ing.
We just got arrested.
It's a fucking cocaine.
And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now.
Police said the woman was Prote.
From behind her door, Prote says she wasn't even there.
Thing is that a total misunderstanding.
It's had nothing to do with OJ and I.
No problems between the two of us.
This is a friend of ours.
Nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with my girlfriend and me.
So don't go there.
Don't go there.
There are great people who know Simpson and Prote only one.
Prote's uncle would talk with us.
He's not even a lonely says, quote.
She's a good kid.
Oh, fine time, I was good one.
She keeps a low profile.
She doesn't seek the limelight.
And quote.
But the limelight finds her.
In 2000, Prote is caught using Simpson's handicap parking decal.
And she's arrested on a bench warrant for driving with an expired license.
They had an on-again, off-again relationship.
And during one of the off periods, Prote gives an interview to the national inquireer about cocaine use and abortions saying, quote.
For years, I could never admit that the man I loved could have killed his ex-wife and cold blood.
And quote.
She adds quote.
But I no longer believe in his innocence.
And quote.
But she always ends up back with Simpson.
Between 2000 and 2006, Miami-Dade police have responded to 11 incidents involving Prote.
From a hotel altercation with Simpson to allegations, she stole Perkis said and Zan acts from a neighbor.
Charges were never pressed.
I'm in shock.
Do or stop.
Prote was a victim, too, of a break-in at a apartment.
It must have taken place sometime a while without what I was with.
O.J., all night.
And now, while Simpson remains secluded, it's Kristi Prote forced into the spotlight to defend her man, whether she likes it or not.
Jungs are all a CNN.
Miami.
And I'm all right, John. Right there from Miami. We're all a scum eventually winds up.
Like from Raleigh. Raleigh North Carolina flows downstream, man.
1054 on the pole.

And Bruce Beasley says, hell, they're a job there, Johnny.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, great job. What a number.
Yeah, what a number.
Why, you know, you can't live in the past.
Once upon a time, we were talking to a whole lot of people.
And now we're like kind of talking to each other. But we're getting paid.
I'm getting paid big money for it. You guys didn't pay enough to barely scrape well.
We get food once a week.
And you get free food. You get free lunch a week.
Well, that's true. We get free food whenever the how we want to.
You get free food anytime you want. Call up our good buddy at Tonys there.
And call up a how he's.
Are we at how he's?
Anybody like in every Thursday you get the Neil deal people?
Sure.
Or more could you want? Money.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that'd be good.
The 16-day running spree of a wanted Santa Lucis high school drama teacher ended yesterday.
When the US Marshall Service arrested him in the Southwest Florida motel.
Andrew Foster, 27, had alluded to the 30th since September 4th.
When he was accused of having sex with two 17-year-olds students at the school,
West of Lantana and in his point in the beach department.
Police said he got one of them pregnant.
And a company heard to an abortion clinic where he signed medical papers in her behalf.
We've been working pretty hard to do this.
Get this guy locked up. Say Deputy Marshall, Lynn Novitsky.
Deputy Marshall's in the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Tactical Unit sworn in as Marshall's.
Learn Foster was in Caliore County and started checking small hotels until they found him about 3.30 p.m. in a mockery.
Oh boy. Maybe that's what I'm going to drive to a mockery and see some of my good engine friends.
Foster was in room 4 of the budget in 504 East Main Street.
And it's 42 miles north east of Naples and about 130 miles from Point and Beach.
Well, we know that.
Being Florida people, we know that.
And of course this is in the Sun Sentinel. So why the hell do they write that stupid stupid?
When Marshall's knocked and announced their presence Foster looked out the window and opened the door in a bit.
He said he was arrested without incident.
He was wearing blue shorts and a green t-shirt.
It was clean shavon.
He had a few hundred dollars on him was driving a rental car.
You know, surprise they don't tell us what kind of car it was.
You know, we got every other detail whether the tank was half full or three quarters.
He was alone, she said.
Marshall's drove Foster to the Palm Beach County Jail, where his book on churches of unlawful social activity with a minor.
Child abuse, transmission of child pornography, biodechronic device,
and transmission of harmful material of the miners, all of these things.
Well, it goes on. There's more to it.
Yeah.
What goes is all this crap going on all the time.
Got the one girl pruggling, man. I mean, you know, what happened sometimes you want to dittle?
Yeah.
A little bit caught in the middle. That's right.
And get screwed a little.
I can't say we're screwed. That's right.
Because fire would dump that.
Who was it that dumped that?
Whatever.
The Fox thing.
I don't know what it was.
Fox dumped it on the M. He's real watched the M. He's because we don't watch any of those shows.

plays Hansi Pope
compel the spirit of Christ compel me to play it i'm so inspired to started reading a book because it's it's uh it's all we got man if that's it
I mean we got that and we got that that's about it anyway that the student and my t this is it's just so typical and my
t student with what police feared was a fake bomb attached to her chest was arrested at gunpoint today looking
at international Boston later claimed it was artwork star Simpson nineteen at a computer circuit board and
wiring and plane view over a black hood at sweatshirt she was wearing said state police major Scott
paray the commanding officer of the airport she said there was just a piece of art and she wanted to
stand out on career day she claims it was just art she was proud of the art and wanted to display it
Simpson was charged with disturbing the piece and possessing a hopes device and is going to be
arranged in east Boston district court this afternoon I'm shocked and appalled at somebody would wear this type of
device to an airport for race said well skew is me Simpson was extremely lucky she followed the instructions or
deadly force would have been used she's lucky to be in the cell as opposed to the morgue she's an MIT sophomore from Hawaii
the battery powered rectangular device had nine flashing lights Simpson also had play dough in her hands
the phrases socket SOC KET socket to me and course six course VI were written on the back of the
sweatshirt which authority is displayed in the media course VI appears to be a reference to MIT's major
of electoral engineering and computer science Simpson was a member of MIT's swimming and diving team in
2006 according to the team's website which lets your hometown as somewhere in Hawaii she was arrested
about eight o'clock this morning outside terminal C home the United jet blue and other carriers at
Massachusetts for authority staff for manning information both in the terminal became suspicious
when Simpson wearing the device approached a mask about an incoming flight Simpson then walked
outside the information booth attended notified a nearby trooper the trooper joined by others with
submachine guns confronted her to traffic Ireland in front of the terminal she was immediately told
to stop to raise her hands not make any movement so we could observe all her movements even of the
ball variety this is she was going to try to trip any device actually not followed protocol in my
view is deadly force police said Simpson took a subway to the airport wasn't sure if she had a
device on at the time she told authority she was at the airport to greet somebody on a
arriving flight from Oakland authorities verified information is to the name of the person she was
greeting and said he already left the airport she did seem to have been upset she was in custody
however she was rational to answer all questions is required the major praise the booth the ten of
said instance a reminder the terrorism threat confronted the so a saliviation system two of the
four passengers hijacked and eleven took off from Logan in this day and age the threat continues
to be there for recent she certainly jeopardized her own safety by bringing this to the airport as
well as the safety of everybody around her and she goes to MIT baby like that you know I mean
I didn't know there was a thing the city was the focus of a major security scare January 31
when dozens of battery power devices were discovered in various locations bomb squads were
deployed in the highways bridges some transit stations in Boston temporarily were closed they
