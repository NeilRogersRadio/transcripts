Joan Collins speaks of romance.
I've loved hundreds of men over the years.
Okay, just this morning.
Hey, guys.
That's why I've created a perfume to be guile to a trun.
But you can't really come up.
If you can, it's exactly the same as what you do.
Joan Collins, floppy seconds.
The perfume to have to be your having more than one.
Like my perfume.
You know you're thin.
Apparently you say Joan Collins, floppy seconds.
Every morning I'm a model, atomizer, or fire extinguisher size.
With a very similar setup, we got a beautiful board.
We're sitting right out here by the water.
It's polatial.
The pelicans are dropping on the rent of cars.
And this is great.
Are we on?
Are they getting anything?
Hello, America.
I feel like Lloyd Lindsay Young with no math.
We still don't know.
Got a bird is here.
Yeah.
And we're just talking to each other.
And the engineers who got their finger in their...
Miami lost it.
Oh, we're gone in Miami.
Oh, right.
They brought one.
And Jan was born down there and he can't find it.
Uh-oh.
Has none of this been on in Miami?
No.
But it's good practice.
It hasn't been on in Tampa either.
So no.
Been on in the production room.
Oh.
That's good.
We can do a show for the guys in the production studio.
How do you like it so far?
I can't fit either.
No, not in the production room.
Are they going to give us a signal when we're on here?
I can't fit either.
I can't fit either.
It's on.
It is.
It is.
We're on.
I just like saying that.
It's great.
It's great.
It is just like this.
It's over.
It might be.
It might not…
It's great.
It mightник out.
Right, Darbright throttle.
It might not be.
Are we on in Miami either?
I think nobody's on.
I might drop you.
It's 75 of the Paul Beaches, 89 degrees in Miami.
For引 I still have been from the radio.
Hey, worth me $50.
Some times I steal the bits from the Neil Rogers show.
Hey, that's ponderous, you dishback.
Oh, really, really.
Then I steal them and I make them mine.
I have the creativity of a fly.
I steal bits from the Neil Rogers show.
It may not be as bad as it will think, so I, uh, alright,
let's take another call. I'm tired of this. I'm hanging up on you.
Join us this afternoon to getting it to for those wild and crazy guys,
Rick and Suts, and at six, it's sports dogs six ten.
Come on you, I don't need.
This is the Neil Rogers show.
Right, sure, 100.
Don't keep you up.
I don't need any questions.
We're going to be doing this for two hours.
Huh?
Are they hearing us?
This is a set up.
It's open hiding under the board and they're a one.
All the S you went, people have been taken hostage by a J-Core,
and OP is behind the whole thing.
It's a plot.
It's a plot.
What they don't understand though is we're used to this.
We enjoy it.
We're having a good time.
It really brings back some old memories.
Oh, yeah, the best.
So we're not on the air right?
Guys, they say nothing.
They don't say yes or no.
Yeah, in other words, they don't know what the hell is going on.
So let's just say a few choice words.
Now that Clinton's in here, we'll see, then we'll get an answer, I bet.
Huh?
What's the deal?
Tom?
Belvita?
What's the deal, Tom?
You said your box is too low and the birth's too high.
Oh.
But how come we didn't hear the card?
We heard the card.
You did?
We heard the card.
We didn't hear it.
We sure as hell didn't hear the card.
We heard it was great.
Oh, the Neil Rogers show.
Well, how come we don't hear it?
Why didn't it have to be in Q?
Dave Slenzky, Chief Engineer.
Wait a minute, let me try it again.
Okay.
Now I want to hear it.
I don't hear it.
This is the Neil Rogers show.
I do not hear it.
Now either I hear it.
This is the Chief Engineer.
Any question of income in Q?
So I can hear it on a year?
What is he from like the Mitch Wien School of Engineering this time?
Get out of my face with this guy.
This guy wouldn't know a card.
He's a little bit of a woman.
I've loved hundreds of men over the years.
I'm like his own.
That's why I created a perfume to be guile to a bra.
But mainly to cover up.
Any idea what I'm doing?
You're with this Bjorn Collins floppy second.
The day to the hour.
The perfume to have when you're having more than one.
Like my perfumes, man.
Nothing worked.
It's getting you only product.
It's just like Bjorn Collins floppy second.
In bottle, atomizer, or fire extinguisher's eye.
Come in any minute now.
I don't think he's going to come in here at this point.
I can't blame him.
Well, I want that to be great when some people are in here alone playing with a succulent
equipment every day.
That'll be really great.
So what's the deal?
Are we on?
We don't know.
We don't know.
Why do you give me headsets?
What's he going to do?
He won't hear the card.
We have...
Can I have this fresh...
You're going to aim one at each of us?
I'm going to aim something at you in a second.
Believe me.
Okay, anyway, it's 10-15, 10-14, something like that.
And we're on the air.
We don't believe we're on the air.
I think they're just pacifying that.
We don't go ballistic here.
Nobody's on the air.
It brings jokes.
It brings back this big flood of memories from Zeta.
Yeah.
He just comes to the air.
George, we've been taking hostage.
Please call emergency immediately and get us to hell out of here.
Anyway, I get in here yesterday afternoon.
Tom Velvita and Todd.
What the hell is Todd's last name?
He doesn't have a last name.
Lisa is in a Lisa Campbell.
And they meet me at the airport and I get my rental car and they give me directions and I go to a polatial.
I mean an incredible hotel.
And I'm like, what are they call those things?
Like in the penthouse.
I mean, in the suite, the most beautiful, the most incredible, and really polatial.
You just couldn't believe it.
Knock your socks off.
And of course, they didn't wear any socks.
And then they picked me up and took me to an incredible, and he walked out of here again.
To a phenomenal Italian restaurant.
I must say that's immediately the food in Tampa is, if that's a barometer.
Yeah.
Because we know Bernstake House, everybody knows that.
And we know Crystal and Stake and Shake and you bet.
But they took me to an Italian restaurant on Dale Maverick, which is just down the road from Crystal.
And right across the street from the very prestigious building pancake house.
And it was tremendous.
Tremendous.
I'm telling you.
What are you laughing about?
Well, you know, you're having change.
He's still laughing.
It's not funny.
It's not funny.
He's still laughing.
I was just thinking about that.
Is this an audition for the Joey Reynolds show?
Not at all.
I'm telling you, I just knew there was a reason why he came here so early.
It's an audition for Joey.
Bill Marshall is getting still.
He just can't, like you can.
He can't.
He can't do it.
He don't have it.
The original is always the best.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
That's what Joey says doing in his case.
Trust me.
It proves that old things aren't always true.
So anyway, we have this tremendous meal.
And then, Velvita takes me back to my hotel.
I go back up to my polatial.
I mean, there's like a bath.
They put a bathroom about for you.
And there's like a dancing violinist.
And, uh, well, now most.
And here's a big platter of like vegetables and dip.
We're a said dip on it.
I think they were talking about me.
And, uh, seriously, in the many bars like having your own convenience stir up there,
they are really doing this right.
I want, and I called up Randy on here.
I was so excited.
And I want to repeat it again.
Everybody on our staff, including Rick and Suds and Randy.
Uh, I was going to say in gym, but I don't think I want to say that,
because he might take me up on it.
Should kiss me all over my body, because I, we had a tailgate party a week ago Sunday,
the one for the San Diego game.
And Bob Green and little Torpey Bob, have you ever seen him with David Paul Neal?
Show up at the tailgate party.
And I just seized the opportunity, you know, because Bob Neal is such a,
when a guy has like an imposing presence, like Nick Tregoni,
I'm not saying he's imposing, but he does have somebody,
does have like a broken nose.
So he really knows some important people.
And you don't want to step on his toes.
But Bob Neal is such like a nebush.
And so you don't have any compunctions about like jumping all over him,
just grabbing him by the neck and picking him up and just shaking him all over it.
Like get some crap done, man.
Take care of us.
Treat us like stars.
So we have gone from originally was going to be, I'm the only one coming over.
Yeah.
I'm going to have to hitchhike.
They're going to put me up at the YMCA from that kind of an ambiance to royalty treatment.
We've gone from one extreme to the hysterical opposite,
where everybody gets, uh, Randy's getting a Lincoln town car when she comes in today.
No.
Oh, yeah.
You're serious.
Yes.
Yes, I am serious.
You know what it's going to be like when you go back home to IOD.
To be pressing.
Yes.
And I hope that Mitch Wien is listening right now, by the way,
because we're sitting here.
We got a polatial.
I got my own board.
I can control the levels.
I can shut his mic off, which I'm looking forward to.
Yeah.
There we go.
It's like kyle eyes.
Yeah.
And we got like equipment up the ass here.
If I can say that and we got these beautiful.
What are these?
Deenon.
Deenon.
The CD players.
CD players.
I mean, like state of the art that you put like we have on the coast,
that we can't have on the AM because it's only a puky AM station within a cheermer day.
Yeah.
Right.
So this is like downtown, man.
Plus.
Plus we have WSU and country music fans.
Yeah.
We got country music on a stick.
Yeah.
So for those of you who loved Rick on a stick and Neil on his stick,
you're going to love picking your nose on a stick.
Or with a stick.
As a matter of fact, it's got like a little thing in there.
And it says right nostril and left nostril and shows you which one you can pick with.
I want to try again.
Can I try a cart?
Which one?
Well, what did he do?
He said, okay, I'm going to point my head.
My head is.
He said, I'm going to point a head set.
What does that mean?
I'm going to point a head set at each one of them.
Well, it's there.
You get one side.
I get the other.
Are we going to hear it through there?
Well, let's see.
Let's try it.
Good question.
I mean, it could be four hours of agony or four hours of ecstasy all depending upon what you say.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was Bob.
Who?
I know where's the control for that.
Where's the level?
Oh.
Now, you're asking a lot.
Wait a minute.
Here we go.
How about if I crank that up just a minute?
This is fun.
Yeah.
That's great.
It's not you don't have the sense that you're on ear anywhere.
So I'm about to say almost anything now.
Not even close because you're so loose and so relaxed.
It's like a dry run.
Yeah.
Can I say that?
If you only have a thing we can say dry run now.
Nothing like being on the ear.
I'm not going to say just the runs, which I think I had after.
So what was the name of that restaurant, Tom?
Tom.
You know, I got news for you, man.
This guy has got a personality like my dog's ass.
This guy is such a...
The restaurant, the great Italian restaurant where we ate at last night, which all Todd kept talking about us.
How everybody had their nose out of joint and they kept doing it.
Like this.
Does that man want to live or not?
It keeps, oh, there's Guido and he keeps pushing his nose up to this side.
That's not a good way to make friends and influence people taught.
What is it?
Donatello.
Donatello.
I want to show you how much clout we got in this market already, okay?
Because having been over here like about 12 hours, everybody in this whole area should be over here kissing our ass right now.
Don't you agree?
Absolutely.
The fact that we even would put our signal into this place.
Yeah.
The whole world.
Donatello.
Donatello's?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
This man is on top of it.
God.
And if he ever gets off.
Now, here's the next excitement.
The phone calls are starting to come in.
Now, will we take a call?
Do you want to take one now?
No, I don't want to take one.
I want to take one.
I do a break.
Oh, yeah.
Let's see if it works, okay?
Hey, George, we're going to see if it works.
Here's a...
Now, wait a minute.
Are we going to hear the call the same way we heard the cart?
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
That was George.
That was George from Miami.
No, seriously.
Are we going to hear the caller over the headphones?
Hey, do the...
Put a lid on it.
Hot shot.
Okay, I'll talk to Guido about you if you don't cut the crap.
You want me to turn you on a little speaker?
We're going to hear it in a little speaker.
Okay, let's punch it up, George.
Like I said, for Lauderdale.
What the hell is going on over there?
Hey, yeah.
It works.
How time?
Now, where's that coming from?
Are we on or are we on?
Hey, that's part of the ambience that we enjoy, man.
Don't go peeing on our parade, okay?
Oh, I'm not.
I'm not.
Hey, let me see if this works.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, you're doing it.
We are doing it.
And...
So what's going on over there?
What are we missing?
Well, nothing today.
So far.
Tell them on the go at any good snuff films on there or what?
But I will tell you this.
When I drop Randy off at the airport, I'm going to tell her what a good time she's in for.
When you drop Randy off?
Yeah, I'm taking her to the airport this afternoon.
Who is this?
This is Lenny, the limo drive.
Oh, Lenny, the limo guy.
Yeah, I heard you, Lenny.
Were you listening last night when I called Randy with a great call?
Oh, I must have missed it.
What happened?
Like I said, he had to be there, Lenny.
No, I...
I was at the beer-ly.
We can barely hear you.
Now, is this going to control that level or what?
Wait a minute.
I can barely hear you.
Oh, yeah, I got it.
Yes!
Yes!
Let's hear it for the WSU engineering staff, man.
These guys are on top of it.
Neil, you're...
And if they ever get off of it, man, it's going to be big news.
You sound better on the phone now.
I could hardly hear you before.
Well, there you go, because I just cranked it up, man.
There you go.
I just reached over and cranked that baby one time.
No, it went to the like over there.
It's great.
It's beautiful.
It got like pelicans over here and it got like vast wilderness.
And you can smell the salt in the air and you can grieve, huh?
Are you in the mall?
Are you in the mall?
Are you in the mall?
Are you in the mall?
No, we're in the radio station where the polatial beautiful
state-of-the-art WSU engine can get off the floor studios.
Yeah, when you first went on, I was like, what's going on?
I heard all this mumbo jumbo.
Yeah, that's what we're here for.
It's lots of mumbo jumbo.
In fact, that's what we're having for lunch.
Mumbo jumbo.
There you go.
This is great.
Well, you guys sound like you're having a good time.
We're having a great time.
The bird is here.
We have a special surprise guest coming in any moment who may reconsider the whole idea
of the way that things go on.
So listen, Lenny, now what's the deal?
You're taking her to the airport.
I'll take her to the airport.
And I want you to tell her that the Tom Velvita and I, how do you like that?
The King and Queen are going to be there to pick, I'm not sure which is which.
Pick her up at the airport because Tom has never met her before.
Oh, OK.
I'm taking her up at two, so she should begin there.
Right.
And then I'm going to take her in her beautiful town car.
I'm going to go with her to the hotel and show her the polatial digs over there.
Get her situated.
It's going to be great.
She has never had royalty treatment like this.
Well, she may come off the plane suddenly.
I bring her a little bottle of champagne.
Great. Well, tell her just to rush up to me and kiss me all over my ass immediately.
Oh, let her know.
OK, Lenny.
All right, deal.
Have a great day.
Bye-bye now.
OK, so it's all working out.
This is exciting.
It's unbelievable.
Oh, my God.
The day is lost.
The day is lost.
It is all over.
Oh, I knew it.
I knew it.
So anyway, why don't we keep hearing that voice over an over 1028.
We're broadcasting from the the spik and span, the polatial, the so clean.
It's almost nauseating studio.
No, sir.
Stereol is the word that comes to mind.
It's beautiful, but there's a certain amount of sterility.
OK, like there's IOD.
No, listen to me.
There's IOD on the one hand, which is basically like a toilet because it's been abused.
And because people are there have no respect for the equipment and they write on stuff.
And it's like, it's like crappy.
OK.
And this is the ultimate other extreme where it's like so sterile.
It's almost like a like there's going to be some kind of open heart surgery in here.
Oh, that's an FLAA.
There's going to be the open heart surgery.
So anyway, I mean, it could be four hours of agony or four hours of ecstasy all depending upon what you say.
Look who just happened to pop into studio here this morning.
Bob.
Is Bob on tape or is Bob lying?
I will not talk about it.
Oh, wait a minute.
Listen.
First, I got your what phones.
What a pre-ordana and an asshole, man.
Hey, one head phone.
Yeah, just a minute.
Wait a minute.
Happy birthday to Adam.
We love you, sweetie.
Adam's like, what, ten today or something like that.
Adam's birthday today.
Adam is 22, 23.
Hey, that's the birthday greetings now.
Oh, you knew it.
I'm on after the micronary show.
Don't you understand?
Birthdays are an important part of our show.
I like what I was doing.
Yeah, that's for damn sure.
Not so fat.
And you either Bob.
Boy, I tell you between the two of us, we've lost like probably a whole Opie.
And what I was kidding about that.
And maybe even a Bob Neil.
You want head phones?
Yes.
Well, there are headphones here.
I don't want to damn things, but then I'm not going to hear.
I'll pass them over.
Go ahead, have some headphones, Bob Lasseter.
First, it's got to be.
Oh, pre-ordana.
Get your own headphones.
I want my headphones, Nurse Ratchet, well, God, get out of my face.
Here with a head phone.
See, they won't perform without headphones.
Oh, I can't.
Yeah.
That's what his wife said.
My fault.
Cheers.
His wife says he will not perform without headphones.
Ha!
Or at least part of it, anyway.
1030 at the WYOD.
What did the Schmendrichs down in Fort Myers must think of this?
All right, let's take a call while he's trying to get his body put together again.
Now, I don't understand what the OIC is.
So in other words, we've taken the lines and what we've done is I got it.
Clear water.
Hello.
Good morning.
Welcome to the West Coast, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What a tremendous.
The air is fresh.
The birds are dropping.
And it's an enormous stuff on our heads.
It's great.
Well, I was at the game Sunday and you signed my poster for me.
I really appreciate that.
Great.
I had a lady singing.
It was good to meet you.
Well, it was great to be head, man.
And I'm bringing my sister down to meet you down in clear water.
Great.
Clear water, mall Saturday.
230 to 430.
We want at least 5,000 people there, OK?
Kim the frog.
Huh?
Kim the frog.
Yeah, Kim the frog.
Yeah, she'll be there.
Great.
And from, hey, Bobby, what have you been up to?
Oh, the.
Bobby.
Wait a minute.
You know, you know, I can't wait.
I'm going to talk to the caller because I cannot hear the caller in my head phone.
You will not hear the caller in my head phone.
Oh, man.
You guys want to reconsider.
This man is the biggest prima donna in a business, OK?
I cannot hear the caller in my head phone.
You're not going to hear my nose head phone either.
Are you?
I don't know.
You hear it?
Go ahead, talk, guy.
Well, scouts and corks.
Well, you do hear the phone.
Well, wait a minute.
OK, get his cords untied.
OK, let's get the surgeon in here to untie Lanceters corks so we can get him to hear the damn thing.
I'm sitting here as long as I know that I'm on the ear.
I can function.
This guy's like, oh, God, he's got to hear those deep tones of his own voice.
We're reporting back and he's got his earphones.
Yeah.
Can you hear him now?
Oh, yes.
Better?
What's better?
OK.
Go ahead.
Now I can't hear the guy.
He's got a muffler himself.
Since he put the headphones on, man, it's not like somebody put a sock over your head.
He's got a muffler.
Can you understand what he's saying?
No.
No.
Can't understand a word you're saying, man.
You are so muffled, it sounds like you got 40 pounds of Bob Neal in your mouth.
Hey, so is Bob going to be down there tomorrow?
Bob is going to be at the mall Saturday.
That is correct.
He's going to join us for a little appearance just to say hi to his old friends in Tampa.
And just to irritate open.
Well, I'm working on the gel.
Bob Neal.
How about Tom Velvita's?
Tom's going to be at the, you know, marginal.
He's marginal.
Depends if he can get enough security.
I think he's afraid of you.
Yeah.
Well, listen.
So you're in the water?
Yes.
And how is the beginning of the show today?
It, like I said, it's definitely going to be the cheese on, but you have to show it in signal.
If you could get inside Tom Velvita's car and just take a whiff of the aroma of head cheese, seriously.
The aroma of head cheese in that car.
I have never seen anything so filthy.
So this question, so grotesque.
I mean, here's this.
They're really doing it up big, putting us in these polatial digs.
And he picks me up in a car that I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Himmler, man.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
I have a great day, pal.
I'll see you.
I'll talk to him on a douchebag.
Okay, wait a minute.
Go ahead.
Ditto on Daniela, your douchebag.
Oh, thank you.
See you, see you Saturday.
Have a great life and get out of her face.
Am I right?
Oh, you haven't seen his car.
So Bob Lasseter is here and what brings you by, Bob?
Oh, just a little neighborhood view.
I'm not going to pass him by.
I heard that you were going to be in town and...
He can't talk with the headphones on.
He can't talk with the headphones on.
What happened to my other Lasseter car?
This is a mess.
Yeah, and this is exciting.
All right, now Lasseter can take one or two approaches.
If he wants to be on Tel Amundo, no, seriously, he can always do...
He can always practice that or he can go back to...
To...
To his trademark, which means you're going to have to put a sock over your mouth
when you start talking on the station.
What?
What was that?
That noise.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
That.
That's you, man.
That's your trademark.
That's the mark that you've left that you imprinted on the ass of my irons...
By irons, from Tampa to Chicago to back to Tampa again.
We'll talk about Chicago.
I was bigger than you.
WLS should have brought my WS tingles along.
Yeah.
I would have been great.
That would have been nuts.
It would have been great.
Let's do a couple of hours on Camp City's Broadcasting and how much you love their ass.
And then we'll do the Lass Tours on J-Core.
Oh.
Yeah, that covers the whole show today.
I'll just get up and leave now.
Oh, right.
No, seriously, they are treating us so well.
I'm not used to this.
I'm going through culture shock because this is Cox Broadcasting.
Isn't it still owned by Cox?
You bet.
That's a monologue here.
As a matter of fact, when you work for this company for 25 years,
I didn't know this, but Henry Barrow told me this,
that some companies give you a watch when you retire,
and they give you a beautiful ring.
It's known as the Cox Ring.
What's wrong with that?
Well, after your first year you got a set of glasses.
Now, you noticed I would not have said that in Miami.
Okay, 1035 on EIOD Network...
Uh, Martha, I can't get up.
What do you mean?
Well, the older I'm getting, the tougher it is to climb at a bed and start today.
George doesn't know it, but this morning he's getting prune tang.
A brand new breakfast drink that will get him up and active before he knows it.
Here, honey.
drink this. Mmm not bad tastes like
cranberry juice and tuna. I'm feeling good. I feel like a good move of
mountain. Come here little muffin. Oh, George. Don't let age get you down. Try the
new breakfast drink sweeping the rest homes of America. New prune tang. Prune
tang. It stores everywhere. What's napple two
mothers? 1039. I W I O D and W S U N and W W C N. I hope I just are not thinking
about them today. Never hear about it. Don't feel bad Tony Allen. We just don't give a
crap about you today. Okay. We got more important crap going on here today.
Speaking of crap. So Bob Lasseter is here with his centaurian tones and I can just
hear that staff meeting at F L A this afternoon at noon.
Oh, see. There's that lady over there at noon. So what they do start Bob?
Oh, I don't start that crap. Don't start on the wrong foot man. I'm
going to hire me over. They found a better talent for them. Well, they hired you over
here. Bob Lasseter starts on W S U N any day now. Well, well, Monday at February
first, Monday, February first, a week from next Monday. Lasseter is going to be on at
what time? 6 to 10 in the morning doing morning drive. We finally got to leave it.
We finally got to leave it, which means getting up at about 3 30 in the morning every
morning and getting like two pounds of mucus out of your assinuses going to be a kind
of like a mad dog's breakfast diner where we'll be serving bitter coffee and I will be
the surly waiter. What the hell is that? I have no idea. In other words, you have no idea
what you're going to do. You don't need the money. The executives of the cocks they love
the idea. So here's the deal. All you and we I don't want to hear from all those old
ladies. Please, I'm begging you because it could clear the whole deal if I can use that
expression. It could shower the whole thing.
Things dry. Yeah, right. Trust me. If the first call about Lasseter being on S U N is
a call. Hello, Bob. It's so wonderful. We're so exciting. We're changing the water with
our philosophy bag. That's it. Why is it those calls are okay for you? That's why they
have the escape clause in trust me. Okay. So there you go. S U N Tampa Bay, Lasseter returns
and at just a time we saved it till about 20 of so that by noon they can have lots of
KO pectate for the F LA staff meeting today. I've been here since like, you know, the
crack of dawn. I've been hiding the I think they're ashamed of me. So in other words, this
is a first I was sanded the bird that this is one of the few times in a history of the
business that anything anything has been kept under wraps because I've known about it
for about what two weeks. Yeah, something like that. And it never seeped out. No, didn't
have a clue either. Didn't have a clue what was going on. No, absolutely. And nobody is
nobody's never do. Well, inside the building did not know about this. That's why they all
have sour looks on their faces now, but they'll get over it. And no, the good part of it
is nobody's getting canned. When you feel bad if people were getting blown out for you
to be on an arcade. Boy. Oh, man. Oh, you just broke his day. Yeah. You know,
what goes around comes around. So in other words, you would like to have some people feel
the same at us. And you got when you got your ass tossed out of L S. I know. Well, that's
not they just that's not really true. It's not really what happened. Yes, it is. It's
got fired man. I did. I fired crappy ratings. Wow. Terms of show. Wow. Did you have a great
show up there? It's a crappy station. Well, I what really happened in L S. I was doing great.
And then I called this friend in Miami and I had him. Yeah, your show every day and send
it to me. Yeah. And I sat home every night and I transcribed everything that you said.
And I went in the next day and did your day. I think you got that. I think you started
doing that about seven, eight years ago. When you started doing that. Oh, let's take a
call. Now let's get these phones smoking. I have no idea what's going on on the phone
because the phones are coming in down there. 524 W I O D in Broward 751 W I O D in day. You
cannot smoke in here. I not that I'm interested, but you can't smoke in here. No, seriously,
is that true or what? Well, and 1 800 944 W I O D on the Tampa line. That line should
be smoking as I speak. If that line isn't smoking now, if all those old ladies aren't just
just rubbing their knees together, man, there's something wrong now. Bob, Bob, do you know
where green leaf is? No, I've no idea. Let's do green leaf. Hello, green leaf. Good
morning. Green leaf is near Lakeland right where the bird apparently. Oh my God. They
were heard of it. Well, look. Yeah. Well, Neil, if if bird wants to, if bird lives near
Lakeland, he must want to live in a place where family trees don't branch. I'm telling
you, if you want to test the limits of their expense account over there and they took
you to Donatello, have you been to Donatello? Yes, sir. In my right is it tremendous. The
positive was a positive was some of the best I've ever had in my life, seriously. Have
him take it to I mentioned this one I call for to Armani's on top of the Hyatt West Shore.
Yeah. It's the best Italian restaurant. There's a beautiful view at night and there, I mean,
their credit card will smoke when they have to. Good. That's the idea. I even had dessert
last night. I haven't been eating desserts for a month, but I had a last night just to
boost the bill up a little bit. Oh, yeah. I'm real happy to hear you in Central Florida.
I'm glad that Bob's coming back. You can buy a lot of stock and depends because it's
going to go up over there. Uh-huh. I'm here. Here are your folks over here. Here are
new folks over here. It's great because it's like going back to go back to South Florida
where I used to live. Now I was in that hotel room last night waiting for a Rick Orrally
to show up because he drove over with his a cheerleading wife. And seriously, and so he
shows up a quarter after midnight with the carts and all the stuff I had to bring in here
this morning, which was a heavy box by the way, Riley. And so I'm listening to Randy
and I got so animated and excited. I caught around the year to tell her the good news about
how well we're being treated. And then I got to listen to the best of Nealtapes again.
And I was enjoying it. Oh, yeah. Which is frightening. Okay. But sitting over here in this area
and being able to hear like a real radio station, yeah. These people should be absolutely
just just licking us all over our body parts. Well, Neal, the next time you come up here,
maybe we can get you into Central Fort. He can over and trash the parks on the air. Great. Can I call
somebody a douchebag? Sure. If it'll end the call, you bet. Okay. John, a girl bank,
village branch, your douchebag. Okay. See you. Bye. Here it is. Everyone have to end their call
that way. No, they do not. They can do whatever the hell they want. They just can't start their call
that way. Are you going to start attacking my tremendous success in my eight-year and mid-day 25 to 54?
God what? I mentioned. I think you want to start.
Look at your book. That's right. That's right. My mom.
Who would you like? Go ahead. Who would you like to call a douchebag? Just go right ahead. No one.
How about Oopie? How about Oopie? Is it a douchebag?
It's disgusting term that shot about Oopie is a douchebag.
It's a W man pig. It's a disgusting term that should not be allowed on the air.
Is that his power pig? Yes. No, it's not his power pig. Yes it is.
Oh, I can't wait to tell those stories. Like what stories do I and not at FLA? Why I left
FLA? Yeah. Why did you leave FLA? Why don't I leave?
Not for my give, man. No, but I mean just a little taste, just a little tease.
A headline. Why? It's a little... Alaska. Alaska.
Alaska. Fair banks? Anchorage? I tried. Maybe they're going to get any more out of me.
Guys do this. Maybe the reason you're not at WLS anymore is your mic technique blows, Bob.
No, if I had headphones then I wouldn't have popped another one.
Well you have the headphones. What happened to them?
Heroboels. That's why it's mic. Heroboels.
I think that's why he got blown out of L.S.
Can't really hear bad mic technique and hard of hearing. Other than that.
No, seriously because he's got a really great voice but he just can't hear himself.
So he screams and shouts and gets raspy and then gets all psychotic.
What do you mean I scream and shout?
You have been...
You've been hysterical. You've been hysterical.
Yeah, I mentioned Opia in FLA and...
And that Randy might be about a month and a half ago.
About Opia.
Opia did.
Opia job?
I'll be back.
Offered Bob Lasseter nights.
For like three seventy five.
He did not offer you one.
He offered me the opportunity to audition for a night for nights.
Come back to hearing audition.
You know what auditioning on the air for a job in Tampa is like...
That's the station.
You got to get the job.
Can you hear Bob?
I don't hear him.
Oh, I see.
You know something?
Having this board, having controls.
This is what it's all about. It's like Zed again.
Yeah.
I don't have to put up with pompous asses like him.
I can just like shut the mic.
He used to do that to me, Bob.
Yeah.
You're both off.
Look at that. They're both off and they just say they're bop-bop-bop.
They're both off.
It's great.
It's power man.
It's like the power pig.
I could be like the next power pig.
And Bob could just be like the next pig.
Now Bob actually lost a lot of weight.
I want everybody, all the old ladies out there to know that Bob has lost a lot of weight.
Looks good.
Should we do a break?
1048, honey.
I would do that.
You two stop eyeing me.
Grab me some thighs.
I feel myself.
I'm like the guinea pig.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you have somebody said that a guido is lies and I got punched down.
What is it?
I wanted to put my finger on this piece of pita bread here.
Oh yeah.
I'm not trying to bring that.
I didn't bring the bird sandwich.
We can do it live.
You got to admit that Jim Skyler, man.
He took him a while.
He was a little rusty at first, but he has come back to great form.
You know what's interesting is he plays.
I believe he plays you in those bits and he plays me.
Think about it.
That is.
That's covering a lot of territory.
Boggles the month.
All right, let's take some of these calls because I know that Bob is.
His ego is very deflated.
He thought that the phone would just blow right out as soon as he made the big announcement.
Either that or they think it's a joke.
Let's do St. Pete.
St. Peter's bird isn't it?
Hello.
St. Pete.
Neil.
Yes.
Oh.
Hey, hey.
Yeah, I'm going to.
Soon as you made the announcement.
Do them in destruction when I get up in the morning with my coffee.
What's that?
That'd be great.
Butt butt butt butt butt butt.
You left that one where you go.
I have no idea what you're talking to.
The one where the one where he called you and went.
Butt butt butt butt butt.
You have poisoned their mind.
You had spent eight years of your life poisoning.
Oh, we go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're looking forward to an artist, sir.
But they need to get you animated in the morning.
You just start throwing things at the radio and just bang and scrap all around the room, huh?
What are you going to keep the Congress and all these other thoughts?
They're like, uh, they're going to go get Bob coffee in the morning.
They're going to be, uh, you know, go for it.
They're not being fired.
Oh, they're not being fired.
No, they are not.
And nobody's out the morning news gigs here.
They're going to be doing the news, man.
They're going to be around here doing the news and the weather and the traffic.
It's going to be your news weather and traffic station.
It's Cox Broadcasting, man.
And Bob is going to be reading the birthday list.
Oh, yeah.
And you think about which movie grossed the most of the box office and all that other stuff.
This day in history, the all the night.
The guest is older.
You're going to be going in with the fans, huh?
Then he can compare who's audience is older.
His or Mike Brennery.
You read the birthday.
Although I will say this, I'm sure that Bob's got a bigger.
Yeah.
Have the have the news geeks, guess?
No, what they need to do.
Well, they are.
Who wants to feed you?
I have the studio.
Yeah.
I have a great place in town called Bob.
Well, the bird was just sucking around for some free lunch, by the way.
Okay, because they got a great place in town where I eat.
It's got very good vegetarian food.
It's in the Italian place down in Forestry.
They're an issue in sponsor.
And it's called Pasta's.
You have a break in the city.
You must have a piece of that place.
I'm telling you, this is about the 85th time you called us about that.
You really believe that Neil's a veggie ball, huh?
But did I have any meat at that dinner last night?
Mr. Lasseter, Mr. Loudmouth, Mr. Fajita?
Did you order any from your plate?
No, I did not.
Did I have any from anybody else's plate?
Yeah, this man is still full.
That made me, you know, I mean, I don't know.
60 pounds myself doing the same thing.
Yeah, that's great.
Finish that prime red?
Well, listen, you're continuing to be one of the most
elucidating colors in history.
So you have a great day and a great life, okay?
And thanks for the big tip.
See you.
So you can call out like Mickey Mantle
when it's his birthday and then the news geeks can go.
Baseball.
Yeah, you know, it's great.
It's a great one.
That's what it is.
Isn't that what the show's going to be?
Mickey Mantle.
It'll be like Mike Greenery West, isn't it?
Let's do Miami on a star line.
I guarantee you they're not still there.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
You are still there?
Yeah.
What a guy.
Oh, man, I've been here for a long time.
I'm going to go.
Hey, I'm from Miami.
Got to tell you something.
I want to say it.
Drift back to real fast.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Are you listening to our show today?
Yeah, I taught douchebags.
Huh?
It taught douchebags today.
It is.
We've got a bunch of douchebags over here.
That is correct.
But I mean, don't you want to have like a little verbal intercourse
before you jump into that?
And just just no.
Well, no, wait a minute.
How he used to do two and three?
Just a pretend.
I shut his mic off.
And just I did.
And just pretend that you like had a read.
You wanted to call and say hi.
And it's great here in your.
How do let me ask you something?
How does it sound?
Oh, it sounds great.
I haven't seen you like in six months.
I saw you once in a piece a lot.
A long time ago.
Yeah.
And it was exciting.
Yeah.
We're going to be at Pizza Lop next Tuesday, 53830 in the BM.
Yeah.
I still have your sign autograph picture and everything.
Boy, here's the guy with the real life.
Like I said, who do you want to call?
Let's get this over with.
Who do you want to call what?
OK.
Let me just store this guy.
This guy is certified in everything.
I mean, he's certified in Fort Lift Operator.
Certified as a Lymphventory Clerk.
He's certified as a part of the company.
Yeah.
This guy has it all.
His name is Lewis Bellow.
Yeah.
And he works with me in the city.
And he's going to leave now.
He's going to be a certified Maytag washer dryer mechanic.
I think certified is the word for this car.
I see you got the right word for him.
Oh, man.
This guy has better over 20,000 women.
He says, and he weighs 280.
Wait, wait.
He's bent over what?
Over 20,000 women.
He's bent over 25,000 women.
What is he, a carapractor?
I don't know.
Sometimes we say the amount of weight he's better
or the amount of women, because it's very, very.
I mean, this guy says the first woman he had
was when he was 10 years old.
So I want to call Lewis Bellow a major, major, major lead
douchebag.
OK.
OK, thanks.
I knew there was something good coming at the end of this call.
Have a great life.
Now, I think there's a limit on those heavy machinery
often.
Audio limit.
Where did this carlager come from?
Where does this voice come from?
Who was that?
That was neat.
How long was he still on there?
Oh, George must be playing grab ass with that over there.
Well, it's Adam's birthday.
No, I was saying I don't think.
What?
What?
What are you getting on the air here for?
George?
Oh, man, this guy.
See, he's at the opportunity all of a sudden.
He's getting like Marvin now.
Pretty soon, he'll be driving around with Bobo.
Please.
Yeah, please.
So anyway, Rick and Sutts are going to be here this afternoon.
Aren't they going to have a good time?
Oh, boy.
You are going to have a good time when you head for them.
They don't even need head for them.
I don't know too many primadanas in his business.
You need head for professionals.
No, they do not.
Professional assholes.
You have to film Bob.
I don't need no head for them.
So where'd you go with that cut?
Now, let me ask you a question.
Are you going to be like you're going to do your show
in here right now?
I don't know.
Are we going to go about Don now?
Are we going to be talking about Bob being on S u?
And they must think it's a joke.
I don't know.
I think he will be in this room.
I'm pretty sure.
going back to Iowa. New department just got a report that like there are
tremendous massive crowds on the top floors of every building in town.
Huh? Is that mean it's time to jump? Everybody join hands and let's jump
together okay? Yeah. Well, it's just a tone in the voice. Nothing personal
but tone in the voice. They are depressing tone kind of like
you're good. That's the one. That's the one. That's the one.
My audience is mine. No, I'm I am building up the town. I am building up for you a
crowd. It's going to be there going to be that. I was big in the town. I was big.
Yeah. I have big numbers. Then the day when you needed two chairs to sit in this
damn place. Okay, now I should do the thing about the commemolus house. I have no
idea of what's going on with that. We had a little over 133,000 yesterday. We're
doing spectacular. We got our thing at pizza lot. Tone up Tuesday night five thirty
to eight thirty and the toll free number is one eight hundred eight five two
006. Is that right George? Is that right? I'll get lost.
Hi, this is Jim. Love your show. Nio. Love you. Love you.
All across the country people are eating beef or dinner. In Laredo, Texas, the
Bingham family is being poisoned by a bad butt loss. In Milwaukee,
Stan Fletcher is choking to death on a water-fulenium and in
Kittering name, the Johnson's are watching over Jean Havocornary.
The doc says the lifetime of eating burgers is blocked as arteries tighter than
a hangman's news. At the end of the day, nothing kills so many people in so
many different ways. Beef. It's what's for dinner.
Pick me up. Possibly your last dinner. Chop, pop. You know what I mean about this
guy? This guy belongs in his business like I belong before happy to see the
burgers that weigh an Arnold sound. Yeah. Now, I heard speaking of Bob, you
missed this because this was only on the S.U.N. news. Are you sure that you want
your mic this low? Uh, I didn't. How about like this? I'm sorry. This was the, uh,
this was the story that just ran on the Tampa news, right, which they did not
hear in Miami or the Iowa prestigious IOD network. And just like the old days
is eight hour, I will read this. I'll read it cold. It's got some good, it's got
some good words in it. The irrepressible area of
sight and always entertaining Bob Lasseter will join News Talk radio 620 WSUN
on Monday. That's where he's one. Yeah. Why are you making that face and sticking
your finger in your mouth, Neil? Lasseter will host WSUN's new morning show
from 610. The call informat will highlight his unique
interactive style with his audience. Brief news, cast and traffic reports will
keep his listeners informed as well as entertain. You got it, baby. You got it.
Lasseter's not my light. Lasseter's not my light. Well, somebody said it.
That sounds a lot like you. Lasseter's show will be the first local talk program to
originate from WSUN's Tampa Bay studio since the station changed to its News Talk format in June.
The balance of the talk show programming originates from WSUN's Miami sister in law station
WIOD AMA longtime favorite with Tampa Bay radio listeners.
Lasseter left the area in June of 89 to become the midday host
on Chicago's legendary WLSAM while announcing the hiring of Lasseter Todd P. Lesser,
Vice President and General Manager of WSUN commented, quote,
since changing the News Talk last June, we've received a steady stream of calls from Bob's
Tampa Bay fans requesting his return. Needless to say, we're delighted that we've been able to
honor their request. The way first is today's 6th and 8th Monday through Friday is the time
News Talk Radio 620 WSUN is the place for a lively entertaining start to your day.
Bob Lasseter is the answer from our information called Tom Belvida.
Okay, and it does say Belvida. It does say Belvida. Anyway, Joel is here, Frankenstein with
probably some grubs. So anyway, we're really doing it. It's 11.08.
Doing that begging for food. Yes, we're up. Of course.
It's a job with some crap. Okay, let's get these, George, let's do the 800 lines.
Okay, I want to see the tremendous respond. Old smart. Hello.
Hello. Yes, sir. Hello. How you doing? Welcome, Bob. I wasn't around to listen to Bob when he was
here before, but I'm looking forward to it. The reason I called you, Neil. Now it's over here on the East Coast.
I'm over here on the East Coast. I'm sorry. I think you're looking at like an upside down.
Stand facing the other way. Okay. Those people over on the East Coast, they're jealous.
About what? Well, first of all, we don't have a baseball team. They do.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We didn't have to suffer through the playoffs in football.
Yeah. We did. Yeah. We have a hockey team. They got one coming on.
Uh-huh. They're just extremely jealous. Yeah.
You're just not. I tell you something. We're having a great time.
I don't know if this would be a great permanent, but we're having a hell of a time.
It's great. Well, we treated like royalty. You think you saw some royal balls last night?
In this period of our attitude over here, we have filed suit today in federal court
to block you and Randy and Rick and Spud from leaving.
Great. That's really good. You know, I mean, I figured that's all the BS
that goes on between tap and Miami and we'll just turn around the other way.
Okay. Thanks for your load. Have a great day.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got a question for you.
You made a comment a whole month ago. You're talking about Bob Prince.
Yeah. And you said his wife controls his...
The tapes, yeah. Why wouldn't KDK control those?
Uh, because he didn't work for KDKA. He worked for the pirates.
And the pirates wouldn't control them?
No. Well, I mean, it all depends on the contract. Every contract is different.
And evidently, that was part of what he left, along with the empty bottles.
They were a bunch of them. Yeah. I mean, towards the end, he got...
He was pretty bad. He was coherent, yeah.
Yeah. I mean, remember when he came back and he did the ABC Monday Night Baseball?
Right. And he had the game in Pittsburgh and he gave him that incredible ovation
and he almost broke down and it was tremendous.
Well, listen, you're really a hell of a collar, but, you know, the time is up.
See you. Have a great life. Have a have fun.
The duck just fell. By the way, if that isn't the worst show that's been on in recent memory.
What? What? Uh, with Bill Cosby. You bet your life.
Oh, yeah. I've never seen him. Oh, my God.
Talk about him, man. Yeah. Run away. Ego.
That shows, uh, going soon. Yeah. Yeah.
They're going to rest. Run away. Ego. Yeah.
Now, and let me ask you about this first card. This card. You have a number one.
This card.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Tell them, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, that's from Telemundo.
You know, you can't see enough of those Telemundo tapes.
I think we may have heard that, though. Yeah. I think that's enough.
Okay. I don't know. So anyway, look, and we got Tampa and Tampa and Clearwater and
there they come. Antonio, man, the word is spreading like wildfire, like a gigantic
good disease. We're only 48 minutes away from the FLA staff meeting at noon,
where they're going to be handing out KO Pectate and the doggy bags and Jun Allison is going
to be bringing in some depends. Huh.
And they're going to be changing their food to the loom like every five minutes.
And of course, they're big deal. Oh, last and a we don't really care about that.
He's old news in Tampa. You know, the way they operate with everything like they don't
really care, but they will be taking, I mean, they will be taking every minute of every show
when you're on the air and they'll be writing letters to Arbatron and writing letters to a WLS
and everybody in America, you know, trying to make some kind of a thing.
I'm a little bit concerned. I don't see all I can possibly compete in this morning.
God, he had to die to my lady on himself up for a living. Oh, great.
I've made a mistake. We're going to try to go back and you know,
cart weight. I mean, listen, oh, we go. Yeah, you think it's muffled.
It's not muffled. It's just the way he speaks. He's like five yards.
He's like, hey, have a great day. It's like five yards off Mikey right hand over.
It's off like that. That's why I need headphones.
And the one we did in this market that can relate to stuff they can understand.
Oh, we don't know what he was saying, but he sure had a wonderful voice.
It was those soothing. I was the Neil Rogers of Tampa.
12 minutes after you should only live so long.

Lane is open. All right. Hmm. I think so. I said Derby Lane is open and they're
right up the street from the radio station. We passed the damn thing on a way
over here. It's like two minutes away from the radio station. I thought the
station was in Tampa. I didn't realize. Yeah. You have no clue what's going on. What
are you going to do with this crap? God. This is horrible. Okay. Let's do a
candle. Hello. Kindle. Speak to us. Neil. Yes sir. Hey. This is fabulous. We have
the bird back. The bird is back briefly. Yes. And he sounds like he has never
left. That's right. So he picked up right where he left off man. He's eating and he's
having a great time. He's cackled up the storm. Cackling up the storm. And Bob is
just eating and the eating and eating. Yeah. Did you bring the cart that I hate the
bird cart? No. Oh man. I wouldn't if I wouldn't realize he was going to play such a
prominent role in the show. I would have brought that foot. Well, history is repeating
itself today and just not all that bad. Wow. You're going to be. You hear that? Let
him come in. That let's end it. Compliment. In other words, that is the left hand
to come in. In other words, it could be worse. He could be coming back to stay, right?
Yes. Right. Please. He's looking good. He's looking fine. He's no worse for the
wearer. And he's looking good. He's added 20 years to his life by getting out of
business. Well, the reception here in Miami is kind of distant. What do you mean by that?
Well, you know, it's just not quite as sharp as it is. So, you know, something. This
is all psychological. I have and I do want to say this. No, sir, I'm glad you mentioned
that because we keep getting these calls probably OPs people because half our calls from over
here have been from FLA anyway. But we keep getting go all, you know, it just doesn't sound
right on SUN and there's something about the quality of their signal and the sound of
the. Let me tell you something. It sounds like we're sitting right inside the goddamn
transmitter. I listened yesterday and it's not really. It sounds perfect. It sounds great.
It's over here, doesn't it? Huh? Not over here. You mean today? Today, right?
Well, like on a scale of one to ten. I'll give it a maybe four and a half.
No. That bad? That bad. George, is it that bad? Yes. It is that bad. What's wrong?
Wow. What's the problem? What is the main thing? I just muddy and stuff. It's muddy.
Well, we don't give a crap about that. That's only when Lassiter speaks. It's not.
Oh, yeah. See? Muddy.
I call it Lassiter a deep back.
You Lassiter, yeah.
See ya. Great call.
What you're going to get. Oh, yeah, you like that call. He calls Bill Lassiter.
He calls Bill Lassiter a reduced factor. Are you going to take it personally?
I'm going to take it. Are you holding the bag for every Lassiter?
Are you using me for eight years now?
Further your career.
If we had a shovel in here, man, I'll tell you we could start now and by the time
Rick and Suds came out, we'd still be digging. That's how deep it is.
The last agreeable Bob, you played the worst swill I have ever had in my life.
And he worked for hours to cook that rice and to like pick the lettuce and tomatoes and
you pick them up, place or whatever. We'll get some other stuff in here, won't we?
Anyway, Tom is hovering around outside of Tom, Belvita.
Get in here Tom. Seriously, come here Tom. Come on.
Can you get us some good stuff in here for lunch?
What kind of stuff?
How about like some, can we get some pasta or something?
Not no meat. I'm not going to go back especially with Mr. Egor sitting here
over looking the operation. He went to the first week on that and what a BS artist
Neil Rogers, how he's eaten, like in the family members sitting there with your
beggings. Eat the bread from me. Yeah.
Join at any working. Can we work on something?
How about for getting warehouse? This is the worst crap. You eat it. You eat it.
Okay. Remember in Godfather 3 and she gives him the canola. He says, oh you're so skinny.
You eat it. Tom, you're so skinny. You eat it. Okay.
Staking shake?
Yeah, we got some canola for it.
Oh, oh. Staking shake.
Then I would go off my thing. I'm not going to do that.
No, go off your thing for you.
You see what an asshole we're dealing with here. I'm trying to get on the road to
better health and he wants to take me down to path to fat my arteries again.
One double steak burger, ain't going to kill you.
I'm not going to do that. I am not going to do that.
But she's not. I am not going to do that. No. No change.
What do you want? You're going to stay. You're an asshole, Tom.
What are you really on?
I want pasta in here. Don't ask them what they want. I'm the star.
Okay. I'm the one that you're putting the $8,000
night room up there in a penthouse. Get some goddamn food in here and cut the crap.
Go find some. Get on it.
I'm so sorry. I asked him to come out here.
He's going to go cook.
Huh? Yeah.
You're going to go cook this.
And I love it.
These guys are like incredible over here.
You're terrified of it.
You think that they had superstars over here or something.
We're just a bunch of slabs for my Annie, man.
Wait until you go.
That's like royalty.
This way till you go home.
Huh?
It's going to be incredible when you go back to the...
I'm going to let them.
Yeah.
What a let them.
Next Monday.
I'm going to have to feed the dogs in a whole bit.
Exactly.
Your dogs now.
I have two dogs.
Two.
I'm going to go jack.
Oh, she is.
Well, he's going to talk about it on a year.
God almighty.
I'm going to have many of you just kidding.
I'm sure I got it golden retriever.
You got one more retriever.
Hello.
What was the other guy?
Oh, my.
Miniature pincher, which I'm sure you can relate to.
Let's go to a table.
You'll leave me.
Tampa.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil Rogers.
Welcome to Tampa, sir.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome to St. Pete.
Isn't the other way around.
Yes, it's great to be here, man.
It is a phenomenal thing.
It is a great honor to speak to you, sir.
Damn right.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, how big.
I'm about six, two.
But my brother, my brother,
when you mentioned, sir,
that is what I meant as exactly what I meant.
OK, my brother went down to Miami for the relief effort.
And he started listening to you.
And he came back to Tampa and he said,
you got listen to Mr. Rogers.
He's a phenomenal man.
Mr. Rogers.
Well, you had to allow our respect for you.
So do I.
God.
Neil, man.
You're new.
I am.
But what are the kind of want?
I'll be real brief with my call.
I want to say, you know, go fins, go marlins,
go bugs and go lightning.
You know, we're all full radians.
I'm going to be it.
Now listen, are you going to feel,
are you going to the game tonight?
I'm going to try.
Now, you're not going to hate me like poison
because I'm going to, I will be under my breath going.
The Leafs go.
Yeah.
That's the, I mean, 35 years of being a maple leaf fan
doesn't end quickly, OK?
But that's the story.
I mean, I hope the, I hope the lightning wins all the other games,
like maybe another one sometime soon,
because it hasn't been too much lately.
But when you're playing the Leafs, you know, definitely.
Oh, yeah, it would be great.
Well, see you there, maybe, OK?
Neil, you're up.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello, sir.
Can you hear the Messiah?
Thanks.
Can I call one person a douchebag?
Sure.
You're on Jones.
You are the biggest douchebag I know.
Oh, see.
Oh, I didn't know you were the Messiah.
I didn't know that.
I just see my sandals.
But I'm scared of something else.
When you, when you please, I'm begging you,
get even like close to the mic.
I know you have the gigantic,
that brilliant voice.
I just want to hear from you.
I know you're carrying around those heavy-duty,
walking on the streets.
I understand that you find top like, you know,
gee, me, all the kind of dogs you have to be boring.
It is.
However, when your car is called up and say things like,
uh, gold fins, that you consider to be good radio.
Did you hear that car?
Bob, that car was like a living and breathing human being.
He was like under the age of 30, even, I would say.
Well, under the age of 30, you probably had acne.
Oh, he doesn't have any acne, man.
His skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom at times, right now.
Isn't it?
Oh, you've changed, Neil.
That's right.
Man, that piece is too big for me, Joel.
Anyway, it's 11.30.
Let's do a mobile in Miami, hello.
More than I can handle, yes.
Neil, man, porkers.
Yeah.
Oh, wait a minute, is this a pig me pork?
Absolutely.
I don't think I brought it.
I think I brought my, uh, pork.
OK.
Not bad.
Not bad.
OK.
It's on the Schillex pressway.
Just after the toll booth, there's five of them
over doing it, man.
Where is it?
Ah, Neil, Schillex pressway, 8.74, just north of the toll booth.
There you go.
Say, I found it.
That's caramel, no shock.
Have a rate they found.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
People tell you up in the top and they tell you where the cop's
We have pig me pork.
That's a pubic service, and it, what I'm idiot, what I'm
more on, you better get with it, please.
This is how this isn't old the time.
I mean, the times they are changing, Bob.
Yeah.
I remember the times are changing.
Please, soon.
Level 31.
And I'm glad you were here today because you're starting
to get the grief of what Neil radio is all about instead
of that old.
Hello, Bob.
What kind of a dog you think I have, Bob?
And I have the problem with sleeve.
God, I'm itching from head to toe.
Can I borrow Sally's instrument for just a week or two?
I'll bet you'd like to.
I'm not this kid.
By the way, the paramedics have been living
boards out there.
They've been bored to tears since she got married the other day,
like a week and a half.
Oh.
Oh, look at these yentos over here.
Look at this guy from.
Where are you guys from?
What TV station?
I sure hope it's 13.
He can't talk.
He says he's not allowed to talk.
He's not allowed to talk.
He can't even say what number?
Channel 10.
Channel 10.
Police from Channel, like I said, my favorite station
in this market, ABC.
I'm a professional anyway.
Oh, bro.
Who the hell is that?
You still want your job?
I watched something in here last night.
And of course, I haven't seen that many balls
in many presidential elections.
Have you?
I mean, there were more balls going on.
11.
There were 11 balls?
Yeah.
Even Bob came, man.
It's that.
Let's go to a two.
Clear water.
Hello.
Clear water.
Yeah.
Neil, welcome.
Neil, welcome.
Hard ball.
The mad dog, last setter.
Yes, we got a last setter.
Caller and he's out of the eight of a hundred.
Oh, Bob.
That's over, much.
God.
As Muffy.
Muffy's great.
I think you're pardoned.
Muffy's my wife.
Oh.
The Muffy.
And how is your dog?
How's Muffy?
Uh, but I don't know.
I don't have a few.
It's no one's Bob.
I, uh, uh, a Trophy, uh, lives with my sister in law now.
It's so be dead, OK, though.
Oh, yeah, as far as I know, it's
don't be going to make any guess the parents
remember how so for you to come with you?
Oh, sure.
Sure.
No, no, no, no, no, no, dogs and no smoking
in the studio here.

How the muffy.
Ha ha ha ha.
And Bob's boggling coming back.
Yeah.
Yeah, really coming back.
We're going to have live people over here.
Morning.
Six to ten.
Well, it's live as I am.
Yeah.
Well, that's kind of like I even thought
I heard the actual bird.
The actual bird.
It is.
It is the bird.
Yeah, amazing, isn't it?
And we even brought his original cage back over
from Lakeland to his men, right?
And a change of paper.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So this is an exciting day, sir.
Excuse me.
I said, I said, no, you're done.
Have a great day, pal.
You're going to get the oil with your sand.
Get him out of here.
Yeah.
I got a crappy phone.
It's feeding back and it sounds like crap.
Let's do St. Petersburg.
Hello?
St. Tweet.
You just did him.
Well, I did not just do him.
I said, clear water.
So there were a little behind in here.
OK, there were plenty of little grab ass
in the other room with each other.
Let's do.
Huh?
No, you have to.
You have to.
Try to read his lip.
Well, don't say that on there.
Don't start screwing around with us, George.
These guys in here and I got their crap together.
OK, so don't try to pull them over on us.
Do you guys have your crap together?
Yeah, they said crap's the word.
Let's call it a St. P. Hello?
Clear water.
Clear water?
Clear water?
Good morning.
So with the other guy, I was in St. P. I don't know.
I'm confused.
We'll get you in trouble, too, little boy.
Let me say it again.
Clear water.
Clear water.
Yes.
Hello.
Well, you sound like crap, pal.
Ha, ha, ha.
It must be the system.
It's getting muddier and muddier and muddier.
Oh, me?
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
OK, good.
I was coming over to the Campbell last night.
Yeah?
And heard you talk and you talked to Randy.
Yeah, when I called in, yeah.
Well, that was interesting.
He said you really liked it here now, huh?
Love it.
Yeah, it treated you like a kid.
And quick.
What's the big thing?
Wow.
Now, there was a call.
What did he say?
I don't know.
He went away.
He disappeared.
He said someone begged.
He did one, huh?
Oh, where are hours of it?
He did one.
He said crap.
Oh, he got dumped.
You got dumped, huh?
George, yes, he got dumped.
He got dumped.
That's the first one, the first dumpy of the day.
Really?
Very excited.
What do you have to say on this show to get dumped?
Ha, ha, ha.
I would imagine.
I would imagine.
We want to try.
I mean, could you write it down on a piece of paper
or something and pass it over?
He turned his mic off.
If I could tell you how much excitement I
could do in that.
Sure.
Yeah.
I get nervous in my spine.
Here's a porine on a star line.
Hello.
What are you calling?
Hello.
When you said, do you hear that?
Where are you calling from?
Oh, man.
This George's talking about losing it.
Yes.
The guy's over there slow.
Yes.
Now, let's kind of hop on her.
You got to take first point.
We have birds of light and get rid of them,
because these are ruined on your show.
Big time.
Get out of my face.
That lamp is accurate.
Get them off the ear, pal.
OK, but you do have a point.
Let's go.
Well, the guy you wanted to make a point.
It's only for one day.
Jeez, there's so many patients.
He'll be gone tomorrow.
I'll be back in a minute.
That's it.
That's absolutely correct.
With his Tampa Tribune on the bottom.
Yeah, and look, I can't help it.
You know, I just laugh.
He can't help himself.
He wants to be here.
He wants to be a part of our passing parade.
OK.
Here's Brandon.
Hello.
You got Bob Blaschard in there?
Yes.
You know, Bob and I go back a few years.
The reason I said Brandon, I'm really cool and proud.
Because I...
You're calling from what?
Broward.
I take it part.
You're calling from where?
Broward.
I'm calling from Broward.
Well, like where in Broward?
Is there a city?
Is there like a place?
Sir.
I think there's over there.
I think there's over there.
No, but I said, call Bob Blascharder from Brandon.
When he was on WFLA, I say that.
Yeah.
OK.
Not again, Bob was on WFLA.
And he was one of my...
He was my privacy said to me.
He said, what has you been to broadcast the US?
You have said you've been for broadcast?
Yeah.
You really do.
How about Sunday's 10 to 2?
We if we ain't, don't, ain't, ain't, don't suck up.
We ain't.
OK.
Thank you.
But you wouldn't know.
So, don't suck up, Neil.
No.
I've been down here two months.
OK.
That's for Dan's or Sean?
No, Bob, I had you guys.
But if you get Bob Blascharder to get out of here,
you got something.
That guy is great.
He's not going to be on down there.
I beg your pardon?
He's going to be on up here.
What do you mean up here?
Where's up here?
Brandon.
Right up here.
Just take a little bit.
Right up here.
What?
Is that coming down here to Miami?
No.
So, in my back, what?
I'm not on your head.
You think you're talking to George Michael?
Hey, hey, Bob.
Yeah.
What are you going to be at?
What station?
It's WS UN.
So, WS UN.
It's the sun, right?
Yeah, the sun.
OK.
You're not comfortable.
Hey, you put the sea out of here because this guy, Neil,
will change your ass out of town, baby.
Yeah, the rest of it, just.
Hey, he'll change your ass out of town.
But he's a, a Neil's great.
And you're a great, I'll catch you later, baby.
OK.
Which way can say the same?
OK.
Oh, I want to ask.
I'm 47.
On the IOD network.
Fire the goddamn teeth I'd take outside, kick my own damn ass.
I have no cavity, I don't know the fixer for you.
Oh, yeah.
You two.
You're a good fella, Charlie Brown.
Now showing on a double bill with Nightmare on Sesame Street.
Provo 6, the WIOD and lunches arrived.
I'm not talking about the crap that Joel brought.
I mean, Luigi BG.
He was right that BG's made lunch for us.
He BGB's.
The chef is going to cook special.
Remember, there was Moke Green said that.
No, we haven't him.
Yeah, well, we all remember Moke.
Yeah, nice.
Nice eye to the sky.
Yeah, nice glasses with eye in the sky with the on-parts and projects.
I have a high used to love that record.
I still have it.
I still do love it, but somebody stole my CD.
One of many that have been stolen from the IOD library.
Shocking.
Shocking.
So Bob Lanceter has gotten up momentarily and stepped out,
probably smoked a chain smoking in the kitchen.
I'm sure.
I'm sure that's what you say if he could be here right now.
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, let's do a mobile.
Mobile in St. Petersburg.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, you know, I was just trying to find up the FLA studio
by the G&B Bull of Art.
Yeah.
And they had these barriers up to the 60 of Pugh all over the ground.
Really?
I had a hell of a time getting screwed there.
And I got a dog story for you.
Yeah.
What do you call a little dog?
with very short legs and steel balls.
Next call for it.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Was that the time of someone throwing up?
Oh my God.
Are you okay Bob?
You alright?
Yeah.
Ha ha ha.
Listen, we can't all be as classy as the Bob Lancet or short.
Okay.
That is Bob.
I would like to make notes.
I would like to get one of those calls.
Seriously, I think it's my fault.
I know we'd be loaded.
You'd be like below the board out over there if we would love those people to call.
I don't want to repress you.
I don't want to hold you back.
I don't want to like give you.
I want to jumpstart your show.
We want you up to at least a 10 share after the first trend in the morning.
Okay.
Well, I think what I'm planning on doing right now.
By the way, I look at the hour by hour here and boy from 10 to 2.
We shouldn't do too bad in that book.
And also the 6 to 7 and Randy did pretty well.
And Rick and Sud.
No, I'm serious.
We actually had a couple hours and two is there.
I'm talking about my ratings here and like at dinner last night, all he's talking about.
Well, I was up to like a 72 share in the afternoon and you could look at the book and see the rest of the day was in the toilet at FLA.
And as soon as I came on, the numbers went skyrocketing to it.
And as soon as I went off, the radio was all went in the office.
All three.
Every word of it was the word of it.
Why did you admit it, you fony, you fat fony?
Why don't you admit it that you're a pompous ass like all the rest of it?
Please, fat fony.
You admit it yourself when I walked in here that I've lost a lot of weight.
And almost fat fony like me.
You have to be fat fony.
It's part of the club.
It's Neil and Bob.
They used to be fat fony guys.
We're now just going to put on more weight.
I can't wait to put on more weight.
By the way, sorry.
I don't ever say this is from Luigi B.G.
Pasta and pizza factory.
And it's good stuff.
When you shot up already, my Korean parmesan spaghetti with black olives, mushrooms, onions, broccoli, and green peppers.
And no meat, Bob.
No meat.
I'm not going that far.
Here's a lady in Weston.
Can you meet again?
Hi.
Did you, Bob, just come and get it?
Then don't keep the please off.
Oh, that's right.
Come and get it dog food for your dog.
You'll never have fleas.
Your dog's skin will be like silk.
You need your dog food too.
Didn't say I endorse it.
That's what I use.
It is not a sponsor.
It's just something that a product that I love.
Come and get it.
It's in the purple bag.
You can get them on.
No, I'm not trying to get them on or get them off for that man.
So are Bob's ratings real?
Or they kind of like Joey?
Kind of make believe.
My ratings were very real.
No.
I know.
I know you don't like requests and you probably don't bring your cards.
I brought some.
I brought a few.
Not the one you want.
Whatever it is.
Do you have the one with the guy?
Is he going to get him to get off?
No, I hate the bird.
Second request for that.
That's still number two of the bulls.
By the way, you call him in a recreated life.
Are you excited about Bob coming back to Tampa even though you're not here?
Just say yes.
Make him feel good.
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
It's a jolly over there with him.
Have a great day.
Okay, bye.
Bye-bye.
It's amazing that my presence here would suddenly make people think of that card.
They want to hear it.
They have to hear it.
You can tell where I'm embarrassed.
It comes as a surprise to you.
I didn't know.
I think there's a message there.
Yeah.
That's what I was getting at.
I'm not sure what it is, but I think I have an idea.
Say hello to Gail Saran.
Hello, Charlie.
Hello.
Who's that?
He's one of the anchors on Charlie.
Is that a good channel now?
Who's 10 now?
Before they really suck.
I like 13.
Personally.
Yeah, take that, Charlie.
I like 13 all the guy from 80's.
It just came out.
That won't make the news.
I don't think.
They can't edit it.
He's talking about the age of the girls he likes.
It's okay.
No.
It's okay, but 13's a little better.
They're my favorite.
Yeah.
It's great to say that right while the guy is standing right here.
I say this.
It's a real big help.
You know, he has his number on the camera too.
Oh, Charlie, we love it.
Yes.
Hey, Gail Saran.
13-year-old girls in Lakeland, by the way,
the birthset.
You're going to be right on the way home.
Can you look, girl?
So let's do, uh, now we got to have more calls than add on a board.
Huh?
I bring up there on here.
I think in George keeps blaming these guys over here.
I was doing a tremendous job, by the way.
These people at S.U.N.
are what are you talking about?
They're the best.
Oh, I wasn't.
I said they are the best and they're doing a good job, too.
524-15751 in date and the auto town line.
That's where we want to get these tremendous.
Come on.
Let's have some of Bob's old friends, man.
Underline the old.
1-800-944-946-3-1-800-944-WIO-D.
Try this, Fabitary.
Yes, I promise.
I haven't even officially started yet.
He's a year time.
You're f-h-h-h.
I'm sorry, you.
12 minutes after noon on the IoT network.
I'm Mr. King.
Hi, I'm Jim Morrison, and that was me 25 years ago.
I faked my death because I thought Warkin' Roll was dying.
And the future was in retail.
And I was right.
Just listen to these great specials.
We're having down at my gift shop, The Lizard King.
That's right, The Lizard King.
We're the Mojo might be rising, but the prices are falling.
Come on, baby.
We're lighting a fire under these specials.
Like fine, lizard boots, handbags, belts, and wallets.
And this is not the end, my beautiful friend.
Break on through to the other side of savings,
with great deals and lizard longs array.
Lizard hand tools, even lizard dishware.
So come on, there's no time to wallow in the mire.
Hurry on down to The Lizard King.
Where I am, The Lizard King, and I will sell anything.
What just happened there? Did you see that?
That was bizarre.
I didn't know if that was the real Bob or if that was the card.
I couldn't tell.
Is it real?
Or you got it, baby.
You got it.
Why did you just have the Argyll Saco?
Anyway, 12, 17 at WIOD.
I think we got it under control now, don't we?
It sounds crisp and clear.
If you think it sounds muddy, then you're out of your mind.
Because everybody in here tells me it sounds sensational.
And don't pay any attention to that.
Well, look at that.
Here's our pompano harness copy.
Thank you, Becky.
We still love you, Becky.
All right, it's a hell of a lot better over here.
Oh, my first reps in Tampa.
Okay.
I feel so much better now.
And that was not contrived.
That was the real one.
Oh, I think Jolz is backing up now.
That sounds...
You just got the ring.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Oh, you changed.
Hi, Leah.
Yes, sir.
Not the older man.
All right.
Okay, pass on, man.
I just want to tell you something about the emergency broadcast system test.
About what?
The emergency broadcast system test.
The emergency broadcast test.
Yes.
CBS.
That annoying content on sound should be changed.
But for some more sort of a point, maybe it's like...
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah, this has been a test of the emergency telemundo system.
So anyway, over here, they're showing it over and over and over again.
And just over and like from right side and left side.
You know, it's the best day from the back side.
It's the best day I've seen in a while.
Yeah.
What a handshoes, sir.
About your partner.
What a handshoes.
What words?
And what one show I've seen that we can't say it on the...
Lionel.
We can't say that.
And can't say Lardass.
Yeah, but we cannot say Lardass.
Did I get to listen to that?
Who is that asshole that's on over there from 9 to noon?
Mark Larson?
Oh, yeah.
That Lardass want to be...
I mean, that guy.
It's pathetic.
See, I've heard all those people over there.
And don't give me the sawdust about the Lionel.
He's a really a good guy and he's got a great said.
Lionel blows, man.
And he's got the most irritating gravel voice.
I found like something.
He did a roto-ruder in his throat or something.
And maybe they did.
Here's Tampa.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Welcome to Tampa.
Thank you so much.
We are so damn excited to be here.
It's great.
Far beyond our wildest expectations.
Cool.
Yeah.
Ah, yeah.
I'm like...
Your choke's up is what you're...
Yeah, really.
You're choking on it.
Yeah.
You know, this is John from Public.
Are you kidding me?
I'm not kidding you.
It's Public's John.
You remember, John?
He used to come down in South Lake.
He used to do things down there like...
Yeah.
And Kennell, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember him vividly.
How you doing, John?
Pretty good.
I just probably take a little bit of a blend and I'm looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday.
Are you coming by?
Yeah, I'm going to come by.
That's right.
And I'll worry you, what are you doing these days?
I'm still working at Public's up here.
I'll be done.
I'm still going to anybody at Groatsbury Bank.
This is career, Public's John.
Well, yeah, I'm still going to school today.
Great.
Why do you sound so depressed?
Yeah, done me.
You sound very depressed.
I was always depressed when I was...
Yeah.
Oh, it's true.
He always liked the last time you called me.
It was great hearing from me.
He sounded like manic.
Four people blew their brains out after your call.
Two of them.
Yeah.
Is that going to be their assignment?
I don't think so.
He's certainly welcome to come by.
I know. What else are you going to do?
Well...
What is he up to these days?
He's going to sign the bird on a stick.
Yeah.
I don't think they want to see me.
You know, up here.
See, Miami, I mean something to people.
But I'm here, they don't know me.
They don't know me.
He's got to go to the mall in Lakeland and hang out.
Yeah.
What do you do when these days want?
I'm retired.
Yeah, he's officially retired, yeah.
Yeah, been retired?
No, I've been retired for just over a year.
Can you believe it?
It's wonderful.
I like it.
I thought you were retired for the last three years.
Oh.
Oh, John.
John, it's a great pleasure and honor and a treat.
Butch up and we'll see you Saturday.
See you later, Glenn.
Bye.
Boy, it sounds pretty good.
It does, I mean.
Good.
It's a good kid.
It's a good kid.
It's a good kid.
It's a good kid.
It makes me want to split my wrists.
Get an 80's here.
Get an telemundo by four times.
That's the new man.
Yeah.
Birds, let's rinse.
I just frame by frame.
Yeah.
That'll do anything for a break.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's 1221.
So here's Loots speaking a shot.
Hello.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
I like to personally sit my hand to friendship to you.
Six o'clock on a candy bridge.
Yeah.
I can knock your teeth on your throat.
Let me say this, asshole.
Extend this.
Next call, George.
That was your old friend.
Get into your old brother.
You're buddy.
You'll spend his hand.

After last minute, I, we will be back for the murder.
Oh, Bill, you ought to do the jugs on this, babe.
Whoa!
I have to do it.
I...
You're going to burn in the hell and I'll stop you with the video.
Oh, Bob, tell us about that.
Yeah, but can I touch those jugs before I have to burn?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I like her.
Oh, you need her call all the time, yeah.
She sounded like she was right on the edge of a...
I think maybe she's the one at Font Sally's apparatus.
Anyway, it's 11.
Now, that's 20 hours.
Ellen Box was a normal man, with a nice home, a lovely family,
and a cushy job with his father-in-law's company.
Normal that is until just three weeks ago.
Hi, honey. How was your day?
Some of the Nessutoric Monday I feared would end up being button on the west.
Let me see if I can't focus it in to the best of my ability.
Ellen Box is suffering from Bob Lasseter disease.
Oh, are you feeling all right, Ellen?
Absolutely insane.
I see things that nobody offends to see,
or at least cares to admit that they say.
Bob Lasseter disease attacks the central nervous system,
causing otherwise normal people to communicate like some people
suicidal maniacs.
How with you today?
I don't want to talk to you.
What's more, Bob Lasseter disease is the one form of depression,
which is actually contagious.
God, just listing that voice, I want to jump off a building.
You're the lowest of a low you're at.
Nate, you're at Gumbag.
Please send whatever you can today to post office box
1-800-DEVIN-PORT-IOWA.
Honey, it's Friday night.
You know what that means.
Betching and moaning and screening and hollering.
Please, help.
Yeah.
