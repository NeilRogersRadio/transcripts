Now, the Neil Rogers show on Youth Talk Radio 610, WIOD This is the real Ralph Renek When I drive around
South Farder, I always listen to the Nick Reneri show on WIOD Well Ralph is dead and so is
most of Reneri's audience, but at least he's got an audience which is something, you know,
that's what I said to Bob Green this morning when I came in and everybody the buzz of the
place of course did you hear Reneri on 790 WMRZ this morning with Henry Barrow and unfortunately
Ed Berliner Get rid of him, Mike, get rid of Berliner man, everybody hates him like
poison Although I'll be honest with you, his fastest two minutes sport report in the
world wasn't too bad, as long as he doesn't say anything else just gives the scores he's
alright So anyway, that's the buzz of the joint as you would expect and Bob Green says
to me this morning, wow boy, did you hear that? I said yes, sure did, I said that's the
first time in three months I've listened to the radio on a way to work instead of just
listening to my tapes in a car Well they're all old, all old, now I know why we fired
them I said yeah, but at least they're out there, this somebody I mean even dead people
I represent a quium, you know what I'm saying even we got like 300,000 dead people at least
to represent something like a lot of dead people as opposed to having nobody but hey they
know it all here man and now after they admit they've screwed up the whole deal what are they
doing? They're doing more research! Yeah I heard you call Gilbert you suck ass, I heard you call
in there this morning, let's see who else called Mikey we had Harold Song to all the
old plant guy we had Yolanda Parapark, God that was touching, I was there shaving, I was
shaving I had to radio on in the house which I never do and here was Yolanda on the phone
and there's Henry and Mikey and I thought God this is all we needed was Phil Costin in
there and we'd have like a whole conglomeration there of all the people about, a few of the
people who have been screwed over in the last two, three years by this company I mean it was
just a, tears came to my eyes. So anyway the deal is now of course we have this thing in the
morning this abortion here that nobody wants to listen to and certainly nobody even defends
because now and by the way all you old farts that called up for an area this morning and
oh boy don't even mention that other one over there that's disgusting what he's doing on it
you're all listening right now you're not fooling me for a second you could quote chapter
and verse, air be God damn thing I say on here so don't call and suck around over there
and pretend you're not listening now because I know you're listening good morning to you happy
Wednesday you old farts oh I still miss you left we turned it off and that other one he's
so disgusting I love the one guy to call to say that he so relieved he can listen to Mike
Knight doesn't have to hear those disgusting filthy promos for the guy used to follow him
over here the ones we had a bleep even if I said hey how you doing I had to bleep that
out because just the sound of my voice would get some of those people would get the crap
in their class to be bag just regurgitating just puking around in there like a whirlwind
like a male strum in a bag so anyway renery is on 790 by the way on AM WMRZ 610 in the morning
and I was thinking this is like after World War 2 remember we beat the crap out of the Germans
and the Japs and then all of a sudden we started building them up again and all of a sudden
they're just they got their thumb down on us and we're like doing NAFTA and this and that
we're trying everything in the world to get somebody to buy American products
because the Germans and the Japanese we have like handed it right back to them and in fact
how my Birkenstocks doing and my new German pen but anyway and that's what it reminds me of
I was talking about that yesterday we got the snooze cruise tombstone sitting out there
in front of our building after we put WNW West out of business off the year cup put finished
and all of a sudden like hey here's another chance although Sandy ain't going to help much
and the reason I know I always liked renery is because I heard from the grape fund
that he wasn't very nice yet some not too nice things to say about Sandy this morning
you know what I mean yeah I had a boy Mike he's not sucking around like Henry is over there
you know I like Henry but one of the things talk about I could go on the whole four hour monologue
today about this I really could it just like here you know we have all the psychosis
about Jazz McKay and about this because there are certain people without mentioning
any other names like Valtteri's again it's the Valtteri's Roost at IOD once again
it just never seems to end certain people just waiting in the wings just hovering over
waiting for the death of the morning show which I think is imminent regardless of anything
and just looking to see if they put recon suds in the morning that opens up the afternoon
well let's get Jazz McKay out of here before they stick him on there
so now the new then all of a sudden there's another great turnaround here
I mean I don't know whether the scream or either banana I don't know if this is a good guy
a bad guy all I know is he represents a threat to certain other people
I don't want to mention Jim who again is in here manipulating and trying to you know
I mean get him out of the building take away his card or whatever it is he gets in his building
with and just ban him from the building and Randy will be better off and so will
everybody else then oh she gets very upset when I say that I don't care it happens to be true
he's a professional meddler God he's in here yesterday manipulating Adam
like a puppet on a string really it looked like Edgar Bergen and that must be why
Adam was sitting on his knee can't be any other reason huh he was pulling and pulling on the strings
that is he ain't get on him like crazy on the strings but anyway we'll get into all of this
because I'm sure a nice job Mike okay not too much of a show we'll get some spots in here
I'm sure we'll get that thing going first day a lot of calls a lot of response
everybody I listened like I said for the first time to radio AMFM or anything in the morning
for months this morning not that it was all that entertaining or compelling but hey
at least it was something besides hey here's the same crappy news over and over and over again
and the same stuff he just heard three minutes ago and here's another 80 second
interview with somebody we don't want to hear in the first place so anyway big
article by Tom jicke picture of a renery from about 20 years ago I'm one thing about
Mike he always looked the same you know I bet you when he was 15 he still
looked like pretty much the same had that same red jacket and then it was the
blue one and kind of like that gigantic bald spot like I got only more toward the front
and had like a flask in his pocket and he just basically the same guy I like
renery you know I always said that I never said that I didn't like renery always in
this show wasn't that exciting but I got news for it it was like a comfort zone
and the demographics were old yes we had a lot of old people but they mostly
disappeared just like when I talked about him last few days you notice most of
the audience course on a west coast look at the phone lines there because they don't know anything about him
well it's too bad okay it's too bad there's nothing I can do about that if I had
a lightning hockey tickets to give away to you then maybe we do something then we get some calls over there
this is something for us today all right so you'll have to excuse us this is a man
who was on the year here on this station in the mornings for 17 long
excruciating years and is just to got paid off for a year as he said by very dumb people
he got paid for a year and it says in jicke's column over 200 grand and I'm sure
that's about right I don't know what it was maybe 250 to 40 whatever was
guy was making a few bucks and got paid for a year to sit around play some golf drink
a little booze and have a good time and watch late night TV
now he's over there with Henry Burrow Edberlitter unfortunately and the
gods and Mishbacher so my green calls in this morning suck it around Gilbert
calls in suck it around which I thought was unconscionable and better than
us Harold Songdall I mentioned and the sopper and of course what's the guy
captain the bouncer and anybody else we know I mean there was just like I like
old home week and like I said people in the morning in this market other than
those who are FM people looking for Ron and Ron because they can't find much of
anything else that's entertaining and are tuning they're like switching around
man and I'm going to tell you if they don't do something pretty quick but I'll
also say as far as jazz mk I'm not going to pay any attention to the audience
because quite frankly we saw in the last two days just exactly like a little
clinic a mini clinic of what I've always said about the audience and that is
they'll call in a green for the most part with whatever you say they want to
get free as well if they if you might find something to give them so that's
basically on Monday when I said well I thought it was pretty good then all
of the yeah he's great he's wonderful then yesterday when I said I heard
that got when Adam and Jim just happened to come in here with that cart to try to
get me all stirred up and I succeeded very well by the way I came in on Sunday
morning at about 10 to noon I guess right after that episode it happened and then
drew called in sucking around trying to save his life and now after yesterday
and all this other stuff we find out that Adam had a phone conversation with jazz
mk and Adam says oh he's the nicest guy ever want to know he's a great guy so
Adam is either a real pussy like I said yesterday and just scared for his life and
scared that all those bikers are going to come down here and beat the crap out of
him or he just is convinced he's a nice guy and maybe Jim isn't going to manipulate
Adam as much as he did before and trying to suck around for that afternoon
slot or one of the above so I don't know whether the screen read a banana I think
the guy deserves a little bit more of a chance because he's only been on a couple
of days and let's find out if he kills somebody or not I say huh because I can
think of plenty of good candidates bring those bikers down here jazz I got a good
list for you pal okay and some of those guys got a real small penis too by the way
the ones that are on my list I don't want to mention anybody in particular down
stairs but he's near the head of the list he's right near the top baby and rising
fast yeah so also I do want to mention where I'm doing when we come back I got to
talk about those calendars I had an afternoon yesterday I'm I wait a good show
yesterday amazing everything went just fine and everything was hunky
dori as they say I go home I'm watching guiding light which is getting very very
neurotic and I'm wondering what happened with best low if she's turning into a
turn coat I wonder what that's all about and I'm just minding my own business
the phone rings and it's Cheryl and it seems that we have a big
contortops about this thing with the these t-shirts and Kurt's all upset about it
and everybody else is all upset about it be screened and they're just screaming
and yelling and then of course about these 25,000 calendars which this is another
gym thing gym comes in here gets everybody so pissed off everybody so worked
up stay out of the building gym okay everybody to live 20 years longer if you
just stay out of our face and keep your nose out everybody's business
Camille's house thing I mean Randy's video is great it's a masterpiece I'll
give you all a credit but stay out of the rest of it mind your own business go find
a life find a boyfriend somewhere find a hobby take up pocket pool or something
constructive 1023 at W. I. D. W. S. U. N.
What do you got think about this penis thing 1027 at W. I. D. so speaking of that
this thing with B screen yesterday Mike sends over this really beautiful buffalo
sucks the sequel t-shirt and on the back it says in their fans what does it say
their fans blow yeah beautiful with dolphin colors aqua and orange and the whole
bit in white and black and I don't want to go into the fact that there was a big
song in advance and boy Kurt had an nervous breakdown about this but he can
stick it where the moon don't shine and we are going to be doing these because we'll
raise a you know a few extra grand or whatever it's going to be and they cost only
ten bucks and Mike is going to give three bucks from each t-shirt to Camille
's house just like he did last year and if we would like to get some of these
especially and by the way I understand that brother we is is doing it again the WCMF
up in Rochester and brother we are buying another billboard and we're already
working on finding out where it's going to be so we can do a real nice job well we
don't advocate that anybody would do it but just in case any of the dolphins are
pissed off by it that they might just do a real good job of defacing it which would
be illegal I'm sure but you know nice so anyway B screen's number is five nine
two seventy five oh five five nine two seventy five oh five and his facts
numbers four seven one oh four six two four seven one oh four six two we're also
going to have some anti buffalo t-shirts from our good pizons are captured glory
and I guess those are coming in later today what is it what do you what do you mean
anti buffalo buffalo sucks why you also now a bills fan I'll get out of here with
your Colorado already will you what kind of girl school are they playing this week
give me a break how's this Colorado Rocky's doing and you're supposed to say
better better than the Marlins add a girl Lisa you're gonna give me started again
talking about the size yeah laugh now cry later so anyway we got these eight
billion calendars all right comes to find out that the original guess who was
involved in the calendars and our Kamala's house total by the way is fifty three
thousand one seventy one center one is still fifteen thousand four eighty
because we don't have an update from peaches which will have tomorrow the next
day but they're both doing very very nicely the Kamala's house hotline is one eight
hundred eight five two oh oh six come on Mikey give us a few plugs on it okay one
eight hundred eight five two oh oh oh six come on call tit for tat and what
else on Kamala's house peaches of course has got all the good stuff and so we got
all these calendars now turns out this was and I will give full credit they work
with Joe Andrews and peaches they got our stuff and peaches are the t-shirts at
peaches to by the way I don't know about that see the problem is this year as I've
told you before there is just too much stuff it's unwieldy we got Chuck who's
had to take the week off this week to run around delivering those coffee mugs
because it's the only way to get people to buy him and he raised about twelve
hundred bucks for us on Saturday I guess but we just have too many things and one
of the things is this w i d artsy crafty calendar which on each month on the
calendar is got a like a m a gothic picture with our pictures of the various
uh... goofballs here at the station superimposed like the first one with me sitting
on the throne like the queen with my pus with a cigar and whatever else and
rickensuds with the american gothic is the name of that picture with a farmer and his wife
with the pitch fork and all that and their pusses are and it's it's really a neat
thing I don't think we probably needed twenty five thousand of them but it's really a
thing now this this now I'm really a psychotic I almost had a stroke about this
yesterday because comes to find out that the sales department originally was
involved in this and they were going to sell to a client they were going to like
put their own add on there or coupon or something and they were going to put them
in all their stores but then of course for whatever reason and bob green tells me
one thing this morning and I was told another thing yesterday the sales department
dropped the ball which wouldn't surprise me so anyway we got these billions of
these things they're only two ninety nine which most calendars cost and ice
calendars about ten bucks right yeah eight or ten bucks these are like two
ninety nine and of that like two bucks goes to Camille Sous and the other buck
goes for the cost of printing so to make a long story short boy crew it spent
twenty five thousand dollars on these calendars most of which are collecting
dust there at peaches there at Camille Sous there were any of the places where
we got our stuff including the tailgate party the Sunday before the Giants
game we are going to bring tons of these out there and I want to make sure of
anything I want to make sure that these are sold because otherwise if we don't
get rid of most of them Camille Sous is going to lose money on this deal and that
really is what pissed me off yesterday I mean why should twenty five thousand we
only printed up seven hundred and fifty Randy videos and a few thousand of
everybody else's CD and stuff but twenty five thousand of these calendars I told
Bob Green this morning I says God that's our whole cune for the morning show
no it's not no it's not yes it is well it was last week and maybe lower now
that Ranieri's back up what what are you laughing about don't you understand we have no
audience in the morning to have any notice that in the last year I sit down here
it's like after after following that show and a rehashed old bunch of crap
of mine that's like from the dark ages that nobody would listen to we're like
starting from scratch we're scratching it we got any audience in the morning here
nothing I mean nobody zip any doodah nobody that's why Chuck is out there he's
knocking door to door all over town all over the state finding somebody anybody
you listen to morning got to his own house and they said no they slammed the
door in his face you kidding me here's Coral Gables hello deal yes sir eat
the banana what is it eat the banana why won't this thing cut this off immediately
okay why is this is this thing screwed up now to the phone don't work is that a
new deal it looked like you punched the button twice and locked it in oh
because he did slip s h in there and I don't want I mean you award could spend a
lot of time over on the beach yeah he slipped that in there didn't he didn't he
say that I thought he did it was real like mumbled and muffled and by the way
sandy painting is a bitch Cheryl that's what everybody said like I said I always
like Mike but because he tells it like it is and sandy is a disgusting
jappy obnoxious bigoted bitch and he yes she is and everybody in this building
sonny her shates her like poison and the cow hates her like poison feel
constant hates her like poison everybody that is true everybody was here when sandy
paint was here said she was the most difficult bitch to work once he was just
obnoxious had a real crappy attitude and they hit her like poison I wish he would
croak a wicked death that's what they all say including micrinery see he's not a
phony like Henry burrow he's not going to go out over there and start sucking
around with somebody that he can't stand that he hates like poison so at a
point Mike we love you pal now what was this last guy was that the first call I
take any slips the s word in there very nice thank you so much sir
here's Miami hello hello yes sir how you doing the meal okay I tell you
agree with you sandy painting is a bitch uh-huh there you go listen I caught the
Mike show this morning yes did you catch that little promo that they've made
for him real serious an answer comes on and says you're listening to the
micrineries show brought to you in part by the fact that he had candid i.o.d.
a cost broadcasting network now he did not hear that but the voice I'm sure was
Scott Chapin that was who used to be overheard he used to be over here at gtr
he used to be our production ace and he used to crank up the audio so loud
in production that the whole building was rocking and rolling he did used
to have the walls just tumbling down here that's true that's not
happened I wanted to I'm trying to get a hold of you the whole week why you're
on vacation I didn't get to hear all of it because it was just ponderous
getting all the tapes but there was this one part where you were talking to
uh-ronpa appeal I didn't get to hear the first time yeah the whole thing but
the second time was better that was just a great bit what do you mean the second
time was better well if you didn't get to get to a lot of times the second time
is better the first time you was on I didn't get I only got the last part of it yeah
I was talking about the miracle this also in other words if you didn't hear
something the first time when the tape is on it's better let me tell you something
sir tapes blow tape broadcasts below in this station a major market
station should be embarrassed I hope when he gets a 10 share in the morning
okay I hope our morning show goes down to a point one and it's not personal
with Chuck it's business Chuck knows I like him even though he now hates me like
poison I don't care this is a business this isn't a playground and the point of it
is Bob Green can sit in there and rationalize all he wants if they didn't like
Reneerie show there was no emergency he had a year to go on the contract if
you're going to get rid of somebody at least have something in the wings to
replace it that's going to be better that's going to do better not something
that's going to die on the vine and bring everybody else down scratching and
crack screaming and just dying over here to try to get a phone call to buy a
phone call because most of the audience is gone that isn't the way to do it
and these people are they are the biggest rationalizers because they've never
made a mistake including that little Torpy Bob Neal that little walking
people up there in Atlanta wouldn't know a radio show if it bit him on he is
he is the biggest torque I have ever met in my life and when they when they
gave Bob Neal the keys to the kingdom in this company that was the kiss of death
for all of us we'll one that's right within six months I predict will all be
over there on Reneerie show reminiscing about old times with the Orlando and Phil
Coston will all be over there about the t-shirts and Harold Songdall what is it
would get the t-shirts what did I say where do you get them I gave you the
number that's the old place you can get them you can't go like a peaches or
two no we didn't say there were some I said when we're there on the sixteenth
will have them there December 16 that's two weeks from tomorrow cool catch you
there then okay I'll go see you two open lines and date 751 one and two on the
green line where they're of course totally out of the mix today and that's the way it
goes too bad we're busy talking about stuff that's going on here and you just sit
back and be passive for once until we have stuff to go away to you later which
would be in just a few minutes yeah actually we're going to give some stuff away
to those people today because they've been very very well are used to getting
crap free from Bob and he's got him trained and they can't get the hands because
the hands you got to pick up over here and they're not going to drive I mean they may be
free loaders but they're not going to get drive 250 miles each way to get her
free ham maybe 1037 a W I O D and W S U N don't miss the weekend magazine
featuring the latest news information trends and what's happening this Saturday
and Sunday morning right here
Bords of a feather flock together that's why she's also defensive of sandy
patent because they're both basically the same jappy annoying people and she
comes in here and she's like digging and digging oh and I feel so bad and
Chuck how's he going to feel about what's this is business this is not
personal okay Chuck's a great guy is a great talent I've always said tremendous
things about Chuck that show blows the whole concept blows were dying over
here because we got the new regime here that came in here and decided they were
smarter than everybody else they were going to pick the whole station apart and they've
succeeded very very well and we've got almost everybody in the building running
around now like a bunch of little vultures oh I want this slot I want that slot
I got a slot for you Charles got one for you just get your foot oiled up
here's a mobile in Orlando hello yeah I got to tell you you guys got to drop these
scumbags at S U N Bob Laster is the biggest piece of crap I have ever heard I got to
come up here is that a bullet now well I got to tell you that bad enough we got all
the stuff going on over here we got to put up with the baggage from the west coast
now he says this crap because I mean he knows that you guys can't hear him down
there his whole I got to come up I'm from Fort Lauderdale and I got to come up here
every couple weeks and in order to listen to you I got to listen to the swill that he
puts out why is that well you don't have to listen I come on a 10 o'clock
over there well at nine o'clock I you know I had a radio accident you know
you know the amazing part of it is that you don't have to warm up the radio that
if you punch the button there's this amazing thing that happens and it comes
on instantly on whichever channel you like you don't have to like like back in the
old days when you had to turn the TV on a wait for the tubes to warm up for a couple
of minutes don't work like that radio it's like instant well I guess I don't know
I got to listen to him sometimes like a it's like a guy that called jazz the other day
on Sunday about drew it about how awfully wasn't how drew went on for two and a
half hours ripping jazz and about oh yeah he'd much rather listen to even WLR
and etc etc but the fact is he was listening to the two and a half hours of it
because he was quoting chapter in verse as though somebody was holding him at
gunpoint forcing him to listen but anyway what's the story with blob today well
if I can see this whole show nale consists of ragging on you yeah and ragging on
randy today he was saying that if he was Chuck Meyer that he would shoot you dead
and that no jury in the country would convict them because all you do is rag him
and talt micrinerian this that hey if if micrineries great you say I never said he was
great but he ever said he was great but he said that he's better than
than Chuck show wait a minute it's got nothing Chuck doesn't have a show Chuck is
here on the more they don't even call it to Chuck Meyer show they call it son
Florida's morning news it's an all news format and Chuck unfortunately is caught
in the middle of that it's got nothing to do with Chuck personally Chuck is the best
news person in this state and one of the best in the country as far as I'm concerned
but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it's a great show because it blows
and last year and last year again because he's got nothing else to talk about
he's either ripping randy or ripping me all he talks about is over here that's all
he that's the only thing I ever hear him talking about is over here isn't there
something going on over there there is nothing because the the South Florida
audience isn't here in a moment here so what's the benefit of the audience over
there hearing him talk about here it doesn't make any sense we have those red
next nose pickers just eating out of his hands they come up and just talk
a line of crap I can imagine what they're eating yeah they just don't know
what they got with you Neil huh they just don't know what they've got with you
you're the greatest they just don't know they have what do you mean they don't
talk about I don't I don't care what they say see this is this yenta thing again
I don't give a crap what they say I'm not interested in Bob Lasseter he's a
sour fat fart that's all he is he's just a sour puss and a real corn ball
yokele and he fits in over there perfect he's great for over there well I guess
I just like to hear you say well then forget about him already find something
else to listen to over there if there's anything I just want to just keep
twisting it around I thought it'd be of help now yeah I can tell see you
by agitator ojan provacotrus we have an open line indeed 7519463 and I'm going to
say it again Jim and Adam and a lot of other people in this building better
calm to hell down because they get me highly agitated and especially that
Jim he is the biggest the worst manipulator I've ever seen in my life he wants to
keep standing getting everybody whipped up and oh they spent all this money on
the calendars they were about just give it a rest already big is chronic
complainer man he makes me seem like the happy man like the ice cream man I mean
this guy is he ever happy about anything is there anything in the world I could
ever please that this man he would stop belly it get in bitching and yelling no I
don't think so I think you're right but it sure is how beats working 1046
at W I O D in WS UN tonight after Randy Rose it's Don and Mike
1050 a W I D Joe Hartman's here to kill the hour I mean how you doing Joe
good morning yes are we close tonight are we closed close close to what close
on our selection no we're not well let me take a peek again I know that
whoever you picked I did not pick as usual which makes me feel very secure
very well I know that let's see you picked seven rate Lord Zinath prestige
is there well we're like flip flopped okay I like the rail you like the rail I
don't I'm Mickey Peterson I mean it's a nice guy never stole a freight train but it's just
not that horse every now and then goes up in the air like he did last week and Mickey
occasionally gets lost in there on the rail and I just figure we got a major driver
change even though Brian Allen's had a very tough meeting here he was monster
it Vernon this summer and if he gets a live horse to drive he might just be there
because this horse one this is scary thing about Brian I mean Brian is one
150 race of the year to last four years at Vernon yep just can't seem you know
that's how deep this driving colony is just can't seem to get the drive it's
getting really deep but this horse went a gigantic mile from the nine hole last
week parked the whole mile and I'm just I'm not making a definite commitment
but I think I may just go with the one tonight you're leaning that I'm leaning
toward it well that's it that just like Andre just like Andre Brisson is just like
Andre Brisson is leaning out there toward the middle of the track with that horse the other night
but I don't want to talk about that and not my horse you did not have a good night
I am oh my god Terry Baker is going to win the race for fun there with Frenchman
Bay and Andre Brisson what's he doing off the rail anyway makes a break comes
out in the middle of the field knocks everybody down and that's it I got up and
said okay let's go good weekend coming up got a big weekend coming up go ahead

cute now what now my answer over here okay have a great day have a great day you have a great
day see ya see ya bye and happy Chanooka everybody that's not for a week yet but I can't
believe it's here already we have an open line it's on the blue line and
brown at 524 Yenta and let's go to Fort Lauderdale hello good morning yes sir
boy you're gonna step on the news here no I'm not got a lot of time heard a rumor
that you were bitten for the heat what is this enough the publicity down here
with Wayne by in the fish the heat being sold Ted Aronson told me you were bitten
yeah yeah hundred bucks hey Bob Greasy called Mike diddy with Elaine Aitor Elaine Aitor
also called are you like are you in coherent or are you just like speaking in a little
like little choppy parts of sentences crummy phone no it's not it no it's fine there's
nothing wrong with the phone it's what's coming out of it that doesn't make too much sense
you're like speaking in a little disconnected the things oh maybe I've been on a
reneary long weekend that might be it hey it was fun Neil see ya I wish I
could say the same there's another one of Mike's people told you maybe Bob
Greene had a point you know it we have two open lines in both and broad see I'm
not defending that the reneary had a great show I'm just saying if you're gonna
blow somebody off has been on here 17 years and especially do it in a pretty
vulgar and vile way and not even let the guy say goodbye then you better damn well
have something really dynamite to bring on afterward and Cheryl's busy running
around here oh geez I'm worried about our people and now it's chucking a feel it
well what do you want me to do what would you like me to do would you like us all
just to go down the drain with a little bit of tidy bullman just to make
everybody feel good to make Andy Calve feel good our little Napoleonic morning
dictator who's running around here setting up all those insipid little interviews
it's just ain't flying man it ain't flying and then of course if something
should happen and that show should disappear oh it's Neil's fault I need
you've got nothing to do with it Neil told him stay keep reneary on man don't
make a big mistake and they did just the opposite so the more I say do
something in the morning they'll leave chuck on for 10 years because I'm saying
they're busy doing research again they're not gonna listen to me they're not
gonna listen to their own judgment because they don't have any they're busy doing
research which is how they got into this mess in the first place which is what
they already admit they even admit that they made a big mistake and how do they
do it because they did research so now they're doing more research to see how bad
they can screw it up again that's our company that's this incredible multi
billion dollar company why don't they just open up a research company that's
what they ought to do instead of paying all the maggot and all these other
assholes why don't they just open up a research company get out of broadcasting
because if they're enough fools in this business that keep spending big bucks on
research they could be like a multi trillion dollar company in a couple of years
here's Jensen Beach hello hi I was going to question about the football down here
yes now just for an example about the Jacksonville of Gremlins or whatever they are
no no about the coverage yeah okay first of all I'm from up to New York and
believe me people up there hate Buffalo too so you can feel good about that I do feel
very good about it yeah okay that shot happens everybody's got shot intensive
here today man they're all doing the S word today okay shot happens that's the
motto on W.I.O.D today shot happens a lot in upstate New York and there's a lot of
shot right around Syracuse you just have to dig through the snow piles to find
it just dig through the drifts manual be needy and shot which is what I feel like I
am right now now I'm looking at this thing I see this weekend on a scheduled
Jasmine case Saturday from 10 to 2 and at 2 o'clock till 6 we got Chris Baker is back
I didn't hear that much of my thought he was okay I thought he had like post
abilities and then next week of course Rick and SUDs around vacation and Jasmine
K gets to fill in for an entire week and I think we give the guy a chance instead
of like sitting here and getting all psychotic because Adam brought in some tape
that Jim whipped him up to a frenzy and they're high-fiving each other in a
control room because I'm playing it on here and getting all whipped up as they
would like to program me I think we'd be better off sitting in given a chance if
he's got anything to talk about except the faggots and bull dikes and bikes and
the dikes and whatever else that as he was talking about South Florida's news talk
and entertainment station news talk radios 610 W I O D Miami Fort Laugher
because I'm sitting here and just the smoke is coming out of my ears because
even though I don't really give a crap about what he says but when you stop and
think about the the implications of what he just said I mean if that's the case
then Randy ought to go over there with a shotgun and blow the living crap out
of them yeah because he's done nothing practically since the day she came on
ear or at least since we were over there but absolutely trash and do everything
that has power to decimate her along with that at psychotic bitch Kara over there
and it's like their whole crusade because they basically have no show so because
I'm talking about not about a person or a personality and certainly would never
attack Chuck on a personal level because he's a great guy and I love him he's a
super guy and a great talent but I'm talking about a show that's failing and
that's blowing and we're all going down with it but that therefore Chuck should
show me and no court and blah blah blah blah but how about Randy and not only the
attack but on the show but on a personal the most disgusting the lowest
form of slime in the history of the human race and this man is talking about
anybody else you are a real loser man and what do they kick this ass out of
Chicago here's a lady in leisure city hello good morning Neil hi how are you happy
Wednesday well same to you I'm first time caller time listener right and I really
don't have any complaints today I mean I could but today's my birthday
well isn't that sweet don't complain on your birthday right unless you wake up
with a migraine thank you well I was kind of just thinking about you know
listening to jazz and decay whenever I did yeah that kind of reminded me that I
would appreciate it if you play assholes on parade really yeah and also what does
that mean I don't understand what does that mean well it's in the world of
school of assholes and he just won all of them just one in a long parade right
now I work on it okay and if I could have one of those hands I'd appreciate that
too no chance okay we have an open line in date do you can you believe that did I
say we were given away any hands now so good I hope I spoiled her birthday that
was the most disgusting obnoxious seriously I and all the years that I've been
on the air if I try to narrow it down to one call that might have been it that may
have been the worst call in the history of the human race right there it's her
birthday she wants to take a shot at jazz which is okay with me as long as
she's got good aim and could I just have one of those hands well you sure can't
because I'm not giving away right now honey I'll let you know honey ham that was
absolutely unbelievable see what I mean about that what we're developing here now
we're developing an audience that won't even call unless they figure they're
gonna get something for free she had nothing to say other than to wish yourself a
god damn happy birthday to when it ties me to play that little incipient thing and
now can she have a ham yeah I got some meat for you honey not much this is
something that we got going here now where they think that we're gonna keep
buying the audience with freebies oh by the way I mentioned about the Batman
comics were given away today that's right it's from Frank's comics and sports
cards at 20 26 78 Southwest 87th Avenue in South
Dave they they there are Frank's comics and baseball cards where they buy they
sell they trade oh I wonder if you ever come back with my car keys you maniac
oh by the way if Reneerie and Roger I'm sure they are listening and Henry a
Spencer would like to come over there to MRZ and do your cars man he misses
old Mike Reneerie misses that ten bucks every week it's up to 11 now by the way
Mike but for you he'll do it for 10 right that's right and so how are they
gonna get in touch with the Spencer no don't give your number on the air

Spencer okay wants to come over and wash your thing and your ball spot okay get
out of here shine up that ball it's Bob man he's a star now he's on a real
station not okay so anyway Frank from Frank's comics and sports cards where they
have all kinds of good stuff new comics old comics back issue rock and roll item
sports cards and etc sent me over a bunch of these George already stole one I
did have a dozen so somebody misses out oh look at the phone lines all of a
sudden there all of they were pretty much full but it's just amazing you know
maybe you call me Callison obnoxious for not saying oh of course it's your
birthday here's a ham but that would there was no other purpose for that call
she just called us to squeeze off some meat that's all she called a squeeze
and free meat I'd like to squeeze some free meat but that don't mean I'm gonna be
able to I mean that was just that just irritates the crap out of me you don't
want to talk to me you just want you see what you can squeeze out of me I feel
like I've been squeezed so hard man I'm not not even any moisture left in my body
like an old like a sponge that seven hundred years old that's a fossil anyway
these are really nice these are the and I know nothing about comics I have no
clue as to what they're all about or what they're worth or I just I'm not
into it and George is starting to give me a big thing about well it's the new
Batman he's got all these new thing old things in another's an older robin is
in there and he's got his thing hanging out I don't know about it okay I like
the old Batman and Robin show on TV because I liked Robin basically with
those real those nice tights on I loved Robin Bert Ward was one of my favorites
I mean with those little tight green shorts on and there was always like
something there well it was one of his secret weapons but that's the only
reason I enjoyed that now is kind of a good show was camp it was fun but I'm not
into comic books
