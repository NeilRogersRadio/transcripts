Tonight after Randy Rhodes, it's Don and Mike.
It's a great year's vacation.
The money while you're with me.
It's national baked bean month.
And we're asking what do you like about baked beans?
It's great. They're nutritious. They make them fart.
A lot. They're delicious. They're nutritious.
And they make you fart. A lot.
Yes, they're baked beans with all my parties.
Because nothing breaks the ice like breaking wind.
I'm going to do a really big one here. Listen.
I locked you to hold some beans and then say the dog did it.
Here it comes.
Big bean's made bubbles in the back of the house.
Ready? Here's give me the microphone.
Bean's made a fart.
It's lots of baked beans.
During national baked bean month.
It's going to be big.
This mess. It's brought to you by the national baked bean council.
Wow. Balthalarm.
I, Luis Miguel.
It's 11.29. See this?
We have an open line in Broward.
524WWD. The reaction is last night.
First ever, Panther's game is just so underwhelming that I'm astonished.
We had two calls. One from a guy who had no idea what the score was.
Then from some nose picker in Tampa who thinks that Darren Pupa is God.
And Felix Potman had the best year he ever had in the NHL last year.
Which he doesn't have any idea what he's talking about.
And that said, hockey in Florida.
Maybe it's a mistake after all.
Here's Cutler Raid.
No.
Yes, sir.
Let me make it short.
Let's go to sports for a second here.
Okay?
Here's the hits.
The hits.
The hits are.
Yeah.
Okay.
The hurricanes.
If you can have something else to do, then you can watch them.
Yeah.
The top is I'm a great football fan, but I wish them all the luck.
They'll need it.
Okay. Marley's.
Marley's.
I've gone to about 25% of the games.
Right.
Oh god. I'm not a season.
I'll take it harder.
They are.
I'm not a season.
I'll take it harder for the Marlins.
You're nuts.
The station is.
I get to squeeze out their tickets.
Oh, okay.
Oh yeah.
Look at you.
Now, at least in hockey, I've been in the USA for 15 years.
Right.
And never been able to watch more than five minutes.
It's the last night.
Yeah.
Oh, you want to give my a thanks?
Goal pants is all that way.
Right.
I got excited.
Well, thank god.
I agree with it.
It was a pretty good game.
Big time.
And they were behind three nothing.
And it looked like, you know, they just roll over and kind of play dead.
They just get a little practice and they got right back in there and they kicked them as.
And they did it.
And I'll tell you what, after work, after one game, it's not day anymore.
It's the week.
Right.
Now you're talking.
Outstanding.
Okay.
I'll see you there.
Take care.
Yeah.
Outstanding, man.
There's a word that goes between out and standing, but I can't say it.
Out.
Instanding.
Anyway, we have an open line and date.
Seven five.
Once we got one new hockey fan there, which is good because we'll find him a good seat.
I can't find any, but we'll find him a good one.
Right there in the front row, right in front of the Weasemagel.
Okay.
Let's do Tampa.
Hello.
You know, how you doing?
Okay.
You said a very good conversation with George.
Yeah.
It's a fantastic guy.
Anyway, consider talking about the hockey game.
Did he tell you to say that, by the way?
No.
Okay.
Let me correct you on something.
What did I say now?
Okay.
First off, the capacity of the Lakeland Civic Center.
Five thousand.
Right.
But last night they anticipated about four thousand people there.
Why is that?
We had 38, 76 because that's what they had last year.
They just really said there's not much enthusiasm on going to the games in Lakeland.
Why not?
It's just the way it is.
It's a bad place.
It's a bad access.
It's a small area.
I mean, it's just not a good place to see hockey.
No, no, no, no.
I'm just saying you were talking about the way you went.
I hope you're right.
I just thought that because I'm here and so much about this hyped up rival, we had a thought they'd been standing online all the way to Bartol.
No, no, no, no.
You just went to the Dunderdome.
Do we get over there?
That's a good crowd.
Well, you're supposed to break the all-time record.
It's a Dunderdome.
I tell me 25,000.
I think we're going again tonight.
Where they playing tonight.
Where they playing tonight.
They're playing tonight.
Playing the blues.
Oh, they're in Lakeland again tonight.
And Lakeland again tonight.
Yeah.
And Curtis Joseph won't be there.
Oh, aren't you lucky?
Exactly.
What the hell was he taking in some of those games against us last year and against the Blackhawks?
My God.
Okay.
This guy was on heavy duty juice.
They must have run out in the last couple of games against the Leafs.
But boy, he was doing it.
I don't know about right now.
Yeah, he is doing it.
He's definitely doing it.
The first game, in fact, that clip I played at Gilmore Scoring in the second overtime, he had 62 saves in that game.
Yeah, he's playing.
And again, that I went to tonight.
The two of tonight's the game.
I went to, we had like 20 some saves in the first period.
Right.
26 saves, I think.
Well, I'm not sucking up to you, but I love to leave.
That's my team.
I'm going to stand behind the line.
How do you like that guy that called before about Felix Poffen?
And about how it was this probably had the best year he ever had.
I didn't hear.
Oh, really?
That's what it does.
I didn't hear it.
He's trying to tell me about how Darren Pupus so great and Poffen isn't so good.
It was probably the best year he ever had.
Of course, it was his first year in the league.
He was a rookie, but don't confuse this guy with the fact.
I hate to disagree with that man.
He's wrong.
Yeah.
That's really wrong.
Okay.
That was great thing about him.
That's the Zito and Bobby Clark kissed and made up last night.
Yeah, you know, Anthony was working to get like Joey Reynolds now.
He keeps sneaking up behind guys and kissing him.
Guess who I met last night.
This is no shot either.
Yeah.
I met D-Man, Heizinka.
Did you?
Yeah.
He was wandering around.
He was dressed really fine.
Did you let your kiss him on the ball's ball?
No.
No.
I didn't kiss his ring.
I didn't do anything.
I guarantee that.
I guarantee that S-Zito ain't going to be coming up between behind Wayne Heizing and kissing him
on the cheek.
I guarantee you that.
Well, of course, yeah.
What do they call him?
The Waste Magna.
Or whatever.
Bad jokes.
The Waste Magna.
Yeah.
Right.
You better watch out.
You'll waste you if you don't watch it.
Hey, we're not scared of him.
He's got all the right connection.
We're not worried about him up here.
No, not at all.
Brett Gretzky's playing tonight, too.
Is he?
Yeah.
So tonight will be an exciting game.
I thought you said, wait a minute.
I thought you said you're playing the blues tonight.
Yeah.
And Gretzky's playing?
Brent Gretzky.
Oh, Brent Gretzky.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
Anyway, uh, I wish we were playing Gretzky.
I wish we were playing Gretzky.
We're playing.
I'd come over there and heistick him right in the nose.
We're going to come back up here.
What?
When are you going to come back up to Tampa?
October 9th.
October 9th.
Oh, for the Alistair.
Exactly.
Okay, I've got, I'm all excited here.
Sorry.
Come back.
And I, and when the Leafs do play up there, which is, uh,
I forget when it is the 13th or so.
Yeah, a little bit later.
Uh, I'll be up there for that.
Okay.
Good to you.
Trust me.
All right.
They call me Mr. Puck, man.
Don't forget it.
I know.
You are a Puck.
I know.
Well, look, I'm going to keep this rival regoing.
If I'm the only one.
Okay.
I'm not kidding.
Okay.
Have a good day.
See ya.
I hope Lightning kick ass tonight.
I have no problem with Lightning.
They got a nice team.
I like them.
Even though Terry Chris needs some help with this hair.
Oh, speaking of help with this hair, there's Orlando.
Look at that.
Who used to be very popular here until we found Louise McGell.
Used to be a number one in our hearts.
And in our mind, there he is.
They're good.
And I thought it was going to be real exciting.
But since we got our Louise McGell video going.
Well, we'll compare notes when he comes in here.
We have an open line on the green line.
1-800-944-9463.
It's 1135-WY-O-D-N-W-S-U-N.

Coming up tonight at a following sports talk six-thin, it's Randy Rose.
We'll talk radio six-thin, every new IOD.
So look who's here who didn't shine us today, Orlando.
Pull that thing, you know how to handle something that looks like that.
And he said, and we're watching the Luis Miguel video together here.
And you said what?
I didn't say anything.
You said, I Luis Miguel.
I was sure that's what you said.
How come you turning purple in the face already?
Huh?
No, I don't know.
I know.
I have no industry.
I bring that out with these one liners, and it's just, I bring out the best in you.
Yeah.
Or would like to anyway.
So wait, what do you think?
You think he circumcised your what?
I don't know, Neil.
Why don't you ask him?
We might.
We're making, we got some, you want to run that bias again, George?
What we got?
We got an agenda so full here today.
I may not leave the building all day.
We got the stuff coming in the mail.
We got everything coming.
You have no idea what the facts.
We got what?
The bio is coming over on the fact that the bio is coming on the facts machine.
Okay.
20 years old.
He's not circumcised from.
We'll do it for a price.
What is it?
We are Latina.
That's the Latin division of water.
So how many points you give him on a scale of 10, Orlando?
I don't know.
Just give me a guess, okay?
Damn, you, I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
In other words, what I'm trying to say is if you were like really desperate.
Yeah.
Just can't get it out of this guy.
You know, you just can't weasel anything out of you.
That's all right.
Just sit there and watch and keep your hands on the table at all time.
You said that he used to have long hair.
Yeah.
I remember watching a show a lot of people working out a lot.
Is that true?
It looked like I'll built up now like one of those.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm working out of my house.
Yeah, you were with who?
Well, anybody else?
I have a way to my house.
Yeah.
I have a membership at the gym expired.
So I'm doing a game.
How come, how come every time you come in here, you sound like a real Julio?
Well, the day that he came up before, remember the time you came up to my seat at the dolphin game?
Right.
The one time you didn't shine and showed up.
Right.
And he sounded just like like a regular guy.
And you come in here and you have that it always is like.
They're good.
Like an act.
An act.
Yeah.
You sound like you're putting us on or something.
Putting you on.
Yeah, you probably put me on the phone in Jersey or something.
Oh, no, I did live in Jersey.
I told you.
Before I came down.
Now, look at this.
Do we take care of you or what?
All right.
Here's Flores with 45 pounds.
But only one slice of pizza.
I'll tell you that right now.
Okay.
Just a little warning because if you eat the second slice.
That's it.
Thank you, sir.
You're a great American.
Okay.
Now, what is the, see how he's holding his fingers apart like that?
What is that an indication of?
He was like holding his, he was not between fingers.
He was like this, like about the two inches apart.
Is he like a message there or something?
It might be.
It might be.
I don't know.
You got to call me.
I haven't seen anybody so reluctant and so we call us to drink.
Can't just be a great day and you're like, can't be this be the day that you just, uh, I don't know.
No, but wait a minute.
What do you mean?
I act like a Julio Julio Julio.
You know what a Julio is?
Julio.
Yeah, it's like a professional Cuban, you know, it's like, uh, Julio.
That's what we call him on this show.
They love that.
Julio and don't you remember Julio and Juliad?
Aromio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio and Julio.
Now you're talking.
Okay, let's take some calls.
You can start eating by the way any time you want and the food too.
Here's the Davey on the star line.
Hello.
Yeah, hi Neil.
How you doing?
How about those panthers?
Yeah, pretty exciting.
Now wait a minute.
Are you going to go to hockey games Orlando?
Hi.
Yeah, I've never been to hockey.
I have seen it.
Okay, great.
I have season tickets.
I'm so excited.
If you got good seats here, because if you do, I hate you like poison.
Well, then I won't let you hate me.
Okay.
I'm in the upper deck, but I'm on center.
Okay.
I'm on center.
Yeah.
Okay, but those are the seats I chose.
Those are good places to throw the octopus from.
Oh my God, Tina Waltz just came in.
Oh, no.
Did you buy this?
Well, thank you so much.
God almighty, I knew we had one salesperson back there.
We had our head on straight.
Look at that.
Look at the look on.
If you can see the look on Orlando's face when I showed him this, the CD.
Oh, embarrassing.
I'd be embarrassed to have looked like that.
Well, I wish I'd looked like that.
Go ahead, sir.
Were they unbeasurable or what?
The beasur is dynamite, man.
He is unreal.
And he's real.
He's God.
He was.
I couldn't believe it.
I mean, I really, I was getting into that game when, you know, we were two men short over and over.
All these penalties.
I know I was getting into that game.
Like it was a playoff game there at one point because I mean, it was so intense.
And here was the first exhibition game we ever played.
It was intense.
It was.
It was unreal.
Yep.
And.
I hear you're also going to Vegas, huh?
Well, I wasn't planning on going to Vegas, but I just found out that Lewis, my buddy, Louis Miguel,
who is my best close personal friend is doing at Seasers this weekend.
Uh-huh.
I'm not going to Vegas.
You're not going?
I got a great restaurant for you to try.
Did a Italian restaurant?
No, actually, it's more like a steak, a seafood continental type thing.
Nice watch, Roland.
It's called Hugo's.
Yeah.
And it's in a union path.
I'll go a few go.
But they have a great Italian restaurant there, too, don't they?
The vineyard or something like, I don't know what it's called, but I've heard that the Italian restaurant in Seasers is to die from.
Oh, I don't know.
I didn't eat there.
I ate it to Delhi there in the form shop.
Yeah.
If you go, eat it to Delhi.
Okay.
It's unbelievable.
You'll have corn beef coming out of your ears.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well, listen.
Okay.
If you're psyched, I'm psyched.
I'll tell you that.
I was into it.
No wait, there's one other thing though.
Yeah.
Have you ever heard of that new game show called the Seasers Challenge?
Well, I'm odd Rashad.
No.
Okay, it's taped at the Seasers.
Vagely, yeah.
It's taped at that Seasers.
Well, when I went in July, I was a contestant on that game show.
Really?
Yes.
How'd you make out?
How'd they make out?
I don't want to talk about that.
Oh, bad question, huh?
Yeah, but it was fun being on the show and it was pretty wild to meet on my Rashad.
Yeah, he's okay.
He is okay.
He never stole a freight train.
He's not.
Oh, God.
Sir, I'm going to have to leave you now.
Like Luca Broughtzi said, he said,
I know it's your busy man today, your daughter's wedding.
Okay.
Good luck you're back.
Take it easy.
Oh, my God, we're going to have to terminate the show right now.
Look at that.
Look at that.
Don't look at it too close, Orlando.
You might start getting nervous.
He is turning such a dark shade of purple man in his face, too.
Anyway, it's 1146 at WYOD and WSUN.
Boy, that Tina, man.
She knows how to do it.
Here's an incredible thing, man.
Marlin fans get a Marlin season's the first limited edition baseball for just $3.99
when you buy any subway footlong sandwich chips and a medium Coca-Cola classic
at any participating subway store.
Now, the baseball has the Florida Marlins inaugural logo and blazing right on one side
and a list of commemorative firsts on the other like the first game, the first win,
the first pitch, the first home run, etc., etc.
Subway, the place where fresh is the taste and subway, of course, known for their great
fresh baked bread and fresh veggies and sandwiches and salads made right before the eyes,
the way you like them.
Subway, the only place you can get the Marlins season the first limited edition baseball

roast beef, veggie or cheese, just to name a few.
You pick out the one you like and also get a piece of Marlin's history at the same time.
A commemorative season the first baseball for just $3.99 when you buy any footlong sandwich,
chips and a medium Coca-Cola classic at any participating subway store.
Limit two-procustomer please, while supplies last only.
They all played.
Well, that's great.
And you're in here, diddling around with the food.
They all played.
What an asshole, man.
We're busy in here.
You're not mine.
Well, how was I supposed to hear it, you idiot?
How do you know they all played?
You assumed they all played.
They're all the lights are flashing.
That's only a little bit of Luis Miguel.
Maybe they never fired.
We're too busy showing on net Luis Miguel and she said that looks good to me,
but he needs a haircut.
This hair looks okay to me.
So we're in here.
We got so how about Orlando?
What he doing a pinch?
We can't get Luis Miguel in here today, huh?
What are you looking over there for?
He's over here.
Okay, she's so goddamn bashful, man.
Her husband's going to hear about this.
She'll be finished for life.
Everybody is so intimidated, so bashful, man.
I'm not bashful.
Just watch.
Okay, here's a lady in North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
This is Marlon.
I got the tickets from you on Tuesday.
He gave me for my birthday to the Marlon's game.
And...
And I had a really good time except they totally blew.
Except for the fact that they're in a coma now.
You picked a bad time to go.
You picked a really good time to pick the worst time.
I swear, the weather was great.
You know, I mean, it was nice that it drizzled like two seconds.
But, uh, man, they really just totally blew.
They bit the big one, yeah.
Yeah, I was kind of upset about that.
Did you go?
No.
You didn't go.
Well, flying over the stadium with a...
Flying over the stadium was like a twin engine.
Yeah.
And his engine stalled out right over the stadium.
Now, that's not the guy that was carrying the gigantic banner of Markey Markin, his Calvin Klein's wallet.
No, no.
He wasn't carrying a banner, but his engine stalled out right over the stadium.
Oh, that's great.
And all you can do is everybody just breathing in.
It was great.
Hmm.
What a rush.
Beautiful.
I think for the next dolphin game to turn our luck around instead of having that Markey Mark poster up there,
we'll have Orlando and his Calvin Klein's like trailing over the dolphin game.
There you go.
For the Red Skin.
How would I say?
Red Skin's in four skins.
Oh, here's ESEA.
Now, we have to...
Now, before we do...
We got to rewind the tape.
Okay, for ESEA.
Can you see on the VCR down there below?
Where it says rewind?
That one.
You have to give instructions and not rewind.
I have to give instructions.
The wireless is a crappy VCR.
You're folded down.
There you go.
Just keep holding it.
Here we go.
A little longer.
A little longer.
You bet anytime.
Okay, let it go.
Let it go.
Hit play.
Play.
Believe me, you see, you'll appreciate this.
You'll thank me for this and your will.
Okay.
She's a big Luis Miguel fan.
She's obsessed.
Anyway, go ahead.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
I just wanted to call somebody a douchebag.
Okay.
Paula, you are a big beautiful, teeny tiny.
It's a bitty little douchebag.
Okay, I'm glad you had a good time.
It's part of the fact.
I can't be responsible for our team sucking a big one.
But it was still fun.
Thanks a lot, Nick.
Well, that's good.
Bye-bye.
See ya.
We're on the air in here.
Okay, you want the audio here.
Get out of the way, Bob.
She wants the audio too.
She may have an accident in here before we're finished.
This woman is such a gigantic Luis Miguel fan.
If she knew that he was at Caesar's in Vegas this weekend,
I might even take you if you speak real nice to me.
Would Joey Reynolds, yeah?
Yeah, but you don't have to sell me, okay, Andy?
And look at this Tina being the great goddess that she is,
went out and look what she bought.
Yeah.
She is Tina's a goddess.
Say, if you can't see them, join them.
That's what they say, right, Orlando?
Can't see them, join them.
We're starting to do the whole show in Spanish all now.
See you, Neil.
See this.
That's the famous Orlando.
Would you like to sit on his lap for a little while?
Until you're a married woman.
Did that make a difference before?
Look at Anna Maria laughing at that one.
I shouldn't have mentioned Anna Maria, sir.
I'll get for a giri in here again.
Here is every time I mentioned your name, he comes in and
they're all going to start again.
They're going to start again.
Keep him out of here.
Would you please go get him something to do like some...
Have him clean the latrine downstairs.
That one that was overflowing yesterday.
I don't want to do this in the middle of lunch,
but I'm telling you, if there wasn't something from outer space
in this building yesterday, oh, God.
He must have thought this was a bank,
because he left the biggest deposit I have ever seen in my life.
Yeah, yeah, there was a New Year's gift.
Here's Tampa.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, happy Friday.
And the same to you.
Thank God.
So about time, huh?
I got so many choices now.
I can go to Vegas this weekend or I can stay around
and watch videos or whatever.
But do you think your obsession is going to be back in time
from Monday show?
Probably.
What was that guy's bottom earlier about the booster
couldn't even carry Poppins to dock stuff across the creek?
Wasn't that a joke?
Oh, man.
Well, look at him.
He wouldn't know Felix Poppant from Dennis Poppant.
Yeah.
Who, by the way, last night, wait, no, you didn't hear the,
because you're over there.
So you didn't hear the telecast on Sunshine?
No.
Dennis Poppant will be okay eventually once he comes out of his coma.
He's a little.
I don't think they realize that Poppant had the lowest goal
to get that record.
No, no, Dennis.
Dennis, Dennis, not Felix.
Dennis, Dennis Poppant, the one who's like doing the color on the TV.
Yeah, I'm not talking about Felix.
You don't have to sell me on Felix.
Felix Poppant is God.
Anyways, what happened to that number 26
when you guys as bench is, what did you get to stick up
his nose or something?
Who's that?
Some guy, you, when the line changes are going on,
he got like a stick up his nose, had to carry him off the ice.
Oh, yeah, he got to cut on the ice.
Yeah.
He'll be alright.
Yeah, you got a good looking team there.
Yeah.
Thanks for the beavers.
Let me all right, I'm telling you.
Oh, no, he's like God.
Man, it was for that.
We'd be up three or four goals more than what we were.
Yeah, that's right.
In fact, if they were left him in the whole game,
I hate to break the news to you, but we would have won the game.
Yeah.
What was I going to say?
Oh, jeez, for God.
And it was all on the fourth floor, all on the fourth floor,
over an hour.
That's why you forgot.
That's the way we planted.
And it works like a charm, doesn't it?
Yeah, y'all look pretty sleazy in the first period,
but I guess you got that fire then.
You know, you know, you know, you're underneath your butt.
Yeah, the period went well.
Wait a minute.
How about the lightning in the first period?
You guys had a two-man advantage over and over again,
and couldn't score at Kathy Willow's house.
Let's get serious.
I know, 50 minutes of that game was a penalty.
You guys couldn't score at Orlando's brisk.
Yeah, the big demilodlet showed us a few times.
I know, the sort of Bradley they whiffed right there on the open net.
Yeah.
But, um, yeah.
And that one, Bradley had the whole open net, man.
He just choked big.
I know, he just, he was choked.
He was excited.
I was like, happy birthday, and he just, you know,

Open line and, bro, boy, so much excitement going on in here.
You would almost think we didn't even have a radio show.
I wonder how much dead air there was at the end of that break.
Huh?
We'll never know.
Maybe the lady in North Miami Beach can tell us hello.
Uh, I have to be blind, but that shouldn't stop.
We have an open line and, day, 751.
Do you believe that?
Now, someone, now we got people playing tapes of blind, Mike, on here.
That's the best part.
Maybe they wanted to pull them out.
Maybe they had some jingles they wanted to play the pull them out of his show on WSBH.
Huh?
Under blind.
What is that beast stand for in SBH?
Blind?
Huh?
South Beach blind station?
Or they should call this one that because this station basically consisted of the blind leading the blind.
Here is Clearwater.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing, Neil?
Pretty good, sir.
You really have to excuse the people in the West Coast.
They really don't know a pluck from a pluck, you know.
They really don't know hockey.
From a pluck?
Yeah, a pluck, you know.

I'm sure he's letting it all hang out at the Little Rocks Museum, you know?
That's the one?
At the Liberty Museum.
Yeah, all right.
You know it, you know it.
Hey, I got a shameful request.
I really enjoy this song.
Can you play stuck on a bench in Del Rey for me?
How about sitting on a bench?
Well, whatever.
In your case, stuck on a bench may be true, but, uh, in Randy's case, it would be stuck on a bench.
Yeah, well, you know how that is.
Can you do that for me?
Yes.

Very neat not one of the unclean masses out there like Orlando

Sand is on the other side now meaning what she's listening to Jerry is he really yeah, all I can say to that is oh
Hallelujah, thank God we got rid of her
She's working on the English only campaign now. I believe that yeah, she and she and Sandy are gonna start the by anti bilingual campaign
Good that's sandy to the power of two
Well, what's going on with you guys? You sound like you're having a little falling out
Something I just like to bust the chops once in all good the audience hates you're like poison by the way
She's even down for about a week
So I'll be here all by myself really. Yeah, so you want to come over? No

And a kid went home and he got a gun and he said but I'm being that's it and the guy
Your new staff is very selective on what they report. Yeah, they don't tell you that well

Right you go home and you get a gun and you blow their crap away
But I be right just like that but I'm being

Now you have to you have to know he looks a lot different now when he first started. Yeah, he used to have this
You know shoulder length hair. Oh, and all he would do that's what Orlando said he said he used to have hair down to his public
It was gross and all he would do is jump around and stage and just yank his hair and all the growth
He used to jump around and yank it yank it and his hair too
Uh-huh he would just pull the tug of his hair on the front and then he'd do like an Elvis move
Yeah, oh he was gross but now in other words he was trying to be like Michael Jackson
He'd grab it at his uh thing and jump it around a lot and molesting little boys
This huge mansion and alcapocal. Yeah, and he has all these wild parties

Well, maybe we can slip in if there's that many people there. They'll never notice us. I'm saying you can slip in

It's about to take off into orbit
You know Neil
Ornanda has a real sexy voice. He does. You ever see Orlando? No, I'm nervous. Oh my god

What? What do you like chubby guys? No, not Joey, but he just looks like a real young kid. Oh, that's why you like him

Orlando's 28 Orlando's 28. He's a male model. Oh, there you go
He was in the men from Cuba calendar in which all the other guys were ugly and he was out of this world
Out of this world. I'm gonna tell you something or Orlando
You lucked out because you stood out and you must have had something to do with that
You must have some pull if I could get it. What's that? Huh? What's that? He stood out
It's stood out. No really because if you go down on South Beach
You will see so many beautiful Cuban guys. I mean really hot-looking guys. Am I right? Yeah, you do
I'm asking him. Oh, but no

Yeah, huh? Because he's turning a deeper shade of pale man because he is the mama's listing right now
I get very embarrassed easily your mom listen to this your mama. Yeah, your mama
My mama. Yeah, why mama? Why mama
But anyway, so they could have probably found a lot of really hot-looking guys
Down here on South Beach, but they had all these ugly guys in an Orlando who's like a 45 on a scale of three
Yeah, so he stood out. That's why he became a big star now
So he's in a calendar and he's in he's in everything if you open up any magazine
