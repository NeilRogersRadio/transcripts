Some stations give you cars.
Some stations give you cash.
But not this station.
Uh-uh.
Because this station is bro.
Flat dead busted.
So this station is going to give you a c-
Things in it.
Wear it on your head.
Pull it out.
Give it to someone else.
It's your cardboard box and you can do anything you want with it.
It's a six-sided cardboard party.
Just be the tenth color when you hear this sound.
Maybe overnight guys sound like this.
It's a big, empty cardboard box.
Ooh, nice.
Keep listening to it.
Or are you telling you're a bastard?
1018 at WIOD.
Have a great day, Mike.
Anyway, 98,429.
Did I give that?
I think I did.
That's the Camilla House Total.
We're creeping and crawling along.
Don't forget the tailgate party on Sunday before the game.
This place, I'm telling you, I could just...
Why don't I just do like a whole week?
Get it out of my system.
I had a long draining call from Tom Velvita from WSU
and just before I came on a year.
So I'm really not psychologically prepared to say hello.
Goodbye or burger you today.
I'll burger you, I think I could handle a couple of times.
Here's Pembroke Pines on the Starline.
Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.
How you doing?
Okay, listen, I heard about that stress test that you don't want to take.
I think it's a volume 201.
That's the one.
That's something...
But you do go on the treadmill for a little while.
Oh, do you?
Yeah, don't let them say no.
And there's a nurse standing by with a needle
to put in some radio isotopes.
Yeah.
You have photo imaging, you know.
Yeah.
It is a little bit invasive, but it isn't a terrible test
because you go as far as you can.
And they say when you're ready to drop that on the treadmill,
go with that.
Go with that.
Go with that.
Go with that.
Go with another 30 seconds.
Right.
Keep doing it until you're crowed.
Right, exactly.
But keep going and be sure to sign this check before you're crowed.
Everybody over there.
Did you have it?
Yes, I did.
And found out I had what they called a...
A heart attack in a pass.
In the pass.
Yes, sometimes it goes again, bend it down.
Yeah.
I think that's silent heart attack.
And so what do they do now?
Nothing.
They did absolutely nothing.
They took the money from your insurance, though, right?
Yes, that they did.
Thousands of dollars.
But so at least now you have the benefit of knowing.
I'm sure that will make you sleep a lot better tonight.
I know you.
You're a sight-time and you're distant past you had a heart attack and you didn't even know it.
And of course could have another one at any given moment.
Exactly.
Right.
No treatment or nothing.
Great.
Well, congratulations.
Thanks, Neil.
You survived it.
Lots of luck if you take it.
It's not the worst.
Let me keep it me.
I mean, I'd go over there yesterday $250 to say hello to take some more blood on another EKG,
which looks the same as all the other ones.
That's terrible.
Un-un-conscionable.
Keep blasting away at them.
Have a great day.
You too.
These doctors, man, find in a good doctor in this town,
like looking for a Jew in Tampa.
I mean, let's get serious.
Just absolutely unbelievable.
Impossible.
It's just like automatic here.
Here, take the blood and let me lie down and put the crap on my, that cream on my chest.
No, not that.
And take the EKG and take a look.
It's fine.
It's the same.
Of course, it's fine.
I don't have any heart problems.
I've got fungus problems.
That's my problem.
There's a fungus among us, man.
So, George tells me that as we speak here, they are working on the ear...
They're working on it.
I'm not sure if it's the ear conditioning they're working on, but he said they're working on it.
Yeah, I believe it.
It sounds like it.
Here's the lady in Poppano Beach.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Neil.
Yes, man.
I'm a...
No.
It's a very, very long time.
Oh, are we going to do a Hello Doctor today for four hours?
No, this is going to be so depressing.
No, it isn't.
Bring me the gun.
You have every right to refuse treatment to refuse that EKG.
That's what patients are afraid to do with Buckepteer doctors.
Yeah, is what?
They're afraid to buck them.
They think they're gods.
Oh, buck them.
Buck, buck, buck, buck.
Buck.
B.
I got it.
And not only that, that's allium.
Stress shouldn't cost two to three thousand dollars.
That rich was Tommy last night at the track that he just had it done a short while ago.
It was almost three thousand dollars.
Oh, are you the same person?
Yes.
And I don't have...
I only have hospitalization.
I don't have outpatient kind of insurance or medical insurance.
That's a ripple.
So I have to pay for it myself.
And not only that, I don't think I need it.
I don't think I have coronary artery blackage, blackage or blockage.
I don't have... I'm in China.
I don't have chest pain.
I have allergies.
And this man is going to...
He's going to make sure one thing.
I don't have any problem in my bank account because it'll be empty.
You better say no.
Thank you, sir, and find yourself another M-date.
Right.
How do I do that?
How do I find a good allergist?
How do I...
I'm going to get the tree lady and find an allergist who can help me with my malaluka and W-I-O-D, a fungus mold problem.
Allergy is probably the thing with air conditioning in there, right?
Right.
My house...
Sinus headaches.
That's got nothing to do with having blocked arteries.
You don't get sinus headaches.
Tell me about it.
I had open heart surgery 10 years ago.
Yeah.
And I had a PET scan, which is the new...
A PET scan?
They're not touching my dogs.
I'll tell you that.
Tell them to scan this.
I had nothing to do with your feet.
Scan this, Doc.
Nothing to do with your feet.
Listen, it isn't invasive as far as isotopes being injected, but there is no...
I know it's just...
It's described the whole thing to me.
He said they put the stuff in your...
The chemicals in your veins, and then they tell you to lie down and relax.
And at one point it feels like you're having a heart attack, but that passes real fast.
Real fast.
They stress the heart with the medication.
Well, it's not that wonderful.
That's just what I need is that my heart filled up with a bunch of chemicals.
It's just great.
You get a lot of stress that work.
At least they can reverse this.
Right.
That's right.
Have a great day.
You too.
Take care of yourself, Neil.
And don't forget to buck the system.
No, I'm trying.
I'm trying.
See ya.
We have two open lines on our amazing board here.
And of course, they're both inbroward.
We're quite frankly, they don't give a crap if anybody croaks.
Because it's like a daily thing inbroward.
Everybody's dying over there.
5249463, and the one just dropped off in date, and one just dropped off on the out of townline.
We're up back to that again.
We're back to that kind of crap again.
1025.
Isn't Cheryl?
Is that man gonna be here later on today?
Because that was something.
I don't want to go through that whole story again.
Like I'm supposed to sit here and be just, be just all emotion, let baby gravy line got canned.
Good.
Nice going, Elaine.
I always knew she was a good bitch.
Here's a Pemberpines on the starline.
Hello.
What the hell was that?
What was that?
I just punched it and it went dark.
Here's a, oh no, I'm not talking to you.
Get out of here, tree lady.
Go away.
Here's four Myers.
Hello.
Yeah.
This Clint, I called yesterday.
You're about the 21 year old over here.
Yeah, Clint.
And I just want to start getting chronic, are you Clint?
No, no, no, no.
Just once or twice.
I got a couple days off.
Okay.
Florida has the highest rate of malpractice than any other state in the country.
You tell him Clint.
Isn't that just a crock of shot?
Right.
It's just ridiculous.
Crock of crap is what it is.
And what you're saying about sales people?
Sales people have to come to you.
If you're sick, you have to go to one of those doctor holes.
Right.
And your life is in their hands.
They're holding your thing in your, their hands.
Exactly.
Exactly.
And I think, you know, there's got to be, I don't know if it's just, they're saying like,
they're going to start putting prices up in the waiting rooms.
I don't know what they need to do, but it just, there's got to be a drastic change.
Doctors have to go through a lot more regulations and everything.
It seems like.
But that's a different story.
That's a different story.
Over here in Fort Myers, we KM is doing something Larry King live.
There's not going to be live anymore.
This is going to be a tape delay.
And it's going to be aired from like 9 to noon.
And they're trying to do a little competition with you.
And I mean, I listen Larry King.
I like him, but I just think it's kind of bad that Larry Kiss is too much ass for our, like, in pal.
This, this is true.
This is true, but I just think it's not fair to him by delaying him.
Well, he's, uh, send him a check for $50 and he'll be okay.
Have a great day, Clint.
All right.
Take it.
Yeah, and don't make a habit of this.
We have an open line in Broward 524 and all three of our big, vast Florida lines are sitting there like a dead lump.
So anyway, getting back to the thing I had with Tom Velvito this morning and I have a really, very grave misgivings about the whole idea of going over there to Tampa.
So I can sit in a room and go through all kinds of technical incompetence for two days.
And I can't seem to convey that to him.
See, the deal would have been to have me and Rick and Sudzen Rande all go over there like on a weekend and make like a couple of appearances and some big shopping malls and meet some people and signs of autographs.
And like get involved with the community and like see some sponsors and like start like being really a part of the radio station.
He doesn't understand that.
He doesn't understand that and I had like a long gnashing, thrashing, screaming, shouting and he still doesn't understand it because he's a works for Cox Broadcasting.
$189.44 WY, what is, when you tell me what's going on there with those Broward lines, what is going on?
What is going on?
What?
Cranks a thing?
Ad holes? Well that's great.
It's 11 before 11 on the IOT network.
And that's the way it is on the West Coast.
Absolutely nothing. All three of those lines are...
BEEP
As dead as a door nail. Here is Miramar. Hello.
Hello. Yes, sir.
Hi, Neil.
Yeah. How was your holiday?
What? How was your holiday?
Great.
All right. I'm a second time call. I just called from...
I just moved back from Jacksonville.
Yeah. I was wondering if you could play it from all from...
No chance.
Let's go to a keep us game. Hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you hitting him?
Okay.
You're talking about all this magma in your AC vents?
Yes, that is correct.
That is really disgusting, isn't it?
Grotesque.
I went to a bar. I won't mention the name of the bar.
You know what I mean? Big daddy.
But above the ice well is this AC vent with all this growth on it.
I mean, it looked like a green forest.
Yeah.
So I was so disgusted. I put on my body. I said, look, look for all the ice wells.
Look at all this AC vent right above it.
So Neil, let's just say we walk out of there.
Uh-huh.
But I went to another bar, and this is the reason I called.
They have a drink there called the Amy Fisher cocktail.
Have you heard of that?
Have a great day, pal.
We have an open line in day, 7-5-1.
We have one in Broward, 5-2-4.
We have two on the Tampa for Myers out of town out of your mine line, which I think we're all done now.
I'm not coming up there, Tom.
Okay, stick that station in your butt.
Here's the mobile in Cooper City. Hello.
Yeah, hello.
Yeah. Yeah, how are you?
Okay.
A couple of things I wanted to mention to you.
First time you calling you, I like your program.
I'm a chiropractor.
Oh, God.
It's just going to be all like, man, we're going to revert back to KAT today just because I mentioned about the doctor of events today.
Oh, God.
Good thing.
So, we're already dying this year.
It's just what we need to do to kill this show.
No, no.
Turn the demographic to death plus.
Two things I want to say.
I'll come back to the second one in just a second.
Regarding a restaurant, let me mention one great restaurant for you.
Yeah.
I have no part ownership of it.
Reneerie.
You've been there.
I would blow up university.
Reneerie.
Reneerie.
I tell you one thing.
I didn't know we had a restaurant.
Do you remember Ronaldo's facade?
Ronaldo the chef?
No.
Well, Ronaldo now owns Reneerie.
And they've been around to all the best restaurants around.
So, when he wants to start spending some money on his show, I'll be glad to give him some publicity.
Okay, I'll have to tell him.
They're real busy.
Anyways, just check that out in your own time.
One thing I want to tell you, just as a chiropractor.
I have a program.
I've been after the last five years on a weekly program.
I'm out here to advertise.
I was very busy practicing North-Dade.
But this one, let me mention one thing to you.
And reference to your immune system.
And reference to people getting sick and everything else.
They should look more into chiropractic because people look...
Oh, get out of here.
We have an open line.
And this guy is worse than the Dan Abel from the ceramic art gallery or whatever that was the other day.
We have an open line in Dade, 751, 2 in the Broward, 524, 1 on the...
What is this show turning into?
What is this whole radio station turning into this year?
Just horror radio?
Everybody's just going to call and use this and abuse this?
Is that it?
Comes on here, wants to make a pitch for chiropractic.
Go out there and buy some time.
Go out there on the light bulb.
Go out there and make a speech at a condo complex.
Get out of my face, you asshole.
You quack?
My brother was a chiropractor for years and I know a quack when I see one.
1056, let's go to the Grove.
God, hello.
Yo, Neil.
Yes, sir. How about trying chiropractic, sir?
Let me crack your thing for you.
Yeah, right.
Tell him to crack this.
Good morning.
Yeah.
Listen, I've got a couple of these going to rick and stick.
We're talking about the...
Crack rhymes with quack.
Okay, but listen.
We never hear the end of chase stories, right?
You never hear the end of it.
I got one on the porkers, the core gable.
A 57 and five on you.
40th, right?
I'm going to...
Let me ask you something.
What are you doing with your phone?
Are you eating it or talking into it?
I'm not talking into it.
Sounds like it's about two thirds of the way down your throat now.
Oh, in my throat.
And you're all muzzled.
Muzzled.
Oh, you, I'm telling you something.
I'm going to just take a hydrogen bomb and put it inside of your body.
Green.
Bob Green is in there.
I'm really...
I'm going to take like a neutron bomb and put it inside that man's body.
Guess where I'm going to start sticking in it?
I can't hear you, sir.
You're just incoherent and unintelligible.
I'm not trying to be cantankerous today, but I want callers who are like A under the
age of 100 and B have a phone that somebody can hear what the conversation is.
And in his case, quite frankly, I think it was a pubic service we couldn't understand it.
We have two open lines in date.
751, here's Miami.
Hello?
Hey, Neal, I think I fit.
I qualify for both A and B under 100 and I think you can't hear me on this phone.
Great phone.
Great caller.
Probably has nothing to say, but we don't care at this point.
Don't leave us, pal.
Just be just like, hmm, like sounds like you're alive out there.
That's all we care.
Let's talk to this.
I apologize to the entire audience.
I made a mistake.
All I did was mention my doctor thing because I think it was important for people to understand
the way doctors rip us all off and abuse us and use it and right away, hello, Neal.
Every caller was like my mother plus 100 years.
They're like my thuislas grandma there today and we got chiropractors peddling chiropractic
and proctologists sticking their phone up your ass.
I don't want to talk about this crap.
Let's get to it, pal.
Let's so when a doubt clean that video.
Neal, what a great show.
I mean, you have, you've had me cracked up here.
Listen, I have a...
Don't say crack again.
A chiropractor will call back.
I wouldn't ever...
You want to crack yours, I think.
Listen, if you know about most people,
most of those chiropractors may have a float.
Excuse me, I have an expert here that I'd like to tell you something.
A lettuce?
Hi Neal.
Hi.
Listen.
Yes?
I sympathize with you about the doctor's concern.
Oh God.
I went to...
I haven't seen, okay?
Hello, doctor.
Yeah!
You're killing me, doctor.
I went to Bill and the shabbat doctor.
Listen, they ordered this test.
I can no go to this other doctor unless I have those tests on hand, right?
Yeah.
I got to the other doctor.
I have the test.
So I said, so...
So?
Yeah, what did he say?
What's the result of the test?
And what did he say?
So he said, oh, when you have to go to the doctor, who ordered the test?
To know the result, I said, no, I want to know now what the results are, okay?
He goes through the...
Well, they are not normal.
You have to go back to the other doctor.
But the other doctor is not that special piece.
So he calls me.
He says, you have to go to this other doctor.
But the end of this, I am going to spend hundreds per hundred per money.
Thousands of dollars.
They're going to fleece every dime out of your body.
They're going to reach into the very innards of your existence and take every dime, every nickel,
every last penny that you've got and twist and turn and squeeze it out.
Boy, and they manage to create all this.
That's their motto.
When it's out, squeeze it out.
That's what they call the hypocritical oath.
That's for sure.
That I agree with you.
Well, don't take any crap, okay?
I agree.
And have a great day.
You too.
Bye-bye.
See you.
Now, what the hell was that all about?
He passed it off to her.
We got something to pass off for you.
Here's another article.
Sick buildings warning the state toxicologist says.
Quit breathing in that mong.
Get on the ceiling and clean the crap off.
This is South Florida's news, traffic and weather station.
1138.
You know, I was just thinking during the break if the male member could speak what might it say?
Of course, they only had one eye.
We have an open line in date, 751.
Maybe that's why it has such bad aim sometime.
In a date county, 751-9463, here's Miami on the starline.
Hello.
Miami on the starline.
Hello and goodbye.
What a bad break for them.
Miami.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi. How are you?
How are you?
I'm fine.
This is Neil.
Hello, Neil.
Hello, Neil.
Hey, Neil.
Neil, Neil.
Yeah.
Hi.
What do you want?
Okay. Yes.
I was just going to talk to you.
When you slow down, I'm going to take a deep breath and calm down, man.
You sound like you're on a verge of a spastic experience.
Well, I just don't know if I'm on or not.
You're on.
I just said yes.
I said hello.
I'm trying to be like friendly.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
I was just listening to you earlier about your problem with your air conditioning.
And I was watching TV on an import-lotted ale.
There was one apartment building and the living room and the bedrooms and so forth.
It was all green due to the air conditioning.
It was an oversized unit.
An oversized unit?
Yes, sir.
And what it would do, it would make the room feel real cold and wet.
And that was the problem.
It was going real cold and wet.
Yes, it would be an oversized unit.
And it would just make the fungus and so forth grow.
And that's what they need to do there is probably put a less...
Less cold and less wet.
Pardon?
I said they need to straighten it out.
Yes, make a...
Put a smaller unit in there and dry it out.
And where is the one that's in there can cool it down.
But then a smaller one would take over after it reached the proper temperature and dry out the air.
Right.
Well, I think you just hit it on the head.
So because fungus won't grow all by itself and usually doesn't and when it does it has to have something to feed it such as moist air that...
Or the real Adele.
Well, enjoy your day and I'd love to listen to you.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
My mother's the guy who just straighten out our whole problem here for the building.
Just get a new unit.
Less so cold and less wet.
Two open lines, they both endade.
751, wake up and sniff this.
Okay, let's get with it in date County and stop pretending like we're in Broward today.
Since the new year, that's where the problem is now.
It's moved to date.
Tampa.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
I love that car, man.
What is that?
You know what, Sammy Davis Jr said that Dean White?
For Christ's sake, I only had one eye.
There you go.
That was...
You got some Godfather 3 minutes here?
That's why Colombo could never find the culprit, you know?
For Christ's sake, I only had one eye.
Yeah.
That's the best.
Got some Godfather music?
I just might.
All right.
Or not as the case might be, all depending.
All right.
Yeah.
Bingo.
Link to the mob.
Yeah.
Have you heard about this?
What?
Seminal reservations.
Tied to organized crime.
Says who?
Says some federal...
They just want to get the bingo and the slot machines out there, not kidding me.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Anyways, man, how about those lightning?
Why, what'd they do?
They win a game?
Yeah, finally.
When was that?
Last night, he'd be king.
Oh, and the Leafs of course got beat.
Yeah, they did.
So you guys are making a little movement now, huh?
Yeah, right.
Not much, just a little one.
That's all right.
Might have two going to the All Star game.
Nice going, eh?
Yeah, how about that Brian Bradley?
Finally, yeah, 31.
He's doing it, boy.
He is.
We sure don't need him on the Leafs.
Well, anyways, I have a great day and get that mong.
Okay.
Later.
See ya.
Oh, there was.
You just mentioned it and started flying out of there.
We have an open line on the out of town line, 1-800-2 a date again.
Date County, man, we are finished in date.
We are dead meat.
We are history.
We are over.
We are through Adios.
Farewell.
Muchachos.
Huh?
We better start speaking in Creole.
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hey, Dr. Joshua, you better.
Well, Alicia, see how quick I am?
I don't even have to dump her today.
We just got to the mother.
We didn't even get to the burger part.
Mother burger.
I remember her.
There was Warren Burgers mother.
Open line on the floor to line, 1-800-2 still in date.
Date County, if you do not call now in the next 30 seconds,
I'm going to take this chicken soup and stick it right through your radio
and make you just stick your thing in it, okay?
God, are you pathetic?
Just anti-social?
Have nothing to say?
Uninvolved.
We got the big game coming up on Sunday.
We've got the events.
W-I-O-D.
Let's date County.
Let me talk to Neil.
W-I-O-D.
Let's put Neil Roger.
What is it?
Neil Roger, please.
Two old.
Like I said, let's talk to somebody in date County is under the age of 500.
I don't want to talk to any more of these oldie moldies.
Okay, we got enough mold in this room already.
I want to talk to some people who are young and vibrant
and still can feel something somewhere deep in the recesses of their body and mind, okay?
W-I-O-D.
Like I said, there's a good one.
It's 1143.
Let's go to Tampa.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hi, Neil.
Listen, this is from Tampa.
I want to welcome you to Tampa.
Make sure you get over here.
Yeah, a fat chance.
They should have put you in a better model.
Listen, I have a solution to this.
Well, what does that mean?
Delim in Tampa.
Yeah.
And that is teach the bug how to play baseball.
During the off-football season.
Okay, pal.
Good luck to him.
We have an open line on the other town line.
I don't think I want to go over there, you know?
It's just going to be a waste of time.
See, my idea of a good time would for all of us.
Randy Rickensod, yours truly.
We all go over there.
We go and make like a couple of appearances and like some big malls.
We like do some shows.
We hang out together and just screw around and have a good time.
And meet some clients and talk to some salespeople
and get us involved over there.
Not we bring Neil over here and sit him inside of an empty room
and have a technical nightmare for four hours for a couple of days.
And Tom takes him out to a restaurant that he doesn't want to go to
and slips him over to the hockey game in the middle of a cow palace.
That's not my idea of a good time or anything that's going to be productive.
But what they want to do is exploit my body for fun and profit over there.
Oh yeah, we got this great TV show and they're willing to tape it.
They usually do it live.
But they're even willing to tape it.
They want you to be the, I said, well, what's it all about?
What are we going to talk about?
Well, I don't know.
But what does that mean?
What the hell is that?
Oh, but everybody watches it.
It's another one of those local, local, local live audience.
Like Joey used to do.
You know, on Channel 10, another one of those pieces of crap.
And I'm trying to explain to this, Yokel over there.
I said, that's not what gets the job done.
That isn't what builds cum.
That's not what gets people to tune in.
That's not what it's all about.
They know nothing.
They just, and there's no dealing with these people because they're not going to change.
I mean, they're not going to wake up tomorrow and suddenly become smart
because if they had been smart in the first place, Cox broadcasting would have hired him.
One thing about this company, they will never hire anybody who knows more than they do up in Atlanta,
which is basically nothing.
So you have to owe points.
You have to know less than nothing for them to hire you.
That's why boy gearier is here.
And Bob Greed.
Here's a mobile and four-letter mail.
Neil, how are you?
Pretty good, sir.
Welcome to our parade, man.
We're doing it.
We're getting ready for the big game.
We're going to kick some ass.
That's it.
They're going to call you the man of money.
Right.
Need to have the favor of you.
Yeah.
Just say hello to a friend named Larry who's suffering from Bell palsy.
Really?
And have an hell of a hard time with it.
And I knew you would cheer him up if you could just step you words to him.
Or give him your man enough of that.
Okay, get a new phone pound.
Get out of my face with you, Dan.
Crap.
I'm sure he feels better now, don't you?
11.45.
What kind of crap is that, Sam?
Few words.
Yeah, like it's never going to go away, man.
You're going to be a geek the rest of your life.
Quit drooling, will you?
Here's a mobile in plant city.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
How are you doing?
Pretty good.
Good, man.
I just want to call and tell you, man.
You've got to wipe that crap off your chin.
Will your people are starting to talk, Larry.
Man, you're the best guy in talk radio that ever could happen.
That's what my mom says.
Better than all fat, loud ass limbo.
Right.
Let me tell you.
I'm sick of you.
I just want to call him, basically.
Call a bunch of people at douchebag if you'll let me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why are you so defensive?
You think I won't let you do this?
No, I know you'll let me do it.
You know I will let you do it?
I know.
You think I'll let you do it.
I think I'll let you do it.
All right.
I know.
I just want to tell all the people are listening to Brandon.
You guys are a bunch of low life douchebag.
I feel better.
See ya.
See ya.
We have an open line in Brandon.
I tell you that Fort Myers audience is really positive.
Aren't they?
They are involved.
We got, what's that kid's name?
The colleague of the day, who's 21, Clark Kent.
Huh?
Clint.
Boy.
Joey wants a date, Clint.
His new girlfriend is not cooperating lately, you said.
So when's the wedding?
And about six years, he said.
They don't want to rush into anything.
Oh, God.
Man.
I think I knocked loose a whole bunch of extra spores today.
No charge.
New spores at WIOD.
That's why this station kind of grows on you.
Here's a Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
That's me, huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
Listen, I'm in the duck cleaning business.
You're in the duck cleaning business?
Yep.
Well, we call it systems decontamination.
And I thought I'd share a couple of things with you and your listeners that may describe
how these problems start and how they can prevent them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What happens is a lot of the dirt gets through the filter because people aren't very good at cleaning them.
And they don't use very good ones.
And the dirt gets into the system, into the coils and so on.
And it works its way deep into your duck.
Right?
Well, what happens is it gets wet.
Your duck gets wet.
The dirt gets wet and starts to grow mold, mildew fungus, bacteria, and fire.
And then the crap starts working its way into the bottles of your duck.
That's right.
At that point, it spores, it blows up into the docks.
It blows up into the docks and on you.
And the way to treat it, the best way is just to buy good filters and prevent it.
But of course we have methods for treating it and so on.
We're also in the air conditioning booth.
So is there anything you'd like to know?
No.
Fluffin' Piffy, I just had a great idea to get even with Rick Riley for the briefcase episode.
Guess what I have in my pocket or just whipped out of my pocket just now.
Here are Rick Riley's four playoff tickets.
Yeah!
Now we're having a little problem last couple of days raising money for Camilla's house.
Because it's after the holidays, it's the new year.
People are like, they're distracted.
They're into a whole different world.
Four, primo tickets for Sunday's San Diego Miami game in section 141.
Not the best, not like those of us who sit in 142, but not bad.
Like on about the 45 yard line.
What do you think?
How much could we raise for these tickets?
And also, attached to them are just in case like Buffalo should win and we win
to get for the AFC Championship game in Miami the following Sunday.
Huh?
Wouldn't that be something if I auctioned those babies off?
Here's Orlando.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Well, thank God.
Hello.
Well, thank God for the night time, man.
Oh, my God.
It's just awful up here.
It is.
I got to tell you that...
How's Jim Phillips doing?
Oh, he sucks.
Is he still picking the seeds out of his thing?
No, no, no, this guy sucks.
Does he?
He's got to go.
Huh?
I mean, he's...
Why can't Cox who you keep bad mouth and buy that station?
What station is it?
Oh, whatever.
I don't know what I'm worth.
Well, I think that's a buddy but Paxon station.
He's not going to be selling it and he's buying all the stations up now.
Oh, good God.
Come on.
I mean, he is.
You've got to get broke.
He's buying the Hess stations up next week.
The Tampa signal to Orlando...
Very weak.
Very marginal.
Get...
You're right.
It is Martin.
And, you know, I can't get it in the house.
I get it in the car pretty decent.
You need likely to have a substation.
A substation.
Well, some kind of station.
Any kind of nose pick...
We need another carrier is what we need.
We need to put one of those microwave things on the top of Disney World.
Well, you got some big pull.
Really?
I mean, I think so.
Do you?
I mean, please.
Well, what are we going to do up here without you?
Yeah.
Well, I moved out of Miami years ago.
I mean, I died.
And when I finally...
Sounds like it.
Oh, I mean, it was just awful up here.
I can tell.
These guys suck.
Yeah.
Anyway, I'm at a material.
Well, have a great day.
You're putting me on hold.
Sure.
He said it in such a way that you couldn't deny him.
Okay, get your hands out of your pants, George.
Stop playing the Mr. Hot Shot in there.
Here's Miramar on the Star Line.
Hello?
Five five six.
I only had one test to go.
Oh!
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale.
Hello?
Neil.
Yeah.
How we're in an office building where we had a similar problem.
So instead of getting mad, we got to eat it.
Here's what you do.
Okay.
You get a glass cutter and you cut holes in every window
at the size of a quarter.
That way you get fresh air in.
But hang on, there's more.
Well, let me say this to you.
Hang on.
Wait a minute.
Okay, go ahead.
See, it drives up their air conditioning bill.
So much that they have to take the whole unit apart.
Clean it all out.
Then they've got to replace all the windows.
It drives the putts of heads who run the place crazy.
They have to get fresh air.
They have to clean it all up.
They have to clean it all up.
I thought you said all out.
No.
Yeah, you did.
I did?
You said all out.
I guess it's from hanging around those puppy French Canadians on the beach all day.
It's rubbing off.
It is.
Yeah.
So try to do that.
Okay, I'm going to get my drill right now.
It works.
Thanks.
Open line at Broward.
Let's go drill at baby.
And the window too.
1-800-944-9463.
We don't want to have any openings in our windows because Channel 7 is like right next to them.
We don't want the crap from over there, wafting into our windows.
I can already smell it.
In fact, that wood burning was probably a rick sanchez squatting too low over the desk.
Here's the lady in South Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
I just wanted one thing I wanted to say was that you mentioned about people not calling.
And sometimes, you know, I know that when I'm at work and I wish I could call and I can't.
And I think a lot of people sometimes I'm not trying to make excuses.
Yes, you are.
Yes, I am.
Okay. Well, that was the excuse.
Nothing worse than excuses.
Yeah.
It's just a lot of times I'm at work and you say, you know, oh, somebody from Dave County calling.
I'm like, I wish I could, but I can't.
So anyway, what I wanted you to do.
Did you do that?
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
But I'm just saying you said you can't and you did.
Well, I'm off today.
Oh, I see.
Yes, my day off.
That's what.
I had a big fight yesterday with a guy at work.
Who said he used this term that he said he heard it from Rush Limbaugh.
Wait a minute.
Has Amy been victimized by the media?
72% on Richard Bay said, yes, 28% no.
And 7,000 people came knocking him door down and said already enough with that Joey Wanu Fuco.
Now, what is it?
What he said was he was comparing now with Nazis and he used the term Semin Nazi.
Yeah.
Well, that's one of his favorite repetitive ditto, ditto, ditto feminazis etc.
I've never heard about 20 words in his big fat vocabulary.
Oh, I blew up at this guy when he started saying that, you know, feminists.
People who listen to the Lardass Limbaugh are morons.
Okay, they're absolute, mindless, automaton moron, hateful, right wing slime balls.
Well, how dare this guy or Rush Limbaugh or anybody compare somebody that believes in feminism to be a Nazi?
Yeah.
Well, Nazi is on his mind a lot because he's so big he sees himself all over the place.
Maybe he is one.
So it keeps Nazi in his mind.
So, do I like to call him up and tell him off?
Does he have a calling thing, too, doesn't he?
He's on tape.
Oh, so you can't call him.
You know, you think that you're hearing him lie, but it's a scam he's on tape.
He's below board.
So, I have a great day.
I couldn't call him that.
Just ignore him.
Okay, that's the best way to do it.
Just take him, just remove him from your life.
Okay.
Have a great day.
You too, Neil.
Be well.
Bye-bye.
We have an open line in date.
So, did Cheryl ever give me my blood test results yet?
Or are we like waiting for the dog to fly in the duck to come back to the window with my results?
No, there it is right now.
More exciting facts news.
Thank you so much from our friends.
Oh, by the way, we are going to be doing a thing at Pompo-no Park starting in mid-Fibre.
And also, I should mention because there are probably some people who were there last night.
And I lost my ass last night, but still I'm ahead for the week.
But there was one race where the horse did one with Roncluso-Mano was 9-1.
The horse that came in second was 18-1.
And the perfected, which should have paid between $3 and $400 paid $62.
Even the Quinella paid $92.
And all of us were looking at that and screaming and getting our matches out and getting ready to burn the place down.
And so I said to Harold Durace, this really smells bad.
And he got on the phone and he checked it out and then investigated.
It turns out it was one of the out-of-state OTB things in Dover Downs and Delaware.
And the guy was playing the off.
You know what that is?
Not that off.
No. In other words, they watched, used to have to have somebody else do it with you.
They'd watch through the window and they'd see which horses were leaving the gate just before the bell rang.
Well, now that they have the TV monitors, they can do it.
And he loved the one horse and was waiting to see who was going to leave big.
And the four left and led the entire race.
And just before they, and he bet a $90 perfect to box and took practically the whole damn pool down of about five grand.
So the perfect to which otherwise would have paid hundreds of dollars won a Pan Only $62.40.
But I just say that so you know that it was not one of these inside jobs where it looks really bad and we want to burn the track down.
That'll be next week.
Are you still holding?
Yeah.
All right, hold on. Don't come back to me, please.
Keep it skin. Hello.
Keep it skin.
How do you hear something?
Keep it skin.
Let's go to the lady in Miami. Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, is this Neil?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, Neil.
How you doing?
I'm 27 years old.
Right.
And I'm forced to listen to your show every day by a coworker.
Poor baby.
And it's starting to kind of rub off on me.
Really?
But you know what I wanted to know, Neil?
Your coworker is starting to rub off on you?
No, the show is.
Oh, the show is?
Yeah.
I wanted to know why you still rode to people all the time.
I beg your pardon? I treat people the way they treat me.
If they're nice to me, I treat them nice back.
And if they treat me like crap, I treat them like double crap.
How's that?
You just hung up on two people, Neil.
I'm wondering if you can give a people a chance to...
Well, how about making it three?
Are we going to answer the phone or are we going to like socialize now, George?
We have an open line in date, 751 and one on the out of town line,
1-800-944-9463.
I'm not trying to be requiredly and play Butch Boss,
but we're desperate for calls these days.
I mean, we are very...
And when those lines are ringing, W-I-O-D,
we're going to pick them up even if there are more on the other end.
Hello?
Yeah.
Are you a moron?
Me?
Yeah, well, that's an honest answer.
We have an open line in four Myers, 1-800-944-9463.
Oh, man, talk about a sick building.
There is a fungus, deeply among us, buried way in the bowels of this building.
I guarantee if they just ripped this entire building apart, they'd find something crawling around in there
that would make that thing in its alive, pale by endowin' significant.
Seriously, that would make your head spin around like Linda Blair on a bad day in heat.
Anyway, our committal house total is inching up toward $100,000 mark,
but I guess we want to make it very dramatic.
We don't want to go over that mark too fast and believe me, we're not doing it.
That hotline number, don't forget, get your finger in the phone and get that visa master card out right now.
1-800-852-0006
This is South Florida's news, traffic and weather station.
And the same to you, sir, happy 93, man.
It's already off to a start.
Yeah, and you're doing the right thing, you know, eating healthy and whatnot.
Yeah, so I am going to have to talk to them all.
That's not going to kill me.
I've been doing pretty good last three weeks if I say so myself.
I'm following your direction.
I said, low cholesterol, low fat, low sodium, all works.
Right, especially low fat.
Animal fat, get it out of your life, my friend.
I'm serious.
That's right.
Put send the animals to the zoo, not into your stomach.
That's right.
Uncle Neil, the other day I was driving.
I just got in from Baltimore in Washington.
And I'm driving on the road and I see this awful part, this awful driver on the left hand side of the road
doing 45 miles an hour on 995.
Yeah.
Right off the beltway in Baltimore.
And guess what the tag said.
Quebec.
You got that right.
Or Broward.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Well, the frogs were up there right to what I'd run out of them, you know.
Which way were they going?
No, I think I got that.
Oh, thank God.
All right.
But I mean, with the worst lobster tans in the world.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
They are something, man.
I mean, I can't believe it.
And not only are they grotesque and cheap and old and fat, but they are.
They smell so bad.
Uncle Neil.
We don't want to create any kind of a stereotype here, but they stink.
Oh, they do.
Well, listen, I can't find it.
They stink like Winnie the Pooh as a matter of fact.
But anyway, what do you think of this?
Filly and Miami and the Super Bowl.
Okay.
What do you think?
Sounds good to me.
And last but not least.
And don't you remember we played them last year?
Yeah.
And beat them.
Uh-huh.
You like bagel chips?
Was it two years ago?
Two years ago.
Like I said, two years ago.
Well, whatever.
No, I do not like bagel chips.
You know, if you want to eat healthy, that ain't what you want to eat.
Well, I got them low cholesterol.
Forget it.
Forget bagel chips.
I'm telling you right now, toss them in the turlit right now and flush that baby.
And the turlit.
Right.
Have a great day.
Back also, baby.
Sure.
Julio, you're a big rotten douchebag.
And a Julio.
See ya.
Open line in Tampa.
And in Fort Myers, man, we are kick and ass, man.
And Cape Coral and LaBelle and Fort Myers, we are doing it.
1-800-944-9463.
Tony Allen and the board off are listening to it every day.
Over there religiously.
Nobody else.
And maybe John McHugh.
Lighthouse point.
Lighthouse PURNT.
Nobody there?
Okay, you're lost.
Here's Fort Myers.
Wait a minute.
Right here.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
You're the one.
I'm the one.
36 minutes.
25 seconds.
Holding?
You been on that long?
Yep.
Don't cut me off, please.
No.
Why would I do that?
Although it would be kind of amusing, but I wouldn't do that.
Well, I'm at work and I've got a phone that's got a clock on it.
By the way, we're doing just three breaks this hour, right George?
Don't say whatever.
You got all your important affiliates out there who are getting lost as we go.
You go ahead.
You know, your affiliate station here at WWCN, it's good station, but you know, it doesn't even have a phone book listing.
Of course not.
They can't afford that because they don't have a phone.
I'm believable.
Yeah.
What do you want from a station that plays CNN headline news all day?
And they got like some doctor and some botanist on there and they have to play rap as.
It's awful.
What's funny when you listen to the CNN news and they're, you know, it's just the audio feed to the TV program.
Right.
And they're talking about all these things that you're supposed to be seeing.
All these visual things, yeah.
And of course, if you look at the little speaker just right, sometimes you can pick it up.
Well, the users can't see the TV anyway.
That's right.
Hey, we're going to put those bastards on the map on WWC and that's what Steve, what's his name Gilbert and all those other people are panicking about and for Myers.
Oh, you know, it's funny if you listen to their programs, their talk shows,
McCullough and some of the other folks on Wink.
Yeah.
They're on the air and nobody calls in.
Really?
They just talk, they bring up these topics.
They bring up topics.
No, I feel better because, I'll be honest, we're not exactly getting inundated with the four Myers-Key crawl calls.
You know, if you're here and a few there, but not...
You get more calls than they do.
And probably if you would put them on the air there for about a month.
They bring up topics of discussion, which is, you know, this old fart kind of radio.
Well, most of the people who are listening to Wink are so old that they can't get to the phone anyway.
It's true.
You know, you talk about you got fungus problems in there.
They just squeeze the button on their microler.
Yeah.
Whenever time you say fungus among us that reminds me of a great,
Fologius monk tune.
I don't know if you're into jazz at all.
Not at all.
Fologius monk is a great, great jazz musician, but he did a tune that was great.
Listen, I'm not a moron, okay?
I do know you're Fologius monk.
I know you're not.
You were talking yesterday about Rome.
Yeah.
Rome is great.
What does that have to do with Fologius monk?
Well, there are a lot of monks in Rome, though.
I saw a Fologius monk.
There are a lot of geckys out there by the Vatican.
Rome is great.
In fact, I wish one day, I know this is a little bit offbeat.
But someday we've got to take a whole day and talk to people who have been in different places in the world.
Yeah.
And not everybody can afford to go to Europe or go to exotic, erotic places.
There's a lot of young people who travel like real cheap.
But even in the country, in this country, people who travel, I've found in my life,
are much more interesting and much more like with it and much more real people.
Then parochial little yahuos who've never been more than ten blocks from their home.
Wow.
That's what living is all about.
It's like getting out of the house once in a while and seeing the world and finding what it's all about.
Well, what's amazing, too, is that we moved down here about ten years ago.
And we found that most of the people we talk to, especially young people, have never been out of the state of Florida.
Have never been anywhere.
Never seen snow.
In fact, some of the people in Dade County, like if they ever get crossed the Broward line,
then that's like a big adventure.
They go home and write it in the diary.
But just talking about Rome, though, one thing that's really fine is to send it back.
Rome is the only place that I recall that had as many police departments in one small area as like Fort Myers does.
Really?
Fort Myers has like the Sheriff's Department, the city police, and the highway patrol.
Polizia.
Remember they had the polizia?
And then do you remember the carabinieri?
No.
It's another...
I remember that in the Godfather.
The carabinieri are police.
They used to be Mussolini's bodyguards and then when he got, you know, the rope,
they had all these guys on the public door, didn't know what to do with them,
so they just became a police force.
Yeah.
And they still exist there.
But they don't have somebody.
They just sort of have to each other to see who's jurisdiction it is.
Well, the first year I was in Rome was 89, I think.
And that year they had the polizia, like on almost every major intersection,
standing there with like shotguns on their shoulders.
And seriously, with rifles, I don't know why.
They just were standing around.
They didn't bother anybody.
But if you looked at them cross-eyed, I think they would have shot without asking any questions.
And they don't have that anymore.
You don't see very many of them.
But in the airport, boy, they have got like security in the Leonardo da Vinci airport.
You got big problems.
Oh, man, I am telling you, you don't even dare bat an eyelash,
or they'll blow your shot away without even thinking twice.
Yeah.
But I'll tell you the truth.
Because I went because the Delta, unfortunately, the Delta counter is like on the other side
of all these different counters that you go to, no problem.
But then if you want to go and like change your ticket or buy a new ticket,
you have to cross this little barrier there.
And the polizia are standing there with their uzi's pointed right at your push, man.
And don't look at them cross-eyed.
I'm telling you.
They're pretty nasty looking group.
Yeah.
They mean business.
They are intimidating.
Yeah.
But crack some kind of a joke about Don Corleone.
And he kicked me right in the morning a couple of times and said, don't do that again, man.
This is Italy.
Asshole.
You know, you were talking about sauce, though, the other day like sauce on spaghetti sauce, whatever.
The sauce that you get in Italy, the Italian sauce that we have here that most people know.
Totally different.
It's really Sicilian.
Oh, really?
That's Sicilian recipe.
Oh, not like it wrong.
It's really cooking.
That's spaghetti pomegranate.
Right.
And wrong would just a very light tomato sauce and just enough to cover the pasta, not like not swimming in it.
And God, it is so good.
I just kept that's like better than anything.
It's a different deal altogether.
And of course the Romans don't consider anybody who lives south of Rome to be Italian.
And the ice cream that...
Oh, the latte or...
Gelato is just a vegetable.
Great stuff.
Rome is great.
Would you give me one little favor now?
Maybe.
Just maybe a little thing.
I've got my father listening to you now.
And I've been telling him about you.
He just started listening.
But I've been telling him about that.
That cart that you have with Larry King about the paint your balls spot.
Oh, sure.
Anytime you want to be a favorite.
That would be great.
I might play it like that is the best.
20 or 30 times as a matter of fact.
Have a great day.
Thanks.
See you.
Bye.
I'll read the rest of your drama.
116 on the IOD Network.

Or plan a casual night at track side level in the grandstand or the clubhouse.
General admission is only a dollar and don't forget.
I just noticed something that in one of your interviews with John G.
Andy I believe it looks like an older interview you had less hair than you have today.
How do you explain that?
I don't wear a wig sir.
Paint your bald spot.
Ward bald spot.
You paint your bald spot?
I don't know what you're talking about sir my hair grows.
You paint your bald spot.
I don't have a bald spot.
How come you had less hair on the tape?
Maybe my hair grew maybe I had a bad haircut that day.
You apply the way something.
What do you care?
Paint your bald spot?
I don't.
Do you paint your bald spot?
Paint your bald spot?
Sick.
Bat is great radio.
Twenty after one at WIOD and we have an open line in day.
It's 7519460.
By the way that bald spot is number two with four bullets already.
It's moving.
It's doing it.
Where's our milk shake by the way speaking and doing it?
Huh?
What are they doing?
They're busy shaking it now as we speak.
I believe that.
Here's a mobile in Davy.
How you doing?
Okay.
Good.
I just tuned in.
I heard you talk about Rome.
The reason that when you go through security go into Delta.
If you notice right next door it is Delta.
They are our airline.
I never noticed that.
Yeah.
And what happened was the last time I was there I opened my big mouth up because you went through security and you go through security again.
Where you will fit the rest of the airport.
You don't do that until you go to the gate.
Right.
And one of the John Don's camels that we started talking and I said it's all like this.
I'm curious as to why we're going through this security check before we even check in.
And he says, well, we have to.
And then when I was getting on the plane I noticed that right next door is Delta.
And that's the reason why it is the double security check.
Boy, they're standing there with their uzzies and I mean pointed like right at your face and like that.
Well, that's a big door.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah, you don't mess around in that airport.
Speaking of dogs by the way, how come you don't see very many dogs in Europe?
Hello.
Now what are you laughing about?
That's not that's a serious question how you don't see a lot of dogs.
And the dogs that you do see are really mostly ugly, ready, nasty looking little strange breed dogs.
I guess they just feel it's towards what they want.
They just don't do it.
And with the food, I mean you're right about the sources.
I mean, a tiny food is like really the greatest.
And when you come over here in the flat, they serve you okay.
Yeah.
Well, a lot of so-called Italian restaurants here they have that real heavy dark, goopy, rich, thick sauce and a lot of thick cheese.
And they put that on everything and they think that makes it a Italian.
And it's nothing at all like what you get over there.
And let me say it again, there is no such thing in Italy as spaghetti with meatballs or spaghetti with sausage or all this other crap that we load on there.
They don't do that.
Well, there's no real pomerjons.
Right. That is right.
If you want the sources piece, you can't get that.
If you want what?
The sources piece.
No.
I mean, you have to know somebody to put some sources on a piece.
Right.
They do have pizza, but not like what we have.
Right. Well, a basic pizza has like three pieces of ancho.
Oh, no, not for this kid.
No, no, you have that pizza, magyriza.
But if you get the regular pizza, a parlor tonne of this little, just, you know, a few pieces of ancho.
Ooh, not for me.
But that is a case for this kid.
Well, I'm going to say.
But the sources, as I said, with that pasta, it's just unbelievable.
I mean, it's, all it does is just change the pasta a little bit, reddish orange.
Yeah.
And it's the more flavor than that and the group that we eat over here.
Right.
Well, I'm on my way.
I'm leaving right after the show.
Well, I'm going in a couple of weeks.
Okay.
I'll think about it.
Have a great time.
You're true.
Bye-bye.
Open line at Broward, 5249463.
Everybody get on a plane and go somewhere.
All right.
Even if you have to like, stow away.
Just go somewhere.
Here's a mobile and sunrise.
Yeah, no.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Happy New Year, first of all.
And the same to you, sir.
Okay.
You're a Corvette, man.
I have a store old Corvette and all that.
Right.
I believe I see you last night on the highway.
So you were on five, you got a name, you three, like a perforated Corvette.
Right.
Are you the guy that waived?
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
I see you yesterday, because I see me.
I see the pictures of you a couple of years ago in Royal campus.
And that says there's a one on seven to have you.
And like, oh.
That's right.
I was on a way to the track last night and there was this very sinister black vehicle coming
up alongside in the window world down.
And this guy, like, had his oozie pointed out the window and he looked at me, said,
Neil Rogers.
And I wasn't sure whether to say yes or no.
And then there was the thumbs up.
So I knew that either was the thumbs up or this was the end.
One of the other.
Awesome.
Yeah, because I heard you say you washed the car yesterday.
So I've seen a nice clean 93 from the down.
I've seen you.
That looks like Neil.
That's a one.
It's up.
Right.
Great, man.
Nice looking car.
You got a couple of them, huh?
Right.
You got a 92 or a 93?
92, the purple one, the black rose metallic.
Oh, man.
That's sweet right there.
And I got the 93 with the scratch matching scratches on each door.
Yeah.
They scratch you up already?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, man.
That color there is a pain in the butt to the man.
Is it really?
Yeah.
Well, I'm just going to leave my scratches on there.
Then you'll know it's me next time.
But you have a great day, pal.
All right, Nathan.
See you.
Yeah.
We have an open line in Dave at 751.
What are you laughing about, Joey?
You know, it's just amazing.
This punk comes in here.
Are you going to give me that stuff for my allergies, by the way?
Just once.
All the food that we fed you over these years, all the nice things we've done for you,
the hockey tickets that I gave that the audience wanted desperately,
bring me in some crap for my allergies.
And I am never ever crossing that street again, by the way.
I just want to go on record right now.
I am never going across the street.
You know, after a Cheryl came in and gave me the relay of the message about my blood test
we're fine and she canceled the thing.
And here's a message that came in a nilder came rushing in with the message from over there.
I butch I'm not returning.
I'm sorry.
Nice people, but not for this kid.
I'm just not going back.
No more EKGs.
No more blood tests.
No more like invasive procedures that cost $80 million.
No more.
Oi, oi, you're dying.
If I die, I die.
Okay, but at least I'd like to die with ten bucks in the banks of the drugs.
Gonna have some food.
Here's a lady in Lauderdale Lake.
Hello.
Oh, Neil.
Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Time call.
Long time no see.
Long time no see.
I'm very pretty.
Well, I'm very pretty.
Good.
I just listen to you every day.
Great.
I'll tell you what, you want good shakes?
Yeah.
Okay, flamingo dina.
I beg your pardon.
Flamingo giant?
Flamingo dina.
Oh, dina.
Yeah.
Where the hell is that?
7750 Peters Road Plantation.
You live in plantation, I can't believe it.
77 is that what?
Like Pine Island is...
Is University 88th or Pine Island?
Look around there somewhere.
You lived there.
I don't know.
Well, it's east of there.
Oh, I see.
It's east of there on Peters Road, right?
Yeah.
It's not too far from the garlic festival.
Right.
Right.
Yeah, because we came up to see you there.
Oh, god.
Let's not go back into that.
No, no, no, no.
So it's the flamingo diner?
Flamingo dina.
They have the old soda fountains.
They are excellent.
They are excellent.
I love that.
They have the best cobs salad.
You want to be vegetarian.
You go eat there.
They're wonderful.
Yeah.
It's great service.
That's the cobs salad.
That was named after the great harness driver, Eddie Cobb.
I guess so.
Yeah, it's Genghis Khan with Eddie Cobb.
Well, that's great.
Well, you know, give it a shot.
They have like wonderful chocolate mullets too.
They have shot?
We got enough shot around here.
I don't need to go there for it.
I got enough shot here.
I've been waiting on the phone for now, 48 minutes.
Well, it was worth it for us.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure it was.
It was.
It was.
Who else would have called me about the flamingo diner?
Nobody else.
Nobody else.
I heard.
I saw this guy.
And he said, you know whether it's a good ol' fountains soda fountain.
Well, I'm going to check it out.
Well, you sure, deal with that.
And you have a great day.
You too.
Now, love the tape.
Everybody out there.
Go donate something to Camilla's house.
We did.
It's great.
It's wonderful.
Good cause.
Thanks a lot.
Love it.
Bye-bye.
Don't forget Tailgate Party at your Robbie Stadium.
Rick Riley will be there.
Every time something comes up, he always immediately is looking for some excuse as to, oh, he's got
the kids this weekend.
Well, that's great.
He loves his kids.
They're good kids.
All of a sudden, there's stuff he will be there this Sunday, at least for part of that tailgate
party.
And I will be there for least part.
Because, through the generosity of the dolphins, through the kindness of their parts.
And because I sit here in scream and a holler and yell and puke and plead for you to go out there
and support our team and buy the tickets and fill up that stadium, they're letting us pedal
our Camilla's house where it's at the Tailgate Party before the game again this Sunday.
Wonderful.
At Gatede.
Right, Gatede?
Southside of your Robbie Stadium.
You can't miss it.
You'd have to be like, I can't imagine why anybody in the world would miss it.
Oh, and I already put that away.
Well, maybe you might drive by, but there's only one reason.
For quite a thing, I only had one.
Oh, yeah.
So anyway, one to four before the game will be there, peddling our words.
The tape, the t-shirts, all the good stuff.
North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
This is Betty.
Yes, Betty.
I'm great.
I was listening to you this morning and I heard you talking about the Malaluka trees.
Right.
Those things drive me crazy.
You too.
Well, thank God you called, Betty, because you know, I got that lady.
She's the tree lady who did call and I didn't talk to her today because I'm getting tired.
I mean, she probably has a point and she's probably right, but she has very minimal credibility.
Do you have a lot of those in your house?
I bought a house in February and it is surrounded.
I must have about eight of my big Malaluka trees and they're just in blue again here recently.
And I got sinus headaches.
I wait for that morning.
That's what it is.
Is that it?
Yes.
Oh, no.
Give me that spray, Joey.
Like next two minutes or less.
I don't have allergies, but they, those Malaluka, they really bother me.
What do you get from them?
I just get like headaches and eyes and nose runs and everything.
And what do you do for it?
If I get away from it, see I, you know, if I'm not near.
Well, are they in your house?
Are they like in the neighborhood?
Where are they?
I used to have a friend who had him in his front yard.
Yeah.
And when I went back, it would bother me.
Because one of my neighbors, I think it was my, um, um, sell, my long guy was telling me a couple of weeks ago that his cousin or somebody in their family
can't even come to their house.
That's right.
Because they have Malaluka all over the neighborhood and they start wheezing and breaking out and you can't have to like immediately get in the car and rush out of the neighborhood.
Well, you can't take those trees down from your house. That's your whole house.
No, because I got like about eight or nine of them.
I mean, I would love for them to all disappear, but I don't think that's going to happen.
I guess not.
Maybe I'll just sell my house.
Well, no, I don't know.
You know, talking about knowing a good way to find a good doctor.
Yeah.
A Dave County medical association, you know, the DCMA.
Right.
That's a good way to do it.
Okay.
Thank you for your date.
Well, thanks a lot, Betty.
And you have a great day.
One more thing about the doffins.
Yeah.
Go doffins.
Right.
Okay.
See you, Betty.
Nice doffin, Dave.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye now.
Open line of day, 7-5-1.
Where's those shakes, dammit?
Oh, yeah.
What is on his way?
He's, uh, he's whisking his ponytail through the shakes first.
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
Uh, cold for a couple things.
I'm first time caller.
Definitely long time list.
Yes, sir.
You're great.
Have you been listening to the updates that you're thinking the station does?
On what?
Uh, just everything, I mean, as far as, uh, how they advertise for their, uh, you know, the news.
They say the same story, 20 times, but they don't complete it like the one about the Florida Highway Patrol.
Right.
I mean, it's ridiculous.
It is ridiculous.
Because if you're real update then instead of the big one, you're advertising for.
Happy New Year, right?
It'd be, you know, a big one.
Well, that's why we call it your ridiculous station for the 90s.
Okay.
We may not be good, but at least we're consistent.
Yeah.
Well, I'll be seeing you guys at the game also.
So great.
We got real nice tickets.
We're happy.
And uh, go fish.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Woody Graber is here.
The freeze has sent over three authentic real honest to God.
Oh, with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles.
Look at that.
Oh, man.
There goes my thing.
Well, okay.
So I'm having one of these.
If somebody's going to get this upset about that after three weeks of near perfection, then screw them as all I have to say.
Okay.
With a long spoon.
Now, let me just take a little swig.
Oh.
Oh, God is that good.
Man.
I haven't had anything like that in my mouth in the hours.
132 on the IOD network.
Introducing the fast, efficient way to get it off your chest.
It's the all new Tutantel drive through confessional.
Hello, my child.
And where come Tutantel?
If you committed his vans or less, try our sinners expressly or come inside and meditate at the shrine to our lady of the loob job.
It's all of the Tutantel drive through confessional.
Stop by this week and get a free Tutantel or go to hellbubber sticker.
Just look for the clown in the cleric's collar.
Tutantel.
Lowest Sunday.
135 at IOD.
These are just God-like.
These chocolate moths from the freeze.
Mmm.
Mmm.
And we're all agreeing.
It's been a long time since we've had one of these.
Here's a lit in the malt too.
Now, why is he on the phone?
Will you answer me the question?
Why is he on there?
And what does he want?
And why won't he leave me alone, John McEw?
I want to ask you.
What do you want?
What do you want, John McEw?
Did you get the tape?
Did you get the tape?
Did you get the bloody tape?
I haven't listened to it yet.
Oh, boy.
You're such a great guy to do things for.
I got needle tape too ready for you.
Well, hang on to it.
I got test tube baby store, loose tailor's eyes,
the coastwood burps,
the second week of deer camp, drive in Debbie,
worms, and footprints on the dashboard.
All these plastic are yours.
Right.
So what do you want, John?
Well, I just wanted to know if you got the tape.
I got the tape, John.
Well, why don't you do something with it?
Well, bend over.
Goodbye to you.
See you, John.
Oh, man.
I'm choking over here.
You know why?
Dairy.
Huh?
Three and a half weeks?
No, dairy.
Oh, man.
No, it's gone.
I'm the do with that.
Gagging and choking and maybe was just talking to John McEw.
Huh?
Meanwhile, we got a lady mobile on here.
We're making her wait.
Hello?
Yes, I'm Neil.
On your dime, no less.
You have to wait for that crap.
But you believe I waited just like Dr. Betty?
Well, I wanted to commend you on how nice to work with that lady.
That said that you brought her up to so much joy.
And you passed away.
Right.
I just have never seen that side of you.
And I just want to say how wonderful it was to be a nice to her and not be a rude man.
And I'm out on people.
I'm happy to be a very nice guy.
Well, that's good to know.
I just wanted to tell you that.
Well, thanks a pile.
Have a day.
Have a day.
Have a day.
Bye.
Bye.
Two open lines in Dade County.
It's just a radio show, folks.
Okay.
Will you stop getting so damn hyper and emotional?
It's just a goddamn radio show.
Just take a deep breath and we'll let you know what to let it out.
You can let it out now, Joy.
And your breath.
Miami Lakes.
Yeah, I need to talk to the doggy doctor.
And the doggy doctor's in.
What can we do for you, sir?
Well, a lady called two weeks ago and she says to me to squeeze my doggy things.
And I did and doggy's been following me around a household age.
Okay.
Doggy won't leave me a town doggy.
Yeah, doggy.
Have a great life together.
We have an open line in Dade.
Don't forget, come and get it.
Now, see, I don't like mentioning the products that I use on the year.
Because then I go to my supermarket and they're almost all gone all the time.
It used to be no problem.
There were always like piles of come and get it in the piles in the aisles.
Which means maybe people are bringing their dogs in the store while they're shopping.
Maybe that explains the piles in the aisles.
But there was lots and lots of come and get it.
And now it's like maybe there's one or two bags.
And next time I go to probably be out.
Which my dogs will not tolerate that kind of garbage, okay?
That kind of crap.
Boy, man, there is fungus among us.
That's good stuff, all right.
But I don't think I'm going to be eating another one soon.
Man, oh man, oh man.
Here's a mobile in Kendall.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Don't you miss ice cream?
No.
You don't.
Not really.
I think that's the only thing I would miss on that diet.
No.
I mean, I like ice cream.
But I'm not that crazy about it.
The seal test cookies and cream, that stuff.
Seal test?
Oh, what a connoisseur we got here.
A seal test eater.
Yeah, a real connoisseur.
Are that 80s?
You know something?
Yees was all right.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Have you been in Rome and had that real gelato?
You want to go back and get the real thing?
Oh, yeah.
I've been over in Italy, man.
That's the real stuff.
Get the real thing and the gelato, too.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, Neil.
I just want to say hello and I second the motion from that lady that just called before.
See ya.
You're a nice guy.
I am.
Bye.
I agree.
We have two open lives in both of them.
Well, I'm not going to argue with the guy.
Okay, I'm a bastard.
Okay.
I'm an asshole.
God.
Just cut the garbage, all right?
Just a radio show.
Maybe I'm a nice guy.
Maybe I'm not.
And quite frankly, who gives a crap when it comes right down to it?
I'm in my mom's for lunch the other day and she's very quiet this week on Tuesday.
That was the day I was hyperventilating about the Monday meeting and about this entire company.
And she was very, very quiet, very mum.
I had a mum, mum during lunch on Tuesday.
And after lunch, I'm sitting there watching Guiding Light and trying to ignore her as best I can.
And I made some comment about this place and she said,
You think it's such a good idea to criticize them so much?
Yes, I do, ma'am.
Mom, mom.
And mind your own business and cut the crap and stop being such an old kvetsha already, will you?
God, if it was up to her, I'd come in here.
Oh, yes, sir, yes, sir.
I'd be kissing everybody's butt all over the place if it was up to her.
Mr. Insacure.
Did I say we have an open line in date?
I think I did.
At 7.51 and I think today we've started to make a little bit of a comeback here today.
This is a little bit more like it.
Here's Riverview.
Hello.
Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing today?
Pretty good.
Good.
I'm always talking about, you're always talking about they play your tapes over and over.
It asks you in.
I went to Dallas back to Dallas, my hometown for the holidays.
I was listening to Howard Stern.
And he had to dice, man, and then I thought, well, this is great.
Well, they came back from the break and they said, you're listening to the best of Howard Stern.
Oh!
Incredible.
You're not the only one.
Life is just one big tape, man.
I've got you.
Well, we really enjoy your show.
Where are you going to be when you come to Tampa?
I think I threw that thing away.
Wait a minute.
Let me see if I saved it or if I tossed it out.
Is it the Westview Mall?
Is that the name of it?
Westview Mall.
On Kennedy?
Okay.
That's it.
Saturday from the Deuce Bag.
Sure.
Mike Elliott, you're a cable installing Deuce Bag.
Okay.
Have a good day now.
And you too.
Bye-bye.
See ya.
Yeah, that is if we do the Tampa thing.
That's still in limbo, in Rush Limbo.
It all depends on whether a Tom Velvita can butcher.
See, and then I made a comment to Bob Green about that depressing, very annoying conversation
I had with Tom Velvita right at it.
And it finished like 10 seconds before I came on the air this morning, which really, I
don't need that.
It just frosted my big fat pimple-ass.
I don't need that.
It's just not a good, the confidence builder to get started for the day.
And the thing about their sales department, about how we still seven months later, we've
had absolutely no communication with them.
And we have no coordination, and there's nothing going on.
And Bob Green says to me, boy, wait till you meet their sales manager.
As if to say, what a bunch of morons over there at SUN.
So that's really inspiring, isn't it?
Huh?
Although expected.
A mobile and market on a deadline.
How do you like this?
Yeah, well, I figured you've got a car phone, you might as well spin it around a little
bit.
Yeah, that's the thing sound alright?
Not bad.
Good.
Listen, not good.
Not good, not bad, that's car phones.
One dollar stolen out here.
You like Dallas, right?
Yeah.
How many points?
I don't bet on football.
No, no, I'm not going to ask you to bet on football, but I mean, how many points would you
bet on?
Where they're playing in Dallas, of course.
Yes.
I'd give about three, I'd say.
You'd give about three?
What's the line?
I think the line is about five.
I wouldn't give five.
Well, that's why, see?
Yeah, well, listen, I want to tell you something.
You know, I listen to your show all the time and you have any egos seem to be getting their
act together now.
I think the egos are going to go all the way this way.
Good, I hope so.
I hope they go right up to the Super Bowl so we can beat them.
That'll be a hell of a game, wouldn't it?
But anyhow, what I wanted to say is I am so convinced that the egos are going to win this
weekend that you're mortgaging the house.
No, I'm not mortgaging the house, but I'll tell you what I want to do.
If the winning egos win, I am going to send you a donation of 50 dollars for that house
that you give to all the time.
What's the name of that?
Camilla's house.
Camilla's house.
Or just to my house.
Yes, and I would like to ask you that if the egos don't win, and I mean, if the egos do
win, if Dallas wins, I'll send 50 bucks.
If the egos win, which would be willing to send 10 dollars to Camilla's house?
What do you mean by that?
Give a donation.
Who gives it on?
You already gave 2000.
How about if the dolphins, when you give 2000, you match mine?
Well, I can't afford 2000.
Oh, but how about 50?
I'm giving you five to one arch.
Oh, I see.
Well, whatever you give, if you give 50, I'll give 50.
How's that?
Okay.
I'll say what I want to do though, because remember me.
My name is Ron.
Okay.
And I will send that into your producer if I lose.
Okay.
It's a deal.
Good luck.
I'm losing.
145 on...
So that was Bob Green with the shades now.
Is that the new look to beard and the shades?
And quite frankly, if I were he, I'd be trying to be anonymous lately too, especially after
that meeting.
But don't forget now, dress for success, because this is your super service station.
Three radio stations in the same building.
The ear is contaminated.
There's a fungus all over the building, all over the walls.
There is mold.
There is mildew.
There are spores.
There is mung.
We don't have a continuity director.
We have nobody writing copy.
The salespeople are like spinning.
In fact, the PT Simone.
Does he still work here?
He left me an out that he was going to see me this morning about some account.
Never saw his ass in here today.
And quite frankly, his ass is probably one of the few in the building that anybody would want to see.
Not this guy.
Oh, and Bob, about the guy that called Rick Riley the other day is I was on my way to
Mommy's house or whatever the hell it was.
I was not packing candy at Mommy's house or anywhere else.
You hear that?
That Rick boy.
He let some of the best calls in America on that show.
146.
Maybe he was just buzzing around with the truth.
146 on the IOD network.
Media Religious Body.
Hey, yours was plugged for an ear.
A year.
Right, the ear for a year.
So you want your tickets and I did not give them away although it would have been a very humorous thing to do.
And I know it's yeah.
There you go.
Don't say I never brought you any good crap.
And Rick Riley will be there at the tailgate party this Sunday.
And although he doesn't know it yet, so will suds.
Not.
He's such a deadhead, you know what?
At least I'm going to the game.
Yeah, I mean, such a deadhead.
You think just even if he didn't go to the game, just come to the tailgate party.
You could smuggle them in and sign some autographs and shake hands and drink a few beers and, you know, get some free Star Trek tapes.
They do something useful.
But he won't do it.
Deadhead.
Championship playoffs.
Championship playoffs.
We got it there.
The bills.
Don't forget we got a root for Buffalo on Saturday so the game will be here.
Yeah.
Well, because if Pittsburgh wins, they have the home field advantage throughout the playoffs.
But if Buffalo wins were the division champions, so they have to come down here again for that game for which you have the ticket right in your hand.
Wouldn't that be great?
Buffalo coming back one more time.
And then since it would be the last game of the year for Buffalo and us together, we could like a kidnap all the Buffalo people come down here and round them up, put them in a camp somewhere.
Huh?
Right.
Electric bleachers.
I like it.
Cattle prods.
Here's a Tampa.
Hello.
Hey, Neil. How you doing?
Pretty good.
You don't really think Miami's going to beat San Diego this weekend.
I don't know.
I don't know.
If we play well, we got a chance.
I mean, they're not like the end of the world.
They did start by losing their first four games.
Yeah, but I'll tell you what the last two runs that dolphins played.
They looked like they couldn't beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneer.
That is correct.
Well, that's because we like to keep you off balance.
You never know which team's going to show up.
Well, I'll tell you what, they better step it up this Sunday because the way that San
Diego teams play in the...
Yeah, you're right.
It looked pretty strong to me.
That's right.
There's something else I wanted to mention.
Yes, sir.
I noticed I heard on one of our issue in news breaks that the Marlins are having a
advertising blitz across the state and they're neglecting to come to Tampa.
I can't imagine why.
Wonder why?
Can't figure that out.
They're going to Jacksonville, Gainesville, Orlando, Sarasota, all over the place.
Not Tampa St. Pete?
Not Tampa St. Pete.
Must have been an oversight on Wayne's part.
Must have been.
We will call him up and make sure he makes a personal appearance right there on a footstep of your
thing.
Oh, and by the way, you're going to West Shore.
Is that it?
On Kennedy.
Okay.
Is that okay, that place?
Oh, yeah, it's a real nice place.
Good.
Debarter loans.
Oh, then it must be okay.
Yeah, it's real nice.
As long as we keep going out of there.
You know the date that you're going to be there?
It's on Saturday, January 23rd or whatever that Saturday is.
I think it's 23rd.
Okay, I'll try to see you there.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
You have to see 6th of 13th.
Oh, that's all right.
Huh?
Wait a minute.
The 9th, the 16th.
And like I said, the 23rd is not what I just said.
Why are you confusing me, Joy?
The 23rd.
This is so good though.
This chocolate malt.
I'm savoring it.
You know how if something is really like extra special centrally good and you try to make it last as long as possible?
No, not that.
No, that too.
Oh, oh, oh.
And it's got like the chocolate malt scrap at the bottom.
See, that's the way a good chocolate malt is.
It's got some of that the malt at the bottom of the thing that isn't like melted yet.
And you kind of like suck that up through the straw and like chew it and get it into your mouth.
And then you go to the dentist.
Here's Tallahassee.
Hello.
Oh, good afternoon.
You're going to be really flimmed up now, I bet.
Yeah.
There you are.
You're right.
I've got a lot of room.
Yeah, man.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone.
I don't like your own milk, does it?
Oh, look at that.
Nice and brown.
Yeah.
It does, if I get free.
I'm taking it home and freezing it and making some homemade milk though.
That's it.
Wouldn't it be something you've returned out that's how they made milk, does?
Yeah.
Flimball, that's what a flimball is.
A milk dud.
Are you sure you guys aren't breeding Legionnaires disease and the air conditioning system?
We invented Legionnaires disease.
I, I, the way your...
As a matter of fact, come to find out Bob Green was a Legionnaire before he came here.
Oh, well, I've, I've got a lot to bring to the table here.
I want to get it out of the way.
Okay, go ahead.
Number one.
We ought to quit picking on the Canadians.
What other group of people could take the letters R, O, Y and pronounce it Y?
Yeah.
That's why we're talking about Lester Patrick or Patrick Raw.
Patrick Raw.
Okay.
And then the other one is, when you always talk about Richard Bay, up here in Tallahassee,
we don't have, is that on WOR?
Right.
You don't have WOR on your cable in Tallahassee.
Well, no wonder, man.
They don't have to be that.
It's a little bit too left-wing and too provocative and too much nudity and too much enjoyable,
good stuff and how it's not once in a while.
When you're talking about the nudity, are they really nude or do they have like those,
let's just put it this way, might as well be.
Might as well be.
But not like the Patrick Bowman, Bluer, great dots like they had at the William Kennedy Smith trial or anything.
One time they did do that.
Okay, well did they use that fuzzy, the thing like they used to shoot Donna Mills and not landing through, you know?
No.
Like the white to a bunch of Vaseline on it.
No.
They know and foul the one day he did have a show like that where they did wipe a bunch of Vaseline on it.
And I have one thing to say about the dolphins.
They're rested, they're ready.
They're really going to, they've enough with the right.
That's right, they are rested and they're ready.
And they're going to do it and Richie Webb says he's going to do it on Sunday.
And then they're going to beat the chargers too.
Right.
And I took, this is kind of in the same mode here, but it could be the kiss of death.
I have my wife's one of my wife's best friends of mine who used to date Jeff from PizzaTraf.
I'm not sure if she dated him or his ponytail, but she dated one of them.
Oh no.
And I just wanted to mention that that you ought to make it clear right now,
he better not show his ugly face near you during the game because I think that's right.
Right, God is that thing real?
Because that'll be the kiss of death.
Mm-hmm.
But it's going to happen, they're doing it, they're going to do it.
And I feel real good and...
Well one way or the other, we are going to do it on Sunday, make no mistake.
And I have a feeling it's going to either be sensational.
Or it's going to be extra ugly.
Yeah, that's right.
And then I'm hoping like you say, let the bills come down one more time.
Right.
One more shot at it.
Yeah.
And I think shot is going to be the word.
And maybe Kelly will be healthy enough to get killed in that game.
We can only hope so.
We can only hope.
We can only hope that Marco Coleman takes him and does a Linda Blirispin with his helmet.
It's not.
We'll just head inside of it.
You know, make a wish and one key grabs one leg and...
And Cox probably grabs the other one.
Or the Cox is to just beat grab one.
Okay, have a great day.
Two, two.
See ya.
Oh, you said you two again, man.
My musical taste buds are all of a sudden starting to get the putrid.
Oh, not you two, please.
Anything but that.
Here's a mobile in Miami on a Broward line.
Hey, yeah.
A little man.
I'm eating a taco bell here.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
Man, so much.
Woof hot.
Listen.
Yes?
You said you're going to do like a remote or an appearance in Tampa?
Uh-oh.
So the taco bell starting to kick in, pal.
Yeah.
Yes, I did.
Maybe.
I'll take it about it.
Now ask Rick Riley because he had a call yesterday that said that where your appearance is going to be, is full of old people.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
So that you might be a pit fight.
And a lot of, yeah, a lot of that.
Well, don't you think it would have been a better idea if Randy and Rick and Sucks and F.
We all went over there together and we did a big S.U.N. thing and uh, you know, I did a real promotion instead of this piecemeal.
This Tom Velvita is such a hick.
He's a very nice guy and he thinks that I'm a pin in the ass, which he's probably right.
But he just so, he's so slow.
They don't understand anything over there.
Everything is OG.
We can get a little press in the paper.
We can get that.
Who cares about that crap?
Typical management.
Right.
And to top it all off, on the way down, just leave Rick Riley there.
Uh-huh.
That was the idea.
That was the game plan.
No, right.
Well, listen, it's going to be a great weekend.
Yes.
And I am rooting for the Pittsburgh Steelers to kick Buffalo's ass.
Why?
Because I hate Buffalo.
I understand.
But do you want us to have to play up there?
Well, you know, I'm like torn between two lovers.
Miami and Pittsburgh.
But I guess I have to go where my heart is.
Where your heart is.
My heart belongs to Pittsburgh.
Have a great life, pal.
And put you up a little bit.
Will you?
People are starting to talk.
Here's, speaking of starting to talk.
Here's Margate.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, great to hear you.
I've been on a town for about a month.
Where you been?
I've been out in San Diego.
How do you press?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Anyway, I just got back and I have a shameless request for you.
I heard this guy call up a couple days ago.
And he asked for this.
You had a conversation with a guy who was in the bridges.
Yeah.
And I've never heard that for the first time the other day.
And if you can play that, I'd really appreciate it.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
It's too late today.
I'd play it right now, too late.
It's too long.
All right, play it early tomorrow then.
We'll do it.
All right, and go dolphin.
Have a great life.
See ya.
Oh, by the way, speaking, I do want to mention this and I know nothing about this deal.
And they probably don't either.
Rick and Suds at Padrinos this Saturday from noon to three.
They would have invited me to be there, but it's too far from where I live.
It's in plantation.
Ada Lundsouth University Drive that's in the fountain shops Padrinos.
And that's from noon to three.
Rick and Suds are going to be there.
They especially made a point of saying we do not want Neil anywhere near our place.
No, I'm not coming over there.
No way.
Oh, but if it's like a flimball comes through the window, you'll know that I was in the neighborhood.
The best of Rick and Suds, CDs, tapes, and I'll wait a minute.
Oh, look at this.
Look at the way out of this says written here.
Boy, oh boy.
It says the best of Rick and Suds, CDs, tapes, and t-shirts will be on sale.
And then in parentheses, it says along with best of Neil items, with all proceeds going to
the Camilo's house, mine will be the ones under the table.
You have to ask for it.
It's like going into the convenience store you have to ask for the magazines with the brown
wrappers on.
That's how the best of Neil stuff is going to be at Padrinos.
It's the stuff that's in the brown, plain wrapper under the table way down deep underneath
there, as in it's getting so deep that I can feel it now.
Padrinos this Saturday, Ricky Suds, 801 South University Drive in the, what is it?
Fountain shops in plantation where most of the places aren't doing too well, by the way.
Except the bookstore.
Is it near the bookstore?
I never saw Padrinos.
I don't know where it is.
I guess it can't be too far because like on one end you got your circuit city and where
the white mountain ice cream used to be that was so great, white rock, white mountain,
whatever it was.
Like way over on the other end you got marshals there, marshals still in business?
No, they're not.
Oh, long gone.
Like I said, it used to be marshals over there and then we got the travel guys, our friends,
whatever happened this year to our travel people by the way.
Absolutely travel.
Remember all the great checks we used to have from them for Camilo's house and really
helped us out tons and tons of money and Peter and all our good buddies over there are
pyzons just kind of disappeared into the woodwork.
So let's get over the $100,000 mark tomorrow for sure because this is really dragging on.
98,429.
We got a long way to go the rest of January and that AT&T Camilo's house hotline 1-800-852-006
and all of our stuff will be there.
In fact, everybody will be there except suds.
Leave an him out on Sunday at the tailgate party because basically he's anti-social this
Sunday from 1 to 4.
