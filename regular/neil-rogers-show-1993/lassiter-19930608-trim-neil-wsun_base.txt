I understand they were working before.
What are you doing?
First of all, you're in the wrong path.
I am.
I thought they're all over here.
How come it's not doing?
I don't know.
They were working earlier because I was playing stuff
out of them earlier, because they really
sounded like crap in mind.
So they have to be in your emotions.
Kara, did you buy any chance to switch in the other room
that would control this?
These car machines they were working earlier?
No, I can't do anything about it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I've learned on hand.
There we were.
He's the guy who makes dumb, Delaware's cry.
He likes to think he's dead.
I was a geek.
I was a geek.
I was a geek.
I was a geek.
And then you got to be head geek here.
Yes.
And so I became head geek.
Well, you see, in essence, what you have just heard
is for off-practical purposes.
That was the entire hour that I did with our beloved
operations manager, Boy Cheese.
We thought we'll put him on for an hour.
People will rip the hell out of him.
You know, it was a Monday type of thing.
You know what Monday's are.
Yeah, we had calls about that.
Really did.
Even the Japanese never saw a bomb that big.
Oh my God, it was absolutely horrible.
I mean, he would put him on the air.
It was his idea.
Said he's lacking in certain social graces.
Well, that's true.
Speaking is one of them.
Well, yes, it is.
One and two word answers.
And that tape that you just heard was like about a 15-minute segment
of my trying to fill time.
And so after you worked with Syracuse, Tom, where did you go then?
And in Milwaukee, Tom, what were some of your duties?
I was a geek.
That's it.
That's the whole thing.
Here comes again.
Look out.
Look out.
That was a geek.
That was a geek.
That was a geek.
That was a geek.
And then you got to be head geek here.
Yes.
And so I became head geek.
I really glad you're enjoying that.
It's a I love it.
Oh, God.
What are you eating now?
A little tuna salad with cheese.
All of it is my breakfast and lunch now.
I know.
No, he said he said that has to last for the afternoon.
I said, I don't want to have lunch.
Oh, OK.
No, not the whole night.
You eat all of it now.
Oh, OK.
That's good.
Schwartz has brought in a tray of sandwiches
that, oh, God, all might be the June made unbelievable.
June has this talent with sandwiches.
She basically takes two pieces of bread
and nine pounds of meat.
A little bit of lettuce, maybe sometimes
some special sauce or mayonnaise.
And man, oh, man, oh, man.
I thought my grandmother.
Oh, anyway, if there's any horny guys out there
that are really desperate, just walk around the parking
line at the Mary Out West Shore at night.
And just pretend you're trying to find the dollhouse guarantee.
Why are you soliciting on the air again?
I'm not soliciting you.
Oh, you think I like your nose here?
You're looking for hookers.
Well, no, I thought you said horny guys, you know?
I didn't know that you were working for the hookers.
I'd say I'm thinking about your anal fixation.
And let's take a call or two, shall we?
Oh, you have any?
Yes, of course I have calls.
They haven't caught all that you're on yet.
The calls yesterday for a Monday.
Yes, we did.
Let's go to Greenleaf.
You know, I'm saving your ass up here, man.
You don't have to worry about being embarrassed
with this type of thing anymore.
Let's go to Greenleaf.
I green your on the air at WSUN.
Hey, Buenos, too.
You're high, Neil.
How are you doing?
How are you doing?
Great.
I'm so happy you're up here.
I love it here.
I was driving across the Howard Franklin Bridge this morning,
and I was thinking how much I really love it here.
I don't think I'd want to live here, but I love it here.
Why wouldn't you want to live here?
I wouldn't mind being here like Monday through Friday
working here and then going home on the weekend
as much as I like of whatever I want.
Yeah.
That sounds great.
And even cars that she dressed curt in a tank top in spaces.
Ha, ha, ha.
Listen, I just wanted to tell you, I don't know.
If there's anybody that needs a little son, it's that kid.
I'm telling you, he is the pastiest looking human being
I've ever seen in my life.
Yeah, but for the...
He looks like Bella Legosi suck every drop of blood
out of that kid's body.
Yeah, but by the time he's 40 years,
he'll still have skin and soft as a baby's ass.
If you can imagine a 40-year-old baby.
Yeah.
Listen, I just wanted to tell you the guy,
the evil man who is up here
said nasty things about you guys in Orlando, talk radio.
Who's that?
Jim Phillips.
No, Jim.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
He's a blacklist.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Yeah, Phillips.
But listen.
Another pretender, another one of the great pretenders.
All those guys heard that little station
has just had a hemorrhage.
They've thrown people off the air left and right,
top to bottom, it's incredible.
Well, isn't that Buddy Bud station?
Yeah, well, what do you expect?
It just got lost though.
Pretty soon they're going to be doing headline news
24 hours a day again.
No, actually Buddy Bud just sold it.
Oh, Danny.
Yes, what?
I never got my coupon for charcoal.
Are you serious?
Which is the real person?
Oh my god.
No, it isn't.
Because I didn't want to.
Why the hell did you bitch in Mona?
Kara, she's a charcoal bitch.
Because we love Kara.
We only bitch in Mona too on her orders.
Oh, man, is she giving me dirty looks?
Oh my god, is she?
Now she's waving a finger at me.
Is she?
Yes.
What?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, one second here,
call it.
What's the problem, Kara?
Why are these people getting their charcoal?
I told you it's promotions.
It's velvita.
There is no promotion at this date.
It's velvita.
It's velvita's a pig.
Yes, he is.
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you back to Kara.
We'll try to get this straight now.
We'll throw in a refrigerator magnet for you too.
Hey Neil.
Yeah.
We love you.
576 WSU in in Penelope.
Oh.
Oh.
He's a Lanciter.
You better worry.
He may get scrappy.
God, you really polished off that food, something fierce.
Whoa.
I'd say shorts.
Thanks a lot, shorts.
Thanks a lot, shorts.
Thanks a lot, shorts.
Thanks a lot, June, who put together that sandwich that you just devoured there.
Unbelievable.
And I, what the hell, let's take some more phone calls, why not?
Let's go to Tampa.
Hi, Tampa.
You're on there at WSUN.
Hello, Tampa.
Tampa wants.
I can hear you groaning there, Tampa.
Hello.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes, why?
This is a sample.
This is a sible.
Is that what you said?
Are you doing it, Sible?
Yeah, we're never going to...
Sible or simple?
No, man.
Simple.
Oh, a sible.
Yeah.
What's shaking the head, Sible?
Yes, I give you a call, man.
So, my complaint is gone to you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you want the money?
Yeah.
And what's the answer?
Well, I'll take it.
You could win a million dollars if you give us the right answer.
What is it?
Oh, this is a bonus.
And the shoe I like to have in the same bag.
Yeah.
And what's the answer, Selma?
Well, that's a good question.
Man, we've been searching for it for years and years and years.
Just as soon as Neil and I figured out we're getting the hell out of the business man,
we were counting on you to tell it.
Yeah, it could get calls like this.
I'd be up to a one-share in this market.
Oh, you would.
You got me there.
Now, I got you.
That's it.
Yeah.
That's it.
That's it, man.
I'll hang it, Selma.
Huh?
I said, see ya.
Oh.
934.
God, you just bring up the best of the callers, man.
I tell you.
I bet you that Yahoo preacher guy is going to call back again after 10.
I bet you're for his third call of the day.
He doesn't call back on a real retentive.
Yeah, but when I'm in town, man, he gets to the hots.
He can't control himself.
God, almighty, look who's here.
Look who's here.
Come on in.
He can come in.
It's okay.
Oh.
God.
Well, I'm in.
He heard the phone was here already.
Yeah, let's get him in here while the food is still fresh.
He can't hear while the food is still fresh.
Oh, I tell you the first is walked in.
Oh, what a celebrity cast here today.
We didn't do a good job for yesterday.
So today, uh, Schwartz is monitoring the food yesterday.
Did you?
He got food.
I didn't need to.
I would try my best behavior.
Who brought you the food?
They wouldn't tell it.
No, because it wasn't a sponsor, right?
But it was okay.
They wouldn't tell you because somebody goes out of his,
out of his way to free food down here for free.
If they marry out west, you're actually good.
And they all even go all over the world.
It's the second and third time you said that.
There you go.
There's nothing.
Yes.
No.
No, I'm paying for my own food.
What the hell are you going on and on and on and on about it?
I never knew you'd a rave about food you paid for.
It's okay.
Have you ever known you'd a rave about food you paid for?
Now that you mentioned it.
No.
No, it is good.
For hotels.
Okay, let's go to Tampa.
Hi, Tampa. You're on the air.
It's a WSUN.
Morning, Bob.
Good morning, Tampa.
Morning, I tell you, sir.
And you guys together.
This is really a beautiful thing.
A beautiful thing.
I'm telling that if we could do this all the time.
Uh, Neil and the bird and I could just do a radio show.
We probably have this sucker up to, uh, what?
You figure about it.
Two two.
Two one, two two, um, two two.
What do you think as well?
What do you think?
Excuse me.
There's a radio show going on.
You're talking about this.
How this is worse than Miami?
This is worse than Miami.
Here.
Here.
You're talking out loud.
I heard what he said.
You got to hear what he said when I was taking this office.
What did he say?
He said something about, I was talking about the magnets.
Yeah.
He doesn't know why you did that.
He doesn't know why I did it.
And I said, well, you have to get out the razor blade and cut the
some country thing off the bottom of these magnets.
He said, no, Bob can do that.
He's got no calls in here anyway.
That's what he said.
He hate you like poisoned.
Bob, can I have a magnet?
Sure.
You're right.
Oh, great.
Look at it.
Oh, I'm going to stop.
I was debating about coming back here.
Here.
I'm going to stop.
I was debating about coming back here.
A bag of charcoal.
A magnet.
And about 20 or 30.
A little bit.
That miserable, little son of a, he's coming in here with snapple
for the other people.
I see an empty bottle over there.
No, I buy that.
I buy that.
I mean, here's the cap with a price zone.
I buy it coming in in the morning.
Where do you buy it?
It's 7-11 up the screen.
Circle K.
Circle K.
And here's your charcoal.
Yeah.
You didn't tell me that I'd get a magnet if I came back.
Well, I didn't want to promise too many things.
I just like to figure it out.
The old one with the gorilla is no thank you.
Oh, Randy left a place like a toilet after Rick left it like, you know, a bigger toilet.
Ben, I work with Slombs.
You ought to see it out.
You think this is a toilet?
You ought to see it.
It's a toilet.
I think somebody threw away the Q-sheet for the new rock comedy album.
Oh, nice.
That's gone.
It was sitting right in here.
That's gone now.
Somebody threw away my JNJ.
There's more stuff than you.
That Camaro cut is good.
What was the one we played yesterday today?
Today, it was good.
Yeah, I heard that.
That was good.
It's coming up again today, 20 or 30 times.
What's wrong with that?
How come I can hear the colors when they're all right?
And I can't hear the colors when the pubs are...
No, we still have a caller on there.
I'm sorry, we forgot all about you.
You there?
He's a caller, she's a tremendous...
Oh, we can't hear this guy.
I can hear nothing.
I'm calling you because I really need a...
You need a wife?
I need a magnet.
You need a...
I had a two-year-old come visit me the other day.
Yeah.
Which is nice mother.
I mean, kids suck, but especially when they're two.
Tell me about him, man.
I had them tied a year ago.
Tell me to this mother.
I really dig his mother.
She's beautiful.
How old is this kid?
The kids, too.
Oh, too.
Now, we have the famous WSU and toilet magnets.
Oh, you stick on the jazz.
Tell me.
This kid is something.
I mean, I'm in a living room.
Well, the kids in the living room with his mom,
and I figure she's watching them.
And I'm out there just hiding my bones because the kids here,
you know, I'm to drink the warm water.
I'm just having a good day.
And what did the kid do?
He picks up an atomizer, a spray bottle that my roommate,
girlfriend here, and sprays her hair down.
And he goes over and emulates his mother with Windex
and sprays down my TV.
But of course, there's no soap in it.
So it goes into the TV.
Shorts the whole TV out.
Oh, man.
I'm gonna be 100 bucks.
God.
The worst thing that happened was when I go back into kitchen.
Yeah.
I look on my refrigerator, and your picture and neopictures
there with magnets.
He took your picture down later.
He wiped.
He's my magnet.
And he puts my lipstick all over the refrigerator.
I know all over the, your picture.
Oh.
I'm gonna have to come and see you, Sarah,
and I hope you have more pictures to hand.
Oh, yes, sure.
Sure.
Oh, okay, man.
Look, let me hand you back to Cara.
That's the saddest dance story.
What a lucky day it is that, you know,
this is a refrigerator magnet day here at the station.
That's really lucky for you.
Nice talking to you guys.
Okay.
Just another Tom Zelvita idea and presentation.
Those refrigerator magnets.
When I came in this morning, and Cara said, you know,
hey, Bob, we got 600 of these refrigerator magnets
to give away.
I said, are you serious?
This is as big a bomb as the charcoal giveaway.
And, yes, that's right, Cara.
He's number one, honey.
That Tom Zelvita.
He is number one in my book.
Go to Newport, Richie, a bill.
Bill, is that you?
Oh, Newport Richie, Bill.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, hi.
Hello.
Oh, it's not Bill.
No, how come every time I call you think it's Bill?
Well, we just get real excited when we see Newport Richie
up on the screen.
It's a little lady.
Well, oh, I had told the little lady from Newport Richie.
I'm doing fine in the fight and get over the shorts
as you're gonna eat yellow for dessert.
Oh, you're gonna bring us dessert?
So I carry calls to Newcastle.
Start for you, yellow.
Oh, that's sweet.
How was your sense of indiatry?
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
You know, the things that I went out of my way to look for,
that was a disaster.
But, that is so, I felt so old.
Yes, yes.
You know, especially when that shopping center that had disappeared
and I stopped and asked about it.
And people looked at me like I was crazy.
Like, just as this has been gone for decades, fella.
Hey, and you tell those guys that when Randy talks at night,
she says she cleans up her place every night when she comes in
at some level.
No, I think she cleans up her apartment every night.
No, she cleans up the office where she works every night.
She picks up her papers, does cleans around wherever she talks from.
Well, I'm telling you, she left this place so bad last night
that the FM morning mama complained.
Well, you have to forgive her today because she had a bad sunburn.
Oh, that's why she, oh, okay.
Yeah, you have to forgive her today.
Well, forgive her then.
She said she was cooked.
If you ask me to forgive her, all forgive her.
Well, you can look over your shoulder.
I may be haunting you when you're eating your dinner.
Great way.
You're nice, Sharon, from him.
Don't forget.
I want one of your, one of your magas.
Oh, you want one of the refrigerator magas, okay.
God, you see there are so popular kneel.
What were you next to one if you say it?
Would you, maybe I could have cut it to you.
It's all we did to get a few of those refrigerator magas for your show.
Yeah.
Wouldn't that be great?
See ya.
Oh, you're going to love this one, Neil.
You're going to love this one.
What?
Every time you give away those magnets, I have to sit in the thing and chop them up.
No, you're giving away the warm ones.
No, we're not.
That's what I want to give away.
He says, no.
Why not?
It's promoting the the worm, man.
That way, you can't repeat what he just said.
That way you can put down on your little sheet of Bob Neil.
You know, you had all this time to promote the worm and it didn't cost anything.
You'll get brownie points.
My God, the next time he comes down, I'll buy you a Coca-Cola.
That'll be great, Tommy.
Just great.
Let's go to, um...
Oh, geez, you're going to love this, Neil.
How low, Rose.
Hello, baby.
Oh, how you doing, honey?
How was your vacation?
Long time no here.
Pretty good.
Yeah, well, I don't want to be a chronic.
No, you're not a chronic rose.
God forbid.
Hey, super Neil.
Why don't you ever call me, I'll show any more, Rosie.
You want to accept my call.
Right.
Well, hold your belt, then you're nose or something when you call.
Try to trick George.
You know what?
He always liked my calls.
He never said one thing bad about my calls.
All of a sudden, one day, he hates me.
Oh, no.
I'm really glad that you were a chronic that called 600 times a day all over the radio dial.
We don't call for a call.
Yeah, but you only call one time per station.
That's for hours.
That's not true.
You only call last or about every three weeks, stupid Neil.
Yeah.
Well, it's only been about a week and a half this time, Rosie.
Yeah.
At Bitchy Rose.
Neil's a bitch.
Yeah.
Yeah, you are.
Uh-huh.
Now Rose, remember what happened the last time you got into a scream and shout-
Max with somebody on the radio.
See what in a second here.
chronic.
Do you remember Rose?
What happened the last time?
No.
Yeah, he taped it.
It was me and Bill.
And what happened to Bill?
He died.
That's right.
Well, don't you get your lesson, don't you go call and, uh, Neil, any names or nothing,
now Rose?
Hey, really, Bob, would I die or Neil die?
I don't know.
Neil would die.
Well, I'm dying from the call already Rose.
I already died a couple of days ago.
He wasn't getting any calls with.
Yeah.
So wish he could be on a 10 in the morning.
We're working on it, Rose.
I think he should.
We thought that we thought that the refrigerator magnets would do it today, but he is, uh, he's survived
and is in great shape.
Now, it's just too early, but if you can make it a six-bobby, you can make it anywhere
and anyhow.
That's right, Rose.
944, the time you can land on AM620 and I look up and there's a furry.
A little friend out there eating out of the, more to go.
And it's just about time to take it.
So we better run, cram in some calls here.
Let's go to Sarasota, hi there, Sarasota, you're on the air.
Hey, Bob, morning.
Good morning.
How you, Neil?
It wants to know how you are, Neil.
How great, great.
Oh, good.
He didn't have his headphones on yet, sir.
Anyway, I felt like a real jerk this morning, you know.
I would have said, hold up, but that's where I could pick up the phone and I called it.
Yeah.
Now, look down on my roller dexon.
I was dialing the IOD number.
Yeah, we got them both on them.
They're both W. I got them both on the same way.
I'm chucked in the answer.
Nobody answered.
I'll be damned.
I had a call down there this morning and nobody answered.
Neil, did you hear that?
Anyway, that was the 800 number.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I gave you something.
I followed you up north and I was up in New York here.
You were the one following me.
And I got to hear the big Howard sperm for the first time.
Oh, yeah.
What'd you think?
Well, I had a ran a car and I drifted across the dial and it wasn't on the automatic key.
And then I had to sort of search it out.
I was in Newark and on he came.
That's one thing that's just a weak edge.
A lot of time.
Hey, Ron.
He's on a station called K-Rotting.
Yeah, right.
And I thought, if you guys ever thought you had a whole bunch of people in the studio at one time,
he brings in a whole box.
He's going to have it as some people to do the show with him.
He does.
Plus a lot of people off the air doing a drink.
He was down on the floor getting a massage from his gal who sent in nude pictures from Cleveland.
And he flew her in and talking all about the different ways they do things in Cleveland.
And he got all the time.
They do it differently in Cleveland.
I think so.
You only do about this Niel.
Please.
Anyways, Mother Call, did you ever heard that bit?
His mother called.
Oh, she ripped some of the other ones.
I mean, she says, powered, boring, boring, show this one.
I mean, you know, it's horrible.
Well, Cara's mother calls her on the dark hole.
Maybe that's where she got the stun from or maybe it's where Howard got it from.
Maybe Howard's been listening to the dark hole.
Randy's mother calls her on here too.
That's when the Niel started calling.
Well, when her mom started calling.
Yeah, but I'll tell you, it was a different show.
It's really different.
Sounds different.
Cram was commercials and there's big bites of them.
I'll run back and forth in Niel.
A lot of promo and stuff and comedy acts and stuff.
Yeah, well, we don't do that kind of radio here, man.
But anyhow, these guys are bad influence on you.
Bob, coming up from Miami.
Do you think so?
How old are they?
All they do is eat and eat and eat.
What do you mean?
I'm the one that's been getting the food for them.
They didn't get any food on their own.
Oh, but boy, they all eat.
Such as a pig.
You know, he's always...
I mean, Niel fed me for years down there, well, months down there in Miami.
And I'm just trying to return the favor.
Well, anyway, all Niel, I was on prodigy with Jim Skyler.
Well, that wasn't for Jim Skyler.
That was for prodigy.
He must know you money or something because he was really giving you all sorts of accolades.
Great.
Talking to that guy from Milwaukee, to be in WFLA and to evening, he's on there all the time.
Oh, yeah, Jay Marvin.
All the people with no lives are on prodigy, right?
Well, hey, Niel.
Don't do whatever happened to.
That sort of interesting.
Name all these names of them.
Yeah, dynamite.
Yeah, like their own names.
What happened to Rob Hyland and Bob Hyland?
He died, I heard.
Yes, dead.
Well, thanks for the accolade, man.
Okay.
Take care.
All right.
It was Bob Hyland.
Bob Hyland, I don't even know him.
PMOX, St. Louis.
Oh, the General Manager.
I used to call you at three o'clock in the morning because he was just going to bed at that hour, just getting up.
Oh, yeah, just coming into the station.
We're out all about him.
Yeah, man.
Pinellas 576 WS U.N., that should do the trick.
Lasseter on A and 620 WS U.N., it's not...
Yeah.
But I'll tell you what, good, brother.
Yeah.
I would rather listen to you fart and hear pretty girls sing.
Don't ever do it.
Carabit.
Oh, well, when some loosen.
Let's go to...
I'm a risk card.
It's going to go.
We may have got to go.
Like that last one.
Week.
Week.
It's the best he could do.
Week.
Who was that?
Are you serious?
You didn't recognize that voice?
I had to wait for it to...
...cute up again.
Oh, that does have a fast cut.
Oh, yeah.
Great.
Round and round and round.
She goes where?
She's down.
Nobody knows.
It's one of those two-second drop-ins on it.
Oh, two-and-a-half minute-card.
That's always fine.
But it's cute up, Bob.
Yeah, I know.
I was looking for something else.
Well, let's just hear that.
Schwartz.
God.
You don't recognize that voice?
Kurt.
Yes.
But here, you see, when Kurt's really into what he's doing, this is the kind of enthusiasm
he can have.
Bob, God.
Isn't that great versus...
The beating.
God.
Oh, my God.
Let's not go too hard.
Let's not go anywhere.
Let's say...
What is my show?
You were ripping Randy and Ashton.
Nobody heard it earlier this morning.
She did very well.
The fact that she's not...
Why is she always bitching about what everybody else is on?
Well, since you brought it up, I kind of explained to her this morning that, you know,
23 years and years and years and years of success is what gets you.
The box, a couple of trends, is not exactly what they're doing there.
I know.
She thinks that because she was on she and she was in New York, that has...
No, it has nothing to do with this thing.
Nothing to do with this.
It's a whole new ballgame, honey.
You got to pay your dues, bitch.
That's right.
And, you know, pay them to me and to Neil.
Right?
And to say, it's not much of a check.
We understand that, but we'll take it.
For Night with Heaven or Heather or whatever your hell name is.
I understand.
And then, then, then, then, forget about the cash.
Oh, okay.
Now, can I take a call?
In fact, this morning, Randy was still wandered around in the parking lot.
Wait for me to see if any of those hookers were still driving around?
Really?
Are you serious?
That's a true story, by the way.
Did you know that?
Randy was in the parking lot looking for the hookers?
He's driving around the parking lot across from the dollhouse.
No, I never heard that.
In fact, probably during their off hours.
I'll be damned.
Now, can I take a call?
Please.
You know, we can...
Well, you actually...
You got a whole bunch of calls.
I know I have a whole bunch of well here.
And all those people that call you, they're all OP,
OP holding his nose and stuff.
I do well here.
80% of the calls that we give them down here are OP calls.
They're calling right in his room.
Really?
Yeah, I'll be damned.
Let's go to Brandon.
Hi there, Brandon.
You're on there at WSUN.
Hello, Brandon.
Hello.
Yes, hello there.
Hope we didn't take you with anything.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Oh, great.
Yourself?
Okay.
Hey, thanks for calling to inquire.
Let's go to a cellphone.
Hi, self.
Well, the people here are so friendly.
You'll be able to just call up and ask how you're doing.
Hi, self.
And Ozone, you're on the air.
Good morning, Bob.
Good morning.
Now, this question is directed to you.
Okay.
I've been to the Yatsude Show for the first time caller.
Uh-huh.
Who is the bird?
What does he do?
And why is he on the radio?
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't answer that.
The bird is Neil's friend.
I think they used to be...
You know, the bird used to be your sidekick, right?
Yeah.
For three years.
For three years.
For three different radio stations.
And...
And, uh...
What do they do now?
Well, I'm retired.
He guest appears with Neil whenever he's in Tampa.
I'm retired.
He lives in like you there.
Right, and he listens to this show occasionally and takes notes and calls.
Neil and, uh, gives him a vicious fiery porch about how bad I'm doing.
Do not.
You do, too.
I've heard you.
Maybe...
No.
Yeah, Neil says, well, how's he doing for her?
You go, uh-huh.
No.
He's right.
And he goes like that, no matter what you ask.
That's true, you know.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I've been to that lab.
One more time.
Do the lab, Bert.
There it is.
Bert.
Bert.
Bert.
Bert.
Bert.
Bert is good.
Bert is good.
You got it, man.
Okay.
Take care.
Good one.
Off it is to Salah Hassey.
I have to tell Ahassey you're on the air, WSUN.
Yeah, too much to cover.
No time.
Unbelievable.
Well, that's a problem.
We don't have around here too much to cover.
You're being bored and David Corrested by the way.
Yes, indeed.
Hey, Bert.
Hey.
I got your tape.
Oh, hey, Tim.
How's it going?
Good.
How was it?
Oh, very good.
Very good.
Tim, we don't have time to get into it.
Now, what are we doing here, man?
We've got his own plant call set up here.
Why don't we just go home at 9 for the rest of the week, you know?
You know, you need what you need to do, Bob, to change that cart from Kara, Bitch.
Yeah.
The Kara got us and Randy Bitch.
Oh, really?
That's what you need to do with that.
Bob, God.
Well, I work on that.
You know, Kara got us.
Well, of course, if you know, she throws out my shorts menu again tonight, I think we just might come up with a Randy Bitch, a cart.
Randy Bitch.
Woo.
Yeah, cart that up in there.
Want to see that first thing in the morning.
I want to do, I want to back a charcoal, which I didn't get the first bag yet.
And I want a refrigerator, Megan.
Okay, I'll put you on hold.
Take care of that with the person on the other end of the phone, who probably will send you even three magnets now.
Oh.
For a shallow woman who has no idea what the hell is going on in the world, and you're right around in your little car,
your little guy, damn, double phone, and have nothing better to do than call up and say, oh, your language is offensive.
I was going to hell in a hand basket, lady.
Glaceter.
