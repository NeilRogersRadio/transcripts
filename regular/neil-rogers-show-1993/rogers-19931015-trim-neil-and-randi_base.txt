album it is his best album why are we discussing
this we're discussing you now don't try to deflect
the use what's the talk about
let's talk about Bob for a couple hours i hate Bob
and so do i good not just because of you because i don't
i'm not a professional Bob has no class
stabbing phony is what he is you know
and i will be the first one to tell you that you
have some story into what is going on in the
game and you'll sucked up to me good all that will be the day you fat
take i just i just had a witness who called
who was there and said hello at the game like a lot of
other people didn't tap a Saturday and Joel
chronic Joel who's will never darken our door gangsters and
Oshan provocateur but uh he sat right in between us so i
wasn't even sitting by Bob and in addition to which i wasn't
sitting by him at dinner at Donatello's he was sitting
like uh do you think that's the one second
no but listen to me why would somebody go on the
ear and say that i sucked up to him for what what is he
gonna do for me you sucked up to him right but why would
anybody say that it makes no sense nothing he says makes any sense
like he don't make any sense
his fla knows pickers that he's like the glue of
radio the big fat will in the small part
is the big fat way of his and market
because he knows he can't make it here he can't cut
the mustard here that we would never even consider him in a
major market doing anything
what i think that's it that they know that
he presents you for your success he resents me
for mine now you know what it's like getting a phone call
to a father i can't see this guy it was like i can a phone call
from her i talked to her around the phone yesterday and i'm holding the phone like
just like this i guess that i was weeping like this i mean like five feet away like
and the dogs are listening oh really is that what you do now well because you
don't have to have a close to your ear or your ear yeah so
anyway let me take a break and then we'll come back and tell
everybody the good news is there good news yeah
it seems Bob is gonna be unhappy because Bob has been doing a dance him
and care over there been playing grab ass with each other
praying that dancing on your hand you know you say
well do a break it's talk 21 to W watching it because i thought you weren't going to be
here when it gets now you look at that and tell me that that isn't something really
extra special right there yeah he's cute he is good god what do you have such crappy
taste anyway what am i asking you about i do not you have the worst taste in not just
men but in humans like in Tampa that's oh what was your name who that pig
oh what was your name heaven heaven hell would have been a better name
not heaven she was disgusting she was gross she was almost as disgusting as that
jab at the hockey game that she's looking like this
like that Neil she was beautiful at that time i
weighed 30 pounds more than i would have the broad of the hockey game last
time you weren't there is wife who's like a big fan of ours i
were cats from base side from the marketing department i hate everybody named cats
by the way yeah yeah so anyway she kept to give me these ugly looks and then he comes over to boy
curtain turns out that he's a big fan and like a buddy buddy with curts that should explain some of it
so we're going to watch some of your video after we watch the rain he's going to continue to be
here just out of spite in fact you said that just to piss Bob and carol she's going to work for nothing
she'll work for free forever just to agonize them and of course get him more material
now i heard him a couple of nights ago and it was the most scathing the most uncalled for the most bush
league the most outrageous and then when you're sitting you talk to somebody like i was talking to you
on the phone yesterday and if you would have come on the air and repeated a conversation i mean it's you just don't
do that it's just common sense if you have even a minute degree of professionalism or integrity which Bob lacks both
exactly you know you you called me back after i spoke to you and you said please don't mention this thing
right right you i go what are you out of your mind like anything that you and i would have nothing
nothing to do with anything that was just like a little time to do with anything exactly but like i would have
a repeat anything that you ever said to me in confidence and like you actually told him any of these things that he said
because none of it was based in reality Bob is not based in reality car is you know suckling something really seriously wrong
with a hearing the charges into carat too that's serious that he is not stop with this ridiculous
he will not admit it to you but i can assure you as sure as i'm sitting here that he's like got fantasies
about her he is obsessed with that fit you know it's a fat part who know did you see her husband by the way
but did you see her husband i can't even believe she's married to anything well not to anything to something
why he's good or really
i don't want to talk about what do you don't i love dogs don't insult the she is the most heinous person
i have here's a girl who they take out of the stupid little news room and they say okay here a little cheeky
we're going to give you like something to do you get to clean up after Bob and all of a sudden her ego gets to be like the size of
Texas she's out of control and she's sitting there trashing me like she's got something some right plus you got to realize how
chicken this stuff is how ridiculous this stuff is they're over there where i can't hear the god damn sure i think you owe me i think you should do
from now to a clock let me go home you owe me i do don't you yeah didn't i straighten your problem out you're the best then i tell you that i give you good advice
you came to the godfather always and on the day of my daughter's wedding i said the
okay let's take a caller to because somebody listening might know who you are
serisota hi there good morning that's her good afternoon or everything i thought it was when i started it
well i got my tongue out of that again after one beauty let's say you've had a chance at it
yeah anybody calling on this article i come that over here lawman get the bottom of case
now run it by me again it's about this lady who's been moonin the railroad engineers over here
moonin it yeah i'll be very re-fonded it's it's it's priceless two undercover palmetto detectives were on a mission to preserve
the community's moral order for several days it seems to see x railroad engineer and accrued found themselves
repeatedly insulted by a woman who ran from the back of the wild turkey bar and mooned them
she would stand eight feet from the tracks a few hundred yards from downtown on the main street
and bear her behind it irritated the railroad workers they sought police help now get this the detectives
decided to launch a stakeout they don't all t-shirts and jeans and stood look out on the slow moving cargo
when they reached eight and you and you're the horn and the and the sure enough woman appeared
she said she walked to the track pause turned around pulled her pants down then they said she bent over
and expected her rust colored cowboy boots and wag her buttocks at the train
oh she was wagoning beautiful the detectives jumped from the train made the capture
okay they placed the suspect in jail now then the guys at the bar they're all mad so what do they do they all get together and they bail her out
it was entrapment said a man with a pool cue the guy on the train honked the horn twenty times because he wanted her to do it again
the deadensins of the bar took up a collection bailed her out I didn't do anything wrong she said later holding a pink drink we were having fun
and if the guys were mad because the coppers all arrested her now what was this this is empaume auto
oh and pal matter well we know what would they do there
they're three with each other making some troops
right the coppers go on to say that they're mad because they're wasting taxpayers money doing this
but the sergeants said the department had received a similar complaint and they knew who she was because they recognized her face
yeah they recognized her whatty cheeks
but the bar patrons didn't care later in the day in fact another woman at the wild turkey ran out to the railroad tracks rolled down her pants and screamed arrest me
i thought that was price that's beautiful i would have i would have a price list and probably got a price tag i don't like everything else
i want to ask you something is the call to trophy trophy that they give for the most valuable player
kind of all kinds of lies and stories this man who was stolen every idea every piece of material that i ever had
and done it poorly by the way very poorly
and so glad you finally seen the light on him because
well wait a minute wait a minute did i ever say that he was good did i ever say that he had a show
