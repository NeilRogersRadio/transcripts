Covered up for that dottering old man, which the bad news is I missed my good close buddy

We didn't get a chance to bond in the tea room or anything like that
In fact, he had Zach in there cleaning out the bag again, which I thought
You know, when you think of you, if you kick somebody off, they're sure you would make him clean out their bag again

Yeah, and then I'm here, I saw the beast holy crap man Jesus God Almighty somebody wants to stucca I think mo to get even with a must to Stucca bicycle pump up his ass and blown it, didn't I tell you? Wow. He looks like the inflatable beast.
I'm serious! He's like a human accordion blow up party beast. Wow wow wow wow
when did that blow it out? And anyway then I hear Zach is the door man at the
Da House? Good news I heard Joe going on a great like the about that. Of course I
hate to break the news dude you ain't got to get any. Can you even begin to
imagine that? No. I wasn't trying to. Well I'm just saying you can't even begin to
imagine it. Anyway I saw that debate last time release most of it on MSNBC. What
is my cable company is it Media One which used to be a hundred different things
used to be store and it used to be this. It used to be all these other homecasts.
Homecasts and Type Ks.
Homecasts. Whatever it is. So what they've done is they moved a whole bunch of
channels from months now we haven't been able to find Fox Sports Florida where
the Panther games are which we got to satellite dishes so you can still see
about the fan in the ass come to find out they moved it from 24 to I think 42.
They just keep moving crap around all over the place without telling you. So they
moved MSNBC which used to be five and now it's channel 73. So I'm surfing and
surfing and surfing looking for the debate last night. It took me about 20 minutes
to find a guy to him thing. Of course their response would be well nobody watches
MSNBC anyway anyway which is a good point. So we might even make a channel
173 but so I saw that debate last night. I want to tell you right now folks and I
know this isn't going to win any friends in this audience because they got to
results what I do with them. I saved the polls from the weekend which I have
them here somewhere. See I'm disorganized now because all those sales assholes
coming in here. Nice seeing you, Skruando ever put your ugly pussy here again.
Okay. God do I hate that bitch. I don't know what the hell happened to them. I had
with the second one because you screwed up bad on Friday. What because you
forgot to fax Eric the third poll for when we were leading you didn't know I
faxed it after the show but I faxed it at what time because I faxed it to well
whatever okay so let's say he screwed up because he's kind of a painly I screwed
up. Okay somebody screwed up. So anyway when the because the poll with Dean and
Bush kept going so when it got to 499 I printed it out so we'll have exactly
the same number of votes. One that pretty clever of a dodging old fool like me
by the way I got to say this also I come in here and I'm wearing a shirt that
probably is the the oldest old man shirt I have ever worn in my life looks
older than you. Right in other words this is the typical South Florida old man's
outfit. Buttons biggest saucers. Right. I mean not found you have to be I don't
even know why I put it on. I guess it was just having to be hanging there you know
what do I care. I'm in the museum. This you would agree this is an old man now all I
ever hear at this place. Oh Gido shirts he wears there's nothing wrong with a
shirt side wear it off this one and what do I hear this one beast oh nice shirt
new shirt nice shirt. Well of course compared to him I'm a fashion player you know
when you weigh 600 pounds what are you gonna wear beside a pup tent and an awning right
right but I'm almost embarrassed to wear this thing but it's one of those you can
wear on the outside of your pants and still you like fat ridg again now. I think it's made
out of material that's illegal now with the guaya berra kind of look you know when
you got a big fat puppy pretend you're Cuban man. Oh and speaking of specs wow who
was that bitch I bet you somebody this audience knows who that broad was last night the
weekend the weekend bitch I wish you the scene that she made Rosanne Rosanna Dennis
seem articulate that that's how she she was talking like this about her Chibi and about
the yeah oh my god and and she was supposed to be one of the moderators on the brown
and black caucus lester holt was there for kind of like the chocolate brown people or
whatever he is I said and he was good like he always is and she was supposed to be the
spick moderator while she wasn't satisfied with being a moderator she was like making
up her own questions her own answers her own commentary really she you would have been
so humiliated and thank God she was reacon because then you had to pick on him some more
but man where did they find that bitch she was ridiculous Rico and she had no idea it
was pathetic we're in a sad state man just look around you we're in a sad state so anyway 499
votes for each on Friday and we asked if the election were held today who do you vote for
uh westerly Clark had 344 bush 87 I wouldn't vote 68 so the percentages were westerly Clark had 69
percent bush 17.4 and wouldn't vote 13.6 following that Howard Dean 72.1 percent bush 15.4
and I wouldn't vote 12.4 so Howard Dean uh let's see the little over 3 percent more and bush
a couple of percent less so Dean did a little bit better than Clark in this crowd but when I tell
you what I have to say today about Howard Dean there are going to be a lot of people unhappy but
that's okay I don't really care I'm not one of those suckles that's going to come on here and
pander to anybody I'm going to tell you exactly the way I see it oh poor Dennis Cassinus man
how sad it is can we get him in touch with Chuck Alphyr and get him some better looking here huh look
why not that's what he needs oh hey look look at this you see the new back I don't I don't read it
you can write off the bat starting with his squiggly little I don't read it little goofball on the
facts machine now especially now that he puts the background I know you're so stupid it's like a bulletin
like the drawing a arrow to it not read that cynnishman can't already shmithead
but anyway how many people do you think actually saw that to be less
yeah and thank god it started after the football and after 60 minutes which I got the audio
by the way about the appallanel stuff now that story should have made the front page of every
newspaper in America what page you think it was on in the uh in the sun sent it over the weekend
page 30 huh it was on page yeah you ready for that page eight from section though at least it
wasn't in the sports section page eight this is the yeah this is the bombshell man and that
book comes out tomorrow the book comes out tomorrow the name of which is let's see what is the name of
the book do you know what it is Bush is a demon evil liar Ron suss guy writes the name of the book
just a second it's called I don't know I'll be gosh damn because I didn't print out that story
well it's on our website about 800 different places but anyways by David suss guy and not David
Ron and Paul O'Neill the former treasury secretary tells it right like it is I like when he
refers to Bush during their meetings is like a blind man in a room full of death people no a lot
of death man in a room full of blind people or book take your pick blind man death people right
unbelievable there it is therefore they all they all had agreed about the Iraq business long
before even before they stole the election yeah and long before 9 11 and Bush kept saying well
you tell me how we're going to make this happen tell me how we're going to make this happen and I
have a letter which is on our no it's not on our website it was on Lynn Samuel's website thank you
Lynn a letter from some folks from an organization called the project for the new American century
better known as P-N-A-K who are they oh yeah bunch of assholes never heard of it a letter to Bill Clinton
honorable Bill Clinton and the date of it is January 26 1998 and some of these signees are people
like Bill Bennett and Richard Pearl who's a crazy person by the way needs to be in a straight
jacket like Sheridan on passions William Crystal Donald Rumsfeld at Paul Wolfowitz James Woolsey
and a bunch of other glam and wait till we get to that I mean how long can you be stupid you know
we read that article about the S word how long can the American public continue being stupid
oh that's right clearance was just in here before that should be a good answer to my question

I'll just play music all day serve him right I organized the CDs behind you you'll notice that
there are no empty gaps in all the music you see is Ralph at the time all the music all it hits all the
time yeah six carpenter CDs back there wow and none of them have the one song that I wanted
what was that for all we know yeah really I think that's the one yeah oh that's a very depressing
morbid song I would fit right in with this place today now what is that what was that was that his
cell phone going yeah yeah man if I could tell you how much I hate that every where you are you're
sitting there having dinner or whatever you might be at a ballgame you hear me I have all these
little tone going off and everybody with a cell phone and now that we got the fancy schmancy
cell phones that you can do everything with you can watch a porn oflix on it you can you can see
what your mother-of-the-law is doing you know with the with the postman all the other stuff you
just it's great it's like Alistair on passions you can watch it but everybody else in town is doing
so I'm just bringing the proceedings to a halt I'll give you the new poll that'll give you
something to do anyway because I do want to talk about that debate last night I'm sure some people
saw it the one in Iowa it was the brown and black debate I say because no we know that I've a lot
of minorities in Iowa and many in Vermont no I wouldn't I wouldn't get that carried away it's in
and Vermont maybe yeah so when Al Sharpton attacked Dean but the only problem with that is that
Dean now is like so much out of the defensive that he's losing it he is so so weak and so lame he's
just falling off but he's just falling off course and I can see it's slipping through his fingers
badly now what do you think if you're going to be in a debate on minority issues that you would know
that somebody was going to ask you about your record in Vermont were there any minority members
in your cabinet wouldn't it be likely one of the questions that somebody was going to ask you since
they're asking each other questions if they're trying to nail your ass to the wall of course it would
was he prepared to answer the question of course not but a beep but a boop but about fumbling and
bumping again with at the jaw that thing with his jaw what is that thing with his jaw I don't know
what are you talking about does he do it side to side like that like a fat jar or something he just
I don't know see I'm trying really hard to like him again which I always have like him in fact
that was one of the first ones to like him but he's starting to scare the crap out of me now
and the one that I do like a lot is Dennis Kassant have I been saying that consistently
he says he tells it like it is he's the one that brought up the thing about Paul O'Neal
and this book coming on the fact that O'Neal says that the Bush the Bushites had the
Iraq attack all set up long before 9-11 which is why they had to make up all these lies to
justify going in there and one of the things they want to know about is how we divvy up the oil
by the way I can't wait to get a hold of that book tomorrow what's it called something

any weapons inside spider hole spider hole that is where we found this troll raised his hands and
where himself very soon he will rock and help at last president bush is so glad because the
down this gone back down in spider hole 10 46 so anyway I started to bat last night like I started
to say about 45 minutes ago until we got everything working here and Howard Dean is imploding I know
that comes as bad news to you but the fact of the matter is he is imploding and after the after
the debate uh Chris Matthews and uh and uh what's his name lister hold oh we're talking to him
and they talk to some of the other people sharp in a few of the others and well when he asked him
that he's got all these pet answers like on three by five cards now and I guess because his
aides are so afraid that if he speaks spontaneously he's always going to blurt out something uh you know
and and then they'll make a big simmissabotter so he just gives pet answers to everything like well
you know another year the front runner and they're all attacking while there's only one front
runner and that's George Bush with his $210 million in campaign contributions and the
other dog here is the american public how many times do we hear him say that but third man the same
trite responses now what happened to the gutsy ballsy Howard Dean this is this is what happens when
the handlers get a hold of these guys and when they try to shut them up and not make any mistakes
when they try to play it safe like green baited yesterday play it safe and you want to blusing
I'm afraid he might turn out to be the green bay packers of politics oh yeah
what does that mean that means loser that's what it means lose blowing it blowing a lead
in other words about him trying to say as he wishes the Iowa caucus would have been about a
week ago but didn't happen this is a letter in fact it's going to be on our website I guarantee
that because I uh faxed it to Eric project for the new american century and the date of this letter
is January 26 1998 and the letter is written to this is from pinak to the honorable William J. Clinton
Bubba dear mr president dear Bubba we are writing you because we're convinced that current
american policy toward Iraq is not succeeding and that we may soon face a threat in the
middle east more serious than they we've known since the end of the cold war in your upcoming
state of the union address you have an opportunity to chart a clear and determined course
for meeting this threat we urge you to seize that opportunity and to announce you had a new
strategy that would secure the interest of the u.s. and our friends and allies around the world
this strategy should aim above all at the removal of sottom who saves
regime from power we stand ready to offer our full support and is difficult but necessary endeavor
keep in mind January 26 1998 the policy of containment of sottom who say has been steadily eroding
over the past several months as recent events are demonstrated we can no longer depend on our
partners in the Gulf War coalition to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish sottom when
he blocks your evade's with inspections our ability to ensure that sottom who say is not
producing weapons of mass destruction therefore has substantially diminished even if full
inspections were eventually to resume which now seems highly unlikely experience has shown
that it is difficult if not impossible the monitors Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
production the lengthy period during which the inspectors will have been unable to enter many
Iraqi facilities has made it even less likely they'll be able to uncover all of sottom secrets
as a result in the not too distant future will be unable to determine with any reasonable level
of confidence whether Iraq does or does not possess such weapons such uncertainty will by itself
have a seriously destabilizing effect on the entire Middle East it hardly needs to be added that
if sottom does not acquire the capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction as he's almost
certain to do if we continue along the present course the safety of American troops in the region
of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states and a significant portion of
the world's supply of oil will all be put at hazard as you have rightly declared Mr. President
the security of the world in the first part of the 21st century will be determined largely by how
we handle this threat given the magnitude of the threat the current policy which depends for its
success upon the steadfastness of our coalition partners and upon the cooperation of sottom who say
is dangerously inadequate the only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility
that Iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction in the near term
this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing in the long
term it means removing sottom who say in his regime from power that now needs to become the aim
of American foreign policy we urge you to articulate the same to turn your administration's attention
to implementing a strategy for removing sottom's regime from power this will require a full complement
of diplomatic political and military efforts although we're fully aware of the dangers and difficulties
in implementing this policy we believe the dangers of failing to do so are far greater we believe
the U.S. has the authority under existing UN resolution to take the necessary steps including
military steps to protect our vital interest in the Gulf in any case American policy cannot
continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council we urge
you to act decisively if you act now to end the threat of weapons of mass destruction against the
U.S. or its allies you'll be acting in the most fundamental national security interests of the
country if we accept the course of weakness and drift we put our interest in our future at risk
sincerely Elliott Abrams Richard Armageddon William J. Bennett Jeffrey Bergner a
bunch of other names William Crystal Richard Purl Donald Rumsfeld Paul Wolfowitz James Woolsey
in a bunch of other lunatics January 26 1998 and speaker of those weapons of mass destruction
right on the heels right on the heels of the announcement of Paul O'Neill's
damning condemnations of Bush and him letting all of this stuff out of the closet about the
Iraq attack all the Danish inspected there are friends the Danes Dana soldiers have uncovered
chemical weapons in Iraq and come to find out it's a bunch of 10-year-old canisters of mustard gas
that you couldn't kill a fruit fly with very deep underground and then they showed the pictures
the other day so they they Schmidt can't that pretty fast oh we got it oh we don't got it well
we thought we had it we got it and of course it wasn't us it wasn't the Americans they found it it
was the Danes we got it with the Danes because we know that if the Americans found it somebody
would have questioned well they planted it but the Danes found a bunch of old mustard gas canisters
leaking about as effective as farting in a windstorm yeah that would even that would be more
dangerous especially if Moe cut it so how do you like that so they tried to float that out there
that didn't work now the deal is well Paul O'Neill it's our grapes because he got fired and he's got
no credibility anyway we wouldn't listen to money with secretary treasury why would anybody
listen to him now right here is that letter I just read from PNAC the project for a new American
century there's enough evidence here in a court of law to impeach this whole bunch not just Bush
but this whole bunch of great robbers around him more your liberal lives they all had this plan
out like we told you before in the late 90s this was part of the game plan and the thing that
really I find very disturbing along with everything else if you read the stuff that he was saying
in those meetings he kept when he was being advised about Saddam Hussein and about the
Iraqi attack and all this other he kept saying well that's great but you've got to find me a
way to do this find me a way to do this in other words find a way that we can invade Iraq that will be
palatable and accepted by the American public and then along came 9-11 I'm not thinking any
suggestion you understand of course that but along came 9-11 how do you like that are you
suggesting and of course it wasn't the Iraqis it was our good Saudi friends who were all involved
in 15 out of the 19 anyway they're their family friends right that's right and you don't miss
with family now report blisters bushes handling of the terror war a scathing new report published
by the army war college broadly criticizes the bush of administration's handling of the war on
terrorism accusing it of taking a detour into an unnecessary war in Iraq and pursuing an
unrealistic quest against terrorism they may lead the US wars without wood states that pose no
serious threat and let me just interject that yesterday the crazy it asks lunatic Richard purls
on making the rounds and all the shows and he was under with wolf blitzkrieg going on about
Lebanon and about Syria and Iran if it's up to these people will be a war with the whole god damn
world right sounds like ww3 to me for fun and profit profit that's profit the report by visiting
professor Jeffrey record who was on the faculty of the air war college at Maxwell Air Force
base alabama warns that as a result of those mistakes the army is near the breaking point it
recommends among other things scaling back the scope of the global war on terrorism instead
focusing on the narrow threat posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist network what a concept
the global war on terrorism is as currently defined and waged as dangerously indiscriminate
and ambitious and accordingly its parameter should be read read adjusted record rights currently
he adds the anti terrorism campaign is strategically unfocused primer promises more than can
deliver in threatens to dissipate u.s military resources in the endless and hopeless search for
absolute security and don't forget of course about the man on the moon isn't that us and the trip
to Mars record of veteran defense specialist author of six books on military strategy and related
issues was an aid to former senator sam nun when the Georgia Democrat was chairman of the
senate armed services committee and discussing his political background record also noted that in
1999 while on the staff of the air war college he published work critical of the Clinton administration
and it goes on and on and on many of records arguments such as the contention that
Saddam Hussein's Iraq was deterred and didn't present a threat had been made before by critics of
the administration Iraqi concludes was a war of choice distraction from the war of necessity against
al-Qaeda but it's unusual to have such views published by the war college the army's premier
academic institution so now he's getting it from all sides of the bushmeister
so it's not you know i'm not sure about that
i'm really one votes on a poll regardless of which candidate you support which can contender
his best articulating your views they're all full of schmet 52 dean 40 i guess those people

oh that's right i forgot most of their lucky anyway the letter to president clinton on a rack
the one that i read from p-nack the project for the new american century by all these zineo cons it's
on a website right now nice going erick right under the right under the pool right under that little
red uh pink thing it says looking for past articles quick our news archives there it is right there
let it a president clinton on i rack anyway the name of the book is the price of loyalty
by ron susskind people it's your prize winner ah the appalemial revelations and i'll say it again it
wasn't just a bunch of stuff he made up he actually provided to a ron susskind thousands of pages
of documents including uh stuff from transcripts of meetings no yes no national security meetings all
of these things you dirty like he says that none of these meetings ever was there any evidence of any
weapons of mass destruction or any of these things or any of their allegations the lies that were
made to justify the irracate act i do you think that they get really bored if i played the
lesslie stall interview with uh polonial no year ago polonial was fired from his job as jord bush's
treasury secretary for disagreeing too many times with the president's policy on tax cuts tonight
o'neal who is known for speaking his mind talks for the first time about his two years inside the
bush administration his story is a centerpiece of a new book being published this week about the way
the bush white house is run entitled the price of loyalty the book by a former wall street journal
reporter draws on interviews with high level officials who gave the author their personal accounts
of meetings with the president their notes and documents but the main source of the book was polonial
polonial says he's going public because he thinks the bush administration has been too secretive
about how decisions have been made contrary to how we practice politics today in this country there is
some market for the truth somebody's going to call it a kiss and tell book i've come to believe that
people will say damn there anything so i'm sure somebody will say all of that and more
o'neal who was jord bush's top economic policy official says in the book that the president did not
make decisions in a methodical way there was no free flow of ideas or open debate at cabinet meetings
he says the president was like a blind man in a room full of deaf people there is no discernible
connection forcing top officials to act on little more than hunches about what the president might
think this is what o'neal says happened at his first hour long one-on-one meeting with mr. bush
i went in with a long list of things to talk about and i thought to engage on
and as the book says i was surprised that it turned out me talking and the president just listening
he never asked a single question yes i recall it was it was mostly a monologue
president bush was disengaged at least on domestic issues he says and that disturbed him
this is a photograph of president nicklant me there he told us that wasn't his experience when he
worked as a top official under president's nixon and forward or the way he ran things when he was
chairman of alkoa o'neal readily agreed to tell his story to the book's author ron suskind o'neal
says he's taking no money for his part in the book you interviewed how many other people
oh hundreds of people hundreds of people how many other cabinet members um several what should say
several but o'neal is the only one who spoke on the record didn't someone in this administration
hi up yeah call him on the phone and warn him not to do this book yes yes and who was it don runs
out was it a warning or a threat i don't think so i think it was the white house concerned
understandably because o'neal has spent extraordinary amounts of time with the president
they said this could really be the one moment where things are revealed
and they are not only did o'neal give suskind his time he gave him 19,000 internal documents
i mean everything's there member and to the president handwritten thank you notes
hundred page documents stuff that's sensitive stuff that's sensitive right yeah transcripts
of private meetings yeah in some case high level yep national security council you don't get
higher than that and what happened to president bush's very first national security council meeting
is one of o'neal's most startling revelations in the very beginning there was a conviction
that Saddam Hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go he says that going after Saddam Hussein
was topic a 10 days after the inauguration eight months before september 11th from the very first
instance it was about a rock it was about what we can do to change this regime now everybody else
thought that grew out of 9 11 no but this book says it was day one of this administer day one
these things were laid and sealed as treasury secretary o'neal was a permanent member of the
national security council he says in the book he was surprised at the meeting the questions such as
why Saddam and why now were never asked it's all about finding a way to do it that was the tone of
the president saying go find me a way to do this for me the notion of a preemption that the US has
the unilateral right to do whatever we decide to do is a is a really huge leap and that came up
on this first meeting okay o'neal told us the discussion of a rack continued at the next national
security council meeting two days later he got briefing materials under this cover sheet
there are memos one of them mark secret says plan for post Saddam or rack nation building
absolutely they discussed an occupation of a rock in January and February of 2001
based on his interviews with o'neal and several other officials at the meetings
susskind writes at the planning and vision peacekeeping troops war crimes tribunals and even
divvying up a racks oil wealth susskind obtained this Pentagon document dated March 5 2001
entitled foreign suitors for Iraqi oil field contracts it includes a map of potential areas for
exploration it talks about contractors around the world from you know 30 40 countries
and which ones have what intentions or on oil on oil in Iraq
during the campaign candidate bush had criticized the Clinton Gore administration for being
too interventionist if we don't stop extending our troops all around the world and nation building
missions then we're going to have a serious problem coming down the road and I'm going to prevent
the president had just run a campaign about being humble and not engaging in that and nation building
the thing that's most surprising I think is how infatically from the very first the
administration had said X during the campaign but from the first day was often doing why not
just saying why but actively moving toward the opposite of what they had said during the election
but the president had promised to cut taxes and he did within six months of taking office
he pushed a trillion dollars worth of tax cuts through congress this is significant
and this is only the beginning but O'Neal thought it should have been the end after 9-11
and the war in Afghanistan the budget deficit was growing so at a meeting with the vice president
after the midterm elections in 2002 suspect rights that O'Neal argued against a second round
of tax cuts chainy at this moment shows his hand he says you know Paul Reagan proved that deficits
don't matter we won the midterm elections this is our due we earned it exactly what is O'Neal
O'Neal is speechless it was not just about not winning a tax that way it was about how to use
the nation's resources to improve the condition of our society and I thought the weight of working
on social security and fundamental tax reform was a lot more important than a tax reduction
did you think it was irresponsible well it's for sure now what I would have done O'Neal
accuses vice president Dick Cheney of not being an honest broker but with a handful of others
part of a Praetorian Guard that encircled the president to block out contrary views O'Neal says
this is the way Dick likes it meanwhile the White House was losing patience with O'Neal
he was becoming known for a series of off-the-cuff remarks his critics called Gats
one of them sent the dollar into a nose dive and required major damage control twice during
stock market meltdowns O'Neal was not available to the president he was out of the country
one time on a trip to Africa with the Irish rock star Bono
Africa made an enormous splash it was like a road show he comes back and the president says to him
at a meeting so you know you're getting quite a cold following and it clearly was not a joke
and it was not said it was it was Saskein writes that the relationship grew more tense
and that the president took a jab at O'Neal in public at an economic forum in Texas
and I'm just honored to be sitting beside one of my heroes
who O'Neal
with fair one O'Neal
the two men were never close O'Neal was not amused when Mr. Bush began calling him the big O
he thought the president's habit of giving people nicknames was a form of bullying
everything came to a head for O'Neal at a November 2002 meeting at the White House
of the economic team well it's a huge meeting you got dick chaining from the you know secure
location on the video president is there Saskein who was given a nearly verbatim
transcript by someone who attended the meeting says everyone expected Mr. Bush to rubber stamp the
plan on a discussion a big new tax cut but according to Saskein the president was perhaps having
second thoughts about cutting taxes again and was uncharacteristically engaged
he asked um have we already given money to rich people the second tax cuts going to do it again
the president himself says but we already gave it to the rich people
yes why are we we already and why are we doing it again yes that's why are we doing it again
now as advisors they say well Mr. President uh the upper class they're the entrepreneurs
that's the standard response and the president kind of goes okay that's the response and then he
comes back to it again well shouldn't we be given money to the middle won't people be able to say
you did it once and then you did it twice and what was it good for but according to the transcript
white house political advisor Carl rove jumped in Carl rove is saying to the president a kind of mantra
stick to principle stick to principle he says it over and over again and he's saying stick and don't
waver don't waver in the end the president didn't and nine days after that meeting in which
O'Neal made it clear he could not publicly support another tax cut the vice president called
asked him to resign with the deficit now climbing toward four hundred billion dollars O'Neal maintains
he was in the right but look at the economy today can't the white house say look we were right no
Neil was wrong well uh in the last quarter the growth rate was 8.2 percent wow it was terrific
is it because of the tax cut I think the tax cut made a difference but without the tax cut we
would have had six percent real growth and the prospect of dealing with transformation of
social security and fundamentally fixing the tax system and to me those were compelling competitors
for against more tax cuts while in the book O'Neal comes off as constantly appalled at Mr. Bush
he was surprised when I told him I found his portrait of the president unflattering
you really think so are you joking no no I you know are you teasing me because I'm not a
I really jumps out well you're giving me the impression that you're just going to be stunned
if they attack you for this book and they're going to say I predict you know it's solid grapes
he's getting back because he was fired I will I will be a really disappointed that they
react that way because I think they'll be hard put to prepare for it well I don't think I need to
be because I I can't imagine that I'm going to be attacked for telling the truth why would I be
attacked for telling the truth right why would anybody be attacked for telling the truth that's
from a 60 minute CBS last night Leslie Stall what who's being naive now right hey
love him 15 at 560 W to QM hey if you're fat Katrina the lovely Katrina's lost 15 pounds when's

So anyway last night we discovered from all of the Democratic candidates all of these week need declounds.
That we're going to let everybody in all illegal aliens let them all pour in.
Give them all the right to vote.
Give them all a green card a 57 Chevy.
All of a sudden that joke.
Congratulations.
Right.
In a joke.
That's right.
No more because they're all a week named.
Except for Dennis Kassinich.
He's the only one with any balls at all.
273 votes on a poll regardless of which candidate you support.
Out of course Dean now the new line is well you know he was against the war from the beginning.
He was the only one who had the balls to stand up to Bush.
But now that we're there we're going to be there for years.
And he doesn't he doesn't refute that every time they throw that in his face.
He just but it will be doesn't refute it.
Whereas Kassinich says let's get the international peacekeeping force together.
Let's get those troops home and get them out of there right away as in like now.
To which we say by the way another dead American soldier while we were talking.
Yeah who's counting.
That's right.
That one website.
273 votes regardless of which candidate you support which contender is best articulating your views.
Well a lot of big words in there Neil.
Like is well like Bob was said it all depends on what is is.
Or whiz whiz or what what anyway they're all full.
And then we're going to get the first one.
And then we're going to get the first one.

And then they're looking at these new puzzles now,
customized version of how they play Christmas.
That only happens because I bet that the other primera participant obviously that should.
The other three of the players that play Christmas.
So repair.
drug people hey mark thanks for the good stuff but just calm down a little bit
okay it says this report now strangely forgotten confirms the bush he's
ready to grab 9-11 is a pretext for it re-invading Iraq within hours of the
attack they were just looking for any excuse to which you are absolutely
like I said keep the good stuff coming mark anyway Sunday Harold and Scotland
rights Bush-Planley-Rack regime changed before becoming president the whole
world is starting to catch on now huh how come we don't have the impeachment
hearings going on right away mean nobody got a blow job somewhere we got a
whole bunch of people got blown away but I guess that's a different story see
that's the the Neocons motto is blow jobs are bad but getting blown away
as well as somebody else away a secret blueprint for U.S. global
domination reveals that President Bush and his cabinet were planning a
premeditated attack on Iraq to secure regime change even before he took
power in January 2001 the blueprint uncovered by the Sunday
Harold for the creation of a global Pax Americana was drawn up by Dick Cheney
Donald Rumsfeld Paul Wolfowitz George W. Bush's younger brother Jeb and
Lewis Libby Cheney's chief of staff the document entitled rebuilding America's
defense strategies forces and resources for a new century was written in
September 2000 by the Neocon think tank project for the new American century
Penaq the plan shows Bush's cabinet intended to take military control of the
Gulf region whether or not Sodom Hussein was in power it says the United
States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional
security while the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate
justification the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf
France sends the issue of the regime of Sodom Hussein the Penaq document
supports a blueprint for maintaining global U.S. preeminence
precluding the rise of a greater power rival and shaping the international
security order in line with American principles and interests this American
grand strategy must be advanced for as far into the future as possible the
port says it also calls for the west to fight and decisively win multiple
simultaneous major theater wars as a core mission so that's why a pro was on
yesterday talking about Lebanon and Syria and Iran and maybe a Haiti too I
read it to say what they're a state of it or he's our he's our butcher don't
go to Haiti by the way folks they're doing they're doing the old Mexican thing
now no serious that there is just about to go they're abducting people and
they're like you know kidnapping and butchering and robbing and mutilating and
all those nice things tourists maybe that's why the people in the streets are
like a little revolting tourists going to Haiti ever met any revolting
Haitians the report describes American armed forces abroad is the cavalry on
the new American frontier the Penaq blueprint supports an earlier document
written by Wolfowitz and Liby that said the U.S. must discourage advanced
industrial relations from challenging our leadership or even aspiring to a
larger regional or global role the Penaq report also refers to key allies
such as the UK as the most effective and efficient means of exercising
American global leadership in other words they can be our pawn yeah especially
since Prince Charlie's like bending down and dropping a soap all the time
describes peacekeeping missions as demanding American political leadership
rather than that of the UN reveals worries the administration that Europe could
rival the USA says even should Sodom pass from the scene bases in Saudi
Arabian Kuwait will remain permanently despite the domestic opposition in the
Gulf regime to the stationing of U.S. troops as Iran may well prove as large
a threat to US interest as Iraq has spotlights China for regime change saying it
is time to increase the presence of American forces in Southeast Asia this
it says may lead to American and allied power providing the spur to the
process of democratization in China calls for the creation of U.S.
space forces to dominate space and the total control of cyber space to
prevent enemies using the internet against the U.S.
Hence that despite threatening war against the Black for developing weapons of
mass destruction the U.S. may consider developing biological weapons which
the nation is banned for decades to come it says new methods of attack
electronic non-lethal biological be more widely available combat likely will
take places in new dimensions in space cyber space and perhaps the world of
microbes advance forms of biological warfare that can target specific geotypes
may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically
useful tool like all universal South area fags liberals Jews
far too
and pinpoint North Korea Libya Syria they ran did I just got through saying that
I left out North Korea mods obvious as dangerous regimes and said the
resistance justified the creation of a worldwide command and control system
Tom Daliel the labor MP rather the House of Commons want the leading rebel voices
against the war with Iraq said this is garbage from right wing think take
stuff with chickenoffs men who've never seen the horror of war but are in love
with the idea of war men like Cheney who were dragged on just in the Vietnam war
this is a blueprint for U.S. world domination a new world order of their making
these are the thought processes of fantastic fantasist Americans who out of control
the world I'm appalled that a British labor prime minister should have gotten
into bed with a crew which has this moral standing he said
I just mentioned that in passing from Sunday Scotland Sunday hero out of
touch liberal okay

I'll make over, you don't think? I don't know what you mean
There's something like a fag jaw, either something, they just showed him on again
I was sharp in ripping him and I asked about how many of minorities does he have in his cabinet when he was governor for one five times
He went by the beat but it booted by a nun, they do have a thing for that actually
Do they?
Like Lyple Sucked in
Well let's do it, let's do it before it's too late man, or before they have another debate god forbid

He was great last night, in fact the audience gave him several ovation
I mean you know they were doing little applauding for the other ones but boy, every time he finished speaking with an answer or his closing statement
It was great, I still wanna know who that Mexican bimbo or Puerto Rican bimbo was, it was on her last night that Chiquita Banana Bitch
You have never, she made Celia Cruz seem coherent
That's how bad she was, she was ridiculous
She was a worse stereotype, I mean if Hispanic America came to better than that and putting a moderator in there and good luck to you
Who could we have put in there?
Even what's your name that does the talk show what the hell is her name?
Christina, Christina would have been out there
Huge improvement, she's articulate
She would have just read the questions of three by five cards instead of trying to interject all of this crap about
But you know Puerto Ricans, a lot of the Puerto Ricans sign up for the military because they wanna help the U.S.
You know, which they're all citizens anyway so what would that have to do with the question?
Nothing, but she must have said that many times
Because at least maybe she's running too, I don't know
She's probably got one of those flags from her hanging from her review mirror
Oh yeah, one of them recon flags
Don't start picking on her weekends again man
Why not? Because they'll cut you off
They'll talk to her Jamaican brandy up
They'll cut you up and then they'll cut you off

So we gotta get a next job for Howard Dean
And a win for Kucinich
What about his teeth?
There's nothing wrong with it
I don't ever look at his teeth
Because I'm too transfixed on a herpes
I never looked down at it
They can't be real, those have to be dentures
Plus he stands on four phone books to get on at podium too
He's great though
See, the base ought to be on radio
Right, not on television
That's that Nixon-Kedity thing over there
He's not made for TV at all

Absolutely
Okay, thanks a lot of time
So I said there's a couple of people saw the debate
I bet you saw it
They could found MSNBC, it's channel 622 by the way, most of your cable systems
They keep trying to shove it off the edge of the dial
Because nobody watches it
I bet you don't have that I'm just so boring thing in here do you know
No, because you didn't bring it till now
Till now, always you think it's in one of these
Oh, I hope
That goes back aways
Oh, I don't think it's on any of these
I never got it in here, it's never been in here
It hasn't, you discovered that up there somehow
Oh, but I've been playing that for months

My life is local
Here's sports radio 560, she went U-A-S
That, yes
Am I sorry I spoke out?
No
Am I sorry that I asked questions and that I don't just follow?
No
To announce that there must be no criticism of the president
Or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong
It's not only unpatriotic and survival
But is morally treasonable to the American public
We kicked off our tour and sold our shows
People were going insane
Then I opened my mouth and now the whole world knows
That the chunky one is lacking a brain
I thought that just because I know how to sing
I also have something to say
I opened up my trap and it was full of crap
The dicks, the chicks are gonna pay
Well, it didn't take long
Everyone I said our fans began throwing fits
If stations are playing and fans are paying
I'll be in strip shows when my tits are all right
I thought that I was born old
It's too fit to get fun
I never should have put push down
Myself, the steam was dropping
So I grabbed a pack of tankies
And I gained another 15 pounds
I run just a musician
That a real politician
My opinion doesn't matter at all
I know I'm a cream
And I got us in deep
And I career's all taking our fall
You're wondering why
You'll be in a big family long girl
I know my knees
I'm never playing girls
I'll never speak
You're a perfect girl
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm just a long girl
I'd like to say I learned to think before I talk
You're with us or against us
That's not true
That's not true
14 to no yes it is
Talk Show Host and Phoenix Found out
It was two that's the reason I played there
Charles Goyette was named the best talk show host of 2003
by the Phoenix New Times
And guess what Clear out channel did to him
I don't know if I heard him
They shoveled him off while he didn't fire him yet
But they will soon
They shoveled him off like to three to four in the morning
You know what you do with people who are not light
You shovel him off into the wee hours of the morning
You know what I mean
Absolutely right
Anyway, and you know why they did it?
I give up
And this article by the way is from the American Conservative
Papu Canans magazine
Right, a real conservative magazine
Which is right online
With what they ought to be
Clear channel, a gagged and anti-war conservative
Because he was against the war
Conservative guy
I'm not going to read a whole article
It's very long
But it says Clear channel made it clear with you
I feel like I'm managing the Dixie chicks
And they said my program director
And they would like to fire me anyway
While a well-drafted contract made that difficult
It didn't prevent them from tucking me away outside prime time
Stickin' more nobody would hear him in his contract
It's going to be a very shortly
And they'll say
Bye-bye!
That's cheap channel for you baby
Because that's the new American FN way
You either go step in line with a party line
Or you're off the air
That's what it boils down to
That's why some people we know
Are you sure are like go step in themselves
People that we would have thought
Would have been a little bit to the left of it till the dawn
But now all of a sudden are operating that party line
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah but wait a second
Yeah wait on this
The article by Neil McCabe bush planned the rack regime change before becoming president
That's on there
You ready for that?
I'm ready
Eric is really doing it
So we got the letter from Pnec to Bill Clinton
And that article as well
I mean there's a mountain of evidence here in a public is going
Like that
And the Democrats most of them are going
Like that
Last night in that presidential debate the black and brown debate in Iowa
The one candidate who had the balls and they wisdom to open up his mouth about the polo
Neal statements in that new book
I mean I was just called the price of loyalty
Was Dennis Kassinich
He was screaming about it
He said we all ought to be talking about that
And they ought to be instead of ripping each other up
Instead of all this you know who can piss on each other the best
Instead of that what they ought to be doing is ripping bush and ass all of them
But the Democrats have this death wish they have this collective death wish
And it's just astonishing to me
Why aren't they calling for his resignation or impeachment right now?
Who?
Them Democrats
The so-called loyal opposition
Oh they don't want to look bad
Oh I see
Dennis Kassinich how her dean didn't bring it up
Julie women who courses nothing but an appeaser and a war monger
He sure is how they're repulsed up
Right and a Republican dressed in drag with the armaka and the citizens
And to fill in
Yeah they offered him some dessert after that big dinner they had in Washington
He said that's to fill in
364 plus it was trough
364 votes on a pool
Regardless of which candidate you support
Which contender is best articulating your views
Do you understand that question?
No
You get it
No
You care?
Oh I know that
They're all full of Schmidt 125
I mean that thing about immigration is so pathetic
Yeah
Illegal aliens we've got millions of illegal aliens pouring across the borders
Mostly in the southwest
From Mexico and they're not all Mexicans either they come up from all over Latin America
And they pour in through that poorest Mexican border and they just pour in
Right
And now the new deal is and of course bush being desperate to pander to Mexicans to Hispanic voters
Comes up with his cock and maybe deal which is never going to go through Congress by the way
His own his own Republican party like Dave sure with that it's still just another kiss for big business
Right agriculture
Right more cheap labor but more more over than that and attempt to say oh you see we want all you people to come on
And we want to give you all these rights we want to give you a green card and a blue card and a purple card
And a driver's license
Why should illegal aliens have driver's license?
They shouldn't they shouldn't be here
Why should most of the abandoned people will come in here on rubber rafts
Why should they have driver's license at a 57 Chevy?
They shouldn't
They shouldn't be doing on air last night seriously if she is honestly I
I wish you would have seen it I just would have given anything if you could see it
You would be so amazed I'm not exaggerating she was like chowro
I don't want anything to a word my love her presentation was like
Chowro
I'm surprised she didn't say
Kuchi Kuchi
Yeah
I think she poked Al Sharpton in the puppet she thought it was a dark pills braid doughboy
Kuchi Kuchi
She was pathetic
And plus of course a professional Puerto Rican I mean just on and on about the Puerto Ricans are doing this
Well fine okay they got all the rights
Yeah
Driver's license
Sure they can vote
58 Chevy switchblade I mean what's all more do you need?
Upcaps
Right
567 0560 pound 560 on EAT&T

WQIM
Good morning
Wayne Estella
Wayne Estonia
Puerto Rican cuisine I think that's over by the community society anyway
No that's Chinese cuisine
That lady of the illiterate one who's on the debate
Yes
She works her telemundo and she even minds who owns telemundo NBC
Which is nothing but clear channel with pictures
Right so they had Lester Hold on there from MSNBC with the MS and they had her on there from a telemundo
Yes
Lester Hold with the stiff upper lip because you must have rubbed by agronidors
No no no no
He was still
But it's just like and you know why is this is being carried
Well I don't know why she was there because so I thought I checked there
There can't be more than like 20 Hispanics in Iowa you know what I mean
Doctor to man
Okay what that was that I think that was a CIA 10
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Horizon Wireless Line
We're off to the races here baby we're doing it
Are we doing it?
No
I feel like we're doing it
Doing something
Yeah
Killing some good time
Don't forget that book to price a loyalty
Don't let me forget I gotta go out and get it tomorrow by Ron Suskine
All right
People it's a prize winning author
He's damn good
He was the one whose voice you heard along there with Paul O'Neal and Leslie Astal
And at 60 minutes piece from last night which will play it again and again and again
See how I see if I really thought that anybody cared about that and that they were you know
That it didn't be good that I'd really be excited although I know better
I've learned but it killed some good time
WQA am hello
I nailed it
Do I eat four a week in total?
WQA am hello
Lock it in
What was it?
Lock it in
Oh lock it in
Hey don't you remember that?
That's an old IOD thing
No I don't
That was jazz mk I see
WQA am hello
Yeah so much to talk about
I saw that debate last night
Yes
And there's so much to say
Go right ahead take your time
Okay it won't be as good as the last call but give it a shot
We're all gonna give my best shot
It's too bad that we can't go with who says the best and who instead of who's the most electable
I think who's the best
Well my question wasn't who's the most electable
I know
I know but it's too bad I mean when it comes to the election itself that we can't vote for who says the best
And that's the most electable
I mean I read this point of view
You like to vote?
You're not electable
But I'm disappointed with Dean
Yeah
In the more I see a
See this audience doesn't want to say that I mean it can pour in all the votes they want
And I have no problem with that other than the fact that he's just losing it now
All these strategists are turning him into a quizzling now in a week need weakling
And he just kind of stands there in a hams and hams
And it's like he doesn't want to say anything and he's afraid to really speak
And it comes up with all the trite cliches about the American people are the underdog
And I mean we've heard all of that before answer the question
Oh and then on other thing he did last night which I haven't even mentioned yet
There was that part of the debate several times during the debate and I do like that where there are a lot to ask
One of the other candidates a question
And instead of asking the other candidate he had some stooly some pigeon in the audience
Some minority guy that he was going to ask a question in the color
And then please tell us about this
And then the lester Holt is credited
But we can't do that governor because the candidates have all agreed to the rules
And we can't go out of the audience to ask people
You've got to ask the other candidates a question or take a pass and go out of the
He said oh I guess then I'll pass
I mean totally unprepared what is that
He's coming across as being stupid
Right he makes himself look bad which is exactly what they want
And the other thing is and then they start you know when they start you know going after each other
And I can't believe that Braun basically told Sharpton to shut up about playing the race car
Yeah if she was good
She was good but you know again she's not like the boy is not going to happen
No you know it's just so disappointing
But when you think that in a debate that Braun and Black caucus you know what the nature of most of the questions
You know they're going to be asking you about what you did as governor of remand and who was on your staff and in your cabinet
And how can you be that unprepared
Absolutely
His handlers are more concerned about shutting him up than really preparing him to answer the questions
And showing the kind of dean that we saw a few weeks and months ago
I'm hoping that the real thing that comes across with dean's campaign is that it energizes enough people to pay attention
They get out there and vote for somebody other than Bush
Yeah you know and the other thing and then I'll go
The other thing is on your website I think it's interesting that two of the articles are most thinking about Bush
And how they created Iraq were written by Republican Paul Neal and Kevin Phillips
And then these are not left winging
And either as Pat Buchanan
Yeah
But you're not going to hear the right side saying about these three guys
They're going to probably be quiet about them
And they say oh it's still a little bit of liberal media
And they better take care of Neal and they better ignore Bush if you can
And they'll all push him to the side
Pretty sad
Hang in there, Palley
Yeah I'm moving to Canada
See you at the border man
Bye
Yeah we'll smuggle them in
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Fine Line
How do my good friends at here at Canada
Well I tell you it was a nice command performance coming down yesterday morning
Three people in business class on my flight
Two flight attendants going to the next job
Yeah sound asleep and me in the front row
And I was it
Excellent
Back at a plane with all the peasants
You know that was pretty well loaded
Were they hot? The flight attendants?
No, they weren't even lukewarm
But at any rate
Three minutes till noon at 5, 60 WQ
In fact they were about as hot as it's been in Toronto last a weekend
Wow, man oh, man oh, man
I've experienced cold in my life
East Lansing Michigan Detroit
Rottenchester
I thought I'd experienced it all but Friday
When they came on the news and they said it's actually colder in Toronto right now than it is on Mars
Yeah
They were serious they said the temperature on the surface temperature Mars is 15 below 0 Fahrenheit
And it was 18 below Fahrenheit in Toronto
It was 35 below 0 Celsius
Sounds like move to Mars
No it sounds like you wouldn't get a couple of good toot time to me
It's toot time
Which you always think it's toot time but in Canada it's toot can toot time
I've toot while we're in it's like
Or like clearance toot can toot
Three minutes till noon at 5, 60 WQM

Thank you for coming
Full of crap asshole
Thank you once again the fans who are deeply petrified lover
Thank you very much
You're welcome
Anyway here's a couple of facts as they came in that's something
All of us on all of these Latoya and this one are all coming up because they want to
They don't want to lose that gravy train of course Michael says he's never going back to Neverland
Because they cleaned out little boys out
So we rented he rented another gym
You see that other mansion he rented right he only rented it on a you know
That's just a dollar house
No it's not my home
Option to buy
We know where the big house is and that's going to be his home
Yeah all only wait
Can you imagine?
Wow
He's going to be the soap boy
This will be get father degan's old roommate
And would that be something I think when you wear them silver gloves like that you keep dropping the soap all the time is what I hear
I have people who know
Is someone says this facts is someone stupid enough to think that the war in Iraq was about anything other than oil and world domination
Yes it's called Americans
If someone actually shocked that Bush had a plan to invade Iraq before he was elected
Yes it's called Americans
It says he even had a plan to win the election because he wasn't voted in his brother just so happy to be the governor of that state
And also a member of P-NAC that had a ballot problem as notorious for bogus elections
Yes
The answer is obviously for both questions
Are most people stupid and gullible?
Yes it says especially Americans
Yes
It says I don't want Bush to win Neil God forbid but the stupid people in this country will probably elect him again
Yes
Yeah he ought to be impeached right now but instead he's probably going to get in and again because the Democrats are too busy chopping each other up into smithereens and rule pieces
See the whole system is sorry it's like the electoral college how ridiculous that is
And this thing with the caucuses and the primers who that hell gives a flying fugue about New Hampshire and Iowa
Huh?
What are they representative of anything?
No
No
New Hampshire is about to balloon those right wing assholes and the Iowa is what did I say?
No I was just saying New Hampshire
Oh New Hampshire
Yeah
And Iowa is a corn country man they're busy cornhole with each other but that's all that's all about right
How do you think they get the corn off the cob man?
Sure it's special
Yeah that's right got like its own gravy on it
Oh shucks
Yeah it's own special gravy special sauce makes it's own sauce
Oh God
Anyway here's another fact that said oh this is great
I'm I'm would be amazed
Well he's he we only hear you'll see he's a little bit emotional
I'd be amazed if the Southwest has more illegal aliens than North Broward County
Dear Field Beachers the new Brazilian frontier with these stayovers

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and teen Verizon wireless I talk about it guys live it in the past
WDQ way him hello
Neil yes sir
Hey I'm looking at an article here on slate.msn.com
Yes
And it's going into how Bush has turned to Social Security trust fund into his own personal ward chest
And basically how they have no plans on replacing the money that they've taken
And basically George and I will have to join the homeless voice over there on a polywood board
Oh good we got it out for the rig and I so aren't sure ready for any no problem
Exactly
Hey my opinion of Dean is definitely becoming more and more different franchise with him
Disenchanted
That too
What is your I know your opinion on this image but what is your opinion on Edwards
Oh my God Juleen Yahoo
Well
But Juleen Yahoo man
Okay
Yahoo
Okay
That's my opinion you ask me about it and then one of my thing I think you like the way he looks
Do you want to do him is that it?
Well and the other thing I want to do him
You like to crawl right up above behind him and sneak right in there
Well the other thing I don't like it
The one to mention is
Art Bell was actually ripping
Oh okay see ya
Fine I don't talk to art bell people okay
The only art bell person I'll talk to his sons
Does he listen to Art Bell?
Oh I don't know
Yeah
I guess somebody's got to and you know who else used to listen to art bell
Yeah I know
What do we got it what is that under there?
I put it in on the hotkey I don't know if it's in there
It's on a hotkey on my bank
Ah on your bank
Be an herb boy I don't have time to dick around with that
Hey be an herb boy
I get out of here
So I'll see you then right now
Yeah
The poll question is did Paul O'Neal be true the president
Oh my God
I'm not talking about a slanted answer question
How do you believe what he said is about did he be treated president?
Is that on their website?
That's on the MSNBC
Oh on MSNBC's question
Oh there's cabinet
That was black or lots of gold brown
We had a senior member of my staff on my fifth floor
No we did not
That was just part of their exchange last night
And our new poll out today shows a statistical dead heat for the Iowa caucus
How are Dean Topp today's MSNBC
Reuters Zogby Poll with 26%
Congressman Richard Gephard is in second place with 23%
They are statistically tied
Because of the margin of error of course
Senator John Kerry has 16%
Senator John Edwards 12%
Here's a telling number 14% of Iowa's have not yet dissapeared
You see I know it makes a lot too much sense
But the idea of a national primary
When all the states vote on the same day
People with brains
Who are you suggesting that for a long time?
What are you saying?
You see and then that way you don't have to raise millions
You see like now is it endurance contest
And people that can't raise enough money to keep participating and competing
They fall by the wayside
It happens every four years
But if you had a national primary
You have a certain like a January and February
Whatever the period of time is that a window where people campaign
They have a little bit of number of debates
And then there's a national primary on one day
And voila as opposed to wow you got to win an Iowa
New Hampshire South Carolina
Talk about a bunch of drooling Yahoo's
You're talking crazy talk
Oh I know because it makes too much sense
Because the American whole political system is a piece of crap
It's a joke
If we didn't have that freaking electoral college
We wouldn't be going through this right now
Because the hell of a lot harder
Unless you know the people that die bold
You put a lot harder to see all the way under vote
Unless you know the people that die bold
You asked to push for airlines for passenger records
Despite stiff resistance from airlines and privacy advocates
The US government plans to push ahead this year with a vast computer-wide system
The probe the backgrounds of all passengers
Boarding flights in the United States
You ready for that?
Okay
That's right when you pay it says on here
Wherever fax this it says
Now when you pass through the airport they'll know you're gay
Oh wait till you see I'm gonna start swishing real good
So they have to check the records
Where pink panties
Oh I'll wear pink panties in a whole outfit
I'll dress up
I wear my current Miranda bananas on my head
I know you can borrow some clothes from
Not freaky carloas
The government will compel airlines in here
How about the clearance?
He's got quite an outfit
That's what I'm here and that's what mode told me this morning
Stuck referring to our programming department
He said the clearance likes to dress up before we let them stick it in there
I don't know what he was talking about
The government will compel airlines and airline reservation companies
To hand over all passenger records for scrutiny by US officials
After failing to see the reason that clearance loves to have me here so much
Because he knows that when I'm not here this place is his boringest dog crap
That's the reason that they're all so crazy to have me here
Because I bring a spark of life into this place
Well we can have some excitement in the morning
What is that?
What is that going to happen?
Well with the firings and what nots
Oh you mean like that?
I'm going to kick his ass and then I'll steal his two pants
Yeah we had that excitement
And maybe I guess they thought it was a little bit too exciting
By the way, Ferrell's got the bad flu
He's got a real bad case
Yeah we'll keep them posted with what's going on
Is he still on there with a mad cow?
A birdie cow
He's still got his man cow disease in Chicago
And he's working on that show
I don't know what the deal's going to be with him
He needs a spanking
Is what he needs
I'm sure he'd go for that
Not by me
Oh
No he needs 34C or somebody to put them over their knee
And just give him an old-fashioned spanking like a child
And just straighten his ass out
If he just tone it down a little bit
That's all
Just a wee little bit
Just calm it down man
A wee wee
A wee ton that wee wee down
It's a lot of the past noon

O-N-P-A-Y-S-U-C-A-S
Come by some afternoon
He's got this place for you
One thing you might remove
The ash cast the gash discovering you
One mouth to every scary angel
His face like a bonsulin
One pair of moonwalk blades
A wonderring tongue
Chess
Besides the white blood he's making
Chess if he takes you under
His blankets take his nose a plastic
And break it might know
You'll just found to be a lost survive
When your body is a neverland
Watch for his hands
When your body is a neverland
So never twisted about that
Don't let me figure out my next break to check the AHSNBC website
Because we were taking that pool online
And we really interested to see what the responses about polo-nil
I mean to word the pool I weigh it so obviously
The real question should be plain and simple
Do you believe polo-nil's allegations about the administration no one
Jerry Brown was in it and Shirley Black
Temple
I'm sure we temple black
Sure, yeah
Anyway they're all full of Schmidt 148 you say that
And I can't debate with that too much
Boy it's so sad
Especially when you get to the immigration thing and they're all like pandering and bending over backward
They have four chiropractors there to straighten them out after that question
After Chequita Banana can't push that thing about the weekends
Dean 78, Clark 54, Cousinets 48, he's doing well and you know he should
Probably just because I said that but if they saw it they I mean he's he's great
He's not good he's great he's got balls
He's a little guy with big balls like Tom Denenberg
Or Tom Denenberg it weren't for a cheap channel no more do you know that?
Yes I did. Are you told me that?
Well I was here when you got it. I scored Tommy
Cousinets 49 now he's moving up
He's given West Clarker one for his money for a second
I wish he was doing as well in the in the voting polls as he is on this pool
Bush 29 sharped in 24 Edwards 22 carry 15
Mostly bronze got seven Jewelie, Roman six and Dick Edwards only got four
He has his pasty and boring man
Wow as a leprechaun
And he said yeah
Paste the old Irishman man he is so bland
No you know I see at least Howard Dean when he had the veins popping out of his neck
And he was excited and animated and really rip it as
That's the Howard Dean we knew and love that's when we got excited about him
He needs to stop listening to those people. Yeah he needs to stop listening because they'll do the same thing that Gora's advisors did to him
And he kept reinventing him and reinventing him yesterday's Al Gore next week's Al Gore you know
The more animated Al Gore Al Gore with the beard the fat Al Gore the not so fat Al Gore
Of course the one thing and all we would be stiff boring Al Gore that never changed
Anyway getting back to this airline thing wait till you hear this
See there's a part of it I like
So I read you the part I like okay
Another program that's being produced this year seeks to speed frequent flyers through security lines in exchange for volunteering personal information for the government
So like when I go through they'll say well are you a fag and I'll say and then they'll say oh okay
Yeah
No seriously they've been talking about doing that then they won't have to waste the time with all of us you know
Right and you get your head tattooed forehead tattooed
No problem
The government will compel airlines in there will compel the spirit of Christ will compel you
And if that don't do it we have a
The government will compel our lines and airline reservation companies to hand over all passenger records for scrutiny by US officials
After failing to win cooperation in the tent programs testing phase the order could be issued as soon as next month under the system
All travelers passing through a US airport ought to be scored with a number
Like you said a tattoo and a color that ranks their perceived threat to the aircraft
The tuna when a ship is vlogment a system introduced last week to fingerprint and photograph millions of foreign visitors on arrival in the US
Privacy and consumer advocates worry that both programs could be discriminatory because they subject airline passengers to different levels of scrutiny
Certain travelers such as non-US citizens could face additional questioning other than other than the program known as CAPS2
CAPS2 or the second version of the computer assisted passenger pre-screening program some organizations say
Business travelers who typically pay high price for their seats will likely get an easier pass to security in the registered traveler program
The two now listen to this is if we're not confused enough with the color code with everything else orange light yellow light
The two step process will result in a numerical and color score for each passenger a red rating means a passenger will be prohibited from boarding
Yellow indicates the passenger will receive additional scrutiny at the checkpoint a green rating paved way for standard trip to security and a pink rating means you'll be traveling in the rear
Also fact in the one scroll be intelligence about certain routes and airports where there might be higher rated risk to security
Although it's unclear how many passengers within in each category the TSA said its best estimation is that 5% of the traveling public will be flagged yellow or red compared with an estimated 15% who are flagged on the current version of CAPS1
The registered traveler program also known as the trusted traveler that's me has been a favor to the airline industry since the terrorist attack well when are they going to start it already
The first leader of the TSA to kind of pursue the idea saying he worried that terrorists and sleepers cells could establish themselves as trusted residents over period years and later export their status to hijacked planes yet a good point
Yeah
Because they stay for those sleepers cells for a long time right they'll stay long enough and then the fly and then they'll give you a big smile
Hey everything's wonderful you're a good to go right ahead sir go ahead and by the way don't drop don't forget to bomb yeah well he's a trusted frequent traveler friend is a good guy carry on bomber you know he's safe he's a Saudi Arabian
Oh 5 6 7 0 5 60 pile let's get these phones go on baby let's get some action here man I want to see a little bit action and this otherwise got for second dead as town man how about those panthers or I forgot to mention that
Panthers send another whole bunch of free tickets just because they're so excited that they're doing so well another tie they blew two nothing lead in the third period in Vancouver last night
Two to tie they were there to two so here's a bunch more free tickets for the Montreal game on February 10th
And that pathetic getting a letter about all their more exciting now and Rick Dudley is doing this and Steve let's see if he's doing that to whatever's name is
What's his name?
I don't know what's his name 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T Steve Rimmer that's the guy WQAM hello Neil yes sir my name is Doug I'm calling from Boca yes Doug what up what up listen my problem with this administration is when bush gets on them TV and says
Oh yeah palies WQAM hello
I have a question for Neil speaking oh my we're doing screenless all this year sir I'm sorry I just wanted to remind you I don't know if you're calling that but the senior bush
You don't actually invaded Panama for no good right that's right what you're wondering you wanted to get in the rig and change the
Compression of the country do you remember what is a huge west for doing that no I don't well you know he had told the generals under no
Diego that if you captured no yaga will come and take him off your hands right so they did that and somehow rather it did happen and those guys that took
No yaga were some early execute by now let me ask you this question how's Aris De doing down here in Haiti is he got all
In Liberty is going on I don't know anything about Haiti oh good don't go there trying on your laugh and I'm telling you don't go there it's
I have no intention even worse right now than it has been they may he makes baby doc and pop a doc look like good Samarins
Well to finish what I was that telling you bush was so embarrassed by what happened yeah that he was waiting for an excuse in one night
Four GI's were returning from having dinner in Panama. I may inadvertently took a road that took him right in front of the National Guard headquarters
Where there is a checkpoint right at all cars have to stop there and when it came their time to stop of course the National Guard has been
So I can also place on their car and started giving them a bad time. Mm-hmm driver panics and takes off and the National Guard must start shooting at the car
And they killed one of the Americans in the back seat. That was it that was Mr. Bush's excuse to go after Panama a country that has practically no military force
Well here I hear that this weekend if things start turning south in Iraq and we're going back to Grenade and finish the job. Well wouldn't that happen here?
And then the Brits have simultaneously are going to go back to Las Melvinas and finish them off.
Have a great day pal. All right. The world loves this baby. Don't they? No. They love American. No. In fact any place if you're going to do any traveling just say hey how's it going?
Hey, seriously I'm telling you works like a gentleman. Oh, where are you from? Oh Canada. Oh hey, how's it going?
Hey, I'm a boot. We love North America. Sure and where you're to go. Okay. We sure were one of the city tooks and act like the Hansons. You know act like a real silly goose works like like crazy.
5 6 7 0 5 6 these are some some anemory tunes. You know they love it. Come to QA. I'm hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. Did you notice yesterday how the right wingers spent the whole day trying to discredit Paul O'Neal?
Of course. Well, what do you expect them to do? Say oh gee. He's got a point. Yeah, but doesn't that stick with what they always do if you disagree with them?
But they are and that's politics man. That's what everybody does. Yeah. And how about?
And of course in this administration there's no room for dissent. The set is dead in America. Yeah. Yeah. How about the woman? How about the woman?
How about the part where he says George W. George W. In the cabinet meetings was like a deaf.

But I'll never play it again. Okay. Play it again. Okay. I love you. Thanks. I don't want to play the whole thing. Do I?
Well, you may not want to. No, I'm not going to play the whole thing again. But why see? I went all the way back to the beginning. I'm like a set.
President, there are notes and documents. But the main source of the book was Paul O'Neal. See there he is again. Paul O'Neal. I thought he played for who's he played for Carolina?
Yeah. Coalition to tip the hercune. He's a kind of tip O'Neal. He used to carry his booze. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, big job. I had the heavy load man. Really heavy load truck. Just like Moe had a heavy load in his bag.
465 votes. Dean, you know, this deal with the Daniel. Like I said, we all are hoping that we're pulling for him. You know, like you're sitting back. Come on. Go. You go, boy. Come on.
The butcher up a little bit. Let's see the old Howard Dean. Not the new manufactured Wimpy. You're in the more cautious and tripping over his tongue. Now, we're Dean. He I just I don't know.
I mean, could we have been wrong all this time? Could he be if just possible? It is possible. I'm glad you said that. Sure.
I know we got a lot of people in the audience who think they were going to like put Dean over the top. I don't know. It's also possible. I'm listening to people.
Again. That's what I'm saying. Cause that's we they've been talking about that. That's the new tactic. Cause every time he opened his mouth there for a couple of weeks, since they're all out to get him. They're ganging up on him like gangbusters.
And every time he says anything, but I'm being out of gotcha. And he says, Oh, we got to stop playing this game of gotcha.
And then he goes to that jerk the head of the Democratic Party. What else is named that idiot? You know, no, there you go.
He goes to Heinrich Himmler. He says, you know, go quit having them pick on me so much. You know, tell him to ease off a little bit. Terri McCollough. I jackass.
Then he used to play for the Tigers. Oh, that was Dick McCollough. Scotty McCollough. I forgot about Dick 28 past noon. I bet you don't believe that.
465 votes. D 82 Clark 57. Who's in his 52? Nice going. You see? That's this audience, man. Even though the retards at a ones that call in for the most part about 80% of the callers, the intelligentsia out there, man, they're sitting back in there.

Oh man, it was brutal.
An abused assembly line employee
Who will call simply
Herbie.
Remember the working conditions at C&C Music Factory.
Every two fucking seconds
That fucking horrible woman's voice comes over the PA.
I'm a fucking child now.
And believe me,
We must get moving or shit-handicite
Son of a f-ck ladder.
Workers at C&C Music Factory
were expected to pump out 120 beats per minute.
11 hours a day
Until someone came up with a hit song.
Noreen Payne
Was the shrill demanding voice
Which strove them on.
A little bastard!
A little bastard!
A little bastard!
A little bastard!
But Noreen has deep regrets about the way the workers retreated.
A little bastard!
Oh now!
But the aptly titled,
Gonna Make You Sweat
Was not the only hit that C&C Music Factory produced.
That makes you go clean.
That makes you go clean.
Oh, that piece of s-
My best friend had to die to make that crappy song.
Herbie recalls the day
Things that make you go, hmm, was produced.
Poor little Sammy.
He got caught in a sampling loop on the synthesizer belt and he-
Oh, it was blood everywhere.
He was a simple man.
He just wanted to buy food and clothing for his wife
And for their 14 disabled children
Oh, God!
I hope you're happy out there.
Knowing a good man died
So you could listen to a f-
Damn song!
You bastard!
The C&C Music Factory
People getting paid next to nothing
Did turn out a useless piece of crap.
Not that different from your job really is it?
It's a big, juicy,
Sopping wet look at your business.
Tonight, uninsigned to behind.
132 at 560 WQM, happy Monday 2, a mad dog standing by.
He'll be here at 2.
Oh, and now remember that story we had about the, um,
The Burger King thing when we were like doing the cutting in on the intercoms?
Right.
Police said they expected the Federal Communications Commission to try to identify
Whoever broadcasts on the same frequency is the wireless intercom at a Burger King in Tromachigan.
The FCC, they got nothing better to worry about than that.
About four letter words and about Burger King intercoms.
Hey!
Better than us.
Right. Whatever that means.
Well, you know what they say.
What do they say?
The person broke into the trail restaurants driving order system several times.
I speak most recently on Thursday when he told customers they were too fat to eat a wapper.
Other patrons were subjected to obscenities and bizarre remarks and the manager was ordered back inside.
While trying to look into the source of the mischief.
It has stopped.
Stores supervisor Jennifer or whatever her name is told of Detroit Free Press.
I believe the FCC is taking over the case.
Police Sergeant William Avery said yesterday.
I imagine they have a better way to investigate it.
The FCC has radio direction finding equipment for detecting illicit transmitters.
Federal law also carries more severe penalties than state law.
With stiff fines and prison time for those convicted of willful or malicious interference with radio communicators.
How do you like that?
The government in action, man.
That's Michael Powell for you.
What's the asshole?
You can't mess with our people at Burger King.
Can you believe that?
I want to do it. I wish I thought of it.
Yeah. In fact, I probably do them people a favor.
You too fat to eat them, awkward.
Get out of here. Drive on.
Move on out.
Court next is appeal over 9-11 detentions.
The Supreme Court refused today to consider whether the government properly withheld names and other details about hundreds of foreigners detained in the weeks and months after 9-11.
The High Court turned down a request to review the secrecy surrounding detainees.
Nearly all of them are Arabs or Muslims who were picked up in the US following the attacks on the World Trade Center in the Pentagon.
More than, most of the more than 700 detainees had issued an case since been deported.
Some picked up after 9-11 were charged with crimes. Others were held as material witnesses.
Only Zacharias, whose name changes every five seconds of the way they pronounce it, is a courier, Zacharias Masawi, who was detained before 9-11 attacks, is being prosecuted and connected with 9-11 attacks and they're blowing that pretty good too.
Let's first hold them, Zach.
Watch your back, Zach.
Much more important than that. And maybe Mokin can his ass too.
Absolutely. I think he's a braw between former professional hockey player, Tony Twist.
Oh yeah, St. Louis Blues, I remember him.
And a goon.
And a comic strip creator who named a violent mafia character after him.
Twist claims the character in the spore, SBAWR, spore.
Okay.
Comic series. Heard his image. He caused him endorsement. Oh, spawn.
There's a thing for this. You know, spawn?
Yes. They made a movie.
Custom endorsements. The high court rejected without comment and appeal from a spawn creator, Todd McFarlane, a argue that his work was free speech.
McFarlane had a team of Hollywood backers, including Michael Critton, creator of the TV series ER, Clayton.
Larry Davide.
Co-creator, a Seinfeld.
Novela Scott Tiro and Jeremiah Healy, no kind of Glenn Healy of the Amapolifs.
And actor comedian, Harry Sheerer from The Simpsons.
Harry Sheerer.
They urged the court to use the case to clarify free speech protections for artists who routinely use the names of famous figures in their works.
The character Antonio Tony Twist Twistelli was used not only in the comic strip, but also his feature in HBO Spinoff Show.
And on some hockey merchandise twist told the injustices.
The real Tony Twist, the former NHL enforcer known more for his fighting than his skating, was awarded more than $24.5 million by Missouri jury.
The award was overturned on appeal, but a court ordered a second trial.
The case is something rather still going on.
Let's see, the court today also did these things.
Well, let's see, is there anything important left undisturbed or ruling that upheld a ban on so-called junk faxes.
An appeals court had ruled that the government had a substantial interest in protecting the public from unwanted fax ads.
The decision upheld the telephone consumer protection act of 91, which regulates telemarketing calls, contains prohibitions against junk faxes.
Oh, do you hear that little squirrely asshole out there about your junk faxes? You're going to jail.
They declined a review and appeal from a man found guilty of voting fraud in 1999 for voting at what address while living at another.
John Kennedy O'Hara, a lawyer, claims he was single out for prosecution. He was brought to trial three times by the Brooklyn D.A.'s office, the cases of O'Hara versus New York.
And they passed a chance to consider a constitutional challenge to Florida's tax on pay-per-view boxing matches.
A boxing promoter argued that similar taxes in California, Georgia, and Oregon have been invalidated.
The cases top rank versus the Florida State Boxing Commission, they said, El Paso is what they said. Well, pass.
Well, that's good news.
In that good news? Well, they were too busy worrying about the, you know, getting in touch with the FCC.
I don't want to be more than you.
To make sure they see who's dicking with the intercoms at Burger King.
Because boy, I'll tell you, they know their whoppers at the Supreme Court believe you may.
Just like back in 2000, the greatest whopper of all time.
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T Inforizon line. We're doing screenless. I don't see much action on there. And we got 23 minutes to kill.
WQA, I'm hello.
Neil, how you doing? Pretty good, sir.
Hey, you know how fast is this Republican ticket?
No, you're chronic. I don't want your boring.
He's boring. I want to hear. I mean, he agrees and that's great. But you're boring and you're chronic and over and over and over and you're voice.
It puts everybody into a coma and it would deep sleep. Okay. Call the Randy Roadshow, please.
Call upon to those that we're going to change the world shows. I'm just here to pass along some information.
I will play the 60 minutes thing again in a liter and a week. Good. I got it. Good to think it. I mean, it's great.
See, maybe call me crazy. You're crazy. Okay.
But it seems to me that this Paulo Neil thing. This is a bombshell. Yeah, the book will be released tomorrow.
By the way, it's called the price of loyalty.
And the author is what's his name? Donald Trump's felt. No, seriously. What's his name?
O'Connor. No. He's on the piece. Suspined. Yeah. Anyway. Run. Suspined.
Yeah, right now. Ronald Suspined. And it'll be on the bookstores tomorrow.
Should be the story of the century. This is somebody he released. Not and he interviewed.
Also, he said many other cabinet members. It wasn't just Paulo Neil and the other ones want to of course be anonymous.
He's the only one that came public and pubic. Yeah, but don't you think he'd be traded the president?
He a trader. So there it is. It relates it right out there for you. Man, a blind man in a room full of deaf people.
Dick Cheney, Karl Rove. They're calling all the shots. The P-neck stuff. The attack on Iraq was planned law.
And I've been telling the people that for two years now that they were getting ready to do something.
And certainly since March, we've been telling that this was already preordained.
Oh no, we had to do this because he was a dangerous man and look at those daines found that French is mustard in there.
And a little great poop on on the side. Yeah. Yeah, they're pooping on the side. All right.
God, tragic. Just a tragedy. The fact that they that there's that again, not in my blame in them. I'm blame the Democrats. Those are the people I blame.
You have to head to Kenny star all those right wing lunatics man. They didn't waste any time. They got their ducks in order. They had the balls to do it. It was a disgrace.
It was a waste of money in time, but they did it.
Democrats are sitting back. Well, you're not as much for dark folks in the fixes. I am. Well, I'm, you know, all of a sudden they're crap.
All he in fighting instead of putting the attack where it belongs and seeing who's doing the best job of that and articulating it the best.
Should be one of the big stories of the of the year, maybe in the last 10 years. It's right there. The Iraq attack and the worst part of it is.
Well, I got to that wrote it down. Bush saying go find me a way to do this. Yeah. Go find some way to make this happen to get rid of Saddam Hussein to throw him out over.
Throw the thing and of course get all our ducks in a row for the oil over there. Go find me a way to do this and make it palatable.
So the public will go along with it. Those are those O'Neill liberal lies. Yeah, right. Good old Republican, Paul O'Neill and Kevin Phillips and Papu Cannon and the list goes on.
So it's all right. Therefore it's like they're putting up billboards all over America. Just take a look at it. Okay. There's the few can truth.
Just take a look at it and absorb it. Suck it in and hold it.
20 till two of the Mad Dogs coming along to talk about more important stuff like ball games had a lot of good ones over the weekend.
Man, it was just gut wrenching. It was incredible. Just one after another. Patriot game just took about five years off my life. Wow.
And I was pulling for Kansas City yesterday because I figured at least that way Trent Green and Tommy Brady.
At least that way if it's Kansas City and the Patriots and the Super Bowl, I can't do that.
Or like an EFC championship, I mean, at least then you got two great looking quarterbacks. Isn't that what it's all about?
And Joe Named says 19 till two at QM. Hey, listen, you might be doing that too after either the animal coach.
They have a few belt because you'll be so full, man, but you'll be happy because you can't beat the animal coast with a stick.
They can accommodate all kinds of groups for it to take the whole gang from the office.
Start your mouthwatering experience at the animal coast with six different soups. Then sampled dozens of delicious amazing entrees like New York strip made of order.
Their sizzling Asian grill along with that great seafood saying Jacques named of course after the great late gold tender Jacques plot first go to wear a mask.
Enjoy oysters on a half shell every night and there's lots more like the Laskin stone crab, middle neck clams, dumbos shrimp scampi.
And now for the first time ever main lobster on a weekends at the animal coast.
Shoveled in a little that hard hand car primer and their new tie specialties to and you'll never walk out of there like I always tell you with a pounding headache from MSG because they don't use any.

Q&A
Ladies, this is television that it's best.
What is the message there? The message is that there are known knowns. There are things we know that we know.
There are known unknowns. That is to say there are things that we now know we don't know.
Strong, bewildering words. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know. We don't know.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? I'm just talking. This is blah, blah, just words.
This has been a presentation of ABC News. You talking to me? Yeah. Oh, 145. Well said this.
145 at 560 WQM. The mad dog was just in and he said, oh, right. Yeah, he's all whipped up with these ball games. No pressure.
No pressure because that often the season is over. Let's find out if we can fire a day of Wants the two later.
Yeah, today that they are supposed to be naming the GM to bring in somebody. I think it's a war in Camarri.
Yeah, they figured out he knew nothing about baseball. Let's see if he knows anything about football.
How? Give me the ball. Give me the ball. And give me that powder. It's time to take a powder. Cashmere bouquet is what it is.
And what were you just saying? The transcript of that 60 minutes, uh, minics pieces on the website and a year ago,
Paul O'Neill was fired from his job as George Bush's Treasury Secretary. You mean that one? And working on getting the audio link going.
Nice going on here. The best baby. I'm talking. He is so good. I don't know what you said or did him. Nothing. Oh, get out of here.
I think when Boerbore was here, that created like a rift. Not to mention, of course, the two years before Boerbore came in and when he didn't do anything.
I mean, sorry. Well, no, he's making up for lost time. Although he did. We did have a little because I faxed him that poll and I thought you forgot to fax him Friday.
So I called him to alert him to it. And he said, you know, those 85 bedtime stories could you maybe cut it down a little bit. I was getting a little carried away.
No, seriously, because I had the 30 days in a row and he said it took him like a couple hours. And he'd like to get you know on the treadmill or exercise bike. And I thought, well, I'm, I'm certainly not going to take time away from that.
Do you really believe he's on the treadmill or exercise? No, no. He didn't see in the second time he came down. You'll hear ever saw him. Well, he lost him. Really fat time. He lost like 60 pounds between the two.
How do you know what he looks like now? Once a last time, I don't know. We know what for it. And it's like the beast. So in other words, he could weigh anywhere between like 180 and 480.
It's a floating weight. Yeah, like the beast. Oh, if this crowd. It's seriously. It looks like a human beach ball with legs. Human beach ball with little tiny legs.
Like a shoe. He is a schmoo. Forget about your polluca. If you want to see the real schmoo see the beast. Check him out.
663 votes. Any too bad. Considering this requires like an IQ larger than your thumbnail, I would assume that you put a option on there for them. Oh, yeah.
Regardless of which candidate you support, which contender is best articulating your views. That's a little bit artsy, fancy that we usually, usually we have like a bunch of crap on there.
But we're trying to like appeal the way much higher intellect. Are we? No, no, we're not. No, we're not. And we like the.
We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not.

We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We

wasn't a one shot deal. They'll like, well, he got in a good line one shot deal. But it wasn't a one shot deal. He got in a good line one time. He'll like, well, he got in a good line one time.

I was catching a snippet of him.
Oh, my God.

Believe in every word of this cartel administration that
controls us by fear for media manipulation and the right wing is
drilling it over and over into our hips.
That irack has some mappings of mass destruction.
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.
We're all suspects now.
Not the ass-brop is saying.
I have nothing to hide.
Table talkers all are saying.
Plinopedian cattle don't have any reservations.

It's a treat to beat your feet.
Something like that.
WDQA.M.
Hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Cousinich.
Yes.
Did you hear what he did last week?
What's that?
He was on national public radio and he held up a pie chart and the moderators said, sir,
we're on radio.
Right.
Not good.
I mean, that's his one blunder.
He said, we do that all the time.
Look at this.
So anyway, but to have a good day.
Well, I mean, as soon as this was at least a pucky pie, see you.
5.61.
Did I say he was perfect?
No.
No.
Maybe he was trying to deflect attention from the hair piece from the panel.
You think that might have been it?
That could be it.
Because we see like I'm sitting here with his muskete on my head, right?
And you're afraid that everybody's going to be looking at it, you know?
So maybe he held up the chart so they would like kind of look away.
I hear he moond him too as a matter of fact.
Just anything to get the attention off the top of his head.

Our dean got slammed yesterday.
Yeah, he's fallen bad.
Can you say this though?
He's got great ideas.
He speaks well, but man, I had never seen him before.
Yes, I do as they cut him on the camera.
I thought it was starting to lie.
Well, okay, is there a person hitting somebody?
What can I say?
And by the way, I'm holding up some pie right now.
Can you see it?
I see it.
It's still a bit like hair pie to me.

Do you know that he's actually counted the number of shows that he does a year?
He's, even, he puts me to shame.
He is unbelievable.
He told me he has 200 and 12 shows here.
I said you just making that up.
You know, he's got it done.
He's got it in his, uh, yeah, but his shows are really long.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
