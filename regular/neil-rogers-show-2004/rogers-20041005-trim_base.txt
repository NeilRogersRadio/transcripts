Who says Madonna thinks she is anyway?
Now news about CBS News.
The doctor mispreposing to show that George W. Bush received preferential treatment during
his years in the Texas International Guard.
At the time CBS News and this reporter fully believed the doctor misrepresent.
Why did CBS News misread this?
Why did CBS News tell something that is not true?
CBS News should not have done so.

CBS News is well known for trying for several years now to discredit President Bush's military
service record that will docting.
The failure of CBS News to properly fully scrutinize the documents and the source led to our
airing the documents when we should not have done so.
It was in the sense CBS News lied to his.

Yeah, seven bucks.
Yeah, no.
Oh yeah?
Well don't start belly-acquired about it because Hank got suspended once for that.
The first suspension on QM was allegedly for belly-acquired about the crappy food in
a press box and having to pay for it at P.P. Park.
Oh that would be a...
I wouldn't be a cross-an-at-line.
Of course also the real reason was the fact that Hank was bitching out the screw in
in the water Nazi.
Well half of that problem's gone.
Anyway, our beaded curtain today Charlotte Lewis, born organ, that's a great picture by
the way.
Well all you horn dogs out there you really need to get on the beaded curtain right
now before it's too late.
Before it gets so hot on there that you won't even be able to get out of it or into
it or near it.
You'll even be able to sniff it.
She was born August 7th 1967 in Kensington, London in the UK and she was selected as

if you wanted it.
Yes he would.
Some of that fine cuisin.
Right.
Anyway her filiography hey DJ that's to complete it but not out yet.
Henry the 5th, the 10th.
Henry the 10th.
Every dog has its day and mutual.
What kind of a movie was that I wonder?
Mutual needs never hope to lose the glass cades to read you diary 6 and how I met my husband.
Decoy embraces the vampire, men of war, lifts the camera excessive force storyville, sketch
artist.
A lot of people go.
Yes.
Embrace to the vampire is the one where listen along and also gets very naked and they
do lesbian things together.
They're the vampires and they embrace.
Oh aka the most raw to diaries embrace the vampire.
I just mentioned that in Ponytail.
Bare essentials, tripwire, broken badges, Rob Nogelito whatever the hell that was.
Oh I see this is Italian.
Rano Nogelito.
The golden child, the pirates and the green geol and on TV she's about to stuff that you
would care about, Richard, Diarrhea stuff like that.
Okay here's the poll today and I left some very obvious ones out that Josh can even write
now already.
Burton Cummings.
Okay.
I'll be guess who?
Is there any dollars of pause there?
You don't think so?
Of course I do.
I was going.
Well you're all time favorite Canadian celebrity.
I already voted.
Burton come to my list and listen.
What about her?
Well how come I didn't put them on there yet?
Drugs?
Here's the list we've got so far.
John Candy, Monty Hall, not only old parts of those for Monty Hall, maybe both a Brian
will do that.
Celine Dion, Anne Marie, Maya Myers, I beg your pardon?
A man, baby.
Mike Myers, Jim Carey, William Shatner, Neil Young, Martin Short, is Martin Short, you
bet you're sweet ass.
Lauren Green, Avril Lavigne, Rams with Lauren Green, Burton Cummings and Lesserie, that's
a pretty good group right for starters there.
Have you seen Lauren Green?
No I'm not.
I'm saying Lauren LR&E.
I'm not saying Lauren.
They can sure.
Why do you think his name was Lauren?
No it sounded like you said Lauren.
No I did not say Lauren.
Boy you really since you started wicked all that crap coffee from that BP yesterday,
why do I have a recovery?
No, man oh man.
It's a good deal.
The impact is still there.
The after effect, what does this say?
You talked a bit about the echo boomer typecasting, the Eastern corporate syndicate is creating,
it says this facts.
Regarding the references to these kids buying brand names, it says Gillette etc.
There's a trend to her companies buying airtime within the programs rather than buying traditional
commercial slots, the theory being that people switch channels of commercial rights this
way we're effectively trapped into hearing their brand names within the programming.
Well yeah well it's like what they do, they pay the American movies for their opening
up a can of coke or any other, you know they're shaving with a bick.
All depending on what you're giving.
You know what I'm talking about.
That's a very good point.
Yeah just more of that bull crap, more of the brainwashing, the manipulating of the public.
Oh well you're a generation wire, you're a baby boomer and you're a jackass okay whoever
say this crap.
And by the way Bill I will not watch my language, not do whatever I want to do and but take
care of my money and stuff.
You know it's amazing to me how everybody I know, everybody wants to run the program,
they got what you should do with this and you shouldn't say that.
Everybody's an expert I think including Norma Kent who wants to know if he has any ratings
on if they're on a Saturday morning show.
The answer norm is no, get something done for me okay.
Instead of this sick twisted ego problem that you got man, you're about as effectual as
a dead frog.
As a matter of fact, some of the dead frogs are starting to look pretty good.
How does up here Elliot Trudeau looking huh?
He wouldn't know it too bad.
Let's take him on the pole.
Wait till you hear this story.
This in fact, this kind of like tying a fits right in with our B.D.
curtain picture today.
The Rickley M. Fernandez line kind of fits right in if I can say that.
Well, while you hear it you'll understand the drift of this.
Where's Bane Australia?
Hundreds of airline passengers suffered destruction of their travel plans when a major regional
airport was shut down for an hour after a humming and vibrating adult sex tour was making
a mistake and for a bomb.
Luna Bomba.
The vibrator was discovered at about 915 Sunday morning by a security officer who checked
that he says, fish is packaged.
I've seen some suspicious packages my time.
I don't want to hear about it.
Inside a rubbish bin at the terminal cafeteria of McCay Airport in the northeastern state
of Queensland, the police spokeswoman said.
The terminal was evacuated immediately while passengers would just arrive from a flight,
check-in staff, cafeteria employees, and higher car personnel, higher car personnel.
That's great.
We're all forced to leave.
Cad drivers, I believe is what they're trying to say in their desperate, but this is in
the some brith thing or some Aussie thing.
Cappetry manager Lynn Bryant said her staff having truing tables when they noticed strange
humming noise coming from the rubbish bin.
Maybe it was a hummer.
It was rather disconcerting when the rubbish bin started humming furiously, she said.
The rubbish bin was humming furiously.
Oh, and back in the day I had a great life.
But we will be using it now because Joyce was real out of shorts.
We called security next and everybody was being evacuated while they checked it out.
The police spokeswoman said another two flights were expected to land at that stage and
alternate arrangements were being made for passengers to collect their luggage away from
the terminal from the runaway vibrator.
If you said the emergency situation would be evoked as before 10am when the package was
identified as an adult novelty device.
Bryant said the time of the upheaval of the airport had been quite busy with two main
flights to in and out of the airport wreaking havoc with people's schedules, nothing like
the old in and out of the airport.
He said in retrospect the humming sounded exactly like a vibrator, but it was better to
be safe than sorry you can't afford to take chances.
It was interesting that she knew exactly what a vibrator sounded like.
I just mentioned that in passing.
Right.
North-South respecting woman doesn't know what a vibrator sounds like.
That doesn't mean they've ever used one or actually held it in their hand.
No self-satisfying woman knows what a...
I mean them.
So anyway, here's this facts about the Michael Moore appearance in Gainesville last night.
And I can barely read this because it's obviously scratched up over the best of
intention.
Very scrawny, scratchy.
Spy report from Gainesville, Michael Moore was here last night speaking at the
something of the city to a full house, something like 2,000 people had to be turned away.
Had the local people they're promoted at all, they probably could have filled the stadium.
Whatever it is called.
Ben Hill Griffin is that what it's called?
What's the name of that stadium up there in Gainesville?
The Gator Stadium.
All right, no idea.
Boy, man, you know, it was like, you're always going to be coming down on your ass if you
point out expression.
You just are not up to snuff with this fourth nerd stuff.
What the hell is going to be?
It's going to be a very upset about that.
It says there were that many people that could have filled the football stadium.
It says, look like a lot more than 2,000.
Anyway, Michael Moore was great.
Rip Bush and asked from the debate.
New notes from Iraq and clips a new footage from his Fahrenheit 9-11 BBD, which is out
today.
Gloughton gets several copies, by the way.
Pass it out to all your neighbors.
Very few Bushes out there, too, perhaps, this opus yet says somebody who's a commercial
I can make some plays, can't read them, but thank you very much.
How do you like that?
Now, let's take a quick puke peek at the first John Candy 25.
Well, it's not surprising, is it?
Your favorite Canadian celebrity of all time.
Mike Myers 13 is Neil Young 12, Jim Caritan, William Shander 6.
See, William Shander, not to see the thing in a star track, which is fine.
But William Shander, I just think of his spots he's done right around his grown beyond.
What was the something.com?
Price line.
They price line.
Very good.
See, if it's not to do with sports, he knows what it is.
Priceline.com.
And then, of course, those awful albums he puts out.
He's a funny guy.
He has to.
That's what his first wife thought came in before she drowned.
As the bubbles were coming up from down the knee, I hear just a bundle of laughs.
She was chuckling and chortling and choking.
William Shander 6, Avril Lavigne 4, Leslie Nielsen 2.
Love Leslie Nielsen.
He's great.
Especially when he used to come on the late night TV talk show and have the little,
oh, you know something that was about 100 years ago.
He said that little fart maker in his pocket.
Remember that?
Fart.
Yeah, he used to make fart sounds.
And that was about 80 years ago.
That's okay.
How much progress were making in America?
Not.
Anyway, Martin Short 2 and Murray's got two.
And boy, oh boy, I bet you she's got a big period.
Not what you're thinking either.
Maybe you are thinking.
Martin Short 2, Celine Dion, one, Monty Hall, one.
Burton Cummings of the Guess Who and Murray Green have none of the first 94 votes.
That is unbelievable.
I'm going to play Guess Who music on the way to 2 o'clock.
I'm so porked up about that.
Yes, something I bet you 90% of this audience wouldn't know.
Burton Cummings from Robert Cummings.
You're right.
Right?
You're right.
What a joke.
How is that possible?
They know the Dave Matthews band.
Oh.
But guess who?
Forget about that.
That's for all folks like you guys.
Yeah, old fights.
11-13 at 5-6-6.
We can't even, not only can we not cut old fights,
we certainly can't play them on a ear.
Okay, so let's not talk about that.
Because you know who will get very upset.
They get upset pretty easy over there.

You are listening to Neil Roger,
and it's a military paper on 560-60-M-U-A-M.
It's day out!
Brandy Town.
The Earth has 560-W-U-D-N-L-L.
What in the world is what these child's targets?
The poo-poo I tell ya, absolutely nuts.
Golden, golden, golden, golden, golden, golden.
One was drunk in the Earth, the Tolkien.
She may not be eating, but traces bind with the drinking.
Golden, golden, golden, golden, golden.
Had kills, but McCulley had no prescription.
He was home alone.
Now he's knocked him by the stone.
Trace, trace, he stopped your booze in.
And don't go cruising.
Your three kids were in the backseat, and now boy,
they're hurt and bruised in gold, and Coltkin, gold and Coltkin.
Going together like a bane and heroin,
he's a washed up factor, and trace, he is.
Yes, she is.
Now she is a lousy mother.
The Earth's found.
Lumpin' 19 at 560-W-U-D-Q-M, Alex, who, uh,
evidently has some strange taste, and we already knew that, Alex.
Says, how about how a Mandela?
You know, where how a Mandela was born?
No.
How do you mean one game?
Trolltop.
Good guess.
All right.
Well, so we'll put him on here.
He'll get some votes.
So he's a goofball, and we got a lot of goofballs out there.
So who get votes?
The goofball crowd, you know, the ambulance.
100 years ago.
A big apartment in the candy shack crowd.
I mean, not that there was anything wrong with Animal House or candy shack,
we were both fine and very hysterical, but, uh,
a little overrated by the sports nerd crowd, I've noticed.
Have you noticed that?
Yes.
Yes, had.
Here's one that says, I'd like to let him nominate Dudley Doorite as the all-time Canadian celebrity,
and then says, no, really, how about Pierre, earlier, to Doe?
Well, first of all, he was a politician, he was a prime minister, A.
So we're not looking for politicians, even though he was a fine gentleman,
and, uh, strange, kind of a, uh, I don't know, a curmudgeon.
But also, Dudley Doorite would be fine if there were really such a person,
but there's not.
We love Dudley Doorite.
Right.
As a matter of fact, you know what that makes that inspires me to want to play right now?
I give up.
If I can find it, oh, here it is.
It's Saturday morning, joint.
Whoa, what goes J-Motan is fully money.
He's a Tom Hussain.
Oh, what a mad cop.
Mr. Fenters of El Rocky and Bowwick.
TV, TV, TV, TV.
Do you know what I did?
They can do this about Doe's.
Be.
Who cares?
Give me that crystal ball.
Oh, TV!
Strayed in, he got up and the wrong side of the bucket.
Perhaps a poem will help.
To them, to them, your one-wacked outdood.
And just like your oil, your smelly and brew.
And most, did you say your squirrel friend?
Oh, you mean Rocky?
Sure.
Get over there.
It'll be there.
It'll be there.
Who, my, Rocky?
What do you know about this, today?
Don't ask me.
Ask my auntie.
Maybe, a-d-hoo.
And the aircraft.
I'm going to join us next time for oil swell.
That ends well or kiss your casket by.
Hey, moose, what's the weather forecast for today?
For me, uh-oh.
They're racking in Bowwick.
Saturday morning on New Columbia.
You know, when I'm out getting the 85 copies of Michael Mornfrenheim, I'm 11 today,
and I'm here by a video studio.
What else I'm going to get?
I mentioned they got the Rocky in Bowwinkle.
But they do it.
Any of your final most relevant.
Oh, I love that.
If there was ever a hit or a hit on that, you'd be absolutely...
That was loose.
Sorry.
Natasha, calm down.
Anyway.
So I guess we're all so ready.
We got to pull up.
We got that fantastic, asked to ask picture.
Rick Wimfer and offensive line.
What about the other picture?
Are we going to get that one up?
Is it up there already?
The one with the Bush and the Proboscis, the Pinocchio Bush?
I don't know yet.
Where then I stayed out.
Pintin' one, Pavel and the Wind significance.
This one, he just keeps on the line and the line keeps getting longer in the nose too.
Oh, and speaking of the Bush, Mike Stewart, he is in a state of panic.
He and Carl Rove and all those roving maniacs.
President Bush, stung by the erosion of his lead, over Senator John Kerry in the post-debate polls,
which evaporated like a puddle of pee.
As abruptly scheduled, a major speech for tomorrow in hopes of holding Mr. Kerry's momentum.
He wants to halt the big moh.
D-d-d-d-d-dolly.
In a rare last minute alteration of the presidential schedule, Mr. Bush has scrapped a plan to talk on medical liability.
And instead will give with the White House called a significant speech about the two centralitions of the campaign,
the war on terrorism and the economy.
So he's not too comfortable up there when he's debating somebody that knows what they're talking about.
So he likes to stay dull to himself, so he wouldn't be able to stay there and read the prescripted craft that somebody else wrote.
The president has said that he eager to rebut, Mr. Kerry's attacks on such issues, especially those that have came about during Thursday's presidential debate,
during that debacle for the right wing, for these fundamentalist lunatics, for these Nazis and training.
There's been an attempt by the president's opponent to launch false attacks in this lead, the American people on these big priorities,
White House press secretary of the Uxia Scot, McPhallum told reporters of World Air Force One.
In case you haven't noticed, I'm leaning toward Kerry by the way, George.
There are some big differences facing the American people and the president wants to highlight those differences.
That would be like saying to a Lord-ass limbo, well, we know you're leaning a little bit toward the bush monster, toward the right.
Right, oh Bill, get a life.
The Kerry campaign was delighted that the message is its democratic force of present and the way reactive mode.
Kerry Sporchman, Phil Singer, ridiculed Mr. Bush's decision to give a major speech, which will be delivered in most rare Pennsylvania.
George Bush has spent the last few months resorting to have truths on the stump.
Now he's going the whole way, he said.
A president needs to be forthcoming and straightforward about his policies and if the last few days are in indication,
Wednesday speech will be neither, neither.
So tonight of course we got to participate in Cleveland John Edwards and ancient old Dictani,
who is, for my money, he's the biggest cook in the world today.
I mean the mafia, the drug, the Esco bars, and I'm not talking about Miguel,
you can look anywhere in the world, you will not find a bigger crook than Dictani,
even if you have Bush and then the same lady.
And of course, El Presidente, he's too stupid, he's just a facilitator for the big crook, including Cheney.
How many times do you think we're going to hear Halliburne in the first five minutes of nights debate?
About 30, man.
At least.
And you know what?
I'm going to have to move ahead in just a second.
Because this is the 800th time that we've heard that the, here you go.
CIA review and Cheney continues even at this moment insisting, oh yeah, well there's stuff we know that nobody else knows.
So there wasn't time and he just makes it up as he goes along.
They just lie and lie and lie like crazy.
And speaking of flip-flop and what about the fact he was important at constitutional amendment to ban fact marriages
and then all of a sudden his daughter like her kind of like gave the slap on the ass said, oh okay, whatever you say, hun.
Anyway, CIA review finds no evidence Sodom had ties to Islamic terrorists.
Oh my God.
A new CIA assessment and there seems to be one like every five minutes undercuts the White House's claim that Sodom was saying maintain ties to El-Khada, saying there is no conclusive evidence that the regime, Harvard, or Southern Mid-Law, and the associate of whom was sub-Al-Zakrowi.
The CIA review which US officials said yesterday was requested some months ago by the anxious vice president Dick Cheney with a bad ticker is the latest assessment that caused indecorrected one of President Bush's key justification from last year's US-Land invasion of Iraq.
The new assessment follows the independent on 11 commissions finding that there was no collaborative relationship between the former Iraqi regime and Mid-Lawd and the terrorist number.
Let me say again no connection none zero Ziphani doodah on the one hand you got a fundamentalist religious lunatic.
I'm the other hand you just got a greedy dictator. We don't give a flying crap about that.
And you notice over there and not where no schmuff is under his.
You will see to me, Roger.
Correct the question.
The question is, should they end?
Delight, I am not a Nazi.
He had a spirit, he had nothing to win.
They put one back in dozen hard and sold.
The doctor told me a hard and thin.
But now he really know his hard and sold.
No matter what we're told, you could hurt.
Yes, if Cheney's got a hard that's all.
A beautiful, a bit downy slow.
He makes decisions, he has the vision, he has the country under his control.
While watching jogging, it's danger-roving.
And that's what happens when your heart is old.
And it's full of hope.
Yes, it's chaining, it's not a heart that's old.
I'm dying on the air, go.
You'll keep on working till as hard as cold.
You'll keep pretending that is hard, ain't no.
We're going to see that full of better jobs in the next level.
In Edward 42, 20, 40, I'm sure, 15 and under online polls, see that's a gallop thing where they interview like 90 Republicans and 10 Democrats.
But on their online polls, it's like 63 to 37.
I think Edwards will do a better job, beating up on old pathetic Dick Cheney, that old Kermudger with a bad ticker.
I would be just, please, this punch.
If he just like, fell to the floor right in the middle of the debate, just packed it in.
Anyway, I didn't realize we had so many, well, I guess I did, but I didn't forget who's some of the more Gordon life foot.
Canadian celebrities, who's your favorite?
You got to take them all, baby.
Lauren Michaels, not to be confused with Lauren Green, and it says here they often address him as Lauren Green, much to issue Green.
And fellow Torontonian creator and still producer of certain interlives says the chronic in cocoa.
Also, it says, for the poll, not the one please include Dan Acroid, and your favorite secret swisher, Raymond Burr.
Well, I'm almost time to get the Perry Mason theme up, but I'm not going to.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, because you're late, then.
Of course, there's always still Hartman.
What Phil Hartman makes to pull two days in row, how do you like that?
And the bad news is he's still dead.
You go Phil.
Damn it.
You look so Hartman.
Michaels A5s.
I'm not a big Michaels A5s fan.
He always seemed kind of like a nebysheed to me, I don't know.
Yeah.
Torpy.
Yeah.
But anyway, he's got that shape of things in the eyes.
Yeah.
Well, I don't be making fun of that.
I wasn't.
You were.
And you were.
And Jan Arino Shaky.
Well, it says.
Nor Mcdonald.
Christopher Plummer.
And how could we forget one of my very favorite people?
Norfolk and I are twain.
What's wrong with you, man?
Right.
I'm looking at it right now.
Bill and four lot of people always says, but also says, by the way, the Gator statement gains till Kamala referred to as the swamp.
I've never been in games, villain.
You know what?
I hope to make it all the way through my life without ever going there.
Oh, don't knock it.
Why you been there?
Say, college town.
Yes, indeed.
Really?
It's the second only to one other place I can think of, do they like to drink and have sex?
And pretty much.
Oh, I said East Lansing, Michigan.
Oh, I've been there.
I thought what I was thinking, but yeah.
Oh, that's not all we did there.
In fact, that's why I'm about.
The totally the stories of having lived in the East Shaw Hall.
All the jocks living in West Shaw.
One of the great pastimes, like on the weekends, would be the kids from the East Shaw.
On the kids from West Shaw, we'll get outside and then they would yell each other.
West Shaw eats Schmidt and the advocates from West Shaw.
East Shaw eats a better watch house in it.
Carefully.
Schmidt.
So, is that what I said, Bill?
You got that Schmidt?
Like in Joe Schmidt, he used to be lined back over the Detroit lines.
God, these people are one in nitpick.
Oh, I had one mother and she's in a box, okay?
Three months now.
As a matter of fact, three months ago today.
Oh!
How do you like that?
It's an anniversary, George.
Happy anniversary, Bill.
Thank you.
And my entire life.
No, do the ancient, don't you think you did that?
The whole nagging thing, my entire life, almost 62 freaking years now.
So, I'm finally relieved of that.
I do mean relieved of it.
I mean, she lived a nice long life and then up is enough.
Which pages per, I think on the stats page there, how many people are we?
Like, you know, maybe two, two, three.
And I'm putting all those important stuff on there every day.
And I don't get it.
Maybe we're just wasting our time.
What do you think?
Maybe we should just devote our entire website to pornography.
Part of our point, you had to be the curtain.
What do you think of that?
Voters.
But experts say it's impossible to predict just how many.
Yeah, we know.
They got a lot of time to fill.
It's all I can tell you about them talking news networks.
They have a lot of time to fill.
Anyway, here's the deal.
You're all time favorite Canadian celebrity.
John Candy 51, Mike Myers 38, Neil Young 28, Jim Carrey 28.
I'll just read the top few here.
Leslie Eelson 21, Bill Shatton or 19.
Everybody else single digits.
Burton Communist got four.
That's good.
Nice to see you moving up there.
And I told you how he mandels got up here.
I can't stand how he mandels.
I'd rather watch that Gotti show on E and E.
Ooh, that'll go on time.
Say it's nothing you can't take back.
No, no, no, no.
I don't care if it's got huge ratings.
I don't care how many of you punch out that.
It's really an angel.
It doesn't.
Oh, that was just some queen.
Oh, no, some Oshan provocateur.
Line 9, QA and hello.
Neil, how you doing, sir?
Pretty good, sir.
Hey, Neil, I don't think people realize with your poll today,
Burton Cummings is like the greatest rock vocalist of all time.
Right.
The guys, and by the way, the guests who started touring again around 2000-2001,
they've got like a live video coming out this month with him singing lead.
He's almost 60 years old.
Yeah, I won't mention again how bad they were at that free concert here last summer after the
saw our thing, but yeah, he's great.
Did they, what was Burton singing later?
Was it?
Yeah, yeah, he was there, unfortunately.
He was a lot of his speed, you know.
Well, we all have our days.
Yeah, he was probably stoned or something.
I challenge anybody.
Let me go.
He's stoned.
Go ahead.
I challenge anybody to share the land.
Let's do them well.
Go ahead, keep talking.
Overrun.
Step on him.
Everything.
Mind your own other day, Dave.
Okay.
How did you turn your share of coming down?
No.
I'm sick.
I'm sick.
See, anybody that would say that the Dave Matthews band is really neat and really great
and they make music, which, and not only don't they make good music, they don't make any music,
and then say, well, what do you guys say?
That's for old toads like you guys.
That's for old trolls like you.
That's for old, old, or living in a past.
They wouldn't say that.
They would say, who?
Yeah.
Well, guess who?
Well, they really.
Well, why is that?
I would think with all the oldie moldy station, of course, probably magic don't play very much,
guess who would do they now?
Because they have nothing to do with the righteous brothers or would build me a buttercup by the foundation's good.
I'm going to tell you that Bob Hamilton got a program's magic.
He needs to be, uh, he needs to be horsewhip.
And I know just the guy who would do it to our good friend Rich draw.
I'll bet you anything he would like to get one of those big whips from the drivers at Compano Park.
Just wave away on Bob Hamilton.
And of course, taste and history, humorous.
Yeah, that'd be even pull.
What's your favorite guess who saw?
It would be like taking a pull.
What's your favorite song by the foundations?
I bet you would be a buttercup when have a chance.
Might have a shot.
I was like this often.
I was like this often.
Have a shot.
I'm not a buttercup.
You're going to win a game, but I sure doubt it.
I like this guy.
Rick the Steel, Mike, you're just saying we're going to win some games this year.
Well, I doubt it.
I wouldn't bet on it.
This is five minutes and seven seconds long.
Talk about Killin' Some We Good Talk Time.
But you never wait.
You never let the music play to the correct.
You know, we still hold off people in their favorite part.
I sing.
Bob just let it go until we're at two different grids.
So we have to do the great.
Yeah.
Nice to see you guys.
I love you guys.
I love you guys.
This means spears get married.
See?
Wow.
What?
No, that's just a little preview of the next bit.
I hit the wrong button.
He's even noticed.
But that was kind of fun.
I like that.
It's good to hell out of it.
Well, we can't do the break.
That's good.
That'll keep you on your toes.
That's what we're here for, okay?
He gets us through these other dismojury human nasty soft-floored amazes in the hurricanes
and all these other horrendous things.
And of course, they're pressing dolphin thing.
And I know that there are zillions of people really downed out because those panthers aren't playing.
No NHL season, right?
Absolutely.
I like yeldy.
Hey, I've talked to you about dry concepts for over 20 years.
And that's because I've been using them in my home for over 20 years.
Nothing has changed during that period of time.
There's still a vest when it comes to having your carpet furnished or draper,
your area rugs, your ory-eneral rugs, all of these things clean.
The only name you want to even think about is dry concepts.
And don't forget, your carpeting is as bad as your sink when it comes to collecting germs.
So, call dry concepts today.
And I'm going to make everything look better, but sanitize your home too.
Dry concepts is about certified technicians who really know their stuff.
You can trust them in your home.
And they'll dry clean your carpet.
Same the idea is dry clean your clothing.
The stains go away.
They don't come back.
They get even the deep down dirt in the fibers of your carpet.
Beware those 595-per-room scans.
Most of the carpet cleaning companies got that deal going, where they promise you one thing,
and then they give you a rip off at the end.
With dry concepts, they give you a guaranteed written price before they start the job.
And dry concepts uses a rapid drying technique so your carpets are drying just an hour and a half.
So it's not just an advertising slogan.
It'd be the true.
You really can clean today and retain the night.
If they're good enough for me, they've got to be good enough for you.
I guarantee you.

The bottom of the thing? Yeah, the thing of the thing, the thing is the thing of the thing of the thing that you have to see these sits in. Okay, the tray. The tray, very good. Oh, now it'll go like this.
I've done this before. Now I've heard what? Okay, talk, I want to fix this because I want to sit here and deal with it.
Here it goes, I'll fix it. Boy, do I know how to do it or what, man? I know how to do it. Anyway, let's get back to what's taken a few of these important calls. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, but before we do that, the former US civilian administrator in Iraq says the United States paid a big price for not having enough troops on the ground and the overto the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime.
How do you like that? Paul Bremer said that. Boy, you're probably lies. Speaking one day at the opening session of the 91st Annual Insurance Leadership Forum in White Selfers Springs, West Virginia said,
that the horrid looting was occurring when he arrived in Baghdad on May 6, 2003. Horrid, H-O-R-R-I-D. Horrid. You ready for that? I'll see if this thing is going to work. Uh-oh. I better check, I better try something out in here. Okay.
We have to help address for the, we're usually a little more emptiness. Let me just try this. One time I'll make sure it works.
Welcome to another hilarious episode of George Bush Theater. I think you're like rainbows without the mask. George plays Rainman.
Wait, what were you doing in my room? I believe. Rainman, Rainman, what were you doing in my room? I don't know. You don't know what you were doing in my room.
And uh, and uh, we're noises. Well those noises are none of your business. You understand that? I understand now. Huh? Uh, put the callbook down. Stop acting in it. Go to sleep.
Um, go to sleep. Stay tuned for the next George Bush Theater where George plays Horrid's gun.
W. Did you fart? I wouldn't be surprised if uh, carry the sexual weight has to say that on Friday. You know what? Some people get really nervous. They start farting a lot.
Anyway, we paid a big price for not stopping the looting because of the established atmosphere of lawlessness, remember?
Said we never had enough troops on the ground. Stillbrem right? And Austin Saddam was the right thing to do. Right. The far right thing to do.

one bit where he says your vote will be on the ground. What is that there
column? Oh, I don't know. Oh, yes you do. What is it? Is it I don't know?
It's like very recent. I know. But you think about around
reading. I'll go to the floor, coffee. I'll read that. Meanwhile, state law enforcement officials
and U.S. Justice Department's signal plans to investigate the registration
strategies and groups that may have been properly enrolled or attempted to enroll
new voters would say those concerns stem from reports involving
priority registrations being switched after forms were filled out as well as
registrations that people may have made up names of voters. Well, we got to make up
names of voters, Linda, because you're going to try to knock all of Blackwell votes
off of there. All the Fag votes, all the Jew votes, except of course, of the 10-9

Hey. Yes, sir. I'm in the driving around Palm Beach. Can I have
listened to you for a long time? This is the hurricane. It's like Spanish music that's
planted in the background now for your, you know, whenever you're on for QAM.
And I was wondering if you know anything about that. Yeah, we had two calls on
yesterday and I remember maybe Castro pumped up one of his half a million
watch stations or something and taken all the juice from the rest of the island.
And who knows? I have nothing from our management people or our engineering staff.
They're oblivious. They got bigger fish to fry, yes. Unbelievable.
But I would say, now the only good part about that is although it might take a long time,
is that when I was at WS News and they did the same thing, Castro cranked up one on 790.
And they applied the FCC to raise their power from five to 10,000
months and they got the permission. But then of course you have to go
buy the transmitter so we'd have to take up a collection for that. That would take a long time.
Oh my God. But I'm waiting looking forward to tonight. I think, you know,
Cheney's in big trouble. He's going against the litigator.
And I think we're at whatever way he wants to go. He's going to be in a bad shape.
I hope so.
From your mouth to this year's screw us together.
Is that the one I just, and I played a little while ago today?
No, I did not play a play yesterday. I'm going to play it.
I even though I didn't get a whole lot of votes. But keep in mind that poll we did last week,
that was about your all-time favorite. That doesn't mean they don't like that one.
It just hasn't been around that long. It's highly unlikely that a brand new one would be in that
category. That's why most of the brand ones. Anyway, this is enough to make you want to gag.
You're not to make you want to puke your guts out.
You're mine.
Machete wielding supporters of ousted president job return arissteed are turning the wrath
on Hades demoralized police force. Oh, be heading some of the victims in a campaign
imitative of the insurgency in Iraq. Can't you people down there do anything original?
Man, even so the baseballs like the Japanese used to do it, it was at the Taiwanese.
Seven of at least 18 people killed in the turmoil in Porto Prince had been police officers.
Judicial police chief Michael Lucius, or is that Lucius said Monday, he said an eighth officer
remains hospitalized in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the Hades.
Three of the sign policemen were decapitated. Let's see if they would have shot this
head off first and the gunshot wouldn't hurt so bad.
Three of the sign policemen were decapitated after being shot,
see during classes with pro-arissteed demonstrators last week. Oh, brother,
what a beautiful world, huh?
In the prime minister, Gerard Lottorcher, who was leading you,
what a... L-A-T-O-R-T-U-E, okay?
Lottorcher, Portoori. Yeah, I think he's from Abu Gharr, who was leading a US back transitional
government, spelled out for Arissteed's out to in February. Another nightmare there,
not only the government, but the hurricane, everything else,
has said the police killings were part of an offensive by pro-arissteed gangs dubbed Operation
Bagdad. It's in the Bagdad, and we're talking about some of the cops head.
Deadly classes continued yesterday between street gangs in Sites-Sole,
no relation to Cirque-Sole, a Porto Prince shanty-com teaming with Arissteed supporters
were fully shot and killed two gang leaders last week. I don't know how many of you are who was killed,
but people were killed, said the mayor of that community, speaking by telephone from the C-Sides slum.
The violence in Porto Prince in southern Haiti is coincided with the chaotic aftermath of
tropical storm Jean in the Northwest. As rescuers recovered more bodies from the devastating
floods and mudslides around Graniva's, the official toll rose yesterday to 1870 with another
884 people reported missing and most presumed dead. Wow, people are desperate, it's chaos,
it's never- And of course you don't really care that much about them because they're all black,
just like all the people who are starving and being eliminated in Africa. We don't care about that
I mean we talk, you know, talking good games, some of the people, most of the rest of the people
don't even talk that game, they're just ignorant because the world basically don't care about
farchers, it's a very sad, sorry thing, but that's just the way it is. Agro what?
Oh and speaking of shootings, a lot of shootings going on, a lot of guns in the land.
Las Vegas, a gun and open fire, on the home of former Las Vegas strip entertainer,
Simfried Fishbocker and Roar and, uh, Roar.
Roar.
What? How you said that, then?
Fishbocker and Roar.
Roar.
Shouting they should get out of the country and police say they yesterday, police initially labeled
the shooting as a hate crime, a later city yesterday, a patrol officer had misclassified the case
on paperwork, whatever that means. No one was certainly September 21st, drive by shooting,
during which a witness said a man fired four shots from a wide van breaking two windows
and leaving the 12-inch hole in the star's home northwest of the strip, officer Jose Montoya
would be saying. It wasn't known if they were home at the time, they're squawking and decline to
comment. The warrant has been issued for the government, it was not identified, police announced
the shooting yesterday, the day after, Roar.
Born in France celebrated his 60th birthday at the home. Sunday was also the one-year anniversary
of an ear-fatal tiger mulling that left Roar partially paralyzed and forced to closure of
the illusionist long-running Simfried and Roar. Roar.
Show. Roar.
Born in Fishbocker, Ludden Vegas, sir, and some 35 years.
One of the biggest spattens, since the attack, the men, they've been spattin' alive, you know?
One of them things. You don't think that they're...
What? What's your all-time favorite Canadian celebrities?
Our full question today on neo-roggies.com when you're through Peruzin that's a beautiful
work room for an offensive line. That's about the most popular thing connected with it often,
these days. I've already had so many men on there for like an hour.
John Candy, 66, Mike Myers, 51, Neo Young, 38, Jim Carey, 36, Leslie Neilsson,
moving up fast, thank God, 27, Bill Schadner, 25, he's going to sing for us a little later.
Phil Hartman, 11, Over Levine, she be having 10.
Mr. Candy, I like to relax while I have a very bad memory,
but I'm going to recite my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers 12th of our group in AA.
This fight is time to make up, fascist the op-ons through us again.
If you can talk to them brown and your vote will surely get thrown out. I love that.
Let's see, that's just ties with a lot of us in about Haiti and Africa.
Is the world doesn't care about dark folks and of course in America, we talk in good game, you know?
Well, you know, after the Civil War we had this and we had that.
We haven't got crap, okay? You still have a bunch of people living like in 10th class
conditions, well, with a 40th class education and that's the way the establishment loves it.
That's the way the white establishment will be loving it and that's the way they want to keep it.
And that's why they let a few dark folks vote. That's it, that's where they draw the line.
Because if they let too many in, that's one area where the dark folks is certainly a hell of a lot more.
Because the Democratic Party may have done a hell of a whole lot for the dark folks over the years,
but they sure is how they're a lot safer than the Republicans.
No question about it, just like certain other groups I've mentioned,
and then it gets me all whipped up thinking about those Jews for Israel. The Israel firsters, you know?
Like the guy I was talking to this morning, but I don't want to mention his name again, Bill.
Everything is about Israel. If you love Israel so much, go live there. Okay, go take a few bus rides, see if you
survive. Can we send them the direct if they're serving for food over there? We get out of our face.
Anyway, getting back to important things. Professor Suzy asked for coffin photos.
And this is important. You want to know why it's important because this is part of the whole
manipulating of the public some minds. Oh, we don't want to have public to see that because it reminds them,
and it's bad for troop morale. I'm sure the troops are not aware of the fact that their
fellow soldiers dying all around them all the time. They've been out of wear that. It's a big secret.
A journalism professor Suzy, the government,
yesterday to force the Defense Department to release pictures of flag-grade coffins of soldiers
arriving in the U.S. from more overseas.
Ralph Biglighter, professor at the University of Delaware, and a former World Affairs
correspondent for CNN. Remember him? I remember him.
No. Well, I do.
Files soon under the Freedom of Information Act to release the government photos and videos of
coffins arriving at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, the Pentagon has steadfastly refused to release
these photos, saying it has begun enforcing a policy installed in 1991 and tend to respect the
privacy of the families of the dead soldiers. Right. Critics come to the government is trying to
hide the human cost of the war from the public. It's bad PR, baby, when the public turns on their
nightly news and sees those flag-grade coffins because there's bound to be dead bodies inside.
Their public records, Biglighters Attorney Daniel Mox said in the telephone interview,
this is about the public's rights to know the implications of U.S. foreign policy and to assess
the price of war. Biglighters' lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington,
listed the Defense Department and the Air Force's defendants, a Pentagon spokeswoman to
climb comment on lawsuit of course, they're just in mum.
Lies day for the Air Force release scores of photos taken to Dover in response to an FOIA
request from the Information Act. The pictures include shots of the same of the coffins,
some of the coffins of the astronauts who died last year in the space shuttle Columbia,
the Pentagon later called that release a mistake. But we don't want you to see no coffins.
Bad. Biglighter filed a FOIA request and the Pentagon's acknowledged receiving it but is not
responded further. The lack of response enables Biglighter to sue, he says.
Yeah, I guess that's what happens when people don't respond. You have to sue their ass.
You know what I mean? No, what do you mean? I'm familiar with that kind of stonewall and crap.
5670560.560 and they've arisen in singular wireless lines. Let's get about 20,000,
30,000 calls in between two and now and two. What do you say?
Yes, you bet. WQA and hello.
Hey buddy. What's up? How you doing sir?
Before I give you my nomination for your poll, I would like to direct you to thesunstentals.com
website where there is a state, there is a state investigation going on against a certain
shutter company that shined all its customers 72 hours before a hurricane. Really?
So I would like you to check that out and my nomination for the poll is Brian Adams.
Oh, good one. Thank you. Okay, thank you. I mean, I've grew into like Brian Adams but it's
uh, where's the key? Oh, here you go. Wow. Look at that. I wonder which company this was.
Is yeah, I don't even know the name of that company. The one that did my stuff that didn't show up
until like five days after the fact. Yeah, I'm sure your friend Adam will know.
You know, Adam, that does not have any responses running in the show anymore.
Let's see. I don't think that's it. Do you know the name of the company?
Uh, not right up here. No, I'll top my head. Well, this is voyton beef. So, but nevertheless,
it's an idea. It's very, very sad, especially in times of emergency and people give you some,
but that's the Florida F and way. I would say a huge percentage of businesses generally do
things like, oh yeah, we're going to be over a week from Friday at two o'clock and then maybe
like three weeks from Sookas, they might show up if you're lucky. If it's convenient for them,
because the dog doesn't have wild diarrhea. WQA and hello.
Yeah, yes, sir. Hey, how you doing today? Okay, how you doing?
I'm going to go to the alley. Listen, we better hope Dick Chene doesn't drop dead during the debate
because what'll happen is George Bush is salivating for the same thing he'll put
on the table. But um, McCain up there and that'll be the end of the election.
Good, I was thinking you're right. Good. Like I said, I hope that the vice president is in the
picker health until after the election.
And then, and then closing you. Yes, I'm weighing off up and I approve this message.
All right. Excellent. That was good. See, I told you, you have so little confidence just because
I know you get more intellectual cars than I do. That's what they always say.
Oh, George, you know, this gets the crazy. I'm out.
Who said that? I don't know. Somebody always says maybe George will be on very soon.
By the way, my vacation starts on Friday for a week.
Actually, a little more than a week. I'm doing that scam I used to do. I've got to stop.
I let them off to go to easy. I need a lot more vacation days. Absolutely.
Slyther. Yes. Somebody QA and hello.
Yes, hello. This is Shane Collins from Miami Beach. I just want to inform you guys
of another election joke by this state. Okay. Okay. I went to the Department of Motor Vehicles
to renew my driver's license. Right. They told me that I could register to vote when I did that.
Which I did or thought I did until last night because I'm thinking, you know, there's a chance
that this state could screw my my registration up. So I went to the website for voter registration
information for the state of Florida and I called Dave County's department handling such affairs
dealing with our registration. You know what they told me that I was not registered to vote.
And you know what the response was given to me by the joke, the clown on the phone, the woman on
the phone down at the Dave County election supervisors. Yeah. Office was that, oh, I'm sorry,
we've lost some of the paperwork from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Oh, beauty.
So again, I don't know what's going on, but last I heard the Department of Motor Vehicles were
located up in Calahasty. Was it not funded and overseen by, was it Jeff Bush and his friends and
Cronie? Pat asked Governor Jeb Bush. They probably have like a psychics there who know they made
money. You go down there. They look at you and see who they think you're going to vote for.
And if they think you might have hope for Bush, they throw it out. Well, my question is,
how many other people went to the Department of Motor Vehicles in Dave County and were told they
should have voted and taken great. They're going to go to the polls and November. Guess what?
They're not going to be able to vote. Probably 1000 bucks. Probably 30,000 at least.
This is something that needs to be discussed. I don't know if you can take this around with this or
who would be interested in this story, you know. What do you mean take it and run with it? What are we
going to do about it? I mean, you know, you can call your own colleague, huh? We got to let people know
that there's a six in right now. I mean, he's bound to be a person. We have stories about the
fixed being in every single day. This Glenda in a hood. She's just another Catherine Harris.
That's all. She's just another snooze for a fat ass jet Bush and they're going to do everything
in their power to eliminate any votes that they think might not go to Bush. So the best answer we
can get from the state is that oops, we lost some paperwork. There you go. Oops. We lost it again.
As Britney Spears would say, oops, we lost it again. It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. We're carrying
2004, baby. All right, Pallee. How do you like that? I'm sure there going to be a lot more stories
than come on November 2, which we of course will be on here that day. Just like last election,
we were on the air getting calls from people that one woman, especially in Palm Beach. I think I
just voted for Pat you can and I'm going to kill myself. Remember that? Yeah. How can we forget?
That was the first inkling that we had even made it on the notoriously self-hating flood report
on the internet that a woman had called in saying that the ballot was all screwed up in Palm Beach
and she was intending to vote for Gore and Wanda voting and says you think there's a
that Theresa LaPort and a butterfly ballot. I'm going to tell you something, man. This corruption
in the state of Florida, somebody needs to come in there and straighten their ass out. Thank God
that you're there and I'm here. That's all I can tell you. What a wasteland, what a swamp, what a
toilet, what a no-count budgetary redneck goofballs. See, I didn't use any of those words yet.
You were thinking of though. Yes, I was. In fact, those are the only ones that I was thinking about.
See, the until the thought police come and you can still think the words you just can't say
on. What's the thought police come in? You're S-O-L. 12 minutes after noon at 5, 16 W-Q-A-M, we've got

If you'll Canada you think that you're in luck.
All the world's their game. Cause your own sports really suck. You've got dogs fed runs.
You should lose with guns. What a way to enter pain. And you fish for ice. You think hot
he's nice. Cause it's played without a brain. Who can. Oh.
No.
Give me my old song. Game my mom. It's back now.
The space ball in Canada makes me a blue child.
From A.C. and How long before they finally decide? Or you can't play that puking thing either.
Cause that's X-Fee Tourie activity. We're puking over here. Yeah.
We're still can. Of course, a belch in one.
Huh? Or the nose ball. Oh, don't get telling me that.
You think it's permissible, but it's not.
Anyway, move on right along. Now, it depends on which pool you like.
All depending on who you're yanking for. President Bush has continuously
to the center of John Terry Mung likely voters. Despite surging enthusiasm for care.
This is from the where is this Washington Post.
Despite surging enthusiasm for care among Democrats and new dots about whether the
president has a clear plan, a clear plan to deal with the enite mayor in Iraq.
Quite a Washington Post tracking pool. In the aftermath of last week's debate among those
most likely to vote according to the Washington Post and ABC. Carry 50.
Oh, let's see. Bush 51, carry 46 among those most likely to vote.
Ralph Nader, 1% of the hypothetical. Nader, I gotta get enough votes to even figure earlobe.
But Bush held owning a three point advantage among all registered voters down from seven points
in the survey conducted right before the debate. Got that? Got it.
I'm not gonna waste my time with all the ins and outs in the details. You go online and see it.
I think we got it online. It's not too bad. We had a lot of good pictures though on there.
For those who can't read and don't want to be bothered reading. We need a lot more people
reading those bedtime stories on there. We're just gonna discard those and just put naked pictures
on there. Now, we're just gonna turn it into a porno site. What's wrong with that?
It's already the whole site is already too uh uh just uh discussing in protest for QA to be
involved with it. That's why they took a link down. What was it all about? What was the
thing that we had on there that broke the camel's ass? Oh, I remember it all. Yeah, it's something
that was on there and not a big deal. Well, QA didn't want to be associated with that near Roger's
site because it's a... Well, that's right. It was corporate. They came up with that crap.
What a bunch of nose pickers man. And so we dropped the link. You know, they hit us so we hit
them back. We dropped their link and of course we get more response in five minutes on our website
than they do in five years. As a matter of fact, if you look at the Alexa graph, on some days they
get response when the dolphin game is on Mertzennel in real soon. And the rest of the week,
not enough even not not even like a fart. Not that much of an impact like a silent fart. Nothing.
Oh, now you know something I'm thinking can we play that? That doesn't have any farting noises in it.
Silent fart? Yeah. No, it's just the silent. Well, wait a minute. Let's let's give it a shot. I'm just trying to think of a...
It sounds like a snake. Oh, silent fart.
Yeah. No, what do you think? That's a snake man.
A snake in your mouth. Correct. Don't wow. Now, one of the jirbles moved out. Sports.
Now, this is according to the New York Times, I believe, is that what this is from you. Senator John
Kiri came out of the first president until the late having reassured many Americans
of his ability to handle international questions or any terrorist attack. It would be generally more
favorable image, but he failed to shake the perception that he panders to voters in search of support.
The full also found significant doubts about President Bush's policies in Iraq with the majority
of the public's same US invaded too soon and the administration did a poor job thinking through
the consequences of the war. The Mr. Bush maintained an advantage on personal characteristics
like strong leadership, but the liberal and likeability as well and the enthusiasm is supporters.
How sad. Four weeks from election day, which is today, four weeks from today, boys and girls,
this is the day the Michael Moore DVD comes up and a video is turned here by you,
Fahrenheit, 9, 11, gotten by 100 copies. Four weeks from election day, the presidential race is
a dead heat again according to the Times with Mr. Bush having given up the gains he enjoyed for
the last month after the Republican convention in New York, the poll found and a head they had
matched up on a three-way race including Ralph Nader, the contenders each one 47% of the
registered voters surveyed the poll. 47, 47, and eight or it doesn't even say what, like one, one or
two percent. Last month, just a month ago, Bush led carry in the same poll 50 to 42 in a two-way
race and 50 to 41 in the few areas so he blew a nine-point lead in just after the debate, just in the
first debate. Okay? And actually, for all these great spots there to hang the air like the moment,
they just got Bush and picked you on there and they talk about the thousand dead soldiers and
about what a bozo we're looking at and all that stuff. So, God only knows what kind of stuff.
It's on Edward's shoulders tonight, man. I just hope they don't choke too many
closups of that big chanker on his upper lip. That's not too attractive. You know the one I mean
when it looks like about the bowling ball and his lips, yeah, it's like a growth. Yeah, like a huge
gigantic something from outer spaces we're on his lip. 567-0560, pound 56 on the horizon and singular
wireless lines. WDQA and hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. I want to keep it in the help me out here
on this TVF rather gate thing. Yeah. Didn't the Supreme Court rule in a Fox News case? You can
pretty much make up the news and lie wherever you want to do that. No, that's only Fox can do that.
Not CBS. Oh, I figured. I just want to make sure. Only fastest news that we're seeing do that.
All right, well, I just wanted to clear it up for him. Thank you, my friend. Okay, glad we
straightened out for you. It's right. Anybody who's to the left of a toll of the hunt, you got to
stick with a straight narrow path. Okay? And then you see the thing with Brokall and Peter Jennings
in the neighborhood at time that's whatever their thing was dog and pony show and we support
that. Well, why not? Danny never stole a freight train. So he hates push the more power to him.
That's why I watch CBS news because I'm going to get a lot of truth out of there. Plus, I'll get a
little bit of a leftish or leaning on there. Why does everybody it's okay for for every you know
and have a whole network that's right wing lies. Like I told somebody this morning, I want to
make some bill by name. You know, the Fox is only watched by a bunch of right wing Nazis. That's
all by people who are just in Chanoveracra. He has a this guy is obsessed with Bill O'Reilly.
Well, a lot of people like Bill O'Reilly and I shouldn't say a lot of people like Hitler too.
You know, a lot of people don't like Bill O'Reilly. Let me tell you about Bill O'Reilly's radio
ratings in the South Florida market. It's still a 0.2. You couldn't find his audience with a
road map out of compass. Okay? With a five million member search party, you couldn't find the
Bill O'Reilly audience in South Florida. Even at badass rush, you numbers are drafted by the way,
since his bill popping has to pay came out and that death prod definitely sprung me head from
popping all in pills. Well, you know, when you look back at that again, how easy he got off.
Do we hear anything more about that? Absolutely nothing. Have it or another word about that.
There's nothing going to happen. And the fact that he was popping pills in Dr. Shopping
all the Southern crap, that's that's what it is. You know, but the fact that he's such a hypocrite
and going on here and puffed up getting all those drug people ought to be put behind bars and
we have to do something about these low life, these scum of the earth and all the Southern crap,
you know? Careful. I know what I said. All right. I didn't associate any word with that thing,
with that thing. Although I tell you one thing, when you put chicken soup in a container and put
in the refrigerator, right? And you take off the lid the next morning and you look inside.
You know what's on top of the chicken soup? Scum. Right. And you're drinking that. How do you
like that? Talk about that. Talk about chicken fat. I got a, I got a, a ziplock bag. No wonder all
of us Jews are dying from poor arteries, huh? But I do love dealing. I'm just a dietary Jew. And
let me just say this too. How about ethical Judaism? That's the only part that's still the ass
religion that I care about. Since the others are so much more than the ligament. Most of them. Although
I've seen the Israelis are busy bombing in Gaza, can you see that? This is it. Unabomacronding.
They did it. They hit us. We hit them back and it's never going to stop. Do I know
any moisture time? In fact, we shouldn't even have news coverage anymore about what's
happening in the Middle East. Israelis and Palestinians forget about it. Okay, they've been killing
each other for five thousand years. We got to figure fish to fry. I'd like to forget it.
But we'll know it often. It's ever went again. There's some fish to fry.
WQAM. Hello. I love to have a clip of Dave once that's in. I'm frying over here. QAM. Hello.
Katie. Yes, ma'am. Although she's not a part of tonight. How about Katie Lang for your call?
Katie Lang. She's our man. She's our girl. Thanks. They have a good day. Okay.
Hey, she'll burst that call off a little bit.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Katie.
Rosa.
A mannequin woman.
She's my man.
A mannequin woman.
No, there's no need.
Hey, and keep her hanging around my floor. She's ready anytime I want to score.
She never says I'm up in the mood. I never got a tunnel around. I'm true.
My woman.
Doctor.
I can't say.
A mannequin woman.
Katie's what a lady.
A mannequin woman.
I just see.
A mannequin woman.
Never crossed to sleep.
I just saw my knock on the pond.
My door.
She's a girl I fell in the clothing store.
I feel like here.
Then most guys.
When I'm right in the middle of plastic.
My woman.
Doctor, something just said.
A mannequin woman.
A mannequin woman.
Hey, one of the.
Yeah, kid, baby.
I'm sure we didn't chop dinner for off there.
1232, if I wasn't the reason I was distracted there when we came back from the break is I was looking at the great news on our website.
Even almost bigger and better than the Rickman Print Offensive Line leader of the free world.
Is that the free world?
No. It's up to the right on our website.
There is George W. Emily Pinocchio.
It's a beautiful thing.
Everybody in the free world must take a look at that way. You're still allowed to see it.
I spent all day with that thing.
Anyway, now this thanks from our friend Jean Rodgers says Canadians Neil Diamond.
He's Canadian.
I don't know.
Oh my god, how embarrassing.
Neil said DACA is Canadian.
I don't know. He still went up to me.
And then he says the guy that's saying Diane in the 50s can't remember Paul Anker's name.
I mean, how can you not remember Paul Anker?
I would have hanged.
No, that's a John Edwards.
Paul Anker. Now that I'm sure is correct.
He was a Canadian by way of Lebanon or somewhere like that.
Paul Anker. I don't know. We'll have to look up Neil Diamond and Neil said Acre.
Here's another good one that we know for sure.
Allianz Morsez.
Right. Got that?
Got it.
Allianz.
What are you?
Paul's Anker's.
We can't even say the name of that.
Can't say I am my baby.
Why not?
We can say the name of the real song.
I was just playing the parody.
Oh, the bit. Oh, don't be doing that.
Now speaking of Fox, I'm going to just pass this along now because that previous column
that was saying about Fox News, the court rule that they can make up whatever the hell they want.
There's no obligation to tell the truth.
See, nobody expects the truth from Fox because we know it's the Nazi news network.
But anyway, between Evand and Hoover, the editor of the nation says today, Fox rejects the nation.
Do we have this one on today or is this one going on tomorrow? I forget.
Josh. Josh.
Josh. Yeah.
Fox rejects the nation.
Between Evand and Hoover, the nation should be on there today.
Is I don't know whether I may be on there, maybe on tomorrow.
I don't know when I send it to you. Probably this morning.
Probably this morning.
Oh, my God. Talk about double talk.
This guy makes bush-luck-like and articulate clear, whatever.
Anyway, she writes the Fox News channel ran a splashy full pay debt in our recent GOP convention issue.
In fact, Fox has bought several ads in the nation last year, including our back page,
leading some 50 readers to cancel their subscriptions and protest to the magazine,
taking what they considered tainted money.
Though we stand by our advertising policy, one which starts,
with a presumption that we will accept advertising,
even if the views expressed our repentance of those of the editors,
blatantly misleading ads, or ads providing harmful products, will fall into a gray area of discretion.
But as a general principle, we assume our readers will have sufficient knowledge to judge for themselves,
the merits of commonly known products such as cigarettes.
In contrast, Fox News seems to believe its viewers must be protected from news free of White House spin and corporate agendas.
More the cowardly line than they fall fierce Fox, the cable news network,
has just rejected a 60-second TV ad that the nation was planning to wear during the Republican National Convention.
Nobody owns the nation, not time-worn, or not Murdoch, the commercial said,
so there's no corporate slant, no White House spin, just a straight dope.
Fox rejected the ad out of hand according to the magazine's senior vice president for circulation arts STUPAR,
after our ad agency sent a commercial to the network.
I find it ironic STUPAR trove the New York Times, which wrote about Fox's censorship,
there the GOP cable station had championed the free markets,
and they got spooked into thought of running an ad that doesn't publish spin,
or serve the agenda of corporate conglomerates.
Good mention to Mr. Murdoch, it had been a problem,
a man who takes money from some of the worst regimes in the world can't take a few bucks from the nation.
Cowardly Fox may be running scared,
but the ad appeared in time-worn as CNN,
as well as NBC, Universal MSNBC, and Bravo during the Republican National Convention Week.
You can also click here, and she's got a link that you can click to watch this spot online,
and thanks to the readers, now there's a contributed money to a lost area, so there's Katrina.
So you can click it on the other thing when we get it on there.
How do you like that?
Picking and choosing.
Oh no, we don't want your money, we don't want the...
You know, you have to try this here, because we don't want to put your left-wing propaganda on our right-wing network.
We look up Neil Diner and Neil Sinecchi at or what?
Josh is looking at him up.
We'll take your time, we got to let that happen.
We're going to have an hour and 24 minutes for who's counting.
Oh, Miss Elton John takes angry swipe of Madonna,
are we supposed to care about this?
What's to be care more about this?
Scott and Lacey Peterson are out in Madonna.
Out in Madonna.
I don't care about that, the face.
I don't care if a flying crap about Scott and Lacey Peterson,
if ever in the history of this next to Alien,
I cannot imagine any non-political news story that's gotten over-hyped to the extent
between Larry King and what's in the Nancy Grace.
It just makes you want to get on your hands and ease and puke up meals
that you ate 20 years ago.
It's just disgusting, it's a sickling.
Yeah.
Who the hell gives a flying crap about Scott and Lacey Peterson?
At least Sean Relivi and Gary Condewitt,
at least there was something they're good with that.
And now an update on the Sean Relivi story.
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I'm just saying, this later, try it.
I made it.
Oh, I love this.
I love this.
I love this.
Otherwise, he's probably a dumpster.
This is a very good friend of both of us.
Yeah.
But in the other one.
Yeah.
What the hell ever happened to Sean?
Did he steal that?
Where is Wolf dressed in a suit?
The Congress had a male prostitute.
Right around his limb, or without wearing pants,
if you start taking him as a hell of a chance,
he'll change your life.
I'll tell you enough to be a woman.
He was white, then he flips, doesn't it all change?
It's not a night.
That's what it's like if you're a Gary Scale.
I'll try it on here.
I'll help you if you're Gary Scale.
That's who you're going.
You're going just like that.
All the women say.
It's a kind of a cliche.
If you write down your name,
it is a little black,
but they might call you from the river
and call you from the indivisible.
It'll change your life.
It'll tell you we love you a lot.
It's white, then he flips, doesn't it all change?
It's not a night.
That's what it's like if you're a Gary Scale.
I'll try it on here.
I'll help you if you're Gary Scale.
It's not a day.
You mean we're here one more word about that?
No.
No, because they found out that he didn't do it.
It was like, oh, that's so fun.
Right.
We don't care about him no more.
We don't care about her.
The bitch had a coming of it, only.
And what was the other one I was talking about before
that we never heard another word?
Oh, yeah, rush.
But the pill popping.
And the will might all have stuff.
Not another word.
They all whipped up about these stories.
It's so important.
And if I meet the double brand,
then the Sunstay is milked for all they can.
And then we move out of the next historical story,
do you sure?
British pop veteran, Elton John.
He's getting to be a real wild lady lately.
Took a far-mouth swipe of Adani yesterday.
I thought I wanted to defend Madonna, but what the hell is her problem?
Elton.
Saying she cheated her fans by mimeing on stage.
But the American pop superstar was swift to rubber-sizzle accusation,
saying she does not lip sync or criticize other artists.
While collecting a songwriting award from Q Music Magazine in London,
Elton suddenly launched into a tie-way to get to Madonna.
And we discovered she had been nominated for the Best Live Act.
Anyone who lip syncs in public on stage when you pay $134 bucks
to see them should be shot, John said,
and reference to ticket prices for Madonna's reinvention tour.
Madonna, Best Effing Live Act, F Off said the singer we-
Oh, like I said, he's okay.
Said the singer we now is much for his outrageous outbursts,
his ears for his outrageous outfits.
Since when has lip syncing been live, he asked.
He ended his outburst by saying that's me off her effing Christmas card list.
But do I give a toss? No.
Do I give a toss?
That's a great thing.
Oh, I know.
His tie-way prompted a swift response from her,
US spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg.
Rosenberg.
Boy.
What if she's one of those, what's those do's?
Polosches.
No, no, the ones that she's into in Brittany and on that old cabalist.
Yeah, she's a cabalist.
Liz Rosenberg said in the statement, Madonna does not lip sync
nor does she spend time trashing other artists.
She's saying every note on her reinvention tour live is not a shame
that she was well paid for her hard work.
And Madonna 46 showed she was not taking transcriticism too seriously.
Elton John remains under Christmas card list,
whether he's nice or naughty, the statement added.
Madonna lost out to British fan news for the live act title, thank God.
Elton hit the headlines in Taiwan last month,
when confronted by a wall of flashing cameras at Taipei Airport,
he lashed out at the local media call of him, rude, vile pigs.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
The televisions and photographers at the airport
were the rudest people I've ever met.
I've been to 60 companies, the 57-year-old queen said,
his partner David Furnish.
I wonder if they live in a furnished joint.
Has memory capture the flamboyant star at his most outrageous
demanding and flounderable documentary,
appropriately named, Tentrums and T-Rs?
The tour seems a real runnyard.
Corrections, and perhaps we can run this game now, ma'am.
That's the further reveal.
Buffalo Stealth, Puts, OOOH!
Super Starman's Otter, made seamless,
wearing nothing but silver dresses and metal collars.
But when it comes to cash, let me tell ya,
this block baby is high with a bump,
but not a dozen travel-first-class no.
It's sent to your body and juke in a box.
Sterely, fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy,
but your body is a box, you know, you know, you got to
stare at it, scratch your fancy,
they could fight for both real and sex.
When you accidentally buy the tip of the dust,
you'll scare how you get there,
be just like Sean Finsett,
and early morning pick-up,
with an overnight delivery guarantee.
Get down to the jerry-solo,
cram-t in the spray,
then what you want to hear across,
you know, you know, you got to stare at it,
scratch your fancy,
they could fight for both real and sex.
Here's our 1246-560-W2A.
I'm here's the ideal,
who's your all-time favorite Canadian celebrities?
Our poll question 4 to 92 votes.
Comsi Comsa.
Well, I don't think we got to pull up there
till I have to love it a ton,
because we came out like at 10.40,
and we had all these other fish to fry.
I love it a ton, that's not too bad.
John Candy's got 100, nobody's gonna touch fat John.
Mike Myers 68, Jim Carrey 53,

William Schander 36, Michael J. Fox,

Avril Lavigne 12, Chennai at 2011,
Burton Cummings of the Guess Who 10,

The only thing I like,
nah he was in a couple of good movies,
but the reason the body snatchers
right at the middle,
at the very end of the movie.
That was good.
Raymond Murray, is he a thief?
What?
Huh?
Van Acquodate, Celine Dion's got eight.
Oh God, that is sad.
Martin Short 7, and Murray,
he's got seven,
but there's a lot of confused gender

Keeper 7 and 5,
Van Acquodate, 5,

I still know who the hell
Donald is.
He's comedian.
Right, can't stand him.

and look at,
no votes yet for Katie.
Katie Lang, oh no!
Allying is more set,
and he writes,
Josh,
is this like a generational thing
is at the problem?
Instead of K-period deeper,
he's got Katie, K-A-T-I-E,
she and Katie, okay?
I thought his car was the music.
I understand,
I like kind of music,
either, but I'm just telling you right now,
she ain't no Katie.
She went,
we were like,
no lady either.
That's for sure.
Anyway, Chrony,
Sharrow,
Stanis Chrony,
he's got a ton of time now.
Stanis Chrony is the big debate
set up in Cleveland,
I think one and only vice presidential
debate is John Edwards,
will be there with that big thing on his look,
and Dick Chan will be there
with his stumping and puking heart.
This is from the nation also as a matter of fact,
as he wrote this,
somebody wrote it,
as he prepared to debate Haliburth
and CEO,
turned by President Dick Chan,
Senator John Edwards,
would do well to study up on his Harry Truman.
The buck stops here,
President had a word for war profiteering,
treason.
He had another word for those
political and business leaders
who condoned waste,
inefficiency,
mismanagement,
and profiteering during a time of war,
on patriotic.
If John Terry's Renny
may have once had a greater impact
in his debate with the vice president,
which follows hard on the first presidential debate,
then did he woefully,
an ectrolieberman when he faced Haney in 2000,
Edwards has to drop the fake friendliness
of the Washington A. Leeds,
whom Truman so disdain,
in favor of blunt talk about Chaney,
starting with his Haliburthan connections.
Haliburthan's been experiencing
a growth spurt ever since Chaney passed
to the revolving door of Washington politics,
to set up the administration
and manages for George W. Bush.
The Texas-based corporation moved
the number one on the armors listed top-con factors
in 2003,
pocketing $4.2 billion taxpayer debt,
and $1.2 billion dollars last year alone.
It got one no-bid contract after discussion
in which Chaney's chief of staff,
Lewis Scooter-Libby,
was involved,
despite serving revenues,
however, the Haliburthan unit
doing work in Iraq is played
by so many problems
from mismanagement to allegations of corruption
that may be spun off
to try to salvage
what's left of the parent company's reputation.
If Edwards brings Haliburthan up
during his debate tonight
with the Chaney Cleveland,
the vice president will undoubtedly claim,
as he has,
whenever he's been challenged,
that he no longer has any connection with Haliburthan.
Edwards can counter
with another of those blunt truminisms,
Liar.
The vice president continues to receive money
from Haliburthan,
178,000 plus in 2003 alone,
and congressional research service study
has described the sort of deforet salary
payments he received,
and the millions in stock-opcancy retains,
as among those benefits described
by the Office of Government Ethics
as retained ties or linkages
to one's former employer.
In other words, Chaney has a great big conflict of interest,
and powdering a way
and it will go a long way
to exposing the crony capitalism
that's been the hallmark
of the Bush administration.
Edwards should talk about the other troubling aspects
of Chaney's tenure too,
as Nation-Marcman Correspondent John Nichols explains,
in his new book,
Dick Leman,
who is president,
most of the pathologies
of the Bush administration
can be traced back to Chaney,
who chaired the correct energy task force,
and pressed Bush to make a second round of tax cuts
for the rich,
which then for his secretary,
Paul O'Neill,
were unwise and unsound.
This is the armchair warrior,
who is a college student,
collected five draft deferments
to avoid serving in Vietnam,
but who entered the White House campaigning for war
on Iraq and never let up.
Since the 9-11 attacks
are with increasing ferocity
during the current campaign,
Chaney has served as Bush's
scare-monger-win chief,
evoking images of thousands of Americans
killed by terrorists
with nuclear weapons,
and seeking to justify
the invasion of Iraq
by repeating thoroughly discredited claims
that Sodom Hussain's regime
was working without Kaita.
By making a link in the minds of voters
between the excesses of Halibut
and the deteriorating situation in Iraq,
Edwards can help refocus the campaign
on the questions that matter.
Among them,
which presidential team
can be trusted to put the needs of Americans
before their own interests
and those of their friends
Chaney has made it very clear
where his loyalities lie.
That's pretty good stuff
from the nation, eh?
What did I tell you before?
The biggest curse in the world today,
Dick Chaney.
He makes Sylvia Burluscoti
in Italy look like a study-school preacher.
That's the kind of cook you got with Dick Chaney.
They don't call him Dick for nothing, okay?
Just leave it at that.
Joyce.
5-6-7-0-5-6-2.
Well, that's his name, you know.
Count 5-6-2,
he only Verizon's
singular wireless lines.
Let's get a few of these.
Let's get a few thousand calls in here,
okay?
We get these people whipped up
into a frenzy.
Let's get them out there.
They're nearby a video store.
And please don't buy them blockbuster
because we hit them like poison.
But if you have to,
I don't think there's,
you think they're going to actually sell it?
I'm going to swing by Best Buy in it myself.
Best Buy?
They have good prices on the calendar.
They don't hire any of you.
And it's not something you have to wait for them
to list off the shelf right here.
No.
I mean Best Buy is fine.
Unless, of course, you want to go in there and get service.
You want to go in there and get service?
Help yourself.
It's self-right there.
Bring your own ladder and just play.
I'll buy it and see it right up there.
That's the DVD player right up there.
Just go over there to the glass catter
and stand there and wait,
take a number.
And if you can live till next year,
but this maybe we'll get to you.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay, Palli.
Hey, listen, I read a great article
in Vanity Fair.
Right.
I said it on the piquate it.
And the article basically,
what would happen is,
Bush won a second term.
Oh, God.
And yeah, I know it was dreadful,
but it was a good spin to it
because it really talked about
how over the past 40 years,
every second term president
has some sort of scandal
that gets them pretty much knocked out.
And I was just trying to think back
and if you recall,
what was the last president
you thought that had a successful second term?
I'm thinking,
Flynn had his scandal.
Reagan had his...
Well, what about Iron Hauer?
Yeah, I mean,
that's how far back you really have to go.
I mean, I used to have an hour
and had a couple of scandals
that were like minor.
There was a Nixon with the gifts
and I was forgetting what the guys name was.
There were a couple of those minor scandals in there,
but nothing major like a watergate
or a penis gate or something like that.
I know.
And the article also talks about how...
The story.
So a lot, or the liberals,
or my side anyway,
would be even stronger
to come the next election up in 2008
because...
We can't wait until 2008, okay?
I know.
I'm going to tell you right now,
Bush wins this time.
There may be no election in 2008.
And don't forget that not too many weeks ago,
they were already saying,
well, you know, we may have to postpone the election.
They kind of like put out a little trial balloon there
to see if that would fly.
And everybody said,
over our dead body, you'll do that.
Yeah.
But I do have an interesting article.
If you have an opportunity,
maybe take a look at it
and maybe take a couple of snaps at it.
It's just interesting reading.
And I just like to pass on that word.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
All right, good.
See you.
5.6.705.16.
I mean, they did refer to it as...
...beep, see what I'm saying?
Yes, sir.
You didn't dump that now, did you?
No.
Okay.
Is there a check in here?
You never know, with an atmosphere
that kind of chill in the area we have now.
That's what will be dumping movie titles.
Well, that was a little horse of a different kind.
Right there on TV every week of the TV.
They've had it on a million times.
What?
I can push it? Yeah.
Oh.
It's James Bond moving in.
I understand that.
And so is the other one there.
So is the character in there where I would just
don't want to overdo that.
Okay, because then,
Duff is going to start getting all upset.
They will have to play the Dumplinzi thing,
the Dumplinzi drop-ins,
and you're all upset during the start.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Actually, audio from Dumplinzi in a control room
with his headset on there during the dumping of the steering show,
which goes on 40, 50,000 of a visual.
Yeah.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Oh, sir.
My favorite Canadian.
I'm Anderson and Wayne Gritzky.
Pam Anderson is Canadian.
Yeah, yeah.
Very good.
Oh, I'll be now.
Well, thanks for the bad news.
Thanks a lot, Palli.
And Wayne Gritzky, what we can put him on,
he's not only an ex-athlete,
but he's a celebrity,
and he's a needle-nose idiot,
as far as I just don't like him.
I hate Wayne Gritzky.
Yeah.
Especially after he's speared Dougie Gilmore,
and I came number six in a playoffs there in 93,
whatever it had here it was.
Nice going, Wayne.
And every time Wayne would get hit,
he could dole.
And it's so little hell of a need.
Hold his head and go crawl him off to the bench.
Or somebody pressed me, somebody had the,
can't stand Wayne Gritzky.
But nevertheless, put him both on there, okay?
Speaking of needle-noses.
Yeah.
When you were playing with your bush picture,
you know, the follow the nose.
I mean, your target website there.
The new picture we have there.
Did you look on the Blair option at the bottom of it?
Oh, I didn't, I saw it, sir.
I didn't have time.
I was just ending, which is why when I came back,
I scoot up, whatever we were doing.
The nada dimension there, you'll enjoy.
So in other words, you can take a look.
I'm looking at it right now.
You can click on the picture above,
and you've got the bush leader of the free world
with the long schnauz, the Pinocchio nose.
Following the money, now click on Blair.
Well, just a second.
I'm getting for this to go out of here.
You do understand that our site's a little bit slower,
and that's because it's got as many good things on here.
So, in fact, it's not doing anything right?
Oh, there it is.
Look at the size of that thing.
Holy cow, that proboscis.
Can I say that?
I'll check.
I'll check the lexicon.
Oh, I see.
And the cursor is the dollar sign.
Right.
Now click on the work.
Oh, look at that.
And there's 20 blinds.
Oh, that is the best.
Yeah, then you can switch it back.
He didn't go for no hard operation.
Went for a nose job.
You were listening to me, you need to meet your Rogers.
It's collusion wave.
Unfifix.
You need to meet him.
Bonus Papano.
Since he lives neither has one Natasha and I know you'll
have for no promotion squatter.
Instead, we listen to him.
And near Rogers' parent balance went for two hours.
So, he knows my nation's ended out.
Where is my busted old bow?
I was sort of a hit.
I go left off your edigrarmy and tell me no me.
But what the hell are all these other shows?
Many for taking me, me and bloos.
I like to kick him with my cowboy boots.
I'm not sure, but I don't think he ever warrants up so well.
What I have been to lie here is just a downright world still.
Or I have a world of bush putt and butt from the kids at Megaloy.
But that day no step I'm a genius.
I was the lion king.
Listen, how many his songs did many for taking?
Sing!
I'll say a song.
I'm more than out from looking at that.
I didn't realize that when you click on the Tony Blair with a big ear.
The bush head, in fact, if you watch it long enough, bushes head actually sits on the tip of Blair's nose.
It's a beautiful thing, man.
Everybody must hop on there immediately in the website too.
So Charles and Deerfield beats his under the heading of a side note.
A lot of people probably don't know that when he was at Yale, George Bush was a cheerleader.
And although some who show their main name, let's not look upon all male cheerleaders as girly men,
well, if it's good enough for Trent Lot.
Simply because they wear tight sweaters, jump up and down and shake pom-poms over their heads.
I personally have no problem with it.
And that's because if there's one area in which George Bush has been absolutely consistent throughout his entire life,
it's the fact that he's always preferred to stand on the sidelines, dealing with somebody else to get in there and kill him.
He did it at Yale. He did it again during Vietnam when he cheered the war on while at the same time doing everything he couldn't keep himself out of it.
And now he's doing it once again.
And this time he's got millions of his fellow idiots chanting right along with him.
There are, of course, a couple of minor differences between now and Bush's days at Yale.
For starters, at Yale, the guy in charge of the team made sure that every player was given all the equipment needed to protect him from harm.
And as well as took the time to plan strategy for winning before he sent anyone with a field of new battle,
then again, what's out as little as far as I can like me know.
Good back, Charles and dear people.
Be a nice job. You go, boy. Vote 30 or 40 times just to be sure.
I'm 30, man.
And we're all going to have to do a vote many, many, many times just to be on the safe side.
Because it's obviously stalled duggery that's become part and parcel of what's called voting in Florida is going to be really,
oh, they're going to have that thing geared up like crazy.
It's going to be an overdrive.
They're going to be working overtime, fat ass governor Bush and Glenda in the hood.
Probably can't inherit something and stuff over there for a little get her licks in too.
If he cares, my grip.
You drifted again?
Yeah, I'm drifting on it.
Oh, this is cute.
Senior CIA appoint you with draws over shoplifting.
Now, of course, it's an old charge but nevertheless.
This is somebody we can trust.
The man named by the new CIA director for the third highest position at the CIA said on Monday he would not take the job,
following reports that he was caught shoplifting more than two decades ago.
As a result of recent press articles and attendance speculation, I've decided that I cannot accept an appointment to see
I as the executive director Michael Kosto said in the statement, he will have a work at the agency as a senior adviser to the new director of Porter, Misha Goss,
the former Republican chairman of the House representative of the Audi Audi.
Oh, I was told to decide.
What?
How old was he when he was shoplifting?
10.
I would say.
3rd man.
Don't really say here.
Let's say his age.
An adult.
Let's put it there.
An adult.
Old nothing open.
Maybe he just did these things during his silly youthful days like in his 40s, like Bush, with all his snorten and whatever.
In fact, when you see that nose,
it's just a drop in the middle of it.
Man, man.
He can snort up the shopline in every football field in North America before he's done ridiculously.
You can get that thing.
Not that we would suggest that.
Looking ahead for John Edwards, where Dick Cheney, this is his last campaign,
but he's steady, he's solid.
He probably can articulate the Bush administration policy better than anybody, including the president.
So a lot of that state for both guys.
Yeah, Edwards is going to slice him up like a piece of halava.
You'll see.
We need a big saw.
WQA, and hello.
How about Tom Green, Neil?
Tom Green's a good one.
Thank you.
Oh, he's half the man he used to be with Tom Green.
What?
He's a nut.
Four Tom Green.
As a matter of fact, I'm inspired.
Now that's a very good choice.
That could be even more.
Those who just raspberries don't get panicking, you know.
Some of us remember Tom Green when he was actually funny.
Before MTV got a hold of him and did they him what they do to everything else they touched.
They ruined it.
They spoilt it.
I think it's Carson Davies fault.
In fact, I think if your dog drops a load on the carpet, that's Carson Davies fault.
If your kitten has diarrhea all over the, so far, that's your Carson Davies fault.

There we go.

That's the Carson Davies fault.
Absolutely.

Are you serious?
Absolutely.
And now Gordon Lightfoot takes the melody
from the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald and turns
up the heat on your favorite summer songs on his new
album, Gordon Lightfoot Sweats Out Summer.
Yes, Canada's own Gordon Lightfoot is heating up the Great

It's Gordon Lightfoot Sweats Out Summer.
Oh!
I'm dying over here!
Yeah!
Yeah, cool that fun.
Anyway, full faxes and says if we're going to do a hockey-related
people then we have to include Don Cherry.
Okay, put them on there.
By the way, how can we get Canadian TV down here with a big satellite there
without one?
Whether you can't get it on it or without it?
So, some really Jones and put it in your
channel.
Well, I can't give it in your channel, but I can give you a
I will celebrate our 21st vetting anniversary.
See, that was the show I'm trying to play
Frag.
The love for children is real.
Yeah, I'm trying to play Frag.
You have to get the consequence of that there.
Yeah, there was a lot of the firsts I've done.
There was a lot of things.
The firsts I've done.
Man, are they pigs?
You know what?
But anyway, that's another story.
And of course I'm sure you got a few of them still down there.
In fact, they're going to be coming very soon.
I hate to break news because the low-last night,
the low temperature here in the Montpier-Alts-A-Lot-Coder
Low is about 3 degrees, 38.
Hey?
That's who toasty.
This is a horrendous story.
Mother of soldier killed in a rack collapses and dies.
Her grief was so intense hospital worker says,
Tucson, Arizona.
A 45-year-old woman collapsed and died days after learning her
son had been killed in a rack and just hours after seeing his body.
Results of an autopsy were not immediately released, but
friends of Karen Unrawarra says she couldn't stop crying over
losing her 25-year-old son.
Army specialist Robert Oliver Unra was killed by enemy fire
near Baghdad on September 25.
Her grief was so intense, it seemed they could have harmed her,
could cause heart attack.
Her husband described it as a broken heart.
She had sheeral Hamilton manager, the respiratory care services,
and University Medical Center.
Unrawar combat engineer had been in the rack list in a month
when he was shocked when we were going to attack on his unit.
This is the kind of carnage that's going on for your sons and brothers
and daughters and their cousins and whoever else have been used
as a human sacrifice.
And the one thing that really was unfortunate during the debate last
Thursday was that John Kerry don't have the caulons or whatever day it was.
I don't have the caulons because it's not politically correct when they
asked him about, well, are you saying that this is a,
that these soldiers are dying for nothing?
And he said, oh, no, of course they are.
If it's an unjust war, it was based on a pack of lies, which it was.
How can it be dying for legitimate cause?
It's got absolutely nothing to do with fighting the war on terrorism.
It's got nothing to do with protecting America.
They're being used as a human sacrifice as pawns in his game
that the neo-cons are using.
To launch their peanut crap on the world.
And of course the public goes, I'm a little, well,
bush looks like this and Kenny looks like that and Kerry looks,
and Jonathan words got that big thing on his lip.
That's about the extent of which I would say about 70% of American public
can function and think is what they look like.
And that's why bush loss to the debates so bad because you look like Lunatic.
He looks like a bullfrog and a heap.
Like Rumble still skinned on a bad day, hunched over that podium.
They should change his meds.
Winsing and nodding and well, they should maybe let him have a little bit.
In fact, the one guy wrote that instead of that water in the glass,
he was reprimanded and was like Jack Daniels.
That might have come to none a little bit, but that's what he needed.
It wasn't that color.
Maybe he should have taken a flash out of his jacket pocket
and taken a little swig here we know.
And I guarantee you, man, gun-totin, pickup-druck-driving Americans,
they love that.
That's our president.
All right, you go, George.
Have one for me.
Oh, I don't want to get anybody scared.
We don't like people getting nervous over reaction.
Because that would be irresponsible and bad.
But patients in the US face disordered their flu vaccines
in the upcoming season after Shuron Corp announced today.
It won't be able to make any of the product due to regular-sword problems
with its British plan.
Oh, my God.
Shuron statement said a previously expected to provide an early half-US supply
of the flu shots for the next flu season 2004 and 2005.
It said it's discussing potential impact
with the US Food and Regum administration, those grave robbers.
And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
US public health officials said vaccine plans will be a hard hit
by the announcement if what I understand is correct
that that would be a significant disruption in supply
to Dr. Walter Orinstein, assistant director of the vaccine
Senator Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta
and former director of the National Immunization Program
at the CDC.
How do you like that?
A shortage of flu shots and hate traveling fewer people
are going to die from getting them.
Sounds good to me.
Speaking of people dying, am I...
I'm reading a whole lot of stuff here, but you know what?
That's okay.
I want to try to get this all in.
Don't have that many more.
Thank you.
Three, four, five, six, eight.
Who do we appreciate?
I've got a few.
Don't forget to go out there today here,
nearby a video store.
Don't waste any time.
No excuses.
You have to steal the money to buy that's okay, too.
Get the Furnite 9-11, the DVD.
Michael Moore's amazing documentary, which grossed over $80,000,000.
Roku all records for documentaries.
And it's got all kinds of extra footage in there, too.
Four U.S. soldiers charged with murder.
More of the collateral damage of this insanity,
this madness that your neocons have launched.
Having absolutely, positively, nothing to do with 9-11,
with protecting your ass or anything else.
Fort Carson, Colorado.
Four soldiers accused of smothering an Iraqi generator
and interrogation-less fall of in charge with murder,
bringing the total number of U.S. troops charged with murder
and a rack to release 10.
The soldiers could get life in prison without parole
if convicted in the November 26th death of major general
Abed Hamed, Mao Haush, 57, a time Iraq.
The army said Mao Haush died of a suciation
from chest compression from being smothered.
Kind of reminds me of that,
which one was it, Lionel Tate?
It was Lionel Tate.
I get confused with the thing of Brazil, I understand.
But well, the time was very similar, yeah.
The handling of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. troops
has become a worldwide scandal,
fed by images from the Abu Gharrad prison.
But Mao Haush's case is rare,
said Christopher Wilson from a military prosecutor
who died on private practice in California.
I don't know of any other case where a major general
got a suciation during its irrigation.
I doubt that's ever happened in the past 50 years he said.
The army gave no details of what the soldiers are alleged to have done,
but the Denver Post, studying unidentified military documents
reported earlier this year that chief warrant officers
Louis E. Wellshoff, or Jr., and Jefferson L. Williams,
stood a sleeping bag over Mao Haush's head
and rolled him from his back to his stomach-wise in questions.
Well, that sounds to me like a standard operating procedure.
Of course it is.
Also charged in the death were Sergeant First Class William Summer
and Specialist Jerry L. Loper.
He was just kind of loping along.
Sixth.
Speaking of criminals, by the way, well, the dolphins,
so do you think they got enough bad press already?
Nope.
Good.
Then I'll just hand it.
Well, this is the next dolphin anyway.
Not to be confused with Mercury and Morris.
Or, um, not easy, which, huh?
About easy?
No, no.
About Reese, he would know criminal.
He's just a boring guy.
Bobby Humphrey, Sammy Smith.
And the guy from Michigan State, which I can never think of what his name was,
was it Demetrius Underwood?
Was that his name?
Yes.
What about Cecil?
And Cecil Conn.
He was just trying to get a peek.
He was just trying to get a look.
However, somebody I know, unlike a lot, came on the air.
He was talking about defending the defenseless Humper.
Oh, he was just trying to get a look.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, if you see somebody interesting or you meet somebody on the street and you want to,
just kind of take a look and see what's going on there.
Maybe we just kind of crawl in through the window.
Anyway.
Well, in fact, isn't there something there I have to dump you?
I write the end very end.
What does he say?
Oh, yeah, about the PI word.
Because I do want to play that.
I'll gather it.
I'll take care of it.

Good morning.

Good afternoon.
Hey, that's right, afternoon, I'm sorry.
How you talking about seeing your website?
Most of the town here have a dopey of cable modems.
We can't get our computers up.
The modems are all still down.
Really?
Yeah.
I've been trying for three weeks to get my modem back up,
and they keep selling me the server sound.
I'll be done.
Well, that's a sound thought of for a man.
There you go.
You have to go on an internet cafe, is where you can get real computer.
Go to the phone line, sounds like.
Go to the phone line.
Go to the phone line.
Let me go, take care.
Bye bye.
How do you like that?
I didn't know that.
Starting to take it personal, weren't you?
Yeah.
Not that we're not getting good results.
We're spots on here, but not that way it should be like today, for example.
I mean, anybody that doesn't take a puke at the beaded curtain today,
not only for the fine picture of Charlotte Lewis, even if they have no idea who she is,
I like the picture, but the Requiem for an offensive line.
Man, the golfants may be offensive, but that picture is sure for a lot of folks out there.
Let me ask you right now what's not to like.
And then, of course, the leader of the free world with boy.
You can just sit there and play with that all day, and the picture too.
It's just going to drive you wild.
The nose nose, and the nose gross.
Isn't that that song?
By Edison Lighthouse, nobody knows where my rosemary is, nose gross?
Something like that.
I like that working.
I wish I could play it, but it's got that CD's all chopped up.
Remember I tried to play that?
Yes, and did.
And it's got a little bit of blood like that.
I did fix that thing real nice though.
You know how the lip is there on the tray?
The lip on the tray.
Yes.
I've figured it out real nice.
Nice going, Neil.
Thank you.
W.A.M. Hello.
I'm Neil Selph radio.
Q.A.M. Hello.
Hello.
We're together, right?
I think I have the answer.
I think we can at least respond until two.
W.A.M. Hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Oh, I just wanted to report that I picked up my copy of, sorry, 9-11, at Costco.
They have lots of copies, $18.19.
So I actually got two copies because once for me and once to lend out to people at work,
I think that it will all of us make sure to lend out our copies to undisturbed as voters.
I think we can have a real impact.
I hope.
Hey, and something else for George, please check your email.
I just sent you a photo.
I think that you will want to see, think Tom Brady.

Thanks a lot, Pally.

Oh, the entire crew.
He's a whole bunch of things, which is really amazing.
Oh, this is a cool thing.
Oh, man.
We love Cedar Cruz and some flora.
It's so bad that she's dead.
It's so bad.
Oh, how it's Cruz.
She was a community icon.
Oh, see that Cruz.
Remember that?
That's when I finally just lost contact with the Hispanic community when I had the goal.
You know, they gave up when you got on the site.
Yeah.
To rip the Cedar Cruz an ass.
You were so in tune with them before.
Right.
Now that's right.

Well, the Quad Cities channel eight will screw them.
They don't know how to do this.
Illinois and Wisconsin today are launching a program that was residents by cheaper refills

It actually shows it's genetically a pronoun, and he's a Goy, and his name is
Blood Glyavitch.
Plants to kick off the program today at a news conference with Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle.
They're starting this program despite federal laws banning prescription drug
importation.
They're saying, but I'm being up yours.
Under their plans consumers will use a website or tool-free number, full number to link them
to a Canadian-run clearinghouse that would provide information on costs of about a hundred of the most
common brand name drugs.
Consumers would then fax them here in the refill prescriptions which must pass the doctors
review before being filled by network pharmacy.
See here again, carries in favor of it.
Let's get those cheaper drugs, stop letting the drug companies rip off the public, and bush
of course, who's in bed with all of the big, I mean, new name it.
Any big corporations?
How's Kenny Borley doing, by the way?
You want to keep saying, you need to move the drugs exclusively on five-six- one-eighth-a-and.
The young is too young.
I've broken through her bedroom window.
And finally, I've just given my wig.
But I did not do who was crippled.
But that ain't doesn't do.
It's your play for the fish.
I guess my girlfriend forgot their candy.
And another bitch was someone else's wife.
A friend was living us that was pretty dead healthy.
And I found out, when it changed me with a knife, why didn't that bitch tell you?
I was too dark to see.
That's right.
She'd be in bed with her whole family.
It's a skeleton, this is not a beast.
That's what they'll be about.
Who just got the finger on her sweater?
No, it's not a monster.
We just got the last one.
143.
Poor Cecil, man.
He just wanted to take a look.
Just look, yeah, I'll go in there, take a look.
He was going on, which he looked like in the sack, and stuff like that.
Oh, and speaking of things in the sack, coroner says in Denver, removing man's organs was homicide.
And you want to know why?
Why?
He wasn't completely dead yet.
He was mostly dead.
A western Colorado coroner said yesterday that two hospitals allowed vital organs to be removed from a man.
They had proven before they had proven he was brain dead, and he declared that it's a homo side.
The cause of William Rardin's death was removal of his internal organs by an organ recovery team.
Matt Rose County, coroner Mark Young, said he said he didn't believe the case would be a criminal matter,
but that it should be the clarification of what the accepted standard is.
Oh, let's ask Terry Shival, maybe she's got the answer.
Rardin's heart, liver pancreas, and two kidneys were translated into waiting patients, and yet his brain wasn't dead yet.
Well, I can think a lot of people of QAN that if that were, if that was a standard.
They'd be popping eyes out by parts like crazy, you know, kidneys, bladders.
Bad news, by the way, I don't want to pee on anybody's parades, especially this close to election, just four weeks from today,
and with a big vice presidential debate coming up tonight, oil prices hit a new record.
About $50 a barrel today is a prolonged U.S. production outage.
Following Hurricane Ivan, it's directed first specter live buying.
Oh, no.
But thank you for those low gas prices, though, Mr. President.
U.S. light-cooked climbed 75 cents to 566 a barrel and London Brent crude, and there's nothing cruder than those brits,
rose 74 cents to 4693 a barrel.
Why is it that the brits have got such bad breath and such nasty teeth?
I guess they go hand in hand side by each.
Right, double-played.
God, they have got the nastiest teeth.
Gee, black, nasty, gross, and their teeth too.
Supply anxiety is building ahead of the Northern Hemisphere, winter, when demand for heating will all boy.
It's gonna be a long cold winter, baby.
When demand for heating will all surges, inventories of crude and distillates in the world's top energy user,
the U.S. are running as much as 4% below last year.
U.S. production has been slow to recover from Hurricane Ivan, and people are worried by the low-level crude and distill inventories.
I had a winter yachty on it.
Let's take a look on the gambling channel, which I've very sucked.
I avoided, asciitiously, whatever the hell that means.
Let's take a look at our customers.
But the dollar's down by 20.
Oh, oh no.
Crude oil is almost $51 a barrel, record $50.94.
$50.94.
Oh my God!
Holy moly, thanks for those low gas prices, Mr. President.
Thanks for that fantastic job you got of securing peace in the Middle East too.
You got a racquetag.
I noticed that those Israelis in the Palestinians are just, they're giving each other candy and flowers.
I wasn't a while some of that, but generally speaking, they're exchanging halava.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Palestinians are eating a humiliation come for them time, wouldn't you think?
No doubt.
WQAM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I thought they're, you know, speaking.
How are you, buddy?
Good, buddy.
How are you doing, Pali?
Good. I want to say that clear eyes that cancel less than me.
Yeah.
That's it.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Good. That's good news.
Clear eye guy canceled, which I say.
Oh, right.
Never watched it anyway.
See now, Raymond Bird, there was a good stereotype for our gay Americans, but naturally we were
able to see Paul in and all these screaming flamers on these Soviet shows.
It's really sad.
It's tragic.
It's just like, you know, fat Albert.
I mean, couldn't black people have a little bit better stereotype than, like maybe Barack Obama, for example.
And there you go.
An articulate, literate guy who was, yeah, I mean, I would say Julian Bond, but Julian
Bond was like, complex in the course of art 4.0.
He's not really even black, you know.
So what do we get?
We get like fat Albert and we get the rappers and all the, the low lives of the universe.
And that crap.
Well, that's what black people are about.
Well, of course it's not.
What is that?
It's like a self-fulfilling death wish is what it's like.
Not that we live in a racist country or anything like that.
You know, it seems like a real rotten piece of shit.
Listen, it's like something to see you, A.M.
Howard David's the bitch.
Let's go, Moonir.
Go, go, go, go.
She's finally slowly in hell.
Looks like the fight's a roadstack.
Now spread the body roll balls.
Barbara Bush has already fell, and I,
those other eyes, not now.
It's happened when she realized.
She raised more criminal crowds.
Barbara Bush has already fell, and I...
That she's pissed me, or that crap me.
And she raised more crimes than that me.
She's a troublemaker.
And she's half-brick too, and I don't say they want no more.
What's like she's marriage and a goal between her thighs and my legs.
But she tells it now.
She never seems as poor.
But...
Barbara Bush has already fell, and I...
We've been with George Boyce, and James Boyce, not so bad,
she's made of wild and lush, and we've been kicked back.
And smell just like the magic sauce, and a thin hat.
Barbara Bush, we've been with you for the last time.
I'm a bad baby.
Barbie Bell tonight.
You can make people do anything if you're afraid.
If they make the action flow, all of the airports in the United States,
all commercial airlines have it was grounded.
But we had some airplanes that authorized at the highest levels of our government
to pick up the sum of bin Laden family members to transport the motor to the country.
Middle of the wall, corporations, society, the whole of the town,
is to figure out how much money they need.
Where's that oil sub flowing?
It's got to be a lot of money.
Whatever it costs, the government would be.
It's going to be a good business, a bad for the people.
Charmander, kind of good numbers of Congress,
they're going to get their chips and listed in the army, and go over to Iraq.
If you want to take the tree back,
it allows researchers of medical and financial records.
He gets law enforcement models, I'm going to get a power.
The weight you'll be living tonight is principally the middle of the night,
how to Congress has the play tree back, so that we don't leave any.
Sit down nicely.
We don't read most of the bills.
No one reads.
Never before, there's a point before.
I'd like to read to the USA, be sure to have.
The day evening, so.
What's happening?
The boy going to his power.
Arditham, Arditham, do the streets of small town in Meradaz.
Do the scrum flying.
This is impressive for us to have, and I have most.
Some people call you dearly.
I call you my base.
It comes from true stories that will make you a chair for true rights.
I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers.
Thank you.
Now let's destroy.
Okay, just a little reminder to go out and pick up the DVD that I've heard in high-nine eleven hour.
I don't know about you.
Are you looking at our computer right now at the screen?
No, the matter of fact, I was just shutting it down.
We'll take a peek at it.
Are you seeing our website or any other website at this point?
I can't see anything at this point.
But Josh can't.
And?
He's reporting quickly.
Come on, Josh.
Does it look like normal?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Well, when I went to school in Ottawa, I see it's four minutes till the hour.
I didn't have minutes until two.
And already these guys are like packing it in if I can say that.
Can I say that?
They're packing it up.
And they're going to go home.
We're checking on to stay there.
But like we got a few faces to try.
The normal net looks like to me is dead.
Now I don't want to get anybody panicking.
He could be my computer, but I really doubt it.
Yes, yours.
I beg your pardon?
Everything's fine over here.
Is it really?
That's right.
Maybe my server is down.
You think that's possible?
How the hell did that happen?
Maybe we just had a big macket hack on our server, something like that.
So if you don't get any bedtime stories, you're most because you're on the Fritz.
I'll be damned.
Nothing.
And if we just our website, I said, well, there we go again.
Somebody's diddlein' bowed diddlein' with it again.
So I can't give you the results.
And maybe you want to give the result of what the poll is right now or not.
As a case, maybe.
How would they don't care?
Go for it, Josh.
John Candy, 138 votes.
Mike Meyer, 80.
Jim Carrey, 71.
Neil Young, 64.
Leslie Nielsen, 46.
William Shatter, 41.
Everybody else.
Small potatoes.
Yeah, exactly.
After that.
Well, wouldn't that be something if the whole, and I'm thinking to myself, wow, maybe we just had a internet,
I'm not that want to get people panicking, you understand?
Oh my God.
But maybe it's just me.
Maybe it's something that happened with my server here or with the computer?
Who the hell knows?
Just out of nowhere.
Don't you find that a little bit odd?
A little bit of a little bit of a little strange, unusual?
A little bit.
Look at this.
This page cannot be displayed no matter which site they flick us.
So I'll, I'll do it with it when we're done a couple of minutes here.
WQA, hello.
Oh, and I'll look at that.
Oh, and guess, yes.
Now what the hell is that all about?
All the dots are gone.
Yeah.
We got them here though.
So what does that mean?
I think you're having a line problem.
A line problem?
Like a telephone-y problem.
And guess who's meddling with our line?
Oh, now this could be just a coincidence, but I doubt it this morning before the show.
Oh no.
This freaking engineering department at WQAM, so help me, guys.
We haven't had one moment of downtime with this computer since the three years I've been doing shows here.
This studio works as fine as DIY, and now all of a sudden that Jim Boris Yeltsin has got the number and did it around with the phone company here
because of some alleged problem on this end with the fact in which I'm sure is on your end.
Now all of a sudden, nothing is coming out.
Oh, whatever they just did there, you better before you leave.
Go out and grab him by those long hair.
I was going to say about the short hair, but you don't have any.
By the long hair, just drag him bodily around in a hallway there until somebody kicks him sensing his head.
See, it's the old QAM model again.
If it ain't broke, screw around with it. Fix it.
Oh, well, you know something maybe vacation is going to start a couple days early this year.
This vacation.
Yeah, you guys were talking about it, huh?
Yeah, you can't.
Everything was going along just hunky-dory.
The phone was working just fine. The internet was working just fine.
And now we got QAM.
And again, screw up with things.
Just just dig along.
Okay, well, it's another project for us to work on.
Because like I've always told you, we can never get like more than one toe on the ground at the same time.
That's what Ms. Must says.
Mad Dog coming up next to Humpward for this afternoon.
Heaven help!
Bye, bye, bye!
I love eating nuts.
