So let's cut out all the nonsense, and we'll blow up Pakistan.
Now pay the needs and nuclear days.
Are you sure?
Why don't we stop pussy food, and we'll blow up Pakistan?
I'm dying on the earth.
Boom, boom.
See that worked out great.
That eliminated the need to feel like to be fulfilling.
Right.
Planned at break in there.
And of course it gave some of those fine spots as far as I can.
A little freebie here.
Freebie there. What's wrong with that?
Nothing at all.
Oh, we got a little space to fill there.
It's 11.02 at 5.60 W.Q.M. It's a Friday.
We got the mad dog at Bruce's room in Marhade at 2.
We got the Humphord for.
That's not the one.
That's the one.
Hey Goldberg at 4.
You got Orlando, Al-Sakwiri at the Bongo's.
Oh!
The big rock solid.
Oh!
From 7 to 10, 80 K to 10 o'clock.
That's our schedule today with the Elecator 9.
Now the other day, yesterday it seems to me, in the midst of all that, or Huzzarai.
Right at the end of the show, I was talking about Rumsfeld and the tanks and all of that.
Right. The Humvees.
Despite Secretary of Defense down with Rumsfeld's assertion that the military is not going to be able to do that.
The company provided the vehicle said it's been waiting since September for approval from the Pentagon to increase monthly production by as many as a hundred of the Alterrain vehicles intended to protect against roadside bombs in Iraq.
Army officials speaking on condition of anonymity, of course, acknowledged yesterday that they haven't approved new purchase orders for armored trucks despite the company's readiness to produce more.
We're ready, but the Pentagon's not.
They said the Pentagon has been debated, but debating how many more armored humbues are needed while people are dying.
Rumsfeld questioned by soldiers in Kuwait on Wednesday.
They said they have had to pick through landfills for a scrap metal, the boot vehicle protection, said the Army was working as quickly as quickly as it could to get armored humbues to the front.
It's a matter of physics, not a matter of money, Rumsfeld said.
Adding that the Army was breaking his neck.
It's neck.
President Bush yesterday reiterated that the concerns expressed are being addressed.
But executive is at armor holdings in Jacksonville, as well as Army officials and members of Congress had Rumsfeld assertion that the protective equipment is being provided as quickly as possible.
It's not true.
And that of the company's been waiting for more purchase orders.
We are prepared to build 50 to 100 vehicles more per month, Robert McCreedy, head of armor holding zero space defense units in the statement.
The company is producing about 450 armored humbues per month up from 50 in late 2003, when a sudden surge of attacks in Iraq exposed a lack of protective armor.
They're ready.
They're ready to rock and roll.
They are really rock solid.
The Pentagon is well, let's push some numbers around here.
You understand? They're like pencil pushing.
They're pushing it.
And Rumsfeld's lines will be seen.
Which he does very well, by the way.
We're very poorly.
Okay, here's the full result from yesterday.
And I may have to believe for like three or four minutes at any time during the show because of my phone rings.
That means that my den and CD decks are here.
They will ship the yesterday from Florida.
We're ready for it.
And they're coming FedEx overnight.
So they'll be here. So I'll be rushing right out.
So during that period of time, I want you to be on your best behavior now.
All right.
Okay, let's try not to do something.
Okay.
Or anything.
Who is your favorite Howard?
That was our poll question yesterday.
Who is your favorite Howard?
Not kind of a strange poll, but somebody thanks it in and we thought, well, yeah, why not?
And we had like 1475 votes.
It's wrong with that.
Right in the middle of Hanukkah.

Right.
Pretty impressive.
Howard Stern, 370.
Nice going, howdy.

No, but we can find out.
Oh, you wouldn't know.

No, but say it by far and fast.

Barbie Bentons are being curtained in the gallon.
And thank goodness that's an old picture.
You're a very fine photo by that is just, I don't know.
That is just almost too good to be true,
especially since it's got to be from about 50 years ago.
When you think they're about to be more like.
I know.
I would say more like.
But third man.
Well, I would be tough because she was born January 20th, 1950.
She's like a little bit beyond the embryonic stage in the picture.
It's a fine photo behind a meeting curtain if you're with the age of 100.
And you got 45 pieces of ID.
She was born in Sacramento, California.
What a great town.
That is a fabulous city.
Ever been there?
Nope.
You leave right now.
All right.
But father is a doctor in Carmichael, California, which I have no idea where that is.
But I'm assuming it's near Sacramento.
Barbie Benton.
Here's her list of stuff.
Well, if I did her whole list of stuff here, we'd be on to hill about 430.
And the wall came tumbling down.
Hospital massacre.
Death stalker.
For the love of it.
Sugar time.
Remember that sugar time by the McGuire sisters?
Of course you know it.

All over the place.
Mad Houston.
So fantasy.
Bad news.
Bad, bad, bad news.
David Brudnoi.
Now you have no idea who that is.
I do because I used to live in Boston.
And I'm familiar with Boston radio.
I don't know.
Radio talk show host David Brudnoi dead at 64.
Should we have like a moment of silence?
Do you ever heard of David Brudnoi?
No.
He's talking to him.
I can do a moment of silence for him.
Okay.
That's how it.
Time's up.
David Brudnoi, the most recognized voice of Boston talk radio
from more than a quarter of a century died last night.
Massachusetts General Hospital is radio station WBZ reported he was 64.
WBZ, the home of Jefferson K and Carl the Su's and Bruce Bradley and the J. Dunne and who
I live on.
And the Larry Glick.
Brudnoi, whose soothing voice could be heard every weeknight in 38th States and Canada on WBZ since 1986.
And out on the air in September 2003.
He was suffering from Merkel, cell carcinoma, a form of rare but treatable skin cancer.
He had already lived with AIDS for more than a decade, beating a viral infection that nearly took his life in 94.
His death came a day after an interview concluded at his bedside at Massachusetts General Hospital.
He announced the cancer had spread into his liver and kidneys and it was ready to die.
Why, all for a minute, just, you know, gotten there in time.
I didn't know about the kidneys, but she could have brought him a brand new liver.
I'm not asking my doctors to do anything illegal, Brudnoi told the veteran news anchor Gary Lopp here.
I wish I could, but they won't.
I will make it through.
My head is completely accepting of this. I'm absolutely ready.
He said, are you ready?
No.
He left the show in November of last year to fight the cancer recovered, returned in March interviewing Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry,
Governor Mitt Romney and former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventur on his first night back.
His voice was noticeably, horrorous.
We're guaranteed nothing in life except life itself and what we get as an adventure.
Not always a happy one, but always a luring experience as well as like now, a time of fear and maybe even despair, he said.
A prognor was hospitalized again this month in this condition. He was really quickly and now he's dead.
He's dead. David Brudnoi.
He was like legendary in Boston. That's why you don't know who that is.
You ought to check out Boston next week.
All right.
While you're on vacation.
Oh, look at us. Here's some liner stuff just came over.
I was ready to put this new old circular file because it didn't look like anything too important and probably still isn't.
Joanne QM tonight for a live broadcast with a big fond was he's one of my favorite broadcasts.
The big O located at the triple A and with the QM QDs at the hooters in Bayside.
Stopped by for specials on President Abebeer and to watch the heking.
That's at seven o' night bongos and hooters with the big O and look for the QM van tomorrow from two to four at world Ford Kindle at 155 51 South Dixie Highway.
Stopped by for free food drinks and prizes.
Now you're going to be there with that or not.
Nope.
Oh, that's right. You're on vacation.
Right.
So they always say on vacation.
Here's today's poll.
What a place.
Who is the biggest sellout?
That's a poll.
I was a good suggestion by our good friend Sean.
There's a few other good ones on air, but we'll see in time.
Who is the biggest sellout?
By the way, Booster is talking of the San Diego Pondries.
Did you know that?
Yeah.
Maybe that's why we had that called yesterday about boosters leaving or whatever.
But we still like Boogalod and maybe the Marlins.
Well, if the Marlins stick around there, we don't go to Vegas.
Maybe the Booster will get the head TV job or at least a head radio job and they can send Dave Van Boer.
Orang, someplace else.
Who's the like the San Diego?
That would be...
They always say San Diego is very serene and mellow and the climate is very temperate, right?
They do.
They've ever been in San Diego?
No.
Boy, you haven't neither of eyes a matter of fact.
How about you, Jay?
No, I haven't.
Never been there.
But it always says very peaceful and pleasant and very...
Good to LA.
It's not peaceful.
No, not less.
But they see like if there's any place that's got like perfect climate in the US, it's San Diego.
Anyway, now where did that come from?
Oh, that's the boot.
Who is the biggest sellout?
And here's the list that Sean had and I'm sure the audience will add some more.
John McCain, Roland Colum Powell, Phil Henry...
Phil Henry.
Okay.
Dennis Miller, Rick Riley or Steve Kane.
He used to be a course at Little Talk Host, N.W. News Years ago.
And then he found Jesus and he found the right wing and he found all his adopted children and he found Brian Craig and he found Nick Lawrence.
And he found Daniel Rogers.
It's collusive lady.
On 560 miles.
Yeah.
Stop us at Max!
I bet she's not with Jack Lemmon.
Yes.
We'll dress in a suit.
Congressman or male prostitutes.
Right around it is little more without wearing pants if you start dating him as a hell of a chance and change your life.
They'll tell you he loved you but hold on to me.
This wife's been he pissed and she'll change when it's not a night.
Oh my God.
That's what it's like if you were Gary's girl.
God help you if you're Gary's girl.
Then who's your God?
You're God just like that.
All the women say.
Come, it's a click and throw the shade.
If you write down your name in his little black book they might call you from the river on the end of the hook.
It'll change your life.
They'll tell you he loved you but hold on to me.
This wife's been he pissed and she'll change when it's not a night.
Oh my God.
It's like if you were Gary's girl.
God help you if you're Gary's girl.
Oh man who's your God?
You're God just like that.
Go to lunch George.
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?
Your reason I played that is because of the Jack Lennon factoring.
Okay.
Well just to brought that to mind I can't play the other drop it.
No.
Now you probably wonder how can we play the Gary Condo thing there in there a little bit out of the wall?
No it's not.
No it's not because here's the latest.
Gary Condo is ready to answer questions about his sexual history so we can pursue a slander case against the man.
I didn't change the pool yet.
What a see?
Now that I got to do that that's just a little piece more of work that Eric does now.
Do we so we can keep eating them sandwiches?
The pro sandwiches?
Okay.
I changed it.
Now how come nothing's happening now?
Do you see the new pool?
They look.
Let me refresh.
Oh yeah it worked.
Okay I'll get to it in a minute.
Gary Condo is ready to answer questions about his sexual history so we can pursue a slander case against the magazine writer.
It was suggested the former congressman is hiding information about the death of intern Shron Relivi.
His lawyer said yesterday.
Oh especially right in the middle of Hanukkah to be hearing about Shandra Shandra is very disturbing.
On Wednesday US District Judge Peter K. Leisure ordered Condo to dispose into the past about his sexual history and finances.
In 2002 kind of filed an 11 million dollar lawsuit against Dominic Dunn.
You know the one with a little spectacle is over.
Special correspondence to Vanity Fair saying Dunn's statements led millions of people to believe that Condo was criminally involved in Lee V's death and a lot of us still do.
After the 24-year-old US Bureau of Prison Employee disappeared in 2001, Condo reportedly told police he hadn't appeared with Lee V.
He but knew nothing of her disappearance who remains were discovered in Washington DC Park in May of 2002.
He is not considered a suspect in the homicide investigation.
The then California congressman was defeated in March 2002, primary after months of negative publicity about the case.
And I'll go.
There you go.
Gary Condo is back in the news.
Not in a big way but I sure rather hear about him than about Scott and Lacey Peterson.
And about here anymore we know he's guilty.
Fry is that isn't going on with it.
Okay, who cares?
But his mother is so alien.
And I think the reason that he was fishing there is he wanted to see if he could fish the body up again because he forgot to get the diamond off her finger.
Oh yeah, that's why he went right back to the exact spot where he dumped her ass because he wanted to get that one to get the ring back.
Here's some good news.
How do you like some good news on a Friday?
Sure, I'll take it.
No, it is good news.
Group withdraws lawsuits seeking a borrowed recount on South Florida slot machine amendment.
Oh!
And he liked that.
Well, good.
A group proposed to gambling city.
Yesterday it's withdrawn a lawsuit seeking a recount of amendment foreign-broward county in county.
The group no casinos and Heather Velino, a Broward voter who's managing director of an animal rights group, filed a lawsuit in November until I had to seek a recount in Broward on the basis that questions over 78,000 votes remained unanswered.
The amendment which one passed it by margin of almost 51% of the more than 7 million votes cast, changes the state.
See, that's not right.
It didn't win by 51%, it won by margin of 2%.
See, but they always write that.
This is the AP in a Harold.
It didn't win by margin of 51%.
But anyway, it got 51% of the more than 7 million votes cast, changes the state constitution till voters in...
Wow, what?
...and they decide later whether to withdraw slots.
It's at 7 South Florida race tracks in the High Life Fronton.
Any tax revenues on the slot machines will be dedicated to schools around the state.
About 94% of those 78,000 ballots, which were not correctly counted on election day, favored the constitutional amendment, that approval margin exceeds Broward County's countywide approval margin of 70%.
The amendment was passed by margin of nearly 120,000 votes, so throwing out all the disputed Broward votes still wouldn't change the outcome.
We want to stress that our case has terrific merit, right?
But even if it were successful, it's unlikely we would change the outcome of this election, said Randy Johnson, a central Florida Republican phony who chairs no casinos.
Our best course of action is to withdraw the votes and begin focusing on the next phase of the fight to protect Florida's families from the expansion of gambling.
Johnson added he'll try to continue his fight in the legislature, which will write a law to implement amendment for including how to define slot machines.
See, it was already in there.
Our eyes already in the amendment when people voted on us.
So this guy continues to try and his best to a subvert the world of the public, which these right wingers love to do, just like your governor with his neediest plans to subvert that to class as a amendment.
Citizens group who support amendment force that will create 18,200 new jobs with annual wages of about 36 grand.
We're happy the opposition finally recognized the voters of spoken said Jim Horan, spoke to them for the campaign for yes for local control.
Florida residents know amendment four can provide billions of dollars for public education, thousands of high paying jobs and improve the economy and South Florida.
So there's a little little piece of green.
Is right a little bit more hope?
Sure.
Okay, let me vote.
The biggest sellout is Colin Powell.
I mean, John McCain's in a rowing.
I have a vote for him.
Did you vote for McCain?
I did.
Well, good that evens it out.
Colin Powell's got seven.
A first mattering of hope.
The biggest sellout.
Somebody with no principal.
Somebody just sold their principles down the river for whatever reason.
Maybe somebody made them an offer they couldn't refuse.
Colin Powell, seven.
John McCain, four, Dennis Miller, two.
Phil Henry has a pair.
Are you sure?
Well, well, look, you for Steve Kane, one and Rick Riley, one.
You know that was Rick that voted for a Nazi.
I might have to play that today.

Two ease.
Okay.
And there's an RN says, so you want to live in Canada.
And they come there like Canada for all the blue stators.
I guess the only advantage we have here is that it's warmer.
Other than that, that's about it.
Well, that's the only advantage you had over just about anywhere.
It's that it's warmer.
That's about it.

Fantastic.

Let me just give the whole audience a little clue.
Okay.

Your dolphins lost their Arizona.
They lost to like a little girls team to the school of the blind.
Girl blind girls with their hands tied behind their back.
They're legs tied together.
In fact, in shackles and whatever.
What goes with shackles?
Leg irons.
Patrons.

I've been lifting you to the radio, wetting background music.
Right.
I've got the last 6.
Oh, huh?
And I'm in over a town.
Unfortunately, out of the last week, you totally disappear.
And you wear a couple of glasses on your 30s.
And you wear a couple of glasses on your 30s.
And you wear a couple of glasses on your 30s.
And you wear a couple of glasses on your 30s.
And you wear a couple of glasses on your 30s.
That's it.
Unfortunately, you know, now the background music interjects.
And you hear 30 to 40 seconds of that.
And you're gone.
That's why you hear.
Right.
And you come back.
And you have the air.
You know, is that like, you know, being done first of the time?
Now, when you say, when you say any idea, where would I get the idea from?
The only way I get it, and I got to cut you off because your phone blows.
Is if somebody would talk to us about that.
And so far, they're like in total denial.
It's like, oh, they haven't even discovered that.
Even though we get zedians, the calls, people complaining bitterly, practically in tears over the fact that they would love to hear the station, but they just can't hear it very well because we've got this loud, loud Hispanic interference in the background, which is either maybe Castro pumped up one of his AM giants,
with about two million wants, or maybe keep channels like sabotaging because we're about to leave non-cheap channels station left on the AM dial.
So they got to do something to wipe us out because they sure can't do it with the lane programming they put on.
And anyway, I have no idea.
We just keep doing the best we can.
They're almost impossible circumstances, pal.
So that's it.
It's all we can do.
70 QAM, hello.
Gentlemen.
Yes, sir.
Happy Friday to you.
Back to you. Happy to your government.
Thank you.
Happy to look at you too.
I've got three suggestions for you.
I've got Tom Brogdon, Ben Radler, or Ashcroft.
It's your choice.
I never understand any of them.
Why would you say they're a sellout?
Well, you know, I don't think so.
I've talked to his, he is what he is.
He's a right wing fanatic nut job.
Well, exactly.
He, you know, he pretty much backed out on credit moush.
What do you mean by that?
Now, nice drive, pal.
But the answer is...
What does that mean?
Oh, sad to say, says Jim, but John Kerry, that is a good one.
I never really thought about it in those terms, but that is, I would say...
Happy to look me correctly.
Very good.
So, that's...
Yeah.
Nice going, Jim.
If we'd left him off, we should have all been lined up in the shot.
I think that is going to happen soon, by the way.
5-6...
You first.
5-6-7-0, 5-60.
Count 5-60 out of a rise and sing it a verse on.
I don't think the other guy understood it.
I mean, how does Dan Radler sell out?
So he's liberal and, you know, and CBS put his feet to the floor and he said,
by the way, you were fired into it, one once in that way, take a really retirement.
Maybe Tom broke off out.
Why?
Maybe he's thinking, cop out.
Well, we're not talking about that.
Sell out.
Sell out.
In other words, somebody who supposedly stood on some kind of principle, whatever it was,
and then kind of like, mealymouthed his way like, whatever.
And just threw in the towel.
Like, towel.
Rhymes would towel.
I'm pretty foul, if you ask me.
Colin Powell's leading.
Oh, in fact, look at that.
We got a deadfooted tie.
I love it.
Colin Powell and John McKinny, each have...
About 30 men.
That is not...
That's going to be a very tough race.
And I'm glad to see that our audience is sharp enough to realize that John McKinny is a total phony,
who talks a good game about campaign finance reform and about baseball and steroids and all this other crap.
But at the bottom line, as he sold out to Bush, who tracked him and his wife and his whole family in 2000.
I mean, in the primary, he's just...
Just tracked him on a visceral personal level.
I mean, just unbelievably.
They said that the adopted daughter was a love child from an affair.
Right.
And he didn't even bother coming back with the real story about Bush and his love child and the abortion.
Well, there was no love involved.
Oh, well, I made it okay.
I made a kosher then.
That's what the priest always say.
By the way, I noticed there's stirring their thing up again with this pre-scan a little bit.
That'll last a couple of weeks.
That'll go away again.
What a sick, sick thing that Catholics shared to this sickest and the most corrupt institution on the face of the globe.
It makes the mafia look like ever while, of course, there is a little crossover.
It makes the mafia look like a bunch of Boy Scouts.
A little crossover.
Philly's Camp Leano, a Camp Leonios.
Happy related birthday, George.
12, 6.
Oh, that's right. It was George's birthday four days ago.
I wasn't going to send it, but I thought it was very nice.
And I want to say happy birthday back to her.
The nice boy, a Cuban lady.
Well, that's all right.
You already got your birthday gift for me.
Thank you. That's all matters.
And you might be getting another one too if all we ever get the answer to that question.
But I doubt it.
We share the same birthday as this lady, the Cuban girl, Cuban bokeh girl.
And when I lived in Boca, you and I chatted a few times.
She says, and I was just getting personal?
Oh, I thought that became of itself.
You didn't do her? No, David.
I'm now living in Syracuse and still on the show by the internet.
Miss my soft-loaded teams and of course family and friends.
You will all be with me.
You'll make my cold, dreary days here in Central New York a little bit brighter.
It is a cold, dreary day.
Here's a matter of fact, as I'm looking out the window.
It's gay. I mean, gray. Very gray.
And it's also gay.
Now the candidate says, okay, to gay marriages.
The Supreme Court.
Thanks to both of you who have a fantastic new year.
Love Cuban, the bokeh girl.
P.S. she says, I'm dying of it.
Probably a higher register.
Well, that's cute.
That's sweet.
We got some nice stuff here today, which is a pleasant change for a while.
Joining two of them tonight at seven live broadcasts with a big old at Bongo is located at Triple A.
At the Triple A at the Mickey Irons in Arena where he and your mayor Alex Pinga.
Whoops.
Alex.
Oh, I just dumped myself.
Oh, no.
Well, Alex Pinga, Pacaniah, sorry.
And Mickey Irons slipped the Mickey to the voters in Dave County anyway.
And the QM QNs will be there at the Hooters and Bayside.
Stop by for specials on President De Beard to watch the heat game.
That's at seven tonight Bongo's and the Hooters with the big, such as he is.
And then look for the QM Band of R or two to four with the World Forward in Kindle.
I sure hope that that's not a competitor to our good friends at Armstrong, Ford and Homestead.
Is it because that would make me very angry?
From two to four tomorrow at...
Located at 155-51 South-Dixie Highway.
Stop by for free.
Food, drinks and prizes, too.
You are listening to Neil Rodgers' fan, who owns it lately.
On 5th Street.
You're all on.
Hey.
Stance of power manure covers over this performance by the Dolphin.
Oh, right.
To the Dolphin.
To the Dolphin.
I got a great poll idea.
I got a great poll idea.
I got a great poll idea for Monday.
I usually don't do this because there's something to think about over the weekend.
There's so many people who belong on this list.
Who has their job only because of their physical appearance?
The reason I was thinking about that is that it's not a problem.

It wasn't the perfect.
Yeah, that's always a good tip by the way.
If you hear somebody talking to you like that, that means they're gay.
In fact, it really means that they're...
FAMING!
Anyway, let's see what's the seat you just facts.
Frank and Melbourne, who's also a chronic factor, says that your army issue bit rummy in the butt.
But the Neocons, the Neonauts, these are trying to spin it into a good thing because W had a response.
They didn't choke on a pressle.
Yeah, that's right.
So it must have been okay.
The point here is the troops don't have the equipment they need and haven't had for over a year.
The Neos try to claim the Neonauts.
That all the armor available is out and over there in use.
But the armor companies say they're not a full capacity.
I just got through reading that story this morning, Frank.
Jesus Christ almighty motors.
Someone needs to remind the idiot that he's commander in chief.
They've made an idiot out of the idiot.
Okay, Frank, it's not a very good fact today because it's just started the show with that.
And I started right at 11 o'clock with that story about rummy and the latest in the Pentagon isn't...
They're busy figuring out how many they want.
And the manufacturer says, oh, we can make all you want.
We've told you that for like months now.
Well, we're working on it.
Well, rummy is over there lying and lying through his teeth to those soldiers whose lives are in jeopardy.
Even Alex Trebek is in bear.
And I'm telling you kids wanting right now, okay?
There are people who cheat, people who steal, people who are screw around on their wives and their husbands and their girlfriends.
There is nothing in the world worse than a liar.
Okay, just remember I told you that all your kids out there, there's Don Trierwood saying,
all your kids just remember there is nothing in the world worse than a liar.
I'm not talking about little white lies.
You know, harmless everybody does that.
I'm talking about a liar like Donald Rumsfeld, who is jeopardizing the lives of people through his lies.
He is a crazy person. He's certifiable.
In fact, we had a higher him at QA and he could go like that all day long.
When that'd be great, just nail his ass up on the wall and every time he walked by,
I'd just smack him and head and he'd go, woo, woo, woo, like that.
If it didn't like a rubber glove, that's right.
And hang his ass right next to him.
Because in spite of that offer by the players union, I don't think that...
Well, let's see what happens on Tuesday.
Okay? Well, you're going to miss all the good stuff next week.
Yeah, today. Especially that pool.
I'd better write that down because you know me. I got this all-timeers real bad.
People's Choice Award nominates Fahrenheit 9-11 as favorite film of the year right, Michael Moore.
Oh!
Not that it's a self-serving article here, Mike, but that's okay.
Dear friends, I mean, I take a break from our post-delicent to share with you a little piece of happy,
slice-silly, slice-cool news.
Fahrenheit 9-11 has been nominated by the People's Choice Awards as the American public's favorite film of the year.
And I would certainly wholeheartedly agree with that, having seen it four times now.
The five nominees were chosen from a pool of thousands of Americans in mid-late November.
The other nominees for best film are Spider-Man 2, The Incredibles,
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mine with Jim Carey, and Direct Ashrick 2.
It is the first time ever a documentary has been nominated for best film by People's Choice Awards.
The People's Choice Awards are considered among all awards,
chose to be the one which most accurately reflects the main screen public opinion in the USA.
How do you like that? Did you know that?
I do know.
Do now.
And it says, okay, Michael Moore says, here's the best part, you get to vote online.
Now just go here, click here. It's on our website. You can click it.
Link it, click it.
Click here, click on the little circle nice to Fahrenheit 9-11 in the favorite movie category,
or impress the vote button.
Voting is going on now, and continues only through this coming Monday, December 13th, 3PM.
So send an email to your friends, let them know they can vote too.
Winners will accept their awards live on CBS, January 9th.
Normally, I wouldn't make a very big deal out of something like this.
He says it's nice and I'm honored, but it's not exactly the number one priority on any of our minds these days.
In fact, when we found out about Renominate over, we could go ahead and even think to tell you about it,
or put it up on our website.
Well, get with it, Mike.
But then a group of top Republicans took out a full page ad in USA today and placed a similar one in the Hollywood Trademore magazine variety,
proclaiming that an election is over, but a war of ideas continues.
The point at the end was to say that while they as right-wing conservatives were proud of getting rid of Kiri,
there was still one more nuisance running around, lose their hand to deal with, me.
They also wish they were not so subtle threat to the Academy Award voters that, in essence,
said they don't even think about nominating Thurin High and I love them for best picture.
And Bill O'Reilly recently bellowed that if the Oscars recognized my work this year,
Middle America will boycott Hollywood.
Oop, yeah.
I guess I saw...
He's... Huh?
I said, yeah, sure.
It says, oops, I guess he spoke too soon because now along comes Middle America's favorite award show, The People's Choice.
And the People's Choice this year along with a Spider-Man superhero and levable green ogre is a film that apparently continues to resonate throughout the country.
The truth about Iraq, Bush, terror and fear.
The election has an alternate or maybe relevant, unfortunately, a single one of these issues.
And if they in the film that dealt with these issues are still at the forefront of the majority of the public's minds,
should give serious pause to Mr. Bush as he brags about an nonexistent mandate and begins to spend his so-called political capital.
It may have been barely the People's Choice on November 2nd, Ohio, Reconnaught, excluded,
but now that people get to vote again this time for a movie, it's about the best we can do right now and trust me,
it won't be long before we start the real work we need to do to get our country back.
Again, go to PCAVote.com.
It's got the link on here in the store, which is on our website.
If you want to vote for our film, I promise if we win to give a nice and polite speech.
Ha ha ha ha.
Oh, don't give a nice and polite speech.
Let him have it, Mike.
Rip him an ass.
Tell him like it is.
The fact that he was booed when he did that at the Oscar.
That was so outrageous, man.
It was, you know what it was?
What?
It was American.
It was the American, effing way.
That's what that was.
It was the American, effing way.
It was the American, effing way.
It was the American, effing way.

They're still working on my satellite on my cable rather than my digital cable.
They're still working on my satellite on my cable rather than my digital cable.
Like the satellite network affiliates.
They're still counting by hand now.
They just started a couple of days ago.
They just started a couple of days ago.

it's appropriate for Jeffrey and Joel Miles
who has examined all of their options
and led to something that's taking much, much longer
than anybody anticipated.
Ruben was reluctant to suggest the meeting
was a signal the team was ending talks for a 38,000 seat,
$420 million retractable roof stadium east of the orange wall.
It means what it means, he said,
Las Vegas wants the baseball team,
the Marlins are a baseball team,
it just makes sense for the two people to have a meeting
and say, hello.
Oh, we haven't said that yet.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Here you go. Josh? Hello.
What a jackass.
Officials said relocation was off limits
during the 90-minute meeting,
Brown City arranged with the Marlins,
and the Marlins did not request information to relocate,
said Major League Baseball President Bob DePuy.
Las Vegas was an answer, I'm sorry, I just don't see it.
Do you? No.
How is Las Vegas going to support baseball?
There's a million permanent population in Buffalo.
Buffalo can't support a Major League Baseball team.
They have no NBA team. They're just bills blow.
But how is Vegas going to support first of all?
You're going to say, well, I got all those tourists going through.
Tourists don't go to a place like Vegas to go to a baseball game.
If you put that sportsbook team in the console in front of that game.
Plus, unless they spend a fortune on a domed stadium,
there's no way they're going to be able to play there,
because it's 185 degrees in the shade when baseball is being played
from like, you know, April through October.
On October, on October, on Thursday,
Goodman referred to the meeting as a cordial chat
instead of for no resemblance to negotiation.
Let's put it this way, Goodman said.
I love South Florida. I love South Beats in the Miami area.
I don't want to ruffle anybody's feathers.
Adding, he loved to lure a franchise to a city
but was unaware of the Marlon Stadium efforts, right?
Goodman who said he's been contacted by other baseball teams,
I'm not going to allow Las Vegas to be used as a bargaining chip.
The nature of the meeting did not appear in aggravated D.A. as he is
pieced off and fired up.
You're mayor.
I'm disgusted because I think it's showing your bad fate, D.A.
as a way that business relationships are built on trust.
It's not like negotiation between us had broken down.
We're still talking as recently as the last few days,
going through open issues.
I don't understand how you can go somewhere else.
He is peed off, man.
And I don't understand.
He's got that kid that can print all the money they need
to fund the new stadium. Why isn't he just go ahead and do it?
Right? Right. Better get busy.
It's no secret officials with the team,
County and City have grown frustrated by the progress in stadium talks.
It's been more than a year since the team and County officials
fresh from the 2003 World Series Championship Parades
vowed to build the team a new home.
Among the sticking points from the teams,
winning the GRT cost over.
And it goes on and on.
It's in the sunset.
Let's just cock out.
You know what it is?
Yeah. And the common thing with Wayne was moving the
pants into Nashville.
Everybody remembers that stuff.
And then of course we got lucky in that big year when they went
to the stand-up finals.
And everybody was throwing their rats and pretending to be a
big hockey fan.
Even though they wouldn't know Eddie Bauer from Johnny Bauer.
Ever Eddie Bauer from Guiding Light?
No.
But I'll put on a big act.
Oh, well, we're a big hockey fan.
We loved a pan.
Yeah, right.
And it lasted about five minutes.
And then so that we got this big gigantic white elephant
sitting there.
And then we got the old Miami Arena, another pink elephant sitting
over down there.
And then we got the Mickey Irison, the behind-the-back door mayor
penis, whatever that was.
Oh, mayor.
That's twice now.
I can't believe that.
Well, I don't know how to say it.
What am I going to say, Mayor?
We, we, I don't know what to say.
That's his name.
Alex Picaniel, whatever it is.
I don't know.
Well, I got a story about that later too as a matter of fact.
But we'll get to that.
I have to be real careful on that.
Oh, speaking to me, real careful.
Talk show host TV Talk Show Jerry Springer, your favorite.
So they view a three-hour weekday radio talk show in January
in Cincinnati, all brother, a liberal talk show in Cincinnati.
That's like Hal Avath in North Pole.
I don't get it.
How are we going to see the fights on the radio?
That's like how many grits in Manhattan.
I just don't get it.
That's like White Hots in Peoria, the former Cincinnati mayor
in TV Yankee will launch a nine-am to noon call and show on
WS AI Cincinnati.
Dick Burton used to be on WS AI.
Do you know that?
No.
Now you do.
Long time ago, a hundred years ago.
When the clear channel statement.
Well, I had the window open because it's the heat is so just unbearable.
It's artificial heat.
So I cracked the window and they're like, oh, all kinds of stuff going on.
When the clear channel statement switches from oldies music to liberal talk,
that's probably just the NHL parade up in the industry.
Hey, Gary, how you doing?
Getting those jobs.
He wants to syndicate the show nationally from Cincinnati Springer said.
There's clearly an opportunity for new voices to be heard around the country
since Springer 60 years yesterday.
There's so much going on in the world today and to be part of that dialogue will be fun,
he said.
Talk about another overblown ego.
Geez, this guy is just everywhere.
Daryl Park, operations director for Clear Channel 4am,
Stations Inc.
Cincinnati said the station had been negotiating with the former politician for months.
The one-year radio commitment will not affect his TV show,
taped in Chicago.
He said he'll do the radio show Monday through Wednesday from a Chicago station
before taping his TV shows and broadcast Thursday and Friday from a cheap channel
studios in Kenwood.
And it goes on, and it goes on.
I'm sure George will agree with me.
What about Jerry Parker and Matt Stone?
The guy they created that part.
Why?
Well, it seems like this past season, for example, I mean,
it's not really good.
And that means they sold out?
Well, I've been heard.
How do you want it?
Huh?
Running out of material?
Maybe.
Well, I just wanted on there, so you're right now out.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Let us draw you a picture, how's that?
I don't even know if there's any of those droppings anymore that we can play, you know?
Yeah.
I even bought the stuff!
Yeah, we can play that.
Sure, that's safe.
And I can't play that one.
Okay, definitely can't play that.
We can play that.
Good, good, good.
Both of us can't play that.
She's an evil bitch!
Yeah.
Can't play that.
Certainly can't play that.
Oh, we can play...
Friends, people, piss me out.
Which is good right now with all the frogs in Beating, Florida, another three of Canadian dollars over there.
They are a little bit...
I'm sure they are.
They're all over.
That's right.
Now that that loony is way up there, man, American dollar droppin' like a stone man, like a gigantic boulder off the top of the Empire State Building.
WQAM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
How you doing?
Yes, sir.
Great.
Sensation.
If you don't mind, I have a question about God's Father 2 and an observation also about the movie.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
In the Father 2, after Michael has that machine gun attack on his bedroom and his wife K is in the bed and you know where his children come and play with his voice.
Right.
He goes to Tom Hague and then he says, Tom, you're going to be the new Don.
You're going to be in charge of the family and everything and then you don't hear anything else about that.
What was that all about?
You're going to be the new Don?
Yeah, I don't remember when Michael goes to Tom Hague and he says, you're going to be the Don.
You're going to be in charge.
No.
Do you remember that?
I don't remember that.
Wow.
Maybe it was a...
He was going to put him in charge temporarily while he got his camera to hell out of it.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was right after the machine gun attack.
And I'm going to have to rewatch that.
Now there's another excuse, another good reason to watch it again 40, 50 times.
Okay, my observation is notice in Godfather 2 that Michael has a problem pronouncing his bars.
When he says Rocco, it comes out Rocco.
Yeah.
And when he says the Reppel, he says Webels like Elmer Bud.
Yeah, but don't forget, he got that broken jaw from a clusky and that's every time his...
Even though he's finally healed but affected his speech.
Okay, that may be a reason for that.
Thank you, never got a fact right again until I'm Gary Glen Ross.
Yeah.
Anyway, I think your fans have to do the greatest thing on radio and you're saying God, how the great day.
Thanks a lot, Palli.
Have a great weekend and we'll be right back.
Thanks a lot, Palli.
Have a great weekend and we'll be right back.
I don't remember that.
I don't remember that.
I remember when he said you're out Tom.
They get the whole.
You're out Tom.
Oh man, the schmaltz hearing is just dripping from his speech.
And it goes on forever, so I've got enough.
5670560, 0560, and the Verizon Singular Rottlesign.
Jim Manage had Bruce Ruhmitt too in Marguerite.
The Humber Henry Algoldberg of four, who is going to have his pom-poms in the Hull deal with him.
The big O at Bongo is seven to ten, the big, 80k at ten o'clock.
That's our pristine line of Chris.
We got no Panther games for you because there ain't no Panther games.
But, the thing yesterday looked a little on the promising side, a little bit.
But, you never know what a Gary Bettman and those owners are on the other side.
They're meeting again Tuesday and who knows.
Who knows what evil lurks.
I hate Gary Bettman.
He's to me one of the most detestable subhuman pieces of crap that ever came down the pipe.
Gary Bettman, I said, fight.
He's a walking ad for anti-symmetism.
He's just obnoxious and disgusting.
And his performance last night was so outrageous.
You know, just very grudgently saying, well, you know, they did make an offer.
24% across the board's salary reduction.
How do you like that?
I'm actually even Josh Cordist.
I want to give up 25% of what he's making.
I'll think it down to three bucks an hour.
Providence Pass, known at 560 WDQM.
The holiday season is here and our good friends at Armstrong, Florida,
want to thank all their loyal customers for their business and trust.
Everybody knows that Ford makes great vehicles to be competitive.
Armstrong Ford realizes they need to offer you folks more value.
So Armstrong was the first Ford dealer to offer tires and batteries for life.
Plus, a Florida sun pass with each vehicle purchased.
Vice President and General Manager David Richett and the gang also want me to remind you
that Armstrong Ford always has very competitive prices.
For example, right now, you can drive away the new 2005 F-150 from just 13,938
or a new expedition for only 24,090.
Great prices and a value and friendly service.
That's the Armstrong of Homestead Difference.
When you're ready for a new vehicle, come to the needle and that treats you just like family.
Armstrong Ford at Homestead and you find them at Southwest 307 Street, U.S.1,
exit the Campbell Drive Off the Turnpike.
Prices include all factory remates and discounts with a Procredit Plus tax tag and fees.
Armstrong Ford at Homestead wish you and yours a happy, sensational holiday season.
Like I said, a happy, oh look what I did.
Oh, you changed it to the audition one.
Yeah, how did you know that one?
It's the guy from the dance.
The reason you look at it, really?
Freedom and safe shoes.
We all need the compensation.
We all need the love for girls.
The more expensive said the pay still.
Oh, bring your next adventure around.
Hey, hey, go back to our home.
All that I want you must pay.
No more mercy in our home.
All that I want you must pay.
No more mercy in our home.
I'm dying over here.
Now, people I'd want some money or those kids anyway that were in the pink floor.
They want some money so they can go back to the wall.
So they could find the oils.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How many years later was it now?
About 30, man.
No, the delayed if you asked me.
12, 18 and 5, 60 WQM.
Remember the story I had yesterday about the guy at Comberland Farms who smooched the sandwich in the guy's face at the counter because he won the heat in the microwave?
Houston, road rage, try restaurant rage.
This seems to be an epidemic.
One thing about America when some jackball, that's some idiotic thing.
That a whole bunch of people say, hey, that's a good idea.
Let me try.
A 34-year-old man apparently angry that his $6 stake in cheese sandwich was too cold was arrested on the charge of threatening to kill the restaurant manager Wednesday.
Police said the manager offered to reheat Delvin being Nelson's sandwich or make him a new one when he complained.
The third reason he instead demanded a refund through the sandwich at the manager and then threatened to kill her and blow up the restaurant.
Yeah, I think he's got a point.
Nelson, a Houston public works in Hawaii, has been relieved of his duties pending the outcome of the investigation.
He remained in custody yesterday.
Wow, how do you like that?
I'll tell you, your stake in cheese is like too cold and it gets like, the cheese gets like mung.
For a stake in cheese, the cheese is going to be like melted and like, you know, otherwise, if it gets like congealed.
Ooh, you know what I mean?
It's like glue for the meat then.
Right, right.
It's congealed.
Ooh, it's like it's been sitting around like a refrigerator for about a week and just then stuck in a freezer for half an hour so it's frozen like a, what do you call it?
Popsicle.
Yeah, like a popsicle.
How's that poll coming?
I'm not talking too much about the poll because they have my mind on that one for Monday already.
I'm going to weigh ahead of myself.
Who is the biggest sell-off?
That's our poll question today.
We got 260 vote.
John McCain, we got our great panel going on here and I would agree with the audience.
It is very, very tough there and neck and neck side by each, as Frank Suleev would say.
John McCain's 70, Colin Paul's 67, Dennis Miller's 32, despise him.
Phil Henry's 31, Phil Henry, boy, how the mighty have fallen.
Are you sure?
Positive.
John Kerry 15, Rudy Giuliani 13, Zell Miller 9, good old boy.
Alex, Alex, Puccanea, there you go.
Rick Riley 5, Steve Cain Ford, that's the double his audience.
Mark McGrath, I didn't realize Mark McGrath is Sugar Ray.
I mean, that's the name of the group that's him.
Right, a lead.
See, I try to get that out of my mind.
I know exactly who that is and I remember seeing that picture on Rolling Stone when they shot him through 85 leaders of Vaseline and I thought,
well, he don't look too bad.
And then I realized he is grotesque.
He's one of them, one country kind of people.
Yeah, but that was a hot rock band.
Oh, man.
He's got Zits.
In fact, Wayne Heisinger could put his entire head inside one of the Zits that he's got.
Oh, geez.
Mark McGrath's got three, some out.
Dick Morris has only got two George Lucas one.
Dick Morris should be doing much better than that and he just don't know who that is.

It would have been like if some big dog attacked tiny once upon a time.
It would have been upset.
It would have been upset.
It would have strangled it.
No.
I don't know what to say.
You go boy.
I mean, that's a bad.
That's terrible.
That is so bad.
You're supposed to be a dog lover.
Well, I am, but sometimes they get on your nerves a little bit.

Thank you, A.M.
Friday, you bastard.
Jesus Land, Christian, call the high world for the healthiest guy.
No, we in this land, Christian, pop, where we live in the streets of Peter's tribe.
Woo!
Well, right, back, back, I was in roller-rhythm.
Well, you can go to the coast and let them go down.
Go right on the edge of the window, guys.
Be sure to grab the rhythm on your motorbike.
Woo!
Bang, bang, bang, shouldn't it right there?
You, woo!
Bang, bang, bang, bang, the purchase that they're shooting.
Woo!
Take the fate of the two, start for fun, two feet.
But they're squandered by a dark and dark memories.
Oh, well, we better go on there.
No, but there's a role in this as far ahead.
We better let you go.
We're waiting for our snakes for our vacated.
We're waiting for the community to take us away.
Some hard-tired men are both snappy, pervading.
Woo!
We'll up with it to be great dynamic, we'll play.
Woo!
In the red, we think to why I get there, kids.
We put the fun and fun of that time, this.
Woo!
We're waiting for the Lord to forgive you.
With your joy so closely appointed to you.
Woo!
Down the mountain, the Bible's true.
This far is nearly never when I can blow.
Woo!
Jesus, land, the risk is gone.
With your hope, go to hell, leave that.
Woo!
The need is a slam, the risk is gone.
We're waiting for the ransom, hatred, thrive.
We've got a flatfooted time, man.
302 hosts, and we can't separate them.
They're tied at the hip, coloned pal.
And John McCain, 79 apiece.
Can you believe that?
79 apiece.
Tie, dead even.
Phil Henry, 37, is in a turd.
Dennis Miller, 36, he's Ron Phil's ass.
John Kerry, 16, Rudy Giuliani, 13.
Alex, your former mayor, 11.
Zell Miller, 9, Rick Riley, 6.
Dick Morris, 5.
Mark McGrath, 5.
From Sugar Ray.
Steve came forward, that's it.
That's his audience, and George Lucas got a pair.
That's a bad news for our new James Brown fan out there.
Do you think there are any James Brown fans?
No.
Not in this crowd.
I may be wondering.
James Brown, the Godfather of Seoul, and the legend in rap rock and funk.
Has announced that he's got prostate cancer.
Well, they had no big thing, right?
They had no thing.
Could be.
The statement released to the ap this morning, Brown 71 said it'll undergo surgery for the surgery for the omens December 15, which what's today?
It's 10.
Sounds like next Wednesday.
I've overcome a lot of things in my life.
I'll overcome this as well, Brown said.
Brown best known for a seminal hits like, I feel good.
If you ever heard the Eddie Campon show, man, it plays out how many times did I have?
About three times.
Over and over and over.
That and that.
And I feel good.
I feel good.
Wow.
Love Eddie a lot, but man, that's song.
Please, please, please.
And cold sweat.
Also as a diabetic.
Oh, boy, that's bad.
That's a bad combination.
Diabetes and a cool and cancer.
What is he got?
A prostate cancer.
Dub the hardest working man in Seoul.
But I thought that Tom Joyner was the hardest man in working man in Seoul.
Been a radio show business.
No.
Is that what he says?
Ah!
That is working man.
In something business.
Are you auditioning for the Al Franken show now they start his extension?
You can play it in the bathroom.
Dub the hardest working man in Seoul business.
And then he's just finished the two-week Canadian tour on Thursday night.
I wish I didn't know.
He was here.
I'd have gone see him.
Not.
He's expected to spend three weeks recovering from the prostate cancer procedure.
Earlier this year he faced other troubles and he was charged with domestic abuse after an altercation with his wife.
The altercation was resolved when he failed to contest the charge.
Brown is due to release an autobiography next month.
Well, that should be spicy.
Besides pulling the project with a slew of appearances, he still finds the tour of Asian Australia or the next year.
He is really.
But he feels good.
He feels good.
Oh boy.
Geez, I sure hope we don't have that son running where they've honest to get.
And let me ask you this question.
And you also might mention today it's like Friday at 12.30 now.
I still don't have anything from premier that this can only sit again.
Did you mention it this morning?
Yes.
You mentioned it again.
And again.
And again.
See, FedEx works like it really works.
I want to say this one more time.
DHL sucks.
FedEx works.
But I really need to ask you.
Because I know we're not the only station that does it on the sports shows.
And every time they do a rejoin after a commercial break and they come back and they've got to play music.
Which kills a lot of time.
I mean, especially on a station it's got 85 minute breaks like we do.
Why do we do that?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Why do we always like, I mean, is that you know?
It's cool.
No, it's not cool.
The music that we play.
No, the music that we play.
Most of it is like from the 60s.
Motown, game, battle, and boast to be reflective of the taste of it.
That's what we have to have to have the audience help.
No, it's not.
If we're after 25 to hear, listen to me.
If we're looking for a 25 to 54 male demographic or even say 18 to 49.
Stuff from the 60s is 45 years old now.
OK, or at least 40 years old.
Who were you to question their programming to say?
That's right.
I'm just always find it bizarre that you know, when you're really pressed for time and the people are tuning in to hear the host.
And not just 75 minute commercial breaks and a lot of corny old James Brown music.
I want to hear the host, man.
I want to hear the people.
I want to hear the immediately.
He's saying the host starts talking with the music in the background like he's a DJ.
Right.
Hated.
I can't stand it.
But then again, I don't listen anyway.
567-0560, pound 567, a Verizon and a Singular Rital song.
And I get to hear the pre-delay.
I wonder if Joyce knows that I can listen.
I can hear the pre-delay.
All those words.
Oh my God.
WQA and Hello.
Hello Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got a guy for your poll.
OK.
Ricky Tiki Williams.
We're a rookie waiting.
I'm going to show them down the river.
I'll do it.
You're all team.
OK, Pali, thanks.
Ricky Williams.
Sold the dolphins right down the river.
I see Dave Wantsett's going to be doing again.
And nobody's going to be watching the Cardinals and who is it?
And Iran, something like that?
Some core scrap game.
That's going to be watched by half a 1% of the country.
Now, Dave Wantsett, Aaron TV, is just beginning.
The other Wantsett airs over because he resigned.
I mean, he got fired.
Why did they always do that?
Did they think they're really fooling anybody?
Maybe his children.
Oh, I see.
They don't want to offend their children.
Like Tim Williams is at Zeta.
Oh, I got children.
I'll say, oh, too bad.
Your children probably already know you're on more on OK, Tim.
Why do you need to be a bugging me?
The star, you're right.
I need to write a book.
I just got to write a book.
The spirit of Christ compels me.
No, I mean it.
It's easy.
It's just the stuff that I've experienced in this business, the kind of wacko,
the kind of lunatics, the kind of garbage, the kind of swill.
Tim Williams would say to who just happened to be the son-in-law of the station owner.
Back in the day when it was owned by God-gannett Broadcasting.
And all of a sudden, Bob Bing, he's the general manager.
Wow, Tim Williams, yeah.
He is just, and I'm trying to remember what he got upset about.
I said something about pissed off.
I mean, even now during the chilling era in which we are operating,
which is 1,000 times worse than in the history of the radio,
even now nobody gets pissed off about pissed off.
But, oh, that doesn't sound like you really make it never-
Oh, boy.
Go away, Tim, OK?
And I hope that your kids who are now I'm sure fully grown,
realize the old man is a real bozo and always a moron, a silly person, an idiot.
And how about Stanley J. Cohen?
I wonder if he's still alive.
He used to drive that yellow pimple wheel, a lion's Z.
WQA and hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Has anybody mentioned Wayne Heisinga?
Biggest sellout.
You know something, you know, that's right.
You got it.
Didn't he really screw us over?
He screwed the whole town over, that's right.
How's that blackbuster park coming by the way?
I'm sorry?
I said, how's his blackbuster park coming?
Oh, yeah.
How much you've been there?
It looks like it's got a great job.
We're service.
We're laying it out now.
I'm going back to town, just so I can go there.
Good choice, Palli.
Thanks a lot.
I'm going to show you something right now when you can make it down.
If Howard Conny would change their mind and decide they wanted to build this facility,
I will not play here.
Because I will not have you guys looking at me for the next 10 years saying,
here's a guy that said one thing and went out and did something else.
Right, so this out, so this down a river, does it all the time?
All these spoiled owners, man, I have no sympathy for any of them.
Just like Art Mordill.
See this whole thing with the Cleveland Browns, which I just mentioned,
the Patriots kicked a crap out of my Sunday.
But the idea that there is such a team, there's a team called the Cleveland Browns,
and they have the uniforms, although some weeks,
remember the week before that judge when they wore their strange orange ones?
Yeah, all orange.
Oh, man.
It looked like a Halloween game.
What was that?
It's not the Cleveland Browns.
It's not the Cleveland Browns.
It's not the team of Jim Brown and Bobby Mitchell and Otto Graham and Lou Groza and Paul Brown.
It's a scam.
It's a bait and swish is what it is.
Because Art Mordell lied to his teeth about losing his ass and he took the team and moved to the bomber.
With that boring Raven team that he's got, those Raven lunatics,
who also got crushed by the way of other Patriots.
I just mentioned that in Passive Boy.
What the hell is that kid's name?
The quarterback for Baltimore?
Bulls, Bulls, Kyle, Buller.
What is it?
Kyle, Buller.
Buller?

The next book is for everybody who is going to write you a promise!
It's extreme queer wife's wife.
I'm home!
Oh, look at you.
Handsome, man!
We love you.
This is freaking out.
You guys filming this?
Extreme queer wife's wife.
Great.
You haunt the covers and you snore.
I want to roll over and go to sleep.
Prove 44, 16 to 1 at 5, 60 WQM.
And now this star I'm going to have to be a little delicate,
would because Joyce might be a monitoring.
Some men would have normally small things, gave a port, this is the best.
Have you ever had somebody say, I give my right arm to have whatever?
You don't fill into black?
Yeah.
Or left arm.
Some men would have normally small members, gave a port of their left arm so that
surgeons could create a more normal-sized organ.
G-Day, it's a warlitzer.
What if you got a really short left arm?
Well, then you got real problems.
You just got to give an armada leg?
An armada leg.
The operation known as total phallic reconstruction dramatically improved their quality
of life and for some allowed them to experience a full sex life for the first time.
The condition known as, oh, I guess I can say it because it's a medical condition.
It's known as micro penis.
Really?
Is that a word?
That's a word.
That's why I'm saying it.
She can't get all bent out of shape about that, although some guys, if they got it,
I'm sure are.
Some of us that are pet names, is defined as a thing no greater than three inches in
length when fully erect.
I'm going to check in my left arm here.
Micro penis can result from a variety of causes, including...
That's the name of the condition.
It's a medical condition.
You bozo, you pervert.
Micro can result from a variety of causes, including inadequate exposure to testosterone before
birth and genetic factors, according to study findings presented Wednesday at the European
Society for Sexual Medicine Conference in Lumbin.
I took a look in European.
As the name implies, total phallic reconstruction is a comprehensive operation that addresses
all aspects of penile function.
The main tissue for the new member is obtained from the forearm and incorporated into the
paintings existing, the member.
The fate made for us to get out of it.
This is a good way to get your foreskin back.
Micro surgical techniques are used to connect blood vessels and nerves.
Last they got a lot of nerve.
Lastly an inflatable penile prosthesis is placed in a normal erectile function.
Also it's like a stunt thing.
In the present study, Dr. David Ralph and colleagues from University College London described
nine men between 1943 and 1943 years of age who want to went to procedure at their
institution.
The subjects included three permafridites and two men with testosterone problems.
The average member length was just over an inch.
Well, I'm starting to feel like a real big shot now.
All of the men were satisfied with the cosmetic outcome of their operation, which aims for
a new member length of about five inches.
In addition, the operation law formed into urinating the standing position and law.
No.
You mean these are guys that I guess had to sit down?
Wow.
And allowed for to have regular sexual intercourse.
Despite these benefits, the procedure was now without its risks.
Infectious complications, they shift in the prosthesis position and the need for surgical
revisions were all fairly common problems.
That shifting thing is kind of dangerous because sometimes if it's like sticking out of
your side, that's not probably a good thing.
None of the past treatments for micro penis have been very effective before Ralph told
Roy to help.
So it's not uncommon for these patients to undergo multiple operations.
We don't know if they can have multiple orgasms, but they can certainly have multiple operations.
Complications are common with total phallic reconstruction, but at the end of the day, I love
that expression at the end of the day, all of the patients achieved good results and were
100% satisfied with their outcomes.
Ralph said, despite his potential for changing life of men with micro penis, Ralph noted
that total phallic reconstruction recently hasn't caught on yet elsewhere, but he's hopeful
that the presentation at the current meeting might help change it.
Well, there you go.
Something to read it look forward to.
Let's take a look at your left arm and see how much you got to give up.
5670560 pound 560 on a Verizon and Singular Wireless Lines.
WQA and hello.
Hi.
Told you.
WQA and hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How have we gone?
Great.
From the subject of your condition that you have there, but did you get to say a new
for a vet yet?
Yeah, got it.
Are you got it?
How many don't do a harmful?
I beg your pardon?
I'm the new health teacher.
A harmful?
A car poll.
Yeah.
What would be the question your favorite car all time?
Yeah, that are.
You can find out if you list your time at UV.
You know, something like that.
That sounds like a good one for Tuesday now that you mentioned it.
Perfect.
All right.
Thanks a lot, pal.
Yeah, I got my new 2005.
The one with the Achilles thing.
Entry.
Right.
Don't say entry.
Achilles, but haven't seen you yet, but I will very soon.
Well, that's a good idea.
So Tuesday's poll.
Oh, these people only, and Eric is playing hard to get, man.
He refuted.
He keeps pretending he doesn't hear me saying it.
I know he's your air in it about like, well, couldn't he do that?
He must keep track of all these old polls we've done.
Right?
Everybody's got a few old polls laying around.
Right.
Like, fishing poles.
Come on, Eric.
Give it up, baby.
Give it up.
Give up some props for old pops.
Well, babe, give me.
Yeah.
He's got them.
Stuff we haven't done in a long time.
Just like that one about movie endings.
I found this.
I don't know where I was leaving through some old crap.
And here it is from July of last year.
Now, that's a year and a half ago.
That's playing long enough.
The audience doesn't remember this.
Right?
Of course, me being the schmuck that I am, I shouldn't have told them we already did it.
But they, oh, you already did that one.
Well, listen.
Probably it's in the year and a half.
You've seen some other movies with great endings like Magnolia.
560, 560 in the horizon.
Sing it a wireless line.
WQA, and hello.
Hey, what's up, Neil?
How you doing, pal?
I love you, showman.
You're like the best thing out there next to Howard.
But hey, I heard you are talking about Frank Zappa the other day.
What's your favorite album?
Well, you need my favorite cut.
How's that?
All right.
You ready?
Hey there, people on Bob and Brown.
How do you like that?
You are the man.
I love Bob.
I am the man.
All right, see you, pal.
Yeah, well, we used to play the whole thing, but now of course, Joyce would have a schmuck
fit if we played that thing.
Well, not wait.
Let me try it.
Because you're pretty good with these buttons here, just to say.
The bleach's great.
Hey there, people on Bob and Brown.
I had a problem.
To see how the Q is boy and down.
My car is fast.
My teeth are shining.
I tell all the girls they can kiss my high knee.
Here I come.
Yeah, I'm the man.
I'm a fool.
I'm a legend star.
And I'm acting cool.
I got this year of year.
Here once they dealt with my fate.
Well, better do all the work and maybe later I'll read it all.
God, I am the American pretty.
I do not think out to explain it all.
I hand some tongue of a bitch.
Oh, right.
I'm gonna kill a good child.
And we real bitch.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Women with a red shell came free from all the proclamation.
Ready?
I'll tell you.
I won't regret it.
I'll fuck it.
Well, that was okay.
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm just saying, man.
No, listen, see, there was a sirens in the corner.
The word police.
Oh, even all around here, they got the word police.
No, seriously, there was nothing wrong with that.
There was no part of that word there.
It was fine.
And then you cut me like, you know, like, listen, there's other subject matter coming up that
we used to be.
No, there's not because I'm not playing anymore of it.
Okay.
I know what you're talking about, just like the sheriff beats too quick.
I know.
Right.
Anyway, stop.
Stop now.
Or you're gonna have another inquisition, man.
And this time you'll be up on the walls.
In fact, I'm pretty sure you read about Eastern time would be good.
If you're feeling a little cross with George, we're gonna nail him up right on the corner there right by a check subset.
We're gonna have George up on the cross.
The whole of that, Mel Gibson.
Move on to the Democratic Party.
We own it.
I like this story.
And it's about time we had some people with some balls.
Okay.
The Democrats need to grow a pair instead of just like sitting around their whining and despair.
Liberal powerhouse move on has a message for the professional election losers who run the Democratic Party.
We bought it.
We own it.
We're gonna take it back to which I say.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
I say.
Like that.
That's right.
Just like the QM wave.
How many times did I say that yesterday yesterday?
I'm fired, man.
That yesterday was a day that will live in infamy.
And it's really interesting as it was just a couple days after Pearl Harbor Day.
Even the Japs never saw a day like yesterday.
Unless maybe Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
A skating email from the head of Move On's Political Action Committee of the Group Supporters on Thursday.
Target's outgoing Democratic National Chairman and Wimp Terry McCollough.
He ain't even no Dick McCollough from the Tigers.
Remember Dick McCollough?
No.
Josh?
No.
Come on.
Let's hand it to the second basement.
Look at him hitting.
He used to hold a bat way up.
But that strange stance.
Anyway, ripped a hell out of term.
McCollough has a tool of corporate donors who alienated both traditional and progressive Democrats.
For years, the party's been led by elite Washington insiders who are closer to corporate lobbyists than they are the Democratic base.
Said the email from Move On Packs, Eli Pariser.
But we can't afford four more years of leadership by consulting class of professional election losers.
Boy, that's sure he said it just exactly the way it is.
Professional election losers, man.
They're the experts at it.
Under McCollough's leadership, the message said the party coddled the same corporate donors that fund Republicans to bring in money with expensive vision and integrity.
Oh, integrity.
What's that?
In the last year, grassroots contributors like Us gave more than $300 million to the Kerry campaign of the DNC and proved that the party doesn't need corporate connect to be competitive, the message be saying.
Now it's our party.
We own it.
We bought it.
We're going to take it back.
Pariser urged move on supporters to help support a DNC chair with a bold vision to represent Democrats outside Washington.
Democrats will vote at their February meeting in Washington as a successor to McCollough.
DNC spokesman, General Cabrera declined to engage in a tit for tat with move on, but praise McCollough's efforts.
Oh, geez.
We're like, right.
We're dancing on the edges now.
Call me crazy, but I think the fact that for the first time in party history, we outraged the Republicans and did so primarily through grassroots fundraising suit as they are again.
We did so through grassroots fundraising is something they proud of.
Cabrera said, see if I can do a little bit better this year.
By the way, I'm talking at 50 if any of you are.
It's great to do it.
There.
All right.
You have to do like about a half a beat too soon because otherwise you get this in there and you know what you say about.
Yeah, among those vying for the party chairmanship is former from on governor Howard Dean.
We love you.
How you demand that's the great white hope right there is Howard Dean.
He lets out a scream.
Right.
In fact, next time when he runs, if he does run again, he's going to like that and it'll get him in.
Tell me everybody QML vote for him.
Chris will be a whole new crew and early darling of move on cyber network of activists when he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination.
It says here Howard Dean.
He was the man and that's the reason they.
They ruined him and they killed him.
They conspired with the media and they just knocked him out of there because even Carl Rohan admitted that when the election was over, we were scared crampless of Howard Dean.
We're going to Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.
We're going to California and Texas and New York.
We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.
And then we're going to Washington and we see the take back the White House.
You're the shoes of the media, the media, the Rogers exclusively on 5th Street in the end.
But heads, it's the one to do our.

I know I saved this in my pile, but periodically I have to read this out loud.
I saw a thing on the Discovery Channel there that I, right now it was on PBS.
You know, one of the best HD channels is PBS, which I've told you this before, shocks me.
Because they're always winded about money and they don't have enough money.
But boy, the quality of their HD stuff is just phenomenal.
And they show a lot of these like travel shows, which you know I love that.
And they were showing Sicily, Cicilia, and they showed Mount Etna.
And we're talking about how Mount Etna is, I think they said 800,000 years old.
Okay. According to New Gallup pool, only about a third of Americans believe that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific theory that's been well-supported by the evidence.
While just as many say that it's just one of many theories, and there's not been supported by the evidence, the rest say they just don't have enough to say.
Furthermore, 45% of Americans also believe they've got created human beings pretty much in their present form about 10,000 years ago.
A third of Americans are biblical literars to believe that the Bible is the answer word of God is to be making literally word for word.
Oh, I forget what story this is from, but it says, well that certainly explains a lot.
Yeah, that explains it all right. That explains the results of that last election.
That explains why the Mugwams are all over, not just in the red states, but that are throughout even the blue states all over the place. Mugwams.
See, I want to tell you a little, especially with the holidays here right now.
If you participate in rituals of any kind, look in the mirror and say to yourself, I have been brainwashed, okay?
No matter what it is, if you part like the lighting of the menorah and the chapskis with a Christmas tree and the nativity scene, all of this up,
if you participate in any kind of religious rituals, then you are brainwashed. You need to be deprogrammed immediately, not sooner. Get the two A anonari or something, right? Or a slappery.
Yeah, hit the way a slappery, the slav house, the slav house.
It's not complicated. If you do things by rote, that just means that you've been conditioned. That's all.
I mean, I just don't believe that people want to be so weak. It's one thing to be weak. It's easy way out, right?
They want to be weak, thinking is effort.
I mean, the Munkies said, I want to be free, free like Michael said in Godfather 2.
I think I did have a good point. He started talking through like that, because even though the puffiness in the cheek went down after McCluskey broke his jaw, he started talking I was a speech thief.
I really always thought everybody was a random each.
That's right. I don't remember that part with Tom Hagen. I've got to see that again. I love a rock bottom.
You were too far. And the only reason he wasn't in Godfather 3 was with a money thing. It goes to show you, when you go the cheap way out and you bring in George Hamilton of all people,
I mean, George Hamilton belonged there about as much as Sophia.
Sophia Coppola, hey, we should have a Prozac Ronde.
Sophia will be right over to see a run. So just open the door.
Please.
We have a lot of open lines on there. I was prepared to take Zidians calls, even though my pile was still, oh, I like this story.
Speaking of, in fact, we've even got a little drop in here that's perfect for this story, where he says,
Here's for the Hollywood. Yeah, perfect for the story. London, a group of Christian protesters in Scotland.
Oh, did I ever tell you about the time I got that bus with him, silly Scottish people in Amsterdam to the airport?
You busted. Oh, brother. That was like last December's matter. In fact, year ago, full bunch of Scotsmen on there.
Wow. And what language do they speak? I'm not talking about the Scottish with a bro, but they have their own language too.
What is that? Is it what do they call that? Gaelic? Yeah, I think it is.
I'm not a big old Irish is Gaelic. I don't know what it is, but it's some bizarre.
And then I thought the most bizarre thing was when a one guy, where the hell is that? Oh, no.
What is that under where he says you got to stick your spoon in it? Stick. What's under stick? See, I thought spoon, not stick.
As in something, he says, you got the stick. You're a spooler. Don't worry. It's not going to bring you.
You should have seen where he stuck that spoon, but anyway, a group of Christian protesters in Scotland is called on police to prosecute a theater company for blasphemy because it's putting on a play about a...
Jesus, Jesus. Oh, no. If there is a blasphemy like this, Christians have the stand-up said, Stephen Green of Christian voice Jesus Christ, who protested outside of theater showing Terence McNally's controversial play, Corpus Christi, its an Andrews University.
But, body of Christ. Jesus Christ is being portrayed here as a foul mouth drunk and promiscuous homo sexual, and that's an insult to my faith green-tolled BBC radio. I'm a homo.
But the plays director, Zuzi Lindsay. I wonder if Zuzi is kind enough Lindsay, defended the production. He's not portrayed as a drunk and foul mouth. He doesn't say one bad words throughout the play.
Even though he might have been gay, rhymes would play. Christian voice was not placated. It's formerly largely complaint with the police.
Police? Arguing that the American playwright's work was blasphemous, no decisions have been taken yet. That's in Scotland.
Oh, man. They are really special, but in kills, like the Charles, for example, Prince Charles would have killed right. It just kills me.
56670560, pound 560 on a Verizon Singular Ravus Lines. The biggest sellout in the world is, Cool and Paul and John McCann have a race to the death going on right now. A duel.
Why 9QAM? Hello? Neil? Yes, sir? The scene is... I remember that scene in Godfather too. He says to Tom, Fredo is... I love Fredo, but he's weak and stupid and in this life and death, Tom. You're my brother. You're going to be the Don. You're going to be in charge of Rocco's men near everybody.
That's why when they walk out, they find that two dead bodies, Michael walks out to the train to go to Miami and then down to Cuban. Tom tells Rocco, OK, get rid of the bodies and Rocco says, oh, where's Michael? He says, Rocco, take care of it.
And then you see him walking... He's outside of the house. Right. Right. That's why he goes to Carson City to the brothel and takes care of the thing with the senator. Right.
So he becomes the boss. Boy, you are good, man. What did I ever do to you? I'm...
I can handle things, I'm smart. I'm like everybody says, no, I'm smart and I want to spend it.
Eight minutes after one and my cell phone has rung yet, George, what do you think that means that they're still confibrating?
Yeah, some high level powwow going on today, which I don't want to get into here on the air, which maybe I'm on Monday or maybe not depending on the outcome.
But just talk about a place where you'd love to be a fly in the wall. I'd love to see that. I would just... I would give a little piece of my left finger, my index finger.
WDQA and hello. Yeah. Hello. Yeah.
You're a lipper man for your pole.
So, you've got to go and ask the excellent one, sir. Yes, he sold out the party, sold out his religion, he sold it all out.
And happy Hanukkah, by the way.
And thank you so much. The season pays off. Happy Sookas. Happy Simha Stora. What am I? Happy Pace Off.
Well, you know, something we got a drop in that I wasn't even aware that she ever did this one. Where is it?
Have the season pays off. Happy Kram. But to know that. Have the season pays off.
Yeah, since she passed away, life hasn't been worth a crap, you know, right? And not only her, but...
She a mother also. Yeah. Well, that's it. It hasn't been the same.
And you know something I think this is the Lord's way of evening out the grief. That's why we work where we do it.
See, because now that my mother is pushing up daisies, now that there are other people compensating for the lack of grief and stress and service and nagging, that I would get where she's still alive,
you see what I'm saying? It's the Yen in the end again, man. The Yen in the out, the up and the down, the Yen in the end. That's life. It's crap. WDQA and hello.
Yeah. Meal. Yes, sir. How about that gap tooth wench, condolizard right?
Condolizard is a good one. Excellent. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Pauline. Have a great weekend. Good day to you.
All right. Good day. Condolizard. I like that. How much did you get?
She's a forked tongue-tongued bitch that condolizard. Oh, don't be picking on Dr. Rice. Yeah, right.
We'll pick on whoever we want to pick on. Okay. Go back to Fox News, Heather. You bitch. You idiot.
Even though a lot of people around the building did want to do you. But nevertheless, just put some duct tape around that.
Well, anyway, I don't want to get too deeply into that. I will speak of that prison
or abuse was worse than officials admitted documents show. I got some stuff to hear to
interspers. I want to get all my fish, my ducks, whatever these are. My ducks with hoisin sauce.
More than two months after the Abu Garib prison scandal in Iraq shocked the world.
An official memo described how military intelligence officers witnessed further prison abuse in Baghdad.
But we're threatened to prevent them from reporting it. The memo was the most recent in the collection of government documents released Tuesday.
It was dated June 25 and written by Vice Admiral Lowell E. Jacobi who directed the defense intelligence agency.
Lowell described how to see. I don't understand that if his name is Lowell E. Jacobi, why did they say Lowell? Why did they come by his first name?
See, that's the mistake. Jacobi described how to the IA officers assigned as interrogators of a special operations unit designated this task for 626 witnessed evidence of prisoner abuse while working at an unnamed temporary detention facility in Baghdad.
The extensive collection of government documents suggest the abuse of detainees in Iraq and elsewhere was more widespread and systematic than senior officials have fast up to.
Officials repeatedly have tried to characterize abuse last year at Abu Garib as an isolated series of incidents.
A small number of low ranking soldiers have already been prosecuted. In other words, they're the ones that they're going to sell out.
Speaking of selling people out. They're the ones that are going to be the scapegoats.
The documents released to the however reveal that senior US officials who claimed that they were unaware of the abuse were repeatedly informed of accusations of abuse through crowd official channels.
They also suggest that these other reports of abuse failed to trigger investigations into what increasingly appears to have been a widespread pattern of prisoner abuse in Afghanistan, Iraq, and at Gitmo in Cuba.
You see that? We can always get Cuba into the mix.
Into the mix. That's another expression of good work. Into the mix.
Oh, we've been doing that.
24.7 and in the mix.
Ah, or in the hunt.
Huh?
They use those expressions in golf a lot because I like golf or idiots.
Well, he's back in the hunt. Yeah, well, they like that.
Like how do you Easter eggs? What are they hunting for?
Okay, like quail. What are they doing? Dan Quail? What's that all about?
Don't forget, join QN tonight at 7 o'clock for a live broadcast with a big bangos at the AAA at the AAA arena.
And with the QMQ, these are the hooters in base size. Stopped out for specials on President De Beer to watch the heat game too.
If you like or if you care, which I don't, that's 7 o'clock tonight at the bangos and at hooters.
You know what's that amazing time of the year again?
Unless, of course, you hate crowded malls, long register lines, parking hassles, crazy shoppers.
So this year, why not make your gift giving a little bit easier for you and your loved ones?

1-800-MAC, 560-WQM, a drunken soldier.
But these stories that come out of England, man, they got some real multi-problem.
Lots of problems.
A drunken soldier sparked a security alert when he left the costume party, dressed as a suicide bomber.
Wearing a turban, false beard and a combat jacket, stuff with pretend explosives.
British police said today, why don't I take it about them silly brits, huh?
It's pretty fun.
You go to a costume party, dressed as a terrorist and full-redgain, yeah?
Of course, if they're British, they got to be red here.
A member of the public called police after seeing the sergeant in his costume walking along the road near the all-vershaut army base in Southern England on Wednesday.
That's definitely a good place to be walking around near an army base in full-redgain, yeah?
15 police squad cars armed with officers, dog handlers and members of the Royal Military Police were called to be alert.
People, I believe it's 1-19, my phone has rang up.
The soldier, and by the way, if it does, I'm going to pick it up right in the instrument stream like when Hank's bookie calls me in the middle of his room.
The soldier, a member of the Cold Stream Guards who had been attending a costume party celebrating his regiment's rule in the 1815 Battle of Waterloo was arrested and spent the night in custody.
It was charged with a public order offense and fined around 150 boxes.
Big deal.
I ain't no saying.
Now, here's a big thing.
Where is, uh, Palm Harbor?
Uh, you know, up there, there's a ways.
Uh, I think it's on a west coast.
Or is it on, I don't know.
Where is it?
I have no idea.
Palm Bay, I know Palm Bay is by Melbourne. Where is Palm Harbor?
Anyway, Burger King got some surrogues, baby. They're not taking this too lightly.
This sponge bob square pants thing.
They're getting really p-o'd about this.
You know how these balloons have been missing?
Right.
Stolen.
Because while our troops are trying to defend themselves and stay alive with very, very inadequate protection over there in Iraq,
what we've got is people worried about sponge bob square pants a lot.
That's what people are concerned about.
Not that Americans.
Not that Iraq is certainly because after all, let them lose their souls there.
What they are.
A Burger King manager fired an employee after she refused to return a 10-foot tall sponge bob square pants balloon her boss gave her,
which he then sold for a thousand, twenty-five bucks in internet auction.
What's wrong with that?
The boss gave it to her for a Christ sakes.
Yeah, but he didn't think she was going to make money on it.
Viny Richard's 36th said a manager recently gave her the fifty pound balloon that flew top the Burger King as part of a corporate cross promotion for the sponge bob square pants movie.
And I've actually said it's part of that sponge is what they used to be making them burgers at Burger King.
Because that's what I had there and I always said tastes like rubber.
Maybe it's not rubber anymore from good year.
Maybe it's just sponge.
But once she asked permission from the company to be photographed by the Tampa Tribune, see it's over there on that coast,
which was writing a story about the balloon and it's listing on the internet auction house eBay,
she was told to stop talking to the media and return to balloon.
I really liked my job at Burger King, Richard said, but I just couldn't give back to sponge bob.
Or of course a thousand bucks.
She said she worked part of her lunch shift Wednesday and then was fired from her six dollar and fifteen set an hour job for not returning to balloon.
Store manager Paula Kilgore said to her in subordination and her termination papers.
They gave the balloon to me and I can always get another job just like that one I guess Richard said, things just turned bad.
After I told my managers I was going to take pictures of newspaper.
She said she had time to give the balloon to her two year old grandson, but it wouldn't fit in his room.
So if he posted it for sale on eBay where it was one of dozens listed, the balloon made national news recently after they started being stolen from Burger King Roof.
Well who wouldn't want to have the ruins sponge bob through Burger King square pants to balloon, right?
That's right.
What's off the spectrum?
He wouldn't want that.
Sure is how but beats eating there.
Richard said he would use it and probably taste better too.
Richard said he used the money she got from the winning bitter in Tyrone, Georgia for Christmas gifts and to pay off that from Tyrone, Georgia.
Restaurant manager Kilgore to climb comment today.
He referred cost to the offices of Clifford Clearwater LLC, which owns Burger King where Richard's worked.
Of course he can come at Friday from Clifford Clearwater was never turned.
He's still analyzing it.
Whatever really blows.
George Foreman it says here.
It says women love Neil too.
It's from a lady obviously.
George Foreman now why did he sell out because he's doing commercials now?
I reckon.
I'll put him on there but I love George Foreman.
I love that lean, mean grill and machine which George got me for whatever many years ago.
But that many years ago.
Right.
Anyway it's a good thing.
In fact I probably should get one right here.
The lean, mean grill and machine.
Sure you can grill it.
He's got new ones now.
Does he really?
Bigger pants here.
I'll have he ain't no Ron Pope deal.
I'll tell you that.
Nobody.
Nobody can set it and forget it like Ron Popeel and that crowd.
Although they got that fat tubby guy.
What's his name?
Shares not Chef Tony.
There's another fat tub that's doing commercials for a thing that's a rip off of the.
What do they call it?
The thing that Ron Popeel sold the rotisserie.
The rotisserie.
Very good.
And this one is kind of like those goofy looking things with a round top and he eats by infrared or whatever it does.
And he says just set it and as a matter of fact walk away is what he says.
Just walk away.
Yeah.
Just set it and walk away.
And we just said and we walk away.
Who are you kidding?
And I represent somebody off our head.
Oh no.
Jesus.
I mean who down you can us infomercial watchers.
How about you Josh has seen the Ron Popeel infomercial?
Oh yeah all the time.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
You haven't seen that.
Not that early.
How about the one for the knife set?
The knives.
The 87,000 knives for like 84,000 easy payments of 299.
Yeah.
You're life is just so narrow you have to expand your horizons.
No it's not.
That's right.
That's the problem.
Well maybe that's narrow too.
I'm busy.
Yeah he's busy.
Okay he's busy.
So in his oats.
Eating his oats.
Whatever he's doing.
Sniffing his finger.
Have you smell?

144 twice just go to a 5.60
When it's just a date that you wonder why

Why do I need to bet
Everything is fine
You're fine I'm fine
The Josh is fine
And Howard fine is fine
You're Howard fine
No
Alkyd into a 10th major marine attack
That's what the report says
And again from London
I'm telling you why am I doing all this British stuff
There are people care about the Brits and of course
No
Have a Brit Day why not
Yeah let's have an all Brit Day
There was this Scottish man
There was something there
I don't know what that's all about
It must be from like the wind blowing like
When they were in him kills
The wind must blow like straight up into their
Correct them
Privates or whatever
There is the BBC world
By such things as high consumer death
It's not a country
And certainty is one about the US economy
And the thread
Oh God
All I will say they're pound is worth a hell of a lot
The dollars crap
Now anyway
Alkyd will attempt to attack on a key maritime target
In the next 12 months with potentially
Devastating economic consequences
Security experts say
We don't want to get you like all psychotic
But I got two of these stories here
And you should be well warned
You know what I'm saying
Should you prepare it
You should be really frightened
Because that's what America likes to do
Is keep you really scared like Michael Moore tells you
Keep everybody in a panic
And they are
Who step along just fine
The maritime sector remains extremely vulnerable to terrorism
And we expect an attempted attack
On a significant maritime target in 2005
Security from
Agedist defense services
And it's annual terrorism report today
Alkyd's ability to launch an attack
Has been made easier by the conflict in Iraq
Which is provided
You hear that?
What
Let me read that sentence again
See you're still thinking about
Oh we're fine
Get off it
Okay
Alkyd's ability to launch an attack
Has been made easier by the conflict in Iraq
Which is provided an opportunity for a new generation of
Mujahideen to learn warcraft ages added
All right good game
I completely agree with this
And Paul Beaver
An independent defense analyst
In fact the other guy said
Well we'll just leave it to Beaver
He said any attack would probably be an oil-related maritime target
Around a cruise liner
Both because of their economic importance
The warning comes just months after Britain's top navy officer
We're sure to similar warning that
Alkyd would try to attack
Merchant shipping in a bit to disrupt world trade
And
Yeah I don't want to get people into a panic
That's not the purpose of the show
Don't get nervous don't get hysterical
Yellow light green light purple light all over the crab
But
Oh that's the phone's ringing
You better talk
So thanks for being timid up to this really cool clock
And though because he said a fact
About the clock
And that
No it's not syncing up
I don't know why I think people were in the interior
But that's all right
Because we have to sync it up to the other clock
And the building anyway
It's in so well
Thank you for the clock
Thank you for the birthday
We're going to have to go
It's got to be a moment
Really
So now we can
You know because I you know how these rooms are really in balance
Oh fair like I have to wear a parker
And here in your warden from Utah shorts in there
Yeah
Sitting on a block of ice
You try to keep cool
It's 73.2 in here
Just so you know
And that's up near the ceiling
So it's uh
It's uh 89.5
We'll get a thermometer for that room too
And then we can compare
Huh?
Hey what's going on
Good news
Yeah
I was the lady from FedEx to
I'll tell you what the custom charges are going to be
$191.26
Which also by the way I'll be sure and expense that
And uh it'll be her Monday
I'll be giving me a project for like Monday
I thought I was going to have a project for a week in
But I want
If the audience wants to know what we're talking about
It's the CDX
The ones that you hear skipping and popping and spooking it like
And I don't know why
Why they both went out at the same time
You're lucky
And our fine engineer here who is really excellent
He just didn't know nothing about
Reallying the lasers
I know is everything
But I figure
What we'll do is I'll stick in the new ones there
And we'll take these and send them back to the factory
We'll always have our CDX
Because what is life without
And then of course if we can just get the CDs to put in them
Yeah
Yeah
CDs
Oh you're asking for too much now, Neal
So those premiere people
I'm just starting to get a little paranoid about them
You know the cheap channel connection
Because they own premiere
Keep channel
That hates me like poison
And of course the feeling is mutual
We hate cheap channel
Pete Boulder, Rana, Frank Wolf
All of them
They should only croak a wicked death
Especially Pete Boulder
The assassin
Hey by the way Pete
Dana
Yeah
That wasn't a good one
That's our message from QM to Pete Boulder over there
And by the way all your stations suck Pete
Every single one of them they suck
They stink their pathetic
They're tragedy
They're an embarrassment
And so are you by the way
And congratulations on destroying so many careers and lives
There's a guy you really wonder
How does Pete Boulder go home and look at the mirror
No wonder he's got a beard now like facial crap
You know
He probably doesn't look at the mirror long enough to shave
Because he sees a real evil dude in the reflection
Anyways being in a beveled dude
Where is here's the other one
I'll get this out of the way
And then we'll go to like some fun games
Right
I'll sing it by
Terrorists may seek to down aircraft
By shining shining powerful lasers into carpets
To blind pilots during landing approaches
Oh my god
US officials more than a bulletin-distributed nation-wide
The memo sent by the FBI
A Homeland Security Department
Where their new skinhead is in charge
Or will be very soon
Says there's evidence that terrorists have explored
Using the lasers as weapons
There's no specific intelligence indicating al-Qaeda
Of the groups might use lasers in the US they added
Although lasers are not proven methods of attack
Like improvised explosive devices in the hijackings
Terrorist groups overseas have expressed interest in using these devices against two men's sight
The memo said
In certain circumstances if laser weapons adversely affect the eye
Set of both pilot and copilot during a non-instrument approach
There's a risk of airliner crashed the agency said
In September of pilot for Delta airlines reported an eye injury from a laser beam
Shown into the cockpit during a landing approach in Salt Lake City, Utah
The incident occurred around five miles from the airport to plane landed safely
They like that
And of course, where did that come from?
Well they use these lasers all around airports as range
Finders like my radar detector which also detects laser always goes off like that
So there was year-to-one that's threatening all these aircraft is that
Oh geez, yes that's me
FBI and other federal officials are investing
It's not clear if a crime was committed or if the laser was directed into the cockpit by accident
Steve Lucky
I wonder if he's keen to that dog you know
Steve Lucky a retired airline pilot who's chairman of airline pilots association national security committee
Said pilots are concerned about a recent increase in laser incidents
But don't know what to make of them
He said he's learned of two or three cases in the past 90 days
The most recent incidents appear to be aimed at pilots in the vicinity of airports
Lucky said a few seem to be intentionally. We're wondering why and what's going on
How do you like that? What's going on?
And if Marvin Gaye were only here to answer the question
I think that we will watch this
That's exclusively
460
Steve
Why the hell are you busted?
I'm dying on the air
Every day's a new morning
We have a yellow light that must be
They have something to hide that's how they
Oh my god
They do they have eyes
What's really
And we kind of
Some love you
And you move like a yellow light
Are you sure?
I
The corporate be your right
And that's why we have a yellow light
Catch, explain
The meaning of what he's like to
What he's like to
Which is that his dance with the set of no friends
And no one starts to move
It's me that I'm there
What can you do to say have a yellow light
What's that I mean
Something they can divide
That's why we have a yellow light
But this time it's me
145, which is so much of a very sweet
A Canadian lady coming from FedEx and saying
Have you had your packet here?
And I said what is going to be delivered
And she said Monday
I said thank you very much
And I'll make the check out for how much you got it
And so you know what that enables me to do now
That I know they're not coming today
And I don't have to sit around here on my ass waiting for that delivery
You can turn your photo lunch
Yeah
How do you like that?
Now I know I don't have to sit around like Patrick
McGuin in the prison or I can go to lunch
Yeah
Will you go to lunch?
Okay, okay
I'll have this
Man, oh man he's awful
Wow
Okay, let's take a look at that pool
Okay, I just knocked the mic
I never knew that
That's great
You know, we've been out a lot of stress
Yeah, this is a lot of work
Yeah, like an old sponge
You know, he just keeps like ringing it
ringing it and finally just plops
Plops for pops
Who is the biggest sellout?
That's our pool question
Today it's going over pretty big
It's going over bigger than Murray Town
I'm more and the six million dollar man
493 votes
Which I may not sound like a lot
But I'm afraid of that
Ain't too bad, right?
Right
We'll take it
Colin Powell and John McCain continue to be locked today
In a
Unbelievable like an advice grip
Colin Powell 113 and John McCain 110
Three votes apart after nearly 500 votes
Ain't that amazing?
It's pretty close
We can't separate the two
When in doubt they both sell out
Then as Miller 56 he's starting to move up
Phil Henry 54
How do you like that?
Phil Henry
Okay
54
A total sellout
A total turncoat
A BS artist
Of the worst kind
We used to like him for about five minutes
John carry 26 really julie Annie 25
Ricky Williams

He's in
Not only that but hysterical

The last thing we want to
Especially at this stage of our lives
Is histrionics
Okay
I'd like to suggest that
To many many people around us
The last thing we want is histrionics
We would just like to live a nice
Peaceful, placid life
You're just got his own issues of course
And that's the way it is
This is life he is chosen
And they're not too good
But nevertheless
And I just want to be far distance
See that's one good thing
I want to be very far distance
From all of this
Contra tops
All of this
When you get to be an old fart like I am
You just want to
I can understand that why
It was old fart in the condo
I'm beginning to relate to it
I'm beginning to be one of them
A little bit
A little bit
I'm telling the world
I don't mean by that
I mean they just want to live in their own corner
The world would be left alone
Okay?
They don't want me
Father was
Screaming little kids

Unless of course it's their own grandchildren
They don't want me
Fathered by people with pets
And barking little dogs

They're until he finally
Everybody kicked his ass out of town
And then he, yeah
Soot everybody
Everybody inside
To the stations

Of the whole prisoner series
How do you like that?
You know, I have watched two of them now
All right
Look, I got these other great movies to watch
Like video drama
Like video drama
Now why did I get that?
And part of the reason I got it
I didn't discuss it
I told you after the fact
I can't blame you for that
We can blame you for a lot of things
And like, that's a deal
It's in vote
But I can't blame you for video drama
Look, you go into a
You go into your like neighborhood video
To like here it's HMV
It's a big chain
It's like
Blockbuster without Wayne
And everywhere they've got 8 million DVDs in there
What a selection
And you know, you look around
To try to find something interesting
That you never saw before
Or maybe something that you did see
But you'd like to watch it on DVD
Whatever
And in your perusion and whatever
