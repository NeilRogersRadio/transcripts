What a joke!
Mind if I shed hair stranger?
I'm not gonna do about it.
Where he head?
I'm going west to Deadwood.
Deadwood, then.
Well, I hear they got a lot of curses going on.
I'm looking for a job.
With going to work, you look in fear.
Well, I want to be a coolie.
You know, one of them jinxed that word on the railroad.
He ain't Chinese.
Then I can wait for the China.
Push legal dope.
Next stop, Deadwood, under Russia.
And, who?
Dambanka.
Hell, this is it.
Oh, who love?
Thank you, Dambanka.
I said one step behind.
This must be Deadwood, alright?
Yeah, that's me.
Thank you, I know.
What's that guy's going in there?
I'll put a rubber band on my head.
Ooh!
You better go see Owls' Where I Laugh.
God, I'm fine.
Maybe I could be a hooker.
That's it.
Oh, what the fuck?
You want to talk to me about that?
Yeah, I used to be a big star.
See?
But I got the whole...
Oh, I'm looking for work.
You don't care, son of...
Get this ugly!
You old man out of my office!
And beat him to the piss!
I ain't stupid, I'm a lie!
I don't care to what I say!
Wait!
One more!
No care to treat bitches!
I'm Toshin'!
Ow!
Don't do that!
20 after 10 at 560 WDQM.
Here's the poll question today, which is already up and has got a few votes.
One will be the biggest impact of Howard Stern on WDQM.
He'll send the ratings way up.
He'll screw up Neil's show.
He'll bring tons of people back to AM Radio.
Not much.
I don't give a crap about Stern.
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds.
Or he'll increase the crank calls big time.
Ha ha ha!
I think I touched all the bases on that poll very well.
And by the way, that is our poll today with the elected or not clearance and Duff.
So Duff was over there in Fort Myers and with the Robert Greeper practicing for a censoring
the Howard Stern Show starting on Monday of being the Dump Button Monkeys sitting there
with our triple Dump.
Never take a triple Dump.
Well, anyway.
Better fact.
Let's see, Craig and Miami says the biggest impact on the Stern Show will be complaints filed
by all those fascist, quizzling old Jews in Miami Beach.
And others, by the way.
Quizzling old goyem.
Speak of quizzlings.
Yes, we have the sovereignty video is up and running on the side.
Okay, the sovereignty one, which is what we play that clip for where Bush gets laughed at by the audience
because he has no idea what they're talking about.
The clip is up there on neo-rages.com.
So long we're taking a peek at Eva Herzegovah and at our voting on our poll, take a peek at that too.
And also take a peek at Ricky Williams' appropriate video if you haven't seen that.
Or even look at it again.
In fact, the best way to watch that is if you're smoking a big fat one and then watching the video.
At same time.
Indeed.
Kind of like doing it in the stereo.
So anyway, we've got a few votes on there already.
Let's take a peek and see how it's coming because we have very limited time today.
Thanks to the Marlins.
Oh right.
We love the Marlins and especially when they play day games.
And like I said the other day, in fact, maybe that was another one of my psychic moments.
Remember when I said to you, what's really going to be great is when Stern is on
and we started about 10.45, close to 11 o'clock.
And then at 12.30 we bail off for the Marlins pre-game show.
Oh yeah!
And get paid not the same but more because Stern coming on guarantees the double bonus every reading book.
Guarantee.
Cheng.
Are you starting with a change stuff again?
Oh, touching.
What will be the biggest impact of Howard Stern on WDQA and we got 43 votes so far, nothing in the spectacular.
He'll send the ratings way up 18.
I don't give a crap about Stern 9.
He'll bring tons of people back to AM Radio 6.
He'll screw up Neil Show 5.
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds 3.
He'll increase the crank calls big time 2 and not much none.
Oh!
Big O!
None say the whole thing.
There's no big impact.
I think that's obviously true, right?
Right.
But for this audience it's pretty amazing.
Now you saw that the L president ate nominated Porter Goss of Florida to be the new director of the CIA.
Right, Goss, the other political.
Now first of all, probably most people don't know this, that's not his real name.
If you know what his real first name is, I give up.
Misha.
Yeah, that's his real name.
And of course it comes to Jewish so he didn't want to be called Misha Goss.
Oh.
President Bush has said that Representative Porter Goss is the right man to lead the CIA.
This is in the New York Daily News today to lead the CIA but as a five months ago, the nominee didn't think even he was qualified to work there.
Much less be the director.
The Florida Republican tool filmmaker Michael Moore in March, it is true I was a case officer,
claimed this in services officer and yes, I do understand the commission of the business,
but I couldn't get a job of the CIA today.
I'm not qualified.
He's got this on film, by the way.
Goss who went on to become a multi-millionaire in the congressman after leaving his job as an agent explained,
I don't have the language skills.
I, you know, my language skills were romance languages and stuff working for Arabists today.
I don't have the cultural background probably and I certainly don't have the technical skills as my children remind me every day.
Dad, you got to get better on your computer.
So the things that you need to have, I don't have.
More interviewed, Goss, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for the Documentary Fair and High 9-11,
the part was edited out by Moore Still has all the footage.
I'm sure it's a lie.
Liberal lie.
Michigan Goss faces tough criticism in the confirmation process from colleagues like Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator J. Rockefeller,
who agree with him that he is not qualified.
Here's the guy who says, oh, I'm not qualified to even work there.
Much less be director.
And Bush says, oh, yes, stick him on there because he's a good partisan Republican.
And it will suck up to the Florian's real good too.
That's a bit rich.
Now, do you think that most people in Florida have any idea about Michigan Goss?
I don't think I have any clue what that's all about.
5.670560.
We'll kind of interspersive you called here today because I know we got a lot of great calls coming lately.
We'll have some heavy-duty stuff to pass along and then we'll zip right into that Marlon pre-game show.
It sounds like a plan to make.
Like it about 12...
About 30, man.
About 30.
And then of course, like I said, after the Volga game, you got Mohawar David.
Oh, don't go.
Going in for the suspended Hank Goldberg.
He much beloved and much mist-hank Goldberg, the Humper.
The Rotten.
Superstar, sports radio, what do you have to know?
I'm going to tell you, if they think we're going to sit still on this show and watch you Hank,
if you know, just tossed on ceremony slay off the door, they're not going to happen.
We're not going to sit still, but we're not going to put up with it, all right?
You grave robbers.
You'd easily be...
Oh, it just tells me that the kid with a banjo, he's still hanging out over there at Beasley Headquarters on a West Coast.
Yeah, still pushed.
Yeah, got a little long in the tooth, but of course that's the one tooth.
He gives Numeen the expression long in the tooth.
He's still picking on it in the banjo, too.
Somebody QA in the hospital.
Hello.
Somebody QA in the hospital.
Hi, Valley.
Somebody QA, by the way, a fat boy is still in the hospital.
QA in, hello.
Hey, yeah, how you doing?
Good morning, buddy.
Great.
Hey, listen, I want to talk a little bit about the weather.
You know, when there's a hurricane and on the right side of that hurricane, not only do you not get rained,
but the weather is fantastic.
It clears up, blue skies, and everything.
So one thing to remember, with the hurricane, there's always a blow and a suck, okay?
Yeah.
All right.
I think your call was one of those, in fact, maybe both.
26 past 10 at 5.
60.
Is he picking on Brian or across again?
Yeah.
Good.
Nice going.
A little Brian or across the weather, furry.
Getting everybody whipped up into a frenzy.
Is there any rain out there?
Look out your window right now.
I'll be right back.
See any rain?
No.
In fact, I'm looking out my window.
I see blue skies.
The sun is shining.
Looks beautiful.
Hey, if we are what we eat, why don't we just eat better?
Well, the truth of the matter is we are creatures of heaven when it comes to eating.
We don't want to give up those comfort foods.
Our taste buds basically rule our logic.
For those of you out there on low carb diets, you know how hard it is to live without pizza.
So if you're on one of the low carb diets, cut and carbs' cafe has got a real treat for you.
Cut and carbs' cafe will find them in sunrise.
They're building up a following for their multi-grain pizza.
Their multi-grain pizza is full of fiber that delivers a great taste.
Imagine that a pizza you really can eat while staying two-year low carb diet.
It's all about their philosophy of good low carbs, good ones.
Cut and carbs' cafe understands that you owe it to yourself and your kids to eat better.
So how about eating a tasty pizza with less carbs and turning those carbs into lean muscle?
And there's nothing like having a lean muscle.
Give them a try by calling them at 9.5.4.
5.14.001.
I think they only want me to do this so I can read that phone number 80 million times ago.
9.5.4.514.
Oh! Oh!
Oh! One.
They're located in the same place as Applebee's and Office Depot and the Sungrace.

Look all the 65 species.
The radio's on yours now.
A few in.
I guess that's okay.
I see you screwed me up on that.
What would it be?
No, Karen screwed me up on the whole thing.
I'll skip that.
We don't have time for it anyway.
Right.
I was going to put a Brian Rorckross bit.

I think Duff is going to have a nervous breakdown.
We should have put that on there too.
Okay.
Duff Lindsay has a nervous breakdown.
Yeah, let's get that on there right away.
I'll add it.
Because he had a couple of days of practice over there on a West Coast.
And evidently yesterday, I can't use the N word.
But evidently, the entire last 45 minutes of this during show were involved in various descriptions of the N word.

I don't have time for all this.
Let me finish.
I eat some hot.
Hello.
I am Teresa Heinz Kelly.
I know fine languages.
That makes me smarter than you.
I am a billionaire.
That makes me richer than you.
I have been married to two politicians.
That makes me a whole lot, unhappier than you.
So just find my grandpa.
Sit down and shut up.
And if you don't like what I am saying,
SHABET!
The Teresa Heinz carry book of etiquette is available wherever, find me.
Shut up!

1047-560WQM Marlon pregame at 1230.
The Cardinals in town are playing at Marlins again.
Marlins had a couple of tough losses.
Can't score any runs.
They got the runs.
Not.
Now let's fast you just send me if there's anything I love.
It's people that tell me what to say and what to think and what to do.
I love that.
It says it's great that Howard Stern is going to be hurting it in South Florida.
The more freedom of speech, at least as much as a lot of the day on the air waves, the better.
Plus since Howard is increasingly filling his airtime with bush bashing,
that can only help our cause, especially in this way instead of Florida.
I can curl with that whole heartedly.
In fact, maybe Howard and I can team up to make sure that Kerry wins Florida.
Huh?
Maybe.
It says now another part in underlined and in a big bowl print.
However, it is crucial.
Oh, and before I read the rest of this, this is a hoot.
I noticed that you, I'm looking at that radar, there's a little blob in the glades,
but it's nowhere near a data browser.
I noticed that you, now I want them up, Lindsay to understand.
I said, let's put on there.
Duff Lindsay will have a nervous breakdown.
He said, okay.
And then you put on the pole.
Duff Lindsay will have another nervous breakdown.
Is that what you said?
No, it's something something like something the stones would sing.
Is it maybe his 19th?
Or maybe it's like,
another nervous breakdown.
That's bad.
But at any rate, he's got any votes.
He's got one.
He probably voted that.
Anyway, this facts, unsigned, of course.
However, it is crucial that QAM not censor Howard show locally.
I sure hope that Muckers listening to this.
In this post-superbowl wardrobe malfunction era,
Howard's network already has at least five layers of dumps and delays.
He's constantly doing battle with his network censors
who are hard at work protecting his listeners.
Don't add to the unlistability of the show.
For QAM, this is the perfect example of you knew what you were getting scenario.
Remember the Rush Limbaugh and the ESPN?
Or Scott Farrell on QAM?
If QAM is bringing Howard on board for his ratings,
why would a wanna further chop up a show that's already chopped up at the network level?
When it's precisely that on the edge content that brings in listeners,
well, I guess we want a lot of on the edge content brings in listeners,
but people don't want to lose their license, goofball, expert.
It says, by the way, as soon as Burshines is in a radio and decency act in the law,
which will penalize not only stations but also broadcasters,
Howard's his, he will just play music to one of the 17 months left on his contract.
Great, that'll bring in the end revenues and listeners.
He also said that as soon as Mel Carmison got canned or left the infinity
and via a con that he was gonna bail out and he'd take a walk along with some other people.
Did he say that?
Yes, he did.
Did he take a walk?
No.
Is he still there?
Yes.
Yes.
Also, and here's my favorite part of this facts.
I love people that are condescending that talk down to you like,
well, you better understand this and you better understand that.
Also, don't integrate stern listeners.
Studies are showing that they were intelligent, wealthy,
and they can impact in the election and support our anti-Bursh cars all the same team.
Some of them, I'm sure, are intelligent, wealthy and will make an impact.
A lot of them are morons, just like our audience.
So this is so an answer about, don't say this.
I'll say whatever I want to say, okay?
Unless, of course, it's about something we can't say, like Hank.
Our good close personal fat friend Hank,
which really frosted my ass.
I know that they would just like to have him like Vanishing Disappear
and an addition to which anything that Moe has involved,
I always wonder what kind of subversive stuff just might be going on in the background.
You know what I mean?
I wonder what kind of crap is going on there.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Paraiso Wireless Line.
Porter don't call me Misha Goss, says he's not qualified to be even a member of the CI,
much less the director, and Michael Moore has got it on film,
the interview right from the Horses ass.
I love it.
What will be the biggest impact of how it's stern on QA and 241 votes is our,
well, we're getting a few votes on this one anyway.
He'll send the ratings way up 81.
I don't give a crap about stern 60.
He'll screw up Neal's show 37.
He'll bring tons of people back to AM Radio 29.
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds 20.
He'll increase the crank calls big time 8, not much impact 5,
and definitely you'll have another nervous breakdown.
Another nervous breakdown.

National Hurricane Center now. What's that guy's name? You know, I don't know. What
uh, Sean, is it a requirement to work that they have absolutely no
personality at all? Are you like a deadpan dead pus? I mean, that guy is pathetic.
They just had him on CNN and he said, Oh, beware on the West Coast or Florida. West
Coast. For as the hurricane, it's gonna make that little turn that you turn over
the West Coast to Cuba and come up along the West Coast of Tampa and be wearing
the keys. We got how many listeners we got in the keys.
He's got 30 men. Mattin down the hatches. Ron Harrison is still dead, right?
Far as I know. Yeah. I just, I just don't get it. I just don't understand so much crap
that happens. What will be the biggest impact of Howard's
during coming to QM this coming Monday morning, August 16th from 6 a.m. to
whenever he's good and ready to give up the ghost and we're more than happy to
sit in the background and the woodwork while Duff is in there with a yellow button
banging and banging and banging and banging. That's a Robert Creeper said he's
spent most of the last two days over there and he was doing banging on it.
They're installing it now as a matter of fact. Are they really? Yes they are. The
82nd delay is an 80 or 30 man. It's a multi-layered multi-rear
word delay. So all you're certain people just be happy that you're going to
get whatever little tidbits you got, you know, whatever a couple of words
here and a couple of words there and then in between Duff's going to be playing
that Thor music. Yeah. Which is there's a little message in that mean that we're
two chickens, Nick, who puts a real stuff on here so we're just going to download
and see how it goes. You're going to be hearing that a lot. I'm sure. Wait we have a preview.
Yes. Oh you can't say.
I'm going to get it going again though. 346 votes on the poll. I give it a full result when I feel like I
wouldn't have a lot of time to deal around here because we got that Marlon pregame show.
Now in case you wonder what this is all about the game was scheduled for tonight but
because the weather theory is about everybody all whipped up into a frenzy about the hurricane.
There are some scattered showers that look in the radar. There's a little bit of pop-up
here and pop up there and whatever. It's popping up all over the place. A little bit. Nothing
in the nothing moment is right now but because they were really a feared and scared they don't
want to lose this game. It's a big big-ass game. The cardinals in town tonight. I have the
best record in baseball and continue to be. It's just amazing and I don't get it. But so they
moved again to an afternoon game. War of five. You can head over there right now and fill
up the ballpark. I see the only had 18,000 some obvious they did the rain last night.
Yeah. Was there like some kind of a tornado? Was there like a hurricane the end of the
world? Cloud in the sky? Pigeon with diarrhea? What was the story last night? They only
weak fire. Huh? Hale of fire. Pretty weak. Considering. And that's right I forgot though
that they've lost a few games. In fact if you look at the mothlies and the ratings you'll
notice that in June even though the Marlins did very well in the spring book on our
station and on TV as well with the ratings they've ever had. If you look at the June
number it's way way down from May. Oh it's picking the numbers right in fall. It's just
dawned on me. I don't know why I'm a little slow sometime because I'm an old fart could
be it. But they had like only about a four was it a four seven and men? I forgot. And
Lingson stinks in jinx and Texan next to the five one I think I'm saying to beat him out.
That was with stern off the air right. So you can imagine once he comes back on the
year on Monday how many listeners they're going to have. Wow they got no problems they've
got that wall of men. And Duff is jealous. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty
on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line at poor child man he'll never be the same. I
predict he'll be like we wouldn't like by about nine thirty on Monday it won't take
even two full days. No don't you think based on what you heard this morning what he was
telling us let's start an office pool. No no seriously and how do they know if there's
going to be a topic that's going to be like off limits and that we don't want to have
on the year because it's going to be licensed threatening. How do they know how long
they're going to be talking on it and what are they what are they going to put on in the
middle of it. Seriously because we're not I'm one thing I'll tell you we don't mind
coming on ten fifteen ten thirty year eleven o'clock but we don't come on before ten
under any circumstance. No no chance of that. WQM hello. WQM hello. Yes. WQM hello.
Yes sir. I watched my mouth out with still have two days you have company offer very
at language that you think they'll be very careful. What do you mean the last few days.
A couple days ago I said something with a D and you like. Well don't say it again.
They can say it on our America but we can't say it around easily broadcasting because
the world works. Well see I don't get it this company they're peeing in their pants
over every word that's ever been intended but they're going to put Howard Stern on the
table. These people are crazy but go ahead. Now let me ask you a question. Are you
good? Don't take this wrong but are you going to take it whatever way I feel I think
it. That's right. Are you going to use him as like I I gauge to see as far as what you
could get away with or you just go. I'm sad. Let him put his. Let me just tell you
this I don't listen to his show. I won't listen anymore his show that I listen to
Moe when I come in the studio in the morning at about the quarter to eight and then
George comes in around eight o'clock and then we start talking so we don't we don't
listen anymore so maybe 15 minutes a day 10-15 minutes. No I'm not interested in that.
I don't care what he gets away whether what he does. I do my show and I understand the
parameters they've made for me and I don't have a I'm not happy about it but I don't have
a compulsive need to go on ear and go way over the line and use the N word and do a lot
about this. I just don't have any need for that. So this show has got nothing to do with
his other than it follows it and we'll be glad to take the big lead in you know.
The ratings the ratings are going to definitely you know.
Writing and going through just a couple of days. I don't listen to Howard Howard's boring
you know the same old thing. Well if you get boring I agree with that but he's got a
gigantic audience and he's going to bring a lot of people to this station. But you
know young young Ron and old you know what this game they're going to disappear now.
Okay listen have a heart in the dumpy so chronic five six seven oh five sixty pound
five sixty on the AT and T in Verizon wireless line. I think these twenty five minute breaks
our excellent. Let's have a lot more of them. Oh. This radio station man is so shameless.
If we could if we if we would let them do forty five minutes of spots an hour they'd
say oh sure great. Just like with the worst team remember that whole business. How come
you got getting stuff so bad well maybe we don't have any show left you got to run
the run about forty minutes of spots an hour plus of course they had D for one. Oh god
and that's how they do it. How do I can't hear this enough. I'm just have to play this
back to back. If the book puts on the bill. I thought that the moment whatever that reunion
thing I thought that was good. Yes that call which one. Ginger not the moment the
more temple in the. That one. I thought that was I thought he had peaked at that point
but that was small potatoes compared to this ice-cold bokeh wherever you are where is
evocationing. I don't know. We don't have time for you to find out anywhere we got to
do a long break. Twenty six after eleven at five sixty seventy Q. A. M. if your hair is
falling out in clumps if you got a big ugly bald spot like bokeh brine Charles off
the area is the best in the business he's been doing it for over thirty five years providing

Howard look what we got here. It's a phone. That's class when they bring you the phone.
Hello. It's great. What do you know what do you say?
Your fire. We don't want you anymore and please just go away.
I guess the gyms are. We can't thank you.
That's not matter. I just got fired. Who will that be all?
Yeah, yes.
Oh, why so? We don't accept hard blocks. Especially one that expired in 1959.

Hey, you want to pay for it? I don't read that.
Well, yeah, would you like a free sunset? No. I'm out of it. I want to buy a paper.
I don't understand. Maybe it's because I don't look good in yellow.
Wait, I got it. I don't know if I'm still with the side.
Yeah, that's it. Just happened to have a market here.
Will, wait for wreckage mission. There. Hello, everybody.
I will wait for wreckage mission.

Hurricane Charlie, watch out. Panic.
Okay. And even though it's going to be a nice day today, since this weather bitch on the CNN tomorrow
going to be another story.

Rea Schreiber.
Jay Leno or Duff Lindsey.
Jay.
Somebody Q.
And hello.
Hey, no, yes, sir.
I thought I would turn down a long time.
Start back or send it.
I'll listen to the last six months, but I've been listening to one of three point one,
which is nothing.
He can barely get that in brown.
And then I was also listening to that.
Be at the station over and for my she can get that sometimes.
And I noticed that the delays about an extra 30 seconds on the beach.
Station over the one.
Yeah, yeah, you have in West Palm.
So if they're going to put that kind of delay on there,
I mean, they're going to be dumping him a lot more.
But they don't have that much.
They're going to run the show.
That's what I'm putting in it.
He makes fart sounds all the time.
Not really.
And if you're going to be curious, he makes fart sounds.
Are you sure not permitted on a beach?
You don't hear that on a beach.
These station in April.
They're going to be dumping nights and suddenly shows on every word.
Listen and go.
Anyway, that's it.
Thanks for the good news, pal.
Yeah, but yeah, fart sounds.
We're not allowed to play fart sounds, but how it's making fart sounds all of it.
We've been playing fart sounds for how many years on this show.
About 30, man.
Until February and March, when the beesleaves cave didn't enjoy started saying,
you can't do this and you can't say that.
And not only that, but if you work for beesleaves, you can't even make a fart sound like in your personal life.
My local species, Fort Royal High School, is the way you am.
Come on, fight for it.
Chak, chak, chak, chak, chak, chak, chak, chak.
I'm a five, been up with chak.
Torval back is up with chak.
I'm a four-wheeled, four-wheeled, four-wheeled, four-wheeled,
in love with chak.
I'm 45 at 560 WQM, only 45 minutes away from that Marlon pregame show.
Oh, I am pumped up and farted off about that.
Or as you've pumped off and farted out.
Careful.
The Washington Post on WMVs says, in days before the Iraq War began,
veteran Washington Post reported Walter Pinkers put together a historic questioning,
whether the Bush administration had proof that Saddam Hussein was signing weapons of mass destruction,
or is that distraction.
But he ran into resistance from the paper's editors and his peace ran only
after an assistant managing editor Bob Woodward, who was researching a book about the drive toward the war,
helped sell the story, Pinkist recalled,
without him it would have had a tough time getting into the paper.
Even so, the article was relegated to page A17.
Page 17, eh?
We did our job, but we didn't do it up, and I blame myself,
mightily, for not pushing harder woodward's in an interview.
We should have warned readers that we had information that the basis for this was
a shakeier than widely believed.
Those are exactly the kinds of statements that should be published on the front page,
not on 17, eh?
As violence continues in post-war Iraq and US forces have yet to discover any WMVs,
some critics say the media, including the Washington Post,
failed the country by not reporting more skeptically on President Bush's lies
or contentions during the run up to the war.
An examination of the paper's coverage interviews with more than a dozen of the editors
and reporters involved shows that the post published a number of pieces
challenging the White House, but rarely on the front page.
Some reporters who were lobbying for greater prominence for stories
that question the administration's evidence complained to senior editors
who in the view of the reporters were unenthusiastic about such pieces.
The result was coverage that despite flashes of groundbreaking reporting
in a hindsight looks strikingly one-sided at times.
One-sided.
Following that, the group's stepping media man.
But don't forget, Team Channel, we got that progressive network now.
Oh yeah, to show you how fair and balanced we are.
I like this little cartoonism into caricature.
The new QM Howard Stern dump monkeys.
Definitely never looked better.
Looks like you got a good tan over there in April's and four Mayors.
You got tan?
What if you got a tan high?
Right.
So 560, 705, 60, pound, 560 on the AT and T.
Let's get at least 100 calls on now before 1230.
Well, this is a good practice though, you know what?
Right.
Kind of like cutting down the show to make room for Howard, make room for the Marlins.
Make room for daddy, you know, anything.
How's Danny Thomas doing still dead?
Still.
What will be the biggest impact of the Howard Stern show on WQAM?
Wait a minute, I didn't give you the weather.
Well, we're not supposed to do the weather because we're not interested in news on this station.
Well, the 211.30 this morning showers until a few thunderstorms are continued to move north
over the coastal waters from my Midwest Palm Beach.
Occasional lightning, just a 30 miles an hour 30.
Not 30 minutes.
And locally heavy seas are possible.
A few of these showers and thunderstorms are moving shore with southern Miami-Dade south of Homestead.
And along the coast from Fort Lauderdale, the Boynton Beach.
Right to today, here's the forecast.
Partly sunny, scattered showers and thunderstorms, highs in the upper 80s.
South winds 10 to 15.
Chance of rain is a 30.
percent.
Tonight, partly cloudy and windy, scattered showers and thunderstorms,
lows in the upper 70s and low to the lower 80s of the coast.
Suddenly winds 10 to 15.
The evening becoming southeast, 20 to 25 after midnight.
Chance of rain about 60 percent.
And Friday, mostly cloudy, very windy.
No more showers and thunderstorms with gusty winds in the afternoon.
Eyes in the upper 80s.
Suddenly winds about 30 miles an hour.
Chance of rain 70 percent on Friday tomorrow.
So that's what it is.
Doesn't sound like the end of the world to me.
I mean, let's hear exactly right in the path of this thing.
Right?
Right.
We're fine.
So, huh?
We'll be fine.
Maybe Defe is going to drive back down to again.
Maybe he wants to go back down to the west coast.
I think after Monday, he'll be ready.
So you can hold the storm off for a couple of days.
Defe will be ready.
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon wireless line.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM.
WDQAM.
WDQAM, hello.
Yeah, you're on the air.
You're on the air.
I'm on the air.
Let me say it again one more time.
Yeah.
I just heard on the radio.
I missed out about the house.
And what was that with the delay?
The delay.
The show that he does on Monday?
Yeah.
You'll be hearing that the day after the circus, okay?
Just a short delay.
5670560, it's kind of like the tapes, you know, the Pope and aliens, stuff like that.
Right.
I mean, how is going to be talking about the election?
The one between doing Truman, of course, but nevertheless it'll be an election.
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
We're going to delay and delay and dump and dump and dump.
I'm telling you right now.
That's it.
I'm going to be hearing a lot of that music in there and filling those gaps with big, big gaps.
I mean, when our operations manager, our dump monkey and charred tells me that the show he listened to yesterday,
there was like 3, 540 minutes about the inward and various forms of the inward and porch that and all this other stuff.
Or was it monkeys, I think?
A lot of those.
Yeah, dump monkeys.
And then that he would have had a dump to speed up that like the last maybe 40 minutes of the show.
How do you do that?
I mean, what are we going to do in the process?
I evidently not a lot of thought has been given to these things by our brilliant management,
who of course upper level management's out of town this week on vacation.
We'd all be a lot better off if he'd stand permanent vacation and Greg's case.
But nevertheless, he's coming back on Monday on his stand and he'll be there for the debut of this, whatever it's going to be.
It'll be a day beauty.
Oh, yeah.
Line nine, everybody's favorite, WQAM.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
This is Brian and Rochester.
Hi, Brian. How you doing?
I'm doing pretty good.
It's a great day in Florida.
I mean, I lived in Bokahol from 91 to 98.
Yeah.
And I just love those hurricanes now.
They couldn't get better.
One coming from each end, you know?
Yeah, one coming from the right, one coming from the left.
Yes. I mean, I would just love to see the Gulf of Mexico meet the Atlantic Ocean.
Someday in my lifetime.
Yes. What a dump that place is.
Yeah.
Yes. I mean, I'm very happy to be back in Rochester, New York.
What a dump.
Yes. I mean, I'll take the Brighton Jews over the Bokah Jews any day.
Okay. Good luck to you, Palli.
Hey, thanks, Neil.
See you, Brian.
It's the, you know, about the West Coast rappers and East Coast rappers.
Well, we're going to have our own battle between the Brighton Jews and the Bokah Jews.
Oh!
I mean, like that.
Each year, a hard outer, your, uh, uh, uh, Kishky, whatever.
It's enough to tear my Kishky's up.
They don't have Kishky at my favorite deli here in town.
They might be pretty fioed about that.
It must be a little bit fioed.
It'll tear your Kishky's up, but it's great.
Even the Goyam like Kishky.
That's great.
Five six, no.
Five six seven, oh five sixty, pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Island.
We apologize for the long grace today.
No.
But we have to get a lot of spots in because we need to make some money so we can put
how it's turned on the year.
And we can pay clearance.
It wouldn't play Duffer.
The extra money is going to be getting for being the, uh, port, I mean, the, uh, dump, uh, button monkey.
So many monkeys around in so little time.
WQAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Well, great.
Listen, I waited to call you so you got back.
I read the first column.
I believe it was very Jackson Road of a Howard Sturry.
Very Jackass, yes.
Yeah.
And I saw.
I kind of took issue with the fact that, uh, this year management would allow, would like,
and I took out an insult to you that they say that they don't care how long the Howard
Sturry goes over your time slot.
Right.
And, and they don't care if it takes more than they'll keep him on.
Right.
After you've been the number one, I mean, I, uh, the staple of that station.
Oh, they don't care about me.
I'm old man.
I'm small potatoes, you know, they can do whatever they want with me.
And they, they, they think that this is, they got the big enchilada now, man.
They think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread and they're going to run with it.
And the rest of us can just, uh, goose depa law.
And as long as the money stays the same, I will.
Well, I know you, I know you don't care, but I have a, I have a question.
In your opinion, doesn't the risk of having a experience diluted show because they're going
to have to take a lot of that out?
Uh, isn't it too much of a risk, especially after the rating you guys got on the, on the
station, the last one?
Too much of a risk.
Time will tell how to have a vinyl.
I don't know.
Wow.
Well, it's shocking.
It's shocking to me.
I can't believe that they're putting a show on, especially at a time when they, they always
do the thing that seems to make the least sense.
When the, when the crap restarted coming down about, uh, kiss a, uh, good morning and, uh,
the other stuff we were playing and we getting a lot of heat about the stuff on the station,
then they put for real on the air.
You know, with all his stuff.
And then it made no sense.
And I'm thinking to myself, why at this time are they putting him on the air?
They know what he does.
They know he's going to like jeopardize the license and do a lot of all that and never,
you know, pay attention to what they tell him and he didn't and they had a can of
that, you know, and they made them, and now on the heels of that experience and coming
out of time when it's even more chilling than it was before because you had the, uh,
super bowl incident, the breast bearing craft and everybody and their brother is gone into a
cocoon now into a panic mode.
Uh, and now they put a certain on there.
I don't understand it.
Yeah, and it's like a joke.
I used to think you were joking when you said about how incompetent these people are, but I mean,
it's beginning to, they, they're just spreading it out for you know.
These people are mo' runs.
He hates it, he hates it, he hates it.
He hates it, he hates it.
Have a great day, Pat.
All right, all right, all right.
Pray for us, please.
Okay, Robby Rosarimese, everybody pray for those of us at QAM.
Look what happened to the Humper for crying out loud.
I thought something great was going to happen.
That was funny.
We're going to have this great award winning lineup and everything was going to go smoothly and
we're going to like, uh, make millions and millions raking into Bucks at QAM.
And everything was going to be just fine, you know, like, uh,
Oh, we're fine.
I can't store what say if she could.
But the fact of the matter is it looks like once again Greg Reed just keeps
Diddlin and Diddlin and Diddlin hasn't got any idea what is going on,
what the repercussions are.
And I sure hope he's got the normed Kent's number real handy.
Write it on your sleeve, Greg, as a momentum of our association.
Speed down.
Yeah.
Let him fit the five at five sixty WQM.
I've been telling you about Alayzer Recharge, the toner and recharge cartridge
specialist the past few weeks here on the show.
A lot of you have called 1-800-287.
Now you two twelve you've saved a lot of money and you're printing an office
equipment supplies.
And for those of you who haven't called, I can't imagine what you're waiting for.
Because Alayzer Recharge has got all the things you're looking for, ink jets,
thermocarboned paper, supplies that provide service support and maintenance for most
Mason models of machines to make them run like brand new again.
In fact, you could probably use some help right there on that fax machine that I paid for.
Oh, help me Jesus.
When you call 1-800-287-9212, you'll deal with just Bob, the sole owner,
who's been supplying businesses in South Florida with what they need.
In most cases within 24 hours for a long time.
Alayzer Recharge can save you up to 50% on new cartridges as compared to depot pressing
and don't forget, all the cartridges sold by Alayzer Recharge are remanufactured,
not refilled.
Anybody in their brother can sell you cheap refilled piece of crap cartridge, but keep in mind
you only get what you pay for.
Remanufactured cartridges are the only smart way to go.
And Alayzer carries a complete line of cartridges for printers,
copiers and faxes along with brother and Xerox drums too.
Alayzer Recharge is probably the individualized service, offers a no questions
act satisfaction guarantee.
So if you need toner, cartridges or anything else in this line, pick up that phone
and call it just Bob.
At Alayzer Recharge, it's a tool free call called 1-800-287-9212.
That's 1-800-287-9212 or log on to their website, alayzerrecharge.com.
My name is local, this is my city.
The rate is all yours.
Kill me!
This is at a Homeland Security Tom Ridge, advising you to put duct tape on your radio
when I raise the warning color to pink for the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.
Ricky Williams said goodbye to football.
Oh Ricky, I can't do this.
I want to stroke your legs when slip your track with my greasy nose.
But you rather slow-faced flip, now I'm pulling up my fly for the season.
Gash my heart to bed, reflex, here's well up in my eyes.
Oh no, a pair of breezes, and I might bustle by the bridge.
There's a way, see, in my trailer, and then I find you no longer here.
You've got to get my life set of failure, and over the hearts of all the sports players,
on a woman's face as well, now you're building junk.
It's your chose I want in my mouth, on the half of a few stars.
Bad two likes for whole radio.
You leave those like me.
And only the Shats funds we can see.
It's promo 2 at 5.60 WQM, we're just warming it up for the Marlon Pregame show.
Look at that window there, how's it look?
Oh, beautiful here.
Sunny and vial is what it looks like here.
You'll have a few showers here and there pop up a spotty, curinere,
that's it, don't panic, okay?
Or is it a good time to start panicking?
Or just getting the cry driver over to Naples for a Myers right now,
be there just in time for the good stuff.
What will be the biggest impact of Howard Stern on WQM?
That's our pullquestmealranges.com today.
482 votes.
He'll send the ratings way up, zooming up there to astronomical heights,
even with all those dumps and delays and crap like that.
Too bad.
35.28% 173.
I don't give a crap about Stern 108.
He'll screw up Neil show 66.
He'll bring tons of people back to AM radio 46.
He'll drive away tons of sports nerds 38.
He'll increase the crank calls big time 21.
Dufflin's you'll have another nervous breakdown 17,
not much impact only 13.
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon world of slime.
Norma can't stop emailing me, okay, you're getting on my nerves now,
stop bugging me.
And the same with my financial guy who's driving me absolutely crazy.
Well, we tried to send you something airborne expressed yesterday.
See, I live in a building where all the stuff goes to the concierge.
I don't think people will come knocking on my door.
Oh, here's FedEx, we have delivery for it.
It doesn't work that way in an apartment building, you know?
It doesn't? No.
And I'm getting all during the show.
This goes down to like on a daily basis.
Once I walk out of this room at about 1230-03,
I'm going to get on the phone and raise some holy hell.
Just for the hell of it, I'm just tired of crap.
It's hard to people doing stupid things, you know what I mean?
You mean holy hell.
You mean holy hell, don't you?
Holy crap.
Speaking of crap, Pentagon auditors have concluded that
Haliburton failed radically account for more than $1.8 billion
worth of work in Iraq and Kuwait.
The Wall Street Journal says, setting a Pentagon report.
This amount represents 43% of the $4.18 billion
that Houston-based Haliburton, Kellogg Brown, and Root,
has billed the Pentagon to feed the House troops in the region
the newspaper said.
It said the findings in the 60-page Pentagon audited
reported August 4th, but not publicly released,
they're likely to increase pressure on the U.S. government
to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of payments to Haliburton.
This, it said, potentially threatens the services that Kellogg Brown
and Root provides U.S. troops and other personnel in Iraq and Kuwait.
Vice President Dick Taney, as some of you may remember,
was Haliburton's Chief Executive from 1995 to 2000.
Another cook, we won't business with a bunch of crooks,
and America says, oh yeah, 50% of us, we never met a cook, we didn't like.
Got all mighty.
How is it possible that there are so many stupid people?
And this porter, Misha Goss, from Florida, who's supposed to be now
the new director of the CIA or at least he's Bush's appointee.
Michael Moore's got the footage where he had told him an interview just
earlier this year.
He's not qualified to be in the CIA much less its director,
and he gave him chapter in verse, I can't wait.
I wonder how long before the media starts showing us that clip.
How do you think we're going to see that?
Oh, over the book.
Hold your breath right now.
Oh, look at the breath.
Take it.
I just write 670560, pound 560 on a 18 and T in Verizon line.
WDQA and hello.
Yeah, the biggest impact with Howard Stern will be Barbara Bowie,
we've placed in Georgia.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, there we go.
There's one of those cars.
Just like I said, got one IQ smaller than his penis.
567560, pound 560 on a 18 and T.
In fact, that's what most Stern people, that's about it, isn't it?
Bob Bowie?
Bob Bowie, sure.
And you?
Bob Bowie, it's a medley of their material.
And Howard Stern rules.
And Bob Bowie, that's pretty much it.
I'm not saying that there are some real intelligence people listening.
How many of you think?
530, man.
How many QA and hello?
Hey, Neil, how are you?
Yes, sir.
Great.
I was wondering, you played George Pevieler Day
an excerpt from a Bush speech where he's now.
He just did a big bon hit and people are laughing in the background.
Yeah.
I heard it's a part of it and it was incredible.
You can see the video on NeilRodges.com.
Yeah, you can see the video and I'll play it again for you right now,
since that's what you're looking for.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
I looked last night.
It wasn't on there, but I'll check it out.
It's on there right now, as we speak.
It can make this stuff up.
Exactly.
It's unbelievable.
I think it's exactly what Kelly see.
Thank you.
What do you think tribal sovereignty means in the 21st century?
And how do we resolve conflicts between tribes and the federal and state governments?
Travel sovereignty means that.
It's sovereign.
You're a...
You've been given sovereignty and your...
You, there's a sovereign entity.
Okay.
And therefore the relationship between the federal government and tribes is one between sovereign entities.
Right.
And it's almost as good as...
Abougarrabe.
And almost as good as the one about...
What was the...
Here, I've got it here somewhere.
Pull me once.
Our enemies...
No, not to pull me...
I can't get pulled again.
Our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we.
They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we.
Yeah.
How didn't this...
Oh my God.
Well, I got a story on our website by Mark Morpher.
It's way too long.
I'm not going to read it.
How do you know what's time for major change in American leadership?
Let us count the signs.
He says, I just read the first paragraph or so.
He said, you know what's time for a serious change when the president of the West actually mutters the infantile, instantly infamous line.
Our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we.
They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we.
Just after finishing phonetically spelling out his name and his favorite his red crayon, I'm yet another budget-reaming 417 billion dollar offense-spending bill.
And you know it's time for a change when not a single one of the original and spiritually curdled military yesmen standing around the ceremonial signing table.
Those sad automatons with their wooden smiles and stiff spines and bone-dry souls, not one broken away hysterical, but a sad suicidal after, followed by an uncontrolled wailing and the ranting of flesh and muttering of oh my freaking God.
What the hell is this man doing is leader of the free world.
The whole story is on our website by Mark Morford.
How time to get out the bush.
A-Linus Pass known in 560 WQM when you're-
The shini is real pissed.
He's daughter-don't-lack-guys.
Where she stands no one knows her party's between the fire.
Here's what she denies is.
The GOP has her needs.
First has the gay amendments.
Come out from the closet deep.
We should see her the sun and the other left beyond.
Where she is one.
He's gonna see my dashies.
God's rattled her way.
And some you put she hair on thin yarn.
Deep, we should see her the sun and not a daughter who is a lesbian.
Well, 15 at 560, 15 minutes away from the Marlon pregame.
Show Cardinals at the state of the plate of Marlon's.
Craig and Mimey, if you send me any more of his fancy George,
it's gonna be-
I just wanted you to feel my pain.
Why do this?
Craig and Mimey get a life.
I need you pathetic tragic soul you.
What's certain coming in?
I guess QM has balls after all.
Oh man, get a freaking life.
Look at the Milky Balls.
Yeah, no brains just balls.
And don't actually lean too happy about it over there at UN.
How many of that guy to call it on Tuesday?
How many UN guys on Death Road?
They say-
560, 560, 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.
Wireless line.
Let's get these 85,000 calls going here before 1230.
What do you say?
Let's go.
At least WNQA and H.
Hey, now.
Yes, sir.
Just to tell you-
He's on by the way.
All right.
Just to tell you, the buzz doesn't cut nothing out of Howard's show.
How do you know?
Well, I've been listening to it for the last two weeks.
You can pick it up like in Coral Springs when I'm driving around.
Right.
You're right.
Yesterday for a half an hour.
That's all they were saying.
And they get-
Here we go.
Yeah, the end of the show.
You had to carry the whole thing.
I mean, it was Gilbert Gottfried and that guy already been-
Right.
...for the end work, the whole end-
The whole end-
So I make a period there.
Well, I guarantee you won't hear that on this station.
Yeah, so I don't know what to-
See, you see, I'm glad that we brought this up today because what this points out is that-
This company wants to put the show on this radio station, but they don't want to carry it.
You see what I'm saying?
They want their ratings.
They want their revenue.
They want to be big shots, but they don't want to take the risk.
We'd like you wanted to go to Amsterdam, but you don't want to get on the plane.
Right.
I just- I don't understand it.
Maybe somebody can explain it to me.
Can you explain it?
Sure.
If we say that we have Howard on, even if we don't carry any of the show,
Right.
Almost as good.
And then we can run all those promos and we can-
Okay.
And the sales department, Carwapher,
Because they're used to line a lot anyway.
And they'll make up a bunch of crap.
Oh, we got the Howard Stern show.
We can say Howard Howard Howard, but really-
All we play is the chicken-loat-
...cocksing.
...cocksing.
...cocksing.
...cocksing.
Because we're too chicken-trip to a charity show.
See, I- I think this was a very, very fortuitous experience that happened with Mufflinzi
and Robert Greeper, where we had her Naples for a Myers last couple of days.
Because we're discovering that there's an awful lot of stuff on there
that they don't want to put on here, which leads to the question,
what do they put on here in Fort Myers?
They're carrying it over there.
They have been carrying it for a long time.
What the hell?
Because they're not going to be any different.
In other words, whatever the standards are, they've decided over there.
The Beasley standards, the Beasley-
...knows-ticking Van Joost-Rumming standards, it's going to be exactly the same on QAM.
And maybe even worse, Richard, because though all that Mufflinzi is about as nervous and Ellie as you can get,
about as Ellie as they come, I mean, what do you expect?
It's going to be even worse.
Because he admitted to me that none of that 40 minutes would have been on the air.
Now, how do you feel 40 minutes?
Huh?
There you go.
Excuse us, we're having technical difficulties.
Would I always turn people to me or will be resuming with a show?
It's as if the upper copy gets lost and they don't keep saying the end word anymore.
Right, we also have this.
Yeah, that's good.
Oh, man.
I really believe that we're going to have as many people tuning in the Hearstord on Monday as people tuning in to hear what's going to be going on.
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, the alternative show.
Holy moly.
In other words, what is really going to get on the air and is Howard really saying anything?
Are we really carrying the Howard'sord and sure?
Are we just pretending that we're carrying the Stern Show?
WDQ and hello.
Hey, yes?
Yes, I am.
Oh, hey, I don't know if you've got to talk about this.
I want to talk about something that's really been bothering me about what they're doing with Bush campaign is doing with the sound by John Kerry.
When he was asked that a journalist convention about what he would have done, what he has sat there in that Kindergarten room.
And when kept reading, I thought that clip.
Yeah, you saw the clip.
You saw the clip of Kerry's answer, right?
Right.
But you did see the clip of the question.
No.
Everybody keeps on playing it, so Kerry was saying it in a speech.
You know, I wouldn't have done that.
And the media is doing that.
I mean, it's deliberately creating an issue with it really was not.
He did that indirectly after for questions.
Right.
I wanted to make that known in some public forum because I think most people, as just as you, had only seen that clip.
And they did not see the, you know, the whole thing that we were...
Well, let me remind you and everybody of one thing.
The media is sick and they drop the average.
Yeah, all the stuff that's gone down, just like that story I had about to watch them post.
Now, finally admitting that they were, they were bearing the stories about the WMDs and the excuses for going into a wreck.
The media verse about 80% of the responsibility, the way I've been seen it.
I've been seeing that the same way.
And, you know, I think we need a lot more response, more reporting.
And it's very hard to not find bias.
I mean, one side or the other.
Any way, there's no need to go reporting anymore.
Well, you have to go on the internet. That's all I can tell you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And Neil, I miss you when you're not here. I wish you were there more.
I'm not real excited about Howard. I mean, he's not bad.
But are you going to be on still from 10 to 2?
From whenever he gets done till 2.
From... and that's it?
Oh, God. What are we going to do without you, man?
From 10, 30 or 10, 40. I mean, it's not like the end of the world.
I mean, you can get by with them and take another snooze or something.
I'll see you next time.
I've told you on several occasions you make my life bearable.
Have a great day, sweetheart.
Take care. Bye-bye.
Yeah. From 21 to QAM.
And I am lost.
Because it's 4.20 o'clock 6.
QAM.
All right.
If you're all the lady, now you're not a useless lady.
Do the neophons and gobbels and control your friends.
Don't you have the fantasy now?
Nothing's right to be so bad.
Take care.
And get by the song in the back.
You can appreciate anyone.
Well, you can't say that.
And you're not very ugly in all the questions.
And what you say on the air will be considered ugly.
No one's to present it now.
And your hands are on the floor.
The head's like the body comes back from my back.
You give up in killing one.
Girls, you can't say that.
Get a naked scream.
With reference to the Lord of stars,
hold it at your feet.
We'll find you a very, very natural life is a way for all.
And you can't say that.
Well, I like that.
That one's beautiful.
That's the lovely thing.
