Here's the O.M. D.A.L.I. as you see, A.M.
On the next tipwood, David Milch's Burn of the Old West.
When Cowboys were smelly and used 500 cursewoods for seconds,
there's a new gunslinger in town to avenge the death of his friend, while Bill Lee...
Look, you do a f***ing Bucky's Park stranger.
Yeah, who did? For you.
I'm Buffalo Bearer. Mommy.
He's saying that!
Ted Blivby is Buffalo Bill.
You sure are fast on a f***ing draw.
I wouldn't be fast if I didn't put the lotion in a holster.
I'm a f***ing Bucky's stranger.
I've been through the terror for my nose-girding stroke.
That's about as close as we think after promoting the dialogue of a deadwood only on 8th.
The O.M.
10.156.00 W.D.Q.I.M. Happy Monday to you.
Two more dead soldiers in Baghdad just in the moments ago.
I can't even keep track anymore.
Although we don't have any names or any identities or any other stuff like Pat Tillman that CNN was hyperventilating about all weekend long.
I mean, just nauseam.
So I guess they must not be important people, right?
Of course not.
Whoever heard of them.
Exactly.
Anyway, here's the result of the poll.
Before we do that, guess who died?
That's the latter.
Besides American soldiers.
SD Lotter, very good.
She was 97.
Do we care about her?
No.
No.
Over a decade she built a multi-million dollar cosmetics empire with thousands of employees.
She died at 97.
That's plenty old enough.
I mean, are we supposed to be upset about that?
We think she was 97.
She never really told anybody.
Really?
Yeah.
How do we know that?
Do we just make up a number?
It looks like 97.
But before we were able to talk about the long-o bit that I saw over the weekend.
Yeah.
We're pretty sure it was 97, but no one really knows.
Anyway, the worst top 40 hit song of all time that was our poll on over the weekend.
And amazingly, after trailing, look at this final total here.
Wow.
It was neck and neck between two songs, Macarena.
And of course, Neil, you went out over the weekend and bought these records, didn't you?
No.
No.
Well, I'm sure that they expect me to be doing that because, well, I mean, if you're going to talk about these things, we want the...
There you go.
That's what you need to know that.
Yeah.
And Aiki Brickyhart.
The best part, neck and neck, nose to nose, Macarena etched it out.
Lois del Rio.
244.
Aiki Brickyhart.
Vilires Cyrus.
242 genetically challenged.
Another nose-picking country Yahoo.
244 to 242.
Heavy duty.
Nobody else even close to those two.
Feelings, though, by Morris Albert the cat 91.
I'm so proud of that.
That was good.
Good choice.
This go duck 87 also, Debbie Boone.
You like my life 87.
Speaking of Debbie Boone and the Boone family, boy, we got something exciting for you on our website today.
Coming back after 18 years in limbo is the Boone in the box.
I was so excited when I found it again.
I'll just aboutpeed my pants.
No, not for that reason.
86, Hustler Magazine, the anxious Larry Flint, found an old college photo of Pat Boone,
sticking his penis through a cardboard box.
Kids in college, they do wild and crazy things.
All of us never did stick our penis through a box.
But anyway, a cardboard box.
Just careful now.
Just be careful.
Don't discuss it's Monday.
Don't start using no excuses that you forgot about this.
Forget about that.
Anyway.
I don't want to upset it.
So we made a whole bunch of copies of that from Hustler Magazine.
And we sent out hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of copies.
Of course, that was in glorious, I guess, was black and white.
I don't know.
Maybe somebody still got one of those.
Blackers item, maybe we can sell them on eBay.
And so there's an article on the drudgery tort.
Not the drudgery port occurs because Miss Fudge,
although I'm sure Miss Fudge right now is frantically checking our website for that story.
See a Pat Boone with his penis sticking through a cardboard box.
I just mentioned it.
It's called the Boone in the box.
And then Hustler Magazine got wind of it and they got all bent out of shape.
And they said, I don't send any of those out again.
And for whatever reason.
Anyway, so Debbie Boone, you light up my life with or without your penis sticking through a cardboard box.
And this go duck 87, who let the dogs out, tiptoe through the tulips time with 72.
Have a my baby.
And don't worry.
Be happy 58.
Ice Ice Baby 46, Ebony and Ivey 37.

See that was number one in the, what was it?
The blender, maximum blender pull.
See.
The way down the list of ours.

Hmm.

What are you giggling about?
Nothing.
Still back on the Boone in the box, huh?
We are the world 16.
Turned between two lovers 16.
These boots are made for walking.
Ancestanatra 16.
Wait me up before you go, go.
Now that should handle a lot more votes.
They are WAM.
As Ancestan is disgusting as he is an individual George Michael.
Right.
When he was with that other screamer, I mean WAM was just the worst.
The alter.
Yeah.
Wait me up before you go, go.
Oh, brother.
Rico Swabe, MacArthur Park and Margaritaville.
And they're coming to take me away all head 14.
And after that, who cares, right?
Right.
So there's the worst songs of all time according to our astute audience.
Some of whom are left in town.
It's amazing to me.
What is the date?
It's the 26th of April.
And about 30%.
I would say about 30, man.
Of South Florida, at least, is just vanished already.
The snowbirds are gone.
Everybody's going on vacation.
They're just bailing out waiting for that first 97 degree in the shade day.
Four school children were killed by gunfire and bagged out yesterday.
Shortly after roadside bomb trip,
worked through a US military vehicle.
Some of us have said that children aged around 12 were shot dead by US troops who had opened fire randomly
after the blast on Canal Street in eastern bagged at least five of the people were wounded.
I just mentioned that in passing.
More of the ravages of war.
We got bigger fish to fry.
We got a very important fact here to start off our morning.
A typical South Florida facts.
When you say this is very typical, very typical.
Yes.
Let's start out your week with a real...
Stuh!
Yeah, let's stick it our foot deep inside your...
Let's go.
See how hard we can twist it.
And of course we're wearing pointed shoes.
With spurs.
Here's the fact sent this morning from J.J. in Pemberk Pines with a PO address.
I can see what I wouldn't want to put the real address.
Dear Neil, I'm writing to ask you to explain what the hell happened to the Neo-Rodger show
because if you think you're even close to what you were not all that long ago,
you not be speaking the same language.
Understandably so, we cannot agree all of the time.
But that was once what made your show great, the fact that you pissed me off 50% of the time.
All you do now is bash, bush, and run pulls on topics that are...
So inconsequential, there's no entertainment value whatsoever.
Recently I heard a caller ask you that when he goes to your website to vote and doesn't see a choice he liked,
he asked you to include a vote for not interested.
You blew him off, period.
Are you just marking time?
I mean, getting a paycheck is one thing, but earning it is another.
Have you ever seen a poll where they...
Because every website now has got polls.
Have you ever in your life seen a poll where it had a choice not interested in this?
Only in South Florida where they're so negative where they want a choice.
Oh, we don't like this poll. We're not interested.
If you're not interested, don't vote on it, Schmuck.
Anyway, it says, you can dissect this all you want.
You can be rate my thoughts all you want.
However, the fact remains, you know it.
I know it. Many listeners out there know it too.
They're all alternative, 610, 850 on the AM dial,
popping up out there in your time slot.
Now they do compete.
Yeah, 850, they got like a point to 001.
They don't even show up.
And 610, if you want to hear all right, we will.
They'd be my guest. Have a good time.
In the past there was only you.
It is a new day. Many years back I went into you in a duff on Pines Boulevard.
I wonder if they were coming their food.
All the food was soft and mushy for people who had their teeth in the glass.
I ran into you in a duff in Pines Boulevard when it was just about the only business out there.
I just wanted to say hello.
You were eating alone. I imagine you were on your way to work.
You were very gracious. And not the radio needle I appreciated then.
Just as I do now.
Give me back the real needle.
Sincerely, JJ would last name probably Phony in Pember Pines.
Or at least the first name is Phony.
I do like that to start off the week.
Typical, like you said.
Now if there are all these other great choices out there, JJ,
I just for the life of me can't imagine why you haven't chosen one yet.
Why you'd rather inflict upon me, especially since I was so nice to you
while you were coming your food out there at Duff's in Pember Pines.
I can't imagine why you'd want to inflict to start off my week of sour, nasty,
stoch in the back.
Because there ain't nothing wrong with his show.
Within the parameters of what we, of course, we can't do that.
We can't say that anymore.
But I think under the circumstances we're still doing swimmingly well, okay?
Oh, man.
The one thing I always have loved is people who have threatened to turn off the show.
We don't like what you're doing. It's not tailored to me.
I don't care about your stupid and constant wedges of poles.
It's not anywhere near what it used to be.
So there are other choices.
Well, there are so many great choices.
Why could you possibly?
I mean, look at the length of this thing.
Mm-hmm. Oh, I know.
What kind of person, seriously?
I have no life.
Would take the time, other than a South Floridian, of course.
What other kind of person would take the time to spew with such crap here?
It's just amazing to me.
In fact, probably this is the person who called and suggested that we put the not interested on the pole, you think?
Right.
They're very vehement about their apathy.
I see.
But how come you're not listening to all those other alternatives, like 850 on the dial from Palm Beach County,
which has got to have at least when the book comes out Thursday is a .002 maybe, they're moving on up.
And you got your, what's the guy that they put on in the morning now that schmuck?
That hoop was on IOD.
The right wing from Tampa, another one.
I don't know.
I don't even know what his name is. He's so famous.
And you got your rush and you got the billow Riley and you got all these other great choices.
How could you possibly be subjecting yourself to this, especially since I was so nice?
You can just do and put up with your crap and dust a hundred years ago where people were coming all that soft food.
Or anybody know he's going to change it.
I figure you're part of any minute now. He'll change his station.
Right. Now now he's heard me react and dissected and get all bent out of shape, which quite frankly I don't give a fly in.
How do you like that, JJ?
I do the best I can in my own humble way.
And that's it.
Nobody here is faking their way through.
If we wanted to think our way through, we could display music every day.
They couldn't do anything about that.
Nothing says we got to sit here and put up with a bunch of cranky clowns, cranky antholes.
Here's today's poll, which really out of frost or ants.
By the way, Pat Dillman died in Afghanistan.
Who's that?
Some football player.
Again, I don't want to diminish the fact that he made a sacrifice on all of this other.
But I mean, how come he's so much more important than everybody else who's dying over there?
We don't even get most of the names.
I see that must be it.
No, the word you're looking for is celebrity.
He was famous.
He was well known as opposed to all these other anonymous mucks who also see there's no draft right now.
And they're right now.
So all the people who are in the military putting their lives on the line, they volunteered.
They weren't probably expecting to go over there and be there quite so long.
But nevertheless, they volunteered.
Nobody held a gun to their head.
They're all volunteer military.
All right.
So you should be kissing all of their ass.
I'm getting the G.A. veil.
And this is the sick obsession with celebrity in America and the rest of the world too.
It's just pathetic.
Traffic is if somehow his life and his sacrifice was so much more significant than some puts from down the street named Tom Smith or whatever's name might have been.
Catarina Vitt.
There she is.
Figure skater.
I mean, I look for the bio one here and I'm not going to go through.
I spent eight minutes trying to find a biography on Catarina Vitt just to find out how old she is.
And I can't find it.
Vitt or without.
So there she is.
Vitt out close.
Catarina Vitt behind a beaded curtain.
So if you're over the age of 400 and you've got several pieces of ID, we would like to do a let you take a quick peek.
That's it. That's long enough.
The worst TV show of all time is see another inconsequential poll.
Now, I know it's Georgia's fault and Neal's fault.
Both of our fault.
The South Florida audience only re-response to this show and any show whether or not talking about either light bulb radio or sports with lists.
They like that.
They like having a list and we don't want 10.
We don't want to.
I got a couple for you.
No, you don't have a couple.
You have one.
Okay.
We're going to start based on that facts that you sent me that I just read.
I'm going to start being a real real.
Hard.
Huh?
A hard.
Prince.
At least the first four letters are right.
Three letters.
I don't even know.
Can we say that?
Prince?
No, prick.
No, that was not on the list.
No, it wasn't.
That was not on the list.
I'm going to start being a real prick.
How do you like that?
10, 13.
What do you mean starting?
You've always been a-
Okay.
At 5, 60, W, 2, 8.
I just-
I felt like a-
A stick.
Think about it.
For a virtual company that's succeed without any storefront locations means beating the competition on every dimension.

My life and local, this is 4-Tradio by City.
Way to way, yeah.
Only in the Banana Republic, baby. Only in Miami.
Announcing the show you've been waiting for, America.
It's Tonya Hiding's Ice Cafe.
Here's Olympic gold medalist, Katarina Vick.
Yes, skating to the classics.
Oh, nice split jump there.
Here comes her take off into a double lap.
Oh, she's down.
She's a magazine.
Now it's Brian Botano attempting a triple-sauce.
Oh, you were.
We got crazy.
A perfectly executed triple-gen assault by Tonya Hiding.
She's the precision team of Tonya Hiding, Jeff Gullily,
and her fat guy bodyguard wipe out skater after skater.
Oh, now Kristy, I'm a Gucci, Dalmatris.
It's fun for the whole family, especially if you're the Corleone Gari family.
Order your tickets for Tonya Hiding's Ice Cafe.
Steve Van Gulkross accepted.
That's our only bit with Katarina Vick and, uh, timely, right?
What?
What's not to like?
Speaking of timely, speaking of Duff's restaurant,
where all the food tasted the same, where you could gum it,
the macaroni and cheese tasted like the roast beef,
and the spaghetti tasted just like the mashed taters,
I'm serious about that.
It was the only place we ever had the mashed potatoes in a glass.
A couple on a low carb diet were kicked out of a buffet restaurant
after the manager said they'd eaten too much roast beef.
I heard that story.
This is in Salt Lake City, yeah, but I had an oral godfather,
and he ate no band leader.
Sweet, a mama.
I think it was the guy's name.
Sweet, a mama.
You can get fined for that.
Well, along with his wife, I've been on the Atkins diet for two weeks.
Was asked to leave after he went up to the buffet at the Chakorama,
and suburban Taylor's Voodoo to offer his 12 slice of roast beef.
And they said, Yamama.
It's so embarrassing, actually.
He said, Isabella Yoda, a mama's wife.
I don't understand.
There just seem to be more and more people now who don't have the same last name with their wife.
Right?
We went in the have dinner.
We were under the impression Chakorama was an all-you-can-eat establishment.
Not so said, Jack Johansson, the restaurant chain's district manager.
We never claimed to be an all-you-can-eat establishment.
He said, our understanding is a buffet is just a style of eating.
The general manager was carving the meat to's.
They became concerned about having enough for other patrons and asked,
a mama to stop Johansson, said, offended the couple asses or refund.
The manager refused to call police when they wouldn't leave.
The couple said they've eaten at Chakorama's 899 buffet,
at least twice a week, but did not plan to return.
It's kind of like that J.J. and Pemberg Pines won't be returning to the near Roger show
because it just ain't the same and who am I kidding, etc. and so on.
Right?
Right.
In fact, take a look right now at that phone.
We're doing a poll.
The worst TV show of all time.
Now we don't have any to start.
I didn't want to play that game.
We got one by Fax.
I told Josh about it already and then I added one.
Okay.
The Fax is a suggested survivor.
And I added Dr. Phil.
Oh, okay.
Well, at least it's current.
I mean, this is of all time,
but there is a lot of swill on right now.
And you can't say swill without Dr. Phil.
560560.
Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Howard Stern, gigantic ratings in New York and Los Angeles,
getting millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars of free publicity
from all those detractor out there.
Our ratings come out on Thursday.
It's going to be real interesting to see.
Not so much what we do, what the Clear Channel doesn't do,
and especially WBGG, Man, O Man.
$4,000 FCC, fine, from I'm a stichin' a crank called Castro.
The radio station at crank called Cuban President Fidel Castro
and broadcasted recordings should be fine.
4 grand the FCC said they're finding everybody.
They keep saying,
Oh, we're fine.
The Spanish speaking host of the morning of high jinks
used snippets of an earlier prank involving
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to move the call from receptionist
up the chain to Castro in a five minute broadcast June 17.
The host of the show on WXDJ, Joe Ferero, and Enrique Santos
fed pleasant feast of Castro before breaking in and calling him an assassin.
The conversation ended after Castro denounced the colors
with the stream of vulgarities.
The FCC concluded Friday that the stations had to be fine for the broadcast.
It rejected the station's plan that a rule requiring people be notified
before their voices are used as not applied to people in Cuba.
Oh, what a cover response that is.
Sure, sure.
The aim of the fine to request the cancellation of the reduction
of the fine required within 30 days.
It was unclear whether the station had been defined for the prank involving Chavez
five months earlier.
There's fine in everybody's insight.
In fact, in a 64-page filing with the FCC,
Infinity Broadcasting claimed that the commission
is abruptly and systematically altered almost every aspect of the indecency
enforcement in ways that dramatically undermine the loveliness of the overall scheme.
And they are absolutely correct.
Yes.
Last month, the FCC announced it would find infinity for references to
sexual and extratory activities in hour when children may have been listening.
If the FCC proceeds with it, proceeds with it's fine,
infinity can appeal to a higher authority,
to a federal court for Hebrew National.
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Maybe we'll get a call from JJ today, you think?
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.
Can I have a quick address?
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.
Yeah, good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I have one for your call.
That Rick Sanchez show.
No, no.
The Rick Sanchez show is a great choice.
OK, I'll do very well in South Florida.
Good thing I didn't vote yet.
Yeah.
I saw about three minutes of that one day and it just made me want to cry.
I brought a tear to my eye.
It was absolutely unbelievable.
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Nobody, not there.
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.
Q-A-M.
Good morning, Pally.
Hi, Pally.
How you doing?
All right, this one's really easy for me.
I'm going to say, hours, that show is on forever.
Nothing is funny.
All the characters, soft if you can still say that.
All the characters, OK.
Yes, sir.
OK, thank you.
Thank you.
Say hi to Alice.
OK, Alice, rantell.
5.670, we can't change the pull anytime Eric is ready.
He can take this other because he didn't have to do anything at all.
See what I mean?
Then you can add new ones on there.
Josh.
OK.
But I think for that to happen, he has to change the pull.
We don't really want to, uh, since, especially since we started on Thursday
and I might start pushing the Eric over the edge since he's so close already.
5.670, 5.60, pound, 5.60 on a AT&T.
But then again, what else is new?
W-A-Q-A-M, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, how about he, huh?
He has perfect.
Good one.
This is going to be a long list.
Maybe we ought to do this till Thursday.
Just aggravate JJ in Pemberg Fives, who still tried to gum that boot at DUS.
First of all, what kind of an ad hole would be eaten at DUS?
Well, you were there.
Yeah, that's right.
Like I said, at least I admit it.
Almost close by my work.
I was on a way to W-I-N-Z, where we originated the old boon in the box.
I can't believe I found that again.
Did you take a peek at it?
Oh, yeah.
You peeked at it.
Well, see, first of all, you got to click on the link to the original story.
So I'm always going to come up on that by-
Thank you, Hally.
Thank you, Hally.
Bye, action.
Thanks, Hally, for that stuff in the box.
WNQ-WAM, hello, clear box.
Hey, this is Jimmy.
This is Jimmy Johnson, JJ.
How you doing?
Okay.
How about you?
How's it going, JJ?
Pretty good.
My vote is for...
Nice haircut, by the way.
Oh, thank you.
My vote for He-Ha and Buck Rogers, that's two.
Okay, that's two.
Well, somebody else said He-Ha.
So Buck Rogers is the worst TV show I hate.
Whatever he says.
How about Neil Rogers on Whammy?
That was pretty bad.
We'll just call you Buck for sure.
And the good thing is we can still say...
Whammy!
God, it sucks.
Absolutely.
Yeah, we can still say that.
How loud.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T horizon wireless line.
Man, how they might of fall in God.
Remember those great days when the show used to be good?
No.
Why can't I remember that far back?
Somebody QA him, hello?
QA him.
5, 6, 7, 0, 60, pound.
It would be a shame for me to go on with an actor.
I'm a nice one, wouldn't it?
Because I know the best.
What is it?
Hi, Appali.
What do you got?
Hi, Appali.
What do you guys think?
Little house in the street.
Little house on the...
I'll say one thing, man.
There's your whip up.
Hi, Appali.
Yeah, they're a frenzy.
Well, must be all of them people at the Marling games.
Again, I don't want to do this twice in a row, but I'll do it again.
It's amazing to me.
It's a real tribute to the fascination, the desperation of the people
that start with a landsound of something good.
With those 42,000 people on Saturday and other 28,000 yesterday,
even though they lost two out of three of the braids.
But they're just packing them in.
What was it about 32,000 Friday, I think?
They had three mat...
Well, Josh would know.
He's probably was out there with some free tickets.
They've had massive crowds out there.
Right, a few mongers.
And especially when you consider that the town is as barren as...
What's her name?
Rosio Dahl.
That's my TV show for the pool.
Rosio Dahl, see second great minds work alike.
26 past 10 at 5.60, QAM, where we used to be pretty good.
Come on, I'm I.
And local.
This is 4.205.60.
You're way, way, yeah.
Tonight, on Afghan Channel One, the hilarious new sitcom,
Just Shoot Everybody!
Tonight's episode, Osama Bane, is haunted down by the infidels
and starts shooting everybody!
I'm shooting now!
Salah Van Clarex begins to smuggle family members into Pakistan and their terbencies.
That's a magic in your terben?
Are you just glad to see me?
Josh Shoot Everybody!
Tonight on Afghan Channel One, followed by suddenly sanctions.
It's TV to die for.
Speaking of that, thank you Mr. President for those low gas prices.
They just showed a clip. Did you see it on CNN?
Were you on there?
No.
247.9 for Premium Unlimited out in California.
248.
Two and a half bucks a gallon, baby.
Thank you for those low gas prices.
At any rate.
I didn't realize when I, because this pool here,
and of course we do rack our brains to come up with something different,
something we haven't done exactly the same way before.
How many thousand pools have we done already?
About 30, man!
Yeah, so it's a little bit different, and spider-what JJ says blow it out to your ass.
That kind of thing.
But I never realized how this could be going forever,
because there's so many bad shows.
But amazingly, look what seems to be taking the early lead.
Great surprise.
Oh!
The rich ranch-ass show.
Alright.
They hate you, Rick.
Even worse than they hate, uh, what's his name?
Greg Vudell.
Hmm.
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.
That's the name.
That's the name.
That's the name.
Yeah, sir.
How are you, buddy?
How's the weather in T.O.?
It's, uh, toasty.
It's 58 today.
Not too bad.
Sweet.
I got two things waiting.
Yes?
Number one is, uh, the gas prices.
I said all way before that book by Woodward even came out.
That, you know, Bush is going to have to pull a couple of things out of his hat
in order to make himself look good before election time.
Welcome.
Yeah.
If you've noticed in the past, whether they be in the past, whether they be Republican or Democratic,
presidents, when the gas got out of control, the president always spoke up about it.
And this is the only president that hasn't mentioned not one word with the exception of maybe like a week or so ago.
He hasn't mentioned anything about that.
Well, who else off his boyfriend, Prince Bandar, and certainly not Prince Abdullah?
Well, I think that that probably confirms what Woodward said in his book is that right before the election,
after they find out some, of course, that the price of fuel is to come down and the president is to say, hey, see what I did?
Yeah.
And he's just doing it.
Don't know if somebody did all right.
Yeah.
Another thing is the polls, not your polls, but the polls like you see in the Washington polls or CNN.
Right.
They ask you a question.
In your opinion, do you think that these polls in any way are rigged?
You mean you're talking about like presidential polls?
Because, yeah, because, you know, if you look at it, they say, well, considering everything that's been happening
with Iraq war and all the deaths and the Mayhem and the money and the deficit and all of the problems that have been caused as a reason.
Well, I know where you're going with this.
Let me just cut you off to the past and tell you this.
I think probably 60% of the public are just dying to find somebody else to vote for beside Bush.
But you know what?
Kerry so far has been so marginal and so weak.
But he hasn't made the case.
But say that's your step because you look at the polls.
And I don't know who the first of all they've never asked me for my opinion.
Yeah.
I don't know who they're asking, but they're saying, well, 51 or 53% of the American people still feel that Bush should have gone into Iraq.
No, no, no, no, I got a better poll than that for you.
And I don't want to spend all day on this, but I got a much better one that that'll really get you depressed and you want to blow your brains out.
57%.
This poll was just taken over the weekend.
I got to hear somewhere in my palm.
57% of Americans continue to believe that San Jose gave substantial support to our cut-it-tarrers before the war of the war.
And at monitoring what are these people reading?
Where are they getting their information from?
CNN.
I love you, Neil.
See you.
Certainly not news.
You're the evil empire of CNN.
You people are a crook, okay?
Let's see a fact from Jeff.
I still need to hear Geldy's run when he touches Moe's bag.
Please talk about the cruise.
Oh, geez.
Please talk about this.
Please talk about that.
Please don't talk about this.
Please, whatever you do.
I'll talk about that.
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do and we can we say do do do.
No, okay.
I can't even say do do no more.
Much less do it.
And whatever you do.
It ain't enough.
Don't do it.
Yeah, that's right.
All the instructions all the time.
5670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Would you marry me to get me legal?
WQAM, hello.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
And you have over your poll.
Yes.
The end of the course mission.
And of course, the okay.
The actual in choice as in.
Okay.
See, it'll take a lot of a long list on here before we just start getting much response.
No, seriously, because there's only 54 votes and that's because they haven't seen the one they would vote for yet.
Well, they better get busy.
Rick Sanchez showed 25, Dr. Phil 11, Rosio Donald 5, survivor 5, he, haw 4, Rosanne 2, Buck Rogers,
one little house on a prairie one.
Nine yet for Alice, lost in space, but loveboat.
Where did those come from?
Oh, faxes.
Loveboat.
That's a good choice.
Yes.
For renders, grotesque.
We pre-cute that inducing.
That nice fax just said loveboat on the fax and, you know, that's it.
Right, just one, not a whole list.
Just right to the point.
The whole fax that went to you because they got artwork also.
See, the thing with the loveboat is they always brought, they like jack Jones and all these other washed up old marginal entertainers.
You know what I'm talking about.
I was, these people couldn't get any other work in a business.
So they, they would show up on the loveboat and you were just praying that it would do another Titanic routine.
It was to keep the artists working while they were on hiatus from other shows or in the news.
On hiatus rojects.
Somebody QA and hello.
Yes, good morning.
Yes, sir.
I'm speaking.
Speaking.
What about the magic Johnson chat show?
Magic Johnson chat show with obnoxious.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Cheers.
5 6 7 0 5 60 prime the chat show.
The bridge new call talk shows chat shows.
You didn't know that.
Yes, I do.
I see.
And they also say don't say it.
I'm not whatever they say.
You can't say it anymore.
WQA.
Oh, man.
That was a extra allowable.
Not a good one or what?
Man, that will work.
Yeah.
WQA.
Hello.
Yeah, hi.
Is this WQA?
This is WQAM.
Great.
This is I'm calling it Q stands for queer.
Yes.
In fact, you I am stands for queer is me.
Quiris.
It's the big one.
Me.
Gay.
Me.
Who's to me?
How you doing?
Al Fagarito.
Pretty good.
That was good.
I like it.
Go ahead.
Hey, listen.
I'm trying to find out what.
I apologize, by the way, the show is good as it used to be before we got the facts from JJ, but we're trying to put it up.
Go ahead.
This is Leo.
What's the name of the law firm that you recommend for tickets?
The one?
Oh, you're talking about the ticket defense team.
Right.
1-800-741-836-18741-Team-TEM.
836-6, great.
Don't do it again, Pali.
All right, buddy.
Please hold on.
Slow your ass down.
Or they're going to drag it away.
5-670-5.
I haven't heard from JJ yet.
And Pember Pines, he or she or it or whatever it is, is probably just twisting that dial, twisting the day away.
Just reaching, praying to find something really entertaining, like the Clark Webber show.
Now, what is that guy's name that they piped in from Tampa, from FLA?
I can't even think of his name.
Another right-wing, another Rush clone.
WDQA, I'm hello.
Hey, Neil.
How are you doing?
Pretty good.
Hey, I got one for you.
How about you fix your life with Groucho Mark?
That was the worst show ever.
Hey, yeah, I thought that was...
Even when the duck dropped out, you didn't like it?
WAAAAK!
Okay.
Wow.
You guess he didn't like George Speneman?
How could anybody not like Groucho?
It was a good show.
It was fun.
I mean, the prizes were like $50.
Of course, it was a long time ago.
Back in the day, when $50 was worth like maybe $55.
But how could anybody not like that?
But again, we're asking you, your opinion, the worst TV show of all time,
is you bet your life he said, with Groucho and Groucho don't care no more.
Speaking of that, Jack O'Sacco, we got that story about Jacko's new lawyers now.
I'm so sick and tired of him, you know what?
Islamic groups, he's firing a radio host in Boston,
priest charged in 1980, killing of none.
See, I'm just reading headlines from some of these ahead of time before I ever get into them.
So then that way they won't waste their fax paper, with more of the same crack.
I bet the local, these things, he's five cities, the radio's all yours.
You win!
I know, recorded in front of the tape audience, a beautiful, televised sunny Hollywood, California.
Disturbed by the angel.
Kathy?
Yes, Mom?
Are you having that not-so-fresh feeling?
How'd you know?
Mom's no-these things.
Hello?
Oh, it's you.
Now come over here.
Mom, who's that?
It's...it's Delegrease.
Mom?
What's she doing?
I got a scream, that not-so-fresh feeling, I-
You're right.
I can't breathe.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Mom, what's she doing?
Make her scream!
Mom, I just made her scream!
Get this...
Relax!
Mom?
Have I?
Yes, Kathy.
You've been duched by an angel.
Oh, Mom?
Oh, Kathy!
Oh, Delegrease.
You're an index freak.
And find out what happens when Delegrease meets Mr. Team from the A-Team.
What?
You want us to get in, mate?
All the three guns, to be heard!
Boy, it's a good thing we knew the context of that,
because that sound sounded awfully like something else that we can't do no more, you know?
I dumped it.
You did what?
I dumped that sound.
That wasn't the sound.
That wasn't what that sound was.
What sounded like it today?
That was not a fart.
I know.
But it sounded like one.
No, no, no.
See, that's a raspberry.
That sounds like one, too.
All right, well, I didn't want to have anybody...
Oh, my God.
Are you...
Are you smitten me?
I have no doubt at all.
What a class hole!
You know, all right.
Play it against the gun.
No, I'm not going to play it again.
Anyway, somebody says test by an angel.
I went through all difficulty of playing it, which I like that bit.
Delegrease.
And you dumped the part where the douching sound went on that.
You know a bunch of reactions that would occur.
I don't care what kind of reaction.
In fact, that's one of the reasons I wanted to play it just to get listed that kind of reaction
since he can't send me the toothbrushes because the company's too cheap to send me those radios toothbrushes.
You got me.
I'm going to tell that story.
Multi-million-dollar stock exchange listed company, Beasley Broadcasting.
Okay.
Now, every few months you're supposed to replace your toothbrush.
I'm one of those lazy slabs who doesn't do that.
And of course, you know, it's just not a good idea.
Right.
Now, for years now, I've been brushing my teeth with the radios toothbrushes.
If there's any one product that I enthusiastically recommend, and it's so good, that's probably
why you can't find it.
Right.
You go into like your Walgreens or records or anywhere, and you look for a toothbrush.
Where's the radios ones?
You know, they make a right-handed one.
The left hand ones got like the big head with a lot of bristles on it.
And it's great.
You can't find it.
No.
80 million toothbrushes is there.
Now, I did find one at Walgreens when I was home.
I should have brought it here with me, but I left it down here because, you know, I got
all the stuff in Miami and all the stuff here, too.
So I don't have to slip it all around.
I figured no problem.
I'll go to a shopper's drug mart here at Toronto, and I'll buy me a radios toothbrush.
Did I find one?
No.
Can't find them.
So then I thought, well, I'll be a little more creative.
I'll go online and see just per chance if maybe from Amazon.com or eBay or somewhere, you can buy a radios toothbrush online.
Yes.
But do they ship to Canada?
No.
No.
So I told George about it.
So George was kind enough to like order from, was it Amazon.com?
It was on right.
Got me not one, but two radios toothbrushes.
A nice, I don't know what the one.
Well, pink one because QIM, Twitter and me and a white one.
And a white one.
Oh, white one.
At any rate, so the deal was that we're going to ship it up here to me.
And he figured since duct don't really have too much to do since he's busy sitting around listening to the show on that.
And that's his idea of a job.
He might as well do something constructive, make him feel like he really put in a good day's work.
We'll give the toothbrushes the duct and let him send them up there to Neil and Toronto.
What do you say?
So this morning, you gave him the duct.
I heard the conversation.
We had a, I thank him in advance.
Five minutes later he comes back.
Oh, they won't go for it.
What?
The company won't pay the shipping.
It might cost 50 bucks to send you.
Now keep in mind that since I've been here these last two years, doing a show of good percentage of the time,
I've spent probably $18, $100 out of my own pocket.
Unsupplies on the fast paper, on the toner, on the drum, all of these things.
You know, $15, $18,000 bucks.
Never, ever charged him a dime.
Follow?
Not to mention the millions of dollars that the show is making them so that they can be a sportsholder rest of the day, 20 other hours.
But no, 50 bucks to, and I don't think it really would be 50 bucks, but whatever would be.
And I said, I'll reimburse them.
They can deduct it from my pay.
I can't do it.
Broad in the county said, or yeah, the accounting broad can't, I can't do it.
So we're making other arrangements.
Okay, we're going to smuggle the toothbrushes in the somebody's.
Right.
Wow.
I'm telling you, man, you people in that company, you're a disgrace.
You're just a joke.
You're an industry joke.
Now this thing is speaking to jokes that you just factored me about Kim Bock, Cameron Troister, I've heard.
I guess it's a, they're driving miniature horses at Pompato Park tonight.
That's all I can read.
I can't read any of this.
I reckon come eat former blah blah blah.
Come eat former players can both come for a stretcher and what do you benefit?
I don't know.
Do you know who what he benefit is?
Is that?
No.
What do you benefit?
I know what he, Alan.
What do you eat it?
What do you grab?
I beg your pardon?
Huh?
As they contest the compete, I can't read.
It's a bad, it's real dark.
Let's see, how about adding their all irrelevant to people with a life 22-year list nerd first-time fashier?
Don't keep knocking the brits without them.
You need to be a bar of soap or we'd all be speaking English.
Oh yeah, right.
The brits you mean the ones that we have to keep bailing out every time there's a World War?
I'd be a bar of soap.
My ass, man, who you can.
Graham.
British by birth American by choice.
Well now you're talking, although lately, not a good choice.
I think you're funny now.
You've really invented new naughty words.
When we must go to satellite radio, if John A. Croft and his cronies don't get there first.
Well, there you go, Graham.
Tattock to loose Lattrex.
Lattrex.
Here's the fact that it says you've got to watch Deadwood totally adult grade acting, out-supranos to sopranos.
Ascroft will hate this show and take it down.
You're going down.
It is that good.
Profane nudity, history and reality, grade acting, grade lines, casted characters is unbelievable.
Un-daleable.
And despicable, which makes it great.
Watch it while you can before they take it off.
Deadwood.
Haven't seen it.
Have you heard about it?
Pope Brian did a bit about it.
I know.
We're just whorn.
I just played it.
Oh, that's what you dumped.
Just before you dumped the Ella Grease.
I can't believe you did that.
All right, play it again.
I won't touch it.
I'm not going to play it again.
That would be ponderous, but the idea, I mean, we know what that sound was.
It's within the context of the bit.
And you're calling that a farting sound?
No, no, no.
I'm not calling it a farting sound.
How about the guy that puts his hand under his armpit and makes those sounds?
You know, is that a farting sound?
I don't think you fart through your armpit.
At least I never have yet.
Although I've met some people who smell like maybe they were doing it.
Yeah, see?
There he goes, Josh.
Mark it down.
That's pit music.
Yeah.
It's the pits all right.
WQA, hello.
Yeah, the gong show.
The gong show was tragic.
It was tragic, or?
Thanks.
I think it was tragic on purpose.
Probably, but he's just saying.
Yeah, it was supposed to be tragic.
It was supposed to be embarrassing.
But Chuck Barr has killed 33 people.
And he was with the CIA.
The thing I love best about that thing on biography was that even his best friends say,
oh, we never know what he's been serious.
We don't know whether he just made all of that up or whether he really was a CIA agent.
You know, little shrimpy guy.
Those are the dangerous ones and little shrimpy guys.
Tell him.
That's what Anna Maria used to tell me.
We have these.
Look at this.
Here's somebody keeping track of the attendance.
38,000 Friday, 41,000 Saturday, 28,000 last night, 107,000 at the Marlon Games.
Not too bad for a weekend series.
We even got to see a couple of Goldberg sub signs.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
Can you explain that to me?
Nothing.
What Goldberg are they talking about?
Not the Humper.
Is that all it says about?
It says we...
You should have seen Krispy Kreme on PBL, Palm Beach, Palm Beach, like the Blur West Palm on Sunday morning.
Three dozen donuts with a ticket stub.
What a zoo it says.
You think that if they reinstate the draft, people will finally start to show some real protest.
Thanks and best of you in George.
Love you both.
It says Janie West Palm Beach.
A little bit.
See if Krispy Kreme.
Not.
Boy, I do love those.
But you can't eat only three.
560, 560, pound 560 on a AT&T inforizon line.
The worst TV show of all time.
Rick Sanchez Show, 41.
You're making an impact, Rick.
You got him talking.
Dr. Phil 20, survivor 14, N and Nicole 12.
Rosio Donald Show, 8 and 8.
He-Ha 5, Rosanne 4, the low boat 3.
Magic Johnson Show, Chatt Show, and two...
Buck Rogers One, Little House on the Prairie One.
I'm touched by an angel one and then a bunch of none out of 112.
WDQAM, hello.
QAM.
Hi, I'm Cleo.
How are you?
Pretty good.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
I have a name for your highly irrelevant poll.
Yes.
And it sits right in with the sports theme of QAM, the Magic Johnson Show.
Oh, I would have sworn I just read that one.
Is that one?
You have that one?
It's got some vote.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
That thing was awful.
What about our Sineo Hall?
He was right behind that.
Our Sineo Hall definitely deserves to be on there.
He was the real hoot.
Yeah, he was the real hoot.
I love you to pieces and have a wonderful day and don't come back too soon because it stinks here.
I know that's what I'm here with.
Thanks.
Love you.
Bye.
I can smell it all the way up here.
Oh man, that must be coming from a ranger.
That's the swap gas.
The swamp what?
What did he just say?
Gas.
No gas.
In fact.
You can't ask for it.
It's so up and out of shape about that whole deal.
Pretty soon it's going to be mandatory.
They're going to fit you when you're born with a cork in your ass.
Correct them.
That's right.
That's your quid-emitting all of those nasty gaseous sound.
He don't care how much it smells too bad.
He doesn't care about that.
Because I'm sure that his don't stink.
WQA, I'm hello.
Yes.
Happy days.
Happy days.
I agree with you, man.
That was a stinker.
I'm sure that was so tremendously popular.
Almost every character on there was just obnoxious, including the fons.
And especially Tom Bosley.
Yeah, man.
Tom Bosley.
He was just highly irritating at best.
1056 at 560 QAM.
We're supporting you 560 at QAM.
It's day.
If I have a town at 560 WQAM.
Hello again, everyone, from the Channel 7 News Center.
I'm Rick Sanchez with your 60-second Goal 4 update.
We have some new reports that just came in.
They're hard to explain, so let's move to the Middle East War map.
Rick's world, if you will.
And I'll try to explain.
Rick's world, Rick's world.
Hurry on, have fun.
Hurry on, everyone.
Hurry on, everyone.
I'm your most excellent anchor, Rick Sanchez.
And with me, as always, Sally Fitts, party on sale.
Party on, Rick.
Called San Pedro lately.
Not since I've been back from Houston.
People in the business remember, but fortunately for me,
the public has a short memory.
Say, what about that guy you flattened?
Is he still in a coma?
Uh, yeah.
Still in a coma.
I'm so glad you brought that up, Sal.
Not.
Anyway, who's saying blew off a couple more scudds
at the occupied West Bank.
But those awesome Patriot dudes intercepted it.
A boo.
A boo.
As you know, the insane who's saying,
gosh, can I turn an original phrase or what?
Yes, poison gas, but as I squat.
And.
That's an act of art.
I don't know.
Get on my gas.
Why does while Keller right there, you know?
Like nowhere near.
I sure hope you dumped it, because I didn't.
I didn't dump anything.
What?
Not after that last tune when I got it.
I think we need a seminar is what we need.
You know, you dumped it.
You'd better tell me that you did.
All right.
You didn't know Josh didn't know.
Oh boy, who are you man?
I can just see right now suspended a sentence.
Wow.
Change, Mr.
Yeah.
It's a raspberry.
You got raspberries in his ass.
That was your friend, does that mean?
Raspberry.
Yeah, it was an asperi.
I never thought about that.
That's probably what it was.
It was just an asperi that thought it was a drop in.
Anyway, so glad I played that.
Not Bob and Tyler has you says that I can propose fantasy island as the worst television show all time.
Very good choice, Bob.
Thank you so much.
Why?
We just can't take any chances no more, you know what?
I'm just dumping everything.
See, I just dumped it again.
Not very reason.
Just just going to keep hitting the button just in case.
Just periodic look every few seconds.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT and T in Verizon wireless line.
We got the mad bog at two.
The a Humper at four.
Now, what was that thing about Goldberg sucks?
What was that all about?
It was not about our Hank.
Was it?
Is there a player?
There's the wrestler.
I don't know what that means.
Anyway, Hank will be at Chula State too, Miami Lakes.
I'll tell you whether or not he sucks.
7 o'clock it's the Crow.
Oh my goodness.
As the Crow flies, the Crow is unlike on a weekday.
You got to be kidding me.
That's got to be.
I got to Crow by the right here, home boy.
And then of course the Marlon.
Oh, I see that's the reason because it's before the Marlins.
It's the pre pre four play game show.
830 got Marlins on deck.
905 to Marlins at the Colorado Rockies in Denver.
And after that we sign off to let everybody take a rest.
How many QAAM?
Hello.
Hey, Neal, how you doing?
Pretty good?
I know that didn't get dumped.
It sounded more like a dump actually.
Well, you leave almost made it get charged there's the end last night.
They stink, man.
I'll care right out there.
You can't win any games unless you score some goals.
You got to put the biscuit in the basket.
They don't score any goals.
Hey, for one third of the lifetime of the flyers we actually have a goalie that seems to be able to make a few stops.
He's unbelievable.
He played phenomenal last night.
He was spectacular.
It's great to see that.
No, it's good.
Maybe you guys get a chance next one, but I doubt it.
I think we took it away last night.
I think it's all over, pal.
All right, Neal, keep in tight.
Good luck to you.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, good times, good times for Esther Roll.
She still be dead.
But somebody picking says definitely, Bob says it was definitely bad times for anybody who's tried to sit through five minutes of that record.
It was awful.
Here's another really bad one.
Getting some really good suggestions now for this Pope.
Welcome back, Carter.
Even the music makes me want to upchuck.
Welcome back.
What's up, guys?
Name with the mustache.
Don't tell me.
It'll come to me.
Kaplan, Gabe Kaplan.
Very good.
Yeah, well, I just one of those things.
I take a couple of seconds.
I don't like Gabe Kaplan.
I hated that shoe even worse.
Oh, no.
Welcome back, Squatter.
Careful when you go with that.
Anyway, another dead soldier in Fallujah, which makes three today, two in Baghdad, one in Fallujah.
Americans, that is.
We don't know the names, though, and we're not interrupting the regular programming to put on some breathless reports because this one, evidently, was not another famous football player.
There were nobody's.
Okay.
So let them lose their souls.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lines.
Celebrity, man.
That's what that's all about.
If your famous, your life is worth something.
If you're not so famous, who cares?
That's the message.
WDQA and Hello.
Hey, Neil. How about this one?
One day in the life, or one day at a time, with Valerie Bernelli and the Phillips girl and the Abani Franklin.
Grotesque.
Yes, sir. Good choice.
One day at a time.
You got it?

One gate at a time.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Almost a million people, maybe more than a million.
Marching in at Women's and March.
Yesterday, that was pretty impressive.
Yeah.
Not getting nearly as much coverage of courses as the fact that the Pat Tillman died in Afghanistan.
You do understand that, don't you?
Well, they were famous women there, too.
Well, they don't care about them.
WDQA and Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about Chess?
How about it?
Grotesque. Good choice.
Especially with that. What's your name?
Don't tell me again.
I can see him.
He smells like a bad burrito.
Give you a hint.
Yeah.
Same first name as our website guy.
Eric Estrada.
Ooh.
What a lady.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Oh, three's company.
That's not waiting.
I thought that was the one with Bonnie Franklin.
She was one day at a time.
Who's the guest covers and John Ritter, your favorite.
Oh, John Ritter, Rest in Pieces, huh?
That was another horrendous show.
I think that's what put Ritter over the edge.
VB about it.
I mean, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
And I think that's what the happy to him for doing.
Yeah, another annoying thing.
Let's do a theme song show.
No.
I think we had to do that one last week just to piss off JJ and Pembert Pines.
But we know it's still good to its radio.
WDQA and Hello.
WQA and Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What do you think of the dukes of Hazard?
Well, I had my own reasons for lucky.
You're asking a wrong guy.
Bad show.
You're right.
All right.
Thank you.
Bad show.
Dukes of Hazard will put on air.
I tried to snite her a lot though.
Although, you know, something.
I'm going to tell you.
I've said this before.
That show was so bad that even as good as he looked,
I still didn't watch it.
Right.
And that's just a lot.
Likewise, very daisy, dude.
She was not.
There were some hot people on that show.
And they were all dressed in that real provocative
or the real, real tight, tight clothing, you know,
back at a 70 style.
But they didn't watch it.
They didn't watch a minute of it.
You know, just camel surfing when you go through
like Nickelodeon stuff.
Oh, look at that.
They always had car chases.
There you go.
It's the Dukes of Hazard.
It's still on.
And I see her saying,
he haw, which kind of says that.
I don't know.
I said, he haw.
I wonder what channel I got on here.
That's, let's see.
That's got he haw on it.
I hope you enjoy your suspension, by the way.
The rockford file.
Oh, rockford files is on.
Look at this.
Oh, okay.
Listen.
I'm going to check it out right away.
At least one thing we know there.

But we all fight out.
Okay.
Not the way things are going.
WM Hello.
Hello.
Can I tell you two of them?
No, one.
Take a look.
Green acres.
Green acres is a fabulous choice.
You can never do that.
Thank you so much.
Green acres.

You got it, man.
Thanks.
Thanks, Pally.
You too.
Every time I hear another one of these, I think, yeah, that's the one.
No, that's the one.
They all suck.
No wonder we're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're like that.
Television has rotted our brains, boys and girls.
And kids, you haven't found out.
What happened to the Golden Days, man, with howdy-duty?
I mean, with howdy-
Yeah.
Care, can't say that no, Mo.
And Mr. Bluster.
Finneas T. Bluster.
And Princess Summerfall, Winter Spring, and Carrick, Clearbel.
The worst TV show of all time, the Rick Sanchez show, they're not going to touch a Rick.
And of course, who would want to?
Dr. Phil 29.
And in the cool 24, that Smith.
Or the show that Will Smith was on, that was a horrible show.
Which one?
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
That's the one.
Oh, man.
I think you just named it.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
Hmm, not too fresh.
I can smell it all the way up here.
It needs to be reduced by an angel.
Survivor 22, Rosie O'Donnell 14.
The Magic Johnson Show, the Chattel 14.
The Love Boat 7.
And then it's a single that's just from there.
But the list is building.
You'll find one you hated like poison.
Trust me when I tell you if you haven't already.
The Love Boat.
Just the way that the announcer on ABC said that.
The Love Boat.
Oh, man, nauseating.
Maybe you want to just go over the puke overboard.
WDQA, and hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil, first time I saw him.
All right.
Hey, Neil, I got something for a fall here.
Okay.
Rota and Teddy Coat Junction.
That sounds like a pair to me.
You notice how he slipped those in there?
I said, yes, give us one.
But we'll put them both on there because I'm in a good mood now.
Why am I in a good mood?
Because I don't know.
Because I just got through ripping the beesleaves for what a bunch of cheap bastards they are.
Man, it's, I mean, can you even imagine?
Oh, it's going to cost us 50 bucks to send you that stuff.
And by the way, Troy Stratford, your responses on there on my emails is very, very unacceptable.
Man, that is so, well, it'll be there any day in a wascent.
Yeah.
It's in the mail, like a check.
It's in the mail.
Very weak, Troy.
Typical QAM sales hole response.
Not acceptable.
Unfailable.
Or maybe just unacceptable.
WQA, and hello.
Yeah, how you doing, buddy?
Pretty good, pal.
I'm going to show that I'm a sports hole around the horn.
What is that?
It can be a PN show.
It's like the worst show.
Is that a show with Dave Van Horn?
It's kind of like Van Boren.
Yeah.
Enjoy your suspension for the Razz Day, buddy.
I got plans.
Now, we don't get suspended for Razz Brothers.
It was just, uh, what would Dela Grease drop the Razz Brothers?
What she did?
She hangs out with a lot of fruit is what I hear.
It's 11 past 11, but that was right on the edge, man.
What we're doing the best we can.
Okay, it's very difficult.
We're like pressing buttons and reaching and grabbing stuff like that.
Of course, that's the QM way anyway.
Just asked Maddie Bell a lot of reaching and grabbing.
That's what I hear.
Is that what you heard?
Yeah, I heard that.
I'll tell you one thing you won't hear no more.
And that's about eating.
Won't hear that.
So when George fills in this summer, those of you who are grossed out by those disgusting shows like eating.
You won't hear that.
White Lauderdale is pretty peered about it.
And you certainly won't hear that taste like a any more either.
In fact, now we got one called taste like a silver dollar.
That's just favorite.

He said adding that she spoke or she said adding that she spoke with WTK K. J.
No manager on Friday it causes a downwards spiral of hostility toward interfaith relations in our society should not tolerate it
Matthew Mills the general manager of WTKK declined to comment on Severin's alleged comments on what they this Saturday
But WHDH television reported that a WTKK representative said Severin would apologize on his show today. He's gonna apologize
Ahmed said that on Friday Mills told her that
Organization that the statement was taken out of context. He said Severin wasn't talking about American Muslims
He was talking about Muslims outside the US. Oh, yeah
But I don't know how a statement like let's kill all Muslims can be put in any type of context that would be okay
Ahmed said we recognized the importance of free speech but people need to be responsible
Yeah, be responsible up there and Boston you lunatics you many acts you you preverts

They were not letting him say goodbye
They unsurmoniously dumped his ass
Bob Weaver
My good close personal friend
Weaver the weather man
You people at channel six are a bunch of axe murderers

I think others will catch him
And pass him like he's squatting still
I should play that bit
So what were he squatting over a rack you know
I ain't saying no
But not anymore than that
There was nothing wrong with that
It was just like somebody burst his balloon that's off
All this panic about
Oh I heard that sound
I heard the sound
Yeah well prove it
Okay
It's got to pass the sniff test
On the show
If it don't pass the sniff test
If it's got no aroma
Then don't count
Like there's no passionate
It's like if you fart in the elevator
It doesn't have any aroma
If it's an SBD
No it if it's what's the opposite
Noisy but
antiseptic
Then NBA
It's a wheelchabin fart
NBA
Anyway the worst ever sing-a-lar with Mitch
Oh could that have been the Mitch Miller show
I don't recall that he had a show
But that if he did it
Well you're right Jay
Jay says sing-a-lar with Mitch
You know what I loved about Mitch Miller
And I said it's very sarcastic
Maybe said for me was from Rochester
He used to do the thing with the hand
How do I do it on the radio
Look in the speaker on your radio folks
Hey look
You know what I'm talking about
We hit his hands like a penny or like a duffing
Oh man
The good news is Mitch Miller is dead
That's the good news
No more that
Let's say chicken soup with Jackie Mason
Was by far the worst TV show ever
Was it on long enough to qualify
It was terminal it says chicken soup
With Jackie Mason who's still talking like this
He and Moe are the only two people in a world speak like that
Absolutely
No I mean
Oh and I've had you one person that Moe ain't speaking like that
Or like anything else to
I mentioned this before but I'll mention it again
Just a bust his balls
And that's guilty
What about it
They don't speak
Oh yeah yeah
You mentioned that
Very little conversation in between the year what's on the year
They just uh you know kind of sit there and look in the opposite direction
It didn't take
I've all took quite a while took a couple of years
And guilty about that
That religion
And this of course comes right from the horses mouth
When I was there something came to me and said
Just like that
Told me the whole story
But that's it's you Moe
The man wants to be like he wants to be loved
The man
But he just is a hard guy to love
Now back in the day I could have had some good lines about that

If he was running the good campaign
Yeah
I mean a war is a disaster
The economy gas prices
Every day they seem to be
Ining an all-time new high
248 for premium and light in California today
When I was there I paid
208
208 to fill up my beautiful Corvette
You ready for that
In my life
Did I ever pay two bucks a gallon for gas?
No
No
So an economy is still unemployment is rampant
They keep peddling you know
Keep manipulating all the numbers
Well the market is this
Yeah
Today maybe not tomorrow
In fact what is the market doing today
That's take a quick peek
Is it bad?
No not real bad
Just kind of like medium bad
No look at that
That's just flip-flopped
Kind of like bush and Carrie
It's doing a flip-flop
That's up three points
And that's that down for 82 cent
Not doing much
But any kind of a candidate
That was really running an other campaign
And then of course miss
Speaking of miss fudge
All the carried tapes
The carried tapes
Maybe he's going to show the carried tapes
How he threw his medals in 1971
Who gives a flying fudge about that at this point huh
Who cares
He threw anything they got if he
If all of a sudden he wakes up in the morning
Carrie he's got a pimple on his ass

The worst TV show of all time is
Bridget loves Bernie says some facts here.
Leonard, thank you Leonard.
Priests charge in 1980.
Killing of none.
This is a lovely story.
Another one of these isolated incidents.
Toledo, Ohio.
A Roman Catholic priest was charged in the 1980 killing of a none
whose body was found in the chapel of the hospital,
where he served as chaplain police said.
The Reverend Gerald Robinson 63 was arrested Friday.
Five months after police reopened the investigation,
into the death of sister Margaret and Paul.
Chief Mike Navarro said.
Paul 71 was stabbed about 30 times.
About 30, man.
And strangled April 5, 1980 police said her body was found
in the chapel of Toledo's Mercy Hospital,
where she was the caretaker.
At a news conference Friday night, Navarro said
new technology led to Robinson's arrest.
He wouldn't elaborate on what the link was to Robinson.
Nobody talk about evidence or motive.
Police started up the cold case based on a tip
provided the Lucas County Prosecutor's Office.
The Reverend Michael Billion spoke to him
for the 19 county diocese of Toledo said,
Church officials will cooperate with Poli.
So it's certainly saddened the diocese.
He says, a lot of sad stuff going on these days
in the Catholic Church, you know this?
Yeah, I noticed.
It's sad.
But then again, just pass the plate, please.
I'll pass it over.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
Let's get a list of about 23,000 names.
About 30,000, man.
A really bad TV show.
So many and so little time.
Line 9, WQA, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got a show for your poll.
OK.
The 700 Club with Pat Robertson.
If we want to consider that a show,
what's your release?
But who wants to be picky at this time since it's a big hit?
I'll hold him.
OK, me too.
Thank you.
The 700 Club.
Is that really the name of a show?
Yeah.
It is?
Sure.
OK.
Showed off.
The 700 Club with the obnoxious smearing grinning.
Oh, man.
Too bad about that Charles Taylor, you know, Africa.
All those deals he had going.
Sport all his plans.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
WQA, hello.
What happened?
How you doing, Pali?
That's not choice.
What happened?
Oh, I think OK.
What happened?
OK.
I thought he would give me like a greeting, but it's what happened?
Was that really the name of the show?
Yes.
What happened?
Well, who was on that show?
Re-run.
Re-run?
He died.
Or was it an original?
What happened?
I just vaguely remember that.
How long ago was that?
Not long enough.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
WQA, hello.
How you doing, sir?
Good check.
What's the Wyoming guy?
The Wyoming guy.
The Wyoming guy is the right wing guy in the morning.
Glenn Beck, right.
Glenn Beck.
Bill Tech and Glenn Beck.
Right.
And then that show that I had probably the worst one day at a time.
That Snyder guy was in the closet, dude.
Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Now, one day at a time, I thought, didn't we do that one?
I thought we put that on there already.
Well, let's take a look.
That was the Bonnie Franklin, right?
See.
And the guy, the janitor was Pat Harrington.
Correct.
From the Steve Allen show.
And Valerie Bertonelli.
And Valerie Bertie.
She was cutesy.
Sure.
Mackenzie Phillips.
She wasn't cutesy enough to save the show, though.
No.
And by the way, horrible.
Horrible.
Horrible.
Horrible.
Horrible.
Show.
It was bad.
It was annoying.
And how come it is that so many of these annoying shows?
I guess they must have had some kind of a good deal for the putting in this indication.
Because these shows keep coming back.
Here's another one.
The most watch show in the world.
I already know because you already just saw me the facts.
The most watched TV program in the history of the world is they watch.
What does that tell you that there's no chance for human race?
There's a best youth for that, even though I didn't watch it.
Had the, you know, the anxious.
Okay.
Now, let me see if I can remember his name, Billy Batson.
Billy, don't tell me.
The little kid with a black hair, the short kid.
He sure looks better than a panel of Lee, but then you need to do with anybody.
He looks better than panel Lee.
Billy, uh, Babbit.
No.
I don't know what his name is.
Are you talking about the surfer?
Yeah.
Kelly Slater.
No, not Kelly Slater.
Kelly Slater was like a real surfer.
And we were like, this was on the show.
He was a surfer.
He was a surfer like Alamo.
Billy Warlock.
That's it.
See how easy that was?
Just slipped right off your tongue.
You know, I can honestly say I've never watched it in the video.
I've never seen an entire episode of that show.
Really?
Really?
Uh, I've watched it, but only in Europe.
When there was no other English language program on, you know, either in Amsterdam or
in Germany.
It's on just about every country in the world.
I tried to watch it and then Pam comes on the street.
And then, and then to show you how desperate the world is to show you what bad taste people
got, they really think that David Hasselhoff is like an actor like a stud like, like a
something as opposed to here where we know him best and we can't put him almost into
a category with the rick Sanchez.
WQM, hello?
No.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I got a couple of 40 men.
How about one?
Okay, one.
What about Dan Sviver?
Dan Sviver, bad show, but Dan Sviver, and it was Danny Terrio.
See?
As far as gripping out of Danny's doing these days, okay, if I may be murdering him appearing
at Danny's.
Oh, that's all I want you to craft, okay?
He was madly in love with Eva Gabor.
We know that.
Yeah.
Come on, Murr.
Come on, before it's too late.
Well, that's my poll question.
What a murder, Griffin, Charlie, Chris and Norma Lee can't have in common.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
So far, Rick Sanchez show 80 and in the cool 58, that cow, Dr. Phil 48, Survivor 35, Magic
Johnson, Chat Show 29, Rosie O'Donnell 20.
Did we get our sinew on here or not?
Not yet.
Yeah.
We did?
We did?
I was always afraid he was going to fall right off the edge of that couch, you know?
You are sinew a hosher.
I don't see it.
Oh, it's there.
You're positive.
Oh, there it is.
It's got seven votes right under Duce by an angel.
Let's play that thing again.
Go for it.
Not.
WQAM, hello.
You know Roger?
Yes, sir.
I got something for you, Paul.
Yes?
I have $6 million woman.
That was a remake after $6 million man.
Yeah?
Remember that?
No, I never saw that.
It's called the Bionic woman, by the way.
The Bionic woman, right?
The Bionic woman.
I got another one for George.
Okay, good.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Are you doing that he-haw thing again?
That sounds...
It's infectious.
It's my impersonation of Weezy.
I see.
I thought she was on a Jefferson's.
Which we're not putting on there.
What's that?
The Jefferson's.
Oh, I was one of the best shows on TV.
Are you kidding me?
Man, oh man, but he-haw.
I mean, infectious.
Exactly.
Why not is doing it again?
WQAM, hello.
You know, did I hear you say there's a gun stroke on your list?
Yes, supposedly.
Oh, come on.
That's cutting edge.
Yeah, you're cutting edge.
You don't have the events in your life.
Yeah.
The events in your life that you'll never forget where you were.
Yes.
Like when JFK was shot, the Twin Towers attack, when Don Johnson called the Stan Major show,
when Paul Harvey Jr. made his last call to the New Roger show, right?
That's the popsicle twin came on the gun show.
Really?
Do you remember that?
I do.
That's what took the show off the air.
It's a matter of fact, they showed that when they had to check by-h-check various autobiography
thing, I mean, bio whatever was.
They showed it.
That would never get on the air today ever.
Right.
But anyway, I've got a show.
I can't believe nobody's called it.
It was really popular in Canada.
It's a British show.
And some of the first and ugly factors you've ever seen, Dr. Hoo.
Dr. Hoo?
Do you remember that?
Yes.
Was that not the worst show ever?
It was in the running.
I mean, they didn't take somebody like George and wrapped him in fabric.
I'm glad.
Have a good day.
The gum show was fun.
Let's face it.
And how come they had so many screeners on it, show?
Of course it was.
JP Morgan was a real bulldyke and then they had the ripped tailor.
Jamie Farr.
Jamie Farr, do you think is- I don't think he's wrong.
Oh, come on.
Jamie Farr is gay.
I have no idea.
War that dress on Nash.
Yeah, I'll let that prove it.
Somebody cue Am hello?
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Sent to see island.
Somebody beat you to it, man.
Oh, well, just remember George is gay.
Okay, thanks.
5670560, pound 560 on EATT.
Well, we always wanted to have a gay president.
I guess we got one.
WDQA and hello.
Hey, I'm good, Neil.
How you doing?
Yes, sir, all right.
Hey, I got it.
So, boy, you have a family matters in.
Do percol.
Okay, again, somebody, let's just- I'll figure what.
Call in and read a sum from the list.
We could just start the show back when we wanted to tape.
Right.
And start to show it.
I could read the facts again from JJ and Pembroke Pines.
Why is it called any?
I don't think.
Damn it.
I'm going to listen to that.
Carrie Grancho on IOD or whatever is.
How to listen to the light bulb and some of that financial advice.
Maybe listen to the Mitch Herscho.
370 votes.
The worst TV show of all time.
The Rick Sanchez show 85.
I'm just going to do the top few.
The contenders and the cool 58.
Dr. Phil 50, survivor 35.
Magic Johnson's chat show has 29.
In fact, I think that would be most appropriate.
Four minutes till noon at 560 WQM, the mad dog at 2,
the Humberit for this afternoon.
We got to find out about those posters at the ballgame.
I'm high and local.
This is 440560.
You way, you way.
This mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.
Back in the USSA.
Please, we got the book to film our SUV.
It's far from the two-wheelers of planes.
I play for oil, T2C, the back in the P.
And then the saw, the back of the mountain,
and way up back in the USSA.
You shut the mouth of the computer.
Back in the USSA.
Then the computer
Thoughts and DMs were sat next to me.
I want to build my base with my take-offs and meet.
And then I'm going to sit back down and back with you SSS.
You should come out and look for me.
Or back with you SSS.
You don't make the right track in this garden.
The garden.
You can see the garden.
I'm coming out from the garden.
I'm going to sit back.
I'm going to sit back.
I'm going to sit back.
Oooo.
Bravo to it.
560 WQM and the sun is shining here.
It's beautiful.
Case-canceling.
And once you know the Toronto weather.
Let me take a peek.
It's 48, but it's going to be 58.
Ain't that lovely?
I'll take it.
It's sunny and 58.
Nice little breeze.
Oh man.
Just a light jacket.
Perfect.
Anyway, here's the fact that it says...
...after a mash.
What does that mean?
That was a show.
That was the name of the show after a mash.
That idea.
After a mash?
Trust me.
Okay.
How about Monster Mash?
Here's one that says Davy and Goliath.
Sure.
I have no idea what was that.
Claymation Christian shelf.
I beg your pardon?
Claymation.
Christian shelf.
Oi!
Let's say here's one that says...
What's your opinion on Moe possibly redeeming himself?
Just an ounce.
This was his call on WQM's draft Nook Party show Saturday.
The dolphins have selected Vernon Carey from the University of Miami.
The crowd is screaming and jumping up and down here.
At Pro Player, it's like they were just told they can revote on the 2000 election.
It's incredible.
Not bad, it says, but still a weasel.
What's so great about that?
Like you almost made a political statement and that redeems him?
No!
Yes, why?
No, what's the name?
Ask Yaldi to redeem him?
No.
Still the same class hall as he always was.
Here's the fact that says last week you talked about that nut Tim La Hay,
who said that the anti-Christ will sit up his reign in Babylon,
which is present day Iraq,
is it possible that the Neocons are actually trying to help fulfill this prophecy?
Who knows when you deal with crazy people?
If so, they are following in the footsteps of many and Megalomaniac dictator in history.
Constantine also thought his military conquest and subsequent reign was destined by God
and his kingdom was the predecessor of the kingdom of Christ as prophesied.
Ironically, Tim La Hay was right about the anti-Christ,
isn't he, Colors Netwaters also in Babylon?
There's a website called Yadi-adi-adi and so on.
Thanks wherever you are.
After Mesh,
boy, thank goodness I missed that and David and Goliath.
I feel like I've done something right.
I'm going to get paid a lot of the of, you know, the Minestars like Jamie Farron,
Gary Burghaw.
Gary what?
Burghaw.
Can't say that, no more.
He was on, for some reason, he was on a match game a lot.
Yeah, for some reason.
Gary Burghaw.
And also, Richard, what we don't talk about, Richard.
Yeah, the woodcutter.
Yeah, the woodcutter.
Yes, Gary Burghaw.
Well, I'll be damned.
No wonder they kept his one hand in the match.
I always kept one hand in his pocket or behind the clipboard.
I see.
5670560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
The worst TV show of all time is the Rick Sanchez show has got about a 30.
How many?
About 30, man.
29 vote lead over.
And in the cool show, she's right on his ass.
And in the cool, it's right on Ricky Tickey's ass.
WQM, hello.
WQM, hello.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Is it still?
It sounds like me, yes.
How you doing, Uncle Neil?
I'm doing great.
You're not going to believe this, man.
I don't believe it.
I got a pre-sector signal on 75 right out of Naples.
So no one's taking, can you still say that?
No one's taking her in with her station today?
No one's with it, yeah.
That's it.
So any harmony, no man's land, the alligator rally,
I just wanted to call say hi and talk in a long time.
What if I took Tampa Bay Lightning to kick in the, you know,
what out of Ontario, huh?
Out of Ontario, why not?
I've been in our area out of Quebec, man.
Go back there.
Get it right.
We got our own problems with Phil Sinalt-Few, man.
I like the Lightning.
I think the Lightning could win the cup this year.
I really mean that.
I like that you had a heartless thing, yeah.
Well, you know hockey more than me.
That's for sure.
I remember my geography.
They're fabulous.
Yeah, that was a great day, all right?
And back to you.
Yeah, bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Let's see, friends, never funny.
In fact, moving to South Florida was even better
since this fact.
So you're okay, Mike.
And it says it all.
Even moving to South Florida was funnier than friends.
Another one of those state-of-mind things, kind of like cheese.
Cheese.
Time jicka-like cheese.
Wow.
No, well, what?
I hope we knock on our good bald-headed little buddy, Tom Jicke.
I want to say we two years he bright something that makes sense.
At least he wrote several articles about all this crap
that's going on in broadcasting now, which is more than I can say
for Glenn Garntzee.
I mean, Glenn Garvin over there at the Miami Herald.
Oh, can I come in and sing it on the show one day?
Yeah.
That'll be his excuse.
Well, you guys never called me back.
Call him up and tell me he's a classhole, okay?
Glenn Garvin.
Here we got the most unbelievable series of finds and censorship
and all this crap going on is the freedom.
See, it's just like this March, you had it washed in over the weekend.
Women want to make their own choices, just like listeners want to make their own choices.
People to read books and magazines and newspapers want to make their own choices.
What a concept.
That's what it used to mean to be free.
Not no more.
And yet 50% of the public, I got to do this one again.
This time, I mentioned it earlier, but this just, it just grinds my fat old pimpley ass.
A new pool shows that 57% of Americans continue to believe that Sodom Hussein gave some
stencil support to Al Qaeda terrorists before the war with Iraq, the Sputelack of any evidence of that relationship.
In addition, if that isn't depressing enough, 45% of Americans have the impression that clear evidence was found
that Iraq were closely with those some of Inlavins network, and a majority believed that before the war, Iraq either had weapons of mass destruction
or a major program for developing them.
There is no known evidence today that these statements are true.
Oh, God.
For example, among those who say most experts agree that Iraq had banned weapons, 72% plan to vote for Bush.
So I guess you know, likes to track because he's a moron than the rest of the people who want to vote for him are.
Moron.
Right.
Which makes sense to me.
In the pool taken by the University of Maryland's program in international policy attitudes, roughly 4 in 10 Americans perceived the
administration as saying it had clear evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction just before the war.
Maybe they just disappeared.
Maybe that magic wand thing that sound you got there.
Yeah, just like that.
Well, they disappeared.
Sodom waived his magic wand.
Too bad for him.
He couldn't waived his magic wand.
He could have disappeared.
It didn't work.
If his magic wand was working so good.
Not just nauseating.
And like the guy said before, where is the American public?
Where the people getting their information?
Where they getting their news?
Where they getting their facts?
What the hell are they reading?
Who's reading it to them besides me?
And I'm a apologize for reading any of these stories on here.
In fact, George was right about that.
Gotta be right about something sooner or later.
Eventually.
Like a clock.
Right.
Like a one on the wall there, that thing.
5, 6, 7.
Let's just lighten it up a little bit.
I want to get all bent out of shape and pissed off again.
I want to let you get JJ Alps and Pimberpines.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.
I mean, if you watch, like I said last week, you watch BBC.
And then you watch BBC.
And then you turn over to any of the American networks.
And you wonder what world are these people talking about?
It's so great.
How do you like that?
That's the BBC.
I don't know what the hell he just said.
I think he said.
Yeah, you better watch it.
Don't that.
I think so.
He has a gain.
It could be tight and be really difficult to cure.
It wasn't a research centre.
Simulated this one, but a young woman was infected with the deadly disease.
International officials say it's clear mistakes were made.
Those safety checks are now being conducted.
We are concerned that it has taken a long time.
Did they put real news on there on a BBC and on the BBC there?
And there are no puff pieces.
If you watch CNN, 80% of what they show are puff pieces, 15% are lies.
The rest of it is just a bunch of crap.
But anyway, that's what you got.
WDQA, hello.
Yeah, like the talk of Neil.
Speaking.
Neil, hey, how you doing?
Sensational.
If it's that bad in this country, then leave.
Yeah.
Okay.
If it's that bad, then leave.
I believe that, you know what?
No matter how you feel about the war in Iraq, you still have to support our president and our boys over there.
I see.
So in other words, when Lyndon Johnson lied to the American public about Vietnam, we had to support our president.
You're a quizzling man.
You're a simpleton, okay?
You're a moron.
You're an idiot.
You're a moron.
No matter how you feel, you have to support our president.
What kind of a simpleton was that?
Now, what kind of a rock that he crawled out from under?
What kind of a rock?
If we weren't for people protesting all throughout history, governments would have done, gathering those one more kind of crap.
Not to mention the crap they already got away with.
Just like the Germans were just following orders.
And just quizzlings like you, man, are responsible for most of the slaughter that's taken place throughout recorded history, including what's going on right now.
How could anybody support this madness, this lunacy?
So basically, what he's saying, even though we know they lied through their teeth, it was made up a whole bunch of crap to justify this, we still have to support our president.
You're like a little child, man.
You're like a little simpleton.
Like about a five-year-old.
And my apologies to every five-year-old out there who certainly got you under the table.
And I'll tell him what to do with you.
Man.
What a...no matter what it is, we've got to support our president.
And see that the people like the bush crowd, the neocons, they always try to lump the...
Oh, we've got to support our president and the troops as if...
As if those people are protesting against the war, don't support the troops.
Guess what?
The troops don't support the president.
Guess what? We're not the ones.
Those of us who oppose the war that sent them over there to be slaughtered, which is going on every day, including five more today.
Every single day there is blood on your hands.
Simpletons like you, sir, there's blood gushing from every finger, from every pore on your hands.
Go try to wash it off, man.
Take every detergent, take air, take tide, take a SOS badge, and you still can scrub off the blood from your bloody hands.
You bloody idiot.
Anyway, like I said, let's keep it light.
All right.

Back in the day when someone done us wrong, we didn't take their crap.
In Pearl Harbor, when the jacks dropped their bonds, we bombed them back.
And now the Saudis, they hit us hard.
And on our cards, our little flags wave.
As that sunny, loving, retired voice of bombers, the wrong way.
And oven barrows to be in America, where they follow those like she.
The United States of America, and by push and its family, we they got this country.
Family, course, the darkest days in my history.

Tom and Kendall's got a good point.
The worst show ever was Nightrotters starring David Hasselhoff.
Absolutely correct sir.
I don't know if that's a worse, but if it's their God, David Hasselhoff, it's gotta be right in there.
That was the one with the car.
The gay car.
The gay car?
Yeah.
The car was gay.
It was gay.
Quite.
You don't say.
I do.
Here's one that says, had rather eat worms and hanged by my testicles and watched this doodoo fear factor.
Another one.
Another real piece of turd.
You have a naked segment I'd like to see more of.
I missed the episode.
Fear factor deserves to be on there.
People eating worms.
People dehumanizing themselves, degrading themselves.
Just like they got a code here a minute ago.
People showing their ass to the universe.

The worst TV show all time Rick sent you show 101 and in a Colesho 68, Dr. Phil 55, Survivor 41, Magic Johnson's chat show 34, Rosio Donald's Code 26.
We do have a lot of breads to listen.
You know, so they must have a good sense of humor.
They understand what I'm talking about.
They know exactly.
In fact, if they were so obsessed with all the British stuff and the world family all that crap, the Baton Birds, they'd still be over there.
They'd still be drinking all that crap.
I can't say it.
No, you can't.
You know, you know, you I am.
Hello.
And Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about the, I don't know if you heard of this show, but there's a show on ESPN 2 called called Pizza.

Pat Boone stands up for censorship.
This article is on our website today.
Be sure and click on where it says link to original article from the drudge retort.
That's with two T's.
We can't say two T's.
No.
Two.
Well, can't even say Mr.
Clean Living 1950's crooner Pat Boone is on a crusade to clean up Hollywood.
I don't think censorship is a bad word, but it's become a bad word because everybody associates it with some kind of restriction on liberty.
Boone told a group of reporters at the right wing Washington Times owned by the obnoxious Reverend Son Young Boone.
Boone is in town lobbying, meaning in LA, for the 60 plus association, they senior citizens group trying to repeal the inheritance stack.
But he's more jazzed about the filth.
Censorship is healthy for any society and that goes for arts, entertainment, anything said Boone, at some point in line that has to be drawn between one man's liberty and another man's license.
By Boone standards, the US governments become more healthy since Janet Jackson flies to write press for a nanosecond during the Super Bowl.
An FCC cracked down on the Indies and Broadcast, and then at a $495,000 fine for the Howard Stern Show, Stern shows no discipline, no selfish-drained-all Boone-Tool journalist.
Interestingly enough, Boone could give Janet Jackson a pointer about how to expose an organ and then on the next page, which you'll see, there is that picture from back in 1984.
The old Boone in the box from Hustle magazine.
It says this look what I found photograph has been floating around for years on, used net, the online network of discussion groups that even turned up on a Frank Zappern produced pictorial in Hustle magazine in 1984.
Someone had a photo right, found a photo right and sold it to Larry Flint, Hustle's publisher, Quintet One Performer, since he couldn't use it anywhere else. He used it here, as you might expect Flynn had a field day with this one, a field day.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't know. He doesn't know what the name was. Emerald Legassi, man, oh, she and I can't play those drops anymore. No. Can't play the sounds that go along with him or we can't do anything in this class is love and relieve it and you have to back our president about what kind of a, seriously, what kind of a durable crawl up inside of his body, huh? Man, what a lunatic that had to be a put on. Didn't that didn't have to be a just a bed. I can't believe anybody could possibly be that stupid that much of a quizzling just to get you whipped up.
They worked good. That's good. I make no apologies for bush bashing because I intend to do plenty of it between now and the election man. Somebody's got to. When Jackson showed up late for his hearing because of all the chaos outside. Oh, yeah, they're planning for Friday. You know, when he's going to be, they have the thing. What do they call it? Grandstand. No, no, they're planning another. They're going to bust people in. Bust loads of people for another big. Dog and pony show, right?
I think you're pardoned. Bush loads. W Q a M. Hello, HR puff and stuff. W Q a M. Hello. Okay, somebody beat you. That was a run with the H and R puff and stuff. Yeah, it was right. Well, but he actually said something almost go here. All those. It's your buddy. Yeah, come on. W Q a M. Hello. Love to meet you. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Have you read big lines by Joe Connison? No, by.
Got in the other room as a matter of fact. Oh, man, it is. I got a whole bunch of books lined up. I got to read. I stopped. It's full of great. Just all the Republican wing. Yeah, see, there's no point in my reading any of this stuff because I was thinking about this last night. I've read all of these things. They all say this. I mean, I know it. What I don't need to keep reinforcing it. I know what the problem is. The public doesn't want to know it. One more thing. Here's a contribution for you. Word that you may be able to get away with. Too bad.

W.W.M. here's Jack Faxes-Mean says, book you want to recommend,
Roe State American War with the World by TD Alman.
I wonder if he's skinned to Greg Alman.
Mr. Alman gives an detailed description of the players'
interactions, which have led the U.S. to this genocide in Iraq.
I'm certainly going to find extremely informative read.
By the way, did you see the AFP photo from Iraq
with the U.S. Order of Searching a three or four year
old little girl with today's hero?
If that photo doesn't say what F.A.G. insanity this is,
then I don't know what.
What does? Well, how about the fact that all these
little children got shot at and killed?
That story that you mentioned earlier,
I heard a different version over the weekend on the news.
Yes.
The roadside bomb blew up the Humvee.
Children came out to jump up and down on the Humvee
when the Army showed up, they opened fire on the children
that were stomping on the Humvee.
The Humvee. Right.
And killed four of them like you. Yes.
How's that different from the story I had?
Oh, nothing. Just that detail.
I see.
Why do you know when things happen?
I'm going to take everybody out.
When did Doc take those little kids out?
Let me say it again.
There isn't one person who has been killed,
named wounded over there, who would be killed,
named or wounded, except for this insanity.
It wasn't paradise, but it was, you know,
we said we propped them up in there and they were doing
the best they could of all the Arab countries.
They were living the, they had the greatest equality
between men and women. Right.
High standard living.
Decent economy.
Well, there you go.
But no, and now we're going to,
we're going to force democracy down your throats
whether you want it or not.
As if we are.
No, not too good of a job.
Now, speaking of democracy or what
are used to be schools rated by FBI and powering crackdown.
This is from the Arizona Republic.
Federal agents and Phoenix and elsewhere in the country
rated schools and other targets in a national crackdown
on pirated music CDs and movies.
You ready for that?
Agents poured through data and records
at a computer command center for the dear Valley School District
of the Northwest Valley.
This is in Arizona, Phoenix and blocked the office
from the public.
It was among other places in Arizona and quite a few other states
where sealed search warrants were served the FBI be saying.
The raids came on the same day that the justice
from officials in Washington announced the creation
of a new intellectual property task force
to step up copyright enforcement.
The intellectual property task force.
Some of the stolen copyrighted material being sought
in the raids is suspected this haven't been distributed
from overseas sources.
The raids are reflective of a new effort by the Justice Department
to treat copyright enforcement as a higher priority,
something that motion picture music industry officials have
been urging.
FBI agents rated the dear Valley District
Administration Services Center just
south of dear Valley High School in Glendale
about six a.m. and stayed most of the day.
The site houses the district's information services
and technology offices, essentially the brains
of the district's computer system,
said Timothy,
Tate district spokesman school officials were not
warned advance in the district's top officials,
including superintendent Virginia McEl Yee,
learned of the search warrant only when computers went down.
Classes were not disrupted,
but computer use in the district office was limited
with no internet access or email.
We were very much in the dark, Tate said.
FBI spokesman Paul Breson wouldn't come in
and why the federal government was searching a school district
system and he wouldn't identify the other sites in Arizona
or elsewhere that were served with the warrants.
Breson refused to comment on the rates
of dear Valley facility elsewhere
and he wouldn't say how targets were identified,
noting the search warrant was under court seal.
Last year, a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing
on the link between International Copyright Parliacy
and Organized Crime and the FBI has said there's strong evidence
that organized crime groups have moved into
intellectual property crime using the profit
to pay for other activities.
On Wednesday in Washington, David Israelite,
Chairman of the Justice Department's intellectual property
task force announced the names of people who would serve
with them on a new task force created by Attorney General John
Ascroft, the task force will examine how the department
of justice handles intellectual property issues
and develop recommendations to future efforts,
the group expects to issue a report recommendations
to Ascroft by the end of the year.
I think the report's gonna say just not take doors down
and confiscate anything you want.
Books, computer records, all of these things.
You know what I'm saying?
All of these things, right.
Magazines, newspaper articles,
periodicals, et cetera.
Forland paper, stuff where graffiti written
on the tea room walls, all of these things.
I just mentioned that in passing
as the South of those boot sets keeps getting louder
and louder, love it or leave it baby.

It came right back on.
Worst TV show of all time is your choice.
WQA and hello.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
Great.
I'm still fuming over that guy that just called you.
I think part of the country is the Terry Springer mentality.
And to answer, when Neil, no, George said,
most of the men don't wanna be there.
On Dan Ruther, two weeks ago,
they interviewed a gentleman as white.
He's been in Iraq for a year.
And he said that the president needed to answer
to all the soldiers that are there.
He's a West Point graduate,
and he lost three of his best friends.
And they asked him, I guess it's time the service is up
and he said, what are you gonna do now?
And he said, I'm gonna call the carry campaign
and see if I can not campaign for carry.
So, you know, it's even Chris Matthews said last week
when the conference, they showed the two people
that were fired.
And he said, how can these people be fired?
And the people who took us into war aren't fired.
I mean, you know, people, I don't know.
And now they're attacking carry on his war record.
You got an AWOL president, you got a vice president
who got a deferment never served one minute.
That's right.
That's right.
It's just unbelievable.
But, you know, I listen to you every day, I've read every book,
and again, I just feel that it's the people
who have no clue, no clue, they don't read,
they don't listen to what they're doing.
They're hopeless.
They're hopeless.
That's why I always feel I'm preaching to the choir.
No, you're not.
If it hadn't been for you, I would never
started reading two years ago.
And you just have to keep on.
And people are coming around, believe me, they are.
Slowly but surely.
Well, we've got a few months, we still got time.
Thank you so much.
Have a great day, thanks.
Bye-bye.

I love it or leave it.
You got to support our president.
No, we don't.
That's why we got an election.
OK, see, in a dictatorship, you don't have any choice
like in Cuba.
Right.
You have no choice.
And by the way, speaking of democratic elections,
they're not going to have any democratic elections in Iraq.
I'd like to point that out to you.
The US and the US are going to decide who the ruling parties
are going to be.
And they're all going to be related to Ahmed Chalabi
and all his other family of gangsters.
That's what we're going to be putting in there.
But anyway, just drop that in.

one nineteen at q.a.m here's the facts from alan says if you're not using
survivors of catch-off for all bad reality shows which we're not
i'd like to nominate big brother for your pool it originated in europe i
holland in holland i think he says that's right
and so the highlight there was always to see people having sex so it was very
popular in holland germany england et cetera but of course the fcc
mixes that over here and you're left all all your left with is a boring show
people just sitting around being boring without anything actual boring going on
survivors popular here because you can show people being the seatful and
manipulative in the name of pure greed it's the american effing way
survivor was a bust in europe because you can't sell a show just because it
has nudity and it's no big deal so i'm a big brother good story big brother

he looks like hell

well fine okay he never stole a freight train and he was courageous in this and that in fact
they they had a thing on this morning somebody emailed to um the morning show on CNN
that after watching all this feeding frenzio we can long now they understand that when he made
his decision to go join the military and leave the NFL that's why he refused to talk to the media
