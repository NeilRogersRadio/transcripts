Going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico
We're gonna California and Texas and New York. We're gonna South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan
And then we're gonna watch it in DC to take back the White House
Oh, oh, oh
I showed her right melon and man was it great
Had an area like a big dinner plate
Janet's right top breath every headline
Wonder if she'll help CBS pay to fly
First she denied it said it wasn't mistake
A costume malfunction said Justin Timberwake
Now they've admitted they flashed for the tool
It'll be the Super Bowl remembered for the moon
The FCC says it was in decent scene
Some pornography, big Yip, one lip
I'll never forget that infamous tongue
I'll remember his game for seeing Janet's jug
1002 at 560 WQM when I hear that Willie Williams is gonna be he could turn out to be one of the great Americans of all time
I have to look with a jaundice view upon that you know what?
Oh, you're just bigoted that's what it is
That's correct after raise all three eyebrows when I hear that
That was really special thanks a lot Joe Rose old blockhead forget that in there
Even though we're pissed off at NBC6 for screwing over Bob Weaver
That really pisses me off big time
Oh, speaking of guys that got screwed over but keep bouncing back Joe Angel remember Joe of course
Right
Who team would John Miller and the Orioles radio booth from 1988 to 1982
Joe Angel returning to the team as its lead play by play announcer on Fagship Station WBAL
That's where rumor used to work your close friend
By the way rumors in town are you going lunch today?
No
WBAL announced yesterday on its website
Orioles spokesman Bill Stetka confirmed angels hiring that said the team was surprised by the timing of BAL's announcement
And that the rest of the world's radio and TV broadcast teams remain undecided
So in other words it's like oh we hired Joe so some of you guys are going to get fired
According to the radio stations website radio announcers Jim Hunter and Fred Manfra will split time between TV and radio broadcast
So Joe Angel good guy comes down with his feet on the ground
Put it in a wind column for Joe Angel okay
All right good guy that's screwed over by the John Henry Marlon organization
John Henry was the anti-Christ
So what about Willie Williams huh?
It's got nothing to do with the poll we're going to take but boy this radio station is obsessed
I'll tell you who really pisses me off who's also in the news speaking of scumbag jacks
Is Jason Williams?
Yeah is it like a Williams thing?
Apparently the Williams brothers
Is that what it is all the Williams people? I mean come up with somebody else named Williams
Williams who's a pretty good guy? Huh?
The Williams brothers are good guys not the Williams brothers though
I mean what is it a name that maybe there's a person at name?
What's in a name?
What about the hardest driver?
Lil Williams he was blind on his dead
And he had a little bit of a nose problem
And anyway this thing with Jason Williams killing that dog
Now I must have been either in Europe on vacation or hiding under a rock somewhere
I never heard that thing about that thing about him killing his dog
You good?
I know
What about Josh did you hear that?
No I didn't
Anyway jurors are going to hear two versions of how a limo driver was killed in Jason Williams bedroom
And opening statements are made in the former NBI stars Manslota trial today
I don't want to go through the whole thing I'll save that for later
But 18 pool members who joined the pool early in the process
Had to be interviewed about some broadcast that took place after they were qualified
The judge then began questioning them individually as they tried to put together a jury
One female member of the pool was excused when she said a friend had told her stories last week
That said Williams had killed his pet rot wiler with a shotgun
If you're losing a bed involving the dog if that's true now maybe somebody will call in and inform us
Because we're not into that whole sports thing quite as much as anybody else on his radio station
Thank God
But if that's true man I say fry his ass right now because Jason Williams you make me sick
You make me want a barf
Okay?
Any asshole and I don't care whether he's white, black, yellow, purple
Pink with the yellow polka dots that would shoot and kill his pet dog on a bed
Is some kind of a lunatic needs to be put away for a long time? Okay?
Fry his ass now
WDQM Jason Williams line
Hello? Yes sir
Yeah, how you doing? I heard the story of this one
Is that a true story?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, let's just read what happened was the guy who was at his house made a bed with him
That he couldn't drag the rat while he's out of his house without that dog like biting him or something
Yeah
So what happened was the guy pulled the dog out of the leg and dragged him out
Jason Williams supposedly went upstairs and the guy thought he was getting the money for him to pay him
He said, is that a $100?
Mm-hmm
And then he took his shotgun and shot the dog in the side and then in the head
I say fry his ass right now don't you agree?
I agree I mean if you're going to kill a dog for like any reason
Then you're certainly going to kill a limo driver
For sure
Thanks a lot, Pally, have a great day
That just makes I want to quit right now, I want to just walk out on the edge of my balcony
Take a long look down and think about it very seriously
I just can't deal with this crap
And this radio station where we got a bunch of assholes like Yelda, you know I have to agree with Mo
But once in my life, you know that takes a lot of pain to be greatly
Because I come in here 7-15 this morning like I do every morning
I open up the pot and I smoke a little bit of it
And I heard Mo go on and about
And Gildey's ripping him and asked about, well you just come on and give him a chance
And you're right in some asshole collar, chronic voice
Calling him in ripping Mo because he doesn't want to give away the Williams and other chance
How many chances does he need?
3rd man
Huh?
I'm sick and tired of scumbags
You know how about Lawrence Phillips?
Let's bring him back in
You know it's not too late for him to go back to school
He could learn a lot
Because he's probably got an IQ
He's probably as smart as a boxer rocks as Mad Dog would say
By the way, don't forget no Mad Dog today we got the Willie Williams show at 2
And then we got the Jason Williams show at 4
Man, when are you people going to get with it?
You sports sucking nerds
I can't stand it, it makes me puke
WQM Jason Williams line, hello
Good afternoon
Good evening
It's Greg and Charles
WQM, hello
Yes, I did hear something about that Jason Williams with the dog
What did you hear?
Apparently it was with one of his friends at this big mansion house if you've ever seen pictures of that house that we have
It's huge yes
And the friend said I could make the dog either come or to come in the house or something, some sort of trick or something
And the guy actually had done it and they bet $100 on it
And Williams said after that he shot the dog, he was going to shoot the dog because he was going to have to pay the guy $100
Because the dog did what the guy said
Can you even begin to understand that to relate to that?
No, but you can't relate to how much money that Jason Williams makes for being a basketball player, Neil
For being a scumbag
Okay pal, thanks for the bad news
I'm going to
I just, it takes an awful lot to make me speechless
Yeah, somehow I missed this I don't know why I don't pay too much attention to that crack because there's so many scumbag
Jocks pressed and present that it's hard to keep track, you know
But plus of course I don't follow the NBA anyway because it's basically just a bunch of seven foot freaks
Are you saying you need a scorecard to keep track of the scumbags?
That's what we're going to need the QAM scumbag in fact there you go Josh something that might get some people looking at
The QAM scumbag scorecard on the QA website
That'll take you a few months, some take you weeks
A third man
Take a pile at least
We can have their criminal statistics on there
Right
And of course all this business about what you know you and Larry Coker and they they've tried to put that patent in their past and they're behind
Well that's fine
That's great, more power to him for that but don't start all over again trying to rehab gangsters
People that are chronic offenders, scumbags
See this is one of the biggest problems in America is making excuses for people whose behavior is so aberrant and so unacceptable
And the fact that anybody can even relate to the idea that this guy lost a bet
A guy who's a multi multi multi multi millionaire who's making just gigantic amounts of cash for being a seven foot freak that plays basketball
And shoots and kills his dog because he lost a bet
And of course he'll probably turn out to be a really great American someday
That's right, we just leave him alone long enough
Just give him a chance
No
And another
I say fry his ass in fact
Let's take Lawrence Phillips and Jason Williams and put him side by each and a twin whore
Okay, I'll pull this way
Don't forget Willie
Now Willie didn't kill any dog, he didn't kill any, I mean he's you know we've got some problems
I don't put him in the same category yet
Yeah
Yeah
There's a group in it
But guess what, Gelti?
I told, I told Muff this morning I said you know Gelti really should have been a fang
He said what do you mean by that?
I said because I don't know anybody who sucks more or better than Gelti
He is the biggest suckle I have ever heard in my life
No matter what it is, whether it's the Panther organization which of course he's under payroll so naturally he sucks up to them
No matter what it is in the area of sports
He will suck up to the unsuckable
I mean there's just nothing to suck up there
There's a whole Willie Williams thing unless you're going to make into a racial thing which I know what some of the call is of course are
But there's nothing there to suck
It's kind of like just in Timberlake, Gelti, there's nothing there to suck
Right
But man you talk about a master, master suckle, this Gelti, Jesus, God Almighty
Just when we thought that we knew something about him
And even what he says
I like dick a lot
Yeah, well we know that
And he also says once in a while
Up to bite
Well, he makes me nauseous
I'm starting to favor Mo on that show
And I know that I feel I'm clean that I said that
I'm going to get my lice all spray out again and spray my throat
But I just feel nauseous from this suck it up
See how at what point do you, if you want to be like civilized people
They're all worried about Janet Jackson's booby being on there for a second and a half
This is the big controversy in America
And yet it's like, oh well, if you can throw it a ball or stick the ball in a hoop or hit the ball
And then no matter what you do in some kind of a stupid ass game
No matter what you are in your life, they make no difference
We don't care
Right
We'll give you 100 chances to it, whatever it takes, 200 chances
If you can win us some games and make us feel better about ourselves
Like if that's what it's all about
Only game matters
The game matter?
It's game matter, you ought to know
I know all about game matter, that's what Reverend Jones said

prosecutions bid on wednesday to have testimony about williams prior to
discretion with firearms admitted during this trial

testimony about an incident
in which william shot his pet rodwilor Zeus after losing a bet with former
teammate dwayne chinsius
chinsius bet williams a hundred bucks that chinsius could drag the attack
train dog outside of williams home when chinsius was successful william said he
would get the money and left the room he returned with a shotgun which he used
to kill the dog williams ordered chinsius to barberry the animal and left
when williams returned to find the carcass still on his porch he reloaded the
shotgun pointed at chinsius and said
shin bone get this effing dog off my porch or your next
uh... they also sought him to this testimony about a nineteen ninety four
incident when williams fired his forty five caliber handgun into a park
security vehicle outside the middleland sports complex
on monday juror said they had noticed headlines about the dog shooting story heard
about it on the radio been told about a bike homework as one man said he was
simply recycling his newspapers when he saw the story on the front page of
the newspaper well how come we haven't seen this or nobody's talking about it

people down i'd like to see you i have a car i'd like to be able to like remote control my
corvette so we're like to run down jason Williams i have a list man anybody that misses with a dog and
it's it but it's just his all the whole thing about him what a oh and you dark folks out there
why do how do you and again i'm only talking about some of you but why do you make excuses for
people like that huh man you talk about creating uh obnoxious racial stereotypes between oh j and
jason Williams we got some fine uh you know who i really like a lot a lot of course he

ever seen him on the talking hit shows that that i recall he's fabulous he's articular he's
great he's a brilliant young guy he's probably too young but he's he's a light black you know in fact
even their republicans would know the difference he's a great people more like him be more like julienne
bond okay lighten up a little bit instead of making excuses for these scumbags these no count pieces
of garbage i wouldn't give you 50 cents out of them twenty before eleven at five sixty wqm i'll
tell you one thing i'd get more than 50 cents to write concepts because they are the best not a
hell of a lot more though because they never overcharged they never rape their customers that's
right unlike the other carpet cleaning uh... joints that always give you a stack on to the end of
the job dot concepts eliminate that right off the back because they give you a written guaranteed
price right up front before they start doing their unbeatable job of making your carpets look just
like brand new they drive in your carpets which means they suck out the dirt way down there deep
in the fibers of your carpet they leave them looking just like brand new smelling lemonade first
they grind a couple of hours and you look around and say holy crap it looks like i just had brand new
lead right on my floor they also do an unbeatable job with your uh... area rugs with your
a poll street with your draper all of these things
and if you want to save even more money when you call dry concepts asking to put you
understand by list which can save an extra fifteen percent i'm your next carpet cleaning
this called as toll free number believe you me like i always tell you uh... use these people once
you never dream of calling anybody else again i've been using my homestero for twenty years
call toll free one eight hundred two four eight five oh seven one that's one eight hundred two four
eight five oh seven one and by the way what was wrong with that picture of the pirates on

for you this uh it goes to show you once you croak then they start picking on you so no croak
report die doctor atkins was obese then this just crossed my ass now maybe he was obese when
he croaked okay me that's why he tripped and fell because fat people like me would have a
habit of tripping phone because we're like fluts but we did that appearance with dr bob way back
how many years ago would you say that was uh about thirty man now i would say like six and seven
there about it but what we were at i.o.d right yes so i'd say like eight or nine years ago
we did the thing at the saw grass at the bookstore there books a million whatever then
thousand and he he didn't he wasn't fat at all no he wasn't plus he introduced his uh this whole
thing in his this um atkins that back in the seventies the first time and he sure as
how it wasn't fat then so the fact that he was fat when he croaked i mean uh what what is that
supposed to prove and he had heart problems and he this and that man it's just it's so sad
maybe this is to try to counterbalance this propaganda from some of the people are
peddling some of the other stuff because they want to counterbalance the popularity the low
credit people it's the bread conspiracy it's the bread and the pasta crowd man they're going back
and he didn't know crap go out there and he wonder bread it'll kill you in seven different ways

also contribute to which is what he had they discussed this before he croaked
store traeger chairman of the acnes physicians counsel in new york
told the journal that the atkins heart disease stem from cardiomyopathy condition
talked to result from a viral infection atkins weight was due to bloating associated with this
condition and he had been much slimmer during most of his life traeger said say so there's the

eight well before we are go on uh New York Daily News today says W's guard files MIA there is a
hole in service exit despite president pushes stated willingness to make his international
guard records public the agency in charge of the paperwork box yesterday saying it doesn't have
his permission in writing and the White House said it doesn't have any records to release
Bush made the statement Sunday on eat the press in an effort to win speculation over democratic
accusations that he was a wall from his international guard unit in 1972 and by the way he lied
he said that he got permission to leave eight months early so it could go to Harvard law school
guess what he didn't go tell a year later those eight months he was busy campaigning for some
Republican in the south didn't go to law school to the year later to Harvard uh anyway when asked
if he would release paystubs tax records anything to show that you were serving during that period
Bush responded yeah if we still have them White House spokesman Scott McCullough and said yesterday
afternoon that there were no paystubs of tax returns to make available I think the president like most
Americans doesn't have his tax returns from 33 years ago McCullough and said in terms of paystubs
during the 2000 campaign we checked with the Texas National Guard and they informed us they didn't
have him McCullough and said he said we made everything we had available during the 2000 campaign
the headquarters of the Air Reserve personnel center in Denver last night was compiling an updated
review of Bush's service but spokeswoman Cindy Dewey cautioned that the record would be incomplete
she said Dewey still beats Truman we don't have anything in writing from Dewey said until we do
releasing the information subject to the Freedom of Information Act meaning that medical and
personal administrative material would be deleted the White House last night couldn't say when
the written permission was going to be provided oh oh this thing's going to blow up in his push you'll see
Democratic National Committee spokesman Tony Welch charge that the gaping hold in the president
services still there he hasn't done anything to clear that up a senior GOP political strategist
agreed that Bush didn't put that one to bed with his performance on eat the press military
law expert Eugene Fidel said the DNC chairman was over the top in charging that Bush was AWOL from
his Alabama Guard unit as member of the National Guard Bush had most could have been subject to a
charge of unsatisfactory performance by the L said of course what he's failing to see is that
somebody was pulling the strings behind a scene which is what got him in the garden the first
place because daddy got him in there pulling the strings behind the scenes okay here we go and

for the jason widium's trial jurors will hear two versions of how a limo driver was killed
when opening statements are made in the former NBA stars manslaughter trial in summerville new jersey
prosecutors maintain that while widium's didn't intend to kill costas gusts christophe
he acted with reckless indifference when he took a shotgun from a cabinet in the back
lot of shotguns in a house you know it does it everybody and opened it and closed it in one
motion it fired and hit christophe was about three feet away he opened a cabinet like
but i think Williams has been free on bail of course and his defense team have portrayed the
shooting at the forty-room mansion as accident the defense is indicated a lot of time to show
Williams was in shock right prosecutor said that immediately after the shooting Williams wiped
the gun trying to put the victims hand or fingerprints on it he then removed this clothing jumped
into a pool downstairs put on new clothing he told guest they must agree the shooting was a
suicide and helped police did all been downstairs that sounds like something innocent guy would do
and of course told all the guest they must agree the shooting was a suicide and tell police did
all been downstairs and then it goes on about he faces a seven charges including aggravated
manslaughter witness tampering charges that could carry up to fifty five years in prison
all right by his ass now not for the liberal driver but for the dog god that's the way about
shooting the dog is just it's just all the eating i mean what what kind of a scene person somebody
that's like walking around on the outside what kind of a sane person who doesn't play in the NBA
is allowed to do that anybody we know no no but not if you're a jack not if you're studying jack
five six seven all look at this oh no it just keeps getting worse than it just have to return

friendly let me get a little hug no yeah yeah today's newest charging document says Williams did
willfully and maliciously injured destroy remove or in any manner interfere with the use of tools
equipment or other instruments used in the detection reporting suppression or extinguishment of

well i could look i don't have to guess jalo 26 of these they were married for about a few seconds
about third man yeah she's always always merriine he's a fag i mean he's a funny strange guy
the white house facing election year questions about president bush's military services
releasing pay records other information intended to support his assertion intended to support
his assertion that he fulfilled his duties a member of the air national guard during the Vietnam
do we believe it no will approve anything no the material to be released today
was to include pay records in annual retirement point summaries to show that bush served
the turkey to the troops these records clearly document that the president fulfilled his duty
white house shield scot McClellan said the point summaries were released during the 2000
presidential campaign but the pay records were not obtained by the white house to late yesterday
from the air reserve personnel center in dendard he said the center apparently acting on its own
reviewed bush's record and came up with the pay information it was our impression from the
Texas air national guard they stated they didn't have them he said it was also our impression these
records didn't exist bush on sunday authorize the release of his guard records McClellan said the
latest material apparently is all of bush's records the pay information documented the dates when
bush showed up for guard duty this spokesman said you are paid for the dates you serve McClellan added
right bush's military record was raised as an issue in the 2000 campaign what we know all about that
yon yon yon yon yon of central issue is whether bush showed up for duty while assigned to guard
units in alabama where he worked on a political campaign in 72 there may be no evidence but I
did report bush told NBC's eat the press on sunday otherwise I wouldn't have been honorably
discharged unless of course somebody was pulling the strings behind the scenes oops another
question is why he was allowed to end guard duty about six months early to attend Harvard
business school bush at NBC and worked it out with the military and I'm just telling you that I
did my duty the only problem being like I told you before he didn't attend Harvard military school
a business school at that time until a year later right look it up look it in a read shrub by Molly
Ivans McClellan said the White House would release statements previously distributed from Albert
Lloyd Jr who was personal director for the Texas Air National Guard from 69 to 95 and who reviewed
bush's military records at the request of his campaign four years ago void is said that bush's
early discharge was not uncommon for pilots or other crewmen who were to leave soon and had been
trained now obsolete jets as was bush's case right so we'll give you eight months off the

these days but not too soon hopefully thanks for the corporate disease that I'm still getting
over with from your sick building by the way that's where I got sick down there this is just the
afterbirth of it I mean turn it on the heat in here yesterday only compounded it if you catch my
drift you don't need like made it worse but I got the crud right there in that room where you're
sitting so beware cross-border church visit cost man ten thousand dollars look at that
Montreal crossing the US Canada border to go to church on sunny cost the US citizen ten thousand
dollars for breaching Washington's tough new security rules the expensive trip to church was
a surprise you know something I think that this inspired me this story I think if it starts costing
everybody ten thousand dollars to go to church each time or synagogue or mosque or wherever they're
I think that solves the problem right there don't you sure people stop going the expensive
trip to church was a surprise for Richard Albert resident of rural Maine who lives so close to
the Canadian border the US customs office is right next door to his house house like the other half
doesn't residence of township fifteen range fifteen crossing the borders the daily ritual for
Albert the nearby Quebec village of St. Pamfield is where they shop eaten prey there are many such
situations in rural areas along the largely unguarded fifty five hundred thirty mile border between
Canada and the USA in which in some cases actually runs down the middle of streets through buildings
I never knew that did you yes the border runs down the middle of streets sometimes
like four forty one like by a mommy's house there it on side on her side it's Hollywood the
other side is a Davie but you know the rooms in some cases as a result Albert says he didn't
expect any problems three weeks ago when he returned home to the US after attending mass in
Canada as usual the local US customs station is closed on Sundays so we just drove around the
lock gate as he done every weekend since the gate appeared last May following a tightening of
border security two days later Albert was summoned to the customs office where an office
had told him he'd been caught on camera crossing the border illegally auto has granted
special passes to some 300 US citizens in that region so they can enter the country when Canadian
customs are post are closed but the US cancel the similar program last May surprise
that forces local residents to make a 200 mile detour along treacherous logging roads to get home
via the nearest staff border checkpoint what a bunch of assholes a spokesman for the US
bureau of customs and border protection would not comment specifically on Albert's case because
of privacy laws since 9-11 we've enhanced our security and some of the situations we
require inconvenience to people we have to go along with what the regulations are said Janet
rap report rap report a public affairs officer with a bureau she ended up local residents have
been told about the stricter controls Albert has appealed to find but has not attended the Sunday
mass since I feel like I'm living in a jail he said sir and you are yeah there you go Albert
that's a good old USA for you man just sticking it right in your butt oh and also you know I
didn't mention is bad bad my bad so too carried away with this pull well the move on dot org thing oh

says well if this is accurate how come we can't uh you can't produce one person because some of
the uh commanders from uh Houston and Atlanta came forward and said that they don't recall bush
being there during those years and how come you can't produce one person from either hewston or
Atlanta from the guard who can uh verify that he actually showed up there and was there and served

bag ever don't even think about it save that for the sports shows i've heard some of that crap
i've including somebody we all know absolutely yeah i've heard that garbage man what kind of a
lunatic what kind of a low life Jesus and then i don't want to go in i get upset okay if the
smell of popcorn conjures images of your favorite movie scenes you can probably think of Samuel
thanks Samuel Rubin hey thanks Sam mr. Rubin the man who quite possibly made the two inseparable
from indian movie goers died thursday and point and beach he was eighty five the smell was one of
the main reasons the majority of new year of city theaters didn't pop their own corn so mr.
Rubin who got the idea by seeing the snack being sold at a theater in the Midwest started popping
corn a long gaiolin city factory where it was bagged and delivered to metropolitan movie houses
am i losing it or what i thought when you went in the in the old days when you went in the movie
theater they had the big machine they're making the popcorn in they were not talking about the 1890s now
no they don't do that no more of course they do and you smith author of pop culture of social
oh no author of pop culture of social history of popcorn in america
said that new york theaters are among the last to embrace popcorn because it had a small profit margin
popping machines were a fire hazard and the snacks seemed a little bit declassay
like for low low low brown scumbags as a concessionaire where they be
she consolidated now partly odd in group where he worked from the age of twelve mr. Rubin
thought differently he was certainly not the first to sell popcorn in the york city theaters
but he was like to the first to popcorn and machines on a widespread basis in the venue managers
quickly realized that the smell of popping corn went out exactly hurt sales and improvements in
machines had less than the fire danger he was an innovator's whole life i don't understand it
he also sold pretzels at six and flags at nine at twelve he worked filling vending machines in movie
theaters which didn't yet have concession stands when a vending machine ruled and broke against the
stage used it as a counter to sell candy or precursor of the modern movie concession to
otherwise he's the one that made you sick at the movies all the time by all that crap

criminal charges to rise from the embrollio remember him he used to pitch for the red so
Ernie Brolio from the embrollio over internal memos downloaded from their computers by
republican staffers this is gonna be a criminal matter since senator Patrick Leahy
Vermont Democrat as he left nearly a two-hour meeting behind closed doors with the Senate
sergeant arms who's investigating the matter mr. Leahy not the sergeant arms mr. Leahy
another Democrats in the mean decline to share the specifics provided by sergeant arms William
pickle senator Richard Durbin Dick Durbin Illinois Democratic memos wound up in the pages of the
Washington Times Wall Street Journal City was startled by the briefing that mr. pickle gave
yesterday the extent and depth of the tech far exceeded anything I had imagined he said chief
legal counsel for Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist who handled judicial nominations resigned last
his position last week amid the two-month investigation of the matter Miguel Miranda told investigators
that he viewed the documents but was not responsible for distributing them he also said no
hacking had been involved in downloading the memos rather he said they were easily accessed
through a glitch in the firewall that separated democratic and republican documents stored electronically
on the judiciary committees shared computer server senator Ted Kennedy attended the meeting yesterday
also had memos from his office downloading called the actions highly improper highly unethical and
probably criminal he said you vote Ted nice going let him have it wait until we get to the story
about the al-Qaeda sympathizer turned to rap to battle the infidel hoi oh god

Sir Goyne'sville, Tennessee
intoxicated drivers take note
don't ask your 10-year-old daughter to drive your home
ah
Angela Michelle Brown, 37 was charged yesterday
with child endangerment and driving out of the influence of booze
after 30 said she got drunk and used her 10-year-old daughter as
a designated driver
she said I'm a very good driver
and she designated her as such
police arrested Brown last week after stopping a car that appeared to have a young driver
as I approached the car I noticed that an older female was laying down in the driver seat
officer Don Mitchell said in his report
the younger female told me that her mother had got drunk and she was trying to get them home
Mitchell's reports that Brown's breath alcohol test was 0.23
nearly three times higher than the legal definition of drunk and driving
which we already discovered from Diana Ross's 0.08
right right
the 10-year-old grandmother the 10-year-old girl's grandmother was called to come get the girl after police arrested her mother
the judge said it traveled February 18
well now let me ask you this is she do the right thing
no maybe the 10-year-old girl had some driving lessons
you never know and who do you think would have driven her home better the 10-year-old girl
or herself she should have just passed out in the gutter like any other self-respecting drunk
there you go
oh I don't even know if I want to do this story today woman participating in Lily trial hangs herself
19-year-old
a toxicology test will determine whether narcotics played a role in the suicide of a 19-year-old woman
who was participating in clinical trials for a new drug that Eli Lilly and company hopes to launch this year
that's the same Eli Lilly and company that gave you the little mind many years ago
the right and we had all in birth defects and people dying over there
that's the same company Eli Lilly
aka pharmaceutical company aka grey robber
Tracy Johnson
Venselam, Pennsylvania hang yourself Saturday night in the Lily Land for clinical research
by tying a scarf to a bathroom shower rod according to the Indianapolis Police Department
while the toxicology test is standard procedure in the investigation of suicides by the Marion County corner
it could have huge implications for Lilly if it's determined that the trial drug or removal from it played a role in the woman's suicide
Lilly said yesterday it doesn't believe the drug deluxe a teen was related to the method Johnson
who was a former student in the ad a Bible college
oh now the pieces are starting to fit together
toxicology test results expecting about a month
deluxe a teen is key to future business prospects of Lilly
it's the main ingredient in Symbalta
an anti-depressant drug
and in a stress urinary incontinence treatment
both of which are moving forward toward final approval by the FDA
however incidents such as this who was out of a clinical trial participant
often draw questions from the FDA and can relate the federal approval needed to bring a drug to market
oh god a pox on them
I hope that Jason Williams invades their labs
Eddie, Eli Lilly
okay okay they all want to pop it on Lilly pad
they make me sick
the Thalidomide people the pharmaceutical drug people
and now the new deal is what they're saying
oh if you buy drugs from Canada
a lot of that stuff is being imported from India
and the moon and Mars and Uranus and Gato and Rose Werdell
it's been and who's been dealing with it
right stay away from these unsafe Canadian drugs
they might kill you
just a freaking nightmare the older's only one reason
why they're starting a big son and by the way ask Billy Tozen down there and Luziana
the congressman that's on the pharmaceutical company payroll ask him how dangerous those drugs are
he'll do the same fight as dance for you
god oh there's another asshole
was a flight instructor
oh romsfeld
how's that pilot doing that? oh I actually mentioned this to you I must forgot

I'll tell you what else starts with the P and that's the pizza loft that's correct
Jeff Cohen don't start with no P's but nevertheless in fact I don't think they got P's on the menu
someday it would be nice to have somebody with send me a menu from the loft I've been in these spots for how many years now
about third man you have their menu
not that I really need it but it would be nice to have because they've got every kind of goody under the sun on an area
pasta dish ever invented one of the most important things to keep in mind at the pizza loft is
everything is cooked al dente to order fresh nothing is sitting around for hours
you know you're going to some of those spaghetti joints and the stuff has been sitting around you know in cold water
and the spaghetti gets softer and mushyer and mushyer and softer there's only one thing soft at the pizza loft and Jeff will tell you what that is
anyway they got all your pasta dishes they got chicken and veal seafood three different kinds of fantastic pizza
calzone super subs I guarantee the best garlic rolls you've ever had in your life and one thing also they'll do for you if you don't like all that garlic
I just Tom don't know no garlic driven I would if you do oh I love it man I just love when you squeeze it the garlic drips out
and they roll too they have takeout they have delivery they even offer catering for as little as five bucks per person at the pizza loft
they got lots and lots of room for you so you don't have to wait online even on the weekend at the world famous pizza loft in Davi
you'll find them right beyond here what imports in the pizza loft plaza tons of free parking for you too
right between Gryffin and 595 and prestigious university drive 9 5 4 9 1 6 8 8 8 8 8 that's the number to call for takeout and delivery 9 5 4 9 1 6 8 8 8 8
if you haven't been there yet I guarantee you I promise you'll be going back again and again because the food is fresh delicious the portions are gigantic and the prices are teeny and tiny

the benefit of the doubt that former Iraqulators Saddam Hussein's weapons program points the name and the threat
the main reason cited for going to war I was wrong I'm not pleased about it all I think all Americans
