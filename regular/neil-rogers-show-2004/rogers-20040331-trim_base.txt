Trudge Tracking?
Maybe launch a couple missiles

Whose first name begins with O
There's one thing we all underestimate
The blue palcator will be finished
Until we blow up Pakistan
Okay
We could chase and round forever
With our tanks and all our troops
The special forces are so tired
Of jumping through them clues
We don't need another place
Until let's cut out all the nonsense
And we'll blow up Pakistan
Oh right
Now clear the need and use rear-tank
You'll be sure I don't need stop to see food
And we'll blow up Pakistan
What did he say that he's a tad hootin'
What did he say?
Boom boom
You're free on
Ten oh two man I've been around some nervous knellies
In my time but I have never
Just like the thing we were discussing about
War Time Constiturious
Popeye Genko, look what we got
Uh, look what we got
Man, oh man
Get the staff shrunken there for muffin clearance okay
The trucking staff
Wow, wow, get the old truck and head in there for them
Boy, oh boy, talk about crazy then appear a bedbugs
Anyway
Happy Wednesday to you
It's a real happy day for us
Cause we got a Marlin game
And the sun is shining, it's not gonna rain
Hey did you get this pump and a copy yet?
Yes okay
When you just relax you're a little wired too now
Because of all that shenanigans going on this morning
It was fun to watch
You know it is one thing when you
F**k something out that we can't put on the year
Under the current environment that exists
The current chilling climate that exists
But when you f**k that isn't even there
And then you have a couple of boneheads who can
Oh I hear it, it's under there somewhere
And there's nothing there
Then you know at that point they're both over the age
They both need a long cooling out period you know what I'm saying
Wow
So much going on
Carry non by the way is on our website today
She's our behind our
Beauty curtain
We'll get to that stuff in a minute
First the bad news besides the muffin clearance came in
Don't let them come in again
And aim more right before the show
That's that
No seriously
Uh even in the stewardess Michigan
They wouldn't do that to you before you're supposed to do a radio show
Especially a talk show
They wouldn't do that to you
Just mess with your mind
Everybody
Everybody
Now let's hear that again
Let's hear that again
How about a better bleep
That's America searching for a better bleep
That's what we're doing in search of a better bleep
While bleeping people are dying all over the world
For example
Jubilant residents yank the bodies of four foreigners
One a woman at least one an American out of their burning cars today
Dranging the charred corpses through the streets
And hung them from the bridge
Spending the Euphrates River in Fallujah
Five American troops died in a roadside bombing nearby
The brutal treatment of the four corpses came after they were killed in a rebel attack
On their SUVs in the Sunni Triangle City
About 35 miles west of Baghdad
It was reminiscent of the 1993 scene in Somalia
When a mob dragged the corpse of a US soldier through the streets of Mogadishu
Eventually leading to the American withdrawal from the African nation of Somalia
And one of the bloodiest days of the US military this year
Five American troops died
When their military vehicle ran over a bomb in the suffrage incident 12 miles to the northwest
Champing Fallujah is the graveyard of Americans
Residents cheered after the grizzly assault
On two four-wheel-draft civilian vehicles which left both in flames
Others chanted we sacrifice our blood and souls for Islam
In other words
But a little bit like that
Associated press TV news picture showed one man beating the charred corpse with a metal pole
Others tied a yellow rope to a body
Hooked it to a car and dragged it down from the mainstream town
Two black and embankled corpses were hung from a green iron bridge
Across the Euphrates
Well, that's interesting now. I'd like to know when they bring into candy and flowers for the rest of the troops
The ones where I still alive now that we've reached the 600 mark even
They're gonna agree to us with candy and flowers
Right
Anyway, here's the result yesterday's pool
Do we have to really read all these names?
What a half
Well, we got Marlins on Dec. 1250 today
And the Marlins at the O'Rail's in Fort Lauderdale 105
The Humphreur the Hebrew Hammer follows the baseball game
And we got no rain in sight and it's a beautiful day inside Florida
So that means we have a nice short show today and believe me this is the appropriate day for it
What was your all-time favorite Elvis Presley song we asked in our poehliest today on the famous neo-roggies.com where we don't have any phony options by the way
Elvis sucks 310 of you said that 22.7 percent
I thought it'd be a lot higher net. It started at about 38 percent and I went down from there
As the Elvis people came flocking in to vote on our pool. Can I say flocking? No
As the Elvis people came f***ing in. Oh, that makes any of the words then
help
Say sometimes no bleep is better than yeah, I see yeah, that's what we learned this morning

There is the Elvis stuff from yesterday
If I could only tell them if we get out I should have had that tape roll in this morning
I'm getting a little slow in my old age in my cottage
If I would have had the tape roll and I'd play that the little meeting we had this morning
We could do a replay from oh now now you couldn't do it justice. Okay. It's couldn't do it justice
I can
Hearing things that don't exist. Oh, but I want a better bleep in there
A better bleed to cover up what you quizzling you cypaled in you you silly goose man
Anyway, Terry none she's behind to be the curtain if you're over the age of 62
If you're not collecting social security yet, but you're read on the edge
If you have 14 pieces of ID and if you have permission slips from the attorney general and all of his ass systems

probably I think she is I don't know about 45 42. Oh
Sorry, Terry. He was born June 26

That were bugging us before the show this morning for about 40 minutes, which is never gonna happen again
And uh number three year who fears okay, now here's the deal stop at cc.com
I guess it'll need a moral now because it sure isn't gonna happen today not with fast-so sleeping and late up there
but uh i think this is god in the york i got to tip my hat to him because very rarely it is like one individual
It goes to show that people can make a difference
one guy put his uh put his heads together and come up with such a good idea and really carry it through so well
He's got 130,000 plus signatures already
And florida by the way is only about 170 behind texas were catching on i'm not gonna push it today by the end of the week
You're right we'll pass texas like those yahuas are standing still to move in the second place behind california
Which is uh often running
But i'm looking at the a page today and this is really interesting
Something brand new well first first before that
I
Notice at the bottom of the page on stop at cc.com scott says this project is getting very expensive for me to run
We've set up a paypal account to accept donations
I don't want you to get confused with that and the thing we're gonna raise donations for to buy the newspaper
And you want to say today or wherever
But i would hope that some in fact i know i'm gonna
With some cash if you can donate any amount even five bucks to stop at cc.com and the campaign for free speech
Please keep the book click the button below. Oh watch what you said
And then scott of he's a master correcting you donate so please send him a few bucks, okay

And then all you do is press the button underneath that and it ought to you click in which state you live in
And you just click send to my two senators and about a bing there it goes you don't have to do anything else
Which i think is absolutely fabulous nice going scott sensational job
So coast to show you out of a 300 million people there's one out there
It's really doing a hell of a job nice going and he doesn't give a
About that
In fact, he does give a crap about it, which is why i started the whole thing
12 minutes after 10 at 560 wq aim
Let me tell you right now if the macros gets worn out your back is gonna tell you because you wake up feeling in the morning like crap
Like you haven't slept at all
So if you need new macros there all kinds of ways to do it you can head to your bedding or department store
Get ripped off where you can do the smart thing like i've been doing for a long time
Call our good friends a dollar macros one 800 macros
The out of macros backs up everything they see and they're advertising a 140 percent
But the competitor still lie a lot when you see a big macros said making outrageous claims
Be sure to redefine print and you'll discover all of those lies
Here's an example there's a big headline that says half off
But then you discovered that this only applies to limited select abitems you've never buy everything else is full price
And they probably double the regular price first and you'll probably never be able to make the third change if you don't like it anyway
But if down a macros derailleur has had no tiny print no disclaimers when you call one 800 macros
You'll see that the prices are so low other stores have to offer half off sales just to compete
Down a macros has a no-risk 30-day competitive change follow-up
On all beds including yours don't forget when you call down a macros at one 800 macros
You're getting your company ranked number one overall customer satisfaction from Kendall to Stuart Palmbeats to Ford Myers
And dollar macros reminds you to read that fine print because they want you to know what you're buying even if you decide to buy from somebody else
So what you'd be waiting for do the smart easy convenient thing just make that one easy call the one 800 macros or log under their website
macros.com
dial a macros at one 800
MATTR ES the honest way to buy you a great bed
I
HATE this place
The medications don't work I've been here for seven years nothing works here. I hate this place
Nothing works here. The medications don't work. I've been here for seven years. I hate this place
Nothing works here
Thank you
George Bush
You can learn so that you can
Oh boy, baby. Yes, ma'am now you said you
So deputy just fine. My you be
At sent in your mind George Bush
Your position since they has John Kerry
Is up to your fate it's those questions
Of something national guard that might lead your rep
You
Just say you're not
What a funny thing
Oh
The story
17 at 560 W and Rick faxed and said I love it finally
He's gonna test to find public under wrote just remember that she's been coasted on what to say until a cow's come home
I wouldn't be surprised if she invoked of the fifth one more than one occasion
He says I really hope she does and makes the whole of ministry whole administration to look for themselves into a grave
Says Rick whose relentless and also and he's right
Big Arnie says the year Wayne Heisenga talking about why he kept on set on his head coached at all pins
No, I did not I guess he called the a little dog this morning is what I heard Joe say at the end of a show
You didn't hear it? No
One of the things Wayne mentioned as a matter of fact I'm thinking right now in honor of this. Why do we play?
That's right. We can't what I just wanted to stir up a little psychosis in his theory and both of their minds
Because they're probably listening right now on the edge of each other's seat
Anyway see I heard that I heard the age yeah, but I didn't say anything else
Oh, we can't say age. Oh
Anyway, one of the things you mentioned is that they've wants to say religious man
Oh, yeah, what fact does that have to do with anything should he be fired if he wasn't religious man
And then he says Jesus Christ or speaking of a Christ
Yeah, what's that guy up there the attorney general of the state of Florida Charlie Christ
Here's a riddle for you and I'm not gonna give you the answer
What does Mark Foley that the Republican
Representative from West Palm Beach Mark Foley Charlie Christ and Charles Nelson Riley have in common now
That's the riddle I'm not gonna give you the answer
I didn't say anything
I'm just I'm just crossing that out there for you to think about
Throughout today dead because two of them are still alive. I mean, I don't want an answer. Okay. It was a rhetorical question
What does Charlie Christ Mark Foley and Paul and have in common? I'll think about it. Okay. Well Paul
End is dead so that couldn't be it anyway five six seven what am I gonna remember out having a pull question?
Yeah, well under a lot of stress and pressure today because before this year we had
Like a little seminar there's a brain trust came in
Like that
Wow that that was special man. I've heard some real crap in my time
So then the thing we can still say crap. I mean a darn good thing gosh darn and we can still say crap
Because that was the biggest pile of manure man
Even the cow fields in Iowa they have never seen or smelled manure like we just got laid on us for about 40 minutes
That was really talk about piling on
Here's today's full question
I don't think we ever actually we do this before
No, I never did. No, if you could be anything is living person for one year
Who would it be?
Now George said Rupert Murdoch
So I was thinking about it. I'm not really sure
Since you said for a year because I wouldn't want to be like impermanently, you know, he's old
Right, but for a year I could do a lot of yeah, you probably will be a lot of stash away a lot of bank accounts in Switzerland fights
I'm gonna put down Tom Brady
Okay, okay, because although I wouldn't want to get hurt in them football games
But nevertheless he's got his big and strong and of course they're with those looks and everything you do whatever
That you want, you know, I mean guys girls anything
I mean just I'm talking about friends of course, we're not talking about that right people to hang out with
So anyway, that's our full question
I think it's pretty interesting if you could be anything is living person for one year who would it be and don't give me this
Oh, I'm happy being who I am yeah, right. Oh please
I always want to do that, you know, I don't give me that crap. Okay, we're not that way. You can weigh in. Hello
Hey, good morning. How do you guys doing pretty good?
I was wondering if I could go speak him. I mean, okay
I just got a I got an idea for a poll. Okay
The poll would be basically you know who gave who gave the who's saying all those weapons and mass destruction and
Yeah, that's good. Okay
Oh
Dude, it's gonna be great. Thank God for that ballgame and we love the Marlins. They are the best. They're my favorites
Marlins and the Orioles in four-letter-day alarm. Marlon on deck pregame is a 12 15-amart game title 105
It's gonna be great in the sunshine state in fact. Let's play 10
10 what how come we haven't put the poll up there if you put the poll up now
There we got to push you what we don't have anything for it yet. We got two names and then he can go away and then Josh can add a mother
That's my point see all right. We don't need to hold much of names because obviously he's got a little bit catching up to do up there in Orlando
He's got to start making a bacon for all them sandwiches. He's gonna be eating
So let's get with it Eric. Okay, let's hop on it baby. We got Terry none
And her brother Sam none they're on there naked
WQA and hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing pretty good? Hey, you know, uh, so I guess we're gonna get this right to testify, huh
This bush is a flip-flop artist
He says one thing and he does something else flip-flopper. Yeah, okay WQA. I'm hello
They're all doing stick to this way
Yeah, we're trying to save the world again WQA. I'm hello. What we haven't heard from that idiot in a long time. I'm
Yes, sir
Don't worry about nails thing. No, we're not there. Didn't ask a question. Okay, she's just Kate Christ man
Wow, if you could be any famous living person for one year who would it be? I think that's a fine question
And of course then when bush comes on yesterday and does that real quick with no questions asked in the oil how come you wait
It's so long and he's running away from the press. Uh, who's he kiddin man only the dumbest of the dumb
To a lot of what he really should have said was the political pressure got heated up so bad
We had to drag her out and put the bitch on here. We just hope she don't make a fool out of herself
And yeah, the audience said that's the name of that tune
I thought of course you were gonna say that but that's basically what he said
WQA and hello, good morning. Yeah, I'm pretty good. Oh my god. That stuff in the luge are really boiled my blood
Yeah, I understand you know that what I'm about to say isn't gonna go over well and I understand you know
What you're about to say in other words, this is a preface to what you're about to say sort of
Yeah, if I can
Do you feel allow me yeah, I just basically you know feel it
I mean, I understand the angle about uh
That we that we went to Iraq on false pretenses and the whole thing with Bush and I don't support him at all
But the fuck these hypocritical
Iraqis are gonna you know cheer that said I don't think it's gone
But then you know they don't like us being there and they're attacking people that are really trying to help
You know, I mean they're trying to help rebuild the help rebuild by closing down newspapers that they don't like the opinion of for example
And by taking cutting off their just taking away their jobs and
By turning by turning their cities into like a blood bath into a nightmare
Well, I mean
You're right now you're buying this whole baloney that we went there to liberate your acutely
I would get some help I get some mental help immediately before the day's outbreak
We didn't get you three for one deal with Duffin clearance. Okay. We didn't get you held a deal package deal
They got package deals that every shrink and fail now because times are tough
We didn't go there to liberate anybody. Okay. The Neal cons designed this whole and then that's what's coming out now
With all this a kind of Lisa businessman
With Richard Clark and with Paul O'Neill and all of these people
This is nothing new
This is no like Paul Kerman said in the article right yesterday. There's no debate about this
They had the roadmap for all of this crap drawn out there five years ago two years before 911
They were just waiting for any excuse and that's why right after 911
Well, I would did a racquet of anything to do with this. I want you to go and find me some of the connection with Iraq
Yeah, I mean what kind of garbage is that?
And those people everybody there the Iraqis themselves and the 600 Americans and the Brits and the Australians
Everybody else who's died there
They'd still be alive today for word for this insanity not to mention of course how we've left on our guard on the war on tear
Because we've ever done all these resources and troops there into this bogus war in Iraq and you're buying into it
And how they should be grateful to us well, although first of all our crazy religious nuts, all right
We're not gonna straighten out. We're not gonna democratize the Middle East
That's a that's a pipe dream. It's a lunacy and if we want to democratize the Middle East
Why don't we start and sell those great democracies like Saudi Arabian Pakistan, huh? That would be good
Yeah, democratize the Middle East by fat ass lunatics insane crazy people
And this last guy talked to his another one
I'm not for boy. That's not bad. That these in grades these bastards there
Yeah, right. He'd be real sympathetic. It's how he had to were patrolling the streets kicking his door down
That's right. That would be great and closing down the hero
Which probably be a better idea than whatever newspaper they shut down in Iraq. He'd greet them with candy
And flowers well, they had a shutdown that paper because it was a head to do something with Shiite. Yeah
Oh no

Neil yes, sir
First of all, I got to give you a name for the poll and then I'll say about Wayne calling it yeah
The number one thing on your poll is gonna be breaking spears you want to know why?
Because forget about sending her money you play with her body all day you just stay home and never get anything done
I see okay moving right along don't say spoiler to her in the movie right now
All right, listen Wayne called up on your buddy moe show and was yelling at him and Geldy for misquoting really
Yeah, I didn't hear
Oh, how come I didn't hear Joe?
I heard him say was that Wayne called the station. I didn't hear was on the moe show
Wayne called moe at like 745 and I guess he said he was in the car. He was unhappy with
The miss quoting by Geldy and Moe and said he wanted to send some things straight and miss calling about what well
By the way, by the way, Wayne hates you a moe. I should point that out. I've mentioned that before but just in case you forgot
Yeah, well he was I guess before the before
Wayne called in Galby and Moe were talking about how he had talked about
He's a feeling of the next name arena and he just basically just some quotes and
He wanted to say that that was incorrect. So basically he even calling as a friend. He called them to you know yellow
Well, what do you mean he said that was incorrect? I heard them play that the yesterday. He did say that
He said well, he didn't say he would be said he might be for the next day in marina or something like that
Right, he said it was a quote that Wayne claimed he said was that he wanted a
Feelie to be the next day in marina whereas Moe and Geldy were saying you know, oh, you know
Wayne's playing he's gonna be the next in marina and so I said I never said he was gonna be the next day in marina
Would oh, he's told others we had a big contrast between

Polka Brian records is like four or five comedy bits and he asked to bring them into the station so that mufflinzy can
To find something productive to be doing and listen to them first to make sure that they're okay
They've got his squeal of approval to be on here
Right
So he brings these in yesterday which every two day I guess today that he generally shows up with a visc and
Muff sits down and listen to this and then he and clearance gets their heads together
That's the same clearance who gave me that memo yesterday and lied to me
And give me that pull crap about that phony auction about that new uh
Revenue stream, but anyway
And so they listen to these bits and so they get to this one and oh a little red light goes off in their head
Right
And duck goes through a whole
Herniotic son advance about he wishes that Volka would redo it so that the second bleep is as good as the first one
The only problem with that being is that Volka didn't verbalize any of the words that he bleaked out
In other words, he just put the bleep in there
There's no word actually there in a recording
But he wants to first bleep and a second bleep to be the same
Oh my god, we're talking about
A little crazy certifyably crazy people get the straight jackets
Get the honey junior straight jacket

About 20 minutes of it on at the bit
Playing it over and over. Oh, yeah, but I hear it. I hear it
They hear it because it's in their mind that they hear it a word that isn't there in their mind
That's what happens with you out of filthy dirty mind, okay
Emotional elder bush attacks sons critics
Top an emotional former president George Herbert Walker Bush yesterday
Defended his sons Iraq war and lashed out at White House critics
It is deeply offensive and contentable to hear elites and intellectuals on the campaign trail
This missed programs in Iraq since last year's overthrow of Iraqi leader son who's saying the elder boy said in a speech too
Hold on now, all right hold in a speech to the national pectoral chemical and refiners associations national convention and send it to the
Hotel Texas. Oh

There was something ignorant in the way that dismissed the overthrow of a brutal dictator in the sewing proceeds of
basic human freedom in the that trouble part in the world he said the former president appeared to fight back tears
As he complained about media coverage of the younger boy that he called something short a fair and balanced
It hurts an awful lot more when it's your son who's been criticized than when they used to get all over my case
said Bush was often complained about media coverage of both boy presidency

Clear Channel Radio and the Reverend Jesse Jackson announced today
that the Reverend Jackson will be host of five
What is it over a live one hour talk show airing Sunday 7 a.m. Central time
8 to 9 a.m. Eastern time
Keep hope alive
With Reverend Jesse Jackson will debut April 4th exclusively on Clear Channel Radio stations
And whatever it's changed from Chicago is WGCI AM, whatever that is
The broadcast will focus on issues of cultural, political and religious significance
But guess the appearances by community and world leaders and a live call and segment
But you must talk in jive and rhyme
You do understand that when you call in?
Absolute in jive
It'll be just fine if you call it on the line
But anyway
The show marks the first time Reverend Jackson will be hosting a radio program
I guarantee it's going to go over like Halifide Siberia
We will discuss the central issues local national and international of our time
We will offer information inspiration direction main points of view
We will talk with and hear from you
We intend to connect the nation with shared conversation
Your voice matters
Remember in the beginning was the world the world and you have the power
Keep hope alive
And don't talk no jive
Initially airing in New York San Francisco, Chicago Philadelphia
Detroit and North of Virginia
Keep hope alive with Reverend Jackson will be introduced to additional markets throughout the year
Third channel radio will consider syndicating the program nationally
Depending on listen and response
How do you like that?
Jesse Jackson's go a nationwide with his love child
Man
Really sad
And they were America's shirts today with the goddess
And Al Franken
And Jeanne Garafalo and all of these people
You guys to defend Muslim girl wearing scarf in school
The Justice Department announced to the government civil rights lawyers have jumped into a legal case to support a Muslim girls
Right to wear a head scarf in public school
Assisted attorney general for civil rights, I don't know we had civil rights anymore
I thought that was gone now
Yeah
Anyway the assistant attorney general for these things, Alex Acosta said the government lawyers would support 11-year-old
Nashala Hurrin, a six-rate student who was suiting Muscogee Oklahoma Public School District
For ordering her to enroll her head scarf or hijab, hijab?
Because it violated the dress code of the Benjamin Franklin Science Academy which you attended
The girl continued to wear her hijab, the school was subsequently suspended twice for doing so
The family appealed the suspensions which were upheld by a district administrative hearing committee
Her parents filed suit against the Muscogee School District last October
On Tuesday the federal government filed a motion in the federal court in Muscogee to intervene in support of Nashala's position
No student should be forced to choose between following her faith and enjoying the benefits of a public education across the state and the state of the company government's court filing
I say leave it home, leave your faith at home, leave your schmuck visit home
That's my suggestion
Probably you'll burn a hell if you think of it
Good, that makes it even better
Now what was this thing that somebody who has faxed me here, trialed against in debts of sons hit with stones?
Oh yeah, that's right
Oh yeah, depressing
Time or Texas, oh that's a really a great place and that's a bastion of Americanism, the likes of which even W would be reversed by
Even QA would be reversed by, we thought after yesterday that we had no embarrassment factor on this radio station but I guess maybe we do
That thing would have auctioned yesterday's seriously, I'm never going to recover from that as long as I live
And you should have parents lining and whimpering, were you in there when he was going, oh gee well I didn't mean I apologize
I didn't mean to try to fool you and I just, they were right
You are so full of it man, you're in the crappy just seeping from your earlobe, okay, clearance, that's how full of it you are
And your boyfriend, your boyfriend, they're a man
With that bit that we played, that word block, they're then both of them, you know, it's to both they're hearing it
Okay
As Marv Alper would say, they're hearing it from the crowd
That's funny when you get a shared delusion
Yeah, well I'm when you're sitting that close, usually only I can see the pink rabbit
When parents are sitting on the must lap, you know, it's easy to hear things
Tyler Texas, a mother who bashed your son's heads with heavy rocks, killing two of the boys, but so delusional
She thought the Lord told her to do it or attorney said, they're opening statements at her murder trial
This is so typical of religious crazy people I apologize for the redundancy
Does she follow what she believes to be God's will, unless she turned her back on her God defense attorney
Buck files junior asterigery of eight men and four women
How's it going? Buck, the NL-39, stay at home mother, has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity
To charge his a murdering eight-year-old Joshua and six-year-old Luke
Oh, look at those names, huh? Joshua and Luke and causing serious injury to Aaron 14 months at the time
Aaron? Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty, and of course they're why not
I'd fry her ass right now, right on the crossfire this afternoon
I put her in Bob Novak's lap and fried up both of them
The deeply religious East Texas woman who was who homeschooled her children in New Chapel Hill
Weft as she listened to testimony and prosecutors showed gruesome photographs of her slain children
Her husband who had supported her sat a few rows behind with friends and family, her husband who supported her
Prosecutors contend Lany new right from wrong when she co-ed her children last May
Despite opinions from Fusseky, a psychiatric experts for the offense, two for the prosecution and one for the judge
All of whom said Lany was legally insane
District Attorney Matt Bingham said Lany attacked the baby first, hammering his head with a four-and-a-half-pound rock she had hidden under the ice crib
Aaron Lany will never be the same said, Bing, adding that the voice vision has been impaired, he'll never live independently
Lany then woke up Luke, let him outside the family's room, Brick home, and asked him to put his head on a large rock
The prosecutor said Lany smashed the 60-year-old skull with a large landscaping rock then she went to get her older's child Joshua
He too put his head against the large rock in the yard his mother fasted his skull with a 16-pound rock the boys were found in their underwear
Oh my God
Feel God
It's a positive influence to the Bible
Right, the Bible really does a man, more connoisseur and all of these people

Pat Robertson, I want to be able to talk to God too
Okay, Pat Robertson, there you go
Let's get him on there and at least we'll fill out the list with some names on there
Okay, they don't understand this is a very serious, scientific thing

Hugh Heffner has got 77, he's an author, right, a man
I guess you're right Josh, they all want to be Hugh Heffner
They don't get it, they all understand these old and feeble
Bill Gates, 27, see that's called, see us old far, it's always accused me of living in the past
I think a lot of you young rupps are living in these other people's past
We're not talking about how do you like to be Hugh Heffner 40 years ago, see
But Hugh Heffner is 77 and then we can bring them some Fel Dean
I thought about Hugh and ruled him out for that reason
Bill Gates, 27, Tiger Woods, 23, I think that's a pretty good choice
Tom Brady, 12, which I think is a fabulous choice
See a lot of the guys out there won't vote for Tom Brady because they feel like it's like a f*** thing, see
Because he's too pretty
And they don't want to stand, even though we're not tracing their votes yet
Ryan Jeremy's got 8, which I find just astonishing, shocking Britney Spears 8, Rupert Murdock 5
Johnny Depe 5, Miguel Cabrera's got 3, George W's got 3, Peter North 3
Ricky Martin 2, Michael Douglas 2, LeBron James's got 1, and Joey Butterfucko just went on their 193 votes
What would make this a thing work, whether you want it or not?
You know what I mean?
It'll work
It'll work?
It'll work
It'll work for me, you want to know why it works for me?
Based on them
That's right, because we got the Marlon game
Miguel Cabrera, Josh Beckett, Brad Penny and your Florida Marlon
The Rupert of the rest of Mike B, I don't know
I just don't care, Mike Lowell
There you go, there's another one
Well there's only 25 guys on the team, I got 4 already
Let me think real hard
And of course Jack McKeehan is your manager of your Florida Marlon
He just turned 95
I mean he just turned on I-95, made a wrong, make a U turn, real quick Jack, you're on the wrong side of the road
That's something about Wayne Heizinger calling in Moe and Gildy this morning, that's something
That's funny
Because, especially, see what you're forgetting, maybe you're not, is that he's talking to the play-by-play voice of his Miami-Dophons
Whom he hates like poison, anyways, from all the reports I'm getting
So Moe probably is like, oh is he, but I mean, but I would love to know
Oh man, would I give anything to hear a tape of that conversation, wouldn't you?
I don't want to say we're going to put our spies on that, on the case
But man, would that be something a delight?
To hear that verbal intercourse between Wayne Heizinger, which we can't call him what I used to anymore
Because that would be really f***ing bad, and Moe and Gildy
So personally I think Moe is a lot worse than what I used to call Wayne, but nevertheless
A lot more obscene
11-13 at 5-60 WQM, fat is obscene if you're trying to lose it

I don't have a lot of guys that said they want to be Hugh Heppner but nobody has said Larry Clinton yet
That was his tastelessness against you
Now this box here, this is exactly what I had in mind, here's somebody understands what I'm driving at
OK, Brad the Pitmeister, Brad Pitt, so I could be doing Jennifer's as this boxer, see
Right, that's where it's at
Oh, did I say so I could be doing so I could be
in other than M.A.C.
or seconds.
So that's one of those where if you put the bleep in,
see if I say doing Jennifer, that's okay,
but if I say,
in Jennifer, that could be some of the things.
No problem.
No, but I'm just saying that'll teach them to be,
so for Sticky would all their bleeps, you know,
will all their bleep being a bullcrap,
malconclerance.
If I were them, I'd be held a lot more worried about that
phony auction deal that the beesleens are running.
I'd be a lot more worried about that.
And I'd also be a lot more worried about some of their
other shows because this isn't the show that's going to create
them a problem.
Did it create them a problem this last time?
No.
Is it going to create them?
No.
I mean, we're like, I've reached 99 and 44% pure.
And the other part we like, when in doubt we bleep it out.
But I mean, but I think because it makes them feel useful,
you know, like they're doing something.
Believe you me, if I had some real questions about what we
could say and what we can play and what they knew deal,
these, those would be two of the last people I would ever
ask them to.
Nervous Nellies.
Pean on each other's pants.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
See, the Hugh Hepneth thing, I'm trying to think of, I mean,
like Donald Trump would be good, these Donalds,
uh, under the age of 100, right?
Right.
Hugh Hepneth, he would be a good one if he owed it as he used to be.
Who isn't?
Hugh.
Right.
Exactly.
But nevertheless, he's off to the races because they've got this
image worked up in their minds, it's like your friend Josh
sitting there.
Oh yeah, the Hugh Hepneth, they're my steward.
But my big Stogie and my Matthew, but all these playboy,
but he's around right.
And your Viagra, the candy bowl.
Right.
Yeah, I think the word you're looking for is frustrated is what, uh,
Hugh, but who knows, I could be wrong.
He could be one hell of a stud.
He might be tired of it by now.
Who knows?
No.
Oh, I'm looking at this, we got to bleep this one out.
Oh, I understand, Alex Rodriguez, now that is a good choice.
There is a good choice.
I have to admit as much as I despise him like poison,
he's a good looking guy, he's making 25 million year,
and he's playing with the Yankees, he'll probably win the world
series and all of these things and these, there was a good buddy,
Derek Jeter, and they're like, uh, eaten and greeting and meeting.
And the other girls.
So Alex Rodriguez is a ninja, certainly a lot better choice than Miguel Cabrera.
And you're Florida, Marlon, so we love on a show because game time is
105 pre-game at 1250.
Yeah.
I'm thinking you know how the Cubs and really feel they play mostly day games
too.
I'm thinking that the Marlon should play, even though it's a hundred degrees
in the shade, all through the summer day games every day.
Double headers.
Quite well early.
You're in the morning, it's not so hot.
Right.
Starting at about 1015 would be good, but a pre-game show at 955.
Hahaha.
Ah, yeah!
And next week, if you think this is a game, we got the opening day game.
I believe that's Tuesday. I'm not really sure, I think it is.
That's what I care, except for the fact that we have a two hour show that
there we get off at noon.
Oh, hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
Mad Dog's got a good scam going, he was off yesterday,
Kimbo was on, mad Dog's off again today.
Man, you talk about having a great student, he learned from me as well as anybody.
The Hebrew Hammer, he learned too a little bit, but the mad Dog, this man has learned the
100%, I give him a plus plus.
More money, less work.
Take the money straight to the bank, don't pay any attention to what they say, and just
have a smile on your big fat push.
That's it. That's the mad Dog.
All right.
There you go.
Come back tomorrow, though.
Oh, wait a minute, speaking of the Hebrew Hammer, I shouldn't, I shouldn't be so quick to judge.
Did you look at tomorrow's schedule and also for Friday?
Oh, look at that.
There's a guy here.
Oh, no.
Joe is a guy here for two days for the Hebrew Hammer Thursday and Friday, so hands
learned too, he understands, less work, more money.
And stay out of the building as often as possible.
You notice how often Hank does the show out anywhere now at this point?
Often.
DeBahamas, Vegas, tennis tournaments, golf tournaments, assulas, any placement in that
the festering joint.
WQA, and hello.
Good afternoon.
How are you, Neil?
Good evening.
How are you?
Fine.
I have two for the poll, and one I think with the accident would be Wayne Heisinga, and the
other one because of the power he has and the other one would be Kitty Carlisle.
Have a good day.
Oh, yeah.
The power that he has, Kitty Carlisle.
Oh, okay.
You're right.
I should have been kidding.
We missed out.
Don't put either one of those on here.
Although you might put Wayne on there.
Right?
A lot of people.
He's got a lot of passes.
He gets in all the ball parts for free.
He gets to go in the locker room there.
No, you get this guy ahead in mind.
Go in the locker room, check out the guys.
567.0560, pound 56 on the, in fact, I understand the rumor I'm hearing is that Wayne showers
with the guys after every dolphin victory.
That could be wrong.
I mean, moment of just made that up.
How many QA and hello?
Neil, how are you going, man?
Pretty good.
I actually have two for your poll also.
Really?
Just like the last guy, okay?
Almost as good.
My first guy is actually two people almost.
Any one of them, a loose brothers?
I don't know if you know those guys are?
No, I do not.
They're the owners of the Sacramento Kings.
They're way out there and they actually, they were on a couple of hotels and I was Vegas.
Those guys are just constantly getting it.
And my second guy, I'm sure you, someone's already said them though.
Luis Miguel.
I mean, I got you to have his back or bronze and put up a...
Okay, great.
Luis Miguel, he said something about his got that bronze complexion.
Is that what he just said?
Right.
From all the sudden.
Right.
From all that Mexican son.
Luis Miguel.
Hello, Luis.
I'd lose an answer to a far where you're because your rectum is getting to be king size, okay?
It used to be a queen size, not like a king size.
5670560, 0.560 on the AT&T line.
If you could be anything is living person for one year, who would it be?
You have their 90.
Bill Gates 38.
Tiger Woods has got...
The third man.
Tom Brady 14.
Britney Spears 10.
Ron Jeremy 9.
Johnny Depp 7.
George W. is got 7.
Peter and Rostrat 5.
And Ron Jeremy is got 9.
Oh my God.
Woo!
Rupert Murdock 5.
Donald Trump 3.
How can you have her head like 90 and Donald Trump's got 3?
One of those things.
And Donald Trump has even got his own TV show now.
It's embarrassing as it is.
You're fired.
Ricky Martin 3.
Miguel Cabrera 3.
Michael Douglas 3.
And the LeBron James appear.
Brad Pitscott 1 already.
Zero for Pat Robertson.
Two of our better food co-in Alex Rodriguez.
A. Rogers went on 230 votes.
Pretty weak response to then against a pretty weak pool question.
And they're mine.
I thought it was excellent.
I mean, see, I don't want to say...
If you could be somebody else.
Right.
Somebody famous who would it be?
What were you doing really for one year?
Because then you get this...
Oh, I'm real happy being who I am.
See them and they'll say that.
Do we believe them?
No.
But that's what they'll say.
But just for one year.
WQAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I don't want to slow.
Yes, I am.
Rush Limbaugh.
Rush Limbaugh, okay?
He wants to be a big fat pill-pop in the hypocrite.
Rush Limbaugh, got it?
You don't have to be Rush to be one of those.
That's true.
WQAM, hello.
Neil, hi.
Yes, sir.
Hey, if you got Ricky Martin on there.
Then the guy who's going to be getting the most action
for the next year, I'd say, would be William Hone.
William Hone?
Yeah.
Answering the musical question is William Hone.
William Hone.
He sure can't sing, can he?
No.
But he's...
I love that one, Vitho.
What the hell is that?
I don't know.
I'll find it.
You get it up there.
I think it's important.
The bits.
The bits I'm talking about.
Oh.
Man, oh man.
This guy's looking for trouble.
And all the right places.
And I'm just the right place, too.
It's paranoid wind, they both.
You've got to be thinking about what, though.
Talk to me.
Tell me your name.
You blow me up like it's all the same.
You made it clear, and I'm shaking away like a phone.
Yeah, say it then.
Woohoo.
You got to get rid of the way.
They crash in room to room.
I go crazy because she knows I should fly.
He sings like a fee.
Like every girl in history.
Cheap face!
Cheap face!
Oh, there's your guy that's got his 15 seconds of fame in all of a sudden he's a stupid
star man.
Can't sing his word about paper-second, he's probably getting some.
26 after 11 at 5, 60, that would be Q&A.
All you folks out there, please listen because this is very, very important thing.

I'm not going to do my own.
This is 420-062-2008.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
I'm going to do my own.
Well, I was busy reading all these important facts as well.
What will you do when I hear some old Jews
Will you back off and give me your land?
Lift me a towel and I'll sing you a song
And I'll steal from you all that I can.
Oh, I can choose to give me help from my friends.
Oh, I'm back news with a little help from my friends.
I can't lose with a little help from my friends.
What do I do when I close you's a way?
All your love is fanned afresh and long.
Oh, yes, I do.
I hold many times by the end of the day
As long as that death is not your own.
Oh, no.
I hear Jews with a little help from my friends.
My friend knows with a little help from my friends.
Oh, I can't lose with a little help from my friends.
Do you need any time?
I need somebody to care.
Could it be any time?
And you, woman, or kids, can be bears.
Would you take lands and then give up the fight?
Of you, I'd like to be a bear.
You describe all the time.
Do you have peace with me?
Is really my...
I want to stop the privilege or mine.
Oh, I give you a little help from my friends.
I'm back news with a little help from my friends.
Oh, I can't lose with a little help from my friends.
Yes, I'll kill you with a little help from my friends.
With a little help from my friends.
I'll kill you with a little help from my friends.
I'll kill you with a little help from my friends.
Let's go to the fight, six days later.
I'd like to lean on a little bit too hard in the button too.
Let's see, in recated glaciers, this is because of Anna Cornicovas' time.
Good point. Very good choice, Anton.
I almost did put Enrique on her and said, Tom Brady.
There you go.
I figured that Tom is probably a bigger man in the world of sports.
Here's one that says, how about Vanessa Paradise?
A hot-deppen cider is nothing to complain about.
What it says here.
Paradise.
Paradise.
Paradise.
Cinema Paradise.
I have no idea how you pronounce it.
Vanessa Paradise.
Oh, by the way, don't forget what your name is on our thing.
They're Terry Nunn.
I don't know who that is.
And what was the thing I had about Berlin about how they're going to like...
I'm going to go back and make sure that they do that.
Let's see.
Reference Donald Trump from Alfie.
And you're right, Alfie.
I saw that.
It says, in the financial section of the Sun Central Day, there's an auditor's report that says,
Donald Trump's five casinos in Atlantic City are in serious trouble.
In fact, the big headline says, Trump off-saurus.
Not by choice for many reasons, including that beaver he wears on his dome.
Well, at least it's not a muskrat like the Mo-man wears, but anyway.
Here's one that says, Bill Clinton.
That's what Kyle says.
And then he's got a bunch of other rambling on here with your olignor.
I'll pretend I didn't see.
Bill Clinton, that's a good choice.
Right.
That's what it is.
So my good is in choice.
Why didn't we think of that?
Here's one that says, Neil Rogers.
It says, with your quit wit, hear more intelligence and your paycheck, excluding the homosexuality.
And also they didn't mention your looks.
Although, looks don't seem to qualify for you after you.
I don't know.
We've got some other pretty, you believe people on this list.
So they don't really care about that about being ugly.
They just figure if they look like...
And Terry, your words, he should write nothing to a...
Look at.
Wow.
Who, man.
He is.
They can choose sexuality.
They want to be you.
That's the gay you.
I think if Terry rewards you, if the Spaceship Land you'll find all of his kin hopping off.
I could be wrong, but I'm thinking he's out of this world.
Those long figured aliens.
If you could be any famous living person for one year, who would you choose?
You have to know 94.
Bill Gates 40.
Terry rewards 35.
Tom Brady only 19.
Well, come on.
You'd rather be who have toer than Tom Brady?
Man.
See, they don't get it.
They don't understand it.
They're the coolest.
I think homosexual men must be a little bit confused, you know what?
Maybe.
They think that just because of his past fame and his past endeavors, that Hugh Hefner is going
to get anything he wants.
They think he lives in a mansion full of playboy bodies.
Right, and he doesn't.
That's ancient history.
He probably lives in a nursing home.
But that's okay.
Tom Brady 19.
Rod Jeremy and Brittany Spears are tied.
That is the most disgusting.
We got to break that tie immediately.
Get them separated.
Johnny Depp 8.
Who is this?
Who's this thing?
I never was in the heavy metal.
I didn't really like it.
I wasn't famous here.
I'm fascinated by rap and by hip hop.
I think there's a lot of poetry.
Are you kidding, Carrie?
You talk about Andrew.
You talk about a lot of social energy in it.
And I think you better listen to it.
Pretty careful.
Oh, God.
I like him good in the monsters, though.
He was great.
No, no, seriously.
I'm only going to vote for Carrie 20 or 30 times
because we've got to get rid of Bush.
But Carrie just, he leaves me very, very limp.
Johnny Depp 8.
George W. 7.
Donald Trump 7.
Peter North 6.
He started to make a little move on Ron Jeremy.
And wait till he catches him.
Alex Rodriguez, a Rod's got six.
But there's the Pennsylvania of our poll.
Bush 46.
Carrie 40.
Nader 3.
Is that pathetic?
I mean, Gore 1, Pennsylvania.
Bush 46.
Carrie 40.
Nader 3.
And Pennsylvania.
Maryland Carrie 48.
Bush 43.
Nader don't show.
Well, this is interesting.
They just showed those two.
That's it.
That's all we're getting while that was a good start.
Uh, Libra and James 5.
Rupert Murdock 5.
Michael Douglas 5.
Brad Pitt 3.
Ricky Martin 3.
Miguel Cabrera 3.
William Hong 1.
And look at all the people that don't have any.
I always love it when people call in their facts
and he's suggestions.
And they get nothing.
Why in Heisenberg, Louis McGill, Rush Limbaugh,
Pat Robertson, and that's a pair of these.
Well, look at that.
And he wrote paradise on there.
There's no e on the end of that.
Oh, so.
And Joy Butterfucko is also got none of the two already won.
Well, there's Al Franken.
Look at that.
He's got that microphone all set up there in front of me.
He's talking in on the area, but he's a,
I guess, doing a dry run.
That's on Air America, which they've used today.
Gonna be able to hear it in South Florida.
No.
Can hear how it's stirring in South Florida.
No.
Can hear anything in the show worth a while?
No.
But anyway, we got the Marlin game.
That's worth a while, man.
That's worth an hour and ten minutes getting out of here.
What a beautiful thing.
We love the Marlins.
They're the best.
WDQA and Hello.
Yes.
This is Gov.
Yeah, okay.
WDQA and Hello.
Hey, can we still say it's not all on Air?
I'll check.
We'll check with West Coast.
WDQA and Hello.
Yeah, Dale.
It's gotta be Jack Pickle.
It gets the Web and it can actually look crazy.
Good choice.
What's not to like?
Jack Nichols and gets to all the Laker games for free, I'm sure.
Jack Nicholsson.
Got it.
We got it.
Give it.
5670560.
£560.
Tomorrow course is the big day.
A lot of this is probably why Muff and Clarence are so nervous
while they squeeze each other frantically, even more so than usual.
Because tomorrow at 11.30 in the morning, that trend comes out.
Now, it's not a whole rating book.
You do understand for your rating students out there in the audience.
It's just a trend.
It's the second trend.
That is correct.
But it's two thirds of the winner book.
These ratings operate just never stop in the major markets.
Just keep rolling, rolling, just like CCR rolling.
And so we got like December January and February coming out tomorrow.
And we're gonna be dropping off that real bad November.
We want to find out if we got any audience coming back.
And if not, we'll just play some music.
Right.
A couple of years more music.
So that way they don't have to worry about any dirty words and all these bleeps and s***.
All this neurosis and psychosis going on.
Everybody can just sit back and relax a little bit.
WQM, hello.
WQM, hello.
Hi, now, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Well, we got another exemplary of why you should never encourage your parents to idolize
through Tired Sports Heroes.
Did you hear what Paul Ronning said?
No, I did not.
Oh, God.
He says that the Notre Dame should drop its admission requirement in order to allow blacks
to be able to come and play football there.
In other words, blacks are too stupid to get into Notre Dame.
Blacks play the Notre Dame.
What does that mean?
There's plenty of blacks playing Notre Dame.
Of course there, but he just, he's saying there aren't enough and the black athlete is much better
and we can't get him if we can't see the lower standards.
Well, touch on Jesus, man.
Touch down Jesus.
I don't think that's going to happen with Paul Harning and probably a lay odds.
He's a silly old daughtering fool, OK?
He's a silly old guy.
He was one of those packers pack in the old days.
Can we still say that?
No.
Gina Fort Lauderdale says, subject for the pool.
How many, I don't get it.
That's one of your ten women listeners I'd like to help out getting a few more women
onto your pool.
Here are a few suggestions.
I don't like all of the following, but I'm sure somebody does.
I don't understand that.
She's got a list.
Pick the ones you want in this regard.
The rest.
Thanks for all the support of stopFCC.com and move on.
Now to our junior Roberts, Paris Hilton, Haydor, Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman, Oprah Winfrey.
This one is for George's.
Oprah Winfrey?
That's a good one to put on here, right?
She's worried.
She's got a billion dollars.
She has no talent.
She's loaded and has a lot of money too.
I think she's a guy.
I really do.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, this guy that she's been supposedly going to marry for last days.
He's like a...
Yeah, he's a male beard, I think.
Yeah, she's a guy.
I think she's a guy.
I mean, I don't know that perfect.
Now let me ask you this.
Here's the question.
I don't want to answer it's a rhetorical question.
What does Mark Foley, Charlie, Chris and Oprah Winfrey have in common?
20-0-560 WDQM.
Hay, spring it a savings right now and save like never before.
And a new car, a truck from Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead.
They're on US-1 just 20 minutes off of the A-36.
Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead is worth the drive no matter where you're hanging it out,
because they're going to save you thousands on great new Toyota's.
Check out these great leases.
An O4 camera or a 4-runner for just 269 a month for 48 months.

QM Robert Cheere, who's one of my favorite columnist rights,
Bush puts a cancer on the presidency.
Watergate insider calls this White House scary.
Worst and watergate, the title of the new book by John Dean Richard Nixon's White House Council,
is a depressingly accurate measure of the checanery of the Bush Cheney Cabal.
According to Dean, who began his political life at the age of 29 as the Republican Council
in the House Judiciary Committee before being recruited by Nixon,
this administration is truly scary and given the times we live in,
frighteningly dangerous.
And when it comes to lies and cover up, the Bush crowd makes the Nixon administration look like amateurs.
As Dean writes, they've created the most secretive presidency of my lifetime
far worse than during Watergate.
Dean knows what he's talking about.
He was the one who dare to tell Nixon in 1973 that the web of lies surrounding the Watergate
breaking of the Democratic Party headquarters and formed a cancer on the presidency.
When Dean went public about that conversation, the Nixon White House smeared him as a liar.
Fortunately, the conversation has been taped and Dean was vindicated.
The dark side of the current White House was on full display last week
when top officials of the Bush administration took to the airwaves
to destroy the credibility of a man who had honorably served President Reagan, Clinton, and both Bushes.
The character assassination of Richard Clark, the former White House anti-terrorism chief,
was far more worrisome than Nixon's smears of Dean because it concerned not petty crime and pursuit of partisan political ambition,
but rather the attempt to deceive the nation and the world as to the causes of the 9-11 assault upon our national security
and to justify an unnecessary war in Iraq.
First, Bushes ate suggested that Clark had invented the meeting in which Clark said the President pressured him to find a link
between the 9-11 attack and Iraq, ignoring Clark's insistence that intelligence agencies had concluded that no such link existed.
But on Sunday, national security adviser Kym Lee's arrest was forced to admit that Bush had pressed Clark on an Iraq connection.
This backed up early assertions by former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill as the Bushes of Session with Iraq
from the very first days of his administration at the expense of focusing on Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.
But the Bush lines didn't work this time, maybe just because too many veterans of the U.S. intelligence community
are finding their voices and are wanting to announce an administration that is seriously under my the nation's security.
They are speaking out as 23 former CIA and other defense intelligence agents did and Robert Greenwald's devastating documentary uncovered.
They have stepped forward as did David Kay, Bushes' former chief weapons inspector in Iraq.
This is an administration that's been dominated by the neo-conservative ideologues who can then the logical restrain of the first Bush administration on foreign policy as it be trail of the national interest.
These neo-cons have made a horrible mess of things, but that gives them no pause.
They went to war with a nation that had no weapons of mass destruction and few connections to terrorism, but have cruddled Pakistan,
which sponsored the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and which recently was revealed as the source of nuclear weapons technology for North Korea, Iran and Libya.
The president's team is wrong to believe itself, where just lies can continue to law the global public,
Nixen's lies want him a second election but then he lost the country.
Bush smiles better than Nixen, but when the lies have exposed the smile turns into a character revealing smirk.
That happened last week when the White House released photos of a skit performed for the amusement of jaded media heavyweights in which the president pretended to look under his desk for the missing weapons of mass destruction.
This may have immune to cynical audience, but to the general public, the carefully lip-synced policy pronouncements of the man who cried wolf has morphed into a sick joke,
where I trodber cheer in the early time.

man. Good Lord. Listen, I've got one for your party. I think though he built the respect
of the public by calling and bitching out Mowen Gildey this morning. I think they like
him a little better now. Yeah. Wow. Let's see how they do when the dolphin season starts
to do it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The fact that G. Feetler was still on that roster. I find that
sewing uncomfortable. It's basically as just to me they're going to forfeit this season.
Well, they have to have a quarterback controversy. It seems and this is part of it. But enough
for it. I think what I'd like to be for a year before we went to prison. I'd like to
be John Gotti for one year. Yeah. In South Florida. I come down and I take over the
club truck business. I get 50 points on a dollar and take over the club business in this

Oh, wait. Oh, wait a minute of business, too. Okay. Good luck, Pally. The problem is
John Gotti famous living person. Too late. Just missed. Oh, and guess what I saw last night.
I give up. What did you see? On the biography channel. I love that channel. I just absolutely
I'm obsessed with that channel. It took a channel. In fact, what's on it right now? Let
me take a peek during the day time. Wallace Simpson. Is she can do a Kevin Wallace? Wallace
Simpson. Oh, that's she was the Duchess of Windsor. Remember King Edward the eighth gave
up the throne so he could be the queen or she could be. Something like that. I don't
know about them. Queens. Yeah, you remember that. You read about that. Well, anyway, but
so last night I saw the biography of Chuck Veris. Oh, yeah, I heard about him. His name
was Charles. Oh, dang. Charles Hirsch, Veris. Okay. His father was a dentist. They were
very Jewish and his mother, her family was loaded, but then the depression had lost all
their money. But anyway, so now what was the name of the movie that they made about him
the gun show movie? No, no, no, about his autobiography. They bought the autobiography.
It was a George Clooney, a directed and was in it. Right. The one where he's a spy. Right.
The one where he claimed to be and nobody knows whether it's true or not. He was a CIA
spy and killed 33 people. Because I had seen that movie, which is the I had heard of those
rumblings about how he claimed all of these things. But anyway, so the biography thing was
really great last night. It was a good show. And of course they talked about the dating
game and how any of it's day back in the day, how revolutionary and outrageous those
shows were. And it made me think a little bit about all of these things that are going
on right now. Yeah, during the break, check your email. I sent you a funny thing. A funny
thing. Yeah, I admit it links to other funny things that I might buy. Oh, well, you know,
muffler saying this morning, he's about a funny thing. Let him 56 at 560 W.Q.A. Let me

And look all this is 4205.
And you lay man.
At a Homeland Security Donnerage, inviting you to boot duct tape on your radio when I
raised the warning color to Bing for the Neil Rogers 12 to 1 hour. Coming soon to
a cinema near you, it's the greatest romantic comedy in the history of film. You, Grant,
is a bum-ling to it. Well, if I may, I hope I'm not being too
forward. The London Zyzeh's a bum-ling to it is so light like that no more films should
ever be made as they would only fail in comparison to this brilliant piece of twit-headed
tightcasting.
If I may be so good as to ask you and stand it on time, I'm track it by standing here
in the middle of the street, but I'm very much like to ask you, if you see only one
Hugh Grant movie this year, then you certainly won't need to see this one because he's playing
the exact same 20 plays in all his movies.
I'm glad that you've been here with me and well, there's something I've been meaning
to, and what I need to say, it might be quite fetching.
And you think Elizabeth Herby left him because of that whole divine brown deal? No, she
left him because Hugh Grant is a bum-ling to it, now playing in Selected Cities.
I do rather hope you come to see me in a bum-ling twit-head. That is to say, if you don't mind
my being somewhat cheeky.
Oh, for the love of God, let's do shot!
Oh, well, I think I suppose that.
That's a cute thing, I'm trying to print it out right now, I think it's your printout
when it's out, but anyway, he may already just send me about his president Bush, a
homo.
Yeah, and he wakes to the Betty Bowers merchandise. There's some great things there.
Are they really?
Yeah, T-R.
Now, are they on auction now on thewqm.com?
No, but we can link them.
I think we just invented another revenue stream for our friends in Beasy Opener and Naples.
This is cute, that is our saving homosexuals, B-A-S-A, eights and eights.
That's a beautiful thing.
How many pages is this George?
Good, golly Miss Molly.
Let's see, Teresa Hines for years is somebody here I'd like to be Teresa Hines.
Okay?
Well, they got to start slow, but then maybe they'll catch up.
Anyway, his president Bush, a homo, back to their saving homosexuals, asked what conservative
Christians throughout America are demanding to know.
January 2nd, and she had the thing in here where he was holding hands with Prince Bondar,
I guess they left that out.
January 2nd, 2004, Mr. Bush wondered over doing Mr. Scott Reed's senior strategist at
Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin's chat with the Prime Minister.
Mr. Reed introduced himself into his hands with President Bush.
The President chuffled, well, you got a pretty face, he told his surprise, Mr. Reed.
He wasn't done.
You got a pretty face, you were a good looking guy, better looking in my spot anyway,
you mean Scott McCullen?
Wow.
That's from the Toronto Globe and Mail, January 16th, 2004, I remember talking about it
at the time.
Remember?
Yes, I did.
It says, we at Baptist saving homosexuals have, enough so-called gays with a blunt love
of Jesus to know how to spot demons across a crowded sale at Sacks.
Outside of Italian shoes, nothing sends up a rainbow-covered flare that you're dealing
with a flaming homosexual more reliably.
They went a man breakfastly, gushes the word, fabulous.
Absolutely correct.
When a Christian lady hears this word outside of her herselon or floor, she instinctively
reaches for the Bible tracks in her purse because she knows a Nancy boy is within throwing
range.
Three months after the World Trade Center towers went down George W. Bush quoted, it's been
a fabulous year for Laura and me.
Therefore, conservative Christians throughout the land have become increasingly uncomfortable
as they doodifully mask each awkward pause with a flurry of plight of flaws and yells
of more warriors during President Bush's somewhat laborious attendance speaking.
The alternative there may have mastered the Queen's English, our President's vocabulary
calls to mind any number of Queen's English.
Even our least vigilant Republican social commas knows of notice that Mr. Bush has been
peppering his otherwise delightful litany of patriotic jingoism and pleasantly embroidered
CIA intelligence recaps with the Affeminate Maiden call, fabulous, three giddy syllables
that are tenement to poorly cooling.
Hello, it's Sailor.
That is absolutely unbelievable.
Fabulous.
And if I look for it, I can probably fire.
Hey, Sailor.
And we'll prevail because we're a fabulous nation and we're a fabulous nation because
we're nation full of fabulous people, quote from George Bush in Atlanta January 31,
2002.
And it goes on.
This goes on forever.
It says everyone in our pretty President's acquaintance appears to be doing a fabulous job.
Again, his lovely wife Laura, what a fabulous job she is doing.
His brother in Collusive, Arab Herring, she had, he's done a fabulous job and on an
encore as a whole list.
Cute.
We're going to put that on a website.
Sure, why not?
BettyBowers.com.
Along with Terry Nunn.
BettyBowers.com, when we put a link to it or we can put that up, whatever we want, whatever
we want to do, we'll do it.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Tomorrow's a big day.
We're going to hopefully tomorrow have the deal where you can start to get some money
into that newspaper ad for, say, stop by FCC.com.
Save our free speech.
And also tomorrow, of course, 1130, that trend comes out.
All right.
And of course, that, no, seriously, that's why some people are very walking around on eggshells.
Some people who should be no better than to get over emotional about these things, but
nevertheless.
I sure hope they're not counting on us anymore.
Now that they curtail all of our free speech so badly, don't be counting on us.
We're just doing the best we can under very limited circumstances.
If you could be any famous living person in a, for one year, who would it be we asked
today on Eurajus.com, a highly unpopular poll question to that?

Probably.
Thank you.

Why don't you look up IMDb?
Just look up Johnny Depp with a bio.
What'll tell you who he's married to?
How long can this take?
How many minutes?
Stop 30 minutes.
It is possibly take to fight out the name of Johnny Depp's wife,
which we all of us already know who he's married to.
Right?
We are.
Let's do it by presence of elimination today.

That's the last time.
You know something?
Next time they pull that, I'm just going to get them walk into the other room.
I'm going to turn on my TV and there's to dump my feet up on a coffee table.
And you'll let me know when they're gone, okay?
Because I'm not going to do that no more.
Right before the show.
That would just say something.
I have to go through a long, agonizing thing about a bleep over a word
that isn't even being said.
A bleep over silence.
The Nessoparades.
The Nessoparades.
The Nessoparades.
Are you sure that's how you pronounce your name?

Just fantasize about this all day long.
It will come to you finally.
All right.
I mean, you might, it will be a little slow.
Here's another one.
Not a dumbest one.
I don't want to use them all up in one day.
It's going to be really interesting in the state of Florida.
We get this thing, you know, because state by state.
All the way over to you have the prohibition on game urges.
But if that issue really becomes like a hot button kind of thing in Florida.
And if people decide they want to start like marrying all over the place,
besides in Key West, of course, where we know there are a bunch of heathens anyway.
But what's going to happen when Charlie Christ might have to make a ruling on that?
Huh?
I don't know.
You might have to call up Dick Cheney and see how he did it.
Hey, how's your new year's resolution going?
It's April 1, tomorrow, no fooling, but boy, a third or a quarter,
fourth of the year's gone already.
And you're still fat.
And you're not making any progress, Ladi, I guarantee.
I can relate to that.
Well, it's just too darn difficult.
The stupid love of those diet programs.
But with balance, for life, they make it easy.
Because you don't have to go into the supermarket and figure out what to buy.
First of all, because they do all that for you.
There's no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning,
no counter-recoding, no carbohydrate counting for sure.
Balance for life is based on Dr. Barry Sears' The Zone Diet,
and they deliver right to your door a little black sack.
And there's nothing like a little black sack because inside all the delicious fresh goodies
that you want for the entire day to keep you full and happy,
five feedings don't last.
Three meals, two snacks every day, right to your doorstep.
People are losing an average of 12 to 18 pounds a month for balance for life.
The Zone Diet is proving to lower your blood sugar, lower high cholesterol,
and high blood pressure too.
So what's not to like?
And if you ever wanted to try the South Beach Diet, here's your chance.
Because balance for life is the closest thing you'll ever find.
It's the only meal delivery company that offers you menu choices.
They let you go from phase one to phase three of the South Beach Diet.
The most difficult thing you'll have to do all week is just fill out that little menu.
That's it, you fast it back to them, and you pick up from two choices for every meal and snack
on the meal all week long.
So if you're tired of all the other fad diets, you haven't lost the weight yet.
You're over to yourself to try balance for life.
It could be the difference between being out there and losing that weight or being in a box.
Feel the difference to you to results on the scale right away.

Prop 17 at 5.60 WQM home to free and used to be landed at the brave in the free speech
finale anymore.
But we have some really nifty options that we got on our QM.com website.
Yeah.
We got the Marlins on Dec. 12, 15th in the second year.
Beloved World Champion for the Marlins.
Brad Penney, Josh Beckett, Miguel Cabrera, Michael O'Leary, Lowell Thomas, Old Jack
McKinley, just turned 110 today.
Happy birthday Jack.
Let's see, Tom says for one year I'd like to be Tommy Lee.
He's not Mirady Flays drums, he's rich.
And with that watch out, ladies, PS for all that I could live with the tattoos.
I just go on Tom, Tommy Lee.
And of course he was with the panel Lee back in the day, which he actually looked human
for a little bit for about how many seconds?
3rd man.
Yeah.
That's bad.
Oh, it's speaking to the Marlins, got some bad news.
Oh, no, don't be the bearer of ill-tidings.
What?
The game isn't re-doubted, is it?
No.
Oh, not that bad.
Oh.
The Florida Marlins may be World Champions, but they're not likely to get state help with building
a new stadium this year.
Dang.
It's certainly dead for this year's Senate President Jim King, Republican and Jacksonville
said yesterday it's too late in the game.
It would look like we're just pushing something through.
Now, we've got something you can push through.
King's comments coming only a day before legislature will honor the team for his World
Title, a didn't dampen the hopes of team officials who still see a $60 million state sales
tax break as the key to building a new home team home.
It's important for the future of baseball and South Florida that we hold out hopes
that David Sanson and the insoli president, he said his goal is to keep the team in Florida,
and that goal will not go away till the gap goes out on the last day of the session.
Still, King's opposition will likely kill any effort this year to help the team despite
Governor Jeff Bush's support to the idea.
If King says it's dead, if he's going to block it, it's dead.
Said House Majority Leader Marco Rubio, Republican of Miami, noted there are fewer than four weeks
left in the session if nothing happens this session will be because the team started
too dang late.
Oh, that's right, Jeff Cohenine.
How they come back to the scene of the crime, Jeff Cohenine, one of the original Marlins,
I think, when they had a very original team?
Yeah.
That was there.
I used to be a Marlin fan for about five minutes until I went out to the ballpark and
listened to the idiots who went to the games and oh, God.
He's got to go back and tag up at first before he takes his lead again before the kickers
scratches his private.
Oh, they had no clue what it's all about.
That's why one of the reasons why nobody shows up at the Marlin Games is because unless
they're like, you know, winning every game, plus it's boring.
When Juan Pierre, the stolen base leader from 2003, several Marlins officials and players
will be in tell I have seen today to be honored by the House and Senate along with David
Samson, Jeffrey Luria, Larry Beanfest, Blindfest and Jack McKibb.
Don't forget your felding, Jack.

Still with E on there, Josh.

Why?
He's married to Johnny.

Type the instructions to the air if they're to change it.

But why is that?
Come on, Eric.
Listen up the first rangel.
Look at there.
Listen up the co-tales.
You militant, Nazi, basted up there in Orlando.

Yes, sir.
Yeah, I've been one for your list.
Okay.
I can't take the guy's name, but instead of Hugh Heppner,
the young guy who started that girl's on wild business,
the tapes that you see on TV.
I don't know.
What's the name of that young guy that started the girls
from a wild business, George?
I don't know.
I have no idea.
He's split in the high life.
Yeah.
And that would not mind being him for a year.
Okay, well, let's find out what his name is,
then we can put him on a pool.
Or he just put out there, the young guy that started that girl.
Oh, God, wild thing.
That guy could find out what his name is before he calls.
That would be a really good idea.
5670560, pound 566 on a AT&T.
Are the kids out of school today or what?
Is it just all the pills that got split around?
No, it's just, yeah, the ship came.
Somebody dropped a load on the ground.
They just fell all over the place and people are picking them up

Bob Pouban and the old Bokeh Bronze Angry with me right now,
because I should know that right off the top of my head.
The cheater, wasn't that it?
I don't know.
He'll confirm it.
Oh, come.
Where's my book?
Give me seven seconds.
By now you're aware that the Federal Communications Commission.
That's great.
Every time we have a little pause, we'll play a word block.
Because Duff has got a mental block.
Be sure I put a lot of briefs in there too.
Okay, even though the words aren't being spoken,
that has got to be what I thought that the auction yesterday was the low point in history over QA.
And this was so much worse when you told me that,
last night, I got an email from Bokeh Bronze last night from undercocked.com.
Yeah, I'd forgotten about it.
Bob Pouban and the in-man, the cheater, it was number 12 in February, 1969, 1966.
I wish I had it here, I would play it.
In fact, I bet you it's on that one, one of those ones.
During the next break, I'm going to look around to see if I got it.
Remember we did the one-hit wonder thing and we're sorry we did it?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, I had fun.
Bob Pouban and the cheater.
Oh yeah, I enjoyed it, the audience hated it though.
It's like this pool today, there's nothing wrong with it.
We don't get it, what does it mean?
And obviously a lot of them aren't getting it,
which is why so many of them want to be who have nearing everybody else who's getting late a lot,
because basically they ain't.
26th past November, like a Marlon game in and about a half an hour boy.
