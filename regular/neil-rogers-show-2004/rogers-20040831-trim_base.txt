To remind her for our radio listeners that the end of the world is going to come next Tuesday at 4 p.m.
and the Department of Health has requested homeowners to unplug all electrical appliances, turn off radios and TV sets, and disconnect gas stoves and furnaces.
The post office recommends that you mail early in the day, and for those with automobiles, alternate side of the street parking will be suspended.
That's the end of the world next Tuesday at 4 p.m. mark it down.
Tonight from the network that brought you homage in the city comes the reality show that's just not kosher. Jewish in the country.
Hey, once with the night he's screaming chicken enough with a cock of doodle in the stool, I'm up!
Follow a nice Jewish boy from Yonfers who has to spend two weeks on a farm in Iowa.
So Mr. Cowell make with the milk already while we're young. Your foundation grab us!
Me there when he traces Yamago for on trucker hats.
You must meet the driver tractor! What the way looks like Mr. Greenberg jeans!
It's Jewboy, turn plowboy on Jewish in the country.
So what is this volumajou going to? That means not retail.
Right after SkyTrack's circumstances, Friday on UPN.
Send away to 560 WQAM, happy Tuesday to you and here we are after the best hour at Stern and don't tell you start.
Oh, hey Mrs. you better cut your blessings. Sit down here and shut up.
Such as they may be. That's right, sit down and dummy up.
Anyway, we got no ball game today. We got almost four hours today again.
So we're getting some of that time back that some people are very distraught that we've lost.
I have some bad news for you.
Yeah, hey Goldberg will not be back tomorrow.
Really? I have some better news. He might be back Thursday.
I see. We just don't know.
I...
He's still out west. He's still in Vegas punching his guts out.
And these people still here can't get off the dime and can't decide which hand to wipe with.
But then again, that's Greg.
You don't understand your close personal friend, Greg?
Mm-hmm. But...
Right.
Because one of the things that anybody who's been in radio for like more than ten minutes knows,
the audience loves one thing. You know what that is?
Consistency.
So...
Yeah.
So mix it up.
People are creatures of habit. Even people are watching TV.
Like they turn on NBC at 1130 and they want to see that Slickjaw, the Slackjaw, the Goopball.
Okay?
They turn on CBS at 1130 and they want to see David Letterman throwing the pencil through the window.
They want to see certain things that are certain.
Even in the morning when they get up for whatever reason.
They want to see that...
Oh, I heard cut Matt Lauer guy.
They want a schedule in chaos.
No, they don't.
They want musical hosts.
I know they do not.
Oh.
So one thing that maybe somebody ought to mention to Greg is that the audience likes a little bit of stability
and have some idea who they'll...
I mean, when they don't even know inside the building who's going to be on...
I'm Thursday.
That's a tell you something.
Shouldn't it...
Yeah.
...to tell you a lot.
Maybe Geldy's going to be back.
I sure hope not.
Now he's not coming back.
Maybe D.Fo is coming.
Now he ain't coming.
Would that Cornball crap at his?
Oh, and by the way, somebody won't return his phone calls.
So here's the Apple result.
Let's play like a little child.
Remember that poem you took?
How could you forget about Schmier, the Queer, and all that shirt?
All those favorite childhood games.
Right.
How about Heiden's Seek?
Was that on there?
A variation.
Did it kick the can?
Yes.
We had variations of Heiden's Seek on there.
Spend a lot of time in the can.
Like, I did last night.
I woke up three o'clock this morning.
I can't say with wild, massive diarrhea from just being here two days.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't say that though because that has to do with, you know what?
Kind of activity.
Right.
That's right.
Right.
And of course, there's something unnatural and grotesque and unclean about that.
So that's another thing there.
But you're early decided we can't talk about?
How about sweating?
Can we talk about sweat?
As long as it's not body function.
Oh, but sweat.
That's bad.
Correct them.
Okay.
Let's take a look at yesterday's poem.
Can I say poem?
1853 vote.
How panicky are you about hurricane, Francis?
Now before I give you the result of the poem, let me just give a kudo to the...
rational weather furry, Miss Kamala on Channel 7.
I never thought I'd be given kudos to anybody on Channel 7.
And by the way, is there anybody's street works on that channel?
Oh, wow.
What a fruit farm.
No, seriously, that is the most, um, thinking, amazing closet.
And the door, and the door is wide open evidently.
At any rate, uh, Miss Kamala is covering a Francis thing, I think.
Rationally, you know, like don't get everybody get panicky and don't go out to deep end.
And then no kid too confident if it goes, uh, one way, because we still really don't know.
Even as in now, we don't know.
It's picked up to 135 mile hour.
And it's going to be heavy duty somewhere.
It's going to hit something.
My wife asked the Bahamas.
Oh, God.
Wouldn't that be bad?
If her wiped out all our close personal listeners, it's in the Bahamas.
It's just absolutely a blue-tees people off the face of the earth.
So we didn't have to protect their foamy or casino crap they got going down there.
We despised the Bahamas on this show.
Oh, I better not say that.
That's right.
They might be a whole nation like you.
Yeah, everybody has a sponsor and come to find out.
How do you think we're making all this seal and all this cash?
Right.
So like I said, we like the Bahamas a lot.
Not.
Not I can't stand them.
I just don't like to hold the old out there.
But so we just don't know.
But anyway, Bill Kamala has done a reasonable and he's got a weather cone.
Yeah.
Why don't I want to talk too much about his cone, although.
Hey, by the way, so burrow, Phil.
But he's got a cone like the one on the weather channel.
It's like a regular weather cone.
Now I'm the hysterical network on channel four with Brian Lecras, the hysterical weather fairy.
He's got an ice cream cone.
He doesn't have like a regular cone.
He's just like the round at the tip.
I thought it would look like a Nike swoop.
He's just like round and rounded at the tip.
That's what that's all about.
But at any rate, no, seriously.
And as a result, he's got this like, it looks like an ice cream cone.
So the whole thing is rounded.
So it encompasses all of us.
I mean, he had a, no matter where you are.
There's no way.
Brian's wicked lab on channel four.
He's got your like in there.
He's got your covered.
So and the people are really frost my ass.
Are you gray robbers?
There's one word.
And you're driving still sucks.
I'm actually not yesterday.
I, this morning.
There's no point in getting frustrated because I'm not going to be here that long.
But it's just, it's just amazing to me.
There's this bitch at the turnpike toll plaza there by the stadium.
Well, she decides she's going to the express lane with a dollar bill.
And my luck, I'm right behind this bitch.
And there's about a half a dozen people behind me.
They've got things to do.
They're going to work there.
I get and taking their kids to school.
Whatever they're doing, they have a life.
But this broad.
Her problem is I think I have no brain.
There's no brain.
She pulls up to the basket.
And she rolls down the window.
And she's got a dollar bill on her hand.
And she's kind of like waving it.
Like maybe magically some, a hand is going to come from the basket.
Remember Michael Cain, right hand.
A magic hand is going to come out of the basket and give her a change and like open up the thing,
the gate so she can go through.
And now people, and she don't, you know, there's no room behind me to back up to let her out,
which is no chance of that if that hour.
The morning's a lot of traffic.
And so she's sitting there and waving and gesticulating toward the toll booth.
The person can't see her anyway.
And there's also got their own fish to fry because there are people actually paying
what and change in the right lane.
So now the corns are honking and people are getting all bent out of shape.
And so she gets out of the car and she's got some other fish, probably her girlfriend in there with her.
Actually something brought about, I would say like in her 40s.
Nasty looking, hostile looking.
Looked a little like Meg Gordon.
I've had a little enough that hostile.
I don't believe it.
But anyway, and as she goes through the toll and she gets her four quarters and comes running back,
and takes her sweet time getting in her car and getting on through there.
Now, and I know it would be a nightmare to be behind this bitch.
She gets to the corner out there, the one that I hate.
That's the only part, I just, I don't like that part of coming here.
And there ought to be a light there, but that would make too much sense.
At 441 in the, whatever the name of that, what is that?
Dan Marie No Drive or whatever that street is.
What other state in the comes out onto, how do I do, I was very wrong.
And she's going to make the left turn.
Well, she starts making the left turn.
The other problem is there's somebody coming the other way off I was very making a left turn ahead of her.
So she'd then your wife's out and is blowing at horn and just furious.
And that was some of the best driving I saw this morning.
But at any rate, here's the full result.
How panicky are you about Hurricane Francis?
18, oh, so I started to say about you idiots that are running to a home depot.
Plantation floored, I'm almost embarrassed to say that I lived there while I live in the acres, okay?
So I'm not in plantation proper.
But we were featured nationally on the, on the weather network.
Yeah, bunch of goofballs in plantation rushing to the stores 10 o'clock last night.
They're at the home depot and they're at the public center at Windixie and they're stocking up on the plywood and on the generators and they're getting the bottle water.
Now, it's okay if you're a little bit nervous, although you know, you really could wait till tomorrow.
Do we have a better idea?
By tomorrow at this time, we'll have a much better idea where this thing going and whether it's worth getting all by that side.
All the panicky people will have bought everything.
All the panicky people will have bought up every bottle of water that's ever been invented.
Every sheet of plywood that was ever cut, they'll have bought up every two by four, every piece of masking tape that was ever manufactured.
All the water out of your water closet.
Right, because these people are selfish is basically what it boils down to and then you see the people with these enormous carts full of mostly water and canned goods.
Don't forget peaches, man.
No, the only problem with peaches is they probably have like some kind of a...
What?
Laksative effect?
Oh, yeah, like that.
Oh, the canned peaches they spend, the head of the preservatives and that's a mention of the sugar content.
So I think if you eat too much out of the can, you'll be spending a lot of time in the can and if we do have unfortunately a nasty hit here, which I'll be long gone.
But if it did happen, maybe your water ain't going to be working.
Right, you might have to go out and like do some business in the backyard or some sugar because how are you going to flush it?
Very carefully, I guess.
I don't know.
So I'll be eating too many peaches is my best suggestion to you.
I got a really good idea.
I don't want to create a run.
I don't want to create the runs.
Although I had my own last nights.
From being here.
But if you go to like 7-11 or right out of convenience store, they got them great pickle bags and sausages.
Oh, yeah.
Now those, if you have like a little formaldeau around the house, or maybe like what's that other stuff that you clean your ears out with?
Oh, a proxie.
A hundred and a proxie.
Just put it in a big jug.
There you go.
And you can keep them pickled eggs and sausages and uh...
It's also dill pickles, I think they sold to.
You can keep those for years, Brian.
Yeah.
Oh, you can keep them in some nice brine.
In fact, maybe Josh Beckett will come over to the house and do something in that bottle for you.
Yeah.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
He'll give you a little bit of color.
And anyway, so that's my suggestion.
It's just calm down and quit being a bunch of selfish bastards.
I can't stand it.
Oh no, we sell what happened with Charlie.
We don't want to be, we lived through Andrew.
Well, guess what, so did I.
Yeah, we were all here.
We were all here.
Many of us.
And the fact of the matter is, uh...
Use a little common sense and like Miss Kamal, whether very junior says on Channel 7.
Just relax.
Just quit being so freaking hysterical and over the top like so many of you can be, okay?
Remember, what was the one that Mayor, oh, it's big and a Mayor penis-pican?
You don't vote for him today.
If you're gonna vote, you got to hold 7 o'clock tonight, the polls are open.
Where we voting for in that race, who's running against the Betty Caster?
Oh, Peter Doich.
Okay.
Peter Doich is a good man.
He's great.
Did you see the spots?
Yeah.
Okay.
Vote for Peter Doich, please.
Do not vote for Betty Caster World because Caster World has a lack of an effect.
And with a potential hurricane coming, we don't want to be as spread into much time in the can, on the can, eat out of a can, right?
Right.
Don't forget about Betty Caster World.
Peter Doich, no chance.
Here is a guy that Al Gore said was the most devious, lying piece of crap politician in the history of mankind.
Alex penis-picania.
Here's a guy that, like, not only let him down, but stabbed him right through the heart.
Here is a man who is largely responsible for giving us the bunch of fascists that we have running the country right now, the bunch of Nazis, which, by the way, your president says we probably can't win the war on terror.
I heard that.
Oh, man.
Oh, brother.
But we can make them unpopular.
We spend a lot of money and get hell of a broadcast and back to hell and then people.
We can make them not as popular as they once were.
Right.
But at any rate, so we got all this stuff coming and the people out there are going over the top, which we're not too happy about.
Peter Doich, today you got plenty of time, those seven o'clock tonight, not Megapena's sub-picania.
Who also made that back to her dear, live through his teeth with Mickey Harrison.
Of course, if we wouldn't have had the triple A arena, we might not have had the MTV Music Awards, although probably we could have had it right there in sunrise, which is a much better arena, right?
And a much better center location where people can actually go.
Who's speaking with?
But at any rate, here's the poll result from yesterday.
How panicky are you about hurricane Francis?
Oh, my God.
1874 votes.
Not too bad.
I'll wait and see where it's really going.
Now, for once in your lives, you actually made some sense.
That's astonishing that so many people would act so rashally.
Those are not the people who are lined up at home, people who are low as right now, or lined up at public, so wait and buy up all the water.
And then they showed one of the stories I don't remember whether it wasn't, it's not relevant what it was.
It was one of the supermarkets.
This was last night.
And you know where they have the bottled water and the can.
It was already gone.
It's already gone.
Last night was frickin' Monday if my calendar's right.
Monday.
All gone.
Bye.
Panic.
Baby. Panic.
That's my best suggestion to you.
Okay, win it out.
Panic.
This go crazy.
Anyone know why it's good?
Why?
Because there's nothing else going on here.
Oh well, besides the fact that I don't know how you people do it.
It is so hot and humid.
Mm-hmm.
10.30 last night, I'm watching a weather channel and it's 85 degrees right?
10.30 at night.
Survive it.
Oh, distractions.
A lot of distractions.
I go out to get my newspapers this morning.
You could hollish out there.
Just walking out for 30 seconds to pick up the two fish wrappers, which by the way they're waiting nothing to read them.
Oh, you're complaining too much to get along.
Just I'm just telling you the truth.
You know, they spent a lot of money on this station.
Who's that?
They hurled in the sunsets.
That's right.
They'll hate them like poison, okay?
In their case, we make an exception.
We don't like them at all.
Especially the Harold.
Sunsets and small potatoes.
Yeah.
It's hard to hate them because they're like the nil ice cream, you know?
But they're Harold.
1874 votes.
Or look at it.
Just hands again.
1880.
1193.
63.5% said, I'll wait and see where it's really going.
And we can still wait another day, right?
Right.
If we're for all you greedy selfish bastards, maybe by Thursday we'd have some more bottled water and some plywood and some generators and things we might actually need.
If, for example, this thing, if it comes, if we get it, it's going to be Saturday.
Today's still only two days.
See, originally they were saying Friday.
Now, if we get to hit, it's going to be Saturday, which some of us will be long gone.
At any rate, what may worry 232?
I'm stocking up now.
Water, batteries, all of these things.
205, 11%.
You're the ones, man.
Selfish, selfish, rotten to the core.
Brian Urkhross has me in a total panic.
180 with his round-shaped cone.
I'm going back out of the bed, 109.
Seriously, when you watch, when we later on today, the whole thing watch.
Every other station that's reporting on it has got a funnel-shaped cone.
That's the area in which this thing might hit.
The natural weather service, Noah, they all have a funnel.
But Brian Urkhross, he's got an ice-cream-shaped cone.
If you're real nice to him, maybe he'll let you lick it.
I'm going back out of the bed, 109.
The shutters are up already, 23 out of nearly 1900 votes.
That's our poll result from yesterday.
And of course, they would say, well, we know that they're going to have a run on it.
That's why we want to get there ahead of them.
I can actually almost understand that.
You know what I mean?
Sure.
Knowing how greedy and selfish some of these people are.
You want to get there a little bit ahead of time because you know that if you wait till Thursday,
the shelves are going to be barren.
They're going to be bad.
So we'll say, oh, bad news.
Death of the day.
How much you didn't know that Dennis Miles died.
Who?
Come on.
The hockey match rhythm guitarist with rapper iced tea's hard rock band body count.
Dennis Miles has died after battle with lymphoma.
You don't know Dennis Miles?
No, right.
Well, how about Jason?
He had a hockey match.
How about Jacques Plunt?
Miles, whose stage name was D-Rock.
Does that help out?
No.
Oh.
He died August 17th in California.
He was 45.
But now that it's August 31, they're just going to run a Thomas Vodet two weeks later.
They wanted to make sure he was really good.
Well, yeah.
They had to poke him a couple days.
Two other members of Vodet kind of already died.
Drummer beat master five to come to leukemia in 1996 and bassist Moussman.
Oh.
Was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2000.
The Moussie man.
Not the one from the drive-by shootings up there in DC and other in the middle of the woods.
But the Moussie man.
DC was the backbone of the body count sounds at iced tea.
Words can't explain how much will Miss D-Rock more as a friend than a band member.
And he's dead.
And you didn't even know it.
You didn't even know what he was.
No, that's not.
Is his name Miles Davis?
Hey, I know.
Something else.
You can see for Miles.
Oh, you can see Shalom Harlow on her website today.
Oh, good.
Behind the Beated Curtain.
One of our favorites.
Is it really?
Well, she's got her eight days to meet.
Oh, my gosh.
I see.
You know where she's from?
Where she was born?
No, I don't.
She was born December 5th, 1973.
This is behind the Beated Curtain on neo-rojrs.com.
If you're over the age of 75 and have many, many legitimate pieces, they have to be stamped and approved by the SS.
They hold them up to the screen.
Right.
Oh, and let me say this.
It's nice to see the Republicans are really bringing all the people up there to speak in the beginning of their convention who are representative of where they're really coming from.
What a joke, you know.
All the ed crotch, you know, that screamer and John McCain, all these moderate Republicans, they're putting their best, you know, in the meantime, the Nazis are having the SS meeting in the back room.
Shalom Harlow was born December 5th, 1973.
It makes her almost 31.
And she was born in Asherwah, Ontario, Canada.
I do like that.
How do you like that? Right down the road from my place, joint.
Shalom, it says here, means peace in Hebrew and his uses of greeting.
And some will look at that and say, wow, what a peace.
Her filmography includes the TV series, The Jewry.
You.
As we speak.
Also, I love your work.
How to lose a guy in 10 days.
Happy here and now.
The salt and sea.
Kate and leopard, Vanille sky.
Head over heels.
Cherry.
Yeah.
There'll be a bud.
Great dawn, Cherry.
Hockey night in Canada.
In and out.
Wonder what that's about.
Unzipped.
What's that about?
End of much of other stuff.
So there she is.
And of course, her modeling career.
That's what I'm going to understand.
Shalom Harlow, there she is on our beaded curtain today.
Another freebie from the neo-Rodger show where it doesn't cost you to go to our website.
Anybody that would charge to look at their website has to be some kind of an egotus, some kind of a lunatic.
Are you sure?
I mean, it's just beyond my comprehension.
You know what?
Can you imagine if we charged people to go look at our website and we got a great website?
Yes we do.
Thanks Eric and Josh.
But the idea that we would be so, uh, makes me feel very uncomfortable.
It makes me spilky.
Makes my guts twist.
Oh, thanks to how is again for some really fantastic best in the world baking again.
And the other rating, we were done a little bit to that.
Really?
More than two orders in there.
It's starting to get a little, that package is like in a little heavy.
There's nothing worse than a heavy package.
26 after 10 at 5, 60 WQA.
Oh, that's what Sram was telling me this morning.
About Roy.
And, oh, is it in here?
I don't even know if it's in here.
See, I'm telling you.
Yeah, he is.
Oh.
Because the woman we heard about both of them, well, when you're moving away.
I hate you.
Absolutely.
Yes.

Why did they play this kind of music?
It's a local, local, uh, for jazz.
All these weather channels, they want to jazz it up for it.
It's hot, it's humid, it's boring.
The skis are big, nasty.
They've got a little bit of that, um, what's that?
What did they play?
The only kind of music that every West Nile virus was?
They played the one kind of music that he'd know wouldn't mind.
Because everyone, they want you to concentrate on the music.
They want you to look at those thunderstorms.
They're Miami 92, highly 92.
The better showers and thunderstorms.
What a high 92.
When's East Southeast?
At 10 to 15 miles per hour.
Chance of rain, 40%.
Oh my god.
For tonight, isolated thunderstorms in the evening.
That's why I was turning partly cloudy after midnight.
Low, 79.
I have to have rain 30%.
Uh-huh.
Wednesday.
Currently cloudy with a slight chance of thunderstorm.
Let's see.
90.
Chance of rain, 30%.
How's this come all the way up?
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.
I'm excited.

Or, of course, we start our friend to—
or, of course, we start our friend to—
Birthday.
Hurl!
Have a board.
He wants to check in with it.
Oh, and then as soon as somebody mentioned about him
andしま with him doing something, that's what he ran out of here
That's what he ran out of here.
Let's see.
Here.
Oh and this must be—
Oh, it's from university, Dodd.
So it's one of Kim Boyfriend's Boyfriends, no doubt.
And since you forgot, how are the dolphins going into the season?
That's right.
That's who get about 30, man.
Votes, let's add that on there.
You want to add it on since you're the add-on man now?
Well, I don't want that again.
I know that way.
Huh?
I actually can't do on this computer.
I see only thing.
That's about the only thing.
But how do we put that on there?
Are the dolphins going to make the playoffs?
Oh, are you for full, man?
Boy, you sure don't know your sports, mister.
We thought we knew that before, but you're the silly person now.
That's a joke.
How about how would the dolphins be?
How bad will the dolphins be?
Right.
We know they're going to be bad.
No, no, it's just everybody.
Even when a play-by-play man is telling you they're going to be bad.
Absolutely.
Even when he's saying that the scuttlebutt is maybe six and ten.
Absolutely.
Then you know, I mean, a show like him, although he is a jazz fan.
Yeah, but it's the ones that are.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
That's not, now you've got your thumb on it.
That's why.
How bad are they going to be?
How bad will the dolphins be?
Something like that.
Well, there are lots of things to worry about, but of course, most and foremost,
is if all your neighbors are going to buy up all the bottle water and generators
and apply wood before you get a chance to get there in a masking tape, all of these things, that would be bad.
Line 9 is always good.
WQAM, hello?
Yeah.
Yes, sir?
No, this one is the...
Say hi.
Hi.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, see, that was pretty good.
That was one of our better calls on Line 9.
I would say the fur, and it was a nice...
No, it was a nice friendly way to start a Tuesday morning.
In an area where most of the people tend to be extraordinarily unfriendly and unhappy.
Do you believe them?
No.
No, they're stuck here, I guess.
And I'm serious.
I saw that I came home Sunday about 11 in the morning.
And as soon as I started like I went out to Walgreens to pick up some prescription refill stuff like that.
And I noticed the people walking in a parking lot.
They all had that scowl on their face like they were not happy.
Yeah?
Like they were...
He disgusted with life like they were stuck here and not too happy about it.
And sweating and humid and hot and stuffy and...
Yeah.
And they just didn't look like happy campers.
And I'm not used to that.
I'm used to a lot of happy people, eh?
Happy go lucky, friendly.
WQAM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Chronic.
How you doing?
Okay, chronic.
Hey, Neil, can I suck your cock?
Like I said, 5'6'7'0'5'60",
pound 5'60' is the voice of experience it sounds like to me.
pound 5'60' on the 18th floor.
It really looks like.
And for Ryzenwar, let's line.
I said the voice of experience.
WQAM, hello.
Not there, probably just as well while that other thing goes.
Maybe we need about 5'60'7'0'5'60.
We should have access to that.
Sure, thanks so.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, who Neil?
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Okay.
I've been trying for years to get through.
I can't believe I got through.
Well, worth waiting for, man.
Yeah, there you go.
My name's Greg.
I'm originally from Toronto and I'm pleased that you like Toronto.
Well, how's it going, eh?
Yeah, exactly.
So, all of a good city.
One good thing we know the Leafs aren't going to have a bad season this year
because there ain't going to be any season.
So, what's wrong with that?
I think you're right.
I think you're right.
I know I'm right.
Yeah.
It seems like it.
Listen, the reason I was calling is to tell you, I think the world is way too serious.
Right.
I listen to you every day.
You make me laugh.
I thank you for the way.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Too many uptight people out there, man.
Oh, man.
That's why I like Toronto so much.
It's not too many uptight people.
Everybody seems kind of like relaxed and friendly.
And just don't take things so seriously.
If you're dealing with the actual Torontonians, but I mean,
if they're dealing with all the Sikhs and all the minorities and the Chinese.
Well, I don't seek them out myself.
Although, quite frankly, you don't really have to.
What do you hang in Toronto?
Uh, right by my house.
Yeah, are you downtown?
I'm within shooting distance, yeah.
Cool.
I grew up at a young and egg winged an area.
I hang out at the Woodbine Race Track at the Casino Man at the Slots.
Yeah, I heard you like that, huh?
I love that thing, man.
I got hooked on it.
It's beautiful out there.
It's just a fantastic plant.
The only thing that's a pain in the ass.
Well, I say it's a good thing it's a pain in the ass is that it's far from anywhere,
you know, because it's out by the airport, which is good,
because otherwise you'd be like, who's not your cash?
But it's hard for you to get there, isn't it?
Because you don't have a car when you're on the car.
No, I have to take out the cab drivers, no, me.
They know a sucker when they see one coming.
No, yeah, the Mount Personal cab driver picks me up.
Takes me out there, sure.
He likes that 50-dollar pair, huh?
It is easy to get a cab there.
You bet.
All right, man, I was just calling to say, again, that you make me laugh and thank you.
Well, thanks, Rick.
I'll see you at the Eden Center, right?
Oh, I got bad news for you.
Oh, it's bad.
You know, Jim Mugs, the restaurant next to the Eden Center,
that had the great Sunday brunch, which I used to either.
Every Sunday they were all, they shut them down,
because they're going to use that space for something else in the road.
They just closed as we speak right now.
Oh, very avid.
Nothing for them.
But I tried to call in one day.
There's a great restaurant when you were doing the thing with the fast food one day.
Right.
If ever you get on the east side of Waterdale,
there's a place called the East Coast Burrito Factory.
And it's on commercial, and it's just the east to 95.
It's on the north side of the street, and it is possible.
Okay, thanks a lot, Grave.
All right, man.
See you around here.
Okay, I got a thing in my briefcase.
You got a thing?
Oh, he reminded me when I mentioned about the being no hockey season.
I know we have how many hockey fans out there.
About 30, man.
Yesterday in the mail, I get at home from the Florida Panthers.
I think the thing I'm here for a few days, because this is very crucial.
I don't want to pick on them, because I'd like to see the franchise do well.
I'd like to see somebody turn it around, although Alan Cohen certainly isn't the one that's going to do it.
But it's just that they do so many stupid things.
First of all, here's yet another letter.
What an exciting summer.
It's been, dear Neil.
Our Panthers continue to make improvements on and off the ice.
And new coach Jacques Strat-Martin.
And Mike Keenan is general manager that we have fired not too long ago.
But now we decide he's not so bad.
And yada yada yada.
The week following Labor Day, you'll receive tickets for the first seven hockey games.
Two preseason games in the five regular.
There isn't going to be any hockey game.
Once the season begins, we will go to print with your commemorative ticket books and blah, blah, blah, blah, and bonus upgrades in this and that.
And then there's a yellow certificate inside this.
Now, I want you to stop and think about this.
Okay? First, they want everybody's money for a season that's not going to happen.
And number two, here is a special offer for full season seed holders only.
50% off on additional full season seeds for the 2004-05 season, which aren't going to be one, but assuming that there was.
So in other words, let's say I wanted to get you decided you want to become a hockey fan, a Panther fan.
And I said, okay, George, well, I got this yellow coupon for the Panthers that's going to give me 50% off for the additional season.
Of course, assuming I paid for my own tickets, which thank God I don't, because otherwise I wouldn't buy them in the station.
It embraces me as far to my deal.
But that would mean that I would pay X amount of dollars, let's say five grand.
And you would get the same exact thing for 2500.
Well, a good deal.
Yeah.
Throughout our most successful campaign today, it's kind of like what they did last year.
And they keep doing every year because they can't put asses in the seeds.
Is they keep giving away freebies all the time.
And you've just paid a fortune, Armored Legs, 62 bucks a seat.
Right.
And then you find out that half the people sitting around you, or like maybe 10 feet away from you, they got in for free.
Yeah.
Well, screw that.
Thanks.
One more reason why a lot of people shouldn't be sitting on the handover of their money.
It says we've listened to our fans.
We spotted with an outstanding offer starting Monday, August 30th at 8 a.m.
and ending Friday, September 3rd, 5 p.m. this week.
We'd like to extend to you the following purchase additional full season tickets at 50% off, available in all price categories with the exception of roll-out.
And then we'll go to the next one, Panther Club Seats.
So in other words, you can get my exact club seats there, like maybe right the next row down.
For half what I paid.
What a bargain.
Well, guess what?
How do you like that?
You don't get it for half off.
I'm tearing this thing up right now.
Okay.
I'm tearing it up right now.
Oh, I know that you guys try hard.
Some of you guys over there in the organization and you're trying to like drum up some interest.
And you know that there's not going to be any season I feel bad for it because Alan Cohen is just dying a sea of red ink over there.
But I mean, who are we kidding here?
You keep pissing off the people that pay the full price.
Now, if you want that there are all these seats available at half price or for free, would you pay full price?
If you could go to Ruth Kriss-Stakehouse and get a stake for 10 bucks, the same one that I'm going to pay you for 50 bucks for.
Would you pay 50 bucks?
Or is there some kind of a moron?
Even if you got big bucks with you down.
But I just don't understand these people.
Like he'd lead you down to Garden Path and it's selling stuff.
If it reminds me of Jim and Tammy Faye Baker videos, condos they were selling.
Those time shares, those notes.
They had about 10 of them and they sold about 30,000.
You know, condos that didn't exist and it created a little bit of a problem.
And I see exactly the same kind of bait and swish here.
Now, I think the deadline for the...
They're being a season of September 13, which is like two weeks away.
And it's not going to happen.
I mean, barring some miracle.
There's about as much chance that a hurricane in France is going to like land in Mexico City.
Well, maybe it'll be the same like those condos.
Those were faith-based condos.
Maybe they'll be a faith-based ockieces.
Or maybe there'll be a fake base of hockey things.
Maybe that's what it's going to be.
Because that's what I'm smelling right now.
I'm smelling a rat.
Remember the year of the rat when we're throwing all the rats on the ice?
I'm smelling the year of the rat coming back right now and they're trying to sell it to you, okay?
And I mean, a lot of people are buying because there's so many stupid people here that'll buy almost anything.
How's that pull question coming along now?
Which of these...
And there's no particular.
It's just these are things that I think people might recently have been or should be or stuff.
Yeah, stuff that people might be excited about, concerned about.
Which of these is or was the most interest to you?
Hurricane Francis 59.
And one thing about our audience, man, they don't get all panicking.
I'm sorry, it's falling.
About crap like that.
They kind of take the cue for me and they just relax.
Of course, they know that, damn well, that if it is coming here, I'll be on a plane at Toronto on a Thursday morning.
When his hand coming back 40, he's not coming back tomorrow.
I want to apologize for that misinformation that was given to us.
That was the scuttle about around here yesterday.
Who told me that?
Everybody.
Everybody in the building was just spreading that kind of ugly rumor.
Is that the Humper was coming back tomorrow?
Come to find out.
He won't even be in town tomorrow.
He'll be in Vegas.
He's still out there plunging his lungs out.
Probably having a great time.
Although probably a little bit concerned is whether what the hell is going on over here.
Because they keep yanking him around and yanking him around.
My God, if the old Hank Yank is going on over here.
Remember those big yank work pants?
164 votes.
Hurricane Francis 61.
One's Hank coming back 44.
Now how it's during show 16?
Of course, which is the most interest.
Now, that covers a lot of territory.
Like in other words, when are they really going to hear the show as opposed to all the bleeps, stuff like that?
I think it sounds great.
Yeah, it's wonderful.
And we are still.
The Olympics 15, the Democratic Convention 11.
Today's election 8, then don't forget Peter Deutsch, no mayor penis pecania.
Today's election 8, the primary.
Republican conventionally sticks.
And you know, I will not watch 10 seconds of it.
They showed that clip of John McCain, bust on a Michael Moore.
Do you see that?
No.
I will.
Michael Moore.
You know, at least Michael Moore, he's got two puffed up cheeks.
That's because he's fat.
He's balanced.
He's balanced out.
That's what one deals.
Puffy cheek.
Looks like he's got big trot to back in his cheek.
That's a veteran you're ripping.
Yeah, right.
Well, if they can do it, why don't you wait?
In fact, they have the same veteran that Bush was ripping an ass back in 2000.
Yeah, but that was for a good cause.
Oh, yeah.
That was just cause.
Republican convention 60.
MTV Awards only two.
You see how they forget so fast.
That was the hottest.
I heard mad, though.
So, yesterday, there was the hottest ticket ever in this town.
Yeah, well, do you believe that?
Sure, out of that occasion.
Well, yeah, that building on that area.
That's right.
And how bad will the dolphins do this year only one?
And I think probably a lot of people aren't that concerned about it now because they already know the answer to the question.
I mean, what is the maximum game the dolphins could win this year?
Yeah, I.
Max.
That would be only if a miracle, if they've won stats that are rubbing those rosary beads like overtime.
And if Ricky Williams came back and if J. Feetler got baptized, all of these things are what?
Now, seriously, and also got his foreskin back.
All of those things are necessary for the dolphins to win more than eight games this season.
I'm seeing like seven and nine in my crystal balls.
That's my prediction.
I'm really rambling.
You know, and it's already 11 o'clock.
It's great.
I don't know what it is because we really start that late today, but there's something with a new stir and deal here.
And don't let any old funny, buddy with a bad hairdo.
Absolutely.
I'll give you a solid dance about how anybody connected with this show is upset about stirring going to whatever the hell you feel.
Absolutely.
We are happy campers as you were happy would say we are pleased as punch.
We're up to when he ends early like we are ahead.
Right.
We're not too happy.
It's not vacation this week.
We want like more 10, 55, 11, 20 stuff like that.
In fact, maybe if muffers listening, maybe we could like take two of those best of tapes on Thursday.
And then we can go on like just at about 12, 10 and get all the spots in right up until the moral and pregame show sounds really good.
Nobody QA him.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, listen, you're so sure about the hot season, right?
You should run a contest for your plus season tickets.
That's what you think.
I want a contest to do what?
You should run a contest for your tickets for the bandages this year.
Yeah.
You should so sure about the...
Go back to Boston, Schmuck.
By the way, to Bruin, this choke.
He knows that.
560, 7.0560, £560.
I should run a contest.
Otherwise, I should give him the tickets.
That's what he's really trying to say.
That's what he's really trying to say.
Well, what's he got to lose?
Right.
I'll tell you what.
I'll run a contest.
And that is that I'll send you my panted tickets for half of what...
There's a different station as paying for them because I don't pay for them.
How's that?
Maybe he'll call back.
Half of that.
Because you could already get them at half price.
Oh, that's right.
I'll send you for half of that.
Yes.
I'll take it.
Cash right now.
Small bills.
Puts.
Oh, man.
You wonder what people are here on half.
You're listening to Neil Rogers.
The Pips and Politicians will have a car on 560, 680, QA.
Neil's poll.
Well, congratulations.
Get a life.
I have no rights.
He's finally going to leave the way we can now.
Oh, look like the white-erose guy.
Now from the body roll ball.
Barbara Boychak's body fell.
And I stole the rice of the house.
It had with when she realized.
She raised four criminals.
Wow.
Barbara Boychak's body fell.
And I.
Did she hit me?
Hold and craft me.
And she ran four parties with fast-paced.
She patrocious.
And she's now great.
So I did what?
No, she did what?
No, boy.
What's like the courage in a ball and ball between her thighs and her?
That's Liz's proud.
And she's happy me to saw her..
That's what she always would say.
That's her speed of the round of the restrictions.
They're preparing and they're panicking when Miranda祸s Asian.
And she's fat, wife, ketchup and bill.
And she's me, you're a barbed in white,
you'll be mentioned back.
And smell just like the magic stars.
Now, a big hat, a bar for a voice,
we've never seen this for 90, not a bad day with somebody
terrible tonight.
Let me tell you who I saw.
They replayed, I think I'll see NBC last night,
meet the press from Sunday.
And Swellery was on air, and she was good.
Yeah.
She was damn good.
She's good.
She's good what she does.
And Dykes are in right now, in a mirror.
Yes, so what would be wrong with having Hillary
up the ahead?
Because she's a nice queen.
A nice princess.
Sorry.
Not to be confused with majesty.
Ice, a nice queen.
OK, so her, Ken Francis, 86 is leading our poll,
which makes a lot of sense to me.
That means that people are paying attention to the business.
And we got the Weather Road Channel right there.
This is the area of the city of Richmond called Shaco
Baud.
No, we don't care about them.
We don't care about Gaston, whether it's Gaston,
the storm or Gaston, La Roa.
We don't care about any of that stuff.
With all the respect of those people up there in Virginia
and the Delaware and Maryland and all those
vom 4 places up there, we can't be bothered with them.
Because we just wind up with Charlie over here, which I must say,
I think even though I wasn't here, I followed on the tube.
I don't think we did a particularly good job
of advising the people over there.
Now, first of all, if you live in a trader park,
it's not a good idea to be waiting for the big blow.
But nevertheless, they didn't do a really good job.
And they give us our names.
Well, we gave them like 15 minutes warning.
All of a sudden, they kept talking Tampa, Tampa, Tampa.
And it wouldn't have anywhere near Tampa.
Not even close.
Now, if we'd have been lucky, we would have blown Tampa off the map.
Loots, Tampa, terrorists, huh?
Right.
St. Pete, all the more blue hairs.
It would have been great that we could like
brought a whole new bunch of people to Tampa,
like some living and breeding folks.
Because it's a beautiful place.
Sure.
They just got all around.
They've come over there just like us.
What?
No, that's true.
Oh, this is a beautiful place where,
except for course for this climate
the summertime for 10 months a year.
But it's just the wrong people are here.
Nasty.
And maybe they were nice once upon a time.
But I don't think so.
Less than three weeks after Hurricane Charlie
ran south, southwestern Florida, forecasters.
They used that term loosely, are keeping
a close eye on Hurricane Francis, projected
of Minnesota Bahamas.
And the south easter in the United States
before the end of the week.
Should panic now.
That's what weather for a junior
Miss Kamal says in Channel 7.
And she's doing a fine job keeping everybody
on an even keel.
I was going to say straight and even keel.
But that would be for the straight and so.
So they take kind of a sober view of things.
And it's about time.
The center track on the National Hurricane Center's
five day forecast, Matt Whither Without the Cone,
brings the category four storm into central Florida
on Saturday night.
Got that?
Got it.
I noticed Dave Schwartz was back on the Weather Channel last night.
He looked like he was short of breath.
Like maybe he had a heart attack or something.
He's good.
Did you ever see Dave Schwartz on the Weather Channel?
He used to be a big fan of his.
I don't know anybody on there.
Well, I'm the one who wouldn't.
No, yes you do.
The ball headed guy.
That guy.
Yeah, you're sorry.
Any potential landfall remains five days away.
And the storm still could be as far as south
as the Florida Straits or as far north as South Carolina.
I'm thinking Carolinas.
All right.
Yeah.
At eight o'clock this morning, the center of Hurricane
Francis was about 200 miles east northeast of San
Juan, Puerto Rico.
And you'll be pleased to know, well, in that in your case,
that the Puerto Ricans aren't going to get blown away.
Francis had maximum sustained winds of 135 miles
and I was moving.
And I see this is not correct.
Far be it for me, the amateur meteorologist.
I mean, I don't own anything.
And yet it's amazing that you can sit there and you actually
can plot it and watch.
And you can tell where the hell it's going a little bit
better than what they're telling you.
It's not going to west.
You're plotting against going slightly north of the west
because it was 19.6 at one point last night latitude.
And now it's 20 point.
Oh.
So then take a rocket scientist.
You don't figure it take Brian Norcross
and his whole team of meteorologists over there
at the weather at the hysteria center, a channel four.
I mean, here he's sitting across the room
from the news people.
OK, let's go to the weather center
and Brian meteorologist, the weather center.
Maybe it's in the middle of the building.
Weather control, whatever.
Some of them stupid ass cliche.
They got storm center.
And that's it.
The channel four storm center.
And there she is.
The hurricane queen sitting right there
in the middle of the storm center.
He's the storm specialist.
He's the blow specialist.
Just like what's your name?
So when we had the big blow in 1926.
Oh, and then a guy in the weather channel,
the set of ball had a geek.
He's on there talking about, oh, this is the track in 1926, 1941.
All the big hurricanes that hit right here.
This is the track that it was on.
Uh oh.
Not that we want you to upset the track of death.
Right.
Oh, that's the track we ought to be concerned about.
Not pomp and oh, not called or not gall stream.
We ought to be concerned about.
And not those Greyhound tracks.
Oh, yes.
I said, again, oh, not like Greyhound racing.
Some strengthening is forecast for the next 24 hours.
The hurricane center said, hurricane.
Well, we know that.
A hurricane watch was issued early today for these
south east in Bahamas and the Turks and Kiko Islands.
We, of course, are hoping we don't get any damage
or any problem here.
We do hope that the Bahamas get blown off the map.
Then we can have, because you know gambling here.
Oh, yeah.
That's all we need is Mickey Harrison to take his money
move to Israel and the Bahamas get blown off the map.
And then we can be free and clear.
Because even that fat ass Bible thumping governor
won't be able to keep him out of that point.
Right.
Let's hope that's the plan anyway.
What to blow the Bahamas away?
Sounds like a winner to me.
If anybody deserves it, you Greyhound rovers over to Bahamas.
Yeah.
Or are they a sponsor?
Or it's a damn good thing we don't have that off-fusher gambling.
They're illegal gambling.
Oh, yeah.
They're on a station because they may be running.
Oh, gee, you're talking that does, you know.
Here, one thing I've discovered being here,
and this is only the second day of this week in quite a while.
And the last time for a long time,
air V-Day is another crisis at WQM.
The audience thinks I am bellishness.
I exaggerate.
I'm not funny, man.
Every day is another crisis.
Even if somebody farted the wrong flavor.
Oh, my God.
Did you smell what Skippy didn't there?
As a matter of fact, I did smell what Skippy didn't there.
This morning, I didn't believe me.
It was the wrong flavor.
I don't know what the right flavor is, but that wasn't it.
What an idiot.
What a nitwit.
And I'm so delighted that Mad Mike got all psychotic.
I guess they'd live up to his name.
I'm pleased that I could get a little bit of emotion out of him.
Because he's otherwise so like, you know, he holds it in.
You know what I mean?
He's mysterious.
He's a mysterious kind of character.
Mad Mike and I are sales department.
And a bald-headed enigma.
And he just kind of like stands out there.
But you know he's ready to blow any second.
Like he could be the next Ted Bundy, the next Jeffrey Dahmer,
the next Tadalty McVey.
Anyone's ever looked at his briefcase?
No, God forbid.
He's probably got Una Bomba Grande in there.
So at any rate, he got a little messed up in the mind.
Yes, damn glad I could do that for him.
Because every now and then, he had to let it out.
Just a good problem.
The problem deal, huh?
No, he evidently was quite put out yesterday.
And I do not apologize for that.
I think it's good for him.
It was put out.
Good for his mental health.
Don't have a screw in, you're thinking of it.
But I was quite a conversation I had with her
when you were this morning.
That's by my choice.
You just kind of cordially from where I was sitting.
Well, especially after I told her I was planning on maybe
re-up and for another two years and being here four more years,
which I probably shouldn't say that on a year
because the people in the audience are thinking,
oh my God.
As he taken leave of his senses.
No, I like the money, you see.
I like having a really soft deal.
And it's pretty soft.
And I like having all that money coming in
for doing crap like this, you know?
Because now, see, I finally reached the point.
Two things.
I don't, nothing.
I mean, nothing faces me.
These call it, there is nothing.
It's just, we're just here to get to check.
Right.
And number two, knowing that these people,
they're never going to change.
So the fact that matter is they're oblivious.
The fact their ignorance is our benefit, quite frankly.
Even Mad Dog was saying that yesterday,
well, he said, well, if you're re-up for two more years,
I'll do it with two.
And I said, all right.
Yeah.
So I kind of like spread that around the hallway this morning
so they go to Greg see if he might return my lawyer's phone calls.
He's very good at that, not returning phone calls,
playing hide and seek, like I said before.
He'd be good and throw out.
We have a big seek community.
Yeah.
Ha ha ha ha.
We could move Henry hide up there.
Is his next door neighbor?
That's something you guys do for fun hiding seeks.
Yeah, hiding seeks.
I wish we could.
Now that, I mean, the ones that smell good, they're not okay.
Haven't met any yet.
10 minutes after 11 at 5, 60, WQM,
when you're moving or renovating,
that's the best time, the smart time,
to do the right spot.
I'm doing the wrong spot.
What?
I'm doing dynamite for a second.
I just got through doing that.
Well, see, the good thing about having this kind of like
laid back format that we have now,
when we have no idea when we're coming on,
is I can like segue right from that into a laser recharge.
Right?
Yeah, who cares?
Nobody cares.
Nobody's paying any attention.
In fact, I probably shouldn't have pointed out.
I should have just picked up this copy,
just segue right from that.
Just zip it right along.
Like I was saying, only moments ago,
if you have a business who are in charge of ordering ink jets,
thermal carbon paper and supplies,
then pick up that phone right now and call 1-800-2879212.
That's the number 4-A laser recharge,
the toner and recharge cartridge specialists.

who's been supplying businesses and software
with what they need.

And a laser recharge can save you up to 50%
on new cartridges as compared to depot pricing.
Maybe they might give you one of those toner cartridges
for my brother 480, 4800.
For your mother, for your sister.
No, the one I have at the house now,
it's just like the one I have at the bottom.
Oh, I got one for the house.
They might, because my toner,
huh?
I bet you Jess Bob will have one over here by tomorrow morning.
You'll see.
It's that brother 4800.
I just mentioned a model number on the air, the toner.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Well, they're kind of expensive, George.
And don't forget all the cartridges sold by a laser recharge
are remanufactured, not refill.
As long as I'm here, I might as well get a free beer too.
Sure.
Any smuck in study, a cheap refill cartridge,
but don't forget you only get what you pay for.
Unless, of course, you're getting it for free.
Remanufactured cartridges are the only smart way to go.

Power P.
1-800-287-9212.
It's day, if I have any time.
Sure.
At 5.6.6.
WQA.
I am listening.
I saw last night on CNN.
The candidates burdened that big old chin
to move it on over.
Big, men, up over.
Move over, join for us.
Make move for John.
Here is a chin.
A chin.
A horse has carry it through close to no range.
And why like me?
Do you have the long face?
Move it on over.
Make move, men, up over.
Move over, join for us.
Make move for John.
Here is chin.
Well, the first thing you'll try to do.
It's gonna say it's to make that chin up.
Brand new state.
Move it on over.
I see you, men, up over.
Move over, join for us.
Make move for John.
Here is chin.
Oh, and all the rest of the food players.
This little 15 to 5.60 WQA.
I'm pretty weak in effective campaign by the Democrats.
So far, but they're just waiting, man.
Oh, yeah, for what?
They're like the Marlins.
They're just coasting, you know, a little bit behind.
Like the Marlins are only four out of the wildcard right now.
Then the last 20 games are gonna put on a big push.
Go 18 and two in ice.
They're gonna like even maybe challenge the bravest for first,
but not no chance.
Some idiot called yesterday.
Call a mad dog.
We just going for the wildcard.
We have a chance to catch Atlanta.
Oh, God.
Do you believe that?
How stupid some of these sports nerds are?
I'm sorry.
Now I'm gonna play something because we got a big day coming up tomorrow.
Would you have mentioned it?
One last thing to Howard, too.
Howard, don't let Barry Jackson in this stuff about your show.
It's not entertaining.
Get to you, man.
I hate seeing you making comments about it every day on your show.
Let it go, man.
It's okay.
You don't have to go around calling Barry Jackson.
All right.
I know he's not listening because when he's off the air,
he goes out to Boate.
He said he doesn't listen anymore.
So it's okay.
I'm listening.
But anyway, Joe Rose returns to radio tomorrow.
Unfortunately, not on our station.
But tomorrow's the debut of the ticket, baby.
The year of the year, the year of the year.
I'm gonna play the year of the year.

When you think?
I'm sure he's still on the duel in this place.
Speaking of a guy with a bum hand.
So that's the way it goes here at QA.
And the guy that called for the Toronto guy, he was right.
We're not gonna solve the problems of the world
on this stupid-ass show.
We're just here to give me a few chuckles.
That's all.
That's what we do.
Have maybe a big hurricane coming.
Maybe not.
You know, so let's have a good time till we all get blown away.
That's right.
Have a hurricane party.
Tailgate party.
Check out some of these good faxes here.
The latest 11th.
Oh, that's right.
There was 11th and advisory.
Thank you very much, Chronic Faxia, for advising me.
Now, let's see where the holy eye is.
Because one thing about a hurricane,
keep your eye on the...
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's right here.
I got my thumb on it.
And it's now locations still 20.0 north.
64.0 west, longitude.
135 mile an hour.
It's category three.
I love those people say it's a cat tree.
It's a cat four.
You know who said that this morning, Rick Shaw, my good close person,
friend and friend.
But voting for Bush, Rick, you're a good guy, but you're politically confused.
You've been wearing a cat-toot type for too many years.
Remember when his girlfriend called out time from the airport or something?
Oh, that he was at the airport.
Whatever it was.
And she said he's a great guy, but he's politically confused and got a vote for Bush.
Let's just keep him playing righteous brother, oldies, on election day, so we can't vote.
He's a good guy, Rick Shaw.
He's one of our few friends in the business.
He's one of the few people still alive in a business.
Anyway, so this thing is moving west at 15 miles an hour,
which it was like 13 and 14, not 15, but it's not that they're going anywhere real fast.
Now, they're tracking line.
Oh, look at this.
They got a new tracking path on here right on the end of their ice cream cone.
They extended it.
Oh, wait a minute.
The night of five o'clock Brian Reynolds was the winner of the team and he's right beyond the ice cream line.
Yeah, right beyond the end of his cone.
Well, that'd be interesting to watch.
He does some cones on that chocolate.
He's a perfect, he missed a small, he walks in that.
Now they're showing guess where this 8 a.m. Sunday is.
I don't want to tell you do ball county up north begins with a J Jacksonville.
Oh, I said that yesterday that I was taking Jacksonville just, oh, just in time for the election for the real run out today for the real election.
Of course, you named every city on the no, I don't know why about a lot of mugwomps up there, man,
although hopefully in the redneck neighborhoods, not in the dark neighborhoods because it's a lot of dirt.
He's up there in Jacksonville too.
We want to make sure they vote four or five.
Because they're not going to be allowed to vote anyway.
That's right.
What are ones that can sneak through?
The ones we like, conflicted like Malcolm.
But 8 o'clock in the morning on Sunday is what they're showing.
And again, this is only a projection.
Don't get all panicking.
Now like Miss Kamal says, just stay on an even keel.
Just stay calm.
Cool.
Collecting all of these things.
Because what else are we going to do?
What's the point of getting all bent out of shape and running out there and buying a whole bunch of crap?
You know what I think a lot of these people do?
Just like the Marlin caps they bought after the World Series.
That they try to take back and get it on after.
I bet you they try to take back the warped plywood.
Yeah.
And the water.
Oh, and the water.
Forget about that after they like pee in it or something.
Josh Beckett says he'll take it and have price.
For two days, your show has been hiccuping like an eight track with a bad splice.
That's on the year.
Is Duff using an old echo plaque said to me like, I heard that on the Stern Show this morning.
I heard some of that in here.
I thought I heard that.
This show has been doing that too.
Hey.
So good.
Here in Hollywood.
P.S. The hustler shop is luckily right by my kid's school.
But why didn't Larry Flint drop the Bush abortion bomb in his book?
Oh, yeah, he hasn't he didn't do that.
Todd, very sorry about that.
I guess they must have got to that, bro.
They made it good.
And all for she couldn't refuse.
Or maybe they just made her like magic disappears.
You know, you don't have that goes.
Where's that going?
Oh, it's on the other thing already.
Oh, sorry.
0, 360 blows.
I know.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
We better not be having no hiccuping on here on the show.
Or I'm going to be really pork off about that.
I didn't hear some of that.
I thought this morning when I was sitting here, which is on pre-delay.
So how the hell is that possible?
I don't know.
This satellite.
We got problems, baby.
We got some serious technical problems.
We got some scheduling problems.
We've got the audience on pins and needles waiting to find out who the hell is going to be
on first and what the hell is going on with them, even Dustin Hoffman can't figure it out.
And then we also got this damn hurricane to worry about.
Too much stress and pressure here.
Always some psychotic hysterical.
I'm too old for this now.
I think that's just driving to work.
Right.
I'm just too old.
Oh, that drive this morning.
55 freaking minutes.
And it wasn't like real heavy traffic here.
It's not the amount of traffic.
It's the nature of the morons who are in those vehicles, baby.
That's the problem here.
You can't complain about the driving in this town because there is very little.
There's almost none.
You call that driving?
You're driving me nuts.
I'll tell you that.
That bitch at the turn pack.
She's waving the dollar bill like magic.
Like somehow they're going to be like four quarters.
Oh, yeah.
Like Crescan is going to drop four quarters out of the sky and take the dollar bill.
And she'll open up the pump.
We're hand there before quarters in there.
And she's going to toss three and then basket.
Crazy bitch.
She said that the blue sign there and very big letters.
Exactly.
Change.
You stupid.
And she had a Florida tag on there.
It's not like she was going to be in the dark somewhere like that.
No, she was an Anglo.
I want to make very, very clear.
I can tell.
She was as white as the fallen snow.
Trust me.
She was an Anglo.
She was a tracker.
She was a freaking trailer parts record.
I've done record.
Is what she was.
She was a region from the Jerry Springer show is what this bitch was.
And then she makes the left turn nearly wipes that poor guy out.
Man, he's still a hunk in on it.
He's still a...
I'm talking to her.
She nearly wiped him out.
And I know she's going to do something like that because she cannot drive.
What's the qualification to drive in South Florida?
Be joe.
I guarantee you that Terry Shrivo can get a license right now.
Yeah.
And Susan Smith.
Yeah.
No, Terry Shrivo.
Sure.
Oh, Susan Smith.
No sweat.
She just...
She's a little hot water right now.
Bitch.
In fact, you know something, maybe whatever, Jail, she's in up there in South Carolina.
Maybe this hurricane.
Maybe a Francis.
His god, it's I on the Susan Smith.
I'll tell you one thing, David, who recends husband, who's pretty cute.
So you said he was.
But as soon as he started talking, oh brother.
Woo.
Talk about a duel in...
Duel in Yahoo.
But he could have kept his mouth shut.
W.C.A.M. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes?
If you see on the news last night in Palm Beach, like a community, when I'm in a community,
where the people had carry stickers on their car.
Three or four cars got vandalized.
They keyed them with the word push on it.
Nice.
That's a good, holy righteous born again better than we are Republicans, right?
Right.
And you should have seen me already with Harvard, she said.
She said that.
I thought about it.
She said, I read my right to vote, but it's just like it says, I thought about it.
It's just like not to.
There you go.
It was classic.
You know, she didn't came out any better.
Well, good luck to us all.
Thanks, Paul.
Thanks for the bad news.
That's Palm Beach.
Thanks for calling.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Which of these is or was the most interest to you?
We're getting any votes on this poll or what?
311.
That's in about an hour.
That's not too bad, right?
No, we'll take it.
I bet it all.
Not great.
Not as good as like Shmere the Queer and Fuzball.
No, but then I didn't see Quid Greg Reed.
See, I...
I'm sure the audience just started hearing it too, but it just wears me out to think about a man who does so many things wrong.
So unprofessionally, so unacceptably, so grotesque.
And every time no matter how much calm and where you roll him around in, he comes top and out like from the top of the birthday cake.
Smelling just like Warren Cromorty, like Casimir Bokeh.
Hurricane Francis, they're concerned about it and damn well ought to be because we won't all be dead by the weekend.
116.
Not that I want you to panic, but a lot of us might be...well, I won't be here.
When his hand coming back is in second place with the 671, that's a damn good question, as a matter of fact.
We want the answer.
The Howard Stern Show 29.
Today's election to primary 23.
Peter Doigt, don't forget for the U.S. Senate, not Alex Penis-Pakania under any circumstances.
You will burn in hell if you vote for Mayor Penis-Pakania.
An evil doer, a liar, a BS artist that Mickey Eris and Arena and bad here, and he's got that perky down his shoulder, a little one.
He's got a little one.
The Olympus 21, that's why they call him Mayor Penis-Pakania.
How bad will the orphans do this year 20?
The Democratic Convention 18, the Republican Convention 15, and the MTV Awards with all the hoopla on the media, not in this crowd only four.
Your senior Neil Rogers, the rest of the world is 560 years old.
QAAM.
The first meeting went between Brittany Spears Dad and her new fiance Kevin Federline.
What dog are you doing? I was hanging.
How's it hanging? Yeah, how's that already, man?
Then the event is how it's hanging.
First of all, I just want to tell you-
First of all, why don't you shut your mouth, your little smut nose, brat?
What you talk about Mr. Spears?
It was nice you could get the day off from work to have lunch with me.
Well, I just want to tell you how lucky I am.
It was nice you could get the day off from work to have lunch with me.
Well, I don't-
Oh, there it is! I don't work.
What kind of provider are you going to be?
I'm going to provide love.
I really, really, really love your daughter.
That's important to me because if you don't love my daughter, I'm going to cut your head off with a chainsaw.
No, no, I love your daughter, especially her butt.
I mean-
Hey!
Hey!
Sicko!
Yeah?
Down talk to a father about his daughter's butt!
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, man.
You know, I don't like you.
No, I'm just really nervous.
Just give me that chance.
I don't like you.
Just give me one more chance.
So how's that?
I'm going for a job.
What do I need to work for, man?
Your daughter is rich.
Hey!
Hey!
That's not what I want to hear from you.
Take some initiative.
Go out and get a job for your man.
Look, I love your daughter.
I know, but love don't pay the bills, Schmuckie.
I love her belly.
I mean, I could just-
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Well, again with the reference, sis.
Well, what's wrong?
A father doesn't want to hear that you want to lick his daughter's belly.
It's your belly button.
It's so cute.
Hey!
Hey!
Stop that crap, man.
What are you long-range goals here?
How are you going to provide for my daughter once the career is over?
I'm going to love her forever.
I told you loving enough, Schmuckie.
I love your daughter.
Especially her body.
I mean, have you seen her naked?
I mean-
Hey!
Hey!
That's my daughter!
But I mean, she's just beautiful.
I might see the naked.
Hey, daddy.
Do you know she goes to Brazilian bodywax?
Hey!
Are you sick?
Daddy!
Come on, man.
Hey, don't call me daddy.
You little puke.
Pop it, please.
Don't call me pop.
Don't call me anything but Mr. Spears.
Pop it, hey!
Hey!
What the reference is to me?
I don't even know you.
It's the first time I met you.
You smell a little bit like Doritos too.
Are we going to eat lunch or something?
No, I don't think so.
I think I've had enough of this.
I'm hungry.
I don't have any money.
Of course you don't have any money.
Hey!
Which reminds me of people who smell like Baloney sandwiches.
Awful.
26th till noon.
And at 5th, here's the hurricane advisory.
I said probably out of weed distance.
We want to forget about that.
Yeah, we have a course.
You know where we have a goofball station.
We have a what?
Channel 10 representative that we can.
Yeah, but what's it done?
No.
Anyway.
And then I flip over to, because I watched Misson or Cross last,
whenever.
And then I watched, whether for a junior bill come on,
I was doing a five job there, Bill sober up.
And then I went over to see what channel 10 was doing.
I mean, 11 o'clock news.
To check out good old Don.
No.
Because he's generally pretty calm and cool and very accurate.
I like Don.
No.
He's pretty good.
They had that stupid exhibition money that football game on.
Oh, oh.
And I'm thinking to myself, well everybody who's got a brain,
and I cure larger than their thumbnail except for the QM sports audience,
everybody else is like glued to find out what's going on with a hurricane,
so they can find out how much biscuit in the masking tape,
plywood and water to hop up.
They've got a stupid football game on there.
Pretty weak.
Anyway, the core of powerful hurricane France,
it extends to pass well, expected to pass well at North of Puerto Rico,
heading for the South Eastern Bahamas with 135 mile an hour winds.
Hey, all you people in the Bahamas, one thing in closing to say to all you folks,
bye, bye, bye!
And 11 o'clock this morning, the government of the Bahamas
is issued a hurricane warning for the South Eastern Bahamas,
which includes Acklin's crooked.
Can that be right?
Yes, can be.
In Aguas, Mayaguna, and the R, Mayawana,
and the Ragadayra Wanda, and for the Turks in Kekos Islands,
and a hurricane watch for the Central Bahamas,
which includes Cat, Exumas, Long Island, Runkay, and San Salvador.
A hurricane warning means what we know what it means.
A tropical storm means an effect for Puerto Rico,
Colabra, Vakés, and the Vakés, they better start speaking the right language,
zero else, isn't it the Baldurage?
Yes, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the St. Thomas, St. John,
and the surrounding islands, and for the British Virgin Islands.
Oh, wouldn't it be something that those British Virgins got it?
Never got what?
Prince Charles.
At 11 o'clock this morning, the government of the Dominican Republic Library,
a public-indomiticana, as issued a tropical storm warning
for the North Coast of the Dominican Republic from Panta Gorda,
or is that Huta Gorda?
Huta Gorda, yes she is.
Westward to Mazenito Bay.
I noticed that they don't pronounce those things
with the trill, with the Tuells.
They do it with Mazenito Bay, and has this continued to the tropical storm mark
south of Panta Gorda?
Or is that?
At 11 o'clock this morning, the tropical storm mark has been discontinued
for St. Martin, that says in Jacques Martin, St. Barthilme, and San Qua.
At 11 o'clock this morning, well they don't want to hear about all these discontinued things.
Francis continues moving toward the west at 15 miles an hour,
and this motion is expected to continue day with a gradual turn to the west-north-west.
West-north-west, right toward us.
On this track, the core of the hurricane will be passing well to the north of the U.S.
and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico later a day.
However, the outer rain bands of Francis will affect those islands today.
Hurricane Force wins its then outward up to 70 miles.
Now, one thing that really kills me is last night they're talking about what a giant massive storm
or was when they just got through a sand on the weather channel about it's a small storm
in terms of size.
Well, it's a massive small storm.
Powerful, potentially very dangerous and deadly, but not huge.
Okay?
Okay.
Is it huge?
And they give you a solid answer for one minute it's small and compact.
The next minute is huge and gigantic because there are a bunch of a grade robbers
and they're watching to stay tuned.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.
I haven't even gotten any of the good stuff here.
It's almost noon already.
Damn it.
Well, guess what they were wearing?
They were wearing anti-carry band-aids at the Republican Convention.
Well, everything's a big joke.
To mock his military service.
Oh, I see.
Because like Bob Dole said he didn't see any blood.
He didn't see him in a hospital, you know, I see.
Just like Max Claylin, he didn't see any blood.
Right.
Or arms.
To document the heights or depths of liberal media bias during the week of the Republican Convention,
New York City, the Media Research Staff is preparing twice daily cyber media liberal bias.
What is this crap?
Who else sent this?
CNN was upset to learn some delegates were wearing band-aids in blazing with little purple hearts.
Reporter Candy Crowley confronted a woman.
This is a man, John Kerry, who went and served this country.
You feel as though you're making fun of him?
I mean, doesn't that seem like an unrealistic question to you?
And part of the liberal media bias?
What kind of crap is this?
What kind of fascist sent me this crap?
For a little band-aids because it's so cute.
Nooking retreat.
Well, that's a say in fact.
We get those all the time.
Oh, and I noticed the ones from that crazy rabbi stop coming.
No.
They didn't?
No.
Oh.
Castle Hoist rabbi.
Gary in Weston says the judges have a-ah, Gary, stop already.
Wait a minute, please.
Oh, God.
The judges I was referring to yesterday are Hope, Themen, Bristol, Cheryl Aillman,
both appointed by Governor Bush.
Well, vote against them.
And they just happen to oversee some of the lowest ratings of all of the judges in Broward County.
I think it's very interesting they both been endorsed by the Sun Sentinel, he says.
Next thing you know they'll be endorsing W for president.
Well, it's owned by the Chicago Tribune a well-known right-wing organization.
So why should he be surprised?
Gary, good luck to you, OK.
You have your heart in the right place, but your mind is gone.
Speaking of your mind is gone, Bush suggests that the war on terror cannot be won.
Oh, my God.
Now how come they're not making a big stink about this, the Democrats are?
But why is the media making a big shout out to us?
Shut up, you see?
We have ways.
I see.
President Bush ignited the Democratic and the Furnal of criticism yesterday by suggesting
the war on terrorism could not be won.
Forcing his aids to scramble to the fed as remarks, just as he hoped to bask in convention accolades.
Bush sought to emphasize the economy, who Hampshire's appears to be on a rebound.
But his comments on terrorism dominated national attention.
And the interview on the today's show on NBC yesterday, Bush filed the state a course in the war on terror,
saying, perseverance in the battle would make the world safer for future generations,
but he suggested an all-off victory against terrorism might not be possible.
Asked, can we win?
Bush said, I don't think you can win it.
But I think you can create conditions so that those who use terror as a tool are less acceptable in parts of the world.
Less acceptable, like you can't get a good seat at a restaurant anymore.
Democrats looking for ways to deflect a spotlight from Republicans as they open their convention.
New York pounced, after months of less than a Republican's base their campaign on their singular ability to win the war on terror.
The president now says, we can't win the war on terrorism.
Said, good old Johnny Edwards.
This is no time to declare defeat, he be saying.
It's pretty sad.
Almost a thousand dead American troops over there, 6,000 plus injured, which we don't hear about those.
No.
And thousands and thousands of those Liberator Rackies, guess what? They're dead too.
You are listening to me, you evil neo-rotters.
You hear that? That's dirty little pan.
I know you're that fun cut-knit that I show.
I say get rid of them and the boys and go back to a nice safe too.
Besides, you're going to lose to the dolphins.
You'll who he is to doubt me, bro?
Why, we're going to do so well now. Yeah, I might even decide to pay Boka.
Yeah, everybody see my pants?
Toss, comb, my pants!
Well, what did he do that for?
He didn't like what I called him.
And what was that?
Three goals.
Oh, I didn't splatter on your shoe, honey.
Give me back my pants!
I hit them in my three years.
I don't remember that.
I have to do that.
I have to do that.
Oh, I'm hurtin' it.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Wait a minute.
I think the stone show was off now.
What do we do?
I don't know. It's your job today.
I think it's a pregnant pause.
It's a baby Robin has something else.
Guys, let's just relax.
Oh, why don't you...
13 to look.
Guess what's coming up at 10 minutes before the hour on the weather channel?
I don't know.
Local, ladies.
The latest tropical...
Yeah, so don't let me forget in three minutes to pump that on.
Flushed my magic twinger.
Already a box office sensation Michigan filmmaker Michael Moore has gotten another loud reception
at the Republican Convention.
This time was booze, as expected.
When Senator John McCain told the delegates last night about a this ingenuous filmmaker would have us believe that
Sodom's Iraq was an oasis of peace.
Did he ever say that?
No.
No, he showed people drinking coffee and children playing.
They knew he was referring to the maker of Fahrenheit 9-11.
The film which savages Mr. Bush's Iraq policy and quite accurately, by the way,
instead of box office record of his document, reads grossing $115 million so far.
McCain's comments prompted prolonged booing and chance of four more years.
Many of the delegates faced Moore who was seated in the pressings of Madison Square Garden because he's writing a column this week for US-A today.
Moore seemed to relish the attention stressing his arms over his head, laughing and saying, two more months.
That's the fact.
As the Republicans remarked Moore said,
I can't believe they're dumb enough to bring up the film and help its box office on the eve of the convention,
Moore along with Jesse Jackson and actor Danny Glover, led a protest march through the streets in New York City loudly and exuberantly chanting slogans such as, no more years.
The accused of Bush White House of prosecuting an unjust war in Iraq, making the country poor and undermining abortion rights.
And of course he is absolutely correct as usual.
And fact, all that's speaking of a right-wing lunatics man, speaking of born again Christian hypocrites, DCF Chief resigns amid scandal.
Oh my god, he liked that. Jerry Riggier, the good born again Christian man.
Department of Children and Families Chief Jerry Riggier, whose agency has been racked by scandal over cronyism and influence peddling.
This again is a born again Christian, holier than now, better than us.
A abruptly resigned yesterday becoming the latest secretary to be deviled by Florida's intractable child welfare system.
How is Riggier doing, by the way?
Who?
Though he is vowed as recently as last month to stay and lead this agency, Riggier said at a news conference that directing a department under significant and sustained attack had taken its toll.
Riggier, 59, who was wearing a peanuts tie, said he was leaving his successor a far better program than the one he inherited.
He took the job at August 2002, after when a Florida's worst welfare scandals, the disappearance of Miami foster child, William Wilson V, and it goes down and on.
He was sitting in the heralded in the front page just before you wrap your fish.
Now there's sudden resignation by another incompetent phony, baloney, Jerry Riggier. You stuck Jerry.
Which of these is or was of most interest to you? That's our pool question today. We got 417 votes, not bad. Hurricane Francis 162. Oh, that's the adviser to come up in a minute.
So forget it. Oh, when is Hank coming back? 91, the Humper.
That's the Humper kind of back to you. Do it on the radio, man. That was funny. 91 votes. I'm thinking on Thursday. I'm shooting for Thursday. Okay. All depending on the weather or not. What? No appropriate.
Police showed a security video when they have a bus they said was used by the day of Matthew's band and was the source of human waste dumped August,
a thine Chicago architecture foundation tour boat as it passed beneath the Kinsey Street bridge. Well, if they weren't before they passed by there when they got to, they sure were full of crap.
You are listening to Neil Roger. It's exclusively on 516.
Oh, my favorite Republican. This is Matt Drudge and it's time for the Scuse Bear Plotting. It's time once again for the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Tell me. Tell me my love.
Oh, my God. Tell me. Tell me.
Oh, my God.
You're out, Kildy.
You're the boy. Got a seat in the hands of the world.
Oh, my God. Tell me.
Oh, my God. Tell me.
Tell me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Why did you do that to me?
What have I ever done to such a evil thing?
I bet you two egg floored isn't this biggest regret.
Look, you're losing all the weight lately.
I'm not losing that much weight. In fact, if I stayed here for three weeks, I'd gain back a couple of pounds that I lost.
That could be you. If I stayed here, yeah, not quite a minute.
I got good something. There's a body shot. Body shot.
I'm back on the web. I'm on a wetter channel. I want to get the important stuff about Francis on here.
What if you could get up to four loan offers?
I'd grab it right now. WQAM. Hello.
Oh, yes, sir.
Her game time. Okay, great. WQAM. Hello.
Yeah, look at the wheel.
Speaking. How are you, sir? Good. I need to tell you it's an absolute pleasure.
It is. You're welcome back.
Georgia, great job. And anytime you need a filler, the men around me, the listing should thank him for the way he comes on about his mother.
He's absolutely great.
Completely descriptive and wonderful about his mom.
And it's a pleasure having you back on.
Okay, no hurry up. My mom. She's still dead too. Okay. Thank you.
560-056. Well, he probably hates his mom too.
Okay. This is what he's trying to say.
Oh, there's a lot of cousins to say like that.
Like group therapy for those of all these people that I'm sure we're very angry over the fact that I didn't come to my mother's funeral.
I don't do funerals.
Mine, yes, and anybody else.
And I'll be cremated. There will be no service, no ceremony.
No, but I told him the thing where they actually had to do the shovel a dirt on the ice.
Yeah, I've done that.
At Jude Hattles. Yeah, my fat friend. We had to do a big shovel too.
Oh, that is so grotesque.
You know, it's not bad enough that somebody died. That maybe somebody might care about.
It's symbolic.
But the idea that you've got to take a shovelful and dump it.
Your people. I'll tell you one thing. If anybody needs a shovelful, this is a place to come.
If you run out, we got it all here, man.
We got shovels full that never run out. Just talk to Greg. He'll give you some.
I plan to go to my mom's funeral. Do you?
Hopefully soon. I'm going to party shirt. I'll pick that up.
Yeah. I hear your wife is going to. They're going to have a tooper.
WQAM. Hello.
Hey, they all I got a greedy South Floridian Fire Report.
Yes. The Margate Walmart.
A big BCC maintenance pickup truck gathering up two pallets of water.
Thank you.
I'll be done. Thanks for the bad news. How do you like that? Two pallets.
Maybe they're going to draw some.
How you a pallet?
Oh, good. On you, greeny bastards out there.
Leave a lot of little water for the rest of these people.
OK, there's going to stay for us, of course. I won't be here.
What?
No. I won't. I know.
I'll know by tomorrow. Tomorrow's Wednesday.
Last time I checked and September number one.
And I could be gone by September number two.
We're just putting out a lot of rain barrels.
Because I mean, what would be the point?
I got people to hang around and watch the house and make sure everything is OK.
And better than the knee. You know, nail the shutters up.
Oh, yeah. Oh, fat boys in it as well. You got shutters?
No, he volunteered to come just in front of the window.
I mean, what would you say?
I'm sure of wanting a fat boy. Nothing could penetrate through that tumble-lard.
God.
Nice haircut, though.
I noticed in the yellow wants to be just like fat boy.
Everybody around here at 2M is getting that same mohawar David and Faggy haircut now.
Haven't seen Mo that now they got the new do?
Oh, you got to. You got a linger on the wall.
Any day now might be the last before Mo goes into the dolphin.
Absolutely.
And that would be it.
And of course, doing the dolphin games this season,
that's about as close to retirement as you can get anyway.
Because they're not going to play too much football.
I mean, Jay Fieler and AJ Fieli touchy Fieli.
That's what are these people thinking about?
And Dave Wonsdan.
It's the one-stead area.
Oh, I sure hope Wayne isn't upset with us because we used to, well, he always hated me.
Yeah, well, you're bad, bad man.
That's true.
We don't like you too much Wayne.
You're pockmarked, you're a bully.
You're a sour puss and stuff like that.
And so if you take it off in somewhere else, we don't care.
Because they're on a semi-radio anyway.
Right? And that was great said.
It's no longer the big bananza that they used to be.
You know, when Lauren Green was still doing the Melpo spot,
it said it was a big deal.
But it's not the big bananza that it used to be.
That's what little Joe said at Haas.
Yeah.
And who's the other one?
Big Pernille Roberts.
Pernille Roberts.
What was he?
Didn't he have a nickname or just Pernille?
No, no, he had a name.
Well, regular name.
Somebody will know.
That'll come to me.
It's 11 past noon at 5.60 WQAM.
We got the mad dog.
Jim Mandage had two working.
He's two days in a row.
Oh, man.
Is he under stress or what?
And then we got Mohawar David at 2 o'clock this afternoon,
at Full Rider at the studio filling in for the vacationing
and gambling in the suspended Hank Goldberg,
who is back maybe on Thursday, whether it's for knitting.
And then Marlon's on deck 635.
Marlon's at the Met 710 as they go for another win.
And maybe the Cubs will choke and gag, although they're playing a Montreal.
You know how many people worked that game in Montreal?
I started watching them at the Cup game in Montreal.
Five third man.
That is.
What is that all about?
What's the purpose of that?
Man, so many frogs in so little time.
And then we got Eddie Kaye after the baseball game,

Here's a fact that says NFL is on Sirius, not XM radio.
Get.
Sirius.
Sorry.
Oh, it's a good fact.
It continues.
He's just correcting me.
I want to be not the correct here.
Because nobody has any idea what I'm incorrect.
On Sunday, Ms. Drugs said, old neorages is out of touch.
After looking at maddances, I wouldn't be in touch with that ugly fuzzy-headed queen.
That nancy five o'clock shadow would scrape my inner thighs.
I guess if you let it, you know what I'm saying?
Right.
What do you want to touch about?
Oh, I don't know.
I'd touch about fuzzy-headed old queens, I guess.
Ah.
Who hang out with Ann Colter at her pastramia size.
Anyway, here's a fact from Edinfore Lauderdale who says, isn't Goldie doing Joe Rose's old show on Saturdays?
The breakfast, breakfast of the face show.
Well, who cares?
We need that squeaky voice, Pip squeaky in here to do a weekend show.
We have a hundred and fifty grand a year.
Whatever the hell we were paying him, he was stealing all this place as squeaky as way along.
Somebody said that to me, oh, well, we need to do something for that Saturday show.
For a hundred and fifty or two hundred grand or three hundred grand a year.
Whatever the hell he was stealing here.
Mr. Piff Squeak, Mr. Lickett, and even he got tired of looking a natural wild.
Maybe that's why Moe left the muskrat home, but it was too late.
Everybody had the big fallen out.
And that's something how Moe went, he just mowed him right down, didn't he?
No, and I say, he went through those holes.
He did the stuff.
He got through everybody.
They tried teaming up even things that were inanimate objects with him.
They were they ill-fated.
Even Luis Miguel's muskrat threw out of there.
They tried to mate it with the other one.
Jesus, God Almighty, Moe, they just hate you like poison.
Absolutely.
But don't worry about it, don't take it personal.
And just now when you were starting to like him a lot, well, I know.
It always happens a little bit.
Which of these is or was of most interest to you is our poll question, five hundred ten votes.
It's not bad, not spectacular, not earth shaking.
What? What am I missing?
New story about Shannon Melendi.
Who's that?
Some chick that got murdered.
I think they arrested the guy or something.
And then what happened?
Shannon Melendi.
Is this on CNN?
On Channel Star.
Sorry, much for that work.
Oh, there's Wolf Litzkrieg.
Oh, God, now what is that?
Six on our fine cable system here?
I don't know since they changed it.
It's five on our cable.
Oh, what is that?
What's that make sense?
But it's over with already.
I'll just point it out to Miguel because he was all he was pointed out to me earlier.
Oh, what's the kind of thing?
She probably had the cannon Cuba.
Alcarry promises.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, okay.
Anyway, Hurricane Francis, they're worried about 203.
Is the most interest.
And it ought to be.
I think this audience finally has their party straightened out.
You know what?
When is Han coming back?
115.
That's a very strong second.
The Humper.
He'll be back Thursday.
Whether it's permitting is what I'm here.
I think I'll be back.
If he wasn't coming back, they wouldn't be doing those promos saying howard and kneel.
Mad dog.
Those are decoy promos.
Decoy for what?
Decoy for decoy for decoy for decoy.
Devoys.
They bring back that twerk, man.
I'm taking a walk.
I'm getting out of plane to get right out of here.
What?
Now, what did you say yesterday about the fact that they were just about ready to do that deal?
And then they heard me beaten.
I didn't say anything.
I had you didn't.
I told Miguel said it.
Yeah.
It was Miguel.
Yeah, Miguel was this spread in that ugly rumor.
But how they were just about how to deal done with him.
Pretty much a done deal, right?
I would be delighted to find out that that was true because even as much as I don't find it.
I was hoping to get him.
Opened up a mouth.
Again, everything for you.
Why would they want to bring back spilt milk?
Why would they want to bring back that loser to this place, huh?
With his 85 million different jobs and his 42,000 paychecks.
Yeah.
And his point three shares.
He's on a station that you can hear.
You can hear the station.
Does he have any number in Dayton, Broward in there?
No.
He's an AZ non-factor.
I hate to break the news to you, okay?
He has a non-factor.
Are you telling me?
I wasn't going to bring him back.
Now, how you were it?
You're stuck up to anybody if they give you a good cigar.
Or bad.
Or bad.
How bad would it be with an offense?
Do this year's moving up fast, 43.
It's going to be bad.
Take it from me, okay?
Take it from the football experts.
This is a bit of a time frame that you can kind of start thinking and prepare.
Yeah, but where's your ice cream cone, honey?
On the southeast coast.
You really need to start those preparations right away because this weekend,
Labor Day weekend, is going to be possibly very, very dangerous.
All right.
Let's do it.
I'm going to be on today.
It's going to possibly be very, or not, or maybe a little bit dangerous, huh?
Medium dangerous.
Okay.
How bad will it often do this?
You've got 43 votes.
So how is Stern show their concern?
They're about to get 40.
Of course, they have reason to be concerned.
The way we're butchering it up pretty good.
Today's election, 33.
We got an election going on right now.
We'll seven o'clock tonight, Peter Deutsch.
That's the one name, keep in mind, okay?
Vote for him a whole bunch of times.
Good man.
He ain't nobody cash your oil.
And he ain't no Alice penis pecania.
When a little cockatoo on his shoulder.
Today's election, 33, the Olympics, 32, the Democratic Convention, 31, Republican Convention, 19,
and the MTV Awards only six.
They made such a big tennis about that.
Oh, this is the most important thing that ever happened.
We already want them to come back next year.
And everybody see, right, most of us, I'm talking about, no, most of us, people, yeah, don't care about celebrities.
Now, there are a lot of people who do care about celebrities, but you know what, we also don't care about the people who do care.
But don't you care who's yacht would have been bigger, or puffies?
No, I don't even care who's penis would have been bigger.
Josh Hartnet or Nick Lache, or even me, I'm so tired of Nick and Jessica, your girlfriend Jessica, my girlfriend Nick.
If I never saw them again, it would be much too soon.
Right, I mean, he's a good singer even though you deny that.
He really can't sing.
He's got to sing it.
I don't think it's a word for it, but that whole boy band thing went out with the wind as soon as they threw a big pop in the sky.
I heard a rumor that she can sing too, although I would never know what happened.
I would never know what happened.
And of course, she's not this year.
I mean, the rest of the whole night.
Yeah, it'll care about that.
He did right.
No, I'm sure she put out on her wedding night real good.
Yeah.
And before that, before that.
But then again, she put out and she's putting in Christian.
I beg your pardon?
He put in a good word for the majority.
Oh, man, watch your new movie, Great Escape from Pergatory.
I'm telling you, man, the bees these will be over here personal and take care of your ass.
Yeah.
You don't watch it because Greg says enough of your crap already.
What is that story?
What is it about him that he doesn't like you?
He hates me.
He does.
He does.
I didn't tell you because I want to hurt your feelings, but he still has a shower on you.
Why?
That's how it is.
The month that you're live, I got the numbers right here.
The trend came in.
Don't matter.
And it was mostly you.
Yeah, don't matter.
And we had a fine month.
Don't matter.
Get that number right.
If there were still number one, he works for peanuts.
He works sheep as hell.
Don't matter.
He gets a lot of abuse.
And Greg still I'm appreciate you.
We already come in there giving you that phone.
You know, the high five, the low five, the he's fisting and wristening.
And by the way, Troy, don't come in here anymore.
Give me that that's for it's your fist thing.
Will you please?
You want me to save it?
Yeah.
Save it for your friend.
Bro!
And SCRUAN.
Okay, to just conjure up the image of that.
No, she was in here this morning a hell of a long time at SCRUAN.
I don't think we can play that anymore, can we?
Mmm.
I'm off night out.
No.
What?
I don't think so.
Why not?
I don't know.
He says something that would smell right.
Yeah.
That could be anything.
Maybe she had a bad exalibation.
I'd say that.
I'd say that.
I don't care how much money you made SCRUAN or how many houses you sold or how you make a lot of money in real estate.
Or any of that other crap quite frankly you ran here much too long.
But you know I'll see you again in six to seven months.
Haha.
Haha.
One of these days not too soon.
But I put a little bug in her ear.
I said hey listen I'm looking to do a stand by contract tumor years and while I'm while I'm taking leave of my senses and I've lost my mind.
And Mad Dog came in yesterday saying hey if you'll do it I'll go for it too.
Now that's enough for that they better seal it up right now like by tomorrow.
You know what I mean?
Wouldn't you?
Yeah.
At least there's four hours from about 11 a.m. and maybe even a little before that if how we decide to take his marbles and go home some days.
It's all three in the afternoon solid rock solid.
Right?
Yeah.
CLad deal.
Signed it up.
Right now.
Just my suggestion okay SCRUAN.
So you and Muffin all the others and clearance get in there into hop on Greg.
And her case probably would be the first time.
From what we hear 26 past noon at five sixty and in clearance and doves case probably wouldn't be either.

27 to 1 at 560 if I want to swore and I can't say that either I thought that he swore
I said something about
Pools who voted for be can but he didn't say that no, maybe that's the mother bit here's the fact that says Peter doich
Are you freaking kidding me?

Oh the last thing we need in the US Senate is another apologies for israelis is Jewish tongue so far up aerial

Wow like I said Betty Casper for the Senate
Oh, I don't care anybody that can be whoever they come up with these are Republicans right that Martinez goofball
Huh right their hand picked the hand picked picked and
Whatever but definitely not mayor. I shouldn't worry about it mayor penis bikini. He don't even have a chance
I have a trineman chance in hell even the galein voting for him
Are you voting today? Did you vote?
No, see nobody votes in the primary ask me if I voted did you vote don't ask
560 505 60 pound
560 well and buddy never answer right about it again. That little slimy piece of crap
Hey, buddy, take a bath. Okay, at least once before the year is out
5 6 7 let's get these phones smoking between now and oh a speaking of
Elections and Palm Beach is the reason I played that
Madam butterfly flies off with the ballots Florida fixed again abs in the ballots go abs and writes Greg Palaisy's great
It's on our website today
On Friday Theresa LaPour that bitch supervisor elections in Palm Beach candidates for reelection as supervisor elections chose to supervise their own election
No one allowed
Today Florida votes for these nominally nonpartisan posts you remember Theresa Madame butterfly the one whose ballots brought in the big vote for Pat
Buchanan those Jewish precincts in November of 2000
Oh, then she fails to do the hand count that would have changed the White House from blue to red
This time Theresa's in a hurry to get to the counting she began telling absentee ballots on Friday in her own reelection race
Not to worry the law requires the supervisor of election teams County
They're certified poll watchers to observe the count, but Theresa's got a better idea
She refused to certify a single poll watcher from opponents organizations
Despite the legal requirements you do so by last week she'll count her own votes herself. Thank you very much
We trust her and so far she's doing quite well
Although 37,000 citizens have requested absentee ballots. She says she only got 22,000 once she began the count
Where are the others? Don't ask
Where do we just hear that?
Don't ask so she post the names of the requesters
She won't release the list of those who have voted an eyebrow raising deviation from standard procedure
It's a deviation you deviate and she has no intention of counting all the ballots received
She's reserved for herself the rights to determine which ballots have acceptable signatures
In other words the ones that voted for her look pretty good right and the ones that might hope for anybody else went in doubt
Toss them out her opponent Democrat Art Anderson had asked Theresa to use certified handwriting experts instead of her hand picked hacks to take the signatures
Unfortunately, while federal law requires to recidure law of order to correct a signature rejection when registering the feds do not require her to
Promote challenges to absentee ballot rejections. I know what you're thinking
How could madam butterfly know how people are voting while she's printed party affiliation on the outside of hatred or non-villope?
That certainly makes it easier to figure out which ballot is valid, don't it?
And your reader please take note of the implications of this story for the big vote in November
Midgains have sought refuge in absentee ballots as a method to avoid the dangers of the digitizing of democracy
Florida and other states are reporting
400 plus percent increases in absentee ballot requests due to the fear of the new computer-votering machinery that so many of us don't trust
Some refuge the poor is giving us an early taste of how the bush leaders intend to care for your absentee ballot
If there's no safety in the absentee ballot, how about the computer-ized machines? The LaPore is a america have that one figured out too
On Friday the day in which Theresa began her Kremlin style vote count the New York Times ran a puff piece on Jeb's Palm Beach political pet
Covered reporter Amy Goodnod derided fears of Democrats who painted dark scenarios about the computer voting machines
Madam butterfly installed over the objections of the state's official voting technology task force
If you're wondering why the experts told her not to use the machines
I'll tell you because the New York Times won't it's not because the voting specialist are anti-technology
Luddites the fact is that Florida counties using touch screens have reported a known error rate
600 percent greater than the alternative paper ballots read by optical scanners and those errors have occurred surprised
overwhelmingly at African-American precincts. Oh no
First brother Jeb is team will a portal to keep the vote clean and white together
They refuse the Democrats request for the more reliable paper ballots as an option for voters in Leon County by contract
Elections supervisor Ian Sancia insisted on paper ballots
It did not lose a single vote to error in the March presidential primary
Sancia told me it's a slam dunk certainly that the computer screens will snatch away several thousand Palm Beach votes
You see mad dog I said that word
Theresa and the Jeb sir have been quite close since LaPore came out of the closet the Republican turn Democrat
Namely independent this year accepted these sticky embrace of the Republican party
One really has to wonder if she ever truly left the blues in the first place
It's a shame that supervisor LaPore was too busy counting her votes and rejecting
But I think he's got his colors my stuff in his article, isn't he? I think so
It's a shame that supervisor LaPore was too busy counting her votes and rejecting ballots to respond to my phone calls
I wanted to be the first to congratulate her on a election victory two days before the election
Or maybe she fears I might be the early bird dog who catches the butterflies. He turns back into a worm
Right squared plan. There you go. It's a reasonable poor. I haven't I've been saying why is he certain jail? Why she still got a job
I mean she ain't no Miriam elephant. She's got that doubt because she just got reelected and butterflies are free
And in Palm Beach whatever it is they say we like it free
Especially if the early bird don't forget free early bird dinners in Palm Beach on election day
It's loamy's
5 6 7 0 5 60 what a joke man. This state is an absolute joke and a half
They might as well have a few chuckles, you know

Uh at this stage of the game more power to know don't the ruffle my brothers no moe
But it he just happens to be in there because they have to pay him now and as a result
This is going on how battle of dolphins do this year is moving into a strong number three with 50
The Howard Stern show 42 the one with their holes in it like Swiss cheese the Olympic 36 the Democratic Convention 34
Today's election 33 the Republican Convention 21 and the MTV Awards only six
See now they asked the same question and power 96 they did the same pool. You think we have the same result
Now yeah, they're concerned about the hurricanes and Hank the hurricanes

Stem cells are magic, so everybody pass them around,

So Peter Doix is a sure-own liquor, huh?
I had no idea.
I didn't either.
I don't believe it.
You believe it?
I don't have anything to base that on.
I still like Betty Castor a lot.
Like a loyal, former secretary of education, wasn't she?
OK.
I don't know anything about her either.
Betty Castor Royal?
Castor vote.
Right, Castor vote, man.
Betty Castor.
Or Peter Doix.
Or anybody but Alex Sapina's pecania?
I don't believe it.
I think I have some anti-Somantic guy that's that fact.
Probably.
Headless body left in trunk, passenger decapitated.
Marietta, Georgia.
Oh, probably this is well.
A drunken driver had a telephone pole support wire
that decapitated his passenger, then drove 12 miles home
and slept in his bloody clothes, leaving the headless body
in the truck, police said.
How do you like that?
A neighbor walking with his young daughter Sunday,
morning, discovered Daniel Broam is a headless corpse
in the truck in John Kemper, Hutcherson's driveway,
and called authorities to Corporal Dana Pierce,
County Police spokesman.
Officers found Hutcherson asleep inside his home.
He was visibly drunk and his clothes were bloody,
if they were to say.
They later found Broam severed head at the crash site.
Oh, there's nothing like a good severed head.
What?
Yeah, that's what they say in the Middle East.
Hutcherson 21 was charged with vehicular homicide,
grabbing out of the influence and failing to stop
at a nice dinner with death or injury.
He was jailed on a $100,000 bond.
Police said, Hutcherson and Broam,
friends since high school, were drinking at a bar Saturday night,
left after Broam said he felt sick.
Broam 23 apparently was leaning out the window
when Hutcherson hits a support wire
among one half from the bar.
Those who knew invested that Broam always had a good head on his...
Or maybe they said he was head and shoulders.
We can do it.
A DNA...
Oh, I don't want to play that severed head thing,
with all that terrible stuff that's been going on in the Middle East and everything.
Huh?
Wouldn't that be a bad taste to play that?
Oh my God, it's a severed head!
Yes, severed head.
The new fab that's sweeping an Asian.
Everyone who's anyone has got a severed head.
And if you think it's not for you, then just listen to this dramatized version
of an actual letter sent to us by a satisfied severed head customer.
Okay, that makes $623 for all your Halloween candy.
Well, $623.
Isn't that a lot for a bag of candy?
Well, it's our finest mixture.
You two get the caramel corn balls, the tapioca sugar daddy's
and the juice filled wax pump gifts.
Well, I guess it is a good deal.
Except for this severed head of the middle of the Zagnut bar.
Sweet, but jeez, I'm so sorry.
Please let me give you all this Halloween candy for free.
You'd better.
Yes, a severed head is your ticket to thousands of discounts in freebies worldwide.
So pick up yours today and remember if it's not dead, it's not severed head.
You know what's that mean?
I will play right now, but what would Jesus eat?
Bob and Tom?
Not in here.
Where the hell did I come from?
What do you mean by that?
Where did you get that from?
Off the latest Bob and Tom CD that somebody sent to me, which I think is out of North.
It's in my DCS.
I got, probably, even in more good stuff in mine.
Am I in a roll like bleeped in this?
Where do you go?
Well, I don't even have that in here.
In here what?
That disk.
Of course not.
Who in here is about the, you know, you?
There's a great old lady.
Of course.
Okay, anyway, let's go.
All those other bits are new by the way.
What's that?
You probably don't even have any on the post that notes all around the screen.
What do you mean they're all new?
They're new, like from the last two weeks.
From the absence?
I don't know.
Well, what do you mean?
Like some of those, what do you mean?
What makes you assume that?
I thought they said you would just get the end of the week.
Whenever they get around to it.
Whenever they feel like it.
They're about to meet.
You don't have last weeks.
Because you're here.
Exactly.
So what the hell about you?
It's up there or just shut up.
Okay, 618 votes on there.
And Hurricane Francis has got them all whipped up into a frenzy.
There's the typhoon in Japan.
I hope your daughter's not on the way.
It's a frenzy.
It's a frenzy.
It's a frenzy.
It's a frenzy.
She's living in the paper boxes.
Mother's sound.
We're trying to.
And I'm to nether Jones.
It's the-
At least one good thing with your daughter being over there in all the Japanese.
Have those little penises?
Situation developing.
And we want to get right to it.
Show your Hurricane Francis a very strong, powerful hurricane category 4 on the SAFER
Census scale.
Definitely-
She's doing research.
Hurricane wins at 135 miles per hour.
Its movement is wet at 15 miles per hour.
It's going to be passing just to the north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands today.
But they will definitely be feeling the impact with at least tropical storm-force wins.
Throughout the afternoon.
You can see that the estimated pressure is down to 9.50 mbps, 28.05 inches.
And it's censored about 175 miles north east.
Now it's in a wobble.
We have the old wobble.
So that is what is going on-
But your daughter said it is hurricane Francis.
Wobbling slightly in the northwest.
Hurricane owners are on their way.
She will say that-
Because the advisory says that they can do what's best now.
She said that she can do what's best now.
The information as to a wind speed and all of that kind of thing.
Alright, let's see what's going on with the advisory from Hurricane Francis.
You're talking about the possibility-
Well already, some hurricane watches and warnings.
And effect, the warnings for the south-eastern Bahamas, the church, and the pictures.
Oh my God.
And the watches for the central Bahamas.
So those are the hurricane watches and warnings.
So you need to heed those warnings and watches.
That's right.
You can play about tropical storm and visories that are in effect.
Now, tell you what, let's head on back and talk about the hurricane Francis.
Not bad on the air.
That's enough.
Get her out of here.
Pretty ponderous of the job they did on the Weather Road Channel.
I keep wanting to say the weather network for that's Canadian, eh?
Okay, let's get back to the good stuff.
This is this article here, you know, Tucker Carlson, the silly goose with the bow tie that's on crossfire.
That idiot.
That right wing pretend to love bush guy.
Who's down there with James Carveller or Paul Baggalla.
Anyway, here's an article about that you ought to listen to very carefully.
It's called Bush's 9-11 cowardice.
It's on our website.
So what does it mean when Tucker Carlson and Andrew Sullivan both declare they can't vote for Bush in November?
That they're horrors, that they're reading the tea leaves and they want to get stuck on the wrong side of history, that their tools and hacks and don't matter?
Perhaps.
But they do have their own sphere of relevance and frankly every right wing pundits the turns away from Bush's victory for us.
And the latest Esquire magazine, addition to running Ronnie Reagan's anti-Bush's greed, also treats us to Carlson and Sullivan declaring their disappointment they failed Bush presidency.
Oh, this is so sweet.
That silly, silly tweet with a bow tie.
Carlson in particular is brutal on Bush, taking him to task for his cowardice on 9-11.
Carlson says the attacks initially made me sorry I voted for him.
For most of that day as my wife and children stayed inside our house listening to a roar of fighter jets overhead and black smoke from the Pentagon hovered above our neighborhood, Bush failed to return to Washington.
My family sat unprotected a few miles from the scene of a terrorist attack, Bush hidden a bunker on some far away military base.
It infuriated me as did the subsequent excuses from White House spokesman.
There was a risk in coming back. They said there was a risk in coming back. They said, of course there was. That's the point.
Leaders must take risk sometimes physical ones. Bush should have elbowed his secret service detail out of the way and returned in a display of fearlessness to his nation's capital.
I found it distressingly revealing that he didn't.
So did I. It was one of my earliest thoughts that fateful day. Say what you will about Julianne and most of what I would say is bad.
But Rudy showed the temple leadership Bush only wishes he could muster.
What's worse, Roe knew how bad Bush's cowardice looked so much the same way they handle any obstacle they faced. They lied.
Roe of claim they had received credible threats against Air Force One, a ludicrous assertion that was proven false days later.
But in the chaos of the moment, both Bush's palpable fear and lies used to cover it up or lost.
But as Carlson says, the incident was revealing.
Just as Kerry's heroism a half a world away is revealing, there's a reason the Swiftboat liars are going after the story so hard.
Kerry turned his boat into the danger he faced. Bush ran to Nebraska and coward in fear.
Short. How do you like that? Right to the point, baby. He's got his thumb right on it.
It's on our website. Read it in weep about your cowardly president who's sitting by while thousands are getting massacred slaughtered for no good reason at all.
And by the way, what a great job against the war on terrorism. Iraq where there was no terrorism, which was the terrorist threat.
Now is the greatest hotbed of terrorism in the world. Well, they shouldn't have attacked us on 9-11.
That's right. They should have been doing all those evil things all in weevil doers. Plus they wouldn't have liked those smuckers they were.
But they don't. That's Iraqis. Well, we're confused about that. We don't know. We don't know. They're over there, bomber. We're a little confused about headgear. We're learning that now.
We had some fag interpreters who could understand it, but they were fag. So right, we dumped them out. We can't trust them. Fag. It's.
Anyway, 12.56 at 5.60 WQAM. Why did you do that, Er?
There's a bad left wing guy want pushed you say goodbye Michael Morey. He wears extra large pants and they love him in France. Mike, you're more.
He's new flick. It is full tricks. You'll be sick. Cause it picks on George W.
You might become number number one and then when it's done won't be fun. But you'll be screwed. His documentary for stars from John Kerry, Mike, don't worry.
Every Wednesday and I stir his speech will last and I you can bet. And now all the fuck news would like him to be moving to Norway.
What is clear is there to be a paid in very Michael Morey.
102 at 5.60 WQAM. Boy, it's a right along. You know, it's our one to two hour. It's been moving man. It only feels like three hours. Wow. I haven't had a moving like this since about three this morning when I hopped out of bed and ran into that magic room. Spent a lot of time hugging the old bull. What was that all about? I think I got bad allergies here. I'll see you.
Here are some good news because keep in mind folks. It's not important that we succeed, but that people we don't like fail. Isn't that the case? Sure. We'll take it.
Baseball owner is being by the market. I'll give you a clue who we're talking about. I must be crazy. I must be nuts.
The Boston Red Sox may be on the comeback trail, but the difficult summer for the baseball teams. Principal owner continue. I must be crazy. I must be nuts.
I never forget that day that he and his henchmen stood there in their pinstripe suits in a hallway and I walked in the door to come into the studio that morning and somebody in the control room.
Grieper or somebody said morning meal and right away they looked at me like the antiques Christ had just walked in like I had six, six, six tattooed on my back.
I said, quick look at my ass. Would you please? John Henry who runs one of the largest hedge fund type firms in the commodity currency markets has seen losses pile up lately. Oh, all we can say of that is.
All right. John Henry and company a $2.2 billion managed futures advisor in Boka has made costly errors in the stock bond and currencies market this year reports today's wall street urinal. All I can say is.
I must be crazy. I must be nuts. The firms largest investment program the $1.2 billion strategic allocation program. A blade of Mr. Henry's various strategies is down 22% since January 1.
I must be crazy. I must be. In comparison, the Dow is down about 3% this year. The treasuries have scratched out game to about 3%. He's down 22% since January 1.
Five other investment programs that Mr. Henry's firm are down more than 20% this year. I must be crazy. I must be nuts. While the red stocks have rallied within shouting distance of their bitter rivals, the Yankees, Mr. Henry's firm isn't showing any signs of snapping out of its own slump. These strategic allocation programs down another 1% or so in August. Oh, man.
So is Mr. Henry saying wait till next year not so fast. He so convinced the turnaround is at hand that he's invested $20 million of his own money in the firm's accounts in recent days. I must be crazy. I must be nuts. We know what we do works. He says I believe that by the end of the year will be positive. Mr. Henry says we'll be fine. He's saying, oh, we're fine.
It's a great time to invest in our form of trading for almost any other firm a burst of self confidence in the midst of such a bad year would seem as misplaced the decades long yearning for World Series title held by many four lower new Englanders, but the volatility of his 22 year old firm's performance is notorious in the market. And John Henry company is rallied sharply from steep losses in the past. Damn it. Well, maybe it won't happen again. Maybe he loses skinny little and I must be crazy. I must be nuts. His body language told you what a loser he was. You know, I'll care. He's got 80%.
I think the best way to describe John Henry turned on two legs. I never saw what he was here because when mad dog was in the hallway, you turn. Let's see, don't forget that. Do I slow it in for the act to clean up right? Oh, yeah, right. And so did everybody else. Okay. How many were there? I wasn't there one. No, that was the Senate. He was in the house. There were like 391 or 13 or something like that. I mean, who are you kidding? And so did carry and so did Kennedy and so did everybody else because it also was a catfish lady. I have no idea.
John wants to know. I'm the idea, John. The catfish lady. You don't even know who that is. No, who? That was P. Your time. And I would be back in the day when we had all those regular callers. Remember EJ and DJ and the catfish lady. Oh, like, and the biggest recalling lady. Yeah, people I had talked to for years. I and Z people long before Zeta.
Yeah, when we talk to what he's called us. The idea, sure, DJ and P.J. from the point of the day, they would call stand to right. Oh, stand. Yeah. I wonder what I have. Oh, I probably shouldn't even be saying it because that my phone will be. And I'm not answering the phone.
I woke up at 2 p.m. face down in a gutter. My mouth tasted like mong. My brain was like mother. I like this one better.
Stand Major. Now a New Start Radio 610 WIOD. If you missed the last show, you missed this. Well, then what the hell is your problem?
Jane is in New York. Well, he was there was show. I don't want to come back. I just told you that. But who do you want? Who do you want? Do you want Alan first? I think you want joy Reynolds. They want the hell do you want them to hear silence? Is that all we have to do?
What do you give me a name? Who do you want? Is that all we have to do? What kind of content do you want during 2 to 6? I can't.
Here the next stand Major Show this afternoon at 2 on New Start Radio 610 WIOD. I think what they want to be between 2 and 6 was ABS. Anybody with stand? Oh.
Anyway, you buy a new watch lately? Not lately. How about that? I don't think we're going to be here. You try that one out. Yeah. For stand. For a stand. By the way, how's that money? How did you owe me stand? 5, 6, 7, 0, no worry. Keep it. Just don't call me. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a gate TNT.
I hear he can use another little check before I go back up north. WQAM. Hello. Yes sir. Happy Tuesday.
Oh, there we go. Two days of the worst check. One, I got about 30 man of these people over here in Bonaventure putting their shuttards up already. Oh, God. Also what kind of green do you smoke? The good stuff? No, not on this show, man.
We don't do any of that wacky weed crap on this show after the show, especially in Toronto where it's bad stuff in Canada. Oh, and I did tell you Paul Martin is going to tape what he's going to put it on the tape.
You're going to pick it up and pass it around like a piece bite and smoke it. No, seriously. I'll be right there. I mean, you talk about a difference in right across that border, baby. It's like they're in the in lightened age and we're in the stone age. They're in the stone age and we're in the stone age. It is so sad, so pathetic, so tragic man.
And the DEA they finally I guess throughout the case out there one of those cases in California, remember the guy that was growing a medical marijuana. Yeah, within a state law, they passed a lot and the DEA went out there and said, well, I don't give a crap about your state law.
This is one of the cases where we don't care about states rights, no more because that wacky weed is bad. And they're also given and I'll stay this for Paul Martin, which is pretty weak lame plastic.
But he stood up to him because the West government naturally bringing a lot of pressure against that Canadian government. And he said, well, how come it's okay for the Taliban, Poppy? Yeah, Poppy, you know that that's the first person we have to stand again and the Taliban is reforming and all of a sudden, the BS that they're selling you and the $43 million that they gave to the Taliban sure paid off, didn't it?
Sure did.
God, off a lot of hands, joke man, how can there be so many stupid ignorant idiot? I still blame it on the media. I'm not a man, so I'm educated, but the media could be educating him like every minute of every day.
Well, big business, what are they doing? They're putting on like John Gotti's family. That's all part of the blame.
Yeah, right. And all these so-called reality shows I got news for you. It's somebody else's reality that's leased the money out of your wallet. It's not the real world, okay? Just like Howard Beale said, you're the reality that this is just an illusion is what he said.
Good old Howard Beale. Remember that speech? Yeah, I didn't do much good. Did it? No, sure. How did it? But he was a good guy. He meant well. Nobody see nobody saw that moment. No.
And what's like? It's like the war in Vietnam. And now that I'm an old geezer, it never dawned on me. The war in Vietnam, how many years ago?
About 30 years ago, right? So if you're like 20 now or 25 or 30, what do you know about Vietnam? Nothing. So all of the scurril, well, Kerry had some nerve to come back and say, well, all of those atrocities are well documented. They're well proven, okay? Yeah.
Why do you think we got the hell out of there? Why do you think they brought 50,000 kids back in body bags and hundreds and hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of dead people over there?
Forget the purple hearts. He went. He was there. He volunteered to go there. No, he didn't go. He signed up. But why do we keep talking about that?
What the hell difference is Vietnam got to do with what's going on? It's just changing the subject. It's just a camouflage is what it is. It's a subterfuge. Don't let it.
It's just a smoke screen. Well, that's the last call where he got the smoke screen gone. In fact, you got his number. The good stuff came in this weekend. You know that there's a full moon? Yeah, I've been noticing.

GTA II

How can that surprise
Operation Trainer
You replace the fortune and who sends up the grand
With the better way to rape and torture instead
Ocarina, I rack because we hate them
For something that we know they did not do
For sure, paradise, the occupation
Now we're all screwed
Can't ask of it's key, let's set free to frame
And my Electron by far dives to their fate
And first they get inmates that criminal pile
There's a code that call it to shake these and smile
Older scene all that rape and torture
In rest they know a tragedy's or something
Like the first you only caught a corner
Do you know what we think?
Oh my god, it's come in ski
Hellicat bull die
That's in her black rubber on a ladder they die
I bet you even Hillary would turn down that psyche
It's 117 maybe not Janet though
I think I can see Janet and Janice driving off
And her son said together that red pickup truck
Can't you just see that?
She got the thick glasses
Oh yeah
She was supposed to be the scapegoat by the way
And she butched up big time
Yeah, I mean, you told today, guess what
You're going down, you don't have anything here
No, I don't, you keep leaving it up there
What?
Abu Ghraib, where did that come from?
That's in there?
In there? Under what?
Abu Ghraib, Abu Ghraib, Abu Buhbuh
No, it's not
Not in here
I'm hearing out, you're in Dampi right now, it ain't here
You heard her Buhstash, I'll be here

Abu Ghraib, yeah, I like mine better though
180, 180, and 560 WQA, I'm on a great Tuesday, man
We got election day to day, don't forget vote for Betty Castoroyle or Peter Doge
Anybody except for Ralus, penis, pecania
Okay, all you Jews out there vote for Peter Doge, he likes kosher
Betty Castor, she eats trief, and on a piece of penis, pecania
Yeah, enough said
Which of these is or was the most interest to you?
691 votes, that's not bad, considering
We came out at about what, 10 after 10 this morning, after the best of Howard Stern
Seems to me that some of that stuff, now I don't listen very much as you know
But some of that stuff is like from when it's already been on this station
It's only been a couple of weeks, live, you know
But I guess when you want the top rated morning show in America, you have to take whatever you can get
Whether without the holes like Swiss teas, whether without the Adelaide, the dump, the bump, the muffled sound
Just being able to take whatever
That's why muff is in there anymore, and to be like control that muffled sound
That's where that expression came from
Anyway, 691 votes, which of these is or was most important to you?
Hurricane Francis, 275
That's the one with the unlucky
When his hand coming back, 146, I think we'll know by Thursday
If and when
That's my best guess
Okay
Because everybody who asks in the building from our program director to our operations manager to the janitor
I don't know nothing
And I actually believe them, which is rare for me, but I don't think they do know nothing
And about this either
When his hand coming back, 146
I'll be able to often to be this year, 65 votes on that almost 10% are pretty damn worried
Except for us Patriot fans, oh boy
Talk about rubbing your hands together
Now how are the students here, 46 are interested in that?
Olympics 45, 45 people interested in that, Fagory?
Man
I mean, was there one real sport in that whole deal?
A basketball, and that was an embarrassment
For the US
Still haven't named one as far as I'm concerned
No, but I mean, that's considered a real sport
Swimming, oh, like team sports
No, no, like swimming
Sport, the running run, the track I guess
Track, yeah, track was good
I watched about two minutes of that
Democratic Convention 46, Olympics 45
Today's the election 37, how many people are voting today in Tade?
And in Proud?
Republican Convention 27, and the MTV Awards has still got only six out of almost 700 vote
Only six, just not our crowd, man
We just don't have those hip, teeny-bop
Rappin, crapin, poopin, bopin
Yeah, we don't have them
21 past one, let's get a bowl of bunch of calls on here before too
Because it's, I think like I have short chains
We've got a whole bunch of stuff here yet about the latest polls
Yeah, but we'll get to them, alright
WQA, and hello
Rappin, anything else I'm doing?
Good
Hello
Yes sir, speak to me
Yes, how you doing?
I don't know, I want to know how the fishermen's doing
How what?
How the fishermen is doing?
He's still in the closet, is what I'm hearing
Let's be very crowded closet
Yeah, especially in that house, in that hood
How's Lizer Row doing?
Oh
WQA, and hello
Nail
Yes sir
How you doing?
Good
I have a spy report
Yes, last
Why are you whispering?
Well, I'm not whispering
I was waiting for a lot
Last night I was flipping channels
And I ran into the PBS coverage of the Republican National Committee
And you watched that?
The Republican Convention?
A second
You know who they had there, Neil?
Jane Fonda
No, they had a woman
The Pope on Wayne
From Abe Lincoln
I ran
The Republican Party
And she was telling the stories, you know, of all the stuff that's happening
And this is what, after four years, they have to bring to the table?
That's what they got
And then the John Kerry Bandai, don't forget that
That's right
See them
Yeah, they got nothing to see if any administration that's done great, things like
Create millions of jobs like Clinton did, or bring peace and prosperity in our time
Forget the solo-visiting surplus
$20, $2, $2, $3, surplus in the budget, all those things, they were able to
Tooth the Row and Horn
Of course, they still got the election stolen
That's because that's because of the Jewelieberman
Right?
And that's because Gorb, being his winner, was in the end and was in the end
And then tried out, oh, blah blah
That's the only reason
Distancing himself
Oh, and then they got Alice Penis-Pakane on there yesterday
Then we're talking about the Gor clip about how he stabbed Gor in the back
And was the worst betrayer in your year
And Penis-Pakane's response is, well, he would have just won his home state of Tennessee
He wouldn't have needed Florida
Well, you talk about trying again
Change the subject, okay?
Point the arrow in the other direction
It's like standing in Hurricane Francis is going to hit France
That's why they call it Francis
Frankus
Yeah
No, no, that's exactly what he's doing, Mayor Penis-Pakane
Who are you, Kid and Man, you fool, and he's the Comedian of Dave County
It's a twerp
He's a Comedian twerp, who is whatever you want him to be on any given day
Oh, he's not going to let Mickey Ererson make that deal
He's not going to make any backdoor deals, he promises you
That's his number one guarantee, as soon as he gets it off, he goes and makes a backdoor deal
I'm not talking about that
That's the fact, Robert, who knows?
Well, that's one mediathe
And then the same thing, he goes and stabs Gore in the back and he goes into hiding
You could have put that thing over the top, it didn't do it
Just 600 votes is all it would have taken
And a few thousand bogus wants to be sure for insurance
And now all of a sudden, he's the big Republican basher
And Bush did this, and Bush is doing that, and we need the international coalition
Yeah, right, who the hell are you, Kid?
One day he's a Democrat, the next day he's a Cuban Cuban, he's everything
To all people, and you're going to see a whole bunch of your people are going to vote against Bush's bad people
Either they're either going to vote for a carrier or they're not going to stay home
Because they're a foaming, like the guy who killed himself, you know that?
But he would have voted for a security stand
Not for a fight going on in that community
Right, that is right
It's not a contra-tons
Because this business embargoed this
This embargoed business, and Newton-Pedad-Dowler
He's creating tremendous hardships
Yeah, a lot of people have swam, like, had a bluest brain job, and still dead
Last time we checked
God, what an idiot
WQAM, hello
I thought I did
WQAM, hello
Hello, Neil
Yes, sir
How are you?
Great, good, um, I trust your opinion pretty good, and I'm wondering if you had any endorsements for today's elections
Endorsements on what?
On uh, senators
Just for the US sentiment, anybody except the Alex Penis-Pakania?
You like Deutsche?
Peter Deutsche is okay, I like them, but then this anti-Semite before we got all been out of shape about it
All right, anyone for the local?
No, I don't, I would deal with local locals, I ain't got time for that
You don't got time, huh?
All right, thank you, sir
They're the small potatoes, man
Just keep that in mind, they're small
You know, it's the same face of the same names year after year after year
I know, I know
But try to get in there and make a difference, you know, right?
They're gonna go well do it baby, vote four or five times just to make sure
Or I get counted once
That would be pretty good for Florida, that's pretty typical, you know?
Okay, see ya
I think
And don't worry that blackface did the other election pool, not good idea
Right?
Let's put it where you were
Not a good idea
All you dark folks, I'd put on like some Chlorox bleach
Yeah, in fact, you know something between now and November, you can get Michael Jackson's cosmetologist in here, the dermatologist, whatever it is
They have spray on liquid paper, spray on white baby
You're gonna be as white as the fallen snow
Just to open your mouth
President, I still raised too close to call three states
The Gallup Telephone Survey really started in the case that voters in Wisconsin, I can't believe they're curious blown Wisconsin
How is that possible?
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Iowa are pretty evenly splintered who they want, the economy and the war in Iraq
The three are among about a dozen states considered too close to call right now, which also includes Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Missouri and Minnesota
How can Minnesota be tight?
How is that possible?
How do we even hear about Catherine Harris's plane?
Registered voters pulled in Wisconsin, put Democrat John Kerry ahead of President Bush
This is in Wisconsin, 49 to 46 percent registered, but likely voters in the state Bush had 50 percent carry 47
So that's gonna be the challenge to get all the people out
If all the people vote who they, you know, who could vote, I'm not talking about her percentage, just a big turnout, then Kerry can win
If the living and breeding people stay home if they're intimidated, if they're stupid, and Pennsylvania registered voters give Kerry a five point lead, 49, 45, 44, but among likely voters, it's Bush 48, Kerry 47, likely voters
Although the good deal is, Nate Nader's off the ballot now, in Pennsylvania
And in Iowa, half said they would vote for the Kerry Edwards ticket 50 percent against 44 percent for the Bush Cheney ticket
But in likely voters, Kerry 51, Bush 46
So actually, I always do okay, Iowa, 20, Iowa ain't all I've had, some of them good corn fed folks
They sure, that corn sure is special, I want to say that right now, just asking it, baby
27 past one at five, 60 WQM, I think I'm a little incoherent now, mad dog coming up at two o'clock this afternoon

What are we going to do about that bitch Joyce?
27-2 at 5-60 W.C.Y.M.
She's the Chigren Woodpile, a bit of a Naples formier,
over the Beasley Corporate Bubblehead.
Yeah, a Bubblehead doll.
Because seriously, she's the one that put all these other restrictions on her,
sure it's not the FCC.
There are lots of things that they're saying, oh, you can't say that.
Based on her just arbitrarily making it out.
Based on her lack of understanding of the FCC dictates.
She just doesn't say anything, makes her go really easy.
Like for example, Joyce is a bitch who is a clueless bitch.
Can't say that.
What that awful LA Times pull really means,
the LA Times pull released last Thursday has created substantial consternation among Democrats,
not only the mainstream media, but many pro-democratic writers and commentators
have accepted the pull of the parent message that the sleazy attacks on Kerry's wartime record
have been successful and allowed Bush to overtake Kerry to presidential race.
The bad news is that this perception has been widely accepted.
The good news is that it's fundamentally wrong.
Let's start with the Kerry Boge horse race numbers.
One of the LA Times pull found Bush's support among registered voters rising
from 46% in July to 49% August 22nd to 24th,
and Kerry supports dropping 48% to 46% in the same period.
Three other pulls by major polling organizations found entirely different patterns.
August 23 to 25, Gallup Polar Regency Roters found Kerry had 4847.
At the beginning of August, Gallup showed Kerry and Bush tied 48 a piece.
August 23 to 25th NBC Wall Street Euronell pulled found a three-point lead for Bush unchanged
since July 22.
A Fox opinion dynamics pull found Kerry 46, Bors 43,
August 24 to 26, Kerry was up 20, at 2% from July 20 to 22nd,
and Bush 1% down during that period.
In short, the four major pull conducted since August 20th don't reveal any consistent or substantial
pro-Borche swing such as would be expected from a successful attack on John Kerry's war record
and character during the week and a half before.
Instead, the only generalization that could be made from looking at a broader group of over 20
pulls of registered and likely voters since the beginning of August is a slight and gradual shrinkage
of about 3 or 4% in Kerry's lead.
If August had been a slow news month, this trend would almost certainly have been described
in an inevitable coming back down to worth, following the run of positive news coverage,
Kerry had enjoyed for several months during the spring and the Democratic Convention.
Instead, because the attacks on Kerry's medals and military service were intensely dramatic
and widely covered, many commentators simply assumed that any changes in the opinion
pulls had to be due to their influence.
But the data in the LA Times, other recent polls, is actually more consistent with a different interpretation
that a certain decline in Kerry's support, especially among veterans, was inevitable as voters
began to pay more attention to the campaign.
On the other hand, that had a show that the swift vote, ever gets attacked on Kerry medals and services
been as it risked the deserved to be an almost unmitigated fiasco.
So while they're trying to peddle you with something that it's about,
oh, look how this is really hurting Kerry in about how Bush's Yankee had all of this,
a bunch of crap.
It's a potable crap.
It's partly spin, as they would say, in the Noah's Spin Zone.
Got a great article by Eleanor Clifft.
Remember Eleanor Clifft?
I do remember her.
From that bit?
Right.
What's the name of that bit?
The McLaughlin Group.
Well, what is wrong with you?
Boy, you are so...
I'll never be in there, too.
No.
No.
From Washington, the McLaughlin Group, featuring Eleanor Clifft, Jack Jamon,
and sitting in for Pat Buchanan, New York Giant Tiki Barber.
Now, here's John McLaughlin.
Issue on, George W.
Rings of Walt, Eleanor Clifft.
Well, John, I'm not going to say it.
Wrong!
Jack Jamon!
Well, that's not an easy choice.
Wrong!
Tiki Barber!
I'm going to have to say it, but wrong!
Actual answer for exercise!
That wasn't even a choice!
Next issue!
Al Gore!
Favorite Broadway show!
Bringing the noise, bringing the punk or cats!
Eleanor, do you think it's well enough?
Well, John, I'm not the same!
Wrong!
Jacky Jacky, big job on!
Well, that's a very difficult choice.
Wrong!
Tiki Barber!
I'm going to have to say, right?
Not a choice!
Riki Tiki Barber!
You gave it as a lesson!
It wasn't a choice!
Wrong!
Correct with fonts!

He loves them!
Next issue!
The cast of Big Brother should be murdered!
How?
Eleanor!
Wrong!
Jack Jamon!
I know, mate!
Wrong!
Tiki Barber!
I don't think they should be Tiki Barber!
Wrong!
Actual answer!
Poison pudding!
Bye-bye!
Bye-bye!
That is one of the all-time greats.
But of course, if you haven't seen the show,
it doesn't mean anything, no.
See, once you saw the show,
I saw a little bit of the night-greater significance.
Didn't have any of those people in it.
My boy!
He didn't have LRG, I think he didn't have that one.
Forget who it did have on it.
Oh, man.
Had to be candid on it.
Oh, God!
Anyway, well, so he's got a great article here.
It's called Political Terrorist Bush and Sleeper Sails.
All it takes is a wicked enough from the White House,
and this network springs into waxes.
Good article.
Good calm.
I might just read it when we come back after the break.
Wow!
You're amazing!
Oh, my God, your breasts are beautiful.
Let's do the shake.
All right.
Let's get it through the shake.
Wait your hands up and down.
Let's shake them all around.
I'll try to move your leg.
Let's get it through the shake.
Let's get it through the shake.
I'll shake them through the hands.
Shake them through the right.
Do the jacket, Reno, shake, shake,
With all of your life, all of their lives.
Let's do the jacket, Reno, shake.
All right, so have the make-of-round.
Whoa!
The jacket, Reno, shake.
Whoa!
The jacket, Reno, shake.
144-60, though, that's in very poor taste, by the way, George.
I think you're a spoiler clip, right?
Political Terrorist, yadi-adi-adi.
Kyle Roef makes Chuck Colson look like a girly man.
Colson didn't have the audacity to go after John Kerry's military record
when President Nixon was looking for dirt on anti-war leaders.
After researching Kerry's metals, Colson, who now heads of
prison ministry program, backed off.
Maybe Chuck knew he was going to find Jesus back then because he had a degree of shame,
so as a senior staffer to a center of Republican.
The Kerry campaign thinks he had succeeded in discrediting the Scorra-Lis attack on Kerry's military service,
but Roef got what he wanted.
Instead of talking about a failed war in Iraq and a new report that shows
1.3 million more Americans living in poverty,
we're debating what happened in the Maycon Delta 1968.
The strategy came straight from the West Wing, says the GOP staffer.
Nobody should be confused.
As to explain, this Republican says Roef is smart enough to keep technical distance,
but all it takes is a well-placed wink to activate a web of bush-family hitmen,
confidence, and deep-pocket donors.
They know what to do, like sleeper cells that get activated.
He says, likening the players to political terrorists.
They sprang into action in 2000 when Bush was running in the primaries against John McCain.
After getting beaten in New Hampshire by McCain, Bush's first event was at Bob Jones University,
in South Carolina.
Standing next to Bush on the stage was a veteran who went right at McCain,
questioning his Vietnam service while Bush remained silent.
A whisper campaign told voters that McCain had a black child.
The McCain's have an adopted daughter from Bangladesh.
McCain lost the primary. The veteran became a Bush administration appointee.
The charges advanced by the so-called SWIFT, both veterans for truth would never hold up in a court of law.
These men would have us believe, contrary to Navy records and countless eyewitnesses,
that Kerry did not act heroically and had a grand plan to manipulate medals from the military.
Two bad Bob Dole got hauled into this mess.
Once known principally as a GOP hatchet man, Dole had rehabbed himself over the years to wore hero and sardonic wit.
Then over the weekend he said, all SWIFT-boat veterans for truth can't be Republican liars.
It's the old where's this where they're smoked, there's fire routine.
Why would Dole allow himself to be used like that?
He must have forgotten how Bush's father provoked him during the 1988 GOP primaries with sleazy allegations.
When Vice President Bush approached him on the Senate floor, Dole blurted out, quit lying about my record.
The remark helped sink Dole's chance of an nomination.
My Republican mole on Capitol Hill says the Green Light is going out to Republicans to do whatever it takes to get Bush elected.
This is the way we hold on to power, he says, with disgust.
Postard John Zagbys survey of battleground states taking last week as the SWIFT-boat controversy raged,
shows no fundamental change in the race.
It's running its course and it made boomerang, he says, in the attack on Kerry's heroism.
The fact that the sleeper network has gone nuclear is evidence of Bush's weakness not strankzog, we says.
If the Bush team weren't seeing serious damage, they wouldn't be hitting so hard so early.
The President is on the ropes, there's no other way of looking at it.
A lot of Vietnam vets will never forgive Kerry for accusing them of committing atrocities.
Kerry's conceded some hyperbole in his 1971 Senate testimony, but didn't need Toledo Blade when appealed surprise this year for uncovering Vietnam era atrocities.
And we've forgotten about the meal I'm asked to go in Zipo, lighters burning down Hootches.
Maybe a few masochists wanted to debate whether if Vietnam was a noble cause, but 58,000 of our soldiers died.
The war was a waste, whether you want the right or the left.
Kerry leveled most of his criticism at political leaders who did not tell the truth and was sanctioned search and destroy missions that invited war crimes.
By the time Kerry testified in 1971, 44,000 American soldiers already were dead.
The war had almost no popular support yet another 14,000 lives would be lost.
The irony is that Kerry does have courage, the very quality of this smarmy campaign seeks to denigrate.
The rap on him is that he slowed a battle that it takes a near death experience to get him fully engaged.
By assailing his heroism, the GOP may have done Kerry a favor.
Maybe they've awakened the sleeping giant.
Says the Eleanor Clifft, you I think is the owner.
Yeah, well, you never know.
He might get out of that Herman Munster trance before we don't start really coming to life, baby.
He's animated.
Going to rain.
We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.
We're going to California and Texas and New York.
We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.
And then we're going to Washington DC to take back the way house.
Yeah, 755 votes on a poll so far, not too bad, which it is or was of most interest to you.
The hurricane Francis is on their mind. Francis O'Hare, Arlene Francis, Francis the Immune.
And we got the weather channels standing by.
But they're in the spot right now.
No, but at 10, 40 hour they do their scary, scary report.
Yeah, we are on the 10, 40s.
Pretty weak.
Pretty lame if you ask me.
And then that guy in there, the one thing you've told us about.
Well, in 1926 and 41 or 43 or 46, this is the exact track that was on when it just battered the hell out of Florida.
I think he's a kind of bar in orcross.
Maybe they're doing something.
Anyway, which of these is most important?
Hurricane Francis, 370.4.3% out of 760.
When it's hand coming back, 157.
Good question and a quarry mind.
We like to know sometime this week we're getting pretty tired of this crap.
That was funny.
How bad will the dolphins do this year?
68 and it ate too great.
The Democratic Convention, 53, Olympic's 50, Howard Spurmshow, 49.
Today's election, the primary, I like anybody, Neil.
I like that Peter Doich, 40.
The Republican Convention, 29 and the MTV Awards out of 760 votes, 7.
Just in our crowd, you know?
No.
We just don't have that young hip-hop crowd.
If we place them more, hip-hop.
Maybe that's what we're going to do.
We're ready.
These extras, now that we got all this extra time this week, right?
Now that they should end early on tape.
No, I don't mean that, but like since we usually don't come out to like 1030,
maybe until about 1030, 1045, you get the audience used to joining us in progress.
We'll play like a bunch of hip-hop crap.
We'll spin the hits.
Right, especially the part that uses all those four letter words that we can't say,
but they can say because it's a racial thing.
That's what I'm going to do on Labor Day.
Now what about power 96 down the hall?
Are they playing a bunch of nasty stuff?
Ask kids, scurvy, he'll tell you.
I did ask him.
And what did he say?
He said, this company can support me, us, and what we do on our radio station.
And a story or not.
In other words, they are playing a bunch of films.
In other words, they're doing what they do.
They're doing what they want to do.
Right.
As dirty as they want to run in the sense that we're going to do what they do.
As filthy and disgusting and grotesque as they want to me.
Do what we're entitled to.
Oh, I can say that that is.
All right.
You want to sing to Neil Rogers.
And let's listen to our 560, 60, 80, 80, 80.
I'll crack it in and hold it.
Ow!
She's wearing a toy we know.
Looks like the flaker rose down.
Snows from the body roll balls.
Barbara Bush had body down and I stole the rice not down.
It happened when she realized.
She raised her grin in a cloud.
Barbara Bush had body down and I stole the rice not down.
And she said to me, hold it, crack me.
And she raised her face with that face with a trowel stick.
And she said, I'm great to have anyone else to say why no boy.
What's like she's carrying a golden ball between her thighs and thighs.
Body down and I.
She's at the feet of a fox.
And that she's always a frown.
She's wearing a white cheese sauce.
Barbara Bush had body down and I stole the rice.
And she said to me, hold it, crack me.
And she said, I'm great to have you.
Barbara Bush has had body down and I stole the rice.
So how does that help?
I think you owe another apology to the audience because you didn't correct me. I believe before I miss spoken said that Francis is a category three
It's a four right now. It was a three no because it was 125. I miss it. It was a zero one then went to 135
Which makes it a four and they just got through saying on the weather channel that it could be a five by the time it hits land although
Yeah, I still I'm looking at that with my own naked eyes my barber bush eyes and Marty Feldman
They could you work on it? I it looks to me like it's wobbling a little northwest now. I could be wrong
But I'm thinking South Carolina that sounds about right. They're there anyway and Wishing and pretty used to it Charles
Yeah, I had a hell with them. They're much among wumps anyway
Calling language in the Republican Party's platform vicious and mean spirited a
Group of key and lesbian Republicans launched a TV ad yesterday aimed at challenging the National Convention delegates to change the party's direction
Cute. See that's what them self-hated the adorable flags that deserve anyway
Yeah, and it's like a bunch of black folks in the clans and I think you guys are going in a wrong direction man
You ought to tilt them hoes in the opposite direction make no sense
self-hating queens
The radical right is hijacked the party and we're fighting back Bill Brownson
He's watching that eye too on a Francis that Brown I
Bill Brownson a spokesman for the law of cabinet Republican Senate news conference the party's platform adopted an advance of the convention rejects not only same-sex marriage
But also even rejects benefits for same-sex couples
It also rejects letting openly gay people serve in the military does not offer a unity plank
Which would encourage respect for Republicans who disagree with the party majority on social issues
Law cabinet officials described themselves as angry and frustrated
Well, I have a really easy solution for them. Okay, that is come out of the closet
Quit being a bunch of self-hating queens and join a real party where they're not so great either but least they give you a little something a little bone well
The ad featuring words from Ronald Reagan began running in New Year. That's Ronald Reagan
Junior. Oh, okay, isn't it?
Ronnie, Jr
began running in New York Monday
I've known to reach convention delegates the group is posted in the peel for donations on its website to finance the ad
The ad begins with audio of Reagan saying oh no, it says the old man right whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone
I hope it a record that I appeal to your best hopes not your worst fears. That's kind of ironic a
Narrated then says if we will record the Republican party's choice
We will unite other things that matter most like winning the war on terror
Will we divide the American family with a politics of intolerance and fear that only lead the hate our choices clear
That's right the Republican party which is about the politics of fear and hate or the weakling a weak need democratic party
Which is the only choice you got or that daughtering old fool Ralph Nader
We're gonna be in the president
A bunch of other places either
Who goes to Vegas to show you what a hot shot he is and says that gambling is evil and it's bad and yoddy-oddy
I still say they ought to take like a
Fan belt from a 1960 Corvere which I was my first car was a 60-core bear nice little car
I ought to take a fan belt from there and like stick it deep in his rectum until the election's over
Okay, we got one of the shelf. We got one fan belt from the great. Okay. We got fans all over the place
Okay, we got the mad dog coming up next. I think my prediction is Thursday. Okay, South Carolina for Hurricane France
Okay, Thursday for the Humphre we had to like alter that a little bit whether permitting a course
