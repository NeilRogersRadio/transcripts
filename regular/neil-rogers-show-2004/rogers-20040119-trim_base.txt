I'm a roover Republican.
Why'd San Cermone is Christ God?
My colleagues have a think tank.
Where we pull off cranks.
And dress up like we're all just gone.
Oh, my God.
We'll tell you what's just and right.
And I don't run your life.
Because our moral ground is so much higher.
And we'll decide what you should think.
While dressed in place.
As we rinse the nuts off of you, come back.
Of which you go be, friends, the stars.
Bearing the packs of America.
As with a strange or short.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
We support our thickin' bush.
And shave our twish.
Comedias in our control.
Ha, ha, ha.
Sometimes John Ascroft comes around.
Pills his pants down.
Or up to put our tongues up his bonhole.
Ha, ha, when jeep will be transvestite.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
In the packs of America.
In the scrap.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh.
Since I wish you go be transvestite.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
In the packs of America.
In the scrap.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
All right.
10-0-2-5-60.
W-Q-M.
Happy Monday.
Happy Martin Luther King Day.
Better not say Martin Luther Kuhnday this year, George.
Somebody's gonna get a really upset about that.
Be got.
Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
That's Dr.
How about those patriots, huh?
That's Dr. Dean D. U. Mr.
That's Dr. Dean. That's Governor Dean D. U.
President Dean.
I don't think so.
Well, we'll see.
1627 votes on the pool from Friday.
Well, we get a lot of stuff to catch up on.
I know the levels are all over the place.
The speakers are all screwed up.
But the good part of it is there's nobody here.
That's the best part because it's a busman's holiday.
Didn't look like no holiday on the turn pack this morning coming to work.
Yeah, these levels are all screwed up in here, too.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
George is under the table.
I think he's looking for Cheryl under there.
Maybe Cheryl's going to the dentist today so she can open wide.
But at any rate, I agree with you.
I think that the Joros sexual from 8 to 10 will be a gigantic improvement
over the Davie and Danny and Danny and Davie.
You know, I think you'll be great at that.
How you doing?
He's married a couple times.
He's got.
He's gotten later couple times.
Sure.
Big football player.
Big Jack.
Probably been around the whole.
Can you imagine California, Jack Nolas?
Can you imagine?
Well, the stories that he could tell.
We better than that.
Aaron Summers prude show.
Right.
Honey bears.
Honey bears.
Who the hell wants to hear that crap?
Well, don't forget, see Alice.
What?
If you can't get it up, see Alice.
Don't get it up for you.
No, see Alice is the new Viagra.
Oh, they were promoted on a game.
Of course you didn't see it because you didn't want to sell them football games.
Like the Patriots kicking some serious cold hands.
All right.
Yeah, but they were lucky and they got all the calls.
You know what?
Too bad.
Jealousy.
Sour grapes.
That's this town, man.
Sour grapes.
Here is always whining and how come we couldn't do this and we couldn't do that.
Meantime, Robert Krab goes out and hires the best coach in football and they wouldn't, uh,
the Super Bowl two years ago, they're going to go to do it again this year.
Nothing could be finer than beating up on Carolina.
That's what I always said.
So anyway, George is the only white man in America who didn't watch that ball game yesterday.
Both of them.
I mean, the second game was so boring.
I don't know.
Whoever the hell was playing.
Patriots and somebody.
Okay, so like I said, what?
Nothing.
Just you better get with it, mister.
You're going to be way out there on the fringes of society.
All right.
I was speaking among the fringes of society.
This latest rating book that came out, those spickety English, baby.
I'm going to go.
What is this?
Yeah, some of you guys.
You just do this on both lines with this.
Okay.
How do they get this style?
It's in Georgeville, Translate.
La moña ca, que raya de ca, que ca, que el adulto.
La moña ca, que rame.
La moña ca, que ca, que el adulto.
Little doll, rumo y ca, peque, sing with ducks.
Rimes with duck.
So anyway, there's a Celia Cruz.
I understand that there's eight Celian Brazilians now taking over Pompe and Obich and Dearfield Beach, where they come from.
Besides Brazilians.
Where do they come from?
How do they get here?
Smuggling.
Is that part of the new open leg and open-ass policy of George W.
Is that what it's all about?
You know, since 9-11, since we really secured the border.
Right.
And we're being really careful now.
No, no, seriously, where do how did Brazilians come from?
I won't tell that they want to be here for anyway.
We don't like cross-dresses that much here.
Across breeders.
So anyway, the book came out Friday.
I noticed my close personal friend Mo, and we better get that straightened out.
I thought I was straightened out.
A couple of days ago.
Yeah.
What?
No, I clarified that on this show.
A couple of days ago.
Right.
There you go.
You know, he kind of sucked me in there, so to speak for one day.
Oh, yes, my good friend.
Then, blah, blah, blah.
You know, after we had a shouting match in a parking lot.
And I said, I can't do it.
And I can't.
And I won't.
You make me nauseous, Mo.
But I will, you know, I'll talk to him like this morning.
I'm going to work.
There's nobody here except the, uh, on the air people.
And I pulled into parking lot under there.
And he's got, I see his headlights around.
And that big, uh, Juma Bill, he's driving whatever that thing is.
What is that?
That white, uh, a Jaguar?
Is it?
I think so.
Well, whatever it is.
And so I see he's in there.
So he's going to, he's ready to pull out.
That's what Gildi said.
He loves it when Mo pulls out.
And, uh, and he would have thought if there was going to be any verbal intercourse,
it would have been right there.
Because I'm just getting out of my car.
I got my little briefcase.
And instead, as I'm getting out, he whips around and then goes outside the, uh, thing.
And it stops in front of the bushes.
So I guess he wanted to be safe.
Just in case I brought my water pistol or something.
And he stops and the other side of the bushes rolls down the window.
And he waves and I wave back at him.
Because I'll be civil team all.
I mean, I'll speak to you a little bit.
I'm not here that much anyway.
Thank God.
But, uh, I can't stand you.
And he's the only, I was just thinking.
He's the only person I know who talks to you like this.
He is the same stentorian pontification of the year as you get on the year.
See, now with Ferrell, he was the same off the years on the year.
At least he was fine.
He was, you know, he was a panning.
He was a funny guy.
There ain't nothing funny about Mo.
Especially when you know that it's him against the world.
In other words, in his mind, the whole world is out of step except him.
He's, he's goose stepping along just the way you're supposed to.
And all the rest of us were out of step.
So nobody is ever going to meet up to his expectations.
And I heard the comments about the book and he's going to help us out.
What can we do now?
And he's gloating about the fact that they dropped the least.
Anybody on the station in the last book when it came out on Friday.
They dropped the least.
The only problem with that being that there's still the lowest rated day part on the station.
And they still have the lowest share.
But other than that.
And it wasn't minuscule.
It was like a half a point.
And when you're only starting out with like a, what have they got?
I don't want to give a wrong number.
When you got a five three, which was great counting that bogus October.
And that's not a before eight.
It's still not bad.
But what's going to happen rather than they lose the October and the next trend?
You know what I mean?
Uh oh.
You thought of what I'm saying?
No.
In addition to which on probably Wednesday.
Wednesday will have the hour by hour.
And we'll see who is doing it in there between, you know, in the fallbook.
Right.
Comes down to it.
But keep in mind his philosophy.
It's not important that you succeed, but that everybody else fails worse than you do.
Right.
Everybody else.
The only problem would be that we were number two.
And I got a nice bonus out of that through some miracle because overall the station was number three.
And the afternoon was like, what do they get?
They were also number two.
And no, wait, where the hell were they?
Number three.
So number two in a midday, number three in the afternoon and tied for fourth and a morning.
Two checks.
Right.
That's right for some of us.
So don't spend that bonus all in one place, but I'm delighted that you dropped only miniscule.
Man in total denial.
Just forget about it.
Here's the pull from Friday.
Which of these do you care about the most?
Should have put getting laid on there.
I bet you I bet you a Sherrow would have voted a hundred times.
Human pin cushion.
The NFL playoffs 417.
Let's hear it from his pants.
Quick, be a such a bunch of sorry losers down here.
Man, so sad.
Oh, gee, they're lucky and the officials didn't make those calls.
Yeah.
NFL playoffs 417.
The Iowa primary 253.
It's two day, baby.
This is the big day.
Anybody care about it?
No.
When is mold leaving 195?
Can you believe that more people were concerned about when is mold leaving?
When is Dave Wonsdale leaving?
Which I think is quite an accomplishment.
I told him a couple of days ago that we all him.
Hockey 100.
Hockey 162.
Big game this afternoon at the Macarena.
It's the Martin Luther King annual holiday day show game at 5 this afternoon.
Blue, Samboody, Blues and your Panthers.
Bobby Lovongo, by the way, made 50 saves against Tampa's Saturday.
On me to leave it.
Bobby, your God.
It's all I can tell you.
He's the whole team.
He's it.
The best.
I don't want to hear about Mark Tambordur and this one and that one.
He's the best period.
He's phenomenal.
If forward for him, they wouldn't even, no more contender.
They wouldn't even compete in any game.
Anybody know who revered to Lovongo?
No.
No.
Hockey 162, which are very suspect.
When's for all coming back?
159 out of 1637 votes.
Is he still down here?
Do we know?
What are you looking at me like that for?
I don't know.
Well, that was my question.
We don't know.
When's for all come back?
159.
When is Dave Wonstat leaving 149?
Moe had a beat by a pretty good margin.
Who killed Cock Robyn 143?
I just threw that in.
We were find out.
Not yet.
We're still working on it.
We're still working on the Robin part.
Sending a man to the moon 108.
The Michael Jackson case only 2080.
Hoptop on that limo.
And even Jeffrey Tubenon, CNN, was hyperventilating this morning.
About it was one of the most dramatic things he's ever seen.
And I thought to myself, what an asshole.
Like everything that they do.
Or is an orchestra.
And I say if they, him and his handlers, it's all orchestrated.
And he gets up on there and he's like, you know,
clapping his hands and snapping the fingers.
All these morons, these lunatics, these lifeless crazy people.
You know, that would be a good pull someday.
Which celebrity has the most pathetic fan?
Elvis?
O.J.?
Michael Jackson.
I'm sure there's some others.
I mean, Oprah.
You're looking at those people.
Yeah, Oprah.
That'd be good pull.
Maybe we'll do that.
We'll be doing that tomorrow.
The sickest cult.
Yeah.
Following.
It's just, it's tragic.
And then you think back to the, oh, you go, O.J.?
Here's the guy that just butchered, murdered two people
and pulled the white people though.
A bigger part.
They were white people.
What do you mean they were white people?
He murdered white people.
Yeah, but most of the people on the bridges were white people too.
That were cheering them on.
Oh, I didn't see that.
Yeah.
Well, you better get with it, mister.
Just because he used to wear a jock.
Oh, he's so...
He's sending him out of the moon one, one, one, eight.
Michael Jackson case only 28.
So I better not read that stuff from the inquire, but I will anyway.
Because you're lying.
And Scott Lacey Peterson case only 22, which we don't,
we don't address that on this show.
We don't recognize them.
They're like red China.
What?
I don't care about that.
I don't care about that story.
I don't care about him.
I don't care about her rest in peace, the baby.
I don't care about why, why should I care?
Because the media says I'm supposed to care.
I don't give a crap.
I care about all those other ones.
We're not hearing about them.
Right.
I care about every other murder victim that we don't hear about.
Whoever they might be.
Let us know who they are.
Okay, let's do the three, two polls today.
The first one, of course, you know what that's going to be.
Because we got the Iowa caucus tonight.
You know something about that, right?
Mm-hmm.
Why not?
Sure.
Hello, the caucus.
Hello, the second one.
Michael Duke caucus.
12 minutes after 10 at 5.60.
QM, we actually got a few spots today.
Come on, and look, all the time.
It's just 4.20 on 5.60.
QAM.
Fuck behind it again or under it.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
I'm not going to be here.
Wouldn't you?
If we have to choose between getting the speakers working on all the equipment right or having nobody here, we'll take the waiters right now.
How long we work it out?
We've done a fine job so far.
We're still on the year.
We've got the spots going.
Look at that tremendous response on the phone here so far.
QAM.
Pretty good.
Happy holiday to you.
Yeah, happy everything.
I've been pulling for Howard Dean a lot lately, but I was listening on seeing him to Scary Carry.
He seems to be a little bit stronger in his views than Howard Dean.
Dean is self-destructing.
I still think he's going to win that though.
I think Dean is still going to win the Iowacockas tonight.
But I think he's self-immolating.
You see Gephard's Clinton victory.
Gephard's done.
Gephard's finished.
He had a strong speech yesterday, but...
He's done.
Carey's got the blackboard now on his side.
How many black people are there in Iowa?
About 30.
Yeah.
I've been going to you.
Okay, you two.
Here's the latest, the final Zogby pool from Iowa where the caucus is going on today.
And tonight we can all sit there gathered around the TV breathlessly.
No, we won't.
Won't you be sitting breathlessly, a gathered around it?
No.
How about the TV?
Final pool in Iowa.
The Reuters MSNBC Zogby Schwartz Puppock Pool.
Carey 25% Dean 22%.
John Edwards 21%.
Dick Gephard in fourth place at 18%.
Who has no more money.
And if he doesn't win Iowa, he's finished.
He won't.
He won't say that.
But he's done.
He's done anyway.
So there you go.
Carey 25% Dean 22.
Edwards 21.
Gephard fourth 18%.
So that's our first pool today.
We'll keep it up till noon.
And we'll work on this other one.
We'll be working on our pool.
Who are you pulling for today as Iowa caucuses?
And they only put the names...
Is Shartton?
He was in the debates.
Yeah.
Right?
Right?
So Carey mostly browned.
She's out because she dropped out and supported Dean.
Clark is not competing in Iowa.
And either is due Lieberman.
Although he was in the debates, but I'm not putting him on her anyway.
Because he's not going to do nothing.
Who are you pulling for today as Iowa caucuses?
Carey, Edwards, Dean, Gephard, who said it, Sharpton.
None of them. I'm for Bush.
It just scares me to even say the words now.
You know what?
It's terrifying.
Even say that.
I'm for Bush.
Oh, God.
Say it again.
It hurts.
So that's our first pool.
We'll get it up there.
In a meantime, the second pool.
I'll be for we do that.
Police stop playing a rest murder suspect in Miami.
Police stop the taxing plane yesterday to a rest of the man they say killed his ex-girlfriend
and her mother.
And left her four-year-old daughter wandering around Miami International Airport.
Jason Nelson, 26, was arrested by a day police early yesterday morning.
The body of 21-year-old Robin Golder was found in a wooded area by a day police about
4 a.m. Sunday morning.
Said the Lee County Sheriff's Office, Bookswoman Ilyena Lee Marci.
Golder's daughter was found at the airport.
It's been reunited with family at their home in Lehigh Acres where Golder's mother, 53-year-old
Julie Helmsmeer, was found shot at Saturday night.
Lehigh Acres is about 110 miles northwest of Miami.
Lee Marci said Nelson was on a flight leaving the country but didn't know where he'd been
headed.
Nelson was being held in Miami pending murder charges with expected to be charged in
Lehigh with murder possibly kidnapping.
They ain't to murder off the plane.
That's great.
Good work.
Nice going, boys.
You go.
Now the second pool we're going to own before we do the pool.
Because Friday we got the ratings at about 1 o'clock and we did you know like Mo did say we didn't do horrible.
We didn't do great and he sure as hell didn't do great but nevertheless you know he went down a
minisculee.
There is a guy that's always going to rationalize no matter what the number is you know just give them your
numbers out you don't we have to have a judgment just give the number out schmuck he can't do it.
Hey look on the bright side.
He probably don't even know what the numbers are what there are people listening to the positive number where
now.
Yeah I don't think so right now.
Or how about when he's on are there people listening?
I'm listening.
Oh that's good.
And he claims he doesn't listen.
Well he's probably still on a long slow ride up to Boka.
I mean he doesn't have below Riley kind of numbers.
No he doesn't have the big.
Oh!
I checked that.
I'm glad you mentioned that.
I checked that again in this tram book.
He didn't show up again on the radio.
No.
He has a 0.0 infinity.
Take it all right.
He doesn't work for infinity but he might as well because he's got zero to the uh,
nth degree.
Nobody's listening to below Riley on the radio.
So for all of his talking bluster he ain't got nobody listening.
Not even Mr. Ego's also got a zero.
Men 2554.
What about Trump plus?
You think we could find a number from Mr. Ego?
I believe that's WNNMMMMA.
NMAA.
That's what I wouldn't know.
Nobody would know because uh, oh no I take that back he's got a 0.4.
Let's hear it for Steve O.
All right.
A 0.4 share.
In other words you could put his audience in a phone book and have room left for a college
fret house.
How do you like that?
Another exciting?
A 0.4.
And uh, and Fox Sports went way down too.
See here's what it boils down to.
And that is that the people who know speaking English they know how to play the game.
They get their diaries and it's like voting.
And now they're, it's just a numbers game.
I mean the rest of us who speak English were so outnumbered that it's just a matter of time before every station.
What have I been saying?
All this assimilation bull track is just that it's bull track.
We might let you get some of it.
The only thing I want on the cable is uh, S-Bun-Mill-NMMM.
Start assimilating.
Pick it up on it.
Pick it up on it.
That's right.
No, no, no, we got to start assimilating.
With the O-Sprix that's what it boils down to.
Or we're dead.
We're done.
You can pay rent.
I just like that talk about it.
Very nice.
I hit it right in the ass.
Hey, Silia.
Hit the post.
I'm listening.
Okay.
I hope you're enjoying it.
I told him in the parking lot this morning we better learn to speak English and uh, Portugese.
Because now we got all these Brazilians.
I am challenging this audience.
I'd like to hear one Brazilian call in today.
Do you think we have any Brazilians listening?
No.
Not one?
Not one.
Not even one?
Country for the hell of it.
Plus we don't speak a portugese which is very, very different than Spanish.
You wouldn't make any way through.
They're like every...
Very different.
It's like the Italian.
Yeah.
Yeah, like I understand Italian.
There we go.
100th word.
Or like Dutch.
Every 10,000th word.
I'll still believe it.
So anyway, that's the word.
So let me say it again.
If you people, not just this station, but English language people.
And not just the anglos but the Julio's.
Anybody who listens to English language radio, you're going to have to start learning how to play the game.
Right.
You have to listen loyally.
Right?
And write it down.
Listen loyally, write it down.
Don't just, you know, don't lie.
Don't just slut off.
But when they ask you, you've got to say...
I'm listening.
And say...
I like that.
And they very stentorian tone.
And a condescending stentorian tone.
Like you're looking down your nose at those people in Beltsville, Maryland.
And you probably should.
This is the worst.
And again, it sounds like sour grapes I probably shouldn't say it.
I can handle B number two.
It's still money.
But WCNQFN does anybody believe they're number one?
No.
If they hootie koochi music.
In fact, look how long it took us to find anybody.
Well, that's because they don't listen to what they'll listen to them.
See?
See?
See this?
But it's just...
When you look at magic, for example, tragic magic in midday.
Goes from number 12 of 3.7 Shear and Men, which is about what they usually get to a 5.3.
Does anybody believe that every all day?
And you look at night.
This is Men 25 to 54.
W-L-Y-F radio slush.
Even a carpenter's wouldn't listen if she was alive.
They got out there number one.
At night.
And the daytime one usually have big numbers.
Because everybody's like a captive audience in our office somewhere.
Then they went into the tank.
So this is the most spastic waiting book I've ever seen.
But we'll take the bonus thank you.
And we'll see.
We'll stick with it.
Right.
Catching is right.
WCNQFN.
So I'm looking here in midday.
I don't want to dwell on this, but I will just for my night.
It's holiday.
Now listen.
Spanish language listening went up 6.8% from the summer to the fall.
See if they're to be believed.
All the specs and half the angloser listening to Spanish language radio.
Right.
And even stations like Arario Mambi and La Cubanissima, they went up.
Right.
Now how's that possible?
That's from the summer book to the fall book.
What is it that's going on that all of a sudden all of you know speaking English?
Is Fidel dying over there?
Oh, do you see that star?
He is dying.
We had that on our website.
Fidel's dead.
Another rumor.
Oh no, no, no, no.
Yeah.
Get on that banana book.
Get your rubber raft out.
Time to go back Fidel is dead.
And see the cruise.
How do you like that for a combo, huh?
So we'll do the best we can.
All you Anglo people out there.
You people out there.
You're not just this station even.
Rush.
Rush comes back from his rehab.
And even they went down a midday.
Fox locks everybody.
Everybody who speaks English went in a crapper and no speaking English.
It's a bad music.
Magic and the coast.
The coast.
Anybody listen to the coast?
No.
I think Disney got all the diaries.
28 past 10 at 560.
Walt Disney got him.
Kind of a Mickey Mouse book if you ask me.
Hey, if you're trying to lose weight desperately, you made you knew you're resolution for the
Under the year in a row.
But you're still a fat tub bottle under one.
I hear Josh Friedman's bigger than ever.
That's the rumor.
And smells bad.
But in any rate, you know, in fact, he tried to state the stomach stapling.
Did it work?
No.
No.
People that try a...
Oh, and everywhere you look now, you see Atkins.
You only promise that it is that nobody knows what to eat anymore.
And even the Atkins people are saying, well, don't eat so much meat.
And don't eat such big steaks.
Here's the answer for it.
Balance for life.
They do the work for it.
It's based on the zone diet.
And even Dr. Atkins is changing his tune now.
He wishes he were still around the cash in on his diet.
But in any rate, balance for life brings you all the food delicious food right to your
door every morning by 6am.
You don't have to count calories or carbs.
You don't have to do any cooking or figuring anything out.
And the food is fresh and delicious.
Our lovely Katrina here is lost over 17 pounds of balance for life.
Probably more, but we don't see her no more.
I think mommy's got her under the desk hidden away.
And anyway, so if you're frustrated because you've tried all the other diets, and you're still fat as a tub
and maybe diabetic run a verge of it, take it from me.
Somebody who's battled weight for 100 years now, that's no fun.
This is easy.
It's a piece of cake without the carbohydrates.
And not only that, but they let you choose between two choices for each meal every day that you're on a program.
You fell out of menu once a week, face it back at them.
And you've got great food coming fresh.
Delicious.
Nothing frozen.

Q.
I'm happy Monday to eat happy Martin Luther King day.
Now, the pool just went up there, I guess, because he's having a little bit of a technical defugulity.
Just like we are with these speakers.
But that's okay, because we don't really give a crap.
Here's the second pool for later on for like afternoon, which we can start working on now.
Or not as the case, maybe.
What pre-1980 movie do you think is a must see for people to render by?
In other words, we got a lot of people.
Let's see, it's 23 years ago.
Right.
So if you're 30, if you're about 30, man.
We're seven years old in 1980.
Right?
So even if the movie was from 80, there's no chance that you would have seen it when it was out.
So since everybody in their brother now is desperate for movies on DVD or VHS, if you're like really, you know, old-fashioned.
Do you think any people are really, I guess they must be, because they're still in the stores.
Yeah, I know.
Well, don't you think we ought to buy a DVD player for everybody who can't afford one?
That's about a five.
That should be part of the presidential campaign.
Anybody who can't afford a DVD player will get you them and will stick you right in your DVDs.
Everybody should have one.
But at any rate, what pre-1980 movie and again, one, just one, and we're not talking about, I mean, if you say Gone With The Wind, we'll come to your house and kill you.
Okay?
That's a promise.
Although, although what?
It's a good movie.
Let's put Gone With The Wind.
Well, that may be a bad example.
No, I shouldn't be picky.
Whatever you think.
Whatever you think for these young whippers, nappers, or maybe even some older people who just missed, I don't know, maybe missed out.
Missed the boat?
They missed the boat of them.
Right.
I always want to put network on there, but again, I'm swimming up the water.
You water that.
I am what?
You water put it on there.
I will put it on there.
You know, for people that have a lot of time in their hands, like today, there are some people off of work.
They got nothing to do.
Go to your nearest neighborhood, the video store, not blockbuster plays.
We hate them like poison.
Plus, you'll get a butcher version of the movie anyway.
You can go to Hollywood video.
They have them in places.
Right.
And you can also, you can just kind of preview their song because they notice you mention them a lot.
They're just right here.
Hollywood video.
Like the past right morning, like in the corner over here, but in the public shopping center.
Over here?
Over here.
Well, this isn't the Hollywood.
Oh, that's just the name of the chain.
Right.
It's the name of the chain.
It's the only chain.
And be sure to write it out.
It's the name of the chain.
See?
Or you could just go buy a DVD and any of those.
They sell them everywhere now.
Or you can go to Amazon.com.
Right.
And in a couple of days, it'll be right there in your mail.
Be right in your box.
Like that copy of what you call it, the South Park movie that I had to reorder.
Where is it?
It's in the mail.
Somebody stole my copy.
Lost it or something.
Damn it.
Well, get that before I leave before I go back.
I'm trying.
Okay, here's the appolus up now.
It's a flowing.
It's a blowing.
Who are you pulling forward today?
Is Iowa caucuses?
And it's the whole thing is a bunch of crap.
There's no question about that.
It's stupid.
By the way, Jimmy Carter says he didn't invite Governor Dean, Dr. Dean, Mr. Dean, President
Dean.
President Dean, he didn't invite him to come down or go pray with him that the Dean people
called him and said, would it be okay?
And he said, sure.
Why not?
He just wanted to make sure that people understand that because he's not endorsing anybody.
And he didn't invite him to come on down.
Although they had a very amiable chant.
And he said it was a lovely sweater.
16 votes, Dr. Dean has six Dennis Gassinits for.
He's got a Chinaman's chance.
Carry three.
None of them.
I'm for Bush two.
Edwards one.
Sharplin Gifford have the big oh so far.
Big.
Big Bill O'Reilly's radio ratings.
Nothing.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
So we were looking for the Brazilian.
That's the most important thing today.
We got a bit.
We got to build our audience.
Uno at a time.
Solamente Uno.
That's how we got.
Right?
Uno Brazilian.
We do.
I don't know.
Do you think we have any Guatemalaans?
Nicaracans?
They don't have radios.
They might be listening to a lot of them.
They probably found their pop-up toaster.
Not the guat.
Maybe in Caracas they're listening.
They got them little antennas on top of their tin huts.
The Guatemalans are the people the Mexicans make fun of.
I see.
Well that tells me everything I need to know.
WQA and hello.
Hi, I wanted to give you a pre-1980 movie.
Yes, sir.
Love and death.
Love and death?
Yeah, Woody Allen.
Oh.
Okay.
All right.
I got it down.
Thanks, Palli.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
Love and death.
What do you want to see?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Of my ways.
Do you guys understand now,
It tells me Snapchat,
I can't get it.
It tells me some Snapchat,
It tells you some Snapchat,
Lalala tussle.
but that's okay you can handle it
yeah
what
i'm typing a lot better him even
he better get away
is he can only internet connections they're working because i don't want to
rip him and get them all sensitive again
but he better get with it
just a joke here rectangle cut the better you with it
uh...
oh god one thing about sensitive people you just light you look at it on
you know
because you know that if uh... they're sensitive that that you're getting to
And that's what we want to do is get to them right?
Hey Eric, get with it, will you?
I'm infectious!
Yeah, that's why I stayed the hell away from him.
I thought he was deathly ill just the other day.
Make sure you made a fast comeback, didn't he?
Just came back in time to tell us how the Patriots are so frickin lucky.
Yeah, well, frick you too, mister, okay?
And your silly god damn hair piece.
20 B. 4 11 at 5 60 W. Q. A. M. One movie.
Pre-1980 that you think everybody should go a render buy if they haven't seen it
because it might give them something to think about, or something to laugh about,
or something to get pissed off about, right?
Right, right!
Dr. Dean is in the lead.
I think he's got a win at tonight.
You want to know why?
Why?
Because like I told you in Iowa, 17-year-olds who can vote when they're...
If they're going to be 18 by election day in November?
If they're 17 now, they can vote in the caucus.
And there are a lot of young people that he's got there
because they did the whole thing on the Internet.
It's how they built their campaign and made all that money.
And most of those people are saying like the 17-18-19-year-olds
don't have a phone under their own name,
but they have a cell phone.
Like, I guess what? The pollsters don't...
They don't call people on cell phones.
They don't even have the list of numbers.
So he's not showing up on a lot of these polls.
So I think it's going to be close.
I think it'll be interesting. I think he's going to win.
I think Carrie and...
This is just my own prognostication.
Anybody care?
No.
I'll say it anyway.
Until some time.
Carrie and the Edwards will do well.
I'll come in like second and third and then I think a give-hard's done.
And�son, unfortunately.
Bye-bye.
Wait on the list.
Don't you think his sentence will endorse Dean?
When he drops out, which will be actor tonight?
That would be nice.
That would be nice for Dr. Dean.
18-11 at 560 WQM.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I think I did it again.
I got really bombed, then married my friend.
Oh, baby, I was smashed when we wed.
So I don't know if it was consummate and I might use hair, my money,
cause I didn't sign a free now.
I told my lawyers, I got turned again.
I was half in the bed, though I was just thin.
Oh, baby, baby, ooh, I said that I do.
I had too much food.
I can't hold my liver, ooh, I got turned again.
That's how I get back.
I kissed my dad off.
Oh, baby, baby, ooh, I popped a few corks.
And married some door.
I said, and it he loves.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Got some great news for you.
I already told you I should have saved it for on a year.
The National Enquirer, then it ones out.
Britney paid husband for a hour, whatever the hell it was.
$560,000 to sign an element.
Oh!
How do you like that?
$560,000.
How do you like that?
$560,000.
$560,000.
Right.
And the really good news is, what else is the rest of the story?
The good news is, after her mom stopped them from consummating the marriage.
Oh, right.
What do you like about it?
She blocked it.
I think she put her hand out.
Yeah.
No, she put her hand right in there.
She put her hand right in there to protect her.
She put her whole fist in there.
In fact, well, that's beside the point.
What do you like about mommy Lynn?
Here's Lynn, who looks a little better than beating herself by the way.
But nevertheless, she put her foot down on it.
Yeah, she put her foot in there.
And then he tried like,
right there.
And then she put her foot in there.
She did everything she could as she was like the human blocker.
Even in the ball games yesterday, when seen nobody blocking like that.
How about those patriots, huh?
I mentioned that again, except for that once for us, you're after the game.
Well, I want to thank my lord and savior Jesus Christ.
When you stop, when you people stop already.
It's like saying Jesus was helping the patriots, but he wasn't helping the cults.
Well, Jesus took a look at Peyton Manning.
He said, fat.
Oh, my God.
You call that a human being?
He's bizarre.
But anyway, he ain't no time he's ready.
I'll turn to that with or without the beard.
Britney paid 560 grand to sign an element after mom stopped them from consummating the marriage.
Uh, where the hell's the rest of the story?
Where is it, George?
I took it.
Oh, that is the story.
In the hours after the wedding, are you crazy?
You could lose a big chunk of your fortune this guy said the insider.
I don't know where the hell the rest of this.
Oh, here it is.
I got so much inquire or crap.
It's just pollen all over itself.
It says the couple never had a chance to consummate the marriage before Jason returned home to lose Vienna.
The inquiries learned exclusively.
They looked in there.
They checked it out.
They did swabs.
The image samples.
They did.
Don't you believe me when you want to volunteer for that work?
Sure.
I'll swap it.
Uh, half a million in cash was transferred to the Louisiana bank account of Jason Alexander just hours after they were revealed on the citer.
Then just to sweeten the potty was given 60 grand in cash walking around money.
Go have a good time, boy.
I'm going to be ill.
60 grand in cash to go have a good time.
It came from the casino at the hotel where Brittany was staying at the palms in Vegas.
Brittany wrote them the check for the money.
Jason was pressured to take this deal.
I've Brittany checked out a new new jeans and makeup.
She had no dealings with the pay office is all done by her panicked handlers.
They did the damage control.
The handlers see nothing as no matter what you see.
It's not for real.
The handlers are doing it.
Just like Dr. Dean's handlers who are on the verge of screwing his ass big time.
And just like Michael's handlers who had him duken and javid up on top of the limo.
And an asshole Jeffrey Tuben on CNN.
Seriously, it's like we got a bunch of overgrown children are the people reporting news to us.
Who are just dazzled by all of this.
They're just, oh, he's the king of pop.
He's a freaking freak pedophile, you asshole.
Oh, but he's the king of pop.
And all of those frenzied fans.
Wow.
Okay, let's see what we got here on this early poll.
Okay, this is up till noon only and then we start getting serious with the other one.
Who are you pulling for today's Iowa caucus is 91.
How come we don't have I don't give a shmit.
Which that should always be on her, shouldn't it?
Aura.
Let's add that on there, Eric.
Okay, if you're listening, I couldn't give a shmit less.
Right? Sure, why not?
That's a big part of our crowd.
They're more interested in having what's your name come over.
Cheryl, they call Joe there in the last call.
Sometimes she gets on top.
That's what I heard.
Dean 39, he's on top right now out of 101, 39 for Dr. Dean.
John Kerry 16, I still say look scary.
John Edwards 14, he's a good old boy.
None of that mom for Bush 12, 11.8%.
Dennis, consent, it's 10, poor little Dennis.
Al Sharpton 8 and give hard to.
We don't have the, we'll get the other one on there.
Like I don't give a shmit at all.
And you'd be surprised how many couldn't care less.
They got bigger fish to fry mister.
They can't be worried about some stupid eyed face.
I would do caucus.
Freaking Jason, what's his name?
Jason Alexander.
What a, what a retard.
What a goofball.
Goober.
You did, you didn't see the tape where he was speaking.
Oh yeah.
Oh man, he's real or something.
See, there goes my sudden prejudice again, you know.
I can't handle it.
Although I sure like southerners is opposed to people
that won't put us down in their diaries.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 because we know speak it or write language.
Come on, all you Brazilians out there, let's get with it.
And let's, Kubano's Negoraz.
Negos.
I'm going to get horny.
Kubano's Negos.
Negos.
Negos.
Negoraz.
Latin Lades.
Oh, then.
There's one.
How many we got?
30, man.
There's one.
Yeah, no.
Close.
That's a guy.
See, they're crying.
I don't care how many people at this is up.
I was thinking about that frickin' McGell in his professional human family.
Boy, what a bunch of losers they must be, you know what?
Oh, they were really pissed off at you for ragging on senior crews.
You know, when you people grow up, not any wonder how he came and became such a jerk like that in terms of that ethnocentricity that's all he know from.
It's all from the upbringing, man.
That's all they know.
And I guarantee I'd bet you your life on it that if Castro croaked tomorrow.
And all of a sudden they said, guess what?
Surprise. We're bringing back the mob and are going to build the casinos, the hotels here.
We'll be the best in the Western hemisphere.
And we're going to have democracy for everybody so to speak and fix the elections just like in Florida.
Uh, McGell's family would, they wouldn't be a go-and-goer.
Of course not.
I need to, he.
Property.
Right. He ain't going nowhere.
No.
And neither would most of you other people that talk a big game and keep beating us over the head with it like some kind of a punching bag.
Do hell with Fidale.
Fidale.
Give it up already.
Will you get a life?
And quit sucking up to assholes like Iliana Grosana Dana.
And you want to know another real asshole?
Not an asshole. Just a, a nebish.
Jose Diaz-Balart.
Well, yeah.
You remember when he went to CBS for that morning show and I said, I guarantee he won't be there for six months.
No, I don't remember.
Never saw it.
It happened like it was there for like, uh, if you, if you're blank, you missed it.
I blanked.
It was even worse than the Ricky Tiki Sanchez show.
Oh, no.
And why?
I can't say that.
All the, how many Diaz-Balarts are there?
About third, man.
And he was doing something political and he was doing this.
And all of a sudden he's a hack on a local channel again on the news.
It's tragic to me.
Why can't we have some people with some talent?
They had Steve Wolfard there on channel four.
He was pretty good. He's gone.
Yeah.
Because his last name wasn't Rodriguez.
That's right.
Somebody can go.
Who I am, hello.
Yeah, I went talk to Neil.
When is Diaz and he go?
Come us down.
Well, duh.
Yes.
I want to pick a movie from pre 1980.
Go ahead.
Song of the South.
Where are they going to find that?
I don't know.
By the way, I Steve.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm out of material.
Yeah.
You're out of material, all right.
56670560.
What do you or give me a look like?
When you just calm down, I can't stand it.
I'm rolling my eyes.
I don't want to see you roll your eyes.
I don't want to see you rolling your eyes and letting these people.
Who cares?
You're not going to get paid any more or less if he was a good collar or some kind of an asshole.
In fact, it's better if he's an asshole.
The audience likes hearing assholes.
That's why they listen to us.
56670560.
That's why they listen to me once in a while.
Real quick.
You know what I mean?
Absolutely.
WQA, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I got the Justin for the movie.
Go right ahead.
Black Orpheus.
Black Orpheus.
I know it's oldy and rather obscure one, but it's a...
Who is an ad?
Oh, boy.
It's a certain Brazil.
It's a bunch of nobody's.
Oh, but if who is in Brazil, that's good.
Let's get it on there.
It's in Portugay.
Portugay, say?
But the music is by Joe Beam, who wrote Girl from E.P. Nemo.
Right.
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.
Yes, that's the music.
It's that very, that, that, that, that, that, that.
I'm rolling Brazil.
It's just Walt Walt entertainment.
Mochis Grasius, Amigo.
They're not about...
I'm not about to ask the KVL, you're meadest.
It's here.
The, um...
They do you, don't we?
They tumble in.
Okay, get out of here.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
Two mama.
E2 mama.
La Penga.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
5, 5, 60, Audi A, T, D, and Verizon Wireless Line.
Yeah, we're doing the show 50, 50 now.
50% in English, 50% in Spanish, and maybe 10% on top of that in Portugay.
Once, once we learn it.
Huh?
This isn't a melting pot.
This is a turlip.
This is just...
See, Toronto, we got all these Chinese people.
I totally disamaged in times, but it's just amazing to me.
We got all these Pakis and Indians, and some of them don't smell all that good.
And, uh, and, uh, from people from everywhere, Ziggins of them.
But everybody speaks English.
There's no language problem.
There's no language barrier.
Even the frogs, uh, speak it a little in English.
Yeah, there.
Yeah.
Oh, Montreal, that they have a problem.
Let me tell you about Montreal for the hundredth time.
Oh, and this year, it's so...
It's, uh, got so much potential.
It just, just exactly likes how I thought it would, uh, bad weather.
Montreal.
Just needs a people transplant.
It's a really neat city.
Great restaurants.
Great restaurants.
Great restaurants.
60 pound, five, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Who you're pulling for in Iowa caucuses today, baby?
We've been indedated with crap from the idiots, oh, this is something important.
Iowa and New Hampshire.
Anybody give a flying fuk about either one of them?
No.
The systems, I'm telling you, national primary, right it down.
I've been saying that for a hundred years, a national primary.
It evens the playing field, right?
You don't have to have a billion dollars.
You don't have to keep surviving and raising money to try to compete.
You don't have to be a rich bastard.
Everybody can compete on the same day.
You have a certain period of, uh, you know, ahead of time, a couple of months, three months, whatever, for campaigning, for, uh, speeches, for debates.
And then on the same day, the whole country votes in a national primary and a party's picked their candidates.
That's why it'll never happen.
Because it makes too much goddamn sense.
Doesn't favor the rich.
Who you're pulling that for in today's Iowa caucus, 136 votes, Dr. Dean 54.
Scary John Kerry 19.
John Edwards 18.
Good old boy.
None of them on for boy 16.
11.7%.
Huh?
Uh, Kusenets 10, Sharpton 10.
I couldn't give a Schmidt last six.
An old Gebhart 3.
Only three people like Dick.
My life and local.
This is 4205-60.
You're a huge way.
You are.
Oh, I am.
I'm low-green.
I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
I'm a mad at hell.
I'm not gonna take that anymore.
Oh!
Spider-hole, spider-hole.
Cuts it down in a spider-hole.
And he looks really weird with long hair and a beard he was.
Hiding just like a mole.
Take a sniff, smell the stench.
You might almost think he's French.
His facial hair is not so nice.
Check it carefully for lice.
Hey, you!
There goes the grapes to down.
Yeah, the doctor said.
It's a dumb, open wide.
But he couldn't find any weapons inside.
Spider-hole, spider-hole.
That is where we found this troll.
Raised his hands and wet himself.
Very soon he will rot in hell and glass.
President Bush is so glad.
Because we found this dumb bag.
Down in a spider-hole.
Oh!
1103 at 560 WQM.
So anyway, this morning I told George that most said the reason that the show's ratings went down meaning this one is because of George.
Right, because you have small teeth.
And you got all bent out of shape about that.
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
See you, Jay.
Step down.
You're thinking of starting parts.
Santino.
Because you got small teeth.
I didn't know that he noticed.
I never even, all the years that we worked together, I never looked at your teeth once.
Never noticed your teeth.
Never saw your teeth.
So he must be looking at you like real carefully, like sizing you up upside down and side out.
Must be up in my mouth.
He must be looking in your mouth.
Or maybe scouting it out.
Maybe like to put something in there.
I do have gaps between my teeth.
And they're crooked.
Oh look at this.
Rod Lauren.
You remember him?
I don't need them.
I just saw this in the inquire that I was going to schmit camp.
But this is pretty interesting if you know who that was, which I don't.
Rod Lauren had a hit single in 1959.
If I had a girl and started the cult classic, the crawling hand.
There's a movie that we put on our list.
The crawling hand.
I must have missed that one.
I remember the hand with my clean hand.
And the hand with Michael Kane when I kept getting out of the trunk.
Remember that?
Right.
Now what happened?
Did he lose the hand and the, close it on the trunk or on a car?
I forgot.
I love Michael Kane.
He's great.
60's teen idol Rod Lauren is wanted for the brutal murder of his lovely wife.
A Philippine movie star found stabbed at it in the backseat of her car.
See?
It must have been the crawling hand on it.
The shocking crime has become known as the OJ Simpson case of the Philippines.
But despite the best efforts of the Philippine justice department,
Lauren is living as a free man in California.
The 63 year old entertainer who lived with wife Nida Blanca for 22 years in her native country.
Return of the US after brutal death in 2001 and commit accusations by the Philippine government that he arranged her murder.
He scored a hit single with a five-headed girl in 59.
He started in a string of low-budget movies including 63's called sci-fi classic, The Crawling Hand.
And, guess that on numerous TV shows including Alfred and his car presents.
And Gomer Pyle, USMC.
How do you like that?
And my other thing is he used to look pretty good a long, long time ago.
He got a nice picture.
He used to look real good about a hundred years ago.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
We've also had to go on with a win.
Godfather, network of clockwork, we're going to the exercises.
Do you think he has got those yet?
Did you fact some?
Not yet.
Well, we're working.
There's no pressure.
It's a holiday.
Give him a little slack, okay?
Because he's, I don't know.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, Mr. Quinil, please.
Speaking.
Hi, Neil.
This is Maria.
And I'm Brazilian and I'm a woman.
Maria Brazilian, oh my God.
Oh, you made my whole year.
And I live for you every day.
Thank you.
Do you know any other Brazilians who listen to this show?
No.
So you got to go out there and do some campaigning for it.
I could lay my one Brazilian phrase on her.
Yeah, what's that?
Il Chiamo.
Oh, I love you too.
Great.
That's the name of the show.
But why don't you like Brazilians then?
I didn't say that.
I love Brazilians.
I've been talking about them.
I just said they're mostly drag queens, but other than that.
You know, that's true.
Played a good one.
That's only in Rio.
Yeah, I guess.
I'm for some Paul also.
Oh, San Paul.
I almost went there once a long time ago, but I decided I'd rather go someplace I might come back home alive from.
Good idea.
Yeah, exactly.
Good choice.
Well, listen, Maria, thanks a lot.
I asked to came along.
Meal Vitas.
Okay, ciao.
Ciao.
How do you like that?
Very nice.
Not only a Brazilian listener, but a Brazilian lady.
Woo, we don't have that.
Oh, speaking of ladies, yes.
I've never met a Brazilian I didn't like.
That's right, because all the only one we know is Maria.
Oh, I met one before.
Did you?
Sure.
Was it hot?
Was she?
Yeah, she put out.
She's somebody.
No, not for me anyway.
Oh, what am I looking for?
I'm looking for ladies.
No, not those kind.
No, no, seriously, I'm looking to see what we did.
When you shot up a minute, I'm looking to see what we did in women and our other.
Look at that.
Woo, man, that's bad.
Persons 2554.
Man, man, man, man, man, we had a point for it in women.
I just figured it out in my nimble head.
We had a 0.4 in women.
Wow.
So all these women are called, oh, you have lots of women listed as well.
Guess what?
Somebody better explain that I've had a fill out their arbitraried diaries because they
sure don't let them know when they're listening.
You know what I mean?
You're thinking of sparing person.
Yes, I am, as a matter of fact.
5.670560, 0.560 on the AT&T in Verizon, wireless line.
What pre-1980 movie do you think is a must-see for people to rent or buy?
Especially if you think they probably ain't seen it.
W.Q.A.M. Hello.
Hello.
I'm also Brazilian listener.
Oh, my God.
Holy, come on.
See?
Maria wasn't the only one.
How long have you been listening?
Since, let's see, 98.
I moved to the country 97.
So since 98.
Now, you and Maria need to do a big campaign in a little brazil over that isn't good.
All right.
We will.
My big wringo husband introduced me to you guys and I expect to you ever since.
Excellent.
Thanks a lot, Maria.
What's your name?
Daniella.
Daniella.
Yes.
I love Daniella.
Thanks a lot, Daniella.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
We got Daniella and Maria.
Excellent.
Excellent, baby.
Let's start a collection.
Well, no, see, this is the only way we're going to grow is because the anglos aren't reproducing at all.
And of course, you know, you would Catholics.
You keep reproducing like rabbits because the Pope makes them very happy.
And it makes the priest happy too because that means lots more altar boys waiting.
So, chain five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T.
Oh, guess it was on Kim Novak last night with Larry.
You know what I'm talking about?
Don't be trusted.
I'm pouring.
Kim Novak.
Didn't you love Kim Novak?
Oh, there's a good movie for you.
But it's a picnic.
Should we put picnic on there?
You bring the ants.
Why not?
I'll bring the air canoli with William Holden and Kim Novak.
That's fantastic.
Fabulous.
How about on the waterfront?
All right.
Did you see that?
Of course.
Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint and Leejay Cobb on the waterfront.
Although, you know, it can be a movie that's fairly obscure.
It doesn't have to be one that like everybody knows.
But one that you really enjoyed and you think that everybody else might enjoy.
And if we're going to talk about old Marlon Brando movie.
Streetcar.
Named.
Desire.
Huh.
Okay.
Like the better than on the waterfront.
No.
You didn't?
No.
Streetcar name desire.
I'm a waterfront was just a fabulous streetcar name desire.
Whatever.
Let me give you a different one.
Whether I liked it or even if you liked it, Mr. I know that comes to shock to you.
Because you're kind of one of the imperial Spicks.
Who you're pulling for today's Iowa but not nearly as imperialism my good friend Mo.
Absolutely.
Wow.
Seriously, he talks.
He does the same thing pretty much off the earth as he does on here.
You know, he's just not one of those people.
I mean, I am my friend Bill Carter used to call me Mr. Warmth, you know.
Because I'm about as warm as a block of ice.
But I'm like, I'm as hot as that thing you scalded your hand on the microwave that it compared to Mo.
Chacon suit.
I am.
I'm like a warm fuzzy cutlet bear compared to the Mo man.
It's true.
Who you're pulling for today's Iowa caucuses?
Oh, Dr. Dean, man.
Out of 1809, he's got 72.
He's pulling away.
Dr. Dean.
He the man.
Lose the sweaters, Dr. Dean.
John Kerry 27.
None of them.
I'm for Bush 22 11.6%.
Why don't you how come that's down so much, George?
Don't know.
Don't you think that's good?
Well, yes.
Good if it meant anything.
I couldn't give a Schmidt less 22.
Edwards 21.
Sharp didn't 11.
That's an honor of the holiday today, I guess.
A dentist's a Senate 11 and Dick Ebbhart still only three people into Dick on the show.
He's done.
Stick a fork in him.
He'd be done.
So congratulations to Ricky Tickie Shaw on the entire cast of the Elvator Magic 102.7 for all the wire diaries.
I mean, for the great book.
Hey, listen, every dog gets his day.
We like Rick a lot, even though he's ballooning up like a bullfrog.
11 past 11 at 560 WQM.
We got the mad dog at two.
Oh, right.
We got no Humper because we got the Hocking in Curtis Stevenson as a half-hour today.
Four to four 30.
I think he can handle that.
Four 30 to five.
The Panther preview.
We got the Panthers hosting the St. Louis Blues.
St. Louis at the Macaroon at five o'clock.
Be there or be square at the game.
Very big game because the Atlanta won again yesterday for a change.
Orlando Elzigiri at the Senior Bowl.
How do you like that?
The big H to 10 tonight.
He paid his own way.
He wants you to know it.
The big NHK 10 and Joe and Mark overnight two to five at the AM.
As we're starting to like come back to normal a little bit.
Dolphin season's over.
Right?
It is.
Only got one football game left.
That's in two weeks.
The big one.
Patriots kick ass over Carolina.
Nothing could be fight other than to beat up on Carolina.
And then it's a long loss.
So we better do it while we can.

He was the white star line of the porno industry.

And when it comes, you will too.
Kate Winslet is the deflowered Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio is John Holmes in gigantic, now showing.
Love at 17, ever seemed to get the Leo into John Holmes?
No.
Same guy.
17 past the hour at 5.60 W.A.M.
So anyway, we're going to start doing a lot more esponial.
No.
Cue up a different tune already.
Oh, yeah, we got the whole album in.
The best of.
Well, that's my favorite though.
No.
Oh, yeah, this is my favorite.
I'm going to play the game right.
Hey, see, you put a bag on it.
Okay, honey.
5.60, 7.05.60.
I'm 5.60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Thank God we don't have like a one dimensional community here, you know.
See, they know how to play the game though.
And you want to know what the proof of that is.
Wait till you hear this.
This is a little boring to some people.
But who cares?
Length, the listenership.
If I were to say to you, hear it now, and that's not it.
Yeah, WACC AM.
Now, do you remember when we went over to Paxton?
Yeah.
And we got the tour and they showed us that room where they had a couple of Spanish language stations.
They were like in a broom closet, remember?
I think I'm pretty sure one of them was WACC AM.
No spaghetti.
Okay.
It's number 31 out of 32 stations that are listed in the ratings.
I'm sorry, out of 33.
At any rate, the length of listenership, though, in the summer book, it was number one, NUMBER 1.
And they had 12 and a half hours of week length, length, listenership, which means that it was like one diary,
but it was somebody who allegedly listened all week long, you know.
Around the clock, nonstop, and so they had like a number one.
They have a crystal set.
Yeah, that's right.
It's just stuck there on whatever that is on the dial, which nobody knows where to find it.
What pre-1980 movie do you think is a must see for people to read or buy?
Love and death, Cooquus Nest, Black Orpheus, Galmita Wind, Godfather, Network, or Clockwork Orange, the Exorcist must see.
If you have any Catholics out there when you see the Exorcist, you'll say, bye-bye.
That's it.
No more money from me.
Picnic, on a waterfront or a streetcar named Desire.
WQAM.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How about Rocky Horror?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Okay, get some tomatoes.
Rocky Horror pictures, you're, okay.
Are they still playing it?
Occasionally, just not regularly.
In places, it's always going on.
Let me ask you this, when people get the DVD, and they watch it at home today through tomatoes of their TV?
Toast.
Rice.
Toastitos?
5, 6, 7, 8, oh, and speaking of Toastitos yesterday during the ball games, which again, you don't watch.
Uh, although there must have been local ads, TGI Fridays, which I know is an national chain, but they were local ads.
They've got an Atkins menu at TGI Friday.
And of course, Subway and low-carb beer and low-carb Doritos and Toastitos and, uh, Chiquita Banana.
It's unbelievable.
The same people who for years and years have been fighting and resisting, oh no, low-carb is bogus.
And Dr. Mackins is a shyster and a, you know, snake roll salesman.
Now all of a sudden, everything is low-carb.
You don't think that they're exploiting us, do you?
No.
They wouldn't do that, would they?
They were exploiting us because we're fat and we're desperate.
Grave robbery, just unbelievable.
I wouldn't go to Subway if it was for free.
No.
I don't care if it has minus carbs.
Now maybe their stuff is good, I don't know.
You think?
No.
Well, I don't have to think.
And when are we going to get low-carb Taco Bell?
That's what I would like to know.
See, I don't care about low-carb.
Are we greeting the guys right there?
I don't care about that.
Like a taco salad without the shell.
Right.
Why can't they just give you a spoon?
Right.
Because they think that they have sports there.
They have what?
Sports.
A sport.
You didn't get a sport in school.
I guess those are relatively new.
Oh, sport.
Sport.
When you speak a little more clearly, it's more.
You see, you're forgetting exactly where you are.
I thought you said sports.
That's my little teeth.
Yeah.
That's right.
If you speak more clearly.
And I would have little tiny, teeny tiny teeth,
which is why our ratings went down.
I'll try to speak more clearly.
By the way, George has got horsey teeth today.
So everybody markers down.
WQA and hello.
Hey, Neil.
How are you doing?
Pretty good, sir.
All right.
You know that in Burger King now, you can go and ask for a walker
with no bread.
That's like a high-concind to give it to you in a little container.
Right.
But what they don't know is Wendy's has been doing that for years.
Oh, yeah.
Pretty cool.
Another thing in memory of Martin Luther King,
they got to see shaft.
Okay.
And I see the connection.
Yes.
And in closing.
Freya, last.
Freya, last.
Thank you, God.
We're free at last.
All right.
Excellent.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Now, wait a minute.
See that crew is just a minute.
It's just gone.
I mean, I'm a little bit slow as you've noticed.
But when she sings that thing.
It's an egrita que va caminando.
It's an egrita que en eso tu pal.
Y cuando la gente la va mirando, ya va y la bela.
Y cuando la gente la va mirando, ya va y la bela.
Oh, I can't take it.
It's a moment she says La Negra, what?
Which time?
La Negra, something.
It's an egrita que va caminando.
Oh, don't say it so fast.
All right.
All right.
Oh, that I get chills.
Look at that.
It's a little black chick that goes walking by.
Yeah.
That's the one that CD's got his eyes on.
It's a horizon.
Boy.
So that goes to Shoei and honor of Martin Luther King Day
today.
We're playing lots of CDA crews, man.
Cue up number three there.
What is it?
I'm right.
I'm a cue box.
I'm sorry.
Cool.
Welcome to La Cueba de Suma, ladies and gentlemen.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy.
Let me introduce you to those don't the Brazilians
and Cubans hate each other.
Of course.
Why?
They don't even speak the same language.
Oh, even more reason.
Uh-oh.
W-A-Q-A-M.
I got a movie for you.
Yes, sir.
It was filmed by Stanley Kubrick.
It was called Dr. Strangelove.
Dr. Strangelove.
One of the best filmers.
Peter Sellers.
Right.
How I learned to love it in the bomb, too.
Yep.
Thank you.
Dr. Strangelove's great.
See, now, you know, we've done a lot of movie things in a past,
but this is a service for the audience because a lot of you are bored to death.
And after being here a few days, I can easily understand why.
Uh-uh.
So go out to your nearest Hollywood video.
There must be some other ones.
Well, there are stores now.
Besides ordering online, which, of course, you'll get a couple of things.
You know, you can go to Best Buy.
It has really good prices.
Right.
Maybe these in a nice place.
And when you go to Best Buy, you might actually get weighted on, but I'd like it.
No, no, it's self-service there.
I'm starting to get hostile about them.
No, you know what?
You know why they have such cheap, good prices at Best Buy?
Because they're here.
No, but that's not true, which is why they're punks.
Oh, I see.
You're not going to say they don't have any help.
They've got-
If anything, they have a problem.
They have too much help, but they're just not doing anything.
Right.
They've got 80,000 punks running around the whole little queue up.
They're good for food.
They know nothing.
Oh, and speaking of outfits on, guess who I was accosted by at a street corner in plantation?
Homeless voice.
Yes.
And now the new deal is what's-
They have like a light-pused lime line.
What am I gonna do?
Yeah, get around there.
They're changing cars with it.
They have new t-shirts now to try to like throw you off a little bit.
And one guy, he must have known who I was.
Because I'm sitting there on hiatus waiting to make a left turn under 595.
Let's go to the track over the weekend.
And I'm sitting there and he comes and he holds up the-
And I just sat there looking ahead like-
No, they're the rest of the one.
No, no, no, but he-
But then he looked at me and he like-
He held it right in front of the windshield and he kept looking at me and-
And kept waving it.
And I didn't do anything.
I didn't even give him one of these, but-
I do.
What an asshole.
They're doing that now.
They're extra aggressive.
Really are they?
I shout at them.
Maybe I'll like hit the gas real quick when he steps in front of my-
Get in the full car.
Get in the asshole.
Yeah.
Get out of my way, you asshole.
I think you people down here gotta have a campaign and get the homeless voice people off the street.
Off the land.
This scam has gotta stop soon.
Okay?
So that that schmuck in the living is expensive home.
You know, everybody's gotta contribute to the homeless voice.
What a joke.
Sean Konani.
Sean Konani, man.
We can't stand you.
We're on to you.
We can't stand you.
It's a frickin cult is what it is.
Not even-
It's just a money grab and cult.
Organized beggar.
Right.
And all you-
And I'm not seeing too many people who don't look like they can go out and do a real job.
If they can walk, they can work.
And how president they want to bring in all these illegal aliens and make them like,
poof, you're legal now all of a sudden, huh?
Let these assholes go out there and do it, O's John.
Just let them hold on their grapes.
Oh yeah.
They're not too crazy about that, especially that republicans who would be so happy about it either.
How president they-
Speaking of how president they, who you're pulling for, huh?
Who you're pulling for?
Iowa's caucus tonight.

Park Spock and I mention Wally Hennessey is the Antichrist.

He's the Antichrist.

I am so surprised.
They call Jesse Jackson.
Get down and deal.
Do yo like you shit up on the charts?
That's a girl who has your eye.
A baby in trauma, mom.
Don't like these things.
Just doing like going out of his own neighborhood and just doing it like Nike.
You cheated.
You counsel the American friends in a white house that find out.
You got a something going with the lights out and now he's got a new child.
It's a baby.
At a woodlock.
Rub a pot.
You'll be.
Flopped up with a headlock.
He loves to wipe and everything, but she had to one move lay down.
He wanna rip up 38 years of marriage to Jack of Lem round.
I remember when he brought us all together when we were divided.
That this guy had books out known as the Great Unify Us.
We've decided.
We thought utmost respect.
It is all through.
All you did is hurt that lady.
And you called me.
Yeah.
And I'm sorry, I'm just Jackson.
Who is this old real?
And we told you no reason but I see a guy that just a trillion times.
They called us Jackson.
Get down and nail.
Never meant to make a dog a hot dog.
I hope this makes you sick to say goodbye.
You had it out.
While it went through your room.
You will be in a home.
By time you will grow.
You will be in a real estate.
With your deep rack strong.
You will spend your hand.
But you'll never put a new hand in your hands.
Ten times out of nine.
You got the time to find.
The quickest time to throw it on yourself and you'll be fine.
Assisting Martin Luther King.
He had a dream not about a crib at almost 16.
And for all day he's always been committed to labor.
To labor, to labor, labor, to labor, labor.
We thought Langwell was work, a job, what we was wrong.
And notice that you're meaning of push.
Public John, Mr. Jackson, his intention's so good.
He wish he could become a magician to Africa's ever being a dad.
Thoughts of he, thoughts of she, thought Jesse.
Was a minister but now he's an elderly dad.
He's great so much about it.
That's what he said.
It happened more reason he should be.
Mads, the news released at this time is true.
So he would not be present for the George W. E. Noggeration.
I'm sorry, Mr. Jackson.
It's difficult real.
Never meant to make a doubt that I can't believe it.
I'm so surprised.
It's not easy, Jackson.
Get down and kneel.
Took your wife, you should apologize.
That's a little girl who had your heart.
27 till noon at 5.60 W. E. Noggeration.
I'll tell you one thing.
Black people in this country have made almost no progress.
Do you know what I mean?
No, what do you mean?
Like in the last 20 years.
Very little.
You see a lot of changes?
Just because they can bring out of the same water fountain now
and go to the same toilet?
It's its tragic.
And proof of that is today is supposed to be a holiday.
But it's not.
Do you know what I mean?
No.
Yes you do.
Do you consider today a holiday?
No.
Well, they do to why?
But like all those presidents birthday parties.
No, no, no.
They're the same crap.
What are you talking about?
It's the same crap.
No, what they're...
Well, what the presidents day is a holiday?
They just incorporated the two.
They took Washington and Lincoln and stuck them together.
Yeah.
I don't think a lot of people like all those holidays
with the exception of like Christmas and whatever their favorite holiday is.
It's a July.
That all these other holidays is like if you get a day off great,
if you don't.
What about Sukus, man?
What about Tishabov?
What about Phorum?
Oh, wow.
That's different.
And maybe if the black people are a little bit more creative.
Maybe if we had like some special food we could eat today on Martin Luther King Day?
I mean, on Phorum, eat home and Tosham, right?
Okay.
The Jews have got day.
They know the food crab, man.
Which is why West Clark is doing so good.
He's coming to all the delis.
Oh, speaking of that, Clark wins endorsement from George McGovern.
Now, I know that I'm probably the only one.
I love George McGovern.
You know, I had him on my show many, many times on the phone.
You know, I had him on my show many, many times on the phone.
He was a guest.
Tony that.
He was a good guy.
He was great.
He just was a little bit too.
I don't know, why any?
I don't know what to do with.
No, he just, I don't know.
What his problem was.
He just was the wrong guy at the wrong time.
He endorsed Westley Clark.
Yesterday.
Anybody here?
No.
And we didn't put Westley Clark on a pool because he's laying out.
He is not participating in Iowa.
I think what he's waiting for is to see them all better each other up pretty good and bloodied.
Get bloodied in Iowa.
Bloodied down.
And then Hampshire coming to real good second of Dean.
And then from there, once they go on down south, he can kick some serious ass.
Till they find out his father was Jewish.
The Danish Army says Iraqi shells are WMD free.
God damn.
Every time we think we got another bogus, I mean another thing to confuse the American public with,
it just don't pan out.
Like pan in for gold, you know, and coming up by empty.
Mortar shells found in Iraq and believed to be suspicious and fat contained no chemical agents
that Danish Army said after a week of tests.
The 36 shells found 12 miles north of the city of Kurnah in southern Iraq January 9
had initially been taught by Danish and British troops to contain a blister agent
like the one that you got blistered with on the in the microwave this morning.
Chicken soup.
They had chicken soup in them.
Blistering chicken soup in there.
But further tests carried out in southern Iraq and the US were negative,
Negatory.
How do you like that?
36 shells.
Yeah.
That many.
36.
Rushed it out, ratted it out old shells with a little bit of slime in them.
And it turned out to be squad.
How do you like that?
He was a threat.
I just, I'll tell you again.
You can pedal anything to American public and they'll just gobble it up.
Deans got a hundred.
Look at this.
Well, I keep this up till noon.
Who are you pulling for today's Iowa caucuses?
282.
Dean 100.
Couldn't give a Schmidt less 42.
Scary John Kerry 40.
None of them on for worse 37 13.1%.
Edwards 30.
How many he's he got?
About 30, man.
Who said it's 15?
Al Sharpton 13.
And poor Dick F. Hart is sucking wind.
He's sucking high and end there with only five.
And we don't care if the AFL CIO, if the team's here,
we don't give a flying crap.
Who the hell likes him?
But he's going to be out after the day.
Who do you think he's going to endorse?
Good question, huh?
That is a good question.
Yeah.
Who's old Dick going to endorse?
Because the other union guy is a dean.
Right?
See?
Well, think about it.
Nobody can cue him.
Hello.
Hi, is this Neil?
Yes, sir, speaking.
I've got one or two for your poll.
One would be good.
One.
How about a thousand clowns with Jason Robards?
Jason Robards, one of the all-time great actors.
Okay.
How was some clowns?
There's a great movie.
Got it, Don.
Thank you, Paley.
How do you?
How do you?
You ever see that?
No.
Me either.
Well, let's get it.
I never heard of it.
Well, you don't even like, uh, what?
I like Jason Robards?
I like it.
Because Jason Robards was in it.
And his part was great.
He was his storyline in the Tom Proof.
That's because I mean, that's one of the gotta be one of the most bizarre things in the movie history.
He was almost died just the way they showed in a movie, and then he did die.
Desperate.
Of course he had a little bit of a really least raspberry green the godfather. Yeah, at least raspberry
But that was that was God's way of punishing him for that performance. That's why the performance was that way
He was dying was he really that
That was for real
Seriously seriously I didn't know that till a small but I didn't know that I
Thought it was Barzini are wasting. We think we're way
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound a house sad and what oh, and you know who's really I saw a clip from a movie and you'll know what the name of the movie is
with Al Pacino and
Cano Reeves
Al Pacino bothers me. You want it a why why because when he's good he's great and when he's bad
He's just awful. No argument there. No, I'm serious. I don't know what the movie was. I was just channel
Sir, you know in the devil's advocate maybe I don't know and he was going through that same
Speech with a scene he was portraying the same character there that it was portraying in
sent of a woman and
Parts of Godfather 3
You know what I mean that same kind of I don't know. It's just when he's bad. He's just so awful
I think when you get so big you get the idea that no matter what you do, it's gonna be good
Is that it and you just I'll just do whatever the hell I want. That's what Ron Jeremy said
We're not talking about his penis. We're talking about his poopic
How do you like that call last week from his a PR guy that tries to like me to promote that awful show that he was a the notion
We don't like Ron Jeremy on the show. Okay. We don't like big fat Tubby hairy appornal guys. All right
That's just nauseating bragging about
His getting his sloppy second bragging about his lack of talent. We already know that on the show case
Don't always your time and we're not gonna promote his stupid as TV show. What's it called?
5 6 7 0 5 5 60

He said right there. You're good buddy Al brought him in that day. I'll goldstein and sat him down there
I don't want any part of him and he sat him down and like hey, I'm here
And the fact that some of the people in the building where everybody in the building was so whipped up and decided it would forget about Michael Jackson
You would have thought that it was the second coming scored scored, huh?
Which in his case who I wanted to see the first one?
Man grew some grew some
Yes, he did
Yeah, like Josh Freeman. Hey any of the Josh Freeman fans out there in radio who've been following the QM Saginaw for years
He ballooned up again. That's what Robert Grieper reported blue blue
Some in the Tampa Bay hockey game on Saturday. He said the bad news is that he's fatter than ever in spite of that stomach stapling
That's bad news and even worse news is he still smells the same or worse
Twenty before noon at 560 WQM. How about those patriots? I know lucky. Uh-huh lucky

Oh no, talk about yak and look at that, George has peaked up a bunch of dyed Pepsi because it's all from before Jesus was a baby.
Don't be going to that Walgreens no more, at least don't be buying no dyed Pepsi there.
That was the new stuff, was that the old stuff? No, the old batch.
Oh, the old batch, I just wanted to make sure George just hooked up an old batch, he said it tasted good.
And he spat it right out. I just got it up to 560, pound 560 on a AT&T of rise and wireless.
See if ponytail was really our buddy instead of just coming in here sucking around the other day, he would have brought us all bunch of snappled today.
Knowing that it's a holiday, right?
I don't get the idea they're open today, diet of course.
And yesterday they show in the middle of all the Iowa crap and they should might pull they asked Americans what their voters supposedly, what they're most concerned about the issues, whether it's a racket, the economy was 55% far ahead of anything else.
Guess what only had 2%. Let me give you a clue.
Education. Yeah, you know how they're always saying, oh that's a very important issue. No, it's not.
No, it's not. Nobody cares about that.
I mean when you consider the fact that half of the country is functionally illiterate anyway, why don't they care about education? Why would they want their kids to be smarter than they are?
Which in most cases they probably are anyway.
56670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. What pre-1980 movie is a must-see? Do you think is people ought to be written or buy in it?

Okay.
I got you down, pal.
I have a great day.
You too, pal.
Thank you.
For just a second there, I thought he was going to say,
Hi, a pally.
But he didn't.
Maybe we'll get you the whole day without Dave Friedman.
Well, what was it, the in-laws?
Yes.
Okay, the in-laws by Fat Rich.
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.
And we'll write it in the slide.
I'll tell you later.
Okay.
WQAM.
Hello.
Kind of nervous, but never.
Never mind.
Never mind.
Yes.
First, I don't give a shmit about Iowa.
Right.
And pre-19AD saved the out of towners.
The out of towners.
With Jack Lemmon.
And what was her name, Sally Telemann?
Yes.
She was great.
She was great.
And Jack Lemmon was great.
Okay, I got you down.
Thank you very much.
The out of towners.
You know another Jack Lemmon movie?
Do I?
Yeah, I know lots.
No, no, but the one that I'm going to put down.
What's the one about the priest that I can never think of the name of it?
You know what I'm talking about?
Yes.
Pre-1980?
Oh, it's guy.
You kidding me?
Sure it is.
Is it it?
Do you mean I'm going to have to get my book out and have to start looking at these out?
I am D.B.
No, we don't have to do that.
I got my big trusty book and I don't even have the one that weighs 800 pounds here that's up north.
Uh, Jack Lemmon.
It's not in the name of the father, isn't it?
No.
Uh, oh, I almost had it.
Uh, it's two words.
Who's with a B?
Oh, it's two words.
I know what you're talking about.
Oh, I got it too.
I got it right on the tip of my ass, man.
It's coming right out of my left to cheek.
Mass appeal.
Oh, man, am I good or what?
Wow.
Woo!
Mass appeal.
I think what they'll do eventually is they'll like program all of us.
I think Bush gets another four years.
All of our minds will be like with computer chips.
I'm waiting.
What's the good part of that is we'll be able to like, for something like that.
You just like type it up on a computer.
And immediately the answer will come up right out of your head.
Well, the key board will be your own.
The only problem is that they'll always know what you're thinking.
Mass appeal.
There's mass appeal 1984 doesn't qualify.
You were right.
An idealistic young seminarian is assigned to a veteran priest lemon skilled in the art of
clerical politics and pundit popularity.
Excellent blend of comedy and tragedy.
Convincing performances marked this Broadway adaptation.
With Jack lemon, Zeltto, even a couple of the young priest, Charles Durning and Louise Latham.
Charles Durning is so fat and so great.
You know, he's a good guy.
He's great.
When a stranger calls Charles Durning.
Does that pre-1980?
Well, I'm not going to put that on there.
It's not a must see.
Have you checked the children?
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 8th.
Well, maybe some people want to see a horror movie, huh?
Right.
You got accesses down there.
Right.
What years ad from when a stranger calls?
That's going to be a 70 something.
Is it?
Well, let's say see, I didn't want to have to do this because it kills so much good time.
When peace fly, when in Rome do the Romans, I've always said that.
And a pope don't like it.
When wheels, the lovable beetle, when comedy was young, when a stranger calls 79, just gets in there.
Oh, that's cool.
So let's put it on there.
It's an omen that it fits in.
How about the omen?
No.
Why not?
You think?
Why, you think that was in the same class, would like the exercise, the omen?
Would Gregory's pack?
It was different.
Okay, put it down.
The omen.
We want to have a thousand movies on here because Eric's a little, I don't know.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60.

Carry 47.
Edward 33.
Cousinus 16.
Sharpton 14.
And Gebhard only six for Dick.
Now I notice one thing every time we do any kind of a political poll lately, the last few months,
that Bush always starts out with a smaller number and then as time goes along,
is if, is just the people who are voting for him or really listening in the first place.
You know what I'm saying?
Is if somebody was like on a daisy chain or email or somebody, I'm not talking about getting free because we're not getting that many.
But oh, you better get on there and vote for Bush because the president's getting his ass picked on a poll by that fact,
Kamie Pinko leftist and it's important.
Right.
Oh, yeah, very scientific.

It's kind of like I got a cult following.
Right.
Fabulous.
Don Johnson, back when we used to like Don Johnson, back in his 90s, vice-dease.

You
You ask whole from 16 at 560 wqm happy Monday happy martin Luther King June day the fact that marium elephant is an evaporator is enough to make me want to
Yack gag sad
Here's the facts. It says your neal hello
Hello, we just got back from a one-week cruise started by the Royal Bank of Canada and it was the most unbelievable week of our life
Although we were not affiliated with the Royal Bank of Canada. We were on a family vacation
We've never seen a nicer and happier group of people like these Canadians in our whole lives
We listen to your show all the time. I always heard you talk about how nice the Canadians are and how wonderful the night life isn't Canada
Well, we got to witness it this week and you weren't exaggerating one bit every night
We went to the shifts nightclub young and older like route on the dance floor dancing till the wee hours of the morning
Another aspect of the Canadians we noticed is how friendly they were what great manners they have and how curious they are and you were
Absolutely
Is what it says well, thank you and I was I mean, why would I make it up? You know me?
I'm a hard bit in the old ass, right? I go to Amsterdam and a place sucks like this last December
I'll tell you I'm not gonna sit here and work for the chamber of commerce unless I'm on a payroll, which I'm not
It just happens to be true
educated polite courteous friendly nice. He laid back
You know, it's just a nice
Stress less kind of lifestyle as opposed to here. Oh, I got a 10-year-grade very short story
You're not gonna like the first part. Okay. Well
Yes, any morning I sit down. This isn't the first part of the story. I took a crap and I fleshed the tourlin
Oh, I don't like that. No, that's not the best. But it's so the the handle on my toilet
Like started wobbling, you know like it was just wobbling around the handle too
So I pick up the top of the toilet and I love the uh of the tank and I look and it's like all rusted out
It's obvious that there's no way to you know save it need a new ballcock
No, not a new ballcock just a new um asparagus, you know with the handle and the metal thing it was okay
Deliver the change the lever the lever brothers
And man, I'm gonna tell you I think was so rusted out and I'm I've got my pliers and I'm turning and twisting then of course it dot on me
It's a backwards thread. You know what I mean right right those are always backward
So I'm doing was tightening it
Well, so I finally get the thing off for the all apart and where where am I gonna go to get one of those at 10 o'clock on a Sunday morning, but
Oh, yeah, what I would have gone to came up, but we don't have no time to move so I went to a freaking Walmart
And I'm gonna tell you I looked around at the people in there and I thought let me get out of here and
By the way speaking of
There was almost nobody speaking in glazing air
Hey, I got news for it. We're it's it's finished. You're lucky
At least you uh, still got a little bit of it. Oh, you don't know your port to gacy
I don't know where they were from but they're sure we're not speaking in English in the Walmart
I'll buy the song right so anyway
I find I find what I'm looking for okay, right? And there were like two items I had to buy I had to get the flapper
Oh, yeah, okay the flapper for my crapper with it with the chain
And the other part the I have so I got my two items I go to the checkout which is there's
Luckily at that time in the morning very very slow 10 30 on a Sunday morning
And I go to this uh one counter and there's a woman. I didn't see her
Well cast because she wasn't there. She's got no she's got her shopping cart
With a whole a whole bunch of crap in it, but she's not there. She's gone off to go get some more
Oh, yeah, so the very nice young dark-complexed lady behind the counter she reached out
To take my two items and I handed him to her and she's staying out keep in mind
That the total of my big transaction was seven dollars and four cents, okay? Okay? Okay?
In other words it took from now until
That
And then nothing she just had to scan the two it took no time at all
So the woman who went over to get like whatever she comes back to her cart and she looks at the girl behind a counter she's
What happened
And she said you left you lost your place
I said it'll take 20 seconds. I just restrained myself because she had such a look like what happened like who the hell are you now keep in mind
She's got a cart full of crap. Oh, it's the new thing now. Yeah, there's many different ways that the cart saves your place your kids
Place no one there was no kid there was nobody else and it doesn't wait how many times if you've been like in the supermarket or one of those places
And there's a cart full of stuff and it doesn't really belong to anybody. It's just it's just there right
So I'm not being not being psychic at least that much
I wasn't able to like figure out that she was there plus it would have taken me probably 20 minutes to wait behind her and her
Her cart full of crap right, but the way it was the way she said it in the summer
What just happened as opposed to just oh, we're not gonna wait for you to keep adding things to your cart
I said it'll take 20 seconds which it did mm-hmm
It was $7.04. I had a five two singles and a dime the girl handed me six cents the stuff in a bag in my receipt
And if it took 20 seconds, okay, I'll bet Greg reads life on it. It didn't take longer than that
And she just had this look on her face as I and I thought to myself there you go again the typical example
Did we do the break by the way
Yes
Yes, we did yes, are you sure that's we got it verified on the digital
They were crossed it out and I never scratch it out which means I must be having a pretty good time not
No seriously. She was just so typical of the hostility here. Why oh, oh, you
Nothing it's the same thing would happen like a chopper's drug-mart in Toronto
That wouldn't have been a word it would have smudged you I would look at the person and they would have smiled
And you know what? So this happens you're standing in line behind someone who doesn't have anything in their arms
Yeah, you got your your two items or whatever it is
Or got forbidden like a jug of soda something that's uh, you know not light as a feather and you think that you're in the short line
Behind the person who maybe they just want to pack a cigarettes or something. Oh no
Then they summon their they're just the partner now
They're summoning the person with the two giant carts and they cut in front of you
Oh, this person was saving my spot and they've got a giant cart overloaded with the car right
Do you refrigerate the only one response to that? Yeah, it's gonna happen and how come
Everybody's all whipped up about the old fart that killed the other guy at the movie theater punched him and just punched his ass out
And the theater is getting flat because they're supposed to know that the old people are unruly
I see how secure they're gonna get in well fistfighting one guy like fall and going to a common croak. That's right
Even Rick Sanchez is embarrassed by that
The great escape 1963. Oh, yeah, and dark madam camions
1974 I don't know what that is. I feel a fault
Yeah, right
How about Debbie does your field ever seen any dark Canyon Debbie did your field before the Brazilians took it over
Boy, it's great to know we got three Brazilians less than oh right. That's exciting. This is the best day of my life so far
Here's the facts from Vian Boca and she says hi Neil of Ovie the hand Michael came lost his hand because it had it hanging out the window in the hand too
A semi truck driving too close to his car ripped it off just like that
It says congratulations on your patriots when I'm sure that all fans are fuming too bad
Just to let you know there are a lot of women. Oh here we go with this again
A lot of women listen to we had a point four a

Club 33 at five sixty WQM happy and Monday to him Martin Luther King day
Michael Jackson may uh walk away. He may never stand trial says the inquire this week
Prosecution screen and now they got all these delays. They're saying four to six months before anything really starts
Happen. Oh, just keep pushing it forward. Yeah, that's right. Did you say oh Jay? Oh, just oh geez prosecution scambles his experts predict Michael could go free
Michael Jackson may walk free without ever going to trial having to defend himself
That exclusive inquire investigation is discovered that the cancer stricken boy accusing Jackson of child trial
Oblussation is in desperate need of a kidney transplant
Maybe so will give him his
This tragic turn of events could end the prosecution of the king of pop again
Jackson 45 while we know what he's charged with the youngster who already lost one kidney to cancer is suffering from kidney failure
As being kept alive by dialysis
A blood pencing procedure which can have serious health consequences inside or told the inquire
The Santa Barbara District Attorney's office is continuously monitoring the health of the boy at the center of the accusation
The cases built around his testimony should he take a tragic turn before the case goes to trial
It could also spell tragic consequences for the case itself and Michael will get off
Again just as we predicted right
no question
And the reason that they're saying for delays is well because his attorney mark year ago
She's got so many other important trials like Scott Peterson yada yada yada well. What kind of justice is that?
You see what i'm saying? Mm-hmm. What kind of excuse is that? It's a lame excuse
But that's when you get when your name is freaking Michael Jackson
So let's have a party giving out invitations to neverland standing up on top of that limo
You can enjoy and snap at his fingers clamp at his hands
And the people the the people are bigger assholes than he is
Yeah, by far. He's the one that's making to go into the bank
What are they doing standing there making an asshole like it's to go to neverland right?
They got a free invitation to neverland. Oh, it was just wonderful. It was just beautiful
God people sometimes just make me want to yack
Al Pacino three-day dog uh dog day afternoon three-day dog night
Dog day afternoon Attica Attica
Remember Attica's bench. Oh wrong movie. What else will be we ought to have on the walking bird to kill a mocking bird with a great-grig-grig-peck
Now keep in mind a lot of a lot of what would you can i just say this because there are a lot of people who think well
You know some of these movies are so obvious
I guarantee if you walked into a shop in mall right now and you can find anybody who's spoken english
And you asked like a hundred people?
I bet you 90 people at least haven't seen most of these movies correct when the exception may be the godfather
Maybe godfather Fiddy Fiddy right? Oh, yeah
Sure, I mean it's like an an icon
The hospital George C Scott somebody faxed us about that last week
The hospital so speaking of to kill a mockingbird yes, you're good friend Robert DeVolgan there
And you don't even remember who he played
Boo he played yeah, he played the retard boo badly right i remember him that was great. He's always great. He was freaky
Uh, there was another really good movie with Robert DeVolgan
And it was a pre-1980 great Santini the ace. I don't know
You see it? No, you didn't see the great Santini. I saw the great Santini
I thought you said the ace same movie. Oh, they changed the name when it first came out
It was called the ace and they pulled it out of the theaters. It was a bomb. I mean
That kind of a bomb and then they we released it with a new name and it was uh became a I had a cult following
I see any time they say it had a cult following means it was a box office, you know mediocre at best right but it was a good movie
The great Santini with the great Robert DeVolgan
uh, the great Santini here four and a half stars in my book
In the blockbuster anti-taming book which we bought with a plain brown rapper. So nobody knew where we bought it
A career marine in the peacetime service. It's uh 79 was the year so we can get it on there. What I tell you the great Santini had a big weenie
Takes his natural belligerence out on his family, especially his son who's coming into his own
Wonderful story of family relationships good southern setting well-paced insightful with a marvelous cast and very well
Good review Robert DeVolgan, I love her. She's great
Beat you don't like blight. Danner life. Beth. I'm all right
She never stole a freight train. What do you don't like about her? Yeah
She just done a mild
Michael O'Keefe who is very good
Uh, you don't know the movie that uh, which they got that TV show with the same name which is a ripoff
I don't know if there's anything to do with it because I never watched it without a trace
I'm trying to think of us other
Trace it's uh was based I think on a true story maybe not about the little kid that gets the spirit
I think that the handyman the bag handyman killed him
Because us bags always get blamed for everything it's your fault
Uh without a trace without love without a home without a clue. Oh, that's a Greg Reed story
It's not in here without a trace. Oh my god. How can that be George
What kind of a stupid ass boah it's blockbuster. No wonder without a trace isn't in here. You know who's in there Judhersh
Yeah, you know like Judhersh nothing wrong with him
Boy you sure are picky man Judhersh is a damn good actor
What did I just say you said nothing wrong with it? He like all excited and jump up and down and it's great
I take somebody good to get me all excited to me like your anti-Semitic again not me without a trace
And I can't I don't know what it's definitely before 1980
gotta be
gotta be
Excellent movie if you if you don't have a tear in your eye
When Judhersh is driving into the other kid
Mm-hmm
And they're driving up through New England through the streets of New Haven and where the hell it is
And he sees the house that the psychic told the mother about and he sees that house and it just you just want to you just can't believe it
I don't want to spoil it. Don't spoil it. They find the kid
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 in merentine. Do we do mentoring candidate with Frank Sinatra?
In fact him no backlash that was talking about she was the first Hollywood star as she dated Frank Sinatra

Yes, well, I'm gonna have to call Eric is my computer. You're computer is I don't know what's wrong? I reset it
Oh my god, which 19 a pre-1980 movie do you think is a must see people ought to go out like today and buy it when it's stealing the godfather 31
Of course if you haven't seen the godfather what do we need to say is there anything we can say that'll get you off your ass
Huh, you haven't seen movies and the best part of it is now they can go out and instead of worrying about the first one or number two or number three
They go out there and get the trilogy they can get in order they can get the big collector's show with the extra foot
They can get whatever they want they get like a whole bunch of different versions
I'm gonna have to get the billi-ging and
Pretend they saw the third one
They're gonna leave with a pile of attitude wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
It's matter with you
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
31 votes for godfather. What was the movie with him and and Keanu Reeves again?
I'm thinking devil's advocate, but I never saw it. I think I was in I think it was in
And there's a reason I never saw it because it sucked
So I was told yes
And seriously his performance is scary it it's it disturbs me you know, I mean by that no, I do
Because he's a great actor when he wants to be but when he just wants to be that one always shouting and then I do it
In fact, he's almost like mohawar david in there. No dramatic. Yeah exactly mellow dramatic
We like a little more mellow and a little less mellow dramatic would be good
How about some mellow bars once last time we had a mellow bar? It's been a while
Malo mellow mellow cup. Yeah, it's been a while. Halloween those were good. They come around to make them sure
But I don't think they're the same as they used to be I don't think it's like real chocolate anymore
It says right on the package original all original yeah a mellow dangerously
With that marshmallow even filling or what marshmallow?
That's the mellow of the godfather 33 kooku's now 17 clockwork rn's 12 dr. Strangelove 12 jaws nine

The Brits of nickname Tony Blair the vice president of the US

No, the better idea is just to turn them off
Phil
He said the bill maher I know you don't like him, but they had check out a show on HBO
They had al Sharpton even though he's a racist. He tells them right wingers often holds no punches
He's got balls. Okay, whatever you say Phil. Don't waste your time with Fox News. Just do what I do. Don't ever watch it

Uh the birds for a boy is dog three. I'm telling you should be doing better than that and that's because most people haven't seen it right
It's so scared. It's an obscure movie. It's science fiction. It's fabulous Don Johnson Jason Robards. It is sensational
You know what it reminds me of the
Prisoner right same kind of a you know I'm saying mm-hmm just way out there weird strange
The in-laws three fail save three the omens got two with Gregory's peck
Now was William Holden was in the sequel right with Kim Hunter was a Kim Hunter trying to think
Omen part two there were four them actually which they should right right after the first one
Love and death to kill a mockingbird two the three age of the condom to
2001 space Odyssey to watch the great dialogue on the waterfront one and a fair remember one and one for everybody else
Oh, there's really something in this room. I'm serious all the time
You smelled the funk out there from the drippy ceiling. That's right because we got we got it's a little rain years today
Not a lot we had some rain so naturally QA where it's a we need a quick disinfectant job in a whole building
We've got dripping in the other room there
They've got a bucket because everybody else said just you could
I'm gonna fuck it. This happened the last time it rained right what okay and the one tile up there the one sound towel in the ceiling any minute
Now that thing is gonna just come pop it right through there
Right you can see it taking turns sitting under it. So what we're probably doing is breathing in like all the mildew in the mold and the
Crud that's circulating around the area and
Pregn spores. Nice going Greg. Why do your home probably getting a late a few times okay. Thanks

Well, let's see the question is are you sure? I'm looking at it right now 80
A. K. A Kentucky fried airplane can't do it. What pre-19 any movie to think is a must see for the
People to render by we can't do it. I'd love to put it on there, but we can't do it a
frenetically funny
gag laden spoof of the airplane disaster movies has pilotless plane heads for doom until a shaky ex-pilot haze
Head uh takes the controls dead pandalogy from stack graves bridges and neelson at city hysterics
And you're right that could be the funniest movie of all time Peter graves and of course don't forget
Carim Abdul Jabbar
Roger it's fabulous
If there's a funny movie than that I haven't seen it. I'd say you ever see a grown man naked but
WQA. I'm hello. No, yes sir. Um, how about um

I'll guarantee it's pre 80. I'll bet your life on it not by much
Apocalypse now there's the apron. I'm sure it it's 79 told you not even close

How old is it? I mean how old is it? It's 153 minutes, which is two hours and 23 minutes now they have the
Directors the redux is like four hours 33 minutes. It's how long
Like four you know, I got another good one, but you won't want to put it on there speaking a lot of movies you want to put it on but maybe you will
Speaking of a very long and directors cuts
Y'all once upon a time in America don't you don't agree?

Good fellows came out after the godfather, so I didn't like good fellows. I mean good fellows was fine
I didn't like his narration of the story
That was bothersome right it was it was extraordinarily annoying if they chose somebody that didn't have such an obnoxious voice as radio

And once upon a time in America bad zits
Right
Because he was a real man nasty asshole you want to pots and took us

New poll show that at a time of record deficits the public is against spending billions on a mars mission while cutting domestic priorities
Nonetheless, there's one company that has supported a mars mission for years
Halliburton oh my god
The company which was headed by vice president dick channey and his major financial backward demonstration has long supported funding a mars plan because it's good for
It's drilling technology business. It was also channey who spearheaded the mars plan inside the White House
just a coincidence
In fact kipplingers reported back in 2001 several companies in university labs will stand to benefit from new projects in a mars mission
including Halliburton and the payoff could be big
Citizens against government waste notes that despite the White House's initial low-balling
legitimate cost estimates for the new program range from
550 billion to a trillion dollars just a trillion dollars. I will put it on the credit card right
