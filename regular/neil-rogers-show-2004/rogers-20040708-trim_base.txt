This is the radio station. It's a crazy house.
Crazy people.
We got sports radio vibes to get to the U.K.A.M. by Ellie Ford-Large.
The great-great-well, he's that well.
That's it well.
Donald Frost.
Good bye, Tom Koeleye.
We'll be back for a moment.
Russell also is a Hayden with a semi-duty squad that owns
this high-dune-up still alive.
That's a common sense of choice.
Russell, you're a great big fatso.
Or once you've gotten over to the memory.
You move your billions of dollars to the table to take out your parents.
With two tons of dirt, you're a perfect family boss.
I don't know if they should get to see me that's why.
That's the semi.
It's too bad you didn't have a good idea to pass.
And then the half-a-china has an half-a-go-roll.
It's in spring-take.
Six thousand dollars.
You fare it.
You should know better not to put it in the hall.
We're in a hell of a restart.
I think I'm going to start by giving a better description.
I heard you a little bit on Tuesday.
Okay.
Well, I don't know.
You were talking about when you walked into the door.
I don't really know how you described my little mishap here on Saturday night.
That you stumbled for some of the reason to hit a hot summer.
I hadn't stumbled for an unknown reason.
I stumbled because the phone rang at midnight in the middle of the night.
I did not have a phone in my bedroom all the way to now.
Because there's no jacket there.
So I now put my portable phone in there.
Phone rings at midnight.
And of course, you were in a deep sleep like Eric Homo.
Because I've been at the Niagara Falls Casino for like the previous 26 hours and slept two hours of it.
So I'm going to deep sleep in the phone rings and out in the dark.
Because my phone only rings about three times before it goes on voicemail.
So naturally, you have to like really run out.
And you assume if it's ringing at that time, it's like something urgent, you know?
You assume.
Right.
And so I go darting into the living room, but of course, didn't make it.
And when it's getting on the floor out of my knees,
he scraped the hell out of my knee.
And then it was like a car accident.
It just smashed my head into my dining room table.
Like hitting the mouth with a hockey stick or a baseball bat.
Yeah.
So my upper lip is still splitter.
It got a nice thing on it.
And my knee is just scraped to beat the band.
So that's why I was not on Tuesday.
Now, as far as the Duff and Clarence are concerned,
I really don't know where to start with all this other stuff.
So the first let's give the bad news from Bagdad.
Four US troops in an Iraqi National Garment were killed today in the Central Racky City of Samara.
Twenty soldiers and three Iraqis were wounded, and one US soldier is missing.
Some more bad news from Iraq, even though of course we've turned over the case of the Kingdom,
and they had that really great democracy run full tilt.
Here's George's poll result from yesterday.
Which dead person used to want a nail?
Let's talk some good ones.
To that yellow one here.
I voted for River Penis only because they only had two males on here.
Right.
For us fangs.
I certainly had JFK Jr.
I mean, oh man, he was gross.
It was popular though, all the women wanted him.
And I think they saw him.
So, who else is top of your Tony Geary?
Who?
Tony Geary from that soap opera.
Does he remember Luke and Laura?
Oh, yeah, with the purg, him with the yellow.
Tony Geary, that girl, okay.
I mean, he's about his, uh, he, I've had ball movements that look better than him, okay?
Did you take pictures?
Yes, I'll be sending the symbol.
Put them on the website.
Which 10-fech will send us into Greg to make him feel bad, okay?
Greg, you just just leave me alone.
Okay, go away.
Get out of my life.
I have no interest in you and anything about you.
Just make sure to check you up on time.
Oh, brother.
And of course, there's additional knives you can see.
Now that the deal is on July 19th, well, I think that was the date that they were whispering to me.
940, clear channel again.
Another active desperation with that station that they keep butchering and changing the format.
That every year or two, a 944, a Fox Sports is down the tubes.
Bye-bye.
History, say goodbye to 940 Sports.
Bye-bye!
Oh, what a shame.
To be replaced by the rumor is,
Air America, if it's still on the air by then,
Al Franken is going to kick our ass and for else supposed to be at the rumors,
he fits in there too somewhere.
Now, I don't know how that works because he shows on like 10-to-3 and Franken's on Noon-to-3.
So I think what they're going to do is they're going to have him like on it at the same time.
Okay.
Yeah, bring them all on, baby.
See, I get paid the same whether we have a 30 share or one share, a 0.0,
and it makes no difference.
So bring them all on and have a good time.
Anyway, which dead person is still on the mail?
You people are sick.
325 said that.
Thank goodness I was not a part of that.
Right, he was strictly George and Josh.
By the way, Jack did a nice job the week you wrote on vacation.
I wish I could say the same about Zach.
Zach, he didn't remember what he doesn't say anything.
Number two, he speaks like he's whispering all the time.
I think he's scared.
No, no, even listen to him on with Joe.
I don't know if he's got like some kind of a vocal problem, a vocal chord thing,
or he can barely speak.
Am I the only one who notices that?
He's a husky guy with a husky voice.
Oh, come on.
Marilyn Monroe, 177.
She was the winner of those people who were mentioned other than you people are 625.
See, I must see.
This is just fantasy.
I'm just interested in question George was asking, but some of you people take this like micro-feelier.
Like the hunchback of Notre Dame and Esmeralda.
Whatever name was.
Flooded for Christ.
Yeah.
In other words, which one of these people who's dead?
You could use this little fantasize.
I would have put Brandon to will down there myself.
Not the one in Shane, I'm sorry.
I would put one in a fall fall down.
Come back Brandon.
Brandon to will down.
Oh, he won't be coming back.
Natalie would 147.
She's still a floating up here in the sea somewhere.
She's that floating.
Alia.
Alia.
Right, 88.
Alia, I'm sorry.
Salina, 71.
Princess Diana.
We'll get back to you.
Diana, 68.
We'll see her no more.
I didn't want to do her, which was alive.
And how do you like that sewage dream that the Queen donated to her there?
Wouldn't that beautiful?
The Princess Diana sewage dream in England.
It's a beautiful thing.
There are people like waiting up to their ankles.
And it was just a lovely thing.
And the water pushes both ways.
Princess Diana, 68.
Lacey Peterson, 52.
Oh, you better be Scott Lacey Peterson intensive, no?
Oh, brother.
Wow.
Oh, breaking news.
Home line defense.
You remind of continuing our kind of threat.
Woo!
Everybody get ready to hide under the bed.
Because they're going to give us another warning.
Okay, are they continuing our kind of threat?
Even though they kept telling us they were doing such a great job of disinvolving Alcada?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Yes, so the threat continues to be really scared, because like Michael Moore tells you in Fahrenheit 9-11,
that's the one thing that really they got going for them is keep people peeing in their pants.
And then they'll vote for this bunch of neo-Nazis.
Lacey Peterson, 52.
Dorothy Stratton, 45.
I have no idea who that is.
I'm so sorry.
Judy of the Playboy Playmate that got killed.
By her husband or boyfriend.
Never heard of Blue Brace.
I've been a 40-4.
I sure knew Saker.
Savannah 42.
Dana Playo 40.
Chrissy Taylor 40.
Jan Mansfield 38.
Boy, she had big, big problems.
JFK Jr. 36.
Boy, he was talk about by any other name.
If his name would have been Ted Smith, forget about it.
By the way, Ted Smith still brought it to Tom Pato Park.
No.
Cedia Cruz 33.
Now we're talking.
Nicole Brown Simpson 28.
River penis 18.
He got my vote by default.
Nell Carter 17.
Nell Carter?
Hey.
Oh, come on.
Big fat mama.
Lana Clarkson, leveler by Lana Lane.
What's your name, Lana?
Leta Lane.
Linda Lovelace 11.
And Angelique Petty John has won.
Today's the list of people who are no longer with us,
we'd still like to stick it to them.
Claudia Schiffer, here's one you who's still alive.
She's behind the big curtain young lady today.
She was born August 25th, 1970 in Rheinberg, Germany,
which makes her 30...
About 30, man.
No, 34 in August.
All the 33 right now, this moment.
Chosen by people magazine in 1990 is one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.
We've got nice photo there on our website.
Right.
And the fraud you Claudia Schiffer fans, who are those guys who like seeing boobies,
who are just the horny guys who just want to see anything.
Her filmography, love actually.
Life without dick.
I'm sorry.
In pursuit, the sound of Claudia Schiffer, desperate but not so...
I think that's our programming period.
That's different clearance, desperate but not serious.
That was about them.
Black and white, friends and lovers, I think that also includes them.
The blackout, richy rich, no kin to fat rich.
Oh, we'll get into that momentarily.
And then a whole bunch of stuff and other...
What is the story with that?
Ice squelm vacans?
Huh?
It looks like Danish.
Because it's got that little thing over the...
Oh!
And a bunch of other stuff.
So she's been around.
Everybody knows her, of course, Claudia Schiffer.
You don't know her then.
You probably some...
I always gonna say some kind of a fag,
even as fag is no Claudia Schiffer, so you're out of touch.
I got a great, fantastic article I'm gonna give to it.
I don't want to do too much reading because my offer lip is split.
But the poll today doesn't really require a lot of additions.
Plus, once I get into my main topic, I just might ramble on for quite some time.
At great length.
You know what I mean by that?
No, what do you mean?
In other words, I got a lot of crap.
Here's today's poll.
What's the most important issue to you in this year's election?
God, we got 80 men and...
Oh, it was so...
It was such a beautiful thing to see him.
Kenny laid, taken off and handcuffs on him.
There it is.
Look at that!
Look at that!
The indictment is 65 pages long.
All right.
Nail his ass.
It must be just a coincidence that they decided to hand out this indictment now and put him in the...
the who's call?
Put him in handcuffs.
Right at the time just before the election.
Or did they consider coincidence?
Yeah.
Kenny Boy?
They pushed barely even knew him.
He didn't know no Kenny Boy.
It's kind of like Frankie Pantangely.
I didn't know no Godfather.
What's the most important issue in this year's election to you?
We asked.
Here's a list of two, four, six, eight, ten, a dozen.
Oh, did you see the documentary on MSNB?
It wasn't a documentary.
It was a different Norfolk film on MSNBC last night.
No.
Catholic Church?
No.
And actually they got through the entire hour without William O'Donnell.
Whatever that guy's name was.
They were all on O'Donnell Hill.
O'Donnell Hill?
Yeah.
The angry Catholic spokesman.
Anyway, most important issue, Iraq.
Abortion.
Healthcare.
Integrity.
I don't give a shmit about anything.
Cuba policy.
Game marriage.
Taxes.
Affirmative action.
Maybe criminalization of pot.
The wiki weed.
Freedom of speech.
Or the separation of church and state.
Oi.
Of course, you know, those of you who are interested in freedom of speech.
I sure love to know which candidate you're supporting because I haven't discovered one yet who believes in that.
But nothing's perfect, right?
Right.
Linda Little Roosh.
I'll take you one thing.
Now there was a commentator on CBC here that they went and announced the John Edwards thing.
He had a great line.
He said, well, John curious, Rick someone who at least will add some life to the ticket.
He was like, certainly in, tripling in, like, just like that when he said it.
Add some life to it otherwise.
Doll looking ticket.
Dead man in a suit.
Herman Munster in drag, whatever.
And you notice that two of them together was like, they're right.
Exciting.
Two of them together.
Hug.
They're almost kissing.
Right.
I thought they were going to do something, right?
They're grinding.
12 minutes after 10 to 5.
60 WQM on this Tuesday the day after.
Poor George had to work on the 4th of July holiday, but it really wasn't the 4th.
So what can I say?

Was it really?

and also faces a U.S. Security and Exchange Commission probe of a $180 million slush fund
that may have been used to pay vribes.
How do you like that?
Oh my God.
Although the White House Council amelization is not available to the public because of
the secrecy of a trinity client privilege, it has generated speculation among senior White
House Aids who suggest the vice president should step down as W's running mate for the
November elections.
So it's thought has increased in GOP circles lately with former New York Senator Al Dymotto
yesterday calling on Bush to dump Cheney to go take a big dump.
Those of Red the Inilization state presented devastating case against the vice president
and concludes that Cheney has violated both the spirit and intent of federal laws on conflict
of interest.
Even worse, even better, Cheney faces indictment by a French court on charges of bribery,
money laundering and misuse of corporatists, if because a fraud associated with the
conscript of a $6 billion dollar petrol chemical plant built by Halliburton and Igeria in partnership
with TechMap, one of France's largest petrol chemical engineering companies.
Cheney is under investigation by Judge Renoir von Roimbeek, one of France's most famous
investigating magistrates, he's a legend in legal circles because of investigation of
French campaign scandals in the 90s resulting in multiple indictments and convictions of
top officials.
Because of Roimbeek's work in the case, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's open
investigation into a $180 million slush fund that the French judge says was used to pay
bribes.
London attorney Jeffrey Tesla, a consultant at Halliburton, admitted under oath in May that
he made payments from the fund to Albert Jack Stanley, president of Halliburton subsidiary
Kellogg Brunen, and wrote an longtime friend in the associate of Cheney.
The payments Tesla said were personally approved by Cheney who headed Halliburton at
the time.
Although Cheney left his position at Halliburton before becoming VP, his financial disclosure
statement shows it continues to receive dividends from stock, as well as deferred compensation
from the company.
At least $5 million in payments to Stanley from the fund were wired away.
Secret number bank account in Zurich, which Judge Roimbeek discovered belonging to KBR
president, Kellogg Brunen, and Root.
Tesla also testified he claimed that the 350 grand to another KBR executive William
showed ran, though through another secret bank account on the Isle of Jersey.
And there's a lot more.
I email it.
I've faxed it.
I emailed it to Eric.
It'll be on our website.
Cheney faces criminal indictment.
Oh, right.
I'd like that.
I'm rubbing it.
All right.
The lamp that is.
Here's the first early returings on our poll.
What's the most important issue to you in this year's election?
Iraq 20, separation of church and state 11, freedom of speech 10, integrity 5, health
care 4, decriminalization of part 3.
I don't give a shmit about anything 3.
Taxes 1, affirmative action 1, abortion 1, Cuba policy 1, gay marriage is got to be
big.
Oh, so far the first 60 votes.
It's a smattering.
Just a little sample.
Okay, let's get into the good stuff now.
Okay.
Okay.
So Monday, let's see Tuesday morning.
I'll keep in mind my mother had been in the hospital for a few days.
And she had some gastrointestinal problems.
She had pancreatitis.
She had a diardi.
Keep in mind also she was 91 years old.
Monday, this past Monday, July 5th was her 91st birthday.
Okay, keep all of these things in mind.
Okay.
So Saturday night I had this, like really having a car accident in your house, in your apartment
with my head hitting the end of my coffee table.
I'm just a mess.
In fact, I think a lot of times you get like a really minor concussion from that, but
you know, I really sure of it.
And the bridge of your nose and you can feel the pressure in your sciences and look all
of these things.
So I'm saying, all of these things.
Right.
So Tuesday morning I wake up and planning on doing a show.
Well, actually when I went to bed Monday night, I thought, well, I'll see how my lip
is healing up.
I can actually speak for four hours because when you have anything oral, no, not that.
When you have anything oral, it's like, no, it's hard to speak for four hours because
it irritates you even more.
It's a tongue thing, a mouth thing, or whatever.
We're still talking about injuries, right?
Right.
So Tuesday morning I wake up and I couldn't do it.
Couldn't possibly do the show.
So I call up muff.
I call up miss Duff, an emotional cripple at seven o'clock, even it was early in the
morning, to alert him to alert you that I wasn't going to be doing the show on Tuesday.
I go in my living room and sit down.
I'm 20 minutes later, the phone rings and it's called from my roommate John and Florida
telling me that my mother passed away at five o'clock the previous afternoon.
Now see, there always are those people who want to tell you how you should feel, how you
should react, what you should do, and what you should think.
I don't even know where to start on this because the, what has happened today is only Thursday.
He got on Monday, which was on her birthday, my first birthday.
Let me just preface what I'm going to say by saying this.
I can't speak for anybody else, but if I could live to be 91 and live in the kind of good
health without any walker without a wheelchair, without a cane, without a living nurse, without
being in a nursing home, all of these things put together.
All of these things.
I would like kiss the ground right now and I think most people would too.
I'll take it.
Right, 91.
Good herb.
Self-sufficient.
Drive in your little car, go to the supermarket, and it was kind of like a sudden thing.
She had a massive heart attack and that was the end.
It wasn't as though she suffered for weeks and months, but I'm supposed to be grieving, I
guess.
I'm supposed to be very depressed and I'm supposed to be looking for everybody's sympathies
and condolences and I'm supposed to be going to the funeral of this weekend, which I'm
not going to be doing.
And I know that there are going to be people saying, oh my god, you're up-bashed.
You've got a heartless, cool, hearted bastard.
We always do it.
You're not even going to your own mother's funeral.
I don't quote a funeral.
The only funeral I'm going to be going to will be my own.
You sure?
Well, I might not even show up for that.
Marlon Brando, they just had a very brief ceremony for him and he was cremated and that
was it and that's what I believe in.
I think I'm entitled to believe in whatever I want to believe, at least as of the moment
until I take that away, which they're working on.
But the kind I called, I called the dust later on that morning about 9 o'clock and I talked
to George about 9.30 whatever was.
And the past along the news that my mother passed away and I said to George, don't say
anything on the air about it.
I'll talk about it myself on Thursday, what I'm on the air.
And you would have thought that would have been the end of it.
Was it the end of it?
No.
Well, that was only the beginning.
Only the beginning.
I get a call earlier that afternoon, Tuesday, from Fat Rich, my race track friend, I read.
Yeah.
How did Fat Rich fight about it?
Well, he called in about something being the end of it.
And of course, having no life and called in.
What was it all about when you were on the air?
His brother's stores.
His brother's adult stores, headshots, whatever they are.
Well, what does that have to do with them?
Nothing.
I was talking about them and he was talking about his head.
Shops?
Yes.
Oh my God.
Well, I was keeping the license until July 19.
So anyway, Fat Rich calls in.
I don't understand.
If he called in, wasn't you not sitting there on the other side of the window?
No, no.
It didn't have an on-the-air conversation.
He called myself.
No, no.
You're not letting me finish.
All right.
You're too defensive and right.
Sorry.
So, wasn't you not sitting there?
You were sitting where I sit.
Right.
Where you are right now.
How is it that you put Fat Rich on hold and spoke to him to come out?
I mother would pass away.
I try to tell you.
He didn't call in the air.
He called myself on.
He called yourself on?
Yes.
Why are you on the air?
A break.
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And you passed it along to him.
Meaning, of course, only the best of intentions since Fat Rich and I are such close personal
friends.
Okay.
Sorry.
That was only the beginning.
All right.
See, if I would have wanted, I have Fat Rich's phone number, believe it or not, I have his
phone number.
I have his cell phone number.
I could have called him or anybody else if I wanted to inform of that.
If that would have been the end of it, I would have thought, well, it's one of those things.
And he's a good guy.
I've known him a long time in the audience.
I never would be the inventor.
Although, of course, he probably got the biggest mouth of anybody who ever met in your
life.
So by the time Fat Rich learned that my mother passed away, probably everybody in Dave
Broward, Palm Beach and maybe even Monroe counties was aware of it.
Not that there's any problem with that, but I would prefer to handle these things in
my own way as opposed to other people being yet to pop up up up up with that kind of crap.
You see what I'm saying?
Yes.
Okay.
Then I get a call yesterday afternoon from Jeff Rimmer, the former horse of the franchise,
who hates you like poison by the way, Goli.
He hates you.
He despises you.
You see, now that Rimmer is leaving, now he doesn't have to hold back anymore.
Well, here's a fact from Todd who says the movie is great.
While we get to that event, so I got a lot of heavy duty personal crap to one load here
today.
I'm letting it all out.
I'm holding absolutely nothing back.
So here's Jeff Rimmer on the phone to tell me that he had a call from me.
Well, first he says my condolences about your mother passing away, so how did you hear
it?
He had a call from Jeff Cohen if they pizza love.
Okay.
I think that's a good point at which to take the break now.
I just let the audience absorb that.
He had a call from Jeff Cohen at the pizza love to inform him that my mother had passed
away.
Are you following all of it?
Yeah.
I'm taking the day.
Okay.
Well, start taking notes and you can compound it in like a little article.

Oh my God!
Help me!
Stay good, who's the morning?
We have a yellow light that must be
They have something to hide
That's how they
They do they get blind
Which really hurt me
How those bloods you
Is even like a yellow light
They're shy, shy
The corporate be your life
And that's why
We have a yellow light
That's explained
The mean of what needs light to
What needs light to
Which is that instead
With the set of no days
And no no start to move
It's a day that's not fair
What needs to be
They have a yellow light
That's explained
Something they can survive
That's why
We have a yellow light
Of these, today, today
What needs to be
What is happening?
You know, I mean, you're in sparse confidence, doesn't it?
No!
There's comrades
No more aren't going to come on line
By the end of the video
There you go
And, of course, isn't it interesting on the day
When the latest polls had come up
One of the polls shows that Bush and the Cheney are eight points behind the carry
Edwards team, 49 to 41, would maybe get a couple of points.
A couple of others show a closer to that, but one of the polls shows that the
Edwards choice by carry has boosted them up quite a bit.
Right.
So it's probably only coincidence when you think that Tom Ridge is standing there now saying
that Al-Qaeda may be entering the operational or planning phase of an attack before the
election November.
Tom Ridge is making that warning right now as we speak.
It's locations.
No news specific intelligence exists, however, Ridge is not announcing that he's raising
the national color coded threat level beyond yellow or the elevated level.
But like Michael Moore said in Furnite 9-11, and like I said in the last hour, keep him
on a state of panic, man.
He didn't scare.
It was not immediately clear how the assessment of existing intelligence as Edwards to
his remarks.
Santa Majority leader, the anxious Bill Fist of Tennessee said the intelligence was
very non-specific, and there was no reason for panic, no reason for paralysis, no reason
like the Peanure Pants.
In fact, this is the best part.
I mean, anybody would have a brain ought to stop and think about this.
They're in what he said.
This is not a major announcement.
It's just a fact.
The reality is of increased risk here in the homeland over the next several weeks and
the next several months.
There is no specific intelligence of a tight attack on either of the major political conventions
or anything.
It's just a real state of panic here.
So they have this question that you'd come to your mind if you have an IQ.
Larger than your thumbnail is...
Why?
Yeah, in case you forgot.
Right.
Just in case you forgot to stay on edge.
Don't go into a whole panic and call me up and say, now's what's wrong.
After that, we'll just keep an eye on it.
Okay?
Keep an eye peeled.
God, it is so obvious.
They're so transparent what they're doing.
They're so desperate.
And the chainy stuff that's coming down, all I can say to them is, oh, right.
Yeah, you ain't seen nothing yet, baby.
The vice president, these were the people that were going to restore morality and decency
to the White House.
Some of the biggest crooks that ever came down to pike.
And when they break the polling down and they show, for example, White males, that's the
thing that just...
It's astonishing to me.
Bushes ahead in White males, I think, was 53 to 38%.
Yeah, they're supposed to be the White ones, I mean, the smart ones.
They are?
Yeah, but you're forgetting where a whole lot of them live.
Oh, no, I don't forget.
I visit them often.
You saw that map before the show, those red states.
The red states?
There you go.
The commission, the SEC, today launched a proceeding proposing a rule that would require
all radio and TV broadcasts to record and maintain copies of broadcasts for a separate
period of time.
That could be used to help a process in decency complaints 60 or 90 days.
Got that tape rolling?
Oh, yeah, rolling one now.
How about the tape?
Oh, no.
I got this tape.
Careful.
No, I'm way back in the beginning of that.
What is it, Doug?
Doug, speak to me.
Sorry.
Get any more calls.
Anyway, the SEC requires complaints currently submitting complaints to submit either
recording to transcripts of broadcasts.
Some of them, of course, being professional complaints.
Oh, it was disgusting.
It was filthy.
I'm complaining that this may have a process that many, including FCC commissioner Michael
cops have complained, there's two burdens to them on listeners.
So the onus has to be on us broadcasters that we're going to have to be recording broadcasts
for keeping them for 60 or 90 days.
But you like that?
How long do we keep them as it is?
We don't.
We don't keep them.
We don't make them.
We don't keep them.
I see.
Well, we certainly don't provide them anybody.
We don't do tapes, including for the sales department.
We don't do tapes.
You idiots.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, you should probably take a few calls now, right?
Yeah, whatever.
So we can get to some of those idiots.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5.
Well, that's another thing.
I don't want to get started on him, but I will anyway.
I'll give you a good example.
If for example, I got a sympathy card from Moa Howard David.
You know what I mean?
Do do do do do do.
Do you think that that would have any significance to me?
You wouldn't pray to it?
You know what I'm talking about?
I do.
I mean, it's a rather different that I'm trying to like coexist with him now.
I find him to be one of the most repugnant creatures.
I was going to say human beings with that would be a stretch.
One of the most repugnant creatures I've ever encountered in my life.
He's tried to get everybody fired.
He's a very receptive janitor and he'd probably be working on him next.
Because he had cleaned up the droppings from the rodent well enough.
I mean, this is a guy who's tried to screw with my career, tried to get George fired.
Anybody that worked on that show who looked at him cross-eyed, and this guy really believes
that it would have, and of course he didn't.
I'm not saying that he did.
And I'm sure that you probably have a whole bunch of sympathy cards there in my mailbox,
right?
In the box?
No.
No.
See that?
That's what I'm saying.
That is the way you do it.
I'm putting out a memo so that the salespeople can start calling people and inviting folks
to show up with my mother's funeral.
People who never even knew her.
She wouldn't know them from East Cape Bivill, from anybody.
We're dealing with people who are just, if I were to say that it's not a people place,
I would have to be an understatement of the century.
That's plenty.
Dominic QM is not a people place.
It's a crazy people place.
There you go.
Dominic QM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Good.
First of all, congratulations on 91 years with your mom.
That's great.
That's a good way to look at it.
Okay.
Listen, I was watching Cross-Fired the other day, and they put up that other great chart.
You know, the colored one, which takes mainly both the Republicans, Democrat, no matter who
the politician is.
Yeah.
And last three elections, they showed Al Phoron.
They were talking about how Flaught had a key in it.
Now, you know, for two years it was a Democratic vote, and Clinton got in.
And last year, it was a vote that Republicans vote, and it got in.
And that's why I thought that Carrie Pickett's effort was bad.
I thought if he could go Graham, I think he would have walked up Florida, which actually
would have been with him, the presidential.
I just wanted to talk about it.
But you're forgetting about the cosmetics of the public, about the mentality of the public.
I mean, John Kerry and Bob Graham, as much as I like Bobbi Graham, on the stage together,
would have been like watching people in a muscle-eum.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I know they're both dead.
They're good men in my suit, you know?
But it ain't about, you know, cars are no longer in existence.
People go both no matter what they vote, you know.
They don't care about issues, they care about issues of man, but it's been elected to
begin with.
You know?
I'm going to like to ask Valley.
I'll see you at the polls early and often.
You got it, now.
Okay, Prali.
5.670560, £560, and it's amazing.
Look at us getting rid of bushes of only bit on there for a couple of minutes.
It's already in second place as well as the priorities of this audience.
45, look at that, 52 votes.
It's going to pass a rack like them, rag heads are standing still.
WQA, and hello.
Yeah, I want to speak to Neil.
Speaking.
Neil.
Yes.
Neil Rogers.
You're truly, yes.
Huh?
That's me.
What can I do for you, sir?
He seemed to be having difficulties.
Stull it out.
You sure I got to wait.
Neil, you're answering your own phone call now?
Yes, that's correct.
I answered the phone.
I mean, they pay me enough.
Okay, Neil, it is you.
No, no.
Usually they screen at first.
No, no.
They're not the mother's thing.
You know, I just want to concur with what you were saying about how you're supposed
to act because there was your mother or father.
I had a mother, my mother called me.
I think I spoke to her about three weeks ago.
She called me and asked me.
He didn't even call me on Mother's Day.
She said to me.
Oh, yeah.
And since she goes on to tell me how embarrassed she was in front of her friend, listen
to that.
She lives in New Jersey.
Well, why don't you do have her friends sitting around all day waiting for the
further ring, is that it?
You know, I guess.
I don't know.
You know, and I want to say to her, I said, wait for them.
I haven't heard from you for the last six birthdays.
But forget about me because I'm used to that.
Everybody living your own daughter.
I don't think she's ever even received a birthday card from me.
You know her response was?
Well, she's never called me on my birthday either.
Exactly.
Exactly, right?
Oh, man.
Hey, on, on.
And that's the truth.
On a brighter note, on a different note, I had a roommate.
Okay.
They just have to opt for the live with me.
My name was Patrick.
I don't know if you remember Bigot deep in.
You used to come and see you at the radio station once in a while.
Yeah.
You don't remember him, Pat?
No, don't.
You don't?
Okay.
He was my roommate.
That's roommate I ever had.
He was a straight guy though.
But I always spoke about you.
Anyway, I have a good day, Neil.
Well, bring Patrick back to our visit.
Okay, real soon.
Okay.
Yeah, you used to talk about him on the radio all the time, too.
He was my roommate for like two years.
How long ago was this?
It was about, I think, anyone that could look and die.
All he would do is just best roommate I had.
No, but I think, how long ago was this?
Probably about seven years ago.
Well, I guess you can't remember him.
I guess you can't remember him.
You old and seem like me.
I'm lucky to remember where I was yesterday.
Thanks a lot, Pat.
I have a great day.
I thought you were late, by the way.
27th past 11 and 560 WDQYM.
I guess I probably should spend at least an hour or two on my, some of my relatives,
shouldn't I?
Yeah, well, not while you're at it.
Maybe I will.
You might be hiding in the local area.
420 on 560 WDQYM.
Yeah, absolutely.
You can't run west the clock.
How would be in swings of light, John?
And would you be an hour sharp in drunken sea?
Drunken pooled to sun and cow.
It earned my junior colon, Powell Tim.
Robin, Sue Cerendon, and Otama Binani.
I'm just joking.
You used to be talking to me.
I am not.
Better not be in the woods.
Or they won't be church boys.
Well, we know I want to play the bit because I like the bit.
I never played it before.
But we already know the answer.
John Edwards, maybe he'd have man.
I noticed on the flood report, it says, it's got a picture of a carry.
And Edwards can't keep their hands off each other.
I think Miss Fudge is getting a little excited.
Yeah, Jeff.
Maybe, Jealous.
I mean, like, he'd do John Edwards, huh?
I'll bet.
Come on, Matt.
What do you say, Miss Fudge?
Come out.
Come out wherever you are.
You're a little screamer.
And by the way, Hillary didn't get it.
Hillary didn't get it.
How do you like that?
Remember that a few days ago, he had the flashing lights on.
They were in the buzzer.
Washington is Hillary's going to be the pick.
Word that I'm hearing is that she was never even considered.
There was never any discussion about her.
How do you like that?
Not another mistake on a battery for it.
Oh, man.
With the big flashing lights, like carrying the internet, big scandal that never happened.
What a nitty-縮, what a little self-hating, quizzling fag.
Here is the fact that, as almost every day of the day, I have a thank you by the way,
Captain and Mimey, for nice facts.
I must every day listen to the show and I might boyfriend read these stories off your awesome
website.
No matter what happens that day, I always feel a little bit better hearing you.
That's how little funky.
Well, it's the best I can do with my Mr. Belly-Doo together.
And maybe, Doctor, you can tell me about the kneecap when you scrape your knee.
Yeah, why does it?
It's a scab up around the perimeter, around the edges and then like the inside is still like,
ooh, that reminds me of you.
I don't know.
Well, why not?
Sorry.
You're supposed to know about those things?
You'd think that wouldn't you.
But isn't that correct?
That's the way it works, typically.
It sits okay.
I've got like polished four inch weird all over it.
A polished four is good stuff.
I never even knew that till recently.
It's excellent.
I have to go get some.
Just wear some, wherever you feel like a little acropane or maybe even in your...
Back to get hurt on my boil.
Anyway, Catherine said, oh yeah, my boil has come along beautifully and it is not a cyst.
It is not a tumor.
It was a boil and I pricked it.
Anyway, Catherine says I've worked at the outback.
I recently did my own pull.
I asked everyone that works there, which way they would vote in November.
Over two thirds of them were either not registered or not voting and didn't care.
Didn't care.
Well, what do you expect at the outback?
About...
Even some of them asked me, why are you?
Luckily, if you said they were willing to learn more about both candidates so I gave them some info, including your website.
Thanks for fighting for the lesser of Abel's meal and you got your thumb right on it, Catherine.
That's exactly the way I describe it.
PS, just wanted to turn you on to a couple of new releases.
Spartan, what must be about Michael Moore?
And Fog of War documentary, also an old flake, Boondock Saints, William DeFoe Rocks.
Morrissey has a new CD called, You Are the Quarry, It's Great.
And lastly, a poll suggests in what one element began to downfall civilization and what's the only thing that can save humanity.
I'll finish the answer to the first question.
Religion.
That was the beginning of the end.
Is there any debate on that?
Nope.
That was the beginning of the end and again, what is religion stem from?
Fear of death.
Like Madeline O'Hare used to say before she was sliced up in the pieces.
Like she used to say in my show all the time, religion without a hell isn't worth a damn.
And what a great way to put it.
Oh, you're going to burn a hell.
How often do we get that from these lunatics out there?
You guys are going to burn the hell.
You pervert, uh, Woyati-Adiad, all this other crap.
I've been checking real closely in spite of that Jonathan Edwards from the other side show,
which I think they finally took off.
I hope they keep moving it and burying it deep into the night.
They ought to bury him, see if he comes back.
But I don't see any of, a whole bunch of folks coming back to you.
No, just Jesus.
And of course we have the deal with the ghost, you know, ghost and the memory and the sin of God.
Because that, of course, perpetuates all of this belonging.
I don't understand.
I mean, I guess most people would like to live forever in good health,
but that just isn't the way it works out.
It's just they're not nature, you know, they don't work that way.
Yeah.
We like to look like what we were about like 20 or 25 and they lived about 400 years old
and good health and with no disease and no illness and no aches and pains.
But the Lord works in mysterious ways.
What can I tell you?
He's punishing us for something that a bunch of people did thousands of years ago,
according to the crazy people that believe this garbage.
And they're, oh, you know something?
I'm doing it around here and I am must.
Must.
The spirit of Christ compels me to get to the story about the Portland Oregon Church,
the Archdiocese, right, filing for bankruptcy.
See, this is the new scan.
They talked about this on the different reveal show.
I in a few other people watch last night because I'm channel serving.
I really not that crazy about watching, whatever else is on.
I think I'll king head on Gene Hackman, which I like to eat in Hackman,
but I don't want to see him on a show.
Right.
I don't want to see that crap.
Oh, I guess what John carrying his wife will be on with King tonight.
Those people are constantly.
Uh-huh.
So they're putting out for the hour, John, and what's your name?
Night on this.
You know, she, I hate to say this and of course I've been picking on him a lot
and people are going to be upset about that.
Well, I'm just telling you the way I see it.
She looks like a mess for a woman who's worth a billion.
No, seriously, she always looks like she just fell out of the sack.
She's worth a billion.
She's worth a billion.
What?
You're talking about Carrie's wife, right?
No, Edwards wife looks like his mother.
Right.
She looks like she's old enough to be his mother.
She looks, he's 15-year-old, maybe let's talk about 35.
She is old enough to be his mother.
Is she really?
She's really old.
She looks about 20 years younger than she actually is.
Are you, are you, are you sure?
Not.
Yeah.
She's like 80.
But Carrie's wife, man, she looks like, um, uh, Eva Brown on a bed there.
She looks like I'm not seeing what the bed here do.
Anyway, Portland, Dye Sees to fall for bankruptcy.
This is what it's come to, okay, to try to avoid the responsibilities because it's crumbling
down, it's coming down on them.
The Portland Arts Dye Sees said Tuesday it'll fall for bankruptcy because it can't afford
to pay the potential cost of sex abuse lawsuits becoming the first Roman Catholic Dye Sees in
Nation to see sex court relief.
It put it out last night that Tucson is going to be next year thinking about it too.
The Chapter 11 bankruptcy action planned for Tuesday afternoon was already been done.
Feases the start of a priest abuse civil trial involving the late Reverend Maurice or is that Maurice Graham?
I guess what was on biography of the night?
Maurice Kibb, the Bee Gees.
But they had already done it before Maurice so it's about signing out and got butchered.
I hate that one.
Why can't they update those themselves?
I like that that way.
It's so funny part of this.
I was standing there one day not thinking I would die from being able to make you do do.
I should ever keep making sound of the big back of the Catholic church.
I'm about to cry.
Anyway, the Chapter 11 action freezes the start of a priest abuse civil trial involving the late Reverend Maurice Graham?
It was accused of molesting more than 50 boys in the 1980s Graham and died in 2002.
All right.
Plagueis and Toulas, Utsin Pobbing Graham and Utsin Pobbing have sought a total of more than 160 million dollars.
The Archdiocese and its insurers have already paid more than 53 million to settle more than 130 claims by people who say they were abused by priests.
Dozens of other claims are pending and at the news conference church officials said they could not afford what the plaintiffs are asking.
The pot of gold is pretty much empty right now.
Archbishop John Velazny said who weren't parishioners last year in the letter that the Archdiocese make Michael belly up so to speak.
James Deber, one of the plaintiffs in the law,
soothed have been scheduled to go on trial on Tuesday, vowed that in spite of the announcement we will continue our fight to finally get the Archdiocese to accept the sin of its crimes.
David Slater, not the one in Dave County who keeps running from Aaron expecting us to talk about it.
David Slater, a plaintiffs attorney, said the church was simply trying to avoid the details of the lawsuit coming out in court.
The bishop hasn't begun to touch his pot. He's lying, Slater told reporters. He's touching and he's smoking it. No doubt.
No other U.S. diocese has ever declared bankruptcy. Tom Stilly, the attorney handling the Archdiocese's bankruptcy,
filing also said it was a first-such case, and that other dioceses are considering the same step.
This is the way to get him off the hook for all time's sake.
Or yeah, here it is, diocese of Tucson said last month was considering filing for bankruptcy without pending lawsuits.
Archdiocese of Boston considered bankruptcy, but after the self-cherished real estate worth millions and millions to settle the claims.
In the 1990s, the Archdiocese of Santa Fe, New Mexico, was brought to the Branca bankruptcy, had a borrow from Peri Savings accounts to pay millions of dollars in abuse cases.
Nationwide, abuse cases are known to have cost the church more than $650 million since 1950.
He didn't close to a billion by now. I'm sure I'm going to be in the billions before they're all done.
Here on this Devin Orbital Show last night, they talked about the whole concept of celibacy and how sick it is, and that's why this leads to all this other crack.
Because the whole concept of the Catholic Church that sex is dirty and evil and only for procreation is sick in itself, it's insanity, it's lunacy, madness.
By the way, anybody see the Pope procrating lately? No, recreating. But I hear he's shaking it.
March now, the moon of arms, march now, God, give him a grace, the heart's starting to go. He might take stock in mass, the heart's starting to go. He could be a tear of arms, march now, the heart's starting to go.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh wow
3,2,1, now let's do this

Where
14 million in a five-year-old, if you remember who I'm happy to be, if you remember who
we got the mad dog, if you, he's on today.
Oh, right like that.
We're working day for the mad dog.
And then we got the Humber in Vegas, my close personal friend.
And then we got Marlins on Dec. 630, the pirate set to Marlins at 705.
Marlins are kind of run into a Rocky Road here lately, wouldn't you say?
Mmm, Rocky Road.
And then I do love Rocky Road.
In fact, I'm just inspired, I think.
And in any case, 10 o'clock tonight, that's our schedule.
By the way, Mo, I can't stand you.
Here's the result of the pool so far.
Yeah, Rocky Road.
Now how about a hot flood Sunday on Rocky Road with lots of whipped cream and a couple of
emergency no cheery.
Sprinkle, still forget, sprinkle.
No, man, that's her glam.
Well, what's the most important issue to you in this year's election?
Getting rid of Bush has moved to the top factor and you can say Greg Weed's an idiot.
116.
Oh Greg, it wasn't Greg Metwell.
Seriously, if you could have heard the gnashing and the carrying on by a couple of overpaid,
silly little people who are terrified that they're going to lose their job, who are so
scared of Greg.
You know what reminds me of, remember that Barry Jack asked, I think it was last Thursday?
No.
About how he's still considering putting stern on the area about gold and this.
And to think about what Greg is good as people as long as they're obedient to him or they
don't disobey him.
I mean, what is that?
As long as they don't disobey him, something like a ding dong school to me.
What a line that is.
He's good as people as long as they don't disobey him.
Scurry or Greg.
Getting rid of Bush 119, Iraq 107, Separation of Church in State 44, Freedom of Speech
43, Integrity 31, Healthcare.
God damn it.
I don't give a shmit about anything 28.
Taxes 19, the criminalization of that wacky weed 14, Abbaus 7, Cuba policy only 7.
Ok, but.
Huh.
Game Mirage 4 and affirmative action only 3 because we only got 3 Dark folks out there,
I guess the rest of our waiting for sports to come on.
One of those people going to do July 19 when Romeo, I wouldn't be surprised if Romeo
shows up on another, uh, what was that 14, uh, Carl Foster show?
An adaptation?
Or else did they get a put that crap?
So this idea that we need another sports station on the air, Fox 94, nice job there,
PD Bolder.
Bring them all on.
Ok, Al Franken and Scott from Al.
And what do we like?
Here's a fact that says from Mike, you're correct, Edwards wife looks like his mom.
I hope it brings him the same luck it brought the last guy with a similar situation, Bush
1.
There you go, that's a good point, Martha Washington.
Bush 1's, uh, my wife is on the dollar bill.
Oh, although I will say this, you know, Judy Dean, she and her doctor Judy Dean.
Secretary of State, Colin Powell is on Capitol Hill.
Good, that's a good place for him.
Maybe he's eating some chicken on the hill with Will, will it really stardial?
God, I think I'm going to play that tape.
I'm going to play the whole thing while I take this morning when the deaf and clear, I wish
I would have taped it from the beginning.
The audience would have been peeling their pants.
You and I also would have been, her stock would have been going up like crazy, saw him
depends.
Even though her king would have been hard pressed to find extras, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I mean, just gnashing and carrying on, talking about beating a dead horse or in this
case, you know, whatever.
Over and over and over again.
I mean, just, it's not a big deal.
Okay, it's not the end of the world.
It pissed me off because Skippy's in it and calls up Jeff Cohen who wants to send 15
pepperoni pieces to put up my mother's caskets or something.
I don't know what that's all about.
Jeff, your intentions are good, but get lost.
Stay in the hell away.
Okay.
Great.
Nobody there who wants to know pepperoni pieces, including my rich aunt who can't even
finish him with Donald's 39 cent hamburger because they're so big.
And because she's so cheap.
5, 6, 7, 0 if I see it's interesting that when somebody dies like this, a family situation,
things that you haven't been saying for years that you held back to try to like keep a certain
amount of peace in the family, you no longer are compelled to do that.
Right.
What's the purpose?
You don't have to appease anybody anymore for a fear that there might be some kind
of a blow up.
You'll be pleased to know that the scab is off of my upper lip now.
It's a little awkward.
Yeah, but it, but now it leaves kind of like a, like a mushy thing up there.
Well, you didn't pick it up too early.
No, did you?
I, it fell off.
I didn't pick it off.
It came off on my tongue.
Oh, that's bad.
That's what anyway.
And the thing about my knee, I don't, I'm a little, I'm not concerned about it, but to,
to bandage, you're not bandaged because I got those big things, you know, you got that
teen, you got that neo-sport that you're using there?
Holly sport.
I'm not talking about that.
Yeah, you, you know nothing about doctoring.
I thought this was your inner expertise.
Sure.
Yeah, but I'm not there.
I can't see what your knee looks like.
Well, it looks like a scraped knee that's like, like, a little bit.
And the, the, the thing is healing around the edges, the scab.
Don't bandage it.
No, no.
But the area is smack it.
Absolutely.
Scab, okay.
It'll be fine.
And every now and then, like, drains a little bit.
No, you don't want that extra bonus.
In fact, if I can get my boil going, huh?
Right.
Wow, I could be squirted all over the place.
Okay, say pictures.
Dominic Q.A. and Hello.
Yeah, Neil, there's no Marling game today.
That's Reverend Jones.
Dominic Q.A. and Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
All right.
It's a job from Columbia, South Carolina, trying to relax in Hollywood Florida.
Oh, my God.
What are you doing that for, John?
That's an oxymoron.
Oh, wait a minute.
Did you say you're in Hollywood, Florida?
Yeah.
Dominic, you got to go to my mother's funeral on Sunday.
Well, that's why I call.
I've been listening to this all morning.
And that's down here.
I think anything ever come up about Euthanasia or something.
Because there's a lot of people riding around.
I'll be good to have some people that go to Thailand to find Euthanasia.
Well, but it could be certain that time for a lot of these people down here for certain
ages.
You just discovered that, huh?
Yeah, and it's killing me.
But also, I want more questions for you.
Have you ever seen any six slide commercials?
Sure.
Okay.
Was that you before you gave all the weight?
Yeah, that's me.
Okay, nice.
Okay.
I guess it's a no material, John.
Have a great time.
Get back to South Carolina where you belong with a banjo on your thing.
5'6, 7'0, 5'60.
Tom 5'60 on a AT&T in Hawaii's Marvellous Line.
Tom Bridges say, don't be panicky.
But there is a tax.
Maybe they're planning.
They hype you.
We don't know what it is.
But I would be sure.
And it's got a lot of money.
And we don't know what's going on.
Keep everybody on edge.
Now, the bad news is that George went in South Carolina in 11.
Right?
Didn't like it.
Why is that bad news?
I said I didn't like it.
Well, I mean, pretty close.
I mean, you did nothing but critique it.
Well, because the good parts were obvious.
Yeah.
Not worth mentioning.
Well, I mean, did you expect it to be perfect?
Did you expect?
I mean, I saw myself there.
I thought that about 2'3 and way through, there were a few minutes when it seemed to drag
and you know, I'm not sure.
I mean, you can go to see any movie in a matter.
Even the Godfather, you can find something to critique.
Although, I have no idea what that would be.
That would be either.
Huh?
No.
Why?
I didn't like what he said.
I said that was like a little melodramatic kind of stuff.
I thought that a lot.
Did you?
Yeah.
You cannot do like a man.
I cannot do.
No!
So what didn't you like about the Fahrenheit 9-11?
Now that they're still still in the theaters, they're putting it in more theaters than
every before.
It's in 33 theaters here in the GTA and the greater Toronto area.
It's all over the place.
Everybody is talking about it.
I told you, I didn't like the time that they spent on some things as opposed to the short
amount of time that they spent on other things.
That's all.
It's a very nitpicky little complaint.
Other than that, I thought it was something.
Well, you mentioned to me the thing about the document, James R. Bass, the document about
the novel and things like that.
Like, so far they flew right through.
I don't know.
It seemed to me that they showed it again when they finished making the point of who he
was and what he was doing.
And that's just the impression I got in like what you're doing.
I noticed anybody that watches that movie, all the tracks lead back to Saudi Arabia, the
redheads, all the tracks lead right back to it.
That was a great montage there.
The spotly, happy, shiny, happy people montage with the Saudis.
Good montage.
Is Ralph Rennich still on that show?
No, I don't know.
But I do like saying montage.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.
There used to be a show on channel 4, I thought.
I do remember doing it.
I do remember.
Montage with Ralph Rennich.
I think we still did that.
I've been waiting.
He's the boy then.
We're not mourning that.
He lived a long life and he was a very old kind of a...
As long as I'm shopping at Wendy's, he's one day.
They have still be reads.
About Ralph Rennich, yeah.
I'm wearing black.
How many QA and hello?
Hello.
Yes sir.
I'd like to speak to Neil.
Speaking.
Oh Neil.
Yes ma'am.
Okay.
I'm just listening to you.
Want to pardon?
I should go ahead.
Okay.
Totally agree with your whole philosophy on your mom.
I did the same thing because the same kind of flag.
I haven't had any flag yet but I'm sure I'm going to get some or maybe a little bit.
But I don't really care.
Neither but I have to tell you.
I went this morning, dropped my white rich Republican fiance who you know.
Rick Shaw.
At the airport, put him on a plane when over to see Carrie and Edward.
It was number 10 in line at 730 in the morning.
It's a lot.
I am not.
I'm not safe.
It got in there like 930 into a hangar by 1030.
They said he's coming at noon.
I had to leave from heat frustration.
What is that all about?
You have to make it easier for us.
But didn't you enjoy being outside and swallowing the smoke from those fires in the Everglades?
Of course.
Of course.
And the equivalent is North to charge.
Okay.
Keep working home on the voting day.
Okay.
Election day.
Oh you bet.
You bet.
You bet.
The show is there today too.
Who?
Joyce.
Martin for Senators.
Oh Peter Joyce.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was there with his mom.
I thought you were talking about Carrie's life again.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
I mean like that.
So Rick Shaw has got a fiancee which he's a good guy.
It just that he's politically confused like several of the people who work on this radio system.

Oh my god.
Okay, this is only a matter that I speak.
I'm a real animal.
I'm a real animal.
This means that I put this in my eye for a small depth.
Well, seeing here is everything that would be an English and French on a container, an
every box and it is ridiculous.
Seals, water, dirt and bacteria, clean the dry, I just did what this is clean, and I would
soak though, I got a wash, wash cloth.
Okay, and I cleaned off all that excess polysporin, you know.
You got a spray in there?
Now I'm going to spray it now, maybe you'll be able to hear it.
Let me just, right?
Right on the other side.
You think it's going to sting?
No.
Now we can hope.
It didn't sting at all.
A little tiny, but now.
Give it a good, a good, a good, a good, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,
give it a nice, good thick layer on there.
And it says let it be, okay?
And then if it stays on for three to ten, eight falls off naturally, it falls off before
the whole year.
Stir it out and it's great again.
It's, that has to be the worst smell and crap.
Almost as bad as that boil.
Oh, man.
Did you ever smell that stuff?
Boil stuff?
No, the, uh, spray on bandage stuff.
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's thank you.
You don't want like nail polish or you ever smell it?
But I like it though.
I'm a huffer.
Oh, geez.
Ooh, man.
Let me take a look at it.
Well, that's a beautiful thing.
Maybe I ought to take a picture.
5607-0560-050560 on the AT&T Improiser Wireless Line.
Let's take a look.
I'm making less come back here.
My lip, the blue, raw, and my knees are looking beautiful.
What's the most important issue to you in this year's election?
We got 552 votes.
Getting rid of Bush 186, Iraq 119, Freedom of Speech 45, Separation of Church in State
45.
I don't give a shmit about anything 35.
Healthcare 32, Integrity 32, Taxes 21, Declinization of Pots, Declinization of
Mexico 266, Abortion 7, Cuba Polesii 7, gay marriage 4, and Affirmator Action
3.
Only few people'll be hearing about that.
W-Q-A-M Hello.
ハライン Talka Nhu.
SPICHING
Hey Neil, how are you doing?
Pretty good.
Listen, just saw the 9.011 last night.
I wouldn't have been to tell you in the last few weeks I had to say about it.
But you take all the right wingers out there.
They want a nitpick of diss爆 in that爆.
It'd give that off.
So let's say a 50% of aduntry which I don't believe.
But just look at the man for God's sakes.
Is that the biggest empty headed buffoon and you want him leading the free world?
This guy is mindless.
There's nothing going on up top.
Absolutely.
And I thought the movie was excellent.
I didn't really have it really drag much.
I'm really glad to see it.
I think this weekend I'm going to be at least in the next few days.
I left with a profound feeling of deep depression when I left that movie.
And anger.
Yeah, anger, depression.
But I thought it was extremely well done.
I like the little music he put in here and there.
I thought he did a really good job on the play.
You don't like the way they say it Tennessee.
Fool me once, shame on you.
Yeah.
You can't be fooled again.
Oh, I was surprised with that.
That was absolutely priceless.
I hear they moan about little things.
He didn't wait around for that senator telling me how to mess you in the arm.
He was serving over in a row.
The things that they're nitpicking about.
The fact that they're nitpicking are joke.
On a whole, I think it was about 95, 99 percent factual.
And it just had a profound impact on me.
I recommend it to everybody.
Hey, man, I'm with a pair of buddies.
You didn't have any aid in an impeccifth.
Loved it.
So I started out.
I thought it was sensation.
I loved it.
But I liked the nitpick.
The audience here gave it a sitting ovation because we're very polite here, eh?
We don't like getting too carried away, eh?
But the audience was really into it.
And it was like that.
I got an oven-goation in the adventure.
Of course, because that's America for you.
Maybe plus Florida.
See, if the people in Florida aren't pissed off and fired up right now, they never will be.
They never will be.
They stole the last election right there in front of your nose, okay?
And if any more of you Jews and pop beat folk from Buchanan, we're going to find out where you are
and come and take away your halava.
How do you like that?
The next poem we're going to like,
I'm going to like, pee on your homitage and just to get even with you if you make that mistake again.
So don't be doing it.
Man.
567-0560.
Count 560 on an AT&C.
Let me take a look at my knee again.
Go for it.
Okay, the knee is under the counter here, you know?
Right, I understand.
Maybe if I just...
How about this?
How do I sound?
Ah!
It looks so fine.
The liquid may have you ever used that stuff?
Uh-huh.
Have you really?
Now put that to spray on kind.
No, the spray on kind.
Oh, have you?
It's great stuff and it stinks.
And actually on my left knee, which I also skinned just a little bit, there's got like a, like a little superficial one.
And like a thing to us, a scrape too.
The same thing.
Have I already...
Huh?
It'll not all but I've already got the liquid bandage on that and it's doing wonders.
It's just the other one is so damn big.
I didn't...
I tried it and then I don't think it really like that took.
It didn't stick.
No, it didn't take.
Don't you understand?
Like if it's too wet and gooey, uh...
Well, that's another story.
F-duffle, F-duffle, Groyo picture.
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T of Horizon Line.
WQA and Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, how are you doing, man?
Okay, man.
Yeah, I just wanted to know that every specialty is a scumbag.
Lovely.
And I went out good?
Yeah.
That was great.
Woo, we, man.
What are your people, I think, too?
My name is Ukrainian.
Ukrainian.
Uh-huh.
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T of Horizon.
Wireless line as we talk to the intelligentsia here on this grade two, day July the 6th.
A day or two after the birthday of America?
I have to be very honest since I'm like letting it all hang out here today about relatives and
people.
I'm just a little twinkle of what it used to be.
I'm just a faint little bulb.
It used to be a big shining light.
And now it's like a little tiny light bulb.
I like that 14-hundreds station.
WQA and Hello.
Hey, Bill and Uncle Neil.
Pretty good.
Really got me in the movie was that super woman who was confronting Lila when she was by the tent.
Where was your son?
Right.
And she had the...
Oh, I should have a great day.
He's so chronic right here.
I always had to be very careful.
I always stay chronic when he calls and he just...
You're a good guy.
I like you.
I appreciate you.
Everything that you said, but I can't handle it.
I won't do that.
It's like this morning I hear Geldie going over.
But I'm like, get back to John and wine and I'll let people wait and I hold that.
I thought, one, here we go again.
See, if we had...
If our programming people were more involved in what's on the year than worrying about my mother's funeral arrangements
and worrying about trying to cover up for Gregory being a jerk, then maybe we could like get somewhere.
Why did they let them keep putting that in the cell in Lila Vanna on the year?
Why did they do that?
Then who would this have to?
Oh, no, they didn't have colors.
They got the sports nerds.
They call all the shows all day, you know, around the clock.
Same ones.
But to this guy here, the minute you hear the word, well, nothing I can say, get through this guy.
We love you, okay?
We like you.
We wish you nothing, but 200 years of great health and a...
But go away.
That's all.
Give it a rest for a few months.
Man.
Don't you know that voice?
I do.
Oh, God.
It's either his voice or the aroma of that liquid bandage that make me swoon or the fact I'm making Greg's name.
Don't fall down again.
WQA and hello.
Hi.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to speak with Neil, please.
Speaking.
Hi, Neil.
This is Laura.
Hi, Laura.
And I've been listening to you for many many years.
And I'd like to let you know that originally from Cuba.
But I'm American.
Right.
And I'm totally against all these right wing Cubans that are driving me crazy, including my own relatives.
Oh, brother.
That are so pro-bush.
And I just want to say that I really enjoyed the movie as far as the facts that were brought forth.
But I too left this kind of depressed.
Oh, yeah.
So I just hope that they just let this comi-foldic attitude that they all have and let it go, you know.
Well, and it looks like, you know, they're not going to be a solidly behind bushes.
They were at least, even if they don't go for curing, maybe a whole bunch of most stay home this time.
That's for sure.
And I'm in Brown County.
I'm trying to make a difference up here.
So just wanted to let you know that I'm with you.
I really want to show.
Thanks, Laura.
You ready?
You can't continue with all the previous little recordings that you used to put in the past.
I really do.
Yeah.
Well, we can't say crap anymore, but at least we can still take one.
Have a great day, Laura.
Absolutely.
Adios, a ribbon arch.
Bye.
Ciao.
Oh, well, top.
You're probably talking tomorrow.
All right, either.

In fact, if we're going to get Al Franken, maybe we're going to get...
What?
On a real South Florida stage, and what do you think of that?
Hey, I'd listen.
No, you wouldn't.
I would.
You would.
No, I would.
You would.
You have nothing but contempt and scorn for the goddess.
How can you say that?
That's personal.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Oh.
That's a mention ancient history.
Yeah, I'm over it.
Are you really?
Sure.
Why not?
Well, at least you admitted in her case, I'm not sure if you would have probably heard anything.
You were just...
What?
Randy, you're a family.
Hello, Randy.
What?
Are you lifting to lead?
No.
She did what?
How to feud with a friend of mine.
That's not like...
Who said, Annamaria?
Right.
Because Annamaria wouldn't put out.
Well, I listen.
Well?
I hear...
Didn't she split up with Jim or...
I don't know.
I'm not following.
I think so.
Somebody on it.
Where there has been with his attract-covered penis.
28 past noon at 5.60 W.A.M.
I'm not following you.
I'm here to support 20 O'Files.
You see?
You A.M.
I stand in front of you now.
Two years later and say, it took me a little while.
A little slow learner.
But Neil, I apologize.
It's way, Neil.
You are the truth.
It's down to you.
And I'm the big O.
But that stands for orgasm.
No, that's just short for Orlando Blue.
You don't look, Julie.
No.
No.
No.
No, Neil's gonna rip me for four hours.
I've been asked to keep distance.
Please, confidence.
But in case you're wondering why we're here.

The five years in federal prison for plotting to set fire to abortion
for churches, and he disagreed with and gave bars in Fort Lauderdale.
Stephen John Jority, who was turned into my world lives in church members,
received a minimum sentence after the US District Judge James Cohen decided
not to treat him as a terrorist as prosecutors had requested.
They had asked for a sentence of seven to ten years.
Jority, a former army ranger and father of four-hulu,
then a trailer parked in coconut creek,
pleaded guilty to a single pound of attempted arson in February to attempted arson
with an abortion clinic in exchange for prosecutors dropping charges of spreading
explosive information and possessing an unregistered firearm.
And speaking of that, by the way, don't forget to take your three packs of matches on your next plane trip.
It's a lighters.
The FBI's joint terrorism task force investigated Jority for three months last summer
and fall after receiving tips from concerned relatives.
The prosecutor's court papers include an excerpt to conversations secretly recorded by
an informant posing as a former police officer with strong views against abortion and gays.
The informant approached Jority in mid-August at a church in Pompeo Beach.
Jority told the informant he was willing to put my own life and family's life at risk to save an unborn baby.
Oh no! Not one of those.
Not even like the sentence, the five years in federal prison,
I don't keep my circulation for a little while.
Not long ago. Slept not a risk a little bit.
The top general at the North American Aerospace Defense Command
was on the telephone and prepared to order an F-16 fighter to shoot down an unidentified plan that turned out to be carrying the governor of Kentucky.
The former president Ronald Reagan's funeral last month, according to two federal security officials,
reads separately about the incident.
You'll be pleased to know that the liquid bandage is fine. The only problem is that when you bend your knee now, the cracks.
It's like pulling against it.
You know what I mean? Yeah, I do.
Oh, so quit banding in New York, am I right?
The tense incident in June 9th ended after the twin-engine Beach Grab King Air carrying governor Ernie Fleischer Republican.
Turned the line to Reagan National Airport.
But the close call caused officials to re-assess safeguards for the Earth Space around Washington,
prompted close to expand the no-fly zone beyond its current 16-mile radius.
Well, I say, 13.
13.
Although many planes have violated restrictions imposed after the 9-level attacks,
the June 9th episode was extraordinary because the aircraft penetrated so deeply into the no-fly zone during a high security event,
and remained unidentified to wear defense officials for several critical minutes.
Current and former Homeland Security officials said the incident was a significantly significant security breakdown.
Oh, not it again.
The episode described by some officials as the closest the government's come to the downing of the civilian plane over Washington since 9-11
will be distributed to two hearings on Capitol Hill today.
Civil aviation officials are testified before a House of Committee on Aviation
and military officials have been invited to a classified briefing before the House of Armed Services and Homeland Security committees.
Even without the communications breakdowns involved in Governor Fletcher's flight,
serious questions remain about the adequacy of our air defense system,
so that representatives Jim Furner of Texas,
ranking Democrat on the House of Homeland Security,
does the existing no-fly zone around our nation's Capitol gives sufficient time to intercept a terrorist control flight he asked?
And of course the answer is...
Who knows?
Thank God that Dick Cheney knew that two of those planes have been shot down by us on 9-11.
Remember that?
Sure.
You might say he doesn't know...
Crap.
5-6-7-0-5-60,
pound 5-60 on the AT&T and horizon wireless lines.
So now that George Tena was spore through his eye,
a few of his eyes out of there, you know this is all going back to the CIA.
They knew they had no weapons over there,
they just didn't tell Bush about it.
Anybody believe in that?
No.
How you know it?
Somebody cue Am, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing, Am?
Pretty good, sir.
I love to bitch you play with a moe and gelly thing.
But...
No!
Yeah.
Nothing is ever going to equal that call that he took when a guy asked him about the doctor for Felix Am.
Oh yeah, I'm going to play that.
That's great, man.
I mean, the guy he tried to dignify it.
Yeah.
He was stupid instead of having it.
Well, not an uptight silly old fart, man.
Exactly.
Just because he's got a crappy hair piece,
whether that's his or his word problem, you know.
How you got it, man?
Good to hear you back.
Thanks.
Say the doctor that performed the surgery on Jay Feele's thumb.
It doesn't need the same doctor that performed the procedure on your two pay.
Just to doctor who performed the surgery, let's take about that.
What's his name?
Clyde?
Felix Doctor?
Yeah.
I don't know who he was.
He was George Colwell?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure where he went.
Where he went.
I'm not sure where he went.
Did you go to Holy Cross?
I didn't read it.
Not sure.
Well, bottom line is that the doctors can't tell how long Jay is going to be out.
No, you're not sure.
Somewhere at least a month could be up to eight weeks.
Someone, I'll be on the wall with you on the way.
I'm going to play it again.
I want you to listen to it when he asked Gelly the question.
And when Gelly comes back and blurs,
yes, because he can't keep his great-fake courtlet.
But that may have been the beginning of the end between that pair.
The doctor that performed the surgery on Jay P. Listump,
didn't he the same doctor that performed the procedure on your two pay?
The doctor who performed the surgery, let's think about that.
What's his name?
Clyde?
Felix Doctor?
I don't know.
I don't know who he was.
He was George Colwell?
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure where he went.
Did you go to Holy Cross?
I didn't read it.
Not sure.
Well, bottom line is that the doctors can't tell how long Jay is going to be out.
No, you're not sure.
Somewhere at least a month could be up to eight weeks.
Somewhere in there.
While he on the wall with you on QAM.
See, so as much as I enjoy picking on Gelly because he's a silly, squeaky voice,
the pipspring, I think really is.
The fact of the matter is that nobody, sooner or later,
you knew that was going to blow up right there, the Gelly and the Mow thing.
I mean, Mow in the Beast, Mow in Joe Rose, Mow in Hank, Mow in Me, Mow in Joe, Mow in George, Mow in Mojo.
And he's just thinking, and of course it'll be the big deal.
Now, if they're really serious about keeping him on air,
let me look at Lexiwis schedule.
So happy if we got Mow in next week.
I'm going to pee my pants right now all over that nice bandage on my knee.
Monday, also in other words, Mow is on vacation.
Oh, no.
So we got all, we got like five, six, seven days in a row of Gelly all by himself.
Oh, man.
Talk about shrill.
He's on vacation?
Right.
That's on this morning.
Who Mow?
Yeah.
He wasn't on the air this morning.
What was he doing in there?
He was in here.
And they were doing what?
I don't know.
Millen about.
Walking around.
Mow and Howard, David, yeah.
What's it with somebody who looks just like him?
Well, yeah, I heard Gelly with my own three years and it says on a schedule this morning, Gelly.
Wow.
And Gelly, huh?
Maybe it was yesterday, doesn't it?
Yeah, yes.
What was on you?
So you better get with it, Mr.
because I'm telling you between your bandage advice on my knee and your Alzheimer's.
Yeah.
You need some medical attention right away.
Maybe duct can give you a hand.
Right.
So anyway, Gelly tomorrow and then all next week, oh brother, all I can say is,
Oh my god.
Please, we miss you, Mow already.
We can't stand you, but we miss you.
Now, what was I looking for?
I was looking at it and Gelly and Russ.
So in other words, Gelly doesn't, does it alone?
When Mow is on, for whatever reason they feel it, it's necessary to have somebody underholding his hand.
So it's the big one for somebody, you know?
But when Gelly is on here five days, Gelly's solo.
Because you can be damn sure that Russ ain't going to be doing like no verbal intercourse with Gelly or any other kind.
Why not?
The rid of it, it's just ridiculous.
The thought of it is ludicrous.
Russ is going to be doing the updates, not the co-hosting.
So you got Gelly's solo.
Somebody as well just take off a couple weeks.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
05, 60 on a 18 and 10 horizon wireless line.
Fat boy lost 20 pounds.
Hi, Appali.
Got his paste paper maker, a maker of Prank Along.
We lost 20 pounds if before he said,
Hi, Appali.
He even said that this morning and they slightly lower register, I think.
A little bit.
Well, you know, when you got all that excess weight squeezing all your private, you know,
and your body parts, it kind of like, in fact, maybe that's Gelly's product.
Because we understand he's carrying a very heavy load is what I'm hearing.
19 to 1 a QA.
And with the heat of summer here, now's the great time to get out of that car you've been driving in and get into a new Toyota
from Armstrong Toyota, homestead, or maybe like my mother's car.
She got a nice Toyota that she enjoyed for years that I paid for.
On US 1, just 20 minutes south of the 836, they're worth to drive the same youth thousands on new Toyota.
With rising gas prices, maybe like the car with more fuel economy.
The legendary Toyota Corolla can be yours for just 11, 990, or you can lease it for just 209 a month.
Need a great Toyota for that college or high school graduate?
How about the Toyota Echo?
Please price it just $199.
Need a truck?
The V6 Toyota Tember regular can can be yours for just $239 a month.
At Armstrong Toyota homestead, these folks had a best of the business with you.
Love shopping for cars there.
Their service department has opened late to late.
We've nice to make sure your service work is done.
No games, no BS, just honest, goodness, great deals.
And Armstrong Toyota homestead was the first dealer to offer you free tires and batteries for life.
And now they're the first to offer you free replacement parts for life that is absolutely correct.
Tires, batteries, and free parts for life.
So if you want an honest, goodness, great deal.
This is the place you ought to be heading.
Talk to David Rich to GM at Armstrong Toyota homestead today for an unbeatable deal.
Grab a little and save a lot on your new Toyota only at Armstrong Toyota of homestead.
I'm glad you're here, my name is Louis.
This is your 20-year-old feisty.
You're the two way, yeah.
The best of the best is the stress.
From stress as we better watch out, the worst of the worst is the serious warning.
The government says we prove this.
And I'm sick.
This ain't not it, but when now, not to see a big red-sized joy, yeah.
I think there are hopes that you give me a stroll.
I think that I just wouldn't know it yet.
Live my life.
Enjoy the ride.
Live my life.
I can't advise.
Care it.
Love, baby.
Oh.
Go 46, it's by mistake.
Don't forget Tom Red says this is nothing specific.
It's just based on general wanting to create a lot of paranoia.
And don't get all panicking.
I will be falling, but we don't know where and when and how and any of these things are just there.
And don't forget, between November and September, that life perhaps going to happen.
You know, they keep talking about this October surprise thing.
Yeah.
This crowd of neo-Nazis are so desperate to hang on to the testicles of government.
I wouldn't put anything past them.
There is nothing I don't think that they would stop short of doing because it's the biggest bunch of crooks and grave robbers ever in effect that nearly half of the electorate says,
oh yeah, we like what's going on now.
Tent to be out of your mind.
You have to be illudic.
You have to be certifiable.
God.
But then again, I would say probably half of the electorate is number than the box of rocks.
So what do you expect?
What's the most important issue to you in this year's election we asked?
And even though we put it on there very late, look at that.
637 votes.
Getting rid of Bush's zoom to the top like wildfire.
Oh!
248.
It ain't even no contest.
Iraq.
126.
Separation of church in state 50.
Freedom of speech.
45.
Well, that's ancient history.
I don't give a shmit about anything 37.
Health care 34.
Integrity 32.
Taxes 26.
Decriminalization of pot 16.
Abortion 7.
Cuba policy 7.
Game marriages 6.
And affirmative action.
Only 3.
Be saying that one.
Out of 637.
There is an Edwards in Kerry.
I mean, where are you headed?
Listen, so many wounds on himself in national security.
It's not the same election it was several months ago.
It's advantageous or not newly as great on national security.
And they can win by focusing on domestic economic issues.
That's that Peter Vinear achieves it with a new republic.
I see.
I love this one line in this.
See, what did we ever do before the Internet?
A lot of work, a lot of paper.
A lot of needless crap like for example, maybe I would have gone to like the emergency clinic or a volunteer doctor.
I mean, this is just a scrape.
We've all had these many times.
But a lot of people would go running to a doctor and you'd look on the air.
It says, a scab is like putting a big rock on a lawn.
Okay.
Well, isn't that a great line?
Sure.
Learn something new.
Right.
So the idea that you know, let the air heal it out and all of a sudden, the lonely.
Most wound care is a first aid revolution.
Not just something new and maybe interesting.
A rubber-freaking illusion.
Agenaut the long-held belief that broken skin heals best when safely hidden under an old-fashioned scab.
Oh, we got a few of those working in our place.
Keep them moist.
Yeah.
Just lick them.
Spray them.
In fact, I'm going to bring a cannabis next time I'm done.
I'm going to bring a giant extra economy size, a jar of cannabis and spray it.
A scab is like putting a big rock on a lawn.
It says, Dr. Adam Singer, who sounds Jewish to me.
And right now, it's like a Jew doctor.
I'll tell you that right now, boys and girls.
Don't ever let no go in and get their hands on me.
In fact, I'd rather check and find out about the doctors in that hospital.
Oh, and I never told you the best part of the deal.
I told you off the ear.
To show you that there are some people I have far too much time on their hands.
I have no life.
Oh, my God.
I don't even want to say who it was or whose mother suggested this because it would be too embarrassing.
Somebody suggested that maybe my mother, since she was afraid that she was reaching me in a reading
and wanting to live no more.
Anyway, the doctors just kind of like the other Dr. Jack of Orkin thing real quietly and out of the...
Oh, man.
Oh, yeah.
It happens all the time.
Sure.
Right.
What do you say?
Is that incredible or what?
Oh, it's incredible.
It's crazy.
Right.
It's one of those things that we'll never really know because none of us were there.
Right.
And she didn't want anybody there for those of us who might say, oh, you should have been there in her bedside.
She was there usual pain in the ass.
Didn't want anybody there and didn't want to really talk to anybody that much.
Although I did call her and I'm wanting to wish her.
I said it's not the probably the way you envisioned it but happy birthday because it was a birthday.
Now, somebody also mentioned to me that people generally or maybe not generally but very often people die on or within a few days of their birthday.
Is that true?
Yeah.
No matter if it's my brother or within a week.
Ah!
How do you like that?
Maybe we might have to delete something in this DCS.
I'm going to take that out.
Yeah.
Not good.
I told you there's many, many reasons why birthdays are not a good thing.
So instead of sending somebody a happy birthday card, which I did, you never got the birthday cards.
Is there an email box?
Maybe God figures.
It's like you're anniversary stuff.
Is that what it is?
That's the time he calls you.
Okay, so you're a time now.
Come on, come on down.
It's like your driver's license expired.
You know, the price is right.
Come on down.
Can you believe that I was thinking of this again?
It's just because I watched you have today a few minutes, although I'm really burned out on it.
The price is right.
Bob Barker has outlived Johnny Olson, Rod Roddy, and I have no idea the name of this new guy that got on there at the announcer on the show.
He's outlived two booth announcers on Ed Schoen.
And he's still on there every day, right?
And every member of the original audience.
I'm sure that can't like me.
No question about that.
I think of that old kid.
Oh, you're in chocolate.
That old KAC audience.
Hello, Neil.
Oh, they're all pushing up daisies, including the guy that said,
Oh, you'll never make it six months in a stout.
Mr. Bit or worse thing I've heard.
He didn't make it six months.
He's dead.
Oh, right.
In fact, you know, sometimes I'm going to go to his visit.
Oh, and somebody also mentioned to me.
Somebody also mentioned to me that when I go to visit my mother's tombstone.
No, no, no.
Can you send me to go and visit my mother's tombstone?
Because with my luck, she'd be shouting at me from under the ground.
You better take a picnic basket.
No, it's what you're all about.
I mean, it was just fine.
I mean, at the risk of sounds, it's outing insensitive because I don't really care what anybody thinks.
It was as fine if you would have written the script.
You know what I'm saying?
Just fine, all the way around.
And then of course, there's also the other element of when somebody dies.
And that is that the, the vultures have been kind of like circling over waiting for whatever little crumbs there might be in the will.
Those people, of course, also are involved.
You understand what I'm saying without getting to his specific?
There you go.
56670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon.
Wireless lines.
As a matter of fact, I think I can honestly say,
I really believe this from this moment forward, I really have no need ever.
I'm trying to think, I don't want to leave any, I mean, I'm not saying that all my reloads are bad people,
but I don't think I really have any need to communicate with any relative, any more from my hair doll to time they stick my ass in the ground.
How do you like that?
What a load off.
Yeah.
I'm trying to think of maybe there might be some reason, but I don't think so.
WQA and hello.
Any other questions?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm here.
Oh, man.
Joe.
Well, sure, we're doing good.
OK, not glad to have you back, Schmuck.
We're doing Joe's boyfriend.
WQA and hello.
We're in a good mood.
WQA and hello.
Police.
No, they're all, well, see they've been waiting for me to come back for a day.
I'll be on Tuesdays and Thursdays by the way, July and August.
George Monday Wednesday and Friday.
So I won't be out again for the Tuesdays.
See, that's a great part of the schedule is every, every time Thursday comes around.
I mean, Tuesdays not too great because then you've got to work two out of three days.
That's the pain in the ass.
I mean, one day of between.
Right.
But Thursday, then I got a four-day weekend every week for a couple of months.
I score a grade.
I always love you, Greg.
You're one of my favorite people.
Do you believe me, huh?
No.
And especially instance here, all of that crap, because everybody knows.
Greg needs you, right?
So this pain, sympathy, you know, this pain concern.
Oh, no, he was very sincere.
Yeah.
Got put on it.
I don't know.
OK, you're really getting on my nerves big time.
You and your boyfriend, Clarence, are you all right?
And let me also say this.
Was it two weeks ago when Clarence was on vacation?
I don't remember.
My vacation kind of screwed things up.
Oh, well, maybe it was why you were out.
And Clarence was also on vacation that week.
And Doc said, oh boy, it sure is great to be in charge again.
Cut, cut.
Catch the needle, there.
Yeah.
He was loving it because he actually had some authority.
As opposed to just walking around petting people on the head, saying everything OK?
OK.
WQA, hello.
Not there in line four.
Shame on you.
WQA, hello.
Two words, Uncle Neil.
Bandar Bush.
Yeah.
OK, Bandar Bush.
WQA, hello.
Fuck you.
Now that could have been from the sales department, you think?
Or maybe that was one of those rollercoasters that we were just talking about.
5.670560, pound 560 on the AT&T of Verizon Wireless Law, Mandogga Law, and Lloyd Loin.
Mandogga, too.
The hopper is in Vegas at 4 p.m. is guts out.
Let me say it again.
Those people are against gambling and the slots of the tracks.
You people are out of your mind.
You're crazy people.
Absolutely crazy.
We need those slots in there at the top of the park at Yostream at Calder tomorrow if not sooner.
Absolutely positively.
And you suckers out there that keep playing the lottery.
See, the lottery is good, but slots are the evil one-armed bandits that suck the money out of your wallet, you know?
Right.
Good to see you understand the difference.
Right.
Well, I've been taught by Mickey Ererson and the hero of the Sun Central and the people in the Bahamas.
And all day of this special interest, who of course want to keep gambling out.
And in the meantime, who was telling me?
Oh, maybe I was a rumor or a favorite.
Somebody would tell me about how they're just, everybody tells me they're just pouring into that.
New hard rock, the Indian Seminole everybody.
Because you know, I told you.
Everybody in their brother, and of course the older one by where my mother used to live, in Hollywood.
They're just pouring into there.
Because otherwise, you know, it's 140 degrees in the shade.
You can't even go outside because you're going to pass out from the smell of the fires in the Everglades.
People are looking for a little...
Act so on.
There you go.
I know it comes in a great shock especially in a place where they're at home and they're walking dead.
That's what people are looking for a little bit of...
Act so on.
Right.
So this business of, oh, it's evil and sinful.
We don't need anymore gambling.
Right.
That's a problem.
You got a bunch of Yahoo's, Bible, Fruits and Old Farts.
And the Old Farts I should put out, do you know what I think?
If it gets on a ballot?
Yeah.
The Old Farts are more into the, like those poker machines that they have now, you know, in the casino.
Right.
That's becoming very popular.
So now that it's their own thing, so it's their time, it's their own thing.
Now they might just hop right on it.
I'm not a fucking local man.
We're just for video-ficings and shooting.
You am.
Not just the one to two hour.
It's a phenomenon.
And another thing.
The rules are going to be a little bit of a big star by now.
I'm sure we've got little bits of sweet voice.
I didn't think they'd get anywhere a little cute.
You didn't feel bad.
I don't know if we should do that.
I think I did this.
I didn't feel bad when it was.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what that is.
You are next to me.
You're simply too good, so fine.
Alright, that's enough.
102 is 560 WQI on Happy Tuesday, too.
Here's a fact from Tau2 who says the movie is great.
Fair night 9-11.
While I've always thought it was stupid to applaud a movie screen, I had to join in with
the rest of my soul about theater and having sure no less at the end of this one.
Maybe he was there when you were there. Maybe.
Could be. It says the right wingers are apple-plectic about the lies in the movie and
so am I. And the second half of the movie, Clips of Coddy and Tolin and Rummy,
pre-9-11, standing quite clearly that a rack is not a threat, is contained and is no
WMD, liars with several extra mission points.
You've got it, God, if I'm his on it.
Here's the Zogby poll, the new one.
Carry Edwards, 48%, Bois Cheney, 46%, undecided, 5%.
Now, what have they got here with a native in it?
Oh, no. You're going to puke when you see the island.
Bois 45, oh, I see, Bois 45, carry 47, native to and 5 on the side of,
natives of votes are dropping. And if we get closer to the November, fewer and fewer people are going to waste their vote again,
especially in Florida or else, or else we don't want to make any threats, but if you vote for natives,
you might have an accident, you know what I mean?
God. In the blue states, oh, they got this broken down by the blue, now here's an interesting thing.
When asked if President Bush deserves to be reelected, 43% of likely voters said yes,
while 53% said it's time for someone new.
Now, how come that doesn't juggle the number of candidates that haven't had the Democratic Convention yet?
Wait till I put the conventions over and they get a big goose.
And nobody don't like a big goose. Look at this, I just got a facts here on some central air conditioning.
You get the, no certainly, you get to add facts.
All the time. It's illegal.
Report it to your state attorney.
God. I better call the inspector generally. See what's going on here.
Now, I just, my knee is just, it's a beautiful thing. You feel, I put it like I'm my arm different places,
but when it's on your knee like that, where you have like a joint copyright, you bend it first then straight.
Oh no, you're not listening to me. And when you bend your knee now, that's, you're spritzed on there and it's dried.
It feels like you actually have a bandage on it. Oh cool.
You know, the beautiful. I'm stretching it. WQA and hello.
Hey Neil. Yes sir. Happy Thursday.
And back to you. Oh, and I keep saying it's Tuesday, don't I?
All day long, I mean, you're the first one to correct me on that and including George.
See, it is a Thursday. I remember the right schedule on here and nothing.
I don't know what I'm talking about. That's all right now.
Because I'm a source call to God. I'm sorry. Who is that important call you got in midnight?
That I got to the injury anyway. A friend of mine who is a concern.
You see, it's a long story, but he had, he woke up also and found his light blinking on his phone.
And a lot of people are there and my, it was from the day before.
So he thought it was from me on that day and then to where I had some kind of a problem.
So he was doing it out of being concerned that maybe I had some kind of a problem or something.
I have an accident and he was calling to see if I was okay and then lo and behold, I go staggering into the,
and just like it was like having a car accident really was that much of an impact.
Very ironic, isn't it? I can't, I can't remember the crawling out of bed part and skidding in the knee part.
But I can remember the, my teeth hitting the end of that dining room table.
But it was five minutes ago. I mean, it was a major impact. Like somebody hit you in the face with a baseball bat.
I am an athlete. Yeah, me too.
I just wanted to congratulate you like another caller and having your mom around for as much of your life as you had her.
Right. He's not a good way to look at it.
Very much is my wife, my, excuse me, my mother passed away before I was 30.
So it's kind of a bum raps for me.
Right. And anybody who gets to have that much of their life with their, with their parents around, I think that's a good thing.
Sure.
And as far as I just want to chime in real quick on the brilliance of Tom Ridge, he does spend the money well for Homeland Security.
I just passed a trailer with a 40-foot scarab boat on the back.
And across the side it's at Homeland Security.
All right. Have a good day, Neil.
Okay. Be safe, Pally.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, we're safe now. We got good old Tom Ridge. You're up there, man. Got a bunch of relying neo Nazis.
All of this stuff now about who's got this and who's got what?
In the Eastern States, carry Edwards 52% bush-chaining 30th.
This is, this is where it's spent in a minute on.
Okay. This is Audrey Pulle, which he's one of those redheads.
In the blue states, got it? Got it.
Those one by Goran 2000, carry Edwards has 50% bush-chaining 42% in the red, but listen to this.
In the red states, bush-chaining 50% carry Edwards 45%.
So it's like a little closer in those red states.
I really do believe they might, uh, with some help from Bubba.
They might be able to win Arkansas. I think it may be Louisiana.
Not North Carolina, they didn't gonna happen with it without it. It was in gonna happen.
Are you sure?
Let me see it again. Okay. Not gonna happen.
Now, are you sure in the east carry Edwards 52% bush-chaining 38% in the central grade lakes 47 to 45 for carry?
In the south, bush-chaining leads, this is interesting 50 to 47 and in the western region 50 to 44%.
Keep in mind, western includes like Colorado and New Mexico and Idaho and Wyoming and Montana, all of those things.
See, west of the Mississippi, Kansas, probably Oklahoma.
Maybe that's, I don't know.
In terms of ODA ideology, carry Edwards is favored over bush-chaining among progressive 77 to 21%.
Liberals 83 to 10%, moderate with 59 to 34.
Among conservatives, bush-chaining 76 to 19% over carry.
Now, among younger voters 18 to 29, carry Edwards 59% bush-chaining 37.
All right. 65 and over carry 49, bush 46. Women carry 52, bush-chaining 42.
Single people carry Edwards 62%, bush-chaining 26%. Did you follow that?
Wow.
Bush is favored among voters 50 to 64 years of age 49 to 46%.
Men 50 to 43%, which is a lot closer than last poll I heard, and married couples 53 to 42%.
56% over half say they disapprove of Bush's job performance in regard to the one Iraq, a 15-point drop within the last six months.
15-point drop.
More than two, more than two in five, 45% for a 44% rate of performance as positive.
In other words, his numbers are dropper like Iraq.
You like that?
A lot of five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound, five, 60, on AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
People are going to be highly motivated.
If anybody thinks that the Fahrenheit and I love a movie isn't going to motivate people, they're dreaming.
They're dreaming because when people go out of a movie theater, plotting and carrying on and cheering,
talking to everybody else about it, you better bet your life on it.
And they're saying, well, you know, among independents, 10% are were impressed by Edwards being on it.
Well, guess what? 10% is a hell of a big deal.
Sure.
W.Q.A. and Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I cannot believe that 56% of the men on this planet don't like bush.
No, not on this planet.
Yeah, okay, great.
Not on this planet, America, but he's trying to be fun.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound, five, 60, what else in Gage World after all?
You know what?
Tom five, 60 on AT&T and Verizon wireless line, right?
W.Q.A. and Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
Show us things.
Okay, thanks.
Let's see if we got Mandogga to and Campland, of course, it was not a wrong date before you never corrected me.
It's going to not be an attention.
No, that's what the said.
It's for the big seven and the Curtis intended nights.
So we got to like all over the place.
And I've been saying I'll see again if Duff and Clarez were more interested in worrying about getting stuff right.
They'd have been rushing in there saying, hey, what they is the on, what planet is the on, you know?
A tension band.
But of course, now the two of them, they're both so intimidated, they're like cowering in the corner like a couple of little chowin.

Here we go today we system an improvement in research.
Now here we przykład all the tests, all the tests, all the tests, all the tests, all the tests, all the tests, now here we birth.
And now here we przykład all the tests, now here we:]
With this response just for both EUO and the EUO and the EUO and the EUO and the EUO and the EUO and the EUO and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and the EU and all the best.
The White House is going to prevent a war to protect the U.S. government's newly acquired
rights to spy on readers as part of counterterrorism investigations, promising to beat away
multi-billion dollar spending bill if these powers are curtailed.
The shot across the ball was fired yesterday.
Ahead of a widely anticipated amendment by representative Bernie Sanders, they would
prevent FBI and other government agents from using a secret federal intelligence court
to gain access to the reading records of library or bookstore patrons as part of counterterrorism
probes.
We try to introduce it on the House floor today, Joel Barkens spokesman for the Independent
Lawmaker to the AFP.
If passed, the measure would be attached to nearly a $40 million dollar appropriations
bill funding the Department of Commerce, Justice and State in fiscal 2005, but the White
House will have none of it.
Moving to nifty idea in the bud, the presidential office of management and budget made clear would
rather see the whole appropriations bill die than allow changes to the USA Payton Act.
How do you like that?
Really pathetic.
So, better be watching.
Well, post you'd be buying and what you read in the library, stuff like that.
Of course, I don't think most of our people spend too much time in the library, which
my brief, they have free videos.
Just like that fact we got from that lady before, Catherine, about talking to the people
and up back where she works and her co-workers were going, woo, like that.
What do you expect?
We're going to people we've had in the last hour and this phone here about, I'm about
1%, about 80.
Maybe about 30, man.
Yeah, let's see an income in tape it.
There you go.
Let's have C-span and CNN and all the ships at C-coming in and tape your first vacations
comments about the affairs of the world, okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, there you go.
Or maybe just chamba.
That might not be a bad one.
Get that on 630 and then rather.
What's the most important issue in this year's free criminal action we asked?
We got 739 votes.
That ain't too shabby.
Getting rid of Bush 314.
That was not even on there for the first 40, 50 hours we were on today.
And all of a sudden it went zooming by the other categories like they were in a prone position.
Getting rid of Bush 314.
Iraq 139.
Separation of church in state 54.
Are you crazy religious notes out there that long when pose your furry tails and everybody
else?
Freedom of speech 51, which forget about that.
It's history.
I don't give a shmit about anything 38.
You know something I don't blame you.
Health care 36, integrity 33, taxes 31.
The criminalization of that wacky weed 19, Cuba policy 7, Game Mirrored 7, Abbaus 7,
and affirmative action out of 739.
Bush has got only three votes.
Oh my God.
For affirmative action probably because most of us don't believe in affirmative action
anyway right negative.
They might have something to do with it.
WQAM hello.
Meal.
Yes sir.
Happy Thursday WQAM hello.
The famous words of President Bush.
Okay WQAM hello.
Hello.
Yes sir.
Gordon.
Gordon.
Is this Gordon Lightfoot?
Yeah I want it.
How's it going A. Gordon?
Neil, real quickly.
I mean the only issue that would make any sense for me in the next year's election is
getting those guys out of Iraq.
No?
Well that's why Iraq is on there.
Iraq is a whole Iraq situation right.
Bring everybody home in one piece who's still in one piece and who's still alive.
Neil something really bothers me right now.
What happened?
And next this radio station and the guys that do the, all the guys that do the, do the
games for all these teams.
I mean when you take a look, what kind of station stands for nothing?
Go ahead.
The station stands for you and me.
We're going to have a good show tonight.
There you go.
You've got Joseph Gackie who does the hurricane game.
He cares about the guy who sucks okay?
Okay.
Yeah.
You've got that fatso who does the games for the heat.
He's terrible.
No one knows his name.
We don't have the heat games on his safety.
I've got this thing.
All right.
Then you talk about the hockey guys.
No, this is hockey.
Yeah.
You've got the guy on for the, you've got more out.
He does the golfing games.
He's trying to get everyone fired in the radio station.
Right.
He is a guy.
He's a giant tour in our midst.
Yes.
And I can't, and the worst guy I've all around.
I don't know how this guy, this guy, what the pictures of Greg Reader or Paul V.
Well, they're going around a bunch of pictures.
Everybody's down.
Yeah.
I've just got Dave Van Horn.
I mean, you know, get him up right Dave Van Boring.
How do they want this happen?
Let me give you Greg's answer, okay?
That's where he's answered.
You know, there's a guy, you know, and I hate to say is that because the moral of the
games are so boring, I do turn to another radio station.
There's a guy on there who's got an interesting stick to him.
And he goes off from about 60 in the evening.
And I think you could bring a certain dynamic to the radio station.
Or listen to Joe Rose every day talking about athletes and the girlfriends.
No one listens from 5 to 8.
Who is he you're talking about?
Siddhartha.
Shoroshan Dharana.
What?
What about him?
I think he's pretty, I think the stations should take a look at him.
I want to listen to him and then Orlando Al the query.
Oh, you know something.
I even know who you're talking about.
And I couldn't agree with you more.
Have a great day, Phallic.
What about your head?
There's a guy complaining about our award winning lineup.
How do you like that?
Greg income too happy about that, sir.
Greg Reed is going to be pissed off and fared up.
Greg needs you.
Right.
And the feeling Greg is mutual, okay?
Just contempt.
Other contempt in this regard.
Just leave us alone.
Quick, try to muscle in and pretend you like part of the family.
Mine, Georgia's, Josh's, anybody else's, okay?
Just get your own family.
Go find a new one.
5.670, 5.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon.
Wireless line.
Probably a big part of the early, the first half of the show was geared toward like an
inside view.
You know what I mean?
Right.
I'll bet that that.
That's okay.
In other words, ordinarily even if I do inside material, I'm still doing a show for the
audience.
Today I'm doing a show for the inside of radio station and also anybody else who might
be involved.
Some of the peripheral stars in the Hussophooper going on.
The side of my friends, Jeff Cohen and Fat Rich.
I'll tell you one thing.
If you wanted to spread some news, okay?
You wanted to save money on advertising.
Just sell Fat Rich.
Within 30 minutes or less, the entire planet, everybody in China, people on your ring
is full no, okay?
I apologize.
An addition to which I, what do I know from Fat Rich?
He's my race track buddy, okay?
People to go to the track.
They almost always go with the same people.
Okay.
For years in here, I used to go to the Thurberides with Bill Calder when I was in Michigan.
I had a couple of friends who go to the track with all the time.
It's a track thing.
I thought it was best friend thinks.
I don't know any more about Fat Rich.
In fact, I probably know less about Fat Rich or Geraldine, whatever he's called himself
this week, than you do.
You know what I mean?
I don't know anything about him.
I'm going to go to the track for them for 25 years.
I know less about that man.
I mean, he's a good guy.
We have a good time.
He's a never-stolen freight car.
I don't think.
Maybe he did steal a freight train.
I don't know.
I thought it was at your bar, mixed up.
Our friend Derek that goes to the track with us.
He's a good guy, but what do I know about him?
Well, I know a couple of things.
He likes that restaurant one way before.
Oh, right.
The last thing he said to me before I left town last time was...
It leaves a good technique in all this.
He's a good guy.
What do I know about him?
They're just racetrack buddies.
That's all.
But for some people to be open up a mountain, I think Fat Rich deals mother-deck with something
that really is going to pay a wicked price in hell for that.
I don't know who did that.
I don't know.
Look, don't fool a definitely.
I'm definitely a clearance routine.
I'm not going to cry.
I apologize.
I apologize.
I apologize.
But it's just a good guy.
That's why I feel bad.
It never even dawned on me when he called me to give me his condolences where he found out.
I called him later on.
And then he tells me that he got it from you.
And the information too.
And then Jeff Cohen gets it from Skippy.
And Rimmer gets it from Jeff Cohen.
It's like a Daisy chain, man.
That's what it's all about.
Is there no respect?
Is there no privacy, no decency, no sense of like leave people alone in their time of marginal emotions?
WQM, hello.
Yeah, why me if it's a joke to George?
He's the one I carry that show.
He didn't have the old man.
All right.
Oh, God.
That's your boyfriend and Kendall.
WQM, hello.
Good afternoon.
Yes sir.
Good afternoon sir.
Sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
You know, a lot of people out there do care and I hope you understand it.
Well, I think I'm welcome.
They sure aren't calling.
I'll tell you that.
But that's okay because I guess boring.
It's more exciting to hear these other guys.
You're too intimidating, that's why.
That must be it.
Listen to a discussion that worked the other day and one would show a colleague that would disagree.
It needs you to help be the final harbiter.
And that is, but as between say, Scarface and the Godfather, which movie would you prefer in terms of showing realisted gangster criminal life?
Not high-high-motifly Godfather, but...
Absolutely.
No question about even close.
Well, this guy...
And let me remind you one thing.
Guy, punk, guy, we'll never get that movie.
I don't care how many take-off, get-a-watt, grease ball, gun bar, come out on a woodware.
I'm German Irish.
Let me tell you something, my crud, mixed friend.
I'm going to make so much trouble for you, you'll want to win.
It was coming lower.
I have not threatened.
I know almost every big wire renewing off.
Who the hell are you?
There you go.
And I'm not no band leader.
No, I told them.
I told them that.
And I think the thing with George Mayhven or even on this one, because he thinks Scarface was more of an action movie.
I think you know, I think it was a comedy movie.
Oh, yeah, if George keeps taking polls on those freaking action movies already, he's taking that same poll.
How many times does that one?
Oh, my God, what is action movies in action?
I never said that one night.
He's trying to be Mr. Cool, he's trying to relate to the teenagers after the 15 and 20-year-old little group.
I just make it up.
Well, because you're whining now and you're getting angry, but it didn't last night.
Well, you're thinking that George, you carry this show.
Yeah, never before you refer to Scarface as anything but a comedy.
Right, there you go.
And have a great day, I guess.
That's not what you want to hear.
He was getting a call, was he?
Well, you relax.
No.
He was a good guy, you're not getting a score.
Oh, he was fine.
I hate him.
I'm going to go find him.
Oh, man.
You're right.
George carries the show.
That's why he's going to be on again tomorrow.
I'm going to be on again on Monday.
And next Wednesday, next Friday, I miss carry the show.
And if my lip happens to separate again, maybe like from not all two o'clock would be good.
So we can hear some more about the national movies.
I don't care what point.
Do you think I really care all the way?
I do vote on.
I'm sorry to see what the results are on here, but what do I care when?
I don't care if you go like, no, no, no, no, for four hours.
As long as I don't have to be there and I didn't pay, what do I care?
You can't worry what I was going to do tomorrow.
Yeah, well, you know, something out.
Four hours of Greg Reads.
Sorry.
That's my face.
I'm getting punished now.
I'm getting punished.
No, that's not what I try.
I was trying to play.
I was trying to play Greg Reads' comment to it.
Yeah.
Because no matter what you say to Greg, it's always...
Yeah.
And then he sticks his finger when that hole was in his head.
Or they thought that was once a brain.
27 after 1 at 5, 60.

Everything is going too well, okay?
You want to mess around with Joe Rose.

You want to keep messing around.

Shuffling them back.
Just leave everybody alone, okay?
Just go on out of the one of your long bustments holidays.
Get out of our face.
Greg.

27 or 2 a.m. Don't forget...
July 19, that's two weeks from this past Monday, right?
How the hell do I know what day it is?
July 19, new format on 940 Fox Sports.
That's the rumor of Al Franken Air America.
Maybe for Ralph, who's in Atlanta on the FM that's got no numbers at all?
You got to get a certain party and still can't find an audience.
Look, that'd be something, huh?
They're going to come out after us with all 10 barrels blazing, maybe.
That's what we couldn't give a crap less.
Just keep the paychecks coming, Karen.
It says all we care about.
Especially Josh and George are making the big bucks.
Threat positive.
Here's a fact that jazz last week, while Dave Dan Voring was gone for three or four days,
a guy named Bill Beck, no relation to Todd Dreck,
or the people who make Beck's beer, did the game.
He was great.
Every call was Jack Buckleike.
Like it was the world series, he was sincere.
He even embarrassed the Boogmeister.
Who is this guy?
Where does he do games?
It says maybe it was two weeks ago.
I'm sure Josh Court is right there.
Can tell us.
He works for the Marlins.
Don't know exactly what he does, but I know that.
Does he handle Josh Beckett's personal situation?
That's his personal situation.
I don't need to know.
I see.
Well, you know what he used to say, Bill, Beck, everywhere he looked, there's a guy with his hand up.
So, and now is he good?
Yeah, he's a good guy.
No, I'm not talking about a good guy.
I don't want to put you on a spot, because I guess you had to work with this guy too.
Right in the course, you work with Dave Dan Voring, and so if you say this guy is too good,
then Dave Dan Voring's good at all, but I'll bend out of shape and start throwing his hairpiece at you,
and not let you grab all over his life anymore.
So what's the deal?
He's just fine.
Who Dave?
No, Dave's good.
Bill Beck's just fine.
Dave is good.
Dave Dan Voring is good.
Oh my god.
Wow, this is unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.
Oh.
Josh Cordes says Dave Dan Voring is good.
24th Hill, I understand.
We don't want to get in a lot of trouble.
I'll gild you on the other hand.
I can't wait to let.
And then if there's no other reason, of course it'd be boring for us hockey fans with no hockey season.
But if there's no other reason, we want to get gildy doing it, don't we?
We just can't wait here.
It's going to be great.
You know who that is, don't you?
That's Rick Peckham.
Can I say that?
No.
Rick Peckham.
He's the voice of the world champion, the Stanley Cup champion, Tampa Bay Lightning.
So I've been working on Rick Peckham's weekly bracket of all party fighters.
Not gild, but I just get really good.
There you go.
So it'll be through.
I don't think Rick Peckham is good.
He's not one of the best.
I wouldn't say that.
But he's certainly very good.
He's solid.
Gildy ain't going to be no Rick Peckham.
He ain't going to be no jugs, Motownley, Hall of Flamer.
So what do you think, Josh?
You think Gildy's going to do a hell of a job on those games?
I don't know if you're not a hockey fan.
So I saved you.
I mean, I might listen to that now.
To what?
There's that.
You probably better go.
You know, it would be good.
In fact, you know, for the right price, Gildy, we can supply it with somebody's broker-brien
and sounders and you can make like, yeah, he can press a button and like, he'll inject some of these
just by some of his broad canceling.
I'll give Gildy here easy.
Here's one for the slap shot.
You mean like the one I got in my mouth?
Man.
But the gurus is during the course of the show that they scab is like, it's like gone.
After I hit that table, man, my upper lip was like a piece of hamburger meat.
Yeah.
Correct.
I ran in the kitchen put a little mustard on it.
I wouldn't do bad.
560, 750, 560, £560 on the AT&T and for a far-ra horizon line, environment line.
Right.
I can't believe it stirred it.
I've been seeing it was too the old thing and giving it a wrong schedule.
Nobody cares.
Everybody's out of town.
Anybody would have liked out of town.
Come here and give it a go.
I knew it.
Show me.
I'm the mad dog show.
Oh, man.
I told you we get all the good calls on this one day.
I knew it.
Make up for Tuesday.
WQA and hello.
Hi, sorry for your loss.
I'm okay.
Thanks, Mike.
Get lost.
He called in.
I think you were on vacation or was it last week?
I don't know.
What's the information about Phil?
Henry's going off at WIWD and putting his Sean Hannity on.
Of course, Phil's going on-tended.
You just didn't see the schedule right.
You better take a better look at it next time.
You think it's a whole schedule.
Sean Hannity is going to be 7-10 in your close personal friend, Phil.
I'm waiting.
Are you sure he's going to be on a 10 on IOD?
They weren't promoting all the other station schedules.
We can't get a wrong schedule right.
So why not promote theirs?
The one station that doesn't fear to promote the other station schedules,
because we know that in spite of our management, in spite of all our deficiencies,
we still kick serious ass.
Don't ask us how.
Magic.
We're still doing it.
Here's a fact that says condolences regarding your mother.
Thank you.
I took an early lunch today and attended the Curie Edwards rally inside the airplane hangar.
Big mistake.
I wanted to share some of my observations with you.
Great.
Arrived at the parking lot around 10.30 in the AM, which placed the learn to parking fee was going to be comped.
Walked up to the building, saw a long line of anxious, overheated people.
Luckily, I knew someone who had arrived earlier.
She told me to go to the front of the line because the longer line was for bag search and security screening.
I guess there were screening-y old bags.
As I waited my turn outside the two airports style metal detectors they had set up,
I noticed many people from different security agencies.
Sheriff's Orifice, Secret Service, Airport Security, Vom Squad, Homeland Security Personnel.
The volunteers were instructing the people to open their bags, take off any pins they were wearing, and step forward.
At about 10.50 the people in charge of screening said, move everybody through, even though they're going to move everybody through,
they're going to be getting off the plane, and I'm on my share with you.
Move everybody through, they're going to be getting off the plane, they get everyone in.
Hundreds of people went into the event unchecked.
Do you understand the sentence?
So everybody through, they're going to be getting off the plane, they get everyone in.
There's a word missing, I guess.
Vom's here, we're passing out Bob and Water, the crowd carrying an Edward's start for the podium few minutes before 11.
Bill Nelson, Kendrick Make, Edwards and Carrie took to the microphone.
First now informed Carrie that thousands of people were standing outside the hangar couldn't give them the event.
Not true, there was plenty of Roman-Tradahly press podium.
It was disheartening to see people walking out while Carrie was speaking.
He's a bit coma-inducing.
I will support these two lawyers, but I long for the days of Dean and that awe-inspiring screen.
How well-fed, you know?
I'm trying to stop too late, baby.
Dean Edwards, it sounds like a winner to me, you know?
Yeah.
Sounds like it's the deal.
We're going to South Carolina, and Oklahoma, and Arizona, and North Dakota, and New Mexico.
We're going to California, and Texas, and New York.
We're going to South Dakota, and Oregon, and Washington, and Michigan.
And then we're going to Washington, and East Virginia, and take back the White House!
Yeah!
And we're going to North Dakota.
And we're supporting you, Faisis.
We're going to South Dakota.
We're going to South Dakota.
And this is T-Gordon Lydia, and they don't come anywhere, so they're in the middle of Rogers.
Oh, I know.
Who are you, Melanie?
I'm a beautiful needle, by the way.
It's a double-sea.
Oh, my little pimp, call me Jack-o-oh!
What are you in for?
I was not learning a sheetpeh.
I've been for the lefty thousands of young boys, but I'm rich, so my time's in the middle of me.
I go back again.
How did you go today?
Well, I was learning at Cardboard Race, and at her craft suit, White Man, you said, sure, to with no dying.
And smart.
Yay.
I have a squirrel colleges, Suiji.
I want to see how it goes to get some rest again.
Oh, Nika's also very Chaedishes to Visitorizedorus, so I pay A��-i-ay, he's being shot.
Better take out all my Polynesians, gunshots...
They've done a phone job already, you know, much worse than I did.
5 to the goal!
I'm out of the field!
I didn't throw home a tree!
Let go!
Let go!
145 and 560, WQM Mandog at 2.
Sorry about that schedule, myself, aren't I?
No.
No, I'm here. Nobody cares.
My knee will be placed in O.
It's looking beautiful, man.
It's like all, like, solid now underneath that invisible bandage.
Yeah.
It's a lovely thing.
I wish you could take a look at it.
560, 7, 0560 on the website.
560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Look at this tremendous response.
I think we've heard from everybody twice, don't you?
WQM, hello.
Hey, how you doing, Neil?
Pretty good?
Listen, a while back, you were talking about your mom
and the doctor, maybe helped your mom along?
That wasn't my theory.
There was somebody else.
Right, nobody else is there.
I'll tell you what, if the doctor was Indian of Indian descent,
that could very well be possible.
Yeah.
Because they don't believe that the old folks
would be sitting around just sucking up free air all the time.
Well, I got a good point, don't you think?
Yeah, I know.
You think the same way.
That's why I called you.
I've been trying to call you for a last hour.
But you know, exactly.
They believe that once you get to certain ribage, you know,
hey, enough is enough.
I'm not good for them.
I'll see you at 7-0 thing, Neil.
See you, bud.
Bye.
Yeah, they're just packing them in there.
Now, maybe, let's see.
I was running a vacation for sure,
because the beast was trying to give us the straight dope
on the slot machines there.
Oh, even though, of course, you would never play them
because it's a fact thing.
I have.
You were so wrong about that.
I was just following you.
No, you were not.
All right.
You are so, in fact, we ripped you in the ass
while you were on vacation about them.
Always.
But anyway, of course, you carry the choice,
but I better be nice to you.
But seriously, the little slips of the paper
with a barcode, that's the new deal on slot machines.
That's the way they work.
Okay.
All right.
So I guess what they were trying to say is that
wheels don't spin like they do on a regular, like a Vegas,
like most slot machines.
Correct.
They have the computerized, you know,
where reading jumps are mounted, which I hate those.
But nevertheless, it's as close as we can come.
What's not to like?
But like in the new Niagara Falls,
New Casino, they also, they, and the newer Casinos.
In fact, I'm sure in Vegas, in Reno, in the Atlantic city,
everywhere they'll replace the old-fashioned ones.
Who now wants to handle all those coins, right?
Right.
Now, some people would say,
oh, that's happy of Simon.
You know, all the corners are the coins of the baloney.
Hello, Nath.
Right.
You hear the bell go off.
That's good enough, and somebody comes and hands you a 15 hundred bucks.
Yeah, that's good enough.
So you get all that schmutz on your hands.
In addition to which I've always wondered how much of that schmutz,
you know, absorbs inside your system,
from your bloodstream, right?
Is it?
I don't know.
It must be.
Let's say, I mean, that's why we're all dying.
Maybe that's a good ammunition there for the anti-cocino people.
But although we don't have that's why we got rid of the coins.
Just a nice little antiseptic piece of paper.
It's got a bar code on it.
You can either take it to the cashier, they cash you to the scanner.
We want those scanners.
They know how much it's worth, or you're sticking them in another machine.
It can be the credits.
What's not to like?
WQM, hello.
Not there.
WQM, hello.
Hey, you know, I have the summer.
Yeah, back to you.
I have a question, maybe you can help me.
Why does anyone own a hammer?
It beats me.
Man, he no reason.
I mean, it's just the ugliest person I've ever seen.
Hey, man.
Call off the bride.
I'm Jan Silthida.
I guess because he can.
I don't know why I would anybody want one of those scanners.
You know, it's him and one almost drove me off the road yesterday.
Well, what's the purpose of them?
Why would anybody have them?
How long?
Why not?
Why?
For what?
It looks nice.
When you'd rather have like a 2004 Corvette?
No.
No.
You wouldn't rather...
No, that wasn't an offer, George.
That wasn't offering him a car.
I'm just...
As an example, you wouldn't rather have like a 2004 Lamborghini?
Well, yeah.
Oh, so there was a Corvette.
It's a top liver in Lamborghini.
It's like a new Ferrari.
Yeah.
But you'd rather have a Hummer.
Yeah, I like the new Hummers.
But based on what?
I don't know.
Am I...
Am I...
The only knock on it is it doesn't get good gas.
My four-buddy Tom Brady can't even get...
I wonder if he ever did get that Cadillac.
He was really bent out of shape about that.
Of course, he's still, I'm sure, got the one from two years ago.
From the first Super Bowl.
I just mentioned again that Tom Brady and the Patriots
had won a Super Bowl two to the last three years.
And there was a game this year, even though everybody forgot.
Because of who we date.
I just keep mentioning that because nobody else talks about it.
It goes to show you how suppressed and repressed American publicism.
Oh my God, a naked breast!
Now we better repeal the first amendment.
We better stop everybody from saying crap.
You know, what kind of public just sits out there and they take it and they take it.
Whatever crap they threw at you, man, you just sit there.
And you'll laugh it up like it was vanilla ice cream.
So I think we did a little groundbreaking here today.
Josh Curtis is the Bill Vekasso, but he ought to be the number one play by Playboy.
So, the Florida Marlins in Bay Van Borremata
had to live back to Montreal.
Come on, now.
And that was you said?
I heard it.
We all heard it.
You can't take it back now.
In fact, I'm going to play the Duff and Clarence.
I think maybe I'll edit out those one or two words, the thick-chaining word that I've
worded out.
Here's a nice card online, an AOL card from Ken Helper in the limo guy from National Limos,
my good close personal friend Ken.
Just wander with them, I condolences to you for the loss of your mother.
Even though your list is never met your mother, you made her part of your show, which made
her part of our life and dated consumption of you as a friend and a listener from here
for you if you need anything.
Isn't that nice Ken Helper in the limo guy?
Thanks Ken.
You're okay in my book, huh?
Very sweet.
See that, that's the way you do it.
You don't make a big saw in advance, you don't go around calling up this one and that
one sending memos off to sponsors.
I guarantee that Skippy didn't show his face in their day, did he?
Here?
Right.
You just wait until the next time, all you got to is step on that card.
In fact, I've stepped on better than that.
You ruined a couple of good pairs of shoes by the way.
Put your dishes there here, then.
I've got nice new pair here too, that I bought online from what I bought, new balance.
We'll save the old pair for stuff.
Thanks to our friends at Brandy's, by the way, for my beautiful new balance shoes that
are sitting there waiting for me and I also bought a pair online here.
I was serious, I started to say before, how did we ever survive?
You people who are like Hank, I know he's not on the day.
I don't know where he's probably in Vegas, he is in Vegas.
But you funny that he people just keep fighting it off like it's some kind of a revolutionary,
huh?
Unclean.
Yeah, like that, like you're going to catch something from it.
Virus.
Man, oh man, oh man, how could anybody function without the, how did we, I mean it's like television.
I'll see, you're not old enough to know because you never lived without television.
I survived without it.
I was born again in Christian, we didn't have TV in the house, it was double comes into your house through the TV, you know.
You see, and that's what happened here.
But seriously, before the days of TV, we had radio, we had all kinds of great radio shows and used your imagination,
but how the hell did we ever survive without TV?
And it's the same thing without the internet.
I want to see a thing about my, is knee straight, which again, it's not a big deal.
I'm just, you know, making a stick out of it, but, but I look on here, I get some good information.
I spray it and it's, it's doing it.
You know, let's get it looks lovely, right?
No matter what you want to find out in there, right?
Google it.
Just Google it, that's right.
Google it or do it or whatever.
And I don't care what you say about it.
I'm like, my, my, let's say a pop up thing.
I'm not the one that had a problem with it.
Who did?
I'll probably get another.
Well, Eric has a problem with everything, okay?
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.
I'm not.
Because you've got to work with him next couple of shows.
By the way, great job, Eric.
I have that thing about, look at that on the homepage.
On your Rogers.com.
Look at the clever way.
In fact, he's got a color coded the whole deal.
Sorrow schedule.
Monday's George live from Paradise Tuesday,
he's near live from somewhere when this got the whole deal there.
And of course, he's also got the Asterisk, Neil live from somewhere
and out of touch with South Florida.
There you go, Tommy.
Jacob out of touch.
I have no idea what's going on.
I'm sure that Al Franken broadcasting in New York
and for Alvin Atlanta, if he actually is going to come on.
I'm sure they'll be in touch with what's going on.
Not.
Yeah, I'm going to come down there and kick the ass.
I'm going to get you off of here.
See, one of the things I was hearing is that people
that have heard him online in Atlanta
since the new, new stuff came to other new edicts.
And there's no more big rack and big D and big all of it.
It's like listening to milk curdled.
Is what I'm hearing.
But we'll see.
Keep it up, Pete.
Keep shuffling that deck.
Shuffling that deck.
That's what they do the best over there.
It's your channel.
Shuffling the deck.
By the way, don't come running to us when you lose your license.
I just mentioned that in passing as a close personal friend.
Not.
Didn't get a civility card from Pete Bolger.
What's the most important issue in this year's election?
That's our full course today.
855 votes.
Not too bad.
Getting rid of Bush to every 96.
They bounced on that, man.
Iraq 149.
Freedom of speech 56.
Separation of church in state 55.
I don't give a shit about anything 45 health care 39 integrity 36.
You won't find any of that taxes 33 decriminalization of pot 21.
Everything else.
Small potatoes don't forget build back the new bus.
You're Florida.
Marlin starts tomorrow.
Bye bye.
I'm a great.
