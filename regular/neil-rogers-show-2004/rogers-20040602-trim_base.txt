Oh, damn.
How was that bad?
Well, I don't know.

Yeah, we do.
Sure we do.
We want to do like the postman, you know?
Do our rounds to do our appointed duty to do a comrade or snow all of that crap?
No.
No, we're getting out of here, 12.30.
We don't care if they're like tornadoes and all kinds of wicked thunderstorms
and every kind of crap that ever came down to pike, 12.30 we're gone.
Bye-bye.
11.30, we got those trends coming out.
Some very interesting numbers.
You never know.
We're going to be looking at certain numbers in there especially, not so much on QAM, which we think will be okay.
We don't really know, but we think we'll be not great, but maybe...
Okay.
Okay.
But it's certain other stations in the market and certain other personalities that will be examining with a very, very fine tooth comb will be coming through those numbers.
Speaking of that, here's yesterday's pull result.
What was the best movie death scene of all time?
1442 votes, not too bad considering that this was a... this was tough to put together.
A little too complicated maybe.

Nothing like a pull in the shower.

He gets garrited, we should have put on her, but certainly if he could...
I'll give it a little something.

So Jerry, she's on there.
Here's our poll question today.
We don't have a lot of time to screw around
because this unfortunately, I really didn't do this right.
You know what?
I shouldn't have done this today.
Correct.
You shouldn't have.
Well, I did.
Maybe we'll extend it to tomorrow.
Because I'll tell you my choice in this poll
and going to get any votes beside mine.
Right.
Who did you, let me give the poll question.
What celebrity or well-known person
is your all-time sexual fantasy?
And being the old fact that I am
and just I guess coincidentally,
what inspired me to do the poll today was watching Christine
last night came on Scream TV.
Christine with the Keith Gordon
and the very lovely Alexandra Paul, by the way.
Now, how come nobody ever talks about her?
I do.
All the time.
She's hot, man.
She is beautiful.
She played the girlfriend who, unfortunately,
in the end had to get in the thing there.
What was that?
Into the thing that worked?
Okay.
Sure.
Yeah, that was a tractor of forklift.
What was that?
You're into these forklift.
You were in Montaillew.
Who those are thinking?
Well, whatever it was.
She was with John Stockwell.
And John Stockwell was my choice because he's just a fine,
all-American young man.
At least he was back in those days, back in the day.
And we didn't have farming equipment where I was.
We didn't have farming equipment where I was.
He was also in the top gun with Tom Cruise.
He was in losing it.
Yes, he was.
And he was also in my science projects.
John Stockwell.
See, I'm tongue-tied.
I can't even say it.
I'm so excited.
He don't look all that great right now.
He's 43.
He's a writer, director, has some bit parts in movies.
But he was a fine, fine.
He was fine in my mind.
So that's my choice.
And your choice was Jessica Beal.
Jessica Beal?
Yes.
In fact, now that I think about it, maybe I'll vote for Howard Beal.
Jessica Beal, a good choice.
Maybe the Beast would like to toss one in there.
I'd have to go with Brittany.
Brittany Spears.
Well, sooner or later she was going to go on there.
I'm pretty, but she's going to win.
Yeah, she don't need any help from us.
So there's the Beast Choice.
So what celebrity are well-known prisoners?
You're all time sexual fantasy.
We got John Stockwell, Jessica Beal, and Brittany Spears.
So far.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
We don't have a lot of time to screw around to that.
Fierranite 9, 11 is ready to roll.
That's a good news.
Let's start with some really great news today, especially for all us.
Kami Pico liberals, okay?
Kami Pico liberals and Jews and fags and fartses, whatever else.
Okay?
All of us non-right-wing vues-steppers.
Michael Moore's award-winning documentary, Fierranite 9, 11,
has picked up a US distributor.
We'll hit your theaters on June 25th.
All right.
There you go.
That's the good news.
The film will be released by a partnership of Lionsgate Films,
IFC Films, and the Fellowship Adventure Group,
which was formed by Harvey and Bob Weinstein,
specifically to market Moore's film.
The film, which recently won the top prize
that they can film festival,
acquitisizes President Bush's response to say the least
to the 9, 11 terrorist attacks and connects the Bush family
with Osama Bin Laden's, with good old Bandaar Bush.
The Weinstein's who won Miramax Films,
bought the rights to the movie from the Disney company,
which owns Miramax, and refused to distribute Fierranite 9, 11.
The Weinstein brothers will personally finance
and control distribution and marketing they said yesterday.
I'm grateful to them that everyone who wants to see it
will not have a chance to do so more said in the statement
on behalf of my stellar cast, GW Dick Rummy, Kadi, and Wolfie.
We thank this incredible coalition of the willing
for bringing Fierranite 9, 11 to the people.
Disney chief executive, at least he is for the present moment
and we despise him like poison.
I, Snorke!
Michael Eisner said the company did not want to film
in the middle of the political process because he believed
that theme park and entertainment consumers don't look
for us to take sides.
What a convenient excuse.
I, Snorke!
That is.
In the settlement reached last week,
the Weinstein's repaid their parent company for all
cost of the film today estimated at around $6 million.
All profits from the film's distribution
that go to Miramax or Disney, we donated to charity.
They don't want any of that dirty money, you know what I mean?
They don't want to touch it.
Dirty.
And the money, either.
10-13 at 5-60 WDQ-YM nobody wants to talk about
or even think about cancer, heart disease,
all the horrendous diseases that are waiting
to attack out there, especially if you're a shortened fan.
Hopped at any rate is a proven fact that disease
responds extremely well to treatment
if detected early.
That's why enthusiastically recommend, based on my own
personal experience there a few weeks ago,
that you check out the Hollywood Diagnostic Center.
Because they're proud to introduce to you
their virtual colonoscopy, which is so much less
intrusive than the usual of the whole colonoscopy procedure.
They're coronary heartscore and full body screening exams,
which I had both of them done.
They're amazing.
It's like a virtual trip or a retro- your entire body.
And these tests can detect cancer-other life-threatening
diseases in their early stages while it's still in time
to do something about them.
Doctors before they even needed.
For all your imaging exams call Hollywood Diagnostic Center
at 9-5-4-9-66-3600 for the test that can give you
and your family peace of mind and detect anything in time

1018 at 5.60 WDQAM.
And just to prove nothing is perfect this morning, both George and I had the misfortune
of hearing Juan from Little Havana on the Moan Gaudi show.
What timing on my part?
Wow.
This does that came in here and opened up the pot.
And then I had this great designer smoke it.
Because man, oh man, once I heard that crap.
And don't you listen to anybody's experts on this station, all of this inside information.
You know, this place is a zoo.
Don't play it right.
Now the fact of the matter is it was the schedule that Joe was on vacation last week.
But Gaudi wants off of that show bad.
Joe does a lot of money show.
And the battle continues.
Okay.
So no matter what mode tries to put the happy face on, Gaudi hates them like Poison
that wants off of that show.
Pronto, the only problem is he ain't got nowhere to go until hockey season.
If there ever is one.
The way artable.
So it's just basing that information on.
And inside sources that I hear in the building.
Heather Locklear, big Arnie says, now there's a good choice for you.

It was nice to see the young body again.
We were exactly.
Yeah.
Okay, thanks.
Thank you.
I have a great day in this.
Think about it.
I'm sure he is a lot.
Five six seven oh five sixty.
Of course, we're talking about most of these peanut Britney, for example, is like present day and Jessica Beale.
But some of these people who are fantasies like that goes back a little bit.
Doesn't have to be.
Some of you look all that great right now, for example.
Right?
They're grandmother.

They're grandmother and right.
So if she were a hundred, I wouldn't have done it.
There's a WQM.

Boy, why don't you have to do that to me?
Huh?

We don't do any of that crap on these jokes.
We don't do any of that anymore tickets.
Here's another holdover from those sports nerd shows, what they're buying calls, give it away
Marlins, ticket, for the Marlins, then Marlins.
Okay.
Go pay for the tickets.
Our cheap, go get some tickets to the ballpark.
They're plenty available.
I'm sure.
Okay.
For the Saturday news game between your Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds, or is they
used to call them the Red Legs?
Yeah, we went through a period during the...
I bet you didn't know this.
No.
We talked about it before.
Now, seriously, during the Kami Pinto Red, the Kami Bating of the early 50s, they changed
the name, they called them... actually originally the name was, but they stare before them
against the Red Legs as opposed to the Reds because Reds had a bad connotation back in the
day.
See, Ron San?
What do you say?
Now that we've eliminated the Kami Pinto threat, we don't have to worry about communism
anymore, and Joe McCarthy's dead and very long since.
Now we can go back to calm just the plain old Cincinnati Reds.
Got it?
Good.
WQA, I'm Hello.
Oh.

He could be one of the ten of these people in the history of the human race.
Let's see, today's pool, Halley Berry, oh, I see Halley Berry, how can we leave her
off this long?
Pull idea, what are we going to do when you retire?
Great.
Why?
Having retirement party open to the public, I would like to be the MCD, so still ringgill.
The answer is, my new office is getting lost.
The last minute of the last show I'll be racing out of here, running into the street screaming,
I'm free, I'm free, like Martin Luther King, Jr. man, free at last, free at last.
I'm going to run out of this place, real real fast.

Anyway, 26 past 10, Nicole Kidman says somebody, boy, oh, boy, it's signed hard up and highly, and I believe that.

And you agreed with that yesterday, you were going to have a little, whether she's a little skinny,
oh, she's nasty, she's skanky, whatever you say.
Plus, she also saw Tom Cruise naked, okay, so we don't know that perfect.
Well, she thought she did.
Maybe it was just a stunt double, that takes up.
Laura Pupon, oh, Pupon would be my second choice, it says I'm a sucker for redheads.
Laura Pupon, who's that?
They redhead from that 70's show.
Oh, well, I don't watch that show, that's what it's about.
Oh, I bet you somebody is, some fag or somebody's going to say, what's it then?
Kuchi, kuchi, I asked him, Kuchir, aren't they?
Well, wait.
He's kind of cute, see if you look at him from like maybe a hundred yards away.
Wow, what's your bad?
Huh?
If you look at him from like seven buildings over, we're like, we're weak binoculars, he looks so okay.
How much do you think more though?
Who?
Demi Moore, his, uh...
Demi Moore is good choice, that's a magnificent choice.
You'll probably get eight or four or nine of us, maybe ten, huh?
How about Jackal and Bissett?
Well, let's not put them on here unless people, uh, you know, call them in.
This is a different kind of poll, mister.
The question is, what celebrity or well-known person is your all-time sexual fantasy?

Five, thirty men.
Who's your sexual fantasy?
I mean, ultimate.
We just, uh, just love to hop on your bones and just never let loose.
Never turn loose.
Now, if we could turn the clock back.
Ten, twenty-eighth, that's what my clock says.

Armstrong, Toyota of Homestead, was the first dealer to offer your free tires and batteries for life.
And now, they're the first to offer free replacement parts for life.
That's right, tires, batteries, and free parts for life.
Nobody else does that.
So instead of wasting time and gas driving all around to those big hot shot mega dealers,
who give you a big song to dance, scream like crazy and then lie through their teeth,
see our good buddy David Rich, the GM at Armstrong Toyota of Homestead today,
for a real honest and goodness real deal.

The honorable reverend, Jerry Falwell.
My friends, I'm sure that Halliday is a lovely leaguer's in the fine actress,
as well as Chuck Berry with his jungle music.
But friends, I must speak out against the academies embracing them colored folk.
It's my understanding that the buck culture industry is perpetrated by homosexual Jews.
It was them, in fact, Clinton, of course, who brought the tragedy of nine eleven upon us.
God is angered by all who are not in the likeness of myself.
All that's right is Christian and white.
Now pull down your pants with me and pray.
Dear Lord in heaven, help me find my penis.
Thank you.

Marlon's on deck at 1230.
Let's air it.
All right.
And in the reds in the marlins at the PP Park at 105,
you got the Humper at the Belmont after the ballgame.
Then at 7 o'clock tonight proving that nothing is perfect, we got the big...
At the Dolphin banquet, no less.
What's he going to be doing eating?
I don't know.
What is that at the Dolphin banquet?
We are just pathetic and we apologize in advance.
10 o'clock at City K, and then overnight well.
Vanessa William, somebody says, very abruptly, that's good.
Because we don't have a lot of time, so let's build this...
Let's get a city of names on here because not everybody.
But it is going to be difficult.
Not everybody's got the ultimate same sexual fantasy, right?
Although Brittany as expected is shots of the top, so to speak.
Alex says, how about Pam Anderson?
I think he did that just to piss off George.
What?
He can have my poor daughter.
Well, he's sticking back in the day when she looked pretty good.
And you have to admit that there was maybe a moment, maybe a half an hour in her life, right?
Between the ages of 18 and 18 and then he says also the open.
Joe Pesci pen stabbing scene is definitely from Casino, not good fellows.
Oh, thanks Alex, but don't mention that anymore.
Okay, please.
It doesn't sound like he says...
It doesn't sound like he says other people like Pam Anderson.
What?
Anybody can like her as long as I don't have to.
We wish them the best.
Right.
So, Fiya Vergara, absolutely.
What do you mean, absolutely?
It's their fantasy.
I mean, if you want to reinforce it, that's fine.
You want to reinforce a...
Absolutely.
No.
Maxwell, who's a screaming fag, says, from your favorite limey queen, Maxwell from Surfside.
My favorite of all time, sexual fantasy is a local boy who did well.
Adam Stanyans.
Now, there actually is such a person.
Another one of these lifeguard...
Oh, boy.
He has made a number of local films, but struck Peter it in the watermelon chronicles.
Oh, I remember that.
That was my favorite.
The watermelon chronicles back in 1984.
And then it says, wow, what's several exclamation points.
Ta-ta, Maxwell Tots.
See you at the pot.
Five, six, seven, Oh, Chalabi, tip the rant about codes.
We're going to stick some of this stuff in there.
I got to interspersive, even though we're very sure it on time today.
Ahmed Chalabi, real slime bag.
Can we still say that?
I just did.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's the new S-bag word, slime bag.
Former Iraqi exile, who recently lost his standing as a special friend of the Bush administration.
So many special friends, and they're all such wonderful, upstanding people like Kenny Boyle, all about crowd.
Told a rant that the US had broken the code of its intelligence service coin to broadcast and published reports.
CBS News initially reported Tuesday that Chalabi had told an Iranian intelligence official that the United States had cracked its codes allowing US agents to read Iran's secret communications, revealing such information would expose one of the West's most important sources of information about Iran.
How do you like that?
Following the broadcast report in New York Times, LA Times, the Washington Post followed with similar stories, all quoting anonymous US intelligence officials.
So here's a guy who's spying for the much-hated Iranians, which is the whole reason that we backed Sodom in the first place to CIA and Iraq, was to achieve that stalemate of the value of Iran from going crazy there.
All the religious nuts, the Ayatollah, in that part of the world.
And now, the one who'll be holding up to Chalabi, who's Dick Cheney's good post-personal buddy, tipping off the Iranians.
So they cracked your secret code, you better change them.
How do you like that?
I think you ought to be strong right up in fact, I don't tell you where we can send them.
Abu Gharr, Ray, that'll be a good place, huh?
Yeah.
And just turn all those animals loose on them.
Get Lindy back in there.
Right.
Get your girlfriend back in there.
Lindy, from the money.
Should we put her in the poll?
Oh, geez.
Oh.
Anybody who would name Lindy England is their self-imit sexual fantasy desperately needs a long dirt nap, okay?
Or maybe a trip up in a...
Jay says, for my 18 years, I would say,
El McPherson, who is still hot.
Currently, I would say Angelina Jolie.
But if I only give them, well, we can put them both on there.
We know we're easy today.
What do we care?
El McPherson and Angelina Jolie.
Can you handle that?
We got it.
We're out there.
We're working ahead.
These working on it.
And the poll too.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.
Oh, speaking of that, I got to get this story in.
From Stockholm.
A Swedish aid organization will rule out a new line of defense of the country's emergency services next week.
The Condom ambulance.
All right.
This is a true story.
From Friday, June 4th, Amor Scouples can call a telephone number.
6969.
6969.
Ha, ha, ha.
That's the number.
I don't know.
And a white van featuring a large red condom with wings as a logo will deliver them a packet of 10 prophylactics.
Just 69 three times.
Dial it.
That is.
We need to increase the usage of condoms to grow as well.
Marketing manager for the Swedish organization for sex education.
The non-governmental organization behind the initiative.
It's 50% about pregnancy and 50% about sexually transmitted diseases.
The ambulances will operate in Stockholm and the southern cities of Malmo and Gothenburg.
The service aimed at young people run until June 25th, the available between 4.00 and 9.00 at night.
A packet of 10 condoms will cost 50 crowns, which is about $6.72.
Less than the cost on average in the shop.
So that's almost $0.67 a piece.
A bargain.
The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases increasing rapidly in Sweden.
And not enough young people are using condoms as Volts said.
We need to change attitude to condoms, he said.
If we need to get out into the bedrooms to make things better, we'll do that too.
Just kind of like the American way, too.
We're going to sneak our way to the bedrooms or just trying to help you out.

Those trends.
Those important, even though it's just one month, it's just April.
But it's February, March and April, right?
Yeah.
And we'll make something out of it.
Even if there ain't nothing there, we'll just invent something.
We'll make these numbers up today.
We'll lie a lot.
Just very anxious.
We just chatted about that in the tearum.
Anxious about what?
Are you in the tearum with Duff?
Let's head around.
Huh.
You were right next to him?
Right next to him.
I'll be damned.
And what did he have to say?
He was just jumping around.
He was very anxious.
If I were to have the tearum, I saw Duff jumping around.
I would kind of like jump right on out and wait a little bit later on.
Anyway, a radio station suspended its airing of an ad for Black Republican Congressional candidate,
Vernon Robinson, that rails against illegal immigration and signs off in Spanish with the words,
Yo Gringo.
This is in Winston's Salem, North Carolina, your territory, North Carolina.
Yo Gringo.
WSJS, AM, said it made the decision over the holiday because it was unclear if the sponsor was clearly identified in the otherwise English ad,
which contends the prevalence of Spanish spoken in the U.S. can make Americans feel like they're in the twilight zone.
Only the final line is in Spanish in words that translate to Yo Gringo.
This episode of the twilight zone was paid for by Robinson for Congress.
Robinson said Tuesday that the tagline was intended as a way to underscore his message,
but he grudgingly agreed to let the station edit it into English.
The catch phrase, Yo Gringo, at contemptuous Spanish term for Americans, remains.
There's nothing in the regulations that says you can't run an ad in Spanish on a polest radio station said Robinson.
Why did he's considering finding a complaint with the FC and C?
FCC spokesman Rod Royce said he didn't know immediately whether there was a requirement on the language of political ad disclaimers.
WSJS manager Tom Hamlin said other political ads were temporarily suspended on the station until the problem with Robinson's ad was resolved yesterday.
In a statement, Robinson said the flampo over the last line does not change the overall message of the ad to show the importance of securing our borders,
stopping the illegal immigration invasion and making English the official language of the USA.
That's in your neck of the woods like I said, your red neck of the woods Winston Salem North Carolina.
I think you may have a point. Yo, Wingo.
You're the Salem the city. Huh? Winston Salem is a city. No. Yeah.
We don't have any of those in my neck of the world. There's a button for you folks. Winston Salem is a city just like Nina Minesha is a city.
I'll go near any cities in the North Carolina. Oh, I don't blame them, especially up there.

You're my best side pick and boil.
I miss how you talk like a girl.
Gildery, yes, for hold you.
I miss you.
Mad, oh, mo.
That's a good match.
You're my baby.
Oh, mo.
I ain't waiting to smack on a show next to me.
That person, when you have a good time,
why you wait not the unemployment line?
Why you have a middleman call me a problem?
I'll show you the job.
Why you upstairs?
You pillow pants.
Ow, ow, ow.
Number one was 16 bullets this week.
It's 11.04 at 5.60 W.D. Hume.
We don't want to drag the beast in the middle of all that stuff again.
Now that he's mending his fences with mo.
And I actually wind up on that show again.
No, no.
What?
Don't say that.
I thought when I was there, you were telling me about how mo was kissing your ass in the town.
I didn't say from his part.
Kissing and making up and you're like pretty tight now.
No, no, I didn't say that.
You might waddle your way back into that show as soon as Gildy finds something else to do and gets away from there.
And by the way, one from a little of Anna, mo lies like crazy all the time.
Where do you, what sources?
I can't say that enough because he just refuses to admit.
Of course, he isn't an impossible position because no matter who's with him in there, they hate him like poison anyway.
So what's he going to do?
Say, what you're right, Gildy hates me and he's sitting here only because he needs a job of a, you know, what's he going to say?
I think the big O likes a lot though.
The big O, yeah.
Oh, that's something.
The, the, the, the Omo show.
Wow, wow, wow.
One Omo show on his stations enough.
I'm a homo.
Oh, brother, the Mo and O show.
That, the big O.
He is not ready for prime time and never will be by the way.
Please, please cracker, please.
Just keep him there with the adult in banquet.
Keep him occupied.
W.A.M. Hello.
Yes, I'm going for a poll.
Yes, sir.
How about Catherine Zeta Jones?
Catherine Zeta Jones, you got a man.
Thanks very much.
And have a great day.
You got a Catherine Zeta Jones.
You used to be Catherine Zeta Jones and now she's Catherine Zeta Jones for whatever reason.
But that's okay.
Michael Douglas says it's a okay.
Okay.
And in his case, it ought to be okay.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
What celebrity or well-known person is your all-time sexual fantasy?
You see what me, John Stockwell, I picked this somebody and I didn't do it just to be different, you know, like, you know.
But it's not like a big star like anybody can say, back here.
Well, which, you know, be honest, that's okay.
If it happens to be Britney or somebody like that, that's fine.
You see what I'm saying?
Right.
But it could be somebody who's fairly obscure now one of the really well-known big superstars.
But if that's the person that cranks your chain and moat, that's fine.
What's wrong with that?
What's not to like, huh?
And I'm sitting there watching that movie, Christine.
58 Plymouth was it a Plymouth Fury?
Is that what it was?
Yes, it was.
How about a sworn that it was a dodge or disorder?
I mean, they're all Plymouth cars.
But where they're like sworn and I would have been wrong.
Plymouth Fury.
And the Fury of the Plymouth have no way equal.
WDQA and hello.
Yeah, Elizabeth Hurley and Nancy O'Dell.
Okay, you got them, Mon.
Thank you.
See, now they're doing pairs.
They're doing what else is pairs.
Well, that's okay.
We don't really care because you're short on time today.
Anyway, we only really got to 1130 anyway.
And then when a rating star coming in here and dust starts crying like a little child,
you know, and then guilty.
Either with them, too.
The commiserate.
We really don't know.
You never had any idea.
But like I said, it's not so important that we succeed because we're doing pretty well.
It's that certain other people failed big time.
And you probably have an idea of some of the people I'm talking about.
I don't want to tip it off to the audience.
What are you talking about?
Well, I mean, like some of the people we used to work for like Mike Disney,
he'd probably going to go in the tank with a party craft.
That's my opinion.
I'm Mike Disney.
Yeah.
I think the party's over, sweetheart.
I keep telling you that.
You refuse to listen.
And by the way, Cheryl says, well, I can't say it.
She's getting married.
Did I tell you that?
And don't call me anymore, Cheryl.
Have a great life.
I wish you all the best.
And happy birthday in advance.
WDQA and hello.
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Don't forget Nicolette Sheridan.
Nicolette Sheridan, there you go.
How could we forget her?
Okay, thank you.
Don't forget Lathy.
Yeah, that sounds right up your alley.
56670560.560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon Marlow, she would be the first dog that we got on there, right?
We had a few on that list.
WDQA and hello.
New God.
Yes.
How are you doing this order?
Pretty good.
I have to do, I guess.
Good evening.
Thanks for calling.
They're Christina Ricci.
Who was it I couldn't hear it because my fast machines make a lot of noise?
Oh, I apologize.
Christina Ricci.
Christina Ricci, okay.
Thank you.
You got a mind.
She ain't no Joe Ricci from Pomato Park, but she's doing it but she can.
You know, it's nobody said Susan Lucci yet.
Thank goodness.
I guess Freaky Carlos hasn't called in yet.
I don't think anybody, Ray benefits it.
Not being there.
Not having to see that bitch on the way out of there every day.
Oh, boy.
I'm not ready to share whether it's grand that bitch or the bitch at the, uh,
a television bed.
Anyway, here's one from Bob and Telehance.
He says, how about Jenna Jamison?
Now we're talking.
Okay.
And somebody says Jamie Lee Curtis.
Holy moly Jamie Lee Curtis.
But I can see that she's got there.
Some people are some guys that like that kind of Becky, you know, yeah.
You're right.
There are.
Ray.
She's Daky and yet not overly.
Daky like say, you know, Janice Carpenski, you know, who could he be that?
That's a man, baby.
Even Mikey ain't that Daky.
Uh, Ali McBrah.
I'm a grad.
Somebody says she must be about 89.
You know, at least.
And she also was very butch look.
And I thought didn't you think she was kind of macho looking?
I'm Ali McBrah.
She was like more macho looking than Ryan McNeil or any of whatever's name was.
She's still alive.
Yeah.
He keeps popping up in a conversation for some reason.
Nobody's heard from him in ages.
He's dying of some horrible disease.
I believe I read the acquiresome Ryan O'Neil.
What a love story.
And you still can't remember Ray Malayan playing a daddy.
No.
You don't?
No.
Did you see that movie?
No.
You never saw Love Story?
Well, don't.
No horrible.
No chance.
Why?
Love Story.
Oh, little too syrupy.
I see.
What's the point?
Well, it is good is that the toilet one that you keep trying to give me to watch.
It's right.
Toilet spotting.
God almighty.
You didn't even listen to the best part.
Although I hear it was kind of crappy.
WQA and hello.
I have a name for the poll.
Yes, sir.
Go right ahead.
Lay it on us.
Shania Twain.
Shania Twain.
I love Shania Twain.
What's not to like?
Thank you, Shania.
I'm just a gorgeous.
You know, Britney Spears, Brad.
Take Shania any day.
Okay, you got her.
Thank you, Will Center, right over.
She'll be knocking on the door.
Okay.
Just send the Mrs. Down the street for a little something that's 7-11.
For one, then pickle legs.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

Nicole Kidman, 12.
Angelina Jolie, 11.
Sofia Vergara, 11.
Selma Hayax, 10.
Phoebe Cates, 10.

See, I like that, but we can't say Anna Kornakova.
No more because that would help.
People say, oh, would you say, well, Anna Pornakova does good.
Johnny Scott 9.
He's the leading male on there so far.
Linda Carter 8.
Raquel Welch 8.
Alyssa Milano 7.
Elma Kherstin 6.

Good.
Rachel Ward.
Good what?
More for me.
The more for you, just like what I got John Stockwell,
if we can just turn the clock back.
In fact, look at that.
He's right on her ass.
I'll go get the hose.
Oh, there's a few of those on his list.
Rachel Ward 3, Jacqueline Smith 2.
John Stockwell's got a pair.
Sally Strothers 2.
Jessica Alba's got 2.

Ali McGraw, Tug McGraw, Chennai Twainna have none.
Didn't Tug McGraw just die, Beast?
I don't know.
I mean, a few months ago.
What a shame.
He was a guy that actually had a personality.
An athlete with a personality.
Not necessarily a really good one.
He was okay. He was kind of fun.
Right?
Tug McGraw, the old Tugger.
12 minutes after 11.
At 5.60, Q.
And we got the Marlins on deck coming up at 12.30.
But at 11.30, we got those trans coming, baby.
And there are people in that building
and all through the radio industry.
We're carrying a heavy load, as I speak.
My life, and love.
This is 4205 City.
Way and way.
I'm afraid if I could take a tank of pickle pepper
or somebody pickled pepper, it's just either better peck
or go wild, or we got it.
We got the week down, wonder why?
One of them was John Wondering why, baby.
Little Marlin could keep that bread, and it got...
Oh, because like my mom and I have a birthday face.
You could have sung, you could have done it.
Oh, if all matter of opinion, baby.
Who else would you want?
If they love and friends.
We're being all along, John Steven.
It's all yours, my friend.
If I led you off the plane, I'd now go away.
Oh, where am I going?
No, I long John Steven.
It's all you had for your voice.
Maybe you want to shoot myself when the guns please go away.
Oh, that's a little heartful, baby.
Oh, I agree with you, baby.
I'm much taller than playing, and I'm much skinny, and there's a root bang.
And I'll show you his free.
Oh, that's a nice effect.
I won't have to kick him like T.B.
Oh, a violent vibe.
I can't watch next week.
Oh, I hear it.
Without hearing your crawling little shrimp.
I hear knives.
Oh, you're certainly welcome, I'm sure.
Or you ain't kidnap some clock sweat going.
Like a warm breeze over my bare butt dog.
I am out the door.
Oh, I finally do you off the day I'd now go away.
Appreciate the homies, baby.
All the hard work for John Steven.
Oh, long John Steven.
So you had for your voice.
Maybe you want to shoot myself when the guns please go away.
Oh, I find that's a little humorous.
You sure know who will be on the plane.
John Steven's out.
1118 at 560 WDQM Marlins baseball 1230 pregame.
I don't know how to spell Marisa Tormé.
That's obvious from the facts.
It says TORME would do.
But I'll like her biological plug.
She was in a movie that I don't think we can say the name of it on her anymore.
The Tom Green movie.
Oh, yeah, no, we can't even say that.
Can we say it's ready?
No, we can't say that.
Okay, think about it.
Anyway, Nadine says who's just obsessed with Johnny Deppin'
is just from Horse Plains, New Jersey Nadine, the Queen.
She says, what a bummer to have to write and rewrite my letter appropriately.
I can only imagine the hoops that you, Bokobrine and Stavni,
to go through to do the show during this reign of fear and censorship.
What surprises me is how quiet all the local New York City radio personalities
are regarding censorship.
They don't come near the quality of your show.
You're excellent talent or you're sophisticated website.
They suck.
Oops, can I say that Nadine says the answer is no.
For your poor hands down his pants.
Johnny Depp is my love since he was 12.
As I've told you in the past, my daughter Julie's boyfriend in Miramar
is that incestuous who cares.
Anyway, since Johnny's already on a pull, how about Tom Welling, Mr. 14?
And then it says, Daddy can't ain't small potatoes either.
Well, I haven't seen him, but I'm surprised nobody has said that.
Some lady or some Queen.
Well, there you are.
Huh?
They did now.
They did now.
Well, not I'm talking about Tom Welling.
I'm talking about John Schneider from back in the day.
From that awful, awful, awful one of the all-time work shows in history.
So bad that even as good as he looked.
That's what it is and it's true.
But it is on again now.
It's on one of those retro stations that you don't get.
Somebody says, well, we got two here for Beyoncé.
Got that?
Got it down now, Beast?
Arty, all that.
Good.
Van Diesel.
Van Diesel.
Huh?
Van Diesel.
Van Diesel.
I know who it is.
He's been on his zillion of our pulls.
We just relax.
Jesus.
You starting to get like a Marvin the Raw man.
Remember what happened to him?
No.
Van Diesel.
Billy D Williams.
And also Beyoncé.
It's his also Serena Williams as well.
Okay?
All right.
All right.
Somebody says Ellen Nordgren.
Spelled very badly.
Tiger Woods, fiance.
Thank you, Rob.
Put you up on the line.
Spelling.
Charlie stood on.
Well, what's not to like?
So that's good.
We're getting a lot of faxes on this because time is a waste in man.
Look at this.
It's already 1120.
Can you imagine the sounds coming out of the programming office?
That programming orifice is probably a spiel and some out right now.
Sounds that we can't play there anymore.
Craig Unger writes, the great escape in the New York Times.
It's short, but I got to get it in.
Oh, you're going to read something, yeah.
Americans who think the 9-11 commission is going to answer all the crucial questions
about the terrorist attacks are likely to be shortly disappointed, especially if they're interested
in the secret evacuation of Saudis by planes that began just after 9-11.
We knew that 15 out of 19 hijackers were Saudis.
We knew that Osama bin Laden, Saudi was behind 9-11.
Yeah, we didn't conduct a police style investigation of the departing Saudis,
of whom two dozen were members of the bin Laden family.
That is not to say they were complicit in the attacks.
Unfortunately, though, we may never know the real story.
The investigative panel has already concluded that there's no credible evidence
that any chartered flights of Saudi Arabian nationals departed the US
before the reopening of national airspace.
But the real point is that there were still some restrictions on American airspace
when the Saudi flights began.
In addition, new evidence shows that the evacuation involved more than the departure of 142 Saudis
on six charter flights that the commission is still investigating.
According to newly released documents, 160 Saudis left the US on 55 flights
immediately after 9-11, making a total of about 300 people left with the apparent approval
of the Bush administration far more than has been reported before.
The records were released by the Department of Homeland Security in response
to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Judicial Watch,
a conservative nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington.
The vast majority of the newly disclosed flights were commercial airline flights,
not charters, often carrying just two or three Saudi passengers,
originated for more than 20 cities, including Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, and Houston.
One Saudi Arabian Airlines flight left Kennedy Airport September 13th with 46 Saudis.
The next day, another Saudi Arabian Airlines flight left with 13 Saudis.
The panel is indicated that it's yet to find any evidence that the FBI checked
the manifest of departing flights against its terror watch list.
The departures of additional Saudis raised more questions for the panel.
Richard Clark, the former counterterrorism czar, told the Hill newspaper recently
that he took full responsibility for approving some flights,
but we don't know if other Bush administration officials participated in the decision.
The passenger should have been questioned about any links to Osama bin Laden or his financing.
We've long known that some faction in the Saudi elite has helped funnel money to Islam as terrorists,
inadvertently at least.
Prince Ahmed bin Salman, who has been accused of being an intermediary between Al-Qaeda and the House of Saud,
boarded one of the evacuation planes in Kentucky, was he interrogated by the FBI before he left?
If the commission dares to address these issues, it'll undoubtedly be accused of politicizing one of the most important national security investigations in American history and an election you know less.
But if it does not, it risks something far worse to be trailed of the thousands of people who lost their lives that day,
not to mention millions of others who want the truth.
It's written by Craig Unger in the Times today.
He's author of House of Bush House of Saud, which is one of about six months they got piled up in the other room.
And I'm starting to read them like all at the same time.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, a little of this, a little of this.
Yeah, exactly.
You can check it over here, a few pages over there, and it's the only way you can get it done.
Okay, let's take a look at that poll.
Let's take a peek at it.
We only got seven minutes till his numbers start coming out.
Oh, wow.
Just hang on tight, though.
Hang on to Clarence tight.

It's not, you know, you know, I mean, that's okay.
We want it on a stancer.
What's the liberty of your well-known person as your all-time sexual fantasy?
Okay.
Somebody just drives you up the wall, climbing on the wall, screaming, and biting a pillow real hard,
though, I'm sorry.
So now we're going to do this break.
And when we come back, uh-oh.
You notice how quick this creeped up on us here today?
Yeah, like nothing.
These numbers are going to start puking across the fax machine and people are going to start,
and then we're going to do this.
We're going to do this.
We're going to do this.
We're going to do this.
We're going to do this.

Our own LG analytical robot
aliO onlar.
Our own LG analytical robot
Our own LG looking brain formerly
might be something more than this.
We're bound to think that a code
you can't be solved by this one.
We're bound to think that a code you can't be solved by this one.
This is a code you can't be solved by this one.
Money is why.
You've got to have a job.
I feel just like that you are my different.
And one year later, that's why you're still not fired.
Wait, wait.
Alright, that's enough.
1132, 28-to-0 at 560 WDQM, 1230 at Marlins on deck reds at the Marlins at PPP Park at 105.
The Humper from the Bellmout at 4 and then we got the big at 7 o'clock at the night.
Eddie K. After, the Bockel finishes.
I don't see any stuff but puking off the fax machine yet.
No, I ain't got nothing.
Nobody's come rushing in there yet and say, oh guess what?
No.
I'll be damned.
Maybe they're kind of like hovering over the fax machine.
You think?
I'm sure.
Maybe they're just hanging out together.
Clarence and Duff.
Well, we'll see it should be in a minute now.
I got a great brainstorm that is once the number star coming in since it distress me.
Beast hasn't got anything to do with that point except when we do the breaks.
So the Beast will take your calls off the ear right in the end of the world.
What?
What?
I beg your pardon?
I thought that was a spectacular idea.
What's wrong with that?
It's not even hooked up.
I don't think the head's that.
Get out of here.
It's not even hooked up.
We're going to hook you up.
Okay.
Let's see what we got.
The one that Randy left her remark on.
As a matter of fact, why?
Why just today?
Why just today?
What?
Because the Beast happens to be there today.
That's why.
But I think every day the Beast should take all our calls off the ear.
That's the thought?
That's right.
John's got anything to do with that.
He's too busy coming up with ideas how to keep Dave Ann boring,
awake and out of strain out his earpiece.
So, John can't be bothered with that.
Plus, John's still busy trying to figure out how to sabotage Eric
so we can get involved, make some money off that website.
But in the meantime, Beast thank you so much for going on.
I'm very excited.
And I thought it was a good idea because otherwise we'll have a short list then.
They'll say, well gee, what do you get mine on there?
A short list of 700 days out there.
Well, that's not enough.
There's eight million fantasies out there in Radio Land Man.
And believe me, you ain't one of them.
And either he threw out the rest of us.
Well, what a motley looking crew.
And I know I'm sure that there are some people out there while they're listening to the show.
Oh, there we go.
Pretty worked out.
Well, somebody could just came in.
Yep.
Okay, so now the Beast will take your calls and add your whatever your choices to our list.
Well, we ponder over these numbers.
Who just popped in there?
Duff.
Yeah.
And what's that look on his face?
Is it the whole thing?
Good.
There you go.
Nice going, Duff.
All right.
Come in there without your Duff.
It's the Duffer baby.
We last once again.
Oh, Duff, get off this incident.
Okay, just calm down.
So we'll see how these numbers plan.
This is just a trend.
This is February, March, in April.
I could explain to you how these radio ratings work again.
They got a big 10 gallon head.
And they stick a whole bunch of numbers in there.
And they just pick out names or radio stations.
It's kind of like the draw for the evelmont, you know?
I don't want to blow the surprise, but the our morning guys beat big.
Well, so we're going up and big.
And the small 106 formerly big takes the, oh, brother, takes the pipe.
And keep in mind, that's still including February.
When big had a 9.9 with sternon there, okay, it's February, March, in April.
So can you imagine when the next trend comes out?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It is going to be deadly for a man.
And they'll say, well, you know, but we got Paul and Ron in there now to goose those numbers back up.
And we'll be able to goose this, okay?
Man, that is really something.
And you know, I can just wait for Howard Cohen in the hero tomorrow right.
Oh, well, the more evidence that big 106 isn't hurt by the loss of the shock shock in the morning there.
Howard's spirit.
Right.
Oh, in fact, you know something that I haven't played yet today?
It's that.
No, I don't know if I'll remember to play it.
Each of the gods return.
I need to work this never known.
Oh, hello.
Howard's there.
Now, one secret government agency.
Welcome to the Federal Community Commission.
You look like a bad black man.
They called upon.
They stand against them.
You must put your hands on the pants of a woman, don't you?
There are enemies that go to you tonight.
And we have had the lot of these people back.
We've never done it.
Good to be on the way here.
How do I kill it?
Hell, John.
Man.
Now banned from a radio near you.
Exactly.
So anyway, thank goodness that big 106 ain't taking a big hit because their clear channel
put all those stirrup, pulled stirrup off all their stations.
What a bunch of idiots you people have there, Larry.
Have no shame, no embarrassment.
Don't worry about getting it right.
Just put a bunch of crap.
Just fill up some space in between the ads.
That's all it is.
Don't worry about whether there's anything, huh?
Like us.
Yeah, well, now you got a good point there.
Well, at least we try to be a little bit accurate once in a great while.
You know, like our very scientific poll.
Is the beast taking names off the air?
He left.
He's gone.
What do you mean he left?
He ran out of the door.
He said, come back.
He wasn't serious and he left.
Why was that such a bad idea?
No, he's still here.
But it is a bad idea.
Why is that?
It sounds like gratuitous work for no good cause.
Okay, that's work.
Just taking the people off the air.
And then you decide whether you want to stick it on there.
That's all.
That's not all that.
You lazy fat turd rubber.
You know, wonder your despise in the building.
I wonder if that moke can't get along with you.
No matter Joe wanted you off at that show faster.
And you can say, uh, salami sandwich.
Well, that sounds pretty good.
You know, salami and Swiss.
Hmm.
Sounds trache, but it sounds pretty good on Rhino less.
Now, let's see.
Are you giving me the reason I'm stalling?
Is you want to give me the 12 plus numbers?
There's that's what we got.
That's all we have.
I understand that.
They always bring us these first.
And these are the least important cause 12 plus range.
The entire audience.
Everybody from the age of 12 up to a 155 from little tiny kids to
Mathuse level.
Who cares about that?
We could pretend they matter.
Well, we don't.
WCMQFM is number one.
But they went down from a 6 to a 5, 7.
That's not much of a drop.
Dropping off that big January.
Damn it.
That must be because of that Guillermo Schwarzberg they got on.
Power.
Stayed right there at 5, 5, number two.
Girl power.
Good old, what's his name?
Kid Scurvy.
Hot 105, 4.9 and this no change.
No changes.
Life.
Dropped a little bit.
I don't see anything going on here.
EDR.
Dropped from a fifth.
It went up from fifth to a time for fourth.
Radio Mombi went up.
Oh, so now we have another heavy spict trend here is what we got.
Radio Mombi, but old spics.
38 up to a 4.2.
Radio Amor, 4.3 to a 4.2.
WMIB, 4.0 to 4.
And very little change here, man.
Very flat.
KISS 3.6 to a 3.5.
What hell is WQM on here in 12 plus IOD32 down to a 2.7.
Uh oh.
QM2 under a 2.4.
Well, they dropped a little bit and we went up a little bit in 12 plus.
So how do you like that?
We'll take it.
We'll take it.
Big 2.0 to a 2.0, but again, it's not it.
See, and they're Howard Cohn will say, oh, there's no more change on Big.
They stayed at a 2.0 share.
You don't understand or ratings.
And you're writing in what's supposed to be a major market newspaper.
Whoever you are, Howard Cohn.
Oi!
His name is probably Lipshoots.
Anyway, oh, here we go in the morning.
How you doing?
What can you just say?
Are you crazy?
That's a name, man.
You know, that's the name like Van Diesel.
Boy, you guys are like a little bit emotional there.
Are you kidding me?
Okay, here we go.
6 to 10 AM, hot 105.
Number one.
Radio Mom B, number two.
Oh, boy.
And again, this is 12 plus, includes all those old beaners.
4, 6 to a 5 point.
Oh!
Radio Mom B.
Radio on more.
Okay, let's forget about it.
Let's cut to the chase.
Okay?
Let's see about the stations that anybody cares about.
Radio Romance, look at that.
MIB.
Where the hell is anybody?
Again, it's 12 plus.
Why do you do this to me?
W-I-O-D, 3, 4, and a morning down to about 2, 7.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
We love it.
Q-I-M 1.8 up to a 2.4, 12 plus.
All right.
Oh, this must be what Duff was talking about.
Big one from a 2.7 out of a 2-2.
There were in a 2-2 over there.
Probably old Polly's were in that thing.
He's were in a 2-2.
But again, these are numbers that mean absolutely nothing to anybody.
Oh, God.
And in the mid-date, we'll take it.
You know, if we get a little goose in there, which I doubt.
Let's see.
Or a dust.
Huh?
3-5 up to 3-7 in the mid-date.
But it's not even enough to talk about.
Doesn't really mean much, you know?
12 plus.
But CMQ-FM is still number one, but from a 7.5 to a 6.5.
So all those rigged dire.
I mean, all that baloney they had before, it's starting to wear off.
That month, the January disappeared.
CMQ-FM-I-S.
I think Bill Tanner is responsible for that.
And even though it is the Tanner building, we have nothing but contempt for Miss Tanner these days.
We're supporting E-0516.
Q-A-M.
The R&M, who knew?
John F. L'A-Texi, Carbassette Driver, Central Park.
You look at me, so quizzically.
I could tell she was in a dark.
So I acted out my puncture in, and with my arms the trees I made.
There's no bug.
He speaks English and a mother.
I went down to my home and I made a bridge where the weather was nice and sunny.
I walked into a liquor store with a guy that talks real funny.
I asked him for a pint of Holtion Beamy's ass.
No, at the end of what does that mean?
The butter's too English and I'm all.
That cornered Delhi.
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan.
Speak English, melee.
Or you can go back to the L.A.
I came here many years ago.
Learned my ABCs.
I don't say much is grossiest.
I said pretty please.
So get yourself to a classroom quick.
You're an American now.
Stop making this big.
You know about us.
Speak English.
Come in.
That's pretty obvious.
I'm looking at this many team plus radio mom B from a 4.0 time for 6 to 4.6.
They're up to number two in the market.
She got CMQ FM, no speed in glaze.
Radio mom B is second in the third in men 18 plus QM from a 4 to a 4, 5.
And why have the pages stopped coming across by the way?
I don't know.
I thought there was a jam on your eye.
I was going to ask you about it.
There's a jam on my end.
I beg your pardon.
There's no jam on my end.
Maybe it's stuff you're thinking about.
You said it was poisonberry.
I beg your pardon.
I'm refaxing from where they stopped.
And yes, you want the persons 18 to 34.
Absolutely not.
OK.
On persons 25 to 54, what do we care about those?
Puntly.
18 to 34.
Why do we care about that?
Just really interesting though, in spite of Howard Cohen's allegations of the Harold very inappropriately by the way last month,
that in the morning now, let's see, our morning guy is 3.3 in the winter book, up to a 4.2 from 13th all the way up to 7th.
How do you like that?
Nice to meet you.
I mean, Joel and Moll and Gully, and whoever else in it.
OK.
Let's see, who's number one in the morning?
WXDJ FM.
What is that?
Is that another one of those no-speakening lay stations?
I don't...
Duff says yes.
WXDJ went from tied for 5th to numero uno in a morning in men with a 5.6 radio mom B.
Oh my goodness, from a 4.9 to a 5.3.
This is...
Oh great.
That's exactly what it is.
CMQ FM, 6.4 out of a 5.3.
I totally they dropped it and I ducked from that to the big phony January.
I mean, those were the batteries.
I mean, look at this.
And WQBA is 4th in men in a morning and then WRTO.
That's another one.
Aradiotitmo, the top 5 stations in the Miami market in men in the morning are all no-speakening glace.
F.S.N.J. Radio Mom B. WCMA QAL FMA.
QBA and Aradiotitmo.
Then Zeta 4.1 to a 4.4.
Now, much of it rise there with no stern on the ear, 2 out of the 3 months.
Now, much of an increased air quality, pretty weak, pretty lame.
Man, that is pretty freaking weak.
I thought you didn't fax me any attend to 3 numbers now.
Now, you're skipping over 10 to 3 in men.
What's that all about?
It paused and I'm picking up again.
Oh, brother.
This is radio.
Is it that bad, the number?
The anticipation.
It's what?
Wild anticipation.
Well, it can't be all that great.
It's fine.
Congratulations.
It's fine.
Okay, well, I'll wait.
It's fine.
Oh, we're fine.
I don't see the beast answering any of these calls either.
Do you?
No.
I don't have the equipment to really hate the whole time.
You don't have the equipment all right between the ears is where you don't have the equipment.
What did you ever do to you that you hate him so much?
Really sad.
I just thought it'd be nice for the audience because I can't possibly do that and do all of this at the same time.
And I'm, you know, stapling these together and doing my little handy work here.
I'm trying anyway.
That's a better idea.
He can go downstairs in the lobby and we can invite people to come and talk to him in person.
And he can take us to check.
Wait a little out on the street corner there.
We can invite people to come and run his ass over.
Sounds good to me.
No, thank you.
I don't, I don't see any midday here.
You did for whatever reason.
The last page in the morning drive.
Something got screwed up then.
Let me refax the middays.
This is really very unfortunate.
The assumption that the audience doesn't care about this, especially just a trend.
That they already find this ponderous at best and they're already looking like playing part cheesy.
They go onto the shuffleboard court.
Anything beside, listen to this.
It's only an inside or radio thing, you know.
But when you see in the morning, the top five state, and you know whose fault that is, don't you dub?
Is dust still in there?
Yes.
I'm reaching over for more staples here.
Just relax.
It's your good, close personal buddy, Tanner, who lobbied the arbitron.
Oh, we are getting up Hispanic representation.
I had all of that bull crap, which is why if you'll notice not just in our market, but the whole nation wide in the last book, all through the roof.
Like all of a sudden they're multiplying like rabbits on you.
Who goes out there?
Oh, they are.
Some of us.
I still don't have no midday.
This is, this is a real bad thing.
Oh, geez.
Well, how come I'm getting 25 to 54 first?
See, because you're behind.
I'm going to your pardon?
Because I might be behind.
Because of your big fat behind.
All right, let's see how I hanged it here in the afternoon.
Let's take a look at the Humper, okay?
Who's on once in a while?
I don't even have that.
This is, this is an abortion is what this is.
I got like starting with number 17 in the afternoon.
That's the kind of, this is the kind of sloppy ashtrap.
We got the beast here who won't answer the frickin' phone.
We got between Duff and George and Clarence and the Gossama's coho, but we're seeing, huh?
It's the machine.
Who's machine?
Somebody's.
And then the machine, I got a clean machine, Mr. My Machine is the primo as it gets.
So anyway, in the morning we did nicely.
In nighttime we went up a little bit with that Marlon's goose that up from the hockey anyway.
The hockey's a death wish.
I feel like I'm just, I've been left out and now I got six am to midnight persons 25 54.
What in God's name?
Because I was already faxing that.
We'd already faxed all of these.
I just met 18 parts.
And it just didn't get to you.
Oh, brother.
A machine seized up.
Your machine seized up.
No, we're talking from reality.
Your machine is a piece of crap, okay?
Who bought that machine?
You?
Oh, sorry.
I'll get a better moment when I come back.
Alright, let's see what we got here.
Monday through Friday, persons 20, I have nothing that I have, you know,
I just reached back to the second time.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, we went down in men.
Look at that.
We went up a position, but we went down in the number.
All over, we're damn near.
In fact, 10 to 2, we might be number one.
You realize that?
In fact, I guarantee we are.
Oh, I know.
We are.
Many 18 plus WCMQ coming off of that bogus January when they had like an 11 share supposedly from a 9.0 in a winner down to a 6.5.
Still number one, but hang it out by their fingernails.
Thanks to that Guillermo Schwartz guy, they got on noon to 2.
We went from a 6.5 from number 3 up to a 6.3.
Number 2.
W-I-O-D went from a 6.8 down to 6.1.
How do you like that?
Radio Mom B went way up.
So this is a heavy duty, a whole new book.
And of course, the 2554 numbers will give you some insight into something.
If you could see the mesh that I have laid out here in front of me,
it was enough to make a room in front of me, even the dotering old fool like me as well.
This is sad.
Look at this.
I got, love 94 is 8 is 17th and men.
Yeah.
So I got.
All right.
Let's get back to mid days here.
Okay.
CMQ FM QA M-I-O-D, Radio Mom B, Life, Magic.
Magic dropped a little bit.
Looks like to me.
Would you say that that's an accurate assessment?
From what?
From where they were in the winner time.
They dropped a little bit from the last time.
What about the rest of the afternoon?
Are we going to get the rest of the afternoon or not?
You're getting everything now.
I'm getting, I'm getting hemorrhoids.
They're popping up like crazy is what I'm getting from this.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
I'll take a couple of calls myself here since the beast is too much of a hot shot to do it.
By the way, this is the beast's last appearance on our show.
It's been nice knowing you.
WQA M-Hello.
Yeah.
Can I ask for a request?
A request?
Then what would that be, sir?
A case in African-American.
Good morning.
Couldn't hear a word.
You were saying what?
You want to hang up on him is what you want to do.
Was he saying nothing?
Did you dump out every say?
Yeah.
Well, I just did again.
What was he talking about?
Nothing.
Okay.
Fiesick.
I told you the beast ought to take these calls.
But no.
I didn't.
There's no way for me to take a call.
Why is that?
There's no equipment.
There's nothing to take a call with.
Well, did that just happen today?
Did the ear...
Somebody ran off with our headset, apparently.
Somebody ran off with a headset.
So if we wanted to put the calls on hold, if we wanted to have the beast talk to you, folks,
and take your in-game aircraft, we could be stuck with the keyboard.
Wow.
Like I said, forget about it.
Thank God for that ball game.
It's all I can say.
Let's see how the Humper did in the afternoon here in men.
Number one, baby.
All right.
Nice going fat man.
Men 18 plus in the afternoon, QM action.
And the same thing.
Drop down in the share from number two to five point three, and down to a five point one.
But up to number one in the standings.
That's all we care about.
We don't give a crap about to the share when you're number one, right?
Nope.
When you move up a notch.
WEDR 4.9, or number two.
Power in the afternoon, four, five up to a four, seven.
CMQF.
And they're starting to drop down to where they belong in the middle of the pack.
They're not full of anybody.
W-I-O-D, the Schmidt-Nicester.
See, I think that as you see bushes numbers drop, and you're going to see that right wing crap drop into it.
They're finally, they're finally giving up some of them.
The ones who aren't the absolute religionists, the real true believers, the ditto heads.
They're finally giving up on that crap and saying, well, you know, guess what?
It turns out to be a pile of crap.
Maybe we've been lied to a little bit too much, and we don't want to be that embarrassed or whatever.
Maybe they just didn't get the diaries more likely.
And anyway, they've down from a five, seven to a four, three, from number one in the afternoon and men to number six.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just trying to get organized here because this is, likewise, pile of mess that we got here.
Then did you get all the men 18 plus or do we have to pack some of that?
Oh, I got them all, man.
I got all the men I can handle right now.
Great.
I don't have John Stockwell, but he's old and wrinkly now anyway.
So who the hell gives a crap?
Persons 25 to 54 Monday through Friday.
Oh, and the first sheet, you faxed me for just a second there.
I thought we were number one in person.
I almost passed out.
Oh, nice job.
Number 17, I'm sorry, but from a 2.3 up to a 2.8.
We're making some serious progress.
Okay, let me short some of this crap out here in the last half hour.
So we have some idea what's going on.
And then we got the Marlon Ball Game coming up.
In fact, we got Josh Slap and Dave Ann going around at the ballpark right now a little bit.
Get some circulation going in those cheeks.
Slap him on a face one time too, Josh.
That might help.
1157 at 560 WKM.
We apologize profusely for the mess that this half hour has been.
This has been very sad.
Although it keeps you on your toes.
And me too.
By now, you all know about balance for life.
And we know a big issue for a lot of you is you need the five day plan or the seven day plan.
Sometimes you think about that, and your brain wants to bust.
The five day plan doesn't include the weekends, but what if you just want a few meals on Saturday and Sunday?
The seven day plan has got all the meals, but what if you have dinner plans for the weekend?
It's all or nothing.
But now, balance for life is created for you the six day plan.
On Friday night, you'll get one big sack for the entire weekend.
So you can choose which meals you want to eat and when.
The best part about this plan is since balance for life is the only meal delivery service that offers you choices.
You can choose meals from either the Saturday or Sunday menu.
And to end of this plan, if you tell the wonderful folks at balance for life where you're going to eat out,
they'll tell you which items on the menu are balance for life approved.
What a complete service for you because balance for life is working exclusively with a few local restaurants,
the label menu items, balance for life approved.
So move over over atkins the zone is this smart way to go.

5-6-9-6-9-6-6-420-560.
You way up.
Mr. Cainy, I'd like to relax by having their Magical and massage my balls while listening to the meal Rogers 12-1 hour beeping.
Hey.
Maybe tell me see that we're lacking in the form.
They provide a headline that will lead you by the form.
You say they said it's the one you get.
Now they have only one.
They say they'll love.
Don't put your thoughts to God.
We got them.
Now we're all puppy and say you got them.
They won't let hackers know you got them.
Where is most my kids?
You say 9-11 is what they got you to believe.
Can't get any gum or put a whole party card to believe.
You believe what they say like the ball.
Like the ball and the ball fall as they unite.
The state is the state to the full.
We're two.
We'll be elections on.
We got a rock.
Push it down and give.

We got a hit down on your knees.
We got a hit down on your knees.
We got a hit down on your knees.
We got a hit down on your knees.
This is a hit down on your knees.
What you gonna do is go up and down, down, down.
We're trying to get them to the right criminal court.
You got SDG no speaking English radio retimo no speaking English W. RMA radio romansias fourth W. A. M. R.
Radio amor is fourth time for fourth with RMA and A. M. R. I think they just can't tell the colors apart
WCM QFM is number six. Oh my god. Are you and then power is number us time for six right?
All ethnic stations man all the ethnic so the time are there any like white non-ethnic
No, I think you had the right idea this morning before the show
What was that somebody's fault? I think there ought to be a lawsuit oh Bill Triner
I think it sounds like a lawsuit to me Greg. I think we all the whole state needs to assume is Tanner
She's the Chigger in the wood pile or paying him. She's the one. Yeah
He's supposed to be the consultant for all of our station not just for our power, but for all of our stations
And yet he's running around opening up a big gap with Arbitron about well the Spanish stations are represent their under sample out of Ampalone
Okay
If you were to believe Miss Tanner is only like 18 people in a whole town who was speaking English
Why 100 what got a fourth three there's six in the morning and whatever this is Zeta
3 5 to a 4-row they made an increase there. How do you like that?
They actually went up see I don't lie about the numbers here Paul and old Ron
They did all the what did they do and then did we figure that out yet or do you
How did they do in men
4 1 to a 4 4 a slight increase there many team plus nothing spectacular
We'll see but they did a nice increase there on person 2554
3 5 up to a 4.0 with Howard Stern was okay. Oh, by the way, we have a headset update
Yes, I went and searched the studio and found where somebody had stashed it and where was that?
Oh on the other side of the computer on the floor like somebody had just thrown it on like somebody schmucked it
Somebody just like threw it away from them. You know what I mean in a wet right behind the computer
Be right nice going by the way duck and clearance
I'm keeping all these spas holes out of our studios there at night very nice job
So we read all these two's this but see if you would have said they're right in the beginning and so saying oh
It's not gonna do that. It's a bad idea if you would have just said there's no headset and I wasn't it's fun
Oh, I still a bad idea. It wasn't anywhere near it. It's not a bad idea. Why isn't a bad idea?
Would you subject anyone to talk to the collars? So in other words, it's okay for me to put people
I like that schmuck that we had a dump before you didn't pay a lot of money to put them on the air and what's he getting paid for to sit there on his
Bad ass and need food right? Oh
Well now that clarifies a lot
Mid-days, let's see how do we do?
2554 men and women now we have no women
So all I do is like double the number we went from a 4 3 to a 4 4 from 9 to 6 tied for 6
So we went up a little bit so the 8 8 we did about an 8 4 8 5 and men sure that's pretty darn good
That's certainly well enough for number one in the men 2554 that sounds like a bonus to me
Chican of course, this is only one month only one month. Don't get too carried away now
Let's see Monday through Friday 3 to 7 in the afternoon. How did the Humper do there?
Humper where are you Humper?
3 2 to a 3 4 from number 16 to number 15
So you take the 3 4 and you double it at 6.8
So we got about a 6 5 going there. It should be enough for number one. I think we're gonna be number one in
Then 2554 we stopped the book right now
You know it's like when you got a horse that three likes ahead of the top of the stretch when you're tripled
You got all three your horses are there leading the pack of the top of the stretch you're saying stop the race now
Stop the end of course. They never do no don't stop now because if that CMQ trend continues
That's a very easy drop. They made well what do you mean by that? We're gonna pass them right these we're gonna
Pass them like they're standing still how do they do in midday now that you mentioned that CMQ let me take a look
This is a significant story there. Oh, yeah, six one down to a five one from second down to fourth in midday. You're looking at the persons
Right I was looking at the man
No, no book 2554 the men includes a lot of old men. Yeah, no, no, obviously there were a lot of old Julios who are
Got that reason this hopefully well. I mean there's no question. Yeah, but I know
The old mom I did that when I would that when I would nickers man that would I would check it a banana that when I would
Desi Arnez all out of crap
Radio on more my ass and not even all of these
It's you know it's a miracle. I let's pet ourselves in a back big time, okay?
Oh seriously how do you do in the market when nobody speaks English and half of the ones who do speaking was pretend that they don't how to have you
Compete in the middle of that okay? What kind of a bunch of crap is that and then you got a consultant
That's running to the arbitrage on company saying oh you're under sampling my speaks man
You're under say all this other garbage which you'll notice all across America. At least he's having some impact. He's having some clout
That's screamer
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line
What celebrity or let's get back to the poll okay? Let's get back to doing the show that that was a 48 minute disaster or 30
Whatever you know what seem like 48 hours, huh? They love it. What do you mean they love it? It was in coherent
I still don't know what Helen's all about all I'm doing all I know is we must add a pretty decent month
Did the month extrapolate any of this not yet? Well, I'll do it right now. I'll tell you what we had many team plus what do we just have in here?
But then we actually go down a little bit a little bit a tenth of a point
Yeah, but I don't think the individual month was anything to write home about
What the hell did we have in there?
Can I find it can you find it? We got a search party out here. We're looking for it from there. It is five to six three six three
So that means the nine 18.9 and we had let's see what do we have?
Six six and the six one I think something like that 12.7 so we had a six a six two in April. Okay. Well, that's okay not great
That's 10 to three now the mad dog he always holds his own he's always throwing in a good number
So we'll see that's only one month
But in the meantime big is falling off the face of the earth and
Ron and Paulie picked up a little bit of the pieces there in the morning not spectacular nothing sensational and
A year old once again sucks the big one okay, I mean, they're just just outrageous and Tom jicke where are you huh?
You got a major FM there with a hundred thousand watts on the dial. That's been like a
Major player thanks to Stern and now they're dropping off the face of the globe
We even beat him in the morning 12 plus no less
Is how bad they're dropping and he can't be bothered writing about it
This is the kind of urenellism you get in South Florida man
You got two fish wrappers and it's really pathetic. That's why you'll be your auto-reason our website
I'm getting back like I started to do the poll question and it's a damn good thing that the beast didn't take any more names

418 votes on there already what celebrity or well-known person is your all-time sexual fantasy and if yours isn't on here start thinking about some of these

If you're caught driving without a seatbelt you will be removed from your car and shot
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety under the new Patriot Act 2
The new laws in effect now so click it or be shot
Officers don't like doing this. They are only following orders
It's for your own protection in the never-ending fight against terrorism terrorist acts such as mouth noise
Carping and fighting
But be annoying to others so under Patriot Act 2 eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot
It's the law
We like saying that the law the law the law
It's the law

The mail service cut off in cross-springs area after acid bombs found you see this story?
Yeah, all over the place those punks. I'll be damned
Well, I told you cross-springs nothing but a bunch of punks gang members
degenerates
Joshua's there
like I said
A series of five acid bombs placed outside four cross-springs homes yesterday morning damage
Three curbside mailboxes and one vehicle and cross mail service near to be temporarily suspended
No one was injured in the incident. The court is urgent rich and the court will police spokesman
Postal Inspector Debbie Allison said mail service was temporarily suspended in the area with the devices exploded as police officers
Check mailboxes deliveries in the area resumed
Summaries late Tuesday afternoon the audio the audio
Tuesday discoveries followed six other bombs being found across spring since May 24th and three mailboxes located just down the street
For on a Tuesday's bomb locations had been set on fire over the weekend
In the past these usually been perpetrated by kids
So of course we're going to be looking at it that way in the Corvo said
But it could be an adult. We don't have any suspects in mind at this point. Ain't that lovely?
Only got to have something to do up there in Coral Springs
Carrier's Riviera Beach stop reinforces Florida's importance in the election
You see a old Carrie Meister the Herman Munster was in the Riviera Beach. Author among the TV
Chose a scenic waterfront spot with Rose of London with your uniformed and uninformed law enforcement officers behind him to launch his latest attack and president
Pushes National Security policies
He still look like a dead man in the suit if he asked me he received rousing applause from a crowd of 300 in a county
That remains so riled over the 2000 election that a wind should seem obvious
You people in Palm Beach County better get out and droves in November in the thousands okay?
You may get all your dead relatives to vote to get him registered right now
And those absentee ballots that are come pour in by the millions
But Carrie's speech at the Port of Palm Beach marked his third visit in three months to Palm Beach County
Assigned that he's not taking votes for granted and even the traditionally democratic strongholds of eastern Florida
That helped delay President Bush's win in 2000
Bush won the state in the presidency by only 537 votes with the Democratic Palm Beach County
Best known for creating the infamously confusing butterfly ballot
Shouldering much of the blame. Yeah, I knew old Jews up there. They voted for Pat Buchanan. Shame on you's
You with silly old Jews
Why?
They caught those silly old Jews made the Al Gore lose
And you don't like rap you're spitting
I'm spitting it man
And maybe they ought to be going intues to vote this time the silly old Jews
That'll be news
Just cruise out out to your vote and spot man anyway. I think in Palm Beach County
It's not a question winning it or losing it that rap crab man anybody to close that music and just like I was talking about yesterday
About those nostalgia things I was watching on biography anybody while you name me a rap song
It's gonna be remembered like 30 years from now
But third man just name me one
Or a rap artist and don't give me no 50 cent huh
I'm talking about a live one for example. I got it. Yeah
Yeah, that must be it and don't forget me that M&M crap. Okay. Although I do like the M&M. It's pretty good
I think in Palm Beach County
It's not a question of winning it or losing it but what magnitude of victory they can achieve said David Nimbine an associate professor political science at FAU
Because the essence of the democratic masses you can lose almost the entire state as long as you win a big enough margin of view of the counties like Dave and Broward and Monroe and Palm Beach
Nimbine said the late governor
Lawton Charles walking lot in the Hikun defeated governor jab busha 94 by winning only a handful of Florida 67 counties
The populist counties of southeastern Florida could deliver a similar victory for carry this time
We can only pray we can't afford to have it close enough so they can have those goons from out of state all those paid goons coming in knock at the doors down going
Blarrow sin all that fake crap that went on there
And immediately just buying right into a man all the media was obsessed with the way I was showing us that judge
Will stare up at that hole in the obvalid that's all that's the only thing they cared about
We must have seen him how many thousand time
Two thousand times and that was just in the first month after the election while I recount was going on
Before currents token Thomas said oh send it up here baby send some good crap
And set it on up here we'll take care of it for you and at nenskalea said oh sure okay. Yeah, we'll do it
So anyway, that's the deal. I think we'll see a lot of John Curie in Palm Beach County said nibbine
I don't think we'll see a lot of George W Bush
Because an unpopular political figure tends to increase turnout and the more people that vote the more you're gonna lose that county by
George W Bush doesn't do himself any favors by showing up here in Palm Beach County said how do you like that?
So the bush mice derank that'd be shown up much if at all
You know where he'll show up
He'll be showing up in telehassy with his brother. He'll be showing up in two egg
Tampa all the mug one parts of the state. That's right for all the tree climbers are hanging it out
We're all the abesities are up there and they are hanging out in the tree and hanging by their limb
Anyway, we got the ballgame coming up and I'm so delighted to begin out of here today. You have no idea that like
I have an idea. Huh? I have an idea
An out-of-body experience and addition to us there wasn't all that much change anyway
Except for the fact that big and do we actually look at the um what did I do? I think I threw away all the numbers
I kept them
Oh no seriously do we look at what they didn't men in the morning
Many team plus my moment, please folks. Let me just fumble through this one more time and try to salvage something
Big 106 which were always number one by a mile when stern was on big 106 and look at that
They already had dropped from first to fifth with a four six in the last the book
And now they dropped from four six and number five to a three three and number fourteen and it's still with that huge
Month of February in there
What's the next trend comes out big 106 will basically vanish from the face of your radio
How do you like that? But they got Paul and old Ron on there to bail them out. I think that's gonna do it
