Either you best do right!
My Emmy has the Marlins, a champion based Waltine, not won before the series.
No fans were ever seen.
Now that they're chance they have a fan surrounding them like rats.
Who wins this elevator?
One refunds for their has, but they're just front-running fondies.
Front-running fondies, children's support unless they won.
Yeah, they're just front-running fondies.
Front-running fondies, don't give a crap about the one.
My Emmy branch sounds even above him, miles square.
Let all around the pouring can where no one really cares.
For all that they can interest in supporting their home team.
We'll call up for all radio to get their tickets free.
Because they're just front-running fondies.
Short on support unless they won.
Yeah, they're just front-running fondies.
No way to hold now.
Thank God we're gonna be doing a Marlin poll the first poll of the day.
We got two polls for you.
Ah! Well, we can talk.
Ah, whatever.
Well, the reason I'm doing a Marlin poll is because it's sports.
Right.
Sport?
Thank God we're all talking about sports.
Who imagined if we were to sports station?
No.
I think the way that we're gonna reform a clearance on that whole sports thing.
I think we need to take away his balls for a year.
Huh?
His golf balls?
No, he has to fall.
His ball.
His football.
His basketball.
His basketball.
His tennis balls.
Oh, look at his fuzzy points.
He said he's already got him locked away in a drawer for safekeeping.
His mommy keeps the key.
Ball bearings.
But anyway, we'll talk about that later if I feel like it.
I just can't talk.
I feel okay.
Can I give a little story?
I'm gonna tell a story about the guy at the track last night.
Positive story.
Nice guy.
Okay.
Sitting there.
Nice night at the track last night.
Nice going rich in Derek.
We had a good night.
One of few bucks.
Thank you, Dick Feinberg.
Steve Wolf.
Thank you, uh, Old Mike McDonald.
You know Mike McDonald?
No, I know Old McDonald.
That's him.
He's old.
And anyway, now he won a nice race for me.
Nice going Mike.
And I go on Old Sonny Patterson too.
Sitting at the table, minding our business at the track, Pompa-Dopark.
And a guy comes, is waltzing down.
Now over the years, you know, every now and then somebody will come by to say hi.
And you're always very nice.
Sometimes a little linger a little bit too long, you know, or a little bit obnoxious.
And this guy, never saw it before in my life, he was, I would say, I don't know, 45 to 50-ish.
Just guessing.
So, can I just take a minute of your time?
Um, from New York, I've been out here seven years in the only rear of sunshine in my life every day.
And I just want to tell you how much I appreciate the free entertainment.
Oh nice.
And I said, gee, thanks very much.
That's nice.
That was it.
That was short.
Sweet to the point.
And I thought to myself, God, if we had about 300,000 people, like, I'm not talking to, in relation to me, I'm just saying in general.
Right.
A bench.
You know what I mean?
Sure.
He didn't punch anybody in line in the face and knock them down and put them into a coma so that they died.
See that guy, you know, I, did you see the story actually on the news?
Yes.
About how the daughter of the guy that's being charged, the guy that murdered this other guy about punching, knocking him down.
She says, oh well, um, but it was an accident.
And both families are suffering terribly.
It wasn't an accident.
He punched the guy in the head.
He was a violent asshole.
Right.
He said, I'm not just violent piece of crap.
And he turned out a plea deal.
You're in jail.
And I forget how long house arrest.
Turn it down.
I'd like to fry his ass.
Sure.
In butter.
Right.
And I think most other people would like to do it too.
Over, over movie tickets.
Over parking spaces.
Yeah.
This is the South Florida fukin' way, man.
Anger hostility.
See?
Just like, okay, here's the result of yesterday's pull.
By the way, thanks to that guy who came by last night.
He was a good guy.
Appreciate it.
Somebody nice.
Who didn't say, I hope you die.
And I like that.
We'll go on to those today.
Maybe a few.
1245 votes on the poll yesterday.
I would like to say this to you too.
Which I said to you this morning.
A lot of people are forgetting about the Howard Dean thing is that the explosion, the whole...
Rand.
It didn't come in the middle of, in a vacuum.
Right.
It came on the heels of him blowing a big lead in Iowa of his horrendous performances and at least two debates.
And of the public becoming more and more leery about what he was really all about.
It came on the heels of a dismal third place finish in Iowa.
I mean, I didn't even bet a horse last night that gagged and puked his bad as he didn't Iowa.
And as he's doing New Hampshire already.
So this is in other words an enormous number of people who have been very excited and motivated by him had already begun to sprout very serious doubts.
So you can say, well, the media and they are showing it every five minutes now.
I've seen just in the last half hour of seeing it.
About 30 man.
Times.
And of course, but you've got to know that.
See, when you're going to play that game, you can't give the media fodder.
You know, for your father.
You can't do it.
Because they're going to bury it with it, no matter who you are.
And this doesn't even have to do with politics in terms of right or left.
It just has to do with the fact they like to make people look like assholes.
And that's exactly what he did.
And all of a sudden he trots out the wife.
I didn't I didn't see the thing because I was the track last night and see the Diane Sawyer interview.
But he trots his wife out now after all the criticism of the fact he's been keeping her in a broom closet somewhere.
And he says he doesn't want to schlepper around as a prop.
Well, he's just not a good campaigner.
He doesn't get it.
He's a hard ass.
And it's okay to be a hard ass to a point, but you have to show a little bit of humanity.
People in general, I would agree with him.
I'm afraid of somebody that's that intense.
One thing to be intense, it's another thing to be, you see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Like that.
I think he should move to Florida.
Get himself a condo.
Knock a few old people down.
Have a margarita.
Have a couple of margaritas at UnSouth Beach.
Learn to speak esponial.
And he'll feel like a rubber glove right up your anus.
Anyway, here's the result of the poll.
I know it's important to mention that because people also thought I was picking on him and I would not vote for him.
I mean, if he was in the general election, sure I would vote for him.
But I'm talking about it in the primary.
There was a chance I would vote for him because I know he's unelectable.
You know what I just said?
He is unelectable.
He's unelectable.
Period.
Do you debate that?
No.
Yes.
No.
Unelectable.
Okay.
I don't think there are many places in this country right now.
He can be elected dog catcher.
Probably right.
Right.
Because he might scare the dog.
Yeah.
He might scare the dog.
I guess a nice cough drops for you.
Oh, what are they?
Sugar free?
Yes.
Oh boy.
There the hallway.
There the hallway.
I'll be right on the free pocket.
1245 votes.
What's your take on Howard Dean's famous wacky speech and I?
What we asked yesterday?
We're going to South Carolina.
And Oklahoma.
And then Oklahoma.
And then Arizona.
And North Dakota.
And New Mexico.
And we're going to California.
And Texas.
And New York.
And we're going to South Dakota.
And Oregon.
And Washington.
And Michigan.
And then we're going to Washington DC to take back the White House.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Even a crazy Dean is better than Bush.
473 people voted for that.
I'm still a forum.
He was just rallying his troops 200.
So he said that's 54% positive still.
He's lost it 199.
I'm glad we found out about him now.
That was my vote 164.
I never liked him anyhow.
144.
And the doctor was self-medicating too much.
He's popping a few too many.
65.
Out of 1245 votes.
He's unelectable.
He will not win.
He will not be the candidate.
He might be.
He would make Michael Duke caucus look like a champion vocator.
Tell me right now.
By the way, this guy.
This is the most chronic of the factors now.
I don't read the comics.
I don't, you know.
You can hack me and try to quit that fact.
I'm not interested.
Dan Labasterd, which I also never read.
I just happened to see it this morning.
I saw the headline.
And Dan Labasterd finally after all these years
wrote a column that made sense.
He didn't even talk about the fact that he's Cuban.
Very nice going, Dan.
It was absolutely incredible.
Yeah.
And that the, the Cubans won the World Series 97
and a bunch of Goyom won it in 2002.
Three.
Whatever you're what?
What must the Marlins do to win over the fickle fans?
This is one of the most alarming articles.
And it's very good.
Excellent going, Dan.
About five years right now.
Another good one.
But, and it proves what I've said all along.
And it gets a lot of people pissed off.
Oh, Neil was so negative.
It's Neil's fault.
The Marlins, you know, all that John Henry crap we used to get.
Like, what have I got to do with it?
Well, if you would just support it there.
Have I ever discouraged anybody from buying a ticket?
I'm not talking about the freebies.
A lot of you free loaders get like a deposit game.
I'm talking about buying a ticket.
Which I admit I don't have to do all along when I was going to the dolphin games years ago.
I bought my own tickets.
Me and a fat man.
But, you know, everybody can talk a good game.
Talk is cheap.
Just look at these calls we get every day.
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.
But, you know, for those people who put out a few bucks
and the Marlins tickets aren't expensive.
So we'll take our first poll on that.
We'll get into Dan LaBasterd.
All you people who are subscribers to Amovon.org.
Members, how to check out moveon.org today.
But, I'm not going to be talking to you all day.
I'll take.
And I just read the first paragraph or two of the latest newslighter.
They just blurbed that came on my website, my email.
Dear moveon member, during this year's Super Bowl,
you'll see ads sponsored by beer companies, tobacco companies, and the Bush White House.
But you won't see the winning ad on moveon.org,
voter funds, bush, and 30 seconds ad contest, CBSBFuses to Arid.
Meanwhile, the White House is on the verge of signing in a law deal
with Senator John McCain says, is custom tailored for CBS and Fox,
allowing the two networks to grow much bigger.
CBS lobbied hard for this rule change, moveon.org members across the country lobbied against it,
and our ad has been rejected while the White House ad will be played.
It looks an awful lot like CBS's playing politics with the right to free speech.
And they are...
Absolutely correct.
So read the whole thing, go to moveon.org.
We have a link to it on our website.
Read the whole thing in weep.
Because now, the right wing, you know, they're dangling all the carrots
in front of the big media conglomerates, as you know.
And pretty soon you'll only have one point of view.
That'll be it.
America Uber Alice.
Get that... start your step, baby.
Good for you. Good exercise.
12 minutes after 10 at 5, 60 W to QAM.
Well, I want to get the period recorded spot, but...
But what?
Are we playing period recorded today?
Oh, I don't know. I didn't think we were, so that's why I don't have a pizza lot.
I can talk. I just sound awful squeaky.
At least I don't have a sore throat.
That's extra fun.
Like, squeaky from...
I'm not going to do that pizza lot copy from yesterday, because it's suck Jeff.
You know, you're a good guy.
Your food is great.
Your restaurant is fantastic.
But your spots...
It's almost like he could be hard to write copy here, because he writes garbage for copy.
Pizza lot is home of the world's best pizza.
They have three different kinds.
They've got great Italian goodies, a fabulous menu.
Everything is fresh, cooked just the way you love it.
And of course they give you a big fat portions that are enough for you, almost the entire family.
Joggianic portions, it'll be a miracle if you can finish.
Every Monday at the loft is La Zon United, Tuesday's Egg Plant Night.
Buy one of these dinners on these nights, get the second one for only five bucks.
I think these things are still going on, because I'm going back to the old copy, and I'm sure they might...
And if not, tell me...
Hey, you said it, it's still going on.
And every Wednesday, kids eat free with adults, they can see Jeff's famous magic show as they whip it out for you.
Every Thursday night is Bike Night at the loft.
Come on a motorcycle, buy one dinner, and get the second for a price, and Jeff will wipe it off for you.
They've got the best damn garlic rolls you've ever had in your life.
So if you want a really fantastic meal, big portions, fresh goodies, the best attendance stuff anywhere in town at amazingly modest prices.
The pizza lot is still unbeatable.
You'll find, among university drive between I-595 and Griffin Road, right behind Pierwinn and ports with tons of free parking for you too.
So take it home, have it delivered, or eat it right there at the pizza lot.
And they cater up parties, all kinds of functions, all kinds of affairs.
That's Jeff's favorite word.
K-Dring for his lowest five bucks per person.
Pizza lot, give him a call at 954-916-888.
954-916-8880.
Why in local?
We're sports radio 560-CUA-M.
Or David's a bitch.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm with 560-WQ-A-M.
We'd like to know, are you a sport home?
Yeah, damn right, I am.
What's your opinion?
I mean, what's your take?
On the recent changes at WQ-A-M.
Well, I'm glad that old Fag is gone, because I want to hear sports all day.
You know, just real men talking all day about men.
Now, I know they got that Cuban fella.
He's filling in with, he talks too much about women, you know.
He's a straight guy.
I mean, I want to hear other men, old-go-other men's firm butts and tighten on.
Well, that's what sports is all about, buddy.
Give me all sports radio, where they all go men all day.
Give me all sports radio.
I graph myself when I hear sports whole Saturday.
Look how fast he can run.
Look how fast he can joke.
That's the kind of man I'd like to hold.
Give me all sports radio for the man and man.
All right.
That's clearance.
1018-560-WQ-A-M.
I feel a little bit better now.
I didn't feel better, I just can talk a little.
Maybe I'm like, maybe it's the cough drops.
They are helpful, I love these.
Maybe it's these halls of mental liptus.
I think that's doing it.
I don't know.
I think everybody knew audience that almost everybody in the building is either has right now or is head in the last couple weeks this crud.
Yes.
So this cold that I got, this head cramp, as soon as I get out of this town, it'll be gone.
As soon as I get out of this sick building, it's a sick building.
Sounds like a lawsuit Greg.
Oh, Greg, it's a suit, it's a suit, Greg.
Oh my god.
Yeah, just calm down, though.
Just relax.
Everything's under control.
It's just one of the benefits of working here.
You get to breathe in all that free algae and mong and mildew.
Yes, it's old.
It's the same illness.
It's oldy moldies.
I mean, it worked for Magic Locati when up in his last book.
So anyway, we were running some obnoxious promos on this radio station,
which I heard coming back from the track last night.
You played me one when I first came back,
and I thought, oh, they'll never put those on here.
Too embarrassing.
Yeah.
They're too friggin' embarrassed.
Guess again.
And so I'm hearing a whole bunch of these about, oh, can you imagine
if QM were all sports talk radio?
I often do.
Yeah.
We could only pray.
We could only pray for that.
Like, hallelujah.
Right.
Even he's excited about it.
And so I told Dick Feinberg at Pompo-no last night about the promos,
because I heard one go to the track last night,
and he stood there with his jaw down to his ankle.
He said, in other words, it's like taking a shot at you,
because anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail,
who isn't just a football squeezer,
knows the history of this radio station of the last six years anyway.
And before that.
Right.
I remember some asshole with a very short haircut
and a very expensive suit,
and as I came out of the tea room two years ago,
in a hallway, Santa May, oh, congratulations on another great book, Neil.
We never had any ratings to you came here.
Remember that exact quote?
Sure.
We never had any ratings to you came here.
No, they needed to say more real good book,
but other than that, the station didn't have any big numbers.
But can you imagine if we weren't all sports talking about you,
but the dolphins in the draft,
see, this isn't all sports radio.
It's all D.N.D., and it's not Danny and Dave anymore.
I am burstin' out of that.
It's dolphins and draft.
Draft beer?
Dolphins and draft.
Draft beer.
Or Virgil and Wango, all-star team.
Anybody talkin' about that?
No.
No, maybe briefly, because nobody cares.
You think they're gonna have pudge unpacking?
Yeah.
They're packin' a pudge stuff again.
First of all, I just wanna make one comment about that.
Not that I give a crap, because I'm not gonna be a phony
and say I'm a Marlon fan, because I'm not.
If somebody slaps you in the face and says,
oh, I was insulted by your offer.
That seven million year plus the other three million,
ten million year for whatever was.
Yeah, I would say, well, guess what?
Don't let the door hit you in your big fat ass on a way out of town.
Right, he's got a big fat ass.
That's what I would say.
And the idea, oh, can we get him back?
It shows that these assholes have no shame.
What kind of a moron wants him back?
I say it's time to send pudge packing.
After he leaves the White House today,
send pudge packing.
Not that I care.
And obviously nobody else does either,
because this Dan La Bastard column today is so damn...
Now, I realize that the rush through is big.
We'll get to that.
The Halliburton employees accepting kickbacks is big, right?
But the only problem with that is it's just like the Marlins.
Nobody cares.
Yeah.
See, that's another thing.
I mean, this being a hotbed of activism, that it is.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It's a hotbed of hot animals is what it is.
That's South Florida.
I mean, unless you're soaking your teeth in a glass,
you don't belong here.
That's why I'm getting it.
Huh?
And I'm soaking in it right now.
Poor Martha Ray rest in peace.
She would have loved it here.
Well, I'm telling you, the faxes are just pouring in today.
Go Peter Ren.
Now where the hell did that come from?
In this day of correctness, why aren't we call a lobbying?
What it really is legalized bribery?
Says Captain Rick and go Peter Ren.
Ha ha ha ha!
Go Mike McDonald, baby.
Old Michael.
Old McDonald, Hado Horace.
Anyway, what must Marlins do to win over fickle fans?
I just want to read this because it sets up the first poll,
and they'll explain to you why we'll do that from Nautilneau.
The second poll, we got to build.
Should I do the second poll first?
Okay, whatever.
Well, because that's the only thing they'll call about.
The second poll that we'll do at noon and two to weekend.
And what inspired me to do this?
Remember I talked yesterday about seeing Rick Sanchez
and about two minutes of his awful, awful show on Channel 6.
Oh, full.
I mean brutal.
I think that he's a legend in his own mind.
I don't think he was ever, you know,
well, he's convinced someone else obviously.
The ratings on Channel 7 were big for the news
because it's Channel 7, because it's hysterical,
hyperventilating, melodramatic, crap.
Didn't he invent that?
Well, they distinct, no speaking English flavor.
Although now Channel 4 is our two in that category.
Right.
All right, Rita's is all day.
But, sorry, I figured, who's your all-time favorite?
South Florida TV personality.
News or entertainment.
We've never done this.
We've done parts of it.
Right.
I mean, I realize this isn't negative.
It doesn't give you a chance to take a shot at anybody.
But if somebody doesn't do well, if they make it on the pole
and they don't do well at all, it'll be the same as taking a shot.
I got a short list I made.
First five.
Ralph Renek.
John Hambrick.
Skipper Chuck Sink.
Rick Sanchez.
And Bishop.
That's my short list.
I mean, there'll be a million others on here.
Well, you got mine on there.
Skipper Chuck.
Yep.
And mine is John Hambrick.
He's talking to Hambrick.
He's talking to Hambrick.
Yes, he was.
And he's a good guy too.
So, what's the most important?
He's a professional for this town.
See, that's why people say, well, what do you do for a living?
And I say, well, I'm a bush league talk show host.
Because I got to be bush league to be, you know, in this town.
Oh, I do.
I don't mind saying that.
If you can make a lot of money being bush league,
my big professional for it, right?
So if anybody says, oh, he's just a bush leagueer.
Right.
The money still goes right in the bank.
I almost feel like taking my tea out of the thing there.
But I'll wait to liberate.
I can fetch it.
And I think you should play the spots.
Okay, I just didn't have the pizza lot thing.
No, because it's, and it runs again later.
I'll read that one later, because his copy.
I wouldn't want you to play that one from yesterday anyway.
Now, these other spots that are very slurry sounding,
they sound like I'm stroked out in all those spots.
Don't they?
Yeah.
Why?
Just one of those things.
It must have been the day that you recorded them all.
I sounded when it out, stroke it out.
We just took the freshest recording we had.
So, oh, in other words, I was here when I,
because that's the current I was here.
Right.
Well, of course, I'm always really sick when I'm here.
It is. It's a sick building, man.
Yeah.
Didn't it year ago, in February?
A year ago, next month, I had a stroke right here.
Right in this town.
Yeah.
Right.
And then I came to work the next day.
And then I got on the treadmill there at Cleveland Clinic.
With my good friend, Dr. Bush.
Thanks for not quite killing me, Dr. Bush.
I put another stress test.
What do you say, huh?
No.
No, he's okay.
He means well.
He said he would do anything for me.
As long as I promised not to sue them.
What must Marlon's do to win over fickle fans?
Right, Stan LeBass.
I can't believe that I'm a glowing thing about this.
The essence of his article, I'm not going to read it,
because I don't have the voice to read anything.
The essence of the article is it's a Bush League town.
Wow.
Cano Vell.
But he points out that the Marlon's might be good enough to visit
the White House, which they are today,
but they're evidently still not quite good enough for you.
President David Samson said Thursday,
his team hasn't sold even 5,000 season tickets yet.
I'd hate to see what the Panther season ticket really honest total is.
Fuck, third man.
Yeah, I think that might be accurate.
It says this is the pressing unfathomable, inexplicable damning
and probably without President Major American sports,
right, Stan LeBassard.
And believe me, he knows his crap.
Isn't crap his middle name?
Yes.
And he goes on at the end of the article and he says,
if a champion can appreciably increase in sustained interest,
why would a new stadium building?
Why would a new building do it?
It's not the stadium.
Stams in a great location.
And he shows the fan bases not only of other major league teams,
embarrassing teams like the Montreal Expose,
soon to be defunct.
The Buffalo Bisons, minor league team,
they've already sold 6,000 season tickets.
Sacramento Rivercats, minor league team, 7,000.
The Anxious Detroit Tigers,
in one of the most obnoxious cities in the face of the earth, 7,500.
And I'm Angels 21,000, Cubs 28,000.
He's got an interesting list here.
You ought to take a puke at an Harold.
Marlins, between 4,500 and 5,000.
Less than the Expose,
who sold close to 5,000.
Less than the Buffalo Bison, etc.
So the first pool today,
why do you think the World Champion Marlins have sold so few,
less than 5,000 season tickets?
Five choices.
South Florida's Bush League,
their fans are mostly front-running phonies.
They need a new stadium,
like me, most people don't give a shmit about them.
Or there are a few real sports fans here.
Dolphins in the draft.
Danny and Davey, Dolphins in the draft.
See, this is not a sports talk station.
It's a dolphin talk station,
with a little window dressing on a few other things,
a little smattering, a little sprinkle, you know?
And you know what?
It's boring.
You can run all the pro,
while I talk to the parents,
get those eyes out and tell them,
but I suggested he might get them off.
And they were like,
okay.
It was easy.
He's easy. That's what the B said.
It's one thing he loves about him.
He's easy.
He says, you know,
get down on your hands and knees.
No problem.
Roll over.
No problem.
Over to your plan of spots.

So Thank you, Daniel H composed for finally writing a good calm number one.
to see if you had a cup of coffee today.
See because this isn't a sports pool.
See because this isn't a sports pool.
It's a pool about this town.
It's a pool about these people.
the front-running phonies.
Air-conditioned state.
And I realized that we didn't jump on that Marlon bandwagon back in October and September
when they were winning the playoffs in the World Series because it would be phonia
would be disingenuous.
I do appreciate those great calls from Boobshambh from that Marlon parade, you know.
No, seriously, it's a serious problem because people here are in denial.
It's like, I'm a bad guy because I tell them the truth.
Well, now here's another guy, Dan La Bastard, who don't even speak our language.
Here's another guy telling you the truth.
In English.
Through an interpreter, of course.
But that great?
Dan La Bastard, you go Dan.
I didn't know the Bastard had it in him.
But it's a great call.
Nice going, Dan.
Danny Boy, Danny and Davy.
Prosecutors refuse rehab deal for Limbaugh and cyst on guilty plea.
I'm not going to read this slide.
I just don't have the voice plus that it's Ponderous anyway.
Tom Beach County prosecutors rejected an overture last month from Marcelinbaugh's attorneys
that would have allowed the conservative commentator to enter drug rehab
rather than face criminal charges for prescribbing drug abuse.
Keep popping him, Rush.
Duff admitted to me he'd tune over to Rush for a minute yesterday.
He was turning back and forth.
To see, see, now that we have our middle-level management people
and this rating book came out which was pretty marginal for QA.
I'm pretty weak.
And boy, wait till you see the next trend.
Oh, it's going to be a scream inducing.
Yeah.
So he was listening to Rush and I said, why?
I want to see you.
Anyway, the prosecutors offered to win the investigation of Limbaugh pleaded guilty
to a single felony for doctor shopping and agreed to a three-year-term appropriation
of the ill-ed Limbaugh's Miami attorney Roy Black called Proposterous yesterday.
The whole story is on the front page of the Sun Central.
If you already wrapped your fish in it, it's on our website, theorrangers.com.
Roy Black wrote to Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer
December 11th asking whether his office investigation could be resolved
by having Limbaugh enter an intervention program that allows drug offenders
to seek treatment and not face criminal convictions.
He has committed, they have evidence, he's committed at least 10 felonies.
And Roy Black says, eh, Yamaha.
So you can read a whole article.
I'm not going to dittle with it.
Just another, you see, the right wingers can do whatever they want.
Of course they can.
Any problem?
He's probably still, he, you know, Wilma was small pathetic.
He's probably got a good supplier right now.
Let us know our name, Rush.
We could use somewhere on here.
What are you smirkin' about?
This is definitely a pill-poppin' kind of place.
Yeah, ask him off, she'll tell you about it.

The Marlin fans are mostly front-running phonies, 47.
Like me, most people don't give a shmit about them, 34.
Soppfort is Bush League, 18.
There are a few real sports fans here, 14, and they need a new stadium.
Eight.
It's gonna be great.
That's what you say, eight.
And don't be late.
So sad.

Here's a great store for you, low-carb peep.
Don't you like it?
I'm a boy, low-carb.
And they've got a worth thousand low-carb.
That sounds good there.
It sounds like we...
Breds and bagels, cookies and crackers, chips and brownies, chocolates, ice cream, pasta with fantastic sauces, ketchup and cheesecakes.
They give you the widest selection anywhere.
I like my roll-pick every day, the week seven days, from 10 to 10.
And anything in the store that you're not too sure of, you can try it before you buy it.
They've got a friendly knowledgeable staff that knows their stuff inside and out.
And they carry all the adkins products always on sale today and every day too.
The low-carb diet is just so popular now that I can't even talk about it.
So head for the number one low-carb sugar-free store in the world, the lights of Westpokka.
Boy, these speakers, man, are just brutal.
On the northeast corner of Glades in 441, right next to Boston Market.
Or column toll free at 1-877 Low-Carb.

That's with the W.

Don't forget there's only one real-delighted Westpokka and it's your official Atkins retail center who's singing a hell of a tune these days.
My life and look all six is four-trial by six-year-old.

How much better I saw now?
What is Hal's mental liftice in my team?
My celestial, my caffeine-free, herb tea, cinnamon, no less?
Mark it up.
Oh yeah, I feel almost too much now.
Time to go home.
Here's a great fact you'll love this.
I was at my favorite pub this past weekend enjoying a couple of pints.
And one of the TV sets was tuned to the new star search with our Cineo Hall.
As they were introducing their panel.
One of the judges turned out to be the anxious Ego Maniac Maddie Lesham from the awful Wami days.
Remember Maddie Lesham?
I don't care.
What a major, major asshole.
Wami, got it.
It's really, still authentically trying to look in for the shaved head and goatee.
I was so disturbed I had to continue drinking until I sounded like the broadcast school guy.
Best facts in here.
I saw him, Pally.
What a great facts.
Or you know who we haven't heard from in quite a while now.
Who that is?
Hi, Pally.
I just mentioned that so we can get him on to the...
Your buddy, the one that...
He'll pretend he's never him.
It's not him on the facts.
It's not him on the phone.
Here's Bob and Atlanta's who says,
How come the Republicans now claim in unison that Howard Dean is too unstable?
To be present because he got his panties into a wad.
How quick they forget that the Republicans were looking into a constitutional amendment
to allow a third term formaled ray gun
who already was exhibiting signs of Alzheimer's before a second term was over.
What's the difference, says Bob and Atlanta's?
Shoopolish.
Better actor.
Right.
Republican.
Right.
Right wing hero.
Ronnie ray gun.
Oh, don't be picking out Ronnie now.
And it was the same trickle-down bullshit, you know.
Same Ronnie ray gun recession.
Same crap.
Although we didn't have anywhere near as many people out of work during ray gun as we have now.
Dying.
Or nearly as many people dying for no reason based on a pile of lies as we do now.
All we had a few illegal things going on, like Iran country.
See, when the Republicans, it's stuff like that.
When Democrats is like, you know, getting blow jobs.
And when the Republicans, it's like, you know, just violating every principle of the Constitution.
Yeah.
Still, blow jobs too.
But we don't need to know.
No blow jobs.
I bet your Henry's hiding it.
Haliburton tells Pentagon, where see here's another one.
Haliburton tells Pentagon workers to kick back toward projects in Iraq.
Now, see no matter what you say, that's why I say it's like preaching to the choir.
I consider and pretend we're going to make a difference and we're not.
It's like the Marlins thing.
See, that poll is so important to me because it is not a sports thing.
I don't care about sports other than, you know, hockey and football.
That's it.
Patriots and the Leafs and Panthers.
But it's about this place.
It's about here.
It's about the people here.
There's something wrong here.
I consider and just suck around.
Oh, this is paradise.
It's not paradise.
It could be.
But there's something wrong with a whole mentality here.
When you live in an area where people hate each other as much as the people here do.
See, the thing with a guy punching the other old guy out at the movie theater.
That was emblematic.
That was just partly symptom of this whole sick place.
Routine.
Hate.
Not just rudeness, but just...
You know, everyone's on the verge and you want to know why.
Because maybe, subliminally, they hate the fact that they're here.
Maybe?
They like the weather.
Like you go out today.
It's not below zero.
Like up north.
It's not freezing.
There's no snow.
Don't have to thought your car.
It's pleasant.
Sunny.
But there's something underlying it.
You can almost smell it.
Can you smell it?
Oh, God.
You can feel it.
Where does it start?
It's the old time you know.
Oh, that.
Yeah.
Oh, the cold.
Oh, yeah.
You mean that?
The hate.
It starts with a bad leadership.
It starts with the newspapers.
The media here sucks.
You got two of the worst goddamn pandering newspapers ever invented.
I mean, just horrendous.
Garbage.
Do you know the Harold and a Sun Sentinel on Sunday?
Each one weighs a whole bunch of pounds.
But third, man.
And there's nothing to read, neither one of them.
Nothing.
I know.
Tree-killing rats.
I will say this for the Sun Sentinel.
They've got so many of those special ad sections in the Sunday paper.
They now, when they deliver your paper, they put it in like an aplastic sack.
Yeah.
Which, by the way, if you put...
It's going to be amazing.
It's going to be amazing.
It's going to be amazing.
It's going to be amazing.

Oh my God.
Hello, Burton Company has told a Pentagon
that two employees took kickbacks
by doing it up to six million dollars
and returned for awarding a Kuwaiti-based company
with lucrative work
supplying US troops in Iraq.
So it says today's very conservative Wall Street Journal.
It's not in some Kami Pinko-leftist publication
it's in today's goddamn Wall Street Journal.
The disclosure is the first firm indication
of correction involving US funded projects in Iraq
and raises new questions about how Burton's dealings there.
The companies work out raising the scrutinized
because of accusations that the US government was overcharged
for gasoline under another controversial contract.
There are much at grave robbers, there are much at crooks,
just like your Vice President and your President.
I'll tell you right now, the biggest crook of them all is Dick.
Yep.
We thought Dick Nixon was the biggest crook.
Crook of Dick.
The chainy is the most crook of Dick in America.
He could probably use some straightening out.
Probably be bad for his ticker, though.
Halibut is strenuously defended in Iraq.
Work is fairly priced and free of taint.
Oh yeah, free of taint.
A discovery of kickbacks could expose the company to hefty fines
and other punishments such as potential fraud charges.
Wow.
At the least a contracting expert say Halibut will be required
to reimburse the money.
And aren't you grateful for that cheap gas, George?
I got a pump hooked up in the house.
Yeah.
It's like a spigot.
The only cheap gas I got is in bed.
Oh yeah, I like that.
Love farting in bed.
That's one of the better people's covers over your head.
No, actually I put my head down underneath the cover.
Oh, that's good.
You fan it out?
Yeah.
I fan the flames.
Here's another fact from Calvin who says,
might take unwisely Clark.
Boy, this is sure becoming a little too political today.
We're trying to use that.
Sports, sports.
We want to make clearance happy to love sports.
I know I talk too much about that.
And we take some heat for it.
But I just, it just never ceases to amaze me.
If I were like you and I hated sports and spectated sports,
there would be a different story.
But I don't.
I've been a sports fan all my life.
But there's such a thing as being a sports fan is being neurotic.
It's like the difference between going to the track last night
and having a nice night and enjoyable time winning a few bucks
or calling somebody on a Tuesday and inviting them to come to the track
and I wouldn't trust that even open.
That would be above and beyond the call of like normalcy.
That would be like 720.
That would be an obsession at 715 in the morning,
also called Derek the same day.
And we'll come up.
Yes.
I mean, Rich, love you.
You're a great guy, but give it a rest.
Okay, calm down.
And the rest of your family, too, please.
Tell your nephew, gambling is for suckers.
Okay?
Go there, have a good time.
Plunge a little bit.
But don't plan on making a living at it.
Calvin says, might take unwisely Clark.
He's not too favorable.
In the debate last night, I didn't see the debate.
It was at the track.
How did it go?
I didn't see it.
I mean, in the debate last night, he had the perfect chance
to level the Bush-Mister on the deserter issue.
Instead, he took a pass.
We need, says.
He's weeny.
Sooner or later, one of the candidates have to get the fact
out of the general public that the supposed commander-in-chief
is a fraud.
I thought I saw somebody saying that, that he was a deserter.
Who said that?
Dracked object.
Not a drag.
He went AWOL for a year.
One of the questions.
Somebody in the crowd, I think, is a little...
No, no.
One of the candidates said that the other day that he went AWOL for a year.
It might have been better than I'd say, because I'm not sure.
They did.
They had the cones to say it.
Somebody will tell us.
Also, Clark took a swipe at Curie for joining the veterans
against the war organization when he got back from Vietnam.
I'm a Vietnam vet too, doing the same organization.
Like the war in Vietnam, was a good thing?
No.
I think Clark is a cryptomere public in heart and can't be trusted
since Calvin.
And he might just have a good point.
Let's do it.
You don't have to be lucky when your car's on.
If you want to play Russian, you will have to be my guest.

Hi, this is Middle-Age, Pasty White Fat Man and Cod Man, Dr. Phil Quick Draw McRaw.
I want to thank each and every one of you for running up and buying my diet book.
And hey, I got good news.
I have a new book for you to give to your cash for.
It's called Dr. Phil's Hair Growth System.
Now you can tell by looking at my head that I've kept a goodly amount of hair around the sides.
And I'm going to tell your husbands just how they can keep it there too.
Now one of the many things you're going to learn in this book is having your husband look in the mirror while it's head of the tween your legs.
They don't trim for several weeks so he can have a nice triangle on his head.
Why, he'll look 10 years younger.
If you find it all right here in my new book, Dr. Phil's Hair Growth System.
With the very special forward by the late James Coco.
Maybe that's where Mo got that piece.
It's 1103 at 560 WQM, so clearance just came in our program director who's trying very hard.
He really is. He's not knowing that very hard, but he's trying very hard.
And he actually said something that had nothing to do with sports.
Yeah, I was shocking. Mark it down.
Mark it on the counter. Clarence talked politics.
He said I think it was Wesley Clark. I mean Michael Morris said that.
And Michael Moore has said that about Bush being a wall many times.
And I was wrong also. But nice try clearance because it had nothing to do with sports.
So going in fact, I got a new great new set of promos.
Can you imagine how good QM would be if we didn't have so much sports talk on?
They're already on order. Wouldn't that be great?
Can you imagine that if Mad Dog and Hank and Joe Rose talked about like Titty bars and getting laid and I often imagined food and it's fun stuff like that.
Don't I mean like that?
And then I wake up. Yeah. Without losing the license, how much fun I would be as opposed to the dolphins and the draft and the draft and the dolphins?
J. Feeder.
Oh, no, I forget about him. He's ancient history. You better get with it.
But I was wrong. It wasn't one of the candidates.
Now see, I will give Dr. Dean high marks for that. He didn't pull any punches.
That's why he rolled up his sleeves. Unlike the guy that movie theater, he didn't pull any punches.
But I don't think he actually went that far. It was Paul the Gala on Crossfire said that.
I see.

I get good profit from being the thief of the efforts
to find the claim.
Im droite chose the name of the thief of the Navy document.
I finally had Kia facilities.
So, I realized I wanted to have a deal with it.
I Prince tie skiing.
news or entertainment. Anybody? Ralph or Anne and we're talking about real
shows. Don't be mentioned in my show on Wami. I'm not looking for ass sucking. I
hate that. You know what I mean? Somebody would do that. No. Anybody like that
show needed mental help. Ralph Renek, John Hammbrick, Skipper Chauzank, Rick Sanchez,
Ann Bishop, Wayne Chandler, Dave Dixon. That's what we got so far. Now are you
adding those on there? Yes, I'm maddy. There are. Eric doesn't have to be... he
can just watch your hand. Great job on that thing. You did the extended project. Excellent job.
He really did. And he's overhauling a whole bunch of other things. We're not new. He is the best. Of course,
he has been the best. No, he is. Oh, and what ever happened with the other deal with Josh,
with the computer stuff. We're still waiting for all the chips to land there in that
department. So what's going to happen? Probably. It's not done definite deal, but probably. How's that? Yeah.
Well, I have to make arrangements for you to get that laptop that I bought for Beener Boy. Also,
yeah. God. You know, the last thing I heard Beener Boy say was, here's the appool we got up
there now. I'm not going to be able to rehire it in any way. Because you call them for a
minute. Because I'm an old softie. Yeah. I know. Just like the day I talked to Mo here last
day this earlier in a week. And I repent. I apologize for that. Was it this week or last week?
Last week. Last time is your flying. Two weeks is too much. Way too much. Never happened again.
What do you think? Why do you think the world champion Marlins have sold so few less than 5,000
season tickets? That's our first poll on eorages.com. Hop on it. 212 votes. That's Eureka Kotfer,
New York. Their fans are mostly front running phonies. 79. Front running phonies. They are. Full of crap.
What's the next bandwagon we can hop on? Come on. If the dolphins get hot, if the heat gets hot,
hot heat. Like me, most people don't give a shmit about them. 62 of you say that. You don't give a shmit.
And your entitled. That was my vote. I don't care about the Marlins. I don't care about baseball.
Nope. South Florida is Bushley 29. There are a few real sports fans here. 24 and boy,
that is positively. Absolutely correct. It's a horse in Buggie Town. I know we've been over
this a million times. But boy, Daniel Bastard's column got me whipped up into a frenzy. Almost.
Almost want to wipe my ass with it. And they need new stadium 18. That's why you're not showing up.
It's too hot. It rains. The town of excuses. And let me say it again. The Macarena man,
that place. Why they make up those bogus attendance is all over the NHL. I have no idea. They're not
fooling anybody. They don't just do it here. They do it anywhere. Tickets distributed.
When you can open up a window and throw a thousand an hour. Oh, we distribute a thousand
to tickets. 30,000 tickets. Of course, it only holds 19 to 50. But we distribute 30,000 tickets. We
open up the window, not the window. And nobody showed up. They were for free. Nobody showed up.
I'll be god damn. Must be something about this place. Too many old people. The myth of the Cuban
love of baseball. That's one of the big myths with the whole Marlin thing. So full of crap.
I heard some call. I was at Hancock, a mad dog. I guess they call it again about the
Oh, and Pudge Rodriguez. The Cubans loving a bullcrap. That's
racist. I don't know what to do. Crap. Garbage. Plus, he's not Cuban anyway. Right. Any
of you? Some kind of recon. Is he a recon? He's a recon. I think you're right with a big fat ass.
Well, take your fat ass and get lost. Okay. Go punch packing. Go back to Detroit. You'll love it
there, man. Sucks. How many white people in Detroit? That's enough. 10 after 11 at 5.60. QAM.

A screaming alien as he drove away,
Cos they were never waiting me.
He grabbed the flight to Vegas,
And hit all the strip clubs.
Girls were crevping his friends,
They were given battle at the dance,
He was high leveled of freaking cops.
They said, bye to the punks,
And she, well, I'm pronounced.
A screaming alien as he drove away,
Cos they were never waiting me.
He grabbed the flight from the time they made a jersey,
And she had a head in her palm.
Welcome.
I was saying that she was a couple,
Was touching feeling like the whole mess was a big damn bomb.
Battle has to go, you messed up call.
Bins it back to the punks,
And she went off and down.
They're all done by the way.
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.
No, I was thinking more like,
Like,
That's what that was.
I can't imagine who put that in there.
Probably some retard.
Probably some crazy person.
What's it called?
It's called, I don't know.
It's called Ben and JLo.
Okay.
They're done as anybody here.
No.
So it's hard to them.
Just go away. Don't you understand?
You cause it, Fag.
I mean, just go away.
I already had stopped with a funny baloney crap.
And your movie is sucked by the way.
All of his movie without her, I guess,
Is doing pretty good.
Did he have a movie here recently without her?
I don't know.
Just ditch the bitch, Ben.
That's all ditch the bitch.
Go back to Matt.
ditch the bitch.
Here's one for our poll today by Fax from Al.
Thank you Al.
Good choice.
MT Graves from the original WKYD channel 51.
Charlie Baxter.
MT Graves.
There you go.
We're putting his real name or the character name.
MT Graves.
Okay.
And what about...
Oh, we got Dave Dixon, right?
From the original channel 51.
Those were the days, baby, from Pirate World in Dania.
Back when they had the nude beach in Dania.
Back when we had all kinds of stuff going on a four-letter day.
I've been there.
Back when it was like living and breathing fun people here.
Before all the old parts moved in.
And all the people came in on a rubber rafts.
Do it.
Hell with a fit-down.
Do it.
Hell with a fit-down.
Take the hell and stick them.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get some choices for the poll here.
56670560.
Because we're going to start doing it at noon.
Pound 560 on a 18 and T.
And Verizon Wireless Line.
Shall we?
Shall we plow in them?
WQIM.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
How you doing?
Oh, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay.
I have a Glenn Rinker for your poll.
Glenn Rinker is good.
Isn't he dead?
I don't know, but...
I think he had died in Orlando or somewhere.
I was watching the shining last night.
There's a little clip of him in the shadows.
Right.
That's right.
Channel 10 is on.
That's right.
Good choice.
Okay.
Thanks, Pally.
Have a great weekend.
Is it, Anne, also on that little clip of this one?
Channel 10.
I witness news.
Glenn with one or two ends, Rinker.
One.
Oh, come on.
Who cares.
He's dead anyway.
I'm pretty sure.
Who's the other guy from Channel 10?
Ron.
We go through that every time.
Ron Hunter.
Remember him?
No.
Oh, he's dead.
Now, one of them committed suicide in Orlando.
I think I might have been Glenn Rinker.
A lot of short people commit suicide, George.
Yeah, well, the guy from Family Feud.
What was his name?
Uh-huh.
Combs.
Ray Combs.
Are they Villaches?
Ray Combs and some people comb over, like me.
Are they Villaches committed suicide?
See, I don't know.
I didn't know that.
Till this day, I didn't know that.
Really?
No.
Yeah, I couldn't handle it anymore.
He was a prick for a while.
Was he?
Yeah, miserable.
Oh, there's nothing worse than a short prick.
And Ray Combs.
And who else did we just say?
Glenn Rinker.
I think he committed suicide.
Maybe we were Ron Hunter.
A lot of them guys.
He used to be on Channel 10.
I would.
His news.
I wouldn't have seen that.
He's a good people here on TV.
They don't last too long.
They stick around a lot.
What about David Bloom, Rest in Peace?
Don't know him.
Oh, the dough.
Yeah.
Well, he was embedded and now he's dead.
Right.
That's what he was about to put him on the room.
Sure, he was at a channel six year for a long time.
He's a good guy.
David Bloom died for another guy.
That for no reason at all.
Absolutely, positively.
Too many dead people.
It's worth it.
No, it's not.
The president says it's worth it.
I see.
WQA.
Hello.
I had a great line for that, but I can't use it.
560.
560.
0.560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon wireless line.
WQA.
Hello.
OK.
Why don't we have a short fuse today?
That's Friday.
How come the kids are out of school today?
They don't know.
They are.
They are, yeah.
The final is that it?
Yeah.
So maybe nobody's in town.
WQA.
Hello.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
How about the...
Is this Neil?
Yes, sounds like me.
Hey, how about the floor closure?
Well, that's 100 years ago.
OK.
You think so?
On channel seven, right?
That's even before I came here.
About Wayne Ferris.
Blue, I had Wayne...
Hahaha.
Hahaha.
We're not talking about who you have the hotspour, OK?
Wayne Ferris.
We can put him on there.
OK.
Is it a horror?
Cloramosure?
Claire.
Claire, Cloram, I think it's Cloram.
I don't know.
I don't know how to spell Mojure.
He won't mind if we misspell it.
Sam and Glenn Wrenker.
Pretty sure they're both dead.
See, it's OK if you misspell somebody that they're dead.
I didn't spell Mojure.
M-O-S-A-T-E-R.
Mojure.
Just like Gary Mojure, who couldn't drive his finger up his butt up the track.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and Mark Mojure.
Another stiff.
Pound 5, 60 on an AT&T.
And Ferris and wireless line.
And there's something with the phone here.
Is this phone screwed up?
Maybe not.
Maybe it's just us.
Nobody QA him, hello?
Hey!
Yes, sir.
Jackie Johnson.
Jackie Johnson.
There you go.
Don't keep coming.
All right. Thanks, Pat.
You bet.
Jackie Johnson.
Got it.
We're getting about 100 names on here for this.
I like this poll.
Let's say something good about somebody.
Okay?
So just rip it in an ass.
Aaaaah!
Tired of that.
Always getting this crap about how I'm so negative.
Trying to say something good about some people who were good here.
And then they got out while they're getting was good.
Here's that first poll, baby.
Why do you think the world champion, Marlins, has sold so few less than 5,000 season tickets,
fewer than the frickin buffalo bisons, triple A baseball, minor league team,
and the Sacramento, Queen B's, whatever they are.
250 votes.
Their fans are mostly front running phonies, 99 out of 257.
Like me, most people don't give a shmit about them.
71 of you said that.
Don't give a shmit.
South Florida's Bush League, 34.
There are a few real sports fans here, 34.
And they need a new stadium, 19.
I love that last part of LeBaptured's Colombo.
He talks about Detroit, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh.
All the new stadiums in the world aren't putting any,
I mean, not making the teams any better, more competitive,
and are not putting any asses in the seats.
If a championship, if a champion, can't appreciably increase and sustain interest,
why would a new building?
And you are absolutely correct.
I never thought I would live to say it on the air about Daniel LeBaptured.
Finally, he put his thumb right on it.
That's what we're saying, Ches, was talking about yesterday,
putting his thumb right on it.
And even Kim Bo-Kampard this morning, made a very good point, a political point.
You ready for that?
I bet your clearance probably sneaked in, and it's an O'Neill's pretty pissed off.
Too much of this goddamn sport.
Say something about the president.
Sports!
Yeah, too much that.
You know, Bush spent a couple of minutes talking about athletes and steroids,
yes, in his speech.
And his bow said, as Bush said,
with all these people dying in Iraq, with so many people out of work,
with all of the major problems with the environment, with all these species dying,
all of the crap going on in the world.
And this asshole president talks about sports, about toe-cold steroids,
and his Paul Begalla pointed out accurately yesterday when he was the owner of the Texas Rangers,
and when steroid use was rampant, who did they acquire?
Jose Cansoco, the steroid king and queen himself.
And they all knew what was going on in all the owners, including Bush looked the other way.
Now of course, because he's got to be the goody-two shoes, commander, and thief.
We're not going to have no-no blow jobs in a White House, and those steroids in a locker room.
See, in Florida, we got Reverend Bush, is the governor.
Reverend Bush, right.
Everything now is with religion.
And then of course, he also talked about the faith-patient-based initiative.
They should have gotten up and booed him right off the stage,
but they don't have any balls.
That's a problem.
See, if the Democrats we do run over, they're going to have to do what Howard Dean did, not lose it.
But they're going to have to roll up your sleeves.
Right. Just like Ross Piro said, roll up your sleeves and do-do-do.
And I'll break you and take you to that, though.
Not like that.
You liked it?
I saw it again, like, 500 times since then.
Yeah.
And I, you liked it?
And then I'm going to go, ah!
Well, that's beside me.
I'm going to go, ah!
Okay.
I think you just charged the White House.
People want to be pissed off and tell him the truth, and just ripping him and ass, which he doesn't-
Just like move on, dot org, as much as I appreciate their efforts.
They whipped out apologizing for the Hitler and Bush ads.
There was nothing wrong with those ads.
They were honest.
And nothing to apologize about.
They make absolutely nothing to apologize for.
Oh, well, we don't want to be associated with that.
They were over the line.
No, they were not.
They were right on top.
Right.
Can't be honest in America no more.
Give it a Q-A-M.
Hello.
Steve Rotted Arrow.
Okay. Steve Rotted.
Don't put it down, though.
Because that was the guy.
Yes.
That was that asshole.
Yes.
See, you don't get to vote.
You don't get to make selections on a poll because your voice is so obvious.
You're such an asshole.
You're such a quizzling, man.
I'll just touch the poll.
Yeah.
Jackass.
WQA-M, hello.
Chambot.
Like I said, back at you.
WQA-M, hello.
My law police ass rojo.
5670560.
Pound 560.
I don't think we're going to have billed this list.
I don't think we got anybody out there, anybody here.
WQA-M, hello.
Okay.
I don't want to lose your audience, but I'd like to talk to you with you just for a moment.
30 seconds.
Time's up.
Why does this organization down here find losing and buy one, get one free seats?
Why did they find that acceptable?
Ask them.
Ask them.
Because it's not acceptable.
No, it is not.
But blowing six or seven, three goal leads in a season is not acceptable.
And every time a hair piece gets on after the game, all he says is how great his team does.
Yeah.
You see not watching with everybody else?
He can't say how bad his hair pieces because it's worse even than most.
My hair is smitten, can't add George.
Can add, asshole.
George, you're picking on you.
Thanks.
It's a bush league organization.
Okay, it's all I can tell you.
They talk a good game.
The youngsters in the organization, and all this other crap.
You know what people are tired of waiting.
And like I said yesterday, season ticket holders are tired of getting gouged and paying gigantic bucks.
And then seeing tickets going two for one and two for none.
And the 10 freebies here in ten.
It's a joke.
If you have a great steakhouse, you don't say, oh, we're going to give you two steaks for one today.
Can you imagine it?
It was Chris.
Yeah.
And if that ain't good enough, how about what do you do?
How about two free ones?
All right.
I can imagine it.
I'm just envisioning now.
I can see the first person to be online for the free steaks at Ruth Chris.
If it's free, it's me.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, oh, oh.
He'd be standing outside, tapping his toe, waiting for them to open at the right.
I can just see it.
I can envision it now.
5.67, they don't like our polo today I guess.
Or else there's nobody out there.
Look kind of slim to me this morning.
Every time the kids are out of school, it's the same thing.
Why don't you warn me?
I can stay at home and slept in this morning.
Exactly.
I don't want to do a show talking to myself.
You have ten people out there.
Yeah.
Seven people ringing the phone.
Well, that no six.
One of them might be real.
You think?
Chamba?
So what about who did that guy say that asshole?
What do you say Steve?
I think I...
Steve Rondonero.
No, I'm not saying we ought to put him on there.
He won't get any votes.
In fact, you know what?
I think it was Steve Rondonero.
26 past 11 at 5.60 QAM.
My!
And look all.
Six is 4.2560.
QA, QA.
Good.
Now, from the channel 10, I witness me.
I guess that's a QAM.
Hey, where's he going?
What's he doing with that machine gun?
Oh my god.
Quick, quick, get him into the light.
He was fed up with reading one story after another
about drugs and violence.
Now, she wants to write the rules and rewrite the news.
In and fall.
Starring and vicious.
Don't kill me, please.
I'll see you tonight at 5.6011.
God.
And boom.
She took the news into her old hands.
What are you going to do with me?
When I get through with you, there won't be enough of you left
to make a good suitcase for Don No.
And boom.
Starring and vicious.
Also, starring Carl Wethers is doing blood and ale.
And Don No says Don No.
There's a stationary.
Run over the Midwest.
And boom.
She rewrote the news.
And home.
Going round.
And the Dwight says he still tastes really good.
11.32.
What do you make him face this for, man?
I'm promising.
At 5.60 WQM.
There was a lot there, man.
There was a lot of meat on that bone.
NBC dumps Best Comedy Ever Friends ad.
Well, thank God for that.
Says, okay, maybe Friends isn't the best comedy ever.
NBC promised yesterday not to be run a promo.
It sounds like here.
A lot of people promising not to be run promos that are offensive.
Okay.
Using that phrase to refer to the show which will go off here after 10 years in May.
They were just trying to hype it when overboard.
NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Mark said it ran once and it won't run again.
Just like Clarence said this morning.
You what he said when I told him about them promos?
The ad hurt some people most prominently Kelsey Grammer star a phraser.
Five times the Emmy winner for Best Comedy.
Friends is one of the Emmy once.
In addition to which neither show could lick all of the family's ass.
Right.
Or the Jefferson's or I'm sure a Zayn other comedy shows.
Correct.
Right.
I can't blame them for saying that Grammer told reporters last week,
although he'd all know it's not true.
And you're not either.
Kelsey.
And watch your grammar.
5.607.
05.60.
Pound 5.60 on it.
There's no interest in this poll today.
Pertrenut.
See anyone in a while because it's something positive.
It's proof.
Here's the facts though.
We're getting better suggestions on a fax machine and on the phone.
My suggestion for your second poll is the biggest bitch ever on my TV.
Jilla Unruh.
You know who that is?
Jilda Unruh.
Unruh?
Jilda Jilda.
Jilda Unruh.
You are.
It says Jilda.
Is it Jilda?
I think it's Jilda.
Well, Jilda the Lily man.
I don't know how to say it.
This is makes all the local guys on TV look like whims.
And it also says you should have a poll sometime.
A favorite local TV reporter.
So many have moved on to the network.
David Bloom, rest in peace.
Steve Kroff, Michael Wim.
Now we're not going to do that.
And it's too narrow.
How do you spell Unruh before you tear that up?
You and R.U.H.
Got it?
Get it.
5.607.
05.60.
Pound 9 are going.
Fones are in a little bit.
We'll get to you.
What?
What are you laughing about?
I don't like that.
I grabbed something out of Florida.
I'm just taking my time.
It's an important facts.
I was about to do Willie Nelson saw, which we would play today,
but we can't find it.
Or we found it, but it was too late.
Yeah, too late.
And it's, and we'll play it sometime.
It's still plenty of time tomorrow.
Yeah, tomorrow show.
Now line one never hangs on because it disconnects real fast.
WQM dial tone.
Like I said, the dial tone would have been better.
WQM, hello.
Good morning, Neil.
How you doing?
OK.
I'm fine.
I don't have a vote for the poll, but I just found out something.
I'm going home to New York City in April.
Yeah.
And I'm going to a seminar.
And the keynote speaker that closes is Michael Moore.
Excellent.
Yeah, so I'm really looking forward to that.
And I'm going to see what he has to say.
But I'm going to get a copy of the tape.
And I'll bring him back a present when I come home from New York.
Outstanding.
You have yourself a wonderful day.
And came up with a good work.
Thank you.
There you go.
56070560, Tom 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Who is your favorite all time?
Soft Florida TV personality.
Newsperson entertainment person, whatever they might have been.
Kitty show.
Got a good list.
We'll get that up at noon.
We'll get it up.
We'll go see Alice.
WQAM.
C'mon.
WQAM, hello.
Wow.
They are good.
I'm telling you, there's nobody here.
WQAM, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, I think in recognition of Marino getting with the dolphins,
you should play Jimmy and Danny.
No, I don't think so.
We already been to all of that.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes.
How about Morris McLemore?
Oh, no, I can't forget about it.
You know, Morris McLemore.
And they're all you old people that have been here a hundred years.
Get out of here.
Been dead for 50 years.
George is rolling his eyes.
Never heard of it.
Well, it's because he's just like Claire Mosier.
There's people around here a hundred years ago.
Come on.
Give us somebody that's with some meat on it.
Okay.
With some meat on a bowl.
What's wrong with you people?
God.
You're about as much fun as playing Russian Ruler with a fully loaded piece.
Sounds good to me, mom.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
This has nothing to do with talent, really, but Penny Daniel.
Penny Daniel.
Yeah.
Well, now, see that bring back some memories.
Yeah.
Not good ones either.
Well, I can understand that, but you wouldn't, you wouldn't understand that.
No, I would.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
I wouldn't understand it.
No, I don't, I don't get any of that straight ass stuff.
What?
Just that gay ass.
Just that gay ass, yeah.
And then there's always ANS at.
Bracka Moo.
What says gay ass?
He said stay away from that thing.
He's got dibs on it.
Their friends are mostly from running phone.
They're only on the 19 of you say that.
That's why the Marlins aren't doing Schmidt for a season tickets.
For running phoneies, one 19.
See, they don't, they're pissed off.
They don't like this because they're taking a shot at this town.
And accurately so well deserved 305 votes.
Like me, most people will give a shmit about the Marlins 88.
South Voters Bush League 39.
There are a few real sports fans here, 39.
And they need a new stadium, 20.
And maybe they need a new announcer.
You're gonna put that on there too.
Maybe Booog should be doing a whole game instead of Dave and boring.
See, this station, there are a lot of people, and even, even, for real, when he was here.
Talked to a good game.
Ah, but, you know, but when I try to get him to really say something about people, he wouldn't do it.
Right?
In other words, if he coveted their wife or their hair piece or whatever it was.
Oh, but he's a nice guy.
Yeah.
Who cares?
He's a gack, he's a nice guy.
He sucks.
He blows.
His work is grotesque.
Okay?
Okay.
You can think of many, many, very nice people whose work isn't incompetent.
We're in the wrong business.
I mean, Donald Brainer might be a very nice guy.
If they attract, he couldn't, he couldn't find his way to the finish line with a compass in a road map and a search party.
With Caminwala's riding shotgun.
He still couldn't find his way there.
I mean, just because somebody is nice doesn't mean you have to cover for their, you know, inadequacies.
Oh, excellent.
WQA, I'm Hello.
Hey, Leo, what's up, man?
Yes, sir.
Everybody's talking about the Patriarch ending next year, the Patriarch?
Yes.
The Brady Bill.
It ends this year.
Yeah.
Tom Brady Bill.
Tom Brady Bill, the one that releases the inhibitions on the guns that they tend to round limit on the systems.
I mean, it's like, and some Democrats raising holy hell about it.
I mean, they're talking about what the Patriarch had.
I said, take care of what ends this year first.
Sir, I'm a lot more worried about the Patriarchs right now, but I'm the Patriarchs, okay, and have a nice weekend.
I don't want to do light bulb radio here today, okay?
Then we won't have any audience.
What's wrong with you, people?
I mean, this is a good guy we talked to him before, but just calm down.
The people here are not in any of this.
They don't know from it.
They don't want to know from it.
They don't care.
The intellectual capacity here is like that of a P.
So just forget about it.
That's why there's so much stress here.
Too up.
Yeah, stop being so uptight, all you people.
Just relax.
We're living in paradise.
It's paradise.
Be a little more friendly, a little more laid back instead of always being angry.
You know what I'm saying?
Always like unleashed.
Yeah.
In fact, he should come down here and do that.
Hey, there you go.
Then he'd be amongst people who could relate.
Because everybody here, every day they want to just put their head out the window like a network and go,
Right.
Don't you?
I do.
Wow.
I don't just want to, but I do do.
I was speaking to do do, they're showing duty on TV.
I'm actually still can't get over that.
Channel four under the guise of news.
Yeah.
Right.
They're showing crap.
Kitty crap on here.
Because it's a news story.
We're news.
No, you just want to, you just want to put some duty on here.
It's all.
Channel four news.
Not only don't they speak English, but they put duty on here.
Twenty till noon at 560.
Q.A.M.
My life and look all.
This is 420560.
You wait, you wait.
Miami.
But the perfect time turned you into an e-grove.
Way for water, yell, channeled in useless news.
For me tonight, for a channel 10 under the covers report of the dangers of achieving a golden time.
Plus, the dangers of redcrumb build up in your toaster.
Channel 10 Doppler Weather.
With channel 12 meteorologist John Matthews.
Here's the latest on Florida's deadly drought.
Another beautiful day of sunshine comes your way.
Ho ho ho ho.
Then join Christy Kruger for part seven of her special report on the safety of lactation suction devices.
Channel 10 News.
You through snows, you can't use.
It's on 45.
Let's put white water down there.
We're not going to wait.
Can't.
We're not going to wait till somebody sees ungrateful bastards calling.
How many years has he been on there?
About third man.
I agree.
I realize he used to be more popular when he had the mustache.
But Anne forced him to cut it off.
She did.
It's as she said, it's chafed.
She made him shave it off.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
Here's the list we got so far.
And obviously the interest in this is phenomenal.
Well, that's okay.
We know that you don't want to say anything good about anybody because you're a bunch of relentless heartless bastards.
Who are all of the people I'd call in on the sports shows?
This was great.
It was classic.
I'm driving home yesterday.
Mad Dog gets a call.
I just a suckhole.
Oh, Mr. Manage, it's such an honor to speak to you when I was down at the field during the
Dolphin's Menderic game, whatever game it was.
And I wanted to come over to say hi, but I didn't have the balls to do it.
And Jim says, well, next time you know, we'll come by and say hi.
And he goes on with whatever his point was or his question.
And Manage hangs up on him and rips him for an idiotic call.
That was great.
As only the mad dog would do.
Oh, right.
See because he's not into that ass suckin' either.
People groveling, oh, Mr. Manage, it's such an honor to speak to you.
Why?
Why is that?
That ring.
But do you know anybody would be an honor to speak to them?
Seriously.
Can I get back to you?
Right.
That's my point.
I mean, there are people like Michael Moore.
I enjoy sitting around, having a few meal with them.
Be pleased to meet them.
Right.
I don't know about honor.
I'm honored to meet them.
I can't think of any such person.
Do I get to touch them?
I be.
Wow.
Oh, okay.
Well, that's different to me.
Tom Brady.
I'd be honored to meet Tom.
He's a macho guy like me.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Live.
So negative, so sour, so full of hate.
Mean.
This is a mean place.
And this building, I think, is a perfect example of it.
With a disease, it's a mean, mean nasty building.
It's hateful and hostile.
People in banging each other when this building, all the stuff that goes on in here, just waiting for my way back.
That's an angry building with angry stories.
You can smell it in the hallway.
You smell it?
Oh, that's most vague.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.
I feel like I should have stayed home today.
Yesterday I had, you know, did okay.
Today.
Well, it's just the mood, didn't it?
You're a ailment.
What do you mean by this?
It's sour.
I'm not in a sour mode.
They are.
Okay.
They don't want to play the game today.
Sam, loosen it.
Play howie.
W-D-Q-A-M.
Mr. Rogers, it's an honor to speak with you.
All right.
It sure is.
I got an aim for you and she's one of your favorites too.
Kelly Craig.
Kelly Craig.
All right.
Great lady.
Okay.
Tell her to loosen weight.
Thanks a lot.
Kelly Craig.
Haven't seen her in a long time.
That's because I don't want to see her.
Why not?
She's quadruples inside.
Ooh, yeah.
Why?
She used to look like horse and wells.
She had to look like five of them.
She had that baby and she beefed up and like most ladies do.
But she kept beefing up.
See most women, you know, after that they lose it back.
But not her.
She found herself.
You can barely see her head.
No, come on.
It's lost.
I'm telling you, it looks like the button on a plush couch, her head.
That's bad.
Is she fatter than like the Humper?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She is?
Oh, man.
I'm telling you, you can name.
Wow.
Seriously?
I can't even do it.
Like a turtle.
In other words, like she pulls her head out.
That's bad.
We're going to be killing it.
Kelly, please, lose it on its Kelly.
Please, I'm begging you, we love you.
WQA, I'm Hello.
Quantum cap driver.
Where is he?
See?
What does that mean?
I don't know.
He's just in coherent.
Right.
Just an asshole.
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
WQA, I'm Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I feel so privileged to speak to you.
Yeah.
It's all right.
Right at the end.
I give kudos to showtime.
Put in your diary.
Because yesterday they were given DC 9-11, the whole thing after 9-11 and the Bush administration.
The best part of the whole show was when I'm Candelita walking into the room.
Yeah.
It was so hilarious.
She was so ugly and skinny and dark.
Yeah.
Was she dark?
And another for the poll.
I don't know if you remember back the Kendall Toyota show.
Yes, I do.
I'm fortunate.
Rockdown the radio was the bomb.
I used to love that man.
Don Cox.
Okay.
Thank you.
You got him, man.
Thank you.
Ostech, hey, you're me.
This Don Cox, Reston, please.
For a lot of dead people.
I thought he was going to say, Mark, what's his name, Jacobson?
No, he was not.
He would have been lying.
Why do you say that?
To be a prick.
I mean, somebody says something nice about Cox on a radio.
Right.
Who died very early this soon.
Who deserved to die?
Is that what you did?
No, who deserved to be on the poll?
George Rudry is just said that Don Cox deserved to die.
I think that is of all the things that you've ever said all these years.
Party.
Yeah.
I can't believe you said that.
One of the originals.
Just El Fernandez.
Oh, we loved her.
She was a fine, fine lady in more ways than one.
Didn't she play the violin?
Oh, that was just all Mackenzie.
She's El Fernandez.
I loved her.
Wasn't she on a show with who was on the show with Jimmy Cifalus?
On Channel 10 there for Wiley.
He had me on the show.
And back in the Wednesdays.
Jimmy Cifalus.
Bob, it's that she's got some stories.
No, not just nothing.
Jimmy.
Okay.
Oh, here's my friend Mark again.
The chronic factor.
Good factor.
But Mark, I hope you're not going to load me up with a thousand.
Widow of Dr. Atkins.
Oh, that.
Mark is always good.
You're the best factor ever, Mark.
Like I said, Mark with a B.
Did you see the piece on Mayor Bloomberg, who's a major asshole by the way, who's in the
Nicole's, he's like, he's going to say, I hate him.
They despise him.
The comments about Atkins.
You didn't see that clip?
No.
Oh, wow.
It was one of those photo ops where he knew they were shooting, but I guess he forgot.
Well, they didn't forget.
New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg thought his off-the-cuff dinner comments about the late
Dr. Robert Atkins were just between him and a few firefighting pals, but the cameras were
rolling and now he might be wishing he had his mouth full, like maybe a stake.
Between bites of pasta at a Brooklyn Firehouse dinner, Bloomberg dismissed to be ported details
of Atkins death.
I don't believe that Bolshmit that Atkins dropped it off sliding something on the sidewalk.
Bloomberg said to the firefighters during dinner earlier this week.
They showed it.
They showed a clip.
It was, I can't even describe to you.
Atkins would also say she was beside herself with anger once she saw the footage.
I was very, very hurt and I was angry at consent at ABC News Good Morning America.
Atkins died last year at 72 from head injury sustained in the fall on an icy New York City sidewalk.
Atkins low carb diet, which stresses protein over pasta bread and fruit, has remained wildly
popular even after his death.
Veronica atkins said her husband's high protein diet had nothing to do with the fall that killed him.
His arteries were clear.
He died from severe trauma to the head she said.
During his firehouse dinner, the mayor also called the diet guru fat, which he was not,
and insulted the food act conservative.
A fundraiser he attended a few years ago at the doctor's house in the Hamptons.
Oh yeah, he said I was crap.
You couldn't even eat it.
It was just it was unbelievable.
What a guy.
Yeah.
It would be like if you were running for president, you know what I'm saying?
And you thought nobody was listening and you started screaming like,
like that.
And you thought nobody was rolling any footage.
And you just start losing it and doing, you know,
grotesque, unacceptable things that you thought nobody would ever see.
We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.
We're going to California and Texas and New York.
We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.
And then we're going to Washington, DC to take back the White House.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
One more.
Come on.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Mrs. Atkins said the mayor's comments took a by surprise since he had sent a beautiful note about her husband and the work he did after he died last year.
Phony, you have to tell sorry to me in the world she said.
How pathetic.
Just ripped him an ass about how the guy was all bullshit about how he invited him to his house.
The food was crap.
It was garbage.
You couldn't even eat it.
I'm sure.
I mean, I mean, who would want like steak and lobster stuff like that?
Yeah.
Nasty.
Things like that.
Lobster dipped in butter.
Asshole.
Michael Bloomberg is a major, major asshole.
Absolutely.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
He even liked it reelected by the way.
Mark it down.
No chance.
A market day.
Two chances none and less than none.
If they brought back fear relo laguardia.
Just if they just propped up his body.
I'm telling you.
If they brought back John Lindsay, he's needed to.
I'm sure he is.
I think he's dead.
WQA, I'm hello.
Even Ed Crouch would be, I'm a pretty sure.
WQA, I'm hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Charlie Baxter.
We already got it.
You already got him.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Shall we put Charlie Baxter?
Yeah.
Cross out empty graves.
Put Charlie Baxter.
Hey Eric, how do I take stuff off of you?
Like I said.
Well, I put Charlie Baxter.
Yeah.
Well, you can't even both.
We'll take off empty graves.
We don't want to distort the pool.
It's so goddamn scientific and very, very important.
It is.
It's important stuff.
How's that other one coming?
Let's wrap that sucker up.
And I realize it's a little bit too sports intensive for this audience.
But I'll say it again.
It's not really about sports.
It's about anything here.
It's about this place.
And the lack of motivation, the lack of excitement, the lack of intensity.
What do they care about?
Early bird dinners and when's the funeral and where's my pollen and the, you know, and who can I bitch out?
Who can I get angry at?
Who can I scream at?
Why do you think the world champion Florida Marlins has sold so few less than 5,000 season tickets?
A disgrace.
What are the words that the Dan LaBacher uses again in a column?
He said it's the pressing, unfathomable, inexplicable, damning, and probably without precedent in major American sports.
To win the world championship and have fewer season tickets sold than the anxious and soon-to-be extinct Montreal Expos, the Buffalo Spiesens of the AAA, whatever it is.
Internationally, credible, shocking.
139 people say the fans here are mostly front-running phonies.
38.6%.
Like me, most people don't give a shmit about them. 103.
Don't care.
Also about 30%.
About 30, man.
South Florida's Bush League 49.
There are a few real sports fans here. 46.
They need a new state in 23.
I just want to say one of the things and then I'll drop that whole deal.
Because we're changing the pool.
About this whole sports business.
See, I tried to explain to Duffinclerance this morning.
Neither one of whom is going to ever win any, you know, brownie points for being a rocket scientist.
I tried to explain to them sports talk is neurocasting.
WFA in New York, which is the most successful sports station in America is driven by old, flutty-duty, I'mus.
What a comment.
Yeah.
He drives the station.
His ratings, which aren't that great, but nevertheless, and his revenue drive WFA in.
He's the enabler, which allows them to do all their sports craft the rest of the day.
Here.
Here, it's me.
But setting that aside.
The fact of the matter is that if it was only the sports part of it, WRFX would have big numbers.
Do they?
No.
The fan down here, the WAFN, 1800 on your dial.
That one had a good number.
No.
No.
If you would, if you would take the same crap that they have on WRFX and replace the personalities on this station with that,
we would have any numbers either.
No.
See what I'm saying?
Oh, I see what you're saying.
I mean, when you got Jim Mandage and you got Hank Goldberg and you got Jim Rose, Jim Rose and Joe Kaplan.
It's the personalities stupid.
And they still don't get it.
And you want to know why?
Because the general manager is a jock-licking, boom, a juling idiot.
That's why.
Three minutes till noon at 5.60 QA.
And by the way, clearance you are to.
Five and the local.
This is five-sixies.
Three is all yours.
Two and.
Okay, it's the 12 to one hour.
Yeah, at least we're today.
Well, we were out on our first date.
After eating at a Mexican cafe.
While we were driving is my car.
Let one go that almost blew us both away.
I asked her did you cut the cheese?
Then she turned around to look at these said girls don't part.
Girls don't part.
She kept telling me that girls don't part.
She kept telling me that girls don't part.
She kept telling me that girls don't part.
That's why.
I heard another deadly squirt, then I held my nose and covered it with my shirt.
I turned around to get her back, with just a matter of time before another attack.
So I asked if she was okay, that she looked at me, and also had the same one as her own phone part.
Girls don't fight, they need a girl don't fight, but I do.
Thank you.
Girls don't fight, girls don't fight, but I do.
But I do.
But I do.
Wow, they just showed a great clip of Al Sharpton.
I wish I would have seen that debate last night.
Not really, I was happy you're being at the track, had a good night.
They show Al Sharpton, I'm telling you, talk circles about all these guys.
Sure, never mind.
There was Dr. Dean talking about how he's not perfect and about his rant and yaddy-yaddy-yaddy,
and how, you know, he wouldn't do it if he had to do it over again, but he has to tell it the way he sees it.
So Al Sharpton said, Governor Dean, don't be so hard on yourself.
He said, as far as hooting and hollering, he said, if I would have spent the money, you didn't Iowa come in a distant third,
I would have been hooting and hollering too.
And Dean went, like that.
How would that go now?
You go, boy.
See, the price on the problem with Dean is no sense of humor at all.
Very uptight.
Ah, top 10 list last night was funny.
Eight.
Or concentrated, don't understand.
All right, or concentrated.
Well, that's fine.
But it came out of desperation, say.
But I'm talking about just off the cuff.
I'm gonna say he doesn't have a sense of humor up to that screaming thing.
He has no hysterical sense of humor.
He's uptight, overly medicated.
Okay, let's get this pole off here and get on the other one.
Okay, Eric, I don't want to get on you because you've been doing a great job, but this is done.
It's noon.
It's 12.05.
383 votes on the first one.
I know, I know, we already read the result.
Let's get on with it.
You know what I'm saying?
I think it's your fault.
What are you done to him?
Oh, Chris ordinarily.
He knows that the other pole goes up and he can go eat.
He can go eat a whole bunch of sandwiches and pasta, steaks, ribs, chitlins.
I know what they eat, norlando chitlins.
Or something rhymes with that.
Come on, Eric, let's go.
Let's get the other pole out there.
Let's get on with it, okay?
God damn it.
This is a slow move in place.
This is me off.
Who is your all-time favorite South Florida TV personality, newsroom entertainment?
Somebody you actually like.
Oh my god, what a concept.
Ralph Renek.
John Hammbrick.
Skippers Chuck Zink.
Rick Sanchez.
And Bishop Wayne Chandler.
Dave Dixon.
Charlie Baxter, we change that, right?
All right, I'm gonna have them all.
Glenn Raker.
Jilda Unruh.
Is it Gilda?
I don't know.
Oh.
Kelly Craig.
Don Cox, who would I leave out?
It'll be up there.
How about Bob Weaver?
How about him?
Get him on there.
Okay.
Don't say anything about Bob Weaver.
I haven't seen Bob in a long time.
Good guy.
I don't know, because you're gonna say he's old and all puffed up.
Don't we all get that way sooner or later?
Yeah.
Maybe not puffed up.
Here we do.
You'll see.
WQA Am Hello.
Yeah, hi.
How about our Rick Sanchez partner, Sally, the one with the Coke bottle upper body?
He gives me a fit.
Excellent choice, Pally.
Okay, all right.
Thank you.
Sally, he gives me a fit.
We might actually play that.
Do we still have that?
Oh yeah.
And we also have.
Get him on there.
Yeah.
Oh, she was the best Sally fits.
Remember the day I told you that I would do that she stopped me in a parking lot?
All right.
She didn't stop me, but I ran into her after the show.
Mm-hmm.
And I had never met her before.
And she knew who I was.
And she said, oh, you know that stuff you say about me on here?
And I said, she said, I don't like it.
Right.
She had a major.
I mean, she wasn't a hostile, at least not to my face.
But I don't like it.
I said, it's just a radio show.
She cried before one of our fellow producers over that issue.
Over what issue?
The issue with the Koch-Bad Leporant.
The things, the rumors that we didn't create and we didn't invent.
We just passed them along.
They just passed them along.
Those rumors, they weren't rumors.
I have people who made me, boys, man.
I said, you know, I said, you know, I never, I never, I never happened.
Yes, you did.
It's to find my existence down here and it's not true.
Excellent.
I think Eric is gone.
I think he just went back to sleep.
I don't think he's going to change the poll.
Is he relying on you to do that?
I don't have the ability to do that.
Maybe he was relying on me.
I'm telling him, but I thought he was here and that from you.
He probably can't hear us now.
Because I would do it if I could.
But I just don't have the ability to do it.
I take you out here right now and kick your goddamn teeth in.
I'm willing to do it.
Come on, Eric.
Let's go, baby.
Let's go.
Yes, then he sleeps in.
He sent me a message, though, to say that he was waiting for you to print it out.
But that was, I don't know how old that message was.
What do you mean by that?
Print it out.
The old one so that you could discuss it.
I just got through doing that.
We're done with that.
We're finished.
We're finished.
We're finished with the frickin' marlins, okay?
They're going to play in the peoria somewhere.
Nobody cares.
Such a whiner, Eric.
W.D.C.Y.M.
Hello.
What about Pam Giganti from Channel 6 in the morning?
That's the line choice, amigo.
I love her.
She used to be the weather girl on Channel 7.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I left out of the Jackie Johnson when I read the list.
And Pam Giganti.
She said it was a Salvador Giganti.
Who is the guy that was answered?
That's how the locals show them.
Is it where do they do that, Joe?
I don't know.
And that's Don Francisco, a Argentinian Jew.
They might do that, Joe, here you think.
Salvador Giganti.
I'm sorry, Chilean Jew.
They might.
I don't know.
Is he the one that like dances on the grapes?
That's the one when they make the wine.
He coaches the grapes.
No, I'm sorry.
It's Chilean fruit.
Is he one of those two?
He's a Chilean fruit.
That's what I heard.
Don Francisco.
Oh, no.
See, now you're going to pick on him.
We hope we got the senior cruise thing.
Oh, Jesus.
We're done.
Goodbye.
We're picking on Don Francisco.
He happens to be a very nice guy.
Well, there you go.
And a match.
Good job.
Well, he's good.
No, it's a good show.
When he has some good flesh on there.
I've seen some of the most of the stunts.
I know that I watch it very often.
Oh, here's a NEY-E.
Howdy pronounced that.
Ney-E.
Ney-E.
Ney-E says, first time factor.
Why is Dean speech in Iowa?
And he worse than Bush and Cheney.
Coloring reporter in a dress hole.
It's not the only difference being that the media let him off the hook on it.
Remember that?
Yes.
The New York Times reporter on the hook.
Which one?
And he didn't know that the camera was rolling and the audio was going to.
And he called him a major asshole.
There's that asshole or so and so from the time.
Yeah, guys, that's a major asshole.
Because the media, you know, that's the way they do it.
Because they bought the media first.
They own the media.
Don't you get it?
Five, six, seven.
Now here's a poll suggest about road rage.
Who should get ticketed on our highways?
Let's go and I'll save that.
Thank you, Brian.
Excellent choice.
Okay, I'm looking at what we got to do.
Pull up.
Nice going, Eric.
Oh, Eric was just a diverge of losing the love of his life.
It's a labor of love to George.
Oh.
Okay, who are we voting for?
You want Skipper Chuck?
I want Skipper Chuck.
Well, you can vote in their care.
No.
Not if you do.
Oh, so go ahead.
No, I'll vote for Skipper.
No, I don't want to vote for Skipper Chuck.
I'll vote for somebody.
Plenty of people vote for Good ol' Skipper.
Skipper the day that Rick, a Skipper Chuck.
What was that with Rick and Sons?
They were doing that remote?
No.
Yeah, you do.
I don't.
And I was in there.
I don't know.
I just make all kinds of fun of him.
And he just, I don't know.
He's okay.
They like him a lot.
I like him a lot.
Oh, I was making fun of his cemetery-village spots.
Oh, well, yeah.
And the fact that he got to be an old-futty duddy,
and as he gets older, he got to do something.
I mean, pretty soon I'm going to be doing nursing home spots here.
People like that 24-hour nursing care.
I got that 24-hour nursing care.
We're going to trade it out in Toronto.
I never told you that story about one of the tellers
at the track the other night, not last night,
but last night, whatever it's Saturday.
I'm leaving.
He says, he looks at me like he's astonished
that I'm walking around.
He says, oh, Genie, I'm glad to see your feeling better.
That was before I had my cold icy.
And I wonder, what is he talking about?
I was shaking my head as I walked out of there.
And I realized he must have been the one who had missed Fudge.
About my 24-hour nursing care in Toronto.
Yeah.
You know what Sally would say to my Fudge, OK?
And I think he beat her into the punch.
We're sports radio 516, QAM.
Stop it.
I'm a clock. It's time for the news now, Canada.
We're one and you wear the anchor sits.
Oh!
Sally gets his fence.
Very.
She bombs her head and not just her eyebrows,
gives us all the news, just to pieces and fence.
Sally is a fence.
Everyone knows Sally's running this ship.
Trying to compete with any bishops.
So comedic, so entertaining, relevant,
with part-taters, brings by wins.
Sally is a fence.
Everyone does everything that she says.
Cracks her with it up, jumps Ricky Sanchez.
Oh!
So in style, some mistakenly did everything she wants me.
Don't she guess?
Sally gets his fence.
Sally gets his fence.
Sally gets his fence.
How come we don't ever play that?
I love that.
Because she's out of sight out of mind.
No, she's still today.
People know Sally fits.
They know where Sally sits and where Sally...
Shman.
Facing it here at Wayne Ferris, somebody else said that.
He was here at a long time.
We put him on there.
We did.
Sure.
Come on.
Richard Whitcomb.
Who?
The last one to give editorials on Channel 7, I believe.
Richard Whitcomb.
Was he on 7?
I think so.
Who else would have put him on?
Richard Whitcomb.
Somebody liked him.
I can't believe it.
Who has been at the old singer, Richard...
That Irish singer?
Roger Whitaker?
Very good.
See?
Richard, Roger Whitaker.
You got a legal...
Right.
That's who Richard Whitcomb reminded me.
So Skipper Chuck isn't doing all that great.
I hate to break the news to George.
Wait till I get home.
And you want to know why?
Because he eats the tropical acres.
I mean, just because you get old doesn't mean you have to...
Doesn't mean you have to do Paladin spots.
I like Chuck's thing.
He's a good guy.
Who's putting on here?
Richard Whitcomb.
Richard Whitcomb, W-H-I-T-C-O-M-B, Whitcomb.
Jackie Johnson is winning.
Old Donkey Puss, he's got six.
It's because we got a lot of horny guys out there.
It's interesting.
If you saw her without makeup, up close, you'd puke your guts out.
I'm telling you right now.
Okay.
You wouldn't touch her with Miguel's hand.
Ralph, right neck, five.
You're right about that.
Touch her with mine.
How about your hand?
Jackie Johnson, six.
Ralph, right neck, five.
Kelly Craig, five.
Love you, Kelly.
Lucie Mway, please.
Please.
John Hamburg, three.
Skipper, Chuck's, ink, three.
Go out and meet him at the top.
You go, Chuck.
Actually, it was the corny spots he did for them.
Every other was a line in there.
Oh, it was unbelievable.
Where they showed all those acne.
We're warning his city.
That's not even when they were swimming.
And they were dying.
And they were punching each other in the face and falling down in the hidden her head.
That's got nothing to do with his greatness.
Five way or three.
Love you, Bob.
And Bishop, two Glenn Winkertoo.
Anybody tell us if he's a better liar?
I don't know.
Changing again now.
It's what we just built in this.
It would have been on a long time ago.
But Eric's busy eating lunches several of them.
You know, Eric is like, um, he's got peaks and valleys, you know.
Ups and downs.
He gets on your good.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, just picturing his peaks and valleys.
Oh, it's a horrible thought.
The ups and downs.
Let's see.
Here's the another fact.
It says I hope the second facts in one day isn't a chronic course not.
But I just saw this.
Everybody's favorite self-hating closet.
Uh, I can't say that fact.
Matt Raj is quoted as using a phrase that might sound familiar to long time lessons of your show.
Oh, yeah.
I love this.
I saw this already.
I'm glad that they reminded me about Moby.
This is from the New York Daily News.
Activist rocker Moby is leading a G-Hot against cyber-gossip Matt Drogh that self-hating
a faggot, blaming him for inciting far-right wingers who sent abusive and racist emails
to comedian Margaret Cho.
Was that before after the Cho?
On his website and in private messages to his friends, Moby has been claiming that Drogh
took out of context, Cho's stream of anti-bropublican invective intended his comedy stick during
last week's move on.orgs award at the Hammerstein Ballroom.
I was outraged, Moby told me.
Everyone knows that Margaret's comedy is very irreverent and Lenny Bruce style confrontational
and Matt Drogh took it out of context and exposed her to some really irresponsible and
vile reactions.
That subsurried Drogh responded.
He pointed out that post on Drogh report.com had clearly identified Cho as a comedian and
set the scene for a profanited Laster Marse which he published at length under the headline
Raw Rage at Bush during move on.org awards.
A couple of days after posting the excerpts, Drogh published Cho's complete routine from
the event.
There must be more of this I would hope.
It sure is taking a long time coming over here because where is the phrase?
You see it yet?
No.
Oh no, what is this that he just wrote out a thing to read?
Oh my god, what is your story, man?
He's a busy man.
Since Doreen left, you aren't worth a crap.
Oh here it is.
Among her saltier observations during the liberal group's celebs studied Gale under honor
political ads detecting President Bush, despite all of this stupid Bush myth that the
Republican National Committee or whatever the F they call him, that they were saying that
they're angry.
I don't want to read this whole thing.
It says they're like effing looking for Hitler in a haystack.
George Bush is not a Hitler.
He would be if he applied himself.
After Drogh's account was linked by the right-leaning free republic.com, oh what a surprise that is.
Cho received dozens of ugly emails, most of them unprintable in a family newspaper.
Moby told me the only good thing to come in this is that the extreme right has shown
their true colors.
Bush is masquerading as a compassionate conservative, but now they've exposed their extremely
right wing misogynistic racist agenda.
Drug shot back, these emails are mild compared to what I receive on a daily basis.
This is the nature of the internet, Moby and his friends just have to butcher up.
Oh you're about to talk about butch and up, that's what he was getting to.
Butch up, bitch.
Silly as bitch.
Self-hating, closet queen, asshole.
Anyway, join George tomorrow, loving to want to build side those boulevard to say this.
How much a guy I'm going to be there?
See.
That's how much a guy.
He'll be playing music from WCMQFAMA.
Right, scene accused music.
Scene accused.
Scene picked seed out of cruise.
She's dead.
Stick her ass in a back of the ship.
Hollass.
Get her out.
Take her out.
Turn her ass out.
See, she's set it right there.
She's a man.
Well, we know that.
She's got a big one, man.
Drag cany.
Join George tomorrow, guarantee you she didn't need to go see Alice.

What does that say?
I don't know.
See, I'm doing anything again, like those spots.
Stop by to win prizes and enjoy free food from Atlantic City subs where our good friend
Ira makes the difference and Scott's in the background now.
He's on deep background.
Stay there, Scott.
How come there are so many people named Scott who are like trouble?
One of those things.
Is it?
Look for the QM van tonight from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Dural ale house.
Stop by for President Abeira specials and win some free crap from a gal.
Well, I'm sure he's going to be there.

I said, free loader.
Free loading speak.

Jackie Johnson is pulling away.
Donkey Puss.
See, I'm not going to suck up and apologize for that comment.
And don't tell me I don't know a hot looking woman when I see one.
Okay.
So you know who's hot?
Who's that?
Sheridan.
Okay.
Oh, by the way, that next spot you have to read it.
That's where we don't have.
I know that.
I got the copy sitting right here.
Who's hot?
Oh, you just make a.
Yeah, I'm saying you know who's hot with your hot.
No, no, no, no.
You listen to this idea that fags don't know a beautiful woman when they see one kind of asshole that crap is that.
Just because fags at least have a little more objectivity, at least when women are concerned.
But they don't hit it.
And are oogling over everything with a screw down.
Mm-hmm.
Just like when mad dog was oogling over that bitch.
That's bad example.
What the hell?
I can't even think of her name anymore.
She manages bad eyesight, great of unsuspect.
Right, great of unsuspect.
Suspect, proof your credibility.
God.
Holy crap.
Just because he took too many hits to the head.
You wouldn't touch her with Michael.
What's his name's hand?
No.
The one that came off in a car.
You wouldn't take her with Steve Keynes hand.
No, I'm telling you right now.
You take one look at her and go.
No.
Yeah.
I'll join a monastery.
I would call her a doggy place, but you know how much I love dogs.
That'd be a bad insult.
Right.
Right, right, I'm on Sustorin.
Because I can never win a worst team was honor.
Air every morning, Channel 7.
Oh, Jackie Johnson.
It would be de-fo and Joe Littlebogg.
They're just oogling enough.
You know, you guys can do better than that.
Don't sell yourself short, even if you are.
Just because you're limping.
I think all the guys with limpingness there, there was a little Jackie Johnson.
Because they can't get...
You know what it reminds me of?
In Magnolia.
Yeah.
Philip, what's his name again?
The actor I love him.
See more Thomas.
Come on, see more Thomas.
Joe in the shorts.
And the character that he's playing.
And he's making all these have seen phone calls.
And he wants to do it, but he can't do it.
Right.
He can't get it up.
He's brave on the phone.
Right.
Like our callers.
Very brave on the phone.
No, tough on the phone.
Right.
Exactly.
But off the phone.
No.
This is a little bit pussy.
One of my favorite scenes is when it goes in to the Fat Brods apartment.
Jiquita Banana.
And they lie down in the bed and get under covers and face toward the wall.
Opposite.
Yeah.
That's what his character is all about.
Uh huh.
I can't imagine how you don't like that movie a lot more.
If they did end it.
No, I don't want to hear that.
That's Asuna.
Sorry.
It's Asuna.
If I don't recommend five movies right now, Magnolia would be at the top of the list.
It's great.
Okay.
The acting is fabulous.
Sure.
Nope.
No argument there.
And it's just and it's long.
But there are things.
There are things in there that you will just don't expect.
I mean, just off the wall.
Sure.
It's great.
Even if Tom Cruise is good in there.
That whole storyline with Tom and.
It's.
All of the storylines.
Right.
All of them.
They should have ended all of them.
Wait for the sequel.
All right.

have overcome the same problem. I'm buying the salary and I'm still interested in J-Lo and
that's why there's Benefer Anonymous, a support group for those tormented souls crippled by
their addiction to the celebrity couple through rest of the world has finally stopped caring about.

Does anyone know the answer to Sally's question?
Yeah, I do. It. Who gives a crap?
At Benefer Anonymous, we know you're bombarded with temptation from media outlets.

Who's your all-time favorite stop Florida TV personality? News, entertainment, whatever the hell

Well, because there's some people that are still desperately trying to hang on to the disco. I see. Sounds like a bunch of wired diaries to me.
Well, I would argue with that, but I looked on my radio and I've got one of those radios that has the the kind of programming that you can expect on a particular frequency.
Yes. All of them do it like 99 jam says 99 jam. Y 100 says Y 100 dash seven. This one says classic.

Good.
Jackie Johnson's in first place.
A lot of desperate guys out there who can't get it up.
In fact, the guys who voted for probably if she showed up at house
would be like Philip Seymour Thomas.
They'd probably sit down on the couch on the opposite end and say,
I can't do this.
You know what I mean?
I can't do this.
Who is your all-time favorite South Florida-
TV personality?
News or entertainment?
Whatever.

All of the people really enjoyed
Dave Dixon's corny late night.
Those awful late night movies that used to rip an ass.
Mm-hmm.
Talk about how corny and awful and bad they were.
As opposed to the bubbly big Wilson.
It was a good guy.
But he used to shield for his flex.
You know.
Now if you've got a big Wilson thing in there.
Sure. Big radio.
I love it.
We do.
I haven't played that in a cool.
You know, like I haven't played that since the last.
Oh no.
What is that?
That was bad.
We just tap it on there.
Suck my dick.
I haven't played that either.
How's old Brian Cox doing huh?
Hey Brian.
Are you happy?
I hate WLV again.
Suck my dick.
I'll be them happy.
Asshole.
What am I looking for?
Big radio.
Oh big radio.
Well that's not us anymore.
We used to be big.
Now we're teeny tiny.
Sports.
Now we need to go see Alice to try to
as a ratings extender.
Make them bigger.
I don't I don't find that thing.
How could you not?
Big.
What is it called?
Big, big radio.
Radio.
Hello.
Welcome to Big Radio.
This is big.
Big Wilson.
And that's right.
I'm no longer dead.
You see this used to be wacky.
And that was big.
So they dug me up to do big radio.
Well anyway.
Welcome to Big Radio.
And we're going to have some
lovely lovely tunes to play for you.
Such as this one.
And maybe a few records.
Some light entertainment here and there.
Coming up we have the
very very talented, the very very famous
Starland vocal band.
I believe it's afternoon.
The light.
One of my all time favorites.
I used to play it all the time on the
by the great entertainer.
The big Wilson show followed by Bill
Calder.
And any rate here we are on
big radio.
Finally, I've made it to FM.
And we're going to hear the
Starland vocal band with their
very lovely tune.
Afternoondy light.
But first let's let me tell you about a
place called Pammie's
Sexy Pretty Things.
Oh yes, they're very very pretty.
Very very sexy things.
Very very lovely.
Which reminds me of this little tune.
And it also comes to mind.
You know there there's a wonderful
restaurant called Stakes and Food.
I love this place.
I always love to go to
Stakes and Food.
All my friends were there.
Chuck's Inc and Joey Carr.
And they have a very lovely menu there.
And I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
By the way, this is big radio.
This is big and welcome to big.
Coming up we have once again.
Let me remind you we have the very very
lovely Starland vocal band coming up.
Any minute.
Hello, big.

Fat.
And always dead.
Here's one that says I was recently
pulled by a government poll on the
full and the poll questions were such
BS questions are decided to get the
answer to be looking for.
One question was Iraq on weapons of
mass destruction answer one.
I believe President Bush Iraq has
weapons inside of his line answered to.
I believe Saddam Hussein Iraq has
new weapons and President Bush's line.
There you go.
Not that that was fixed or anything like that.
No, no.
It wasn't a regular.
I don't believe any of these polls.
Chris says especially ours.
Could you please play phone lines
and feel better?
I don't know what that means.
Phone lines.
What is that?
What does that mean?
I don't know.
Phone lines.
Yeah, like by ELO.
Telephone line.
All right.
What is there is no such big called
phone line?
So Christopher could be a little more
Pacific.
Okay.
Because we have no idea what that is.
Because I'd love to play anything
and I feel some good time.
I'm not going to lie.
Because I can barely speak.
I feel fine.
Almost look fine.
Yeah, I look like me.
But I just have no voice.
But you know what I'm not mumbling.
I'm not quite as incoherent as those spots.
I was just mumbling fast.
Hmm.
I don't know what you were doing like that.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
I can just see Sandy Peyton now.
Driving that pickup truck out of town with Anne's body back in the
back seat.

Lovely lady.
Real bitch.

This is the only guy that ever did a TV show
with no teeth in his mouth.
You know, it's serious.
It's the truth.
That's what you know.
Somebody will know who that is.
I know.
You know what I was glad to hear you

Right.
Just, yeah, it's been that way for months.

So it's not Channel 7.
It's the cable.
It's that crap cable we got.

Oh, they're out there.
They're just not down there.
And where does everybody go on Friday?

No, seriously.
And of course, now that the kids are out of school,
I bet we're in another a lot more three day people.
Maybe the ones at the beach.

No, she's got two fake boobs
and they're not even the same size.
No, they're not.
I mean, one is a Mariah Carey model

It's a white one and the other one's kind of like more
pussed.
Jackie Johnson 38 with a skinny ass.
You know what reminds me of it's like when the Paris Hilton video.

Paris Hilton video.
He's seen it.
George, remember that day?
Yeah.
Now, why would it?
It reminds me of Ron Jeremy.
Why would I want to see him without clothes on?
I don't want to see him with this clothes on.
And the same with her.
I'd rather see Paris but she's all
than Ron Jeremy than anybody would have been
Ron Jeremy but I'm just saying she's a skanky bitch.
She's a skanky skinny.
And the only reason they get excited about seeing that is because
they can.

And it's Paris.
Right.
She's a billionaire who gives a crap.
She is.
She is a runway.
Ganky.

It is nice.
In fact, I hate regular coke.
I like Pepsi and other time.
What?
Yeah, it's a stock coke.
But these new flavors, right?
The vanilla one though.
Vanilla one blows.
Too sweet.
And that's just too sweet, but it's kind of like a funky taste.
Right.
Like a rat dyed in it.
I mean, I had the lime yet.
Oh, well, I'll leave you the rest of this bottle.
I hate you.
I'm going to take it with you on the line.
No, I didn't think I'd be a nipple yet.
Although I'm thinking how I started doing it.
Looks like a lot of people in this audience would like
to start the suck it on nipple.

She's got 45 votes.
Schivertuck 33.

We don't have to put no radio people out here doing TV.
Mad Dog.
No, no, I was saying all those other ones that I was mentioned.
All those.
Don't start looking for an Amera Bell thing.
OK, I know where the hell it is.
I have you guys, my guys.
Yeah, whatever you say.
Some of the English is much better now.
Thank God.
Some of the spots we're playing.
I don't want to, you know, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, what?
What a heavy, we got all kinds of problems.
Ha, ha, ha.
If anyone thinks it's another.
Well, at least my being here, we got rid of those awful
promos before they were able to create a lot of disturbance.
And again, it's because clearance, he means well.
It's just that he's an idiot.
That's a problem.
No, no, but I'd rather have somebody who's an idiot,
but means well as opposed to somebody who's mean spirited.
Absolutely.
And doesn't mean well.
See what I'm saying?
Who thinks that they're very smart, but are vicious,
absolutely.
Absolutely.
And so that's a lot.
Absolutely.
Disgusting.
You know who we need to do is a, I'm sure I'll never see
her or meet her.
His wife.
Can you imagine?
You know how many years they've been married?
How many years have they been married?
About 30, man.
He told me that the other day when we hit our very brief
truce, he said the only thing he cares about is that
lovely lady he goes home to wherever he did.
I said, well, what about your wife?
No, no, no, no, he was talking about his wife.
For 30 years now, she, and then can you imagine?
It's just like my mother.
How could anybody put up with her for 40 years?
How could anybody tolerate it?
And she just, if she can't get to you the first time,
you'll repeat it.
She'll keep zetting and zetting and zetting until you finally,
ah, is, you know, until you just can't handle it or do you
want to scream?
You know how it worked with my mother?
Yeah.
The bastards had to come and both of them.
What is that?
Both her husbands were pregnant.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, they had to come and they must have been
faster than the previous one.
I mean, 40 minutes with my mother is fine.
Your dad didn't have it coming.
I think it was a good match.
Right.
WDQM line nine.
Neil, you forgot Mr. Alsham shying with his ham-hawks.
Alsham shying with you.
OK, thank you so much.
Shame on me.
You're right.
Alsham shying.
Tell me piece of crap.
I can't stand him.
I mean, the ham-hawks is bad enough, but just he's so full of crap.
And I'll never forgive him for that day.
You remember the day I saw right here that we had the
full, the eight minutes fully hurricane threat, right?
And Mayor Ping up a cane.
He was going, oh, everybody's got a shut down.
And of course, the thing was already gone by here.
And so he takes his cameras up there in Fort Lauderdale.
And they had some, what restaurant was it?
It was something that I don't know.
Unless Olis.
Right.
They opened up because then goes I think.
The thing was already gone.
Right.
It was already gone by.
There was no threat to date or broward anymore.
And she bought you and the mayor said this and you opened up.
And they, you know, screw you, Alsham shying.
You're an asshole, man.
Can't stand you.
He's one more reason not to watch Channel 4.
Although he is the only one there whose last name is not Rodriguez.
W.D.C.Y.M.
C.Y.M.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Neil Rogers knows all this about music.
Who made who sang the song Red Wine?

He didn't do it and his mind cannot enjoy without the feeling of losing it.
I mean, he's not that well.
And you've felt移 and love into your mind about your Europaicosre maybe.
What an evil need!
He knows your voice.
There were things I could not tell you.
Backwards mall about that?
You know?
I believe it's C-A-F-F-E-I-R-O. I believe. I don't know.
There have been so many. I'm spelling all these faux-neticos.
Yeah, we don't care about this phone. We know that can do a spell check.
I spell it like Chattaro.
Caffado.
Red red wine.
You be 40. That guy.
You be. That guy, you know what he's got? He's got W-D-40 in his name.
Correct him! Yeah.
The guy I called before. The old cocker.
What are you playing now?
Red red wine?
No, it's just some music.
Doesn't sound like it.
Music from the original motion picture soundtrack.
Oh.
You be 40. That can't be.
It couldn't have been the original recording of Red Red wine.
Maybe it's Red wine is what he was talking about. Is there just a Red wine?
No.
But there is.
There's that one, though. Just in case.
And don't forget, there was also a U.B. Illin.
Don't forget about them.
567-0560.
I'm not going to be glad when it gets to be 2 o'clock.
Not that I'm really delighted to be here.
But there's nothing worse than trying to do a talk show with a horse voice.
46 votes for a horse face.
Jackie Johnson is in first place.
Old Donkey Puss.
46.
Just a Donkey Puss?
Yes. Ever see it?
Trying to.
Some people get confused with an ass.

Even more than that.
He what's his name?
What's his name?
Greg Vudell.
Oh.
And David Bloom and Bishop Tenepey.
It's both worse than peace.
I think Andy deserves to have her ass left alone now.
Dwight.
She's been dead for many years.
She's not even.
Not even Luke Warme anymore.
You know?
If you stuck one of those turkey thermometers in her ass.
It wouldn't even register.
It would be very her face down.
She's been dead that long.
Well, they buried her face down for Dwight.
And for the rest of us too, because we don't want to see that push no more.
Old butch and.
Please, we can park our bike there.
There's another one I had no sense of here.
We're boy.
The things I used to say about her on here.
And I, and don't forget to use to have the signs up on the Bulletin Board there at Channel 10.
Anyone who watches the near Roger, or listen to any of Rogers will be fired.
Right.
She hated you.
That is a true story that militant bitchie dyke and now she's dead.
God.
26 past one at five.
At five six.

How the heck I supposed to eat the one, tan soop.

No surprise package to put on.
That's what I mean today.
More points, this is gonna be real math, right?
You left out my pork fry, right?
What are your geekies?
Exactly, it's 134.
I think I'm getting a little bit of voice just enough for 25 more minutes.
Oh, I was wrong.
Now, guess who's on right now doing a report on Rush Limbaugh?
Rush drug Limbaugh?
Link effect.
Oh, damn it.
And effect someone is gonna be left doing it all verbally.
Susan Candy-Adi.
Why isn't she on our list?
I love Susan.
She's great, she's been on CNN a long time.
We love Susan Candy-Adi.
She's a sweetheart.
Yes.
I'm at the time that Steve Nicol-Brotter and Yash,
that stupid fairy report, that was embarrassing.
I'm sorry, Susan.
He's an idiot, Steve Nicol.
I hope you're listening on the internet, Steve.
In the bar.
Over to hell, you're hanging out.
Jim Brosmer.
On WTVJ, you know, remember Jim Brosmer?
Yes.
The little child.
The deaf didn't remember Jim Brosmer.
He was on a long time, he was very good.
And he's a candy-Adi with a T or a D on the end.
TTI.
TTI.
She's got TTIs.
Uh, Jim Brosmer, he left town, I don't remember what happened to him.
And they came back on Channel 10 and just bombed.
They didn't make no impact.
See, there's a difference between people, you know, we liked it.
I thought he was a good anchor, Jim.
But he just wasn't a big factor in the market.
I don't know why.
Because it's a tough town.
Not too many people really make like a big impact here.
Unless they got big teeth, right?
Big nipples.
Big nips.
Or big ass.
Like Maris Grisias.
49 for Jackie Johnson.
Wow.
That is.
Don't blame me.
I'm not blaming anybody.
If they like Jackie, they can have her Johnson.
She's got one.
Skipper Chuck Zanky, you stab one.
He's got 36.
Kelly Craig 22.
God don't even know what Kelly's got.
Bob Lee.
I love Bob Weaver.
One of my favorite people.
Love your Bob.
I keep saying that.
Not too much though.
Just out for a name is 18.
Do I love it?
Oh, do you see this?
What?
That's a family friend I called in to see.
Let us know about this.
You'll remember his kid TV show that talked a lot about literature and science and music.
Oh, just not going to make sure.
All right.
We're going to take that.
You put an evil hacks on Captain Kangaroo boy.
You guys do that.
Bob Keeshin just died.
Captain Kangaroo.
To sad day.
Oh, well, call up Mr. Green jeans.
We had suds on before.
He said, well, call him up anyway.
Tell me get ready.
Mr. Moose.
Dead.
Yeah.
Funny rabbit.
Dead.
Long time.
He died.
Yeah.
Magic drawing board.
He died.
Right after the show.
Yeah.
Pinkie Lee.
He died.
Francis Horowitz.
He died.
Thing down the school.
He died.
Oh, she died.
I don't want to play that one.
Captain Kangaroo was dead.
George put an evil hacks on him.
I bet you he died.
Oh, it after you said that.
Right after I said it.
Right after you mentioned his name.
Go right over.
I'll don't ever mention my name again, please.
Oops.
What was that?
The one thing.
Oh, it sounded pretty good there.
Sound like something.
It's what I meant to play.
Like telephone lines.
Your riders.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18T.
And Verizon Wireless Line.
What else did I stand?
Look at this.
By the 10th.
So the defense had those medical records and was referring to them.
So today, an attorney for the hospital went before the judge and said,
Judge, we want those records.
What is that story about?
I don't know.
If you want to read the whole Russian ambassador, if you didn't see the end of those papers this morning, it's on our website.
Russian is.
Russian this and the red blacks of that.
Prosecutors said this.
Ten felony counts.
Pee bargain, etc., etc.
I'd read a lot more of it, but I can't speak.
W-D-Q-A-M.
Q-A-M?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, it is.
Neil, you are the overlord.
I am. I'm loading it.
Hey, listen.
How about a big lotion?
Did we put him on there?
He's on there, man.
Oh, no way, dude.
Yeah, he's on there.
Hey, I-
He's- he's- he's tinkling on it right now.
He's tinkling on the big eye of reason the sky.
Hey, there ice cubes right now.
Hello, Pete.
Hello, Pete.
Have a great day, Brad.
Get out of here.
Hello, Pete.
Great guy.
Well, I didn't know it.
I did.
I had dinner with him one time.
He kept pulling-
He looked great.
He kept reaching across the table on the anke my food away.
Now, he didn't do that.
I'm trying to think of who did do that.
Remember?
No.
No, he- not even-
No, there was somebody I can't remember who it was.
Uh, long ago.
Your mom.
No, somebody, uh, personality type.
And he would like-
Oh, can I try some of that?
And he would like reach across.
And take a little bit of something off everybody's plate.
I hate that.
Oh, my God.
I thought that-
Even I wouldn't do that.
I'm about as tacky as it gets, but that is-
So frickin' grotesque.
Oh, can I have a little of that?
Let me see how that is.
And I-
What I should have it was got up and like bent over once.
I had it like that.
You can have some more of that.
Which he really, I had a punch to right in order.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
It had a punch to right in the head.
Real hard.
In fact, get a hold of that guy from the movies up there in Broward.
Hey, there you go.
You can barely see.
I still keep my mom in the movie.
I still can't get over that.
The fact that the daughter is rationalizing.
And they turn down the, uh, the play agreement.
I just can't believe it.
It was murder.
Is what it was.
It was the theater's fault for not having adequate old people security.
I see.
That's what they're saying.
A punch this guy in the head, right?
He fell down, went into a coma, and he died.
Kind of like that ricksoncious thing.
W-Q-A-M.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
We are now.
It sounds just like you.
Sounds just like you, too.
Okay.
I hope not.
I've got two of them.
One's pretty obscure, but one is, uh, I can't believe she's not even on there.
Connie, Connie Chung.
Connie Chung was here.
Of course.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
What was that?
And the long time.
How many years ago was that?
About 30, man.
Okay.
30, man.
Uh, and there was another guy that did.
He's brought in to go against the gift for Chuck Show back in the early 60s.
It was called Banjo Billy's Fun Boat.
I don't know if you remember that or not.
No.
But Banjo Billy.
Okay.
Don't even know.
That's Ben Zell.
We got it.
Thanks, Pally.
Got anybody think of it?
Which of those are we putting on there?
Banjo Billy and Connie Chung.
Chung.
Chung.
I don't know if she was here.
And listen, if he says she was here, she must have been here.
Maybe for...
Why would he lie?
Couple coffee.
No, he was, uh, he knew his crap.
You could tell.
Jackie Johnson, nobody's gonna touch her.
Oh, oh.
51 for Jackie.
Skipper Chuck 37.
I don't know why you're so...
I mean, he's gotta have a sense of humor.
Of course he does.
What's wrong with being old and decrepit?
Uh, everything?
And putting your teeth in the glass of tropical acres.
Everything?
Yeah, but when you're 35...
We're supporting you, 560.
You A.A.A.
I was around, it's hard to sleep.
I know it's for show, but in a cop's after me.
But, who'd they want from this old yearning?
I'm just sitting here, hoping that you'll be...
Oh, you know it from the vehicle.
I know who I am.
I'm a God for you.
I'm aware of everything.
Take me to the shop.
And take off the head gear in the atsitzers, too, please.
While you're writing these down, while you're typing these out.
Captain Kangaroo did it 86.
Oh, boy.
So, it's 86.
It's enough to make you scream.
Hey, show you how many years this show ran.
About 30, man.
Right, right on the number.
Bob Keeshin noted generations of children as TV personality.
Captain Kangaroo has died at 76, only moments before his name was mentioned in vain.
By talk show producer George Rodriguez at WQM in Miami.
I'm reading it right off MSNC.
He's sitting.
The Captain Kangaroo show began its 30-year run.
About 30, man.
In 1955.
You put the hacks on him.
You're killer.
I do it all the time.
Elante Kleesto.
Characters included the Captain himself and pals Mr. Green Jeans, Mr. Moose, and Bunny Rabbit.
A favorite sketch involved Mr....
Mr....
What, there's a board, Mr. Mayor.
Dropping ping pong ball in the captain's head.
No, Captain said.
They left out the moves.
Moose would drop balls on the captain's head.
According to the Internet movie database, Captain Kangaroo won six Emmys and three Peabody awards.
Remember Mr. Peabody?
That's right.
I like that show better.
I know.
But before portraying...
I didn't know that.
Hmm?
Before portraying the captain, Keeshin was the first actor to play sidekick Clarebel the clown on the Howdy Doody show.
I guess I didn't know that, but I forgot.
That's important stuff.
He was a...
Clarebel.
See?
Here's the staff.
He used to squeeze it.
Keeshin was author of numerous books including Growing Up Happy.
Captain Kangaroo tells yesterday's children how to nurture their own.
And Good Morning Captain.
50 Wonderful Years When Bob Keeshin...
Something.
TV's Captain Kangaroo.
He also wrote a series of books about a character called...
Itty Bitty Titty.
A Kitty.
What?
Cat.
Itty Bitty Titty.
That's what he wrote.
That was about Jackie Johnson.
You oughta see her real ones.
Oh, I'm sorry.
She keeps them in a jar.
Well, send them all to your desperate guys out there.
Okay?
All you limp guys.
Now, here's one from Mark.
Oh, this is just amazing.
You're going to cramp.
He's got some old names at Walt Kronyce.
Oh, yeah.
The Boy Channel Turned By The Man.
Right?
You better get your typing fingers, right?
He's got 100 names.
Lori, the Buzz, Hibberd.
Remember that?
We got drops.
She was our neighbor.
What are they?
What are they under?
Uh...
Remember, it is all for a very good class.
So even if you absolutely take no Rogers,
pause, pick up the CD anyway,
what's the worst that can happen?
And that is the Buzz.
What's the name?
Yeah, what a big endorsement.
Like grandma, I'm so sure.
And then of course there was always...
Swallow?
Yeah, she did.
Let's see who else.
Peter Ford.
Bob Mayor.
How can we leave my good buddy Bob Mayor off of there?
Hey, get off the phone, book's Bob.
People are starting to talk.
Michael, pardon me.
Well, I don't know.
Put him on there if you want.
He just pissed me off of it.
I think about um...
Catherine Harris.
We hate you now, Mike.
We used to like you a lot.
And I would despise you.
You're an idiot.
Sucking Catherine Harris's smelly old toes.
Nasty.
Camberl Marshall.
Ha ha.
Are you getting these?
Let me give you a clue on the next one.
I'm spelling them all wrong.
Let me give you a clue.
Forget about spelling.
Dave Gain.
I was gonna say it.
Bigger than like that cell.
Terry Merriman.
I wonder if she's kind of Jim Merriman Jr.
Or Tom Merriman.
Uh...
Oh.
Somebody says Tony Segredo.
Now smell his name right.
S-E-G-R-E-T-O.
Okay.
You got it?
S-E-G-R-E-T-O.
You got that?
And you might want to put on there.
He's an asshole.
Yeah.
Well, I'm sorry he's one of Hank's friends.
I forgot.
He's still an asshole.
Uh...
Speaking of that, Sloppy Jennifer Villapi.
I don't forget that note.
The real Kurt Nochi wrote, thank him for the things I said about her.
What she used to do with that show from Italy on the travel channel?
He's, uh...
Oh.
Massive.
Run away, ego.
I'm totally spelling all these wrong.
I don't care.
Nobody cares.
Uh, what else?
Gail Bright.
Okay, Gail.
How can we leave off our close friend, Ray?
Sorry, Gail.
They're talking about eating, yes!
Eating, yes!
That was Gail Bright's friend.
Right, right, right.
Right.
Rad Burky, I don't know who that is.
Rad.
Who is that?
You don't remember Rad?
No.
Might be still on somewhere.
Who was it?
What was it?
He was...
I don't know who that is.
Rad Burky.
Todd Tungan.
That's the big question to channel 10.
Is who is Todd Tungan and does Don?
No.
Todd Tungan.
Willard Shepard.
Now I get confused between Slop Smith that's on Fox's New's now.
He's an idiot.
Or talk about a lightweight.
He used to have the ballet Slip resigning to parking on.
In fact, there are Channel 7 and IOD.
Willard, uh, huh?
You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
Shepard Smith.
Oh, Shep.
Shepard is out.
Willard Shepard.
He's on Channel 6, Annie.
Dark and Plagot.
No.
There he is.
Or the late Mark Lovener on Channel 7.
LUDNER.
Mark Lovener.
I don't think there's any.
Oh!
In it.
Let's see.
Oh, here's Annett's talking about Lee's favorite.
Tony St. Redo's one of them, as well as Dan Cofflin.
The asshole did sports for Channel 6 and late 80s who kept accentuating reports by ringing
a bell like he was an 18th century town cryer.
I remember he once called Michael Jordan an idiot for missing a slam dunk.
He was gone soon after that.
In conclusion says Mark Boy is a lengthy facts.
God.
Thank you, Mark.
John Hamburg should be doing much better.
That's right.
John was great.
And then he went back to Texas to Houston, I think.
How big were his boobs?
42.
No, he was excellent.
You didn't like John Hamburg?
I liked him great.
What do you talk about?
He was, I would say he's the best news anchor.
Oh, Del Frank.
That guy would get upset with me.
We don't put Del Frank.
Del Frank.
Del Frank.
Del Shannon Frank.
Rest in peace.
He also did.
How come all the good people are the dead people?
And the rest of us are still alive.
God.
Say.
Well do something about it, George.
Start with your mama.
Oh, I hex Captain Kangaroo.
Yeah.
Say your mama.
Me mama.
Oh.
Two mama.
No, she's more powerful than all of us.
I see.
Okay.
Thank you, Mark.
Just a fantastic.
Oh, and he also done Francisco.
Did we put him on there?
No.
But we will.
Because somebody says the one person you forgot we talked about.
It says the old proverb will zoom to the top of your poll.
Those old Hispanics love him.
Says Thai.
One of yours.
What do you mean by that?
Is it you?
Yes.
Don Francisco.
He was Jewish.
He's a Jewish.
He's a Jew.
He's a Chilean.
Now what is this?
Who is this?
Who is this?
Oh, this must be.
Is this a picture of was that?
Is that Skipper Chuck?
I can't even tell who that is.
Somebody who can't even pick up.
Hey, Skipper Chuck.
Who is that?
Captain Kangaroo?
No.
I don't know.
I can't even tell who that is.
It's definitely that talks about Dave Gaming the same but that's not Dave Game.
That must be Skipper Chuck.
He's 90.
Look at that.
He's rinsing out his teeth.
That's a beautiful shot.
He looks a little like Dave Duval, the one a man on CFTO in Toronto but he's not.
He's great.
I love Dave Duval.
You see him?
No.
No.
Of course not.
K.S. says, and Anbyship is the only news acre that ever did every news cast with the giant
water of gum in her mouth.
She had a giant water in her mouth.
What's she to the news?
You know where she's got it now?
Back them.
That's what Dwight told me.
One night they cut back to Anne too quickly after a commercial.
She was looking down at her copy and furiously chewing a huge lot of gum.
Suddenly she looks up completely startled by the fact that she's on the air.
Pushes the water gum into her right cheek and starts her story.
Ever after that I could always tell there was a lot of gum in her cheek.
It really gave her voice that bull'd like he saw.
Maybe it was a chase back or maybe it was a chaw.
Like she needed a lot of help.
I'm on my head long.
This is 420 of ice.
You way out.
You get now that I'm only one big big Taylor Bell.
Don't worry about it.
We got it.
Now we're all pumping and saying we got it.
We're going to take this the more we got it.
Where is my Jesus?
You say 9 or 11 is what they got you to believe.
Can't get any gum or but a own party card to believe.
You believe what they say like a frog.
I'm a fellow fool.
I say you have patience.
The state of the fool is true.
For the election of all we got it.
Push it's got it came.
We got it.
Get them on your knees.
We got it.
We got it.
We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.
We're going to California and Texas and New York.
We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.
And then we're going to Washington DC to take back the White House.
Bye bye bye.
I'm 566 on MQAM.
Miami for learning.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Absolutely.
