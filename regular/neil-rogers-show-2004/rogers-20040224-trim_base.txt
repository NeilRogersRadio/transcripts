No, yeah, that's right.
See, Eric, George is sticking it to you again,
He did that intentionally,

So we don't have to tie him up for hours and hours,
They go about his eating, I mean, I'm moving.
Popular radio host Todd Klam, better known as,
Bubba Love Sponge, no Hindu square bob,
Spongepants, is apparently getting the X.
WFLA radio is reporting that 98 rock
and clear channel communications have severed ties with Bubba,
That means he's fired.
He's out.
He is, finito, how do you like that?
I'm gonna kick his ass and then I'll steal his two pay.
The station set of press release from clear channel communications,
Headquarters and San Antonio will be issued today
with all the gory details.
Clear channel was fined nearly a million dollars by the FCC
because remarks and actions on Bubba's show,
Commission said the show, Commissioner said the show was in decent.
After that incident, the FCC warned Clear channel
will consider taking away 98 rocks radio license
if there were any further instances of indecency.
Bubba was also taken to court by our good friends at,
Peta, people for the ethical treatment of animals
for the on air butchering of a pig,
which we remember that very well.
The Peta didn't like it.
They didn't find it amusing.
Bay nine news, Bay news night channel line in the Tampa,
Hasn't been able to reach Bubba for any comments yet
is what the latest thing was on the way.
But we'll keep our eye on it.
We're waiting breathlessly for the announcement from cheap channel.
What kind of story they make up covering the rats.
Now, also very interesting.
Can I just pass this along?
Okay.
Interesting and disturbing before we get to the other stuff.
American investigators were given the first name and telephone number
of one of the 9-11 hijackers two and a half years
before the attacks on New York and Washington.
But the US appears to have failed to pursue the lead aggressively.
American and German officials say the information,
the earliest known signal that the US received about any of the hijackers
has now become an important element of independent commission investigation
in the events of 9-11 officials say yesterday.
It's considered especially significant because it may have represented a missed opportunity
for American officials to penetrate the Al-Qaeda,
Tera-Sell in Germany that was at the heart of the plot.
And it came roughly 16 months before the hijackers showed up at
the plate schools in the US 16 months before.
When you have thought that they might have labeled this guy a person of interest,
so to speak.
In March 99, German intelligence officials gave the CIA the first name and telephone number
of Mar-1 Al-Shi-hi and asked the Americans to track him.
The name and phone number in the UAR,
then the United Arab Emirates rather,
has been obtained by the Germans by monitoring the telephone of Muhammad Haidar Zamar
and Islamic militant in Hamburg,
who was closely linked to the important Qaeda plotters,
who ultimately masturbated 9-11.
After the Germans passed the information onto the CIA,
they didn't hear from the Americans about the matter until after 9-11
the senior German official said.
There was no response at the time the official said after receiving the tip,
the CIA decided that Mar-1 was probably an associative Osama Yamama,
but never tracked and down American official said.
The Germans considered the information on Mr. Shii, especially valuable,
and the commission is keenly interested in why it apparently didn't lead the greater scrutiny of him.
In other words, they f'd up.
If I can say that, can I say it?
No, no. They screwed up.
They screwed up.
They erred it.
Yeah.
Anyway.
Oh, there's the poll.
Let's see.
I don't know what to vote for on here.
I don't know.
Somebody good choice is usual.
Are there choices all on here?
Like I said, when Eric gets the last choice on there.
Now, here's the daily news from New York today.
Jamie Bernard in award-winning film critic and comments for the daily news,
who says she gives this one star.
I don't know what the scale is, whether they do four or five stars.
But anyway, one which you can't get.
I guess you could do none.
Right?
I do 50 stars.
It's mighty low.
Okay, Eric, you got this thing up here so I can get this out of there.
I think I'm going to vote for even the Pope would be proud of this marketing.
So here's what Jamie has to say.
Gore is the crime of passion, and she's not talking about Al Gore or Gorfidal.
She says no child should see this movie, even adulter at risk.
Mel Gibson's the passion of the Christ is the most virulently anti-Semitic movie
made since the German propaganda films of World War II.
It is sickening much more brutal than any lethal weapon movie.
The violence has grotesque savage and often fetishized in slow mo.
At least in Hollywood Spectral, that kind of violence is tempered with cartonish distancing effects,
not so here, and yet the passion is also undeniably powerful.
Because of all the media coverage of this movie and the way it was shown only
to handpicked sympathizers until yesterday screening for movie critics,
many questions hang in the air as it historically accurate.
Of course not, as with any movie, even a documentary,
this one reflects the views of its filmmakers who are entitled and expected to use
their art persuasively, Gibson has been upfront about his own religious agenda.
But is it any good?
The passion, once you strip away all the controversy and religious fervor,
is a technically proficient account of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth.
The movie is sanctimonious in a way that impedes dramatic flow and limits
characterizations to the saintly and the droolingly vulgar.
That said, there are many things in its favor, a heroic physical effort by Starr Jim Cavazell,
stunning cinematography by Caleb Deschanel, and the footballer had the actor speak
the dead language of a ramex with some subtitles.
Is Gibson devout or is he mad?
Have Gibson claimed Napoleon helped him direct instead of divine spirits,
the answer would be clear.
Even so, a touch of madness is often a good thing in the director,
but the passion feels like a propaganda tool rather than entertained for a general audience.
Is it anti-Semitic?
Yes.
Jews are vilified in ways both little and big, pretty much nonstop for two hours and seven minutes.
Gibson cuts from the hook-nose of one bad Jewish character to the hook-nose of another in the ensuing scene.
He misappropriates an important line from the Jewish celebration of Pesach,
why is this night different from all other nights,
Manichdana Halalahaze, and slaps it into a Christian context.
Most unforgivable is that Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Palestine,
who decreed that Jesus decusified,
is portrayed as a sensitive, kindhearted soul who's sickened by the Churches,
the Jewish mob heaps upon his prisoner.
Pilate agrees to the crucifixion only against his better judgment.
The most offensive line of the script was as co-written by Gibson with Benedict Fitzgerald,
about Jews accepting blame was not cut from the movie,
as initially reported, only its subtitle was removed.
Passion assumes the audience already knows Christianity 101
and plunges right into the aftermath of the last supper,
taught by an effeminate seductive Satan in anticipating betrayal Christ suffers.
Old as he suffered.
Had it sound like South Park the movie, though, you're feminine Satan, doesn't it?
It says, old as he suffered, the movies they accompany him of tortures
that would horrify the regulars at an SNM club.
Gibson spears not one cringing close up to showcase what he imagines,
Jesus must have endured.
The lashings are so brutal that chunks of flesh go flying
and blood rains like outtakes of killbill.
The Romans captured their prey with the help of a termally regretful Judas,
then haul them around to be whipped, beaten, spat upon, mutilated,
and finally crucified, all with the cheering encouragement of a ghoulish mob of Jews.
No one in the crowd speaks up for Jesus, not even strangely, his mother.
Religious intolerance has been used as an excuse for some of the history's worst atrocities.
The Passion of the Christ is a brutal nasty film that demonizes Jews
at an unfortunate time in history.
Whatever happened to the idea that the centerpiece of every major religion is love.
Oh, how old fashioned, right?
Come on, Jamie. Who's kiddin' who?
What a great-to-review, huh?
A scathing review as she is devolves the rippedest piece of Drek just exactly the way it deserves.
Have I seen it? No.
Will I see it? No.
Will I see any male Gibson movie? No.
Will I see any movie about Farbiss and a Graham? No.
Other than that, happy Easter.
So we see it?
No.
Maybe.
Not.
No chance.
There's a better chance that I'll be there by 1230 today with 400 home untouched for everybody.
Let's have it in the grand.
Online.
What's your take on the much-hack Mel Gibson-Pas and Christ movies are pull-quies today?
Some votes coming in already, no, we got it, we have to use Scoot Up.
38 votes, I wouldn't watch it if they paid me 11.
Mel Gibson and his father are both Nazis, 10.
I will see it for. I might see it if I hear it's good for.
Non-believer should just ignore it for.
Even the Pope would be proud of this marketing, that's what I voted for.
I'm going to say it's a great victory and I definitely won't see it too absolutely positively.
Absolutely not.

My life and locals, this is for Toyota by City.
You ain't who I am.
If Jesus walked deep for today and one is to lose weight.
Like Jared.
To look good for that special lady on a special date hypothetical.
To lose it to an excise would be quite a feat.
Even for Jesus.
So here's the question.
What would Jesus eat?
Swiss cheese.
Positoli.
Miracle whip.
He'd have no other.
Thomas's English muffins.
Out in Virgin Bloody Mary.
John or his mother.
Lucky charms.
You guys are supposed to sing because he cured the leprechauns.
He did actually cure leprechauns.
What he did was he cured leprechauns.
Leprechauns.
Oh, I remember calling him.
You just read that this mountain is an agent.
Leprechauns.
Okay, here.
Into food paper.
That's better.
Devil's ham.
No way.
Hearts of poms.
Tell us more.
On ice cream.
Make us a cup of palm all Sunday.
Yeah, yeah.
That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.
I guess we'll see this one in.
Thank you, move buddy.
Bye, oh man.
And then, because he went to buy his groceries.
He'd redeem coupons.
And all the stores employees.
And he went cross-frame to get all trim and fits.
And one thing that he would not eat.
He would not eat shit.
Shut your mouth.
I'm just talking about Jesus with me.
Uncle Benskenverted Rice.
He's the heathen and cheeseburger in paradise.
Chicken Allocain.
Holy Allah.
Popeye's chicken.
What?
Popeye's chicken.
Popeye's chicken.
Oh, Popeye's chicken.
Oh, I did.
Did I do that again?
I missed red one.
He was a carpenter, but their diet would not do.
Carren carpenter's dieting proof it isn't good for you.
He wouldn't eat cakes for just a proof.
He was a real man.
And since he was raised Jewish, he'd have to pass on the heavenly hand.
That's one of Jesus' words.
Oh, right.
26-11 at 5.60 W.Q.M.
Happy Tuesday.
You're moderately happy Tuesday.
Things just start to look really grim.
I'll say that right now.
And against the Patriot Act.
See, even he don't like the Patriots.
There was again that night, by the way,
Patriots won the Super Bowl, which everybody's forgotten now,
because of the big plack over nothing.
Not even a totally bearded breast partially covered booby.
And America's falling apart, coming apart at the seams.
Now, the same people who were falling apart
when the movie Priest was released,
and the movie Temptation of Last Temptation of Christ were released,
those people now are urging everybody to go see this.
See, I happen to be one of those very strange people
who believe that anybody with the money to make a movie can go make it,
and you can either go see it or not.
What a concert.
Yeah.
The same people that were having a nervous breakdown about the Godfather,
because it was ethnically, it was an ethnics smear against all Italians,
or Sicilians, or whatever they're like.
All these people I want to censor everything that we have an option to sing,
go see it or not.
It's a case maybe.
So I have no problem with that.
But some Jesus scholars have a problem with this movie.
Mel Gibson's portrayal of the final 12 hours of Jesus,
and his film The Passion of Christ has been hailed as the Gospel of truth
by some believers.
But many scholars complained that it's riddled with historical errors.
You believe that?
Oh my God.
Not Mel.
Would Mel make any mistakes?
I noticed that.
Look what's leading on our poll right now.
Out of the 102 votes, Mel Gibson got the father of Paul Matys,
leading with 20 votes.
Well, I got a three-way tie at 21.
In fact, I think, well, you probably had a mate.
Oh, yeah.
No, as a matter of fact, I will see it.
23.
It just moved ahead.
The militant Catholics, probably European people are the ones that are hopping out.
Oh, I'm going to go see it.
It's about Jesus, the Lord and Savior.
Yeah, rub your rosaries while you're doing it.
Okay.
Rub them wrong.
And be sure and take your crucifix, because that'll ward off any evil spirit.
Who might be there in the cinema?
They're the pirates.
That is correct.
And not only that non-believers, there can be pretty evil.
Anyway, the complaints of the Jesus scholars range from inaccuracies about
hairstyles and clothing, which fits in with that that we just played the Bob and Tom bit about what would Jesus eat.
Right.
Hairstyles and clothing to a lack of gospel context in the film,
which is raised a fear among Jewish groups,
who fear its graphic, fear.
Ah, don't talk about the president that way.
Among Jewish groups who fear its graphic depiction of the crucifixion will fan anti-Jewish violence.
Oh, hey!
Gibson, who was denied the film as anti-Semitic, is saying he can saw the scholars, theologians,
priest and spiritual writers before scripting the film,
were the aim of making Jesus agony during the crucifixion appears realistic as possible.
Evangelical preacher Billy Graham, of course, called a film a lifetime of sermons in one movie.
Experts say his first mistake was having his character speak Latin and Aramaic.
You want to know why?
Why?
Because Greek was the language spoken in Jerusalem during Jesus' time,
along with Aramaic and some Hebrew spoken by the Jews.
Jesus, talking to Pasha's pilot and pilot to Jesus in Latinx land, John Dominic Crosan,
a professor religious studies at the Chicago based Roman Catholic DePaul University,
I mean in your dreams, he said it would have been Greek.
Greek?
That's what they were into in those days.
They were into Greek.
Latin was reserved for officially creed or used by the elite.
Most Roman centurions in the whole land spoke Greek rather than Latin historians and archaeologists told Reuters.
The mistakes experts say didn't stop with the wrong language,
which Crosan, who speaks Latin, said was so badly pronounced in the film that it was almost incomprehensible.
Oh boy.
Don't you think they're just nitpicking out?
Yes.
He has a long hair, Jesus.
Jesus didn't have long hair, said physical anthropologist Josiahs,
who has studied hundreds of skeletons found in archaeological digs in Jerusalem dig.
I did.
Jewish men back at antiquity did not have long hair.
Okay.
The Jewish text ridicule long hair is something Roman or Greeks said in why he was Lauren Shipman,
along with extensive writings from the period experts also point to a freeze on Rome's arc of Titus,
erected after Jerusalem was captured in 70 AD to celebrate the victory,
which shows Jewish men with short hair taken into captivity.
Eronius depictions of Jesus in Western Antibovina misled filmmakers in their portrayal of Jesus,
experts said, and it goes on and on and on, etc.
A lot of mistakes in there.
But it's fiction, just like the whole story is fiction, so why not go and have a good time?
It's a lifetime of service.
And I will go and see it as leading right now.
Hallelujah, man.
The Catholics are back.
The believers.
Jesus Christ.
21.4% of this heathen crowd, 29 people out of 135 said,
I will see it.
Of course, I think Miguel voted a few times.
Fuck third man.
He haven't all popped up under yet.
You're a good friend, Miguel.
The brainwashed one.
And at the same time, we're talking about, this is pretty damn irreverent of you to be thanks to me,
more priest stories while we're talking about this Jesus story.
It's a good day for priest stories.
It is not.
Sure it is.
Are you trying to tell me that every day is a good day for priest stories if only if the sun comes up.
A $20 million lawsuit has been brought against the oblate fathers and is that like Oblada,
Oblique and father Alfredo Prado, no kind of Edgar Prado either the musician or the jockey,
the fugitive oblate.
What is an oblate?
I don't know.
Fuck.
Are you kidding me?
Kind of like a bassoon, but a little bit lower, I think.
Who fled his order and joined a Doomsday cult in Costa Rica?
Ricardo Salinas, a former San Antonio resident who said Prado sex on Wednesday in 1967,
filed a suit in state court in California.
Salinas, 50 former parishioner of Prados at St. Timothy's Catholic Church in San Antonio,
said the attack occurred when he was 14, a young man, and had approached Prado for counseling about problems with his father.
He got me drunk and raped at him.
Salinas said when I tried to tell my mother she wouldn't believe me.
And while who would?
Right.
Ain't nothing like that Jesus Jews.
I wonder if they drink in Jesus Jews in a movie.
I'm a fighter, the local, this is 560 out of the photocrystals.

Those who want to change the meaning of marriage will claim that this provision requires all states and cities
to recognize the same-sex marriages performed anywhere in America.
Congress attempted to address this problem in the Defense of Marriage Act by declaring that no state must accept another state's definition of marriage.
My administration will vigorously defend this act of Congress.
Yet there is no assurance that the Defense of Marriage Act will not itself be struck down by activist courts.
And that of every state will be forced to recognize any relationship that judges in Boston, the official consensus goes.
Choose to call a marriage.
How do you like this? Well, President Teyes, make it an official now as the fascism continues.
It's just get the big boots on right now. Start marching around your living room or your back room.
Talk about a lot of people in the back room right now.
Constitutional amendment to prevent gay marriages.
It's right.
You evil faggot.
He has always strongly believed that marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman.
What House Press Secretary Scott McLean be saying?
He said the President wants to end growing confusion that's arisen from court decision in Massachusetts and San Francisco permitting more than 3,000 same-sex unions.
The President believes it's important to have clarity. He wants to make it queer, a clear.
The union of a man and woman is the most enduring human institution.
Honoring, honored and encouraged in all cultures.
And by every religious faith.
Except in the ages of experience of taught humanity.
That the commitment of a husband and wife.
To love and to serve one another.
Promote the welfare of children.
And the stability of society.
You might mention my name to rice master Gary.
Yeah, when you talk to him, W. Be sure to mention my my name.
Your gay. 10.47.
10.47.560. W.D.Q.M.
It's all like a big avalanche of crap coming down on us and the public is going to be like, oh my god.
What's going on over here?
Boy, Ellis Rubin, take that.
Boy, talk about taking it.
That's probably what Setem off decided to do it today when he saw that Ellis Rubin story.
That would put anybody over the edge.
Upstage the gun, Ellis. You lose.
What's your take on a much hyped Mel Gibson, past of the Christ movie?
Jesus.
190 votes. I will see it 43.
Well, hey, have a good time.
Okay, bring your old popcorn.
Maybe a few juju bees.
Mel Gibson and his father are both Nazis.
33.
I wouldn't watch it if they paid me 32.
Even a pulpit be proud of this marketing.
28. He's jealous.
I definitely won't see it 27.
I might see it if I hear it's good.
15. Oh, it's not just good. It's great.
And nonbelievers you just ignore it 7.12.
So we got a whole variety of choices there for you.

Mel Gibson in a movie.
Big Boy on my...
fat ass.
Sid sends me along facts.
Here it says, I've been a fan since the first Golf War.
Consider myself a bit of a radio file.
Here's like giving me through the day with a smile while
I'm forming me a pertinent items from a perspective I agree with.
I agree with.
I was going to say it.
I've also been a stern fan since he came into the market and
enjoyed different talk shows, non sports except for the
mad dog, mostly because there's no alternative.
I listen to Schmidt simply because he's on the dial.
There's nothing else I enjoy.
I'm not sure how much of a stern you listen to as in none,
although I presume very little.
None.
And I have to tell you that you were completely right last week
and saying the content on that show is going to be atrocious.
Not that he's still programmed pretty much as before for now,
but they dump him so many times that stories become unintelligible
and frankly intolerable.
A good portion of yesterday and today shows him in arguing with the GM about how
Schmidtie has show sounds with all the cut-ups and makes everybody gunshine
lame afraid of saying anything.
The miserable turd Michael Powell is going to destroy the only thing that
brightens the sometime miserable days and nights we endure our entertainment.
W and his cronies are ruining our country with a speed of hunts overtaking
a village of women.
Schmidt, this country is nothing but a village of women and the religious
right is the hunn, the hunn throng that will take away all of our liberties as we
whimper in a snivel in a corner.
Fortunately for me, I'm a Canadian-born American, about to give my EU passport
thanks to my walk-descent and speak three languages fluently, something that's
a valuable asset in every civilized country except this one.
Within the decade I'm out of here, the Bush rights can have the entire thing,
see you at the border, keep it up for as long as you can, old man, sit.
Nice going, Sid, see you kid, see you around, eh?
1056 at 560, every religious faith prohibits, gay marriage and of course those
of us who don't belong, any religious faith, those who are agnostics, those who are
atheists, we have no place in George Bush's America, keep that in mind.
The entire of the same boring old communion wafers at holiday mass, open wide
view and prepare to receive vice-saviors.
Oh geez, father of malee wafers again.
Now Billy, this isn't just any wafers.
It's not?
No, for the divine miracle of transubstantiation I've turned this ordinary wafer into the divine
blessed body of Christ.
Well why does the body of Christ have to be so much more than a mere human being?
Christ have to taste so yucky.
Spice of your next communion with new Christa Roni.
Christa Roni is a special blend of rice, spices and seasonings plus a bit of the body of Christ in every fluffy forkful.
And Christa Roni cooks up perfect every time, as he should.
Hmm, can I have some more Christ father?
That's Christa Roni Billy.
Amen to that.
Christa Roni, the transubstantiation tree.
It's 11 o'clock at 560 W.M.
Happy Tuesday to you man.
Happy ass Wednesday tomorrow.
Mary Cheney urged to fight a ban on same sex marriage as her president is, uh,
evacuating right now.
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.
This is an issue of great importance to America.
And I would ask of course the obvious question when he says, loud, I would say,
Why?
Why does anybody care what difference does it make?
How does it change anything?
Hey, did we already have this, uh, if I may interrupt?
Yes, Dean Ripping, Nader.
It was, uh, that's what do you mean?
Did we have it?
We already have it on the website and everything.
We don't need it on the website.
I saw it yesterday and he got up there and he said basically the same thing
they were all saying that Nader, you're a silly old fossil and cut the crap
and quit the, you know, spawn on a party and get lost.
I just checked it.
Yeah.
You didn't see that?
No.
And then I thought the most important part of his speech was at the end when he said,
for emphasis, the Nader still ain't listening because his ego, man,
what a pompous ass.
We've got 85 million different stories on the site about, uh, everybody ripping Nader.
And rightfully so, what a jackass, what a simple, and what a foolish old man.
At least call me your hair, you silly goose.
God.
He looks real presidential, don't he?
No.
He got some conditioner.
Yeah, get some hair spray, you idiot.
Man.
70 years old and he just refuses to take no for an answer and he's, excuse me,
and well, he's going to bring all this activism to the campaign and raise a lot of issues
that the other candidates wouldn't because they're all the establishment of Yadda.
And in the meantime, nobody's paying any attention.
You know more Ralph?
God.
You like if Channel 6 propped up Ralph Rednecks' body in the chair and tried to pedal to 6 o'clock news.
Although probably a big improvement over a lot of what's on the year in South Florida.
Anyway, thousands of gay rights supporters are posting open letters on the Internet urging Mary Cheney,
the Dijk, I mean, the Vice President's daughter, to speak out against amending the Constitution
to ban same-sex marriage.
The campaign targets Cheney 34 because she is openly gay and is running her father's part
of the Bush Cheney re-election campaign, but hasn't taken a, oh, and speak at our fruit cakes, wow!
You wonder why MSNBC has nobody watching?
No.
Let me give you a clue.
Okay.
Who I'm talking about, ballet dancer.
Uh, Reagan?
Brony Reagan Jr.
I'm going to tell you seriously, this is the truth.
I didn't make this up.
They have both of his feet weighted most seriously with lead weights.
They have him weighted down to the ground so he won't take off like Peter Pan.
I'm telling you, man.
He is the Jesus' spikes.
All these screamers you've been seeing get married out there in San Francisco and more power to him, you know,
but all the clones with the mustaches, all the stereotypical screamers,
they are like Hercules compared to Ron Reagan Jr. that lady.
I mean, get a life.
Get serious, sweetheart.
At least she talks real about it.
Anyway, she's running her fondest part of the Bush-Chainy Relection campaign,
but hasn't taken a public position on the proposed federal marriage amendment.
As an opian lesbian, it was worked for years as a public advocate for gay civil rights.
You're in a unique position to defend yourself and your community in this dire hour,
the website, deermary.com says in a model letter.
Deermary.com.
John Aravosis, the Washington Political Consulter,
has set up the site of nods that it's an unusually personal challenge to a member of Vice President Cheney's family.
If I were a fly in a White House wall, I think they might be saying,
wow, this is very personal.
And we would say, you're right, this is very personal Aravosis said.
The White House has no problem publicly discussing whether my family's relationships are valid and healthy
yet they refuse to discuss their own.
Jennifer Miller-Wise, a spokesman for the Bush-Chainy campaign, declined to comment on behalf of the campaign in Mary Cheney, of course.
She don't want to touch it with your hand.
The Constitutional Amendment banning same-sex marriage in their own states.
California has no such provision in their constitution.
And that's where Mayor Gavin Newsom is finding his strength behind his argument is that the same-sex couples in the state of California deserve the same equal protection
under the law that heterosexual couples enjoy when they are allowed to marry.
And since his decision to allow marriage licenses for gay couples in the city of San Francisco,
there have been over 3,200 couples come forward to receive their marriage licenses.
Many of them from out of state and the concern among opponents of gay marriage is that many of these couples will go back to their home states,
try to challenge the state laws there, challenge their employers, challenge insurance companies to provide them with equal benefits,
equal to what heterosexual couples now enjoy.
Since the website went online, February 13, more than 8,000 pleas to marry Cheney have been posted.
Aerosols said the set is also raised more than 10 grand for ads drawing attention to Cheney's public silence and has invited public participation in devising them.
One proposed ad which over face on a milk carton over the headline, have you seen me?
How do you like that?
And that goes down about the log cabin Republican facts, which of course, oh we're going, this is all going too far.
Yeah, right, like Alice Rantell, go see Alice, okay? He's a real eye-popper.
Here's a John who, fact, says, I almost threw up a lunch yesterday. In fact, I did.
I went home for lunch, it was channel surfing and low. I found a wonderful Jim Baker with his own show again coming from Branson, Missouri.
The total asshole Jim Baker with his new wife, Laurie, a 10-year-old, like was preaching to the biggest collection of losers I've ever seen my begging for money during his partner's club.
Are you living in fog the favor of God Baker's new lame slogan? Fog the favor of God.
I cannot believe the scumbag is back on television and that bigger scumbags are contributing to him so much for Christianity.
I guess God forgives everybody even scumbags. Check out his begging website. No, I'll pass. I don't want to do that. I'll pass.
Oh. Now, what is this thing you sent me from the New Yorker which goes on forever? Well, I always say you the first page.
Oh, there's like, shall I read it? New York from the New Yorker?
Well, a lot of people are interested in finding out what the folks are thinking about it besides the believers.
The ones who already are, you know, that's like the preaching of the choir thing. The ones who are the developed believers. Those are the 22% in this audience who say, I will see it.
And, you know, they're entitled to do that. Of course, the rest of us aren't entitled to whatever we want to do, but that's beside the point.
Fascism lives in America, baby. No mistake about it.
Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.
The Super Bowl and Janet Jackson's booby and then Michael Powell and then everybody having an nervous breakdown and congressional hearings.
You know, the thing about 9-11, here it is. It's almost the middle of 2004 already and they're just getting congressional hearings going to fight out how to come 9-11 happened back in 2001.
But we have a booby on network TV and right away with it. A matter of days we've got congressional hearings convened and a drag in Mel Carmeson and this one in that one.
And how dare you do this and we're going to take away your license and we're going to put you all in jail.
And so, above the love sponges off the air, Howard Stern show has been diluted like a big bowl of water has been like it's bathing in the Atlantic Ocean.
Now, would you tell the story you were telling me this morning about somebody who listens to Howard show? Yeah, what about it?
About how the minute and a half delay in all of this? Oh, yeah, it used to have, I guess it was a double delay or one delay.
He's got 30 seconds and now it's a minute 30. So, they have four people sitting with dump buttons waiting to dump stuff.
Father, he says at the first time they can catch it the second time or the third time and just wear them out.
And the rumor is that Stern is so pissed off with management and he hates the general manager anyway at infinity that he's ready to go on here and do everything he can to try to get fine so that they'll blow him out because the Mel Carmeson dictum from infinity and from Viacom says not only with the out-air talent.
Be fire but also the general manager the program director everybody involved all these people and the dog right the dog done it.
So, Howard's going to see if he can get them fired because you know he'll be fine. Now, he'll be fine. He's only got two 300 million more money.
And Jesus Christ. California pulled their carry 56% Edwards 24 and everybody else a small potatoes.
Consent is in sharp then 50 6 to 24 for carry in pretty scary.
Today we got three of primaries going on nobody cares about because it's Hawaii and Idaho and Utah.
Anyway, the New Yorker critic David Denby writes and I have a redness yet only the first page.
I don't want to do too much reading. They want to get 80 million calls on here about what's going on in your America.
Although we do have 71 people 21.8% see they will see the Mel Gibson movie. That's leading our poll.
Of course, the other ones are all chopped up in a different category.
Because if you take away 21.8% the rest of these like 78.2% right.
You're asking me a math question. 78.2. I'm a genius at math. I don't know anything else.
Although I do know the sun is shining in Toronto.
In the passion of the crap. I just said that in case cast and old balls is listed now right now some material.
What being between looking now. He's probably listening right now because Rick Sanchez just went off at 11.
He's probably looking the TV screen.
In the passion of the Christ Mel Gibson shows little interest in celebrating the electric charge of hope and redemption that Jesus Christ brought into the world.
He largely ignores Jesus hard-stopping eloquence. His startling ethical radicalism and personal radiance Christ is a paragon of vitality and public assertion is John up like to describe Jesus' character in his essay.
The Gospel according to Saint Matthew.
Cecil B. DeMille had his version of Jesus' life, pure power will pass Alenian Martin's corset he had theirs, and Gibson of course is free to skip over the incomparable glories of Jesus' temperament and to devote himself as he does to Jesus' pain and murdered him in the last 12 hours of his life.
As a viewer I'm equally free to say that the movie Gibson is made from his personal obsessions is a sickening death trip, a grimly unaluminating procession of treachery, beatings blood and agony, and to say so without indulging an anti-Christian sentiment, Gibson's term for what his critics are spreading.
For two hours with only an occasional pause or gentle flashback, we watch stupified as a handsome strapping at times half naked young man is slowly tortured to death.
Gibson is so thoroughly fixated on these scourging and crushing of Christ, so meagerly involved in these spiritual meanings of the final hours that he falls in danger of altering Jesus' message of love into one of hate.
And against whom will the audience direct its hate?
As Gibson was completing the films, Homestore and Steel Oceans had perjuven accused him of emphasizing the discredited charge that was the ancient Jews who were primarily responsible for killing Jesus, the Jews, the claim that it served as the traditional justification for the persecution of Jews in Europe or nearly to millennia.
The critics turned out to have been right. Gibson is guilty of some serious mischief in his handling of these issues, but he may have also committed an aggression against Christian believers.
The movie has been held as a religious experience by various Catholic and Protestant groups, some of whom with an ungodly eye to the commercial realities of film distribution, have pre-purchased blocks of tickets or rented theaters to ensure the passion of healthy, opening weekend business.
But how I wonder will people become better Christians if they're filled with the guilt anguish or a loathing that this movie may create in their souls? How about the rest of this story?
The headline on the story is nailed. That's the title of the column, nailed.
That's bad. By the way, have you got your nails yet?
69 of pop. I can get them cheaper.
Get them cuter nails, baby. Let's have a sale for nails. Right outside there in a corner of Ives-Derry in 441.
And then maybe when we raise that extra money for a Boca Brian for that 50 bucks a week that they want to cut them back, one more spot sales department, okay?
Just one more spot for a couple of hundred man. That'll do it easy. Take care of a month. Just one spot a month more.
And that'll take care of that little pittly pocket change that they're squabbling about. Much of cheap bastards them.
I think that if there is a hell, I really do really do believe some of them people are going to be in it, you know?
Yeah.
I don't want to say the beastlies.
They receive none of the protections that other families receive. For example, I pay each and every week into the Social Security system.
But if I die, my family will not get Social Security.
Well, it's George Bush's American now, honey. So just cut the die crap.
12 minutes after 11 at 5.60. I think we're going to have to call on Jan Arena not a sticker finger in the die. Don't you?
Kind of like plug all of the holes that are hitting on them.
I'm serious. I'm serious. There's some terrible things happening in the American system right now. I think we have to get old Janet back. She's the only one who could have a tour.
Let's her president.

John Cruz is the last Scientologist, unless you count John to voltage, Jenny Elfman, and a few other gullible Hollywood airheads.
The last Scientologist is now playing with your mind in a theater near you.
11-17, here's a fact from Al, who says the more I learn about how this country's getting flushed down the toilet tomorrow, I want to move to Canada, eh?
But someone I know informed me they saw a store on TV about the Yazuka running rampant to the point of public shootouts in Canada. Have you heard anything about that? The one?
Yakuza. What did I call it? Yakuza. What's the Yakuza? The Japanese Mafia.
Oh, right. Whatever you say, I don't get carried away. Certainly not here at Toronto. The Yakuza. Yeah, they're shooting up. I've never heard of the Yakuza.
Really? I've heard of the Yakuza. Anyway, here's now, let's get back to serious stuff. Okay, please, pretty please. Sony Shana is beautiful. It's a little on the chilly side, but nevertheless.
Get back to Howard Stern. Okay. Now, I want, first of all, I don't want to like to say to you so, but you remember those days when after 9-11 and the days when after March of this year, when they are last year when they invaded Iraq and certain people on the earth, I don't want to mention no names.
Okay. But certain people who in the past had always been very ultra liberal and cutting edge and very anti-establishment, all of a sudden started goose stepping in line and supporting the Bushmeister and how it's firm was one of those.
Do we call that? No. I didn't hear it, but we had reports. Yes. And of course, I'm thinking to myself while the day is going to come when he's going to rule that decision.
And I wonder what he's thinking of himself now about how he's been stabbed in the back by the very people he was supporting and man, Cal. Right. That's right.
Man, Cal, of course, has always been a right-winger, which I still find that hard. Well, even right-wingers want to get laid. At least he's honest about that.
But I wonder how he feels about it now that they're getting fine in Chicago big time. Anyway, so here's the report on this fact. It's a Stern wants to leave the ear now because today they dumped the word thrust when it followed anal.
Anal thrust and they dumped the word thrust. Oh boy. Now I will say this because infinity, you know, Viacom has got a lot more stake than some others, although the beesleys, you know, they spent their whole life pretending to be in this business.
So they certainly don't want to lose anything. But with Viacom, that was directly related to course with CBS MTV, the whole Janet Jackson flap. So that's where it's all centered now.
So they came out with that directive that we read on the year last week and are just having an oversprake down it if you do this and if you say that.
And if you see K, but at any rate, be sure and say hi for us. I'll tell you. He said, hey, okay, okay. Say hey, K.
So I'm looking at the now I do have to say this for beastly broadcasting. I can't say too much, but generally speaking, they pretty much let us all always do our thing.
And number two, this programming content policy form that we're all having to sign, which I signed this morning.
You're and again, they're not the ones who are making these regulations. You don't understand that the individual companies are the ones saying, oh, well, you can't do this.
No, they're not the ones having a fit. It's the FCC with all the threats now. Just like the threat to start in on cable. That's why you ought to look at Sophia, Vergarazas and all the other pictures we post on our website every day because you may never see them again.
Why is it stopped? Where does it stop with these Nazi bastards? Because that's exactly what they are. This is fascism at its worth. Forget about free speech because they just make it up as they go along. Here's an example.
National standard of patent defensiveness in order to be found in decent. The language involved whether explicit double on time in you end or sound effects must constitute a patented offensive description or depiction of a sex act organ or expatriate function.
In determining whether language is patented offensive hour, which is important to realize to recognize that local community standards are not used. See, always they used to be up until this group of fascists came and they just changed it arbitrarily. Forget about local standards.
Rather the F.C.C.C.C. considers whether an average adult listener in the United States would find the broadcast matter patently offensive and the FCC will rely on its own expertise in determining the standards of the average adult listener.
For this reason, the F.C.C.C. is held at the actual popularity among adults residing in the market where programmers will not insulate material from a finding of indecency. So even if you have the number one rated show, even if Howard Cernan has a 45 share in your market, it doesn't make any difference how popular it is because if there's one asshole in that market who doesn't like the show, then we're going to take their word forward and we're going to say, hey, guess what we're going to find you ask or kick you off the earth or both.
That sounds like a good system.
And average adult listener in the F.C.C.C. will rely on its own expertise in determining what that is.
Now you see, if you ask me if an average adult listener in the US would be offended by that, I would say no way.
And there's no way that even the F.C.C.C. would push that. You know what I'm saying? No chance. No way, even these fascists.
So that's about as much as we can do. Maybe one of those, maybe, how will those? That's it. Don't hit the wet one.
Oh no.
Oh, that's the one. I always wanted to. I was saving the last for best, best for last, whatever it is.
Don't forget, look for the QM Band today, new to two of the Shell gas stations. That's on the corner of 136th Avenue, which is Panther Parkway.
Of course, in sunrise Boulevard. Stop by now. Who's going to be there? Scott? Yes.
Oh, man, you ain't seen nothing that you've met Scott. Stop by the registered one, a pair of front row tickets to an upcoming Panthers home game.
And then, again, plus the first five people to show up to the fan receive a pair of tickets to see the Caps game this Friday.
And of course, they're given tickets away with the Panthers, very sad. But we're giving them way to noon to two with these Shell gas stations right there by McDonald's, corner of 136th and sunrise Boulevard and prestige as sunrise.
I'm glad you facts me the other pages of this. It's a very long review, which I will get to. But before that, since we're talking about all this attack on everything that you want to see and hear and read.
And don't let me forget. I will read that thing about cable again. I think I'm going to read that every day. You should.
WDQ, I am hello. Good morning. How are we doing? Okay, sir. Can we agree that religion is for like the people in need and they're searching for hope?
The answer is all about the need of what? You mean we need something like a crutch? I need a line?
I'm switching to the channel yet today. I see this Christian channel, whatever. So the lady says that a couple people got healed on the set of the movie of passion for Christ.
Yeah, that's because they probably fell and broke their arm or something. They got healed in a cast. She says that a blind man got healed and a deaf man started hearing whatever.
So then this man that was interviewing goes, well, I have a prediction that everybody that a lot of people who are going to go see this movie in the theaters are going to be healed when they walk out.
Oh, absolutely. I don't think there's any doubt about that. Now, do you see that? There's only one thing that's going to be healed with this movie, sir.
And it's Mel Gibson's bank account. Okay, that's going to be healed. Big time. Now MTV under attack by the FCC. Where does it stop?
And let me say it again. MTV is a cable network. Right. MTV does not come in your living room into your bedroom, into your attic, into your anywhere over the year.
It's a cable subscription only network. You have to willingly pay money to somebody to bring you MTV on your cable package. Okay.
But Janet Jackson's Super Bowl flashed less than three seconds, but the impact continues to ripple through via a com.
The media giant that broadcast the Super Bowl game Congress. See here we go again with Congress. If you're going to wait for Congress or John Kerry or anybody else to bail you out of this, forget about it.
And going to happen or Ralph Nader. Congress the FCC right wing radio commentators. Now, where all the Nader did call the other day for Bush to be impeached. I give marks for that. Nobody's listening.
I told you that months ago. Congress the FCC right wing radio commentators and outrage citizens are calling for a stricter decency standards and the artists and executives who make the living from aging music performances and videos are in retreat. See, it's a good.
It's a good way to deflect the whole wagon dog thing that hold it to deflect attention for your own problem. Use him as an example.
Pointing your fingers. He's perverted.
The hell they are. And take the spotlight over your own personal failings. The word hypocrite comes immediately to mind.
MTV in particular, which produced the Super Bowl halftime shows in the midst of a wide scale real valuation of its musical news dramatic content as the rest of the world is peeing in their pants laughing at the USA again. Not only they hate us, but now they're laughing at us again.
Within a week of the game, MTV no stranger to criticism most recently responsibly Britney Spears Madonna kiss at the video musical wars. Oh gee, the world came to an end on that almost.
Almost.
On seven music videos out of prime time. And if I could tell you how this just frost my fat old ass, one of the videos was singled out for political content, incubus, mega lomaniac included clips of Hitler and people drinking oil.
That's got to be one of the great videos in the history of the human race. That may be the best ever. See it here like every five minutes.
The other six contains sexual content. See the first of all the idea of political content. Do you understand what we're talking about boys and girls? It's being censored because of political content.
You get it. Are you following the bouncing balls? Are you understanding what the hell we're talking about here? A video on a subscription channel.
Mm hmm. Being censored because of its political content. Right. The six others contain sexual content. Britney's see through body suit and toxic to women kissing in blink 182's. I miss you. A PG roll of PG 13 rolled in the sheets in room five. This love and general rum shaking in ludicrous splash waterfalls.
Cassidy's hotel and the in gang twins salt shaker as the February 15th MPV reintroduced six of these videos including an alternate version of blink 182's clip that doesn't show the same sex kiss. Oh thank God. I feel so much safer now. Oh my God. Just at the time we were ready to fall apart.
27 past 11 and five 60. I'm going to tell you seriously if I had a if I had a football right now, I would show it up to our strap. He is just not doing his thing for us. Yeah.
Yeah. Did he come back to you with any answers to your questions? No. No. Tried to boy. You're out. Troy. I just talked to the folks. They said you're out. Back to the fish. Anyway, Katrina's on balance for life. She's lost. What is it?

Oh, that's a beautiful thing. I just got to right now.
Wow.
Man, Michael Powell. What a ass. I think it's an all new thing.
Oh, man. How soon we going to get that one up there? Oh, let you know as soon as it's there. Oh, that is just a phenomenal thing.
Yeah. Wow. Talk about them. Seen important graphic. Mr. Powell. You phony hypocrite. Take a look at the size of those babies. And what a ass.
If you ask me, okay, I'm going to do it again. I think I may read this at some point during the show every day. There's a lot more about the MTV thing. I'll get to it.
Okay. I do want to take a lot of calls, though, especially line nine Q. I. M.
I'm Neil Rogers. Yes, sir. Hi. How are you? Pretty good. I've been listening to you since 1986. And this is the first time I'm giving you a call. Excellent. Yes. I just wanted to say that I did listen to our certain months ago.
And when he was talking about and kind of condoning Bush's administration, he irritated me. And I would email him a couple of times. And he absolutely right. I think he is really going back on those comments that he made.
He's getting bit right on the ass. That by the same people that he was sucking up to. Exactly. I think up in here and Cleve. I'm listening from Cleve on the internet. He's lived down in Miami. Right.
And I think up here they're going to be taking on some of the seats before the Christ movie and put in some cues. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I listen. I really enjoy your show. I've been listening like I said since 1986. And I hope I'm going to be listening for a lot longer.
Well, listen, stay out of the pew, man. And have a great day. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Okay. What do you just say? You'll be one. You'll be you'll be a. He's a good guy. And thank goodness we're back on the streaming on the internet again.
Wonder how long they're going to let that go on.
Sure. So I want you people to understand you think that this is just melodrama or you'll get all bad out of shape or being real ultra liberal or whatever.
I'm telling you right now that if we're up to Michael Powell and the bush mice, they're enchanting all these other Nazis that are running your country.
You the only choices you'd have will be the ones who agreed with them. That would be it. You'd have Rush Limbaugh and Gordon Litty and Ali North and Michael Medved and Tom Shatat Schmidt.
Whatever the hell that guy's name is. And that would be it. And of course occasionally filled. Yeah, but wait. Yeah. But wait a second. Henry.
First rated by the profanity and nudity on television that culminated with Janet Jackson, Justin Tinkerbell, sexy, super will dance.
Angry lawmakers earlier this month raised the prospect of expanding the fight against indecency on television to cable networks for the first time.
Oh my god. In separate simultaneous hearing. And by the way, the constitutional memonon came marriages. It might they might actually take it up before the end of the year.
Not that it's going to be a political issue. Of course, they have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress to approve it or two thirds of the state's legislatures.
Good luck. Headed anyway. In separate simultaneous hearings, members of the House of Representatives and Senateful members of the FCC and the president of CBS Viacom, Mel Carmesan, that finds could just be the beginning of a new crackdown on profanity and decency on US airways.
And of course, they're the ones who are defining what's indecent, what's profanity. They're just making it up as they go along.
Most immediately, they appear headed toward passing legislation that would increase tenfold the fine on TV and radio broadcasters that violate FCC decency rules to a maximum of $275,000 per violation.
Lawmakers, including Republicans usually wary of government regulation, raise the possibility of getting even tougher, such as passing a three strikes in your off the air law that would revoke the FCC's licenses of repeat offenders.
We can have Christian music on every station all day. Reformers who focus on network television are missing 85% of the story because 85% of Americans now get their television program from people in TV, a satellite TV, FCC Chairman Michael Powell said you can see the lovely Chairman Powell on our website any minute now, even more lovely than the other picture we had before from a different angle.
As he shows his big fat welcome to the world. Senator John McCain, Republican and Arizona, favorite has suggested by the Consumers Union that Congress require cable and satellite operators to offer a la carte programming in which people pick and pay only for the channels they want.
God forbid that we should see Brittany and Madonna kissing again or some grotesque vulgar thing like that.
Congress would have to change rules governing the FCC before the Commission that expanded its oversight of cable TV because cable is a subscription service that doesn't use the public airwaves.
It has historically been out of the FCC's jurisdiction. But in the aftermath of the Super Bowl flap that grotesque halftime show those two seconds of perversion, Congress may be willing to give the FCC greater authority over cable.
This is all a dog and pony show man. This is just they're just waiting for an excuse. It's just like invading Iraq 9-11 came along unfortunately of course tragically, but they use this as an excuse to do what they already planned to do before and the same thing now.
They use the Janet Jackson Justin think about flap as an excuse to do whatever they want to be doing all along.
Let's get all the people off the air, all the outrageous people who generally other than man cow and certain other ones we know.
Okay, tend to be far to the left of where they're coming from. The new picture is up. The new picture is on eorages.com. Believe you me, you'll fall on your record. Make a look at that.

New Rogers R Sports Radio WQ-A-L
On the next quri ride, the Fuku 5 does send up my amy beach where they blend right in and pay a special surprise visit to Matt Drud.
Here we are!
Oh, hi! Come in, Waltzew.
What do you think?
Nothing for us to do here.
Look, sign, fellas. Let's go. Wait a second. What's this?
Uh-huh. A blow-up doll.
I never saw a blow-up doll of an old fat Jew before.
Oh, I forgot to put that away.
Who's supposed to be?
Oh, nothing really. Just a blow-up doll with Neil Rogers.
It's all too much.
Sayonara, lady boy.
It's 11.4416-5560-W-Q-A-M.
Man, it faxes the stuff or just pouring in here.
Well, that's right. This is the review by Roger Ebert that I just printed out.
Thought it was from you.
He said, of course, he sucks up because he was an ultra-boss.
So he sucks up pretty hard.
But he does say it's the most violent film he's ever seen.
He was an ultra-boy?
He was altered.
I said, boy.
Now it is.
It will probably be the most violent film you've ever seen.
He says, that's not a criticism, but an observation.
It's unsuitable for younger viewers, but works powerfully for those who can endure it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Oh, he says of the 126 movies that the movie lasts.
At least 100 minutes of that may be more concerned specifically and graphically
with the details of the torture and death of Jesus.
And again, he says, this is the most violent film I've ever seen.
Now, aren't these the same people, the religionists, who are always screaming about violence in the movies
and about how grotesque violence makes our kids go crazy and do grotesque,
or anything else?
And that what they're always saying?
Yeah, but at least it's not sexual.
But if it's about religion, then it's okay.
See?
If it's the Terminator, that's bad.
Right.
But if it has a religious context, and if we can help brainwash the masses,
make a lot of money for male and the boys, then it's okay.
Well, it's important for you to know just how much Jesus suffered for your sins, chew boy.
Oh, okay.
Thank you, Jesus.
Come in to QA and hello.
Hey, how you doing, Neil?
Pretty good, sir?
A couple of things.
One choice on the pole, if I may.
I'll wait till it comes out second-rentice.
Uh-huh.
And also, I don't know who makes choices, but let George know that on the pictures of the girls every day,
we'd like to see Oriola and Genofelia.
Okay, great.
We'll call up Michael Palancy when he says,
I'll get their gynecological love.
Not today.
I have any regulation over the internet yet.
Okay.
Not yet.
Who are you thinking about for tomorrow?
I don't know.
I'll go through the catalog.
I think it's a very tasteful picture of Sophia Vergara that we have on it.
And that's the line on the beach.
She's on the sand.
You don't see no nipples.
You don't know.
She only shows her cheeks.
Well, whatever she's willing to show you, that's right.
And of course, that's the end.
And of course, as an extra bonus.
Yeah.
Oh, man, I gotta go back to that homepage.
There it is.
Oh, is that a lovely thing?
Right above the old preparation rusting there, too.
Back to them.
Wow.
Careful about uncertain.
Maybe now let's see.
An old thrust was what they were concerned about in Howard Stern's show this morning.
Of course, that show, they've been, it's amazing.
They must do some really grotesque stuff on here because they're concerned about such minutiae.
Like, asshole, they won't even let Howard say douchebag, the infinity people.
For years, they've been bad out of shape about that.
Of course, if I was making the money, he was making what would I care what I could say, see?
Right.
I wouldn't say anything.
Right, there you go.
Placing music, Howard.
Oh, I didn't even see now.
I think that that's a mad and blending of Michael Powell and Celia Cruz.
That could be wrong.
Huh?
Don't you think?
Oh, that's a very good point.
I want everybody to take a look because look at the heels that that bitch is wearing.
I mean, whoever that is.
Oh, god, it's a bitch.
Beautiful thing.
Yes, I did.
Michael Powell, you're a bitch.
WQA, and hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Seeing that I listen to Marano, Patricia and the web.
I don't know where the tattoo starts or ends.
You know what I mean?
I do know what you mean.
Now, let me ask you, or George, have you heard any of that rumor that they have Osama Pinlott
and surrounded somewhere in Afghanistan?
Well, it's not a rumor.
It's a new story that they're creating.
They say, well, it's surrounded.
It's like saying we have you surrounded somewhere on the planet.
So it's kind of not legit then.
Well, I mean, I don't know who the hell knows whether they're telling the truth or for all we know.
They might have him now.
They might be waiting to spring.
And the big fall surprise, a month before the election, say, hey, look who we got.
I do know what I was going to turn everybody to the bush.
I don't think so.
I didn't know.
And in closing, Neil.
And in closing, Neil.
Yes.
Hank killed Jesus Christ.
Okay, great.
Beauty.
The Hebrew hammer.
Not going to Hebrew hammer.
Well, they probably used the Hebrew hammer to pound those spikes in this.
I would think so.
And don't forget to get your nails, right?
Those Peter nails.
I got a nine-inch nail.
An MTV news segment on sexual politics has also been delayed until outrage over the Super Bowl dies down to court MTV staffers.
This is on a cable channel.
California's Laguna Beach High School pulled out of an agreement to let that it work from a reality show based on students' lives.
And several record labels are toning down videos currently in production out of fear that they won't be shown according to industry sources.
The current state of the culture is different since one label executive who represents prominent hip-hop artists.
It's an election year and nobody wants to be made an example of how do you like that?
Please, please, go see.
Instead of seeing the passion of the Christ about of this crap is called, please go see reddit-biot-steel it at your DVD store,
bowling for Columbine, if you haven't seen it all.
Ready and even if you have to watch it again.
It's on cable right now. Go to a friend's house.
Right. It's on making a round on cable on the HBO's and movie channels and whatever else.
Go to a friend's house if you're too cheap to pay for it and they're moving to and watch it, bowling for Columbine.
And as he points out so well, all of this below it, but all of it's the violent movies and it's this and that.
The same movies, the same videos, the same everything they're shown here in Canada and all over the world, all over Europe anyway.
Tons of nudity, I'm talking about full nudity, nipples and you name it.
And the people aren't killing each other in their societies aren't crumbling and the world isn't laughing at them because they're all off tight.
Yeah, but they're probably all going to hell with it.
All the important things that we have to deal with and the best that these born again fundamentalist lunatics can do is start with this kind of crap.
It's just tragic, it's pathetic.
MTV executives refuse to come in for this article. This is enrolling stone by the way, even to describe programming changes.
A spokeswoman will only say we have to pay attention to what's happening in our culture.
Oh, thank you.
Other via, that's what you said.
Other via, com companies are taking a similar stance CBS Institute, they five and tape the lay for the Grammys and now all of the
Icom's broadcast properties, 39 TV stations and more than a hundred E five infinity radio stations are outfitted with the same capability.
Pop culture has been on a slippery slope for some time, said representative Fred Upton chairman of the House's Internet Telecom Subcommittee.
This was the straw that broke the camel's back.
Upton, a Michigan Republican, of course, what a shock, has been a key player in the fight to all potentially offensive programming.
He spots at a bill on January 13 that aims to raise the fines for broadcasters to tenfold.
The day after the Super Bowl, he also called via com president Mel Carmes and the complaint about that time show.
And a February 4th Wall Street Journal editorial headline via com's porn channel demanded that via com fire MTV president Judy McGrath.
via com was already seen as a repeater fender with MTV Comedy Central Howard Stern in the Opie and Anthony show on its payroll.
So when Carmes and declared that indecent and by the way Comedy Central is no other either.
It's another cable channel.
So when Carmes and declared that indecent he standards need to be clarified, representative Heather Wilson, Republican of Mexico could hardly control her anger.
I remember it well, her performance.
You knew what you were doing. She said of the Super Bowl with tears and arise.
You wanted us to be all a buzz. It lines your pockets.
She was nearly having a stroke, having a fit, pitching a fit. I almost had pitching a tent.
Well, the Indians can pitch a tent. Why don't you help Kent the white man?
Well, their grandfather did. Can't do no more.
Don't be saying pitch a tent no more.
I tell you another one. It's just dog. I mean, if it goes through this thing, I tell you what.
Can't play that no more.
So I'm going to have to add some more to the list. So you will have a partialist.
How about we're not doing it? It's going to be Duff and Clare.
Trosers can't play that unless, of course, we start putting our own bleep.
Yeah, how about a trouser? Yeah. Yeah.
You see what we're talking about, folks? This is what it's been reduced to is that you can't.
It all has to be reduced to the level of a five or six or 70-year-old child.
And even they would probably laugh in the rancers off at it.
What's your take on the much-hyped Mel Gibson patch to the Christ movie?
That's our pullquest on theorongers.com where you can also take a look at our chairman of the FCC.
Bracket.
His big fat one.
537 votes.
I will see it 113, 21%.
I'll tell you what, don't go see it. Send us the money instead.
Split it up, George and Josh will split up the money and go do good deeds.
Dan Strait.
Mel Gibson and his father are both Nazis.
90 of you said that.
Even the pope would be proud of this marketing 87.
That was my vote and a proudly.
I wouldn't watch it if they paid me 84.
I go to that.
I might see it if I hear it's good 69.
We should have put the other one on it that clown just called before and said, you know,
about a wait till I get a bootleg copy.
But anyway, we won't do that.
I might see if it's good 69.
Oh, 69.
And also with 69, I definitely won't see it.
See how that number keeps popping up.
I know.
Better take a picture of it and make sure that they understand we're not making those numbers up.
Oh, thank goodness. They just changed the 70 both of them.
And nonbelievers should just ignore it 25 out of 545 votes on the passion of the Christ.
You Christ killers.
W.C.A.M. Hello.
Yeah, I'm near Roger Schill.
Speaking, yes.
Oh, hey, Neil.
You're too fast, man.
I am fast.
Now, what do you think about putting a patent on a new fostering just in time for the movies,
maybe with the popcorn diet, Jesus, juice with with rhyme?
Not bad.
That would be pretty tasty.
Uh-huh.
Oh, let's try it.
Okay.
And how many Floridaians are going to be able to read the subtitles anyway?
560.
560.
560.
That's a great point about the fact that they spoke Greek.
And that only the the marketing mucks the higher ups with spoke Latin.
Everybody else spoke Greek.
So I'll confuse Mel with the facts because this is the the passion of Christ and the crucifixion of Christ according to Mel.
See, they should have put that in the title too.
According to Mel.
I would appreciate it more if it was like according to Mel Brooks, you know, the history of the world.
Somewhere out of the hood.
That would have been a real hoot and a horror.
It's your favorite sir, Blink 182.
It's this whole video everyday.
Probably better not play that because it's not even new yet.
Is it the new cleaned up video?
I don't know.
It might not be because it's on much music and they have a tendency to play them unexpergated.
They don't leap out the words because it's candidate and we're like a little more mature here than the Americans.
You know, how does it feel to have the whole world laughing at you?
The number one, they fear they're terrified.
Number one.
And so number two, they don't like Americans as much as they used to because they're afraid of them.
And so they're afraid of this attitude and number two, they're laughing at you.
So when you're on hand, they're afraid of you.
Yeah, that's what she said, but the other one is saying, be afraid.
Yeah, be very afraid.
So it's not a very pretty picture, you know?
Of course, if they laugh at us, you know what we can do.
That's right.
Grab unabomac rande.
That's right.
Just like that bit we got.
We got the bomb.
Just like Dennis Lewis says.
We got the big, big F and bomb.
Oh, I want to know what about that?
Can we still play that?
Wait.
I think we can.
I love that bit.
Right.
And how kindly to have turned out to be, even though you're not a big counter over the band.
Just like that.
Okay.
Yeah.
Love, touch up.
I know what's on it.
I have a great effect.
He just turned 96 on top.
Can't believe the language I hear home, TV.
I play every home of the word, it's an obscenity.
All right.
He used to be the cable.
It was a horror on words, but now the network's left there at just curse.
There's no wedding sites that visit sanity.
All the dialogue can take for vanity.
Swear it like a sailor on a pre-day pass.
Words a whole lot worse than ads.
Welcome.
F bomb, F bomb.
How long will it be before they drop the F on a word TV?
F bomb, F bomb.
There's no telling where the drop one of the UTM.
Oh my God.
Let me pick these six.
I love that.
And we can still play it.
I didn't find anything in there.
Now we will have to pass it through our committee, deaf and clearance.
Right.
Keep them off the streets.
Keep them out of trouble.
Keep our clearance away safely away from the beast.
Till he heals up a little bit.
And they can sit around.
I think that's a great idea.
We have over 5,000 comedy bits and sounds and drop-ins in our DCS computer.
For example, I don't think we can play it now.
We'll have to ask them.
I don't think we can do that.
I mean, if anal thrust was believed, of course that's not the commission.
That's the paranoia at infinity now.
That's everybody's eye.
The big spyglass is over their ass.
Let me ask you.
Which member of the committee is going to play?
Let me ask you a question.
Yes.
Which member of that committee is going to understand the significance of it?
It's a lashinga manera guwada.
See, now you notice he said member.
First he said ass and then he said member.
So you're not fooling me.
You may be fooling some of the slow people out there like Jeff and Clarence.
You're not fooling me.
You're not fooling me.
You're not fooling me only over my life.
Three minutes till noon at QM.

My life and walls this is 420 by city.
You ain't who I am.
Hey I'm Frao, Iliana, Rush Lateman.
And I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels.
And listening to the new rocket, I'm gonna use the hour.
Take care!
One, two, three, four.
My baby won't eat no branches.
All me to say she likes it bloody red.
My baby eats tons of chicken with some mayo mixed in dripping on the chin.
My baby just loves the lonely, only bring it only to damn this man.
My baby's a weirdo cheese, she's down to it when he's supposed to check it.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
If you wanna look great, lose a lot of that weight.
Yes, your seven-coity don't have faith.
But you can't have cheesecake, no you can't have cheesecake.
And no apple pie, nothing burned again.
If you're better shake it, pound the eggs and bake it soon.
You'll be as skinny as they play again.
If your butt is obscene, glowed upon the protein.
And before you know it, you're as extra-cheating.
Maybe somebody else sent Michael Paul to the Atkins book before it's too late, you know what?
Okay, cause it looks to me like he's ballooning up big time, I'm concerned about poor Michael.
From about three at five sixty WQM, they just showed a pool, CNN pool on,
should game marriages be recognized as legal in the US?
Thirty two percent yes and sixty four percent, which is all the more reason why this whole thing is obscene.
Yeah, bigotry hate.
See, for example, if they would have had a, before blacks were given a right to vote,
if they would have taken the nationwide pool, if we had a, or with it,
or, or, or, no, while see women are almost 50 percent, we're talking about minorities,
women at least population wise, they're just about even maybe a little more than men.
But I'm using an example of people representing small minority of the population.
And so when the majority can vote on whether those people have rights or not,
it's insanity. You can't do that.
The whole concept of the constitution to protect minorities from that kind of tyranny by the majority
is exactly the opposite of what they're going to do.
You better know your place.
You better know your place by getting it.
Oh, I do know it. It's called Canada.
And Amsterdam and Copenhagen and the Germany all over the world.
All over the rest of the world pretty much, except the course for real backward countries.
Oh, excuse me.
Now, get back to this. This is really great.
David Denver. I'm so glad somebody faxed this to us from the New Yorker.
Yes. The article called Nailed.
Mel Gibson's the Passion of Christ. I'm not going to read the whole thing.
I'm going to eliminate this one page because it just, but I will read the rest to important to pass over.
He says the passion in its confused way confirms the old justifications for persecuting the Jews.
And once somehow doubts that Gibson will make a sequence which he reminds the audience,
then in later centuries, the church itself used torture and execution
to punish not only Jews, but heretics, non-believers and dissidents.
I realized that the mere mention of historical research could exacerbate the awkward breach between medieval and modern minds,
between literalist belief and the weighing of empirical evidence.
John was an eyewitness Gibson has said. Matthew was there.
Well, they may have been there, but for decades it's been a commonplace of biblical scholarship that the gospels were written 40 to 70 years after the death of Jesus,
and not by the disciples, but by nameless Christians using both written and oral sources.
Gibson can brush aside the work of scholars and historians because he has a powerful weapon in hand, the cinema, with which he can create something greater than argument he can create faith.
As a movie maker Gibson is not without skill, the sets which were built in Italy, where the film was filmed are far from perfect,
but they conveyed the beauty of Jerusalem's courtyards in archways.
Gibson, working with the cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, gives us the ravaged stone face of Calvary, the gray light at the time of the crucifixion, the leaden pace of the movie's spectacular agonies.
Feliniesque, pormeters gamble and cheer on the sidelines, and at the time the world of figures around Jesus, both hostile and friendly, seems held in place by a kind of magnetic force.
The howling and suicide of the betrayer Judas is accomplished in a few brusque strokes. Here and there the movie has a dismal heavy-sold power.
By contrast with the dispatching of Judas, the lashing and flaying of Jesus goes on forever, prolonged by Gibson's punishing use of slow motion, sometimes with Jesus facing the foreground, so that we can see him riot and howl.
In the climb up to Calvary, Cavazel, one eye swollen, shut his mouth open and agony, collapses repeatedly in slow motion under the weight of the cross.
Then comes the crucifixion itself, dramatized with a curious fixation, on the technical details, an arm pulled out of its socket, huge nails hammered into hands, with Cavazel jumping after each whack.
At that point I said to myself, Mel Gibson has lost it, and I was reminded of what other writers have pointed out, that Gibson, as an actor, has been beaten, mashed and disemboweled in many of his movies, his obsession with pain disguised by religious feelings,
has now reached a frightening apopopiosis.
Mel Gibson is an extremely conservative Catholic who rejects the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, he's against complacent feel-good Christianity, and judging from his movie, he must despise the grandiose old Hollywood-key-ch of the role of the King of Kings, the greatest story ever told and been heard, with their hallmarked twinkling skies, their big star trading across sacred California sands, and their lamb-like Jesus, whose simple presence overwhelms Charlton Heston.
But saying that Gibson is sincere doesn't mean he isn't foolish or worse.
He can rightly claim that there's a strain of morbidity running through Christian iconography, one thinks that the Walchries and Roman churches and the Blonder Mavids Christ in Northern Renaissance in German art, culminating in such works as Matthias Ruhnwald's 1515 Inzheim Althropies with its thorn Christ in full torment on the cross.
But the central tradition of Italian Renaissance painting left Christ relatively unscathed, the artist emphasized not the physical suffering of the man, but the sacrificial nature of his death and the astonishing mystery of his transformation into Godhood, the resurrection of the triumph over carnality.
Gibson instructed Deschanel to make the movie look like the paintings of Caravaggio, but in Caravaggio's own, flagellation of Christ, the body of Jesus, is only slightly marked.
Even Goya, one of the Goyam, who hardly shrank from disembrament and pain in his work, created a crucifixion which kneeled with an early unblemished Jesus.
Crucifixion as the Romans used it was meant to make a spectacle out of degradation and suffering to humiliation to the victim through the apparatus of torture.
By embracing the Roman pageant so openly using all the emotional survey resources of cinema, Gibson has cancelled out the redemptive and transfiguring power of art.
And by casting James Cavazelle and actor without charisma here and then feasting on his physical destruction, he's turned Jesus back into a mere body.
The depictions in the Passion, one of the coolest movies in the history of the cinema, are akin to the bloody pop representation of Jesus found in, say, a roadside shrine in Mexico, where the addition of an Aztec sacrificial flourish make the Passion a little bit more passionate.
Such are the traps of literal mindedness. The great modernist artists are aware of danger of kitchen, the fascination of satomasochism, have largely withdrawn into austerity and odd abstraction or indifermanism as in Scrocese's last temptation of Christ, which features an existential Jesus sorely tried by the difficulty of the task before him.
There are many ways of putting Jesus at risk of making His feel as suffering.
What is most depressing about the Passion is the thought that people will take their children to see it. Jesus said, suffered little children to come unto me, not let the children watch me suffer.
How will parents deal with the pain, terror, and anger that children withoutless feel as they watch a man flayed and pierced until dead?
The despair of the movie is hard to shrug off and Gibson's timing couldn't be more unfortunate. Another dose of death-hotted religious fanaticism is the last thing we need.
Excellent.
Excuse me if I mispronounced many of the words in there, but what do I know?
Heathen.
Exactly.
Oh, no, I'm not talking about those so much as some of the artists, artists, and some of those people.
At any rate, excellent. It's called the Nailed by David N. B. in the New Yorker.
I think we will put it on.
Let's put it on.
I.
Tomorrow.
56670560.560 on the AT&T Verizon Wireless 9. Don't forget the QM van right now as I speak with the very bizarre Scott.
In fact, maybe we can put Scott on a cross. No, that's bad.
On Noom and Two, an out-of-two with the Shell gas station on the corner of 136th and Sunrise Boulevard. That's Panther Parkway.
You can stop by the registered Winnipear Firmal Tickets, not upcoming Panthers game.
Plus the first five people who showed up, they probably already been there. Don't you think?
I'm sure.
Who showed up to the van get a pair of tickets to see the camps game this Friday.
Be nice if we find out if five already showed up so that other people don't go rushing over there and then Scott will say,
oh, too late. Too late, I got him. I'm going to be there.
WQA and Hello. Not there.
Well, I guess maybe too much reading, huh? 56670560.
Pound 560 on the AT&T Verizon Wireless Line. WQA and Hello.
Hello, Nailed.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
I just want to get through so quickly.
It's just one comment on this Christ film.
At what point are they going to, is violence going to stop?
In other words, it's going to be up to somebody else to do a film on the Holocaust
and you can do a suffering of any people, in other words, and make it seem terrible.
It's a gynecophathy.
Right.
Don't you agree or no?
I don't think really the intention was to go.
I think number one, be on a shadow without he's a fanatic religion, it's number one.
And number two, all the publicity garnered because it was so violent.
If it wouldn't have had all the violence in it, I don't think it would have gotten even 20, maybe even 30% of the publicity that's gotten.
That's one that I was talking about.
He's talking and writing about it.
I absolutely agree, but I thought he was doing it to convey a message of sympathy,
as George said, I'll look at he suffered this much for your sins, you know, I'd be out of it.
I mean, if you could put a group, I grant you, he took 25 million dollars of his own money to make the movie,
but they're projecting that he's going to make at least 25 million profit.
If he were to say, well, I'm going to take that 25 million dollars in profit, I'm not going to take one dime of it for myself,
and I'm going to give it all to Catholic charities, or all to the starving and the poor in Africa, or whatever good cause, you know.
Then I'd say, well, at least he's doing something good with it, but he's just lining his own pocket.
Wow, are Catholic charities a good cause?
Like I said, like a really good cause.
Have a great day, Pali. I'll pray for you.

When you go to confession, you have the priest that where you used to sit and you sit on the gun.
You sit on the company.
And you open the slide open at little door, little sliding door, and he will confess all of his sins to you.
And of course meanwhile you will have a wiretap on you and the plays will be listening.
The Peterfile police.
What do you think?
Good plan.
Yeah, then there will appear you.
Sounds like a plan, that's right.
56670560, pound 560.
So the good religionist again and brought up as divisive an issue as they possibly could with the whole gay marriage thing.
And they want to hang it like an albatross around John Kerry's neck.
The only problem being of course is that he is consistently opposed to gay marriages.
He's in the favor of civil unions, which is the cop out the easy way out, like most of the Democratic candidates and the others.
Civil marriages.
So you're almost equal.
I mean, isn't this good enough for you?
No.
Almost equal.
Equalish.
Right.
So now that it would be like saying to black people, well we won't let you ride all the way up in the front of the bus.
But how about like in the middle of the bus?
I mean, it's a big improvement over Rosa Parks being way in a back of the bus.
I mean, she had to go all the sit in the front of the bus.
What do you want to be in the front of the bus anyway?
That's right.
Because if you have a crash, you're much more at risk than if you're like in the middle.
There's such as all those white people up there and they don't really like you anyway.
Right.
And of course if these people happen to be going to temple.
Oh.
Thank you right under the bus.
I'll talk in the middle with Jews.
But anyway, well, it's an idea for a bit.
56670560, 0560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
And you'll notice the usual software that they're whipped up into a frenzy man.
All their favorite radio shows are going to disappear.
The cable TV is going to vanish and it won't be too long if these Nazis get elected again before they'll find some way to control what you can do and see on the Internet.
But right, where there's no sense, there's no feeling.
Come in the QA and hello.
Yeah, I'm Neil.
Yes, sir.
It's Woody Graver. How you doing?
OK, Woody.
What do you have to see? Really? Is that mean you can't say my name anymore?
No, we can't say Woody. We can say W Graver.
They like you're in W a lot.
OK, W is good. Yeah. Listen, I missed you.
No, W is not good. W bad.
W very bad.
Get it right, Woody. I would get it right, W.
Anyway, look at this. I missed that. I'll list the Milano picture yet today.
Are you guys going to have like a gallery where people who missed photos can go back and other, you know,
check the photos that they missed?
Are those on air under features?
I don't know. I guess.
Why don't you go check it out and let us know Woody?
Why don't you look what he just said?
Mr. Graver.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Graver. He just said your name ago.
W.
I'm going to have to change my name, I guess.
I would change it to like Walter would be good.
Walter Graver. That's a nice, refined, Saudi name or dick.
I mean, see ya.
W.
Bye bye.
Oh, I got a little change of a topic.
I want to talk about Jason Williams for a minute.
You say whatever you want. I don't care. I mean, you don't need the job.
You only got the wife and two kids. What do you need the job for?
You got that nice place you can go to in North Carolina.
Sure.
Just hide away. You know, just slip away.
WQA, I'm Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Do you like it from the back?
WQA, I'm Hello.
Hello, I'm Scott McNeil.
Speaking.
Oh, Neil. I'd like to pose an important question.
If we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan at the freedom of security,
who's going to do the same for us?
Canada.
Canada, you're right.
Canada from the North, Mexico from the South, and maybe Guatemala might help out.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Why do I ever expect anything different?
You know, I'm going to hire Moron.
You're almost 30 years and I expect something different.
A little bit of outrage, a little bit of shock, a little bit of dismay.
And it makes no difference.
That's the problem, America. So you're so passive.
That's the problem.
They can just run roughshot over whatever you like, whatever you want, whatever you do.
You don't care.
It's like how would be all over again.
You know, just leave me alone with my pop-up poster and steal belted radios.
And that's all I ask.
You know, my little 17-inch TV.
God.
WQA, hello.
Hi, is this 560?
Yes, sir.
Hi, I was wondering if I could talk to Neil.
Speaking.
Hey, Neil.
Listen, I wanted to find out.
Is there any way, like, who we could talk to or write about?
Who here?
As far as, you know, the FCC, you know, then spending the money on all these stupid investigations
when they could probably be spending the money on prisons and trying to keep these people in jail
that are going around hurting kids and things like that.
Well, if you're part of the expression, it would be like farting in a wind storm.
Okay, I mean, if you want to expend the energy, you can certainly do it, but they're not going to pay any attention.
I mean, if they got 5 million letters and telegrams or emails, it still wouldn't make any difference.
Yeah, I mean, I listened to you all the time.
I listened to Howard's, sir.
And it's just ridiculous.
I mean, you guys don't say stuff that, you know, that's outrageous, I guess.
But I mean, it's just what's the-
Nobody, nobody ever got injured from anything that Howard Stern or Neil Rogers or Man Cow or anybody else ever said on a video.
You know, even little children know that the words don't hurt people.
So this whole childish episode that the dragon is through is an embarrassment.
The only way the public can put a stop to it is in November of the election if we have one.
Yeah, well, I plan on-
I definitely-
I will definitely be there at the polls in November and I hope my vote makes a difference.
I hope that they counted.
It's really-
Yeah, exactly.
It's really ridiculous for the way things are becoming these days.
You know, what happened to-
If you don't like what's being said, change the channel.
Exactly, that's right.
What happened to free-
What happened to choices?
What happened to people having choices to listen to what they wanted and read what they wanted?
And watch what they want on TV and not having big brother.
You know, that's the hypocrisy of all of this.
These are supposedly the conservatives who are against big brother and big government.
And then in the meantime, the worst in the history of this country,
which is why real conservatives like Pat Buchanan are up in arms and writing everything they can against them.
Yeah, I mean, it seems like people that, you know, the money where the money should be spent is like I was saying before.
There are more prisons and keep these scumbags that are out of ducking kids and killing people and hurting kids.
So use the money and-
All the pedophiles that they keep putting back on the streets, for example.
Exactly, like that poor little girl up in Sarasota.
Yeah.
You know, that should have never happened.
And I think that's what needs to be investigated.
Amen. I'm with you now.
All right. We have a good day now.
Vote early in often, please.
Thank you.
And the guy that the fact that the thing the other day, I guess,
it didn't all come out so we factored again about registering to vote.
And he's right on target.
If you're not registered to vote then what are you babbling about?
I mean, George would go register to vote, but of course he's in league lately.
And I mean, he's a-
I can vote anyway.
Yeah, I can vote the vote anyhow.
Just may just get some phony ID.
In fact, the-
Clarissoppy gets some phony ID.
They sent the-
The driver's license.
It was a box I could have checked.
There you go.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I mean, it's about time the American public started getting really pissed off.
Regardless of what you feel about game marriages, I don't think most people really all that fired up.
Is it like a big issue with most people?
No. No. Only the religious fundamentalists be great.
It helps them to express their hate.
That's what-
And again, keeping in mind that this was going to be the compassionate conservative.
And they were going to bring the country together instead of dividing us.
I can't imagine that any time in my life recalling when America was as divided as polarized as it is right now, W.
Divided right down the middle.
Between people who understand a pluralistic society,
we're not everybody believes the same thing or watches the same thing or reads the same thing or says the same things.
Or a bunch of fundamentalists want to dictate the all the rest of us.
We are sports radio 5c2, QAM.

Good morning everyone. Welcome to the Marriott Marquis.
This is a big day for the Walt Disney and Muppet family.
Let me introduce you to the members of the dance.
Over there on the far right is the CEO of the Walt Disney Corporation, Mika Nelt and Mouse.
I'm just going Mickey.
Sorry. He's assistant, Reenis.
I just like to make a big-
What up?
Representing the Muppet Corporation, Kermit DeFraud.
Good morning.
And his agent, Scott Boris.
Hello.
Sitting next to Scott Boris is the telemonster.
And now the man who will be speaking on behalf of the Muppets, please welcome Super Grover.
Mr. Robert. Mr. Robert. Mr. Robert.
I have a great statement to make and then I will open the floor to questions.
On behalf of the Hansen family and I'd be lovingly there, Jim Hansen may you rest in peace.
The Muppets have one thing to say.
Holy s**t.
We never thought in the beginning, usually we would be sold.
This is crap.
Thank you. I will not take your questions.
Mr. Robert. Super Grover.
What about the layoffs of the Muppets?
We have been assured by Mr. Mouse that the layoffs will be minimal.
And now Mr. Robert, I'll pull the f**k out of here.
I'll pay it what? I'm not committed to anything.
I'll take a look at the whole furry package and cut it up like a proper one.
I don't know what Mr. Robert.
Mr. Robert. Mr. Robert.
Mr. Robert. Mr. Robert.
Will Muppet characters be joining the Disney characters at the theme parks?
Uh...
Good morning.
We basically don't know what the hell is going on.
We sail kind of to the surprise surprise.
Right in place.
So I guess we'll deal with it as it happens.
Mr. Boris, what's going on?
Mr. Scott Boris. Can you tell us your role in the negotiations?
I basically put the whole thing together in my spare time.
I've been working with the A-Rod thing, but this has been my baby, my puppy.
I think it's a much-meeting evidence.
Mr. Mouse, what's wrong with you?
Mr. Mouse, how about the relationship between you and Mr. Frog?
I understand there's some tension between the two of you.
I'll tell you what.
Let's get this out of me open, because the worst thing for the media would be if we both just got along.
I know we haven't come in touch since we've been so far apart, but we came up together,
and we often talked about one day working together.
You got to hear me, Mr. Bear.
Oh, no!
You see, you have to start the set.
There was a reason with Biggie back in the day,
on a 12th permanent under the bridge.
All right, that's it. That's it.
Did you say, what happened to you?
Burm at once!
Burm at once!
You did that!
Pretty disappointing, huh?
Yeah, whatever.
You don't think?
Hello.
I was all excited there.
No, that was just at the end of the year.
You want to hear that again?
Just one second.
One second please.
TV920392309
Well, that's not it.
What do you can't hear it again?
Oh, well.
Anyway, it's a 27-1-560WDQAM.
We got 20.7% of this audience are going to go see a passionate Christ.
Whether we like it or not, I don't really care.
I mean, like I said, it's a free country as of now,
and so far they can't tell you which movies you can go to see
if you want to pay to go see them.
As of now.
Why can't we bring back that Catholic?
What do they call that during before WWII?
We're during that period of time when a Catholic council chees.
What do you mean before?
They're still doing it.
They are?
Sure.
Remember that hotline?
We called it on the show once, I think, over in the other place.
Yeah.
There was a Catholic movie review hotline.
I forget the name as well.
But you can call it and it will tell you exactly not only will they give you a review
based on quality, but whether or not it's edifying and whether or not the church thinks you should see it or not.
I see.
Because I did see priest, and you did see last temptation of Christ,
and I have a feeling that in either one of those movies was there anywhere near the grotesque of violence
that there's going to be in this movie that's coming out tomorrow.
A lot of people have already seen.
Not that I felt like they were pulling any punches during the last temptation.
There was the blood and the thorns and the scourging and the nailing and all that.
But there's also a new baptism scene.
I see.
Because guess what?
That's how they did it.
Oh.
Against the Jason Wiggins Mansion when limo's, and I watched some of the trial yesterday, it was really,
and I'm not really big on watching court trials unless, of course, it's OJ.
It's something really, really big that we all must must see TV.
That crap.
Pretty interesting.
The Jason Williams trial.
Because I'm starting to take a personal interest in the Jason Williams case myself.
Ever since you thought about that dog?
Yes.
The one I committed suicide.
It was that spot was that the Bush family dog committed suicide.
Stuck his nose right up the nozzle of the tailpipe.
That limo.
Against the Jason Williams Mansion when limo driver was killed by a shotgun blast fired by the retired NBA.
I started testified yesterday that Williams ordered those present to tell police that the shooting was a suicide.
See that you got a limo, you got a suicide, I'll fix it again.
Dean Ben Bumbaco, I watched him yesterday, he was pretty convincing most of the time.
Dean Bumbaco testified that Williams told him and others, he killed himself.
We all got to say he killed himself.
Following that, we all got to say he killed himself.
He killed himself.
As if he knew the statement was untrue, Bumbaco replied,
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Bumbaco told the jury that he went into the bedroom immediately on hearing the gunshots, saw the shotgun fall to the floor,
then watched the defendant fall to his knees and pound the floor.
My God, my life is over when you said according to Bumbaco.
As the wounded limo-zene driver Gus Costas Christofi gasped for air,
Williams picked up the gun and wiped it with a towel, put it down and then told another guest,
Kalluko, to wipe it again and he did Bumbaco said.
Williams then wiped it out a third time and went to the victim.
Mr. Williams tried to put the gun in his hand, I don't know if he got it in and tried to close his hand around the gun Bumbaco said.
Obviously to get the victim's fingerprints on it, so it looked like a suicide.
He soon saw Williams coming down the hallway naked and wet.
Williams handed his navy blue pinstract suit to another guest, John Gordnick.
John Nudnick.
J.G. get rid of these Williams said according to Bumbaco.
Kalluko and Gordnick have completed guilty to evidence tampering and Kalluko also pleaded guilty to witness tampering.
Bumbaco was never charged.
Bumbaco a landscaping contractor been to a Harlem Glob Prodder's game and dinner with Williams and others before going to the mansion.
Kristopiy had driven members of the group.
Bumbaco was the first witness to testify who was in the house at the time of the shooting bed night.
Previously the jury heard from trial witnesses since opening statements February 10th, but no one who was inside at the time of the shooting attestified yet.
The jury has seen dozens of pictures including images of Kristopiy lying dead on a rugged Williams master bedroom, as well as the wound in the driver's chest.
Prosecutors have also displayed the double barrel shotgun that Williams was handling, as well as four of the shotguns, two loaded and a loaded rifle that were in a gun cabin in the bedroom.
However, testimony on Thursday that Kristopiy apparently tried to protect himself as ruled impermissible and the jury was told to disregard it.
Forget about it.
That opinion came from Dr. Stephen M. Diamond Chief Medical Sameter for 100 in County who concluded that Kristopiy was in a defensive mode because the driver had blood spattered on the palm and fingers of his right hand and bought burns on the inside of his left arm.
Through their questions, the defenselers are suggesting that the investigation was shot, he had named it, implicating women from the beginning.
The defense maintains the shooting in the early hours of February 14th, 2002 was an accident and that the shooting was pro-demalfunction.
Is that kind of like a wardrobe malfunction?
Something like that.
Explosive.
Williams was accused of aggravated manslaughter in the shooting and also is trying to make it look like a suicide and persuading witnesses to say they were downstairs.
Now here's a person who faxed this to us and got all kinds of commentaries.
As I saw this guy interview with HBO's real sports, he was saying that this was the first time he'd been with Williams while Williams was back in his element hanging with his homies.
Williams was taking a lot of talking, a lot of crap saying, I'm the king of New Jersey, my money is longer than train smoke.
He also said that Williams embarrassed the limo driver to restaurant saying, what the f are you looking at, mother f'er?
What are you a f'ing f'ing?
The poor guy was just reminding him, just minding his business while sitting in another table watching what was going on.
The driver got up clearly embarrassed and headed toward the door before Williams told him to go back and sit down.
Later at the house, the guy heard Williams shout, yeah, mother f'er, just proud of the gun going off.
He's a scumbag and I hope they lock his ass up and I would say, thanks for faxing me.
There's also good article in the post on this, this one's better in the daily news.
Got it?
Got it.
Excellent.
Okay, we got about 700 votes or close to it on a poll so far.
What's your take on the much hyped Mel Gibson Passion of Christ movie?
704 votes like I said.
I will see it 149.21.1% are going to donate their cash to Mel Gibson.
Even the Pope would be proud of this marketing, 117.
Mel Gibson and his father are both Nazis, 112.
I wouldn't watch it if they paid me 103.
I might see it if I hear it's good 96 and especially if I can get a boot like copy free.
I definitely won't see it 91 and non-believers you just ignore it 36 out of 704.
21 till I won at 5.60 QAM.
I am your host, George 20 or 5.60.
QAM.
The most controversial movie of our time, Martin Scorsese's The Last Intention of Christ.
Recently became available for home viewing on cassette.
Religious groups, mythed at the release of the film The Effectively,
became outraged on the event of its home distribution.
And so, for your spiritual edification and for those who don't have these CRs of a Christ of the movie ticket,
we are proud to present live, part one, the radio version of Martin Scorsese's The Last Intention of Christ.
Oh, ah, ah, ah, but, but, want to buy half stereo?
Ah, ah, ah, gee, I better not.
Okay.
And so, the controversy continues.
Humans are modeled for Martin Scorsese's The Second Last Intention of Christ. Good day.
Okay.
Call 43-17-1 at 5.60.
Nobody to queue. I must get those phones smoking, baby.
Take a look at that phone right now, okay?
Nothing moves these back to the sufferers of free tickets.
You guys have some tickets, huh?
What do you got for free? What are you giving away today?
Traffic tickets.
Yeah, we'll give you some tickets, okay?
And make sure Randy Maltesh don't take care of the ticket defense team.
We'll give him a list of names.
I like that idea that I had about reversing the roles between the confessors and the priests.
Right.
Yeah.
And then we'll decide if we want to forgive them.
Yeah, all you peons out there, you go in and you put on some kind of a robe,
okay? Something makes you look real official.
And you sit with a priest who says maybe a back robe.
Oh, no, not when you sit with a priest.
Oh, not a good idea.
Especially you hung kids.
W-D-Q-A-M, hello.
Hey, how you doing, Neil?
Okay, sir.
I'm Matt as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore.
Good.
Yeah.
Here's one.
Here's one.
You know this commissioner, you read a little paragraph that she said about that.
She's outraged if the networks are out there just to lie in their pockets with this outrageous kitty.
Well, uh-huh.
Well, isn't that the point of their business,
if they're public with their publicly owned mega-national corporations?
Yeah, God forbid anybody should try to get ratings because they're going to put on something
that somebody would want to see.
Well, this is what I have a trouble understanding about all this.
How is it that these corporations which own these networks?
You didn't even understand, sir, the only corporations that are supposed to make money are N-R-On
and the Halliburton and Bechtel and the one in Lockheed and the ones who are on bed with the administration.
Those are the only ones.
Well, then I don't understand why GE and all these companies that own the networks would be, uh-oh, behind bush.
What do they think they're going to sell?
If cable is being after that.
So you don't understand, you're missing the whole point,
and that is that this deregulation business, they've got them over a barrel with that.
Because if they oppose the administration, if they put anything on the administration doesn't like that,
if that Reagan-Mini series, for example, then the administration isn't going to look so favorably on the exemption that they made when they passed the law,
they did it specifically for Viacom and for Ag.
I think it was, uh-uh-uh-ge-I'm not sure if I figured it would be the other company, was-
they passed it specifically for two companies.
So that instead of 37, they could have like 39% of the stations in an individual market.
There was specifically done for Viacom.
So there was, uh- definitely a quid pro quo in the world.
Absolutely, that's what it's all about.
And then we've got the other thing, is that we have the Secretary of Education,
thanks for enlightening me to that, Neil.
Yes.
And then we've got the Secretary of Education calling the largest union in the United States that has more teachers,
calling them a terrorist organization.
Absolutely correct.
I mean, when are we going to wake up here?
We're not.
I'm getting the passport. Thanks, Neil.
Okay, see if the-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Wow, and I forget about this one, this bozo. How is it that you people put Jeb Bush back in office again, okay?
He told me he was gonna lie to you.
The voters went to the polls. They voted on a class-sized amendment and he had his devious ways of getting around it, and he's still a talking crap.
No matter what you do to the public mandate, just rule over and play dead.
Anyway, education secretary Rob Page called the nation's largest teachers unionate terrorist organization
during that private White House meeting with the governors yesterday.
Democratic Republican governors confirmed pages remarks about the NEA. Those were the words,
the NEA is a terrorist organization to Democratic Governor Jim Doyle Wisconsin.
Democratic governor Ed Rendell a Pennsylvania city was making a joke probably not a very good one.
Of course, he immediately divorced the NEA from ordinary teachers who he said he supports.
I don't think the NEA's the terrorist organizations had Rendell who's put it heads with the group as well.
They're not a terrorist organization any more than the National Business Organization is a terrorist organization.
Neither the Education Department nor the NEA had an immediate comment on pages comments, both indicated this statements were forthcoming.
No child left behind my ass. Oops, sorry.
Behind my ass.
Keep getting carried away.
Here's the fact that just came in which I'm not even going to read ahead because since you sent it to me,
I must say something.
It says something.
In regard to Mel Gibson's movie, it says this is a Charles and Dear Field Beach.
Isn't it? I can barely read it.
I think the main point that all these religious nuts have completely glossed over is that if you do,
in fact, believe the story that God said has only been gotten sent to worth of a sole purpose of dying for our sins,
then obviously someone was going to have to kill that son.
Now, aren't they?
Jesus of course couldn't facilitate things himself by committing suicide because as we were all taught to do so is in itself a sin.
So there's certainly no drama in dying by accident or from natural causes.
Therefore, it's only logical that whoever killed Jesus was acting as God's tool and acting at God's will.
So I put it to you.
How can there possibly be any blame delay for something that was supposedly peridain by God?
I haven't.
Anyway, and of course when you say something was supposedly peridain,
according to the religionist, the Jesus Christ, there's everything is peridain by God because he's omniscient and he's omnipotent.
So when you're going to die from cancer, when you're going to fall off the edge of that cliff,
God knows ahead of time that that's going to happen, which makes it even sicker than it was in the first place.
The whole concept.
Anyway, Charles is enclosing as they confirmed agnostic.
All right.
I can't believe I've actually given this much thought to any of this nonsense.
I'll see you in a purgatory, Charlie.
We'll have a great time.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 and T line.
If only the people of South Florida will be as exercised about what's happening in America today as they were about alien,
then maybe we get a little response here.
You know what I'm saying?
Get the people foaming at the mouth about something that means something when they're like infringing on your rights,
like the First Amendment right.
And then one day when they wake up and all these shows are gone and all the things they like on cable are gone and MTV is gone
and all the books that they want to read are gone.
And keep in mind by the way that they were under the name of the combating terrorism.
Oh, we're going to go to library.
We're going to keep track of all the books that you take out.
Of course.
Right.
We're going to go to the Black Buster in Hollywood video and check out and find out all the videos that you've been writing and buying.
Right.
You might check out Lawrence of Arabia and God forbid.
That's okay.
The Saudis are okay.
They got problems out there running out of oil.
Inch-Monthes.
WQAM.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing?
I'm doing great.
That's good.
I don't know why President Bush didn't in accordance with what's happening in California with the gay marriages.
Because you know how many votes he could get, you know, if he would be, you know, if he...
60 on a 18T and for Rise the Marlest line.
Don't you love the ones that try to like program the show and get you to like be like a pirate and play the little thing?
BOT 3D MAN.
Why did it?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I'm just going to play all alien bits the rest of the week.
That's all I'm going to do.
Because that's important in South Florida.
And I don't want to say the certain segments of the community because it's all the community.
Your priorities are up your ass.
Okay.
Can I still say that?
No.
Your priorities are up your pie hole.
It's pathetic.
It's tragic.
And all of this started over like a little booby, a little, a little booby said,
a little booby, they're like, oh no!
Using that as an excuse now to appear again.
And if you people who listed this radio show, if you want a bunch of fundamentalist lunatics to decide what you can listen to on a radio,
or how you can spend your time, how can you live your life, then somewhere along the line we've lost the...
We've lost contact.
Like that guy used to say, you've lost contact with your audience.
You've lost touch as in touch this.
WNQAAM, hello.
Hello, how are you today, sir?
Okay, sir.
All right, I want to let you know that on Bill Riley's website, they mentioned you last night,
as being a bone of contention.
How are you like that?
What does that mean?
They were talking about radio DJs that are so far to the left and I thought that was just horrible.
What is the taste of that?
Well, don't waste your time on that.
Don't waste your time on Bill Riley anymore, sir.
And have a great day.
We could care less.
By the way, Bill Riley on his radio show in South Florida still got the big O-0.
Don't even show up.
Really putting the crimp into Russian, ain't it?
Squirt, Squirt.
Wow.
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon wireless line, that's right because we have to get all those leftist off the air.
We all have to go step in a line.
I thought it was Bill Riley, who was just a couple of weeks ago apologizing.
I love that guy.
He's a nice dude, huh?
Yeah, wouldn't he apologize?
He's all over the place.
He's just a whore only he doesn't admit.
At least I admit it.
WQA him, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you today?
Okay.
Oh, I'd like to speak to Neil, please.
How about your pardon?
Is this Neil?
See, when you said Neil and I said yes,
that would probably indicate that it was Neil.
See right off the bat.
When you said how are you doing, I said okay.
And then what happened there?
Oh, I'm sorry, Neil.
Listen.
Well, maybe I gave you the wrong answer.
Maybe I was supposed to say.
I'm as mad as hell.
I don't know what's going to take this anymore.
Oh,
Neil, I'm mad at the other.
I'm not going to take it anymore either.
Yeah.
I'm going to put the right wing asshole.
And we cannot let this guy push back in the office in November.
This is this country's going to turn into a police day.
It already is.
Well, of course, you're chocolate.
I mean, chocolate all you want.
It already is.
We're going to lose our right to free speech.
We're going to lose our right.
Our right to lock the street that jerked at that judge.
He went in right.
Right.
That's right.
He's a religious nut.
He went off the cross burner because he found that is correct.
Another recess appointment.
See, wait for the opening and he sticks in another one of these right wing lunatics.
And if they put him another four years, that's all you're going to have.
You know, I don't love John Kerry,
but he's got to be better than this guy that we got running this running the country
club up there in DC.
ABB man, anybody but Bush.
Hey, how's things in Toronto?
Everything is fantastic.
The sun is shining and life is a sweet.
I'll be up to visit you in a couple of weeks.
Let's go.
All right.
See you at the pickle bar.
Okay.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&C in Verizon Marles line.
Everything is beautiful.
Like I said, the sun is shining.
The birds are chirping.
The chickens are diseased.
Answer.
WQA.
I'm Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Forgive me if you talked about this already, but did you see the piece on 60 minutes
about the Patriots candle?
What's on the line?
About the Patriot.
Patriot missile.
Oh, the Patriot missile.
No, I didn't see that because I'd already seen it.
I talked about it.
It was on CBC months and months ago about the fact that the scudds that they
allegedly knocked down back in the first Gulf War in Israel.
Not one of them hit the target.
I'll admit.
Exactly.
And the funny thing is, I was living in Israel then during the first Gulf War.
Right.
And ironically, they told us the truth there.
We knew exactly that nothing was hitting the target.
Yeah, there was a single Patriot missile that's knocked down in those scuds,
not a single hit.
No.
And in fact, they knocked down several US players,
which was the road strategy.
But the piece went on to say that since then,
they have not done anything to improve the accuracy.
And they are still selling them by the thousands and thousands
to all kinds of third world countries.
Well, that's Raytheon.
That's another good buddy of our own.
Exactly.
Right.
And the first one.
That's what just pushes father lying to us.
We both think the sun is going to do.
Exactly.
Well, okay.
Good luck, you've got it.
I'll see you in Buffalo on a way over.
Let's see.
We had another, where the hell is it?
Oh, yeah.
Got all kinds of stories here.
It's only $3 billion rights, Matt Bivens, and the nation.
The Pentagon contracts with companies for work and pays them enormous sums of US taxpayer cash.
Then when those same companies don't pay their US taxes,
the Pentagon trucks and gives more taxpayer cash.
The GAO and investigative arm of Congress recently examined Pentagon and IRS records.
The conclusion as of September 2002,
many thousands of Pentagon contractors weren't paying their taxes to the collective
to an of $3 billion.
It's not Asian history.
Contractors who did Pentagon business last year in 2003
represent more than half of the three billion.
In order to the case of the contractors simply can't afford to pay,
the Pentagon in 2002 showed out $183 billion in contractor business.
The GAO estimates that last year the Pentagon could have easily collected $100 million
of what the government is owed from these Bermuda Patriots simply by withholding
back taxes from their contracts instead Don Rumsfeld's voice collected about $687,000
or far less than 1-100th of what they could have.
In fact, if we got serious about simply enforcing existing rules, GAO
estimates would be bringing in an estimated $100 million every year.
Taxpayers for Common Sense call it an honest agreement's free lunch on a dazzling scale,
provided, of course, we have the common sense to take advantage of it.
Unfreaking, believable.
Talk about Halliburton and the criminal charges.
Oh, Ellen, here's another beauty before we do the break.
Close relatives of President George W. Bush continued to benefit financially from the
Iraq invasion as revealed by sources including regulatory filings.
St. Louis-based engineered support systems, EASI, where William H. T. Bush and Uncle George W.
Bush joined the Board of Directors in 2000 is a major military contractor.
William H. T. Bush is a Bush pioneer, a contributor raising more than 100 grand in the 2000-2004
elections following the 2000 election in 9-11, the company's federal contract revenues
and stock price of increase. The company declined to comment for this article.
And it goes on about all the money they got in 2001 and $330 million in 2002 and $380 million
contracts in 2003 and Yadi Yadi.
They're just sticking their hand right in your-
Right there.
...the raping the crap out of you boy and the bottom line is the mull-mull-mull-a-ant life grace.
Why, in local, we're sports radio five-sixys, you a-u-a-m.
But it's, it's the one to two hour.
Absolutely.
Back in the day when someone done us wrong,
we didn't take their crap.
Imperial Harbor, or when the jabs dropped their bombs,
we bombed them bad and now the Saudis, they hit us hard.
And on our cards, our little flags wade.
As that Saudi-loving, retired voice of bombers, the wrong way.
Who moats the welfare of children?
And oven barrows to be in Americans, where they follow rules like sheath.
The United States of arrogance, led by Bush and his family,
breathing on this country.
Up, and the late Dorst of Argus' days, and I used to breathe.
I don't want to be a tax-american.
In the goddamn USA.
No.
What's a few thousand innocent lives stop living in the past?
If you want that SUV to drive, you're gonna need more gas.
It's the greatest country in the world.
They train us to believe.
And anyone who says that, obviously,
ends up for to leave.
And oven barrows to be in America,
where we take three odds and leave.
We have a flag in one hand, with our head in the sand.
And blindly follow the powers that he and the them take.
Up, Washington State, for news on a 65-inch screen.
Scratch your balls and pie, everything's okay.
In the goddamn USA.
Oh, bless America.
103 at 560, WQM, happy Tuesday to us,
of the New York article nailed by David Denby, that I read all that well.
It's on our website.
Out right.
So you can read the thing in its entirety, and also without my mispronunciation.
You can read it to yourself and mispronounce in your mind silently.
Paris Hilton directed sex video,
skanking nasty needle-nosed bitch.
Reality TV star Paris Hilton directed to help shoot the notorious sex video,
starring her and an ex-boyfriend, that has surfaced on at least two internet porn sites,
according to documents filed for LA court hearing.
The documents were filed by Seattle-based Marvad Corp, asking a federal judge to dismiss
a lawsuit by Hilton's ex-boyfriend, Rick Salomon, on the basis that Hilton,
known best known as the stir of the Fox Rail TV show, The Simple Life,
also held rights to the video.
Hilton's manager had no comment. Hilton's a 23-year-old social-ite bitch,
a member of the family that founded the Hilton Hotels chain.
Salomon 35 claims Marvad violated his copyright by distributing clips of the video on its website,
sexbrat.com.
That's sexbrat.com.
The lawsuit filed in November in US District Court in LA also accused Salomon's former roommate,
Don Trasher, of stealing, copying, and selling the video taped to Marvad without Salomon's permission.
Trasher said publicly that Salomon agreed to sell the tape and actually received
half of the 50 grand in proceeds. We'll take the rest. Thank you.
Who the hell would want to see her even with clothes on, you know?
Man, she is nasty.
So what was that website again?
I just, the Schmidt can.
Sexpervert.com or something?
Uh, Provo.com. Let's see, it's sexsexbrat.com.
We don't want to repeat it too often. Sexbrat.com.
Oh, I love this.
The Vatican issued a report yesterday by non-Catholic sex abuse experts who criticized the
policy adopted by US bishops of removing abusive priests in the ministry saying it was overly harsh
and would not protect the young. The report was released days before US bishops,
going to be on the 27th and three more days. The report was released days before US bishops
issued their own national survey on sex abuse back clergy, which suspected to find more than
4,000 American priests have been accused of molesting minor since 1950 far more than previously
estimated. I'm sure just a tip of the iceberg. Still the US study made what? You said tip of the
iceberg. Let us move on alone. Again, naturally. Still the US study may also show that
ever our cases are decluttered. You know, something with that might be the new format. We might
just follow this, stumbled into a pile of crap. Seriously? Yeah. Yeah. Just see how long we can
keep that baby going. Sure. He's starting. Still. Waters. Run deep into. If you say your rain is
that's it. That's it. I mean, we finally to probably was water on Mars. Not a good idea. I'm not
playing this game with you. I'll wait till you go. In fact, I'll wait till I go on vacation.
Then I'll do it on the plane. I'll just talk to myself. You're in trouble playing.
Good. I bet you will. WQA. I'm Hello. Why we in saw Haiti? WQA. I'm Hello.
WQA. I'm Hello. They're lost. They're lost. They just they just went off the deep end. I think
I think that new deal we got. I think that really threw them off. Five six seven oh five 60. It's
ripped up into a frenzy. They're foaming at the mouth about fascism in America and they're
a little bit crazy. It's ever I think this is a good excuse. Put them over the edge. Don't you?
Oh, yeah. WQA. I'm Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I heard you picked up
Jim Booth talking about talking about you. Yeah, give me a new phone pal. Get one of work. Okay. That
was incredible. Actually, you might have had something to say. I'm not really too sure, but get a new
phone when I really actually is got like battery's in it and works. That would be a good start.
Line nine is always very entertaining. Is nobody on it for the moment? WQA. I'm Hello.
Yeah, where's your audience? Up your ass. WQA. Hello. WQA. Hello.
Yes, that's the only please speaking. Mr. Rodgers, I'd like to ask what your opinion is on
WQA. Hello. Neil. That was Woody. Yes, it was. We better start voting for Frankenstein. I mean
Lurch. I mean John Kerry right away. Yeah. Okay. The way things they're going to start
censoring Sesame Street the way things are going. Are you suggesting that we've been left in the
lurch? Is that what you're saying? I think we've been left in the lurch. I think it's the other
thing. I'd prefer being in the lurchs than to being in church. I'll go in damn T. That's right now.
They're already censoring Sesame Street. Remember the story about the H.I.
Right. That's right. That's correct. Oh, of course. Absolutely. Right. You won't see that in the
Buenos Tardes. Oh, yeah. Not there. WQA. Hello.
Feel like Richard Dawson again. WQA. Hello. Do you paint a merchant?
WQA. Hello. Yeah, never mind people are being slaughtered. What's that website?
Death.com. Exactly. 5.670560. Pound 560. Nothing's going to dissuade these people. I didn't
saw Thor to me. Nobody's going to get them all depressed morbid. Nobody's going to warn them.
And you know what? The only thing we're going to get them whipped up to a frenzy of his
alien comes back and doesn't get his happy meal. I guarantee it. You can get your life on it.
That mirror species. WQM. Hello. WQM. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay. First of all,
I just hate everybody that you are doing screen lists. Yeah. So, yeah. Can I talk to Neil?
Anyway, they're getting right to their sound right away. They're not waiting. They're getting right to
it. Anyway, after the censorship laws and everything, how are we going to say the president's name?
So he can't be out. Yeah, you're right. We can say Carrie. We can say president furry patch of hair.
That is correct. All right. Yeah. Have a good day. You too. Have a good day. Wow. We certainly made
a turn this hour. What was it? Is it something that we, we, one of us said that we have had
a gyre said good lunches? Huh? Yeah. What did you have? No, I didn't have any. Maybe they did.
Oh, nobody brought nothing in today. Well, no, one. No, going out with Boca Bryant for lunch. Of course,
I'll be buying now. Oh, Boca Bryant. That keeps, you know, emailing me stuff that I can't play on
the air. Yeah. Not because it's over the line, but because technically 790 votes. What's your take on the
much hype Mel Gibson? Passion of the Christ movie. I'll tell you one thing. It's put this audience
right into their misery. I mean, out of their misery. I will see it 169.21.3%. Even the Pope will be proud
of this marketing. 125. Mel Gibson and his father are both Nazis. 123. I wouldn't watch it. It
wouldn't watch it if they paid me 118. I might see it if I hear it's good. 112. Oh, it's great. It's
sensational. Man, it's fun. I definitely won't see it. 102 and nonbelievers who just ignore it
only 41. So I think what they're really trying to say is we can't just ignore it. It's a little too
important to ignore. Watch me or something like that. Yeah, me too. Me too. We got bigger fish to fry.
I'm proud of it. It's after one is five 60. We got the mad dog at two. We got the Humper. The Hebrew
Hammer at four. Hank Goldberg, Hurricane War 1. Put seven. The Seton Hold Pirates and Miami
Hurricanes of basketball. Hurricanes at 730. You got any K-Fallon of basketball game Joe and Mark

117 let's see, Hail Mary, somebody just facts this. Oh this is a chronic fax here, okay?
But it's kind of cute, huh? Yes it is. It's cute. Hail Mary Fuller Gas, Tell Malgipson and the FCC
to stick it up there, ask, is that what it's said? Back home. It's a word in front of
us but we don't want to say. Maybe I should read it again. Okay, Hail Mary Fuller Gas, Tell
Malgipson and the FCC stick it up there, f***ing ass. There you go. There a little bit better
reading. 56705, 568, the calls are getting really good. This is our, I knew we'd get some really
great calls this show today. It's just sometimes they save it for the ass end. Don't say ass too many times.
I know. L.A. Times speaking of times says in health candidate tops USA. Oh no. Our
neighbors to the north live longer and pay less for care. The reasons which are being,
oh the reasons why are being debated. But some cite the gap between rich and poor in the USA.
It says, Judy Foreman writes in the L.A. Times yesterday, want to help tip up to Canada.
An impressive way of that is shows that Canadians live longer, healthier lives than we do.
What's more, they pay roughly half as much per capita as we do for the privilege.
How do you like that? I don't. Exactly why Canadians fare better is the subject of considerable
academic debate. Some policy experts say it's Canada's single-periodiversal health-covered system.
Something it's because our neighbors in the north use fewer illegal drugs and shoot each other
less often with guns. Though they smoke and drink with gusto, albeit somewhat less than Americans.
Still others think Canadians are healthier because their medical system is tilted more toward
primary care doctors and less towards specialists and some believe it's something more fundamental.
A smaller gap between rich and poor. According to a WHO report published in 2003,
life expectancy at birth in Canada is 79.8 years versus 77.3 in the US.
79.8 that's two and a half years longer. Japan's is even longer, 81.9.
That's on our website. For those who care.
5670560. O'Line 9 is back again, I'll bet. WQA, hello.
Hi Neil, hey. I'm listening to you from Indiana over the internet. I got to be quite good at a great show.
Yes, I do. Great.
Callers suck, but that's off Florida for a man. It's a good idea to stay in Indiana. Do not go to Florida.
You regret everything I'm telling you. It's not too much better.
You'll rot your brain. Now we're in Indiana. Are you?
I'm Northern Indiana. I'm not.
You're the Michigan border? Yeah. I used to live in how Indiana. You know where that is?
Oh, you poor guy.
Right across from Sturgis 1966 and 2007. Sturgis, Michigan WSTR. I was the program director.
Yeah. I know where Sturgis is. I'm so sorry.
Hey, what I was calling about is it came to mind. I think these conservatives are really missing the boat with this with the
gate. How would they get on it? I wish they'd have fun about getting out of town.
Well, you know, if they're so concerned about the safety of marriage, why aren't they proposing
a constitutional amendment to ban divorce? Right. What's up with that? I mean, I couldn't
What up with that? If two guys want to get married, that doesn't hurt me.
And for the president to come on here and say this is an important national issue at a time when our soldiers are dying over
there in Iraq, when we are going to have the elections by the time they're trying to turn tail and run there in July or June,
when all these grotesque things are going on, when we have all these people without health care,
and he's trying to say that this is an important issue. Who the hell is he kidding?
Most people don't give a flying crap about this except the bigoted right wing religion is that he's pandering to.
It's election year. You bet. It's election year. Yeah.
You know, let everyone get married to each other and let them smoke a joint at the reception.
Who cares? You know, something what's going to happen though is this I really believe this is going to blow up
in her face because when the public sees how really bigoted narrow minded and divisive that these people are,
they're not going to like it. Even the ones who don't support game areas are, you know, aren't that
interested in the issue? They ain't going to take a like and do it.
Oh, but there's no bigotry involved. Gary Bauer was on C.A.I.
I saw that. I saw before. I was put down with Puket and a board and I haven't even eaten yet.
It's just it's what everyone has been doing for 3000 years.
Right. And of course slavery was something they were doing a lot longer than 3000 years on the face of the earth.
So therefore it must have been a good idea. What kind of nonsense is this?
Change is bad. Yeah. All right. Well, hey, keep up the good show. I love it.
I'll see you in Windsor. Hey, how can I see in the border with the old ambassador bridge?
560560.
560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. You ever been to Northern Indiana?
No, but I heard Indiana once you don't go on. That's what our team shredded told there.
I like that song. Our Dean Taylor. But we got it somewhere. Don't live somewhere around.
If I come out and have it still played. I'm on heaven here. Let's do that.
One hit wonders again. Show it all. Come on. Let's let's threaten the audience with that.
What up with that?
Oh, there's nothing worth an old fart. It's trying to be cool. You know, oh, brother.
800 and twice. See, I want to have totally this long time ago.
I don't think about me. I was as cool as a, as an inferno and hell when I was born.
And I'm still I'm still about as cool as that as as a square as a cardboard box.
No, no, you're hit, Daddy. Yeah, like like the moment. I'm not square. I'm hit.
I'm the hit by. Absolutely. Get out of here, Mo. Go change your piece.
822 of votes on air. Pretty good, huh? We got them whipped up into a frenzy.
They probably they like the picture of Sophia Vergara and her ass on the beach.
We got a couple of ass pictures on there today. And they really like the picture.
I tell you her ass is like small potatoes compared to Michael Powell's enormous gigantic.
In fact, I would say I mean judging from that picture. I never, never seen Mr. Powell
any altogether before that he is all.
I asked 822 votes. What's your take on a much hyped Mel Gibson
past of the Christ movie? I'm going to go see it. I will see it. 176.21.4%.
They're going to go do it. They want to see some blood and guts.
Even a pope would be a proud of the marketing. 131. And he would. He's jealous as hell.
Mel Gibson and his father are both Nazis. 126. Maybe they can be part of the government.
I wouldn't watch it if they paid me 122. I might see it if I hear that it's good.
120. Yeah, I definitely won't see it. 107. And non-believers who just ignored 44.
Very they're heading to sound like the old proverbial ostrich.
Or asterike. By the way, never tell you the Austrians are much bigger Nazis in the Germans.
Yes, you just mentioned that in passing. Oh, despite a tight budget legislative
concerns about oh, this is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life talk about
as governor. Jim. Despite a tight budget legislative concerns about
alluming fiscal crisis, governor. Jim Bush again is pushing to eliminate attacks whose
average pay is a millionaire. It's attacks on the middle class. He said during the rule
out of his budget last month, I guess it's all relative. You know, middle class compared to him
and his family. Cutting that tax Cindy Hall of the AFL CIO would be in a front to decency
and fairness. Our workers can't afford stocks and bonds. He said during a recent news conference,
the intangibles taxes as known as levied on investment portfolios worth more than
a quarter million dollars for individuals and 500,000 for married couples. Anything held
within a retirement account is exempt such as cash and the savings are checking account,
which effectively limits the tax to the wealthiest 1.3% of Floridian. There you go.
It's in the Palm Beach Post today. So again, like I said before, how anybody could have voted
to put Jeb Bush back into again after he just stuck his foot deep inside your bottom. I don't get
it. I don't understand it. And of course, maybe nobody did vote for him. Maybe they just fixed
the numbers again. That's possible. That is possible. Does anybody really believe he'll ever get
the accurate count in Florida and lush in again? No! It's enough to make you die bold. WQM,
hello. A new. Yes, sir. Do you think Michael Powell will ever tackle the issue of a cell
they cruise videos? Yes. And he says, I talked to me at the stage that the most I've seen
thing I've ever seen. Man, if he does, then I'm voting for this administration again.
Do you ever see the two of them together, by the way? When you will, I, you will on our website,
believe me. Join it. Well, you've heard the expression. Join it to hip.
I think you'd say join it. The neck will go. I am Celia's losing. I am dead now. But that
Michael Powell together again in Sterea, right on theorages.com today. It's a beautiful thing.
Don't look at it right after lunch. Okay, we should have probably put a warning on there.
I did mention that that article from New Yorker is already on there because Eric is right on top
of these things and because we didn't have one of those building poles and all kinds of other
cock-a-wack from to do. Even though you didn't tax him the pole this morning. There, my
just the guy. You just want to keep on your toes. That's all there. Because the more time we have him
at the keyboard, the less time at the refrigerator, we're trying to do him a service.
WBQA, hello. Yeah, I am one of those guys that voted for Nader back four years ago. Three years
to get a thanks. But I think you're going to do that again, sir. Oh, no, that's what I'm calling
to tell you that I think this year the stakes are much higher. And I think with a lot of people are
not seeing is that this was also a vote for the Green Party and a vote for third party politics.
Whereas now I think that's a dead issue. Nader is kind of probably a little bit egotistical in this.
I don't believe Al Sharpton saying it's a Republican conspiracy, but I think both him and
how are you going to talk about that? Well, I think both him and Howard Dean have interjected a
lot of emotion into this race and Dean got a lot of the young kids out and I'm looking forward
to it. I think we have a good shot of getting that ass out of there. Excellent. Both 40, 50 times,
man, I'm telling you that I might actually count once you've twice. That's why I moved to Florida.
All right. Thanks. Thanks, Pally. I'm going to tell you right now that John Kerry will win Florida
or the Kerry Edwards ticket. Mark it down. Write it on your limperist. I'll mark it daily.
Write it on Josh's earlobe. Okay. If you can get that piercing out of there.

Oh, right. 131 at 560 WQM. Don't look now, but the QM van is right in front of your nose.
I mean, if you're at the corner of 136 and some rise.
Don't look now, but it's Scott.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Are you still alive?
What am I gonna say?
Yeah.
Anyway, I'm just trying to give him a little plug because I have no idea.
I'm like the olden days when we used to get like some kind of report about what's going on when they go out and these things.
We don't even find out.
I mean, granted, this isn't a fundraiser kind of a thing, but certainly not a fun razor.
That's for danger.
But until two o'clock, other half are the QM van is on the corner of 156 Panther Parkway and Sunrise.
Not too far from Stake and Quake.
Rumor I'm hearing is that Stake and Quake, they're kind of falling apart just like the burgers.
You know what I'm saying?
That is a shame, but what are you gonna do?
The shakes are great.
That's what Janet said.
She said you can't pick your shakes.
No, seriously, their shakes are the vastest Stake and Quake, but their burgers, the meat is all like falling apart and I don't know.
Not the same.
WQM, hello.
John Pot.
WQM, hello.
Hola.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Neil. How are you?
I'm doing good. How are you?
Good. I listen to you all the time, Neil. I just call to say I love your show and keep up the great work.
Okay. Thanks a lot and have a great day.
He likes to show a lot and I should keep up the great work. Keep it up.
We'll see you, Alice. WQM, hello.
Hey, can I talk to Neil?
Speaking.
Neil.
Yes, I am.
Listen, um, the question for you.
I'm listening.
Turn the radio off, pal. Please.
Okay, there's the question. That was good, right?
Wow, wow, wow.
My answer is absolutely.
Yeah, whatever the question was, the answer is absolutely.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
WQM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yes, the Neil.
Sounds like me. Yes.
Hey, I'm just calling to say I'm going to the movie tomorrow. I'm the Jew and I'll be wearing my Jew for crucification shirt.
Crucification. Wow.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
It's the Yosuke squad, man.
The Jesus Christ is the Yosuke people.
We got the Yosuke people in the movies.
We got George Bush and the anti-Fag of brigade.
It's for your own good, you know.
We got all these other things going on, man.
We got the war, the freedom of operation of Iraqi freedom.
How soon they forget operation emancipation by the competition.
It's just a wonderful thing.
We got the Diabold people fixing them, voting machines.
I mean, what's not to like?
Right?
What's not to like? Good, good watching on television?
WQM, hello.
Oh, low, low, $50.
Okay.
How about...
About 30, man.
Yeah.
WQM, hello.
Yeah.
I just want to let Neil know that this Sunday night on the Seats Band, George Soros is going to be on the day of the class.
Really?
Yes.
Maybe he can loan us all $50 million.
Okay. Because I know... Oh, Neil, how you doing? All right.
Pretty good.
Yes.
Because I didn't hear you talking about it, and I know you know you're...
Because I didn't know about it. He's going to be on Watch Show?
It's going to be on Book Notes on Seats Band 1.
Okay.
Eight o'clock this Sunday night.
That's it. Love it.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
George Soros is going to be donating millions and millions more to help get Bush out of there.
He said he's made that his life goal now.
Because he got more money than God.
And he's going to donate as much as necessary to get rid of the Bush moisture in these fascists who have stolen control of the US government.
It's an ugly, grotesque nasty thing.
But at least we're taking care of nudity that big flat at the Super Bowl.
What kind of an adult? Seriously.
Other than the real lunatic, fanatical religious friends, you know, that's 50-60%.
What kind of a person really and truly could even care about two seconds of a booby on TV, you know?
I mean, yeah, a lot of people wanted to see it because it got the hype of the century, even this movie ain't getting the hype like that thing God.
I mean, every 10 seconds there was on CNN and MSNBC and even Fox.
Oh, it was disgusting and everybody's talking.
But in the meantime, you'd see it again in the background.
And so they put a little bit of a blur over the booby bit.
But you saw it over and until it was like part of your brain, whatever's left of it, right?
Right.
It was like a brainwashing man.
They just stuck it right in there in the picture too.
The stamp that right on your brain.
But we're going to really start cleaning things up now and it's just like I keep telling you,
the lunatic fringe has taken over.
The inmates are running the asylum.
Make no question about it.
Okay.
WQA, I'm hello.
Yeah, I'm Prince Albert and I can't.
It's kind of like your QA, as a matter of fact.
WQA, I'm hello.
Hi, Dan. How are you?
Pretty good.
I have a question maybe that you could put on your full one day.
I was just wondering if you'd ever consider this.
I'm kind of a young guy.
I'm only 30 years old but I happen to watch games shows a lot of men.
Yeah, about that.
And I was always wondering if you'd like to put on your full the best game shows,
a game show host of all time.
Oh, we've done that.
Oh, Abby.
Well, I love your poll anyway, Neil.
Okay, man.
And I'm straight now.
I really did.
I'm handling with care.
Have a great day.
Thanks.
He likes my poll.
How do you like that?
A lot of people are big on the poll, right?
Yeah, right.
Five, six, seven, oh five, six, eight.
I don't know where the hell it is.
Your poll?
Yeah.
Where's your man of light glass?
I think I lost my, oh, here it is.
I wonder where it was.
I like Neil's poll.
Boy, it was a lot of work for that.
Thanks, the Hebrew hammer.
WQA, hello.
Hey, Neil.
I heard they're going to syndicate,
ain't sure they're going to make Hebrew national.
Yes, sir.
We did it.
And good.
Do it again.
WQA, hello.
WQM, oh, wow.
Hey, then when you got full whack in it.
WQM, hello.
Hi, Pauli.
Wow, wow, wow.
This hour is just the absolute present, isn't it?
So far.
Wow, wow, wow.
This must be all the fundamentals.
Must be, boom, boom, boom.
Falling into mouth.
It must be coming on glued day.
Which is good.
Every once in a while, it kind of let it out of their system.
WQA, hello.
This is Neil.
Yes, sir.
Neil, I have a question.
Yes.
It's things.
WQA, hello.
Oh, Neil.
Yes.
Hey, how are you?
Okay.
I'm going to change the subject to teeny bit because it's the bugging me since Sunday.
And you being an ex-UM announcer.
So did anybody call or listen to the now,
the UM game against Tennessee on Sunday?
No.
It was, I mean, you've got to get a tape of the two guys that did that.
It was the beast where they think it was Brian London.
I can't remember who was doing it with.
The Brian London is the beast.
I mean, the beast and some other guy.
And it was.
It wasn't clear.
It wasn't clearance.
Was it, was it clearance, Josh Dero?
May have been.
It was horrible.
Yeah.
It was absolutely the world.
It was a good test.
It was a good test.
It was absolutely very bad.
I'm a seasoned ticket holder.
I used to go to the game, but I couldn't go on Sunday.
So I absolutely listened.
And I figured it would be, you know, the gackiest bad as he is or the boosters, somebody like that.
But this was amateur hour at its best.
Oh, then it definitely was clearance and the beast.
Yeah.
Well, they probably do a lot of extra curricular things in between shots.
It's just a good chance.
Just as far as it goes.
Just listen to five seconds of it.
Okay.
Okay.
In fact, we'll put five seconds of it on the year tomorrow if we can find it.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, pal.
Sorry, we apologize.
Okay, we're very sorry about that.
Don't we want to apologize?
Yeah.
No, we don't.
Don't forget, look for the QM van right in front of your house.
I don't know why I keep reading that thing.
I don't know if you'd like hockey tickets.
Anybody care about the Panthers?
No.
Roberto Luongo, maybe the Hart and Profi winner, most right, we'll play in the league.
He's unbelievable.
Shut off the Bruins last night, 38 saves.
No.
Anybody care?
No.
Oh, sorry.
Talking of four languages you're going to apologize.
What's your take on the much hype Mel Gibson, passionate of the Christ movie, we're asking
today?
885.
I'll tell you what it's done to the audience.
They're absolutely loosened.
They're falling apart.
The scenes now.
They're just liberal, like that.
Or maybe when the movie comes out, they'll be saved.
I will see it.
192, 21.6%.
Even the Pope would be proud of this marketing.
145.
Mel Gibson and his father are both Nazis.
133.
I wouldn't watch it if they paid me 131.
I might see it if I hear it's good.
124.
It's fabulous.
I definitely won't see it.
131.
And non-believers who just ignore it.
47.
5 and the local.
This is five cities.
The radio's all yours.
Q and.
Were you drudge packing?
I get out of the car, Miss Rose.
I was driving by my own business.
Yeah, you driving up the wrong way.
I got a bite by my own business.
You can kill somebody.
I think we're right up there.
Woo!
What have you been drinking?
I was driving through Arizona.
With a scoop full of booze.
Talking on itself, older.
And wearing designer shoes.
When the cops pulled the rover.
The driver recklessly.
She said, don't you know why?
I don't know why I am.
I miss Rose with a beat.
I miss Rose with a day.
Diana Rose got a load of it.
And now she's going to jail.
And she's down there exploring.
And when the cop broken down.
She's dropped by death.
I'm driving the wrong way.
You're radically.
You're right up in the old.

But they asked her to blow it.

She was chewing stuff instead.
And now Miss Rose is going to get her.
In a night by night.
I miss Rose with a day.
I have a Rose got a load of it.
Now she's going to jail.
And she's down there exploring.
Oh, yeah!
When a cop broke her name.
You broke my deal, you...
You driving the wrong way radically.
You went up in the old building.
Listen into her old too.
I'm a color baby, old.
1-47 at 5.60.
I thought maybe if it did, I would cover it up.
Anyway, here's the entire story.
Before I get to that thing about the sports illustrator.
That's been on CNN all day.
They've had that kid on there with that magazine.
Yeah, but first here's the from the Tampa Tribune a little bit more on a DJ
Bubba loves fun fired by Clear Channel. Bubba loves fun's Clam whose graphic and
explicit radio program prompted the largest proposed single find against the
broadcaster in history was fired yesterday according to a statement from his boss.
Van De La Retta. Van De La Retta. Oh my God. Is that incredible? Who died? A radio
schmuck. Van De La Retta he used to be in in Miami. He used to be a GBS I believe.
Van De La Retta was vice president general manager WSTB 97.9 FM owned by
Clear Channel Communications. What did I just say? Clear Channel.
Issued a statement on the OGM newscast at sister station WFL 870 AMA.
De La Retta. Oh my God. What a puss. He said Crems contract had been terminated
with the Tampa station several other Florida radio stations and other program
Bubba loves bunch. De La Retta did not elaborate neither Clam who show air
at mornings on WSTB nor any other chief channel executives could be reached for
comment. In January the FCC proposed finding San Antonio based chief channel
755 thousand dollars from material aired on Clam show that the agency deemed
indecent. The total also included the fine regarding the station's record keeping.
Clam show was popular. It was number one radio program in the Bay Area from
6 to 10 AM with people ages 18 to 34 according to the most recent arbitraron
rating show. We won't hear it no more. Tem has been fined repeatedly for similar
fences including a 2000 to incident in which chief channel agreed to play 30 grand
for material broadcast in 1997. This article doesn't even mention the flap
about killing the pig on the air. The Pita thing. You know. So here you go. Bubba loves
bunch. He's out now. Now he's out now. Get into this crap. Bell Preohio. I mean
this is ever stopped. No. It's like a gigantic snowball that's gone out of control.
No. A middle school suspended a sixth rate of for three days after we refused to serve
a lesser punishment for bringing a sports illustrated swimsuit issue to school.
The superintendent said today. Justin Reyes had the magazine in the school's
gymnasium before class to began February 15. Bell Preoh school superintendent Tim Suarez said
he swore to it. Principal Kathy Garrison punished Justin for violating the school's
policies on nonverbal harassment and position of ludicrous and just material swans.
This is the sports illustrated swimsuit issue ludicrous and just of material.
Garrison ordered Justin to spend two days in an alternative school about 12 miles from Bell Preoh
Middle School where students from several districts take classes when they get into trouble.
Suarez said Justin's penalty was increased to three days about a school suspension
after he and his mother Nicole refused to accept alternative school punishment. He started serving
the suspension today. Last time I checked we were in charge of running the schools he said.
Nicole Reyes said the alternative school was to our gym punishment. It wasn't like hustler
playboy or pen out she said the punishment doesn't fit the crime. Although we had not seen the swimsuit
edition. Oh this is the best. Although we hadn't seen the swimsuit edition before this incident Suarez
said he's looked at it since. I was shocked he said it doesn't belong in public schools before
of the Bell Preoh Middle School about 90 miles southeast of Columbus serves about 550 students in grades 4 through 8.
Wow is this scary or what? The sports illustrated swimsuit is here.
But finish ash hole this swore I swore that I would never read stuff like this again.
He looked at it he was shocked it's indesneedless disgusting as America continues taking these
gigantic humongous steps into the stone age. Wow. So while you people are got the SI laying around
you better not let your little kids you know the 15 16 17 13 year old kids see it. God already
knows what they might do. Oh no not that don't even think about that no more. So no matter I want you
to understand this okay up until the last couple days till all these a memo started coming out
and broadcasting and all these other facilities around the U.S.A.
Whatever you enjoyed watching reading thinking about before no cut it out
when it's out cut it out stop it right now put it away stop no
I'm not at out too late put it away 151 at 5.60
You know whether to laugh or cry it's a juvenile it's so pathetic better laugh and like I said all
