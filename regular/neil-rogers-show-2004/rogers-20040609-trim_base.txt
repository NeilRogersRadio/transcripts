I'm way too shy, shy, shy!
My nose glows when something stays
Almost every day I paint
And my veins suddenly start to tingle
My eyes annoy me with torture, torture me
Yeah, I love life to fall apart
And because I'm a criminal fine
There's no death spill with wiggle veins
Yeah, I love life to fall apart
And say it's an old discovery
I know I'm bleeding, wiggle veins
I'm out of sleep!
Sit down!
Sit on three at five, sixty WQM happy Wednesday to you
It's a great day
For hope I don't know for the Irish
The Jews, the Goyom, the Buddhists
Man allegedly assaults Taco Bell employee with Chalupa
Oh my God
I've actually never heard this story before
De Moin Iowa
A man who claimed he didn't get the Taco we paid for
Has been charged with a saw for allegedly
Pelting a Taco Bell clerk in the face
With a Chalupa
Nancy Harrison told police he was working the drive-through
Last Thursday night when Christopher on his name might be La May
But LA and me could be lame
And I think it fits here
Christopher lame, 24 ordered some food
Although at least he ordered the food
Unlike what's his name from a Baywatch
David Hasselhoff was sitting in the McDonald's drive-through
Saying nothing because he was drunk
But anyway
He later came into the store complaining he didn't get the Taco we ordered
Police records say
Harrison said that when she asked for a receipt
He went back to his car and brought back the bag
Harrison said he told him the store was closing
And as she turned away
A Chalupa hit her in the face near her right eye
She said she
She said she ran into the parking lot
Took down the license number
Where the motorist was driving away
Lane was identified through a license number
A schedule appeared in court June 15
Don't do it again, Lane, man
Don't be attacking that poor bitch with a Chalupa
Although who would like to attack Scrooan with their Chalupa, you know?
Roy!
Wouldn't that be great?
Just line her up against the wall there
Or a sailor right up to the wall, huh?
Or your Jimmy Chango would be good too if she liked that
Here's our poll result from yesterday
We had a staggering response almost 1700 votes
Who is the most overrated movie actor or actress of all time?
And for once I got the answer right I guess
Because I picked the Duke, John Wayne, Marion to you
John Wayne, 205 votes
I mean a legend in his own mind in the minds of every redneck from coast to coast
The Duke, you can't pick on the Duke
Next to be picking on Reagan again today
Oh yeah, I sure will, I got some more great stories
Yeah, oh I got a whole bunch of them
In fact my favorite one, what's it called again?
Let's see
Colin Shrey writes he was a madman, meaning Reagan
But anyway, John Wayne, 205
Cano Reeves gave the Duke a run for his money?
160 for Kiano, cheated pretty well
Kevin Costner, 141, bland is vanilla ice cream
Man, just boring, terminal, ponderous, coma inducing
Almost as coma inducing is the big deal
And Joseph Gatti
Jennifer Lopez was only one behind
JLo had a nice number there, 140 came in fourth place
Beating out James Deanhandley had 123
Julia Roberts 90
Will Smith 83, that makes my heart feel great, Vin Diesel 78
Ben Affleck 78
Arnold Schwarzenegger 71, Marilyn Monroe 63
Elvis 61, isn't it great that those two were right there paired together
Chuck Teston 46, Mel Gibson 37
Did I say Chuck Teston? I don't have time to do that whole thing
You son of a bitch
46, Mel Gibson 37, they nailed him
Richard Geerhead
About third man
Jerbels, John Kervolda 24, Brad Pitt 21, Tom Hanks 19, Marlon Brando 19
Burr Reynolds 17, Charlie Chaplin 15
See, I don't remember who I wanted
Won't waste my time
Huh? How about Buster Keaton?
Yeah, how about Buster Keaton?
It's a time thing, it's not a time thing
He was back started in the silent movies, okay?
In their time they were great but nevertheless Al Pacino 13
Which we all love Al Pacino with Sephir when he said
Too much!
Then we turned on him like a rat
Rock Hudson had a dozen
Don't tell Ronnie Rock is sick
Frank Sinatra Harrison Ford Michael Douglas Andy Garcia each had 11
Bobby De Niro had 10, see you with little faith out there
Where it was George's vote for a long time it was the only vote
But then some people started thinking about it
And I said you know he has made a lot of crap lately
And they piled right on
Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep 10 apiece
Paul Walker 9, whoever said he was an actor by the way
I don't get that
Whoever said he was a good actor
Val Kilmer 9, Rock Hal Welch 9
Little Hayden Christianson 8, whoever said he was an actor
When he came right down to it
Denzel Washington 8, Natalie Portman 7, Humphrey Bogart had 6
Sir Lawrence Olivier 5, Gene Hackman 4
That's downright disrespectful if you ask me
He's no Jay Feeder
Dan Acquired 3, Dennis Hopper 2, Michael Cain 2
You and McGregor 1 and Vanessa Redgrave had only 1
I'll just about 17 revoked on yesterday's wildly popular poll

Dan Radher and Tom Broca
Worked for different networks as the New York Post today
But they agree on one thing
Coverage of Ronald Reagan's death has been excessively said
Absolutely correct
And you're gonna know already when the hell does it stop?
By the Senator John Kerry, the presumptive presidential nominee of this party
He paid his respects before Mr. Reagan's captive
See, there you go, you can't you just can't turn on any of the talking headroom
Even the regular networks interrupting us soap operas
And other very important programming day of the day
For more it is Reagan crap
Which is why I'm counterbalancing with the plenty of other kind of Reagan crap
The truth
Even though everybody is respectful and wants to pay homage to the president
Like does Goan Radher told the Philadelphia inquiry
That's what Danny Boy said
There is other news like the reality of Iraq said
The CBS evening news anchor it gets it got very short shrift this weekend
Networks have been going almost wall to wall with Reagan
Coverage since he croaked on Saturday at the age of 93
The former president was diagnosed with Alzheimer's nearly 10 years ago
And if you don't know that by now you probably have it yourself
Once the herd starts moving in one direction
It's very hard to turn it even slightly rather said
Nationally the herd has grown tremendously
Haven't you heard?
Volkow said I think just about everything is over nowadays days
Vokow who airs the anchors the emaci I only knows
The spectrum is so crowded with all the cable networks
It begins to have a video while feeling too what he said
News anchor with a bad bad speech defect unintelligible
Peter Jennings said he had mixed feelings about the Reagan coverage
Being the Nambi Pambi Canadian that he is
I'm more inclined to spare coverage come on the air to spare coverage
Come on the air do something meaningful and get away he said
Yeah get away Peter
Last time I had to do it was with OJ Simpson during the 94 car chase
I had nothing to say after a certain period of time
Coverage or Reagan's death will continue through Friday's funeral on all the news networks
Broadcast cable on your pop-up toaster
You'll have Reagan now they want to name the Pentagon after Reagan
They want to redo one of the bills first they want to do the dime and then she said that's a bad idea
FDR be pissed and now they want to do one of the dollar bills like a ten or a 20 or something like that
Three huh a three dollar bill would be good that would be poetic justice I think
And it's just there ain't no stopping it and that car yesterday had an excellent point
Why don't we have the Ronald Reagan turnpike in Florida
It absolutely no relationships of Florida whatsoever none zero zippity doodong quite frankly
Lot of the Latinos who moved into Florida over the years probably hated Mike boys and anyway and rightfully so
Especially if they're from like Nicaragua for example
Or Grenada places like that how many people from Grenada you think we got in South Florida
About 30 man at least
Here's our poll question today put on your thinking cap
I've actually get a lot of choices on here
Here's another one of those poll building deals
Oh poll building's boring poll building's boring
What retail place in South Florida do you hate the most?
Now I didn't put a choice on there none because I don't think there's anybody who doesn't
This spot huh?
No you'd have to be beyond human to not despise some retail place where they just treat you like crap
Or you just don't like the whole ambiance or their attitude or whatever
What retail place in South Florida you hate the most and I started out with three
Echards even though Jack Eckerd cropped I think I was on vacation when Jack Eckerd died
You covered that extensively no he was 91 which if you asked me that's old enough
Jack Eckerd boy did we hate him a real right wing always running for office
Another one of those like there's certain people in Florida over the years always running for office
Perpetual candidates Ellis Rubin Bob Coonst Jack Eckerd always running never winning
Just always on a ballot professional candidates kind of like Howard Samuels in New York State
Walmart who I know who's going to be voting for that who me yeah yeah a
Windixie Eckerd's Walmart Windixie does the first beat it came to mind I hate to say this because I'm sure that Windixie is a wonderful sponsor
And spends much money on our radio station but nevertheless I hate them like poison no I don't really hate them
I just would never shop there right so I don't think I would vote I hate them
I just wouldn't shop there unless maybe there was the only store open within about an 80 mile radius
You know what I'm saying right right there were a little worried about that meat
From minutes actually I like to yeah I know the bee people before I purchase it I like to be able to see my meat
You know what I'm saying I don't want to like have it wrapped in a tube that you can't see through
And then bring your home and find out that you've got the green weenie in there you should smell it too
Oh that's always a good idea
From minutes past 10 if I that's what my mom told me this morning always sniff it to make sure it's fresh
From minutes after the hour and this is a make good spot for those people who are keeping track and I want to thank whoever notified us

There's probably a lot of people that want to see M&M's right though might frankly I'll pass on that El Paso
The Martin short show that Dennis Miller live playing herself in episode
1994 now that's interesting because Dennis Miller show is got a 0.2 share
He's right there scratching around on the bottom of the numbers
Dennis Miller show it's as close to being off the air as you possibly can be
It's almost it's like a half a step away from being on the light bulb or the old whammy one or the other and we can relate to that
Here's another one for the pool circuit city. It isn't spelled out that way exactly right there, but I get there drift
Oh, don't leave the beaded curtain yet. Why not?
Because that picture that I sent you is already there behind it. That mosaic that Jack mosaic that what do you call it the collage?
Well, what am I gonna do with it?
Beautiful portrait of Ashcroft you look on the beaded curtain and there it is and then the listeners we want to oh yeah
Because you actually can make out what that is that's great. That's perfect. Oh nice going and then if you save it then you can
zoom and
Appreciate all of the individual little pictures that come
Already seen that when you had me take a peek out of the first time but you couldn't zoom back on mine here
But now that you got it like all together collage that it's a bunch of naked women little tiny pictures of naked women and the collage makes out John Ashcroft's face
That is
It's not just naked women. Well, I didn't have time to cruise you
I'm sure you did I'm sure you did whatever else they're doing I don't want to go into detail right here
Okay, it's behind the beaded curtain you got to be over 75 you won't be seeing this any place else on her website
Okay, I think there's a couple billy goat pictures in there too. Well, I don't want to hear about that
Okay, you're just horse and around. Oh there it is right on his necktie. Oh, look at the signs of that thing anyway
So there you go you got behind the beaded curtain you got three for the price of one because we still got that
Whatever the hell she is the your love child honor
Circuit schmitty we got that that we got it. See I voted for records
I'm gonna tell you why when you come to thinking about what you're gonna vote for on this poll I don't want
Stop and think about a place that you wouldn't go even if they paid you to go in there now Walmart I see I'm not gonna vote for that
Even though I despise the organization
But now that there's no more came art out by me if I need something that I can only find in one of those kind of stories
I'll go to Walmart. I will bite my tongue when I do it and bleed a lot but I'll go there
But records well since I got a Walgreens right up to street and there's one on every street corner right now one of the other
I just won't go to records even if they pay if they give me free merchandise if they give me free drugs
I would not go in there on the opposite and it has nothing with what in other words you would go to
I'll go to records if I must but you won't go to a market or a market or a total of death
Really right well I know you feel a little bit strongly a little bit yeah well that's okay
That's why we're putting these on there so we got so far Walmart for
Windexy to records one and circuit city one we'll add a whole bunch more on there places that you hate like poison that you wouldn't
Shop if they paid you if they paid you to go in there
We have one call on it Q. I. M. Hello. Hey. Yeah, sir. I got one for your poll. Yeah rooms to go
Okay worst place I put about the furniture there came in damage I
Recited you know I bought it with the protection plan. Yeah, I selected some other furniture
Guess what I didn't want the protection plan for the other furniture I selected they told me I had to get it because I got it last time
So I had it really I raised hell and my wife eventually I said listen you know what you sign the check because I'm not going to give it to you
But anyway, I think the motto is just say no to rooms to go you got it. Thanks. Thank you for taking my call you bet okay
Rooms to go let's get that on there. This guy just says no to rooms to go I like the way sound of that
Tampa Tribute apologize we should have talked about this yesterday
But nobody cares about it anyway, but I just mentioned it
They apologize to the readers in the Tampa Bay Lightning yesterday and for mistakenly writing an editorial saying the hockey team had lost
The Stanley Cup finals. Oh my god. What about your bozos but then again they're in Tampa what do you expect?
Publisher Gill Teelin said it was unclear how the mistake was made Monday night is the newspaper rushed depressed following the lightnings 2 to 1 victory of the Calgary Flames in games 7 the tribune
Prepare two editorials one for a win and one for a loss
But despite placing the correct editor on its computerized
Page making system the one prepared for a loss appeared somehow in the newspapers
275,000 copies and they apologize they said we took a puck in the guts and yada yada yada
And the correct editorial which did not get in the paper a lot of the team and credit the team for generating private 7 in the community
And this happened in the our post last October when the early editions of the paper carried that editorial be moaning the Yankees lost to the red socks and the American league playoffs
But then the Yankees it staged late rally to tie game 7-1 at next trainings and they again the post had egg on their
POSPER well deserved it's a root per Murdoch piece of crap. So there you go just a little mistake there. Oh we lost and we feel so bad. Oh no you won. Well like I said we lost
This is kind of a disturbing story. Remember party at the same time and Judy comes back wearing Johnny's ring and so sings girl cry if I want to
I'll cry if I want to you would cry too if it happened to you. Well tears were not how one 13 year old Baltimore girl handles such a betrayal at a recent birthday party
According to the associated press when the birthday girls boyfriend kissed a 12 year old guest on the cheek at the party
The birthday girls mother was furious and ordered her daughter to handle your business at which point the unfortunate guest Nicole Ashley Towns was savagely beaten by six women and girls including the mother and sent into a coma
It's tough imagining a Leslie Gortoon coming out of that story maybe a J Frank Wilson one but not less the Gore
But it does seem to fit with the girls gone wild phenomenon spreading across American culture according to AP around the country school police and teachers are seeing a growing tendency for girls
Deciddle disputes with their fists. I think it's Muhammad Ali's daughter's fault. What's her name? I don't know whatever it is. It is still true that violence among boys is a much bigger problem than violence among girls is measured by
Rest statistics but AP reports while it used to be the ratio was 10 to 1 now it's only 4 to 1 and while the surge of violence among girls has been seen primarily at the lower end of the social
economic scale is by no means exclusive there just flashback the news about the violent powder prop girls football game in an affluent Chicago
A suburb or one girl a group of girls brutalize another group of girls howled helplessly on the ground even to the point of breaking bones
A rat! My!
And look, this is 4 to 1.560
Way from way down
She don't win
Or if she played in the sledge
She plays slow
And both she does this scratch
And both she's so hot
And so in the hot up
Well I get this from her
Absolutely
Now I get this
Takes from her
Ow!
A man looks or not for the sky
Licks the mole under my right eye
She's a stinky family player
But I get this from her
Alright
I get lost
All sex from her
For some reason we don't believe you but that's okay 1032 to 560 WDQAM
I wasn't in town yesterday I couldn't hear the show but by listening to your poll results I was shocked to hear
Shock
That Sylvester Stallone was nowhere to be found
Recount
Now see the reason he was in honors because nobody in the right mind ever said he was an actor
Right even as crazy ma
Even soon she knows better
She'll take the cash but she knows better
Suggesting for today's poll from the same chronic
Macchrist giant horrible experience with him in the past macchrist giant got in court
Well like I said good
Here's one that says bird eyes macy's it's been crappy since the merger
I didn't even know there wasn't merger that's how to touch I am an addition to which I went into shop and eat the place anyway
Hate bird eyes
Right overpriced
Yeah overpriced and go to the get the same merchandise in a lot of other million other places
Plus I don't like their attitude
I remember back the first time to the casino gambling thing was on a ballot they were one of the prime fighter
The because they you know huh where they now yeah because they wanted to continue paying their help
A minimum wage or close to it and they didn't want the idea of casinos coming in and changing the whole economic base of the community
So as a result anyway I hate bird eyes like poison and they're overpriced
So we can put bird eyes or bird eyes macy's however you want to put it on there it's fine with me I'm easy
Gallop has carry ahead
A new Gallop pool finds senator John Kerry enjoying a slight lead over bush while bushes approval ratings remain relatively unchanged
But for the most part in negative territory all right the president's continuing strength is in the public's perception
It's a perception of how well he's fighting the war on terrorism while his performance ratings in other areas the economy
Forman affairs the situation in Iraq energy policy prescription drugs for older Americans all listed higher disapproval and approval
In the pool itself Kerry leads bush 50 to 44% among likely voters six points
So what does it say here enjoying a slight lead six points into shabby the way things were in a three-man race Kerry leads bush 49 to 43
Would they to get in five percent but it still sounds like six points to me if my math be correct
Okay
Okay, I like that. I still carry just by sitting back and being like a Herman monster and not saying too much he's again and by you know
By default yeah right speaking of default yes, what's this word you wrote on the on the pole sheet that you faxed me painful deification
Oh, yeah, I'm glad you're minding me about that but see now you just by reading it it took the
Oh, sorry, it's funny. Yeah, because we're gonna have think I was gonna have a segment
We're gonna do about the oldest tributes to Reagan and Duff was Duff was gonna read the piece
It was gonna be titled painful deification. Yeah, this is all this what's happening with Ray it is
Waitful it is and and the course Duff being the expert back home in that area we thought he would mouth the
Story about painful deification at any rate
Court upholds Bible class ban
Yeah, I'm glad you're reminded me of that because I do write these things down and my Alzheimer's gets in
That's why I write them down in the first place, but I forget I wrote them down a
Federal appeals court is upheld a ruling that argued weekly Bible classes are unconstitutional in the public schools of Rhea County
That's Chattanooga the same County where the Scopes Monkey trial pitted the creationist against the evolution is 79 years ago
The Scopes Monkey trial a
Three-judged panel of the 60 West Church Court of Appeals and Cincinnati agreed Monday with a February 2002 ruling by US District Judge
R. Allen Edgar of Chattanooga
You ain't seen nothing till you seen Tennessee, mister. I'll tell you that right now Tennessee
Edgar ruled that the Bible education ministry program in Rhea County violated the first amendment clause calling for separation of church and state
The 30-minute classes
Third man or held weekly for about 800 students in kindergarten through fifth grade at the country three elementary schools
These are pubic schools no less ready ready for that parental consent was not required in students for a lot of
Participating alternative activities that they objected the classes Rhea County
Superintendent Sue Carter said Monday that school board members would likely discuss whether or appeal the latest ruling at their
Third denied meeting tomorrow Bible classes have been offered in Rhea County for 51 years and of course slavery probably till about five minutes ago
I'm disappointed not surprised though
The appeals judges ruled that all those school officials contended that the classes were valued driven teaching responsibility and
Positive morals they were also teaching the Bible as religious truth
Which of course only Neanderthals only morons would believe that religious truth this gobbledy
Gook written by primitive stupid people thousands of years ago passed on word of mouth on
Scratched on rest of them walls things like that right near the glory holes
The what that's what we have yeah, oh glory glory to the Lord
This county city of Dayton about 35 miles northwest of Chant Nougat's where orator and presidential candidate William Jennings
Brian and attorney Clarence Darrow squared off an agreement during that 1925 prosecution of teacher John T. Scopes for teaching evolution
Oh my god in the public schools instead of the biblical story the bubble my season of creation from the Bible
That is the jubilee Bible and not to be confused with the Muslim Bible or the
Anybody else's Bible the Hindus the
Christian scientists
all of these people the
Scientologist El Ron how about they to happy about it either I should point out remember El Ron how about sure
The only guy know that still writing books from the grave maybe Ron here write his autobiography got plenty of time now
Radio giant here's the story of the day. I saved the most important story for right now
Radio giant in record in decency settlement the federal communications commission the grave robbers that they are the bastards
They lunatics the maniacs that they most definitely are
The FCC has reached a record setting nearly two million dollar settlement with clear-channel communications the anti-Colestos
That would clear the radio giant of all charges of indecency lodges against it including on a remarks made by shock-talk
Howard Stern according to government and radio industry sources
Stern was the cause of previous record settlement between the FCC and a radio company in
1995 I come in co-owned infinity broadcasting which syndicates
Sir and show in 35 cities including Washington paid the FCC one point seven million dollars to wipe away indecency charges against the popular host
Clear channel drops during show from six stations in February as you know certainly
The deal was could be announced as soon as today is the result of months of negotiations between the FCC and clear channel
The nation's largest obnoxious right-wing radio company with more than
250 stations according to the sources who declined to be identified because the details of the agreement have been finalized
Perhaps the most important deal one source said is that the deal would not cover only clear channels outstanding fines
But also dozens of listener complaints in the FCC's indecency pipeline that it hasn't even been ruled on yet
Now the resist kind of like washes everything away. You got it?
I got it 1.7 million that's a peanuts to them again multi-billion dollar company if those complaints were to be sold in fines
I can cross the radio company many more millions
But they won't now because they made kind of a backdoor deal to like wash all of the stuff off
You've got a couple of million and we'll you know, we'll say it's okay for old times sake
And it goes on after the FCC's enforcement bureau levies of fine a broadcaster can choose to pay it contested or negotiated settlement
It takes a majority vote of the FCC's five commissioner to demand a fire to accept the settlement such as the one crafted between the FCC and clear channel attorneys
Wiley Reinen fielding sources said the deal was approved by vote of 4 to 1
The FCC's three Republican commissioners of course chairman Michael Powell Kevin J Martin and Kathleen Q
Abernathy I wonder what the Q stands for voted for the settlement according to sources on both sides Democratic commissioner Jonathan S.
Edelstein agreed in part but Democrat Michael cops voted against the settlement according to FCC sources
Instead wanting each complaint against their channel to be examined rather than grouped into a universal settlement
In other words can't let them off the whole even for old times sake because Michael cops one of the Democrats on the commission is even more rabid than Michael Powell and arrest of these go
I'm how do you like that?
So if you think that it's party politics that ain't it
It's repression and depression and suppression in America freedom of speech forget about it
And
Gold there is a party girl party girl party girl
And culture is a party girl party girl party girl
Under back
Rory
More the smother of the girl who wants to be a media home for girls and on top Quiver
You want more on this lady?

I'll get you guys in trouble. It makes me angry and it's silly and what happened Howard Stern is silly
I don't listen to him
I think he's silly but at the same time I think you ought to have a right to be silly on a radio
This is America. It's a free country and we're supposed to have the right of free speech
That's the way it works in America or the way it's supposed to work in America if Stern is saying stuff on a radio
You don't like it. It depends you. You've got a hand reach out take hold of the knob turn it off. He's gone goodbye
You don't need a politician in your living room to see you've got got to put a band-aid over that guy's mouth nice
Go on Stephen King. How do you like that?
One American who's left who's got the balls to stick up her freedom of speech?
You don't like it turn it off. That's all don't give us this excuse
I was the children the children right the children are speaking words that you never even heard yet out there in the school yard
Who tell you can? Well, that's why see they learned it off the TV
Yeah, right sure they did they learned it from each other in fact they got together and made them up
Like in code so we don't know what they're talking about
Here's some good news though some great news before that. Here's line six Q. I. Am hello
Pretty good paly what's up?
You like it?
Yeah

Okay, thanks pal have a great and they'll see a home Depot not I agree home depots blow he say home Depot blow
Can I have a good list here and then I'm gonna say to you and we don't exempt anybody from this list
If you're one of our fine sponsors that great just have a nice sense of humor and not as a case maybe
But if there are people out there who don't like you they're entitled not to like you might be the best retail outfit going
But if they hate you like poison they're entitled
What retail place in South Florida you hate the most so far Walmart 54?
I think George has got a lock on that nobody likes Walmart evil
Well nobody likes it, but everybody's shopping in there all that dollars trailer party. Yeah, there you go those people
I've been in there a couple of times like for you know what they're good for like turl it stuff
They're good for crap
Really they have to get a toilet seat or something like that or and then the can I say that ball cock or whatever the thing is in there in the town anymore? Oh the ball
That goes in there right
And that's the kind of place where you go and get stuff like that now originally I would have gone to Kmart
But of course, you know the Kmart up by me is long gone. It's history
As Mary Schellenberger would say it's history, but that's just the way it goes
Because that's one of the reasons we hate Walmart is they come along to try to put everybody outside of business
Just like Wayne High Pingadid with his with his what you call it
What do you call it with his blockbuster? That's the same thing. Yeah, yeah
Put all the a mom and pop people out of business the movie the video store
And then of course he bailed out and took all his money with the tears and his eyes. Yeah
How's blockbuster park? Come on a my scene at only no
Walmart 54 when Dixie 38
Accords 25 rooms to go 11 circuit city 10
Brandsmart 3 birdinds 2 macfers giant one best by one
Loes don't have any effort. I'm sure we'll have to all the artwork the after the way effort he made to make that
Uh sams club none and pet boys none 145 votes sams club
Yeah, I'm right out there by me, but I never been in it. Don't go. No, never
They're owned by Walmart, aren't they? I think they are they're owned by Walmart. They're one in the same. Oh my god
The antique least there's every way I
Don't know that. Sam always a little bit liry about these places. They're all over
It's a private club, but it's not a private club, you know what I mean?
In other words, uh, you can go in there and they'll hand anybody a little kid can go in there. Oh here's a card
You know you remember a sams club and they but I understand they sell stuff cheap
It's it's just like a Costco. They sell it in quantity and they got everything Costco's the same thing right? And so what's not to like about that?
BJ's I beg your pardon
T. P. J's
Wow
Yeah, I wish I know he'll be there by noon rectum
Anyway, radio shak. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. I forgot about this. Oh, yeah radio shlock. This is such a bad retail establishment boys and girls
Now if you want I don't like a little some kind of like a little electrical part that you can't find any place like some kind of a little dohickey or something like that
And maybe it's about a 79 cent piece of equipment and you finally find it or somebody finds it for you
Which is unlikely, but you find it hanging on a wall somewhere and you take it to the counter
That's the worst thing you can do
Because when you go to the counter and radio shlock what they want to do is have your shoe size your your whole life history
I mean they want it all I tell them I tell them none of your business
That's a quote says they watch your phone number even if you buy a battery from the
That's exactly right. I'll see what's your address in your phone number and
I don't know what's anymore. It's the last time you got laid
Radio shacks put it on there
For once when somebody says to me or you can pick that up a radio shak. I don't immediately
I'm never gonna throw that piece of equipment out whatever I need for it
Here's the good news. I was gonna give you a film industry gives controversial Iraq film ovation
Where's that Iraq film ovation?
Why don't they just say controversial film ovation
Director Michael Moore's controversial anti-Iraq war film
Firman Highton 11 when a standing ovation last night from an audience of film industry professionals
Attending its west coast debut at Academy Ward headquarters in Beverly Hills after an audience of more than 600 people
The theater of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences cheered whistle and laughed their way through the two-hour film
They jumped to their feet to give more a standing ovation as he took the stage
Clearly boyed by the reception Moore whose film is scathingly critical and mocking a president bush declared
There's been a shift in this country the average American is finally beginning to figure it out
We were dupped into invading Iraq. I hope this country will be back in our hands and a short period of time
He had it Republicans have denounced the film as unfair obviously because there's too much truth in it
Fahrenheit 9-11 with a strong attack on the US president who's highly unpopular in Europe
One of the top prize that they recently can film festival
But it was refused distribution by the Walt Disney company was Miramax film unit made the movie Disney chief Michael Eisner
Is it really worth the effort to do it? Michael
Eisner said the company did not want to distribute a highly partisan film in the middle of a presidential election year
What a cop out that is so he sold the rights to the film back to Miramax heads Bob and
Miramax heads Bob and Harvey Weinstein who formed a consortium to distribute the film and they'll have it in the theaters a week from Friday June 25
It's getting close
The dispute led to a spate of stories of bad blood between the battle Eisner and the Weinstein's including a recent one in the
York Times that speculated Eisner was seeking a buyer for the prestigious Miramax unit
There's nothing like having a buyer for your unit
Weinstein alluded that controversy when introduced the film and joke that he and his brother were taking out a classified ad saying
Two executives looking for a company to run resumes on request
He added if you know any of you know anything will be waiting outside
More one an Academy Award for his 2002 documentary bowling for Columbine about the Columbine high school massacre in Colorado
And the ease with which one could buy a gun in the US of age
In Zermark's last night more predicted Fahrenheit 911 will do three times as well as as Columbine movie
Which you're in direct at a month for a documentary film of 21 and a half million dollars more told Reuters after where that
Furnite would open in between 500 and a thousand theaters on June 25th and amazingly high number for a documentary and I wouldn't say that is
I'm gonna look all this

Well

Price is our high, sure our crazy
Such a simple, stupid, petty little thing
But the cost ain't just foreign, it's skyrocketing
And the reason it's so high, we're just short on supply
And to keep the price is high
There's nothing that they won't try
Would be watching me to buy a smaller automobile
Cost of regular and let it, it's just unreal
Yeah, I know what's up yet
I know the deal, the oil companies that got a license
Steal a gallon, three bucks won't be enough
I bet that next week it will still go up
Yeah, these times are rough
It was lost, now it's found
I've been glad I've been keeping my sights been around
I don't deserve this, but I do get the message
You pay a premium when fuel is precious
If you don't like it, well then hey, join the crowd
Gonna keep going up so you'll be in, coming down
That's a pump, so late, me, pump, pump, so late, me
Price is our so high, sure our crazy
And the pump, so late, me, pump, so late, me, price is our high
Sure our crazy
We got one mark's got 71, which we know surprised
But when did she's got 49?
What retail place in South Florida?
You hate the most and when Dixie's right there in a solid second
Eckerds has got
About third man
Probably would have more except for the sympathy votes
Since the old man croaked
Can I kick it?
Yeah
Now you emailed me a link there and I clicked on it
All it did was take me to ask jeeps.com thing
And, huh?
Yeah, it's from the transportation department
It didn't give you the story?
No
Alright, let me try differently
What is this story?
Please don't come into about the Ronald Reagan
Yeah, about the Ronald Reagan
Turnpike
Turnpike thing there
Ten dollar bill
Pentagon
Nice research there
I'll get it to you somehow
Okay
That's scary
Everything in the world now is Ronny Reaganist and Ronny Reaganat
Reagan National Airport Reagan Turnpike
As we can write in our life time
See it's one thing to argue about religion
And things that happened like thousands of years ago
How about something that happened in most of our lifetimes
I mean most of us were alive
Like let's see what he left office in 88
Would have been his last year, right?
Right
And so that's 16 years ago
So unless you're like a little punk
You were at least alive when he left office
And probably let's see if he were like 10
Yeah, the overwhelming majority of these people
Like over 10 years old and Reagan left office
So it was at our lifetime these events happen
Now we see what revisionist history is really what it's all about
How they twist and turn and make crap up
But oh, he was the great communicator
And he was the greatest president of the 20th century
And he said, all this other crap
It's all bull crap
It's all garbage
And so the idea that we're supposed to believe stuff that allegedly was
Or written allegedly happened thousands of years ago
I mean you have to be a lunatic
You have to be a simple thing
You have to be desperate
You have to be like a little shy
Even little children were laughing that crap
If they had a chance to read it before they were brainwashed into it
Like sandy claws
I mean how to sand a fit down through that chimney anyway
Would have big puppet, right?
Magic
WQM, hello, Lard
Neil God
Yes, sir
Good morning
Buenos dias
Buenos dias, see you as well
Mucha
Buenos dias
Anyway, I don't know if I'm being redundant or not
Did you happen to see that article about the 100 million
Our beloved Pentagon has spent on airline tickets
Yes, son, it's on our website today
That they never use the tickets, sir
It's on there
Yeah, sorry for the redundancy, sir
It's okay
Have a great one
It needs to be said over and over again
Thank you and back to you
Yeah, they had a hundred million dollars worth of airline tickets
That they had bought and they never used them
The Pentagon
Great
I mean, what's a hundred million dollars here
And a few billion over there
And you know
It's not a bit
See the public just doesn't care
That's the problem
The public does not care
Here's a headline in the uh
Observer in England
And the headline says
Catastrophe
It's about the Iraq prison abuse scandal
And
Abu Gharr
And not just there but overall
It says the White House faced its biggest crisis over Iraq last week
But its origins lie in practices that may have been routine
May have been routine
Not just it
We reveal how the abusive prisoners began
Long before the sickening images which have outraged the world appeared
Now this is on our website
And the headline is Catastrophe
But uh it's much much too long
Even a ponderous old fool like me
That's a seven pages long
And even a silly person like George
Wouldn't encourage me to read all of this
Oh please
No no change
You're crazy
I will read a little bit
No not that reading again
Oh yeah wait till we get to the Reagan stuff today
Long over to all we're gonna speak in a Reagan
Our expression
Everywhere
Family members include
Oh brother
See this
You know I should have started
I screwed up today
What I really need to start with was
The media is sick and they talk badly
I mean even when Tom Brokhan Dan Reather
Is saying please please cracker please
And I'm far ready with a Reagan crap
And these people on these talking head networks
Especially they're just obsessed with it
I wonder what's on MSNBC right now
It's a matter of fact
I bet you they got something different on them
They come are saying
Michael Weber and a lot of them are saying
That this is really the last chance for
All of the old Reagan cabinet
Oh oh please please please
How about the BBC
How about you they got something different on
For the terrorists
Who demanded that the three signs
And strong Italian force in Iraq
Should be like that
They're showing the three Italians
Just got home to Fumacino
To a Leonardo da Vinci airport in Roma
They're home safe in the live
Hey are you saying they have a lot of big rack women in the pool
There you go
So what's not to like about that
And I'm talking about I'm talking head networks
That's a different kind
And on the CBC
20 year liberal senator from Ontario
Oh they're talking about the abhorian Canadian elections
That are coming up June 28
And boy it's not looking too good for liberals
I'll tell you that Paul Martin man
I think he made me going down
So to speak
How do you like that?
That's shocking
Anyway getting back to this
There are two versions of what
Specialist Sabrina Harmon
US military police officer was doing with the camera
And the notorious Abu Ghra
And the notorious
Abu Ghra
Prison outside
Backed at he says it's so well
Why should I do it?
According to her mother the former assistant manager of Papa John's
Pizza restaurant in North Virginia
Was collecting evidence of improper treatment in the jail
I don't like Papa John's by the way
Okay
I don't think he's to bring us three pizzas at IOD
But I'm not big fan of their stuff
Robert Harmon told yesterday is Washington post
That when her daughter told her what she was doing during her two weeks leave at home last November
She told her to stop
We got into an argument about it at four o'clock in the morning
Sabrina said she had to prove this
I told her to bring the pictures home hide them and stay out of it
It's not an explanation accepted by the military investigate is probing harmin's role in the abuse at
Neither is it an explanation seemingly born out of the digital photograph seat from harmin's laptop
Among the hundreds of pictures found is one taken before a unit got to
Abu Ghra
Last October a gruesome trophy photograph showing a harmin
Crouching by a decaying corpse giving the camera a thumbs up and a grin
Resolination is also in contradiction with the charges he faces
For what's harmin was emerged as a central figure in the abuse allegations at Abu Ghra
A figure involved in some of those shocking pictures to emerge from the prison
Oh my god
Harmon was one of two soldiers opposed for the now infamous photograph of a pyramid of naked Iraqis in the jail
She's charged with photographing and videotaping detainees ordered a strip and masturbate
And it is harmin who stands accused of attaching wires to a hooded prisoner stood on a box
And telling him that he'd be electrocuted if he fell off
Even harmin's witness statement to investigate his fails to stand up to the claim by her family and lawyer
That she was one of the good guys amid the bad. She makes it clear that she was a participant in the institutionalized torture
The person who brought them in would set the standards and whether or not to be nice said harmin
If the prisoner was cooperating then he'd be able to keep his jumpsuit macros and was allowed cigarettes on request or even hot food
But if the prisoner didn't give us what they wanted it was all taken away until military intelligence decided
Sleep food, clothing, macros and cigarettes, raw privileges and were granted with information received
The statement confirms what the international Red Cross committee has been saying for months
In visits to Iraq's US-administered prison that's been documenting abuse that was not the exception
But was close to the norm of use that was tethered onto a policy of torture and tolerated by coalition forces
According to harmin prisoners were stripped, searched and then made the stand or kneel for hours
At other times they were forced to stand on boxes or hold boxes or to exercise
Seatlessly and what's become increasingly clear in the past few days and interviews with the training special forces soldiers from Iraq was that the techniques employed at Abu Gharr
We're not simply for the cool entertainment of military policemen and private contractors running the prison
But an even cooler application of abusive interrogation techniques
front of both US and British special forces
What's also become clear is that concern over what was happening to Iraqi detainees have been circulating for months
Both within the coalition and within the Red Cross and human rights organizations monitoring Iraq
Suddenly an administration that seemed immune to bad news from Iraq has been forth on the defensive as the images of harmin and her colleagues
Cheerfully abusing prisoners in their charge have emerged as a metaphor for the coalition's failures in Iraq
That has been a catastrophe for US foreign policy is asserted by usually robot senior Pentagon officials who claim privately that Iraq policy is now
97% disaster and the war is no longer being planned by crisis managed from day to day and
Contastrophe was the word used by beleaguered secretary of state Donald Rumsfeld a defense secretary during his humiliating appearance before Congress
So there's just a little bit of that it's seven long pages and it'll make you want to puke your guts out
Contastrophe that's a headline got it. It's a catastrophe. We got it. It's a disaster
Disaster like what's his name Robert Duval said in network
Disaster death now
Asked crop refuses to give Congress torture memo
But do you watch yesterday and the eclipse from the hearings? They were just raking him Ted Kennedy
You know there's a raking him over the coals. They were just busting his balls man. It was great
He was covering him up with a towel, but they were busting them anyway
The US Attorney General refused to give lawmakers copies of adjusted department memo that allegedly advised the White House that tortured during the war interior
Interrogations could be justified
The Washington Post had an August 2002 memo sent by the Justice Department in response to a C.I. request for legal guidance
Said the international laws against torture may be unconstitutional if applied to interrogations conducted during the war on terrorism
But Attorney General John Ascroft refused to provide the memo to lawmakers on the Senate judiciary committee
We believe that to provide this kind of information would impair the ability of advice giving the executive branch to be candid forth right through and accurate at all times
Ascroft said ascroft to lawmakers that while the administration rejects torture
He said he could not provide specific details of communications between his office and a White House
Congress has the right to ask whatever questions it wants he continued, but there are certain things that in the interest of the executive branch operating effectively
That I think it's inappropriate for the Attorney General to say
Democrats expressed outrage at ascroft's refusal to provide the document
You may be in contempt of Congresswoman Democratic Senator Joe Biden
You're not allowed not to answer our questions
He said adding that the justice department had better come up with a good rationale for refusing to furnish the memo
Meanwhile the Senate's top Democrat Tom D'Ashel said at a press conference
It's very important for Congress to have the documents say that any document that suggests torture might be permissible
Underminds the rule of law in this country and around the world
Senator Ted Kennedy said
Senator Kennedy drew a direct link between the memo and the abuse committed by US troops against inmates at the
Abu Gharram Prison in Iraq
We know when these kinds of orders
We know when we have these kinds of orders what happens Kennedy said that they're hearing holding now familiar photos of detainees
Being mistreated at the facility we get the stress test we get the use of dogs
We get the force nakedness that we've all seen
This is what directly results when he had that kind of memorandum out there
The Massachusetts senator said the justice department memo addressed the White House counsel L. Berkdoggenzalas
reportedly said torturing a suspect in captivity may be justified if the US government employee involved will be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the US by the al-Qaeda terrorist network

But I'm sure that there must be some of the Windixi people who hate publics. Right? Maybe you never heard anybody complain about publics.
The only thing probably that they don't like about publics is that A. It's owned by a bunch of goody Tushas, Born Again Christians and B.
And I don't know about the supermarkets because I only shop at publics when I'm home but they're very big on letting the pain in the ass people out front.
You know that the girls scout cookies and the salvation arm. Huh? That's everybody. Well, I bothers a hell out of me. Sure. And then if they don't get you going in there, they you know damn well they recognize you when you're coming out.
You go in and you buy two items. You in the express line. You get out of there in about two minutes and you come right out walk by the same people again.
They're like a hinting up for more crap. No, thanks. No, thanks. I'm diabetic. Those cookies will kill me. Windixi 68. Eckerds 44. Brandsmart 18.
Rooms to go 14. Radio Shack 14. Circant City 12. Pep Boys 6. Home Depot. This thing just flopped on me again. Home Depot has got the 7. Pep Boys 6. Best 5, 5.
Maxis Giant Force. Sam's Club 3 and Loes 2. Best 5's only got 5. Well, I guess so probably those people out there got a lot more patience than we do.
Number one. Number two. They don't mind standing around for hours to save a few bucks. They got plenty of time. I mean, their prices are you know, they're better than circuit city, but who don't want to stand in there waiting and waiting.
It's frustrating too because you just you just see all these people milling around and you wonder what are they doing and why do they keep hurting me over that damn glass counter over there?
They want you in that line, man. They want you staying there obediently and they don't want you to move. Yeah. Bastards 5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.
I have one for your list. Why? Came art. Came art is came art still in business. Oh, there's a worst. Yeah, well, I don't know why, but yeah, where is there a came art in South Florida?
There's a good one in the university and. Still 84. All right. I'll be right over. Thanks. How do you like that? There's still came arts. I might realize it out all out of business. What? Yeah, there's a big came art right by the house. Well, aren't you lucky?
No, I'll go to target. Thank you. Yeah, came art is a schlock shop. There's no question about that. The merchandise is embarrassing. In fact, you know you deal with a real low rent kind of a human being when they're buying their clothes and came art.
I mean, that's about as low as you can go. I will say this. I'll go to came art if I must. Right. Yeah, but I used to go to came art. The one out there by me for certain things. Like if you want to get like a.
That like you yeah, you're right like a bath mat or a towel towels or these stuff like that crap metal rod. Right. But anything like the cost more than three bucks. I would say forget about right. I put for some wrapping paper there once. There you go. Stuff like that. Yeah, if you're into wrapping five six.
I know a lot of people who are shopping at came art, maybe seem to be into wrapping five six seven or five sixty, which is probably one of the reasons about a business out there by the song.
WDQ am hello. Comp USA. Comp USA. Now what's not to like there? Oh God. Every time I go there to buy anything. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I'm going to buy anything. It never does what it's supposed to do. I try to bring it back and I never get it in. They never get it back to them.
I'll be damn okay. I think. I don't know. I never had any bad experience here. Now what's the place by my I'm asking you. I should know it by public.
It's not there by me where as a matter of fact where came art used to be. I think maybe not in the same store, but I'm that that it's not office depot. It's where I got that great brother fax machine for my house.
The same one that I have here. Man, I think I was going to do a hot office max. Is it office max? Well, that's the other place. It's something max. It's max. Huh? No, seriously. Sugar snacks. Maybe it's called.
But that was a nice. That's what it is. No, maybe I guess it's office max, but I went in there looking for a printer and low and behold, they had this brother MFC 4800. Seriously, if I want to recommend anything that I've ever owned in my life, this is it.
You would you would just cry. You would weep if we had this machine there. It's in fact, maybe next time I come back, I'll buy it because of course they're not going to get it. It is so great. It's a factor. It's a printer. It's black and white, but then again, what do I need color for? Right?
Right. Faxor printer scanner copier and it's just it's impeccable, man. It's just sensational. It just cranks it out. I've had this one sitting here for two and a half years. You know, a couple of times I've had paper jam a little bit, but I jam on it. You know, I'm an expert with it now. And so I got the same one for the house. What is not to like? It wasn't staples. Was it? No, I'm pretty sure it's office max 275 bucks. Don't that sound pretty cheap to you, mister? Yeah, they're cheaper, but they probably don't work as good.
What do you mean by that? Like there are cheaper units that do what yours does. Oh, there are cheaper ones. No, but I still say for one as good as this that does all of these different things.
No, it was something with something like that, a complex piece of machinery. Right.
My is priceless. Right. And it was especially here. I mean, I can't afford to be in by lose this thing here. Forget about it. You're doing a show that day. I mean, I just between my computer and that machine near that brother. It's a mother. If I don't have that thing going 5 6 7 open. There's a little free spot for brother. MFC 4800 man. It's a lean machine. It's a great, a great piece of equipment. See, I actually can say something nice about something. If it works great like my beautiful Corvette. What's not to like? See, there's some things that are good and some things that are pure crap.
Like the equipment of QAM 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line WQAM. Hello. Yeah, hello. First time caller like to be able to speak to Neil speaking. Speaking. Speaking. Neil.
Well, I hate to have to be my first call because I love you show for a long time, but I have a little like disagreement about the torture thing. Yeah, I know it's a slippery slope. Okay. And we don't want to go down all the way to be like the people that we're trying to. We are already doing it. Well, we're already doing it. I know. But the thing is like some people in the mission which before before you go ahead, let me just caution you with one thing. Have you noticed that since the scandal erupted,
I've had these bus loads hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that they've released and sent back in their cities from the abble graved just from that one place. It's all political, just to make people happy to show them something, you know, that. No, no, that's not political. The fact is that 70 to 90% of people rounded up didn't do anything wrong in a first place. Yeah, they were just common criminals, but.
Now, a lot of them weren't criminals. A lot of them were just rounded up because they didn't like the way they look. One of them was a cab driver. There were there have been ziggins of stories about these people and most of them weren't criminals at all.
If you could have stopped 9-11 and you had I taught right in front of you, what would you've done with him? Well, what does it have to do with this? First of all, what do the Iraqis have to do with 9-11?
What do the Iraqi people that were rounding up and torturing what do they have to do with terrorists to text against the United States or any of our allies? Can you tell me?
Those little people on the street absolutely nothing. I mean, who say? No, no, any Iraqis, name me any of the Iraqis who had to do with 9-11, please.
It's all we get from the news. I can't believe it. I don't know what you know. It's like I can't believe what the news tells me today, no matter what they say.
Well, what does that mean? So in other words, it's the Iraqis. What about the Iranians? How about everybody? Let's just torture everybody. Anybody in the world who looks like one of those ragheads, we're going to round them all up in torture and we're going to squeeze the truth out of them until they tell us what we want to hear. How's that?
Oh, it's the news media. It's this. I don't know. I don't want to hear that. That was the one true thing you said, sir. I don't know because you sure as hell don't. It's everywhere. Yeah, they're just everywhere. We don't know.
And I know this, which I thought now since there's no weapons of mass destruction and since we know that they're not connected without kind of, I thought we're there to liberate the courageous Iraqi people from the evil dictator that Reagan put in their back in the early 80s.
I thought that was all about. Huh? They're not letting us live. They're so evil. And if we have to torture everything out of them and round them all up, then somewhere along the little confused like this last caller, that's very sad. That is so sad. All you're doing is just to find the unjustifiable. If you want us to behave like barbarians, the ones that we can then, I mean, I wouldn't even dignify with more response. Good luck to you, sir. We'll all need it. But more people run in a mod like you want to lose. We do need it. Wow.
And Reagan is in a casket by the way.
Serial. 27 after 11 yet. I told you the box is not the one that's on display. That's a stun. That's a double.

Right, he wasn't really a nice guy but then again he was Reagan. Reagan was just asked the Nicaraguaans okay they'll tell you.
Yeah those Indians. 74% say Reagan's image should not be placed on any of them.
How do you like that and those people are absolutely correct. How do you like that's a pretty good sign.
Yeah enough already with the Reagan crap. Dan Rather and Tom Broca are right.
Dan Rather and Tom Broca are right. Two goofballs like that can't always be wrong in this case they happen to be right.

Making gestures associated with Nazism during a world wrestling entertainment match in Germany last weekend has caused a prominent performer his mood lighting job as a financial analyst on CBNBC his moaning job.
I guess maybe we can get him an end to replace him.
The network announced yesterday that John Bradshaw Lathiel I never heard of him did you know that's because I don't watch that crap anyway that's the propaganda network the gambling channel.
John Bradshaw Lathiel was fired from his job as CNBC contributor Lathiel was hired last month after serving as a guest analyst for the Fox Nazi news channel which began featuring a regular last year following a release of his book have more money now.
In an apparent attempt to draw a crowd response during his match against WWE champion Eddie Guerrero in Munich I witness reports that Lathiel goose stepped around the ring and raised his arm numerous times in Adolf Hitler salute.
Such actions are illegal in Germany although no criminal charges were brought against the 13 year wrestling veteran after the show in this maybe he was just doing something to please L president they hear now that could be it.
Maybe just think of the Bushmeister in a statement of CNBC spokesman said Lathiel was fired because we find his behavior to be offensive inappropriate and not be fitting anyone associated with our network.
The WWE also responded the incident through a statement on its website.
WWE and John Lathiel deeply regret Mr. Lathiel's actions in the ring at our event in Munich and apologize if it's offended or upset our fans Mr. Lathiel has been reprimanded for his actions and probably will be sent to Abu Garh Reb to be tortured by that last caller.
Such sanctions were not released although it's a bent and believe Lathiel was set to meet Tuesday with WWE owner Vince McMahon in other words so yesterday.
Lathiel pretty cis was most recently elevated to a main event position on the WWE Smackdown roster after his character was changed to portray him as an anti-immigration zealot with Mexicans usually the targets of his prejudice during weekly through the telecast on UPN.
Sounds like a lovely deal to me.
Hey by the way something.
Yes.
That story I heard this morning is up on NPR's site about Ashcroft about the memos and what does it say that our other stories haven't said.
Nothing but people might want to hear it and they can play it over and over again and hear them hit it.
Or is that a website?
No but I found it and I'm going to send a link to Eric and I just want to let you know about it.
Well don't now listen don't start overburdening Eric with all kinds of stuff because he's already whoa he's away he's got to make some money if they're in Orlando he's got to pay the bills.
He's got to support his very picky Japanese wife and family he can't afford to be spending all of his time with this marginal show okay.
What retail place in Southland I've got a whole bunch I might just I don't know.
Let's see I got one two three four just five more Reagan bashing stories just five.
Yeah.
Oh come on.
Oh but before that so that you don't get carried away.
Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada decided yesterday not to go to Washington to attend the state funeral former US President Ronald Reagan.
Oh right.
I've gone Paul.
Two days after his letter of condolence raised eyebrows about whether he's distancing himself from the West during a hard fought election campaign.
The meaning of one here a let's say a lot of ambivalence came through a US official said yesterday the same issue over the weekend by Prime Minister Paul Martin's office.
It seemed to underscore things somewhat.
The letter referred to Mr. Reagan is one of the most influential leaders of the past 50 years and stated that he helped lay the foundations for the end of the Cold War and much greater cooperation between East and West.
But it was largely observational in tone steering clear of the kind of rhetoric employed by leaders such as French President Jacques Chirac who loved the 40th president as a great statesman who leave a deep mark in history.
Canada will be represented at the funeral by attorney by Governor General Adrian Clarkson.
I think the world will understand that we have an election going on into the Prime Minister's international commitments have been quite extensive already.
Liberal spokesman Stephen McKinnon said yesterday and of course since the Liberals here are in pins and needles and latest poll shows them trailing the Tories the conservative by two percentage points.
He don't have time to be didlin' around with some Tiska Tatskitt.
Let's go see Ronny's casket.
University of Toronto historian Robert Bothwell said yesterday it's entirely appropriate for Ms. Parks and Woodhead rather than Paul Martin.
That's what Adrian is paid to do he said.
In other words be like a figurehead.
Got it?
So Paul Martin won't be there. Don't be looking for him.
Boy he's boring.
One thing about Canadian politics man even though this is a wonderful country that is so boring.
Galton McGinty.
Oh brother.
Boring.
Ernie Eves he was boring.
Adam and Eve.
Adam and Steve.
They like Adam and Steve here a lot better than Adam and Eve I should point that out to you before you come up.
Author TV Alman who's latest book Roe State America at World with the World will be in Coral Gables tomorrow June 10th at 6 p.m.

Stop by and to pull on Woody Graber's ponytail.
I'm sure Woody will be there right?
Right.
Give me the ink.
Exet sound.
If Miami Town at 560 WQA.
What 40 out would I say 147 band this is a quick show, wasn't it?
Wow, let's see those stories.
Yeah, 1147 at 560 WQA and here this fax must be from my good friend Ian Framowicz at Woodbind says how about our old friend our old Jumeil Asman?
Now, last man, the former mayor of Toronto, he was great.
Real character, real goofball, a lot of times very out of touch with reality.
But he was fun.
He had a great sense of humor. He's just goofy. Nobody took him serious.
As opposed to David Miller, our current mayor who's boring.
As says welcome back to Woodbind. Where's Randy Wapel's at Woodbind by the way in?
What's going on over there?
Best harness driver in the world today is beyond a shadow without Luke Willett.
Man, he is just unbelievable.
And there were a lot of rumors that he's also f***** up. That's beside the point. Nobody cares about that.
Whip him again Luke, come on smack him.
Clark, more reasons to admit he ran than he racked.
I hope that guy was, and you know people would say, see that's why people don't want to disagree with you because he hangs up on him.
I thought I had that guy in a fairly long time considering how in out of touch he was?
Yeah, waiting a long time for him to justify any harm.
I gave him plenty of opportunity to justify this insanity that he was trying to make and it just aggravating the fact that he had no way.
And then to go on about well, you know, the media, yeah, when in fact it's quite the opposite.
The media are the ones who are covered most of this crap up and have been for a long time.
His point is that's the only way we can, because he almost said it in your kind of mouth, but it's the only way that the only thing these people understand.
Is that what it is?
That's what he was talking about.
What do you mean these people?
Do you mean the ones who are liberating?
Yeah.
The ones who are emancipation by the capitation that crowd.
You know, they're brown, they kind of hook nose, they wear rags on their heads.
It would have made more sense to invade Iran than Iraq's former US counterterrorism advisor, Richard Clark, who already has accused the Bush Administration of being soft on terrorism and wasting resources by the Iraq attack.
He said mere possession of weapons of mass destruction did not justify invading your country.
This was the US government's stated grounds for the Iraq war.
If you take the case of Iran, its nuclear program is far more advanced than Iraq's was, Clark told the Austrian daily newspaper, Dersstandard, and interview translated into the Choi-man.
There would have been far more grounds to invade Iran than Iraq.
US believes Iran's nuclear program is a front for developing atomic weapons to randomize this saying its atomic ambitions are limited to generating electricity.
Well, let's find a bunch of Iranians and tie them up and torture them and find out what really is going on.
The US military has found none of the caches of Iraqi WMDs in Washington that the Washington said Saddam Hussein had possessed in abundance and has recently published memoirs against all enemies, Clark charged with the administration of Bush did not take the al-Qaeda threat seriously enough before the 9-11 attacks and needlessly attacked Iraq.
In a chapter entitled that almost war 1996, Clark says former US President Bill Clinton almost lost the war against Iran for what Washington says it's support for terrorism against the US.
By the way, speak at a clip and last on a biography that had Bill Clinton.
And I got to confess because I remember that call I had a few months ago and I said here like,
I had totally erased from my mind because we were so obsessed with Monica and with blue dress and penis gate and the stain on the dress and all that Ken Starcraft.
I had forgotten about the bombing of Iraq that devastating bombing like right at the D-Day there, right at the point where like Bush was coming to shove so to speak under the desk.
Hadn't you forgotten about that?
All forgotten.
Yeah.
And again, that's the news media thing.
Well, it's wagon the dog and you know something you probably was wagon the dog where he had to do something pretty sad.
He was doing some...
Oh, speaking of that, Mark Anthony says he may not be doing something.
This is so... can't that bitch just go away already that J-Lo?
Can't she just go away? Marry a whole bunch of guys.
Okay, go and have a great time. Screw your brains out.
I bet she's never even seen a penis that woman.
I really don't think she's seen one.
That's my honest opinion to you.
Okay. I'm not arguing with you.
I don't think she could even draw you a diagram.
At least Monica could draw a picture.
Deeming his personal life off limits, Mark Anthony dodged questions Tuesday about whether he and J-Lo got married this past weekend.
The Latin singer performing in Rockefeller Plaza for NBC's Today Show repeatedly deflected questions for most mad Laura about the widely reported nuptials.
Anthony could be seen wearing what appeared to be a wedding band on his left hand while performing two.
It's got a picture. If it's not a wedding band, it sure is hell.
Maybe he got in a box of crack reject because it looks like one to me. Maybe it's a rubber band.
That might be it. Maybe he's got hemorrhoids. Maybe he got one of the spare rubber bands on his finger in case it pops up again.
Lopez and Anthony reportedly tied the knot Saturday in a small ceremony at a Beverly Hills, California home.
Anthony's publicists were not coming Monday.
Lopez is represented not immediately. We turn it called Monday but told the AP on Sunday. He had no comment.
Oh, I don't tell me this is going to be another one. Oh, not again. Are we getting sucked in again?
Oh, my God. I'm telling you.
Can you imagine all the starving people in the world we could feed just with her?
Just fry it up, man. Come on. It's a lot of greasy.
So, you say, huh?
A greasy fire.
This people can go on the Atkins, the high fat, high up protein diet.
The Atkins.
Right. The Atkins, the JLo Atkins diet. I like it. They're asking for it all over the world.
God. What a what a force. What an...
I guess it's a hell of a lot there than having talent.
Or if you don't have a new talent, you come up with some kind of bull crap like that.
Who am I going to marry this week? Nobody cares. Okay. Bitch get lost.
Some people are saying the way Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice are portrayed in the ad for the new
Stepward Bives film is distasteful even out of rages. You ready for that?
No.
The spot shows an image of rice made to look nude from the waist up and a picture of Clinton that morphs into what looks like a cookie-baking steppered wife.
It's got the pictures right here.
Oh, I think we got this on our website. I'm pretty sure we do. You can see the pictures.
I hope we did. I'm sure I did.
The pictures move across the screen very quickly, but they caught the eye of a Kansas City woman who recorded the spot to make sure what she was really seeing.
Becky Randall said when she taped and watched the ad again, she realized it was even worse than what she'd suspected.
Oh, you've got to see this.
We must go immediately right now to our website.
Okay. And shame on me if I didn't email this to Eric yesterday.
Let me just take a quick peek if I can ever get to it.
It says it's just inappropriate. It needs to be stopped. Becky Randall said for those who haven't seen the 1975 thriller by director Brian Forbes.
The 2004 version is pretty much the same, but with the national technical wizardry.
Let's see. Let me drop down here. What's the headliners controversial stag? I guess it's pretty clear what the hell it is.
Is it on there? Do you see it? Churchill.
I don't see it.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
It's not on there. Like I said, my bad. Sorry, Eric. Well, I'm going to email the two of them right now during the break.
Okay. Because at least you'll be able to see the picture.
I can't wait. You will just pee in your pants. I'll guarantee you.
And then Josh can get his buddy Josh Beckett to come by.
Anyway, both films are based on a book by Errol Levin about a small Connecticut town where they win and act too perfectly because their husbands have replaced them with robots.
But Randall says the less than perfect images in the ad for the new film will keep her out of the theater.
Pat Gray who works with North Star marketing group says the ad shows bad taste toward rice and Clinton.
In today's media environment, I don't know whether it's unacceptable morally or not.
This tasteful for sure, Gray said if I were them, I'd probably sue.
Gray said the ad wouldn't drive him to the theater. That certainly wouldn't stimulate me to go see the movie.
He said, and of course, who the hell wants to see companies and make it anyway or see.
What's your name at all Hillary Nancy Kirk Packard. He spoke for Paramount picture said the film studio hasn't received any complaints about the spot.
Paramount hasn't heard from rice or Clinton either. How do you like that?
So I'm going to pull the same scam today that I did yesterday. I'm seeing those.
I saved all my Reagan bashing columns for the new to one hour because all the Reagan lovers, they're going to be turned over to rush anyway, right?
Right. Listen to him pop a few oxies right on the air. They're between noon and whatever he's on.
This is fine. That's okay. Have a good life. Listen to all that bull crap that he makes up as he goes along. I write when propaganda about how Reagan was the greatest things since sliced halva.
And have a good life. Right. Right. And it's good for lunchtime anyway.
So if there's anybody who wonders how come it is that there are so many people buying into whatever the media feeds them because this is the way it always is because it was uninformed people like that tragic guy that collar we had.
I just want to cry. Now you think maybe that there's any chance that was a put on he was just no no no no no.
Oh God. How depressing.

No, wait.
That's the only call that we have.
The things on your nose is growing again.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.
Wow.
Don't go, don't go.
Wow, wow.
Don't go, don't go.
Wow.
You got thick, with a stain.
I know that I have a stain.
And around those losing pimples.
You call my, wow, wow, wow.
If you go look, then down here I don't see.
A road map of YSL&D.
You got your happy son.
Way to die, die, die, die.
Wow.
My nose glows when something stays.
Almost every day I take.
And my veins, as they start to tickle.
I add an oil to the door to door to door.
Yeah, I look like the flower of a bird.
That's what comes out of the cremary of fire.
The little sex field with wiggle veins.
Yeah.
And then fly into the door to see.
And say it's kind of a strawberry.
I know that I'm leaving wiggle veins.
I'll tell you what, here ain't nothing like the moment
Gully's show.
Not the real one, but the Bokobryon one.
I keep telling these people if they would put him on the air
like for a couple of hours in, like six to eight, we'd have a 40-year.
Put that pollen in the back of the old folks home, you know?
You know what I'm saying is true.
It'd be great because the Bokobryon, Mo and Gully are just 50 million times more entertaining than the real ones who are busy.
I guess they're like bonding again now.
They got no choice.
Okay, here's the way this result of our poll.
We don't want to forget about that, but I got a lot of heavy-duty stuff here.
I didn't email that to Eric during the break and I'm sure it will be on there momentarily.
The story will be stupid.
He got it.
He got it and you'll get it.
And then you can take a look.
I mean, it's not a big deal.
Actually, you can see you can view because the link is on the story to the actual video.
So not only would you see the pictures being watched the video too.
Well, you'll see for yourself.
It's amusing.
And speaking of that, yes, the link to that NPR audio story is on there.
So you can hear Ashcroft getting grilled.
Oh, great.
I was trying to hear Ashcroft sing on our website, but for some reason I can't get it to play.
Can you?
I didn't try to play it off the website.
I heard it in the original.
If you want to check out the Fahrenheit 9.11 trailer, don't forget it.
So we got a link to that right on our website, NeilRodgers.com.
Here's the poll.
What retail place in South Florida?
You hate the most.
Hate the spies.
You wouldn't go there if they give you a hundred dollar bill.
Well, Walmart, 137.
Windixie 101.
I'm really amazed at that.
You think that's because so many.
And I noticed that Windixie's been running spots about how they're cleaning up their stores and they're refurbishing and the others.
Because Windixie, I think, has a reputation.
There's a lot of other stores being kind of schmutzy, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
As opposed to those sparkling, beautiful public stores.
Anyway, Walmart 137.
Windixie 101.
Eckerds 55.
Brands, Mark 48.
Radio Shack has got...
BOT-30, man.
Rooms to go 18.
Circuit City 18.
Came, Mark 14.
Best Buy 13.
For those of us impatient folks.
We like to merchandise.
We love their prices.
But we just don't have all day.
Home Depot 9.
Bird Eines 8.
Pet Boys 8.

Out of 476.
I'm here.
There's some more.
And we'll get to them or not.
And we'll get to some more.
A little later on.
Good, right?
I hope.
Like maybe right now.
WQM.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing today?
Great.
You were talking before.
I remember you mentioned the gambling channel.
Yeah.
And I hate to mention this.
But I was flipping the channel last night and I came across Dennis Miller.
And on his panel, he had Phil Hendry.
Oh, no.
Are you straighting in and trying to tie Reagan and put it together?
No, no.
No wonder Dennis Miller show us about a 0.2 share.
He's got his numbers are so unique that he can't fight him on a mat.
Dennis Miller is so smug.
Yeah.
And I just can't well after that call you have before.
Who has no problem with the torture.
And I guess he probably has no problem with people getting swept up here
from minor offenses and being killed in jail.
Oh, sure.
I'm sure he's waiting for Patriot Act 456 coming along.
Or when our soldiers get captured.
Right.
They can do that to our soldiers in humiliating degrees.
I know he's spread the films all over the world.
As long as we're taking out the evil doers, I guess anything goes.
Amen.
Have a good day, Neil.
Thank you.
No, man.
Thank you.
Okay.
Anyway, it's, well, what's the use?
You know, you deal with the American public in this Reagan thing.
There's Phil.
Born again right-winger now.
How do you like that?
Is that incredible or what?
Okay.
Born again right-wing, uh, licky, licky, licky, kissy, kissy.
What a suck up.
Can't complain about his credibility.
Not that he ever had any, but that was his act.
You know, his act was intentionally sticked, but just what a turnaround.
But if he wants to be on those clear channel stations, I guess.
And if you missed the story, clear channeling FCC have kissed and made up for about $2 million.
The FCC says, oh, well, this will wipe the slate clean.
All these other complaints we got.
We're not even going to look at them.
We're just whatever you did wrong, screw it.
You know, it could be like maybe, who knows?
It could be hundreds of millions for all we know, all the complaints that they've had.
But they will wipe it all off the slate.
They will take to a million, thank you.
Is that incredible or what?
No, it's credible.
Robert Scheer in the LA Times, one of my favorite columnists, writes,
a nice guy's nasty policies.
He says, I liked Ronald Reagan, despite the huge divide between us politically.
Reagan was a charming old pro who gave me hours of his time in a series of interviews beginning in 1966
when he was running for governor, simply because he enjoyed the give and take.
In fact, I often found myself defending the gipper whenever I was confronted with an East Coast pundit,
determined to denigrate anyone, especially actors from my adopted state.
Yet looking back at his record, I'm appalled that I warmed to the man as much as I did.
The fact is that Reagan abandoned the Roosevelt New Deal, which he admitted and saved his family during the Great Depression.
Let me say it again, which he admitted had saved his family during the Great Depression,
in favor of a belief in the efficacy of massive corporate welfare,
incoctated in him by his paymasters at Warner Brothers,
General Electric and the conservative lecture circuit.
Though Reagan's man was hardly mean-spirited,
Reagan the politician betrayed the social programs and trade unions,
as he once believed in so fiercely.
Let's start with his leadership of California,
where he launched attacks on the state's once-incoperable public universities
and devastated its mental health system.
For shadowing, future Trumped up invasions of tiny Grenada and Nicaragua,
he sent thousands of National Guardsmen and tear gas burglary.
It also became increasingly clear that all the man wasn't unintelligent
in his ability to mingle truth with fantasy with frightening.
At different times, Reagan, who infamously said that,
facts are stupid things, falsely claimed to have ended poverty in Los Angeles,
implied he was personally involved in the liberation of Europe's concentration camps,
argued that trees caused most pollution,
and said that the Hollywood blacklist to which he contributed names never existed,
described as freedom fighters the contra-thugs and the religious fundamentalist in Afghanistan
who would later become Al Qaeda, and claimed that fighting a limited nuclear war
was not an insane idea.
But the Cimony is a bumpkin as some did with very much to underestimate him.
Like Nixon, the Teflon President was a survivor who'd come up the hard way
and many journalists and politicians who didn't understand that
and variably were surprised by his resiliency and savvy.
Although he generally was compliant with his hand-versed,
whenever the campaign pros-origin ideologues
vat in the way of his or Nancy's instincts, they were summarily discarded.
Even when his ideas were silly, his intentions often seemed good.
For example, one of the dumbest and costliest pet project,
the Star Wars Missile Depends Program, which he first announced when I interviewed him
in for the LA Times in 1980, was touted by Reagan as a piece offering to the Soviets.
And his legendary ability to effectively project an upbeat, confident worldview
managed to obscure to project that, to obscure many of the negative consequences of his policies.
For example, he made the terrible mistake of willfully ignoring the burgeoning AIDS epidemic
at a time when action could have saved millions.
Unlike many conservatives, however, he wasn't driven by homophobia,
instead Reagan allowed AIDS to spread for the same reason he pointedly savage programs to help the poor.
He was genuinely convinced that government programs exacerbated problems
unless they catered to the needs of the businessman he had come to revere.
In the White House, he ran up more death than any earlier president,
primarily to serve the requests of what Republican President Eisenhower had with the alarm term
the military-industrial complex, George W. Bush, by the way, has broken his record.
A apologist for this wait argued that throwing money at the defense industry
broke the back of the Soviet Union and ended the Cold War.
But the Soviet Union was already broken as Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged quite freely when he came to power in the 80s.
Rather, what Reagan does deserve considerable credit for is ignoring the dare warnings of the hawks
and respawning enthusiastically to Gorbachev in their historic wake of its summit,
where the two leaders called for a nuclear-free world.
Let it be remembered, then, that in the closing scene of his presidency,
Reagan embraced the peacemakers, rejecting the cheerleaders of Armageddon
and was then loudly cascaded by the very new conservatives,
the most vociferously Richard Puril, who have claimed the Reagan and the mantle
for the post-war Cold War militarism and the current administration.
Richard Puril, Paul Wolfe, what's there? Sluppet him all out again now, man. You'll see him all.
Each and every one of them.
I saw that trailer. It works. It's on there.
The trailer, you're step-for-wise.
Oh, the step-for-wise thing is on there, and how does Condoleezza look?
Uh, well.
Never better. How's that?
She never looked better, old Condoleezza. Maybe spruce that bitch up a little bit,
and Hillary, man, with that apron on, making them muffins, they even fixed the gap between her teeth.
Oh, Condoleezza, I thought maybe even Hillary.
Yeah, the gap.
I see. Well, Hillary, that's another story.
Like, above us, he's had a lot more women than he has, meaning Hillary.

The Gwiley is an ambassador.
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the TruHollywood celebrity music biography profile story,
they were from Canada, where everything is so much better.
They were Len.
I know that it's all better for me.
It's more like a song.
Our music was a boot like positive and upbeat things, eh?
Len's founder, Marcus Stanzo.
Basically, Canadians are like happier than you Americans, eh?
We got like a healthcare system that like works, eh?
And like the crime rate is much lower here, eh?
And nobody in the Middle East is like mad at us, eh?
We trying to say.
Oh, nothing, eh?
Just nobody calls us the great Satan or anything, eh?
Look, that's enough, you Canadian.
Oh, it's okay.
I know what the hostility is a booty.
But like, we're this close to legalizing marijuana here, too.
You are? How's anything?
Oh, any day.
Eh, listen, you think it could put me up for a few weeks?
You know why? Let's go about a place to live.
Oh, sure, eh?
Great. Sorry I got bad before.
Whoa.
An apology, eh?
I've never heard an American do that, eh?
Len, there upbeat positive music has shed new light on a place that just might decide not
to put me in jail for getting high.
It's a big, juicy, sobbing-wit-look-it-show business tonight, uninside the mind.
You got a right, eh? 1217 and 516 here.
Just watch that, eh, myself, the video.
And you're right, Condoleezan never looked lovely.
Even though it's just a quick flash, so to speak.
It will flash in a pan, and there's Hillary with those muffins in the apron.
It's a beautiful thing.
Anyway, that story that I got called about before I knew I had it, and it was in my pile.
If I can say, can I say, pile?
No.
It was in my, uh, bunch of stuff.
Pentagon pays for unused airline tickets, so we can digress from Ronnie for just a moment or two.
Can we do that?
We're a great men, very, very close to Mrs. Reagan.
Oh.
Uh, we got a new format now in America.
It's all Reagan all day, every day.
Now Fridays at National Holiday, we've got the stock market closed, the banks will be closed.
Everything's going to be closed it down on Friday, because it's Ronnie Reagan day.
Anyway, the Defense Department spent an estimated $100 million for airline tickets that were not used over a six-year period,
and failed to seek refunds, even though tickets were reimbursable, congressional investigators say, easy come, easy go.
Even though tickets were reimbursable, that's enough to piss off the Pope.
The Department compounded the problem by reimbursing employee claims for tickets bought by the Pentagon the investigators said,
to demonstrate how easy it was to have the Pentagon pay for airline travel, the investigators posed as defense employees,
handed the Department a ticket and showed up at the ticket counter to pick up a boarding pass.
Congress's general accounting office issued the findings in two reports on the Pentagon's lack of control over airline travel,
copies of which the AP obtained yesterday.
A prior report issued last November found that the pay-lion Pentagon bought 68,000 first-class or business-class airline seats for employees, who should have flown coach.
At a time when our soldiers are patrolling the streets, they were wrecking unarmored humbys when a Bush administration is asking for wrecking defense spending,
Secretary Rumsfeld is lighting hundreds of millions of dollars that could be used to protect our troops in our country, go to waste,
said representative Jan Shakowski, Democrat of Illinois, one of three lawmakers who ordered the studies.
The GAO estimated that between 1997 and 2003, the Defense Department bought at least $100 million in tickets that were not used or used only partially by a passenger,
who did not complete all legs of a flight.
The waste went undetected because the Department would allow the individuals to report the unused tickets and guess what, they didn't.
How do you like that?
Not that we want to get you, uh, surely, it's, you know, not that enough other problems going on.
Especially that Reagan funeral, man.
Yeah.
What? You're not upset about that?
About the funeral? Oh, just that I'm not in the right place.
No, about just about the coverage, not so much the funeral.
When is it ever going to end? Ever?
No.
This goes on and on.
Here, oh, no. Oh, no. This is the worst news I ever heard in my life.
Are you sure?
This fact you just sent me, I'm going to like upchuck right now.
Just, uh, I can't stand it.
Oh, no.
Do I dare read it?
You know the one I'm talking about. Yeah, yeah, you have to read it.
It's, uh, this is so sick and I just, it's beyond belief.
You know, it's one thing to sell out.
Mm-hmm.
But to do it to such a degree, Phil Henry, not as a regular segment on the Dennis Miller show,
it says, so sad, he also does a sickening pro-Boish pro-war rant for the first couple of segments of his show,
pretty much every night I had to stop listening.
How do you like that?
Okay.
Oh, geez.
Good, golly Miss Molly.
That's sick.
That is really sick.
That's enough to encourage me to continue reading all these bedtime stories.
I know I'm doing a lot of this stuff this week more than you lately, but I don't really care.
Okay.
I'm so nauseated by the, by the public being indated with all these lies with his bullcrap.
Oh, God.
Now this real player is trying to like do stuff on my, I don't want to do it right now.
Okay, later.
Later.
Except I said, whatever you want, I said, next.
Here you go.
Oh, geez.
Don't you hate it when that happens?
Yes.
And it's your fault because you don't want to make me watch that video.
All I was worth it.
It was well worth it.
Lots of good stuff you can, and I see it with all the respect to you, the NPR, which you're obsessed with NPR,
the audio of that story about Ascroft.
That's the same story that I read beginning of the show, but in the story that you read, you don't hear him,
you know, having and hawing and getting grilled by those people, which you should be sure to listen to the audio.
Oh, well, I can start to be sure and listen to the audio.
It's on there.
Boy, you got a lot of assignment.
This ought to keep you off the streets today.
Folks, keep you out of trouble.
You got the, uh, beaded curtain with Rebecca Romaine Stamos.
And those very suspect hands on her, well, they're not real hands.
And then you got the fantastic montage collage of nudies that create the picture of John Ascroft.
That is, where did that come from?
Somebody faxed the link to us.
Thank you very much.
Whoever did that.
I think I saved it.
Well, thank you so much.
Paul Corbman writes in the New York Times, the great taxer.
This is his take.
He says over the course of this week, we'll be hearing a lot about Ronald Reagan, much of its false.
A number of news sources have already proclaimed Mr. Reagan, the most popular president of modern times.
In fact, though Mr. Reagan was very popular in 1984 and 85, he spent the latter part of his presidency under the shadow of the Iran-Cutler scandal.
Bill Clinton had a slightly higher average gallup approval rating and a much higher rating during his last two years in office.
Oh, we want you back, Bob, please, please, with or without that dress.
I'll leave a kind of cute in it.
We're also sure to hear that Mr. Reagan presented over an unmatched economic boom.
Again, not true, the economy grew slightly faster under President Clinton and, according to congressional budget office estimates,
the aftertax income of a typical family adjusted for inflation rose more than twice as much from 1992 to 2000, as it did from 1990 to 1988.
But Ronald Reagan does hold a special place in the anals of tax policy and not just as the paper-in-stative tax cuts, to as credit he was more pragmatic and responsible than that.
He followed his huge 1981 tax cut with two large tax increases. In fact, no peacetime president has raised taxes so much on so many people.
This is not a criticism. The tale of those increases tells you a lot about what was right with President Reagan's leadership and what's wrong with the leadership of George W. Bush.
The first Reagan tax increase came in 1982, but then it was clear that the budget projections used to justify the 81 tax cut were wildly optimistic.
In response, Mr. Reagan agreed to a sharp rollback of corporate tax cuts and a smaller rollback of individual income tax cuts.
Overall, the 82 tax increase on did about a third of the 81 cut, as a share of GDP increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase.
The contract with President Bush is obvious. President Reagan confronted with evidence that his tax cuts were physically irresponsible,
changed course. President Bush confronted with similar evidence, has pushed for even more tax cuts.
Mr. Reagan's second tax increase was also motivated by a sense of responsibility, or at least that's the way it seemed at the time.
I'm referring to the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which followed the recommendations of a commission led by Alan Greenspan.
Its key provision was an increase in the payroll tax that pays for Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance.
For many middle and low-income families, this tax increase more than under any gains for Mr. Reagan's income tax cuts.
In 1980, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, middle-income families with children paid 8.2% of their income in income taxes, and 9.5% in payroll taxes.
By 1988, income tax share was down to 6.6%, but the payroll tax share was up to 11.8%, and the combined burden was up, not down.
Nevertheless, there was a broad bipartisan support for the payroll tax increase because it was part of a deal.
The public was told that the extra revenue would be used to build up the trust fund dedicated to the preservation of Social Security benefits securing the system's future.
Thanks to the 1983 Act, current projections showed that under current rules, Social Security is good for at least 38 more years.
But George W. Bush has made it clear that the intents to be nigg on the deal is officials insist that the trust fund is meaningless, which means that they don't feel bond to honor the implied contract that dedicated the revenue generated by President Reagan's payroll tax increase to paying for future Social Security benefits.
Indeed, it's clear from the arithmetic that the only way to sustain President Bush's tax cuts in the long run will be with sharp cuts in both Social Security and Medicare benefits.
I did not and do not approve of President Reagan's economic policies, which saddle the nation with $20,000 in debt, and as others will surely point out, some of the foreign policy shenanigans that took place on his watch notably the Iran Compreh scandal for shadow of the current debacle in Iraq, which not coincidentally involves some of the same actors.
Still on both foreign and domestic policy, Mr. Reagan showed both some pragmatism and some sense of responsibility.
These are attributes, sorely lacking in the man who claims to be his political successor.
So not quite as hard on Reagan, all those good points, and just again scathing on the Bushmeister and rightfully so.
I have no life.
Can I tell you? The Bushmeister.
It's America for you, baby, Zined America.
Now let's see, am I done with this thing over here on my computer?
A wreck of God.
Finish. Finish. Please. Finish. Swedish. An origin. This can out of my life already.
What retail place in South Florida? Do you hate the most? That's our poll today, which we're kind of ignoring right now, but we got some bigger fish to fry.

It's a great day for art. Link letter. He turns 110 today. He's still alive. Any.
I guess I don't know. He's going to live. He's out with Larry once in a great while. They shove him in.
Prop him up in the seat. And you watch those two dead men making conversation. That's a lot of fun. 27 past noon at QA.

I'll spray you all over the joint. You hear?
Bob Slobitingi cares about our environment.
These shores here are precious to our environment. It's my job to monitor their majestic beauty while it lasts.
The concerns of this oil rig group chief may not surprise you. What might surprise you is who we work for.
Shell.
We work hard to keep the bay of hair clean. We throw the coral and tropical fish back in after spray paint it back to its original color.
And mine grew as plenty of chloroxic cleaning oil ducts.
See? Panging higher prices at the pump is a good thing.
These shores should stay pristine for the next three or four years, once we massacre the savages and dispose of their bodies properly.
The efforts of good folks like Bob provide the luxury of giving your SUV enough power to intimidate smaller cars in front of you before having to fill up again at the next available shell station.
It goes without saying. I like that city bank K-check every week.
We represent what Saudi America is all about all around the world. If you don't like Shell, go to hell.
And we don't care if we mess up your Agastinic anyway.
1232 or 560 W.H.M. Are you ready for the worst story you've ever heard in your life?
Even worse than Phil Henry is sucking up with Dennis Miller?
I'm ready. It's not about that problem, is it?
No, it's about Laura Bush.
Just in, only moments ago. You ready for this? I don't think you are or ever will be.
Laura Bush, I want you to listen to every word of this very carefully.
Right.
Laura Bush, whose father died from Alzheimer's disease,
said today that she admired Nancy Reagan's devotion to former President Ronald Reagan until his death,
but could not back her call for relaxation of stem cell research restrictions.
58 members of the Senate, I figure what the number was, I think a couple hundred members of the House have already signed onto this.
They've hopped on board.
But not Laura, not the Bush's man, Reagan the 40th while we know he died.
Mrs. Bush, whose father died in 1997 of Alzheimer's, said she had great respect for the former First Lady
and that she was an excellent role model for family struggling to cope with the disease.
I know how very difficult it is for the patient, obviously, but also for the caregiver.
It requires unbelievable strength of character to take care of the first few love as you see them slip away like that.
The long goodbye they call Alzheimer's, the First Lady told the CBS early show from Seattle and Georgia,
where leaders of the group of eight countries are meeting.
But Mrs. Bush said she did not endorse Nancy Reagan's call already re-bucked by the White House to allow greater stem cell research to proceed in the hope that it would provide some answers to the disease or possibly even a cure.
The Bush administration has placed restrictions on embryonic stem cell research and opposes using stem cells for most embryos,
as Stan Mrs. Bush said she supports.
These there are stem cells to do research on and we have to be really careful between what we want to do for science and what we should do ethically, the First Lady said,
stem cell is certainly one of those issues that we need to treat very carefully in between torturing all those prisoners.
Pressed and whether she was prepared to endorse Mrs. Reagan's impassioned call for restrictions to be lifted, she replied, no.
More than 200 members, like I just said only moments ago of the US Senate and the House, have also urged Bush to allow researchers to use embryonic stem cells to eventually provide brain cell transplants to Alzheimer's patients.
They also hope to use embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, heart disease, diabetes and a range of other illnesses.
But just like Nancy Reagan said almost everything else, the answer from Laura Bush was, please take Nancy's advice, just say, wow.
They also hope to use embryonic stem cells to treat Parkinson's, spinal cord injuries, heart disease, diabetes, a wide range of other illnesses including Alzheimer's, first and foremost of which Laura Bush's father died and Ronald Reagan just died but nevertheless the answer is still no.
Because we have to continue pandering to our right wing base and you can't get much more base than them.
Isn't that even shock us? No, it's not incredible at all, it's very credible, they're heartless evil people.
Yeah, this is compassionate conservatism. Oh man, I hate to see what happened if they were much of hard asses, you know what?
Right, this is callous cold blooded and typical anti-human. All they know is just pandering that right wing base minute and that's all they know.
I have no life. It's pandering a bunch of religious nuts. By the way, a painful short life is nothing compared to the eternity in heaven that you will miss out on if you use those stem cells.
Oh, I see that's right, forget about that. Now is that with or without the seven virgins? That's right, that's a different book. I'm afraid I'm not right. No, in heaven you get nothing.
This article from Colin Shea who writes for Prague TV, this is long, but it's great. I'm not going to start right now, do the break first. He was a madman.
I mean, how can people this start? I'm sitting here, like I said before, this idea that we can believe things. Yeah, I have to look at everything with 50 grains of salt.
If that your Morton shakers sitting right there have to be shaken because this revisionist history that we get fed that we get spoon fed is such garbage.
And of course, now with the power of television to brainwash the masses instantly. I mean, all they got to do is change the caption on there. Oh, and a racquetack. No, now it's operation Iraqi freedom. No, now it says something else.
And the public says, oh, yeah, that makes sense to me like that poor tragic guy that called about an hour ago there. That was so sad. I made you want to cry.
Oh, the news media you just do you know what to believe? Yeah. Right. If we could have prevented 9 11 by torturing Mohammed Ata, the fact that a matter is we knew we knew him. We knew who he was. We had this picture. We had him. Right. He wasn't an Iraqi. Oh, I'm sorry.
And let me say it again to anybody who has any doubts the Saudis are the triggers in a wood pile. Okay. The sand triggers in a wood pile make no mistake about that. The Saudis don't try to deflect it. Don't try to change it. The bushes and the bin Laden's man the sound of a house of sod that connection. That's where you need to be looking sticking in those in real real deep. The Carlisle group all of these things.
All those Saudis that they flew out of here like man like they had wings. They couldn't get them out of here fast enough after 9 11. So what the other Iraqi people after the 9 11. What do they have to do with spreading terrorism around the world?
Oh, and what are we doing at the story about the poll? Don't tell me I forgot that one too. Geez. I'm slipping man. Am I old age? I think I've read that too. How about the Saudi poll? I'm oh, didn't I put that on our website? Please, please come here during the huh? We've got to better get you some stem cells. Oh, brother.
Laura said no, not for that old bag. No, seriously. I mean that was that story about the Saudi the poll of the Saudi people. Here's the one about genital cutting losing signs of favor in Africa.
You can't just see that. Did you read it? Yeah. Oh, well. But where is that story about that poll in Saudi Arabia where more than 50% of the people maybe I forgot to print it out because we had so much crap going on here. They so much stuff to put on there.
More than half of the Saudis in a poll taken recently think that Osama bin Laden is a great leader.
And I can hear what the percentage was, but it was more than half would like to see him as leader of the country.
How do you like that? What are the world family is peeing in their pants and rightfully so they deserve to be peeing in their pants?
Josh Beckett might don't even want to go there. How do you like that? He said he wouldn't wash with the best of them. Whatever they got.
Did nobody say Josh? Yeah, something like that. He's heading to rather wash with the oil they got. That's what we ought to be washing our hands in that Saudi oil.
We ought to be up to our neck in oil. We ought to have to be paying like 20 cents a gallon. A nickel a gallon like the Iraqis are doing.
Instead of letting this royal families bunch of grave robbers these Saudis. And is it any wonder that over 50% of their country loves Osama bin Laden?
Since they're the ones who started all these madrasas, all of these Wahabi wasabi, with these Wahabi instructions teaching their kids to hate the West, to hate anybody who isn't one of their Muslim fundamentalists.
That's their whole brand of education. That's what they're all about. They preach all of that crap while they're busy living a good life with all those billions of dollars in oil money that we're funneling over there to them.
Not to mention all the proceeds from all the land that they bought up here and all over the stinking damn world. The damn world.
Just like in that scene from network, man, we talked about the Saudi deal. They're also calling the White House. We want the Saudi deal. Stop now. It's all true. It's all true.
And if there was any country we should have been invading and very quietly, because it wouldn't take much with them. I'll tell you that right now. Real quietly. Like in the middle of the night. Guess what? We're taking over. You're out.
Turning your tunic at the counter and get lost. Ghost air pumping gas.
In fact, most of those schmata heads over there that are running that country, they're not even qualified to pump gas. They're too busy pumping each other from what I hear or apple. They're pumping ethyl.
And she's not too happy about it. 1241 at 560 WQM if your hair is gone to have on a hand vask. In fact, if your hair is just on a way out, nobody wants that beast look.
Absolutely.
And nobody wants that beast look and peace. Absolutely.
And the top of your head, man, people just follow all of themselves laughing their ass off when they see one of those phony pieces.
Like Aaron Brown, you can spot that muskrat a million miles away. And the mowmice to well. What's there to say about that?
The less said the better. Absolutely.

We could chase and round forever with our tanks and all our troops.
But special forces are so tired of jumping through them who's.
You don't need another plane.
So let's cut out all the nonsense and go blow up Pakistan.
All right. Now quit and ease the nuclear tank.
Oh, why don't we stop pussyfoot and blow up Pakistan?
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
Publicize one more.
1246-560 WDQM. Here's a fact from Gary who says like that one year pool.
We don't want to forget about that pool of businesses that you hate. Albrechtens says I have a publics in an Albrechtens near my house.
And while back we had a big rain storm and a parking lot in public got flooded out.
So I had to go to Albrechtens. It was by far the most disgusting groceries to have ever seen.
This is a great line. They make when Dixie look good enough to eat off the floor.
Wow. I think we just read the ultimate shot. Are you ready for that or what?
Yeah, I know. What can you say?
I just emailed Eric another story that I found by accident while I was searching for a thing about that Saudi pool about the Bush, George W. Bush and the Bin Laden's man.
It's I. It's long. So I just emailed the Eric. Put it on there. Whatever you feel like it. Eric whenever you're through making all that money.
Colin Shea and the prog TV rights about Reagan. He was a madman.
Ronald Reagan is dead and the world is nowhere soft for it. At the best of times he was an ineffectual dunce.
At the worst, he was a dangerous madman who threatened humanity's very survival. He destroyed any residual respect for the presidency left over from Nixon.
His moral predecessor. He created unprecedented deficits while simultaneously gutting the principles of the New Deal and the Great Society.
He presented over a white house famously unable to govern properly because of his abysmal ignorance and tolerance of a Byzantine mess of corrupt internal fight thief.
His endless rotation of advisors with a contemptible assortment of thieves, quacks, hypocrites and imbicils who regularly broke the law of the land, lied changelessly to Congress and the American people and hopelessly ensnared themselves in ugly webs of shady and illicit dealings.
Reagan claimed to be leading a conservative revolution but he left the presidency with America mired in death, more authoritarian, militarized and centralized than ever before,
and with a foreign policy that was the life stock of the civilized world. It was a morning in America but the dawn was black indeed. A black dawn where Christian greed was celebrated over comic compassion where a family man could now walk out of church and taught a homeless family, securing the knowledge that their property was their own fault.
A black dawn where a lie repeated five times could become a simple truth, a black dawn where the attorney general could commit crime after crime without consequence, where the national security adviser could sell weapons to terrorists in order to finance more terrorists, where be grade science fiction movie served as policy papers and see grade far served as the script for governance in the halls of power of the mightiest nation the world is ever known.
As I write the men as being canonized as a saint by the press and the political establishment, the bright moments are being recalled, the fall of the Soviet Union, the monumental arms reduction treaties, the resurgence of conservatism as a credible political philosophy.
These stupendously dangerous evil empire days of the early 1980s when as a child, I lay in quivering fear of imminent nuclear emulation are conveniently forgotten.
The astonishing case of White House amnesia sing during the Iran country hearings is mostly topic non-grata. That's a pity since I would enjoy sing rerun footage of a smoke-weat, imperturbable poindexed or murmuring cryptic non-responses like some sort of delphic oracle and edmese hissing and spitting and snarling like a disemboweled jackal.
Together they managed to say I don't know 524 times in seven days of collective testimony and reprise of every college student's worst classroom humiliation nightmares.
My name Nicaraguan Harbers of violation of federal law and inactive war is nowhere mentioned. Michael Devers indictment on multiple counts of perjury is just an elf footnote as our Paul Thayer is years in the pen for obstructed justice.
I doubt there'll be speculation as to whether William Casey was fortunate to croak when he did thus being spared the ignominy of being frog marched out of the CIA headquarters and handcuffs.
Elliott Abrams, one of the darlings of the current administration will probably not be seen acknowledging that misleading Congress may have been a mistake, not to mention misplacing $10 million which mysteriously ended up in a Swiss bank account instead of financing central American debt squads like it was supposed to.
I doubt we'll see edmese puditive attorney general claiming that the Supreme Court does not set the Supreme Law of the land or James White blightfully stating during his confirmation hearing that conservation ought not to be a priority since he didn't know how many generations we can count on before the Lord returns.
Not to mention Alexander, hey gripping the podium lukin and fetamine crazed baboon screaming at reporters that he was in charge after the assassination attempt on Reagan was this good or what it's good.
Then there's George senior toasting Ferdinand Marcos for his adherence of democratic principle and processes when he wasn't being forced out forced to fire practically his entire campaign staff amid allegations of anti-Semitism he was dishing it out himself.
I hope I stand for anti-abigotry anti-Semitism anti-racism. He also wanted to be remembered for a complete and total ban on chemical weapons their destruction forever though it's more likely he'll be remembered for casting several time-breaking senate votes to resume production of nerve agents.
After the USS Vincent Blue and Iranian airliner out of the sky killing nearly 300 people he set the standard for accepting responsibility in that in future Republican administrations with his memorable howl.
I will never apologize for the United States. I don't care what the facts are.
The Reagan revolution looked as though it was on a way to becoming a Nixon SP asco by 1986 countless members of the administration were languishing in prison fleeing to perigway or being consumed in the toxic flames of rand contra.
Even the chittering rats of the Republican own senate had to abandon all duchess leaking ship of state over South Africa when he started yammering about how they've eliminated the segregation we once had in our country.
They say a person's character is defined by the company he keeps and Reagan's gamut of buddies from Edmiste Ferdinand Marcos to the savage apartheid enforces of South Africa did the man no favors.
Those who say that the unjustifies the mean that these criticisms pale into indignificance next to the achievement of winning the Cold War and toppling the Berlin Wall like Ahmed Chalabi is one of the great heroes in error.
But tough to use and it rings howl equally howl always Chalabi's like who say in the rack the first in Soviet B. M. Roth was crippled crippled husk by the 1980s already in death throws.
The best that can be said for Reagan is that may he have slightly accelerated demise and worse they may have veered crazily close to nuclear holocaust and wrecked the American economy for no reason at all.
It wasn't Reagan who won the Cold War for America but Stalin. As with so much of his career Reagan was just an empty vessel acting out of script written long before.
Some say it's cool and needless to assault the legacy of a crippled old man who ultimately wanted the best for his nation but the spear him this would be to show compassion he never demonstrated himself.
Time and time again he insisted the homeless somehow wanted to sleep on sidewalk grates that the poor the hungry the indigent were there because of their own laziness.
In the strange refracted light of Reagan's black dawn soup kitchens were full because eating food there is easier than paying for it.
His $155 billion deficit was the result of some demonic collusion between Congress and the press.
A gaggle of drugs, mugglers and assassins in the Nicaragua in jungle were the moreland equivalent of the founding fathers and trading arms for hostages that the same people who had just killed hundreds of Marines in Beirut was somehow inexplicably something completely other.
No one including the vice president the presidential spokesman could say exactly what it was but it sure wasn't that.
Truth be told I could forgive the old man all of this but what I'll never forgive him is that in spite of all of this in the face of overwhelming evidence that he should have been run out of town like a syphiletic dentist.
He left office with the highest approval ratings of any president ever leaving aside Roosevelt croaking in the arms of his mistress in a hot tub God bless the old man's lurcharous soul.
The true crime in sconce within the sastanishing bit of black magic with the genesis of the monstrous creature that is the modern Republican party.
It's been morning in America ever since Reagan's genial smile flooded our living rooms with warmth 25 years ago and our minds have steadily softened in tandem with his.
Joe six pack fervently believes that if he just lands that third job or gets the right break that Hummer will soon be his.
The blacks of all conveniently been turned into felons and thrown off the voter rolls hundreds of billions will wash through the Pentagon and a grotesque charade of Kony capitalism and whenever the anemosir plus builds up too high we go and find some pathetic
regid excuse for a country to bomb the smithereens so we can plant the flag in the smoldering ruins and congratulate ourselves on transplanting democracy.
Bush to is Reagan redux in its most awful sense the ball face lies without any hope or even attempt for justification is a surveillance a simple press a public which forgives and forgets and yes even loves while their leaders deliver powerful kicks to their genitals again and again.
Cross-eyed apocalyptic madman once again roam the halls of power while slimy political hacks sharpen hook knives in back rooms both had to make obligatory pilgrimages the Bob Jones University to kneel at the altar of Nixon's southern strategy and claim.
All know it's not about racism at all. It's about states rights and religious freedom nudged nudge wink wink. Catherine did you finish scrubbing the Florida voter rolls yet.
The same well-known policy apparatus is in place once more Bush's blind man in the room full of deaf people is today's equivalent of Reagan generating policy ideas from trashy sci-fi novels.
Don Quixote, silky at windmills had nothing on these guys just as Reagan was prepared to throw away a decade of arms control for the sake of his non-existent space lasers. Bush insist on implementing a non-functioning missile shield to defend against a non-existent missile threat.
Reagan's doomed American medical students and Cuban military airfields on Grenada set the stage for the desert mirage of Iraqi WMD and whether it's around country or oboe grade that's a cause of an in rage congressional scrutiny both Reagan and Bush had the sense to hunker down in the undisclosed location in shrug.
Hey, don't look at me. I'm just a present. These guys don't tell me anything. But for all of that Reagan even had some limits. He funded non non-killing death squads from El Salvador to South Africa.
But he even he couldn't stomach aerial sheroan tearing through Lebanon and engineering made for TV massacres of women and children.
But he set the stage for those who could and now the hard boys are back in the saddle calling all the shots.
Sheroan can wait and blood if he wants while the American people sit back and right checks to pay for the bulldozers squashing peace activist and raising refugee camps.
Ronald Reagan was not a great man. He was a dangerous and incompetent president who brought dishonor and disgrace to his office in his country.
The adulation and reverence being heaped on him today isn't of seen a front to truth history and the millions who are worse off today because of him.
The modern Republican party's new muscular conservatism with its nutty imperial dreams, voodoo economics, a worldwide gulag archipelago, content for the constitution and the rule of law and blind and bubbly ignorance of fact and history is his creation.
And so in this time of crisis we must not let our memory of Reagan be shrouded in sentimentalism and glory.
He takes with him to his grave, inelectable responsibilities that he would never accept during his tenure or indeed in his life.
The seats he sewed so long ago come to monstrous fruition.
Let us use this poignant moment not to create a false none worthy idol in the pantheon of American democracy but to carefully consider how we'd come to this dreadful past and whether and how we may yet turn back.
What a great article for a Prague TV by Colin Shea.

Anyway, there was a word in that last story, which I always try very hard,
because Marine Dowd is the one that usually scoops me up with words that I never heard of before.
There was a word toward the end of the story,
ineluctible responsibilities who would never accept during his tenure.
He takes to his grave, ineluctible.
I have no idea what that means.
Do it on me.
And I was going to look it up.
I'll do it during the next break.

Scientific Methody, Loads President.
What a Ronald Reagan's great desires was to have an anti-demistal defense that would knock everything out of the sky
from a fly to a huge missile.
He has left us with George Bush, who is also sure can work.
Explanations of this defense were best explained by the late Columbia Psychics Professor, I.I. Rabie.
Psychics.
I beg your pardon?
Did you say psychics?
Did I say psychics?
You did.
Physics, Professor.
I was thinking of Nancy.
Come on, be sure of all the compassion will you please.
I was thinking of Nancy.
Psychics, Physics, Professor, I.I. Rabie.
Rabie.
Rabie.
He came out of Hopkins in Avenue in Brownsville in Brooklyn.
In his first years in grammar school, he collected scraps of wire and used the developer radio.
He was a man small only in size who used to sit on Riverside Rabbit, occasionally a bar stool at the old Castellos on 44th Street and talk about anything he had on your mind.
He was a Nobel Prize winner for his work on the MRI.
During WWII, he was at MIT working on a sonar that was to cover the ocean with the bodies of dead German submarine sailors.
Then he would say nothing to his wife and leave the house and take long train trip to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where he lived in secrecy and was the consulting engineer in the first atomic bomb.
He won the pool on the size of the first explosion ever of an atom bomb.
He was a psychic physics professor.
He was white eyes and hour science advisor after that he came to Columbia as a prize physicist, which is how he got to Riverside Drive and Castellos on his 44th Street.
One afternoon he spoke of the Star Wars missile defense that Ronald Reagan then president urine for so earnestly.
Don't get private old man of his dream, Rabie.
He said, let him have it.
You mean the thing works? He was asked?
Yes, I'll tell you exactly how.
A baseball pitcher is on the mound. He has the ball on his hand. You have to shoot the ball out of his hand at the instant of release.
You can't shoot it before that and you can't shoot it after he's released the ball. You must shoot at the instant of release.
So the pitcher stands there and holds the ball and you're looking at him and ready to shoot.
And the pitcher stands still forever and you watch him until you go crazy.
We spend our money on it. It has Russia crazy. I know the scientists there. They know it's nuts.
But the generals come up and say America is spending huge amounts of money on it. They must know something. We better catch up.
Oh, catch up. Isn't that a vegetable? Yes. Oh, no, that was Reagan. It was the vegetable.
That is the same system that Reagan's inheritor George Bush advocates so strongly today.
We've tested our missiles and they've hit nothing. Still we spend and work on them. They enchanted Reagan.
So George Bush and her order is enthralled with the glorious experiment of technology that with the enthusiasm of the unwashed.
He hurls as the answer perhaps is early next week to the most diabolical of enemies.
Among the crowded streets of Washington Heights and there are two lines of grammar school kids coming out of a church which I recognize is Saint Elizabeth's where I've attended a funeral.
That was when they buried a marine named Ryan A. Taheda dead in Iraq.
It was there because George Bush's administration showed the nation a great scientific fact that the worst weapon of mass destruction is a lie told by government officials.
Sodom who's saying had weapons of mass destruction ready to use against us any moment now.
They told to the country in every way they told that from the White House where Bush made a state of the Union address scaring us all to the United Nations where George tenants at the on colon pile who said see these two trucks in the photographs.
There are rackies moving weapons of mass destruction. The pictures were frauds. They had been taken two weeks apart and inspected by the United Nations man Hans Blix.
Paul today explains it is being muddled by the CIA or something like that. He was my vote for the first non-white president, Paul.
Today I want him to quit as he should have months ago.
Inside this church at the hottest funeral the New York mayor Bloomberg got up and continued to lie saying that they had a died because of trying to locate weapons of mass destruction.
It was a falsehood issue without a thought because the president Bush said so and it is so and Bloomberg doesn't have the sense to stay clear of Bush a low IQ stumbling around science.
People get killed because of this a huge street sign at 180th and St. Nicholas red.
There were selling clothes and trumps and music shouted from stores and two doors in from the avenue was a display of four lighted candles and a milk box and color pictures of Tejada posted on the wall alongside the doorway.
Few on the busy street spoke English nobody knew what the pictures stood for to be known. You must be on television. Then a woman said as she walked by 51 fifth floor that she remembered Tejada's apartment number paid him a high honor.
How do you like that Jimmy Brezlin?
You go quite huh?
You'll not quite as good as that other article but no but nothing's going to be as good as that.
Of course that was on Prague TV when you see it on American TV. I don't think so. I don't think you'll be hearing any commentators are given up the comment here on American TV.
Ivan Castro writes Reagan legacy as a dark side in Latin America. This is for Reuters.
Managua Nicaragua. Ronald Reagan is drawing glowing praise worldwide since his death but in Central America many remember the former US president is a quote or radical who support for right wing leaders and rebels caused tens of thousands of lives.
The impoverished countries of Central America erupted in violence in the 80s when Reagan was president and his administration spent millions of dollars in vicious civil wars.
In the name of fighting communism in America's backyard Reagan supported country rebels against the revolutionary send an East of government in Nicaragua and help prop up repressivators that faced leftist insurgencies in El Salvador and Guatemala.
Since Reagan's death on Saturday the reaction in Central America has been mixed.
We don't celebrate any death but we must be honest we're not starting now the president Reagan respected international law that he treated Nicaragua well.
We're not going to lie said Daniel Ortega is sent an East of president led Nicaragua during the war against the Congress.
Miguel de Soto the former sent an East of foreign Mr. added there's not the least out that president Reagan did Nicaragua much harm and caused many deaths.
An estimated 300,000 people died in Central America civil wars about half during Reagan's two terms in office.
Many were civilians tortured and murdered by army troops or death squads linked to armed forces that received heavy US support human rights groups say that torture and murder stuff ain't brand new is it?
No.
Abu Gharr Raib
A lot of extremely nasty things were going on and the Reagan administration really defended and even actively supported some of the war human rights violators in the hemisphere said Daniel Wilkinson of human rights watch in New York.
Reagan sent to America policy him under criticism at home when the Iran conference scandal unfolded exposing US secret sales of arms to Iran to help fund the Congress for bid in specifically by the US Congress.
There was no issue and probably has been the issue since Vietnam that has divided the American public in Congress more than the Reagan administration policy in Central America said Russell Crandall at the US based console on foreign relations.
Reagan did not create the crisis in Central America the San Anises seized power and revolution once before he took office.
El Salvador was already falling into chaos and Guatemala Civil War been going on for two decades.
The critics said his hard line against communism killed off any hopes for negotiated settlements polarized the region and fed violence.
Ronald Reagan's name is linked to the darkest dictatorships in the history of Guatemala said Mario Polanco who heads a group set up by families of many who died.
Reagan does have admirers in the region who say his tough stance halted the communist threat ultimately brought democracy is 1983 invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada to house the Marxist government and rescue standard Americans was very popular.
Nicaragua and President and Mickey Bolano said Reagan was a great defender of Nicaragua's return to democracy and all Nicaraguan's who believe in democracy recognize that legacy.
And El Salvador president Tony Soca said Reagan helped the company in its most difficult moments.
Allies say the proof is in the ballot box since the end of the region's civil wars voters have repeatedly elected conservative pro-Washington governments.
The region however remains sharply divided in the leftist leaders that went to war with the West back forces in Nicaragua and El Salvador still pull in more than 35% of the national vote.
Following all these things kind of a mixed bag mostly negative. Yeah, Ronnie Reagan which you never get from this falling in sanded it goes on on CNN and MSNBC and Fox Nazi news just round the clock 24 7 baby all Reagan all the time.
And I realize you're not supposed to speak ill of the dead but for number one he was dying for 10 years and for number two when it go this far overboard in one direction it needs to be a little counterbalance.
You know what I'm saying and our little corner of the world. Yeah, and it's fun and tasty. Yeah, that's right.

You started movies, became president, and then you turned into a tree.
We held up our socks with garter as like a big name.
I'm here just grabbing facts.
That's all right. Just relax.
We're gonna be a peggy.
I knew it was ending, I saw it.
So I looked up ineluctable, which I've actually there.
How many people do you think know what that word means?
Third man.
Talking about our audience, I think in the entire world.
Is it anything like?
Ineluctable means inevitable, not to be uploaded or escaped.
I thought it was so real like, delectable.
Oh.
They had a Florida's elections division resign Monday.
They admitted reports he was feeding political heat over a push to purge thousands of suspected felons
From the state voter rule, the Sun Sentinel says.
The same Pete Times notes that Florida's 67 election supervisors
Or at the annual conference are feeding the pressure of intense public scrutiny, thank God,
That increases as another closely fought presidential election draws near.
The rest of the country seems convinced that Florida will screw it up again and believe you me, if anybody can, we will.
If anybody's got all the experience to do it, if anybody knows how to do it, we can do it, man.
We're the little, uh, penis shaped state that could.
Anyway, here's a fact from somebody's obviously p-oated Walgreens.
Probably this person works in records.
I guess.
What's the other one is it C-S?
C-V-S.
C-V-S.
This is C-V-S.
Oh, that's right. C-V-S.
And they're open 24 hours and they're all over the place.
They're popping up, right?
And they're right.
Nice car.
Are they really?
Yeah.
They are.
Well, I'm partial to Walgreens because I have that one right nearby where I live.
And I like two.
And number two is a fine store.
They got whatever I want.
They're, uh, they're open 24-7 now.
And what's not to like?
I just like to store.
And they're not on the other hand, I despise.
Anyway, this one says.
What gives Walgreens the right to be on every court in America?
It seems that they've taken the place as the drug dealers.
Well, that's one of the things they sell as drugs.
It's very scary.
Walgreens is secretly trying to take over the world and crush any other pharmacy in their
plant like a drug dealing gang.
It's also very scary taking my film there.
Something I'll never do again.
They put up a great front with their new shiny stores, although it's a shini here.
Shiny stores, but with the huge spread of stores across the country,
knowledge there is very, very thin.
Whatever that means.
Film processing?
Yeah.
It's going to be pretty smart to put your thing in there,
put your name on it, envelope, and stick it in the thing and send it off to where they do it.
Still processing film, the old fashioned way, are they?
No, sure.
They're not going to go out and get no digital camera stuff like that.
Are you crazy on everything now, though?
No, no, no.
They're not going to do that in the amount of vending machines.
Nah, you can't do that.
Even on your pop-up toast, you can take pictures of the bread.
Walgreens on the inside, frying.
In fact, in a Ronnie's casket, what else bad?
That's terrible.
Well, I still think it's an empty casket.
I don't think he's in there.
Yeah.
I agree.
Fine, this doesn't make sense to you.
What if some wine test goes up there and tries to pop the thing open?
I mean, you know, he's going to be like, remember the eye tolo fall out of the helicopter?
Yeah, that's fine.
Not good.
Anyway, Norma Kent, in fact, me this earlier, or email this earlier,
while the rest of the nation mourns the death of Ronald Reagan,
this is his legacy to me, his Norma.
Although AIDS was first reported in the medical and popular press in 1981,
it was only October 87, as two years after Rock Hudson died,
that President Reagan ever even publicly spoke about the epidemic.
By the end of that year, 59,572 AIDS cases have been reported,
and 27,900 of those women and men had died.
How could this happen?
How could Reagan not say anything through all these years of death and spreading disease,
affecting so many gay Americans?
In practical terms, Reagan's long sums, men AIDS research, was chronically underfunded.
When doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute for Health
asked for more funding for their work on AIDS, they were routinely denied it.
Between June of 1981 and May of 1982, the CDC spent less than a million dollars on AIDS,
but nine million dollars on Legionnaires' disease.
At that point, over 1,000 of the 2,000 AIDS cases reported resulted in death.
There were fewer than 50 deaths from Legionnaires' disease.
This drastic lack of funding would continue through the Reagan years.
When health and support groups in the gay community integrated education and prevention programs,
or instigated those programs, they were denied federal funding.
In October of 1987, Jesse Helms back with Reagan's support
demanded a federal appropriation bill that prohibited AIDS education efforts
that encouraged or promoted homosexual activity that is telegay men how to have safe sex.
Throughout all of this, Ronald Reagan did nothing.
When Rock Hudson, a friend and colleague of the Reagan's, was diagnosed and died in 1985,
one of almost 21,000 cases reported that year, Reagan still did not speak out.
When family friend William H. F. Buckley in March 1918,
1819-16 New York Times article, said that HIV plus a positive gay men should have this information,
forcibly tattooed on their buttocks, Reagan said nothing.
In 1986, after five years of complete silence,
when Surgeon General C. Everett Cooper released a report calling for AIDS education in schools,
Bennett and Howard did everything possible to undercut and prevent funding
for COOP's two little two-layed initiative.
By the end of 1986, 37,000 AIDS cases had been reported over 16,000 people had died.
The most memorable Reagan AIDS moment was that the 1986 cemetery reded occasion of the Statue of Liberty.
The Reagan's were there sitting next to the French Prime Minister in his wife, François and Daniel Mitterrand,
Bob Hope was on stage, entertaining the All-Star audience.
In the middle of a series of one-liders, Hope Quipped,
I just heard that the Statue of Liberty has AIDS,
but she doesn't know if she got it from the mouth of the Hudson or the Staten Island Ferry.
As the television camera panned the audience, the Mitterrand's looked appalled,
the Reagan's were laughing.
By the end of 1989, 115,786 women and men have been diagnosed with AIDS in the U.S.,
more than 70,000 of them had died.
We've learned today through research science and the process of medicine that AIDS can be controlled and contained.
The great communicator, the right wing and the churches he supported next to nothing
to facilitate this process or enhance those discoveries or promote this research.
This is the legacy he leaves to the thousands of aid victims whose graves are marked by a silence.
I heard on the news this morning that we're being encouraged to overlook the occasional shortcomings or gaps
and focus on the accomplishments of Reagan's life.
I find the death of hundreds of thousands of human beings damn hard to overlook, can you?
The point is that Ronald Wilson Reagan took an oath to defend and protect the people of the United States,
gay or straight, black or white, well or ill.
An honest review tells us he could have done better,
and if we had the courage to own up to a present success and his failures,
Mr. Reagan failed when it comes to fighting a disease that still spreads across the world today with frightening breath.
Who knows where he might have been today if Reagan had launched the battle when he had the chance to do so a quarter of a century ago.
Pretty good stuff, Norm. Excellent. Good job.
By the way, Norm Kent's on Saturday in some August station again now.
Does anybody care? No. I just thought I mentioned it.
Well, he wanted me to mention it. What do you feel about the fight?
What's that? I don't know the station.
The light bulb junior, I don't know. I have no idea. Is it that 14 hundred thing?
You're not asking me, right?
I'm asking, I'm asking Josh.
I'm sure Josh listens a lot to the Joyce Kaufman show and all of that stuff, right?
All the door Riley. Don't you, in your spare time?
Oh, yeah. Probably taking notes.
In fact, Josh, I'll probably start putting some of his own bedtime stories on the website pretty soon once we turn that over.
Keys are the kingdom over to him once Eric stops being such a hard-ass.
I mean, I didn't say that, did I? Come on, Eric. Turn those keys over to Josh doing to help a job.
Okay, we didn't get him that computer so we can sit around and look at all kinds of crap on there.
All right. All we probably is all kinds. Well, but what retail, but not like Beaner Boy though, but we don't want to go into that.
What retail place in South Florida? Do you hate the most? Like I said, Walmart, 192.
Believe me, when Dixie 142, Brands, Mark 72, Eckerd 72. Read it. Watch yourself.
Radio Shack 36, K-Mart 34. Rooms to go is God.
But turn it man. Maybe it was Josh.

Don't forget author TD Alman, whose latest book, Rogue State, a murky at war with the world would be in Crowgables on Thursday, June 10th.
That sounds like tomorrow at 6 p.m. at Books and Books. 265, Ergon Avenue. He'll discuss his work, hold a question and answer session as well as sign copies of his book.
It's a paperback at his excellent. He's also author of Miami City of the Future, a highly respected book,
which was the best seller in Florida for more than three years. He'll be there in the Gables tomorrow night at 6 p.m. at Books and Books.
And Woody Graber will be there and go there and say, hey, Woody, look at that. Get a haircut.
Speaking of people in South Florida, more OJ controversy says the Sun Sentinel. No.
We've port circulated on Tuesday that OJ Simpson's attorney had saw cash as a condition for interviews on NBC Fox News Channel and court TV.
Executives at ABC and CBS yesterday confirmed that he'll go Lanter.
Simpson's attorney had approached the respective networks about interviews, though different slightly on what conditions have been set.
According to one scenario reported in the New York Post, the Miami-based attorney reportedly sought to be retained as a consultant for 100 grand, thus circumventing network pay for play rules.
And an ABC News spokesman said yesterday, a Glender pitch was rejected that was outside our standards. A CBS spokeswoman declined the comment.
In a phone interview, Glender disputed the post reports on ABC's contention that he had approached them. They're full of Schmidt.
And you can quote me on that, he said. Each network request in the interview, we added saying that Katie Kourik, whose interview aired Friday, was chosen because she brings an incredible amount of credibility and stature.
An NBC News spokeswoman said NBC News did not and never will pay for an interview.
Anyone who says otherwise is clearly disappointed that they got scooped. A Fox News Nazi News spokeswoman, a letter that not one dying was paid, and that Glender had been a frequent guest on Greta Van Sustern Brown's show.
Where Simpson was interviewed. And you know the good news about all of that? What's that? With him appearing all over the place. I never saw one second of it.
Oh, you know me either. All right. Josh, you any of it? Now, all right. Excellent. There you go. No, OJ for us. We'll leave that to SCRUAN.
The Water Nazi. Greg, all of his other sickle fans around the QM building, all those other jock sniffers. Oh, OJ, OJ, we love you, OJ.
In fact, you know something I'm thinking that maybe SCRUAN and the Water Nazi. Well, nevertheless, I don't want to go into that. Maybe OJ can pay them a visit.
5670560, pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. What retail place in South Florida? You hate the most. Not only been what about 50 hours since I took that last call.
I think that guy just kind of like soured me on calls for a. Oh, he was. He want to make me cry. That's typical. Yeah, WQAM. Hello.
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, it's Robert. I've asked you this morning or George that link to that. Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
You're the one. Well, thank you. Profusely. That's the best. Oh, well, thank you for that. Where did that come from? I found it on a site called fun.org.
PHUN, six little point of sight or something. But anyway, I found the link there. And as well on there, there's a link for Bushgame.com. I don't know if you've seen this bush game, but that's.
Is that I think that's related to that Dave game.com. Well, I don't know. Yeah, probably on the web. Anyway, put my vote in for Walmart.
I hate them profusely like poison and I would ban from one in Palm Harbor. So, why is that? Well, a little situation once when I went in there to buy some led
additive for my old car and an antique car and didn't want to sell to me. Oh, there's this law and this and that. And I got an argument with the manager and this guy and I was about 16 at the time.
So he's asking me for my ID and I was 16, 17 forms, my shoe size, so security number.
What other words you had to be of a certain legal age to buy led additive for the gas land in my car? What are those?
What are those? They're Nazis. But I can go anywhere else. Auto parts store discount here there and no problem whatsoever.
I guess you learned your lesson and go any place else. Any place else. Thanks a lot Rob. Thanks for all the good stuff.
I'll hang up on it and put him on the head. Hold on. Okay. He wanted my email because he's going to send more stuff, which is good. Great. Oh, excellent. This guy finds more stuff like that.
If you haven't looked at that picture today of John Ascroff, man, he would be foaming at the mouth to see that for somewhere. Wow. I probably at the back. Yeah. I hear he's got a problem.
Wait till you see that collage of naked flesh. Yeah. You can follow. Looking at all the little polywitches combines to make the push of John Ascroff.
In fact, he probably like to get that drape that cloth to like cover it over with that whole thing. Watch cloth. WQA Am hello.
Hi, now I know. Yes sir. Great. Just wanted to ask if you hear Jeff Greenfield that it's a good thing that Reagan died when he did.
Otherwise you'd have to hear about OJ all week long. I like that line. That was just about time he came up with something good. Okay, he got the good work. Thanks. Love you. That is a good lines for Jeff Greenfield.
He usually has absolutely nothing to say on these certainly not news network, but that's pretty good. Good thing Reagan died so we didn't have to be in the day with OJ. See you're out of stage again. OJ. Nobody cares about your sorry old ass. Okay.
Whether it's real dark black like time, magazine made it or kind of like mocha. Nobody cares in your daughter hates you like poison and you're a real slime ball. Nobody's fooling anybody murdering piece of turd.
Even mad dog you turn to want to be a concerning with you. WQA Am hello. There's that thing again. Yeah. Just makes you kind of wonder line nine. We know who that is. WQA Am hello.
What is it? Okay. Thank you. It was him. WQA Am hello. Hi Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I've been going. I saw I thought it was not on P&N today that they're thinking about naming the Pentagon after Reagan. Yes, that's correct.
Thank you. Oh, my God. And we're going to name every street in America after Reagan to the Reagan drive Reagan Parkway, Reagan Avenue, Reagan Uranus. Everything's going to be renamed after Reagan.
Oh, that's from the guy. Thanks. Welcome to Reagan world, pal. Five six seven O five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. We thought you'd do that story about

These we want to just puke and he roll over the plate. What did you expect?
The least shut up or yeah, okay, at least don't send us an haul
So in other words if this comes to a vote and Congress in house and Senate pass it over when we he's gonna veto that is that what they're telling us
Wow
It's pretty on good
General cutting shows signs of losing favor in Africa. There are some good news. Oh man
And Sino Shuriye still remembers the price he felt years ago when she leaned over each of her three daughters
knife in hand and sliced into their genitals
Each time as the blood started to flow she quickly dropped the knife and picked up a needle and thread quickly
expertly she sold her daughters vagina's almost shut
I was full of pride she be called recently. I felt like I was doing the right thing in the eyes of God
I was preparing them for the marriage by sealing their vaginas
Now she feels like a butcher a sinner a mother who harmed her own flesh and blood not to mention the thousands of other girls
She says she circumcised in the last quarter of a century as part of a traditional right still common in Africa by the way
Slightly
General cutting is losing favor. It's losing its grip
Parliaments are passing laws forbidding the practice which causes widespread death and death and this figure
When girls are fleeing their homes to keep their vaginas intact wouldn't you?
Yeah, I had one and the women who have been curing out the cutting and who have been revered by the communities for doing so every game to lay down their knives
Remember that's all by the court. That's lay down your knives. No, it wouldn't
Miss a vegetable cabrindas
Miss Shury a not only mother of eight is known far and wide in northeastern Kenya Kenya
Can you believe it for her expertise is a genital cutter is one of them? Well, what do you do for living? I'm a genital cutter
The gentle genital cutter
When local members of woman kind Kenya a grassroots group opposing the practice visited Miss Shury is hot outside
Garisa two years ago. She chased him off her property
This was something her mother had done before she started as an apprentice while still an adolescent by holding down
Girls legs for her mother to perform the right which opponents call
General mutilation. I thought my mother would curse me from the grave if I didn't carry on the traditions
She said it was a tradition in the family kind of like you know with a mafia they carried on from one generation to another
The retangible benefits as well. She had pressed each and her community earned a good income more than her husband
It is a camel herder before we doubt if tuberculosis
She said she had no use for those people who came around denouncing her way of life
But her opponents were determined a lot
They knew that Miss Shury was one of the longest serving genital cutters around and that she held sway over the community
If only she could be converted they figure others would certainly follow Miss Shury a frail but feisty grandma who wraps her head in colorful smathas
Was rather sent in her ways again in the game. She refused to hear their arguments
It was so difficult to change her mind since Sophia Abdi Nour the founder of woman kind Kenya which worked with the
Ethnic Somalis who live in Kenya's rugged northeastern province and is attracted local supporters throughout the region
We knew she was respected. We wanted her on our side
Finally the anti-cutting advocates tried a different tack. They showed up with religious leaders
Miss Shury a religious Muslim could not chase them away
She sat down with some influential clerics in her community who come to the realization that the division was harmful and not dictated by her
Consistent with the teachings of the Quran
The imams denounced the practice they told her that they vagina was part of the body
Just as important in the eyes of God as an eye a finger or a limb in fact some of you guys probably think even more important
Yeah, cutting it they argued in their long session outside her home is a sin cut it out when it doubt cut it out
They went even further they told her that her sins required her compensate the girl she had maimed each of them was do 80 camels
They said but spoke is bad for you wow
each
Each of them was do 80 camels
Miss Shury a prosperous by local standards, but not that prosperous was shaken
She sobbed then she prayed finally she pleaded with the imams for a way out of her impossible situation
They said the only way to avoid paying the compensation was to seek the forgiveness of each of the girls she had cut
This is when she turned from a cutter to an active opponent
She began making house calls on the girls from an undergone or knife many of them were women now
She explained her conversion and pleaded for their forgiveness. She cried each time she said
Why did she we
Because camels are cancer sticks and they'll kill you
Especially 80 of them. I like this article
Oh, you're not gonna read anymore from capital Hill blue no less thanks again to Eric for finding that website
Man, that's great. We got a link to it now in the whole deal capital Hill blue
On the day George Tennant resigned as director of the CIA his counterpart on the domestic side
FBI director Robert Mueller was asking Congress to consider creating a new agency within his own to handle all the homeland counterintelligence
Activities
The Mueller proposal was actually offered by representative frank wolf of Virginia republic in several months ago
As a means of preserving the bureau's counterintelligence responsibilities rather than creating an entirely new agency
Pattern after Britain's MI5 which the FBI and the district department opposed for quite obvious reasons
The MI5 proposal would diminish the bureau's power and relegate it to just another law enforcement agency
Which is what primarily it is anyway wolf cheers the House appropriation subcommittee that oversees the FBI
And would lose some power and influence of the bureau's downsides. It's a good bet the FBI had a hand in hatching his plan
But as the mistakes pile up it's becoming more and more evident that the bureau may be incapable of
smoothing out its intelligence collecting wrinkles and just establish an independent
Director it for that task within and so on borders would do nothing to solve the problem
The two latest public highly publicized goofs came in a false fingerprint ID in the spanish bombing case poor guy
Setting up a new bureau within the bureau would allow Mueller once again to add to the FBI's numbers
The force already has nearly 12,000 agents and thousands technicians clerks and support personnel
Will create a bureaucracy within a bureaucracy and probably result in worse rather than better cooperation with other federal and state local agencies
After all of this crap with 9-11 and we're gonna cut that out and no more this not committing it
There's still the same thing. They're all protecting their own turf
How can you say that because it's true
Ha
Take a look at that pool what retail place in South Florida do you hate the most the spies at Walmart 208
But when Dixie are very surprisingly strong second 158 aren't you a little bit surprised?

You're going to be good for what you say here.
Oh, shit, though.
Thank you, Moe.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
Go, go.
But I have nothing else to say.
Look at that.
How about this?
How's the weather down there in the mirror, Moe?
I'm right down the street from you.
I have to go.
Oh, wait.
By the way, something.
No, I have to go.
Look, I tell you what.
I'll hold you over the break.
How's that?
I'll give you one of my old tank t-shirts.
Just that.
No, hey!
That was the only color we had.
The things on your nose is blowing again.
It's blowing, it's blowing, it's blowing.
It's blowing, it's blowing.
It's blowing.
It's blowing, it's blowing.
It's blowing, it's blowing.
Wow!
We got things with all things.
I can know that I can face.
And around those posing pimples.
You're crazy.
Wow!
Wow!
If you go look at the fear I don't see.
A road map of the obsolence.
You got your heavy sun.
Way to die, die, die, die.
Wow!
My nose glows when something steams.
Almost every day I see.
And my veins as many start to tickle.
I had the noise, the door to door is yours.
Yeah, I've pulled like a falling apart.
And my heart's all cramped in your fire.
The way that I don't get spilled with people's veins.
And in life I'm too hot to see.
And science cannot describe where we are.
I know I'm bleeding, I pull pain.
I'm bleeding, I pull pain.
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding.
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding.
Bye, bye, bye.
I'm flying, I'm flying.
You see that great looking piece of ass over there in Section 127?
Oh!
