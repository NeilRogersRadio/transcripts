It's the draft baby.
BASHA BASHA BASHA BASHA BASHA BASHA BASHA BASHA!
OW!
Sports Readiness O5C.
Telling you Q-A-M.
My Emmy Ford-Loverman.
I'm back to Georgia's all pumped up for that draft.
Oh yeah.
The Friday you best.
I miss this boring.
What's better than a live radio show every morning on TV?
Well, just about anything.
But that hasn't stopped MSNBC from teeming up with radio's original bad boy.
Who now looks like an STOV.
Listen, Bernie! I'm a skeleton internist, coffee sucks.
Yes, every morning, see, I'm a sly new tape of other people's candy myths.
Why, I'm the heir.
I need a hammer to bite into this muffin just so many of you best fresh one, please.
I can see his wild behind the scenes at it.
I am a stupid thimmy Ivan, you are the walrus cuckoca tune.
I'm getting me some fresh coffee or your fire.
I'm a sly reverent.
So, uh, what's the deal with the pulp?
He's topical.
So, uh, what's the deal with his water, Dave?
He's incoherent.
I'll tell you what, that, uh, there's a government president, what does it, uh, uh,
please, I just can't, he's going.
And he's only on MSNBC, a cable channel nobody watches, and a bunch of AM radio stations
go, but he listens to him.
I'm not somebody to get some fresh jingle.
It's Ivers.
He's something else, all right?
I don't think we can say that word on the ear, no more.
Oh, huh.
He could say it, nobody would know what he said.
Exactly.
He's a little incoherent is what it is.
And he get to be at 96.
And he's done all that substance stuff that he's done.
Yeah.
Anyway, we're picking up right where we left off yesterday, right before another
thrilling Marlins win.
They're just unbelievable.
They win just about every stinkin' Dave.
You believe that?
Every, they just, uh, you know, yeah, other than that brave series, they just don't lose
no more.
Even George is whipped up about that.
I'm in fact, I'm sure he can't figure out what he's more excited about.
The NFL draft or the Marlins?
Jesus.
Think about it.
Anyway, here's what I'm, uh, here's what we're going to do.
Who used to say that?
Tell you what I'm going to do.
Did Jimmy Durrani say that?
Somebody like that.
Anyway, tell me what I'm going to do.
Don't go blind with no.
The worst hit song, top 40 hit song of all time, is, and I'm taking the top, uh, dozen.
Any, uh, some of you got 40 or more votes yesterday?
And we'll carry those over and then we'll add to them today and then they'll be on
there all weekend long and you can't fight about it.
We got some to add to it.
That's just a little hint of one though there.
Wow.
Anyway, Aiki Breakey Heart is leading the pack 161.
Macarena 141.
You light up my life.
The anxious Debbie Boone, a hundred.
It must be a genetic thing.
Feelings 88.
Don't worry.
Be happy.
Bob Immick Ferrin, 75 also, 75.
The Baham and who let the dogs out?
Having my baby, Paul Anker, the guy with a canker, 70.
This go ducks is the one.
Ice ice baby, 51.
We built the city by Starship, 49.
Ebony and Ivory 48.
Seasons in the sun by the ridiculous Terry Jacks, 45.
Muscrat Love had 37.
Do I want to read all of these?
Oh boy.
Well, not really.
I'll just do the ones with the double digits.
I will always, oh, sorry.
Party all the time, 36.
She bangs 34.
I will always love you 24 Whitney Houston.
She blows.
Yummy, yummy, yummy 22.
Barbie Girl, 19 by Aqua, which I thought was kind of cute.
But not to you folks.
Billy, don't be here, oh, 18.
Watching Scotty grow by the very depressing terminal and ponderous, Bobby Gold's bro,
17.
Tanya L. Ribbon round, Tony Orlando's next 16.
Afternoon, the light 14, the Serpent Bird, 13.
In the year 25, 25 by Zegor and Evans, I have no idea why they don't like that.
12.
What was wrong with that song?
Nothing.
That's the worst hit song of all time.
I think I love you by the Partridge family, which took us right after the ballgame this
day, which we really were.
It was great.
In fact, let's just play it all day today.
What do you say?
Just to the guy with the eye David and the whole gang, surely.
Yeah.
Anyway, it had a dozen honey and other very syrupy depressing song by Bobby Gold's bro
and also my heart will go on 11.
My heart will go on by the very, very nauseating Celine Dion.
We're about to deport her from here, right?
Rock and roll part two, 10.
Escape the peanut coladas on.
I didn't know that it was called escape.
See, 10.
I didn't know that.
Obladi Obladi.
I said I was only going to do a double.
So that's it.
So we're taking the top dozen and then we'll add to it.
Let's see.
Before we do Cindy Crawford.
Do I do Cindy Crawford?
I'll bet.
Well, get the depressing stuff out of the way.
PFC Clayton Henson was supposed to come home from Iraq April 16th.
Instead, he was killed on April 17th when his convoy was ambushed in the D'Wania.
Henson, 20 of Texas, believed to be the first to die among the 20,000 troops whose deployment
in Iraq was extended this month and there'll be more.
Supposedly he was almost on the plane when they extended for three months at Mark Cotton,
the principal at Stanton High School in Stanton, Texas.
For him to get killed just a couple days after that cotton said his voice training off,
he was ready to come home.
He'd been there for a full year.
The young soldier's death has hit the close to Texas town of Fetha's in hard and it goes on.
But we're not supposed to talk about those things and we certainly don't want to see pictures of those caskets.
At this get a task get do not photograph those caskets.
Just remember freedom eight free I see.
Anyway, the Pentagon lost its tight control over the images of caskets returning from Iraq.
It's about 350 such images were released under the Freedom of Information Act.
And a Seattle newspaper published a similar photo taken by military contractor.
After Dover Delaware Air Force base, the main port for returning remains released hundreds of government photos of the ceremonies.
The defense department ordered Thursday that no more photos be released.
See they don't want you to see this stuff because it's bad.
It's just an up good PR because you assume that if those fly-rape caskets are coming back,
there might actually be a body in there.
In addition to employees for defense contractor Maytag aircraft were fired after the Pentagon
complained about a photo of flag-grave caskets taken by one of them appeared in the Seattle Times.
In March 2003 on the eve of the war in Iraq, the Pentagon ordered an end to all media coverage of ceremonies
for the returning remains of soldiers killed overseas.
And again, because they know what happened during the Vietnam, when a kid started coming home in body bags,
people started shrieking and screaming, this is madness, this is insanity.
They weren't going to support you no more.
And that was the beginning of the end for all of that, although it took several years.
But at least there's got to be a beginning.
But we sure don't want to show them photos.
Okay, now get into something a little more pleasant.
Cindy Crawford, now everybody, nobody don't know who Cindy Crawford is, but anyway, just in case,
Cynthia and Crawford, that's her real name.
Did you know that?
No.
Where you do now, see, I already learned something.
It was born on February 20th, 1966, that makes her 38.
Pretty old.
Indeed, now that's just a joke, in the Cal Galinois, she was discovered by a chance
by a newspaper photography photographer who noticed then 16-year-old Cindy at work during
your summer job of the tax-ling corn and took a picture of her.
That was her job.
She was the tax-ling corn.
I never heard that term in my life.
Is that like a corn shucker?
The photo and the positive feedback surrounding cities,
our photogenic towns were not to commit to the quitter day job and take up modeling.
Thanks to two summers of modeling, represented by a lead model management of Chicago,
the All-American Beauty Provedown also have brains.
She traded in a glamorous life of a model to study chemical engineering
at Northwestern University on a scholarship.
No, as a way you didn't know that.
I had no idea.
After allegedly being romantically linked to Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer,
Cindy finally became Mrs. Randy Gerber in 1998, and I'd probably enjoy that baby food.
And maybe she's feeding that baby food with her son,
Presley Walker.
That's her kid's name.
Presley Walker Gerber.
Did you say that about that?
It starts later, kids stupid things.
She graduated in the movies, albeit unsuccessfully, in 1995 film Fair Game,
co-starring Billy Baldwin.
So there's Cindy Crawford.
She's behind the Velvet Road, behind the Abedie Curtain, behind the Athenae,
behind a screen, behind that heavy duty thick screen.
And just in case you're over the age of 100 and you have plenty of idea to prove it,
you can take a peek at it real quick.
Not too long, though, because John Ascroft followed his eyes.
He's monitoring you, man.
He is watching you right now.
I tell you, he's got a great sense of humor, who's a real goofball.
Yeah.
Jim Sarni, a major mass hole.
Well, I'm so glad that we destroyed you.
I was, that was great.
I like that one.
I'll bet you do.
He's a major mass hole.
That's with an M.
He writes at the end of his marginal sports broadcast in column.
It's so sad.
It's so tragic.
Reading the Sunsetless Morning says it's good to have the crow back talking baseball on WQA.
Merit, Merit.
Merit.
Merit.
Oh, many.
Merit.
You are such a silly person, Jim.
Miss Sarni, you are just a clown.
Wow, that is tragic.
Wall Street Journal reports that the FCC is fine.
Emma's communications $42,000.
That's the Emma's.
For six alleged indecent broadcast in Chicago.
Emma's is filed administrative appeals of four of the fines totaling 28 grand
and considering is considering what I actually take for the remaining fines
according to the form 8k, whatever that is filed yesterday with the SEC.
The FCC also sent letters of inquiry related to five additional broadcasts
on the Chicago station and five broadcasts on one of the companies St. Louis stations.
These inquiries could result in additional fines rather than enforcement action for the
company.
The filing said so that's the Emma's they got tourists too.
That'll teach them to come up with an aim like that.
The Emma's.
Okay, now we're going to be adding thousands of names to this list today.
I don't know if Josh is up to it.
Can you handle it?
Yeah, I think so.
So we can, the Schmidt Canada one that's on there now, Eric.
You can just go, uh, eat several meals as a matter of fact, Eric.
You just have yourself a wonderful day.
Relax.
Everything is under control.
We've got a great link too.
I should point out where do you discover that?
Somebody, uh, give us a tip on that.
One of my mistresses emailed it to me.
No, seriously.
Okay, I'll make something up.
Oh, what a gorgeous mistresses.
I'm getting somebody.
You finally listen to her email that to me.
One of his mistresses emailed him this infotainment today.com.
And what a great website that is now I realize it's probably a little bit too long for most,
the nimble minded people out there even.
But we got the link to it right there.
It's our top link on the website right above greatplac.com.
So there's one more reason to go on there.
Just to the left of the ugly nasty looking means spirited condolese a liar.
Just to the left of her a push, there's the links.
Okay.
This infotainment today.com.
Pretty damn good site.
I'm pretty impressed.
Staying good.
WQA and hello.
Not there on our first call.
That's the moment of things to come.
I'm afraid that that's all right because when all these promos we got for all the activities going on this weekend,
all I got to do was read those about 10, 15 times we're out here just like yesterday.
That was great.
Man, oh man.
Lots more Marlon ball games is what we need starting at about the 12, maybe 12,
about 30 man.
12, 30.
That was beautiful.
And especially when the last half hours all spots.
I noticed a muffin come in and say when he was there this morning,
whining about the usual, whatever didn't say, but I was quite a job he did there with a getting those 12 minutes in
and making it almost sound like listable between 12 and 12, 30.
I noticed she didn't have that to say her own personal program director.
It was probably too concerned about what she's going to be doing in Key West this morning
this weekend, whatever she's going to do.
12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQA.

There is a vlog for section where I am talking about language.
some other promos but I'll get to them eventually. I'm not sure if I want to read yours.
You may not be with us that long. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a 18, T and T and
4 eyes on wireless line. The worst hit song, Top 40 of all time, is now we took the top
dozen from yesterday and we'll add on thousands from today. If of course the phone starts
to ring it if not, I'll just play them. How's that? Which everyone's got? I like like
that. I'm just playing that all day. And that other WDQA. I'm Hello. Why is Kiss changing
their format? You're a troublemaker, Gennel. WDQA. I'm Hello. WDQA. I'm Hello. Hey, Neil,
how's it going? All right. Let me ask you a question. Like, four years ago, I tried to get
into the Marines but they didn't want to accept me because I had a GED instead of my
school diploma. And now the recruit calls you to talk about, they'll take me now. What does
that have to do with what we're doing now? Get out of here. Get lost. Go join the Marines,
okay? Now let me ask you something. Yeah. And it just slipped my mind. It's something
very important before he called with that idiotic, with that non-sequitory. You know what I'm
saying? He's got his own agenda. Go join the Marines, okay? Be a Marine, and all the
end think you're up to it. You know what I should have told him just before I clicked
him off there. Yeah, that might have inspired him. They'd write down the recruiting office
and hop right on in. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, deep pound for own. So anyway, that group all they
called him in, they'd go, that's what I was going to say. Did the kids actually change
a format? I don't know. Oh, I remember the guy that called yesterday. I wanted to know.
We said we'd check it out for him. I mean, it should, since inside the building is the
same ownership of that radio station, even though they're in another building, shouldn't
we have some idea what's going on? No, we've got a hotline somewhere. And you're telling
me that nobody in that building knows if the kids changed their format from country to
urban. No, they don't fully. In this building, they listened to sports. Jay and Davey says,
you need to get, here's another one, giving us instructions. You need to get the call
of Mike Redmond, so I'm honest that if you haven't heard it, Dave and boring sounds lost.
Worst song nominee, here we go. Let's get back to it. Okay. Girl, you know it's true
by Millie Vanille. Oh, what a horrible song and what a horrible non-group. Girl, you know
it's true. You got it. We got it. There's one. And then let's stick this on there right
now. There's the man who put the mung in Mungo Jerry in the summertime. Got it? Good.
He got five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
WQA am hello. Neil. Yes, sir. You forgot one yesterday. What do you mean yesterday?
Well, you put it on today, I guess. That's what we're doing it now. Yesterday was just
the tease. That was just the beginning. Well, I got one. Yeah. I replied. What is it?
I realized. You realize what? That's the name of it. Bye. Bye swan package.
WQA am hello. I. These boots are made for walking by you. Oh, man, that's a good one.
Nancy Snatra. What? One of these words. Can't complain about her singing because she don't do any.
Thank you. These boots are made for walking. And that was a big hit. Could have been because the last name was Snatra.
Could it? I don't think so. Just coincidence. She five six seven oh five sixty pound five. What?
She sure could sing 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. She was almost as good as Frank Sattatra,
junior. Oh, she never got kidnapped. They'll go say anything hasty. WQA am hello. Yeah.
QA am yes, sir. Is this Neil? Sounds like me. Hey, Neil, I got one for you.
They're coming to take me away in the following the 13th. I think we didn't we put that on there.
Somebody called that in yesterday. I didn't get a chance to listen yesterday.
So I don't I don't think we put it on there. I think you just discovered one of those screw-ups.
Well, I'll take a look at it. Thanks, pal. It is on there, isn't it? I don't know.
Somebody called it in or they thanks it. I remember the facts. They're coming to take me away.
I'm looking on here and somebody didn't put it on our list. I can't imagine who that could have been.
Can you? It was just a slip-up. That's what the days for it.
It's a kind of fill in the cracks. Right. That we may have left open yesterday. We have
kind of a minor crack problem here. They're coming to take me away. You got it? Got it. Great.
Great job, guys. Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T. How many thousand of
ten thousand? Thirty thousand. Although.
All in not to be left out because if I don't do this right now we'll forget about it and we can't forget about this.
Oh yeah. Oh god.
Oh
The end alone at night makes me sad
Roy!
Yet bringing it down all right
Ha ha!
Tossing and turning and freezing and burning
I have no life
Crying all through the night
I'll leave you, leave you, leave you
You love me
Bobby Sherman!
Could he sing?
No, or what?
He couldn't sing a word of a paper
Second like Nancy Sinatra
Only just a little bit more macho, not too much
Julie, Julie, Julie, do you love me?
I don't know how many Julie's are there
Let's see, there's only one, Julie, do you love me?
You got it?
He's got it
That is embarrassing, isn't it?
Bobby Sherman, and the fact that you remember that song
What do you love the name of it?
They pounded it into our head
There you go
Although I don't think nearly as much as Mungo Jerry
I'd like to know who the hell the people were who bought those records

The whole thing better steal a lot

Yes oh good
5670 if I mean I hate to say something like that but in his case that's great
WQAM hello
Yeah I heard something about the uh
Kiss country story I didn't know if you heard yet
But it was
They haven't heard of word we're searching
Double fact tell us
It's a radio stunt um
Ah
It's a plan where the uh country artist is Keith Urban
And he'll be there Monday morning that's
That's what they were saying on Zeta this morning they were right
And then on top of the channel seven
They took the story and ran with it and produced the whole thing on the early morning news
And it was totally bogus and they said that the country was changing to urban
They put some music to it and uh
Canternova was playing it back and ragging on them all morning
Really well, he's did that was something original anyway
Yeah well I just thought it was funny I didn't I thought you would have heard about it by now
We haven't heard a word thanks for the good news, Bally
So it's a stupid stunt by kits the typical stupid radio stunt you know
Oh, we're just having a play on words here just fun and then we got Keith Urban on Monday not not urban music
But we're oh and channel seven got sucked into it those studs they're really cute
Those studs they make the audience love you more no
They make the audience hate you like toys. Oh yeah, everybody whipped up into a frenzy
See these people that do stuff like that thing. Oh, it's a lot of really good free publicity
Oh, it's bad publicity because it makes the audience very very angry
It makes them uh and this guy was listening to uh
Castanova on Zeta which he better not tell anybody about it beside us
That better be a big secret don't forget a week from yesterday
That's when we really find out how come it is that I don't know. It's about like the last three or four trends
Because he used to be well, you know, it's coming out and it's coming out
That's it, but now it seems like each one has got such spectacular significance
Do you know what I mean? Mm-hmm and the whole book is coming out on next Thursday the winner book and now we'll see WBGG
I bet you they got a they got nothing
And we'll see if maybe some of the other cheap channels stations take a real hit too a really big and we'll also see if WCMQFMA
Can continue with these abogues numbers they got?
I mean you talk about wired diaries man and eleven share and men and and and oh who you kidding huh CMQFM
There is it one person though no peek at a potty who listens WCMQFM
And datebroward Palm Beach Monroe any place to latch or what any place in Florida. There's not one
And so that one you take I mean how is that possible?
I don't know if you add up to Spanish language stations. They got 185% of the audience
There's something a little bit fishy there just like in that tank that
What's your name with swimming around and to get those free tickets for the dance?
Well, maybe they're listening to two different radio stations at the same time on two different radios
a simultaneous
uh
Stickfest ain't it called time will here you go here. It is the worst song ever very manllow and mandy
Though he had much worse songs than that
Well, that's the one they picked right it will hit to the other ones
Hockey updated says Calgary and five market down yet. They won an overtime last night two to one nice stop
Kujo not
Of course the least got beat by Philly, but we knew that was gonna happen three to one
They just didn't show up at all. They never got off the bus
That had to be one of the most boring games I've ever seen in my life
And the best harness driver ever can to be any question Donald Brainer good facts excellent
Rick acid line me a different Rick says apparently the kiss FM format change was a hoax
Put on by kiss to all the news station to see who would run with it apparently
Sem was the only sucker who took it out of the story without ever checking it out
It looks like the newsplex station doesn't need to verify a story before airing it
Just needs a head there it is heads up on the kiss. Thank you
Let's see here's the facts from
Tefill
To fill in
It says I rarely facts, but I have to say Pat Tillman's death may serve to bring attention that people are being slaughtered over there in case
You're unaware of his story this guy was a young fit blue out all American boy who also happened to be in all pro consider
One of the up and coming NFL stars after 9-11 he has to be released from his contract and ruled in the service and now look what happened
It's not like he had a rack in mind when they crashed the towers
Maybe this waste of his life will get the president and to show the 600 plus others slaughter. No, it could happen
Yeah
It says this does actually hurt God was a millionaire did the right thing for his country then got killed like hundreds of other guys
With for some schmuck with an agenda
See how that affected me for some a mass hole with an agenda is what I think he was trying to say moved you
Thanks tea fill to fill in
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T inforizon wireless line a lot of things going on and a lot of them not too good
We don't want to see those caskets though. It's a very ugly reminder now carry had a good day yesterday
You want to know why because it was earth day oh?
And so he made a stirring speech about the environment which is the one issue that he is heads and shoulders above our anti-environment
Poisoning the ear and everything and the waterways of bush the only problem is nobody gives a flying crap about the environment
Except about how many people
Yeah
Oh, no
Look at this uh facts that we just got here we're worst of all time
I like the nightlife by Alicia Bridges who kept saying that song we don't know why she kept saying
Maybe she was looking for something I don't know, but that's what this fact she says I like the nightlife
Okay, there you go John she's going for you market down
So someone left the cake out in the rain look Arthur's turn talking about
Someone left the cake out in the rain. I wonder if he has a it's a line from a song that goes on for seven minutes
MacArthur Park
How'll be done. Oh here's one the magic people turn this uh facts you're against it
Build me up buttercup by the foundations. They play it how many times an hour they play that
About third man every hour on the hour. It's build me up buttercup. Why do you oh god man the foundations which quite frankly when that song came out in 68 or 9
I like that song used to play it as a DJ on a radio on Kalamazoo mission and now I hate it
Because magic one oh two point seven won't send you to heaven man. I'll send you to purgatory at best. That's an idea for a poll
What's that and you know something? What what what's an idea? What song did you used to like but they destroyed it for you?
We've already done that we have yeah overplayed song yes, okay
Now the reason now we know the reason that we're not getting any information about the kissing it would inside our own right because they're
Because it was a fraud right it was a scam. It was almost as embarrassing as the online auction on wqm.com
The new revenue stream
To put 70 to $17 a week in the beastly pocket. It's just please play for the last time play the song would change my name to
Shufro
What did me for the last time says least better get go on me out of your idea when his mats coming back
We have no idea they're not saying it don't look too promising name is this whole round. So in other words
Coach co-care crackle crackle and that's what that's all I'd expect. Oh, okay
Well played it all the time. I'm not playing it on demand right now. This is not demand friday
Okay, the audience is pretty demanding today and do this and get that banner at off and do that and do this
Let's see bat says
Number one song February 5th 1977 torn between two lovers by Miriam McGregor the worst song ever
Which is kind of interesting because Miriam McGregor he died the great column is yesterday
And this is by Miriam McGregor you see the connection now turned between two lovers got it good
Oh, this is bad. This is this really frost my fat ass
David you may be a really good guy, but you're taste in music you could
Stuff it in somebody's vacuum wow the worst song ever recorded a horse with no name by America
He says god that song sucked. I like that song. You didn't like that song. I like to find they played it a lot
It's got a little tirey. No, we're not talking. No change the topic here. We already did that. It's old and stared
You know it's only in mold. No, I liked it. I like to find played it a horse with no name by America
You you in fact that was driven by Don Brainer too. You used to have a name, but after he what he did what he lost the name is
I knew David's voice when you five six
You am
You go to hell you dad if you ever turned on the radio and said that song makes me sick
Well, no, Keo Pactade records presents signs that make you want to throw up
I got to go to go to go to you. I got to
I'm so is that make you want to throw up you get stained
A complete bar for Rama and who could forget their classic
You make me won't
You can do the puke it sounds that make you want to throw up
1046 and 560 you know CNN they are
Elantick least out they really are because they got the story wrong about Pat Tillman
He did get killed. It was in Afghanistan not in Iraq. They hit on Iraq
The first the crawly put on there you see myself now they changed it to get it right
But they just can't get nothing right they don't know what they're talking about Pat Tillman former NFL player who swapped a glorious football career to enlist in the US army has been killed in action at
Afghanistan ABC News is learned
The 2070 will former football star was killed in direct action during a firefight in Afghanistan
Pentagon sources told ABC News no further details available
For more remember the Arizona Cardinals tell me along with his brother Kevin enrolled with the US Army Rangers after the 9-11 terror attacks last year
The brothers were awarded an Arthur rash courage award meant for individuals whose contributions trans in sport
The word was accepted by the younger brother Richard while the brothers were away
A Tillman unrestricted free agents burned a nine million dollar five year offer sheet from the St. Louis Rams in
2000 to join the army the 5-11-100 pound Tillman was an exceptional student with a 3.84 grade point average due college and graduated summa cum laude with the
Reign marketing the Tillman family's been notified of Quinto a Pentagon source
So there you go Afghanistan which you know it's still a tragic story, but it's uh at least it wasn't in Iraq see what I'm saying right
In any rate
Here's some more faxes now and this one Chris from Bokey better calm down a little bit
We didn't pick we built the city
The magazine blender which nobody even ever heard of until I came up with this poll I should point out blender
Uh, they picked it as number one the worst song about time stars should because Chris says how can you put that on there instead of miracles
Because it's worth it says am I the only one who heard miracles eight billion times?
Yes, there's no song worse. So let's put miracles on here in other words if you like it. It's a miracle
It's kind of like a
Beasley station if you like it it must be a miracle that thing with kiss just really frost my ass. That is so lame surprising
So lame and again we have to learn from the audience what's going on because inside the building it's like everybody they're too embarrassed to tell us about it
Laura says honey the worst song of all time by Bobby Goldsbroe but guess what honey? I mean Laura
That was under yesterday didn't make the cut a cut a few votes
It's an excellent choice, but it didn't make the cut to carry over for two day got it got it
Roger says whenever I heard on to sexy for my shirt or hey Mickey
I wanted to plunge a butcher knife into my chest
Both of those are really good. I'm too sexy for my shirt. I'm too sexy
Right, well, that's just a line from the song right
And I wanted and I wanted to plunge a shirt into Mickey's a chest. I mean hey Mickey
Who did hey Mickey? Tony Basil. Oh
Let's plunge a while just into our armpit. We don't want to hurt her real bad just briefly likely

But I'm sure there's some Elvis songs that belong on there
Sure, I'm gonna let the audience decide because there's so many so many bad Elvis songs and so little time

Noon to wonder they at the CREXAN business center
6625 Mimee Lakes Boulevard
Or drive whatever that is stop by and register to win free office space for a year
also spin the QM Vield

That was good
The other promos we'll do later on because it gets ponderous
Howard Stern trams in New York City back to number one
According to Miss Fudge in a flood report with the Arbitram ratings from New York
After all these things and after the FCC says oh it's indecent all this other crap back to number one in New York
Stern with a 12 plus number of 7.2 in New York
And a stunning 10.0 in ages 2554
That's men and women 2554
You following that I got it up from a 5 9 12 plus to a 7 2
Let's see WINS all news of a second with a 6.4 12 plus
WABC's Curtis and Kubi a 3.4 and WFAN's Don I'mis
2.6
Stern 7.2 I'mis
2.6
Exactly so there you go
I just mentioned that in passing for all the asternity tractors and all the other idiots out there
They think that they should in term what can be on the air what can't be on the air etc. I just mentioned that in passing
Let's see the worst song list would be incomplete without Gordon Lightfoot and the wreck of the MN Fitzgerald
Yeah
How dare they say that hey
WINS record the MN Fitzgerald you got a trash good
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT and T and for I'm saying you know this thing about I mean I realized we got a lot of stupid people in America
Oh we got a few educated people
And the idea that they don't that they can ban the showing of flag-grade caskets
In other words there's nothing tasteless being shown we're not being shown
Bodies etc. All of that one story that that horrible story we saw that one day a couple weeks ago was nothing to make you puke
but
They're flag-grade caskets
And they're a reminder of the fact that there actually are people dying
It's not just a statistic on the screen
But the Pentagon and the government don't want you to think about that. They don't much. Yeah, I shall see the tangible results of what's going on over there
This insanity. That's bad for morale. That's right
On the other hand Pat Tillman who died in Afghanistan
I mean he was a big NFL star and there was a big story about how we walked away from a big career and all that money
Uh, that's getting the enormous amount of coverage the other people who die if they get like even a two-second blurb on there
That's a lot
Because we don't want to remind the public it's a bad like you said for a public support
For a totally bogus war five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T Verizon line WQA. I'm hello
I think Gary Glitter should be flawed for what he did. I think you're right
Now he's talking about the kitty porters. He talking about the song
Now he actually was under yesterday
Evidently didn't do all that well because he certainly didn't come close to making the cut but you're right, Pally
And I think that the sports people lead promoters and the uh whoever whoever pissed the music in the arena
They ought to be flawed for just they won't leave us alone with this
Over and over it over we hate it with despise it
Especially sour notes
sour

Maybe seven minutes and it was a really good you know when he had to like go out and do a number

five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line the worst top 40 song of all time
Here's one of the worst stories of all time
An airport airport security screeners refused to let a cancer patient border flight home to Denver from Orlando
Because they said she no longer resembled her identification photos
You see this story? No
nauseating
A theme in La Pura 35 finally flew out of Orlando on a frontier airlines flight Wednesday night two days after she was turned away
By security screeners La Pura said she'd lost weight in here because of chemotherapy treatments since the photos were taken for a
US passport and Colorado driver's license
I feel very degraded and angry said La Pura who was returning home from vacationing in St. Augustine and whose husband works for frontier airlines
La Pura spent most of Tuesday trying to resolve the issue only to be told during conversation with a federal transportation
Security administration employee in Washington that she needed new photos and a doctor's note to explain her changed appearance
Now I want you to think about the logic of that okay? She would leave go and get new photos and come back
Oh, yeah, now it's okay because now it looks just like you right that makes a lot of sense
I asked the lady so what happens if somebody goes on a weight watchers La Pura told you Orlando Sentinel
She's like if you didn't get documentation from your doctor that you've lost weight then it's okay
Right documentation from your doc at the burger proof is on you you got to have all your docs in order in a row
TSA in front line airlines blame private security guards frequently mistaken by travelers as TSA employees for not letting the woman in a teenage
Send aboard the flight I would bitch slap them man. You wouldn't believe it. I take a two-by-four after I finished with that
Solidado Brian I go to work on them right there in Orlando. What a bunch of losers in Orlando. Oh, man
Out of you losers here too and prove for that being I wish police arrested two Canadian men today
After alleged air agents that it would cause American airlines flight to divert to southwest Ireland
Police said the plane on route to London from New York landed at Chan in airport around one o'clock this morning after disturbance broke out on board
The two men in their forties were detained and will be charged under Ireland's air navigation act
They police spokesmen said two Canadian and a little bit rowdy a probably pissed off about that game last night
Although of course it was one o'clock in the morning over there was like old Eastill 8 o'clock while they saw it fully got the first goal
They were pissed off you understand that don't you no sure WQM. Hello
I can feel yes sir

Well, there you go.
Mom, I'm throwing.
Oh, here's another one.
Guaranteed, it's on the list.
Man, do something about that ponytail, Mark.
Okay, Dick Clark, the elected one.
Mark Lindsay.
Probably our kind of duck Lindsay, the next man.
Wait a minute.
She must belong to San Francisco.
She must belong to a weak post and a post, or a poncho and so on.
Arizona.
Mark Lindsay.
Man, it sucked.
I'm just looking down my disc here to see if I can find some of the qualify.
The worst, I mean, when you say the worst of all time, this is because you didn't like
one, didn't make it the worst.
It has to be really bad.
For example, well, this was annoying.
To me, the flying machine.
Smile a little smile.
And if you can feel smile, if you're in the zone, you got one great sense of humor.
I'll figure that out.
What do you say?
Smile a little smile for me.
Okay.
I think it qualifies.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
Don't forget, join Geltie tonight.
Speaking of that, from 6 to 8 at the quarter, a quarter deck at 1541, quarter of a road
and four, Lauderdale, stop by to enjoy Amsterdam light specials and register to win
I'm going to start for two to the Iceland open golf tournament coming in June in Iceland

That's 6 o'clock tonight at the quarter of a road quarter deck.
Poke Geltie in the somewhere and see what he does.
Join George on Sunday 11-1 at Bill Sydel's Mitsubishi and he still has no idea where they
can't even keep coming back and paying him, but he'll take the cash, thank you.
That Bill Sydel's Mitsubishi just west of 27th Avenue on 36th Street in Miami.
The reason I haven't keep coming back is because he's a sandwich guy and brings all
them nice sandwiches from a learning city sub.
So, Joyce will have prices sandwiches if you get there real early before the employees
stop them all up and messages from God.
Yeah, good.
No extra charge.
Sunday 11-1.
Got a lot of heavy duty weekend coming all this, all these things.
Too bad I'm not there to do some of those personal appearances.
WQA, hello.
Hey, I got something for the poll.
Okay.
I don't know who sings it, but it's early morning singing song.
Early morning singing song?
Good morning, starside, she's talking about it.
Yeah, good morning, starside, nice.
Oh, good morning, starside by Oliver.
Oliver, you're right, very good, George.
Good morning, starside, an annoying as hell.
Thanks.
Thank you.
See you.
Glitty gloopy gloopy.
Good morning, starside.
Okay, but it takes some of the words he was using in there.
Like what?
La la la la lo lo.
Yeah, I can't say that anymore.
I'll...
You're watching it.
I'll be right back.
Yeah, that's true.
There's a lot of really funky words in there.
We're better like a double and triple-second.
Good thing I don't have that to play here.
Lili, Lolo.
Right.
All the way.
All the way.
Do you have, let's see, uh, I don't know.
This is pretty annoying too.
Very annoying.
Bandit-y pair.
Where are you getting this, Jeb?
Oi.
He's the time of day.
I find nothing much to say.
Don't know.
Early in the morning, you'll be puking your guts in.
Oh, we got some good news.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to revise schedule.
Look at this.
Oh, right.
The Humper.
Oh, this is the best news I've had since the Marlins pulled out that, uh, since they
played during our show yesterday.
The Humper is on today as opposed to the big...
Oh!
Okay.
Now, that's with all due respect to the big O who's brutal on the ear and is a good guy though.
But the Humper returns the Hebrew hammer will be on it as usual time, Fortis-Hernes-F-Noon,
prior to the Marlin pregame show at 7.
Oh, I feel so much better now, don't you?
Huh?
I don't care.
Oh, here you go.
Lobo.
Me and you and a dog named...
Well, this is here blue, but that's not it.
A dog named Boo.
It's a dog named Blue.
That's the Ontario's dog blue.
That's a pit bull.
A lot of people think that's what they're saying.
Well, I hate to break the news here, but it's me and you and a dog named Boo.
Okay, mister?
Boo as in Boo-Hoo.
Boo-radly.
Let's see.
Um, that middle is the Rose.
Oh, getting some emotional factors here.
11.27 at QA.
My, my, my, and lo.
This is Fortis-Hernes-F-Noon.
QA.
Yeah.
Friday, you bastard.
I gotta start eating right.
My chest is getting tight.
My cholesterol counts.
It's going off the judge.
Ah!
Pumping and bumping.
I'm not feeling too good.
I think I might buy the farm.
Oi.
Hi, I'm Darryl Hall.
You know, even though my hair looks really good and I got a great bod and all the women really love me,
I got a problem.
Hi, cholesterol.
So, that's why I ate this new, polonote grand cereal.
Every taste a little flake of taste, just like my partner, John.
Except they're bigger and they don't hold back my career.
Anyway, before you've lost that living feeling, rock and roll with a healthy bowl of polonote grand.
Hey, it's the only thing I like better than me.
Oh, no, try a boy.
As a milk and chew out.
Try some polonote.
Be a brand-eater.
Polonote grand cereal from the makers of guns and raisins.
Oh, have a bowl.
Be a brand-eater.
27, total, 11, 33, 5, 60, WQM.
Here's the facts from listener George with a G who says,
Now, that's interesting.
You notice he was going to add on the worst song ever and a bomb he didn't change his mind.
You see that?
Okay.
Crossed it out.
Well, he had more serious things to talk about.
He says, the news of US Army Ranger Pat Tillman's death,
while certainly no more important than the daily deaths of our other servicemen,
really shows the sport tools for what they are.
To wit, Eli Manning, son of XNFL star Archie Manning and brother of current footballer,
Peyton Manning, has told the San Diego Chargers,
don't draft me with your first draft pick, I won't play for you, I'll set out the whole year.
Note that Mr. Tillman declined the three-year $3 million deal from the Arizona Cardinals,
because he decided that going to join his brother in a fight against terrorism was a greater cause.
I've got advice, Eli.
Take the silver spoon out of your Sunday Masshold,
against that $3 million gig in San Diego playing a game for living in beneath you and your family's standards.
You're an embarrassment, Eli, and all the draft nicks, or should I say, draft dodgers,
that are giving up for tomorrow's big draft, the football party,
should likewise fight it with both hands and a flashlight.
You're getting drunk while others are getting dead.
Good Facts, Mr. George.
Nice going, baby.
Good job.
Hey there.
Oh, gee, don't drafts.
Kind of sounds like Eric Lindross all over again.
Look what happened to him.
Even Josh knows about that story.
Not.
Let's see.
Louisiana may ban low-slung pants.
Look at this.
As the boots continue stopping.
Maybe Nancy Sinatra was just ahead of her time with these boots are made for stop and song.
That and Rouge, Louisiana.
People are wearing low-slung pants that expose skin or intimate clothing, like underwear, of course,
would face the fine of up to and possible up to something, but that's left out.
The story's chopped off.
I hate that when they do that to me.
A fine of up to dollars and possible jail time under a bill fined by Jefferson Perish Lawmaker.
State Representative Derek Shepard said he filed a bill because he was tired of catching glimpses of boxer shorts and G-strings.
Yaddi, yaddi, yaddi, over the lowered belt lines of young adults.
Right in the column here is chopped off.
The bill would punish anyone covering low-writing pants with a fine of as much as $500 or as many as six months in jail or both.
I'm sick of seeing it.
Said Shepard, a first-term legislator, the community's outraged.
And if parents can't do the job, if parents can't regulate what they're children with, then there ought to be a law.
There ought to be a law against mass holes like you, sir.
The bill would be tacked under the state of Sen. Law, which restricts sexual activity in public places and the sale of sexual explicit items.
Joe Cook, head of the ACLU Louisiana chapter, said the bill probably doesn't meet the US Supreme Court standard for the prohibition of obscene behavior under the first, first amendment.
What's that?
First amendment?
Somebody must not have told this guy. We don't got no first amendment, no, Mo.
Wow.
Let's see, kiss on my list by Hall of Notes and air supply.
I beg your pardon.
I don't want to change my vote to kiss on my list.
Oh, man.
I'll tell you one thing with that line in the regard of the last bit.
A lot of people wouldn't hear any Hall of Notes song. They run right to the bull.
Kiss on my list and air supply in the one you love.
Oh, yes. The one you love.
Man, you...
Oh, I don't want to say it.
Rocco says regarding the draft. Oh, yeah.
Who do you think the Marines all are going to draft?
The 4.0 student from De Cominity College or the Honest Mechanic from Sunrise.
They're both 20 years old, but the Mechanic may help more on the front lines.
And what's your take on the Air Force Navy trade for the second pick?
The guy with the two kids he'll really produce don't you think?
Yeah.
Nice song, Rocco.
Exactly.
Oh, yes.
Draft talk. All draft stuff, baby.
We got that big draft tomorrow.
And like somebody we know says, draft this.
Man, I just...
And my whole lifetime, as much as I love watching the NFL, I love the games,
all this other stuff, big fan.
But the draft makes it's almost like idiots that go up to the NFL.
What do they call it?
The Combine.
Man.
If America was as concerned, those same people that are worried about that crap
were as concerned about Columbine as they are about Columbine,
then maybe we might be starting to make a little bit of progress.
You know what I'm saying?
We've got some really goofballs like the big...
Oh!
For example, who thankfully will not be honest afternoon.
The Humper will be on 4-7 or safe.
Who pays his own way to the NFL Combine,
so we can watch these guys run and jump and scratch these others ass and whatever they're doing.
Tackle each other around the waist, squeeze real tight.
Now here's what it says.
I love the flower girl, but the good news is that's not the name of the song.
Does it?
The Rain the Park, the other things?
Correct.
The Rain the Park and whatever.
What is it called?
The Rain, the Moon, the Sun, the Star.
The Rain, your mama.
The Cow Piles.
I like the cow sills.
Need to.
And I like that song.
The Rain, the Park and other things that's the name of the song.
It was number two for two weeks.
It was on the charts for 12 weeks.
1967.
A very fortuitous date in American history.
The year that the Detroit winded the toilet never came back out.
I have a burning desire to go back to the olden days in Detroit,
because back in the day, what I want to say that was,
back in the early 60s, before 67.
Before they just started to set it all on fire.
560, 560, 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

Nothing compares with Cheyenne Hiddle Conner.
Chanel Conner, right.
Okay, thank you.
Cheyenne Hiddle Conner.
Nothing compares.
What is that?
I don't know what that song is.

Yeah.
How's it going?
Badly.
Evidently.

How about that song?
9875, 59.
What did you say?
No idea.
Oh.
Was he talking about Beatswood 45789?
I couldn't understand.
His phone was scrapping on.
I think we like to joke anyway.
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T.
I hope they put in Beatswood 45789 on there by the Marvelettes' dog.
Or we're going to be really porked off.
Okay.
Okay.
Can we say that porked off?
No.
Or we're going to be really a peyote.
Cowed off.
Right.
Aiki Breakey Heart, Billy Ray Cyrus, man.
Oh, by the way, do you hear that?
The country is going to urban.
Not.
That is just what's going on inside this company.
It's going to be a really bad thing.

He's had a ton of hits.
But none as painful as the one he took
when he walked into a wall and broke his nose.
And now Barry's singing about it in his brand new CD
can't smell without you.
With fractured versions of Barry's hits like Copic Evanna.
I brought my...
From my banana.
And now it's the size of a banana.
As well as a re-masked and really nasally version of Mandy
recorded at the moment of impact.
Oh, damn it.
My nose is in the wall now we're taking.
But that's not all.
Barry Manelow's can't smell without you is swollen with hits.
You nose and love like I break the shnauz.
I made it through the pain.
Looks like I broke it.
And a title track with Barry's trademark hook.
You know I can't smell without you.
I can't breathe without you.
I can't stiff and I can't pick.
It looks like my face was hit with a prick.
Barry Manelow's can't smell without you.
Walk into a wall mark.
Ow!
His face doesn't look like a whey.
A prick.
11, 46, at 560 WQM Sean.
A regular faxer Sean says you pull this one but I must blow
all other nominees out of the water with.
Eyes wide shut of musical releases.
Another brick in a wall by the Rascal House of Music World Pink Floyd.
Sean says I'd rather hear my own cardiac monitor flatline tone.
Got it?
Another brick in a wall?
We got it.
PS?
I tuned into 570 WQM.
The last night at the point spread was plus 10 kilohertz.
What's up with him?
He answers I don't know more often than Robert Reagan at a
deposition.
He's all that's left on over night unless you want to hear about
crop circles made by alien mutilated cattle from Atlantis.
Jerry Wichner would sound like we'd courted to me about now.
Says first we did Sean.
Sorry Sean, the best we can do.
And in line with that, before we get to their songs.
Another subject that says here, what's up with Joe Castello?
Any word on his petition for reinstatement?
No, no.
Although I disagree with some of his stuff, his churling on the invasion of Iraq.
He did?
We heard that remember?
Oh my God Joe, no wonder you're off the air.
His incestant NASCAR craft, he seemed like a good guy who got a raw deal.
Well, I tell you this, he's a good guy who got a raw deal.
Joe Castello.
Missed a guy in many areas.
But he's a good guy who got a raw deal.
He won't be back on.
No chance.
I mean, you know, Greg Reed just talks crap.
You know, he goes in a very Jack as his column and he puts his birds out there,
some birds out there, and just have fun.
You know, that's his idea of fun.
Two simple and sub-grade minds, very Jack as in Greg Reed.
Both of whom have one favorite sound.
Yeah!
That's it.
While they scratch each other's head, looking for that bald spot.
Here's a great suggestion by the same factory.
Er, daddy don't you walk so fast by Wayne Newton.
It says, makes me want to choose the poison pudding.
Before I say,
And Wayne Newton and Donkey Shane just coincides with these two came in from different people.
Thank you Tom.
Donkey Shane, I was going to be curious to see how Josh spells Donkey Shane.
So maybe how to spell it for you, okay?
Why don't you?
Yeah, D-A-M-K-E.
Got it?
Donkey?
Yeah.
Shane, capital S-C-H-O-E-N.
Donkey Shane.
See, I'm brushing up on my choimin' because the way things are going right now, you do understand.
Oh, yeah.
We will have you speaking lots of tremen very soon.
Here's one that says,
I'd like to nominate the song you play quite often on your show.
The only problem being, I'm sure, was not a top 40 hit.
I smoked two joints.
It says, it gags me whenever I hear it.
That's kind of an incentive for me to play that pretty soon, you know?
Yeah, inspiring.
That was not a hit.
Oh, it should have been.
Steve says,
I finally have the form to express how much I despise this song.
The song is rock lobster by the B-52s.
The song is annoying, has some ass clown yelling rock lobster through the whole song in different tones.
Please put this song out of pool.
You got it, Steve.
You got it?
We got it.
Rock lobster, which is kind of like what they have at the ammo coast, you know, this...
He's writing, he's writing.
So, it seems?
Okay.
I was just about to play it out of the thing here.
Let's see, Devon says, while I hate Aiki Breaky Hard, I've thrown many radios out of the window, so I was not to hear.
And see, a lot of people don't understand the lyrics of a song, or even the name of the song.
So, Devon, while I agree with you wholeheartedly, you have the wrong name for this song.
Cats and the cradle, he says.
Well, guess what, Devon?
That's not the name of the song.
We're cats in the cradle.
The cats in the microwave, that was the follow-up.
Wasn't the cats in the microwave?
Mm-hmm.
And cats in Uranus.
They cats, Chrisco.
Right.
Cats and the cradle, eh, eh, eh, in the cradle.
It's a...
What about Nazareth?
My white bicycle?
Was that a moment?
What about it?
It says, talk about annoying, by the way, have you ever seen W and Hitler in the same room?
Of course not.
It says, same person.
But it is graceful comment, even though very accurate.
Elmer says, you'll probably disagree with me, but please, Ed.
Now, see, again, this must be just a misprint, because I'm sure that Elmer knows the real name of the song.
It says La Bama.
Yeah, I think that's what he meant to write.
La Bamba.
By Richie Valensky, listed.
Barf O'Rama.
La Bamba is what he says.
Barf O'Rama with La Bamba.
As in, if you're got something.
Thank you, Elmer.
You got it, La Bamba?
Richie Valens, don't be taking on Richie.
He still sleeps with a fish.
He's a man, him and look at Bratzie.
And Paulie won't see him no more, either.
Let's see.
Here's the word from a Sam and the...
In Virginia, listening on the net, he says, the lion sleeps tonight.
The tokens.
Yeah.
Parents, Thomas, I bet you like that one.
The tokens, the lion sleeps tonight.
Says, makes me want to hurl.
Thank you, Sam.
But the faxes are just pouring in.
Who said this wasn't going to be a great pool, huh?
Right.
You have a little faith.
Whoever said that.
How many votes have we got on here?
It's not a question of how many we got, because 352.
Grimes would be 52.
When you got a list that's this long, each vote is going to take.
But that's why we leave it out there over the weekend.
You have plenty of time to peruse and pick the one you choose
that really be losing it.
WQA, hello.
How many votes have we got?
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Hey, man, I think I got the all-time worst.
OK.
I had the cover.
It's a cover, though.
Yeah.
Lucian, the sky would diamonds buy.
We didn't chat, and there.
We didn't chat, and there.
Absolutely.
Everything sucks that he's ever done.
I believe it's a joke.
It's a joke only.
It ain't funny.
OK, thanks a lot, Pellie.
We didn't chat, and there.
Can he sing?
No.
And he knows it.
So it's a joke, but it's a comedy record.
We were going to put artists on here, though.
But yeah, in that case, you'll have to put that on there
because maybe we just won't.
Plus, I don't think it was the top 40.
Maybe that was the first thing.
Maybe it was a top 1,000 hit.
What?
The William Shatner version.
Come on.
Look at this.
Number six with a bullet.
What?
Just a joke.
I know.
For some strange reason, William Shatner is even in the...
No.
How do you like that?
Don't see him nowhere.
So I agree with you wholeheartedly, but luckily, we don't have to put it on there.
Don't put it on there.
OK, don't put it on there.
And I just...
He had it fast.
Don't put it on there because once you put it on there, you can't get it off.
I...
Just like that someone ate the cake with some diabetic ate the cake and got five or three or whatever that song was.
With a spork in the rain.
Boy 12 accused of threatening allergic teacher with cookie.
South Orange, New Jersey.
This is a true story.
A sixth grader was suspended after school officials accused him of threatening to expose a highly allergic teacher to peanut butter cookies the boys father said yesterday.
Lubrurt Gabriel said his son.
What kind of a name is that?
That's all one name.
L-O-U-B-E-R-T.
Lubrurt Gabriel said his son, 12-year-old Jules, had been out of kept at a class in tapeful second after a girl in a social studies class.
It's not Orange Middle School told the teacher that Jules had made the threat.
The father said Jules was carrying a snack packet of nut butter cookies and did make a comment about having something dangerous.
But never said he had a weapon.
They must have had a list, Gabriel said.
Gabriel said the boy hasn't been allowed to return to classes, spending a May 13 hearing by the district.
The family had believed his suspension would just be for ten days.
School officials declined to comment yesterday.
Ingestion of even a morsel of peanut can cause people who are allergic to suffer severe reactions from throat irritation to death.
Gabriel said the teacher was not exposed to the cookies and had no reaction.
Thank the Lord.
Thank you.
God.
Death by peanut butter cookies.
Kind of like people allergic to shellfish like Bob Green.
Remember that?
No.
Every time we go to dinner, I kept saying, hey, try the shrimp.
Try the, uh, it's fantastic.
Shrimp.
But you never fell for it.
How about some shrimp salad, Bob?
Come on.
You can do it.
And give some to Cheryl while you're at it, too.
That's the Rock Lobster.
Right.
5607-0560, Palm 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
WQM, hello.
WQM, hello.
Pretty natto.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, a great poll.
Okay.
Yes, I am.
Actually, I've got a couple of ideas for you.
How about short people?
Randy Newman.
And, uh, Convoy.
Like, uh, silly song, all those TV holes you've been listening to.
Okay.
Thanks, Valley.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Hello.
Hello.
George, is that you?
Yes.
Hi, I've got a couple of songs for the poll.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Okay.
One is Bobbi Vitten.
I think it's called Melody of Love.
where boy, yachiro, yachikol, tell us about the one.
Okay.
And the other one was Byron McGregor,
the American.
Right, from CKLW.
I think so.
Yes, sir, absolutely.
Okay, thanks.
Neither one of those were a hit, though.
Well, I have better look at Bobby Vintin,
I don't think so.
In fact, I'm glad he mentioned Bobby Vintin,
though the Polish Prince.
Man, oh man.
It's enough to make you want to declare war on Poland.
Bobby Vintin, not because, definitely he's got some songs.
What was the one he said?
Melody Demore.
Ilyah Flough.
Yeah.
Melody Demore was by the Ames Brothers.
My melody, they were like, oh, now I know what's when he's talking about.
Oh, yeah.
It was number three hundred chart 74.
My melody, I love you.
Got it? Good.
And some more Bobby Vintin songs.
Roses are red.
Oh, it was number one for four weeks.
What does that say about America?
Get that on there, Roses are red.
Blue on blue.
Get that on there.
And blue velvet.
Oh, God.
It was number one for three weeks.
Bobby Vintin is the Antichrist.
My name is Lucas.
This is 5cp.
The radio's on your cell.
QA.
This is Mark Morgan.
It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.
All right.
Back in the day when someone done us wrong.
We didn't take their crap.
Imperial Harmer, who went the jabs dropped their bonds.
We bombed them back.
And now the Saudis, they hit us hard.
And on our cards, our little flags wave.
As that Saudi love and retard,
points the farmers the wrong way.
And of embarrassed to be in Americans,
where they follow booze like cheese.
The United States of arrogance,
and by push and its enemies,
we think of this country.
And the length of the darkest days in our history.
I don't want to be a taxamerican.
In the USA.
What's a few thousand innocent lives?
Stop living in the past.
If you want, let's you be to drive.
You're gonna need more gas.
It's the greatest country in the world.
They train us to believe.
And anyone who says that, obviously,
ends up for to be.
And on embarrassed to be in America,
where we take triologically,
wave a flag in what has with our head in the sand
and blindly follow the powers that be apathetic.
And watching state reviews on a 65-inch screen,
mass retrofit, find everything's okay.
In the USA.
As it go, in 8,
12, 3, 5, 60, everything here,
I think we left one off there.
I don't see tub thumping by Chumawamba.
Do you?
I'm sure it slipped to the cracks.
It must have slipped through the crack.
No, it's on there.
Tum thumping is on there.
Yeah.
Get out of town.
Tum thumping must be weird.
Oh, there it is.
It's got zero.
It's got the big O.
Holy moly.
How's that?
I don't even see it.
Another brick in a wall.
There's tub thumping right around the rain apart
of the things and not too far down from someone
that could kick out in the rain.
Well, there it is.
Now, America must have changed it.
They must have built you up on MacArthur Park.
Look at that.
You owe Eric's big time, man.
I'm fair that right now.
This letter that you faxed me,
this, uh, thank you very much for ever sent this.
One of our chronic regular faxures.
Thank you.
It said, I guess this mass hole is okay
with the Iraq debacle,
as long as you as death toll.
Doesn't exceed the 9-11 death toll.
Only after it reaches 3,000,
will she then be pissed?
Wow.
This is a letter to the Sun Central
from Patricia Bendeto in, um,
Bendeto in Fort Lauderdale, who writes,
I'm dismayed by your daily tally
of the casualties of the Iraq Wars,
if they were lotter numbers,
the current figures are still less
than the World Trade Center victims alone.
Maybe you could compare your numbers
to any of the previous words that we've involved in.
Then your readers can see that,
while every person is to be grieved,
the sacrifice that we put out is small
compared to the historical significance
of the outcome of this war.
Anyone for Armageddon?
Whatever the hell that means.
Is that incredible or what?
Is it as if Iraq has got something to do with Armageddon?
Is if Iraq has got something to do with 9-11?
Neither which is the case.
Wow.
That letter of Patricia may be one of the worst
in the history of the subhuman race.
Can you believe that?
I believe it.
Typical.
In other words, like this fact,
she says, once we get past 3,000,
then we'll be even, okay?
What if we get past the Vietnam number?
Then, no, it'll be an issue.
The only problem with that is that these are,
uh, more of ours that we're talking about.
We don't even talk about the Iraqi casualties.
They're not putting in the numbers of the casualties
in Iraq of them because we don't have them.
They're animals anyway.
Thousands of them.
Thousands of them.
They have nothing to do with it now.
After not having been a hotbed at terrorism,
now they certainly are.
It's a nice going USA.
Well, you see?
And then, all we had before we had, uh,
what's his name, Robert Muller on there,
and John Ascroft, one of the worst mass holes in history,
the two of them on there together warning us the world,
you know, because of everything that's going on,
because of what we saw happen in Spain,
before the presidential elections here in November,
we're certainly anticipating they're very well could be terrorist attacks
on US soil again.
Is that because of, uh, 9-11?
No.
It's because of our Iraq attack is what it is.
But anyway, don't confuse them with the facts.
Okay, it's a little bit too difficult to connect all these dots.
They take a look at it and they say, what's dot?
Regarding the polls as the same facts,
if you're many rippred in and I agree,
this is an excellent fact.
Loving you is a rather annoying song,
which has been overlooked, right?
Yeah.
Also, this bias, free bird,
and the first time ever I saw your face long,
run out, and oh, so terminal.
Actually, I like the one by Roberta Flack, the original.
But we'll put it on there for mixing feel better, right?
Okay.
Why?
I said, okay.
Free bird, free bird,
another horrible song.
Free bird.
Yeah.
Put a note on there.
Free bird and first time ever I saw your face.
Roberta Flack.
I can't imagine anybody doing like that.
Who we did that?
I don't know.
Who didn't?
Somebody did.
Alone again, naturally by Gilbert Osalov and naturally,
we're going to put that on there.
He's a crap.
Awful.
Kind of like, I don't know what you call it,
a novelty song or not, really.
I know what I call it.
No, it's not a novel about it.
Yeah.
What I call it, that's it.
56070560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
WQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you today?
Pretty good.
How you doing?
Good.
I've got one that I can't believe nobody's come up with yet.
And I know you don't like it.
It's by the Smiley.
Buttercup.
What is it?
Build me up a Buttercup.
Yeah, we got that one.
Oh, do you?
And also, whatever happened to, um...
Oh, God.
Charles Nelson Rally, Kitty Carlisle and Desmire.
Whatever happened to him?
Yeah, I haven't heard about them anymore.
Oh, Colin Polkibri and he'll talk about him for hours.
56070560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Do you understand what that means?
No.
WQAM, hello.
Four-mile with dustbias.
QAM.
Hey.
Yes, sir.
Got Neil?
Yes, I am.
Oh, man, I was quick today.
Sure.
How about sugar sugar by the Archons?
Headed yesterday.
Didn't do too well.
Oh, man, that was a song where you heard that the last song before you got out of the car with me.
You had old Dan, I couldn't stand it.
Sugar.
Yeah.
And we heard it.
How could you put free-foot on it?
That is one of the greatest songs and the greatest guitar licks, I've ever...
You know, I don't know.
Don't get angry with me.
Somebody just said that it okay.
Don't get the...
I've been out of shape with me.
All right.
Have a great day, Pallee.
Free-bird.
Socks.
56070560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
There's nothing like a good free bird.
All right, we can't talk about that in no more.
Wait a minute.
Somebody QA in, hello?
Yeah, let's talk to Neil.
Speaking.
Hey, Neil.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
This is Dan from Tell Right.
Hey, Dan, how are you?
Pretty good, you're so.
Pretty good?
That's something for the poll.
Okay.
All right.
The worst song in the history of music is Muscrat Love.
Captain and Neil.
What's on there yesterday?
Just failed to make the cut.
Oh, did I thought it hit the number 40?
I didn't know it made the...
No, let's see.
Muscrat, let's, like I said, yeah, it was just 33 votes.
Ah!
You've missed by about three slots for making the cut.
Ah, that's too bad.
That is the worst song.
Okay, thanks, Pallee.
All right, I can't get it, goodbye.
I'll pass it along to the Captain and Schlameel, all right?
They're divorced, by the way.
I didn't know that.
Oh, yeah, nasty divorce.
Five Tony Toneel, I was your name, right?
Correct.
And the Neil Sanacca.
He's got a wife, you know, and several children, which is shocking.
Yeah, that's right.
He has a wife, just because he is a little on the mincey side.
Don't make him want to be a little...
Well, yeah, little babies.
Come to QA and hello.
Hey, Neil, what's up, it?
How you doing, Pallee?
My all-time favorite worst tune is that Lou Baker, that mumbo number five.
Oh, man, amen.
That's it, man.
That's the perfect thing.
Until it's coming out of every part of my body, including some of my kidneys.
Every day, Pallee, thanks.
Mumbo number five, Lou Baker.
Probably drives a Chevy Vega.
Caprice.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty.
Five, sixty on the AT.
Got it now?
Mumbo number five.
Yeah, got it.
Now, you got it, all right.
Oh, we can't play that.
Just don't, I mean, we can't win this mumbo movement number two.
Oh, no.
Well, it's just don't, I mean, forget about all those sounds and things like that.
I apologize to the audience that we have to be like about her five-year-old children,
but we live in a very juvenile country, really, some of you do.
And that's just the way it goes.
We got them to say with that about it, on it.
WQA, hello.
Yeah, can I get on with Neil?
You're speaking to him.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good.
I just got in the town from San Francisco, Van.
You don't know how much we miss you.
Well, I'll be right out.
How about afternoon delight?
Afternoon delight that was on yesterday did not make the cut.
It had the 13 votes, not too big.
Oh, not too big.
Well, I can cure wholeheartedly.
It blows.
Right on.
Well, we miss you.
And we wish we could hear you in San Francisco.
You can, right online.
Why aren't you listening online?
You know what?
That's a good idea.
There you go.
Thanks, Pat.
Have a great day.
What a concept.
Listen online.
Like, people are all over the country.
I may have to get up a little early in the morning like 7 a.m.
Decades to begin the show.
6 a.m. like I said, no, 7.
7 11.
7, 11.
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the AT&T.
And Verizon wireless line.
I could read all the ones we did yesterday that didn't make the list, but that would be.
You could read it twice.
No.
WQA M. Hello.
Yes, I got one for Neil's phone.
Go right ahead.
I'll pass it on.
Don't worry, it'll be happy.
Bobby McFerrin.
Yes.
Excellent choice.
Thanks a lot, man.
OK, man.
See you.
Don't worry, be happy, Bobby McFerrin.
How many votes has it got?
Actually, the interesting part of that is it's got 16.
It's not doing nearly as well now as it was doing yesterday.
It's interesting.
Maybe we got a different crowd, right?
Maybe there's different choices.
It's Friday, so a lot of people are already gone for the weekend.
Boy, I'm telling you.
It's just, I don't want to go into it again.
You hear me saying it all the time.
But when it comes to be Friday and people have a chance to bail out there, gone.
Bye-bye.
That kind of a thing.

We are support radio 560-UAM.
Good.
Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Rambore 4 and 5.
Absolutely.
Oh you.
John, Rambore is still alive.
I want to make movies 4 and 5.
My life ain't going great plan. Hollywood's broke.
Unfortunately, I speak like I had a stroke.
First blood came in 82.
That's when I heard my penis and it never ever grew.
Rambore 2 wasn't 85 late.
Rambore 3 was in 88.
Shoe is in 1 and 2 is like a gun.
I did not make this movie with my son.
In every stage, she was in Rocky 5 in daylight.
The tunnel movie.
A little big.
That's what I mean.
I gotta get a little from the power of creed.
I gotta have another head movie.
Or blood will show like no other means.
I guess nobody ever saw Kotlin.
It was stupid.
I guess I understand.
My whole life is about to cave in.
Oh I got left in the center of the flavor.
Let me tell you something.
I need to make Rambore 4 and 5.
Check it out.
So call me up.
I really need a script.
I can do die along or keep it zipped.
I like comedy.
Action.
Adventure.
And drama.
The only thing I will not do is have sex with a llama.
So give me a break for goodness sake.
I used to be an opera and now I can't get a Ricky Lake.
Right now I got a one man show in Port Kipsy.
Basically I'm an unemployed gypsy.
A little bit of cash is what I mean.
I gotta get a loan from the power of creed.
I gotta have another hit movie.
Or Broadway show like Meta Heat.
I guess nobody ever saw Kotlin.
It was stupid.
So I understand.
My whole life is about to cave in.
Oh I got left in the center of the flavor.
That's why ladies and gentlemen.
I need to make Rambore 4 and 5.
I call you.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Club 19 at 560 WQM.
Here's a good one.
Chris says and Chris just can't stop.
How about culture clubs?
Karma Chameleon.
That song sucked ass as Chris.
And he's right.
Yeah.
Karma Chameleon.
Can you handle that?
Can you spell all these words?
Got it.
Okay.
Josh has got it.
And he's trying to get rid of it.
Let's see.
The peanut butter allergic teacher fax says.
And says.
And this is the one I've been waiting for.
I knew I'd get one that I missed.
That I overlooked.
That just has to be the all-time worst.
The one that offends me.
I mean, deep down to the to my toes.
He says whenever I hit the beginning of the unmistakable rip of Santana's smooth featuring
Rob Thomas, I'd begin to convoct as if I was given a batch of chucked peanut butter cookies
from one of my students.
Simply put, I dislike that song greatly.
Oh, man.
Woo!
Yeah.
It's that.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Carlos Santana, Elanticoito.
Let's see.
A. Had the Arabs.
His stew.
Um, raised Stevens.
A. Had the A. Rad.
Remember that very annoying.
Sure.
Yeah.
No, nobody, nobody was like all his songs were, but that one was especially annoying.
Here's another one.
Divo.
I mean, Divo.
I didn't know what Divo had a song.
Brutal.
Divo and Whippet.
Now, it says here, Whippet, Whippet, Good, which is the lyrics, but we can't say Whippet, Good.
That would, can we say that?
No.
No, we can say.
Opti.
Yeah.
No, you definitely can't say that.
So, Whippet, you got it?
I got it.
He's got it.
He's whipping it.
Let's see.
Here's one of Frank Sinatra's Strangers in the Night is the worst song of all time.
Makes me reach for a Jim Jones purple cool aid.
Have a good weekend.
Strangers in the Night.
Okay.
I find that.
I mean, I don't like it.
I don't like Frank Sinatra, but whatever.
This is a poll of you folks.
Plus, we want to make the list at least 20, 30,000 names, right?
About 30, man.
I put how long that thing is in the poll too.
You see that?
I see it.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
One great thing about the internet that I never realized in the beginning, way back when we first started doing this with air comedy years ago.
I was always considered about what we don't want to make the list too long, because we'll run out of room.
There's no such thing as running out of the room on the internet.
It just goes on through in this space from Pluto to Saturn to Uranus.
Just goes on forever.
Uranus.
How many QA and hello, minus?
Hi, I just wanted to add another song.
Go right ahead.
It's a Minoma.
I don't know who wrote it.
I don't know if you've even on the list yet.
Minoma.
Yeah, you remember that song?
I remember.
Remember that one.
No, this one was like it went to Minoma.
Oh, what is the name of that song?
Minoma.
It is?
Oh, that is one of the most...
They do commercials with it.
They use that for everything.
Yeah, it's horrible.
I think that's a brainwashing tool that's sung.
I think they're trying to grab us nuts.
Thanks a lot, pal.
Okay, man.
See?
Minoma.
Wait a minute.
Minoma.
Oh, where'd you find that?
Magic ass.
Minoma.
There's pulled a lot of his magic ass.
Minoma.
How do you spell that?
Minoma.
Oh, kill it.
Stop it.
I'm looking.
I can't even imagine where you'd like to find it.
M-E-N-A.
Oh, M-E-N.
Just like it sounds, yeah.
Minoma.
You know how to spell M-E-N, don't you?
Oh, yeah.
I sure do.
But the good part of it is it was never a hit.
So unfortunately, we can't put it on there.
It's like filler music for the Muppets, or why not?
Yeah, but he's right.
They use it all the time.
It's very, very, very annoying.
You're like a Kuzuzolo in the middle of it?
No, I do not.
No, I don't.
Why don't we put Happy Birthday on the list while we're at it?
In fact, that Kuzuzolo isn't anywhere nearly as good as the one that you did in that M&M song.
That we can't play no more.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
5, 5, 60 on E-T and T.
Well, I say we can't play no more.
How many thousand songs?
About 30 men, about 30 men.
Can't play anything anymore.
Although, it's kind of refreshing that now that we're doing the music thing, that I'm finding a few, not too many, that we can still play.
Huh?
It's a show.
Not too many, like we can still play this.
I think I might play it after the break.
I mean, then what have we come back?
It's a sad, beautiful, bright, I can't see in Christchurch.

Oh, well, I don't know what you said, but I don't think I just sounded bad.
Oh, let's see.
Well, if I didn't like it, you can just imagine all these other...
What am I looking for?
Judy in disguise.
You see, you got me all...
Just pull that out of nowhere.
How do you surprise us again?
Let's see.

103 at 560 W2M.com and over to the Humber at 4th. Thank the Lord. This fact you just sent me is even more annoying to me than it is to you if that's possible.
Nope. It says, hey Neil, I noticed that one of the banners advertising on your website was one from the Navy.
I guess you support the draft. What's this Schmidt? John and then George puts on here. This is the fourth faction this guy.
First of all, let me say it again. Okay, let's give the benefit of the doubt. And I assume he didn't hear the earlier question about that.
We have no control on Eric has no control when you have banner ads on your website. They just run in rotation from whoever is selling the banner ads, which is not us.
And number two, what is the Navy advertising Navy recruiting have to do with the draft? Can you explain that to me? No, because it doesn't.
So in other words, if we're a knight in favor of the draft, then I guess we should also outlaw all the military recruiting too.
So we can just lay down our arms like the cordettes would say and just throw in the towel and advertisement.
This has got to be about the most stupid crap. Okay, John. So save our facts paper and get a brain. Okay, go get some training yourself.
Navy recruiting banner ads on the website. If this is the most important thing that you got on your mind to send us all these factions, all I can say to some you up is I have no lie.
Yeah, that's it. It's a service. One subscribes to us service the website advertising.
Are you have to explain this to him again? Yeah, I think so. I don't think he merits this kind of response.
Okay, no, it kind of be sponsored merits is like that. And even that's too good for him. Sorry, Goldie.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Well, I'm telling you one thing. I'm really like all confused here. You know what I mean?
Well, I got a stop line with my spots and with a lot of just a little bit. I mean, I don't have to talk about it, but it kills some time while I'm driving it organized.
Or I'm really orderly with this crap. I think you like badger. No, I don't really need any food. But I just there you go. I'm all set.
Everything's out of control. Frank says anyone mentioned a song fast car by Tracy Chappen. No, but that's a good one. I think it's fast cars.
But fast cars like I said, I'm really that sure. Oh, well, I don't say. 5 6 7 0 5. What's this? You in favor of the draft? No, I'm not.
Let me say it again. Once you want to send the facts is off.
Facts Chuck Hager, okay, Republican Senator from Nebraska. He's the a mass hole. That's running around talking about bringing the draft back.
So we can go out a couple of bunch more kids over there to be slaughtered. Including some who aren't football players.
I mean, you know, that's a horrible story. But I want to say it again and they're going on and on now and CNN and the University of Arizona is having a briefing in the Arizona Cardinals.
And this is unfortunate. Okay, it said. But how about all the other people over there who die? We're lucky to even see the name.
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, what do you say? They weren't celebrities. They weren't famous. They weren't football players who turned it all that my way.
You know, again, what's it to say? Got some America for you? 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T of Verizon line. WQA.
Hello. They're going on and on and on and on about this guy. I know they got the briefing on there right now about it. It's terrible.
I mean, it's a bad thing, but he is no more important than any other one of these gentlemen or his life.
I mean, how do you commend a guy for turning down all of that money and the career to go and fight for his country?
But on the other hand, all these other people who knows what they turned on? How about the families they left behind?
How about the children that are never going to see all of this other stuff going on? We hear nothing about that.
700 and some people dead for George versus personal agenda. Right. Sickening. Sickening. And America. Sitting back. Survivor. American Idol.
There you go. You've got it, man. That's all they hear about. They can tell you, you know, William Hung.
They know all of that stuff and these people ought to be hung disgusting. Publicly specific permits this. Go ahead.
I've got three songs for you. I'm not sure if you've used these are reruns or not. Take my breath away by Berlin.
Okay. Terrible. I've had the time of my life from that dirty dancing movie. Terrible. Time of my life.
And yeah, take my breath away. It was number one, believe it or not, 1986. Holy moly. Take my breath away. You got it, Josh?
And the biggest one and I'm not sure if somebody said this already. Girls just want to have fun.
This is irritating. Terrible 1984. I said 80s had a whole slew of bad music.
In the 70s. You know, but you know, some of the 70 songs, even if they're kind of bad, if they remind you of a certain time, you're like like being eight, nine, ten years old, like,
midnight, the oasis and Billy. Don't be here. You know, kind of so, so songs, but you know, you're like, ten years old.
Times are easy and good and stuff. Right. George Bush. Exactly. Well said. Thanks a lot, pal. Cindy Lauper. Girls just want to have fun.
Wow. Ever see her and boys, George, together? Same person. Yeah, I played it. See them together. What did you really? Yeah, that is shocking.
Okay. Now here was the original list. I just want to because I'll forget about it. Oh, look at this.
Somebody added on here on this worst song that Blender list missed. This is from the Houston Chronicle.
I write the songs very manllow. We didn't put that on there. I write the songs that everybody pukes at.
Um, Bob by Hanson. We got that right. Yeah. Tough something by Chumpew on the Wumble, which we almost left off due to a oversight.
It was all that. I beg your pardon. After the delight by Starlight and Starland vocal band, Veracuda by Heart.
And Sussudio by Phil Collins. What is that? Sussudio? It's a bad song. What's wrong with Veracuda?
I have done. Look, don't get into it with me. I didn't. I like hard. I'm all hard.
Anyway, here's the 50 from, let's see, we built the city. I keep breaking heart. Everybody have fun.
That I by Wang Chung. I don't even know what that song is. Bad. Oh, do we want to put it on there? No.

I see every time they do one of these things, they always rip Cocham, I mean, it's not their usual style.
It's different. But what's wrong with Cocham, Mo? It's okay.
Chmaltese. Yeah. Illegal alien by Genesis. That song.
From a distance, but it may be there for you by the Rembrandt's WhatsApp by Furnon Blonds.
Pumps in a bump. But we can't say that by the hammer. The hammer.

I love Chicago. I'd like to. I'd like to.
I'd like to. I'd like to. Dancing on the ceiling. Lionel Richey.
If you want to put in these on it, oh, here's one. He doesn't want to put any of them on there.
Here's one you will put on there. courtesy of the red, white and blue.

We didn't start the fire. Billy Joe. Not that.
Oh, man. I hate that song. We didn't start the fire. But we should.
I hate it. Maybe really. Joe. Be like right in the middle of it.
Here we go again with the sounds of silence. I'm in a garfunkel picking on a couple of old Jews.

Oh, maybe that was an Illinois. I know was a national pull.
Tickling through debris in five caddy.
They're just going to the tornado thing in Illinois.
Well, look at that. Maybe there's a hope for scary John Curie.
Okay, maybe he's just kind of like laying low right now.
We'll butcher him up big time when we get to the convention.
And he's going to shift it in a high gear.
And then he's going to really get animated, you think?
Do you know how we hope? We hope all right.

That's it.
And thank what we ought to do is have like, he can put he can put John,

Now a phone conversation between Queen Elizabeth and the heir apparent her son, Prince Charles.
Hello.
Hello, Charles.
Yes.
It's Mom.
Oh, Mom.
What are you calling for, again, Mom?
I'm worried about you, Charles.
Mom, you can't keep calling me every day.
I'm very worried.
You call me like 10 times a day, Mom.
Been handed the newspaper here.
The Daily Mirror.
Yes.
I don't read such rubbish.
Well, did you happen to see the front page?
I didn't see it, Mom.
I don't read such rubbish.
I'll tell you.
It says, is Charles bisexual?
What is it?
It's the true, Charles.
What is the same, Mom?
Is Charles bisexual?
What does it mean by that, Mom?
It means you like the lassies and the lads.
I don't like the lads, Mom.
Don't cry, Mom.
It's true, isn't it?
Please don't cry, Mom.
It's true.
It's not true.
I knew I should have thought someone wrong
when I caught you listening to Clay Egg.
I like him, Mom. He's a good singer.
That's all it's true.
I mean, that's all it was true.
And all those Barbara Strays and movies in the collection.
No.
I love to read yet, Mom.
That doesn't make me a boy.
How's Harry?
Harry's fine.
With it?
Watching him shower right now.
Where are you crying, Mom?
It's true, isn't it?
What?
It's true.
It's not true.
You're my sex, you're...
I am not bisexual.
I don't have any sex.
The woman I'm dating, Mom, looks like a horse.
I mean, she doesn't give it to me at all.
You know that.
Is that why you go for the men?
I don't go for the men, Mom.
So it's not true.
I'm going to be the king of England.
Yeah, since you're not worried about it.
Oh, are you worried, Mom?
You're being a king and a queen.
I can't continue this conversation any longer, Mom.
All right.
My date's here.
Your date?
The committer?
Come on in early.
Who is it?
I just have a friend.
Is that committer?
It's Ernie.
Ernie, who's Ernie?
Spotbread Ernie.
Who is Ernie?
We play football together, Mom.
You don't play football.
Oh, we play games together, Mom.
I've got to go and have them.
Stop crying.
Stop crying.
Twenty past one and five sixty.
Oh, come on in, Ernie.
Let's see.
Oh, we have another mistake.
Another little crisis here.
We want to get this right, okay?
When you got four thousand names on here,
it's not easy.
Josh, I understand that.
But plus, you're a little confused.
We have a little bit of a generation gap here.
I'm looking on the list.
And one of those that has none,
which is supposed to be 98.6 by Keith.
That's somebody called him a little while ago.
We've got 98 degrees.
That's the way we call my God.
How do you like that?
That's a good idea.
My close personal friend, Nicholas Shay,
would probably take Umbridge with that too.
As with Jessica, if she knew what they'll have it meant,
Bubblehead.
Yeah.
98.6, not 98 degrees.
98 degrees was a group.
I don't very good one too, as a matter of fact,
but they're gone.
And look at that.
See, he actually could sing.
He can't act.
He goes to show that to America for you.
It was one of the few of these boy bands
who could sing who was great.
And now his songs just ain't selling.
So as a result, he's on there with his Bubblehead wife.
And they're like, I hit.
They're a smash.
They're all over the place.
Nick and Jessica.
Got it?
Yeah.
Okay, so let's see if we can't tidy that one up.
Thomas says, how is the weather in the Czech Republic,
specifically Prague, if Bush is reluctant,
that's where I'll be going to live permanently.
I'd say just fine.
It's toasty.
Not as toasty.
Not as toasty isn't the ovens.
We'll be here when Bush, if he gets in again.
For the poll, the worst I've ever heard was
Tim Buck III, Future So Bright, I got to wear shades.
What is that called?
Future So Bright, I got to wear shades.
Is it?
Yeah.
That's the name of the song?
Could just be a I got to wear shades,
but I think that's the whole name yet.
Come on.
What kind of a name is that for a song?
I don't even think I know that song.
Tim Buck III, that's called the Future So Bright,
I got to wear shades.
It was number 19 and 86.
So I don't know how you're going to get that all in there,
but there you go.
Let's hope to you.
Let's get 98 degrees straight enough, 98.6.
Get your temperature right, Josh.
And like I've said, he'd be glad to come in
and take your temperature for you.
Now let's see, girl, you got what I...
What?
Oh, I've got the...
Girl, you got what I need by...
Bismarck.
Bismarcky.
Why see Bismarcky?
Is that kind of marquey?
I think they're cousins.
It says George think back hard when old MPD drew it right.
I got the thing right.
He was dressed like Mozart at a piano.
Was it coming back to you now?
You got what I need by Bismarcky.
Was that a hit?
Yeah it was.
You sure?
Positive?
Look it up.
Are you sure?
Well that's it.
I have recognized that now.
There is the beastlies from Naples making a guest appearance on the show.
They're strumming it.
Can we say they're strumming it?
They're picking it up.
What am I looking for?
Bismarcky, here's the bingo boys.
How to dance.
Oh my god.
How embarrassing.
Bismarcky.
That's too uh,
why do we not put that on there anyway?
No.
Her?
Girl you got it.
He had one hit.
Just a friend.
That's what it's called.
That's the name of the song they're talking about.
No.
Yes.
That's the name of the song?
That's the name of the song that the faxer is talking about.
I see.
Okay, just a friend.
It was number nine in 1990 and we're embarrassed by it.
Okay, there's that one.
There's a feature so bright.
I've got to uh,
make the title a few more words long.
Heartbeat by Don Johnson.
That's a good one.
Man could he sing?
No.
Or what, huh?
No.
Here's another one.
Very sadder.
Fowler of the Green Berets.
I was annoying.
Very annoying.
Got it.
Fowler of the Green Berets.
We got it.
Good.
56670560,
pound 560 on the AT&T line.
WQA, I'm hello.
Hello Neil.
Yes sir.
I have a really bad song that I don't believe nobody's mentioned.
It's gotta be the absolute worst song I've ever heard in my life.
Okay.
Mini-Ripper Kin.
A lovely song.
Loving you.
It's on there.
Thank you.
Uh, now what about Smooth?
Did Smooth ever make it on here?
I don't know.
Well, no, we can't leave that off because I think that's going to pass it on there.
Just, huh?
And it's got one vote.
It's only got one vote.
Holy moly man.
Smooth.
Rob Thomas.
Carlos Santana, Elante Cristo.
Holy moly.
You've got to be kidding me.
Well, over the weekend, those people are reading their music.
They'll pile onto it.
WQA, I'm hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
I got one for the poll.
Okay.
99K by zero in the question marks.
Oh man.
You know, he might be right.
Who the hell knows?
What do you mean who the hell knows?
There's such a song.
96 tears, I think is what he's talking about.
Oh, well, that's what I'm saying.
A question mark on the Mysteries 96 tears.
But you never know.
There might have actually been such a song.
I don't know.
No.
What do you say?
You don't know that?
99 tears.
No, there's no such song.
Of course not.
Of course I know that.
How do you know that?
I know.
I hear it is right here.
Why?
Not.
How about we're down to Anchivic.
Eat it.
It's a parody.
I mean, they're hits.
Didn't they pray that in the, uh, all in the family?
Refighting.
No, don't put that on there now, especially.
Don't put eat it on our pool.
We don't want anybody tracing that back to us.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 because we know what a dirty mind
the FCC commissioners have.
Don't wait.
They sure do.
Oh, we know what you meant by that.
Yeah.
We know what you're talking about.
How do you QA him?
Hello?
Hey, yeah.
Is it George?
No, this is Neil.
Do you want to speak to George?
Uh, uh, those songs you've been naming.
Those are maps for pieces compared to one.
And I'm not sure I got the name right, but it was love you
by some woman who sang it.
Many of them are in the band.
Many ripperton.
Yeah, that has to be the most horrible song ever.
I mean, hit through the earth.
Okay, thanks a lot, pal.
You bet.
Sonner.
Many ripperton loving you.
Very annoying, whiny, whiny, horrible sound like scratch
the nails on a blackboard.
Well, that's what we can still play.
We can still play eight sounds that you hate.
Right.
I love that.
Well, there's one sound in there.
I don't think that's one of those sounds that they're talking about.
No, it's not.
Luckily, it is not one of those sounds.
Loving you.
Where where is it?
I know it's on there.
It's on there.
Oh, come on.
Many even do better than this.
Carmer, come here.
Short people.
Please cracker, please.
You tell me that it's not on there.
It's got one vote.
One vote.
Okay.
And then they complained about my taste in music.
Holy moly rat man.
This is unbelievable.
And especially the smooth with the Santana and Rob Thomas.
That thing, if I ever hear it again,
I will shoot somebody right now.
27 and I know you just waiting.
Yeah.
Is that a bit that we got on that or is that the bit we can't play it anymore?
What is it called?
Smooth.
Oh, it is.
We can't play it.
Wow, what does it say?
Oh, I don't say it.
Trust me.

the Algor version of the macarena.

I'll figure one thing.
CNN is hyper-revidelating on this Pat Tillman story about getting killed in action in
Afghanistan.
They're hyper-revidelating for like ever.
This is the only person that died over there.
I see that they are.
I mean just on and on and on and on and anybody else who dies over there, well they're
getting too bad.
Not to minimize any loss, but it's just a little bizarre.
Well, it's very American.
133, 27.0.2.5.
60.
Here's one.
Now this song, you'll probably disagree.
And I'm not saying that I think this is, but I guarantee a lot of people think this is
grotesque.
Oh, well, no.
I don't just like it.
It's an overplayed step, of course.
I have no life.

I'm just ripping him and asking today more than usual, because he didn't tell us about
that kiss business.
Well, why do you think he would know?
Because he's the operations manager of WQAM.
Right.
And certainly he's got the, says,
tentacles and testicles running through the building there enough.
He should have some clue what's going on with either
beastly south Florida stations, okay?

How do you like that?
It's really interesting about how he hangs around with his kids all the time.
You know what?
All his songs are about children.
He's hanging out with the children.
He just likes kids.
That's all.
A lot.
This isn't really.
Until they get a little bit too old.

WQAM, hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got one for your poll.
Okay.
Uh, it's out of the late 90s.
I don't remember who did it,
but it was called Bring Out the Games.
Oh yeah, by the Reverend Jones, huh?
By the Reverend, uh, whole.
WQAM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
The best part of it is I knew it was him immediately.
Yes, sir.
I got three.
Is that okay?
Uh, well, let's go with the first thing we'll see.
You might need some help.
Go ahead.
Okay.
Oh, oh, oh, man.
That's a fabulous choice.
WAM, wake me up before you go go.
Oh, thank you very much.
And another one is, uh, you never get away by just a image.
What is it?
Never get away by just a minute.
Never heard of it.
You know, they also go by a whole package.
Oh yeah, we're back to that again.
5 6 7 0 5 60 maybe they're actually in such a song.

No.
WQAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about every year at Christmas time?
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Was that a top 10 hit?
No.
Uh, maybe it was.
Police.

Oh, I think I just got myself lost around.
But it was.
Oh, sorry, sir.
Siapala, I apologize.
Big two.
What?
Please never, you dad.
Police.
Napier, the navier dad.
Uh, no comment.
It would be in port taste at this time.
Let's see.
Feliz Navé, Navé, dad.
Uh, guess what?
I'll give you one guess.
That's right.
I guess it was not.
It was not the hit because it was never like a single.
Oh, you know, it was on Christmas album.
Everybody put on a Christmas album.
You know, like was a Feliziano.
And, uh, uh, Bridget Bardot.
And all these other, uh,
Julio is that made albums, you know,
like Andy Garcia was on his album.
Van Cullione.
Feliz Navé, uh,
don't we have a, we have a takeoff on it.
Oh, it's police got my part.
Yes.

I think we can still play that, can we?
So remind me this Christmas.
Oh,
I think we can do that.
This is sports winning the 5.6.
And we're talking hard,
but on 5.6, the VQM coming home.
Right here at 5.6.7.
H-O-O-5.6.
Uh, coming home.
Let's be talking to Steve and Miami.
Steve, you know what me?
Warren Camatti.
Well, Crow, what do the maraments have to do
to win the World Series this year?
Oh, that's an easy one, Steve.
They got to swing the bat,
hit the bow,
hit some strikes.
Remember, the game of baseball is 50% hitting.
Hmm, that's almost half.
50% feeling, 50% pension,
and 20% managing.
But Crow, that's 175%.
What?
Don't you be questioning me?
What'd you be?
Ignat.
Be what?
Ignat.
Ignat, I said you'll be aagman.
Well, no, I'm not ignorant.
Boy, I played ball,
fetching a baseball
in a third world country against men half my size.
Did you?
Well, actually, I...
Not even an ed!
I played it.
Not even an ed!
Are you gonna...
Not even an ed!
Can't even an ed!
BOOM!
Come on, me homie.
I'm the Crow.
Out of the gate, Steve.
Elemental P!
145 and 560.
WQM, Madraw, coming along at two.
We got the draft stuff going heavy duty,
but we...
Oh, yeah.
The Mars, the big day.
Everybody's on the edge of their seat.
Can you feel the draft?
I'm feeling it.
I mean, that's why you got that swollen package.
Anyway, two entries for the pull.
Rock Me Amidest,
US inversion by Falco,
simply horrible, horrible.
The record company didn't even bother to translate the lyrics, it says.
And...
P-Y-T, pretty young thing by Michael Jackson.
That was a hit.
Yeah, it was.
Come on.
You just picking on poor Mikey again.
Yeah, well, for fun.
Let's see.
Michael Jackson, well, is this gonna take up pages and pages and pages in here?
Eyes in brother.
Michael Jackson, here's like, uh, what am I looking for?
Pretty young thing.
I don't even know that song.
You're lucky.
I'm sure if I heard it and I sure hope I don't.
You're telling me that was a hit?
Yes.
Or guess what?
Wrong.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Right.
Look under P-Y-T.
I'm looking for P-Y-T.
I'm looking for LM and OP like the, uh,
crosses there and ain't there.
P-Y-T.
Ain't there pretty young thing.
It's not under P-Y-T or pretty young thing.
It ain't under Michael Jackson.
Now, let me look back on their alphabetical since you want to make a big
stimulus about this.
Yes.
No.
The answer is no.
Now what year was this event?
80 something.
No, there was not like when?
80 something.
Not a top 40 hit.
Sorry.
Well, lucky.
I like that.
It was a stiff.
So sorry.
Five six.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm going to go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, guess what I'm looking under.
Oh, Michael.
I'm looking under, uh, Janet Jackson.
Look at that.
Damn thing popped out again.
Uh, Ben.
Oh boy.
Ben.
Now, how come we don't have that on there?
Ben, a song about a rat.
Yeah.
Love song about it.
Oh, I'm so glad that we found Ben.
Uh, here it is.
Pretty well.
It made number 10.
It wasn't like a big smash, Brandon.
And you put it on every P-Y period.
Y period T-P-Y.
You got it?
We got it.
We've got the period.
And then Ben.
If there's a worst Michael Jackson song than that,
I ain't never heard it.
Boy.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T
and Verizon wireless line.
So many bad songs.
So little time.
Oh, guess what I find?
Hey, ladies and gentlemen,
the poster.
Come away with the retail every Thursday and Friday night.
Tomorrow night at the retail and point of park.
It's Eddie and the showman.
The chandelves and starring hitmakers,
Janet Dean, but their latest Friday night
is Eddie and the showman.
The blazers with Kathy Marshall,
Queen of the Circuit,
are and starring Ralph Robin in the Parley.
The retail located Stanton,
President Lundlock, Easton,
not very far and point of park.
Tomorrow night, Janet Dean,
Friday night, Brown, Rob and the retail.
Be there on RV Square.
How do you like that?
Okay.
Well, the reason I played this
is because Jan Berry just died here a couple weeks ago.
I mean, you had some really marginal
Janet Dean songs.
Is there any other kind?
But, uh, so that's like a little tribute there.
It's on a distant vocal branch.
Somebody listened to it in my spare time.
And speaking of Janet Dean,
what about sidewalk surfing?
What's wrong with that?
Oh, come on.
Are you crazy?
Sidewalk surfing and what's, uh,
other Janet Dean stuff?
Well, that's good enough.
How about the Night Chicago Diet?
Somebody says paper lace wasn't it?
Yes.
The Night Chicago Diet.
Let's get that on an S-A-P-S-A-Craft.
We're in Noin.
Committee Q-A-M. Hello.
What about you?
Yes, sir.
That's speaking Neil.
Speaking.
Neil, I want for your free fall.
Okay.
Cocomole by a beach boy.
Beach boy.
Cocomole.
Okay.
No.
We're already been over that ground, right?
I mean, we can put it on there.
It was on that other top.
If you let's put it on there,
we're going to give him something to offer.
Okay.
What do you say?
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Cocomole.
Cocomole with the two Ks.
WQ-A-M. Hello.
Hi.
I've got a phone for your poor.
Okay.
Dominique by the seeing none.
Dominique.
Thank you.
Do we put that on there or not?
I think we did.
Somebody mentioned it earlier.
It takes forever to find, you know what I'm saying?
They played that man.
They played it almost.
It's enough to make you want.
And just, oh 98.6.
Nice going there.
If we got that straightened out.
Is Dominique on there?
I don't see it.
Do you see it?
I don't see nothing.
Blue on blue.
Kissed on my list.
Kissed this.
He wants to kiss this.
I don't think we can say that.
We don't have Dominique on there.
And this guy's going to be very upset
and rightfully so.
And other people called in.
They're going to be coming and not going to do it
down on the station.
Okay.
Especially Monday when kiss goes urban jazz
Hawaiian melodies.
Whatever they're playing.
All done.
All day.
You're going to play all home music.

How come I enjoy that so much?
WQAM.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
Pretty good.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
I've listened to you at various times today
and decided that your list cannot possibly
completely complete without the song
feelings or having my baby.
They're both on there.
Well, they are.
Oh darn it.
Do they have a baby?
You'll be pleased.
You'll know.
Don't say that.
You'll be pleased.
No feelings is number three right now.
And having my baby is number.
It's in the top.
Doesn't are both doing nicely.
All right.
I appreciate it.
I'm going to have to brought you to
Projigia.
All right.
Thank you.
Not what's not to like.
Thanks a lot, man.

WQAM.
Hello.
Yes.
Neil.
Hold on.
Yes, sir.
Let me meet my radio.
Okay.
Yes.
Neil.
I have a request.
No more bad songs.
I'm going to slip my wrist.
WQAM.
Hello.
Not there.
I'm on to QAM.
Hola.
Hola.
Buenos tardes.
Afternoon.
Got a good song.
Okay.
Let's hear this one.
Chris Cross.
Christopher Cross.
Stanley.
The best.
Outstanding.
Thank you.
Okay.
That another one.
They play Chris Cross.
Man, he needs to be on the cross.
See?
A little note.
In fact, it's kind of hard to nail him down.
Like somebody said about who was who they interviewing?
Oh, that's the priest this morning on I miss.
He was all bent out of the shape because Chris Matthews never showed up.
I will say this much about I miss.
Even though he can't understand where he's saying he's seen Alan Deadman.
He sure is how Rips and B.C.
and rightfully so with their 20 or 30 viewers.
About 30, man.
Rips, Chris Matthews and S.
I mean, when he had father agree on there talking about the
Mel Gibson movie and father Greeley says, well, you know, it's hard to describe
Jesus kind of hard to nail down.
I mean, it was so obvious.
I mean, it's right there for the pickings, you know.
And because Chris Matthews wasn't listening to a word he said,
he was stupid.
Making noise, which is what Chris Matthews does best,
which is why I wanted to many reasons why nobody watches MSNBC.
Slide in local.
Here's sports video 560, QAM.
QAM.
Did he say?
Welcome.
Welcome to America.
Still the doom special we blow, at blow,
That that's going to the belt again, you know the talkin' Robin.
Oh, really?
Stop it Robin, holy heart of hell!
That man has really got his hands pulled again tonight.
Great situation.
That's what we're doing to acid, a seedy mist.
Batman says the Robin got to tell you this.
I'm tired of saving you and a per single show.
Harry will wear the costume got to let you go to the talkin' Robin.
It looks bad Batman man.
Stop it Robin, holy gama-lickin' boy,
it's under his butt, look again, good night.
Oh, this guy's married by the man, what it's being?
Probably the best show on his TV, PSMe.
Anyway, the worst hit song top 40 of all time is
Aki Breaky Heart.
I mean, there's a list here if this doesn't keep you busy
or we can and of course all the draft stuff,
what, what, what could you like?
Although draft is not probably a really good word to be
sin out loud these days.
Not out loud.
Aki Breaky Heart 103, Macarena 86,
Feelings 40, Morris Albert, man, it is just,
he needs to be a Chris Cross.
Who let the dogs out 37?
Disco Duck 33.
Debbie Boone, you let up my life 32.
Don't worry, be happy 28.
Tiptoe to the Tour of 20, he's still dead.
We built the city 17, have in my baby 16,
ice ice baby 15, evidence I've read 13 seasons
and the sun doesn't.
Then single digits for these boots are made for walkins got nine.
Man, he's got eight, very mantel over the big one, schnauz.
Turn between two lovers eight, butterfly kisses eight.
Don, cachain seven, way Newton continues wet
of a paper sack, and he talks to his teeth.
He sings to his teeth.
So there's a little message for it there, Josh.
People who talk through their teeth are one thing,
but when they actually sing through their teeth,
that's the next step after that.
So if you want to emulate way Newton, just keep it up.
If not, the bootchup a little bit.
Man, dogs coming up next to Humper, no big, oh!
Today that's the top news of the day.
Bye, bye, bye!
The Roger Show, I'm rising to the Institute of Ryan for learning.
I've been doing this a long time.
