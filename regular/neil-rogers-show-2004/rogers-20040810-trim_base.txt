The most intimate breakdown is real struggle.
Will thisroll stop and return?
Well, these are numbering giant losers as striER the star of the Earth's planet Virgo.

more, he's on the ticket. Maybe with John Kerry. He's on the ticket
starting September 1, ESPN radio. Just so we need another sports station.
Right, can there be too many? Well, I think what we need now, we need to have another
sports station for all the people getting dumped off QA end and that make good
idea. Since you can't get my rear end. Right, don't go. Well, we'll leave that up to
Duff, okay? Duff is a Duff Lindsay is in Naples today and maybe tomorrow for
sexual orientation retraining to prepare him for being Duff the Duff Monkey.
I don't know if I should have said that because it's sound like it might have something to do
with that and we should have to say that. Duff the, now I see, there you go again.
You just can't get to it. I haven't had that for a minute yet. Yeah, blow this. Oh,
God almighty. What a lunatic. What a maniac. So anyway, every time I go on vacation, the stuff
hits the fan. Now you can play that. Right, there it is. That was the stuff hit the fan.
Right. As Greg Reed just continues when we everything was going along so fantastically.
Well, number one and men, everybody's kicking ass and now let's just and don't get me wrong.
I'm all excited about Howard Stern coming. I've not taken back anything. I ever said about him
or that show, but I'm delighted for a multitude of reasons. You know, in life, you have to look
at the positives and the negatives, right? Right. And I don't see any downside for us.
We get the best lead in morning radio in America. There's no question about that. I mean,
make my cup of tea. I'm not going to be listening. I'm sure you aren't either. And even Josh
Cortes there might, I don't know, I'll be able to do it a little bit only because I want to make
sure that there's a uniform standard, you know, no, no, I'm not playing that game. We'll like to
dump the Duff Monkey. You worry about that. Duff Leopard, whatever he's going to be doing.
Now, I'm not playing that game. Don't start trading into that territory if you're a wise man.
See what I'm saying? Well, I'm not. You let Duff and the Howard handle that together again,
end the Robin and all those people. And in addition to which, of course, Howard Stern ends his show
whenever he feels like it. Like 10, I think 10, 25, 10, 30, 10, 45, maybe 11 o'clock. Oh,
ran. Of course, I don't bother me now because my motto is less work and more pay. That's subbed
in my motto for a long time. So I have only this to say. All right. Although it would have been nice,
it would have been done the right way if people would have been consulted and discussed with
intelligently and openly and honestly like adults, but that's not the great, and that's not the
great read if and way. Everything always has to be subversive and behind closed doors and sprung
as a big surprise. And it's a big, deep dark secret. Although I didn't know about it a week before
you did. I will say that. And did I do a good job of keeping it secret? Yeah, never called me once.
I didn't call you several things, but not about that. Just like we also run depending on the death
for discussing the suspension of on our radio station, we absolutely cannot discuss
any of that. Now we can mention the fact see it bothers me a lot. Some of you are real
wishes that we got on this station, including Big Bo camp or there. And then the big, he's just
a total sellout. Any of people kissing his ass this morning, oh man, that was disgusting.
Well, when you're going to have your own show of a, and he had that the professional sports
nerds, farce your collar, Carl, you know the one I'm talking about? I don't. Yeah, him on for about
15 minutes made me almost pining for one from little Havana. Oh, good. No, seriously, these
chronic colors, man, they're just a killer. Maybe Faeray ran into one of them.
King Kong, damsel, Faeray is dead, but you know how old she was? 96. 96. The Ventus Days.
Big eighth, big building at a big settle lungs is what it says here. Wow, they were at that day.
She died Sunday at her man hat in the apartment, close friend Rick McCay, director of her last film
founder. He found her dead. Few cinematic images have had the iconic staying part of a shrieking
lawn squeezed in the mighty Prave, a giant gorilla, as he climbs at the top of the Empire State building.
But by the way, let me say this to you, if you had a whole bunch of terrorist warnings and
thought that all these buildings in New York were going to be like any second now that we're going
to have a terrorist attack, when you reopen the statue of Liberty for the first time since 9-11,
that sounds like what I need to meet. And I'd send my light there to the ceremony. And I have all
those helicopters, your twoers over the city too, especially since we think that helicopters are
going to be used by Al-Qaeda, but nevertheless, the Harry Star of King Kong, 1933's classic
clash of man versus nature might have been optimized as screened, but audiences were as mesmerized as
Kong himself by the squirming and sexy Faeray, who has beauty enchanted the beast despite her
piercing screams of terror. She died Sunday in New York at age 96. She began to create a
silo there, appeared more than 70 films, and that's all you want to know. Faeray, she's dead.
Now, David Curtin time, we got Joan Severance, and George came up with a fairly amusing line
before to show, he said we're going to give Joan a Severance package, is what he said.
Oh, it's a good idea.
Oh, it's a good idea.
Oh, it's a good idea.
That's that way.
I saw he made pretty well on your pool the other day, about who ought to team up with Mo
in the afternoon in case so, well, we can't do that.
What's the bad idea?
A fantasy pool, you understand.
All right, but I interrupted myself before, which I have a bad habit of doing, and that is all
you whooshes on this radio station. At least mention the fact that Mo Howard David is
filling in for a Hank Glover. You don't have to mention the suspended Hank Glover, because
they get real nervous about that. But at least mention that he's still alive. Okay, he's still
fat. He's still around, and he's still alive, all right? I'm here in Boat Camp, or in the,
I don't know about Mad Dog. Mad Dog will be under the one of his rare cameo appearances. He's
not even less than I am. And of course, I guess after that stellar month of June he had in the
Brookheat, a gigantic June. All his relatives must have had diaries. Do you see that?
Yep. He was a little uno on the station in those two hours of June.
Huh?
Being out of the door.
Probably because Curtis was on a lot, I think.
Jones Severance born December 23rd, 1958, which makes her 45 going on 46 right around
Christmas time. Xmas. The last sunset, the movie she's making right now, it's in post-production,
in case anybody cares, do you care? No. Not at all. Well, this particular day we got to
hurt was quite some years back on behind our beaded curtain. If you're over the age of 95,
you got 17 forms of ID and John Ascroft, and going to roll his eyes too much.
And keep your hands under the, or over the working keeping yourself.
Mystery woman on TV, cause of death, the last deduction, the next wave, the love boat.
Oh, no wonder I didn't like her. Life of the party, the Pamela Hermann story, in dark places,
a matter of trust, black scorpion, two aftershock, profile from murder, and a whole bunch of
bait for TV. She had a zillion, I would tell you. About 30,000 different movie and TV credits,
and there she is, Jones Severance. What I say she had, measurements by the way, 34, 34,
C, 23, 35.
And whatever happened all of those rumors too, about the that group ball.
What group ball?
34, C, that was you, that, that, that, that.
Yeah, what about that? Never heard anything.
Yeah, you did. Don't you remember that was the part of the new progressive,
Al watched the whole thing? That was, that was, uh,
baseless stuff. It was all about your crap. I'm going to come back and hear everybody's ass.
Wow, wow, wow. Oh, I was glad to tell you he's going to be most sidekick.
Oh, that's right. He's not going to have a sidekick, because he's only filled to fill in.
He's only to fill in in. Although, D-fo is the rumor, but nevertheless,
we don't want to put out a lot of stuff on the air.
And I just wish my good friends well. Okay. I hope they get, uh,
they're just desserts, you know what I'm saying? Everybody should get what they deserve. Isn't that what I thought?
I hope the good people get the good stuff and the bad people get the evil that they deserve.
Well, I don't want to mention the beesleens or anybody like that.
I do want to mention that Moe Howard David had a year and a half left in his contract when they
started Howard's turn for the morning. And the since somebody else had only a couple of months left
in his contract that may figure in their summer. I don't know. I'm going to can't talk about it though.
Now there's an article by Greg Cotex, who's a real major
bull in the, uh, heraldous morning. How will Ricky repair the team? Well, we, I don't give a flying
crap about Ricky, okay? But there are a couple of interesting things in here, huh? You don't.
No, I don't. I don't give a flying crap about or Ricky. How do you like them apples, huh? How do
you like them the hot tamales? Or before we do the red code tech stuff? Greg, you're an
imbecile man. Maybe it goes with the name, you think? That must be the most good going around. It's
the most good going around. George is poor yesterday. Twin sex. Now you must have been thinking about
this when you saw the picture of those identical twins on the back that I have, uh,
made up on the wall where? What's their name? I don't know. Just a joke. You're not the, but I
I got that calendar. Right. It's covered up though. Twin sex is great, but only if it's too hot,
chicks, 845 people said that. Disgusting insects. I have an insect insects. Yes, they are.
185. Great, but only if it's too hot guys. 54. Okay, if they're identical, but not in
for eternal 45 and okay, if it's for eternal twins of the opposite sex, 25 out of 1154
of hosts, what prompted that for? Uh, who's sisters? Yeah, sure. Why not? Oh, seriously, well,
prompted there's a twin angle on the big brother show this. That a big brother show. Yeah,
they got some hot girls. Oh, man. And so I got the idea of the hot girls doing it. Although the
best ones will do. So Greg context writes in his own incipit way in the middle of these little
bullet points because he's got nothing to say. He says notice how it's been a lot less windy lately
or is it that Hank Goldberg's been off the air? Talk about hitting the guy while he's down,
talking about a gratuitous shot. Nice go on, Greg. You imbecile. You simple, simple, simple,
idiot. Speaking of which, he says with Howard Stern about to join the Aronters in lineup,
shouldn't we stop referring to WQM as an all sports station? Let me ask you this. Do we ever
refer to QM as an all sports station? No, they do. No, they do, but what do we care? He says,
shouldn't we stop referring to QM as an all sports station? Let me say to this to you, Greg
context and also Jim Sarni and Barry Jackass, all you other professional sports nerds out there.
Oh, we just have to have sports on sports sports. What's for 24 hours a day of full crap? It's the
most boring garbage man. Just like this morning, I'm hearing the big oh, rambling on there and
is boring monotone about the dolphins, this and the dolphins that nobody lucky to win seven games
and they want that's a curl and all this other stuff, which we already know that and Ricky,
Ricky, Ricky, you know, maybe we can get the rest of them to play a football. What do you think?
It's been discussed. Line is fat head up there right on the line. He could be the center
of attention. 10, 13 at 5, 60 WQM, you're really screwed up. Not all sports anymore station starting
August 16 with Howard Stern in the morning. He can go as long as he wants. If he wants to go on to
145 sounds good to make. Just get those texts in there, clearance. You know, when you're moving

We're supporting you five CC QAM.
Oh, good off this instant.
Welcome.
Every day's a news is morning. We have a yellow light that must be. They have something to
tell us. That's how they are. They have something to make it by. So it's really empty.
Kind of superb. You just do something like a yellow light.
Oh my god. The corporate be a light. And that's why if we have a yellow light, can't
explain the meaning of what these lights do. My toe, which is at his best with a set of
clothes and their noodles start to move. And they can't say what is it feels to
do. They have a yellow light with that. Something they can't define. That's why we have a yellow
light of these lights.
Hey, if I have 60 WQM, I have a lot of stories about that. We're sure you talk about exhaustively
about the helicopters like I said. Yeah, a little bit. Not about the helicopter.
How about the leak about this guy, this is Mohamed Nur Khan. They're foaming at the mouth
in Europe about that, especially the Brits. I do want to repeat something I've said a
million times. Your Brits are a bunch of silly twists. I have never until this last European trip,
which will be my last for a long time. I'm just burned out. A lot of Europeans really stink.
But at any rate, the Brits are just so silly. It's pathetic. And Rupert Murdoch has taken
that sky news thing to a new level. There's a right wing news for about three minutes out of each
hour. And the rest of it is all stupid ass sports, cricket and a football. That's with the U
of course. Soccer in the cricket and cricket and rugby and soccer and cricket. And that's it.
That's all I talk about. Man, then there was a story about 130 cocklers got rescued over the weekend.
A good pardon. Yes, cocklers. What's that? I have no idea. They, I guess they're like oyster
fishermen. I don't know. They go out through in the water. They search for something. They
like to use your own imagination. Okay. What the shells I would have met. Is that what it is?
What are our cockles shells? Well, here I'm showing you. No, seriously, what are they?
Oh, but that one, I think maybe you got your thumb on it. Maybe that's what that is.
I was drinking something. Don't they mention that? I don't know. All I know is the brits just
make me nauseous and man. They're like, oh, I'm a wild and you're wrong thing. Just disgusting.
That guy to call that day about the great British cuisine. You should live so wrong, Pellie.
Man, no more man. Go eat your bangers and mashing it lost. I think cocklers kind of clam.
More victims of Hoosier Radio HOPE service. I want to get too many of these insurious stories
on here right off the bat. We don't want to offend those people that have been obtained by the
Shmear the Queer and so on. And notice you brought that one back again. Another cool one.
Very similar. Yeah, you did. I don't know what that was on them. Huh? It was something about
toll wrestling and finger pop out of the manliest man contest. Oh, is that what it was? Yeah.
To determine the manly. I never have too much Shmear the Queer.
Lastly, investigators in Indianapolis filed six felony counts. Three each for criminal confliment
and identity deception. Have you heard this story? No. Against Richard Brown. Yeah.
For a luring people to his house under the guise of a radio contest. That's his name.
Now the ground is facing 14 new felony charges. A several of victims that come forward. Brown
allegedly phoned the victims off for them 50 grand of a new car while posing as an employee of
MSCHR radio station WNOU radio now. After arriving at a suspect victims all may over to remove
their clothing and put on a very small t-shirt. Sounds like an idea. He got from Duff.
Authorities believe there may be more victims who are too embarrassed to come forward. Brown was
already on home detention for a recent criminal confliment conviction. The scam surface July 29,
when a man who went to Brown's residence noticed his ankle monitor. He told police that the doors
were locked when he tried to leave. But he eventually was able to get out and drive away.
Yeah. Take off your clothes and put on a really t-shirt about two sizes, two thnauls.
And I will see what happens from there. Here's today's poll speaking of that. Speaking of Richard Brown.
I love that thing about Duff the dump lucky. I guess you've already discussed this on here.
Well, we didn't discuss who it was going to be. Well, we know that there were big deep dark
secreties. See, this is what happens at QAIM. Anytime I get what he's spranted calls,
it's either Duff or Duff and Clarence together. Never Greg, of course, because Greg does not today.
He's too nervous to confabulate with me. He's not on my level. He's an idiot.
Not that Duff and Clarence are on my level, but never to lesser anybody else's level for that matter.
I get what his breathless calls. Oh, there's his top secret. Don't say a word. And then it's either
in Barry Jack as his column the next morning, or everybody in the building is talking about it.
You know, just like the thing about Moe and D from Moeful, right? The Moe and D foe show. Moeful.
What else would you call it? Because I think that fits into it. Hey, Moeful, you money.
Here's our poll today. What South Florida vent of the past year do you think was the most important?
What South Florida event of the past year do you think was the most important?
Clear Channel Dumpshoward Stern. WDQM brings back Howard Stern. Next Monday,
August 16, by the way, 6-2, or whenever he gets done. The heat gets shacked.
Ricky Williams retires. The Marlins win the World Series. Or now we allow to talk about the Marlins
anymore. Not. I'll go ask. Yeah, go get a memo from Joyce over there in Naples.
Let's do any manager. Joyce is probably busy orienting muff.
Okay, and the last choice on our poll, Howard David fills in for Suspended Hank Goldberg.
Let me read that one again. Howard David fills in for Suspended Hank Goldberg. That's the last
of our choices. There might be some other big things happening in the last year in South Florida.
Maybe an oversight. We'll find out. From our audience, since I see we have just tremendous
number of calls coming in, don't we? Yep, we've been there for so far this summer.
Brutal. What do you mean by that? I'll just mostly crakes either. No, come on. Okay.
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Howard Spurmer has come at a QM
starting this Monday. And you mean to say these lines are in full minute amount?
Have a kid had a lot of conversation about that? Yeah, how's Neil going to feel about having
a way to come on? I think it's great. I hope he goes on to like 155.
Right. Sounds good to me. Line 9, WDQN, hello.
My daddy was going nice. Okay, good. WDQN, hello.
Neil. Yes, sir. Welcome back. Where's your great job?
Thank you very much. He's taking a break.
Very much for clearing off what the heck is going on in that patient.
We have an old question answer that you just gave him.
Yes. Thank you very much. Love you very much.
Okay, you're welcome. Okay, there you go. Oh, and speak it up. I got to tell you a little story.
Okay. I don't want to digress, but this made me so nauseated.
I'm out at Woodbine because you know playing my slots like the old bag that I am.
And there for whatever reason, I've told you the Chinese travel impacts.
Yes, there's always a lot of past. You sure have protection there.
And a lot of Italians for whatever reason, I don't know if they're tourist is,
or they're from where we have a huge Italian Italian travel into mob.
Is that what you're saying? That might be it.
But at any rate, so I'm sitting on my machine the other day, and here comes this family.
They're always in groups. Here's Mama Sita and the daughter. You would like the daughters.
She's a little bit too young, probably about, I don't know, so I'm waiting to see what's going on.
I can see it looks like a little like Christine Aguilar, only cuter.
I'm patient. But at any rate, and so they're playing wheel,
I'll report you right next to me. Okay?
Now, Mama sits down and of course the Avuela is sitting there too.
I don't know what they call it in the Tadiano, but Grandma Ma, she's sitting there.
And it's about four of them. And now the little girl who's about 17,
she's hanging on a mama who's playing the machine like Stink On The Duff.
Okay? And she's going big bucks, big bucks.
And I'm picking it myself. If I ever doubted the impact of television destroying the minds of people
all around the world, no, no, seriously, big bucks, big bucks.
And she's not even spinning the wheel at this point. She's just playing the all on the lines.
She's just doing the big bucks, and then she would kiss her on the cheek.
I mean, this girl must have kissed her mother about every minute for long.
You know what I'm saying? Buck Luck. What is that?
I don't know. Maybe I'm not sure. What is that all about?
Big bucks. Oh, brother, it was the most, and then I'm thinking to myself, just lose.
You know, just lose, go away.
And then that's the immediate thing comes to my mind.
Lose real fast. Don't get any spins.
And they've got to spin.
Oh, big bucks, big bucks.
Big bucks.
Yeah, big bucks.
Oh, brother. Take your TV and put it in the bottom of the pool.
Do everybody a favor, please?
Well, listen, when you got the award-winning lineup we got now on QAM and all the good stuff right on.
That we can't talk about.
I'm not even looking at this.
This is for 20 of my 16.
QAM.
What a joke.
What an embarrassment.
Ricky will you say goodbye?
244.
Hey, stop it.
Oh, Ricky, I can't do this.
I want us to go to a maze and slip your crack with my breezy nose.
But you rather slow-pissed with now uppulling up my thigh for the season.
Gosh, my heart's a便 witness.
Here's where I'll be my eyes.
For no one cares a reason.
And I'd bust up the bush.
There's a way, see, in my trailer.
And then I find you no longer here
And down to the beau light set the helljar
Enter the hearts of all the sports сотрудings.
Oh, no go, theyought and sang.
Now, he's over-done.
If you're joys,
I've walked in my mouth on a Happy-Fort一些
The facts and likes for the radio don't leave us like this.
Now only the shats for us we can hear it.
Welcome.
By the way, a beautiful video there on our website.
Where did we get that?
The Ricky Williams attribute video?
Oh, we stole it from somebody else, you know.
That's a beautiful thing.
Sure, it's from what is it?
ScrewRicky.com?
Yep.
ScrewRicky.com?
That's the place.
Maybe that's what Duff is working on over there in Naples with Joyce.
By the way, Joyce, bite me.
Okay, that's my message to you, honey.
Loser.
What she knows about broadcasting, you couldn't have been in the fumble and have room for a
hank's ass.
How do you like that, Joyce?
How do you like them fat apples?
I was sorry.
So we go.
So let's take a look at what we got here.
I think this is going to be, I think you're right.
I think everybody is on vacation, including everybody inside the building.
In addition to which, like I said, Greg being the expert at doing the old Humpty Dumpty
routine when things get going real good, he breaks the egg into a million pieces and
try to put them back together again.
We got Howard Stern coming and we got us on the air whenever we're good and ready, whenever
where Howard feels like it every day, which is fine with us.
And then we got the highly rated mad dog, it too, I believe.
Oh, right.
He shows up whenever he feels like it.
Now he's such a star.
He'll be on today.
Jim Mad Dog Mandage will be on it too.
And then at four, of course, till six, thirty, it's more Howard David, filling in for the
suspended Hank Goldberg.
And then you got the Marlins on brackets, six, thirty, the Marlins host the Cardinals,
seven, oh, five, the night, Marlins kind of in a lot better than I said that, huh?
Probably get sued or something.
And then you're on the way to the baseball game.
Well, I can't say the Marlins are like only five hundred and like seven and a half games
out of first place and really kind of like a floundering like me.
In fact, the Marlins it seems to me, I could be wrong, Josh Cordis, but it seems to me that
their worst problem is when they play a crappy team, Montreal and Arizona, two of the worst
teams in history of baseball.
Yeah, and when they play those teams, they like to lose almost every game.
I think they lost like six in a row to Montreal.
That's right.
Something like that.
See, you have a little faith, but don't worry, St. Louis is in first place, so we'll
beat them.
Oh, there you go.
The best record in baseball, the Cardinals will be in town, and I see a better go over
there and watch the game, all ten of you.
Thirty-one votes on the poor, pretty weak.
What software did it have in the past year?
Do you think was the most important?
The Marlins win the World Series 10, the Heat Gits track nine, WDQ embriors back Howard
Stern nine, third channel dumpster five, Mohar David, it fills in for suspended Hank
Goldberg five, and Ricky Williams retirees only three.
Well, that's pretty shocking in it.
Why is that?
What do you think I'm in the Alla, Ricky Williams fewer there was there, even Bush never saw
a fewer like that, even when he was sitting there looking at Rumsfeld's picture.
Come in the QA and hello.
All right, I'd like to see the Neil.
Speaking.
Yeah, how you doing?
All right.
Hey, I used to listen to your show back in the late 90s, while on the time when I
P.We got caught doing the thing up in the cinema, up in the road.
Great.
And yeah, I just moved back to Florida from the military and nice to hear you.
George Wings, you want a great job and good to hear you.
Okay.
Thanks for the good news.
Whatever you're talking about.
5.670, 5.60, Tom P.W. is in Surahs, Florida by the way.
WDQM, hello.
What's up, Neil?
Yes, sir.
Let me ask you a quick question.
And I agree with you.
In an evolving position, I would agree with you the same way that you said that it's
Howard ends up at 1.59 PM.
You could care less.
159.45 sounds good to me.
But let me ask you something.
Because I've never heard you go from 10 to 3 because you would never do that.
Does he have more money because over or what is his motivation to like more than a
night?
No, he's got a big ego.
That's his motivation is he's the community university.
And he goes to the police.
Okay, I work for free.
Huh?
When you're making the kind of money that he's making about 30 million a year, you're
not working for free, Pally.
Figure it out by the minute.
That's a good idea.
I appreciate it making you feel you think.
Okay, see you.
Oster came you'll be this.
Yeah, Howard's working for free for $330 million.
That's a bargain.
Yeah.
In fact, I'll give you one of my Corvette's free for $40 grand.
How's that for you?
5.670, 5.60, Pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Are you right?
We got the little Corvo Julio sitting out there and we're having a circle jerk and that's
about it.
Oh, we're about to start again.
WQAM Line 9.
Hello.
Where do you see the America?
WQAM on Line 2.
Next.
Hello.
QAM.
Going once.
Going twice.
He's been calling every day.
Who's that?
The quiet man.
The whisperer.
Oh, that's good.
I'm glad he's still alive.
I'm second thought.
WQAM.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How's it going?
All right.
Have you personally talked to Hank in the past couple of weeks?
No, I have not.
Have I not?
No, I have not.
Man, I want a handbag.
That is ridiculous.
The one with the big car, they just run them off.
And then closing.
Shumra Bui.
So reports are about the action and show more cranks than anyone could ever have expected
including one.
Yeah, and he doesn't really like you know because the concentration is a different.
For the people who are awake.
People are awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
They're not awake.
The North Florida, the past year, do you think was the most important?
We've got a pretty Paul Tree number here.
67 votes.
I don't think there's anybody in town.
You're right.
I thought that June and July, like from the middle of June till the end of July.
But I think maybe August from now till Labor Day is like the death Valley days.
It sure am I right?
The Doldrums.
The Doldrums.
67 votes.
Tomorrow's the Winter World Series 23.
WQM brings back Howard Stern.
Next Monday, by the way, August 16.
A dozen.
The Heakhead Shack 11.
More Howard David had fills in for the suspended Hank Goldberg 9.
Clear Channel Dumps Howard Stern 7.
And Ricky Williams, who tears only five.
Probably the Doldrum people got peeled when they heard me make that intempered comment
about that chronic carol that was on with the big this morning.
Or more likely nobody was listening to the big morning because he's just terminal and
dope along on the air to even to say hello and goodbye.
He is just brutal.
Get him off of there, Clarence, you idiot.
Oh and Gildi, by the way, speaking of the odd man out, was on vacation this week which
it seems like everybody's on permanent vacation except Erosmire.
Gildi is still going to be hanging around.
He's going to be doing a little of this in the Panthers games that they were playing in which
that ain't looking too good for his season this year.
That's looking really, really slim and grim.
But he'll be just kind of like hanging around like a rose sound.
After all, we didn't have Gildi who could go like that or, huh?
Yeah, have to probably have a little turkey neck.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Morning, Gildi.
Yes, sir.
I wanted to find out what do you think where America will be in November 2008 after the Bush
win at the second time?
What do I think of what?
The West Bank.
Where will we be in November 2008?
Where will be?
I know where you'll be burning in hell hopefully.
Roasting, roasting and toasting like a human marshmallow.
20 to 11 at 5.60 W-Q-A-M.
Oh, by the way, David Ross, you're still a real f***hole.
That was nice out.
I'm...
We obviously got that from one of the inside, one of our inside.
I don't know what you're talking about.
About the third man.
That cheek channel.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm going to be telling you to put one of those confidential memos out.
You can be sure of the on our website on yourwudgers.com.
And red on the earth, which is right.
And red on your numerous tools.
How about that wall of men?
I thought you'd be interested about that.
Trying to rationalize about how Ron and Old Paul are going to be just perfect for the more.
Ron and Old Paul, who lost half a Howard's audience in the morning in the first book.
In addition, which couldn't even be Jinks and Stinks there from Jacksonville,
but at Redneck Cowboy Advice Show, that's on Zeta, Dixie and Pixie.
Yeah, Dixie and Pixie, right.
God, beat up by them on Zeta.
How do you like that?
So Ron and Old Paul, just try to rationalize as always.
Let's face it, David.
You're an old toad is what you are.
You're a silly old toad.
That's what Norm Kent told me.
Silly old clown.
And I scroll with a revolutionary programming with Randy on tape.
And Al Franken doing his snooze, what is that to see?
S to show how to go over big and little Havana.
Oh, you must have heard it then.
No, I just heard the day this.
Well, no, I did see it on TV.
I told it in the committee.
The committee, though.
The recredit convention.
And he was whining and he never answered the quay.
And it was a whineoff between him and what's his name there on CNN.
And he'll, that performance was spectacular.
Here in the ground.
That is right here.

Here's sports radio 560-CUA-M!
Difficult place. People are tense, rude and irritable.
But now there's hope.
It's the Teresa Heinz carried book of etiquette.
Here's your chance to learn from one of the etiquette trendsetters of our day.
If someone irritates you, take a deep breath, smile at them and they rip the heart out.
But Teresa Heinz carried book of etiquette.
It gives you hints on how to handle awkward social situations.
Oh, just stop it!
But Teresa Heinz carried book of etiquette.
We don't have time for all this. Let me finish.
I eat something.
Stop! Hello! I am Teresa Heinz carry. I know five languages.
That makes me smarter than you. I am a billionaire. That makes me richer than you.
I have been married to two politicians. That makes me a whole lot unhappier than you.
So just find my grandpa. Get down and shut up.
And if he don't like what I am saying, show that!
But Teresa Heinz carried book of etiquette. Is available. Where will find me?
Shut up!
And don't mess with her Xbox. You're gonna get it. I'll tell you that.
How do you like that story?
Yeah. In Deltona, no less.
Well, it's just a place to stay away from my thing.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Anywhere near Orlando. Just did it all away from it.
A US senator asked the White House to explain how and why the name of an Al-Qaeda informant was leaked to the press amid concerns that it had heard the war on terror a letter from the lawmakers showed on Monday yesterday.
A Pakistani intelligence source said on Friday that US officials confirmed the name of Captain Al-Qaeda suspect Muhammad Nair Nurqan,
whether it was still cooperating with Pakistani authorities, as part of a sting operation against Osama Yamama's Al-Qaeda network,
thereby compromising his cover.
You can see what they did. They had them contacted by computer all of these slime balls.
The only problem being that Tom Rage and all these idiots here in the US, they decided to get the breathless story out there.
See what we're doing?
What did I tell you a couple of months ago?
I have those stories about the tremendous pressure they bring on the Pakistanis.
If they can't at least get the Osama by Osama by election day, get some big fish.
So they got their hooks out.
It's not clear who was the first to disclose Khan's name but his unmasking criticism on both sides of the political spectrum,
as well as speculation about the motives behind the leak.
There's nothing like a bad leak.
Security and terrorism are top reasons for both parties in this US presidential elections.
I respectfully request an explanation to me and any other member of Congress who might wish one,
of who leaked this Mr. Khan's name for what reason was leaked and whether reports that this leaked compromise future intelligence activity
are accurate, Chuck Schumer of a Democratic-New York Road.
Information from computer expert Conlay to the US, to issue a high alert at financial institutions against the possible Al-Qaeda attack earlier this month,
and let Britain arrest 12 Al-Qaeda suspects, but they do it differently over there.
Even though the Brits are silly-ass people, nevertheless, when it comes to their law enforcement, they got a leg up.
You know what I mean by that?
Yeah.
They got a leg up.
Must be those hacks.
Helicopter tours proceed despite warnings.
Let me say it again.
And there was, I saw myself live on CNN, which is just so pathetic, but it's all-
Are you talking about?
I saw myself Tom Ridge comes out there, and there's no room for partisan politics in Homeland Security,
and then he comes out with because of the tremendous efforts and the great job that the president's doing on fighting terrorism
that we able to bring in this information.
Right.
Who are you taking?
The old information.
Right.
Helicopter tours proceed despite warnings.
Tourist-borted helicopters for sightseeing tourism in New York area yesterday.
Despite reports that Al-Qaeda had considered using tour helicopters and terrorist attacks,
we're all here and we're all together, saying to Zeldorte of Martin,
he could border a Liberty helicopter tourist chopper with her family.
The FBI sent to Bolton's Friday night to police of the government official nationwide
the first warrant of a possible helicopter threatened the U.S. City.
Al-Qaeda is apparently considered to use of helicopters as an alternative to recruiting operatives
for fixed-wing aircrafts at a Bolton-obtained yesterday by the A&P.
The second bullet warns that terrorists have also considered using rental vehicles,
rentaled in the Zines to conceal powerful bombs when a bomb agrande.
And just like I said about the Statue of Liberty, what makes sense to me if we really believe those
four-year-old targets in New York City are valid currently that we would reopen the Statue of Liberty
since it's been closed since the day after 9-11.
And only we open just a few days ago right in the hills of Tom Ridges' breakfasts,
hysterical announcements. Right.
Just like Michael Moore says, keep them panicky, keep them scared,
keep them in a state of psychosis.
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on the 18th of Horizon Wireless Line.
WDQ-Y and Hello.
Yeah, I got a name for your list.
A name? Not a name, but a...
An event? Yeah, an event.
And what is that? Well, it was when 940 closed down and I had to listen to you guys so much.
I mean, you guys are just in chaos and I really wish I could go back home to my old state.
Go back home, go back to it. But you know something after their progressive radio air or America takes a big dump,
they'll probably go right back to RFX. So just stay tuned, man.
Well, I don't think they do, I mean, because this is just a thing. I want sports radio.
And that's a good one.
Sports radio, baby. There ain't nothing like sports radio.
Hey, listen, we're gonna get a bucket. Maybe somebody will read it to you.
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60 on the 18th of Horizon Wireless Line.
Maybe if there was anybody listening to WRFX, who wants sports radio in their first place,
maybe they wouldn't have changed the format.
How do you like that, punk?
Agent Moore on.
In fact, Moore is on this afternoon.
Now, is he on, he's doing solo right now until they bring in D-fo?
Yeah.
Oh, God. You've got to be schmitting me.
That is absolutely pathetic.
Moore and he have to know all by his loans and that is frightening.
Scary thought.
And then we got Moore and No-Lone, then we got the big one in the morning.
This last guy had a good point, I think. I think the ticket's gonna kick our ass.
Just when we had, see, I remember, see Greg Reed is a crazy person.
Let me just state that without any shadow of it out, he's a crazy person.
And he must have naked pictures of all the beesleys, including what's the name,
Joyce over there with Billy Goats or something, because he's got them wrapped around his little finger.
And all the other fingers too.
And every time he comes up with some crazy cock-a-many idea,
just to blow up the whole radio station, just when we, you know,
if they wanted to be the sports station, didn't we own the market?
Huh?
I mean, the station was like the cash cow.
We were making all that money, the millions so that they could afford the franchises,
the dolphins and all this other crap, so they could play a sports radio.
And all of a sudden he decided, well, sports radio is a very expensive way to go,
and all this other, he doesn't know what they all want.
He doesn't know which hand to wipe with.
And now, of course, with all this stuff going on, guess where Greg's on?
He's on vacation.
With all this garbage that's going on,
the audience instead of total confusion and chaos and turmoil,
even the muffmeister offered to me that this could be a worse possible time for,
to be off the air.
Of course, I can't mention the name, why he's off the air, even though he is suspended.
Can I mention it?
Who?
Exactly.
5670560,
pound 560.
You sports, there's man, bye bye!
Go to the end, one thing I don't want to say, I'd be remiss not to say Joe Roads did a great job, man.
Yes, he did.
Sell them as a guy done such a good job, who's been so poorly treated, so badly screwed over.
And so it's to be a really good guy.
Yeah, we like Joe.
Joe's fine people, he's always been good to us, he's got a good sense of humor, he gets it,
doesn't take it too seriously.
But unfortunately, he was led down the garden path and now all of those meetings that didn't take place
and all of Greg going into hiding, hiding under the desk, hiding under the wind, skirt,
all of these things that were going on, now it's come to find out and we see the reason why.
Because while he was covering his own ass, they're trying to keep Joe Roads on
and in case maybe we couldn't pull off the deal with A, it's how it, how it's banned.
Well, you know, then we were just playing him along, like a sucker.
But Joe being the wise guy that he is, he took off.
Was it a week ago Saturday, was his last broadcast on QA, am I believe?
That sounds about right.
I read it on the paper, I read everything online because nobody inside told him those anions.
Well, we knew, we were just not allowed to say.
I see, well we can't say crap anymore.
And what's really interesting about this is that this company, which is putting a Howard Stern on here right now,
when it comes to everything else, they're like peeing in their pants.
If you fart the wrong flavor like having a meeting with Joyce and Naples over there,
the corporate attorney to find out if we're going to get fines for being the wrong flavor.
While I was on vacation for a little George and Dr. Cornish there, had to be called on the carpet.
I don't know if I can talk about it or not, but I will anyway about some of Big Nose, the Yidd out there got upset about something you said.
What do you say, Jews have big noses?
Something like that, yeah.
So what's wrong with that?
And I also said they were cheap.
Yeah.
And you said that as far as these really are concerned and Ariel, she's wrong.
Toss her face.
So what's wrong with that?
I asked a second that emotion.
Maybe that's why I got that call from Gary Sarner.
Don't you ever call me at home again, Gary Sarner, you crazy bastard.
I'll come over there and uncosh your house.
How's that, but?
I'm going to send a bunch of crazy Arabs in there to uncosh your house.
Just out of spite.
We do just like, throw cheese around the world.
Oh, calls me, these are messages of my answering machine here yesterday.
Thank the Lord.
Thank you.
That I wasn't home when that call came in.
That doesn't tell me what he's calling about.
It doesn't come in before the show this morning, which our good friend Troy, Troy the boy comes in.
Troy Stratford was one of the only rational sales people that we got.
In fact, he may be the only one.
Am I leaving anybody out?
Well, did I tell you about high boy being in the hospital?
No, again.
Again, yeah.
What's that minor stroke?
You might have had one.
It's a TIA.
TIA?
Yeah.
I've had two of those.
Hi, Appali.
I can't imagine why.
He had a stroke?
Yeah.
I'll be damned.
But he didn't die.
Yeah.
What did I say when he woke up?
Hi, Appali.
And that's going to hospital now?
Yeah, as far as I know.
I'd say we wish him all the best, but we had a lot of time.
We do many times.
Quit eating you fat tub of crap.
You please quit eating.
Enough of the eating already.
I'll see you at Tim Horton's for lunch.
What a joke.
So he's back in the hospital again.
That place is just...
That last caller there, I want to apologize in your behalf.
Because he had his thumb right on the whole deal.
I apologize.
Right.
WRFX.
In fact, maybe down to...
A certain Monday, when stirring comes on our station,
they have to go back to the all sports thing again.
Pick our ass.
And then when the ticket comes on, that ESPN radio that nobody listens to,
Joe's going to have a following.
He'll have some audience.
And do you see who's the PD over there?
The brain trust?
Yes, indeed.
Our good friend.
Do not.
Oh man, I wonder if Francis is going to be feeding them guests over there at the ticket
with his oboe friend.
Do not.

You weigh in.
It's Ali.
How it dated.
Oh, I think this new government is the only time.
The bushlings that have fixed things up.
You're out of his mind.
Yeah.
So be chaos over there.
There's building movements in your hair.
I don't want to hear from us.
There's history stories.
I will we know it to see it.
With them to democracy.
I just want to know it to see it.
When you see more Mickey D.
Make Donald Trump.
You'll be pleased out at a Murphy's Exploring Death at a rapid rate
more so than ever before, man.
We're killing him.
All over the world.
Mickey D's and Burger King's popping up everywhere.
Aren't you excited?
Oh, yeah.
At least about the Mickey D's part.
Exploring death.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, it's just a little shot.
Here's the fact that it says why is...
Suspended or was he fired?
Why was he there more or guilty during the five-eighths year
but they didn't do it together the past couple of weeks
and says no more big what it said.
Well, it's all over the place.
We can't tell you anything.
Okay, because we don't know about...
And we sure don't know about that.
Okay?
That's the new QMF in a way.
We're going to be really raucous and cutting-edge and outrageous
and putting how it's turned show on in the morning.
But as far as anything else we can say crap.
Does that make sense to you?
No.
In other words, we lie a lot.
Which is the grid read motto anyway, right?
So why the hell shouldn't we just go along with it?
Why not?
Let's see.
Here's another one that says,
Important event Florida to me,
Jeb Bush decides to reduce federal and state funding
for all early intervention programs for artistic children
under three years old.
My son is two years old and is autistic.
I can ask a good bye to about 50 grand a year funding
for treatments and therapies.
Looks like Jeb wants Florida children like my son
to wind up in a vegetative state like his brother, W.
It says I'm thoroughly P.O.
It is what it says.
And I don't blame Mr.
more power to a good elected.
Both 70 or 80 times as November, please.
Speaking of voting,
anti-carry vets led by a long time
GOP operative bank world by Bush cronies.
This latest smear campaign,
Swiftboard veterans for the truth.
Yeah, we posted some stories about them.
The so-called independent group of Navy vets
who have launched the tax against Democratic presidential contender,
John Kerry, is led by a long time Republican operative
and financed by GOP contributors,
which strong ties to President George W. Bush.
What a surprise about those ties, isn't it?
Both ties.
The Republican roots of the group stretched back
to former Republican President Nixon,
when one of the group's leaders,
former Swiftboard commander, John O'Neill,
was recruited by the White House,
Chief Counsel Chuck Colson,
to debate Kerry on the Dick Cavittor in 1971.
We found a vet named John O'Neill
and formed a group called Vietnam Veterans for a just piece.
We had O'Neill meet the president,
we did everything we could to boost his group course
and told reporter Joe Klein,
in January 5, interview published in New Yorker magazine.
O'Neill did not share with Kerry in Vietnam.
I didn't know him,
but the Nixon was anxious to fight a veteran,
any veteran, to debate the veteran anti-war activist Kerry.
The plan failed.
The eloquent Kerry wiped the floor with O'Neill,
and those closest to the Republican O'Neill
say he never forgave Kerry
for embarrassing him on National TV.
O'Neill went on to clerk for Supreme Court Justice
William Renquist, a Nixon appointee,
and became an attorney in Houston
where he was active in Republican politics in 1991.
Texas lawyer magazine reports O'Neill was on the shortlist
for appointment of the federal judge who had been
Texas' bi-bushed father,
former president George Herbert Walker
who was not able to get the job by the way.
O'Neill is still working for the Republican Party
as lead author of Unfid for Command,
Swift, both for veterans,
speak out against John Kerry,
scheduled for release this week by right-wing publishing house
Regnery.
The group is also bought a half million dollars of air time
for a 60-second attack out against Kerry
to wear in the battleground states of Wisconsin Ohio and West.
Virginia.
After they would lie, you understand.
You get that, don't you?
After they would make up a bunch of crap.
In addition to which,
a co-author of the anti-Kerry's Creed
is a religious bigot,
hate-monger-and-gay basher who says that Islam should be eliminated
because Senator Hillary Clinton is a lesbian
and says, ragheads are void bumpers as clearly as they are women haters.
Islam is like a virus rights derome,
cursing who with long-time GOP operative John O'Neill wrote the book
as part of a project financed by Texas Republican contributors
with strong ties to the Bushmeister.
Islam affects the mind-corsi rights,
maybe even veterans in analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body,
it infects.
No doctor would hesitate to eliminate cancer cells from the body.
Corsi posted these comments on the anxious free republic.com website
November 26, 2002.
He's a regular contributor to the right-wing website,
posting it on the screen handle of JRLC since 2001.
A frequent gay basher,
Corsi on November 18, 2001, posted,
isn't the Democratic Party the official
Scytemizer Protection Association of America?
He reserves the same hatred toward Catholics,
so this is what the last days of the Catholic Church are going to look like,
buggering boys undermines the moral base
and the lawyers ripped the gold off of Vatican alters.
We may get one more pope when the senior old one dies,
but that's probably about it.
Well, I certainly get warm.
Yeah, I like that.
Corsi refers to Democratic nominee John Kerry as John F. Inkeri
and set on February 2, 2004 that John F. Inkami,
Kerry, and Kami Tape Kennedy discussed their plan to hand America
over to our nation's enemies.
His religious bigotry extends to Judaism
with his March 4, 2004 post.
After he married Teresa,
didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judaism?
He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish,
what religion is John Kerry?
Besides John Kerry Tape Kennedy,
Arab's Muslim Catholics in Jews,
Corsi also hates Billon Hillary Clinton.
A sampling.
Hillary loves the Arab so much.
Kiss, kiss, kiss Mrs. Arab, Arab brat.
Wonder how she'd look in a burka?
When is this guy Bill Clinton going to admit he's simply
an anti-American communist?
Won't he and his leftist wife simply go away?
Let the fat hog run a reference to possible presidential run
by Senator Clinton posted August 30, 2003.
Ask anybody why Hillary couldn't keep Bill of BJ Bill satisfied?
Not a lesbians when it didn't issue?
Of course, he admitted on free republic.com March 19 of this year
that he was J.R.L.C.
in that V.V.A.W. and John Kerry are a field of interest to me.
In 1972, he's just a post and extensive study
of the political protest around the 72 Democratic Republican
national conventions in Miami Beach,
protesting which the V.V.A.W. was actively involved.
Jerome R. Corsi J.R.L.C. on free republic.
I'll be happy to clarify any other questions you might have
be studying out here.
So now the resistance is a bunch of crap written by ultra-right wing
bigoted Neanderthals.
Just on behalf of the same kind of right wing bigoted Neanderthals
that are running for reelection.
The words of a feather do it together.
Here's how that poll's coming.
Nothing too exciting.
Now is this really true that Clarence and Duff came writing
and made you stop a poll in progress?
Yes.
Without the police segment.
And it was doing really well too.
Yeah, I mean we only got 196 votes on this one now.
You had 100 and about two minutes on that one.
And it was just a speculation poll, you know.
Right.
About somebody getting like...
...suspend into a fire door.
What you take on the suspension, you know.
Right.
...like four options.
196 votes.
What's out front of the past year?
Do you think was the most important?
The Marlins win the World Series 77.
WDQM brings back Howard Stern 39.
The heat gets shacked 28.
Mohauer David had frozen forces, suspended Hank Gerber 24.
Clear channel drops a dumps Howard Stern 18 and Ricky Williams returns on
10.
How come we didn't add on there WRFX Drop Sports?
I guess we could.
Let's get that on there for that one collar.
Okay, for that duck-complexed collar,
we want to hear about sports and sports and...
Five, five, five, five.
Over here.
Yeah, all day long.
Five.
...on the walls, on the ceiling.
Five.
...and is underwear.
Five.
...sports.
There ain't nothing else.
567-0560, pound 566-18 on the 18 and T in Verizon Wireless Line.
See, look for a few seconds there when this whole Stern thing started.
Like, it was going to be really magnificent.
Like, the beastlies finally broodced up and they were going to pay off certain things.
And then people to go away, I don't want to mention no name.
But they've been trying to unload for a long time anyway.
And it was going to be a happy family.
And we're going to just be a powerhouse.
And that what it looked like, right?
Now, a powerhouse used to be the name of a candy bar.
Did they make that anymore?
I don't know.
Now, see, think about it.
No.
WDQ.
WDQ, I am, hello.
Yeah, children out.
How about your pardon?
Speaking.
Speaking.
Yeah, Neil, one of your English listeners that you dislike so much.
Why isn't it that you people are so constipated and so loud and obnoxious and drunk?
Because we can.
Oh, I see.
Pull something up online yesterday.
I went to Philip's description online.
I don't know if you're aware of what's happened recently.
Can't get any online medication in the state of Florida anymore.
Huh.
Something mentioned up through last week.
Considering that we have airs, of course, surprising.
Now I can't get my dick pills online.
What did he just say?
Yeah, what you thought he said.
Oh.
And you dumped it.
Of course I did.
Well, I couldn't quite hear what he was doing without obnoxious.
See, I was right, pal.
We had to dump you in an ear and a jack hole in what you are.
Idiot.
Maybe you can say that in England.
What?
No, you can't hear it.
I was going to ask him what about those cocklers were, but I guess maybe they're...
Maybe the most...
They're kind of...
What's his answer?
A cockle is the kind of muscle.
Is it?
Yeah.
I'll be damned.
Well, thank God those cocklers got saved and they're written over the weekend.
130 of them.
Doing their thing.
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
WebNiQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Why in the world went you guys be able to mention about Hank when it was published in the paper and everything else?
Because this is WQAM.
I mean, whatever paper was for LaGuel, Sunsono headed in there and had a whole story about him.
Good, Harold.
Other Harold?
Yeah, I saw him both.
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any sense why you guys couldn't talk about that.
Well, does anything that Greg Reid does make any sense?
I know.
I don't know.
And the other thing is I can't imagine four hanks there.
I mean, the Hank, my buddy Hank.
Careful now.
Okay, the guy he is the most at the station is taken over for.
Yeah.
I mean, oh, I guess we'll all go to 790 in no time at all.
That's where I'll be.
All right.
Thanks, Neil.
Hmm.
I'll be at 790.
Wax CFM, whatever that is.
They got a terrible signal I should point out.
I sure hope that those businessmen from what's the place where all the Jews live in Hollywood there?
And where are the hills?
I hope that those do businessmen from Hollywood understand that they're buying a station
or they're leasing a station that's got in spite of what the Dennis D'Journey.
Dennis, what's his name from Jeffers and Pilot?
Collins?
Dennis Collins.
Despite his assurances, I'm sure that it's a fine station.
There's signals that go over.
I mean, you think we got a bad AM signal.
We got Snapcrackle and Papa.
At least you can understand what we're saying.
But on there, it's like, like they're talking through about four ounces of cow stuff.
So that would be really entertaining.
Although Joel have an audience over there, like I told you, the little dog.
Great job, Joe.
I feel really bad about that.
He was a fine lead in.
We liked him.
Everything was going along great.
A bunch.
And it remains to be seen now.
Of course, we've always been like an island on this station anyway, no matter who we followed.
Because, you know, we were not doing the same topic.
And following Stern, it will be the same thing.
Because I'm not going to be listening to him.
I could pay any attention to what they're doing.
They're talking about him.
I'm interested in, you know, in Lesbos and the big boobs, although you are.
But even so, I just, I'm not into it.
Well, you can't see any other radio.
I see.
But you can sure talk to a lot of them.
I can't.
It's 11.13 at 5.60 W.E.
Boobs.
You've heard me talk about dry concepts for years on which show nothing has changed.

as well as a schmutz done in there.
So, call dry concepts today and sanitize your entire home.

That's dry concepts making profits clean in South Florida since 1979.
Nye, and low.
This is for trade-off Icing.
We're waiting for you again.
Rogers guy.
No, another page from the audio book version of Bill Clinton's on a biography, My Life.
Last night was quite possibly the worst night of my life.
After a day filled with meetings and phone calls with world leaders, I retired to the residents to seek solace.
I flipped on the tube to catch some of my favorite show, American Gladiators.
Wow, man, that blaze gets my blood pumping.
Anyway, just as blaze was swinging across the monkey ropes, the bedroom door flung open.
It was as if the doors of hell themselves had opened.
Standing there before me, the most gruesome side I'd ever be held at.
Beholded.
Editor, no, check me on that.
If I had a melon ball or handy, I would have removed my own papers.
There was Hillary.
Naked as a super bowl striker without the advertisement on her chest.
She wanted the commander in beef.
That's a pet name from a bingy.
It had been over a decade since we had done the filthy humping bump.
She came at me, lips purged, eyes glazed, as she had obviously been drinking.
Heavily.
I began to think of interns naked and searched for my secret stash of Viagra.
There was no escaping.
Page.
She jumped on the bed, and it was as if my world came crashing down.
When in reality it was the bed.
She broke it.
A 100-year-old bed that belonged to Teddy Roosevelt, gone in one thundering leaf of love.
But the sound of crumbling oak did not slow her pursuit.
It was as if I was being attacked by a sauce watch.
Hillary had long ago forgotten any personal grueling.
Page.
Two and a half minutes later.
Mercifully.
It was over.
As I watched her droopy bottoms sway towards the bathroom.
I'm all of it.
I had to.
I knew I was an amazing lover.
But I had forgotten just how horrible it was to make love with someone you are married to.
I like the strange.
Wow.
Tune in again next time for another page from the audio book version of Phil Clinton's autobiography, My Life.

Hey Neil.
Howard did talk about your station last week.
Yeah, what are you saying?
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
He said something about the dolphins not liking it
and that they may pursue other options.
Right.
He said that's tough.
Basically, he said that's tough.
That's tough. That's tough to them.
It's not his decision.
So he didn't mention it.
Well, that's not what I was talking about.
Our station, that's not promoting QAM.
Well, he didn't say promote the station,
but he didn't mention that he's going to be on in South Florida.
Well, of course he did that because it's part of the whole ego thing.
Actually, he did that.
Yeah, that's true.
But honestly, I don't remember.
I don't know whether he actually used the call letters or not.
He may have, but I honestly don't remember.
That's the whole level of the thing.
That's the whole level of the thing.
It's power.
I wasn't paying attention.
Just background noise.
There you go.
There you go.
Okay, probably we see a five.
Twenty six after eleven.
How do you like that?
See the thing with the dolphins again, Eddie Jones says,
well, we would prefer to be on a sports station and Greg reads,
as well as a fitting, fitting chance.
You know, maybe we'll have maybe we won after the season.
Who cares?
First of all, the games are all televised anyway.
That's number one.
Secondly, you have to carry on your FM, which we got them on power, right?
So nobody really listens on QAM anyway.
And what's high end during Espagno?
They're also in Espagnolo on QBA, I believe.
Right?
Well, I wouldn't know where they are, but...
I know the Marlins are in QBA, so I would assume that they probably also carried the...
maybe, maybe not.
Who knows?
But they are on Espagnolo.
We know that.
So it's not easy like about how many people are we really talking about?
Stop turning, man.
Better to fix.
Plus, in addition to what you got the more factor.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
So who don't want to hear that?
Twenty six after eleven at five, 60 WQM,
Emerald Code South Florida's best Asian buffet,
proud to announce the arrival of...
Seam.
Fest.
Come in on the weekend.
I beg your pardon?
New copy, we were ready.
Yeah.
Come in on the weekends and enjoy a grilled...
Seam.
And...
Seam.
Scampy.
Now look at this, they've got that twice the most like the way you say it somewhere.
They've got...
Enjoy grilled shrimp, shrimp scampy, shrimp scampy, cocktail.
Seam.
And peel any?
Seam.
Emerald.
For you, something like such a fruitcake, man.
Does this need some fruity when he starts losing it like that?
You've been hanging around with George too long, I think.
So...
Emerald Coast is no ordinary Asian buffet.
The service is impeccable.
You'll never leave out an empty stomach.
I guarantee you that.
Start with six different soup sample.
Doesn't have a second of an entourage, including New York strip made of order at their sizzling Asian grill.
Along with their new Hunan fish.
If you still have room, sample a hand-car prep-prime rib, their new Thai specialties.
And don't forget, no MSG, no cornstarch.
They cook only with the best cholesterol free oils.
They're a fake features of full-sauved bar, full Chinese food lineup, and they're brand new sushi bar too.
And because it is a real Emerald Coast feature of full dessert, station featuring Belgian waffles, pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream with all the toppings, and fresh fruit as well.
What a perfect ending to a gigantic pick-out.
Emerald Coast real occasions for you.
Sunrise sunny hours in Pemberpine.
So take the family out of your next business luncheon at the Emerald Coast.
Take out anew.
We always available, voted number one by Zagat restaurant reviews.
And by WSBN NewsS, South Florida's best Asian buffet.
So call them at 9.54, 572.3822.
That's 9.54, 572.3822.
Lot of amateurs, but they're ain't nothing like the world famous Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.
I beg you, local BCCC's five cities.
The ratio is all yours now.
You ain't.
See them.
It's gonna get bricky of low.
Baby, aren't you couple missiles?
Yes, sir.
Touring place we know arrived.
And aim a mad-of-hell.
Who's her name?
Big dance with Oat.
There's one thing we all understand.
Alp data will be finished until we blow up Pakistan.
I'll go play we could chase them round forever.
With our tanks and all our troops.
The special forces are so tired of jumping through them.
You probably need another plane.
So let's cut out all the nonsense.
Engrouble of Pakistan.
How can a need to nearly rotate?
Why don't we stop the seafood?
Turn Engrouble of Pakistan.
You've turned.
Boom, boom.
Number five, Montreal Canadians.
1132-560 W.A.M.
295 votes on a pool.
Not too exciting.
I think they want you back on it.
They do a little more that the Shmere the Queer and the Toe Jand.
Toe Jand.
General Jand.
295 votes.
What's offload of endless past year?
Do you think was the most important?
Marlins win a World Series.
That's hands down.
121.
Thank God they're doing that because they'll make the Marlins feel a lot better about us.
We've had a long this station man and just everybody.
The Marlins seem to be no matter which the owner is.
They're always out for sensitive.
You understand?
Oh yeah.
I better not say that though.
Whether it was Wayne or John Henry.
Remember those ugly, ugly nasty days when they had that appearance on a morning show?
I'd be crazy.
I must be nuts.
Somebody said, oh, I knew when I walked in the door.
Boy, that was a bad mistake because they all, all those guys in their books, brothers, suits, gave me a look like they were going to kill.
Like, look, a bratsy was going to come out of that Garrett.
For the leaf, Garrett.
And then, of course, this crowd now, that we picked apart like insects, like picking wings off a fly.
When they first came into town, they would sense it with that much, badly-hood interview when he showed up late with Mo and a moaning.
And then, of course, all those other stuff.
But I guess the less said the better because everybody loves the Marlins.
Their TV ratings are way up this year.
Their radio ratings through the Rufan's last book on QAIM.
So, who don't love the Marlins?
Right even though they're having kind of a mediocre season in, well.
122.
So, the Marlins Winter World Series, the most important event of the last year.
So, every QAIM brings back Howard Stern 58.
That's not too bad, huh?
We'll take it.
All the way him got anything to say about it, but that's all right.
58.
The heat gets shack.
41.
Yeah!
Mo Howard David had fills in for the suspended-hang gold brewery.
Look at how many votes he's got.
3rd Channel Dumps Howard Stern 26.
Ricky Williams retires 18.
Well, let's start to move up a little bit.
A little movement there for Ricky.
And WRFX Drop Sports, their audience has voted too.
Has voted what a shame.
Let's face it, they had no audience.
Just like that 1400 thing that gets so much ink because you got a bunch of sports nerds and newspapers.
Like Sarni and Barry Jackass there.
Or they're going to be in heaven now.
I read the 85,000 articles they had over the last 10 days about all the stuff going on on QAIM.
And Stern is coming and we're dumping off sports in the morning.
And Yadi, Yadi, Yadi.
And the ticket is coming with the ESPN radio.
ESPN radio when he's sifting Joe Rose will make a ripple like if your dog does a silent fart.
About 100...
Yeah, about 100 years.
What would you just do?
Oh, just breathe in.
Sound like you were wheezing to me.
Was that wheezy?
Yeah, I've been smoking more lately.
Yeah.
I thought she just passed away old wheezy.
Wasn't she the one that died?
Somebody did.
Yeah, wheezy, though.
Well, it wasn't Florence because she's on passion.
She's old on Thurma.
Thurma, huh?
No wonder they keep putting your ass under carpet, man.
You better watch your pees and cues, mister.
WQA and hello.
WQA and hello.
They're raw.
WQA and hello.
Any other comments?
See, we can expect a lot more calls like they last when we had another we have Stern coming to QA.
And that's going to bring a tremendous level of intelligent colors.
Yes, sir.
I was just kind of wondering out loud that how could be really afford to keep Stern on the air and get him since he separated?
And she's going on with all the money.
That was great.
Only of course we do know that in that case Howard's the one with all the money.
But nevertheless, that was an excellent job, Palli.
That was really beautiful.
How many did a few last time, some fat guy we know?
That was funny.
56670560.566.18 and Verizon.
See, what really killed it?
And I didn't find out about all these, well, we can't do this until this morning before the show.
And in March's little clearance there, a real, real goose stepper if there ever was one and asked a liquor.
And he comes in and give me a corporate.
There's some corporate that and Greg wants to make sure you understand it.
And of course I told him to go well, bite it.
I told him to get lost.
But then he comes in with some other stuff.
It really is fairly lame but kind of marginal.
I don't want to put it all of us into a precarious position to get into a big song of dance.
But it's pretty sad that all of this stuff that's being written about in the newspapers.
And you've talked about this.
Everybody is writing about it.
Everybody's talking about it.
We can't discuss it on our own radio station.
I mean, that's bull crap.
Man, that is so juvenile.
It is so bush-league.
Right.
Everyone else benefits from our material except us.
That is so typical of this company, man.
They want to be one thing.
But in the meantime, they really can't.
You know what I'm saying?
They want to be something but they don't have the co-hosts to really do it.
So, wow, yeah, we really want to do this.
But we don't want to go that far.
And of course, for those people who have been wondering, I guess you've got some calls about the dump monkey.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Duff the dump monkey.
Yeah, our operations manager, Duff Lindsay, who told me under penalty of death don't tell anybody else about it.
Then I found out this morning that everybody knows that it's him.
Which is why I'm talking about it on the ear.
He's got the unbelievably difficult impossible task.
He's the one going to be sitting there during the Stern Show for four hours and who knows how long every morning.
And this is a guy who's not wrapped all that tight in the first place, okay?
As you well know.
Oh, I'm sorry, I was facing her.
He cries when somebody has diarrhea.
He gets upset.
You know what I mean?
Who should he be?
He will relax once again.
Oh, my God.
You know what I'm talking about?
He's not the most emotionally stable guy we've ever met.
He's a good guy in his own peculiar way.
But he's going to have the job of sitting in there.
And I don't really know because I don't listen to Stern.
I haven't listened to him in years.
And I guess they're really not doing all that much different on that show than they ever had before.
Which is why market after market.
Even the ones where they just put him back on the ear, the infinity owned station.
They're dumping him like crazy.
They're doing more dumps than they're going to be like I said diarrhea.
So he's going to be responsible for this thing around the yellow button.
He didn't assist the course by the self-hating Robert Greeper.
I notice how all these other people go the way of the win.
Zach Kranz is leaving.
He's going to the ticket.
Good luck you Zach.
Good guy.
A little fat and useless but a good guy.
The beast he's going to still be around because he's the clearest's boyfriend.
The program director's boyfriend.
He'll be around.
But there's some people who are getting their marching orders.
And then of course there's Robert Greeper who continues staying because he's got all the right pictures.
Man, one can only begin to imagine.
I don't want to.
Oh yeah.
You think the ones with the beastlies with the Billy goater, something they ain't nothing.
132 say to Marlon Wendell World Series, the most important thing of the year.
313 votes.
How in a lame I would say.
So what we're going to do is after the break of hood George back on and talk more about other.

Everybody was doing just fine.
And then, bam!
Even without Emerald Slugassi, man,
and then we go with that bam stuff again.
His Greg breaks the egg into a billion pieces again.
He will hump you.
And then he wants to bring D-fo back.
That's what kills me.
He tells Barry Jackass that if he wasn't able to sign Stern
that his deal was he had already discussed with D-fo,
putting him on with Moe in the morning.
The Moe foe show.
What is his obsession with going back to these same old tired retrids
with their corny humor?
What is that all about?
The last thing we need to do is to bring D-fo back.
And then he's back on his radio station is D-fo.
He did well in that poll though.
Yeah, good, good for him.
How many times do you think he voted?
BOTTERED, MAN!
W-Q-A-M, Hello.
A-N-L.
Yes, sir.
A-N-L.
What's your real man?
It's the Bible.
W-Q-A-M, Hello.
W-Q-A-M, Hello.
Hey, George.
Yeah.
What days are you on here without a meal?
Here are the other slipkiss.
I'm fine.
What differences do you make?
Well, because I like to know what days to tune in, what days not to tune in.
Well, what days do you want to tune in?
Whatever goes is on the loan.
He'll be on the loan tomorrow.
All right, thank you.
Okay, welcome.
567-0560, one of your people.
Yeah, like, they're a little more.
One of your people, I'm telling you, is calling from a sweet water.
He's sweet.
W-Q-A-M, Hello.
Yeah, how are you doing, sir?
Okay, Pali.
I want to apologize to George public.
We're crying of man.
You're sorry.
I don't want to talk to you.
Go away.
Crying.
You know that voice?
That piquet.
God.
I want to talk to chronic symphroding, call the sports nerd and one from a little of Anna and
this last guy.
I'm tired of talking to the same half dozen jack holes over here.
It's nauseating.
We're at a room at the holiday in, okay?
Let all the chronic's go in here and do their stick and the whispering guy.
And I'll all the same old tired chronic's.
Get a life.
Would you please?
I have no life.
W-Q-A-M, Hello.
Yeah, hello.
Yes, sir.
I was wondering if you heard about the article in the Sun Central where Dave County decided
to be very diplomatic in their distribution of their emergency funds from the national
government, but they only gave Broward County 4 million and Palm Beach County zero out of
all that, what is it, the terrorist money?
Not the terrorist money, I'm sorry.
The Homeland Security money?
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
And so Dave County has decided to keep far over 4 million of it when you...
How could they do that?
Well, that's the question of being answered.
Or answered half.
So, and it hasn't been answered yet, but it just goes to show you once again Dave County steps
up loud and frown.
I've actually had something to do with how are David had been on for and place a hang?
I'm sure that was something.
I bet there's something so this connected between the two.
Good luck to you.
Hi.
Yeah, bye.
Hang in there.
Bye.
5.6.10.5.6.
Do you see we're getting some pretty neat calls, huh?
And then you got that one number out.
I've got an air who has got the hots for you once.
I've got the answer.
No, but Dave got the answer.
Huh?
I didn't know that Dave County was the capital.
It is a capital of a banana republic.
Well, we did that.
I have no mistake about it.
Somebody QA him, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
You see the movie at 111, right?
Yes, I did.
Yeah, that last part, the guy is a good boy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was going to tell you, you know, I know you and I.
Yes, what?
Yes, I know.
You like Wooden-Machemacy?
I was wondering if you've seen the movie The Cooler.
No, I've not.
That's a good movie.
Okay.
You should see it.
How about those friends, huh?
They're kicking bad.
The who?
The brave.
You know, they're kicking us.
The brave.
Yeah.
Who gives a crap?
Probably most boyfriend.
Well, I'm brave.
$5.6705.60, pound 5.60 in a sad.
You know what I think it is.
I think the sports nerds are hanging on by their tentacles and testicles.
You know what I mean?
Like by their fingernail.
Why should they worry?
They got more stations providing to bed.
But they don't want those other stations.
You've seen the numbers.
No matter how many statements they tried to be all sports.
Not certain, man.
Never can do it.
The fan and the ticket and the list and the fan junior and all of the things.
They want to be sports 48 hours a day.
Nonstop.
Bargames, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky.
All of that stuff.
Danny and Jimmy and Jimmy and Danny and all that garbage.
It's because we've probably been in it for all these years.
And now it's like, wow, we don't want that crap no more.
Do you understand?
Do you know the reasoning here?
What?
Well, the reasoning, I thought it was money.
Money what?
Money hurting.
You think they're not making money?
You think that this radio statement.
They make it a fortune.
Isn't it a gold mine?
Yeah.
In addition to what you say, if they got some of the dead wood,
man or man, some of the dead wood out of this joint.
I don't want to mention your name.
Guys that are putting down some serious, serious bucks, okay?
Like, you know, how much do you have to pay a dump, funky anyway?
Somebody QAM, hello?
Yeah, George.
Yes, sir.
George, is everybody taking, uh, angle to go up the radio?
Can't talk about anything connected with the, whatever name you just said.
Five, six, one in these, uh, oh, fuck that's what he said.
Somebody QAM, hello?
And this guy, Jimmy Johnson?
Somebody QAM, hello?
Not there.
QAM, hello?
QAM, hello?
QAM.
Hey, how you doing?
Pretty good.
What's happening here?
Hey, I don't understand.
How come people, they hear you talk to them and they call and then, uh, and then you answer,
and they ask if you're George.
They think, oh, they're stupid because they're not on the man.
You think we talk to the intelligentsia, the cream of the crap on these shows every day?
You know what, talkers except for yourself, of course, are morons.
That's right.
Hey, uh, I was going to say, I agree with you really about the Democrats.
I'm just a point in, uh, the way that they present the pact.
This should really be a, uh, a Trump dunk against his cousin, right?
And you'll notice, you'll notice after Tom Ridge came on with his Tony Tear warnings again
with this four-year-old information stuff that they had had through, uh, in ages,
that it was Howard Dean was the only guy that had, I saw him live on, uh, Wolf Flitzkrieg that day.
I happened to be watching.
And he was the only guy that came on head to Vals to tell him like it is.
Howard Dean.
And then, who'd they put on that Wimpy Jew Lieberman?
Well, I know Tom Ridge personally and Tom would never do anything like that.
All the day, we're all, this is four-twenty-one-five-year-old.
Two a.m.
You missed Dick Cheney.
I'd like to relax if I have a very magnum massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers 12-hour-per-minute gay.
I heard the news and out to me, it's white clean, but I've been a fine display for acting, dissapeared.
I'm a father of skin, but it's more than I feared.
What's too blessed?
What's too blessed?
I've been a run, I've been a do what I can, I don't want to start a band child support man.
I knew she'd have a kid, but she's sure ain't what I planned.
What's too blessed?
I can't I'm gonna be a dad, I'm too late.
What's too blessed?
What's too blessed?
What's too blessed?
I only hate my spare, what's too blessed?
Sure don't love these plans and short fights.
Some mother wanted to kiss and have night, what's too blessed?
What's too blessed?
What's too blessed?
It's...
I've been a problem on a five-six-year-old W.I.M. happy Tuesday to eat.
I don't even know what day of the week it is anymore.
In quite frankly, who don't use a crap?
So you're gonna be on Monday next Monday when the Howard Stern debuts.
Okay.
But you hear the end of that?
One moment please.
Yeah, that's the next bonus.
Just a little slap over there to the next spot.
That's okay.
We don't expect perfection, especially on this station.
You're gonna be the first one to sit around and wait till Howard decides it's time to go home.
Okay.
Now the only bad thing that I can see about that is the fact that we're gonna be forced to listen.
Well, the Joshua will be forced to listen.
Oh in other words, he can give us a heads up.
See, I have no idea how that happens.
Maybe one of the Stern...
And by the way, prepare yourself for about 50,000 more of those Stern rules.
Bob Aberwey, that's gonna be coming through.
The other side benefits to having Howard on the air.
Which is not gonna be wrong.
I'm a static man.
I haven't always shared a lead in.
Huh?
Crank call us and say the same thing over and over.
I don't know how to deal with that.
No.
But maybe some of their audience knows how he...
What happens at the end of the show?
In other words, is there like...
I don't get it.
A styron does he fire a gun into the air?
In fact, you know who thought?
I started mentioning this in the beginning and then again,
a sidetrack myself for the 8 minutes time.
But you know who was trying to do the same thing?
Yeah.
Remember he would get to be like a minute and a half past 10 and he would say,
well let's talk to Frank in that Dalry beach.
Remember that?
Well that's just because he didn't want to let people hang up, you know.
That's because he didn't want to say goodbye.
He thought he wanted like muscle in over on the show,
which we did do the crossover every day,
which was okay.
But he wanted to go like, he thought he's Howard Stern Jr.
You know, he's gonna go on until 10-15.
10-25.
You know, from Ella, from Ella.
He's gonna be a team it up with more.
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
W.A.Q.A.M. Hello.
I have never in my life heard a dead or sounding line in that.
Have you?
Man.
W.A.Q.A.M. Hello.
John Bob?
W.A.Q.A.M. Hola.
How are you, Neil?
Yes, sir.
Glad to have you back.
Sure.
George did a good job.
George is doing a sensational job, man.
I can't hold a candle to him.
The funniest thing that happened is George was fighting the guy
job up there.
All right, Trevor and Jones again, Neil.
Well, it's another one of your fans.
Oh, yeah, both of us.
5'6'7, 0'5'60, 0'5'60.
We're talking to the Howard Stern people this morning, Mr.
Aftonun.
The frenzy man, you can feel it.
It's contagious.
Can't you feel it in the air?
I'm feeling something.
And of course, we can't talk about that.
Right.
Even though Moe Howard David, it will be falling into
the Aftonun from Fortal 630, Marlon Pregame time for the suspended
Hank Grover.
But we can't talk about that.
WDQAM, hello.
Back off the moral and the market at Span Show.
WDQAM, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
OK, the other one.
George did a controversial show.
No, the other, the controversial show, yeah.
About the famous call of scholars from the past, controversial.
Yeah.
Oh.
Beauty, WDQAM.
WDQAM.
QAM, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
I got a cheer for the Mayas.
Good, good for you.
Oh, that's stop calling from Naples with an update.
WDQAM, hello.
Hey, what happened with the hammer?
I beg your pardon?
What happened with the hammer that I got the shutter for?
You're asking me?
I'm asking.
We can't to discuss it, sir.
Under the present regime in Washington, we're only permitted to say a few, that's right,
a few so I've had to work.
You deserve for a long time.
That was funny.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7, I'm getting into these calls now.
I've missed this.
Although I do have a very important story.
Good.
Proposed Dutch law would ban unsolicited toe licking.
I think I might have seen it on our website.
I put it on there.
Unsolicited toe licking would be banned in the Netherlands under a lawsuit
by the Dutch Labor Party after police were unable to prosecute a would-be
Casanova with a taste-per-female toes because he really committed no crime.
A police spokesman said Friday a man had been detained after women
sonning themselves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had
snuck up on them and begun to lick their toes.
Maybe he was one of those cockroaches that got lost on the beach.
The officers had to let him go licking his fingers toes is rather unusual,
but there's really nothing criminal about it, as spokesman said.
Dutch press reports said the man who's about 35 have been looking with toes
as strangers for about three years, but was only recently caught by police.
Peter Van Hiemst, a labor member of parliament asked Christian Democrat Justice
minister Pete Haine Donner Friday to explain why Dutch law is forbid littering,
but not uninvited toe licking.
Van Hiemst demanded an amendment prohibiting it.
It's a violation of one's privacy and one's physical integrity total local news
agency.
The norm is that no one should touch your body if you haven't asked them first.
A spokesman for Donner said the minister could not have been to the committee
with smoking a big fat one or something like that.
Donner said the answer to the answer by the way it's pretty boring.
I don't know, I'm just burned out on it.
I said that all the time, don't I?
And then I get back, right?
Just to make sure.
I don't know.
I don't like the way a lot of people smell, although I was walking on the dam rack
one afternoon.
And I hear a voice saying Mr. Rockies, and I turn around,
and there's this guy, I would say, about my age, short gentleman and his wife,
big fans from Miami.
We're very nice.
I mean, it didn't like bend my ear.
And then as I was walking down the street, back to the hotel, they were again.
Not that they were, you know, so that they were what?
Not the doctor.
Not the doctor.
No, they were not.
It's just happened to me that we're looking for a shop where they could find like some
nifty t-shirts.
It's an Amsterdam and all of you know.
And I said, oh yeah, anywhere around here, I ran.
No, they were very nice.
That's kind of unusual, ain't it?
Like on the dam rack right there, and Mr. Rogers, I thought, who the hell are you?
You know, it's a small world.
Yeah.
And don't go into that easy internet cafe unless it's under 100 degrees in the,
oh man, it is just boiling in that.
The way you look at the dam.
The way you look at the view.
No.
God.
Can't even crack a window.
Oh man, just boiling in there.
Did they let you crack a cell?
They let you smoke crack, but that's about it.
Five to, and one other piece of good news is that they moved a lot of those
lots of people like out of the, they moved them all there to the old church.
I guess maybe they got a free in a prayer, but there was something.
Everyone I fell on my accident and broke my hand.
Right, right.
Here's that spot.
That's where they moved them all.
WDQA and Hello.
WDQA and Hello.
Hey there.
Yes sir.
I don't suppose there's any chance that Mohaward is leaving town completely and
like them first coming back to do the often game?
No.
What a shame.
Five six seven oh five sixty boy.
You are right man.
This town is cleaned out.
Yeah.
And the lifeless ones, this is, this is one of the times they when they prove it.
Be out of shadow of a doubt.
I have no life.
Because they're still around.
That's all you got.
You're the me.
Thanks.
What South Florida event of the past year?
Do you think was the most important is what our poll question is today?
Not going over all that big 392 votes and come see Komsha.
The Marlins when the world series 154 WDQA and brings back how it's turned 79, which I don't
know.
I would have thought for a while or I thought that was doing pretty well, but it doesn't strike
me that it's doing all that likes and maybe the certain people don't know yet or probably
they're not listening, which indicates that when stirring comes on, it's going to do us
a bit of good.
You think it's going to do us any good?
Adopted.
Right.
I'm asking, well, you're now you're asking me.
I'm asking you.
Do you think that having stirred on in the morning?
I mean, we sure had a nice book this last rating book right after.
I was here two hours and a half.
It would be hard to think that we could do better, I guess, better than number one.
I'm not talking about better than number one.
I'm just, I don't know.
Well, let's say time will tell.
WDQA brings back how it's turned 81.
That's next Monday, August 16.
The Heeklet's Shack 56 as in Q56.
More how we did it, it fills in for Suspended Hagelberg, which we can't discuss, 41.
Third channel drops how it's turned 38.
Ricky Williams retires 24 and WRFX drops sports 3, which means that Rana and Pete Bolger have also added their vote to a David Ross.
And then it'll be four, because that other call it, the Schwarzenegger called, he'll be voted two.
WDQA, hello.
WDQA, I'm Ola.
All right.
What is it?
No, I was calling about the stern, he was wondering when the stern show finishes normally.
I know that answer.
Go ahead.
No, generally it finishes when what's your name, Robin Quirrs, the one he, when she starts to get Quirrs, when she starts doing the mail.
As opposed to the female.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's when they normally start to, they wrap it up, but let me tell you some, I, with an 100 listener, sometimes they'll go on and on and on.
And sometimes they'll 1130, so you guys might need to take a look.
So they'll go on to the 1130.
I've used to be an advent listener before they got taken off and I have time to do.
I'm possible, I'm for sure, at least it goes 1130 times, not every day.
But if they have a good show going on, they don't stop it.
And their commercials used to be like about 20 minutes long.
Are they going to still be that long?
Whatever they got, whatever they sell, that's what we'll have to fill the breaks.
I got you because let me tell you, you can go to work and come back and install them.
What's the problem?
Well, what would you say would be the average time for them to finally pack it in?
Generally, no earlier than 9.45, 10 o'clock.
You know, 9.45?
Yeah, generally.
I mean, I know they go from like 6 to 6.
No, you don't mean 9.45, because they're around like 6 to 10.
No, yeah, yeah, they're in 10.45.
Yes, yes.
So their average ending of the show is like 10.45 to 11 o'clock?
At times, yeah, not every day.
So you guys need to get a little sleeping bag or something.
A TV? Absolutely.
You have a good idea to be doing a show at home where it's nice and comfortable.
I have a pillow lined up, nice going.
Okay, thanks for the good news, Ballet.
12.55 to 114.
114.02 after all these years.
That sounds good to me, it's enough.
12 of its past noon, 11.30 now.
Have we heard anything about this?
Oh, I'm going to tell you something right now.
I guarantee you that between Dufflin Z and Greg Reed and Josh Claret's Dero,
the three of them put together, don't really know what time that's your wins on an average.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
All he knows is that Greg signed the deal.
He went up there breathlessly in the, you know,
keep the top secret and all of a sudden the grand, that's it.
That's all I know.
Because I asked a few questions from Miss Lindsay about the, you know,
the formatics and about the commercial breaks and about, and like,
they're working on it with a water Nazi,
which we will play that bit on Thursday.
Why are you playing tomorrow?
I play it yet?
No, no, it's fresh.
Excellent.
12.13, yes, he's kind of fresh.
12.13 at 5.60 WQM.
How come Gary Sarner never came in and told me what he breakfast through his call me here at home?
About yesterday.

Welcome back to our number two of the Al Franken show.
Joining us this hour will be Vice President of the United States Dick Jigney.
He will be at the other end of my phone line.
He's out of line.
Mr. Vice President, welcome to the Al Franken show.
A Mr. Vice President, I couldn't help noticing the photograph of you and your family smiling and laughing that's currently being circulated online.
Yes, that is too show that we are a decent loving and sensible Republican family.
Why, what were they laughing about?
I believe I had just told my lovely daughter Mary, but that's she's not like to the face.
No, I would definitely say, Roger, White's book.
It would seem that way.
You know, with all the comparison jokes being made about you and Spiro Agnoupe.
How bio-volute you think it would be to bring back Rowan and Martin's laugh in.
I, uh, never watched that show. I had better things to do.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
That's just been brought to my attention that Dan Rowan is dead.
Oh, I'm perhaps you can resurrect him.
Yes, I can issue a director for my staff to look into it.
Fine, I've satisfied with their analysis.
I can always ask the President to pass it on to one of his invisible friends.
Yeah, I was harping that you would use my show to once and for all,
put the controversy of how is the energy meetings to rest.
What energy meetings?
Yeah, how one's you held with Halliburton and Tenlay?
There were no meetings. I never heard of Halliburton.
Those meetings you held in the White House.
White House, never heard of it.
Tell me how does that mean that you are a liar?
And well in, you're a liberal.
A liar.
And here at 30, filthy gummy bingo liberal.
Tell me how he'll help him himself.
What solid?
From 19 and 560 WAM.
Wow.
All the Latinos and others who are used to take those mid-economies, yes, this is long naps.
Alfred can see, uh, he's the guy.
Unbelievable.
Absolutely.
You can't really find a way to hear it just a little bit.
No thanks.
Okay.
I have to see his performance with Aaron Brown as they were trying to outline each other around CNN,
the Democratic Convention.
I think that was enough for me.
I guarantee you that was spectacular compared to the radio show.
I see.
I was waiting for somebody to say, try the wine.
Maybe Bella Lagosie after he finished calling Andy.
560, 560, 0560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
So the one caller says the Howard Stern show ends it around.
What do you say of two minutes till two something like that?
We'll find out.
Two to two.
70 QAM.
Hello.
Hey.
Yes, sir.
Yes, you know what's funny?
What are we?
The Michael Moore show.
The movie.
Yeah.
And there was a part at the end that they shouldn't show the voting machines on the computers.
When it actually, whoever you vote for, Bush is going to come up and they won't be able to track it.
Uh-huh.
So that's really on the end of that movie.
Okay, well I'll call Michael right now and tell him to reshoot it.
Okay, or maybe just shoot it.
I'm looking better at the idea.
560, 0560.
Don't forget.
Fool me once.
Shame on Ma.
We gotta try again and take a kiss.
WDQAM, hello.
Shum, Bob.
WDQAM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil?
Yes.
How are you?
Great.
Well, listen, what happened with this barely and uh, uh, Howard David?
I just got back from vacation from Europe and I just was listening.
Well, you didn't hear about the car crash?
No, what happened?
Oh, we can't talk about it.
It was a grizzly thing.
560, in fact, if you're wondering where any of the people who are not hearing on QM, they all died.
Okay, let's, I mean, it's sad.
Right.
But that's just kind of like, uh, is a catch-all right there for everything.
All the people that you're missing or not missing or glad that you don't hear anymore.
I think they just all died and a big horrendous crash, something like that.
Right?
All of these things.
Right.
Okay, that's true.
You bet.
In fact, Tom Reed will tell you about it when he gives another one of his breathless, uh, terrible words.
WDQAM, hello.
Hey, man.
Yes.
What happened?
Howard didn't end, then.
George.
Yeah.
It feels the show ends like it's 1030, man.
1015, 1020, every day.
Every day.
Sometimes it'll go to like 11.
Yeah.
But that's it.
Till 11.
Yeah.
Who's this?
Neil was George.
Both.
Okay.
This, this, this show goes like 1030.
Now, listen to Howard all the time.
Right.
This show ends at 1030.
You don't even know what it is.
I'm not worried about it.
The longer he goes, the less work for us.
We're not worried about it in the least bit.
Yeah, the less than the year for seven years.
Almost 6, 5, 6, 6.
It'll be good.
It's not.
It'll pump up the ratings a little bit.
Not the pump.
Pump us up even bigger than our locate.
Thanks a lot, man.
Have a great life in the cleanup.
You're right.
How was he talking about?
He says, how are he goes on to, he goes on until he's, uh, out of gas.
I believe it.
You know, right?
Huh?
Till he's done.
Till he's done.
That's right.
It's like a bomb moment.
Okay, if you're smart, you just sit there and say you're done.
You don't like rush it.
You know, I can't talk about those things.
I said like a f***ing movement.
God, it's, it's given to the point now where we shouldn't start playing music.
We can't talk about anything.
Right.
No, Mark.
Don't say that.
Eric, Eric, Eric, he sends me the email about a half an hour ago.
I forgot to tell you about this.
He sends me an email, says, or he didn't do anything to the website last Friday.
The reason we had the big spike in the response was because of the Ricky Williams video.
Oh, yeah.
I'm not sure if that's what I was talking about the entire week last week.
And I don't know, I probably give you credit for it, but we can't.
No, because you've been on all summer long anyway.
But the point being that all of a sudden on Friday a week ago was the announcement that Stern was going to be on the station.
And then simultaneously with that, starting on that next Monday, all week long, we had this huge spike.
I mean, Friday was extra because of the Ricky Williams video.
But this huge increase.
So somebody must be discovering somewhere.
And you maybe saw the thing on Radio 8th of the day.
You probably didn't.
You don't look at that website.
About Stern being the most searched talk host in America by seven times more than Rush.
Rush is number two.
And all the top 20 are syndicated, of course.
But seven times more than even Rush.
So all you have to do is get a whisper on any of the websites.
Or like some of the pictures on there behind the video.
And you click them, which I'm sure a lot of the Stern people are horny desperate guys.
The heavy breeders.
Those people want to see those naked pictures like Joan Severance today, which is an old black and white picture of some marginal bits that George put on there.
Because you knew I was doing a show today.
Beautiful woman.
Tomorrow you'll have naked pictures of Britney Spears again.
Huh?
I try to say a good words for you.
Now you're so full of crap.
Don't you think when I was in Amsterdam I was checking a website every day in that warning hot, easy internet cafe.
I think it's not easy to breathe.
We had repeats of like three old red thumbs smokers on there.
Man, let me tell you right now.
Yeah, we're smokers in the internet cafe and we had smokers on the website.
Well, the Priscilla Presley batch was a new batch of pictures.
Don't say batch.
I mean, a daily press.
Those were good.
Somebody, what is it?
I mean, yeah.
I just thought the hammer being a can't talk about the hammer man.
Can't discuss the hammer.
What's it ever?
Okay, don't start trying to put us in an impossible position.
He is going to be filled in for this afternoon.
And all week, I guess for the next several years, how are David and for the suspended hang-goal burger?
I don't know.
He's been suspended.
He's been suspended animation.
I don't know what's going on.
He's wearing suspenders.
Yeah.
All I know is I love Hank.
I'm with Hank.
I'm on Hank side.
And if it comes that way, us against them, I'm with Hank.
If they throw a lot of Hank, I'm taking a walk all the way to the refrigerator.
Just.
Wait.
Yeah.
Oh, and somebody said on one of the British, maybe it was on the BBC.
Be afraid.
Be afraid.
After Tom Bridge had that latest green light yellow light, the red light, the panic alert.
It was most amusing, especially for those Staggie Brits.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
Main decor, N.C.R.
R.L.
Hey, man.
Whatever you just said, OK?
Wow.
How sad.
No, seriously, I feel so much better about life.
But it's only two and a half hours under the show.
But I feel so much better being away from that place.
Yeah.
You bet you.
Well, let's take a look at the ratings now.
At the Elite Award.
OK, we started on that golf crevagan.
You know, the CNBC proves what a bunch of blue nose butt plugs they are.
You know what they plan to weaken on CNBC?
I have no way of knowing that.
Golf.
See what I'm saying?
For blue nose, they leave us the snobs, you know, who likes to watch other guys play golf.
Or an tiger is having a slump now.
Or an tiger.
Oh, give me a break.
Oh, get a life.
Will you please?
It's only two and a bar in this game.
That is pathetic.
449 votes.
What's offload of head of the past year?
Do you think was the most important?
Marlins win the World Series.
I'm ridden 72.
Little David Sampson who comes up to Georgia's kneecap.
Now, we don't want to start picking on him again.
Huh?
Who?
David Sampson who comes up to your kneecap said,
we did it!
Yeah.
And everybody made fun of them.
But you better not be doing it now.
You're going to get suspended.
Marlins win the World Series.
172.
WDQM brings back Howard Sturer 94.
21% of the votes.
They're like, uh...
We'll see.
The heat gets shacked.
50, 67.
Look at that.
More Howard did it.
It fills in for the suspended hangover.
44.
Third channel dumps Howard Stern 42.
Ricky Williams returns only 26 WRFX drops fourths.
They only got four.
My mind.
My look goes.
Sixth is for trade.
Five sixth.
One solid.
We're going to do it again.
It's David!
Oh!
It's Miami Town.
Sixth.
Five sixth.
Oh.
WQM.
Ooh.
What are you eating there?
He's got chewing.
Oh, that's enough.
Come on.
We got a shoulder, though.
Okay.
See you later, he's sad.
Yeah, you'll do things.
See you at the club tonight.
Don't we got an appearance today?
And please, house of meat.
Yeah.
All right.
Get over here.
I need him to take this here, uh...
That's a historic reason.
And Jake, my head, the show I'd love for the shackity.
Uh...
Good.
I want you to do a that-up, open his copy here.
We're coming to you live today from Pees House of Meat.
Easy to find.
Uh...
A cross from...
K-hooks pregnancy, clay and porium.
You can't beat Pees House of Meat.
Hey!
I said, Jake, my head.
And that's it.
Well, they put no electrodes out there for a pot.
For a pot.
Yes, Nemo.
They're the livers lying on the table over there.
What are you talking about?
Now I got a new game as a brain surgeon.
And I'm gonna switch a brain with doubty, no?
Now just relax.
You won't feel a thing.
You won't feel a thing.
You won't feel a thing.
You won't feel a thing.
You won't feel a thing.
You won't feel a thing.
Yeah.
My job has done.
See ya.
Look, I'm over there.
Look, I'm over there.
I'm over there.
Now look at the fight I've got me into.
Sorry, Bolt.
I mean, are you mind-defying?
I'm pissed that you're moron.
You're okay.
Thank you, though.
What's wrong with you?
My brain is in your head.
That's what's wrong.
And what's wrong with the spare?
Why are you?
Now, who's that?
That's what's wrong with you.
That's what's wrong with you.
That's what's wrong with you.
That's what's wrong with you.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
27.01 at 560 WQMADDogg with one of his rare appearances due to for the San
Cano.
A team of international observers will monitor the presidential election in
November corner of the U.S. State Department.
This goes to show you how far the U.S. has come, right?
The organization for security and cooperation in Europe was invited to monitor the election.
By the State Department, the observers will come from the OSE's office for democratic
institutions and human rights.
It will be the first time such a team is imprisoned for a U.S. presidential election.
Because in the past, we didn't need other people to come in like a central world country
and oversee it.
Right.
We're proud.
The U.S. is obliged to invite us as all OSE countries should.
Scolveswoman Oundargunderstokter said, it's not legally binding, but it's a political
commitment.
They said documents 10 years ago to ask OSE to observe elections.
Because they tend to be a little bit suspicious.
Especially when dead people vote in Chicago and the vote told in Malflorda.
Always come back before we're done and we'll again.
You mark my words, mark it down.
5,670560, the audience whipped up into a frenzy about the arrival of Howard Stewart next
Monday, August 16 on QAM.
Okay.
Oh yeah.
WQAM, hello.
QAM Howard Stern, hello.
He's just a minute.
He's just a minute.
He's just a minute.
A little slow.
Bob Mabooie, line.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
Yeah.
Can you Roger?
Speaking.
You?
Yes.
You're the best.
You are the best.
Yeah.
You just need a Roger?
No, it's Neil Bounds.
5,6705, you mark my words.
You watch.
You see this tremendous increase in traffic on our website now with the internet even on
the area yet.
And now it is tremendous increase in the quality of our cars.
Oh yeah.
You didn't know.
You mark my words, man.
In fact, I'm not even going to take, do these bedtime stories anymore.
All this preaching to the choir.
What's right?
What does that mean?
We'll go to the phones and they'll be fine.
We'll go to the choir.
The choir and Dodge Ball and Fuz Ball and all of that crap.
Round the clock 24, 7, all right?
Absolutely.
Because if you've ever heard the people that call back in the day when I used to listen,
you think our callers are something else.
Wow.
When you got as many millions of wackos listening as Howard does, it's just no end to them.
You know what I mean?
We just basically have the same ones.
Over and over and over again.
Casey, I haven't noticed.
No.
Somebody QAM, hello.
Oh, sorry, wrong number.
Yeah.
It was a lady and it was the wrong number.
Right.
And we had any ladies.
I made ladies you had call on all week.
Couple.
Not too many.
No, never.
But then, and you know the one thing is seriously, the one thing that Howard Stern is going to do,
along with, you know, Gusson up the ratings on the station, of course.
And guarantee those bonuses I read up.
Oh, right.
You heard, he's going to bring people back to AM radio.
And I'm not saying this to be an ass-licker because I'm not going to kiss anybody's ass
including his, but he will bring tons of people back to AM radio.
Now that is a mirror.
And I'll, and it itself, that'll be good.
We'll take that.
Well, first of all, now the thing about women, women don't listen to AM radio.
People underneath about 100 most of them accept sports nerds don't listen to AM radio.
Right.
So the fact that Stern, he's enough of a magnet, a magnet magnet that he's going to bring
thousands and thousands of people to Ziggins by my estimate probably 30 Ziggins people
back to AM radio, which is quite a trick.
Now the ticket ain't going to do that.
Okay, with all the respect and my good friend, you're a rose.
We love you, Joe, but the ticket ain't going to do that.
You know, it's just going to divide up to the little pieces of the pie.
WQA and hello.
Oh, my shoulder and Johnson.
No, no, no.
WQA and hello.
Neil, how are you, buddy?
Pretty good, Pali.
Okay.
I just forgot the truth here.
I was on, I was looking in the hours during this morning and they took a Miami
caller because he said, yeah, he's going to be coming down on the radio.
Right.
The guy is trusting that you're going to be on an AM radio station instead of an FM station.
Yeah.
You can hear your better.
He can hear your better.
I don't follow that.
No, I don't hear.
I don't follow that at all whatsoever.
I mean, I mean, he still gets to hear his voice, you know, I mean, does it, does it
matter?
But that's maybe the clarity a little bit.
The clarity maybe on some people's radios, maybe you, you know, a truck or maybe even somewhere
else where he can hear it too well.
Yes, it sounds like a trucker to me.
I don't know.
I just found a figure that brought that out to you.
Okay.
Thanks for a good news.
Now do you say anything about QAM or not?
He said a little bit about it, but then, but then, but then that was it.
He said a little for the 16th, though, that he's looking for, he's looking forward to
be back on the air down there instead of took him in the light.
Finally got it, but he finally got it.
So he's really happy.
And he didn't touch the beasley yet.
So, we'll see.
Well, we'll see.
It's right.
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
Okay.
Once he finds out that the dump monkey is a dump and every other word at that point, we'll
see just how that works out, you know.
Right.
We're going to spy reports from those people who will be listening.
Of course, they won't, I mean, how do you really know?
Because I already know what.
No, I mean, when you're listening, because if there are too many dumps in there, it
interrupts the continuity.
Oh, I understand what the language is talking about.
I'll listen to the beginning just to see what it sounds like.
And you know about the triples in the light, right?
I beg your pardon.
We're getting a triple dump system.
Triple dump?
Supposedly.
I think that's in the Athens Olympics, the triple dump.
Yeah.
Wish you ever smelled any of them Greeks over there.
I don't want to go into that.
They really stink.
You were just talking earlier.
148 degrees over there.
And now the Middle East and people, and then the Indian people, with that kid career,
a diet of theirs, they got some more smell problems and the packy people.
And they're just a lot of smelly people.
And the world thing I will say for us in the Western hemisphere in Canada and the USA,
is that we smell pretty good.
I mean, not that you can't find some real stenchy people around anywhere I am, but
generally speaking, compared to the rest of the world, we smell pretty damn good.
You know, damn straight.
And if you can't look good, that's my motto.
If you can't look good, at least smell good.
That's my belief.
One thing about me, you'll never catch me with like, you know, all the way to that,
it's easy enough to have a there, you do have moist pits.
Right.
Just sweating a husky, you know.
I know, that's when it's 180 degrees.
The humidity is like 5,000%.
Still, as the dude dropped as you were, I bet you smelled better than any of the other people.
Oh, I smell like my underarm.
I smell like my fa.
And most of them smell like fat.
My life and look all this is for a trade of life.
I feel good about the world.
You ain't way in.
Hey, it's Howard.
Howard's fam.
Never made it as a wise man.
Got thrown in prison for petty stealing.
Made friends with the inmates.
Though they can't get touch, she's feeling me.
I don't know now.
They're behind me.
I won't know.
They're behind me.
They're behind me.
Sticking up to my can.
I won't allow.
They're behind me.
Sticking up to my can.
In the shower.
The story.
Drop the trophy and you'll be sorry.
Hey man, they're not spakin'.
They're up for you, foolin' little of makin'.
They're so wrong.
You're spanned out.
They're right to talk, then they can show bottom.
They're like me, what enough what?
Prison life and hate is fun.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They've been fun, yeah, yeah.
They've been fun, yeah, yeah.
They've been fun, yeah, yeah.
Call 44-56, WDQM, Mad Dog at 2.
We got Howard David for the suspended hand-global
at 4-0-630, the Marlin pregame show Marlins on Deck at 630.
Cardinals at the Marlins at P.P. Park, 705, the game.
Best team in baseball, St. Louis Carr is a better record than even the Jankies one.
And the Marlins who've been staggering against weak competition but seem to play better against better teams
so they ought to kick ass tonight.
Eddie Camp at the baseball game and then, oh, are we still gonna have that sporting news radio?
Right, yeah, sure.
Oh, come on.
I mean, how would you stand on the morning we're gonna give them that as a lead in sporting news radio?
What else is there?
What about Joe and Mark?
I mean, Joe without Mark, Joe and uh, something.
Joe and Mark?
Joe and Nemo and D.Fo and uh, the big, uh, a whole bunch of them.
All the most.
Dominic Q.A. and hello.
Neil?
Yes, sir.
Hey, uh, yeah, Howard usually goes from 10-30-11 so that's about 10-30.
11?
About 10-30-11, that's about 10-30.
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Sounds like a deal to me, thank you.
We can handle that.
In fact, when it outstretched out a little bit, huh?
Take your time.
Don't rush.
In fact, maybe in Bakl, one of those 20-minute breaks that were starting about the 11-05.
There you go.
And stop and think about this.
No, I don't think we have any more Marlon Day games on our broadcast schedule this season, but.
Stop and think about starting next season like in, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm rubbing myself thinking about those days when we got those Marlon Day games, man.
Especially the games that started the pre-game at 12-30.
We could completely have that.
I think the 11-08 and the 12-30 sounds like a real cleaner to me, baby.
Because that was my first reaction when I had that breathless call from Duffin Clarence.
I said, okay, well, you know, if you want to put it, I sound for like 15 minutes.
That's okay.
As long as nobody loses a diamond pay, as long as I get paid for all of the spots whether I do them or not, and all these things, they said, oh, okay, sure.
And that's it.
Well, we're on the clock.
We have to sit here and wait.
Not like we can be out there.
Well, first they tried to grind me down a little bit with this business about, well, you know, uh, Phyllis wants to know, uh, since we're eliminating two breaks at 10 o'clock, they're not going to be on 10 to 10-30.
Uh-huh.
And do I want to do those live spots there like at the ass end of other breaks?
Did I say this?
No.
Yeah. And I said, no, but I'm still going to get paid for them.
In other words, they want me to start hoeing up this show so we have these long pondress.
And that ain't going to happen here.
See, one thing that they don't understand, length of listenership, they don't get that, understand it at all.
In fact, what they do understand, I have no idea what it is yet.
Don't you?
Sports.
No, no, they don't understand that because they're like showing that out.
They did all of a sudden, like one day they woke up and decided, you know something that's this for the birds.
Because when you started seeing those comments from Eddie Jones and the dolphin to organization about how they would prefer being on a station that's all sports and it makes more sense for the dolphins.
And about the fact that they're a little bit nervous about starting in the first place, he's on the station that the Eagles are on.
There are three or four other NFL teams that he's on the station, the flagship station that carries the games.
Probably the FM that carries them, you know, but he's on those stations.
Yeah.
So while there have to be a problem in South Florida, they got enough problems with their own. It seemed to me the dolphins organization with a horsecat coach.
It would no real quarterback and would Ricky Tickey, a busy smoking up a storm.
They got enough other problems, a fish to fry.
But that just shocked me that all in Greg Reach's as well. The chances are 50, 50 and whatever in we'll see after this season.
In other words, they're basically willing to write off the dolphins and who knows about this whole Marlon business, which you better not mention anything about that about this business.
Right?
Because Greg is making comments to very jackass about well, you know, sports is very expensive, format and it's hard to do this.
I don't know. I have no idea what happened. Like I was going to get religion.
And we shouldn't be complaining because we've been not going to hold sports news thing from day one.
Since we walked in that door and discovered that we were like in a mental institution of people just overly obsessive with, you know, 12-year-old kids with great arms.
We're going to be all start quarterback someday in the NFL, crap like that.
Not to mention, of course, and a big bald head.
515 votes on the poll. It's, I don't know, come see, come see. I just, I don't know.
I guess it's kind of a good day to be honest. You're like I'm talking to myself basically.
Yeah.
Am I?
Did you say something?
What South Florida event of the past year do you think was the most important? Marlins win the World Series 202.
Nice going David Sampson and Jeffrey Loria. We love you both.
Well, WQM brings back Howard Stern 103-20%.
Did you do a poll and a kind of poll on Stern coming on or not?
Yeah. What should take on Howard Stern coming to QAM overwhelmingly positive?
Right. Like 1%. Like 50 solid 49% for the option. Finally WQM has a morning show.
Right.
And then the only like four choices, but it was overwhelming.
Overweighting.
I mean, they didn't come in the middle of the poll and make you take it off the air.
No, not that. No.
WQM brings back Howard Stern next money to 60 103 people.
The heat gets Shack 75 who are obsessed with just can't get over it.
More Howard data that feels in for suspended. Hank Goldberg, 49.
Third channel dumps Howard Stern 47.
Ricky Williams, your tire is 35 and WRFX drops sports 8.
8 ain't that great in the sunshine state.
There's 8 who just are Jones in for a baby.
They want that sports back on 9.40.
Could happen.
I'm thinking it could happen.
Like if if air America goes belly up and there's definitely a possibility of that.
And what do they do then? Right.
Because most of the shows they're carrying are from air America.
They can always keep Randy on air, but she's on tape anyway.
So wouldn't surprise me if they got like waiting in the wings.
Oh, guess what?
The next Monday we're going back to WRFX cars.
We had so many call from so many Ben Overture listeners.
Plus of course QAM has decided to go in another direction.
So we decided for our loyal sports nerds that we're going by.
Wouldn't shock me at all. I can about three weeks.
WRFQAM, hello.
Hey, how are you doing?
Pretty good.
How much about the crann call you if it's always living?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Why 9 is always good though.
QAM, hello.
Who nervous to talk? Never mind.
What do you say?
Two nervous to talk. Never mind.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
But thanks for calling, pali.
Is our dear departed old friend we'll always say in her inimitable way.
Thanks for calling.
Well I sure miss her.
Yeah.
The world just isn't the same since she moved on.
Hey.
Somebody QAM, hello.
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
Now that was one of Howard's people.
Is there any doubt?
I think that was Howard.
Was that Howard?
David.
Or was that Don Johnson?
Somebody QAM, hello.
Yes, I'd like to discuss my pleasure with the radio station bringing Howard Stern back.
Go for Red Head.
Take all the time you want.
Well my feeling is it's repetitive.
Bores, soft, moroc, bathroom humor and peanut envy.
Yeah.
I think what the radio station should do apparently listening to the lack of intellect with the colors.
Let's have 12 hours of Howard Stern.
Well by 12 hours of NFL football.
It seems to be whatever anybody wants to talk about.
No chance for any intellectual stimulation at all.
If you can't, if you can't, anything.
No way, wait a minute.
Is the intellectual stimulation in soft Florida?
You're welcome to joking me.
So I've been on you for almost 30 years in this town and you're telling me that this is a place that's looking for intellectual stimulation?
You know, and if you do listen to the radio talk shows alternative, everything is just so flamptied or laughter-right.
I mean there's no non-biased talk shows on the radio down here.
It's absolutely disgusting.
Yeah.
Two quick questions before we get back to our important Howard Stern colors.
Any chance in my lifetime of seeing a viable party so we have a Republican Democratic alternative?
No.
I only wish, but the answer is no.
And on a lighter note, your favorite all-time Maple Leaf hockey player?
All-time favorite, Maple Leaf hockey Johnny Bauer.
I'm right with you.
Mine would be Dave Keon.
Great.
I'll go.
And maybe someday the Leafs will make up with Dave Keon and make them in for their bad way they created him.
Oh, that's horrible.
That number's not hanging from the Raptors.
Right, amen.
Have a good day, sir.
And back to you.
Yeah, let's talk some hockey.
What do you say?
As a matter of fact, I'm so glad he called.
I know you're not.
If you want to have a little horse racing from Philadelphia Park.
What's wrong with that?
What's that?
Oh, like $50.
Oh, they're in the middle of the spot.
Maybe there's something you're setting on Leafs TV, do you think?
We miss the Leafs.
Oh, I can tell you right now if you're just going to be here.
Let's see, changing date.
What is this all about with my damn cable here?
Or at least lunch with Bill Waters.
He's got a big stomach and a big mouth.
You're OK with my book, Bill.
OK?
Got a big mouth and not afraid to use it.
Just like somebody we know.
That was funny.
I just, I don't know.
It's good.
Like I said, it's a very good thing that I'm only on these two days a week until the end of the month because I can't.
I don't like this.
I don't like it at all.
I want everybody involved in those unenvolved including Gary Sarner and everybody else don't ever come here again at home, Gary.
I just, I don't like it.
I don't feel comfortable with the situation where people keep telling us,
I mean, isn't that supposed to be what this show is all about?
Yeah.
Isn't this where the audience comes to hear all the inside stuff and here really going on and they're cut away to BS and they're ripped the hell out of the management deservedly so.
And you know, oh,
and this below me that this excuse which I don't want to say what it is because that that would be self-defeating.
But this below me that they came up with this morning is the why we can't do that.
And that is so marginal.
I think I'm some kind of a moron.
Yeah.
No, they just know that it was payday.
I want to make sure that check was there.
That's all.
Roy, you folks over there in Naples, man, you need mental help.
And it's like a whole schizophrenic operation now.
They want Howard's stirring on the one hand, but on the other hand, don't say this and don't say that.
We got this broad name Joyce who fancies himself with some kind of an FCC attorney over there who doesn't know where asked for my elbow.
And she's over there.
Oh, you can't say, you can't say, you can't say, you can't say, you know, anything with a bag.
Maybe she's an old bag.
Maybe that's your problem.
Hey.
Yeah.
God, you can't do anything.
So on the one hand, they want to be wild and crazy and cutting edge.
I mean, it should work well with for well.
I don't know question about that.
Didn't that work out real well?
Sure.
They just don't know.
I've known some people like that.
They don't know what direction they want to go in.
Have I met people like that?
They got like one foot in and one foot out.
By the way, how about the outing of all those Republican, like, and that's his Republicans, but the Democratic Senator Barbara McCulsky from Maryland,
as if there was any doubt about that, uh, dyke.
But how about Mark Foley?
Yeah.
Candice Masmacho, Norma Kent or Mark Foley.
I think Norm's got a beat.
Now, what is Charlie Christ having come in with Jesus Christ?
Five, six, uh, although I see I like that.
I like that business.
All these, all these self-hating fags, all these people like Alice Rantel, who was dragged out of the closet by his little boyfriends there on WFTO that one day, many years ago.
And as I'm escalating as a make-believe right-wing talk show host, who are you kiddin' sweetheart?
Okay?
Man, you can charner-dated Cassidy this week.
Find that little boy, face-to-face, he's five-sickies.
The rate is all yours now.
Happy way, man.
All these deliveries in New Jersey.
What would be this, didn't he?
In January, in January, I just want to allow him.
I'm a rat-sack, would think I'm beautiful on a young sat-sack.
But looking at Jack will love me for my mind.
Sometimes sports could be a love story of simple-minded sport-holes about their athletic idols.
I know that Jack would think I'm beautiful on the inside too.
Hello, I'm Professor Irwin Cory, founder of eJockadate.com.
I think, uh, I think Ricky Williams will love me.
But I have got you.
Those who are intimidated by women find comfort in the deep dimensions of idle worship.
Only Jack knows the secrets of my soul.
Outside of detailing their escalate for a poetry tip, it probably will never happen.
But we sure like to give you hope.
Let us help you.
There's a lot of lowly sport-holes out there.
For a free one-month trial to be applied to your credit card, in case you don't remember.
Call 1-888-athletic chocolate popsicle.
So I am to them go to team in that the world league of American football.
Do you think Ricky ought to sign up with whatever the name of that team is?
What's that?
The Saturday night with my one radio news from land 930 on your AM dial and up a worldwide website at www.sjnapelleast.ca.
Anyway, what about that Frank Mahavallichum and Daryl Sidler?
5-670560.
Tom 560.
He wanted to get his many of these Howard Steer and welcome Howard to South Florida causes of a possibility of a between now and two.
And then the other guy that was lamenting the fact that it's entertainment.
Okay, it's show business.
It's a radio show.
That's what it is.
You like it?
Fine, if not, good luck to you.
This guy is searching for intellectual, you know, he wants his intellect to be fed in South Florida.
Good luck to you, Pali.
The average IQ in South Florida is like minus infinity.
Or shouldn't I can't say infinity?
Am I?
Right.
WQAM, hello.
WQAM, hello.
Boy, what do you think is going to happen to Old Paul and Young douchebag ratings when Howard comes on?
See, this guy said the D word.
We can't say that.
Joyce said we can't say the bag word.
How do you like that?
I know that's embarrassing.
I'm sure that they're going to be saying that on certain other shows, but that's okay.
We won't.
Because Joyce said you won't, and you don't, and you can't.
But he does bring up a good point, but that says repetitive.
I already brought that up earlier.
Being as stupid as I am, and that is...
David Ross already answered that question in that memo.
Well, that's right.
David Ross in the confidential clear channel memo, which you can read on our website,
neo-writers.com, and it's in charity, of course.
Right, after you finish looking at the Ricky Williams video, which will give you a few laughs.
But anyway, once you get through reading David Ross's brilliant comments, you'll understand.
They think I'd nothing to fear, but to fear itself.
Right, they've got no other...
They don't know the rest of your elbow.
They have no clue what they'll install about.
And look at all the controversy we're going to have on QAM.
And the fact that he wrote the memo indicates that they're in a total state of panic,
and they're crappin' on each other 24 hours a day.
They have a question about that.
They've got that wall of men.
Oh, yeah, right.
I think Duff is a check in the box today in Naples.
Or is that during fantasy fest?
56670560,
pound 560, 180 and T,
and Verizon Wireless Line.
Seriously, working for a Greg Read and these people, it's an experience.
No, the audience doesn't believe me.
They think I exaggerate that it's all stick.
Like the thing with me and Moe, like that was stick.
I still think it over that.
You both?
Because anybody who was even close, I mean within a hundred miles of the situation,
had to know that there was nothing, no stick involved with that stuff.
Absolutely.
Man, you talk about the great hate.
And then of course, he had the great hate with Hank,
which there's some certain irony in there, the fact that he's filling in,
of course, now while Hank is whatever.
I'm telling you, you don't want to believe me.
He's a whole new person now since he's got the new due.
Moe?
Yeah.
So in other words, you're telling me that you're in favor of this situation?
No, it doesn't say for anything.
Is that what you're saying?
You're saying you're back.
I'm my close, fat, personal friend.
I would never mean, Hank, go keep them on you.
I'm just saying that he's, uh, his son ever said it.
He's got a whole new attitude.
It's amazing to see.
Well, I, it was Samson in reverse with Samson.
They cut their property, became a real worsen.
And with Moe, they chopped off the old paste, the, uh,
wig, they cut off the lapage's glue,
and all of a sudden it became like a munch.
Is what you're trying to tell him?
He's present.
He smells better.
I believe it when I smell it.
W.A.M. Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Since they've grown, A.K.A.
John Mark.
I got a message for George.
What message will he make?
I'm going to kick your ass.
Come on in.
Come on over to Rome.
Come on over to Rome.
Come on over to Rome is the A-Chamba guy, huh?
It's Jerome.
He works as the, uh, at the guard house and manages, uh, complex.
It's a guard house where?
He's a guard.
He's the guard house monkey.
He sits there and waves pad.
And where, where does he do this?
Do we have a man to slip?
No, Miguel won't tell me.
Oh, but we do know, though.
Yeah.
Oh, well, I got news for you.
He may not tell you, but he'll tell me.
Oh, we'll get to the bottom of that.
That will be on the air.
And your, Tom, your days will be over.
We have to find a new hobby.
I have no life to Rome.
What kind of a name is that?
Anyway, to Rome.
Is really the Al Jero.
Huh?
Is really, I was told.
He's in Israel.
Oh, holy cow.
Never mind.
He did that fruit cake.
If they used to call me an I.N.Z.
Another, uh, not a job.
Man, oh, man.
What, uh, talk about a competition in terms.
A scene is really.
I didn't know we were messing with him.
Yeah, yeah.
Quick, man.
He's going to come and kick your ass, right?
What over here?
You show up at the station tomorrow, okay?
Learn.
And they're going to drag Jeff high in there on a stretcher.
And he's going to kick your ass.
I can't believe that he had a CIA, huh?
Sure I can.
Yeah.
How can he not believe it?
Well, I mean, I had two of them.
I was very lucky, but I ain't going to have another one.
I'll guarantee you that.
Only gained two pounds of my vacation,
George's old game, two.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
All right.
It would have been a lot more than that.
I wouldn't have been for all that exercise.
Good food in Germany, man.
Food and Amsterdam sucks.
If you want food in Amsterdam, go to McDonald's and eat that crap.
Or go to the Albert Heine convenience store there on the dam rack.
Don't eat the Dutch food.
It'll kill you.
The worst.
Oh, man.
When you go to Holland for the first time, if you ever do,
or if you've been to Amsterdam, you see all those real skinny, squatty people.
They look like they just came from Bergen Dalsen on a bad day.
You'll understand because they don't eat anything.
And if you lived there, you wouldn't either.
Because the food is crap.
Kaka.
How come it is that Germany, which is right next to Holland,
if you look on the map, has got such fantastic food, man.
The sausage is in the worst and the veneration.
So all the German food is magnificent.
God, they got great food.
And you go right across the border on the train,
and you get in the Holland.
It's like fat.
Everything is crap.
Must have seemed to cross the North Sea from England, I think.
When you think?
I would think.
Some of that spotted slick cod.
Maybe some of those cockle farmers can tell us about it.
I think there are shuckers.
WQA and hello.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to challenge that humbagot.
That's the same.
Oh, brother.
Wow.
How many times?
How many times are you going to get with it?
Huh?
I have no life.
I have no life.
I have no life.
Absolutely.
Jesus.
WQA and hello.
Did not.
Well, when are we going to get a female colored in?
That's not a wrong number.
We're in a week.
A couple.
A couple, but you know.
Just a couple.
Nothing to write home about now.
Pretty sad.
Where have all the ladies gone, man?
We used to do good on IOD with ladies,
and of course we got a misfortune station,
which now don't want to be a sports station anymore.
They don't know what they want to be.
They're all over the place.
Oh, we want to be really wild.
But don't say this, and don't say that,
and don't talk about this.
WQA and hello.
How is the student in Shiburong?
Good.
WQA and hello.
Marikita, Marigold.
You know, that's the same guy.
That's the second to the time of the last couple months.
The same guy.
How is the student in Shiburong?
See, I don't really care because how it's turned
don't get any diaries and self-photos.
Okay.
He doesn't make me any money.
So I really don't give a flying crap on how it's turned.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
that you know? Did he kill anybody that you know? And then he says, well, you know, yeah,
I mean, fellow human beings. And then I don't know where. I don't know where. Here comes
the South Florida tie. There's old lady comes on and goes, he killed those lilies.
I love that you're living to me. Yeah. It's just so sad. And you know, he scared this thing.
I guess they're coming into the selection. The only thing that matters is I'll tie that.
You know, what we're doing with our tax on the social situation, the education, health care.
Now, the fact of the matter is there shouldn't be any more out kind of. We would have spent all
billions of dollars that we flushed down the toilet killing all these people in sacrificing our kids in a rack.
And we would have spent that on a real fight on terrorists. And then there wouldn't be any more out kind of what they lie to us through their teeth
about numerous times, by the way. Anyway, it's just unbelievable to hear. I just, but when she came up and said,
I think she was really, I just, that was it for me. I just, just remember one thing. Sir, the bush people are the evil
deravers you'd know ever forget it. Meal, love it. Love me. Love me. I'd be glad to back. See you. 56670560, pound 560 on the 18 and see.
See, Bush has this tremendous appeal in America because he's stupid around the rest of the world where they may not smell so good.
At least they got a brain. He don't have any appeal. In fact, they hate him like poison. I mean like poison.
Or unfortunately they happen to hate a lot of Americans like poison out too because it's by association.
It used to be in fact right after 9-11. That was a high point in the history probably of this country in terms of worldwide respect.
Everybody sympathized for us. They loved us. They, whatever they could for us. And then he turned that goodwill of the world around and just into hate.
In no time at all. High school in W. And don't forget what they say until the sea in Texas. Once and more on, always and more on.
And then what they say. Shame on you. Got trained. Yeah.
Yeah. We would.
Can't give food again.
We'll see it in O'Choppy, W. In fact, maybe he can return O'Choppy with his brother too with his fat ass brother.
How I still I just shake my head. How that man got reelected. Just lie through his teeth.
Fixed the election with his girlfriend, Catherine Harris. He's got some issues by the way. Catherine we can talk about that bitch.
Yeah. Leeker or liar. Catherine Harris of the center of a brand new storm. Either leak classified information or came up with a huge whopping lie.
She wouldn't do that. Which he wouldn't be involved in at the focus election in 2000. Which he must have just made it all up.
From that chapter one at five sixty W. And when you're moving or renovating, that's the best time to dial one eight hundred mattress.
Make that first night in your dream house. Heavenly with a brand new top quality brand name mattress from dollar mattress.
You pick the date and time for delivery. Different you're moving schedule. Don't forget they need to our window that's convenient for you and they'll be there.

Well, the bison office needs you to sign the table.
I don't know about that.
The crew has a good taste and weight.
Ladies, I've just been informed that we hit a nice point.
A bad day.
Well, 18 at five sixty W.A.M.
Whenever Paul's political jockey is getting a little chat about election 2000,
at some point the conversation turns into the exploits of Catherine Harris.
As Florida Secretary of State, Catherine Harris,
Rose overnight on a virtual anonymity center,
the political hurricane surrounding the disputed 2000 presidential election.
In 2002, recovered from her electoral travail,
which she'd entailed copiously in her book,
Center of the Storm, practicing principal leadership in times of crisis.
Catherine Harris ran and was elected to Congress.
By the way, do you hear about her plane?
No, what about it?
Now, representative Harris's experiencing more anger.
She appears to be at the center of another storm.
This one having to do with the accuracy of her marks.
She made it a Bush rally in Florida,
and whether she'd leak classified information.
How do you like that?
Oh, my God.
On Monday, August 2, speaking at a rally for President Bush in Venice,
Florida, Harris told the crowd that the administration had tormented
over 100 terrorist plots.
She also claimed that a plot existed to blow up the power grid
and Carmel in the end of the AP reported.
According to an hour, August 4, AP's story,
Harris told the audience that while she was in the Midwest recently,
the mayor of Carmel told her how a man of Middle Eastern heritage
had been arrested in hundreds of kilograms of explosives
were found in his home.
He had plans to blow up the area's entire power grid she was reported saying.
The major thing wrong with Harris's story,
Carmel City officials in AP interviews claimed they knew of no such plot.
We're aware of the comments we read in the paper said,
Tim Green, assistant chief of police in Carmel,
a town of short distance from Indianapolis,
were not aware of any plans to blow up Carmel's power grid.
Nancy Hakeh spoke swoon for Carmel Mayor Jim Brainerd said,
the mayor never talked to Catherine Harris.
They never had that conversation.
Did Catherine Harris disclose classified information?
Or is it the case if we're not doing what she's talking about?
In August 4th, press release from Harris's Congressional Office,
courts are saying,
I regret that I had no knowledge of the sensitive nature of this situation,
but she stood by her comments that the US's tormented potential attacks in last three years,
which she said was based on classified information.
Actually, it's been more than a hundred she told the Sarasota hero of Tribune August
they're adding, it's classified, obviously not classified to me,
but things I can't go into details about,
kind of like the Hopper situation.
She said only the specifics of the tormented attacks were classified,
or statement also pointed out the need for each of us to remain alert and vigilant in fighting terrorism.
Catherine Harris is the reason why so many government officials have a credibility problem,
either they don't know what they're talking about or they're violating their own security rules
and who knows which is the case here.
Stephen Aftongood, editor of secrecy news,
a publication of the Federation of American Sciences told me.
At an October 2001 press availability alongside Chancellor Schroeder of Germany,
President Bush was asked to talk about what prompted him to write the memo to Congress
about briefing on intelligence matters, why do you think such restrictions are appropriate?
The President replied that he felt it was important to send a clear signal to Congress
that classified information must be held dear, that there's a responsibility that if you're receiving a briefing or classified information,
you have responsibility.
And some members did not accept that responsibility, some didn't, some do whatever this says.
So I took it apart myself to notify leadership of the Congress that I intend to protect our troops.
The President also said it is unacceptable behavior to leak classified information
when we have troops at risk.
In December 2001, U.S. Department of Justice report titled Attorney General Ashcroft
announces in-oragency task force review ways to combat leaks of classified information.
The Attorney General made it clear that leaks of classified information do substantial damage
to the security interests of the nation, the Daily Miss Lead,
a project of move on.org reported in early August.
In October 2002 letter from Attorney General John Ashcroft to Dennis Haster,
the Attorney General promised that uncompromising attention will be paid to the prosecutor's
classified information are deterred by the real prospect of productive investigations
and strict applications of appropriate penalties that will have no reason to stop their harmful actions,
he be saying.
Integrity is the right thing when no one else is around, Catherine Harris said in a radio interview recently,
for a study and you're going to build that kind of character, and if it wasn't for the difficult times,
we'd never have a chance to grow.
After her recent remarks, Harris has clearly forged another growth opportunity
while the President called Catherine Harris into the Oval Office to find out what information she may have disclosed,
will Attorney General Ashcroft unleash the investigatory powers of his office
to get to the bottom of the Harris revelations?
According to the Sarasota Hero Tribune, a staff member of the U.S. House Premium and Select Committee on Intelligence,
which oversees the nation's intelligence operation, said he had heard of no such plot.
I'm waiting for the other shoot-and-drop.
If her comments about the Kromel Indian incident were true,
I expected to come out within hours or days after good,
and I might call into question the future of her ability to receive class of information at Settlement School.
I even liked that.
Catherine Harris, you could be a liar or a worse...
Or a...
Or a...
Or a big mouth.
Do you have a surgery yet a big mouth?
Well, it's plain to see.
That's what I'm hearing.
5670560, pound 560.
See, I'm thinking that these bedtime stories, which, you know, it's a little bit of work,
I mean, we'll put them on our website.
But you think the steering people want to read those bedtime stories?
I know he's got a few on his website now, at least trying to dump bush.
So maybe if he would have thought about dumping bush and all these right-wingers before all the FCC started back in February,
maybe that would have been a really good idea instead of, you know,
when you sleep with the enemy, that's what Judy Roberts find out.
You got a real tourists.
But what I'm saying is that, who knows?
Because I don't think they're compatible with that audience.
You know, I mean, we have our own audience, obviously.
But if we're going to grow this enormous audience, we're going to be growing by leaps and bounds.
What do you think?
Probably.
Yeah, I agree.
Somebody QA and Hello?
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
I'm Ryan.
Hey, I like this idea that you and Howard guys are going to call this that out of the interesting.
Yeah.
But I got my question to you, Neil, is this show is it's that it's indicated that the one that he does normally,
throughout the whole, you know, the whole nation, or is this going to be where all is?
What, what are you talking about, sir?
You look like you.
It's QIM.
He just did a show just strictly for QIM or the first time.
Of course, now, it's just a show.
How is here in show?
He's on like 40 some stations, man.
Get, get some help.
We're going to please.
I have no, right?
Oh, God.
Uh, he's going to do a special show during the commercial breaks on his, uh,
syndicated show.
He's going to come running into another studio.
He's going to be courted.
He's going to be courted.
He's strictly just for QA.
Right.
Right.
He'll be talking about sports.
There you go.
And about what's happening on Biscayne Boulevard and what's happening up there on Las Vegas.
Las Vegas, Las Vegas.
Hey, recalls, Las Vegas.
Mm-hmm.
Now, what's going on here?
Are we having a power failure here or something where I am?
Where you are?
Yeah.
I don't think so.
But there's something clicking and fuking over there.
One of the computer.
Will that be something?
Somebody QA him?
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Great.
Listen, I've listened to you for years.
I'm 35 years old.
I can't thank you very much.
I haven't, I still enjoy listening to you.
But I have to be honest with you.
Yes.
And I can't really call other shows and complain.
Well, I guess I can.
But you know what?
I don't know why this guy, Howard Davider, Moe, is on the air.
Honestly.
Yeah.
I do not know.
Can you tell me why they keep this guy on the air?
Because they're stupid.
Because they refuse.
Because they don't want to pay him off to go away.
If they were smart, they would pay him off.
They'd say, you've got a year and a half left on the deal.
We're going to write you a check.
You continue with the dolphins, too.
Your contract with them is up.
See, he's got a separate deal with the dolphin games.
And if they want to continue with them, that's up to them.
But that's over and above his QA deal.
So he can continue doing the dolphin games.
And they could just pay him to go away.
It wouldn't be the first time that's been done.
But they, I don't know.
It looks to me like they, you know, they don't want to pay anybody off.
You know, Neil, I'm an honest guy.
I think he does a great job doing the dolphin games.
I listen to him on Monday night football for years.
Prior to him coming here.
But you know what, Neil?
He's just not, he didn't do what he said he was going to do.
And revolutionized talk, response, talk radio.
I mean, he never did that.
And, you know, he said sports talk is boring.
And then he said about to prove it.
And I think he did a pretty good job.
You know, I think he did that.
And it's like, you can unwrap all the slime all the time.
And for him to try to take over Hammer Spot,
because I know what's going on there.
Maybe you guys can't talk about it.
But ESPN knows another radio show, another radio gig.
And that's where he's going.
And obviously the little dog is going over there.
You already went over there.
Well, they've been, the heck is not going there.
That's what was in the paper yesterday, I think.
Yeah, well, you know, I hope he doesn't.
But if he does, you know, I definitely won't be listening to four clock.
And you guys show him, sorry.
But I thought as long as Mo's on the air there, so.
But I love you.
I love you, Neil.
No matter what.
Okay, Pali.
Thanks for the look, Jack.
Have a great day.
All right.
Okay.
So what's this guy trying to say?
You don't like Mo?
Absolutely.
Come on, man.
Mo is a new man.
That's what George is campaigning.
He must have done something to you or with you or about you or...
Let me try.
Let me rub his head.
Wow.
It was pinkly.
Back in the day, I might say something about that, but...
I might end up...
Oh, it's George William Faisish.
You way, yeah.
For you, George Pacon.
And another thing.
You're the loser of me.
You're the loser of the big star.
By now.
It definitely gets a bit sweet voice.
And you expect to get anyway a little beauty feel.
We shape you.
And I think it's a bit of a...
I don't know what this is.
It's very, very white.
I don't know what this is.
The more white you hear.
Yeah, what a pro.
The more white I hear.
The more white I hear.
What do I hear?
I play not me.
Yeah.
I want to die.
I'm your secretary.
No, no, no.
He's a role.
He's in a role.
He's in a role.
Why you why you're a spank you.
Then why?
I know my smell attract you.
But unlike you.
You still got such a...
I feel just like that you are my kid rudder.
And one year too another.
That's why you're so much buying.
This is...
This is this.
This is this.
This is this.
The joy, the joy, the joy, the joy.
The joy, the joy, the joy.
The joy, the joy, the joy.
I want to show him what you...
In a cow.
I got to move in here.
Quake kill it.
Oh, but...
I guess enough.
27.02, mad dog.
I wonder what the mad dog's take is going to be.
One was the last time he was on.
I don't know.
I wouldn't be able to.
That's a week so.
Yeah.
I know it was not yesterday.
We had Curtis Stevenson was a guest-hoking yesterday,
which is why mad dog had such big numbers in the June.
A lot of Curtis.
All right, listen.
I just don't know what to make of this.
One thing about Greg Reed, I've always said,
there's the right way to do things,
and then there's the Greg Reed way to do it.
He's kind of like some of those Chinese always long, man.
Always.
At least he's consistent, consistently,
but as he breaks it again in 85 billion little pieces,
can Greg put the egg together again?
An SN Brussels airline
who made an emergency landing after an agitated passenger,
a cat, got out of the cockpit
and attacked the co-pilot the airline said today.
The flight yesterday from Brussels to Vienna, Austria,
had been in the air by 20 minutes when it was noticed
that a passenger's pet had escaped from its cage,
although it's not yet clear how,
according to an airline statement.
Once free, the animal proceeded to wander around the cabin,
slipping into the cockpit when meals were being delivered
to the two-man flight crew, it said.
At this stage, the animal became agitated and nervous,
and said an airline spokesperson added
that the cat scratched the co-pilot's arm.
The pilot don't they have microwaves on planes?
You think?
The pilot decided to return to Brussels
as a precaution in the 58 passengers
left Brussels two hours later.
Another flight the cat had been checked in Oslo Norway
in an internationally approved flight transport bag,
but the airline said it may end up changing its procedures
for pets in the cabin once it concludes its investigation.
At no time throughout the incident
was the passenger's security effect in any way they'd be saying.
SN Brussels never heard of it.
You? No.
Well, being the international flyer that you are,
right? Right.
By the way, the food on KLM sucks,
and they have no idea, no clue how to board a flight.
Man, it's just chaos.
When European Airlines board a flight, chaos.
Another reason I just pray,
I will get on my flying carpet and pray
that Air Canada never goes out of business,
because they sure know how to do it right.
But man, these international airlines are not all Italian.
KLM, it's just chaos.
It's part of that European pushy rude kind of thing.
You know, where everybody, they see one person
going toward the line,
and right away everybody's rushing up there.
Not just people with small children,
please, just business class,
and they're all pushing and shoving it.
And then they stink, too.
Now, seriously, my love affair with the Europe
is many fantastic places there are to visit
and to see and to the food and a lot of things.
It's tempered greatly by the fact that the hygiene
and the Europeans and a lot of the people
from other parts of the world who want to be there,
are just a little bit lacking.
You know, as other words, they stink.
And I wonder why that is,
because aren't we the colony?
Aren't we supposed to be the barbarians
and they're the continent, you know?
I don't know what the deal is.
I know as we smell a lot there in the Navy.
Maybe with the guys,
maybe we have something to do with that foreskin,
which seems to be an epidemic or all over.
You have to do a lot of stuff.
How the airing.
Things circumspect outside of that.
Exactly.
Already those many.
Yeah.
Five, six, seven, oh five,
sixty pound five.
Something stinks at QAM.
I'll tell you that.
We can't tell you what it is,
but something.
That's what I think it is right there.
I think it's sitting.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, back at you.
Oh, it ain't the rat anymore.
The rat?
Oh, the muskrat.
Right.
Somebody QAM, hello.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Pretty good.
It's like having Dave Ruth and Luke out back to back with you in hours.
Number three, number four.
And the other thing,
Howard mentioned last week when he was talking about Heiseng.
Heiseng has been flying around Jeb Bush when his private plane.
That's the reason why he ain't on,
and Bush gives him gifts like caps on rental car damages
and all kinds of stuff like that.
Oh, my God.
And political favors.
That's the reason why he doesn't want Howard Stern on his patients.
You there?
Listen, I didn't follow it.
I don't understand.
Okay.
Well, he's for Heiseng and Bush are friends, Jeb.
Yeah.
So Howard Stern has been a real,
as much of a critic of George Bush's,
he will have lately.
Yeah.
So Jeb doesn't want Jeb and Heiseng are friends.
Right.
And Jeb gives Heiseng a political favor.
Yeah, come on.
Well, what does that have to do with Howard Stern?
Well, Howard Stern's criticized him as brother.
He doesn't want George Bush by any stretch of the imagination.
It's fact Robin announced this morning that if George Bush gets in,
she's gone.
She's gone to another country.
Yeah.
That's what she said first.
Well, I got a head start on both of them,
money like that.
Yeah. Well, she'll be with you.
But, you know, they,
that's the political end of it.
That's the reason why they,
they's the officer,
are hesitating about being on your station
because Jeb and Heiseng are,
are, are, that's funny.
Well, how do you like them, apples?
That clears it up for me.
That's amazing.
We'll pack up a Salami sandwich, ma'am.
One other thing, one of the Howard Davidson.
Yeah.
How come these guys like Howard,
why they seem furious about things like Ricky Williams or Jack or whatever,
what, when they're obviously,
obviously these, these other things in the world that mean so much more than this,
not.
You say, I can understand if somebody is going to pay me to talk about sports
or to pay me to talk about them,
whatever the topic is,
and that's what I'm hired to do.
I can understand that, you know,
that's what you're going to be more interested in.
But, but I agree with it.
That's what turns me off is they take it to such a level like it's,
like they appeal only those people are so intense and share the same kind of,
one-dimensional mindset.
I can't relate to it.
I hate it.
The only one that does Ed Kaapard,
he's, he's good with, with a social conscience.
Now these other guys are just,
it's ridiculous.
They're just, you know,
a lot of them.
You like to, it's not.
Good luck to us, pal.
We have a great thing.
Thank you.
So you go back to what the guy said before about Mo, and about Hank,
and about this one.
See, I've said this before you know, naturally because we all eat out of
the same trough.
And I don't see too many under-fed people at our stations,
we must be in a lot.
But, you know, we'd, we'd love to see people listen to QM 24 hours a day,
or at least all of their waking hours.
Now that ain't going to happen.
It's just, you know, people don't do that.
Unless, of course, they're Hispanic and they write down WQBA.
But, it's just unrealistic.
So the way I live my life is like, for example, when I watch television,
I know this is a, I don't watch networks.
I don't watch, I don't watch, you see what I'm saying?
I watch programs that I like.
I watch shows that I eat a lot of food.
Right.
That I find are interesting.
I watch A&E investigative reports, which I think is a great show.
I watch whatever, huh?
I'm agree with it.
Yeah.
But whatever I like.
So whether I mean we've got 80 million channels,
and the same with radio.
And it gets a little ponderous to me.
I mean, I don't mind less than people blow off a little steam.
But Jesus, I mean, we're not going to be able to, you know,
and just when we thought we had the world by the balls here,
and we're after this great book, and then we got Stern coming on next Monday,
and now it's like we got another crisis,
because Greg Reed cannot write a business without having a crisis every damn week.
I've never seen anything like it.
Every time you turn around, he's another crisis,
because he doesn't know how to deal with people.
That's the biggest problem of all.
He won't deal with people.
Everything is behind the back through some other condo,
which you duff through clearance, through this one.
Never a face-to-face or even a,
the last phone conversation I had from that man was,
what is it about?
A year and a half ago?
They're dots.
Then he called and congratulated me on a great rating book,
and by the way, I've decided to terminate your dreaded rigors,
because somebody, I don't want to make you no name.
We're throwing a hissy fit about those emails.
Which is just a humorous, funny thing,
and then later I apologize.
Well, you know, I'm going to carry it away.
It's always like a bad marriage with that guy.
Always slapping a, you know, beaten the wife up,
and I'm sorry, honey, I didn't really get it.
I wasn't a bad guy.
That kind of thing.
Yeah.

No.
No.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
No, no.
Maybe we should take this call from our special guest, Roberto L'Auongo.
Hi, a riboito.
You know that I'm the voices of dancers now?
Yes.
Aren't you that squeaky-boy scut that goes by all the time?
Oh, no, no, no.
You got me confused with a character on another show.
That's not me.
I have children, you know.
Door, door, door.
You have a funny name.
What did you just call me?
What did you do?
Do I end up?
Do I, do I die?
We can't get into that right now.
Do it on me, or next.
Do it on me, or next.
Hey, guys.
I want to walk in that neighborhood, just get me.
Hey, hey.
I'm pretty wild.
Come here.
I can go.
I want to crush you with things like to do the thing.
Yeah.
147.
I forgot about Joe Gunt and Suspended, too.
That's another part of Greg Reads' or Kind of Garden.
Lots of suspensions.
Now, you never got suspended.
Almost got fired, dude.
Right, it's a, uh, door, door, door.
It's a new fun buddy there.
I don't do suspensions.
I already told them that right up front.
I don't do suspensions.
Paid or unpaid.
Damn it.
It's for, like, school kids.
But it's part of the Greg Reads' and what is it?
It's part of the corner.
Yeah, that's right.
You know, I was president of my eighth grade class
when I was in elementary school.
Yeah.
I guess they don't call it that anymore.
Well, whatever they call it.
It's all about it.
What do they call it?
Is it?
Yes.
Watson.
And, uh, we, one of the things that I had to do was order the class rings
for the graduating class.
Okay.
And whatever, I don't remember.
I mean, it's about a hundred years ago.
But I was like a little party and getting around the final details of it.
And Miss Halfer, that was her name.
A nasty orb, Dyke.
I mean, she was my, uh, history teacher.
She was the one who did the nint of the Pint and the Sint of Marinta.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm serious.
But at any rate, so, uh, she, she had me come up with the kids that were rewriting,
or whatever they're doing, or taking a test.
Has me come up to her desk to ask me about, uh, did I do this?
And I had to give her the answer.
There wasn't, it would take another few days.
What, uh, go back to desk and stand.
Do you know what that's like?
Yeah, he really liked it.
It was like 29 of your peers, or kids sitting, you know, sitting at the door.
And they watched you stand there.
I should have taken a broom and stuck it so far up her ass that it's a handle,
would have come out through her earlobe.
Is that incredible or what?
Go back to your desk and stand.
Well, that's the way QAM operates.
You know, go back to your desk and stand.
Go back to your microphone and stand there and dummy up and you're suspended.
Everybody sooner or later gets suspended.
So that Greg can feel like a real man, which believed you'll meet from what I hear.
He's not.
What South Florida vendor of the past year, do you think, was the most,
see a real man, he can talk to you face to face.
He can have a conversation without like ping in his pants.
He isn't going to avoid your phone calls.
He isn't going to jerk you around.
He's not going to like take cat and mouse with you, like go into hiding all the time.
He's not going to go out of time on vacation right now with the most crucial time.
Just like when we first went on the air in a station seven years ago.
Where it was Greg, who was in a panic because he knew the equipment was all a piece of crap.
And it'd be a miracle if we ever got on the air, which by some miracle we did.
He was in Chicago with his family on vacation, hiding.
That's where he does best, hiding.
Anyway, now I get in the point across or what?
No, what he says, he's a piece of crap.
632 votes on the four, it's not too bad I guess.
What do you expect it's not like a simple lady, probably we have a lot of great choices on there, right?
Right.
What South Florida vendor of the past year, do you think, was the most important?
The Marlins win the World Series 349.
Even George is a little bit ripped up about them. I guess he's not.
No.
Even you would like to say, we did it!
Huh?
But I worked.
We.
Marlins win the World Series 249.
W2, it brings back how it's earned 129, 20.4%.
Not bad, not, I don't know.
I thought it'd be bigger than that.
The heat gets, what's his name?
Fuck!
Thank you.
88.
More how he did it, it fills in for the suspended.
There's another one of those suspensions.
Hey, Goldberg.
And let me say it again.
Hank has a name, okay?
The fact that he may be in some controversy right now, or is, that's a given.
And you know, we're not able to discuss it on here, the details in the way, well, for whatever contraburism they got.
But those are my, I don't want to tell other people what to do on the radio station, but it sounds so, so, horse ball, it sounds so bad!
Here are the given align up for a Neo-Zone today, or George is on them, or whatever, and then, uh, Mad Dog, and then Howard David, it fills the four to seven slides.
And if Fatso, is it Homo-san, he doesn't have a name anymore, is if we don't even know who the hell he was.
Let's not get too carried away, okay, with his, uh, obsessive obedience.
This is my suggestion.
Agreed?
I'm a Homo?
Homo, uh, Howard David, fills in for the suspended, Hank, over 57.
Clear Channel, Bumstar with Stern 54.
Ricky Williams with Tarras only 44.
Not even in the same category with, uh, what's his name?
All right!
No, not you, that one.
And WRFX Drop Sports, 11.
Way there in last place, holding up the S&L level, which is a pretty heavy number, considering their audience.
Considering their minuscule audience.
And if you think their audience is small, W-F-L-L isn't that, that 1400, that carbon-antis-foster station?
I reckon he's threatening to sue the ticket in ESPN because it was his idea, uh, uh, oh, please.
Line 9 is the best QAAM, hello.
Uh, oh, hey, you all go to bed.
WDQAAM, hello.
Hi, George.
Yes.
Question.
I've been away on vacation.
Is this your A-Sarner?
I wish it was, but it's not.
Do you hear the way that caller said it?
There was.
Question, that sounded just like your A-Sarner.
Question.
Go ahead, sir.
Yeah.
I'm just wondering what happened with all these sub-application?
What happened with all these inventions?
We can't tell you.
It's a big secret.
Call up, uh, uh, uh, Colin Powell.
Call up Don Wumsfeld.
Talk to Tom Ridge.
He'll give you some warnings about it, you know what I mean?
Oh my god.
Can't tell you.
All I can tell you is that at two o'clock, Jim Manditz will be on today.
The mad dog will be on him, make one of his rare summer appearances.
Howard, David, like it or not.
But they're going to be on four to six thirty this afternoon, filling in for the suspended hangover bird.
Six thirty Marlins on deck.
Cardinals at the Marlins 705 at TP Park up the street there from Muck Uaam and Eddie K after the baseball game is always.
All the pendable Eddie K.
Now there's a good guy who keeps his nose clean, right?
Never stole a freight train.
I think he'll go.
When you do as much gambling as Eddie does, you have to keep your nose clean.
If we are what we eat, then why don't we just eat better?
Well the truth of the matter is we are creatures of heaven.
When it comes to eating, we don't want to give up those comfort foods.
