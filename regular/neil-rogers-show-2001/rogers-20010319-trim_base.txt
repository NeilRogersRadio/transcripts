The Neil Roberts.
Anybody have a heart or a liver?
No.
You who are eaten so must take it so.
Protect your inside.
Don't say.
With even still.
Or grandmas.
Or even Neil.
Street.
You're never well.
Don't drink like hell.
You'll surely go back.
Oh please.
Just keep it clean.
It can't be fixed.
You'll need a donor.
Don't you ever party hard.
If you do, you could die.
Or just wait in a long life.
Oh, I say this cross me.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Come on.
Monday, Monday.
So good to me.
Monday morning.
Irvalva.
Oh, I hope it would be.
Sorry.
Oh, Monday morning.
Monday morning couldn't guarantee.
But Monday, you know you were still.
Be here with me.
I didn't know he was dead.
Monday, Monday.
Can't trust that day.
Monday, Monday.
Sometimes it just turns out that way.
Oh, Monday morning.
Do you hear me no more here?
Oh, what was to be?
Oh, Monday, Monday.
How could you read and not take me?
Every other day.
Every other day.
Every other day.
Every other day, all the week is fine.
Yeah.
But whenever Monday comes,
But whenever Monday comes,
It's funny time.
All of the time.
Monday, Monday.
So good to be.
Monday, Monday.
Irvalva.
I hope it would be.
Tua.
Monday, Monday morning.
Monday morning couldn't guarantee.
Is it going?
Monday, Monday.
You know you'll be here with me.
Every other day.
Every other day.
Every other day, all the week is fine.
Oh, have a Monday come.
And if I'm whenever Monday comes,
It's funny time.
Monday, Monday.
Monday, Monday.
And trust that day.
Monday, Monday.
It just turns out that way.
What?
Monday, Monday.
Monday, Monday.
Yeah.
I don't want to say I'm going to have a negative ring.
But Jesus Christ almighty.
I got some bad news for you.
I got some bad news.
Two down.
Why?
Two down.
I'm not talking about John Phillips.
I hear a crappy liver and was a bad user and drug.
I mean, you know,
Here's a mercury.
You realize you got a liver transplant in 1992?
No, I did not know that.
It's not too bad.
Nine years with somebody
else's liver without the bacon nuggets.
Can you imagine all the, you know,
having somebody else's lung because the liver
turns his out on a crap, you know,
everything goes through your liver.
But anyway, that's not getting to that.
And he said,
and of course, if she just wouldn't have eaten that pastrami on Rai,
do you think you lied about that?
I think that she choked on a sandwich.
I saw the whole VH one thing.
I don't care.
Maybe VH one lied about it.
I want to believe.
Don't mess.
It's like me talking about that.
You know,
don't take away the things that I want to hang on to.
I want to squeeze, you know,
just like I told my mother about that calendar.
Don't take away those good things.
And it makes me feel better as a fat person.
So you're not a fat person,
so you can't relate to it.
In fact, they were showing, you know,
the clips yesterday after John Phillips died.
And they got a LACNN and everybody
that's showing the old clips.
And I'm telling you,
she was as big as an apartment complex.
It could very easily be a fat person.
But you're not.
But you haven't got any idea.
Don't start giving me a son of an aunt about what it means to be fat.
You know nothing about fat, Mr.
because you don't have any.
Yeah, let's world power.
So anyway, she took down a sandwich just like Mary Olanza.
Now, was that also a funny story or did somebody
you verified that he took down a sandwich?
Who?
So anyway, John Phillips is dead.
You don't know Mary Olanza and it's your pizza?
No, good.
Because you're not old.
So anyway, this death thing is going around real bad boys and girls.
But here's something that died.
This is the worst possible news.
What a way to start my week.
Devastating.
Devastating.
Am I ever going to recover from this news?
No.
Never.
As long as I live.
This is like, didn't I say last week that there was this cathartic thing going on?
Then we come in this morning and we see that all the locks on every door up here on the turd floor.
The arodders have been, that was what I wanted.
That's what I wanted.
Have they changed?
The locks are missing.
And then the locksmith comes through here and he's putting new locks on the doors and George has to Bob Vermuth.
He doesn't answer.
He doesn't answer.
He's just to Bob Vermuth.
What's the story with locks?
Is somebody get canned?
No.
There's so many master keys in the course that we're just getting around with.
Now, everybody moving up on the third floor.
And, of course, this company being behind all the time, which I thought was refreshing but, of honesty,
coming from a jackass like him who's always you know senties corporate you
know all corporate share corporate that bob remote this year
so that you were smoking when you came in this morning I wasn't smoking it
unfortunately all of he wants to come back in I'd be glad I have another one of
my a garcia vagabond these little ones these are pretty good they are yeah my
favorite cheap cigar sometimes a little one can be pretty good
anyway let me do the break first then I'm going to get into some very which
I'm sure won't have a lot of impact on most of you out there but for some of
you it will be news that may destroy your week and like I started to say last
week I told you we were going through this cathodic period with a stock market
with everything and it's like flushing the toilet it would be good the
end result will be good oh there's a letter of the editor and one of the
papers this morning I don't know what kind of what kind of I think some brought
up in bokeh about the new water saver toilets and about who the hell ever came
up with that idea and you have to flush them three times and scrub the bowl I
don't know what the kind of crap you're doing I don't have to flush three times
and they always scrub my bowl would you ever scrub a toilet bowl now it
ends today my must occasionally scrub the bowl what do you mean would I ever you
scrub toilet bowls not since I've been married well that's what I'm saying at
this advanced age of our lives are we about to scrape toilet bowl I don't think so
lady in the bokeh wherever the hell you were god her family must be really full of
but you know yeah I thought that was kind of a touching thing to start this
morning with Monday Monday by the mom is in the poppers now that John Phillips is
dead at the age of 65 most type of post and mama cast died choking on a god
dimmer Ruben sandwich she was choking on Ruben she was choking on it she was
humongous she was gigantic Jim and Tandy Faye Baker were about to sell vacancies
and the Mama cast Elliott apartment complex
down in blue black and blue
Chained
that's really cool man hey that ground up clover
I'm not proof confy I don't think
is that appreciate what I read a lot but Japan undo
two men. Why are you kidding? And that's another one. I don't know the other one. I don't know the one two.
Hey, I think you're right, man. The place is probably...
Oh, you're staring at Goli.
I'm crazy. I'm so pathetic.
10, 13, at 5.60. That was one of the only highlights I actually decided to get in the hell out of there
that Panther released game on Saturday. And yes, I did leave after Pawel's growl just third-gold.
And you people don't deserve him. Let me say it again, but I'm not going to go into that.
Because nobody wants you about that stuff. The highlight was they had the bagpipe guys.
It was St. Patty's Day Saturday, so like outside the Macarena and like even inside,
they had the bagpipe guy, oh, Danny Boyd, they were blowing it.
And I really got a kick out of one and one guy says, oh, that's my chander. That was cute.
Yeah. And there was somebody in the stands was running his hand up and down real fast, but anyway.
They took it off the big screen real quick. That was the highlight when they were playing the bagpipe.
A lot of people said to me, oh, yeah, they were there. I'll say the same thing.
Can we play it again? And I said, no, no.
He's dry. Yeah, John Phillips is dead. Yeah, they were playing bagpipes at the Macarena.
They were blowing it. It was like the package, you know it.
But I had to get out of there with disgustingly disgustingly disgusting display.
Here's the bad news. I'm trying to, well, let's take this one call here. Hello.
Yeah, hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay.
Did you see the Saturday Hill? There was a very fine complimentary mention of you
and how it's turned unfortunately in the same sentence in the art section on Saturday.
No, I didn't see that. Well, let me tell you what it was on page 46.
How did I miss that? Well, let me tell you what it was.
It was a syndicated article from Newsday, no less.
And it talked about the lack of young people coming into the talk show in the radio.
And near the end, it says, where will the next meal rages and how it's turned come from?
How do you like that? Yeah, you have to pick a Saturday, you've got page 46 of the art.
I'm going to dig in the garbage and get that thing out.
You better talk Greg to get you one from the back issues.
Thank you very much. God bless America. I pray for me.
How do you like that? Newsday, they love me.
And I actually sneak this way in the herel. They probably slip by the proofreaders, don't you think?
Yeah. How do you like that?
Anyway, here's the bad news. I can't put it off forever.
Thank you, I guess, thanks to Mike in Miami for factoring this.
You know, I mean, I can't be an emotional cripple forever.
I have to accept this new sooner or later. Bad news.
Don and Bob's grill closes.
Oh, we have taps.
I know it's on a car pack. There's some weird way in that we don't have them there.
Bank to build on Brighton site where diners are fewer than before.
Mike in Miami fact me this morning, he says he was born and raised on White Hotts in Pittsburgh.
Not Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, which is a suburb of Rochester.
Now, wait till you hear this story.
Brighton, New York. Now, this is right next to the elementary school. Brighton number, Brighton number, R1.
And Brighton High School, which I did not go to school there, but nevertheless went to elementary school.
Right next door to Don and Bob's, as many of you know, because I keep talking about it.
How do I know? Did John Phillips die?
He died.
But Don and Bob's has died also.
The food was yellow key.
Yeah, you might say that.
If it was food served fast, not fast food, it says.
That's what Don and the Williams of Cannon Digwell remember about Don and Bob's restaurant at 2075.
Monroe Avenue in Rochester, New York.
And it was good quality. She said yesterday she polished off a cheeseburger and french fries for lunch.
This has been an institution. That's right. This wasn't a restaurant, boys and girls.
This was an institution.
And I want to tell each and every one of you right now, if you don't know Don and Bob's, if you know what I'm talking about, you don't know squat.
You don't know crap.
And of course, it's too late now because they died.
The Williams and her husband Donald makes sure to get one last cheeseburger done and Bob's when they heard the restaurant would be closing its doors for good tonight, meaning Saturday.
March 17th.
It's too bad. I remember coming here in the 60s after we played Catholic Youth Organization basketball Donald said for nearly 50 years done and Bob's was more than just a place to eat.
Customers waited wide eyed as orders were shouted to cooks from the counter.
Regular is brought out of town company that are sample a white hot dog with sauce. That's white hot. You glam that wrote this.
And students that neighboring bright and high school off and ate their lunches there.
Makes me nostalgic.
Makes me want to be one of those people like so many of you live in the past, like my mother living in the past.
The restaurant owner say poor business and me.
And of course, the reason I had poor businesses is because the guy that brought it screwed it up. I just want to mention that real fast.
They say poor business in recent years is the reason for closing on when the officials from Cannon Degro National Bank and Trust Planned to attend the Brighton Planning Board meeting to show plans for a bank branch to be built at the restaurant site.
Don't you think there's something still a bit symbolic about that?
Did I went to school there? Went to high school and grew up so to speak in Cannon Degro.
And now Cannon Degro National Bank is going to be putting a bank branch on the very grounds where Don and Bob's used to be. How do you like that?
Bank President George Hamlin IV. Not George Hamlin IV. But George Hamlin IV said talks about opening a branch.
There started last summer when he was contacted by Don and Bob's principal owner, Dick Fox, who also owns area Wendy's Old Fashioned.
Yeah, Dick Fox is one of the Wendy's people. Remember we've had calls about that.
He came in and bought Don and Bob's and demanded whether they be scrapper.
Don and Bob's employees make take jobs at area Wendy's. So if they choose said Randy Trauger, the spokesman for Fox, Katie Sawyer, 19 of Pittsburgh, was working at Don and Bob's as a cashier for four years as angry.
That storm manager didn't give most employees notice that they're closing before yesterday. How do you like that? Nobody came up to let us know she said.
They just came and closed the guy named Doors. Just like here, changing the locks. You know?
By the way, spread the word WQAims going out of business. Oh, yeah, well, you know, that's got to be next.
Because that stock briefly went up to 16 on Friday. I don't want to mention any names of somebody who sold like a thousand shares right away.
Because I don't want to create any problems for them. Okay. But that stock went up to 16 and some people saw that as an instant selling opportunity. Yeah.
The phones were smoking in this place. I'm not talking about incoming. I'm talking about outgoing calls, outgoing as in the stock brokers.
Playgrounds in a ball field are behind the building. I expected to remain there for public use.
Playground right there where I played as a child right behind Donabobs right next to brighten the number one elementary school.
I wonder if Miss Del Prince is still alive or Miss Madness or Miss what that was her name. I don't know. Mrs. Pierce. Yeah, I actually had a teacher who was Mrs. Pierce in sixth grade was my home home teacher. Mrs. Pierce.
Anybody out there have a teacher Mrs. Oh, no, because most old teachers are old maids. Isn't that right? Which is of course code for bullbikes. I mean, that doesn't make him bad. People are in my great teachers. There ain't nothing like a bullbike.
Barth, what I've always said. Yeah, bar. Anywhere it's not see. We realized everybody had a story to tell about Donabobs Hamlin.
He said he was going there as a teenager after visiting his orthodontist. We went there for something soft I could eat. He said.
Kind of like South Florida. Yeah, something they could gum because he just to come from the orthodontist.
The first Donabobs was opened in sea breeze in 1945 by Don Barbato and his brother-in-law Bob Burrell. The Monday Ravino location followed in 1953 and on it goes with the whole history of Donabobs.
Maybe I can get the science of one of the big fans who stopped by. A Robert Barbato was sold to the rest of 1973. Pants to visit before closes too late now. Maybe we can start a Donabobs down here. What you say?
Huh? We need a Donabobs here desperately. There is no place here. I mean, you know, our friend Wayne Arles got the Rochester Whitehunts. But there is no place quite like it.
Anybody in this audience moved by this story about Donabobs? Anybody know what now? I'm talking about no. Is there any response to this unbelievable story? No. Just because it's reigning cats and dogs and my god damn satellite is out. Which is good. I hope it rains cats and dogs all week. I'll date because number one we need it. Got some good rain this weekend. That was a good start but today it's like the end of the world and we needed badly. And you know why it's raining? Because God has pissed off about the closing of Donabobs.
There are millions of tears coming from heaven about the closing of Donabobs. Look at this. Look at the phone.
Nariya response. Nariya teary shed in this heartless cool, grotesque, unbelievably hard ass town. Shame on you people. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Nariya. Yes sir. He just run my day. My only wife got to the mountains every year of the year around that. And she grew up in Rochester. And she's been telling me for years we got to go to Donabobs and have a burger because the best burger is anywhere.
We're going to plan a trip to the year. We're going to go back to Rochester and go down to have a burger at Donabobs. I guess we're not going to do it.
Nariya have no reason to go there unless you end up sniffing lilacs. She's a post office employee. I don't know if I should tell her. I don't want to go there.
No. I'll take it. Break it to a gently pal. All right. Well, that's all I have to say.
OK. I apologize. Thank you so much. See, there's one guy that cares. He's not even going to get to go there now because Donabobs is dead. I understand most of you are not from Rochester. Most of you have never been to Rochester.
Which, you know, that in itself is no big deal. There's not much there. It's OK. A lot of sports is in there now. Oh, it's become that. Yeah, they destroyed a lot of neighborhoods in that city too. You'll be pleased to know.
Our poll on Saturday hour over the weekend at least got a tremendous response. A tumultuous sixteen hundred and forty three votes around it as I speak now. That's one of our highest ever.
I have some non-alion polls. I mean the alien polls. They had like twenty trillion votes, but that was a different story. That was something important. Wasn't it? No. No.
Which group of people destroyed neighborhood the fastest was our poll question on Friday. Over the weekend. You pondered that and you mulled it over.
You talked it over with your friends. You took surveys among your peer group and they said. African Americans eight hundred ten forty nine point two percent said.
African Americans destroyed neighborhood faster than anybody on the face of the year. Basically.
Rednecks or white trash or trailer trash whatever code words you like to use. 223 they came in a distance second thirteen and a half percent. Haitians followed with a hundred and forty two eight point six percent.
Cubans with a hundred and thirty two and of course George wants to make sure you understand we're only talking about toothless dark skin.
Cubans eight percent orthodox Jews well that's what you said you didn't say the toothless but I put that into to protect you.
Orthodox Jews a hundred six percent.
Puerto Rican seventy five I guess they didn't see that piece on the central park.
That was on again yesterday on MSNBC and if it's on MSNBC you know must be the MS.
Puerto Rican seventy five four and a half percent to make in sixty three months you point eight percent.
Yes.
Yes. Thirty nine two point three percent Mexican thirty eight two point three percent. Nicaragua is twenty two one point three percent.
Now before you get to excited about Nicaraguan's wonderful people they are and how great they are to send your house to them.
They say if they're neighborhood you know I'm thinking of myself probably the reason Nicaraguan did so well is because do I know any Nicaraguan?
No.
Do you know any Nicaraguan?
No.
Oh Georgia's shaking his head feverishly no.
The girl does he's the only one.
Miguel is the one remember his roommate.
Oh he's got a Nicaraguan roommate from Formosa.
Yeah.
He's always going to stay and hang down your head.
But anyway Tom Dooley.
So I guess that's the reason most of us can't really pass a reasonable opinion about Nicaraguan because most people don't live or maybe it happens to be that they're wonderful neighborhoods and they're very have great ethics and standing.
And they keep the place clean and they don't stink up the joint and don't throw all their garbage out on the guy damn sidewalks and don't destroy the property values in the hood etc.
Maybe that's possible.
So let's give benefit of that out to our Nicaraguan friend.
Some of them have a bad complexion as we know.
Twenty two only one point three percent.
Yeah.
Some of them maybe kind of a distant kind of Wayne.
Oh I'm speaking of St. Rosenberg.
He died?
No but politically.
See I got to mention his name here be day because he's obviously out there squeezing his bag right now.
And I don't know what St. Patty's there's got nothing else to do that grizzled old fart.
You're dead sonny.
You're as good as dead.
You're finito.
You're done baby.
They said get out and hear you silly old person you.
Go away.
Take your goddamn outhouse gang with you.
So done but I know it doesn't mean anything to anybody else out there.
That's okay.
So I'm right I'll just suffer alone.
I'm used to it.
I can handle it.
I'm not an emotional cripple like many of you.
I want a banging on the butt honey.
I smell like a woman.
I smell like a woman.
And I got to shave.
In the man's section over at the mall.
I saw the temple some new men's fragrance.
I saw a freedomist with so many new things.
Now I'm left with the aroma of a freaking fruit.
I want to see you.
I got to walk on.
You're so very gay gay gay.
1032 who know who that was that that came in the near the window.
Oh, is the orange from Arty remember I told you smell like a French warehouse.
I don't know why guys do that.
Well, maybe a variety of reasons.
1032 at 560 WQ we got the mad dog Jim Maddog.
We're hanging today at you.
There's a hang still out there in Vegas.
Plunge in his brain job.
Booster at 6 o'clock tonight with the anti-hank show and Eddie K.
at 10 o'clock tonight.
There's a lady in Margate.
Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
We used to go to Don and Bath.
If you want good food at a reasonable price it was great.
And it was just a fun place to go.
Yeah, it was third of homey in there.
I like it.
Just the whole way that you could see the whole grill and the thing was wide open there.
And you know, you could see them flopping the burgers around and just doing everything was there's never been a place like it anywhere.
I know.
So I'll mess it.
Okay, sweetheart.
We can mourn together.
I feel your pain.
Thanks, Neil.
Thanks.
How do you like that?
Here's the lady.
She's feeling it.
And that's it.
That's the end of our response here this morning to that.
Well, what am I going to tell you?
Not everybody, me, all the people from New York or from Chicago or Boston or Detroit.
They don't know from Don and Bob's, which is very sad for them.
Yeah, I feel sorry for them.
And I feel sorry for me because I'll never be able to go back.
Although, wait, and I see what's going to happen now.
Of course, the, the, the Wayne doesn't get them from Don and Bob's.
He gets them from his wiggles from the manufacturer.
So we'll stay on, still have our walk.
And then of course there's those pain in the ass people in Papano with that ratchet or white hot, you know.
Which I don't dare mention their name on here again because they're always snoring around for free plugs.
That's okay. They're very nice people.
And I guess they're from Rochester.
So how bad can they be, huh?
See if they were smart.
They would like to turn it into a full like Don and Bob's down here.
And make those same burgers on the grill like they made up there.
And oh, boy.
But it'll never happen.
You know, you can't go back, baby.
You just can't go back.
All those grizzly little farts.
Let's talk about those wonderful restaurants like the Princess spaghetti house in Boston.
Is it there anymore?
No.
Topink isn't Detroit.
Is that any, is there anymore?
No.
And then chop out.
Oh, gone.
All the good stuff is gone, baby.
Just like down here.
Famous.
I'll start that again.
Here's our pool today.
Now that John Phillips is dead.
Which public figure's death affected you the most?
Not a great pool.
Since we're talking about Don and Bob's dying and John Phillips dying.
And you know, yeah.
You die?
All the things.
Yeah, he died.
Anyway, which public figure's death affected you the most?
Now I have a short list here.
Maybe you want to add some to it because, you know, what do I know?
JFK.
Bobby Kennedy.
I could put our FK, but they might not know who that.
JFK Bobby Kennedy.
Martin Luther Cookehne.
John Lennon.
Elvis.
Or Princess Diana.
And he's going to get back to you at Diana.
Anybody else I left off there?
I'm not putting John Phillips on her because if John Phillips is a death affecting you that much,
then we'll get you some serious help, okay?
We'll get you a sandwich with Mama Kance.
Can I leave anybody else off that list?
You don't seem to be too, uh, well, I mean, full of names.
I could name some things that some other people might have been affected by.
Yeah, I'm not asking you personally because we know you're such a hard-hearted spick anyway that I mean, you know,
why should put the Glen Hill on there?
That's a good point.
How about the bird?
No way. I said, which public figure was he like a public figure?
Wasn't he?
No, I'm not.
I think so.
Yeah, but hey, we'll be following him doing it.
See, there you go again.
Just because I played those damn Zeta tapes.
Oh, and you know what I got?
Something has been missing in South Florida radio.
If you like contemporary music, say from the 70s and 80s, Phil Collins, Chicago, Lionel Richie, Steve Winnwood, Billy Joel,
you'd either had to suffer through tons of duop oldies.
A lot of jazz you'd never heard of, or worse yet, that's why it'd be...
The music of very man-a-low and barbist rice and...
Well, it's 7 p.m. and that's all done to Jay and the G-Tri now.
Welcome to South Florida's all-new, coast, 97th-3 a.m.
I remember that the best of the 70s, 80s, and today with West Talk.
From the building, I remember the jocks playing that for me.
Really?
The GTR jock thing, this is what it's going to be.
And we were all puking and crying.
So there it was.
Okay, which public figures death?
We'll get some other names on here before we put the list on there, Eric, because obviously this is a very incomplete list.
And other people out there who have much more compassion and pathos and ethos in dark to the end than we have here,
will have some other names for us.
I'm sure, maybe.
Here's Miami.
Oh, ha, ha.
Ah, ha, ha, like I said.
Okay, well that's all we're getting here today, huh? Is that?
That was it.
5667-0560.
I think maybe I'll just play a Monday, Monday, and California Dream and Over and Over again for all four hours.
It sounds like a real good idea.
Since this audience is once again dead as a door nail.
I'm sitting here waiting on you, okay?
Which public figures death affected you the most? There's some names on here.
Does anything affect any of you out there?
No.
Is there anybody with a poem?
No.
Anybody with a breath?
No.
Good. Got all my-
Yeah, you learned hard.
How could you forget?
Yeah, I'll get out of here.
How could you-
Should I put him on there?
Absolutely.
Stay all frickin' urn hard?
Oh, get out of town.
W-Q-I-M.
Buddy Holly and Roberto Clemente.
No.
Buddy Holly, I mean Roberto Clemente.
Come on.
Come on.
What we don't want sports people?
Sports people dying?
How about Mickey Mendel, huh?
Who also needs a liver?
Now we're not putting all bunch of sports people.
How about Baby Ruth?
How about Lou Gehrig?
How about Ty Cobb?
How about Joe DiMaggio?
Where have you gone?
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
He died?
Oh.
Come on.
Let's get-
Let's get serious.
Roberto Clemente's death affected you the most of any public figure in the history of your life.
Come on, sir.
Man, what are they closed on and done in Bob's?
It was people like you that forced them to close.
People with bad taste.
With no taste.
Mobile in Boca.
Hey, what's up, Neil?
Yes, sir.
Definitely John Wayne.
Without a doubt.
He's already on my list.
Yeah, I'll catch.
I just want to put it in for it.
Okay, we got you down.
Okay, I don't be calling in the vote now.
This is on neo-rogyes.com.
This is on the internet.
I'm not going to do four hours of people saying,
Oh, definitely, John Wayne.
Definitely Elvis.
Definitely JFK.
It's on the list already.
I'm looking for some ass.
Instance here.
For crying out loud.
Boy, oh boy, good thing I'm going on vacation real soon.
You're excited to that.
I'm getting real, real ordinary with this crowd.
Real disgusted and just fed up to my eyebrows.
The day after John Phillips croaks.
The guy.
And this audience is like,
maybe they're in mourning for Don Above.
That might be it.
Maybe they're getting a minion together.
Huh?
A filet minion.
Come on in and lay down on my couch.
You hear this, that's where else?
Well, now, there's crack whales.
The new cookie with crack.
Yeah, that's right.
That crazy cookie on the bench wants the best flavor of crack.
No crack whales.
And they're double height.
And they're sure to make you higher than a mobile phone kind.
And I'll make you lose a lot of weight.
And people won't know you eat in crack whales
when they see that skinny ass muddy of yours.
Come on, Mr. Crack whale.
Cooking man, get in my mother's bowl.
Cooking.
I paid for them in son of a bitch.
New crack whales.
Now, so, on sweet corners, everywhere.
1044-560 WTQ-A-M.
So, anyway, somebody faxed a great idea
which we're going to add to our list.
John Wayne.
He died.
Yeah, a few days ago.
Well, a few, a long time ago.
Marion, John Wayne.
Don't call him Marion, unless you want a fistful of lid.
So, that's not a bad list.
So, far JFK, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King.
Want to put co-bay on there?
There were a lot of people who were not gnashing with that hat.
No.
Hey, I got news for you.
How about Eric Clapton's kid that's the lot of the window?
Let's get to the audience.
Let's get to the audience.
Kurt Cobain.
He wasn't a huge figure.
He was not a shape.
Elvis?
Come on, John Lennon, Elvis, Princess Diana,
Dale Earnhardt, John Wayne.
That's not a bad start for a list.
That's an excellent group there.
Of course, the Elvis thing.
I'm afraid that's going to get a lot of votes
and that's going to piss me off greatly.
I mean, what was the big deal there, okay?
We have that many fat, lifeless chicks in the audience.
What do you mean chicks?
How about all these guys that call all of them?
Oh, no, we went up to Graceland.
And I always try to let them off the hook by saying,
oh, yeah, must have been your wife or girlfriend's idea.
Oh, no, it was great.
We're going to go back this year.
This summer, we're going back to Graceland with Paul Simon.
See, Paul Simon, he's smart.
He just sings about it.
He don't go there.
He just makes money, you know, singing songs about it.
Somebody called him suggested two packs of Chakor.
Should we put him on there with Biggie?
No shickers on the list.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello, now.
Yes, sir.
Yes, speaking of dead bangs.
Sorry, I almost killed the show.
I was wanting to head to singing of the bad news.
About Donald Bob?
Yeah.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
So I just wanted to call him.
And since the show is done, I thought he'd call it.
Tell him to tell the call and say, apologize for sending that bad news.
No, no, no, no, no, listen.
You have to break it to me.
I mean, you know, it's not good news, but we all have to know.
Yeah.
In addition to what this guy started killing the fact when he bought it anyway.
I don't know if you ever went there after this guy bought it out.
Not since about the mid-80s.
Yeah, well, this guy butchered it.
I was there, I guess, also the last time about 15 years ago.
And it was still OK, but nothing like the original end.
You know, whoever wrote this article really missed out the good stuff, the frozen custard.
Uh-huh.
They were famous for the frozen custard.
A lot of people don't even know what that is.
I know, but you could also get an Abbott's in Pittsburgh in a few other places.
But Donald Bob's, the chocolate almond fudge frozen custard was maybe some of the best stuff I ever put in my mouth.
Abbott's in Charlotte too.
Right.
Yeah.
Okay, thanks for the bad news, my friend.
Okay, sorry.
No problem.
Not your fault.
Don't take it personal unless you want to.
Donald Bob's is dead.
Oh, brother.
What a way to start a week, huh?
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
And you know, how you doing it?
Okay, sir.
Second generation.
Listener.
Multiple color.
I just wanted to, I don't know if there's a lot of dead heads in South Florida, but.
Oh, you're not going to say during Garcia, are you?
Oh, come on.
Okay.
I'm sure they got told for like a hundred years.
I mean, you know, now they're not torn.
You've touched a lot of people's lives.
Not mine specifically.
I want to have a couple of concerts, but I know a lot of people.
Yeah, you're right.
He'll get some votes.
I would hope so.
Hey, on another note, I had a chance to go to Wayne Arles.
I guess it was Tuesday or Wednesday.
And it's maybe it was Thursday anyway.
It's the day you were talking about the Schwarzen.
And how they were not used specifically, but the voting, how it affected, you know, certain communities.
And all you should have seen some of the faces in there, Neil, it was unbelievable.
Like the lady that was doing the cooking there, she's like, you know, trying to keep her eye on what she's doing.
She kept looking up at the speaker walking.
Hey, you're taking these.
I love you, man.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
Oh, look at this.
Look at Broughtsey.
Yeah, how about that?
It was painful.
Well, this fact, we want to take a stab at it, you know.
Look at Broughtsey.
What do you say?
No.
Someone suggested Bruce Lee.
Bruce Lee.
How about, how about Picky Lee?
Here's one I know you like.
How about Brenda Lee, although she's still alive.
John Candy.
No.
Phil Hartman.
No.
He was still working.
No.
Okay.
Phil Hartman's death affected.
Why?
I mean, he was funny.
More, more significant than John Wayne.
He was done making movies.
Oh, get out of here.
John Wayne, I mean, as much as I had done.
That's not the point.
The point is he was done by your standards.
But a lot of people grew up through upward John Wayne.
And then he wasn't going to be making any more movies.
And then?
Did John?
Yeah.
But Phil Hartman, they had to replace him.
He was in a ride on.
They were like to say, John Wayne, Phil Hartman wasn't an American like one of those legendary people.
No.
He could have been.
I mean, I looked, why don't you put the name of everybody who ever died?
That'll kill four hours.
We'll be working on this for the next 20 years.
Everybody who just died will put their, you know, people's relatives.
They'll put them all on there, you know.
Monashia Skolnick, how about him?
He's dead.
Hans Connryd.
Who?
How about all the games you'll host there for Bokobrine Allen?
The one he died?
You have a poll just for that one.
But Convey, he's dead.
Jack Barry, he's dead.
Bill Cullen.
I love Bill Cullen when I vote for him.
No.
No.
He's a lot of death didn't affect me.
I didn't even know he was dead.
You know?
Where's that Lancitor thing?
Isn't he the one that says that?
Yeah.
How about Bill Cullen?
I didn't know he was dead.
Yeah.
5-670560, Palm 560.
See the death of John Phillips.
And then, of course, Dale Hurnard, just a couple of weeks ago.
Which I'm going to have a tough time.
I may have to vote for Dale Hurnard.
No.
How about Terry Sawchuck?
How about Tim Horton?
Here's Key West.
Hello.
I guess so, but Clint.
J.F.K. Junior.
Oh, that's right.
J.F.K. Junior.
Thank you so much.
Yeah.
Should we put him on there?
Yeah, the lawyer was a big tennis, wasn't there?
J.F.K. Junior.
Yeah, they were having a thing.
They're peddling these coins.
You know, if you see those things on TV, where they're peddling the J.F.K. Junior,
silver, dollar, whatever the hell it is.
Haven't seen that?
No.
What do you have to do with that?
Stick it in the slot.
Stick it in the picking bank in a slot.
Stick it out of the way.
Yeah, like a Renee's slot.
And then we can get the paramedics to yank it out while they're getting whatever else out.
They've got stuck in her mouth.
But anyway, so Roy and the thing comes on.
Well, he was America's, I'm trying to think of the line they used in that.
Oh, wait, look.
John Phillips, who's 65 years old.
And Nick Dermott, CNN, lost Andrew.
Thank you, Wayne.
Oh, God.
All day, let's come on.
Let's shut up here at Tuesday for John Phillips and Mama Cash.
Let's have a Friskami sandwich.
What do you say?
Come on.
Let's all get a liver transplant while we're at it, too.
Have food.
I'm going to have a baby.
Turn it in, lady.
Wonder why the Mama's in the pop of music.
We've got bad news for her.
If you're like hibernating right out of town over the weekend or not watching the depressing news,
John Phillips is dead.
A lot of these people wouldn't know John Phillips from Phillips, Suza, from Malcolm Phillips,
or Marvin Maker.
Or I'll start doing that again, okay?
Don't start kids.
A lot of people agree when you start with those guy named Harness names again.
Franklin Sears.
Now, come on.
Don't do it.
Richie Niles.
Here's a mobile and lake worth, ho.
Michelle Braindrig.
Mobile and lake worth.
Hey, how about John Holmes?
Yeah.
That was a big death.
You'd like him.
You'd fag.
Okay, thanks.
No, I didn't.
I don't look ugly, guys, with bigger shlongs.
Asshole.
567-0560.
Pound 560 on the 18.
You know who that was?
That was a Dale Earnhardt guy right there.
Guaranteed.
Oh, yeah.
You could smell it.
Here's a mobile and point and beach.
Hello.
Hey, Niles.
That's a great show.
I got two for you.
Uh-huh.
Frank Sinatra.
I have mommy up.
Mama Jackie on the axis.
Jackie O.
Jackie.
Hey!
I can't forget, huh?
Yeah.
That's, that's true.
I guess we're going to have to put Jackie O on the list.
A lot of women will probably up.
And Frankie.
Frankie, okay.
You got it, man.
I'll buy.
Okay.
Yeah.
We got to put him on there, right?
Frank Sinatra.
Don't give me that.
And Jackie O.
What?
That mommy grabbing point out.
What?
How was she affecting anybody's lines while she was aligned?
She was just running around.
Yeah.
Effecting her a subtle, oh, not that.
Having said that, that was funny.
Oh, I mean, speaking of JFK, Jr.
I've been reading, you know, after that plane crash.
And after he died.
Of course, while it was alive, God forbid anybody should suggest it.
But they were talking about the fact that she and Aristotle
on assets were, like, maybe screwing around while she was still married to JFK.
Because I got to believe that there was, he doesn't,
he never looked like a Kennedy.
Jr.
Diddy?
He looks Greek.
And I'm not just saying that to be a smart ass, but he looks Greek.
There looked.
Yeah.
What kind of guy was that?
Huh?
Wasn't Jackie kind of, I thought she was into Greek or not.
No, you're not listening.
He didn't look like any member of the Kennedy family.
That's a good point.
He looked very Greek.
I think he was the son of Aristotle.
Aristotle.
Oh!
passes.
I'm just, that's just my personal feeling.
Nothing makes any difference.
In addition to which he didn't have any of the, I mean, he was a dullard.
All of the crap, they built him up for all the stuff.
He had a personality like a dead man, like a frog.
Here's a mobile in Bokeh, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi, it is 140.
Ronald Reagan.
Brain dead?
He's not dead yet.
Well, he fits it perfectly.
Okay.
He died.
Well, from the neck up.
Now, we're talking about completely, okay?
Well, we'll keep that, we'll put that like in the in waiting, like bubbling under.
We'll do like on a hot, a hundred in billboard magazine.
We'll have a bubbling under list.
Those who are right on the verge.
Those who aren't quite dead yet, but like just any second could be the last gasp.
This is a pretty impressive list so far.
We'll get it all just relaxed there.
It just grew up.
He already put this thing on here.
He's getting it put together.
Well, he'll add to it.
Which public figures death affected you the most?
I mean, to call and start, see, this is what these people do.
It's like when we did the thing for the best song of all time, you know?
And they start mentioning, oh well, that was a pretty good song.
Yeah, a lot of songs were a pretty good song, but not all those pretty good songs could have possibly been your favorite song.
I know it's hard.
It is very hard.
And you know, the choice too.
To pick only one.
It's like saying, what was your favorite meal of all time?
Well, I mean, how can you do that, you know?
I would say lunch had done in Bob's circa 1960 something.
And they didn't call the birders hamburger.
They called them ground rounds.
Yeah, ground rounds and white hots.
And the red hots were called Texas hots.
Why is that?
I have no idea.
Maybe one of our hot dog culinary experts out there will call him straightness out.
Somebody who really knows his weenies.
That is an important stuff.
JFK, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, John Lennon, Elvis, Princess Diana, Dale Earnhardt, John Wayne, Jerry Garcia.
JFK, Jr. Frank Sinatra, or Jackie.
Oh!
That's pretty good stuff to a good list.
And Phil Hartman.
No.
Wait, but he'll get more votes than half those people that are on there.
Okay, just a humor.
Okay, no.
No, see, I'm not going to set myself up for that.
Because the fact that you said that means that all those little nerds out there don't vote for Phil Hartman just to approve your point.
Just because you didn't want your need of stuff that he was involved with.
No, that's absolutely wrong.
I love Phil Hartman.
I was a big Phil Hartman fan.
He was plucked away at the pinnacle of his career.
But that affected you the most.
I could go down that with more than Elvis.
Okay, I'm going to put it on there.
It's on there.
Phil Hartman.
He died.
She blew his brains out.
Who knows what kind of funny stuff he could have come up with, you know, if he were still around.
Well, how about Steve Allen?
If you're going to start picking comedians, Steve Allen.
Yeah, I'm going to start picking.
There's a lot of parties in there.
No, no, I'm not going to see, but you're looking at it from a different angle.
Exactly.
It affected me the other direction, the other way.
But you didn't grow up watching Steve Allen on TV.
You didn't know Steve Allen before became seen Alan Olden ridiculous.
He was nothing to me, except he was certainly when it comes to comedy and television.
Old men heads and shoulders above Phil Hartman and believe me, I'm not putting down Phil Hartman.
It was great.
But here you put him in the same category with the Steve Allen.
Yeah, above.
How about Jack Benny?
Oh, no.
How about Jimmy Duranty?
How about Eddie Cantor?
Who?
1056 at 560.
There was a lot of dead people, okay?
Excuse us.
We're trying to make sure we don't leave anybody out.
Oh, God, Neon.
1103 at 560.
W.D. Cue him in a morbid Monday.
Boy, you don't want to start off with we talking about dead people?
Oh, you know.
Here's what a fact that says you're missing a big one.
James Dean.
What do you think about that?
I think James Dean belongs on LSD made three movies for crying out loud.
How about Richard Burton?
Doesn't he, dead?
Yeah, he's dead.
Oh, wait.
James Dean doesn't belong.
He made three movies.
He made the giant.
Right.
Rubble about a cause.
And what was the other one?
Come on.
He made three movies.
And then he got killed in that crime.
Plus the fact that he was, I don't want to say it.
Real tight would sell many.
There he goes.
Sell many.
Let's put him on the list.
So you're going to put James Dean on there.
Put some many on there.
It's all hype.
We're not talking about hype of people like that.
He made it a bit as big if he hadn't had died.
James Dean.
Of course, absolutely.
That's right.
That is absolutely correct.
People who became bigger in, more popular after they died.
That would be another great conversation for some other day.
But seriously, there's a lot of them.
Great example.
James Dean.
A legend in somebody's mind.
Never took a shower.
Never bathed.
They said he used to smell like a toilet, like a sewer.
He looked at it.
Like picky work.
I think they sell many of them.
Probably smell worse.
Here's the model in the Gables.
Hello.
I just wanted to say, if anybody's mentioned the cold brown,
how about Ron Goldman?
There you go.
You can put them on the same line.
We'll put them on the same line.
Okay.
Thank you.
How about Ron Goldman?
He died.
5.67.056.050.
Pound 568.
Died a horrible death at the hands of that butchering murderer who lives right down here in our neck of the woods.
I don't want to mention Oze by name.
Who killed those two people and still got about your assholes out there defending him and clamorizing.
Oh, you go, Oze.
Just like what's his name?
Just like Puffy.
See that similarity there, John?
Do you want to think about Johnny's cocking, man?
Big celebrity, big dark celebrity especially.
If you got the big bucks, no matter what the hell you did.
You got the magic touch.
He's got, he can touch it.
That's right.
And even if it does fit, he's still full of Schmidt.
That's what I say.
But Puffy says it wasn't Johnny.
It was Jesus.
What got him off?
Oh, Jesus got him off.
Because he's old all the time.
Like those guys coating him guns and trying to bribe the limo drivers.
That's right.
So Puffy walks away, Scott, for either of them.
That right.
You go, Puffy.
You go, boy.
Then it again.
Yeah, two pack.
Let's put him on there.
What do you say?
No.
How about six pack?
We'll put him on the same line with Biggie.
Here's a mobile and coconut crere.
Hello.
Hi, yes, I have a name for you, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I have Victor Borgah.
Victor Borgah.
His death affected you the most, sir.
What is your son?
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm just going to pick up the papers here, both of them.
And I'm going to read the obvictuary page, OK?
I mean, listen to the question, boys and girls.
Which public figures death affected you the most
with significant?
Made you want to sit down and cry?
Made you feel like there was a loss?
I'm not talking about your brethren law,
who left all this money to somebody else or something like that.
I'm talking public figure.
Somebody famous, a celebrity, you know?
One of them.
Victor, freaking Borgah.
How about senior winces?
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I hope that that isn't what you, I think it's going to be.
Bet you it is.
I bet you it's homentage.
Bet you it is.
And I guarantee I'm going to sit here and look at them.
I will not touch one.
But thanks Carlos.
Who are those from?
What?
You brought them?
Yeah, right.
They're hell you did.
And there's a card on it.
What is it?
What is it?
You look, they're not the kind that you like.
Oh, thank you.
So the Danful Enjoyment.
Dan and Andrew, family bakery, Lincoln Park West,
and Cerwise, thank you very much Dan and Andrew.
And they said over a bunch of those little triangle homentage,
which of course are for going.
But I'm sure they're very good and enjoy them.
George and everybody else.
See, I've got a whole new deal now.
I have a new diet, the counselor, who's helping me.
I'm going to lose eight million pounds.
And nobody believes me, but you'll see.
I have no interest in that, even if they were the other ones I wouldn't need them.
I'm through punishing myself with food that other people inflict on me and myself as well.
No, Cerwise, I have a new diet counselor, fairly for you.
Right.
It's his name.
Nanya.
Okay.
I'll tell you off here.
5667-0560, pound 560 on EAT and fee and provides.
Seriously, it's enough is enough already.
What's the point?
How many times has that happened?
The door opened and full wander's in here.
And because I'm weak, because I continue punishing myself and doing all these things,
I sit here and eat it and blame somebody else.
You can't keep doing that.
That's not worth it.
That's one of our favorite things as fat people as we blame other people for being big and fat and big to discuss things.
And I'm through doing it.
And you don't believe me, of course, but you'll see.
I want to believe you.
The Los Angeles Times reported that the conservative Republican state representative Marvin Couch resigned his office today.
He was caught a week ago while getting a $22 blow job at a noon time in the car in Orlando shopping center parking lot.
How much?
22 bucks, pretty cheap.
He was arrested on three must-a-meaner charges in the minute having paid prostitutes in the past.
Couch's married had six children and had earned a perfect voting record from the Christian Coalition of Florida.
He was a member of the legislators prayer meeting group that called itself the God Squad.
He lives in and represented Oveedo after having been caught.
He reportedly said, I've sinned against my God, my wife, my children, and the citizens I represent.
Yeah, religious morals suck, don't they, Marvin?
Most of all, Marvin is sinned against the leaders of the World Sex Guide because he didn't properly report his research findings to us.
A little research on the Internet revealed a good Marvin at a store-probe gun rating from the straw NRA and signed a letter to Disney complaining about their extending of health benefits to a homosexual lit-in partner.
So there you go.
Nice going, Marvin on the couch.
Loan me $22.
The hot metal was shut down and both the Russians had learned northwest at 1.
37th.
Yeah, bad accident.
Yeah, you really do believe I've got you.
Stay off the hot metal.
Yeah, you really have a bad smell.
Running down a steepy.
I'm just gonna stand in my way.
There's never stopped to go.
Now here on MCW, where you come from.
Haven't eaten a thing for too long today.
I tried what right and she can draw for nothing seems to work.
I'm a little bit tired.
I'm a little tired.
I'm a little tired.
Never realized I've got you.
Did you come to Germany with that?
Back off.
Oh man.
Here's the fact that says Liberace and Raak Hudson and the guy from the
affiliates people, Sherry Lewis and Landtops.
Landtops died too.
Oh yeah.
Didn't you know that?
I thought it was just her.
No, Landtops missing because...
But anyway...
How about...
Speaking of other facts, how about since they're showing it a billion times every
chance they get on MSNBC which just repeats the same pinchos over and over again and many
of them are very good.
But MSNBC repeats the same three shows over and over again.
You know what's one...
What is it called?
It's called headlines and headlines and something.
Yeah.
Headlines and celebrities, whatever.
The thing about the Brady bunch, they must have shown that piece 4,000 times.
And I didn't even like that show.
I didn't even watch the goddamn Brady bunch.
But Robert Reed, what about Robert Reed?
American Hensonson, American HedgeDead.
You're putting in a frog.
Jim Henson and the category with Robert Reed from the Brady Frickin bunch.
We go way further back than Robert Reed.
Everybody grew up on the Muppets and Sesame Street.
Everybody threw up on the Muppets.
Maybe that's why they looked like that.
Here's Alan who says I agree with George which he collected his spelling and actually
spelled it right.
Phil Hartman was one of the most talented actors of the 80s, 90s, perhaps longer.
If you don't want Giza's calling into your show, why do you insist on keeping them on
your list?
No hard feelings just trying to win them for the youth team.
Love the show, Alan.
Well, first of all, I did put Phil Hartman on list tonight.
Yes.
And number two, I mean, Giza's, Frank Sinatra is only for Giza.
And I don't like him.
Don't get me wrong.
I wouldn't vote for him.
I couldn't sing as well as a paper sack.
But we're talking about people who died like, let's say, in the last 45th of the years.
Right?
Okay.
You don't have to be a Giza, like Frank Sinatra.
That bad taste.
And how about Elvis?
How about Elvis?
It helps.
No, but how about Elvis?
What anybody's gonna be?
I'm catering to Giza's by putting Elvis on the list.
No, just a...
And how about John Lennon?
The beat of music was 60s, music 60s and 70s.
But John Wayne.
John Wayne died after John Lennon died.
He died after John Kennedy died.
He died after Martin Luther Cooon died.
But his dad died way many years before anybody.
But that's not the point.
How about Robert Reed?
The point is this.
They showed his movies.
You can watch his movies now.
Everybody, you can't find anybody.
If you went on the street corner, I went into shopping mall and said,
can't miss a Mott's Mott's Joe, John Wayne or Fay Wing.
They all know who John Wayne is.
Absolutely.
He was an icon.
There you go.
I know.
I couldn't stand John Wayne.
I mean, he couldn't...
He was a little crap, you know?
And of course, while he represented, he was the Cheltenheston of those days.
But nevertheless, Cheltenheston.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Here's a call from Tallahassee.
Hello?
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
A couple of names.
John Belushi.
Jessica Savage.
Jessica Savage.
No.
Get the whole drug thing, man.
No.
John Belushi, maybe.
I mean, you're going to put a little harbing on there.
How about John Belushi?
Huh?
Well, there you go.
Okay.
John Belushi.
And Bob Lachner's career.
How about that?
That's not a bad idea.
Okay.
Anyway, we're off to the tag list, Dr. Lachner.
Good list.
John Belushi.
Okay.
See, now you started with a fulfillment thing.
They're going to have to put...
How about Gilder Radner?
How about her?
She's dead.
Yeah.
Cragic, sad.
Yeah.
Right.
Funny.
Funnyer than John Belushi.
To me.
To me.
To me.
Different stuff.
It made John Belushi was funny, where it was always the same thing.
She was very funny.
And then I was always the same thing with the one here.
Don't apologize.
Don't apologize.
Don't apologize.
Don't apologize.
There's a guy who is a him now as opposed to where Rosanne was an adana.
Which we have right here in town.
Yeah.
But he wouldn't get a lot of votes.
No, she would not.
To get Gene Wadder's vote.
That's about it.
See, I...
The idea that...
Steve Allen has compared to Phil Hartman.
It's Ludacris.
That's how those old clips...
I guess it's dated.
Must have been funny at the time.
The Steve Allen stuff...
The thing old clips doesn't mean you saw the shows, okay?
That's the best I can do.
That stuff back then was the best television in history.
And speaking of television, you see this thing about Tivo last night on the 60 minutes?
No.
You didn't?
No.
Oh, you really been to that.
And the heads of the networks are just crap in their pants now because Tivo, when I
forget what the other one is called, you know, where you had the little box on the TV set.
Oh, yeah.
It's with the hard drive inside.
And it records all the shows you want whenever you want them to.
Right.
And it can edit out the commercials.
And you can also, if you're watching the show live, you can pause it and go take a phone call for 10 minutes and come back and pick it up wherever you left off and see the rest of it without
rewinding or fast forward Tivo.
And so now the networks are frantically trying to figure out how the hell they're going to sell commercial time.
And most people are once they get those, which they will when they admit that.
They're going to be like dancing to the commercials and I watch it.
Oh, yeah.
Poo-bop-boot.
Tivo.
Let's see John Belushi, Divo, a Divo.
567-0560, 0560 on the AT&D line.
Mobile and Fort Lauderdale, hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
How about Gerald Schultz?
That's a good one.
I think he's affected us more than any.
I think he affected us more than John Belushi.
Definitely more than John Belushi.
Yeah, good one.
Thank you.
You got it.
I agree with him.
Charles Schultz, peanuts.
Huh?
Sure, he was still working.
We're not asking was he still working?
I think that Lenshultz is in the face.
He's still working.
He's working over here.
The question is, Jackie, I was working.
Exactly.
You're making my point.
What?
Your question is, what?
Which public figures death affected you the most?
We have four.
We have people listening now, I would say, from 15 to 80.
If they were not making anything new anymore, their deaths would have a less chance of effect.
How about Henry Ford?
How about Charles Edison?
He wasn't making anything new anymore?
If they were done making whatever it was that they were not paying the whole thing.
Who cares?
He's still holding it.
You don't see what I'm saying.
If their career was already years over, what difference does their death make?
They're young.
They're young.
They were understained.
You're making the whole, and no, you don't.
The essence of the question is how they impacted your life.
Right.
And if they were still working, if they were still paying the product, they'd be priced.
No, I was working.
Gone.
Not if they were still working when they'd died necessarily.
That's not the point.
Charles Schurz wasn't really still working.
He was, like, food-written to an old fat.
How do you like that?
You're not good-written to fat old bad-rovers with bad tacky outfits and things.
Right.
And you have a point.
How about another double-choose, Barbara?
Elvis, come on.
Come on.
People can get monochast, Mary Olanzo, and Elvis to come over for once today.
And we can feed them all those humantations.
Thanks again to our good friends, which are through the cards away by giving them a plug already.
And their intentions were very good.
But I'm just not doing that anymore.
And nobody, not one person in the audience, well, maybe one.
But nobody else believes me.
You'll see, I got the inspiration now, baby.
No more fat for this kid.
What's the point?
Replay TV was that other product.
Replay TV and Tiro.
Those are the two brands.
And they are available now.
I mean, you can go out and get them.
They said they're like between 400 and 800 bucks.
And the only knock-on of the one guy said it takes like six hours to install it, especially if you have like satellite dishes and the whole bit.
But even if you have a satellite dish, it's like 20 or 30 of them like I do, and a cable and all the other.
You can still hook it through there.
And it downloads the schedules.
Downloads all the information from the sky, from the satellites.
And so you can, like, let's say you wanted to watch, or nothing about wrestling shows, you wanted to tape them on your hard drive.
And you could like punch up wrestling by, you know, category.
And it'll show you all the wrestling shows that are around that day, that week, whatever.
And you can tape them for that day or for the whole next month or whatever.
Whatever you want.
Or just pick out the ones you want to tape.
Can't wait.
Because unlike potsking around with the VCR, this is a hard drive.
It is so hard.
Exactly.
And so the commercials, baby, it's going to be just a matter of time before that.
And they're talking about, well, you see, like, on some of the shows, like, whatever, whichever one they picked out.
And in the background, in the hospital, there was like a soda machine, a generic one.
And they said, well, you know, one month it could be a Coke machine or if Pepsi wants to out-bed him, it could be a Pepsi machine.
They do it movies all the time.
Maybe that's how the sponsors are going to have to get in there some livable pitch.
Because people are going to be avoiding commercials on television like the plague.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi. Let's rely on two for you.
Okay.
One is Brian Jones.
Brian Jones.
Stone, Rolling Stone.
Yeah.
Okay. Well, he was, well, I guess, popular.
Okay. And I don't believe no one's mentioned Steve McQueen yet.
Steve McQueen.
Okay. Thanks.
We'll put those on the list.
No.
Brian Jones.
Steve McQueen.
How about some other Queen? How about Paul Lind?
Sure, effective that show.
Charles, Charles.
Charles, Charles.
Charles, that's why he's not in there.
Oh, he's not?
Not yet.
Oh.
He's, I think he's in the bubbling under.
How about the Charlie Weaver?
How about the Gourney Weaver?
How about, I mean, leave it out obvious.
How about Rick Weaver?
Oh.
Huh?
I mean, I see it.
There's a guy, I just, uh...
The fans are getting the blue, the blue, the, uh, blue, the white selection.
He died.
Yeah.
He did a great job here.
He wasn't a very pleasant guy and he smelled real bad, but, uh, he gets nothing.
I mean, he was like chopped liver.
He just vanished and like nobody other than the Hank who worked with him.
He was fined by me.
Treated with little people.
Okay.
Okay. Well, there you go.
No, he wasn't.
I'll say it again.
He was a real egomaniac and I remember Bill Carver and his wife and the Rick and his wife
and I, we once went to dinner and all Rick talked about the whole dinner was himself.
I mean, the whole meal was consumed with Rick Weaver talking about Rick Weaver, which it wasn't very a great company.
But, but anyway, there's a guy died.
Not that he was a big celebrity or in the category that kind of people were talking about, but just goes to show you in this town.
If you could make any marks, yeah, like even a mark on the ground would like whatever you got.
Like if you have like a chicken farm, if you can like leave a little peck or track behind it, whatever you leave, you know.
It's a miracle because they forget they blow you off here like nothing, you know.
Just like that Bob Gordon called me on there.
Remember that?
Anybody know who that is?
No.
But I remember who it was because he had a great looking son that I hired at WS News.
That's why I remember that.
Oh, the good news is a stake-in check after the hockey game after leaving that game flying out of there to make room for stake-in check Saturday night.
They got white people working on drives you again.
Some of them anyway.
Oh, I feel better.
Don't you feel relieved about that?
Tomuji Anoki.
It's coming.
Yeah, destruction.
I think in the street, it's the apocalyptic music event of a summer.
It's the great food there in concert.
And if you make it out alive, you'll be grateful too.
It's the grateful you're not dead to us during the great food.
Yeah, a bunch of fat middle aged men playing psychic Elegarat songs about peace and love while a new generation of anguish is coming.
And the young fans who totally missed the point of riot in the parking lot because they're pissed off and the boomers were taking all the good stuff.
Ultimately forcing the local authorities to cancel the show to prevent further injuries and loss of life.
It's the grateful you're not dead to your coming soon to prevent you near the youth, perhaps the victim's available.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
The man who got beaten up and midw qu them here's a great list.
He says these are dead ones killed me.

Anisha Jones.
Tim Morrison, Bob Crane, Bill Cullen, Tennessee Oriny Ford, Lucille Baul, Lucie, Lucie.

What is wrong with you people, but it is a good list though?
Especially the dog from
Anyway, this is fantastic. I think John Pierre in the South Miami for facting you this
It's just because you're dead doesn't mean you can't make a good living especially if you happen to be famous while you're alive
lucrative licensing agreements and fat-worldly checks keep rolling in long after many celebrities have shuffled off this mortal coil
Consider Elvis last year the king pulled down an estimated thirty five million dollars fifteen million from Grace Land admissions making him the richest guy in the graveyard

I know what Dr. Seuss is but I don't read that and watch that I'm not in the kid's crap. Okay?
It's a kid at this point. I would I would hope not yeah, but you seem to know a lot about it
I was a kid once. Oh, you have a kid. That's right good excuse and was a kid and grew up with Dr. Seuss like most kid
Well, I didn't I didn't grow up with Dr. Seuss
That's right. That's not to be an old fan anyway

She wasn't really could have made some more movies they cut her off of her. I don't know prime, but yeah
She was alright
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound so we'll put her on a list Charles Schulz
So we got how many names 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16
Well, we got room for more on there. Why not?
There's a lot of famous dead people that you liked but it's not a question of did you like which public figures death affected you the most left
You like oh gee and then it ate that a shame like that's not what I would say
Come on
Stop like just throwing in a bunch of you know dead people for the hell of it
Here's a mobile in Miramar hello
Hey, I need you okay. Hey, I was thinking you forgot why I'll look at effect you but affected me with Stanley Kubrick
Stanley Kubrick
Clockwork orange you know full full metal jacket. Yeah, I know clockwork orange which kind of 2001
Right now right now. What actually I wanted space?
Anisey space space space anise to
2000 and then you don't think of your earth was in that one
but actually
Clockwork orange to me was the one to go because I'm about Malcolm McDowell
Try the line
Okay, I have a great thing. I know he's not dead. I just was checking you know testing him for his knowledge
What a grave is that nobody caught
Keith Herring is some artist
They took me out with a pulley teller who the hell Keith Herring is okay?
I don't even like pickled herring I sure is not gonna be a concern with Keith Herring anyway
Stanley Kubrick is you know was a great guy and it was we're not putting them last
Would you put him on the list? No, I'm not asking you he is not belong on this list
In addition to what James Dean is just so like I said he made three movies and it's all hype anyway
And anybody out there who's affected by life of James Dean must be some faggot, okay?
And us fags can put a lot more important names on there like how about Freddie Mercury?
How about him? This is named along on the list
Since they did so well musically, huh?
You were giving me a big song and an answer so we're the rest of the audience about my taste suck like crazy and Queen
My you couldn't get enough of being there all you had a resexual
You're putting Kurt Cobain in the same category with Freddie Mercury. I was doing stuff actively as a
That's not the point that is the point
Because if they if they're retired if it's over then they're not gonna affect your life when they die
Let me ask her once the last time that Queen came out with the CD. I don't know
But everybody has all this stuff for example John Wayne I grew up thinking he was dead
So when they told me that he died I didn't I grew up hoping that he'd be dead, okay?
And eventually he died. Yeah
So what goes around comes around now I'm not gonna
Well, I would put Freddie on the list Freddie Mercury. Yeah, no. I just was testing it
No, you can't we can't start putting every dead singer on the god damn list. I mean Jim Morrison
John Lennon of course has to be on list that goes without saying
But Jim Morrison didn't represent something that anybody like John Lennon did other than maybe like drugs
Oh
Here we go
Oh, and there's the cheerleaders on it with their pom-poms Trent Lotton CNN right now
Discussion yeah, oh
Runs so you're so big
Oh, well, I've lost my soul was wrong with Lisa Marie
Now we gotta put it up the family trees
I'm sending in my grave and I'm about to throw up I get his ass if I could get dug up
Oh
Well my legs are right
I'm still off to cold in the grave. I got a nasty call a king of pots pop the night
But I got by bus
If I could get
Well a break is going to give him two black eyes and nose
Well to its original side I bleach his skin till he's all gone
Abandoned over while a cheer plugs off so do me a favor if you love me
Bring a back hold to the same Atari you there's a lot of love and pet a pie. I got a beat up
But I can't unless I get dug up
Oh
Somebody dig me up 16 to lune at 560 everybody and their brother not only as an opinion who should be on list
But how we ought to do the list and it's amazing. We're gonna have like 50,000 votes on this thing today
Uh-huh says hand bishop and affected white Lottardale's eating ass. That's pretty interesting
Right still eating ass is what I'm here and I was going to wipe baby
Wonder if he ever got into Diane Magams
Here's Chris Folly Merlin Monroe Lucie Chris Folly no
Merlin Monroe's on the list Lucille ball I
Love loosely
Rock Hudson
Nothing Rock Hudson belongs. I'm a terrible figure fags out there. No, it's not that it was big
But the fact that the now see you're again. You're missing. You're just not getting it
Why can't I communicate with you pipple out there and this one in here? I get it
Which public figures death affected you the most now the way he died the fact he died from AIDS and was the first
Personality public figure who died from it even when we lied through his teeth. It was too late and couldn't lie anymore. Is he the first or just
Well, Tommy who was I don't know. I wasn't he was the first
well-known person who anybody even knew had AIDS a little like Robert Reed they died
They lied about that and they found it after long after his death or months after his death
They found it on his death certificate in the password. He lied
He died any lied. Yeah, you know that Brady Bunch thing and on
MSNBC
Florence had just in his going on with her thing a Western oil that she's care
That's another thing. You know she's always got that jug of Western oil
Just in case it's a yeah, yeah, you never know just to keep it handy in case
But anyway, and she's going on about well, you know, he was such a private person. There was nobody's business. Well
I have mixed feelings about that
Plus the fact that he was a real
Waco on top of that. Did you ever see that thing? Yes, I did
How can you miss and the way that he was a
insistent on a script being entirely accurate looking up things in the dictionary
I mean it was not a silly show he took himself way too seriously and then of course when they give him a
Chant to the stupid shows the variety shows and he was on their singing and missing and dancing that was okay
So we're not putting Robert Reed on a list. Okay. We'll put rock Hudson on there for us take a list
Okay
How about Judy Garland?
So I'm where I mean we agree on her music. She was the best but no
How about Liza Manelli she's not dead yet, but many of us are I don't want to say hoping that would be bad
That would be bad for a modicone like me to say that about Liza Manelli that notorious bag hang that would be very bad
Can't stand that bitch. Here's what it says. What about Jesus? There you go
Yeah, what would Jesus do about this list?
Now we don't put sloppy dressers on there, okay?
Here's an interesting fact from Keith and four Myers who says how about my pet dog or cat?
He says I don't let publicity determine the severity of effect in my life
Can you imagine that the effect at losing tiny or your big dog would have a new versus the death of hacks and has been who because of the
Noterati where wealth and the dry
Rank and drug themselves to death maybe I'm a quarter or instead of a bitch, but now you got a good point there Keith
But that's not what we're talking about
I'm not saying did did when Lucille Brawl died it affected as much as when Snuggles died or something like that. That's not the point
Or like when you're you know father died and you know broke you out of the will or you know something like that
I mean there are people I'm waiting to see there were bitch worried a paper every day and I keep checking still not there
Damn it
By the way Keith and four Myers says PS is raining here
So be able to catch you from new to two PSS
Sparkles definitely bring that property by yours. Thank you Keith and four Myers
Here's another one that says mother to research should be on your list
She died at almost the same time as Princess Diana, but the world paid attention only the death of Diana
Mother Teresa was one of the few great non-materialistic humanitarian in the world says Dave and keep her skin
I guess you're figuring about the fact that she caused all that misery and suffering just like the Pope going around preaching all that
Okay, a crap and making people out a lot of unwanted babies and speaking out against the use of a contraceptives and
Sedron so on and a Bosch and things like that
Just like most people in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and an inflictor of pain and suffering and
A wrinkled up old bitch on top of it
Yeah, they showed her from our 15 seconds that weekend and all the rest of the time we had to see Diana who allegedly was young and glamorous
Well, they got the young part right was she beautiful. No, she glamorous. No, no
She was this another plastic bitch from that royal family just another money grab and bitch
Here's one that says George is right only less people who died in their prime preferably from some violent cause her from a massive drug overdose
There you go. That's a good idea now get Kurt Cobain on there. No, don't don't do it
What he got their beast I
Didn't mention what a great job the beast did here last money and actually said good things about me on the year over the weekend
Which we heard thanks be
It says how about Joe to measure your Andy Kaufman
No
How about Ralph S. Kaufman the Georgia's Copman whatever his name was Ralph Kaufman's a harness driver. How about your
Just Kaufman how about Ben Sir how about George and go ahead right? How about the Eddie Cohn?
I'm not gonna say Marty Cohen how about Eddie. How about him?
Can't write no more praying
Joe the man you already say how do you've gone to even wrongs out of list? I sure why not oh Merlin and Rokin be on there
Although I don't believe that she ever let him actually touch her. Yeah. Oh
Probably a couple times. No, no, no, don't say that. That's like a
Justin Tinkerbell there like in Britney Spears. You don't really believe that do you know? I heard that she was Jolton Joe. Oh
Really
Yeah
I'm not I have a great line for that, but we need to need the job
Here's one from Harris who says is a baby woman with a death of Michael Landon and the Nasdaq sure if you affected
This somewhat yeah the Nasdaq that's my favorite
Yeah, whoever Nasdaq is he's dead down another 14 right now
Michael Landon now what a coin and he this guy probably saw the thing also on MSNBC this weekend legends and headliners
Whatever that thing is the same six shows they have over and over again Michael Landon was good
Little Joe
Yeah, and it looked pretty good to as a matter of fact little Jew little no, he was not a Jew sure he was
Want me Michael Landon was a Jew that's why little house on the prayer you never heard the word Jesus in the church
It was always God this God. He was playing a priest in that one show was the last it was it not us the one they did before that
For the collar on who was playing a priest
Which is connecting Michael Landon wasn't Jewish trust me. I don't trust you when it comes to the two guys
Hey, if any Jews out there George comes you says trust me don't do it. Not a good idea. I
Say no, I don't think so. It's just those Israelis
It'll trust them. I tell him if you're on that
Okay, no Michael Landon's not going on, but he was you know, he was significant
His you know, he had a lot of work lately even for Kodak, but he was he was pretty good. He had big hair
He was good looking. He was a very good looking guy
Not that you would know, but he was he was no John Schroeder, but he's not dead yet
Who John Schroeder who's that?
From the dukes of hazard was that a night? Did I say Schroeder? Yeah, you're thinking of rich
No, I'm thinking of her Charles Schroeder. Schroeder shows going to the dogs
Linus
But anyway, so I say Rick Schroeder. Yeah, Rick Schroeder. There's a really good. Gile. Let's hope that he dies so we can talk about him
I think it's this is finally cleared up his tips is I didn't know he was Jewish. Is he Jewish at all?
Let's ask if Michael Landon was orthodox. Okay, anybody out there know that Michael Landon was Jewish
I don't believe that Dynas show was Jewish. How about her? Is she dead?
Don't you sure? Yes, she did. I think so see the USA in your share. We're like what you never saw that
Yes, yeah, that was what she was famous for cream singer land of a paper sack
See the USA she couldn't sing a note, but she was okay till they did this is your life without favorites
I've told this before her name was Rose Fanny Shore or something like that and when it came out on there that she was Jewish
She had a look at her post like oh, where do I hide the attissues, you know?
Man, where do I hide the Mazusa?
Here's Miami Lake. He left upon the okay, good nice talking to you. That's not like Bob Gordon
Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello. Okay. How you doing? Pretty good
I'm Mike before I get to my my co-land in West, Jewish he had some Polish his real name was like a Polish name
Oh, I don't remember I'm wondering I remember without him is after he got diagnosed
I think he had pancreatic cancer, which is like a death sentence
Right he came on Johnny Carson. I don't know if they showed the clip on that on the show
I'm talking about an MSNBC. They showed that I mean whatever else you want to say about the guy
Yeah, that takes a ball. Yeah, he went he went out with class. That's right
He had a little press conference then he came on Carson one last time and he died, you know
I mean, you know, yeah
This one I don't know if anybody's mentioned and it just what it happened it hit me much harder than I would have expected
And yeah, I think it goes to prove how good of a job he did and what he did and that was when Harry Kerry died
I felt just so sad you know something I have now George Wolling degree because you're not a sports nerd
But I'm not carrying I'm putting on the list because you know something I
I was not somebody the other day when I got my satellite dish
I started watching the cubs because I don't care about the cubs because they're Harry Kerry and then after he died
I stopped watching the cub games
I don't care about the cubs anymore than I used to before but I watched mostly for Harry because he made an exciting and entertaining
I was I was in college at Michigan State actually
When he first started broadcasting for the cubs it was on the cable hey Neil
We had nothing to do during the summer up there. It was the early 80s or a gallery session
We used to watch the cops every afternoon
I just started to he was like he was your friend and when he died how about Mel Allen see that's before my time
But I'm not knocking it, but I can't
But Prince
How about Bill and you it okay you go again? I'm I'm faster you and you go before
I brought the Brooks, but you understand what I'm saying sure these guys who are good at what they did
Right these sportscasters you really felt like they were your friend
Mm-hmm and when I went to Cooper's town and you have Harry bottle cap
Coat bottle glasses there, right, you know, you just say oh it makes you feel sad
So it's kind of strange, but yeah, you're right. I'm putting him on the list. Well, that's good
I wanted to raise one other thing if I can't off the topic on
You said you went to the hockey game Saturday briefly. Yeah, I didn't go I went
So I don't know how they'll steer and go and I flew out of there and even though least you know
I went home while we watch the rest, but that was a disgusting performance by the leaves terrible. I went Friday
Which was an exciting game for two periods, but the Saturday game I had on the TV and it was a seven o'clock start
And I think this tells you that one of the things that's wrong with the NHL
I also put on at 7 30 was I don't know if you were aware of this was Michigan State University of Michigan
We're playing in the CCHA final. No, so it started to half hour later. It was on the small dish on Fox Sports Detroit
It started to half hour later, but it ended in real time about five minutes after the Panthers game
Because they don't have all the PS they don't have all the music in between everything right
They don't have all these commercial and hockey games know and not worth a crap unless you got we a lot of blurring music
Just driving the people nuts and making it deaf and so you can't hear the people are talking to you
This game was three times more exciting, right?
Toronto right. I'm sure that and you know, and it was
In addition to what since you mentioned and I wasn't going to bring it up
But it's really nauseating but typical to me that they had standing on a Friday because Mario was here
And I'll admit Mario is the best player in the world
But Mario isn't nearly as there's a difference between being the best and the most exciting right and pop out
Like I've said now since he's come here is the most exciting player who plays the game today anywhere in the world
And he is so much on fire now. It's unbelievable and yet they will not pack the place and nobody comes to see him play
So the idea that the hype once again the hype wins over and I got standing them only the only song out of there because Mario's in town
But probably they can see like you know 41 times a year
Forget about it any time he touches the puck in the year. Yeah, don't know what I'm saying
I'm going just to see him because you know, it's the rest of it is pathetic
But Jesus Christ. I mean there's no comparison and they they don't appreciate what they got
But I just thought it was interesting how much
Quicker the game went and how much more exciting it was without all that crap. Yeah, but the NHL
Well, too bad they can't speed it up like a baseball game. I agree. Have a great day pal
Well, here's the Harry goodbye. Okay. Like one of those four-hour baseball games
Five to and it won't be long. Maybe we'll be having those games on in the daytime here
It's all the next abishing games that they're gonna get a bit and I love Gildey sucking this morning
They're up there at the and Vera Vera and Gildey's in oh yeah, well. I'm sure you know starting this year
It's gonna be a better team and the fans will slowly start coming back
Man, why are you such a suckhold Gildey? Why are you and the people on that morning show such little suck holes, huh?
Suffer Joe that let the Tory have a day and even David J. Neil ice-cold their schwarz schwarz boy
I guess it must have been his question that got interrupted in the press conference last week because he were wrote a
Skaving commentary about Viltory and his intempered behavior in commentary nice going there David

You
The
see i'm sitting here doing the survey today in generally when i take a poll i
got some idea what my votes can be
and i'm looking through this list here and uh... to be honest with the on
pretty damn unimpressed
uh...
i'm not saying it's not a good list as far as the choices but i'm talking about
me personal

that was sad
uh...
gun down and like that
jfk
would have been my vote except for the fact that this guy called in harry
plus the fact that was thirty eight years ago
although there's there again there's a difference we can argue we go into
the fine i'd about you know whether the guy was in the prime of his life and
the guy was still a present harry carry was a dot or a gold guy who kept
having strokes and falling down so you know that's part of it too
will be we'll be doing that on next survey which one of these died the most
gruesome death that made you like you know pica got shot does that impact
it more if they died you know tragically suddenly if they sit were sick for
a long time in the new is coming well they have like figure pull like a
figure skating a point for that you know
style points

we got plenty of names which public figures death affected you the most
damn it JFK Bobby Kennedy Martin Luther King John Lennon Elvis
princess Diana how about the Lindbergh baby uh they learned hard
John Wayne how could you say John Wayne doesn't belong on a list that is so
it's ridiculous not going to have affected anyone
it'll be like one in the last three
Jerry Garcia JFK Jr. Frank Sinatra Jackie

no huh no no you talking about well I mean she's being honest with affected her she
shed a tear too she sat down and balled like a baby and that's just the way it is
she just telling you how it affected her see one thing about many of you people out
there and this is very important some more some pearls of wisdom from the fatal
fact on a radio and that is that many people especially in this country think
that there is like some kind of a uh uh predictability there's a form and
like people are supposed to behave or react in a certain way it's like the
pull question you know you believe in God is there an all of that crap you
believe in heaven and hell all of this garbage
and when you know and people make him up with some oddball things and who the
hell am I to say that if you thought that when uh Ish Kabibble died that was
like uh uh um Hermione Gingold maybe you like Hermione Gingold George is
looking like who the hell was that no many of business some old Jew who used to
be on crucial that's book of life he'll give you a whole life story
Hermione Gingold Hans Conrad Panaman Quiz Mike Stokey but he's dead oh no not
Mike Stokey Jesus Christ there's so much of that going
around
so you know different strokes for different folks different stokes
how about Marie Stokes who?
I have no penis
strange things in my box they're crawling round here chewing on my
balls this is revenge here yes I should have been a nicer guy on earth
nibbling at my brain are tiny critters I know this for sure this place is a
sh**ter I've done better dives than this could someone turn on the f**king
life
yeah strange things I have done or should I say that I have ordered it to be done
like cooling while with people's knee caps with a gun
but things go for fun hey it passed the time away but look it's time to pass away so
though I may be gone I'm not forgotten how just decompose and smell kind of rotten
I'm just real worm food the strange things in this box
hey close the left for Christ Stoke would you get stuck
I hate when that happens well this thing sure have a long fade out
there is Delta see I didn't realize that okay at 12.15 at 5.60 here's the info on
Hermione Gingold how do you like that
died May 24th 1987 of cardiac problems in pneumonia she was uh 90 years old perhaps
best remembered from her role in Gigi and of course notable TV gets the
princess Hermione Gingold anybody know who that is no just named Bokobrine whoever
fact knew this anyway Michael Landon went to the University of Southern California
and won a javelin throwing scholarship at the U.S.C but eventually lost his scholarship due to
a torn ligament which also went in his athletic career how you like that he could have been
athlete he was the only actor so far oh they're hockin and banging again down there
they're banging on it oh maybe that's Frankie trying to bang his well out of the box
Michael Landon was the only actor so far to have three consecutive shows on tv each of which ran
for five years or more which they pointed out in that very moving piece on MSNVC over the weekend
he should be on our list shouldn't he yeah I think so yeah let's get Michael Landon on there
maybe it's a big star I'm sorry but he really gets got to be on there I'm not gonna cost nothing
huh yeah put Michael Landon on there how about you get to a few vote
anyway each of which ran for five years or more more Nanzan 1959 273 little house on the Prairie
rhymes with Mary and highway to heaven that's one where he had the Getschkees go collar on the
priest I believe and Turd at Hillside Memorial Park Culver City California Turd
Turd you turd right so there go Michael Landon he was a good guy never still a freight train his
idea was to portray to put television programs on without sex or violence which of course a lot of
us we could do without the violence part without the sex part well we're not too happy about that
that's what John Schroder I mean John Schneider said I gotta get me credit for one thing I didn't
watch that show dukes of hazard did not watch that show as much as I love John Schneider couldn't I

wrong with you people out there but here's a great fact that says company didn't mention that

not just good actor and actress but really super people tremendous people
and it says here's a test for your listeners listen very carefully all you people out there turn
up the radio and just sit down listen here's a test for your listeners if you really think of
famous person is bigger lost than a loved one something is very very wrong to which I say
right that's why all that's phony bull crap but the the of the TV manipulating the public with the
JFK junior and the plane crash and Diana and the car crash well what the hell did she ever do
what did what did she represent especially the people in this country how come all of us oh yeah
now she's on top this must be bogus how she's in a lead
protest eyes in the lead yeah she just moved ahead with 17 votes this this is going on joking
I'm not joking that's what it says on there this has to be today's bogus you know every time we do
one of these kind of polls there's one bogus one just to piss me off she represents silly people
worshipping royalty right she represents a snobbery and snoovingness and silliness in a tremendous
waste of money and a bunch of crap the opposite of every and that's just her but also the what's
the name from the big department store that the the father-in-law the Arabs yeah what that was his name
the dobi how do you do the how do you do these something like that all the law will be a falloff
yeah whatever his name was do be do be do be yeah if I had there yeah whatever his name was some
laundry head anyway here's what it says the seven challenge restaurants well I mean that's
first of all they want celebrities number one but I mean I can't understand that before they
went up there there no oh oh oh bad that was bad how about the school teacher she's still dead
clear to the other one please add these two to your list speaking of dead people Sam Kineson and
Stan Major's career very good now here's why I'm going to have to censor this is a little bit
emotional it says one reason I love Michael Landon was that Tom jica hated him jica made him at
some convention LA and asked some stupid questions to which land and rip that fat schmock it says with
a f a huge ass ever since and especially since his death Tom asshole jica has tarnished the land
and land and memory I only wish Tom jica could make your list I would pee on his picture it says piss
I pee on his picture every Sunday in the paper and if I ever met him in person I kick him in his ass
Tom jica is the problem that South Florida can't get rid of signed Mrs. jica oh there you go Tom they

at the height of what he was doing he was cutting it you know with the razor blade although we all
believe that Courtney did it Courtney's cock she shot him yeah full of music um huh bitch yeah smart
day he was still a smarmy scumbag though sure yeah but what he wanted was from Seattle for then
again so with the candidates there were some army scumbags they were like yeah I just they were
like more dignified smart we scumbag they did like more like intellectual or smarminist like
Ted David says about Wall Street you know intellectual Las Vegas the Kennedys were like intellectual
thieves as opposed to like the mobsters were like more common because I guess they were Italian
or the Kennedys were Irish maybe that's the difference between the Irish show mobsters and the
Italian is that the Irish were like a little more dignified like you know the old man if we lose
the old man 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and T and Verizon wireless line what about Marlon

you die yeah 245 at 560 WDQAM biography for William Conrad possessed of a
little bit bellotone voice William Conrad was also the narrator of radio program escape he was
original martial mad dillin on gunsmith radio show born September 27 1920 died from
or 11 1994 so we died at the age of 74 not bad not I was fat fat Jake and the fat man cannon
short live near old wolf he lost the world who mad dillin to James Arnes on TV he also reads
unsuspected comic cards is narrator the rocky and bollinkled TV cartoons and you know that
no I didn't know that either oh that's right now and I remember the voice but then there I
know something I think if I had to pick maybe one day we'll do it although it's very difficult
dealing with these punks out there but if you had to pick the best TV show of all time which how do
you do that like pick the best meal of your life you know the rocky and bollink are left that's
got to be right up there great yes titles there there were no bad episodes everyone was like
and of course one another one of those shorts that supposedly was for kids but definitely was for
adults definitely all the stuff went over the kid like most of my stuff goes over most of your head
it was the same thing you know sailing way over their head William Conrad good man but you see what
you're missing the essence of this the essence of emerald you know I ever smell it yeah that's
the essence of him but when he dies that's gonna be I don't think I'll be here I'm hoping though
but anyway the what which public figures death affected you the most in other words like
brought you the tears maybe now when JFK died that brought me to tears but I didn't vote for him I
voted for Harry Curie did I cry when Harry Curie died no I said the tear would have built you
with died I'm not gonna put that in here because nobody in this audience knows who that is
now thank you by the way whoever fact me here's that letter I was talking about from Delores
Tesla and Boynton Beach in a hero this morning why tell you hear this the heading says water saving
toilet question mark what genius came up with the water saving toilet the average bowl takes two
or three flushes to clear and then we'll must have a boar bar shandy to finish the job in 50 years
of marriage three kids in ten house moves I never had a problem until this ingenious invention
signed the lowest Tesla and Boynton Beach to have it only useful a cramp do you have one no a
water saving toilet no although I will pay to this I do have one toilet that requires if you have
like floaters not in your eyes but in your bowl my toilet the one of my bathroom that requires like
sometimes couple of flushes sometimes I flush more than once the other the another bathroom it's
a more suction now they hit they do have I know that sounds like very non-cosmetic
but they do have for household use now they like the toilets we have here where you have those no
no but they have like that look that look better that don't look like they belong in some kind of
like airport bathroom or something they work and they don't waste all that water right because
the bull doesn't have to refill it doesn't work that way doesn't have a tank uses high pressure
or whatever you use it right out of it right yeah right out into the ground here's what it says
you've got your regard see how about you morstner they give more hope than jury my thing yeah you will
well I mean okay and I don't know I'm just getting tired of adding more to the list because Eric is
taking out let's put on Jim Morrison on their okay Eric you're not doing anything anyway all the time
that you spend putting more stuff on there is less time eating now what what do you laugh about it's
true I want to save his life he's the great Eric is the best our website is spectacular it's
one the best in the world he does his dependant job for us making about six bucks a week doing it

was a beanie doesn't it yeah Buffalo Bob Smith born Richard Schmidt was his real name how you
like that he knew he Schmidt born of every 27 1917 in Buffalo New York which I didn't know that which
is probably what they call the Buffalo Bob there you go with the second they didn't call him like
Utica Bob date of death July 30th 1998 Hendersonville North Carolina of cancers where he lived to 81 not
too bad Buffalo Bob Smith sometimes credit is Robert East Smith it's how he duty time it's how

uh you brand them better known as mr. Green jeans and Captain Kangaroo mr. Green James he died
he died when he died April 1987 14 years ago and it kind of just looked at one in their
honest and just slipped right on truth so a lot of dead people we're going to name them all here today
here's Miami hello Miami yes sir hello Neil sorry it's okay you know I haven't heard this one but I thought
you'd hear it uh Mickey Mantle how much you had before you mentioned it uh huh yeah all right I don't
think you get too many sympathy votes now after the way he dittled around for that livery you know
yeah but you know those two are the old days where people played where you really really
right that's right they stayed on a safe team for more than five minutes and they weren't making
eighty-two thousand dollars you're right you know that's true and also uh Michael Landon by the way I
looked it up for you uh Eugene uh oh what is that was oil what's it yeah somebody beat you to it thanks
a lot okay take it thanks I bet you was Jewish oh I'm so introred that now you think everybody's Jewish
you think everybody's gay there was a great letter of the editor in a hero yesterday by Chris
Falco and Miami A. Rod loses a fan during spring visit I'm gonna tell you it for tomorrow
and then this epitomizes what's going on with all these sports it's all going on the toilet I was
the first one to predict that five years ago I told maybe more than that I told you escalating
salaries out of control owners who just won't put their feet down and say no all these owners
demanding more and more millions and trillions from the public for stadiums and arenas for more sky
boxes and millions and trillions and ticket prices just out of just up to the sky they've outpriced
the public and they pissed off the public so what do you think the new format will be the other 20
hours I know that sports is basically dead and also the xfl out there themselves because the
NCAA is around xfl last night's the lowest ratings in the history of any sports uh even the hockey
game the lowest ever nice going there xfl so we can also I guess we can put them in a calm of
dead also now Diana is bogus so just keep that in mind but I'll just read you what's on the list
princess Diana's got 30 John L. R 33 John L. R. with 30 John F Kennedy 27 JFK junior 23

Kurt Cobain just got on there he's already got three I told you belong down there
Charles Schultz Michael and in Joe DeVasio each have a pair Marilyn Monroe's got one Jackie

10 to yeah she she talked like a retard but she knew friends probably who was the money that

hoarder there's no question about it she was a dignified hurl like I said those people they did
it like you know with dignity the Kennedys the whole clan because she got more money just like
the guy that scapegold guy that offered a little girl they did it with dignity and then again the
erratus up there now what am I looking at here well I didn't finish the list here Dan and they
refurbished that was that much more laddy Jackie and and also guess who else has done oh Jim

addict he was a bad person he was a bad role model we're not asking about role models we have
a lot of drug addicts out there in his audience even the drug addicts have to have like a role
model that's why George was a show sometime even the people we asked have to have a role model

what kind of space would I hatch it here's the lady in pepper pine so yeah it's a nil I might have
one more person for your list okay my husband and my personal for all-time people it was Roy
Orbison and uh the possibility yeah he was I mean he was great I guess in the 60s and stuff and then
later on he kind of made it come back and then he had a I think he had a heart attack and so
all of a sudden we'll excited to our committee okay thanks a lot all right now you want to know
what he could be on there but you know I won't put him on there because we have a group of
four Orbison fetishes out there he'll make princess Diana pay one of them in significance so
unfortunately I mean I'm I'm sure he could do very well but so well that it would really like a
skill oh you got some incense going on I can smell it yeah let's recover up our drugs we're doing

five minute he's okay he's a good guy he means well he's harmless and I discovered
what he kind of does the only does he he like goes out in the hallway and looks around kind of like a
fireman you know in many ways and he likes put he likes to put out little fires you know he

interview come out Dorothy five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and for
Ryan's a wireless line this is a this is a hoot it's a hoot and a toot and I bet you would get
like 50,000 of votes on this by tomorrow if you watch here's some of the VVV real ones here's
the lady in plantation hello Neil yes ma'am hi I'm a little disappointed that people think that
does celebrities and singers although we miss them and they you know they entertain us
have really made that much of an effect in our life I did ask them the questions so you can
blame me for that but I just don't know there is one thing I blame you for but I'll tell you
a little later what you get mad at me okay but I just want the people out there to know I don't
remember JFK but I do reread a lot and if JFK hadn't died and if Bobby hadn't died and
again if Martin Luther King hadn't died this country I don't think we would have wouldn't have
gotten Nixon we would have wouldn't have had watergate right wouldn't would not probably would have
had run a break it certainly wouldn't have had Ford and and I just want to say that that affected
our lives that's why we I don't think the right wing the religious right would have a hold on this
country if those people hadn't died but what I'm disappointed about with you is that you put
Chris Cobain on there but the woman who said they're good Marshall I mean he's one of the finest
people that ever walked the earth right and he if if he was on the Supreme Court now it wouldn't
be like it was right you know during that last so I don't disagree with her I mean he was a great
man and he's probably died but he died but he wouldn't have gotten five votes right and now you
know I but I cried when he died right and I want to tell you something else I saw John Schneider
in person yeah I never thought he was good looking I you know maybe we have different taste in
person you know how sometimes you see somebody and you say oh god they must put a lot of makeup on
yeah he is a hundred times better looking in person than on the TV oh my god you think he's
good looking oh my he has still blue eyes and you're something about how long ago was this
that you saw him oh it was about 10 years oh but his complexion and he's got he's just he's a
presence yeah I worked for near line made a bow on him huh I said put a bow on him yeah I'm
a blonde and I never went for blondes but he was I'll tell you when I saw him he was he's very
good looking okay but anyway um Kurt Cobain's okay but those other people really made a difference
in our lives more how about Penny Marshall Penny Marshall have a great day Suida okay bye-bye
it was it was just a joke just a joke little joke what was that show Laverne in the squirley
what was that awful the other thing they did in the beginning about there with the song
Shamil Shamil Salmano Oh my god see see one thing about those people in New York they don't realize
that most of the country is Graham okay so all that New Yorkie stuff don't be talking to you
I don't know but I mean Shamil and Salamazal come on Penny Marshall oh I'm not saying how
about you partial oh baby come play with these titties 160 to 560 WQAM here's the fact that I
just I'm a little confused on this from Lee and Fort Myers says clarification on Don at Bob's
I was just there two weeks ago the one that closed yesterday is the restaurant on Munro Avenue
that was a satellite of the one at the lake it is not done to original or the one at sea breeze they're
both still open how about that hot sauce has anyone suggested the shuttle after not
free list yes they have but you know they're not celebrities like you were sitting till after
the thing blew up but anyway I don't how how could you say the one on Munro Avenue was only a
satellite I do understand the one at sea breeze was maybe the first one and maybe the most popular
but the one on Munro Avenue was like the headquarters of my life that was it right there just blocks
away from where we lived on Verena road for whatever the hell I was right there by the corner of
a Munro and Witten Avenue and Rochelle and Brighton anybody out there know about Brighton New York
Norris now what the hell do you people know too many people from New York City New York City ain't nothing
well used to be once upon a time used to be great now they got Rudy Julian and now they got
the goddamn good stopper in here and they got all those Puerto Ricans messing up Central Park again
yeah MSNBC yesterday they were showing like surveillance videos of robberies and 7-11s and all
that stuff and then they showed the the videos that people took with the mosaic and everything on the
Jack Moiseev you know the checkerboard thing so you don't actually get to check
Moiseev now they're Jewish harness driver what is it when they don't actually show you the
dirty parts yeah now they really didn't need any because there were so many people clutching
grabbing them in the beginning of that they need to cover anything up but it was the pretty
disgusting was a bunch of animals and barbarians they're in Central Park and believe me
I don't want to say it okay let's go to a mobile in Melbourne hello
I know how you doing but yes sir what about some like a fabulous dough and you do Bob Hope

probably no first time he was a uh boom sound and a drug addict and has somebody else
living that he stuck a lot nine years on and why's that music show up he wants to
do it he wants to mess the beginning of the show sir I got my thumb right on it baby we started

you feel it feels vibrations down there again don't start with us today we're having a really good

six that there's nobody doing live stuff out of here except during the updates which is only a
couple minutes out of the hour what manages on that's when you get your drill in your hammer and
you start banging and knocking and doing all this crap there are a lot of things that would make
sense here if we were real radio station like we said before just a Bob Ramut said this morning
