The Neil Rogers Show on 560 QAM.
It's big now.
It's big enough both of them.
I'm going to be the big guy.
Oh yes, I'm boring and I'm serious.
But I am the Duke of Mass.
I'm so curious.
Oh, big.
I have absolutely no charisma.
But I look like he's the catamon.
And maybe people will vote for me by accident.
Now can I have a free challenge?
I'm going to be the big guy.
Oh yes, I'm maybe very popular.
But I am the Duke of Mass.
Oh, my soul cheers.
Oh, right.

He's trying to get out, slipping out.
But Joni came to help me to see her sense.
The river.
The river.
He's standing there.
Yes!
That was him standing, to see his sense of back eh.
He was here with him standing there.
He was there with him in the front側.
That was him stand there, probably.
Thank you, Bravet.
Oh, he merits a lot ofona.
Well, sisters.
on out there in the world. Not a thing people say. What the heck is going on? Let me tell you, who's the fear of this?
Who built the stone in his battlehead? Yeah, I mean, the guys won't land the streets, pushing shop in cart.
When you think they're talking to Allah, they're talking to themselves.
Man knows they're talking to Him.
Hey, kill this, kill this, kill this. You know what's going on? That's a permute of triangle.
Let's go down the permute of triangle.
Kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this, kill this.
Ah, a lazy nilbert.
Captain nilbert.
Comment or albert is.
Yeah, man, you know people without their faith. People without their faith come to me.
They don't look like doctors, but they don't look like cleaners, all that star trek jobs.
They look like hell, don't they?
Hell, don't they? Everybody in outer space looks like Elvis.
Because Elvis is a perfect being.
We're all moving to perfect peace and harmony towards Elvis' existence.
Soon all will become Elvis.
Everything, everywhere will be Elvis.
What do you think they call it? Elvis' in any way.
It's really Elvis' loser.
Elvis' loser.
Elvis' in his head, everywhere.
Elvis' in his head, the king, yeah.
Elvis' in his head, the king.
Elvis, in his head, Elvis' in his head.
Elvis' in his head, the king, it's his just for the fruit of our.
Sarah Cooper Cecci is watching over Barry.
Elvis'ioso is a myself saying, and he wants toheus, and he wants toический.
Elvis' in his head, Elvis' notation, yes!
Elvis.
This is only Bennet.
Suva, there he goes,
10-17, I haven't heard that in a Cooons age.
Skid, Roper and Moldio Nixon, is that correct?
That is absolutely correct. What a memory, huh?
My memory is getting sharper.
Things are becoming crystal clear.
Everything is coming into focus as in focus.
That's right.
As in here comes Malcolm Phillips on the far outside
with a seven horse in the eighth race at Hazel Park.
Anyway, how come somebody's faxing me this old guy named
Stupid Booker in Waston All our fax paper,
which I had to stop and clear it and cancel it
on our fax machine?
Are you some kind of a crazy person out there?
Oh.
God.
Here's a mobile implantation.
Hello?
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
A long time listener in Georgia Shore Messeley.
I was wondering, can you tell me a general admission for highly a park?
Do you know what that is up there?
I beg your pardon?
To get it to highly a park.
What type of you want to go there for?
Because I don't think my wife there for a birthday.
They got their free concerts they said this weekend.
Yeah.
More than you can afford.
Really?
Yeah.
My sister's high school secretary.
You should see that she's got pictures of him with her in my pocket.
Him with a Billy Goad, yeah.
Yeah, with his arm around her.
I said, what's that?
What's wrong with his face?
We'll go under Billy Goad, yeah.
Yeah, I said, what's wrong with his face?
You know, he's got a bad compression.
I said, bad compression.
He's got more pimples and carter's got pills.
Yeah.
All right, Neil.
What's your show?
It's asked, okay.
Have a good time at High Aliah, sir.
All right.
And watch out for the panhandlers out there.
And all those old Julios.
All right.
Anybody going to High Aliah?
No.
I sure hope not.
So anyway, let me do this for Clarence first.
Subaru and WQAM present our 2001 college hoop hysteria contest.
Log on to wqam.com and start making your selections for round one of the NCAA tournament.
You have until noon today to get your Thursday picks in.
Prizes will be given away after reaching out.
Oh, Clarence, you're a genius.
He says, only to read this between 10 a.m. and noon.
Well, evidently, that's the case, Clarence, because if they have noon today to get their Thursday picks in,
obviously, we only need to read it between the now and noon, right?
But nevertheless, Prizes will be given away after reaching out to Grand Prize winner walks away with $1,000.
courtesy of Subaru and sports radio 560WQ, but they am.
Speaking of sports stuff, mad dog mandat will be on for Hank David Buster.
Yeah!
Is where I'll be doing the show today.
Thanks, Dr. and Vegas.
Nice going, Air Humber.
Knock him dead, baby.
That's right.
Win about 20, 30 million out there and spread it around.
We can use it.
So here's how pulled it in.
And I'll take it while I'm taking this question.
I'm sure we'll have some discussion on this if the phone ever rings.
All you never know.
You never know.
Why just have to play all these tapes that stand brought.
What's your damn good?
I like it.
That might do cock-ass thing.
That do Cameroon.
I love that.
I could play that from now on too and just never get tired of it.
Anybody remember Michael Ducakis?
No.
Well, yeah.
Easy to forget your people.
Sorry, George.
No, it is that you could like step on that guy.
Look at all the Democratic candidates.
Over the last many, many, you know they got Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter and Michael Ducakis.
And then they got Walter Mockon.
Albert Ostergoster, Indian Gore.
Wow.
What a group.
And of course don't forget Geraldine Farrow and her mob family.
Just to make sure.
Just in case Ducakis had any chance which he didn't.
They made sure they threw the mob lady in there.
Well, it wasn't her.
It was her husband.
It was somebody that once had dinner with at this Italian restaurant.
It's something like that.
Yeah.
I mean, he wasn't exactly a mob guy but his nose got a little out of joint.
Whatever it was.
So, our poor question today is because I've noticed and it's an interesting thing.
I've told you many times because I catch on to what I'm doing here.
Over it took me about 100 years to catch on to what.
But I know who the lay of the land.
I know that our audience they come and they go.
I mean, we have loyalist news out there.
But then we also have people, you know, who pretend to be your fans.
And then you say one thing like that guy at the hockey games.
And right away they give you a dirty look and you're a son of a bitch.
And you know, that's just the way this business is.
So every time you lay like alienate one group out there, you have to keep replacing them.
And I've talked about this many, many times.
If you want to keep it up and you're waiting too, you have to like keep building new audience.
So we keep like recharging and refreshing and whatever.
And you have to do it.
Now going back to the election, that was kind of like a turning point.
There was a regurgitation of a certain group of people in this audience.
And I have a feeling that some of them might have been, of course, there were a lot of the Bush people.
But that wasn't a regurgitation.
That was just like they took a hiatus.
And then they ran out of that speed trap on tap and hiatus and they came back to us.
But they went over there with fat ass, limbo for a couple of months, because they were counting chads.
And they wanted to hear about all of the stuff, et cetera and so on.
Then they got tired of it because after all, how many times can you hear about the Mark Rich and Fat Rich, you know?
So they came back.
So those people we understand, and we've already pardoned most of them, just like Bob was handing out pardoned, what the hell can't we do it.
But I think that there was a certain segment.
I don't want to say Jews. I don't want to say that because that would be bad to say Jews on the air.
But I think that we some of our Jews may have been a little bit of, huh?
What are you laughing about?
You should be enjoying this. Oh, that's why it's laughing.
Some of the Jews in the audience, I love the Jewish people.
I think between Jew Lieberman and in my comments about the super Orthodox Jews being the scum of the earth and the lowest done.
And I stand by that. I make no apologies for that.
See, one thing about me that you probably have learned, if you listen more than five minutes, I don't sit here pandering to anybody.
I don't sit here. I don't come in anymore and say, well, what can I do or say today that it's going to get those ratings up?
Because if I did that, I certainly would have done about 90% of what I've been doing in the last 25 years.
I don't do that. I don't play that game.
So if you like the show, great. That's fine, even though you may disagree.
But if you don't like the show and you're pissed off at something I said about the Jews or whatever it was, well, bye, bye, bye.
Yes, bye, bye. See ya. Adios. Happy Pro-Hum. Happy Sukas. Happy Pace-Arch. Happy, uh...
I'm happy you, I'm Kipper. Happy Russia, Shara. I want to get them in all now just before they go, bye, bye, bye.
And leave. Don't forget to nail your Missouri Real Tide on the doorframe, et cetera.
Yeah. I think that's the latest around me. Of course, we had, you know, a little problem with the spits back there during the Ailean Tito days.
But, you know, that's all over now. And many of them have come back, including the ones whose numbers we give out on the areas today.
But they're all back, huh? Well, payback is sometimes a beach. A beach. Life is a beach.
But now we have this little jaw problem here and we just have to find out what it's all about.
So that's going to be our poor question. Maybe we'll have a little conversation about this today or not, because I see there ain't nothing going on there right now.
What? There ain't nothing going on. What would it mean by that?
Well, like first guy with his homage to the cost of getting in the Haya-Lia, he was pretty good.
He's better than most of the colors we had yesterday. I'll tell you that.
And talking about Wayne's Pac-Marked Face and his naked pictures with the Billy Gough, that was pretty good.
And Bill Tory playing all that comedy with him. So anyway, here's our poor question today.
And this is awkwardly. Maybe you can help me phrase this a little bit better before Eric sticks it on there.
Which of Neil's comments piss you off the most?
See, this isn't phrased well. Usually my poor questions are phrased. Like yesterday was perfect. But today isn't very good.
Which of Neil's comments piss you off the most? About guns? About Orthodox Jews? About Cuba? Wait a minute, about Orthodox Jews? About Cubans? About religion? About blacks? About politics? Or none?
As in none of his comments piss me off.
That's where it's fine.
Is it?
I don't want to stick it on there awkward and the poll either. Never stick your poll awkward. That's my suggestion. All your young people out there. Learn that and you'll be a safe the rest of your life.
Never stick your poll out there awkward. Always stick that in there the right way. That's a good poll. Yeah.
Yeah, let's find out. And of course, maybe we do this a little bit late for some of the Jews because some of those people are growing.
Like that guy at the hockey games will be orange here and the glasses and the sour look on his face. Like somebody who just farted next to him.
Or remember you did that other poll. That by the way, well, what are you, the what are you poll? And there were a way for you to choose the either one of us thought we were out there.
Right. And that's not the way where there are a lot fewer Jews, but there are a Jews, but there were also a lot fewer atheists and agnostics who had been raised Jewish.
I would have assumed since Judaism is a very kind of like benign kind of a religion other than what they're killing Palestinians.
But I mean other than that.
And other than in biblical days when they were killing all their enemies at God's direction.
But other than that, it's relatively benign, at least in terms of, you know, they're not going to be fighting anywhere. They're not doing the, the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons knock on the door and they're not going to get the money.
They're going to get the money. And they're going to buy them white shirts and the ties all the way. Do like the Mormons. They're really cute. But anyway, huh? They are. Those Mormon guys. And I bet you they're horny too, where in a real underwear tied underwear all day.
Yes, they are. Yeah. repressed. It's friction. They know a fiction. Maybe it's friction.
But anyway, so what the was I talking about about the Jewel? Yeah. So that pool that we took was very revealing because most of them were going.
I think we have to start dealing a lot more with our Graham out there, right? Not necessarily those go in, but I mean just go in in general.
Because the Jews, I think are like, and I did you leave them and think was right on target. He cost your boy the election there.
He was the chinor in a one pile. He was the difference. That was a disaster. He was today. He was to the Democrats.
What's your a follow up to the Republicans? He was to the Democrats. What Pat Robertson is to the Republicans and Gary Bauer and all of the others are the focus in the right wing.
That's what he represented. He was this this grace. But the fact that I called him Julie, remember which I make no apology for and his wife had a.
And their kids been a breath and whatever the other one was happy poor him. Yeah, that's a. Yeah. What kind of a name is effort? A kid happy poor him.
And then I love the grand daughter, Cox, a hoist. She's my favorite. So we'll find out on our survey today. Me will have some dialogue about this or not as the case maybe because I'm loaded with it today.
I really don't know why, but it's just pouring out. Like I told Gail Bright here before she started the you know snitching about the white lottery leading in Zaz.
I like I told her that day when she was in here when it your full of it. It flows out easy or poor Gail, but she's really getting the take of the heat over there. You know, she didn't you that tape up to the road. No, that's right. I wasn't Gail Bright's fault.
Don't go blame her on channel 10 just because you're still upset about white eating ass. Floridians dumb after.
I was so slow and to get a second time. My things in the swing. Oh man, what a shock before I had to find it right there.
I'm going to get in and talk. Talks has all been fine. It'll shrink in time. Here I am. I last with my thing in the cast in Paris and maintain full of course.
But that's a place of taking a phone like a.
It's not eliminating. Aujourd'ce my.
at 1033 when we had an empty, there was a one single call on the board.
This goes to show you the level of which this audience, our call in our people,
that segment, have sunk. This goes to show you.
Sitting here, again, there's some good food for something to chew on here.
I got some point to chew on and nothing. 56670560,
pound-pot, because this could change my whole approach to the show today.
No, seriously, I like to display that whole cassette.
56670560, pound-pot, 50560 on the AT&T and for Lanzel and wireless line.
The cats got their tongue today.
Now, one single call on this board here on the highly weighted, highly talented.
We got 80 million responses on our website yesterday.
You'd actually think we were on the air, and the markets are moving in the forward.
And in this God forsaken place, they're still in La La Land.
Is anybody ever going to wake you bastards up?
No.
With a crowbar?
No.
With a guy named Nuclear Weapon?
No.
Jesus, K Christ.
Here's that poll again.
Which of Niels comments piss you off the most?
His comments about guns, about Orthodox Jews?
Nice going, Eric.
He's got Jews and italics and underline.
Nice going.
Jus, his comments about Cubans, his comments about religion, about blacks, about politics,
or none of his comments piss me off.
Very good, Eric.
I'm going to put none of his comments piss me off, because I guess...
Because I'm saying them.
And I always agree with everything I say.
Makes sense to me.
Here's a mobile in Hellendale.
Hello.
Nelson.
Yeah.
What's happening, Niel?
What can we do for you, sir?
Hey, couple things.
I'm a local yoke here.
My cousins are here from Toronto.
Yeah.
I got them turned on you.
They're on the beach, listening to you.
I couldn't buy the lease last night, baby.
Anyway.
Listen, I got a funny.
Actually, it's not that funny.
It's another 400-year-old driver person story.
My mom was at Lorenzo's, like a couple weeks ago.
Yeah.
This guy backed out.
Put some of those in Florida.
Clashes into a stop that pushes it into my mom's car.
The guy's like born in 1908.
Is that incredible?
Yeah.
So that only makes sense when I make some 93.
Maybe even 92 if he hadn't his birthday yet.
Yeah, but I mean...
The guy didn't even know what was going on.
It's the land of the walking dead, baby.
You better get used to it.
I mean, I would better...
You better take a while.
Yeah.
Well, then you buy now you should know it.
All right.
Love you, baby.
Okay, go these go.
Yeah, I think he wants to eat pizza pizza.
That's his deal with Toronto.
Just like that old fart that called yesterday.
Remember that one?
And I said something about Aki Bird.
He went to Aki Bird from Iceberg, that guy.
From Iceberg, lettuce.
Hey, I'm outta here.
Okay.
Your rights are there.
Older they're disgusting.
A Fort Lauderdale man was found murdered in his home
over the weekend.
Detectives at the scene found the man face down in his bathtub.
The tub had been filled with milk and corn flakes.
And the banana was sticking out of his ass.
Police suspect a serial killer.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
That was that serial killer.
That was cute.
Hey, um...
I don't get a lot...
Nothing you say bothers me.
If you're really bothered me that much, I wouldn't listen to you.
You're not going to get many responses.
Yeah, but now you're wrong.
You're wrong.
There are a lot of people out there.
In fact, how many times have you heard people call say,
oh, well, I don't always agree with what you say,
as if I expect people to always agree with what I say.
But they listen.
Well, how about that?
Did you have comments against fix there?
Against fix, yeah.
You do?
All right, I'll vote for that.
No, but they're okay.
Not really.
I mean, I got nobody else.
I really don't care.
You know, you have to take me during the day.
I drive around all day long.
In the process, right?
In the process, right.
If I'm really up to go with the fix, but you know, give me a vote.
Are you cute or are you Cuban?
I'm Puerto Rican.
Oh, well, you're okay, because this one just has comments about Cubans.
Oh, okay.
I'm going to show my brother.
How about that?
Okay.
All right, take anything.
I don't really want to.
I don't want to.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8.
Just take a stab at it, pal.
Not a pull.
By the way, the Puerto Ricans were sending them all back, too.
Why would we want to, you know, instead of giving them statehood,
we're just repatriating our Puerto Ricans friends.
Except that guy.
He's okay.
Unless they listen to this show.
If you listen to the show, you can stay here.
If not, you're going back.
So spread the word.
That would be a good scam.
Yeah, we'll announce the halfway house on this show only.
Right.
The safe house.
That is correct.
Oh, and speaking of that, I'm coming past the school zone up there by an Ives-Dairy Road
to work this morning.
And for the first time ever, because I know that's a schwarcher school,
but they had all the kids who were like out in the back like getting ready for gym class
or maybe getting ready to get in the bus for a BTA program, you know.
There wasn't one white kid in that school.
There was not one white kid in that school.
I looked in the back there.
It was like a jungle jam back there.
I'm serious there.
There are no white kids in that school.
Huh.
Here's a mobile and pop it all be chill out.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes sir.
Great.
I'm up here in pop it all be chill in this beautiful.
I think this is the new Miami Beach of South Florida.
It's not a person there underneath the hundred.
Oh, yeah.
Stay away from win more, man.
Oh, my goodness.
Anyway, I just call this to the show.
I just want to thank you for your great entertainment.
And the price is definitely right for me.
Don't agree with everything you say, but that's life.
Well, like what?
Like what is it that I say that you disagree with?
Like about religion, about politics, about whatever?
It doesn't really matter to entertain the meeting.
I'm not going to suck in a solving a great problem.
I mean, like Wayne being an asshole, we can all agree on that.
Well, I agree on that.
That's what I'm saying.
That's a beautiful potmark.
Well, listen, simple little pushback to the guys of Protek and Adir Arvita.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
And have a great life, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Have a wonderful day.
It's a great day in the neighborhood, baby.
The eyes are freaking marks.
That's why it's such a great day.
And be where the hospital queen is.
This is 560 QAF, the first T.
Cut it what you've heard was me.
So I should not be held responsible for any of those statements.
Shut up.
I'm actually...
I'm really alive.
You can do a game, yeah.
Why don't you all wait for a little boy?
Yes, comedy jam records brings the best of deaf comedy jam to video.
It's six hours of undeciferable comedy on three video tapes.
You'll get classic comedy like.
So there's Muffin.
It comes out to me and says, what the f*** is that Muffin?
I show him the Muffin.
Door busted.
Oh, over the Muffin.
And I tell the bitch to stop a Muffin.
Yeah, but I take the Muffin.
Hose is shoved up a Muffin.
And you'll also get the classic suck my jam.
So this Muffin is show me the bill.
I tell them like suck my...
deaf comedy jam, a Muffin for any other video collection.
deaf comedy jam for MF is an adjective.
1043 at 560 WQM.
12 months were about to be ordained.
The final test for the most to line up nude in the garden
while a naked woman danced before them.
Each month had a small bell attached to his penis
and they were told that anyone whose bell rang would not be ordained
because he had not reached a state of spiritual purity.
The naked woman danced before the first month candidate with no reaction.
She proceeded down the line with the same response until she got to the final monk.
As she danced, his bell rang so loudly it fell off and clattered to the ground.
Embarrassed, he stepped forward and bent down to pick up the bell
and he left out the bell's big end to ring.
More of the story, there ain't no fags in the church.
Just dinging rings.
There ain't no fags in the church.
Not bad, thank you.
This is Jack Rosenberg.
You had a cute little story there, the one about the serial killer.
That was okay, Jack, you silly old Jew.
But why don't you put on your poll, your comments about hockey.
You're constantly talking about hockey.
Because I already told you the beginning of the show today, Jack.
We're not discussing hockey anymore, okay?
It took me 25 years, but I finally caught on.
We're not talking about it.
You're the only one I mentioned in your stupid damn facts.
You idiot. You crazy old Jew.
Jack.
Now see, Georgia is surprised by the result on this, but I told you,
I got my thumb on the pulse, I can feel it.
I can feel that pulse beaten.
Which of Neil's comments piss you off the most?
That's our poll on needlerangers.com.
Today, feel free to get on there and diddle away on it.
And the poll too.
Feel free to diddle on our poll today.
55 votes.
None of his comments pissed me off 33.
60%.
His comments about Joe's 8.
What did I tell you?
That's the Leo 10.
As I speak, it's popping up.
His comments about Joe's 10.
His comments about religion 6, about blacks 5, about guns 2, about politics 1.
His comments about Cubans, the big 0.
Do not piss anybody off.
Well, just wait until I get home.
Because the Cubans, uh, that list of the worst, they enjoy them.
And the ones who ate the Cubans, they like it even more.
See, we don't have the orb the toothless crowd.
So the Cubans, they listen to us.
They get it.
They're just as busy as they are.
They don't have the thing to do.
They start up and that's right.
They don't speak it in a language anyway.
567.0560, £560, the Audi AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live.
What did I tell you?
And this, this is comments about Orthodox Jews.
That's what it says.
Maybe that's a good poor for tomorrow since that seems to get the raise the hour of a certain segment of our audience.
What is it that stands out the most about Orthodox Jews?
The, the big hats, the payas that, that long hair, the, uh, black coats.
Or that awful aroma in the middle of July about Orthodoxers or the, uh, Hacidim specifically.
The super Orthodoxy.
Oh, they know what I'm talking about.
They know what I'm talking about, the Hacidim.
I kind of like the fur hockey pucks, and I would like to buy the Hacidim.
See, when you eat a lot of dairy, yeah, we know that they're mostly murchic, the Hacidim.
Because when you eat lots of a lot of dairy, it gets, it enables you to, like, real good.
Then you read the speak-toy-man and Yiddish and Dutch and all of these things.
All of those very gutteral languages.
Some people read the Gutenberg Bible, we read the gutteral Bible.
Here's for a lottery. Hello.
Hey, good morning.
Yes, sir. How you doing?
Okay.
Hey, you know, I got a stockbroker just like your, uh, mid-church.
Every time you cut some, I'm so, yeah.
He makes me feel better.
Listen to what this asshole did to me.
Yeah.
I had, and I'm a small guy.
I had, I had a 401k with $50,000, $51,000.
So I rolled it, I quit my job, I rolled it over to an IRA, and I went with, uh, I could mention a bank of American investment.
So, guy, if I ain't going to mention his name, oh, yeah, we'll take, Kerry, we'll double that money.
We'll double that money.
Now, here it is, not money.
We'll double that money. He's probably we're going to double your money.
I'm down to $35,000.
Yeah.
So I called him, I said, hey, look, get this money out of the, no, no, no, no, John, you got to keep it in there.
No, no, no, no, the market's going to rally back.
So when I call him again, you know, this is happening progressively getting worse.
Yeah.
So now it's down to $30,000.
I said, pull it out, pull it out.
How about the money?
I said, put it in the money market investment.
No, he does that.
Now, this was before the Monday and yesterday's crash.
See, when you met the broker, he already pulled it out.
I don't want to tell you where he stuck it, but he already pulled it out.
I know where he stuck it.
Anyway, so I finally said, pull it out of there, get it out.
And I call him once as well.
I said, how's my money doing?
I've already made money off that interest.
You know, my money started to come back up off the guaranteed interest.
You know what he says now?
John, I think you made a really good decision to take that money and pull it out.
And I'll be, I said, why didn't you tell me this six months ago when I was down to $40,000?
He has no clue.
Yeah.
So you want to do another guess and they can.
Of course, he's like all these talking heads out there on the gambling channel,
who six months in a year ago, they were all saying about, oh, well, the new economy
and it's a whole new deal.
Yeah.
And now all of a sudden, wow, what's wrong with you people?
You should have done your due diligence.
Like Ted David was giving me that crap talking down to me the other day.
Who didn't you do your due diligence and didn't you realize that the PEs were ridiculous and unsustainable?
And Yadi Yadi, say anybody's got hindsight.
I mean, it doesn't take any genius to figure that out.
We've got to call that psychic that the rumors use.
Have you pulled your money out of your...
Of course not.
I can't afford to pull it out.
I'm going to take a $450,000 loss.
You're putting it guaranteed.
If the 5% will bring it back up after a while.
Yeah, right.
Hey, no, I'm not living that long.
Yes, sir.
I think Joe Coral's wife deserves that not on the head.
Okay, good luck, yes, sir.
Three.
Okay, don't be a tempest in a piss pot and whatever it is.
5,670, and they were arguing about him being unable to boil water for TD to see that story.
No, that was the essence of the argument as opposed to the essence of Emel.
So he's too stupid to boil water.
That's basically what you was saying.
And of course, we all know that.
So what's a big cynicism about?
I think he cooked like a good carrot cimus?
No, he's going to bad one.
No, no.
Humans don't know from carrot cimus.
5,670, 560, 05,560 on the AT.
Look at that orthodox Jews.
That's the leading comma.
I told you, they're pissed off about it.
They're not happy with that.
The Yiddler out there, they're very angry.
I don't know why.
And they won't discuss it.
They're in hiding.
They won't discuss these things with me.
I've never had one call about that, have I?
Can you remember any?
During the election.
I think I've got a couple of orthodox about the, like, you leave them in the comment.
But I'm talking about just orthodox Jews in general being the bottom of the barrel, the super orthodoxy, the Haseedim,
the ones that rock it back and forth and throw rocks at the women and each other, etc.
And so on.
Is it a sin to call you or eat trace?
No, not only in the weekend.
And on poorum.
When we're looking for free home enticing, which thank you very much, by the way.
Did we ever find out his pastry lanes still open?
We never fell down.
Well, let's find out.
When quarry minds want to know if anybody in the audience is aware of that joint or that bakery,
which used to be a pretty good place, but if they are still open, I bet you the quality is probably going to weigh down.
Here's a pinecrest.
Niel!
Yes, God!
Speaking.
How are you, sir?
Okay.
I just want to say that the Haseedim are to smell the way H Wayne is to sight.
Yeah, that's very good.
I like that.
Well, originally I wanted to talk to you about hockey, but I guess I missed your caveat.
I know more hockey talk.
Well, you can talk about it.
I said I'm not going to talk about it.
Oh, well, what was they to talk about?
Well, I was just one of you seeing the sun sent in over Michael Russo had talked to a bus driver.
He was a little bit worried about signing Michael Pecker perhaps.
And it sounds like that's a bunch of bulls.
What are you talking about?
It's too late now.
Yeah, but he's got the contract hold out, doesn't it?
I'm bigger part.
Isn't he going to contract hold out?
And they might eventually dump him or now.
It's too late now.
He's going to have a sideline just like Big Eric.
And we're not talking about this.
Big E, huh?
Right.
Well, also while I'm at it, one request or a big request, and actually, I'll come here always picking on the Irish.
I know you shouldn't have them on the pole.
That's a good one.
I should put that on there too, you know.
And they deserve it.
Big time.
What's your beef with them?
Because they're a lot of baloney.
That's their problem.
What's baloney?
I mean, we're like the drinks.
And they're busy killing each other up there in northern Ireland.
We're running around with those orange outfits on.
Yeah, that'd be a good poor question.
Which orange outfits bother you the most?
The one from the whole of his voice?
Or the ones that the Protestants wear on partisan marching days when they walk through the Catholic neighborhoods to piss him off and get the palms going?
Well, happy I had the march and hopefully they don't ask.
Okay, happy St. Paddy's day too.
It's your bottoms up.
So to speak.
Watch out when you say bottoms up.
Correct them.
Especially in that St. Paddy's day, Prairie.
They get really upset about that.
You know what you want to do?
I'm a guy in my gear.
What everyone do you want to do?
If I had a shaykaleen.
Would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me wax my shelling?
Oh, now that I want my patchwork here, is there a beware in the face?
I know there's a smart lassie.
She's made in short her lad is wearing the telegreen protection of leprechaundoms.
Don't be wishing her a holy crowbar.
I'll find her for the gift of gab.
Especially if you plan on kissing some blindy stone.
What have you?
Feed, doffling your protection with leprechaundoms.
They're strong enough for a man.
But I like them too.
So kick yourself a different condom.
And your wolfie kitchen anything else?
Feeling down and blue, I all move up and gold.
Pringles and grunts and nail our chaise.
The pleasantly and looser of chaise.
Oh, that's very cool man.
Hey, is that ground up, Croners?
It's right from the past just with county corks.
Wee, colics, county corks, cannabis.
Hey man, this stuff is great.
Is that a leopard town on the ceiling, man?
Why are you kidding?
I'm there, it's another one.
I'm another one.
I don't know, it's me.
Hey, don't you write man, the brats is proud of him.
I knew it was happening, gold.
It's a crazy, the hell is the critic.
And you also have to wait a little bit more, Donald.
What they're all saying Patrick's Day anyway.
What is the point?
Do we have like a French day?
Some special French holiday?
Do we have like some spit holiday that everybody celebrates here?
And don't tell me I'll sink with them, I would.
That's only like 10 months ago.
I think it's just like a little waning holiday.
Is there like a German holiday besides Passover?
Because otherwise the Irish will riot.
Oh, that's true.
That's true.
You're drunk and riot.
Which they have a lot of practice set.
Practice makes perfect.
Just like stoning people to that.
See this kid with a slingshot, this is payback now.
Here's a mobile in Del Rey.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Pretty good sir.
Your nice popularers who are going here 25th and 1st three week, huh?
No.
I mean, I had to hang up.
But hey, I wanted to congratulate you.
No, that was only one day.
That was only on V-Day.
Was that the day?
Even on that day we had open life.
It's not like he used to be, man.
It's never going to be like that again.
It's a mold hat, you know.
You know, you're still good at the meat though.
I always enjoyed you.
So good head.
And what's the deal with this George Humphie on the summer?
I can't believe they do that.
George is going to be on the summer.
What are you talking about?
All right, well, I thought all the conversations maybe they weren't going to put him on.
I thought he was banging over with him.
I'm not going to put him on.
Do you remember what William Holden said in network when they called him on the phone?
He said, leave him on.
Remember that about Howard Beale?
Leave him on.
You got to leave money.
Yeah.
That's what I told a great way.
He's talking about eating ass.
I said, leave him on.
And that's the end of that.
Yeah, well, about the dancers.
I know when I was talking hockey, but I know I'm not redoing my career.
Good.
That was the best deal.
No interest.
None.
Maybe if anybody was their life's pet, they can tell me how many people were really there.
It was hard to tell on TV.
It looked about 7,000 to me.
But he can't tell.
A lot of empty seats in the lower bowl.
And of course they never showed the upper bowl.
I was at table with eight people at night.
It was three of us trying to give our tickets away.
And it was all takers anyway.
Right, exactly.
Remember a long time ago you said that a flaming guy used to call for a pay phone.
You never had that card.
Yeah.
Have it on card?
We never had that on card.
You mean, P.P. from Pember Fine?
Yeah.
We never had it on card.
Never on card.
No.
It was always great.
He was good for life.
P.P. vanished.
Yeah, he did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hate when that happens.
Yeah, thank you, P.P. Homer, to joke some of the good times over the last 20 years.
It's been great.
Too bad we're going to lose you soon.
But, uh...
What does that mean?
You're going to lose me soon.
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?
I've been there for that many times.
I wouldn't stay here if I could go to Amsterdam and live.
Yeah.
I mean, so, you know...
Three and a half years, you're going to lose me soon.
Hey, 20 years have gone pretty quick.
So three and a half will be gone.
Not cooking up.
Okay, good luck, P.P.
I'll send you a postcard.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
These people sitting here begging for calls every day.
Oh, well, what are we going to do without you?
What are we going to do with your card?
What is their story?
What is their story?
God.
And this big rally that we're having,
it's not even 11 o'clock yet.
Unless you're already kind of like dissipating this big rally
that we're trying to hold up there.
I don't want to talk about that either.
It's due to pressing.
Keep it light.
Keep everybody in a good mood.
Read that promo for clearance again.
Fortress radio 560 W-Q-A-M-I-M-E-Portfolthus.

A smell like a warm bun.
A liquid-up-name.
A smell like a warm bun.
A knot-sapper-shay.
Cool.
In the men section over after all.
I'm gonna sample some new men's break into sound.
A freedom is to put down my new friend.
Now I'm left with the aroma of a freaking fruit.
Oh, warm bun.
It's only one six days.
I feel like the warm bun.
Cool.
Someone hairy.
K, K, K.
Look at all one I want to say it again.
The movie set of a world was a piece of crap.
560-7-0560, 0.560.
I just mentioned that in passing.
0.560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon wireless line 122 votes on our survey.
Which of Niels comments piss me off the most?
None of his comments piss me off 75.
A full 61.5%.
People with a brain.
By the way, we're gonna be doing next week shows all live from Hobart House.
His comments about Orthodox Jews seems to be leading the pack.
21.
That 17.2% are upset the most.
I comment about Orthodox Jews.
His comments about blacks.
Only nine.
Religion nine.
Guns five.
Politics two.
And finally we have one pissed off about my comments about Cuban.
I'm gonna get it.
Local Joey finally got to the other thing.
We had to make the T first.
Here is Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes sir.
Patrick O'Leary.
I'm from the...
Hi voice, Fony voice.
Neil, you know that there's no green beer.
Fony voice Patrick.
Great bad Fony voice.
Neil, do you want to talk about it again in your voice too?
Okay, go where our wax your shillily.
5670560.
Pound 566 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
That sounded like Mad Mike the...
I want to use the Mad Mike Comasterbater from our sales department.
Not Mad Mike the Abol guy.
Here's the mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Well Neil.
Yes sir.
I just wanted to share a Hacitam story with you.
Yes sir.
Now here we go.
Uh huh.
You live in the Lower East Side of Manhattan for about 15 years.
Oh.
It came gentrified.
There's one sect in there.
Well a lot of ladies of the evening.
Yes.
And every night on my way home, I could always be sure to find at least one car road of Hacitam.
They must have been hit a few in girls to see if they can convert them.
Because they'd have girls coming up speaking to them in the window and then getting in the car with them.
Yeah, that must have been it.
They were converting them.
What do you think that they were doing?
They were laying on hands.
But just that other bunch of hypocrites in the religious world.
I think we're having fun.
Well they share that with you.
They were laying to fill in.
They were laying something.
Mm hmm.
Everybody you could find these guys.
Excellent.
Zagazon.
Zagazon.
Okay.
Maybe they were showing here how to doven.
Could be.
So any more rust back in there?
They were rocking.
At least the car was rocking back and forth.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
We got ample open lines.
Your ample opportunity here for you to speak your piece.
All these people I've been upset by my comments about Orthodox Jews.
Where are you?
Are they going to call?
No.
Pussy, pussy, pussy comes to mind to me.
That's what it sounds like to me.
Watch your pussy.
You know, very easy to go there and honestly on our website, which is why it's there.
But they won't because they haven't got the courage of their convictions because they know that I'll reduce them to shreds in about four seconds or less.
With their weak arguments, just like the religion is out there.
They're not going to dick with me anymore because they know they're just wasting their time with all of their archaic bull crap.
See a spark to yesterday.
I'm driving home on County Line Road there.
I see him with a bumper sticker on the back of his car.
It's got a big cross.
It says, JC wants you.
And you know what, brought back to mind?
Back in the IOD days when JC said, I wanted it.
Yeah.
JC wants you.
Well, what's wrong with you crazy people out there?
I mean, if you want to believe in fairy tales, but you have to advertise it on your goddamn bumper over your car.
Talk about intolerant and obnoxious.
It's good they do that.
No, it is not good they do that.
So it is that way you know who they are.
And by the way, every one of those people always does.
There are two groups of people who are the worst drivers, which covers a lot of ground here.
Number one, the ones who have the religious bumper stickers.
And number two, the ones who have the sticker that says,
how is my driving called 1-800-EAT-CRAP?
You know that one.
The worst.
Here's plantation.
Hello.
Hey, I don't paly.
What is it?
I don't paly.
Okay, paly.
Listen, two things.
How about the guys that wear the year, the girls that wear the little bracelet, W-W-W-W-What was the...
Yeah, what was the...
What was Yosuke do you know?
Yosuke.
I also, if I'm locked into a five-year contract with club seats over the Red Decentre over there,
can I cancel it?
Or am I held bound by a contract?
You're asking me like I know I talked to your lawyer, Chomblek.
Sounds like a lawsuit to me.
Well, you know, I went out.
I mean, they took away our players, or taken away everything for this.
But now I went out.
I, you know, three years, and it's just enough already.
Well, Tom, you want a rebate or refund?
You're going to sue their ass.
Right.
Thank you.
Okay, you're welcome.
How do you like that?
Yeah, they're not going to be showing up.
So I hope you guys have a real good time next year.
And those of you, you know, the suckleels, I understand a lot of people over there have to suck hard to keep their job in that organization.
But Jesus, sucking hard doesn't mean you have to put down your ex-friends.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's Miami with the question mark. Hello.
Hi, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
Was I mistaken, or did I hear you say that the mad dog is going to be on for Hank and two today?
That's precisely what I said.
Can you give me a big, all right?
Can I give you a big, all right?
How about a little, what's that?
That's good enough.
Yeah.
What about tomorrow?
Well, how about if I gave you the schedule for a finale, so like, Suckus will be good.
All right, so okay.
That's the thing.
The only thing he'll be on tomorrow, but let me turn the page.
Yeah, give you a, he'll be on tomorrow right from here in the building.
Oh, wow.
How do you like that?
I like that.
Before I said it about that, because we love seeing the mad dog.
Exactly.
At that little hour on the weekend or whatever is not nearly enough.
Also, one smell worse than the Haseedum, and that would be any Irish bar on St. Goisha Pute Day.
Yeah.
Maybe we could get some Haseedum to come to the Irish bars in town.
With some green beer.
Yeah, right.
Okay, thank you.
And not to mention the smell.
Okay, happy tomorrow, Iads of March.
Thank you.
Okay.
Beware the Iads of March.
Beware the hostile fag.
Wow, whatever that goes.
Anybody see the boys in the band lately?
No.
I saw one of them in the hall this morning.
56670560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
Straight from Stockholm, into your home.
Remember that thing I read that one day about the, I got it back here somewhere.
About the quality of life that surveyed all the cities all over the world.
Got, well, the only thing we can comment we got was about Switzerland.
And the people that have bad teeth, that the scene of me is beautiful, but the people suck and they have bad teeth.
Which if you're going to suck, it's not going to have bad teeth, it's dangerous.
And they're not, see the light.
Yeah, not see the light.
In fact, speaking of teeth, you know, probably maybe that's why they were still on all those teeth.
Maybe it wasn't really for the gold.
Maybe they just wanted to, they just wanted to do a replacement.
They just wanted to do a replacement.
Yeah.
That might have been what it was all about.
You think so?
No.
No.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
How are you doing today, Neil?
I'm doing very well, sir.
Great show.
I got a high-speed story if I can.
Yes, sir.
We have some in the family that live out on the beach.
And, you know, they have interesting rules.
You know, this kosher thing with the separate dishes.
Sure.
No bigot of places.
Exactly.
They got like two different kitchens, but, you know, they still eat at Burger King and McDonald's and parbies and stuff.
Yes, especially those feedburgers are a little bit suspect.
If I could talk about a movie.
Especially the Bacon Cheeseburger.
What is it?
I'm sorry.
Do you like outbrook?
Outbrook?
Yeah, he's okay.
Did you ever see the movie defending your life in the Demon Meryl Street?
No.
You should check it out.
It's...
You should check it out, Neil.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
I'll check it out.
Am I going to check it out?
No.
The George says no.
Forget about it.
There's a way better movie.
Always the movie you were telling me that I should see about the stock market there.
Boyler, boyler room.
I was head about our sales department of the stock market.
Both.
Look at this.
Look at this phone.
I mean, it's not even one in 15 yet.
We got one call left on here.
What is with you people today?
What is with you people?
We bring out our grade A product.
We hand it to you absolutely free.
And I'm sitting here like playing with myself here today.
560-7-0560.
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.
Better get this medley call.
It'll be gone when we come back.
Hello.
Neil, guys.
Yes, sir.
You're in.
I wish I was.
You're the only colleague on that.
Listen, I just got a chance to turn you on.
Has anybody brought up what I heard on the news this morning about our...
All the morons out there who put this guy in the office about the clean air act and how he's not going to have the people put this stuff on.
That's yesterday's news.
He's already re-nigged.
Can I say re-nig?
I know it.
Don't step the burger king, jokes.
He's already re-nigged on that campaign pledge about, you know, a carbon dioxide.
He's in the pocket of the big business people.
We knew that.
I mean, it's totally...
Sir, I have three words for you when it comes to the environment.
Okay, and this administration.
Forget about it.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
No, very believable.
Yeah, well, this is true.
I mean, I think...
And what happened with the fact that all the big business people in the stock market and all of them...
They all wanted brooch.
Brooch, I keep asking this question every day including my stock broker who voted for Bush only because if Bush got into markets, we're going to go skyrocketing.
And everything was going to be great and it kind of was going to take off.
And the meantime, we're going to go ahead and then depression.
And he and his vice president were the weak ticker there.
He's talking to China about the recession.
What's that, Rock?
They want to get that tax crop cut through there for the rich.
It's kind of rock.
It's straight down.
See, when they told us Dick Cheney had something to do with the bad ticker, we thought it was his hub.
We didn't realize it was the stock market.
Have a great day, pal.
You too, bro.
Good luck to us.
We needed it.
Yeah, I'm watching that ticker.
I'm not watching them.
I'm watching CNN now.
They got that thing on the bottom.
That's enough for me.
I'm not watching the gambling channel anymore today.
I want to stand in really good mood, which if we get some calls, I'm willing.
If not, I'll still have a handkerchief.
Makes no difference to me.
I get paid one way or the other.
It's just a question whether you want to be a bunch of dead heads.
You want to wake up and sniff it a little bit.
This is 560 QAF.
Test your trivia Saturday mornings in it.
But Toyota of Hollywood trivia channel on Sports Radio 560 QAF.
Get push.
Get a meet this country wonderful.
If you want to enjoy WWE like Gif Tab, when it ported to 14 bomb back dead.
It's to dumb off another bite.
If I share George and make him want to cry.
His eyes when he goes to bed and dreams of the recount make him smile.
If you're better when we hear him say,
The thing will be wonderful someday.
He might promise us everything that don't mean fiddle.
And he's got the training...
To blame that something goes wrong.
Once the threats get to him he'll realize
We intuitively ain't so wonderful.
Now Nline Nline Nline Nline.
Nline Nline Nline, be千 under an egg's dank, I want your vocal mouth out.

so we gave away the uh... leaf tickets right there in the front row for
saturday
to a very knowledgeable young Toronto Maple Leaf fan which i'm very excited
about nice going to your new
these fakers oh i'm really a ranger fan i'm really uh... an asshole whatever
you know
well you people trying to kid
you're not talking to some puts on this radio station window a hockey from a
goddamn slider
here's a mobile implantation
nil
you have to get a ticket to wake up and want to think i was a grubber there
uh...
heartford nineteen eighty two in the heart for it's a bit of walking there the
locker rooms down there
in calls making a delivery turn the corner he's standing in front of me in a
jockstrap but davi keon really
he was short and stocky in every way imaginable
yeah
i guess that's what we are this year for that serving movie hang tenny dog didn't
make the cut
believe you number fourteen with true to its form okay thanks thanks for the
goodness
now let's get back to other stuff here okay we don't want to get to his people
of course we haven't been talking about hockey we just gave a per hockey tickets
it could have been for like shuffle board it could have been for a trip to
a marz anything
so we're talking about hockey you know stuck in the assault and incident that
went back on my plane just like a president the bushmeister went back on
the point about cutting down the carbon dioxide emissions there emitting
it
and smell it
because he's full of crap
this is why we have to go through all this punishment now and i think i
was saying that i thought about people are going to think that i'm crazy
but now the democrats are saying the same thing
the reason that the chainy and the bush they all been talking about recession
about all these problems
and because they've helped to create this mentality this pack mentality
and create this fear and a loathing
which is why there are no buyers out there
and that's why consumer confidence is dropping like a rock because
this is the way they can create enough panic to get their tax cut for the
original
just the way they wanted pristine
i'll take it
you'll take it will take whatever we can get right now
by the way you notice who wrote this story
on his busy is he still talking about that guy whatever he's doing
for you talking to
my mother
you mama
no that really
so anyway elie brecker's the one that wrote the story about the teacher was
fired at the heberal academy for his comments
he was really suspended he was as good as fire this in different
and then he's you know suspended not re-hard fired
what about to
michael lopes calderon
elie bracher wrote that story i noticed there were many letters to the editor
in the uh... paper today in a uh... what is it here i think it's a
here of course
all of which are full of crap i mean i had no the one the one comment i would
agree with
written by pinkis shector who's obviously orthodox
pinkis
p-i-n-c-h-pinkus
but it is true it's as if you imagine the teacher in the catholic school
speaking out against the pope no f-n-a you would not
no way they ought to
well they ought to but they ain't
they could have been keeping their right they could have been keeping their job
are they all
so just uh... you know
telling like george c-sad you know that's not enough to keep your job in
heberal academy
and my question is what they're really doing hiring claim in the first place i
understand it
here's what's in hello
western
how can we stand up either
only got taken away for smoking
here's a mobile in pompano hello
mister uh... yes sir
today
uh... just wanted to come out about uh... game last night
i'm so i'm fine
what's that
i see this when i say we're not going to talk about it
i got you it was so well did you know how well it was in the national
color of the country could be a pop vany remember talking about it sure right
i'm serious
i might just ask the point of time on the thing with game please
all you're talking about the the uh... noise line
yes i thought you're talking about the fans
not only all of them can't be those
it's just a big deal see that that's the substitute for that that's just
another thing they keep doing is to make sure you can't have a good time not
only the quality not there anymore
but the enjoyment factor they just they've drained the light blue out of us
that's i'm asking them please do not
and don't do it on Saturday either because i'm going to be uh... will be
reverting
and have a separate day and you two

were doing their thing and gaby haze and white Rogers and the neo-Rongers and the hoppy and
other guys all those silly old cowboys you know one thing about the cowboys even even back in the
30s and 40s when they filmed all that stuff I guess they were 40s and then of course in the

and I'm thinking why why are you telling me this you know that your favorite color is blue or
whatever the poll is that it's not it's not something to discuss but then I'll put something on
there that you think be a little bit provocative and give people an opportunity to vent a little bit

to get almost 300 votes in two hours to 189 and the Jews the author of us Jews are the ones that

another round of tank and mock affair into refugee camp in Gaza Gaza and two non-Palestinian
workers were shot dead at the Israeli defense forces checkpoints it should come as no surprise

I do
I do
I'm new in structure and twisted by this death man.
And the twist of my life, some girls walk by in.
So I'm new in structure and twisted by this death man.
Pref 14 at 560C, an interest reported rather breathlessly
that panther broadcasted Jeff Rimmer is being treated
for foot and mouth disease after last night's telecast.
560.560 on EAT and T and Verizon wireless line.
Maybe we'll be able next week at this time to be able to play
that big, the new one that's number one with two bullets, the psychic cried.
Here's a mobile in Boca, hello.
Hello?
Yes sir.
Long time looks for a first time caller.
Okay.
I know the Middle East doesn't affect everyone,
but these were spending a lot of money on it in this country.
Ah, flushing it right down the toilet.
That's because we want that arrow of oil.
That's the only reason, sir.
We want that oil.
And votes, too.
What is it?
Is it for votes, you think?
Yeah.
Well, I'm an oil.
And have a great day.
And thank you for never calling us before.
Who is that that just don't put up the door and stuck a push in the door?
Someone holding a ladder.
Somebody holding a ladder is coming in here, ah?
Maybe with Jacob.
I don't think he is anymore.
You think it's Jacob's ladder?
560, 560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line, huh?
Somebody with a ladder just opened the door and looked in here
and is like wandering around in the hallway like, ah, what's going on here?
What is this place?
Chinese laundry, pal.
Oh, there's a question mark on this one here.
Mobile in Miami, hello.
Hello?
Yes sir.
Are you with Neil?
Speaking.
Need to just attend the front page a little bit here.
Fake boys, fake laundry head boys.
That's it.
Fake accent, fake boys.
Yes, fake taxi driver from Toronto.
Hello.
Yes.
I just wanted to find out what happened to the green party and it's President Ralph Smith.
Thank you for reminding me.
What happened with the green wini, ah, history?
The, the, the, the, on vacation or hiding?
He's on vacation, he's in hiding.
In hiding.
And should be.
Ah, I remember, ah, when during the-
In fact, I understand he eloped with Julie Roman as the room where I'm here.
Well, while I remember during the election, he was saying that no matter who comes in the office,
he'd go to hold their feet to the fire.
Uh-huh.
And you never hear from this guy anymore now.
No, because they got hit and they're holding his ass to the fire right now for a screwing up the election.
Very good.
He's got a hot back down.
Have a right, pal.
See, that wasn't the phone boy, the funny boy.
Yeah, no, it was not.
No, that's not the voice I talked to.
No, it was not.
No, it was not.
There was a laundry head.
It was a real funny laundry head.
But it was a good one, though.
It was a good thing.
It was a good thing.
It was a laundry head.
Does that still keep changing from Indian to Arabic?
Well, maybe he's moving west.
Or depending on what kind of Indian, maybe he's moving east.
Maybe he knows the Navar.
Oh!
Indians.
Now, what is that?
Do you know the way to San Jose?
A call from San Jose?
I don't believe that.
Hello.
Yeah, but you can believe it.
Good morning, Neil.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I love when you bang on the aesthetics in the Orthodox Jews.
You know, it's not a big aesthetic.
One of the biggest mistakes I ever made was contributing to the Chabad-Luba Vitch one time,
a donation of services.
Then after that, we get to week the rabbi would come in and tell me how great the needs were for the Hacidom.
You come in and tell how great his needs were?
Yeah, I told him, don't have 11 kids and your needs won't be so great.
That's true, exactly.
The other thing is, I wonder if anybody...
The first thing I do is, I don't know, but once they start banging them out, they would make the Roman Catholics proud.
Well, that's the model of the Hacidom is when a doubt bang them out.
I'll say, because they don't give that uterus a rest.
No.
Has anybody commented on a article that was in the Wall Street?
I'd play that a little bit, but I think we already got fine for that.
What is it?
Article that was in the Wall Street Journal last Friday regarding the resale market of premium sports tickets.
No.
There's a great article in there and a ten-city survey of how many cities premium tickets, court side, ringside are selling below-face value or 50% or less.
Oh, right.
And one broker says the resale market is trying to send a message to the leagues and he hopes they're listening.
Some teams are starting the set-up websites that they can sell under face.
They're allowing...
I'll tell you how desperate it is down here.
Last night, the Miami Heat, because there was a Panther game in the Heat Game on the same night as usually is the case so often because they're idiots.
Last night, they opened up the upper bull which they use that closed off because they can't sell it.
And they offered those tickets to the public for five bucks a pop. How do you like that?
Five bucks, right?
The NBA, it's said in this article, the only place in the NBA where they're getting a premium is court side for the Lakers.
The cops in Seattle in this article say $80 supersonic tickets are going for $10 to $20 on the street.
I love it.
And there are some teams that are starting to think of a concept where they sell you 30 coupons and you go to any game you want rather than to buy 40 and have to jump up.
They sell you a coupon and you get free grape coupon for your expensive wingies, right?
You know, but...
And that's something you guys see that I'm going to give up on the market.
It's all over, sir. It's all over its history.
I've got to give up my shark's tickets. I cannot stand the three commercial breaks.
For again, about $110 that's a bowl. You're splitting music.
To go pay $60 to see the shark's loose, $3 nothing to Nashville last week.
That must have been Centrelating.
That was it. You know, I used to enjoy going to an NHL game no matter what night it was or what I would have done.
You got a hopeless turn out with a bad knee.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, team who they knew what they were getting into with team who and they really gave up a good homegrown guy in Jeff Reeson.
Yeah, and a goalie with a bad shoulder, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I missed Jeff Reeson because he was one of the few guys who would finish off at Jeff Reeson.
Yeah. Well, listen, we don't talk talkie here, sir, because it's a foreign language in the United States.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
How they feel about foreign languages here in South Florida, they get great at it.
I'm sorry. Just keep banging on them, I'll see you later.
Well, freeze it over here. Have a great day, sir.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
And the sharks.
$567.0560.
See, there's a guy I had a call from out of town to rip the house, see him, because the local Jews here,
they're afraid to call on here. They'll recognize the voice that comes to their house.
That's the way they work.
You ever seen this? I'll see them one, run on it on the weekend. I'm Lincoln Road there.
Don't.
Here's a mobile and camera. Hello.
Last week to get some great shows.
But then you start talking about these hot players.
These people are out of the state. See that?
$567.0560.
$560.0560.
We don't talk to old folks. Okay, go back to New York. We hate you like poison.
Everybody in South Florida is like praying that something evil happens, like deep inside your...
You know, you're like a victim.
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
When you went to Daniela, Craig, you had like, did you go to the Big Apple?
No, I don't.
No, we did not.
Oh, because I know you used to like to go there quite, but in the food was great there.
And the prices were not bad.
Well, I want to let you ask you something. What I already said we went to with Chris.
But what did we do to make water restores? Is this like a free plug for the Big Apple?
I haven't eaten the Big Apple out of years.
I haven't eaten anything in a while.
Why would you call a radio show and ask me what... what did we go to the Big Apple?
What were you talking about?
It's our saying that you go to McDonald's, that you go to like steak and shake, that you shake it,
get out of here and eat it.
Are you into it?
And let me ask you, how did you approach the meal? Like with a fork and knife, how do you approach the steak?
How did you attack the buffet?
Yeah, how do you attack the goddamn meal with Chris?
Man.
How do you attack the check when they bring it?
Generally with a credit card.
North Miami, hello.
Very meal.
Yes, sir.
Happy Delay to 26th.
Thank you.
I saved up my credit in nickels before my local hockey team last night.
Took the family to the game.
I hope you had a good time. We're not talking about hockey today.
Yesterday was the day I said here I begged, I pleaded.
I got to took a lot of abuse from the people who hate these discussions like poison.
And I said today that's the end of that.
And like I said, it's the end of that.
The end of that.
This town has no business having a hockey team.
There are no hockey fans here.
There is no interest here. The handful of fans are like from out of town and move from other teams
when the other teams come in here.
Like I'll be going Saturday to move from my team or from Toronto.
And at the end of that, there are no soccer fans here.
There are no got there are bullfight fans here, but we don't have any bull fights.
We got the bullfight part and that's it.
We got Bull Schmidt and Mike Schmidt.
Cut the crap.
It's like this show now is on 24 hour delay.
We've had this happen before.
I'll sit here and like to spew my guts out trying to get some response about something that is timely,
that you know, makes sense on that given day.
And nothing.
Go home with a guy named Mike Green.
Come in the next day.
It's like, oh gee, now we want to talk about it.
Too late. Guess what?
Times up.
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Hello. Yes, sir.
Yes, he'll speaking.
Neil, what do you think of Wayne Zinger?
If Henry went up to him and said, why don't you lease me the concessions for the games in the parking so that we don't have to go to stadium?
Or is it you think you think you're Zinger's going to want more than $300 million to do that?
I don't know. I don't know.
But that's what they ought to be trying to do.
Since they are big meeting in Miami at two o'clock and they're going to give more.
Why should he do that?
That's the way he looks at it.
Sir.
560.560.560 on the 8th.
No, I think his phone got screwed up.
Don't give him a look like that.
I think he was still there or not as a case maybe.
Maybe he was just speechless.
Here's Pompano. Hello.
Hello, Neil. Yes.
I'm having you, baby.
No, okay, good. Stick it up your rectum.
560.560 on the 8th.
Hello.
Yes, can you hear me?
I hear you.
Yeah, because I got a bad shell over here.
Sounds good to me.
Well, I used to live up to northeast.
I used to go to the garden to see the rangers.
Sir, did you hear what I just got through saying?
Well, down here.
Did you hear what I just got through saying, sir?
Yes, sir.
Okay, goodbye.
560.560.560 on the 8th.
And Verizon Marvell's finding nobody cares where you lived before.
Nobody cares that you went to see the rangers.
Nobody gives a crap about a-a-or-engine history, okay?
That's like my sitting here and telling that, yeah.
You know, when I went to Northfield, down,
and it was Lord's Lady coming on the outside with Francis,
so here it went by length and a half over George Davis
and whatever that horse was he had.
The 7th over the 1.
Yeah.
George Davis.
How about Stephen Davis?
How about Charles Conrad?
How about Bobby Huntress?
And Bucky Day?
And Tug Boyd?
And Alex Winger?
And Eddie Cobb?
And Kornama?
Here's Miami.
Hello?
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you?
Great.
Hey, great show.
It is.
It's a tremendous show.
It's unbelievable.
The colors are pathetic.
There are so many quizzlings that I love and I enjoy it.
Maybe instead of getting out free tickets, maybe she got cute tips
that people can clean their ears out.
Or maybe just a lobotomy or feel a lobotomy.
Maybe get a group deal going.
I just got to tell you that I'm not one of those lemmings
that live in Miami.
I do speak my mind and I think this whole thing with the new stadium
is a sham for the taxpayers.
Right.
And maybe somebody should go out and find people in the heads
and get them to realize that, hey, well, they're having a big meeting today
to a clock at the manual Art to Make Community Center 901 South
1st Street in Miami and that's something they're going to give away.
A big parcel lying somewhere in town to John Henry and make everybody
know for that they don't want.
To a clock this afternoon, the manual Art to Make Community Center 901 South
was 1st Street in Miami and anybody who opposes a giveaway to a multi-billionaire
for a stupid guy at the at Bar Park better be there and scream in the y'all and say no.
It's just insane.
It's just insane.
It is insane.
People like I think I get away with some believable.
I've not seen New York, you'd never see something like that get by.
Well, because you got living and proving people.
I'm not going to put up with it.
Yeah, well, the way I was warming up with the bodies are cold.
Exactly.
And they have an X-ray.
And back to you.
Well, put the weather is warm and the bodies are cold, baby.
This is 5.30 QAL.
Wake up.
They've opened up your room.
The stars are the first day of morning footage.
7.09 with Jim Mandage.
Josh Harrow and John Lear.
On Saturday, you'll buy 6.00QAL.
Come on, baby.
Come play with these titties.
You heard a snack, Wells.
Well, now, this crack, Wells.
The new cookie with crack.
Yeah, that's right.
That crazy cookie little mvch wants a fancy table of crack.
The new crack Wells.
And that's double height.
And that's sure to make you higher than a mobile phone type.
And I'll make you lose a lot of weight.
And people won't know you eat in crack Wells when they see that skinny ass muddy of you.
Come on, Mr. Crack Wells.
Cookie man, get in my mother's f**king cookie.
I pay for him, you son of a bitch.
New crack Wells.
Now, so, on Sweet Corners, everywhere.
All right.
Stay on that day while they hysterically won an abridion mad dogman.
It will be here for an Ankit too.
It won't be here.
It'll be out of David Buster's to the 6.00QAL.
6.00QAL.
You got the booster from the signature grand maker wish foundation banquet.
That's a good thing he wasn't there about a year or two ago.
He didn't eat enough of the profits.
But not anymore.
He's the new slim trim and improved orange head to bookshops.
He'll still be ripping Hank, especially out of Hank's and Vegas and can't hear him.
And then he'll be at 10 o'clock.
5.670560.
How's the survey coming?
A lot of both.
387.
Probably getting a lot of bogus votes.
Either that or we get a lot of audience out there, one or the other.
That thing is really climbing up there.
Or maybe some of the AOL people are actually getting through on that thing now.
Do you think that's possible?
No.
Not that cheap outfit AOL.
But they got a great stock.
I hear AOL5 more.
But anyway, 387 votes.
Which of Niels comments piss you off the most?
None of his comments piss me off.
238.
61.4%.
That's pretty good.
No, it's pretty bad, like I said.
Hey, if 61.5% of the people are never pissed off by anything I say, I'd better start doing some other crap.
You know?
Yeah, who have you left out so far?
What the hell?
I'm missing a lot of stuff out there.
Like you white assholes.
You freaking heterosexuals.
You atheist bastards.
Heathen Pricks.
Anyway, his comments about Orthodox Jews 62.
That's certainly leading those categories of the people who do get pissed off and phone them out.
Not to mention, of course, fired up.
Pistops get me fired up when I hear someone say that.
Right.
His comments about Black 27.
His comments about religion 19.
That's because most of our people are heathens out there.
They got enough brains.
Enough brains not to be involved in all those cults.
How come there's that the so-called traditional religion in this country?
Aren't cults.
They're okay.
They're respectable.
And somebody comes along with some bogus bull crap like the guy with a helium and cutting your nuts off.
And that was a cult.
Why is that membership size?
Or like Elrond Hubbub.
Or their size queens is at it.
His comments about religion 19 say that pisses me off the most.
His comments about guns.
18 say, gosh dang it.
Comment about Cubans and comment about politics time.
Bring it up the rear with the 11 of peace.
See we got some people out there.
We got some of your people.
Who the straight heterosexuals you were talking about?
No Cubans.
Oh, no.
Definitely not.
Here's Daniel.
Hello.
Stock analysts are assholes.
Right.
Okay.
I heard over heard one thing.
Hey, you know, this is a little bit of a financial crisis here.
You know what you should do?
You should forget about these days after 400 points dropped.
All right.
You know, you should forget about this whole day and even till mom yesterday.
And just go to the toy store.
Yeah.
And when you go to the toy store just buy a couple of toys, go home and say it's okay.
It's like nothing happened.
If they were smart they would have said you should buy them from e-toys if they're still in business
because they're stocking like nine cents or something.
No, no.
Forget that because probably e-toys when I was going out of business and they know they don't want to give any more bad advice.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah.
So I have to laugh.
I said, you know what?
You're an idiot.
Okay.
Yeah, we know.
All of us who have gotten sucked into this, we ought to go through our shopping at suckers at us.
Who's going to go home and play with their kids after you lost $100,000 in the market?
Right.
Oh, yeah.
I could lose it, no problem.
Right.
Yeah.
Good luck, dude.
Good luck to us, pal.
Yep.
Okay.
Oh, where's my guy named Plant Peridot thing?
Yeah, I like this thing.
Oh, it makes a lot of noise.
Not as much noise as that phone that was screwed up here, like that.
I wonder how that sounded on the year.
But that was loud, huh?
Yeah.
It was great.
Puking and popping that piece of it.
And now I know they fixed it today.
Hey, they're nice going there, George.
Of course.
So I saw his person here for the first time in months.
$56705.60.
$560 on the AT&T line.
Many open lines out there.
I just mentioned that because they know a lot of you have been trying desperately, frantically,
to get in for those hockey tickets.
Here's a mobile in Western.
Hello.
Mobile in Western.
With a bad phone.
I can hear him pushing it.
Hello.
Easy, I can get it.
Okay.
Probably lighten one up.
Here's Kendall.
Hello.
Kendall.
Hey, you all good on.
Okay.
Hold on, I'm twisting it.
I'm yanking it.
You know it's wrong with Goddamn society.
And what is that, sir?
What is wrong with Goddamn society today?
Everybody puts a school shooting on the front page for one or two days.
And the next day I opened the paper on the word about giving this ass hall $180, $1 billion, $1 billion, $1 billion,
freaking stadium.
Start building schools.
Really Goddamn school size.
Need to teach you some more money.
Give the kids more personalized attention.
Help them with their homework.
And they shouldn't have that much of it in the book.
Right.
I got a three year old kid.
I stay up at night and sport again.
Okay.
Excellent job, sir.
Right on.
F and A.
And he says he don't give a shmitter if they ever play a sport game.
He's right.
I talked to more and more people are probably the same thing.
They're just, they don't care about him.
We're ridiculous.
Too much damn money.
Too many demands.
Too many to crappy products.
You know enough.
I don't have that for the station, but we can always play Hungarian in the zirka's anything.
We don't care.
I mean, it'd be bad for Greg's ego, you know, Mr.
Like yesterday, yesterday morning he's in there with the sports nerds in there in the worst team.
Yeah.
Doing his little hoes job with his $50 books for the suit on.
Didn't come by and see us.
Didn't go about once every two months.
He gets good.
Not that we want to see him, of course, but he builds up the courage to come by here like when I'm actually in the studio.
Most days, he waits for about, you know, till my car is safely up the Hershey highway there and I want to wait home.
And about three minutes later comes in here and the little small talk with his good buddy George.
Just to make sure that George don't forget the most important thing about this place.
Greg hates you.
Right.
He said he didn't forget Greg.
He don't forget.
Here's a mobile of high alia.
Hey, Neil, how's it going?
First time college.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil, do you remember a radio personality in the five six, seven, oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line?
Yeah, that was really good.
What do you say?
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
We're in church.
Hey, fuck it.
And I see there was like a little thing in the middle of the thank goodness.
And maybe he put his own little girdle in there.
It was good.
Five six seven, oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
I think you got it back with those sir.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
My buddy, I'm your buddy, I'm your friend, the uncle Mugsy.
Yeah, okay.
But Mugsy is dead and it sounds like so are you sir.
Get out of here.
I told you, no six, something new old people I hear today George.
I'll send you a begging for calls before I want to talk to these old folks.
That's the guy with his Mugsy Salomonist and by the way, pay him the fifty bucks you own.
This is five sixty QAM.
The station giving away tickets because the next four events are far ahead.
This is what for you five sixty QA and three eight you.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Five six seven, oh five sixty on the 18t and Verizon wireless line.
Great. Thank you.
Yeah, we heard you the first time.
1243 at five sixty WQAM.
Here's the lady mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Yes, hi. How are you doing?
Okay.
I was calling. I just turned on the show about 15 minutes ago and I didn't hear anybody talking about it.
But I was wondering, had anyone started analyzing or thinking about the fact that all of these young white boys are the only ones shooting up people in school and why is that?
Well, they got to like even out with all the crimes from those black guys.
You don't like to want to beat up the away twist yesterday in Fort Lauderdale?
Right, but I was talking about the mass shootings in schools.
The only young white boys are doing that and why is that?
I don't know what I said.
It's not a catch up with the crimes statistics with the young black guys.
Right, I'm talking about the mass of shooting in school.
That one in particular.
I don't think this kind of catch up with other people.
I mean, it's just odd that they're the only ones doing that and don't want to have a lot of blood.
Maybe if we have some of black boys, some guns, maybe they'll start doing it.
Well, I mean, I'm sure they have guns or anything, but the point is why is it only them that are doing it?
Is anyone asking why is it that only these young white boys are doing it?
Some of them are the most, that's the 18th time you already said about the young white boys that are doing it?
Right, I'm saying it's like analyzing why is that?
I'm saying seriously though.
Is anyone really analyzing that because it's, you know, it's just getting out of here.
Yeah.
You know, that's what we're going to start analyzing.
After we analyze why all those charges are holding up to 7-11 stores, we're going to, as soon as we get done with that study, we'll start analyzing that one.
Say it again.
Can she say it again?
No.
No.
Hey, everything is racial.
Everything is racial.
Let's see young white boys.
White boys, white boys, white boys, white boys, white boys, white boys.
Always like them white boys.
5-6705-60-560 on the AT&T legal age, of course.
5-660 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's a mobile-informed water deal.
Hello.
Hey, how are you?
Okay, sir.
When I was a parents' collision up, I'm a very young husband, not a, I don't have any kids yet, but I will tell you what the problem is.
Was all the kids in AIDS society?
Was all the kids in AIDS society?
Not just some of them.
Not just whites, but blacks and Hispanics and every, the problem today is the two words.
The kids know all the rights and then all the other things.
Well, wait a minute.
The problem is two words.
The kids know all the rights.
Okay, we're kids' rights and responsibilities if you want me to break it down.
Yeah.
They kids know everything that they're allowed to do and what they're allowed to get away with.
Well, when it comes to responsibilities, their parents don't teach them that.
And therefore, me and my wife are probably never going to have kids because of the way they speak to them.
So, I have filed up these kids.
I tell you.
The school system is filed them up.
Anyone you're actually in choice?
Yeah, and it's increasing this first thing.
Okay, 560, 7.0, 560, 0.560 on the AT&T and we already heard it the first time.
Here's a mobile in Jupiter. Hello.
Hey, Neil, how are you?
Okay, sir.
I got a hate to go on on the same subject, but I used to run a children's bounce house company.
I told him that's why.
I told him that's why.
Thousands of kids.
What children's what?
I used to rent bounce houses.
Those things kids jump around in.
They're air inflated.
Yeah.
And the first thing out of every kid's mouth, which maybe they attitude today or things in general, is you know, you can't touch me.
While they're, you know, punching another kid in the face or jumping on another kid.
And the parents, you know, they just stand back and observe it.
And you know, hope that, you know, that they're told.
I think they do, but it comes down to is that the parents are bad parents today.
Whether it's a generation, the baby boomer is this one, that one, generation X, Y, Z, AA, whatever it is.
Bad parents, bad parenting.
That's what the biggest problem is.
Well, they're because the kids are awesome.
And you know what?
Because we have bad parenting.
That's the greatest case for my program of forced sterilization.
I thought that was a great idea yesterday.
I was thinking about like dropping little uranium pellets in neighborhoods.
Correct them.
Yeah.
Excellent idea.
All right, Neil.
Have a good one.
Thanks, Neil.
That's a good idea.
They're going to stuff them right in your...
Correct them.
All right.
56670560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Marles line.
I'll tell you one thing.
Opinions are like spinkers.
Everybody's got one.
421 votes on our survey.
Which of Neil's comments piss you off the most?
Oh yeah, this one should have been on there.
Great.
That should have been on there too.
None of his comments piss me off.
266, almost 62%.
Because those 62%, no way it's a radio show.
And also have good taste.
And I like real people.
38% are looking for something to get pissed off about.
His comments about Orthodox Jews.
65, 15.2%.
I'm most pissed off on my comments about the Orthodox Jews.
The Hasidim.
The Scum of the Earth.
His comments about blacks.
30, about religion.
22, about guns.
18, about politics.
50, and then about Cubans only.
11.
They're so muslim looking.
Because the Cubans are listening.
They got a good sense of humor.
And they're busy squeezing it anyway, each other.
And the other people, they love the comments about Cubans.
Because they hate them like poison.
So what's not to like?
See, we reached a happy medium.
And we'll be giving out the happy mediums number
on the next Panther Telecom.
Yeah.
Okay, he told me about those psychic readings.
Face stunk.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, do you see about that revolving door at the jail for Lionel Tate?
They're moving them all over the place.
Quickly and all that good stuff.
And I'm taking the solution to this is maybe let his mother
serve his sentence and she made the decision.
Well, if his mother could speak a sentence, it would be good.
That.
They would love this woman in jail.
You know what I mean?
He said the Lord, the Lord, they'll take care of it.
Okay, great.
We'll see if we can't hook you up with her.
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.
And Verizon Wireless Line.
And then as attorney says, he's not too crazy about dealing with
governor Jeb because Jeb, first of all, wants the kid to admit, you know, a guilt.
And this hot shot attorney says, oh, no, I don't want to do that.
That's not a good idea.
So no matter what chance that that kids, you don't understand what everybody is screaming about.
No matter what chance he gets between the mother and the lawyer, it's like they got him nailed to the wall.
Yeah, I'm nailed to a cross.
Not even Easter yet.
Here's Mimey B.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not about what you say about Wayne, I think how you criticize him in the outcome.
Yeah, we don't care.
You don't care.
You took up, you know something.
Let me tell you something about, we took a poor yesterday and everybody knew I said that Wayne Heiseng was an asshole and they agreed to do the same.
That's what they said.
And they said, so are you.
You're the same guy that called the other day sucking his ass.
Okay.
I hope maybe we can fix you up on a date with him.
Okay.
You can suck his it.
Get out of here.
Cross the roof part.
What did I tell you?
Yeah, we like those old people.
5607 0560, 0560 on the 1810 Verizon Wireless Line.
And we'll fix him up on a date with Wayne Typinga.
Here's Mimey.
Hello.
Mimey.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How you doing, Neil?
Very well.
Good.
I'm calling because I hear a lot of the comments and I read the paper about these kids and stuff, me being a former teacher and, you know,
the teachers today are going through a lot of stress in the classroom.
Because the parents suck.
Well, you know, yes and no, you see, you get 30 kids in a classroom and you deal with 30 different types of attitude.
And you can see those kids bring those attitudes from the parents.
Right.
That's what I just said.
And what happens is, is these, you know, we as teachers, me being a formal teacher, you know, you would go and you would say something and, you know, the government and the politics that paint this pretty picture.
But if they wanted to fix what was going on with the teachers and what was going on with all the problems we're having, they would really do something.
Every four years, we hear a president say, I'm going to do this.
I'm going to do this for education.
They don't want to suck.
Well, nobody cares about education in this country.
The politicians have a vested interest in keeping the populace as uneducated as ignorant and preoccupied with crap as they possibly can.
Exactly.
And then, you know, their thing is, well, let's change the system and give these vouchers out.
And let's, you know, what there's a system in place, make it work.
You know, let's not waste all this money on lobbying for all this stuff when, when let's put the, you know, the power into the teachers.
The American government and the American people education is not important here.
It is.
All games are important and, you know, special interest in the rich fat cats.
Those are the important things by education.
That is because those rich fat cats send their kids to private schools and they pay for the education.
They're not getting it for free.
Where a public school, you have to educate everyone.
You know, here you got these EH kids, emotionally handicapped kids, that are throwing things at teachers that are doing things and you're saying,
okay, we know they have a problem, but, you know, you have to back the teacher, a teacher puts his hands on the kids.
He's not going to happen, my friends.
It's not going to happen.
Society has changed the 180 degrees, 600 degrees, 2000 degrees, whatever.
And it's not going to happen.
Yeah. And, you know, you see all these kids on television and you've gone, you know, this girl calling these white boys and this.
You know, it's everybody.
There's a problem in society that, you know, and sometimes you say it's the parents' problem.
But let me tell you, Neil, being a formal teacher, there's a lot of good parents out there that are struggling to make a living.
They're struggling working to jobs to make a living.
Well, you see, before they start making all these babies, they should start thinking about those things.
Or, they can make like I said.
I agree with you 100 percent.
Just like the Chinese, one kid per family, that's enough.
I agree with you. I'm not disagreeing with you at all, but, you know, they are working hard.
I think starting today, any family out there that has more than one child, we start shooting body limbs off.
Okay, first of all, they're not seriously, and then finally decapitation.
I mean, if they just won't stop.
Yeah. I mean, I doubt you did that.
I think you, as, you know, we plan as, you know, even they should maybe offer something in college.
You know, you plan, you know, you're, you know, I want to be this when you grow up. I want to be this when you grow up.
I think they should teach a class in university or in high school about parent who is really good at this.
Yeah, there you go.
You know, I forbid that we teach kids anything that might be useful in life.
You know, like how to write a check or balance a checkbook. Have a great day, pal.
Okay, have a great day.
Good luck to you.
Bye-bye.
If it's free, it's me.
Okay.
5607-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's a mobile in Davie. Hello.
Hello. How are you?
I'm doing great.
Hey, I just wanted to tell you, Neil, I just started listening to your show a couple months ago.
Uh-huh.
And I heard one of your commercials in my wife and I were out driving around a couple of weeks ago and we stopped over and met your buddy and ate a pizza loft.
It was great.
Yes, sir.
And all the kind of guy, he's one of them after they made him, they threw them all the way.
Yeah, when I first went in, he came over and asked to tell many end, smoking or non-smoking.
I thought he was just some guy that worked there and the way he just told us it was the owner.
And then you saw those fingernails and you said, oh my God, we better get out of here.
No, it was the best piece I ever had.
You're good. Good enough.
But also, are you there?
I'm here.
The people calling in about the kids these days, I don't know how old you are.
I just turned 47.
Fifty-eight.
When I was growing up, Neil, we got our ass feet for talking back to our parents and nowadays if you do that, they put parents in jail.
That's right.
I think if we go back to the old ways, you're going to have discipline and respect.
You've got to just like you said, respect. That's what we've been needing.
Yep.
Have a good one.
Well, he's guilty.
Well, he's guilty.
Oh, all right. Let's hear it.
Come on.
Several of the jurors have already said in, you know, we get a jurorialist and they tell you they give you descriptions of who the jurors are.
And I sometimes use quotations that the jurors delivered in front of the lawyers in the proceedings after we started.
And many of the jurors actually said that they thought that Johnny Copping was an excellent lawyer.
So it's very clear that he's being used on some level, maybe as a public relations way.
Ben Grappin is incredibly articulate.
I'm sorry?
I'm sorry.
I think it's an audio problem.
Let me ask you a quick question on Johnny Copping.
Every time I've ever seen Johnny and Copping, he's got people looking for autographs.
Does he get that here at this courthouse?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you very well.
Yeah.
They have a little communication problem.
So let me ask you, George, how come it's all these white kids shooting everybody up?
This is 560 QAF, 420-560 WGQAM Miami Port Lauderdale, a beastly, broadcast group station.
It's a jam, WQAM.com, or the world.
If not just the 1-2 hour, it's a phenomenon.
Pop the gangster rapper straight out of the hood.
Bangin' J. Lowell daily, you know that life was good.
Packin' heat in the mose, worthin' on their raps.
Everyone was living large till someone but the cap's full.
Homey lay their bleeding, took one in the spleen.
Poppy told the driver, it's your gun, they don't seem.
You made the headlines, the front page of the post.
Two packin' biggie would be there if they were not ghosts.
Or a rock in a fur has left you, her big ass is gone away.
Now yours is looking finer to the inmates every day.
Pop the gangster rapper had life by the balls.
Now he's looking at 20 years, staring at the walls, everybody.
Pop the gangster rapper had life by the balls.
Now he's looking at 20 years, staring at the walls.
I thought you were the one I said.
Yeah, I actually believed somebody, that'll teach me.
There's no verdict yet?
Oh, I can't find any like real confirmation.
Or you're probably watching CNN.
About an MSNBC.
The MS?
Well, you should look at half an hour ahead to maybe it's old news by now.
Well, whatever it is, it is, okay?
Jodie Ishell.
All he offered was like 50 grand for the little driver to say was his gun.
I mean, that's not too much.
If I say, look at this, a lot of open lines.
Now what's going on here?
It's a big one, two hour, highly weighted, highly touted from coast to coast.
Pillar to coast.
This is the big stuff here.
And I'm sittin' here, lookin' at myself.
A model in the water daily, Excelo.
Hello, Neil, how you doin'?
Okay, sir.
Free things.
Did you see Vince McMahon nearly killed Bob Costa's last night?
No.
It was hilarious.
What do you mean, nearly killed him?
Bob Costa was asking him pathetic questions.
Yeah.
It took a while, but in the end, Vince McMahon was literally in his face.
Literally, it's hilarious.
Vince McMahon, he's an asshole.
He's an asshole, they deserve each other.
Yeah, and secondly, I'm all for getting the vinegar's back to Africa.
Yeah.
I'm thirdly about your stocks.
Always remember, it could have been a lot worse.
Okay, great.
We're gonna send the Brits back to where they came from.
I think it's a much better idea to do.
560, 505, 60, pound, 560 on the AT&T.
See, we have no patience for the silly Brits because they give me the schmitz.
And stay out of Amsterdam too while you're at it on your silly Brits.
Go somewhere else and act like a bunch of Simpledons, overgrown children.
In fact, come out over to this place, come in a Greg Sandbox, you put right in.
Here's Hollywood, hello.
Hollywood, yes sir.
Hello.
Amy, I just wanted to mention something to you about the gun.
Yeah.
Recently went to Flagstaff, Arizona.
I was out there for about a few days.
Went to a store out there and its name of the store, guns and liquor.
One side you got all your guns, your shotguns, all you need, the other side you got all your liquor.
I'm gonna get a tattoo on that.
Sure.
A Saturday night in the out west.
So that's all I got.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
Be a Frid and Sun.
Look at it, your own disc.
560, 705, 60, pound, 560 on the AT&T.
And for eyes on wireless line.
Sitting back waiting for a little buildup here.
Station.
And found a box with no name on it.
I've been talking about puffing them.
I think you jumped the gun if I can say that.
Well that guy, maybe the problem was a little communication problem because that guy was like,
couldn't hear what they were saying and whatever.
He wanted to get to out of there, I think is what it was.
Mobile in Miami, hello.
And now how you doing?
Okay.
Got four things on it, say real quick.
First the Panthers.
Watch it out, can't let it slide.
How many games have we lost this year in the last three?
That's number two, sir.
Nobody cares.
What's number two?
Okay, number two, the schools.
My kid gets suspended from school for fighting.
Some kid hits him five times before he retaliates.
And they'll be afraid of me.
That he's supposed to go ask the teacher to please stop the kid from hitting them.
That's nice.
Is that nice?
So I always thought I'd make you answer yourself.
But if somebody, you know, the kid is down on the ground kicking and hitting you.
And he starts to get up to retaliate.
And their school board policy is automatic.
Yeah.
No tolerance, which is just another way to cop out by the school.
That's all.
Another cover.
Here's the number three.
I had radio texted.
I'm listening to the news today on Stupid Talk.
One of the reporters giving birth in their car for the fifth kid.
Yeah, I saw that on the news last night.
Some very dark, complicated lady radio news, bitch.
Last time I checked, they paid the reporters crap.
So there's, I mean, nothing against her or nothing.
But five kids.
Yeah.
Enough to know.
Like I said, let's start with fingers and toes, baby.
Let's start removing those limbs right now.
Thanks for the bad news.
You only got to remove one body part.
Yeah, that's right.
For sterilization, baby.
Like I told you, like I'd be saying, all you minorities out there, that's why I have to laugh
about these articles a couple days ago.
Hispanics are numbering blacks.
And all of a sudden, Hispanics, they got a scapegoat anyway called the Pope.
They're brainwashed in making all these damn babies.
And of course, then we got all these, like the article said,
Zillions have come across the board of illegal aliens that are ones of making all these babies.
All these wild hysterical illegal aliens.
Like alien Tito.
Here comes lunch from Atlantic City, substance and good news is Scott didn't come into this.
Oh, thank God.
Thank the Lord.
How low you.
We love you, sir.
God bless you.
We don't even know who the hell you are, but you're not Scott and that's good news.
Don't forget Atlantic City, substance and Hollywood where Ira makes the difference.
Thank you, sir.
God bless America.
And you like that.
I waited on the heat.
Did he just get off the banana boat?
That guy was always history.
What?
What is he like?
Do you make it or something?
That was not.
Just ordinary Schwarzer.
He didn't look ordinary.
He seemed like an ordinary.
No, he looked a little strange.
He looked ordinary.
He got off the ship.
Maybe we made a swap deal.
Maybe we sent them Scott or keep it in this guy.
Sounds like a winner to buy them.
How we said that Scott's out of this world are ought to be.
Stay away Scott.
We can turn you.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live.
See they laugh.
I didn't eat all these early.
Oh, and you know what I forgot the other day.
I forgot to stop by at Pizza Wop when they were doing those cable commercials.
Remember you said after mommy's lunch on Tuesday and it's already Thursday.
Do you really believe I forgot?
No.
Why didn't go home that way?
I could have gone home that way right up university.
Piece of cake.
I made sure I went and sterling all the way out to Flamingo.
You know, you get on Flamingo and it's like wide open six lanes.
You can go like 80 miles an hour on there.
Like a bad out of hell.
Why should I fight all those crazy people on university?
And then it gets all backed up as you get to work 595?
You know, I want to say this right now.
Don't take it personally unless you want to.
In fact, if you do take it personally, then we know it applies to you.
I'll be very generous.
I'll say 50% of you people out there have no business being in a car.
Even as a passenger, much less driving.
50% of you out there, listen to me right now.
Have no business being behind a wheel of a car.
That's very generous.
And like I said, and that's being generous because I'm in a good mood today.
And once you just got here.
Here's a leading four-letter deal.
Hello.
Hi.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I am.
What's up?
What's happening?
Uh-huh.
I'm calling you all the way from Brooklyn.
Yeah.
And my friend's living in our four-letter deal.
Yeah.
What's going on there?
What can we do for you, ma'am?
I said, what's going on?
How's the weather?
565-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T.
And for one reason, Marlowe's one.
I saw it said a lady on there.
And it would be a very disturbing call.
So I got out of the way before the break.
I hate the Irish.
Very becoming down with the Northern Oopunthane Pantise.
I break the fire.
They call it the Irish Hala.
Across the USA.
What do you call it?
What's it this I hear?
The sky and valley.
Who?
There's a bunch of queers again this year who say that Irish too.
Oh God, I love the Irish.
And let's discuss your day.
If the Irish won't be marching upon the thing that is day,
you can be above the bucket of the sun.
Sure, then that's okay.
But they can't be a issue today.
What are our type arenas?
Those emanants as gray.
I've delivered this pronouncement upon the blessed day.
Sure, I live a little bit off.
Heaven fell and nestled in the sea.
What's your going straight to hell of a home of sexuality?
Oh God, I love the Irish.
Let's discuss your day.
Let's preserve the announcement of the blessed day in the place.
You can be a conum of the Adan.
God loves you anyway.
But you can't be Irish today.
Oh L E S E A A N and S L S E A N.
Choose another women's parts I made with.
From development I never get to date with.
L E S P A A N and S E A.
It's a shame that the fame won't come out in March
without lesbian, no way, the just as part of the honor.
Be sure to set just straight.
The piles of the charities that made this country great.
We won't allow them to depend on the wedding of the green.
And when we say up to Irish boys, that is what we mean.
Oh God, love the Irish.
The plot is never been.
It's a perhaps in the precarious.
You've never been sure of it.
You can be seen in Duncan, Ireland, some of the lab at all away.
But you can't be Irish if you're gay.
No, you can't be Irish if you're gay.
No, don't even try to be an Irish if you're gay.
156, 560, W2A.
Lots of open lines here.
What's there one on five?
What is that?
Do it say something to you?
Oh, I don't know.
Okay.
Here's a mobile and boi and beach.
Hello?
Boi and beach.
Hi.
Yeah, okay.
Like I said, some kind of a retard on here.
You can hear that little retound.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, eight.
They're out of material.
The audience is officially out of material.
Mark it down.
The I-D-March, March 15, I-D-March.
Out of material.
O-O-M.
I really feel for me.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hey, how's it going, Neil?
Great.
Who is it?
I want to tell you something that happened to me.
I got pulled over yesterday.
I got to take it.
Off the game you took it, I was speeding.
And then he took my smoke.
But then it drives you for that.
And I was asking if you can hopefully play a smokey joint.
He actually took it.
I'm supposed to believe this story.
He took away your will.
Believe it.
And what he did was he started smoking it.
I was sweating.
I was like, here we go.
He was like, you know, you better split it.
And he was like screaming at me.
And he just didn't say it.
And I was like, wow.
Huh.
Shocking.
Shocking, okay.
Do we believe that?
No.
No.
It was just his way to get me to play this.
That's okay.
It's a good time.
Three minutes to 34 seconds is a matter of fact.
What about long ones?
There's nothing like a long one.
There's nothing better than long ones.
That one.
And if it's long end, that one.
You think it's a jackpot?
No.
Long and fat end wrap.
Big fat belly.
Not too dark, no.
It's no dark.
It's things are possible.
Do not enjoy it daily morning.
Enjoy it just.
I hope to do it the night.
Almost step up.
I hope to do it daily afternoon.
It takes me three days, all right?
I hope to do it.
It's time of the day.
And two inside and four.
I hope to do it.
Three more.
I hope to do it.
And then I close to you more.
Oh, my daddy.
He wants to meet you.
He's a huge heart-working man.
From my mind, he wants to meet you.
He wants to leave as you can.
He's 10, 1 day.
And the day my skin for me is dead.
Welcome.
Heart was good and heart was fine.
First take care of him.
Now I hope to do it when I get up.
Okay.
In the car I hope to do it.
I hope to do it when I see the ideal game.
And at every 10,000 points I smoke to do it.
I hope to do it.
And if I'm up, please.
And two inside and four.
I hope to do it.
Three more.
I hope to do it.
And say that I'm up to more.
慢慢.
y
y
Oh, my daddy wants to meet you.
I knew we all were gay, man.
My mama, she was so beautiful.
She was beautiful even when she passed.
She said, one day, I met their man,
she gave me a day.
Hardwoodwood, and then hardwood find.
She just said, get her hair.
That's why I hope to learn.
Get me money.
Oh!
I hope to learn the right.
I hope to learn, maybe I'll be a good one.
It makes me feel alright.
I hope to learn the time of the day.
Let's do it time.
Whoa!
I hope to learn the way I hope to learn.
And then I hope we won't lose you.
That's what I do.
Oh!
Don't you know, come and focus on the dirt with me in the morning.
Don't you know, come and focus on the dirt with me if he happens to you.
Oh!
Don't you know, every time I'm going to do something,
I'm going to see your homework.
Don't you know, I believe we're going to say that.
Hey!
Don't you know, come and focus on the dirt with me in the morning.
Oh!
That's what I do.
Hey!
Oh!
Once 20 to 560 WQ, I'm on a tremendous Thursday.
Boy, yeah, did I tell you that today that we turned the corner?
Something good was really out of urge you to happen.
You can feel it.
You can smell it.
Can't you smell it?
Maybe it's a garlic on the cold cuts here.
From our good friends of Atlantic City, Southern Hollywood,
where Ira makes the difference.
And that illegal alien they sent over the food.
Good guy, he can stay.
Scott's leaving.
So the good news is, Yo-Kas Stella is in here.
Now, why is that good news?
Because it reminds me that, you know,
we're going to do that thing this summer.
Leave him on.
That was a good line, you know.
Remember?
Wasn't he a great actor?
William Holden.
He's still holding it.
The bottle, that is.
That's why he's dead.
He's holding it.
But anyway, so I suggested last week that the summer,
since Greg has all been out of shape in the South Dakota, you know,
I mean, they invented this deal.
Give me that summer off.
Greg hates you.
And of course, because he's got a personal bug up his ass about George,
because George is a militant, hard-ass little spick.
Who refuses to be part of their click.
See how that rhymes?
See, I can't even fake it if I wanted to.
And of course, Yo, who also is part of our click and is not even a spick,
but nevertheless, because just by girlfriend association,
you know, just hangs around with us and associated with this program.
So that makes him persona non-grata.
So just as a double whammy to get even with Greg being a total asshole
and butt plug and no nothing, we're going to have Joe and the George doing the show
like almost every day all summer.
But a couple of tapes here and there.
Now, now let me ask you something.
And of course, one like I said, one day Joe will sit in here,
and one day George will be in here.
And like they'll be back and forth.
Fourth and back.
They'll be swinging it back and forth, like a swing club.
Like a ball's on approach.
So speaking of that, now what about those tapes that you find?
Remember they were doing the house cleaning and that Jack asked Bob Vermuth
discovered all those tapes, those O'Rio D tapes?
Joe's going to give him a listen and see if there's anything to listen to.
I think there's probably some good stuff on there.
Because that stuff is like late 80s, early 90s.
And it's so old that they won't realize it's old stuff.
Right, you know what I'm talking about?
You're talking about counting chads.
Most people, you know, still remember that.
By the way, speaking of best of tapes,
the very first series that I started producing when I started just putting the good stuff in there,
those are all on that.
Like a whole bunch of hours worth from 1991, I think.
Yeah.
Best of all edited notes.
But you know what the problem is?
Yeah, we know.
Yeah, they're all, they're all, they're all, they mentioned, they're tainted.
They're all loaded up with WIOD.
WIOD?
Oh, I hate that.
Yeah, I keep saying WIOD.
They're all going to be edited.
Yeah.
Well, maybe just put a couple of bleeps in there.
You won't have to add out the whole thing.
Huh?
Or that.
Or that would be good.
A couple of grips.
It would be like a grip here, a little grip here, beware.
So what's the audience think about that idea?
I think it's a magnificent idea.
I do too.
Have George in here.
I mean, you'll both be on here anyway, but one day, Joe will kind of be like in control stirring the ship.
And one other day, you'll be in control.
So what means we'll only be talking about eating ice maybe one day a week.
In roof tapes.
And you're going to have them to take the alternate days.
We'll get Dwight and Lottardale to come in.
Oh!
Because anybody can talk about eating ice on a radio, but to have Dwight and he were actually doing it, that would be great.
Yeah.
We'll have, we'll call up Sandy, have her bring an ends body once a week.
And Dwight and Lottardale from Channel 10 will come in here and, you know,
get his legs on Route 66.
I think we got a waiting format put together.
I think it's going to be scintillating.
Here's Miami. Hello.
Hey, Neil. How are you?
Great.
Good, good.
I'm here to teach you the subject, you know, about the kids going nuts with the teachers in the school.
You know, I'm a, I'm a Julio.
See?
Been living in this town all my life and I got to tell you the, the mere, you know, fear of, you know, of coming home after doing something disruptive work.
Whatever.
It was greater than having to, you know, to face a shop or for, absolutely.
You know, I mean, I mean, coming home with, with an F on your report card was, you know, meant your death to, you know, much less public on somebody or stick somebody up or, or whatnot.
Right.
And it's just amazing, you know, being in, you know, it is the parents fault, you know, parents do need to be involved and then you need to take responsibility for the action of their kids.
But, you know, a lot of the times this is what they see at home, you know.
They, you know, they see all this nonsense at home. So it's, it's okay to them. It's not a big deal.
And that's pretty much how I feel about that.
Well, I can't imagine being a teacher. I mean, all these idiots that call in about the teachers are overpaid and they're crappy and they're, well, what kind of a person would really want to be a teacher?
I mean, in this kind of an environment where 95% of the parents, no matter what other kids do, they'll take the kids side and the teachers, you know, are bunch of scumbuckets and all of this other crap.
Who now wants to, you know, for a crappy paying job like that? Who needs it?
Yeah, I agree 110%.
You know, it's hard enough to have it put up with a degree from one irresponsible couple's of kids, but have to take 30 in a class at the same time.
In passing, Neil, can I call somebody douchebag?
Yes, sir.
Well, if daddy, you are a J-Lo old used douchebag.
Okay. Thanks, see you. See now, nearly I don't do that, but I knew he was going to have a good one because he was a good guy.
One of my people, 5.6705.60, £560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live.
He was one of my people. He was a, yeah, something.
That's because he said he was a Julio. That's my people. So anyway, if WIOD, oh, I hate that stage.
We got this boy right here.
4.560, £560, £8M.
This is the Neil Roger show.
This is your brain. Any question?
You don't know me, can you?
I'm a showroom.
It's Neil.
If you can, come around.
I am a rich girl.
She's a little home.
I am a TV.
I want to be a TV show.
I am a regular for me.
If you can, I'm somebody from that same place.
Please, baby.
Please, baby.
No!
The little children's right ahead.
Stand at the TV.
Oh, there we go.
But it's a lovely live TV.
Stand at the TV, my angel.
Oh, no.
Don't stop, but come on in, now.
I don't think we can live in a showroom, baby.
There's no time, you're the scushing.
Stand at the TV, because I'm a blue man.
Stand at the TV.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Stand at the TV, my angel.
Ready or...
Well, you know, life's on the stove.
And all of them are the little children.
And they have to feel proud of your rights.
Just to give you the ready to confuse.
Stand at the TV.
Still good.
Oh, no.
It's lovely live TV.
Stand at the TV, my angel.
Stand at the TV.
How long is it to live for?
Three, two, one.
Stand at the TV.
Oh, no.
Come on.
West, W-I-M-Z.
Stand at the TV, my angel.
You.
All right.
Okay, there you go.
Living in the past again.
But we had a lot of good stuff last couple of weeks.
That's 25th anniversary in all these oldies.
And these tapes that stand brought in.
Give me those other tape stands.
Slide them onto the door.
56670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's a lady mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Sammy.
That's you.
Hi, you.
How you doing?
Great, great.
Just want to say congratulations on your 25 years of service.
Thank you.
And I just want to let you know something the other day,
which I didn't have a phone number so I couldn't call back then.
But it'll fit right into your topic.
I picked up my daughter at the middle school.
And this guy behind me also picked up his kid at this old man.
And then he tried to race me out the driveway going across the sidewalk.
And as he went in front of me, he just hit my whole bumper.
Nice.
And great.
Knocked off his rear view mirror.
I'm inside the mirror.
Oh, yes.
And so I get out and he barks at me a little bit.
And I ask him about three times for his insurance card.
And he just went back in the car and bark.
So, yeah.
You just took off.
You get his license number.
Yes, I did.
I stood right behind his car and grabbed my cell phone and I called the cop.
Great.
And so he's just teaching his kids.
And this is why.
This is happening.
Exactly like what everyone's been saying.
It all stems from the parents.
Well, I'm going to organize your group.
We're going to start rounding these idiots up.
Yeah, we're going to have a big round up this weekend.
Now, you'll see.
We're going to round these idiots up.
Oh, and I thought you'd get a kick out of this.
My dad's a telly.
And he came over back in the 60s.
He's retired now as a civil engineer and he designed a lot of bridges and roads.
And he was raised back in Italy with the nuns and the Catholic church.
Right.
And he told me he says, you know what, Susan?
I've never seen a Bible until I came to America.
Exactly.
Very well said.
Right off.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Bye-bye, thanks.
Thanks for all that insurance money in one place.
How do you like that?
Never saw a Bible until it came here and you go all over the world.
Well, not all over the world.
At least all over Europe.
92% of the Italy.
Do they, do they, do they, do they go to church?
No.
No.
They give the Pope the Bafan Guru up to you, okay?
They take off the silly dress.
And you go to the Vatican, which I don't, but I mean, if you do, you'll see all those tourists out there.
All tourists, all those crowds, tourists, 99% and of the 99% about 90% Americans.
This is one of the very few countries left on the face of the earth where we have this religious insanity.
You go to almost any country in Western Europe and you say, you believe in God and they'll say,
how about hell and heaven?
And they'll say, come on, let's go have a beer and then we'll get laid, you know, something like that.
Let's go smoke a number.
Anything. Let's go have a good time.
And here, because it's such big business, see, here we're going to have a business over there,
even though the Vatican is right there in Rome, that's only the seat of the business.
The people right around there, they're on to them.
But they conduct all of their worldwide business out of there. It's their worldwide headquarters.
But, you know, those people, you see, that should have been another category I put on.
What do I say that pisses you off the most when I knock the U.S.?
See, that probably piss a lot of people off to it.
Oh, you know, like Amsterdam, that's a crappy place and they're all on the heroin.
Yeah, right. It's very backward. Yeah, it is.
It's good to be backward. Good to walk a lot.
I mean, would you rather walk a lot or get shot a lot or see boobs a lot?
And of course, you see boobs a lot over there too, right in the windows.
I was telling Hank the other day, I told him that he's thinking about going with Lindsey,
they're going to send him to Wilburden and Royal Ascot, I guess he has pants and a moisture not sent on him.
No. Not this place.
In June. And he said, well, when you leave, when you're going to be over there, and I told him,
and he said, maybe we'll get together over there.
And I said, well, I'll show you the areas. There's a place in the red light district. I swear to you.
I told you this before.
Never, I never saw this, unless they're maybe like brought in new shipment.
Right now, where your fat friend lives, by the way.
The one that can't get laid.
But anyway, Hank, I'm sure we'll take advantage.
And you never, I just am speechless, the most beautiful, young, shapely, attractive,
voluptuous blonde, not all blonde, but most of them are.
You have ever seen.
If I were of that persuasion, I don't think I would ever come back.
Seriously, you just have to see it to believe it.
But I'll show you a good friend, probably, you know, by even Crystal Plain ticket,
put you up in the apartment, and then you can check it out for your soul.
Here's West Palm Beach. Hello.
Hi, Neil. You're a riot today.
I am, yeah. You are cranking me up.
I'm full of it today.
Once I'm a herd, you say that it cost you 1,700 rounds trip.
I'd imagine you're flying first class or a car.
I'm martinier, that is correct. Right.
What is it for the normal celebrity flyover?
I think it's like 6,700 in coach.
And did you say 400 kids row pedally one time?
Yeah, well, they have specials, you know.
I remember maybe it is less than those.
I don't know. I'm just guessing what.
Not bad.
Now, martiniers are a good airline.
And that black lady earlier that was saying about the white boys.
Yeah, the white boy, about 85 times.
What is it?
They're all with the white boys.
I think she's a little tipsy.
Yeah, it could be.
All right. Well, you have a nice day.
And you too. Thank you.
Bye-bye. Maybe she's going to call back and tell us
that we're all a good white boys.
We're hanging out.
All the ones are legal age, of course.
5,6705, 60, 0.560 on the AT&T in reverse.
She went a black person commits a crime.
Oh, it's a racist thing.
All those white racists then are getting framed.
And OJ and...
Yeah.
But all of a sudden,
when a whole bunch of crimes get committed like, you know,
mansion and Bundy and all these white serial killers,
like that serial killing four-letter with a banana and his ass,
then how come all these white folks be doing this?
White folks be doing this?
And of course, they're all guilty, right?
Yeah.
You know that.
Because like Johnny Cochrane said,
Church rejects challenge to gay commitment, right?
How do you like that?
A pesbiterian clergy proposal to ban
pesbiterian clergy from officiating
commitment ceremonies for gay couples
was defeated in a vote-tale released Wednesday.
How do you like that?
Should we even the pesbiterians
are finally coming to the enlightened age?
And wait till you hear this.
The proposal was a conservative bid to overturn a policy established
by the Venomination High School in New Orleans last May.
The ruling had to do with a gay commitment ceremony
at a church in Dodd-Sferry, New York.
Yeah.
I wonder which one put the ferry in Dodd-Sferry.
21 before 2 at 5.60 QAM.
Me on God.
New on the WWE.
It's the Ramsey's every Saturday night at 8.
Join mom, wacky dad, and grandpa.
Working overtime in the sports receiver in the basement.
Don't put on that lipstick and get ready for the patches.
You're unlady.
It's just a bill loud.
The Ramsey's Saturday night at 8.
144 at 5.50.
That would be 2.
I don't forget for the one last reminder,
a big meeting today.
Today's D-Day for John Henry, early supposedly.
Miami City commissioners are likely to choose a site along the Miami
River for New Ball Park for the Marums,
what it says today when they take up a horny and thorny issue at a special meeting today.
Open to the public.
Meeting starts in 16 minutes at 2 o'clock.
Manual RT-Mate community center 901 South First Street in Miami.
Be there and just say, no.
The John Henry.
Tell him, you must be crazy, you must be nuts.
We all know there's going to be a baseball strike.
We all know that there's all this other money that they can't come up with
and the governor wants all these cut facts.
And yet the other day they're saying, oh yeah, $129 million tax.
Re-bade.
No problem.
Sales tax.
Somewhere along the line, something smells real fishy along the riverfront.
But anyway, meeting ends at 2 o'clock and then we'll hold our breath.
Look at that 499 votes already on our poll today.
Next one.
Let me hear everything.
I've had 500.
I'm reloading it.
Like I said, it's still $499.
Which of NEO's comments piss you off the most?
None of his comments piss me off $326.
65.3%.
Two turrets of this audience are not pissed off by anything that I say.
Now when we get to George, his comments about orthodox, what?
Oh, your anti-Semitic comments.
So probably get a lot of Jews upset.
Although I got the Jews upset too, see?
His comments about orthodox Jews.
Those are the ones that pissed the most people off.
66.13.2% are most pissed off by the things I say.
If I had one call about it, is anybody refuted any of the things that I've said?
No.
No, they're untrue.
Oh, no.
So, you know, I mean, tough to do.
His comments about blacks 32, about religion 26, about guns 20, politics 17, and about Cubans
only 11.
Same 11's been there for like 10.
That's right, because that's the only 11 that are pissed off and fired up about it.
Here's Miami.
Hello?
Miami?
NEO.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Good, sir.
What about this white lottery, man?
Did you see who's happy as picking Schmick yesterday?
About.
With the Corroyo picture.
No, I didn't see that.
You didn't see the picture?
He was in the picture with your Corroyo?
No, but his wife sure didn't look like she got here with cardboard, if you know what I mean.
You know, the cop after what started this whole mess.
You know, she said she disobeyed him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought that's what my chief was about.
The thing in the water in the paper this morning said she made some cross-decomit about how
he couldn't boil water or something like that.
Well, water or shoot the, you know what?
Yeah.
Whatever it was, like that's the other good.
Shoot the old, you got it.
Okay, well, I'm going to shut out.
Yes, sir.
Shut out, Miami, apply it.
Okay.
What's happening?
Okay.
I'll arrive in there, Chief.
Bye-bye.
Ciao.
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Well, here's the spot where that little girl he's trying to teach you to play tennis because
he lost all his money in the market.
Free to charge him next.
Don't be afraid to charge him.
Come on, better teach her a lot faster.
Okay, because the rest of us are going to want to split up.
All right.
Well, prize money she's going to be winning.
Here's Virginia B.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon.
Wayne, it's Tarnay.
Hey, I'm one of your short-tillistmas.
All right.
You don't sound like no sports here.
That's what I've been told all my life.
Huh.
You sound like, hey, I whiteboarded me.
Hey.
I'm not upset by anything that you say.
Damn it.
And all you block folks down there all over the Internet, wherever you're listening, get a
life.
Okay.
Please.
Okay.
Okay.
Have a great day, pal.
Thank you.
She is.
How do you like that?
He claims to be a darkie.
Yeah, he's not like he might have been.
You know, he's got a little black in him.
567-0560, 05-60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Jim Manditch.
The Mad Dog will be here at 2 o'clock here from David Buster's for Hank who's out in Vegas.
Pungent.
Everybody's getting the Vegas.
Joe Castell just came back from Vegas.
One money.
Not a lot, but one's the money out there.
See, money and me, we're just, uh, and all those people, all you're making too much of my wealth.
The damn good thing I am making too much money because money and me, they're just not a good matchup, you know.
This seems to like move off in all directions, you know.
Paying for other people's car payments, George.
I mean, stuff like that, you know.
Yeah.
Loosing my ass in a stock market.
Although I did make it and I was, yeah, totally.
Monday night.
See, with me, I had like two great years at the racetrack.
1969, 1968, 97, around two or three years.
Couldn't lose.
Hazel Park, Northfield, down.
I mean, just every stink and race.
Willard Niles.
Anyway, now that's not mentioned.
No, it's harness drivers again.
Did you remember Cassie took it out?
Willard Niles.
No, Howard Niles, Lord Doerl.
There it comes.
Hit him again.
Red Ross, Dead Heat, Sandy Sox, and Lord Doerl.
I bet you're not too many people can tell you that story.
They had the, there was a dead heat in a race at Northfield Downs.
And I had two dollars to win on both horses that finished dead heat.
Board Doerl driven by Howard Niles.
And I ran the Sandy Sox driven by Red Ross.
I was about to say.
Yeah.
Probably you didn't.
I do remember.
That incredible.
But anyway, so to make a long story short.
Now the thing of the track is, once in a while I have a decent night.
But I usually start out losing my ass and then try to make it come back.
So if I break close to breaking even, then it's like, hey, I feel like I want a million.
So Monday I'm losing my ass.
I go home losing only two dollars and fifty cents.
I feel like I just want a fortune.
I'm in the car going home.
I say, hey, that was a lot better than Mitterish.
Anything.
Because at least I got most of it back.
Here's Pember Park.
Hello.
How are you doing, Niles?
Pretty good, sir.
I get a couple of things.
I want to not rely on each other.
But one, I love a happy audience when they love you when you give them something out for free.
Oh, yeah.
They do anything.
Boy, nice and polite.
No bad words.
And then as soon as you say, no more free stuff, they just click.
They be burnt back to form, right?
A little bit on kids.
I have four children, very old ages.
And it's funny how everybody wants to blame everything but the parents.
And like, when I come home from work and stuff, all the parents let the kids out,
just roam in the street, they come and come in the house and they just, no, I ain't going to do that.
They swear and holler at the parents.
And they don't discipline them at all.
It's like people that love their dogs, I was talking about that the other day about their dog.
I saw you run over.
Same kind of thing, same concept.
Correct.
That's responsible.
In schools, you know, like I said, I got four kids.
Two of them got a private school and one's in a public school.
And the difference in the schools are unreal.
Two of my youngest ones go to Nova.
And the teachers, of course, now they get paid a lot more money.
But it's just unbelievable.
You go pick your kids up.
There's no cars trying to smash in there and stuff like that.
And then my oldest one goes to public school.
It's unreal when you go to the kids.
They're so rude and the security staff, they have it.
School's unbelievable.
And just...
The jungle man.
It's awful.
But on your pole, I love everything you do.
I love listening to your show.
And I got to...
And God bless America.
Have a good one.
You two, thanks.
Bye bye.
There you go.
We're praying for each other, him and me.
Praying for the kids.
Praying for the kids with a crappy parents out there.
With a crappy drivers we got out there.
Like Donald Brainerd.
This is 560 QAL.
The first.
Wow.
A sports radio 560 QAL.
Hey asshole.
This weekend, DreamWorks Pictures presents a timeless love story.
Between the two richest, shallowest actors in Hollywood,
Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt star in the Mexican.
Julia, Julia, Julia, me taco.
Julia, Julia, me taco, me taco.
The Mexican.
And coming soon from DreamWorks, the Chinaman.
I'm the native American.
And the Frenchman.
We, maybe that's you.
156.
560 of an aqm.
See sometimes you have to wait until the bitter end.
And it turns out to be well worth the effort.
That's what Brad Pitt said.
Wait until the bitter end.
Gord Scord.
I'd be worthwhile.
What was the name of that movie where he was like a high school punk
and he was in the track team and his brother was like Rick Schroeder.
Come on, you knew this one time.
I'm about to talk about it all the time.
Yeah, that was when Brad Pitt really looked like something.
He actually, he looks pretty good.
They show it every five minutes.
You'd watch it during the show.
That was.
Wow.
Anyway, where the hell are we going?
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Meal.
Yes, sir.
You sitting right in there, yes.
Thanks.
You want to talk to you?
Hello?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, you hung up.
You just taken a survey.
Oh, I see the survey said.
Yeah, he's there.
Joe's in there.
I'm here.
Maybe that's the family way down the hallway.
567.0560.560 on an AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Got a lot of material.
Let's see, clever or what?
No.
Not too good.
Pretty weak, pal.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Is this Neal?
Yes, it is.
Okay, Neal.
How you doing?
I'm doing good.
Okay.
I'm just a whole year.
I just came from here a little over nine years ago.
Yes.
And I got two issues that I wanted to talk to you about.
One of them is the little kids you're talking about.
The school, the children, the children, and all that.
Right.
Okay, I can tell you that there's a product of too much democracy
that's what happened this country.
And all the problems.
So, like maybe a little communism might be going to take a little fascism.
It might be even better.
Is that what you're saying, sir?
No, I don't know.
I'm not a communist because obviously I just came on a little inner tube.
I hated that country.
Let me ask you this question.
Sir, let me ask you this question.
How come, like, in the Western European countries,
where they got out of the market?
