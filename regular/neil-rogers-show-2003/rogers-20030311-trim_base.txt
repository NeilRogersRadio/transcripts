But the raft come in yeah, it was gonna deport him. Oh, he actually took him back down to the raft to long drive to the keys
you know and
They're doing a little whitewater rafting this weekend
And so he comes in like just before 9 o'clock and we got eight million bedtime stories on there

No, there's a more Albert more Albert. Oh my god. I wanted somebody else to say that. That's one everybody like
Mox did you know? Oh, it's just grotesque they killed it. Yeah, they butchered it. Well, I wasn't that good in the first place
Right also the mode comment is the problem with him is he thinks is he's the ultimate authority on everything
Mm-hmm. That's awful. In other words, he talks down to the audience is what you're saying exactly. Thank you, sir
I think he had a stomach on it don't you he's a little bit condescending
You know, I'm saying a little bit condescending maybe he ought to lighten up just a little bit not be quite so goddamn
My dogmatic about everything if you hear my grip. Oh, okay
Feelings by Morris Albert boy. Look at took us a long time on our and plus to give that one that came to my mind
But wow that's gonna give Debbie Boone and you let up my life a real round and now this is one we will put this on our love
Okay, because we were already battered mo pretty good
Ha ha ha ha ha
Breaded and battered. Hey listen. Why let me say this mo
You can't you can't point it. I only wish that the other people on a radio station would talk about me and about this show as much as we talk about him
Okay, believe me once in a great while. I mean tank does fairly regular in fact
Hank even talked about the the city's pool we did last week remember that the one day
Yeah, and the mad dog he picked up on the the one about the hot looking chicks and he said all grace Kelly
Too pristine looking for me, you know, what is that all about? I don't know is there such a thing?
I don't know that's it. Yeah, he likes to slurp. I mean Brittany's a slut, but she's pristine looking yeah
So you don't have to be like slutty looking but I guess if anybody likes red of on brown
I mean what is there's another reason he might not like Grace Kelly and what's that I'm a homo
I know not Hank didn't say that mad dog. Oh, I'm sorry Jesus. Oh, yeah
I'm walking out I am walking out ladies and gentlemen. I'm leaving
What are you trying to do here today you just just

We have something
We must we haven't saying everything else we haven't say every other guy did I hear it is way man
Like naked guy there. There you go. That's man. It's junior. That's not the real one. It's Scotty Mac

Grotesque silly straw that somebody laid on your head like a straw hat
Charlie's been doing it for the famous and then also famous for were 25 years because his system is affordable and if you mention the
Arigis when you call him not an extra 200 bucks off the already low price

The one-dimensional stations for making songs even more annoying than they really are
In other words a lot of these songs if you just heard them a few times
It's just another song, you know, I'm sure take it or leave it
Like Blue Velvet by Bobbi and Vincent. I can leave it. Mm-hmm blue velvet. There's nobody plays that anymore. Thank god

Oh my god, so I have to make you want to go down and blow up the whole island
Yeah, yeah, in fact, why don't they test those I shouldn't say that that's bad
We got a lot of listeners over there in the islands, but they are gonna be dropping a gigantic bomb
And it will not be a test
Do that a Puerto Rico. What do you people in the Bahamas payback is a bitch?
That's right ripping off all the Americans treat us like crap
Taking all of our harder and money and just gouging the crap out of the American public
Just because we live in the antithol state where we can't have gambling the way we like
But you're looting. Oh, there's being a lunatic. There's public for it. I said earlier
Punishment's worse than death. Yeah
hahaha
Oh, that was excellent. That was almost
Not quite but it was almost as good as amtrak
567 05 60 pound 5 60 we're getting to the end on this first pole here
You know, I'm thinking maybe we ought to start doing this every day
Do like kind of a programming oriented
Topical yom sand yeah like a current the kind of a thing
Like who do we despise today the most kind of a pull and then like build on the other one right
And this seems to be in spite of the pull we took last week when they said they hated this like poison
At least it lilylis it's a phenomenal response
That's all we care about we don't care if listeners are like plucking her eyeballs out with her fingers
We don't care about that do we know
We want to make it like nice and easy. We want to do a cop out like that bitch says. It's a cop out
It's uh, you know, we're too lazy to do the other stuff
Is not what it is well, it'd be nice if we got some real calls that said something but
Right so what's the point what's the point of beating our heads against the brick-friccad wall try to change the world
Which we're not gonna do when we're talking to a bunch of people that don't want that in the first place
They could listen to Randy. She's gonna save the world
There you go. Are they gonna listen to lardass? He's gonna make up a bunch of right-wing crap
When I'm interested. Oh, I look at this. Moe is doing such a nice job here toward the end as he's cutting it down under
37% now 36.6% saying it is after the worst
He started out like almost 40% and he's brought that number down to a very disrespectable 36.6% out of 443 votes
Do you realize that we're gonna come close and I kind of do it by 11?
We're gonna come close to 500 votes in two hours and then an hour and 40 minutes
Aren't you shocked yet?
I'm amazed at the power of Moe if he could get numbers as big as this
We really have something going on in this station
Only got seven minutes to go on the mole pool. So you better get with it. Okay. I need your Raju's dot com hop on it
Here's a call from beautiful West Palm Beach. Oh

All right. Love you and George played off each other. Thank you. I say loves when we play with each other
Well, I think anybody knew I'm doing that right. See what am I looking for Michael Bolton? I can't make you puke like that bit
We played a pick oh, yeah, so many I know what was the one that he ripped off? I'm sorry. What was one of the ones that he ripped off sitting on the back of the bay? No
How am I supposed to live without you that was number one? Oh
Love is a wonderful thing when a man loves a woman
stole that from Percy Slate. I never gave him credit either time love and tennis lovers of wire said that George on my mind
He stole everybody go the distance. I would go to live without you. I think is the king of all okay
And with number one for three weeks and they played it 70 times on the coast
I'm a link coast catterwalling
catterwalling

Under this terrible tyrant we're going to liberate them from life. Right. We're gonna liberate them from all that reading all that
Istele air
Then we're gonna liberate all the people in Cuba and Iran and North Korea and in Sudan and Libya and Syria and
Egypt and Saudi Arabia and all these other grotesque places where people you know the amazing
Stalin who killed millions of his own people who had the biggest arsenal of nuclear weapons anybody in the world besides us
And somehow we managed the the cold war you know that went on for years and years somehow we managed to stay alive
We didn't have to fight any war we didn't have to like challenge do like a showdown
I mean we didn't have the showdown finally, you know it was after Stalin
We had the showdown with the Ruskies with like Kennedy, you know blinked him in the eye and they turned back right
But other than that we didn't have any wars over any of it in this
So if it's got to be weapons of mass destruction. I hate to break the news. Yeah 9-11 is just an excuse for this bull crap. Okay
Iraq doesn't represent any threat to us whatsoever none zero. Look at my count my fingers. I'm holding up a big oh
Okay, it's like a
What isn't it ironic that the evil Ruskies are the voice of reason right now? Yeah, isn't that something of course
They like the oil trade they got with the right or that's the side of the point. So does the other one oil? So does it like the oil trade that he's gonna get

I hate to be out of place
But I can't stand your face
I just can't look at you while I'm trying to sing this song
Can I have to level with you as well
Looking at you let me say you look like hell
Whatever you've been snorting or dropping just
Just saying lines
You think I've been waiting a long time
To sing a song with you better think twice
Smells like you had a shower in three damn nights
Can we put this thing in a way
All I want is to get paid
I just can't look at you can't you really
gross me out
You heard I'm married to a nice piece of a

Stuck at that shpen while I don't you rotate
I hope you only someday
I hope you die today
I just wanted to say I want another agent call me on the phone
I just wanted to say I want another agent
Tell me how the phone
But as you were long and ponderous you know she was almost as ponderous as they are
But it gave me time to find some interesting things I did not find dexies in mid-day runners
I don't know I bought it I must have misplaced it but
Where's that bit come from by the way?
Where did what they come from when he just played from the 8 cm
By the way it's 1120 and I still have no message on my machine out there
No package downstairs. I think they're gonna come and take you away before they're ready
Card also be full of next week doing a show
And guess what else I found all right
You
Thank you. It took me years to figure out that that's a white guy
Yeah
Well the only reason you know who a lot of these people are is when you see those best of the 70s and best of the 80s
Those CD compilation things they have on TV those commercials
That's why some of those are neat and spiderweb some people out there when we did the pull on that about
500 years ago and also has I forget exactly which channel it is because it's on the digital cable
The like a VH1 rock classics or something like that where they play all that fossil rock people you never
Remembered existed mmm
It's hit and miss
Oh
Work work
On speaker turning Japanese here's the 411 on jalo's phone sex with Ben
This is in the globe. Yeah much too long to be ditto with the right now so to speak but boy this is
More of this bunch of crap. It's like you're still you believe us yet. No
You believe that we're really doing it. No, you think we're gonna really get married and we're like maybe gonna
At least get naked. No, I don't think so. I think Matt would get really upset
560 505 60 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Look at that the new pull is up the most annoying song of all time is was
Well, we got a lot of money already. I better cast my voter. Have you put your vote in here? No, not yet. I'm looking
I'm sticking with old Debbie Boone man. I'm sticking with it even though there's a lot of really good choices on here
Did we put rock and roll part two with the Gary Glitter? Yes, we did. I don't think so. I wrote it down
Carlos didn't write it down Carlos again once again
Just can't keep it up. He just oh, it's on the new list. He doesn't have it yet
I see you guys haven't mentioned it yet. So I mean
I guess what's number one in the early voting with three votes including mine Debbie Boone
You blight up my life man. Oh
God they must have played that 55,000 times every god damn hour over and over and over and over in fact
You know what category I put that in that's right next to the wind beneath my wing this better middle a really syrupy the pressing
Oh just awful thing. I made you want to either blow somebody's brains out or commit sausages when you agree? Sure
Oh, thank you much. I'll stick with my original pick
Which was when beneath my wings?
There you go. Here's a lady in sunrise. Hello. Good morning Neil.
When is to you? You are worth waiting for. Let me tell you. Yes, I am
But did you hear that reference that mall made to you about living up there in your igloo?
Yeah, you're in your igloo well just now I was nice and toasty in here today and by the way
Friday at tomorrow and Friday it's gonna be 40 and Saturday 50
So good things I love waiting for
Yeah, the mother of all bombs the MLAB is gonna be tested here in Florida
So I think you're pretty wise up in your igloo up there. I had that on before it's gonna be in the panhandle right
Yeah between noon and five they're gonna be dropping the big one
You are lucky to stay in your igloo
Mm-hmm
If I could move I would too so I think you know this isn't such a paradise place
Well when you can't go any place else
I guess maybe it is maybe that's where he's coming from
Right when you've been bounced out of just about every place else
Love you Neil you take care now have a great day. All right bye bye
56705 60 I cannot find to come on ilean by dexies midnight runners and I know I went out and bought it
It's here somewhere. I'll get around to it in fact let's bring back the one-hit wonders. No, that's just a joke
I mean as long as I'm here and I got these 85 billion CDs that went out and spent all that money on because I have no audio capabilities on here
And I can't steal I mean the borrall the music off of a winnix
Like a lot of you people are doing you're not fooling us Carlos
You people aren't fooling any of us download all that music hour after hour day after day after day
Steam all those rallies from those poor and povered
No musicians look at Debbie Boone. She's got ten votes George. Yeah, Macarena's got six
Ebony and ivory but one of the Cartian Stevie. I wonder who the hell did that song is got three well
It's the early going
You missed the first pull on Moe all I can say was wow
In fact, you know, you can look at those numbers and you can analyze them and you can turn them upside down
The message is always the same when you look at a pull like that Moe don't buy a house. Yeah, that's that's the message
I get out of there when you agree. Yes, you were because you're a backstabber. Yeah
Now what was the exact quote he said about your just morning Carlos?
I don't know the exact quote but something about him breaking a
If you don't know just make one knife a real long knife in his back. Yeah, not knowing how deep George was gonna be able to stick it in
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Oh, no, he was talking about something else. Back to him since he keeps getting raped or raped at all the time, you know, cool
If that's the case moe probably not too far
26 after a month all they probably would like to after those episodes last summer with those evil emails and at phone call

I'm 47 and 5 six, we got a little follow up, I almost forgot about this tour, better not do that
Got a little bit of good news in Dave County
The show will go on
Ready for that? Good
A day after wanting to plug pull down a popular downtown concert mayor Manny Diaz of Manny said yesterday
He is satisfied that promoters agreed to beef up security and ban the sale of pacifiers and lollipops
At the 14 hour festival
That'd be like selling cough drops
Promoters of the ultra-electronic music festival scheduled for March 22nd in Bayfront Park
agreed to pay double police presence and install double fences
After the mayor expressed concerns about reports of rampant drug use at last year's concert
Promoters also said they would ban the sale of perifinalia popular among ecstasy users
Such as baby pacifiers
Lollipops
Are you ready for that?
I'm getting ill
I absolutely want to puke
Oh my god
It's that lollipops little boy
The lollipops that cause ecstasy is right and the glow sticks
And popsicles that supposedly enhance the drug experience
One lollipops little boy
In case they missed it the first time
The conflict began over the weekend after Diaz sent out a news release saying he would ask the board of Bayfront Park
Management trust not to wish a license to the festival
And by the way you people all you uh
Uh, Shmata heads there in the convenience stores you better get those popsicles out of there
I think five to ten for sol knows isn't it
At least it said it was the first time the mayor spoke so publicly against an issue but at Mondays board meeting
Promoters said that would take measures to reduce drug use at today long music festival
Which drew nearly 30,000 fans last year
Diaz also attended the meeting cities happy promoters agreed to where they added safety measures
And said he would not try to cancel the popular or concert
This is all about children and minors who set after the meeting
As he rushed home to make sure that his kid wasn't printing up anything larger than 20s
All right nice going mayor manny Diaz
She what are they going to do without those pacifiers? They might have to suck
Their thumb or well, that's right. Yeah, man. Have it a creamsicle
No, no or even worse. How about a fudge sickle

Anyway here's some facts that just came in I can't believe nobody's called or facts anything from the group smash mouth for your poll
One song in particular that gets them votes is all star
It's in a commercial that they play a hell out of it. It goes hey now you're in all star
Yeah, we've seen it eight million times. Thank you Danny. See you're right. Are we gonna get that on there? Yes
Yes Carlos all star smash mouth
He's over there typing he can't reach the microphone
I don't expect to hear from him just I'm just
pausing to give him time to let it absorb into his nimble mind okay. He was nodding didn't you hear it? Yeah, I heard it
Here's disco duck
I don't know
Whatever I mean there's a novel novel thing right? I mean like why don't we put all the other ones on there like a running bear or people
People he right yeah Thoreen had a good one who let the dogs out I mean oh yeah
We're having to hear that song and when haven't you heard it most of that song was about her
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, that should be on her who left the dogs out by the baha boys the baha boys
I remember that I remember the video but that was a stupid video and even stupider song
And the word and even stupider than that was the reaction of course of the sports nerds, you know who
loved the dogs uh who who you know oh my god we were playing it on this station
Oh geez enough to make your gag
Who who who who oh
Brother the pain is so great
Anyway to all the girls I love before holy of the greasiest and willy nelson
What are you saying? Yeah to all the girls I love before yeah, that's there annoying like a virgin by Madonna
I don't think so and it says any songs with lyrics all night long
Wasn't all night long by free?
All right now all right now all right now all night yeah
I see I was used to get the lyrics wrong on that song it is called all right now
I used to think it was all night long I don't know why listen to that song sometimes you'll see you know
Lionel Richie did all night long
But I know the song by free all right now and I mean I get out listen to anything that I'm saying sure
Yeah as usual he's not pinging he's got his own agenda. He's got that own militant speckled agenda
This is interesting speaking of his own agenda Bush says clap me or no EU speech what do you say to that?
I think the answer will be no
9
nay
George Bush pulled out of a speech to the European Parliament when MPs wouldn't guarantee a standing ovation
Senior White House officials said the president would only go to Strasbourg to talk about Iraq if he had a staged managed welcome
A source posted in negotiation said last night
President Bush agreed to his speech but insisted he get a standing ovation like if they stayed at the union address
His people also insisted there would be no protest or heckling
I believe would be a crucial speech for Mr. Bush to make in light of the opposition to the war here
But unless he only gets a
Adulation and praise it'll never happen
Mr. Bush's every appearance in the US's stage managed with audiences full of supporters
It was hoped he would speak after welcome Warsaw Pact Nations the NATO and proglas November
But as refusal to speak to EU leaders face to face is seen as a key factor in the split between the US and UK coalition and the rest of Europe
How do you like that huh?
Jeez here's chronic Sean who says
He says I did get pissed off and fired up about the Michael Moore book intro with the Democrats had any balls
They'd use the preamble for their campaign commercials
It's too bad more such an extremist
Naderite because he's funny as hell and often right on right Sean
It's true that my bababa
It goes on to say yes America's obsession with handguns is pathological for example
I'm ablitting a heart tinko tree hugging liberal and I've got six of them and guns too and that's sad
That's very sad Sean
One thing it's nice about here is that very very very few people have guns except the RCMP up here a
Here's his choices wonderful tonight by Eric Clapton
And the emotional rescue by the Rolling Stones
You think either one of those qualifying no no sorry Sean. We love you, but the answer is no
