Hey, Neil, the hockey news came out with a cover.
I know you do as bitch.
Listen, eight guys in the NHL.
The dog hit her right, man.
He sports shows with these 85 minute breaks.
You're out of your mind.
Are you kidding money maker?
You run 45 million, come out.
You do commercials for dead people.
We have 18 minutes an hour on your phone.
Oh, that's one of the good audience.
Oh, all spots radio.
See, we thought it was all sports radio.
They left the RR.
It's all sports radio and sports show is man dogs right.
You're right.
I spent the day yesterday.
I spent the day with the man.
I guess they had the touchdown club with all those money makers.
That was interesting.
And also again about how you spent the day with the man dog
at the touchdown club.
I want to hear about that.
Eight guys in the NHL that need to be great this year.
You know what they put on the cover?
Is Eric Lindross.
His career's over.
The Leafs won five-three last night in Hellstinky.
I didn't like it against Yokeert.
Whatever it is, Yokeert.
Here's the players they think they need to stand by.
They're a little finished girls team.
Byron, the fro.
They're finished.
Yarmere Yager.
This idiotic article you sent me from Monday by the way.
It's all news about the people washing their hands.
You wash your hands after you're killed.
I wash my hands whenever I feel like it.
Okay, depending on what I had them on.
But anyway, it says here Reuters Toronto International Airport.
Even you know it's Pearson International Airport.
What a bunch of morons at the Reuters.
They probably work at the Sunsettle.
Do you know that the Sunsettle still hasn't discovered
that Don Cox died on Monday morning?
Yeah, they haven't discovered it.
Do you think that big NHL going straight next year?
They still think that...
What do you mean do I think they're going to do?
They're going on strike.
They're going to have a lockout and maybe for two years they're saying now.
Wow, so it will be a 2005 NHL.
2005 NHL.
2004 NHL 2005.
Possibly.
No way.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
They ain't nobody say.
I swear thisortou can't.
I think they play out, so see you's laughing.
balance blue's one nothing.
It's no different for losing 14 of them.
My hand, why would you know?
My hand, why would you know?
You won't sleep well.
There's still only one game in the, uh, in the extended so it's just a big flop.
They had 12 games left.
Do you think they'll make the playoffs or not?
Yes.
And when they do should I have a party, a cave egg on it and team up?
Sure.
All right.
I dropped in on the floor, I was turning blue.
I died right after you.
I was every thought that I would die at the same time that Johnny's met her with you.
Shuffee ambulance door.
Shuffee ambulance door.
There's nothing else you can do.
Johnny and I are three who will take your back on the leader and pass away with the boy name soon.
I think I may have caught something when I think to say summer's that day.
I always thought you were a fool.
Well, let me show like you're blue.
Oh, it was daily time and from the alcohol and in the cocaine.
I was a star of the two.
And that were broken into two.
10.07 at 5.60 WQ and that was in very poor taste when you agreed.
I enjoyed it though.
I tried a lot immensely.
So anyway, we got the short show today because we're not a ballgame arena.
But we got our big Wednesday one to two hour.
And now that we got abbreviated a condensed first segment here because for all I can't how it's time it is.
Of course, it was pretty important stuff there in the last segment.
No, no.
Who's the biggest nerd of them all?
I think I figured out how to solve Eric's dilemma by the way, George.
Because Eric's acting up again.
No, no, he's got a lot of other stuff to do.
I mean, we're small potatoes.
He doesn't make any money off our website.
It's a labor of love.
He's doing it here.
But on these days when we do like two polls like today, when we do the preliminary one and we're building the second one.
Yeah.
Even though it'll cut down on the number of votes, we don't have to put the second one until the end of the show.
Okay.
You see what I'm saying?
There's no reason why we have to follow.
No, you're right.
We have the show poll and the post poll.
So we compile it and then we put it on Earth, the other show and just one quick facts or email over to Eric and he slaps it on it.
And that's it.
So he doesn't have to devote all his precious time eating time.
I mean, working time to the near-ranges website because we want to maintain a great quality we've had on Earth thanks to your close personal drug addicted friend.
Who's the biggest nerd of them all?
We asked yesterday, what is a long list here?
I don't have time to read them all.
We'll just do the double digit ones.
1153 votes.
Bill Gates wins hands down your pantaloni's man.
People hate Bill Gates and they can't stand Microsoft and all that crap.
They want him to just die a wicked death.
Bill Gates 234.
Carrotop 117.
Woody Allen 97.
George W. Bush 91.
Rick Riley 47, who's been off the air for a long, how long have you been off a couple of years now?
That's about right.
I think that's pretty good 47 votes for being off the air that long, but they remember what a nerd he was.
Paul Schaefer 39.
Al Gore 35.
Jew Lieberman 33.
Joseph Gaki 32.
Oh, I forgot to ask God how come he sucks Joseph Gaki's ass. Don't even forget tomorrow.
Uh oh, you're supposed to remind me, but we were sure it on time because I've already went up for all in Joseph Gaki.
Can you believe how long that break went on?
Yeah, I believe it.
Three minutes after 10?
Why are you just giving the whole first segment?
Fine with me.
Less work, more pay. That's my motto.
He can go till 10.30 if he wants.
Shabwool is dead. Good enough for Howard's sperm. It's good enough for for Ralph. You can go till 10.30, baby.
Just let me get in the spots.
Joseph Gaki 32 Ben Stein and Brian Orcross each had 31. Adam Sandler 29.
Screech had 29.
Geldie had 29. He was a later dish. Nice going, Geldie.
Oh!
Tucker Carlson and George Willich had 24, a couple of right wing assholes with bow ties.
Ross P. Roe 22.
Mike Lupica 20.
Bob Costa 17.
Sean Headley and Matthew Lesco 16.
And J. Feeler 16.
What a big years.
Alex Pingapakania 14.
Rick Moranis 12.
Clay A. Kintin and word Al Yankovic 10.
That's what Clarence said this morning.
He wanted for the new year. More Anus.
He said they yesterday too.
He said every day. He ain't getting it though.
He ain't getting much.
So that's our yesterday poll.
Now here's the first one today.
As we're poll intensive.
Climb on it.
Now that we got the official announcement by John Edwards who's got a
Chanaman's chance in purgatory.
And now Wesley Clark General, Wesley Clark's going to throw his hand on the ring today.
Right.
Why do they use that expression?
You ever thought about that throw his hat into the ring?
What a stupid ass thing.
It comes from some assholes.
Back in the days when he used to wear those big fedoras.
Right. Remember the godfather Michael had that big fedora?
Is that like if you wanted to participate in the boxing match?
When he came back to CK, when he would have class outside of school,
he had that big old fashion for the runner.
Yeah. That was a really fashionable very gay hat.
What's important, K is that.
How are let's see. Who'd you like to see as the Democratic presidential candidate next year?
And here's the list. I think I got them all on her.
And we don't want any names of like Hillary people that are running.
Little Bush.
People that are running.
Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, Julie Berman, John Kerry, Bob Graham, John Edwards,
Al Sharpton, Venice Kiss and it's Keralmozly Braun.
I don't care. I'm for Bush or I don't care.
They all suck.
I think I got a cover there, don't you?
That's it. Did I leave anybody out?
That's what I should say.
That's actually running? Right. Anyone really?
No, no, seriously. I even put like Keralmozly Braun on her.
Nobody knows who that is.
Al Sharpton's kind of a joke, but he's running.
And let me also say this, the FDA sucks.
I just want to mention it.
Oh, look at this. 14 more suits.
So priest and church. Where's this? The Cincinnati.
Jesus, this stuff is just pouring in here about the god damn priests.
The most important story of the day though is about.
It's a 90's, that gave a coming out of the door.
It's a 90's, that gave this to Bob.
Oh, you're rolling.
Oh, you're rolling.
Just to show you what a banana republic stuff Florida is.
Sweet.
Dolphins, plant tributes, acnes, and cruise, it fills match-up on Sunday.
How do you like that? I mean, what kind of crap is that?
Are they having a tributed to John Ritter?
No. No. Are they having a tributed to Johnny Cash?
The Audible. I bet it's going to sing any Johnny Cash music Sunday at the ballgame?
No.
But only in a banana republic, baby.
They're doing it again.
The dolphins have announced plants told a tribut to sauce a legend.
Celia Cruz during half time a Sunday night's game against the bills.
But that could be an ugly game, man.
Cruz's husband, Pedro Knight will receive a dollar.
Do you think he's keen to Sunday night?
Or receive, I guess it's confidential.
Well, receive a dolphin's jersey during the tributy which will include a performance
by Latin Grammy nominee Victor Manuel.
To obviously he's not from Cuba.
Better not be.
A cruise 78 out of a brain tumor July 16th,
the Cuban exile was immensely popular in Miami.
So much so that Kaya Ocho, the main street running through the city's Cuban community,
has the honorary name of Celia Cruz' way.
I thought that dressing in drag was the Celia Cruz' way.
If you don't know the answer, you'll see the world.
You'll see the world.
You'll see the world.
You'll see the world.
You'll see the world.
The tributy's part of a Latin theme-dited pro player's day to honor
of Hispanic Heritage Month.
I didn't even know that. Did you with Hispanic Heritage Month?
I had no idea.
Are you proud of Hispanic Heritage?
Oh, yeah. I got the flag painted on my face.
Well, I would be proud too unless I lived in South Florida.
Then I'd be embarrassed.
Anyway, Marty Centron leads singer of the Latin pop group.
No mercy, a sketch of performed the star-spangled banner before the game on acoustic guitar.
In addition to 150 fifth graders from venture-print elementary school at Haya,
will be on the field for the halftime ceremony holding flags from 20 Hispanic nations.
No picket of eye English, okay?
So there you go. That's what's going on Sunday night before the bills trounced at Alphans.
Well, probably be one of the most embarrassing losses since that 62-7.
Was that the score at Jacksonville?
It was pretty bad.
No, no, wasn't that 62-7?
You know, now that you're on the payroll, these ambiguous answers aren't going to cut it.
Let's get right to the chase.
I am Alphans.
We're now welcome Senator John Kerry joining us from the Moyni-Democrat of Massachusetts,
now an official candidate for his party's nomination.
I'm by dad. Don't get there up.
Don't have some phone calls. You're watching Larry King Live.
Denver, Colorado. Hello.
Senator Kerry, how will you pay off the deficit?
You're going to have to kick back in more money now.
And by the way, we're going to penalize every family in America.
Port Gritchie Florida, hello.
Senator Kerry, is it true that you used to work at Sears as an American?
Oh, absolutely. You have 19 years experience.
Olympia Washington, hello.
Senator Kerry, what will you do with healthcare?
I had healthcare because I'm the United States senator and I could afford it.
And that's why I'm going to see to it that everyone in America can't get what I got.
We can't serve all of you because we don't have enough money.
The reason we don't have enough money, Larry, is because I party.
Gardner Massachusetts, hello.
Senator Kerry, how's the healthiest?
Are you really nice to ask?
I'm able to say that I am cured and I want to stay that way.
Thank you, Senator. We'll be seeing you again soon.
Thanks so much.
Senator John Kerry now an official candidate for his party's nomination.
Can 19 at 560 WQM, so somebody immediately faxes this in, which we thank them profusely?
What is the meaning in the origin of the expression to throw one's hand into the ring?
When you throw or toss your hand into the ring, what you're doing is informing everyone that you're willing to enter a contest.
The expression these days is normally used in politics when somebody throws his hand in or into the ring, he's announcing to the world, he's a candidate in the coming election.
In other words, he's contesting. Here are a few examples.
Renuka is seriously considering throwing your hand into the ring this time.
Arjun, this is from the Hindu newspaper in India. So that's why we got these Indian names.
Yeah. Arjun is tossed his hand into the ring. This should make things interesting.
I would sound people out of the four throwing my hand.
The expression comes from the sport of boxing in the old days whenever somebody threw his hand in the ring in boxing, it implied that he was challenging the boxer, he was willing to fight the person in the ring.
A well-known boxer, John L. Sullivan, used to go through this ritual every time he fought.
After defeating his opponent, Sullivan would toss his hand in the ring. This was a challenge to the people in the audience.
If the man who challenged him was able to reign on his feet to the end of the bat, then Sullivan used to give him a prize.
They were not too many occasions when he actually had to pay the challenger. How do you like that?
So the original meaning of throwing a hand in the ring was to challenge it was only in the 19th century the expression took on a meeting it has today announcing one's political candidacy.
How do you like that? And probably has something to do with hat trick and hockey too when you think that's not...
No. Probably not.
Anyway, I love this fact. This is a very good stuff.
Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson prayed on the Christian broadcasting network based in Virginia Beach that Isabel would turn from the coast.
He asked God to put a wall of protection around Virginia Beach and East Coast. In the name of Jesus, we reach our hand in faith, commanded storm to cease its forward motion of the North and turn and go out into the sea.
Robertson prayed on the 700 Club. Is he got any chance of that happening? No.
As he continues moving north-northwest at about nine miles per hour.
In fact, I'm thinking right now I have a psychic vision that it's going to go plowing right into Virginia Beach and right up Pat Robertson's ass.
How do you like that? You can only pray. If you ask me, that's what I'm praying for.
Oh, in the name of Jesus, in the name of...
Damn, God.
Let's pray that that storm that they eye the old brown eye of Hurricane Isabel.
Why is it that every time I say that? No, I start thinking of...
Let's see if that grew. I can't stop. Every time I start that crap, I just can't stop playing it, you know?
Newspaper, Newspaper.
Now, the enthusiasm of Sunday night celebration, and tribute to Celia, maybe temperate somewhat when a PA announcer doesn't answer the crowd officially, it has been determined by the autopsy that Celia was a man.
But that's beside the point.
I guess people discriminating, people already knew that, didn't they? I guess.
So, Pat Robertson says he's praying for it. Now, a lot of people dying. That's why I've played those, I'm dying over here, things a lot of people dying to drop a light flight.
We can't even keep track. In fact, the sun's set. Seriously, I don't want to go to aap on it because obviously
South Florida is so insensitive anyway. They don't really give a crap. We didn't have one call from anybody since Monday
I announced that anybody saying, well, you know, Don Cox was a real personality and it's really a shame.
I was only 55 years old. He died in his sleep. He was up there taking care of his ill mother in Jojen, Atlanta.
Nothing because the people of South Florida are callous and indifferent. So maybe they deserve this come sentinel.
See, even if they would even if Duff wouldn't have emailed the information to Tom Jicke, which he did. He told me that again this morning.
Even if he wouldn't have done that, they could have ripped it off out of the hero, which wouldn't be the first time that they've done that.
Sure, but no, because when jury Williams died, did they care? No, when the casper died, did they?
No, because Tom Jicke or one of those guys might have to do a little homework and talk to a couple of people,
which is so much more difficult and time-consuming than just writing a puff opinion piece about some bogus fall TV show that's going to get canceled in three weeks anyway.
See, I think you're the one that's wrong. I see keep presuming that Tom Jicke is a radio writer. He obviously stopped doing that.
No, I just said Tom Jicke or somebody. I'm assuming him because he's supposed to be the long time long standing radio TV.
He made one of those hands of that. But he washed his hands. Well, maybe he was a person in an international airport.
What a crocker crap. You know, this is the kind of stuff that makes it and they newswires. Oh, 96% of the people at Toronto International Airport, which it's not called,
are washing their hands as compared to like 75% how about some of the Pakistanis and Indian people? Are they washing it? No, and you can believe me.
You know, I've brought that up so many times over the years and people refuse to acknowledge. I guess because there's so many parochial people in the US,
they refuse to acknowledge that people's diet and their skin pigmentation result in a different aroma. You know what I'm saying?
Right. Sure. Because it's very easy to say, well gee, they haven't seen a bar of soap in 15 years and that's possible. I guess by,
I think there's like a pigmentation thing like people from India and Pakistan. Ooh, you don't say not not all. Like curry.
Kid curry has something to do with it. I'm sure he did. I figured it out. Him now that is good buddy done.
Cost is that on Monday. At least I'll say one thing for kid curry is not making that an excuse to screw off. Okay. Like Greg redid.
Oh, gee. I'm all broken up about Cox. I can't deal with that now. But we did get Scott on a payroll. He's got the paperwork filled out.
He's like a step away from the payroll. It's coming. Anyway, guess who died? You already know because you fact he's right. I got too
a magic. I'm going to go. Let me show you the other one first. The one that doesn't really bother me all that much. I'm not broken up about it.
Garner Ted Armstrong, evangelist known for the world tomorrow in Tyler, Texas.
Evangelist garnered Ted Armstrong known for his work on the religious TV program. The world tomorrow died Monday afternoon
complications from pneumonia. Mr. Armstrong 73 died in Tyler hospital. His son Mark Armstrong told the Tyler morning telegraph. Here comes the best part of this story.
Just like Pat Robertson, we cannot fully understand why the healing we begged for was not granted. Mark Armstrong said in a written statement. I know that my dad fully expected that his work will continue.
And we've all got a enormous responsibility to make certain that his work has not been in vain and that his voice will not be silenced. Yaddy yaddy yaddy yaddy.
Mr. Armstrong found the church of God or national in 1978 after his father Herbert W Armstrong. The late father of the worldwide church of God
excommunicated his son from the church based in Pasadena, California. He found the Garner Ted Armstrong evangelical, even evangelistic association in Tyler and 78 along with the church of God or national. Yaddy yaddy yaddy.
How do you like that? Yeah, that was the original one was Herbert W Armstrong. I forgot about him. Hope and then we had Garner Ted and now we've got
no mean either. Maybe God was busy. Maybe he was maybe God was working on attribute for Celia Cruz. We would be doing a van head by the way for the best of the
other death. This is really sad. Vulker Brian is going to be all broke up about this and all the other old parts like us too.
I'm willing. Shabwoli died. Oh no. Veteran actor in Westerns like high noon who also recorded the number one pop.
The purple people leader has died. His wife said he was 82. This is a Nashville.
Woli suffered from leukemia in 1996 was hospitalized Monday at Scarlett Medical Center in Nashville. He had just paid respects to American music legend.
Johnny Cash on Sunday. It was just his time to go said his wife Linda. Woli who died Tuesday appeared more than 60 movies.
Acted in some 50 TV shows and recorded pop and country songs on a big screen. Woli appeared in most of the westerns beginning in 50 is credits
included high noon as a whiskey drinking killer outlaw Josie Wales war wagon distant drums man with other star giant and
Hoosiers. The purple people leader about an unidentified flying object sold three million copies in 1958 as the number one pop record.
We got it. We got it. Oh, there it is. I thought I heard what goes. Look, I'm doing my job. Don't get crazy.
One big guy. If he said one big brown eyes are we. It was a one I'd one foreign time.
People. Okay, that's a cheboys dead purple people leader. That's enough like I said. Kill it. Thank you.
10 to 10 while we play more, but we don't have time because for all got us back back into a box here.

The un-the-binator republic, baby. Only in Miami.
She was a community icon. In a community that needs tonight, God. As far as I can't tell, she was the fantastic iconoplastic.
Celia proved.
And Goliath William Records presents the dulcet Bolivia sounds of Celia Cruz. She's dead, you know.
She was so beautiful.
She was a young angel. She's got a boy. If I were a guy, it's a girl. If you were a baby, we are a angel.
She's got a boy. If I were a guy, it's a girl. If you were a baby, we are a angel.
Celia Cruz. Who's so such a lose for you?
A bellable bell. If they're teased, you see the employer.
So I'm keeping my eye on Isabel. And I'm noticed that if it just takes a slight jog, you know how these things wobble
first to the west, first to the west, first to the west, just a slight jog to the east.
It's going to smack right into Virginia Beach.
Oh, I just went to the east. I'm praying. I suck it by the chicken.
Oh, Jesus, please. Here's a lady in plantation. Hello.
Hi, Nihalee. How are you doing?
Pretty good. How are you?
I'm fine, thanks. I'm calling to see if you can kind of pressure me,
yell, and to put 10 pointing a location today.
Because then like rearranging my days like a meetup wherever he's going to be.
I don't think he's going to be anywhere today except in the orifice and the Marines or office.
Because you mentioned on Monday he would be out in the van on Wednesday.
Well, that's what they keep telling me and they keep stalling it off.
I foresee a real mitigated disaster this year in our fundraiser because they're just,
we always get leftovers. We get nothing.
This radio station gives us absolutely no assistance whatsoever.
Well, maybe you can use some of your pressure there and get them out.
Well, where would you like them to be?
I'm going to groward. I don't care.
How about that, Shalette University in Broward? That's always a real popular spot.
Fact that's right by where I'm at right now.
That's what I'm saying. I'm going to work on it.
Okay, great. You have a good day, Neil.
You two, thanks.
All right.
There you go. Miguel, the University in Broward to Shalette says one of our most popular spots.
Across where the cops used to make the coffee but that can be insurant.
They're no more.
No, that's too bad.
You know what I'm talking about?
No.
Oh, well, that's kind of my, uh, neighborhood University in Broward.
Right across from me, once popular, Broward Mall.
I'm right down the street from the once not so popular, Macy's Mall.
Does anybody really ever shop in at Macy's Mall?
As always, Jan with cars.
I haven't been there in so long.
Probably just the people who worked there.
No, the last time I was there is when you did a fundraising appearance there.
Right, and it was like nobody there.
That was your birthday.
That's right, Dan, the gigantic birthday cake.
Nobody was there because Ruan was there in a stanchilla.
No, sure, they were screaming running out of there.
They got with the eyes of there.
What is that smell? What is that smell?
It was screaming.
Rack them.
Well, whatever part it was.
Anyway, here's the first poll.
It's up there now and we're like, like I said,
74 votes, Wesley Clark 21 Howard Dean 15.
I don't care.
They all suck 13.
I don't care.
I'm for Bush 8 10.
28% of this crowd Bob Graham 8.
Al Sharpton 5 John Kerry is scary three.
John Edwards 1 0 for Julie Berman.
Boy.
That's because the Orthodox Jews have been in this show and the thank goodness.
Dennis, considered maybe they're out there rubbing their tisses together.
Dennis, considered it's none and care mostly brown has none.
Isn't that a shock?
No, so.
So then now the poll that we're going to work on today during the show.
And like I said, thanks again to Mike and Cooper City or wherever it was.
It wasn't Cooper City.
Where was it?
I don't know.
Mike in the Yenem's belt who faxed yesterday.
Coconut Creek about dead people because it really pisses off Mo.
Absolutely.
And we do polls on dead people.
We still have this gigantic audience and he has no numbers at all.
By the way, the trend tomorrow morning at 1130, the Arbor trends for June,
July and Augusto.
It's going to be really pressure packed.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm listening.
It's going to be heavy, heavy, duty.
Trust me when I tell you.
So the first we're going to do a series of these polls on dead people.
And then we'll have like a dead off at the end, right?
The place that that dead political figure by the way,
Schmidt Candidate idea had Eric.
That was a really bad idea and quit interfering with programming.
See, I saw his dilemma right off the bat tonight.
That was brilliant, by the way.
Then I have it to sit there for all four hours and adding and throw.
And also for you emailing.
All of a sudden I can just email right to tell us at the end.
And then they have plenty of time.
They got like a whole bunch of hours to vote on it.
And it also leaves the first poll up there.
Whatever we do, we can do a whole bunch of polls.
I've done that.
So you say in one day, oh my, who's your favorite dead political figure?
JFK, this is a list I got so far.
JFK Martin Luther King, Thomas Jefferson, FDR,
Teddy Roosevelt, Abe Lincoln, or Bobby Kennedy.
I think that's a good list.
Dave or starter.
Don't you?
I like it.
I mean, somebody probably said William Henry Harrison.
I don't have enough sense to come out of a rain.
I like that.
Tippy canoe and Tyler too.
Do you ever see pictures of him?
No.
William Henry Harrison?
No, I mean, I'm having paintings of him.
I wouldn't even see pictures.
You would see painting, right?
Like grizzled old white-haired guy in a,
look like an old troll.
Speaking of old trolls,
14 men yesterday sued the Roman Catholic
arts sciences of Cincinnati, arch-Precipitial,
Polargic and the Reverend Lawrence Strip Matter
of Kettering, Ohio bringing to 24 the number of man
claiming in lawsuits that Strip Matter sexually abused them
as boys and arch-stices covered it up.
In fact, let me find my story from the Boston Globe.
Here it is, before I finish with that story to let me forget.
In the month after releasing its much-anticipated
new child protection policy, I made 30 of the officials
in the arts dynasties of Boston quietly revised the document
to curb access by alleged victims' abuse
to records of church proceedings in case of accused priests.
Preces.
That's like breakfastes.
The revisions which church officials say were necessary to correct
ambiguous language in the published policy
of drawn criticism from advocates for abuse victims
who fear of backing away by the church,
a backing away by the church from promises of greater openness
in such matters.
The changes to the policy were apparently made
without the knowledge of members of the commission
appointed by Cardinal Law to help crafted
or members of a second their lay advisory committee
charged with overseeing its implement.
In other words, in quiet behind closed doors
they're trying to like do everything they can to hush it up.
Anyway, getting back to Ohio.
The 14 men referred to as John Doe's numbers 11-24
in the lawsuit filed in Hamilton County Common Police Court
say they were abused by Strip Matter between 1960 and 1988
while he was working in Cincinnati,
including a stint as principal of elder high school.
Always be nice to your elders.
Strip Matter's 24 accusers are seeking four million dollars each
in damages a total of 96 million.
The Arthas Dice's Assigned Strip Matter now 70 to be
associate pastor of St. Albert the Great Church in Kettering in 1988
after he was removed from a Cincinnati church
because they substantiated abuse allegation
and required to undergo inpatient psychological therapy.
And it goes on and on and on.
It's a long story.
I'm sure that's only the beginning.
Another one of those isolated series of incidents,
another isolated 24 and just with that one priest.
And it goes on like I said it on and nobody cares.
Just like Dick Cheney who keeps lying through his teeth,
here's the latest one.
That only go on meat to press on Sunday and lie about the
connection between Iraq, which now Don Rumsfeld,
no less than Don Rumsfeld says,
oh there's no link between Iraq and 9-11.
What?
Really?
Yeah, the Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld said yesterday
he had no reason to believe that Iraq saw him who's saying had any hand
at the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US.
At a Pentagon news conference,
Rumsfeld was asked about a pool that indicated nearly 70% of respondents
believe the Iraqi leader probably was personally involved.
I've not seen any indication that would lead me to believe I could say that,
Rumsfeld said.
How do you like that?
I'm shocked.
Yeah, a random act of honesty.
Now Vice President Cheney, who of course is in addition to that lie about that,
the former CEO of Halliburton companies received hundreds of thousands
of dollars from the company and deferred salary payments and taking orifice,
while asserting he has no financial interest in the company,
Senate Democrats said yesterday.
Senate democratically to Tom Dashel,
the South Dakota and Senator Frank Lautenberg,
New Jersey said the revelations be enforced today.
Oh, you know we left off the pool,
Dick Gavhart.
How about Bob Graham?
He's on there.
Dick Gavhart, George, make sure that they're okay.
I'm sorry.
So easy to forget about Dick for some.
Senate democratically to Tom Dashel,
the South Dakota Senator Frank Lautenberg,
which is he said the revelations be enforced and need for hearings about the nobid contracts
for reconstruction work in Iraq,
that Halliburton is received from the Bush administration.
On NBC's Meet the Press program Sunday,
Cheney lied, a Cheney study had severed all ties with the Houston-based company.
Kathy Martin, a Cheney spokeswoman, confirmed that Cheney had been receiving payments from Halliburton,
has been, but she disputed that a statement on Meet the Press had been misleading.
Right.
Cheney had already earned the salary that was now being paid, Martin said,
adding that once he became a nominee for Vice President,
he bought an insurance policy to guarantee that the deferred salary would be paid to him.
So it's just, you know, it's like a chess game, you know, like a shadow boxing,
like a shell game, like they do on prices right, you know,
where they move the thing around under the appena shells.
That's what he's doing.
He's moving it around under the Pena shells, old Dick Cheney.
Just unbelievable.
In fact, one of the bedtime stories that we have on our website today is about the fact that
this president has lied more to the country than any president in the history of this country.
And I think that whoever wrote that is...
Absolutely correct, sir.

Dick Clark sucks just watch Bulleye for Columbine.
You'll see the embarrassing attempt that Michael Moore had to interview him
about his slave laborer in Michigan.
He saw certainly place to hear that his restaurant in Basav went out of business.
Let's hear it for Dick going under.
1048 at 560 W.A.M.
Speaking of that after battling to a virtual draw on same-sex marriage yesterday,
the Liberal Canadian government and Canadian alliance agreed to rematch at the ballot box next year.
The divided Liberal government's plan to legalize gay marriage barely passed a critical first test,
but it did pass as MPs voted 137-132 against an alliance most to preserve the traditional
definition of marriage as one man and one woman.
And they said, uh-uh.
Just barely, I watched this matter.
I watched the vote.
Yeah.
And they like stand up in a mudder and rubber-beat-butter-boop-butter-bass-cilly.
Where are silly wigs like the Brits?
No, they don't as a matter of fact.
Not like Cedar Cruz.
560-560-560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
Here's Miami, hello.
No.
No, not today.
Maybe next week.
I'll think about it.
Miami, hello.
Miami, when is this?
Yes.
Elp.
Cedar Cruz line, yes.
Is this your dad?
Sounds like me.
They always talk about time talks.
I grew up with him in the 70s and 80s.
Listen to his shows.
I think we were awesome.
And the guy always had a smile-white smile on his face.
Right.
He'll be missed.
I mean, he's party.
Oh, we party.
Yeah.
So, anyway, you got one here that kind of sad for his loss.
Well, thanks for caring enough to send your very best.
Are you the only one?
Well, that makes one of us.
And don't forget time jick is the douchebag.
Thank you.
Time jick is an asshole, man.
He really is.
You're showing your two colors last year or two, Tom.
You're a real schmuck.
Talking about having your finger on a pulse
of what's happening in the community.
Here's the guy that was on here in that market for like 20 or 30 years.
And it's not like we're talking about somebody who, you know,
who left the air 20 years ago or something.
You know, I was outside out of mind that kind of thing.
No, like Jerry Williams.
Maybe there was an excuse there, although I don't think so.
But in this particular case, here's the guy that anybody in everybody
who grew up in South Florida, New Cox, on a radio.
And the stunt sent, they'll can't be bothered giving the information now.
Jika, you're an embarrassment.
You're an idiot.
Okay?
I'm embarrassed that they actually let you fill on this radio station
because you've lost it.
Whenever the hell you had it, I don't know, but you sure as hell have lost it.
What in the right is nothing about what's happening in the local community.
But nevertheless, I mean, what am I getting excited about?
He's consistent.
He at least he's consistently out to launch.
You just, you know, and this is supposed to be a freaking newspaper.
No.
That's why I keep telling you people, man, if you had a real newspaper in South Florida,
you'd see some real changes, but then never going to happen.
It'll never happen.
If you had a real, like a tabloid, like we got the Toronto Sun here,
even with the right wing politics, but it's like a real newspaper.
If you had a tabloid in there, put the goddamn Sun Settle in the hair right out of
the window, put them to shame, put them on a back burner.
A real newspaper with some people who had balls and weren't pandering all the time,
and writing a bunch of puff-piece crap, and who could afford to like
have some real writers in there as opposed to these high school stringer kids that they have
there right, 95% of the crap.
And these dottering silly guys that used to write about dog racing,
pretending to be TV and radio critics and experts.
But nevertheless, here's a call from Davie.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, sir?
Yeah, I didn't know that Tom Cox was real.
When did this happen?
Sir, it's...
Died Monday morning.
See, this up visiting is sick of my there.
Where do you have a heart attack or something?
You just died in the sleep?
Wow.
What if I have a stand major?
He died, but nobody told him yet.
It was his career that died, I guess.
I don't know.
He's still fumbling around.
Okay, just curious.
And he still owes me that money too, by the way.
Well, it looks like Larry King owes you $50, right?
Exactly.
All right, take care.
Okay, you too.
Well, there's a guy who seemed mildly interested.
Who's your favorite dead political figure?
That's the poll we're building.
They all are with them.
We're not going to any suggestions.
Because there's so many, but nevertheless,
just the piss off Moe.
JFK, Martin Luther King, Thomas Jefferson, FDR,
Teddy Roosevelt, Abe Lincoln, Bobby Kennedy.
And let's say here Moe.
Let's hear Moe, okay?
In the meantime, pull number one.
And now I see we got Dick Kabbard on there right away.
Now, now, Eric can just sit back, have his brunches,
take care of all of his other important paying customers,
and just forget about us, right?
Okay, even though it is a labor of love.
171 votes already.
This is shocking.
Who would you like to see as the Democratic
presidential candidate next year?
General Wesley Clark, who's announcing
the day 45 votes already.
And you want to know why that probably is?
Why?
Probably because they think he can win.
Do you think?
It would seem to me.
I voted for Howard Dean, who's got 32.
I don't care about those professional Jews who are faxing me
all that crap about they don't like his position on the Middle East.
Like, suggested them is Coxalhoist, okay?
Take a good, very amenable.
Can't hurt.
I don't care.
They all suck.
30 people say that.
Bob Graham, 25.
Too bad BDI Bob does never chance.
He's said all the right things, but he has.
In all the wrong places.
Remember that song?
Sing all the right things in all the wrong places?
I don't care.
I'm for Bush.
22 people say that about 12.
28%.
Al Sharpen's got seven.
John Kerry, who looks really scary.
He's got four.
John Edwards has got two votes.
He's got less likely.
Yeah, John Edwards.
And what's wrong with having a president
who can talk to dead people?
We do.
He'd be perfect for South Florida.
Arzt talk to Jesus.
Dennis Gussinich has got a pair.
Dick Gemhart is, we finally put him on.
He's still only got one vote.
Julie Reminds got one.
And Kramos they've gone out of 181 votes.
She's got the big.
Oh, who is she, kid?
Now why is she spitting her wheels?
What's the point?
What is the point?
Why is she wasting our time and our energies?
She didn't even get reelected in Illinois.
Oh, by the way, my kudos to the, uh,
who is in Illinois?
Is it the governor?
That did what?
And also the mayor of Springfield,
a Massachusetts who are like doing business
who are getting prescription drugs
for the city and, uh,
nah, it's not, it's not the governor.
But for, uh, public employees from Canada
and the FDA is fighting a tooth and nail
because the FDA sucks.
The FDA are a bunch of grave robbers
who are embedded with the pharmaceutical companies
that who want to continue ripping off
the public in America and all over the world
and especially the old people.
You're getting it.
We'll get it out, rip them out.
And so now the FDA is trying to back up
the battle.
He was on this morning on CNBC,
the mayor of Springfield,
mass who's saving his city like eight or nine million dollars.
They animate all these budget cutbacks
and cutback cops and all these other
because they didn't have the money.
They didn't have it in the budget.
It's not he's going to re-institute all those positions
and get more cops and more public fire people, etc.
Because, uh,
they're saving eight, nine million dollars a year
buying prescription drugs from Canada.
And the FDA says,
oh, but do we know about the quality
or these drugs safe?
The same guy them stuff made by the same companies.
Okay, it's like saying,
oh, how can the people in Canada still be alive?
I mean, we don't know if their prescription drugs are safe.
One kind of crap is that.
What a lame excuse to try to pull it over.
They eyes at the, uh,
and then the public course in America says,
hey, screw you up.
The FDA, we want to save the money.
We'll take a chance.
We'll take a chance on those drugs
from that dangerous third world country,
Canada.
Right.
What a, what a shame and a scam.
Try just mention that in passing.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Hey, last week you had a poll about, uh,
the world's most dangerous men.
Yes.
And you lost, uh, uh,
a good opportunity for whatever you're a little bit.
Do you have that, uh,
outgo scene, uh, one that goes,
ew, like that?
That's, that's, that's got nothing to do with
alcohol, Steve.
You mean,
ew, what is that happening with alcohol, Steve?
Kim,
Jung,
ew,
there you go.
Pretty weak.
By the way, how many Holy Ours are going to be
at the dolphin bills game on Sunday night?
About 30 minutes.
I see.
I don't understand that.
That whole
this pandering thing that just never stops in South Florida.
I could understand if it was like the Sunday night
cock fights or something like that,
then have a big tribute to Celia Cruz
and have all these Holy Ours.
And those beginning lace people come in there
and do their, uh, uh, uh, uh,
Hoochie Coochie and with the Marachi band.
But at a dolphin game,
you know, I mean, what's the point?
You got like crack crackers and juices,
the dolphin crowd.
Aren't they just go to Fort Lee where she was living?
In fact, they used the old Jews.
They like those free-salt teens.
They get along good with them crackers.
I beg your pardon?
Aren't she just go to,
why don't they just go to Fort Lee?
I mean, she loved the Latin community,
but she was living in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
Well, there's probably a lot of teenos
in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
No, there are.
What's the place in Jersey where they have all the Cubans?
What's the place?
Rawway State?
No, no, sir.
Oh, come on.
I'm serious.
There's a place in Jersey that's loaded with Cubans.
What is the, uh, where is it?
It might be Bayon.
I can't believe that between you being from Jersey
and George being Cuban,
either one of you knows what I'm talking about.
What is wrong with the,
the people?
People from the,
the Jersey.
Well,
Fort Lee is in Fort Lee,
Nielts,
Fort Lee.
There's no Cubans in Fort Lee.
1057 and 560 W.
You know, I'm just,
I'm working alone to the,
have the feeling I'm just like in a vacuum,
which is fine with me.
It's okay.
Because I'm starting to feel a little bit unclean,
especially now that Scott is on the payroll,
or very close to it.

oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and horizon wireless line see now it's too bad that they
don't have one of those shows on playboy we could like pretend we're replaying the audio
oh see i don't dare when they're talking i don't dare leave that on
because we don't want to do like scott and jeopardize our careers if by the way scott quit talking
about it you idiot here's vocal hello good morning i'm calling about the rumsville article you
mentioned i read it too and i'm sure it's in light of the poll that said nearly 70 percent of
americans believe that i rack was directly related to the nine one one incident right so i went and
i started looking up because i specifically remember rumsfeld trying to make that that connection
so when i found this on the internet today when he was standing in front of the senate armed
services committee in july he said the objective in the global war on terror is to prevent another
attack like september eleven or biological nuclear or chemical attack that could be worse
and he says with confidence the world is a better place today because the u.s. led to coalition
of forces in the action in iraq but he draws those parallels he has in you endo and he
throws all this propaganda at us to try to get us to to make the connection between nine eleven
and uh... iraq and then two months later he acts like we can't remember what he said two months ago
exactly i think the only way to describe it is right they lie a lot
and i have to get a pali thanks uh... thanks pali have a great life
yet the uh... public is starting to see through it like looking through a panic
last like looking through a piece of cellophane they lied through their teeth
there are people are american kids over there dying and getting severely wounded
air read data was like four more seriously wounded uh... overnight
airy single day
and by the way since we're still in such a good job between osama yamama and mullabola
or mar
and uh... saturday
the aerobic news network al-Arabia today broadcast a new audio tape statement
attributed to satam who say
last month al jazeera broadcasted tape also purported to carry the voice of satam
cia officials said they believe there was a high likelihood the voice on the
earlier tape was at a saturday and why shouldn't it be he still alive
the hit him with five shots he still alive just like that in kolioli
in the past few months several tapes that said it would made by saturday
with an air including one in july urging arachis uh...
to resist us forces
this report of the tape follows new attacks on us troops in arach where at least
four soldiers were wounded
the coalition for public information center said the two day
that's anything else about the tape nights about it
but i'd like that a new satam tape we got him yet no no but we're lying and we
have the article we had yesterday that we have no idea what i think closer to uh...
osama now that we were before but we're wasting all these billions and billions
and billions of dollars and countless human lives in a in a war of utility for
no purpose whatsoever
against the country that now we admit had no weapons of my destruction
wasn't connected to al-Qaeda wasn't connected to nine eleven wasn't a threat
to us wasn't forty five minutes away from the bridge with their uh... nuclear
and chemical weapons and biological in all a partridge in a pair of three
but uh... your mama you know that's basically what it was down to you know like
it can it it's worth it
they're right

Oomba-doo-doo-rye we drop the bomb of love.
Thursday brainwashed the public to love bush like a god.
Here stand your high jack of the US for all your worker buddies who get
anything you want you come to them and tell them give democracy a chance
and you fill in your plunder for oil water and natural gas.
Oomba-doo-doo-rye we drop the bomb of love.
What's a few dead babies say did it suffer long?
We sure showed them a thing or two my country right or wrong.
Oomba-doo-doo-rye we drop the bomb of love.
And the wait boy.
Liberation by elimination man it works like a charm 1133-560 WNN
before you jump on that bandwagon.
Yeah huh.
No I did read this and I thought now would be a propitious time to pass it along
because the people need to know see another reason that they're all gung-ho for
where Sly Clark is because they don't know too much about him except he has a big
mouth and talked a lot during the war on MSNBC right.
Of course we know how many people walked MSNBC.
But third man.
Where in hell he was on maybe he was on CNN I think he was on
I mean well he's always open in the mouth.
But anyway Katrina Van Den Hovel who writes in the nation
her editorial here's an excerpt that somebody faxed me the other day remember a
couple days ago like on Monday.
In June 12 1999 and the immediate aftermath of NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia a small contingent of Russian troops dashed to occupy the
Christina Airfield in Kosovo.
Clark was so anxious to stop the Russians that he ordered an airborne assault
to confront these units in order which could have unleashed the most
frightening showdown with Moscow since the end of the Cold War.
War hyperbole you can decide but British general Michael Jackson the three-star
general and commander of K-4 the international force organized
and commanded by NATO to enforce an agreement in Kosovo told Clark
sir I'm not starting World War III for you when refusing to accept his order
to prevent Russian forces from taking over the airport.
Jackson was rightly worried that any precipitous NATO action
could risk a confrontation with a nuclear armed Russia and upset the NATO-led
peacekeeping plan just getting underway with the withdrawal of Serbian forces
from Kosovo.
Indeed it is in military circles that Clark's pristine incident was the
final straw that led the Pentagon to relieve him of his duties actually
be tear him earlier.
Clark had also angered the Pentagon brass and secretive defense William
Cohen in particular with his numerous media appearances and repeated
public requests for more weapons and for more freedom to wage the
Kosovo war the way he wanted with ground troops.
At one point according to media reports the defense secretary Cohen through
chairman of joint steves of staff he was sheldon to her Clark
to get your effing face off TV.
How do you like that?
He told Clark to get your effing face off TV.
So I don't want to say he might be kind of a media hound maybe a little
bit trigger happy all of these things but just something to think about okay
before you start jumping in with both feet and get all excited and
whipped up into a frenzy okay okay yeah but okay
supreme allied commander okay how can you beat that you can't beat the
supreme's so he's got he's got a big leader he's got
89 votes Wesley Clark 89 who'd you like to see as the
Democratic candidate against W howardine 64 I don't care they all suck 59

good job but it was coal miners man huh hey you have to be a thinking man to

WQM homestem of the most embarrassing crap in history of broadcast
Speaking of embarrassing and I use the term broadcasting loosely yes Deborah Perillo stop
Faxing you crazy bitch 20-page
Fashion nonsense just stuff that you've gotten before yeah stacks and stacks
Hey, Deborah, for ways that our fax paper you psychotic bitch you idiot you simple person you Miguel should be there by now
Would you think of the shell station for the probably the other way he said it was raining captain duwigs?
That's gonna like we don't want to get rained down. It's gonna rain on our charade here on our parade
Well, that's not well. Whatever we get well get you know somebody will show up
What else are they gonna do bring your raincoat and your trench coat and your rubbers and bring your rubbers because Miguel will be there ready for action
Right you wouldn't want to get after well
He doesn't want to come back anytime soon because he said if he shows up before too. He's got a rim durin
So I don't think I'll be back anytime soon
Well, you never confused him with the rimmer did you?
Oh my no
Oh my no I saw him pick up a check so I know it ain't him
Oh my
You're an embarrassment. Okay, you're a good guy. I like you. It's nothing personal but my god
And you know something he's perfect for the University of Miami
Here they got a choice between a consummate professional who got screwed over by Moe by the way and the dolphin organization
Absolutely Bill Zimper who did out yeoman work an excellent job on the dolphins nine seasons with the mad dog and was was available to do
You have him football
And the University being the typical bush Lake Neanderah. Oh, no
We want to have the same guy doing all of our sports and we want Josie
Fits in perfectly with the entire ambience of the University of Miami
Donna no ball Shalala and a whole thing over there in the Gables makes me want to puke, okay?
Donna you sick idiotic bitch
Oh, that's the most disgusting thing I ever saw get our name off that billboard right away. We've got balls
You got no balls honey although rumors were they had big ones. That's what bubble was saying even Joseph press
Oh my oh my here's a fact from Lisa in North Miami says what would knowing where Iraq is on a map
Two knowing what's really going on in the world because you all read prove
Oh
It would make it any easier for anyone if we knew about it or not
I see now why you and George take drugs because you concern yourselves with all that negative crap and it pisses y'all off
This has got to be phony it is I don't care where Iraq is nor do I want to have so much more to say
But thought you might not read this right phony and this is the same as the was it Tracy that day? Yeah, phony name here
Building code compliance my ass fake facts. Yeah another fake facts from a fake Lisa for the y'all y'all read y'all god hang on what y'all got Lisa, which probably
much
56705 60 is I'm not depressed about anything. I'm a happy camper. Wait you may. I'm happy. He's happy again. Slop
It's sloppy. Oh, I'm a little bit upset about the fact Joseph Gackie is on WQM doing anything
I mean like I said nice got to have around give my paycheck just to keep him you know him is a lovely wife to have to eat now and in
Wesley carts got 99 votes who'd you like to see is democratic presidential candidate next year Wesley parked 99
374 votes all told howardine 67 I don't care. They all suck 61. I don't care. I'm for bush 52 13.9 percent
Oh Bob Graham 49 John Kerry 13 now sharpened in 12 John Edwards 11 Dennis Kassin is forward to give hard for
Carol Mosley Braun one Julie Berman one see the fact that we got out of this audience almost
14% for bush that tell what about we said he could hold a
I have speech you could go on national TV on worldwide TV 9 o'clock tonight on all the networks even on a Playboy TV and
Look you straight in the camera with that goofy look on his face with a furrowed brow and say I lied to you
All those people who died over there including the ones who are still dying including your sons and daughters
It was all for an off and based on a lie. We had this planned long time ago
Me all my neocon pals and it wasn't I was still tomorrow was still be 14% right
So it ties right in with what we were saying about little bit stupidity
Just like the Arnold business always Arnold Schwarzenegg is going to be governor of California maybe based on what?
And then of course this debate is going to participate in you'll notice that of course it's going to be a little bit on time
We were the auction coming up March 4th probably now unless they change that
Must they overturn a court's decision
But the fact of the matter is that they they have to have the questions and writing so they can make the answers up for him
ahead of time because he doesn't have any answers. He doesn't have any positions. He doesn't have any qualifications
But he'd rather pump than come
Work time is not such a bad idea pumping them coming in California
Whatever the hell that means
Oh Jesus God and Chrysler Motors almighty
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line
It's a good thing we got that big one in two comedy bits our day

Now, but I I'm smarter. Yeah, I took off Friday. Mm-hmm
That'll show you here's Miami. Hello
Hey, new hey pretty good sir. Hey, Neil listen. I want you to know you always bring a big smile to my push
And but please I'm gonna ask you to please I need a favor for you. Please. No, please don't claim those Joseph Gatti bits
Every time I hear that guy's voice I get like ulcers in my stomach. Yeah, please we can't listen to him
Oh
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60
Oh my
On the AT&T of Verizon wireless line just a wild screaming out of control maniac
I guess that's supposed to compensate for ability, you know
Hey, I'm your friend. I'm your friend. Ain't it the same thing while you're of ability. Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello
Hello, yes sir. Hi, Neil. Hi, how are you today great sensational man. Uh great. Yeah, I just want to say something
Uh, and and the same way to some of your talks about the weather and the hurricane and stuff
The weather out here in Hollywood beach is excellent right now. I mean all and the weather here at Toronto is beautiful
It's sunny in the 72
I know but all the liquid moves, you know this morning on TV you had like there's eight to ten foot
And six to eight foot seas and uh like I'm a lifeguard on Hollywood beach and the water here is just really flat
There's a little bit of a a kind of running north to south for it's a beautiful base
I hope that the people just come on out and come on down the beach and enjoy
Okay, you know, and uh, and also teddy bears develop on your part that man that did so much for national parts
Imagine imagine what would happen if we didn't have them do that for us
I can't even begin to imagine it you know what
Not think about that you know the Indians probably felt the same way about it. Yeah
All right, anyway, thank you Neil God bless for now. I have a great day. You enjoy Hollywood chamber commerce. Thanks you profusely
All right, you're welcome Neil. Good for you. I think you know, I'm not thinking yesterday the Hollywood chamber commerce
Well, he's putting in a good plug. You know, we want to see some naked people out there in the beach damn straight
Well, some of them and maybe some of them not
By who's your favorite dead political figure? We have no interest in this pool. And that's okay because uh Eric said say I told Eric was
Dicking with the show see that's a Eric emailed me to say that he got a whole bunch of suggestions
I last night on the pool
Because he put it on there for people to be able to put in their studio, which I put Bobby Kenvy on there by the way
Eric I was the one and you put one into right
So that's but but anyway by doing that see that would have been about 30 calls
We would have had from people suggesting as opposed to like doing it on the website
So he's dickin with a program here while making it nice and easy for now Eric so don't interfere, okay?
Like Mama Kolioni said to Santino don't interfere
Remember that when we were having dinner at the table and he was given the lecture to a carlo about don't ever do that right
Santino don't interfere
She knew that that the hot tempered Santino man. They shot him on the causeway
Yeah
Done Koli home
And anyway, let's just play the audio from the godfather the rest of the three years. I said that sounds good to me
Huh, we're just gonna play godfather drop-ins
It's not only
That's what your brain is doing, so I know I'm with you straight up
You broke my heart
You broke my heart
It leaves it good
Take a look at all this see this is what pisses old
Seenow Mo off real big time
And he knows that he knows in a part of his brain what used to be it was under the a muskrat there the weasel
He knows that I could actually play godfather drops her next to three years
What's ever left on his deal and still get the gigantic numbers over what he is pathetic good
That's what every school man. This is what really has got to frost his saddle there. I don't care how many day go
You know what grease ball come boys come out of the wood one see and you could play the same drop-ins mole
But the difference would be nobody would listen when you play it. That's the bottom
There you go
Nice mentally from the godfather
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 your favorite dead political figure the list we have so far Paul wellstone Thomas pain
George Washington Bobby Kennedy Abe Lincoln Abe Lincoln
Teddy Roosevelt FDR Thomas Jefferson Martin Luther King and JFK that's the list we have so far to which you folks have edited one
I mean see if we had a really cerebral audience they'd be saying well James Madison because he was really uh huh keep drilling
What cerebral audience? How about John Quincy Adams?
How about it like to show how about James Knox poke
You poke he was kind of poke say I like any I do believe
And he liked his poke a pick it a poke no he liked his poke oh maybe that was Franklin pierce who they said like this
But was a Franklin pierce or James Buchanan who was never married and we're always rumors about that that we had a close-out
Before my time it was one of them it was either 14 which was Franklin pierce or 15 James you have I think was Franklin pierce
And there were stories there were rumors being spread
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line here's for Lauderdale. Hello
Neil God yes sir by the way it was James Buchanan it was the a Mary President
Really that was why I said I would knew was either him or Franklin pierce right hey um you know
Did you ever get a chance to read uh the David Halper stamp book or in a time of peace no
Yeah, that's the book that really details a lot of what went on in in the coastal battle
And I think it gives a real good balance and and a objective view of of Clark's role in that battle
The the editorial that you read from the nation. I think gives kind of the one-sided view of some of the
The press manipulation that was going on during that war night
And I think it's fair to say that Clark
Was going to play the press to get to bring attention to a lot of the
To a lot of the bad things that were going on in the cost world the press was not paying attention
Okay, so a lot of the atrocities came out. I mean, I'm not saying he's perfect by any means and I'm not saying that
I'm even no, I'm not saying that I necessarily believe but somebody fasted to me the day in the nation obviously is a credible publication
And I want to really because I want to put all the stuff out there and then people can pick and choose and believe what they want
Right and and when I'm saying was the Halper stamp book is is basically I think it presents a
It presents a very balanced set in the present the words and all to be honest with you
I highly recommend it. Okay, um and and also for the uh for the poll for the dead politicians
Uh, I think I'd like to nominate the person that ran the the country during the 1980s
Nancy Reagan's astrologer. She is dead by the way
And have a great day
And Nancy's astrologer that was excellent
I beg your pardon. I said that's good news and that was a great call
That was a great call. We're not put that on there of course because we don't know what the name was
Nobody we know who there's anyway just like they don't know where the goddamn Indian Ocean is or where India's or Sri Lanka is
I always like to say line, you know when I was collecting stamps
See that's a problem. I thought I was learning something about the world that they went and changed how they changed
In terms of all the damn countries piss me off me. What that was in Bobway, you know what what is that?
Whatever happened to the good old Belgian Congo, huh?
That was my favorite Congo. Go pull it up my up on go so we can all go to the Congo

Blitz says Iraq probably destroyed WMDs
Former UN weapons chief weapons inspector Hans Blitz
Belief that Iraq destroyed most of its weapons of mass destruction 10 years ago
But kept up the appearance that it had them to the tour military attack and interview with the australian radio station broadcast today
Blitz said it was unlikely that the US and British teams now searching for weapons in Iraq would find
More than some documents of interest
Interest as I used to say interest
I'm certainly more and more of the conclusion that Iraq has as they maintain destroyed all almost of what they had in the summer of 91
Blitz told australian broadcast in corp radio
The more time that has passed tomorrow I think it's unlikely that anything will be found
He be saying
Looks indicated he thought the west led coalition had backtracked on the issue of Iraq's weapons
In the beginning they talked about weapons concretely and later on they talked about weapons programs
Maybe they'll find some documents of interest. He said is that like persons of interest like Steven Hadfield
We got persons of interest and now we got documents of interest
I mean you can put a sign up on your door beware of the dog without having a dog you said from his home in Sweden

What's this important thing coming over from chronic Jane
She says I liked how her dean but now I want Wesley Clark
He was first in his class at Westpoint. He was a Rhodes scholar like Bill Clinton
And he was a professor of economics at Westpoint. He knows how to handle the military
I think a Clark Dean ticket will be ideal or Clark Graham ticket
But you know Graham's unheard of right love percentage, but he has a snowball's chance to know you're right about that Jane
Please check out WW Miss leader.org. They're documenting Bush's lies somebody else facts that already
I'll let's check it out like that one. I checked out yesterday was good to read that one about what was it
What was it? I don't know
Some were the anti-religious but there was nothing there we could use but it was good
It was all the anti
babbling crap
Anyway, it says there's a channel on satellite TV a call link that has some really interesting shows about the world and is nonprofit
Link that or
Says jena for lord of chronic Jane. Thank you chronic Jane
Anyway, can I get back to Johnny depth important thing good you would nobody cares about the fact that we have a bunch of
Functionally literates who have no idea what any see this is the thing about americans because education system is such crap
Americans because of the geographical isolation
Think they can be comfortably ignorant they know nothing about the rest of the world unlike almost any place else
Where they're very familiar with the rest of the world generally because most of the already place else
They're close to the rest of the world comfortably dumb although the Canadians here
I don't know why they know so much about the rest of the world because the only thing they're close to is like the north pole in the US
And yet the education system here is heads and shoulders heads and shoulders above the USA
How do you like that
Ha ha
Johnny depth has made another transformation it says oddball acted to box office money maker
The star known for playing eccentric and cult favorite such as Ed Wood which is so much
Too long and fear unloading in Las Vegas is establishing himself as a major box office draw with two films this weekend at the top five
Once upon a time in Mexico as opposed to once upon a time in America which lasts for about seven and a half hours
What's upon a time in Mexico staring Antonio Banderas is a
Marriachi musician gunslinger and depth is a sleazy c.i. agent debuted in first place with
$24 million of Quinn industry estimates on Sunday
It was Johnny's second consecutive number one debut after the summertime hit pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl
Which George said the movie suck but Johnny was good right
Pirates still performing strong in its 10th week of release came in number five at 4.6 million
So in other words Johnny depth is in two of the top five money making films of the week
Number one and number five in the same weekend
It says for any actor that's great and for Johnny depth. It's totally unexpected and welcome
Depas had blockbusters before such as sleepy hollow chocolate and modest hits like Edward Siserhands and Donnie Brasco
But they've been few and far between the respected but little seen cult films like Dead Man
Ed Wood, Benny and June and fear unloading in Las Vegas. I forgot that you say you ever finally saw Donnie Brasco
All right, Johnny Brasco is great. You can be you shouldn't me man. That's a outstanding flick
We need to start talking about movies again. I know I missed that you want to know the reason being that I
It inspired me to watch so many good ones and now that we don't talk about it
I've got about a half dozen year other room. I haven't watched yet well get to it
I haven't watched a snatch oh such is good. I'll wait and the movie too. Yeah
Oh, and you which reminds me now maybe this is the hour when I can actually put some audio on here in the background
You think maybe
Oh, now what I just saw
Whoa if you could have seen what I just saw huh that's got that instrument that's it
Man no you haven't seen that
All right listen to it. This is the last one
Listen to the watch though
There was her name whatever it was
Chrissy Chrissy don't just because it ended in SSY. Yeah, don't get all bent out of shape. Okay. Okay. Pressy about it
Don't get Chrissy and don't be a sissy. Okay. It was just the Chrissy and she was just having a little fun
I just don't dare you know we have the dump now. What was the movie with the uh the spit girl that with Johnny Depp?
Oh, that was crybaby
Because it's so embarrassing
Bearest
Yeah, so anyway Johnny Depp our Hall and Dale or Miramar were the hell was boy who used to once a part of time
He was out on his luck down on his luck slept in his car actually at one point

O'Connagong County Sheriff's Deputy seeking a person on an outstanding warrant broke down the door into the wrong home
And then jolted a man with a taser in front of his wife and child
Oh, it sounds like a stop floor to think done oh yeah, it happens there all the time
Sheriff Frank Rogers says the bottom line is officers messed up is what he said
No one was seriously injured in the incident the heavily armed officers apparently burst into the wrong trailer at the
Homestead trailer park at O'Mac that's not homestead or it's homestead washroom
The man they were seeking 30-year-old Joseph M. Peresian heard the ruckus and tried to escape from another trailer
He was arrested without incident. He heard the ruckus
Don't you love that word the ruckus we get right in with trailer parks and stuff like that
We're not knocking anybody out there lives in a trailer park just because they call you trailer trash
Don't take it personal although I think they might have a point
And who let me ask you this who picks up the trailer trash

Clark says his career has pointed to the presidency.
So the audience so far seems to be a stoop, at least he would think so.
Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Commander, told CNN he'll kick off his run
for the Democratic presidential nomination with an announcement today, which we already knew that.
This is what my expertise, my leadership experience, my whole career has put in prepared me for Clark said,
in an interview with CNN's American Morning on Wednesday morning today, this morning.
I've had a lot of diplomatic experience.
I've had a lot of work with security policy.
I think I'm the best person to look at the future of this country and keep us safe.
Park 58 becomes the 10th Democrat, seeking to once he president Bush, his West Point graduate, road scholar,
former CNN, CNN, CNN told it wasn't the, I was wrong, we'll see it in in, that's why everybody saw him.
Former CNN military analyst who led US and allied forces in NATO's 1999 air war in Kosovo
asked about the fact that he never held elective office.
He said his move is ambitious, but it also is an extraordinary era.
Questioned about how he can market himself in his campaign without a record on domestic issues Clark said on Wednesday,
that he has the same experience that everybody else does when it comes to grappling with the issue as a citizen.
He said he worries about health care, education, unemployment, other life issues as voters do.
He said when he was in the military, he dealt with quality of life and personnel issues, such as housing education and health care for our people is what he said.
Responding to comments that he was abrasive and not well liked by others in the military, Clark said the environment was competitive.
It's a competitive bureaucracy he said, people enter it at the bottom, they come out at the top.
There's a lot of gossip and some sharp elbows in there, but I think my record stands on its own mirrors.
And if you look at what I've done, the contributions that I've made, it's a very solid record and I'm proud of what he said.
And you'll notice the Arkansas connection here.
Is there?
In the fact that Bubba and Hillary and the other Clinton connections are people who are now his advisors and Bubba supposedly pulling some strings behind the scenes, you notice?
Uh-huh.

I mean, I think I was in fifth grade at the time.
It was pulled off a Y100 for some kind of altercation.
I don't know if it was child molestation or something.
No, he didn't have any child molestation thing.
You're confusing him with the Bill Tanner right there.
It's not seriously.

and Carol Mosley Brown has got three out of 190 votes.
That's the way it stacks up right now.
They like Wesley Clark and they still want to know where's the Pacific Ocean.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello, this is near.
Yes, sir.
Uh, near.
I don't know what to give my name.
I'm calling from California.
Yes, sure.
Uh, I need to be.
Okay, good.
5670560.
I told you they ran out of material all of a sudden right at noon when the little hand at the big hand.
That was it.
That was the time to put on the goddamn leaf scale.
My totally be a hell of a lot more entertaining.
Oh, and you're in a commercial break.
Let's do Miami.
When is this?
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil, I just wanted to tell you I'm, I'm 33 years old.
I'm Cuban American born right here.
I fed into that, uh, the involve thing for the last, you know, 10 years of my life.
They're both Republican.
After Bush, I changed to Democrat.
This guy Clark, he excites me.
I think everybody that, uh, that doesn't know the title of this.
They should listen to the guy.
I mean, the guy makes sense on everything he talks about.
I think the fact that he's an outsider will give us some fresh blood into into the old, you know, GOP and the good old boys mentality in there.
And I hope anybody that has, you know, a clear vision can really sit down and really look at the value that this guy has.
Because he's going to be our next president.
You think so, huh?
Definitely, Neil.
You know, how, how many times have you seen a, a military guy, a four-star general, nonetheless, you know, be a Democrat and speak so intelligently about things?
The guy just makes sense.
He makes sense about everything he talks about.
I, I said to my wife a number of times when I see him on CNN as a commentary, as, as, as one of their hosts.
I said, it's only this guy who runs for president and, you know, God was listening.
God was listening.
I think, yeah, God was listening right.
Okay, God, good luck to pal.
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you.
He said, God was listening.
How do you like that?
He sure ain't listening to Pat Robertson because that storm, I think, is going to wipe out Virginia beat.
Already second now.
It just took a little rock and roll there to the right.
Look at that.
Which would allow a person's strengthening.
Yes, see?
Oh, oh, oh.
I think Pat Robertson drew the Lord's attention there and, and maybe he misunderstood.
Okay, maybe God's got like a little hearing problem today.
Like what's your name?
Like Mrs. Wallace on passions?
Maybe his hearing aid fell out?
And he thought Pat Robertson is saying, please, please send that right here to Virginia Beach.
Right over my ass would be good.
That's what he was asking God to do.
And I think God might just fulfill his wish with a big blow.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.
And Verizon Wireless Line.
And the best part of the whole deal is that the media continues taking these people seriously
and presenting them like some kind of respectable significant, yeah.
Jerry Fowlball and Jimmy Swagrid and Pat Robertson and all these other grave robbers.
I guess Pat's still a little bit upset about Charles Taylor.
You know, I can't make no more diamond deals in Liberia.
Here's Tamarack.
Hello.
Tamarack.
I think Tamarack floated away.
Let's try Boker.
Hello.
Media, how are you today?
Pretty good, sir.
I heard, I was in New York on business last week and I heard Sean Hannity's radio show on WABC.
How do you press against?
The biggest right wing A-hole in the history of the world.
He was talking about, he said except for Bill O'Reilly, him and Russ Rimbabwe,
there was no intelligence talk radio in the United States if they should,
that they all are bunch of pinko, democratic, left-wing fanatics.
How do you like that?
And well, why would you waste your time listening to him and ask him like that?
I was flipping.
He said that it was drove off the road.
I mean, is he the biggest fastest you've ever heard?
No, he's not the biggest.
He's what of no.
I would just say.
He's an asshole.
They said he has the best ratings in New York, the band of any radio show.
Well, calm down.
Just be glad you don't live in New York.
Okay, I am.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.
By the way, speaking of ratings, those trends come out tomorrow, man.
It's going to be, this wrinkled up, dried up, old, fag, man.
We're going to have big numbers.
I can smell it.
Can you smell it?
Oh, that.
You can always smell a big number from a lot of footer to a way, especially if it's
like in somebody's pants.
During the last break, I want you to know that I went in the other than the magic room,
you know what I did?
I don't want to know.
It's not nothing that you haven't done before.
I wiped my eye.
Oh, my brown eye.
Oh, jeez.
Well, no, I mean, I was thinking I was sitting here during the show thinking Jeepers creepers,
I think I've got some seepers.
Well, no, when you're fat, when you're fat, you're not.
Right.
I know.
Sometimes you seep a little out and you just play the lot.
I don't know.
You just have to go in the smell.
You'll license really clean everything.
No, boy, tell, that's really good for that.
How about some tucks?
Sure, if you don't have a bidet.
I do not have a bidet, but I think it's in the works.
19 to 1 at 5, 60 W. Kim, we got our thank goodness Wednesday, 1 to 2 hour boy.
The timing couldn't possibly be better the way this thing is going today.
You know, it's that time of the year again when the mattress rooms and furniture stores run
their phony ad sales.
Dallama actress will ask you this.
If you double the price, offer half off.
Is that really a deal?
No.
Of course not.
Fact is that those stores have to run a sale of their prices nearly as low as Dallama actress sells them each
in every day, 365 days a year.
For this count, prices on dozens of models from the top names in a bin of cili,
surre, temper, pete, ximines, king coral, orster, and foster,
call 1-800-MACRUS-1-800-MATTRES.
No nonsense, no bait and switch, no house, brands, no falls, promises and best of all,
you don't have to pay a premium for the best service available anywhere.
You get service like you've only dreamed about from the delivery team ranked number one in customer satisfaction.
When you call Dallama actress 1-800-MACRUS, don't forget, you pick the day and time you're delivery
within a two-hour window seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.
and they'll be sleeping like a baby well the first night, whoever it is.
I've been sleeping on a mattress for about a year, you ought to be doing the same thing.
If the old mattress is lumpy, bumpy, worn out if your back is taking a beating,
here's the way to solve the problem.
With low prices, same day delivery, if you set up and remove the loads easy to see why,
Dallama actress is ranked numero uno in customer satisfaction.
So don't be fooled by those mattress storms or furniture stirrads.
They can't come close to matching all the service and deals you get from Dallama actress.
Pick up the phone and call them right now. They'll be knocking on your door.
No time at all once convenient for you.
1-800-MACRUS, 1-800-MATTRES, or online, it's mattress.com.
My, I, and local, here's sports radio 560's, you a.m.
By the way, I've been giving it some thoughts.
Oh, what do you think it is?
I know that me and you can do much better, go in 6 to 10 and not in 5.
Again, Thailand, the cranky too.
I think we might be happy to get there.
I think you really got out of your mind.
You got to have your weary bag.
Strap on to tight.
No chance I'll do a show with you.
I'd rather die.
We'd be crappy together.
Why, I'll have you know that I'm a big puppy too.
From Brooklyn High.
I've been raped by everybody but you.
You're not by time.
Me and Mow, this is that wood blow.
No way that it, we had a fight.
That you'd survive.
Who'd wanna hear a genital.
And push it back.
That's crappy together.
I'm so glad I was born.
I'm so glad I was born.
I'm so glad I was born.
I'm so glad I was born.
I'm so glad I was born.
I'm so glad I was born.
And so would you and me for me is much better, 6 to 10 and not in 5.
It's only right that I should get more sleep tonight.
I think we might.
Be happy together.
Happy together.
What's out there, baby?
What's out there?
What's out there?
What's out there?
What's out there?
What's out there?
What's out there?
What's out there?
What's out there?
General Clarks went out to 1 p.m.
He's running.
I guess it's kind of like anti-climate.
What happened to my audio in here during that break sky?
Was that like your screw up or was that something?
The audio got quiet all of a sudden.
Oh, it's on that end.
Right.
Not another technical problem on that end.
Oh, they crap on you.
Maybe something will happen.
Now you're going to be shocked by this.
What?
This is going to really please you.
Or like you wouldn't believe.
Before you get into that.
Yes, 340 at the site.
It ain't raining where he is, but it's storming cats and doogs here.
And...
It's sunny and beautiful here right now, but Friday we're getting to the end of the hurricane, yeah?
This room is filling up with the weirdest smell I've smelled in years, and I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
Hey, that...
Hey, God, it's not recognizable as anything I've ever smelled before.
Hmm.
Mystery smell.
Maybe scurrying's hovering in the hallway.
I've smelled that before.
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
340 bucks.
So what's our total?
Do we have any idea?
I mean this thing...
The gray hole?
Yeah.
No.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Okay, Miguel is at the corner of Brewer Boulevard in the University Drive on a shell-stating in the QM van.
No, down here are hip-boots.
Miguel just called in.
It is raining by him.
He said it's still 340.
So, which is nobody there?
Partly.
I see.
Well, that's pretty damn weak for your best meal merchandise.
I don't think we're going to even make 25 grand this year.
We had like 22 something.
I don't think if we keep going to El Janie we're going to make it.
Sure.
We'll aim.
Anyway, here's some exciting news with the next three Super Bowl's visiting new stadiums in O'Cales, not known as Winter Destinations.
Houston, Jacksonville, and Detroit.
NFL Commissioner Paul Taglia-Boo was hoping to return to it from India Warmer Host City in 2007,
which is why NFL owners are expected to approve bringing football's big game back to pro player stadium when they meet the 7th in the Washington DC.
2007.
The Commissioner said we wanted to go back to some place that was a warm weather site that had the experience of hosting Super Bowls before it's a Jim Steege.
NFL Senior Vice President of Special Events.
So, this afternoon they'll make it formal.
Now, this fact you sent me really porks my ass.
That piece of Schmidt footy made a comment regarding Cox's passing away.
That's disrespectful to talk ill of the dead.
It says F footy and his Schmidt selling barbecue sauce.
Footies got barbecue sauce?
So, they say.
Oh, see.
I hope he sticks it up his leg.
Oh, God.
That's the secret ingredient.
I'm not going to get upset about it because it's so typical.
Sunset and the league knows it all together.
We got people on here making all kinds of caustic, negative, or comments.
The only people called in here want to know what he got busted for and what kind of negative...
They had to cut soft foot.
Don't blame it on me.
All these years I keep an ony-less, so negative.
I'm not negative.
The town is negative.
That's all they know is negativity.
They thrive on it on a hostility.
Just like the guy that spent like three minutes there when a big build up about his dead mother-in-law,
whatever the hell it was, and then gives me a saw and answer about some dried-up fag crap.
Very weak by the way.
From now on, do it right off the bat.
Don't waste our time.
Do you want to call in and say, you suck more power to you, but get it out of the way.
Here's a lady in Jupiter.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to speak to Neil.
Speaking.
Hi.
How are you?
I just moved into up by Jupiter from Miami, and you're absolutely correct.
The crap in Miami is horrendous.
It's so much nicer up here in Jupiter.
That's the middle name in South Florida.
I just wanted to let you know that I think you're great.
I've been listening to you for years.
This is the first time I've called.
And you speak your mind, oh, and Mr. Buds, and I just think you're great.
And I wanted to let you know.
I am great.
I'm also with in reference to George.
Yes.
You know, he's with all due respect, George.
You're not Neil.
You know, he's like so hard to be.
What a sucker.
He said, you bitch.
He said, you bitch.
I'm okay.
Whoever said he was me.
Either you bitch.
Yeah, see that?
He's like this guy.
He's like so hard to be funny, but he's not.
I don't have funny.
He's like hard to be funny, bitch.
He did okay.
What do you work, decent job?
You know, I'm not.
Oh, well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have a great day, sweetheart.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, bitch.
She's hostile and she moved to Jupiter.
And of course, George is very pleased about that.
Very straightforward.
Maybe that was down.
Maybe that was that aroma.
Oh, maybe it's coming down from Jupiter.
See, I need these calls where you want to suck my ass in and rip George, or the other way, right?
It's so, it's just a waste of time.
Oh, you know, it's old and boring and ponderous.
You know, oh, you're so great.
I'm not impressed by that.
I know how good I am.
I know how well I've done for almost the...
About third amazin' his town.
I don't know.
I hear the other crap that's on a year.
I don't need that.
It's not interesting if I'm listening to a show.
Oh, hi, Larry.
Your show is so entertaining.
You're so wonderful.
You ask all the right questions, you know, stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
Terminal, it's ponderous.
It's like for old people, you know?
Hey, Neil.
I'm not an easy one.
I'm not an easy one.
I'm not an easy one.
I'm not an easy one.
And by the way, George, you suck and you're well else than she say you're like...
I'm not me.
And you're not funny.
Well, we know you're not.
I don't know what they're supposed to be.
He's George, okay?
He didn't find you out this summer.
We took a poll on that and like a few people said they like...
About third amazin'.
And about 5,000 said they say, yeah, whatever.
Whatever it is.
If you don't like it when he's on, don't listen.
That's all I...
It's like the barking at the moon at dog again, you know?
I just don't understand people like that.
When he's on, it's pretty obvious.
You know, if I'm not there, if it's a summertime,
if I take a day off like last Friday in Georgia's show,
Hey, if you don't like him, if you don't like me, bye-bye.
That's never bothered me.
This is the last time I'm listening.
Great.
You know, I'm not going to change the show for one asshole
that calls inner five assholes.
Or 50 of them.
Maybe...
About third amazin'.
That might do it.
But it's just ridiculous.
You know, this colonel talk showed it like bellyic
and it's like I said negative, negative, negative, negative.
And she's talking about crap in Miami.
How do you like that?
Give a love.
Yeah, feel the love.
I can feel it all the way up here.
I hate to break the news to you.
I don't want to get you all depressed and bed out of shape.
But I'm looking out there's not a cloud this guy.
It's sunny, it's 72 degrees.
It's going to be 77 this afternoon.
There's not a chance of rain.
And so you know what Friday afternoon we'll get the ass end of Isabel.
And Big Deal will survive it.
We survived SARS twice here.
We survived the goddamn West Nile and the Amad Cow
and the attainted meat and the goddamn blackout and everything else.
And we'll survive it.
Everybody here still walks around with a smile on their face
and they hold the door open for you.
And they say hello on the elevator.
And they're friendly and are decent and they're like human beings,
as opposed to you know, like that.
So if anybody wants to know why I love Toronto so much
or like I almost anywhere that's not South Florida,
it's because it's not South Florida.
Because the people are civilized and they're like,
have some cool but the which side is up and which side is down.
And they seem generally speaking to get along together.
All these different people, these schmottaheds and Chinese
and whatever the hell they are.
Just people.
And suppose the South Florida everybody hates each other.
Oh, speak English, speak English.
You know, yeah.
And I'm sorry.
Like crap and silly crews at the stadium.
Oh God.
You can't call Miami a third world country like a tenth world place
with that Ilyana Rosanna, Dana bitch.
All this other crap going on.
That Jose Basuto.
Always the same old tired garbage man.
Hacking the same baloney.
All those people playing in Fats Domino Park.
135 votes for Wesley Clark rhymes with Fats Domino Park.
Who'd you like to see as Democratic presidential candidate next year?
Wesley Clark 135.
I don't care.
They all suck.
See there's what I'm talking about.
103 said they all suck.
That's nice.
18.9%.
Howard D 96, Bob Graham 71.
I don't care. I'm from Bush 64, 11.7%.
Shame on you.
Shame on you.
Get yourself an IQ test.
Get yourself a brain transplant.
John Kerry 19, L. Sharpton 18.
John Edwards 13.
Dennis Cassinij 8.
Dick Gebhardt 7 people in this audience are for Dick.
Jew Lieberman 6.
And Carol Mosley Braun out of 543 votes.
She's still sitting on three.
Look at that on the Playboy channel.
They're sitting on two to what?
Two big 1256 at 560 WQ and two big for Clarence is what he said.
He ran like a son of a bitch.
Maybe that's what you smell.
Maybe those are the actor burners leaving that aroma.
Hey, if you're looking for a great playstead breakfast lunch,
you didn't let me tell you about Vickoners.
And I'm looking across the lake right now.
Look at that.
There's Rochester.
There's Vic.
There's Erv.
You know, I wonder if there really was a Vickoner.
You know what?
I wonder if there was a Don and Bob.
Anyway, Vickoner is from my hometown of Rochester.
I ate there a zillion times.
And loved it.
Vickoner has been around since 1934.
And a good news for people in South Florida who love those white hats
and all their other Rochester food.
Vickoner is located on federal highway.
Just south of Barred Boulevard of the tunnel on the east side.
Vickoners is a flashback to time when restaurants were really a great
before the fast food came along.
Go and enjoy a real hamburger or hot dog served hot fresh and fast.
Vickoner versus Brought to Florida.
They'll buy the same guys who feed you Cheeberg or Cheeberg.
Vickoner versus uses the same fresh 100% ground chuck meat as Cheeberg or Cheeburger.
And offers an incredible quarter pound hot dog.
You have had a wiener in your life and you're a pus in a long time like that.
What makes Vickoner is different from anybody else in town.
I'm glad you asked because the burgers and dogs are served with
the Vick signature meat sauce poured on top, giving you a combination of flavors available
no place else in town.
So if you're looking for something else to try, Vickoner versus a lot kinds of great dishes,
including great breakfast menu, omelettes, cooked to order, French toast, pancakes,
all your favorite side dishes too.
So stop by Vickoner versus whether you're from Rochester or not.
You'll still love it and see what all it's all about.
Vickoner is on federal highway.
Just south of Barred Boulevard of the tunnel on the east side.
Be sure to tell them that old Neil Rogers from a wiener driving Brighton sent you by to Vickoner.
My life and love, this is 435 City.
Way to A.M.
On a span of since Fearless Vida has won Natasha in I know-Lo
to have to look for a motion squirt.
Instead we listen to the Neil Rogers parent and balance went to two hours.
Like this swish boom!
I love it and it would not have asked me to swish boom!
My co-worker Charlie, he's a real character.
For the man, how you doing?
Hey great game, us, Nina!
Some balls ever seen the next shoot better than the last night.
I mean it was like boom three points, boom three points,
time to get boom three points, they're taking it home right now.
Love to talk sports at work.
Pretty much all the time.
The guy pops to the infield right, lets you go right, roll style field,
they drive it, meanwhile the dogs just bring another one home right up,
taking a hootscoach in these guys, right?
That is, while the rest of us are trying to work for a living.
She'd be an exception last time, who was like, boom, we're going downtown,
answer on federal highway.
That's why I decided to tell Charlie about LaBadaville.
And over the counter medication made especially for overactive conversation lists.
Because my co-workers and I, well, we were concerned about Charlie.
Now with LaBadaville, Charlie can relax.
And we can get some work done, right Charlie?
Charlie?
Just blink your eyes twice if you can hear me Charlie, okay?
Okay Charlie, I'll wipe the drool.
Hey great game last night huh?
That's acting non-Jr. LaBadaville.
You don't need to make it.
My candidacy is all about big changes I commend them.
What about those orgies you had?
Outrageous.
What are your qualifications?
I have no experience, I'm a woman nice and I'm terrible, a terrible guy.
What's your plan?
Here's my plan.
I decided to get a bikini wax.
And then the end, the crazy deficits spending.
Oh!
It really comes down to this.
How?
Game over.
You from the makers of co-tests?
It's vibrates.
Fibrates.
The super absorbacy and convenience you expect from co-tests.
But with three speed vibrating action now that turns a week of mood swings, bloating
and cravings, into a week of smiles, squeals and shutters of delight.
Fibrates.
Each insert has a built-in mini vibrator powered by an energizer watch battery that keeps going
and going and going.
Just pull the string to change speeds from two to two.
So the next time your special friend pays you a visit, put a smile on her face.
From the makers of co-tests, it's vibrates.
Fibrates.
Just wait for the box to keep chopping up and down on the shelf.
And cruising, waiting, and you're jumping, G.T.
And show your bodies and hearts in the keys.
They feel like the sourcing cold, your dreams.
Feels like we're all too weak, please.
Guys who like halters and tank tops and short pants will have to wait for next year for our next
lance.
Can hang it, pulls in our speedos or briefs.
Those are a few of our favorite themes and a songer.
What's up, um?
Halt some scumbag blasts.
We'll just have to wait till it's warmer, I think.
Until you can see more ass.
Azia's weren't fine, and if our edition take one.
Hello sports fans, I'm Azia's born.
The Prince of F***ing Football.
This year looks like it's going to be exciting in the NFL.
One team to definitely watch out for are the Green Bay Packers.
Cut, Azia, that's Packers.
Oh?
Packers, Green Bay Packers.
Not Packers?
Okay, okay.
Okay, can we start again?
Can we start it over?
Give me a second.
In the AFC Central, you have to watch out for the upstart Cleveland Browns.
Browns?
What the f*** is a Brown?
Cut!
What?
How about those New England guys?
The f***ing Patriots or something like that?
That reminds me of when I was growing up in England.
Right in Birmingham.
We were poor family.
Azia, stick to the script if you can, please.
F*** you, I'm the Prince of F***ing Football.
Cut! Cut!
Shen!
Ah, David Brown.
In the AFC, you have to like the Falcons, the Bears, the Panthers and Lions.
Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm...
In line, it's a f***ing zoo.
Where all these f***ing Falcons and Panthers and s***.
Is this football or mutual or mama's wild f***ing kingdom?
Cut it!
That's all that's on the cue column, I know what do you want me to do about it.
That just raps my pants.
Let's all put this week on Azia's board.
The Bricks of F***ing Football.
Shen!
He's a super star.
In the AFC, you can name him.
He's keeping his pretty wife and children.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
He was a shy.
He's keeping his family.
He's keeping his family.
That day in Eagle Club Vado, he won the fast of Mauro.
But now he's changing his mind.
Now what we should say is, no more hearty, fruagy.
Unless it's his lurchy.
Now Kobe knows he's got a good lawyer to beat the cheerleader on his crew.
His wife won't say a thing when the fiddle won't get ready for his crew.
Suffering from constipation, Meta Muscle can help.
Meta Muscle.
For those times when you want to push, push it real good.
Meta Muscle.
It's always the same old story.
You and your pals can't agree on what to watch.
I want to watch stock car racing.
I want to watch stock.
Well now you can both be happy with a NASCAR PGA channel.
It's two great sports on one channel.
Watch Jeff Gordon with his number 24 Chevrolet wide open.
Whoa, past Jim Purek on the 18th hole of the Bielec open.
The NASCAR PGA channel never before had two acronyms combined to unite such diametrically opposed spectator sports.
Here's Tiger Woods on the green at 8th.
And here's the junior in the bit number 8.
Look out to groups of athletes both shooting for the checkered flag stick.
The adrenaline.
The relaxation.
The NASCAR PGA channel.
The NASCAR PGA channel is a subsidiary of the fingerscage in the high channel.
Be there!
Well there is the price of gasoline.
I don't think enough to fill my tank.
If I want to drive up to the mountains first I have to stop being robbed of pain.
On the catch we had for our vacation.
We just fed it all at the location.
