Don't forget to go on to the website and do your nominations for the dick of the year and the all dick team
Just nominate anybody want even if it's me be Zach whoever you can nominate anybody you want
I wonder who Neil Rogers would nominate it is his dick of the year. Let's ask him a meal
Who do you think this is?
Who's the dick of the year?
What was this happening? Was that the I bet it was Robert Creeper don't know always me. It was George done it
I don't know who do you think's a dick?
You don't have time to hear all my suggestions. Okay. I got four hours. I listen every day
There's all kinds of dicks coming around you. I can especially in this building man. You don't have to leave the building
I'm telling you dick is our middle name a QA
I bet you're gonna be happy to fly the hell out of here on Sunday
Now let me ask you this question
Because we've laid on your shoulder and you know see you haven't been here long enough
You're catching on but you're just a little slow on this one. You said we told you I told you that you're a assignment
When I leave is getting clearance laid. Yeah, and you saw that's easy. That's easy
500 bucks. You'll owe me I'm telling a dinner and we're gonna go to the splendid blended in August when you come back
You owe me dinner and 500 bucks change in a subject. I'm telling you I fact I will pay 500 bucks to your charity
The charity of your choice if you get clearance laid between now when I come back I get listen to me
I will put money I can bet my op at a thousand oh I think for a thousand parents still couldn't get laid
Not only I would also throw the beast in here, but I wouldn't want to wish
I can't imagine the sight of that I can get the beast I can get the beast like pigs
Graveling around in slump. I just can't imagine the thought of that. I can get the beast laid tonight
Oh, I can get the clearance laid. I will pick the day. I can do it in a life
24 hours is all I need and I will get them both laid in fact
I may get them both laid and they may end up doing each other
No, see we already got that going on our website. That's that's nothing new your website
Maybe the greatest visual thing I've ever it's better looking at 10 house all this now
You didn't see the new picture we had the wedding picture. What's the date on it is July 11th?
We're gonna turn it on right now. Let me look at it. No, it's not on the you gotta come in here. I know I really
Yeah, I'm sure you gotta come in here. It's not on there yet
Why isn't it on there because we just got a phone of our cyclist so I didn't know that your staff all had their cars
Detailed downstairs by the drug dealers. Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey man out do they supply you anything? No
Girls should he drugs in car wash? No the gypsy ill pharmacy. I'll never forget that day
I saw the kid from Miami wearing the gypsy
So anyway, hey Neil have a great weekend and that it was it was really a pleasure meeting you this weekend
Glad I got a chance to have you man. I'll tell you that well think welcoming with open arms and legs if I sent you
200 bucks a week would you send me some Toronto?
Weather in the mail down here. Okay. Thanks. Yeah
It's Friday you
I'm gonna give you an update of what took place just now off the air because I think it's important you hear this
Howard just called the radio station Howard David who I get along with great. I thought
He called me an asshole
Saying I was trying to stir it up. My point back to Howard is don't listen listen to 101.5. Let me see what age group 101.5 for Howard
Maybe 102.7
Some easily listening love music so you could focus on your wife and your family and the grandkids
Instead of listening and always calling the radio station. He's becoming Howard the caller like Howard from Boca Howard from Boca
It's like you know it's okay
So anyway, he's he's listening so this one to get the message out and don't call my show too
Just for a record don't call off the air because I don't want to talk to you
And I don't want to hear you on the private line congratulations. You know the private line number
That's great, but don't call because you're not coming on this show
You've got you've got your three hours five to eight
Monday through Friday you can talk all you want but you're not coming on this show
And we'll leave it at that
All right, I got nothing against you you seem like a decent person
And I know you've been getting it taken a big hit on the radio station from everybody else
But it's over me and you done
Okay, where does for all have this thing going on our website does he have his own website
die
Well shouldn't we fight out
From hey clearance all clear. It's a busy. I'm sure he's on qs getting busy the information in there. Okay. He's getting it all down
I'm serious that I'd like to vote for dick of the year on magas. I can do that anywhere I am
Venerable go out there and fight out by the way look what I held on to here
He doesn't nobody is well. I will
We'll tell you when he comes back in anyway George Oson apology a major apology before we start to show today
A big fat major apology to my good personal friends at city-length magazines
Can't believe what you said about that me. They
shameful
Yeah, you want to start apologizing now or until he comes back
I
Didn't say anything about them except that I didn't read that had you didn't you said that they should only rot and hell and that they're a bunch of assholes
I said they're promoting
Uh pirate radio and as much as stuff like that. I thought you said that I said that
Anyway, so come to fight and see that it's not really anybody's fault except of course from inside this building. I mean it's so lame
So freaking lame if we had anybody paying attention to business and what's going on now?
They're all whipped up and excited about wow for us got that big piece next week, which is great. I love that
Get some good publicity for him and for the station in city-length although nobody reads it
But the issue last week and it's also the audience the negative audience
I'm always the one our nails so negative. I'm not negative you people are negative
Usually before the issue even comes out people are calling us up with what's in it and whatnot
So the only thing that I got was that page with the best a the best radio personality and that's the schfarzer from the
Pirate radio station whatever that was whoever was the Michael Michael motorcycle
And in the meantime here's a whole section hall of fame and I've asked for days now ever since I've been back
I've been asking every day would somebody please fax this thing from the city link and see what that's really all about because they said they did something very nice for you in there
And then you'd have to apologize for George Riff and the man
I'm so sorry come to fight out that I went because nobody faxed it nobody mailed it to me no nothing
So muff had a good suggestion this morning and it's about time you know what I mean absolutely
And he said how about going on their website
Citylink magazine.com and sure enough I typed it in there and there was
And here's last week's issue hall of fame. Oh three is the section you'll find it in and it's and let me just read the thing up front
Because I want to like try to get back in there go graces even though I think you probably spoil it
It says when it became apparent a couple of years back that certain categories always produced the same winners in the annual this annual issue
We created the city link hall of fame to an eight to ennobal them on a more elite best of best of plane and open up the categories to new talents
You following that?
He distracts the hell out of me. I'll tell you. He's just a mean. And by the way Carlos got laid last night. Beena boy got laid
How many times?
Get out of here. Yeah four times
Four times
Who was he?
Anyway, we created the city link hall of fame to ennobal them on a more elite best of plane and open up the categories to new talents the
Criterion was simple if unscientific be it a person placed within cocktail if it was a candidate
We couldn't imagine publishing the issue without
Here then are the inductees from two thousand more than two thousand and two you'll find this year's inductees at the fund of each section got it
Got it the hall of fame for example waitress Rosemary O'Neill at Creoleenas in four lotter day. I love Rosemary, don't you?
Oh, yeah, he'd be the best
bakery grand four no
Fort Lauderdale and then a.m. Radio personality Neil Rogers a.m. 560 WQM. It says not not a whole lot about all of them are short
Commercial radio doesn't completely suck in South Florida as long as Uncle Neil is on the earth said
That's sweet. That's a really nice thing. I want to thank my friends at city link profusely even though nobody reads it
Thank them a lot because they didn't shine me. They didn't ignore me like you were trying to say
They must stick it right in me and twist it huh?
I apologize in addition to which what they're basically saying is that you know
If they were going to do it honestly that there's certain categories here that would be number one every single year forever
That's not fair. They're pushing us out which means we're getting old is what it really means
Which is true, but that's a nice touch. Thank you city link and don't forget this coming next week's issue would have a big piece on for real
Now speaking of a big piece
Beener boy he's real excited because he got laid four times last night
But wait doesn't understand is he's not getting paid this week again
What do you look at me like that for?
What do you say why is that?
Because parents doesn't like you
Ha ha ha no special reason just parents don't like you. I can't do it to him. No, no, no, he give didn't he give you this stuff?
Oh, he didn't get
I could have played that for the whole four hours
You are so pathetic man. We're ecstatic that you got laid 40 times last night
But you're just you're tragic. You're tragic. You need to be led by the hand. You need to be
Beener boy on a leash. You need to seriously on a leash
In fact, the freaky carless will take you around on a spike leash. Oh, it'd be a beautiful thing
Now seriously you need to be taken around leash. I got your stub right here and the paycheck stub two
And I'm looking in here. I'm thinking of myself here for all the belly aching
Dozens squeezing money out of you and me he's a duck doing that bad for a punk
You making a few bucks here
I heard that
Well, that comes out about 60 cents an hour and a bad
No, seriously you're not doing that bad. I'm talking about for this place. Okay for this place
Which usually whoever sits in that chair
You know, they what they get is like everybody's good wishes. That's what they get. I'm paying you
wishes
We get those they get everybody's dirty looks is what they get
So just to count your blessings. Okay, plus you got laid four times last night. So here's your
I'm gonna hold out of it for a while because otherwise you'll lose it
Not necessarily don't give him anything that he'll lose a goddamn thing
Let me do oh this is great. This is fantastic. This is gonna be such a good day
This is probably the only call we'll get today because there's nobody here wqa.m
Neil yes, sir
All right, there. I know it. I knew I was gonna be the person to punch Neil please retire
No, that is still barking at the moon and it's still there
Thank you very much for being so loyal by the way and listening every single minute of every day to the world flaming the eruditor
My
But she's not
oh
It's very challenging.
I will choose to continue.
I didn't use the crime so I don't use the time
You put me in a cell then you can go to hell
I'll make the best of my time and my jumpsuit
And see if the other girls had to make wax fruit
Miss, who's gonna cry?
Just say goodbye
Cause you will try
Let's look it down
They look like a thug
And put some pictures of her busy mug
Marthot's 10th house
For lying like a rug
Stop it gonna push her like a mug
Marthot's 10th house
And she can go to hell
Unless the victim lawyer's getting prevailed
Why does the theft go?
And she can go to hell
How about going out of business, hell?
What is it?
1215 already
God damn I totally this 10 to 2 thing goes fast
Here could be the silliest facts I've ever gotten in my life
And that covers a lot of territory
From Craig and downtown Miami
You got quite a sense of humor Craig
Hey Neil, please don't go back to Toronto
When you're down here in Miami
You're funnier than when you are in Toronto
When you're in Toronto you're all happy and shmit
And it's not the same
Here in Miami you're pissed off and you rip into people's asses
And you can see what Georgian Carlos are doing and stuff
So please stay here in Miami
Please with a bunch of exclamation parts
Hey Marks Craig
No no no no chance
Please stay here and be as miserable as the rest
We need it
Well just like that first call right out of the box
You know this is this like I said yesterday is a new one
Please retire Neil retire
You know this is the new guy
Just one after another the passing parade of misfits
Of miscreants of assholes
Who do and believe me the day when I will retire
And I wish it were like tomorrow
They want to know what to do with themselves
Oh no
And speaking of I can't see I can't I'm I'm down here
And I can't see what they're doing anyway
Because being a boy got only knows what he's doing now
Off playing a grab ass with Zach in the hallway
There's another one couldn't get laid
And he's married
Didn't he married?
I have no idea
Zach I don't know
I think he is
Does he have a wife?
I don't know
I really don't
I mean you can't picture it though can you
I know
I don't want to
But anyways so they're running around playing grab ass in the hall
This kid is out here if you keep forgetting the leash
You keep forgetting the goddamn leash
It's a shame
So Craig have a great life I'm glad that you enjoy my misery
But the answer is absolutely
No
It's hot it's humid it's boring it's suffocating
It's the swamp land
It's the end of the world
Kurt Norlando says
Neil Redd Netator yesterday on the year
The only one for the day have you been able to post it on the website
Please try to get on it was excellent as always great show
Well thank you Kurt Norlando
But it wasn't an editorial number one
Number two it's not on the website because being a boy is like
Seriously you're gonna have to bitch him out which I'm sure you'd enjoy doing
I have
No I need you
He's gotta get his ass on that chair
He will not listen to me
And sit the hell down
Listen he will not listen to me he will not listen to anyone
Really?
Listen to reason
Well you know what?
Here's this paste tub
It's a stub it's already in this
I should have just not told him about it
I should have just not told him about it
Where did it come from?
The stub?
Yeah, Clarence
So Clarence just laid it down?
Yeah
And in other words were a beaner boy couldn't find it
Yeah blew it we've had a really good thing going there
Then I guarantee him that his ass would be in that chair
But anyway didn't I say we were gonna put that on there
And I kind of put it over here where the stuff is that I you know
And he's oblivious he's too busy getting laid in crap
He's got his own agenda
He is exactly your right
He's got his own agenda like trying to hit the muff in the face with that yo-yo
Or whatever that was he was sticking in muff's face
It muffs puss
Yeah it was disgusting
So anyway we will put that on the website
It was the declaration for the future of America Challenge for George W. Bush
And it's sponsored by ARM in New York
Whatever the hell that means
What does that mean?
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna like I'm gonna staple it
No no seriously I'm gonna staple it to his paste tub
Yeah and then to his head and then to his ass
And then maybe do his privates
And then maybe in the midst of all his exciting exploits
Maybe he'll find it but I doubt it
Where did he go?
Do you want my theory?
Yeah what's the theory? That came in here
Where the hell were you? What was that all about?
I gave him the rope
I gave these people the Valet key
Which is supposed to only open like
It can turn on the car and it goes
Oh Jesus Christ you know
This guy in downtown Miami I'm gonna we're gonna seek him out
There's a guy under the overpass named Craig in downtown Miami
One of your friends no doubt
Who faxes me and says please don't leave here
Please stand Miami you're so much more pissed off and exciting when you're down here
I don't want to be here I can't handle your exploits okay
Now I don't want to hear about it
We don't want to know
Sit your ass down in a chair
Take the microwave from a sit down in the chair and shut up
You're making me psychotic
You're making me crazy
So I stapled to your paste tub envelope
Here I stapled the thing that I gave you yesterday
Which is what some other facts are wanting to know
That declaration for George W. Bush that we were gonna put on our website
But of course you're too busy getting laid so I stapled it right there
There it is okay right on top of the monitor there
Keep that in mind I think you're gonna ever get it but it's just it's there
Oh my god
How do you how do you how do you say it's your like I said Dr. Frankenstein
It's your creation you invented it
Well it's out of my control
Where the hell did you find it?
Here's yesterday's poor result
And believe you me I know what's going on this today
Every single day you can see the law of diminishing return in this town
All you people in retail by the way good luck to you
So I can say how do they do it you know I don't know
How do they do it because they always say in this town if you're in business
If you don't do the business in most businesses
January through like April
Right if you don't like really do heavy busy gigantic business during those months
You're screwed
So if you don't and then comes like May and June and like right now coming up into July
You have to go through that entire period praying and waiting somehow you can survive until the so-called season starts again
In this seasonal horse and buggy town because there's nobody here now
I could have gone bowling on a highway coming to work this morning
And then I get to like Ivesdury Road
I get to the Estadium thing there on the corner
I get to Ivesdury Road and generally usually it's kind of that tough left turn
Where they try to give as many people killed as possible
Right and you know usually have to kind of look around and wait a little bit
And all week long it's been better than usual because it is you know holidays now and kids are out of school
Everybody's gone but today it was like the defining moment
There was nobody there was nobody to my left there was nobody to my right there was nobody to my behind
There was nobody in front of me on the other side of the dead end there there was nobody anywhere
Not even a pork or on his motorcycle
There was nobody
But even a mooney selling flowers
Not even that
I had to get all the way up here to the corner by the zuri in 441 till I got to my first homeless voice box
Not even a black Muslim with flowers at a motel
That's their corner although I guess they've leased it out alternate Fridays to the homeless voice people
They've come to an arrangement they have a lend lease deal
Yesterday's pool and wait a minute let's take another one on six maybe it's the same guy WQAM
Jamba!
Okay see what I'm saying?
That's what we're gonna get today that's all we're gonna get
So that's two for two WQAM on line nine which is never real call hello
Yes it is real call
Is it a real call?
Yes it is I can't believe you
This is not my favorite thing about me but this is cracking down to our family
I'm not a stick like Carlos I mean they grew up but listen
You ever used to watch the very standard show?
I hated that show was ridiculous I can't stand him
Because the reason why I said it because because pain equals funny
And I'm pretty sure George used to watching with his George like it
George hated it
What was wrong with it?
I just I got I saw it over a weekend on Memorial Day
That was all
I saw it over a Memorial Day one on Memorial Day and I thought it was great I got hooked on it right away
Well see there goes to show you that's another reason I'm not staying here is because of people with tastes like yours great
I can't handle it it's an awful show
Okay well you know I mean when you're down here like I'm saying about the facts when you're down here it's great
I mean if you know
No no it's not great it's great for you because you have the feeling that I'm suffering
And I don't want to suffer just to make you happy
Okay great I'll see you at 10 number three
Okay okay I think I made him feel bad good good
No see I don't take instructions from the audience like retired no stay here no
It's a radio show it's free
Obviously you're loving it every one of you on there you wouldn't be listening right now even more
He's listening you think a guy like him with all the money he's making which is like a gift at this point at this stage of his life
You think he'd be like you know out there on the course right now getting ready for a big weekend
I heard him say this morning he's going to be like playing golf tomorrow on golf on Sunday and maybe he'll think about coming in on Monday
You know don't don't bother me
I think somebody had a who was that suggested that about the car pulling because for all we're seeing he wants to get a limo to bring him from
Boka back and forth every day and somebody said hey just how about car pulling with mole right and boy you should have seen a look on his
Poison
He was just going nuts
Somehow he can't envision himself in that explorer
Shloping down from Boka that long our ride with mole
And then of course mole would have to record our way to rondel 10 every day they wouldn't have to drive the explorer
No, they could drive the Jaguar they could get a Hummer limo is a matter of fact for all could sit in the back seat and pretend that mole was his limo driver
Huh and get him a driver on a way out that would be good anyway
Here's the poll from yesterday. I know I get around with sooner later
Which of these statements is the most ridiculous
1637 votes pretty heavy duty for nobody being here George W. Bush is a great leader
787 found that most amusing the most ridiculous statement of them all pieces coming in the Middle East 276 of you said that's ridiculous
George is a great fill in for Neil 208
Moe Howard David it does a great show 185 think his show is just absolutely pathetic
The marlins will be 91 games 85 clearance our program director will get laid this year 53 confidence is booming now for clearance
He's starting to move up a little bit and or is that no see that's not good is it he'd be better off if he were in last place
And the forals got a pleasant voice 43 so for all once again it comes out smelling like a rose
Sounding like a razor blade but small and like a rose
Not a rose is lovely as boner boy in here who's like covered from head to toe with cashmere bouquet
And what's that baby baby baby kilo
Baby kilo see I'm going to cologne this summer probably he's going to baby cologne
It's right next door so for us got a pleasant voice in last place which is a positive for for all
They just love him they're obsessed with it and I think that's great it's about time
We're having a great time here Craig under the overpass chronic Craig so leave me alone
We got two polls today one early and then the other one for later in the show and through the weekend
And then we got to talk about the hot couples contest we got 50 billion votes on air
Inter like a 20 million votes absolutely last time I checked it say humongous response
Too bad it's not a close race although it's a very close it's tight for second
Right I mean it is nip and tuck you couldn't put a curly here in between those two couples
But anyway speaking of couples this is general in response to anything that we've had on there
And I probably forgot some which picture on our website you like best
Moe's grew his neal swinging Moe is what we call that okay
Moe's of the clown squirrely moe
Hairless toothless moe which was the preceded moe's of the clown
Muscle bound meal God that's the brand new one it's on there now
Clarence and the beast although we have a new clearance in the beast
But that won't be up there in time for this poll but when you see that
Oh with the wedding date and the whole deal love it I think for all should have that wedding on the air on his show
Right that would be big forget about that Marlon game the other night
Clarence and the beast Moe and Geldie doing the tango that's a lovely thing very very tight
The titty picks on the hot couple contest and I hate them all
Because we always have to put some really on there just to keep a lot of you at Bastard's hand

As an adverb enhancing an adjective surely is
as a noun I don't give a f*** as part of a word
abso f*** un-lutely or in f*** incredible
and as almost every word in a sentence
f*** the f***ing f***ers
As you must realize there aren't too many words
with a versatility of f*** as in these examples
describing situations such as fraud
I got f*** that they use carolot
dismay or f*** it
trouble I guess I'm really f***ed now
aggression don't f*** with me buddy
dismissal why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself
I'm sure you can think of many more examples
sing it loudly and proudly
f*** you
absolutely
14 to 11 at 564
four beenervoy more problems
somebody in the building I don't want to mention Timmy by name
but somebody gave him something to put in his computer
and it you know
scud you scud your computer all up
so we're going to have a wait for the bedtime stories now
and that damn beautiful declaration thing that I mentioned before
have to wait till he's good and ready
till he can sort out his life
why do you let these people do these things
don't you understand the sanctity of this whole operation here
and you're letting people from the outside pollute our website
dittle with our middle
it's wrong with him
you haven't done a very good job explaining to him how important these things are to me
and how aggravated I get especially like when I f*** him a whole bunch of stories
at 11 o'clock on Saturday morning
and about two o'clock the next morning they wind up on our website
I won't do it again
here's we already got a lot of votes on this pool
which is amazing to me
113 votes which picture on our website do you like best
squirley mo 21
muscle bound Neil God
20
titty picks on a couple of contest
19
Moe screws Neil old swing in him
18 it's a good battle here
I hate all of them 15
haha
I hate all of them 15
Moe and Geldie 12
Moe's other clown four
I thought what the thought Moe's other than that
I thought morphing Moe's other than Moe's other than that
morphing Moe's other than Moe's other than that
and hereless toothless Moe only one
I thought that was a work of art
the one that preceded the mozo
with the missing here
and the missing t
sure but that was that was that's the only got one vote
well that's the first 113
okay that's we're off to the races till noon with that pool
and then we'll get to this other one
I think there's going to be a lot of people take issue with you on that
Harry Potter thing
I could be wrong
I think they're getting really pissed off and fired up about those comments you made
okay let me take a peek
and we don't have to dwell on this because you got until Monday morning at 10 o'clock
the hot couple's contest
Frank and Liz have varied the competition
they've got a shovel out
and they just dug a big hole
and they're in there with Sheridan and the rats and those bananas
Frank and Liz have got 858 votes
Greg and Stephanie have moved into second
it's very very tight for second place
which of course is important because the really two good prizes are one and two
am I right?
right right
Greg and Stephanie 392
and right on their ass
Brian and Natasha 388
so it's only a four vote spread
speaking of spread Mary and Shane 274
it's a long ways
to them
Holly and Darin 271
Mike and Kristen 250
Ian and Jen 223
Danny and Michelle 175
Captain Singham is wife 131
Vicki and Mick 124
Dan and Sherry 65
Rich and Cheryl 55
and Jody and Kevin
with that sepia tone
have only 27 bad photography
right right
or maybe they just don't like them
I don't know
but anyway they only got 27
out of 3233 votes
pretty damn impressive since we were delayed a whole day
and as they get started to Tuesday morning
right right
3233 so we've already surpassed last contest total
and in that contest we had Amy and Erin
I just mentioned in passing
which was no small potatoes
and I'll say it again
I saw your lady on channel 7 again this morning
she still looks like a monkey
she did not look good
she still got a monkey push
Jackie what's your name?
Johnson
Jackie's Johnson?
I don't know if she had one
I mean she's okay
I'm not saying she's the ugliest bitch ever seen in my life
but she is not
you people out there
you guys are really desperate
aha, aha, I'm Tonya
like George
and that's the reason that you're so forming
at the mouth about Jackie Johnson
you can go to the guy named Songgrass Mall right now
the Broward Mall, Dayland
oh yeah
and within two minutes you'll see
15 beautiful luscious babes
who make Jackie Johnson look like the bottom of Clarence's ass
I'm Tonya
she's just about that great
I'm not saying she might be a very very nice person
huh?
I don't know
or not she may be a bitch
I don't know
and I'm not saying she's grotesque
but when you look
when you're gonna make a fuss about somebody like
I did to you about Brittany
when she was on a cover bowling stone like two years ago
and you didn't know her
from God named broccoli spirit
and you're like
and you're like
holy crap, you old man's right
look, take a look at that
take a look at those
yeah
that's right
fuss worthy
you've heard of Jeff Foxworthy
how about finding somebody who's fuss worthy
when I can make a fuss about Tom Brady for crying out loud
that's because he's worth fussing over and with
I'd like to fuss with it
but uh...
huh?
don't think you need to make a fuss
no
and what about that
in Foke guy
or is that in Rike
now listen
here's an article
and I don't want to dwell on it because I don't know nobody cares
but it's just
and the mad dog today is doing a show out at the Hooters in Pepper Pines
two to four
Hank Ford is seven in the studio
in the Marlins of the Tampa Day
they've been deviled
oh my god
pretty inversing
two teams that have no business being in business
but the mad dog is got on his show
his guest
and he doesn't do guests
right?
he hates guests
but
Dom Twel Willis
and I apologize
I had no idea who that was
because I don't follow the Marlins
so the other day I said
who the hell is that?
a basketball guy
it sounds like a basketball name doesn't it?
Dom Twel
you don't have no baseball guys named Dom Twel
but you do now
he's the 21-year-old black kid
it's the great Marlins picture
the pizza one hit her Monday night against the mess
okay
so here's the deal
mad dog is going to be talking with him I guess
but he won't be a guest
he'll just be schmoozen
I don't make it okay
okay
right
but there's an article in the
here old this morning in the sports section
it says
and I heard the mad dog saying yesterday
this is what inspired me to mention this
that now people have a reason to go out to the ballpark
in other words
and the suggesting once again
we've been down this road a million times you know
over and over and over
maybe not a million but
but third man
yeah
at times
first it was going to be Alex Fernandez
because of his Hispanic roots
and then it was going to be this one
and then it was going to be that one
and it was going
and never happened
never paying off
there were three extra people in there
so maybe Ferell was in there with a bunch of skeins that night
but it says
TV ratings are way up every time
Willis pitches
but
he hasn't had any impact on attendance
Monday when he pitched that one hit him against the met
Steve as you know
the attendance was 10,624
and again keep in mind
these numbers are bogus
they're over
they're inflated
in his previous started pro player stadium
a two-nothing shutout of the Oakland A's he knew the smallest crowd in a six-game
stretch
10,014
95-year-old manager Jack McKeehan says
he's getting some national attention
the TV ratings are starting to go up
but he hasn't had a big crowd here
Saturday night by the way
he'll be pitching here against the devil raise
there's one good reason to go out there and see it
but they won't
I don't think
will they?
no
and he insures
that he would know what I'm talking about
but he knows the answer
see
you don't have to know the question
but if you know the right answer that's what counts
like on a quiz show
and the answer is
no
right that's the correct answer
so you know
all you people want to keep trying
oh that's going to be great
they're going to be coming out there
they're going to be standing online
it's going to be like the line
that Ferrell had here yesterday
or two days ago
five
that McGillboy
talk about an emotional
spickman
comes rush
rushing into
well they're lining up
there's a line out here
and I envision I don't know about you
but I envision there's like a whole
you know
how many times have I been involved in these radio things
where they invite people to come down
like it
like it's Zeta
you know actually it was before it was Zeta
it was I-95
and they got into a whole big scene
with that for help
I would love that
because they invited kids to come down
in their underwear
and they were giving away tickets for concert
you know it was like
right
kids night time show
yeah teenagers
you know
no not little kids
not little kids
punks
punks
teenage kids
you know come down in your underwear
we got tickets for some
always concert
and they did
they showed up
and they were under
and then of course somebody called the cops
and the cops came into the building
and it was like a whole big scene
in the song of the day
and it was great
and they got about $50 million
with the publicity from it
but there were
a number of people in the building
and it was unbelievable
because I was already
out of the building on I-n-Z
at that time doing nights
now did I go and take a peek?
not not me
well of course not
periscope
yes it is
well I mean there were like a
zillion kids in there
okay there were a lot of people
but here there was like five people lined up
and Miguel act
they were like oh my god
you wouldn't believe it
oh we had to magnify
yeah
all the results like the polls
kind of like most ratings
we have to multiply times three
and add a couple extra points
and then goose it up a little bit
and then
check the hair piece
oh it's big enough hair piece
if you...
you should have taped when
he wasn't looking you should
taped the beast this morning
talking about that bogus dream
he claimed
claiming he had a dream
he ran into Mo
out in the parking lot
had a big
verbal brawl with him
yanked the wig off his head
ran over to Kentucky
fried
and Mo chased him over to Kentucky
fried
I mean what kind of crap
was he sucking on at the ball
game the other night to beast?
huh?
he must have been sucking on some
illegal jungle juice
or something
because he was just crazy
he's a bed bug
more so than usual
because I walked in the middle
of it and I thought what
what happened that I missed?
a dream
he had a dream
I think what got him emotional
is when we started
showing those pictures
aiming clearance in that
love in that lip lock
oh my god
and wait till you people see
that new one
now if you got this thing
go on or not
no
what is he saying?
half and half
that means no
see this is not a good
reason for me not to be here
I mean the fact that I have to
watch this
I have to be expected
to this
grotesque episode again
day after day after day
I lost my keys
my valley
he doesn't work
timmie
a stuck something in my
slot
and now it's all screwed up
well just on
and on
and the best part
but he doesn't care
because he got laid
last night
and paid today
paid today
laid last night
a man who's got his priorities
in order
see you in my head
look
this is
20 or 26
you way
I just got
oh
you're never gonna pay
well we've searched so long with disease
if he's alive where is he?
it's driving us insane
where in Kema
Flush and Kaki
that's one
Honda Ketchai Raki
where the hell's the domino's sane?
is he on a major pendant?
or did he change his jambi?
and a hospital's sane?
or maybe he didn't try to swamp his holes
for a vagina
where the hell's the domino's sane?
where in Kema
I make my ship
and living right next door
what in that thought really
kind of make you sick?
sniffed off my wake
I'm kind of sore
he's a loose assign
the dictator keeps running
without his candy cane
he still looks hairy and burly
but his voice is kind of girly
where the hell's the domino's sane?
well I like the ending on that
that's a beautiful thing
this is disgusting
what would Ken think?
it says the mother of a 18
from Queens is suing the city
saying the girl was humiliated
and harassed after wearing a
Barbie is a lesbian
t-shirt to school
in the suit filed yesterday
in Manhattan federal court
Kathleen Hodges accused the city
of officials at middle school
210 in ozone park
of failing to protect her daughter
Natalie Young now 14
the lawsuit would cease
unspecified damages
says that Natalie's right
to freeze speech was violated
when she was sent home last year
and warned she'd be suspended
if she wore the t-shirt to school again
I was trying to be funny
she told the Daily News
I wore the shirt to many other places
and people always saw humor in it
but it was no joke to teach your
John Mason
who called the shirt
inappropriate ridicule
Natalie in front of her classmates
April 10th of last year
the lawsuit
Natalie was then escorted
out of class
brought to acting principal
John Calories office
where she was held for three hours
before being sent home
for the rest of the day
she was removed and detained
solely on the basis of an arbitrary
and bigoted view of a team of school administrators
said attorney Raul Kubey
who's representing Natalie
the lawsuit also charges
that Natalie was once ordered
to remove rainbow colored beads
from her hair
and was told by a school counselor
it was not normal for her to ask girls out
like on dates
okay
but why not
if she's a guy
who she's supposed to ask out
like a monkey
the P teacher
oh
probably
if we think so
if I probably just about any teacher
of the female persuasion
okay we got a couple of problems
Miguel is crawling around on the floor
and they're which I don't want to tell you the details
but there's some
I mean
a beanabor
it's in different
different body
same mentality
different body
oh by the way Miguel I always liked him
guess what he told me
Jackie Johnson
he was recently
very very overrated
and here's another fact
see you you thought
and I thought
I thought I'd definitely even say that on the year
because I thought I was going to say
there's that old bag again
he don't know
here's another fact
it says you are absolutely correct
about Jackie Johnson
she is out of proportion
average face
and she though
she likes
joe rose has the scoop on her ass Kim
I can't say dark meat on here
no I'll ask him
no
ask joe rose
sure
he'll tell you
absolutely
so there you go with all your Jackie Johnson fantasies
like I said
if you're going to get emotional about somebody
if somebody is fussable
then they better look pretty damn good
if you're going to make a fuss
I'm going to them all
you know what I'm saying is true
no absolutely
but nobody else
nobody at the mall is doing the winters
in addition to which there's a
she blind
because I don't watch the local lose that much
it's depressing
oh and then that Jackie Ness brawl
and like I said
lose some way Jackie
okay you're starting to really put some moves on her
some heavy duty moves
as in big fat ones
she's grotesque
Jackie Ness brawl
and she's one of your people
but there's a blind
the news anchor lady on one local channels
I can't think of what her name is
she looks like
Marilyn Monroe compared to Jackie Johnson
you know what I'm talking about?
what is her name?
is she on 6?
4 or 6
who's the half blinded
so does the news Miguel on Channel 4 or 6?
see he don't know
he don't watch that
he's watching Channel 53
51
69
he's watching 69
oh he's watching Channel 7
yeah that figures
don't you know what I'm talking about?
I mean really a knockout
she's beautiful and everybody
oh Jackie Johnson
it's like just like the Rascal House
okay
I'm embarrassed for you
by the way did the
the girl to give the guy the 10 bucks back
at the mobile place
anybody know?
I would have never heard anything
I never heard anything
I never heard anything
how about she didn't do it?
you didn't do it
you cheap little Jew bastard
you I can't believe that this guy
kinda some Porsche
some illegal alien up the street
they're out of 10 bucks at mobile
and he knew he would give him too much change
he probably just kind of let it ride
and they'll forget about it
although maybe he did do it early in the show
you think?
no
no
join Mark of the
Joanne Marks Show tonight
from oh he's going to be there
all by himself Mark Eisenberg
who wants to see him?

genitalia
genitalia their friends fragrance for men and women that will leave you saying
I think I've smelled this before it's 1116 don't we always say that when screw in comes in
here we've smelled that before and hoping that we never smelled it again here's another fact
that says hold on to your seat Jackie Johnson is extremely overrated underlined several times
two TV hotties are Lisa Petrilo and Glenn and Milberg is one of those the a blind I'm thinking
about no idea see I don't know the names because the news here on TV is so bad I enjoy a CFT O
and Toronto so much I'm a cruiser to much bigger market but I mean like professional news people
you know like a real newscast as opposed to down here what's like you know grandmas I mean I'll
tell you I tried watching six because we do like to arose especially after last Saturday's
performance when he bitched out Moe you know what I mean absolutely but what's her name uh
Jennifer Sloppy Vellope yeah I can't deal with her I can't stand her she's got an ego bigger than
the whole town I did one time say something nice about that travel series she did on travel channel
when they were slapping her all through Italy that was a good series and then she sent me kind of
like a very formal stiff you know thank you for the nice comments and stick it up your ass you
remember that she thinks her stuff don't think her end at Tony Cigaretto and of course could you
take him seriously it's like when they made Camberall remember our channel four which used to be six
they made Camberall Martian a news guy I mean is there anybody anybody would take him seriously
and much less I'm just talking to see human being much less than news Camberall am I a nice guy but
give me a break and that's the big thing in his town first you're a sports dude then you're a
news guy yeah Tony Cigaretto silly Tony and the problem is because these people shmuz with
everybody in the business and they have all of these you know like Hank and Mad Dog and Jimmy
Cifalist and all these guys in Cigaretto they're all of these football shows you know on four and
six and ten and they're like it's like a little fraternity so they doesn't say nothing negative about
each other follow them saying but I have no ask the grandma where the other so I will just tell
you right now I can't stand channel six news I think it blows it blows channel seven news we know
blows big time channel four isn't even I wouldn't even dignified by calling it a newscast now that
tackling Angela Ray back from New York I don't plan that please I'm done it makes me nauseous absolutely
so what does that leave you it leaves you channel ten I don't want to see if that I know is eating
a ass you know I don't want to see that it's bad enough I have to see Georgian here all the time
because we know he's eating ass but at least I'm not here most of the time but I'm sure I can watch
right in Lauderdale since he shaved the mustache shop he looks about 20 years older and he looks like
he looks like like uh step in fetch it he's ridiculous you don't think he's ridiculous
I've seen it in such a long time and and don't give me a song that's about me talking about how
other people look that crap again because I'm not on television I have a face at a face at a body
for radio I know my place yeah I belong on radio not on television who that would want to look at my
push grab what I thought so I just put it up on the bulletin board then what's that your push
it because a lot of people are interested especially now that that for else that I had the
most beautiful one in history it's red oh and guess who we got a fax from who's having lunch with
fat boy I don't want to see from here okay I don't want to mention who it is um five
see it wasn't just kind of Lisa we're gonna do like that we're just gonna do a lot of stuff
like mmm pretty soon like you know that Jackie Johnson she likes mmm according to Joe Rose mmm
really yeah that's what Joe said right absolutely five six seven oh five sixty so we've got
Jackie Johnson going here today and we also got um Perry's Potter where's that damn thing I got all
my bedtime stories screwed up here oh you know I do want to do this please this gives us a little
bit of hope send it panel and this will be on our website if Fabina is we got that straight out
as it going like full force now where I know menza menza it's going slowly slowly but surely we'll
get a monitor when he's good and ready unless he gets a chance to get laid again before noon like
maybe if clearance comes in here and drops him Senate panel passes build a overall FCC media
ownership rules a Senate panel voted yesterday to overturned decision by FCC that would loosen
restrictions on US media ownership to Senate Commerce Committee decision now goes before the full
Senate but it is not clear if there are enough votes to pass the bill in either the Senate or the
House however several Republicans have joined with Democrats and opposing the FCC rules which do not
need congressional approval can be effectively vetoed by Congress that's the good news we got
our fingers and legs crossed and they know the details it's on our website the whole story I just
thought I would mention that a little bit of good news a little bit of hope a little bit of hope maybe
that goddamn colon paul junior they're Michael paul the chairman of the FCC and all these other
two Republican Nazis aren't going to just hand a key to the kingdom over to Laura Mason and a
clear channel Greg Reed was just in here by the way first time I seen Greg in a long time and he
said yeah yeah mention something about you again now actually he seemed to be in a pretty good
mood he's real happy he loves for real man he's got blow up dollars got the whole deal he loves
for and rightfully so I mean you know you watch Greg stumble and fumble and bumble along and screw
up all sorts of things and then finally it's like my old axiom there if you throw enough crap up
any or so it'll come back and hit the ground it'll stick and I think this stuck so far and of course
it's sticky it is very sticky enough for us you know that's what they said of the ballpark too a lot
of uh rumors about that oh I should have mentioned that earlier all that hysteria that was going on
in here yesterday and beater boys starting all these rumors oh this better knock it on the air
there was there was no big deal there for all us throw on the first pitch out of the game on
Sunday the devil rig game they're not pissed off at him there were a couple of bimbos in there a
couple of those skanky broads which I better not say that because that's his sponsor but yeah a
couple of them well he talked about it with the uh you know the banana of our bruise on her ass
but uh and I guess they were doing a few things a little bit over the line if you catch my grip
a little over the edge the baseline yeah over the baseline in fact that picture we're talking about
before I think maybe they were like kind of flashing that to the crowd and they say well there's a
whole bunch of kids in here and we don't want them to get the wrong impression of what that
thing's really like so we better not let them take a look at that no mole and they dragged their ass
out of there but other than that a great time was had by all of them even tough was in you know how
panicky she uh he gets I mean he's a nervous nelly literally but he went in after the show yesterday
he said now the marlins were not happy everybody's uh it's great it was a major happening there at
the ballpark I mean when a guy can bring in an extra two three hundred people and there's only 10
thousand or eleven thousand ballpark keep in mind it was eleven thousand on wednesday but that's
inflated because it wasn't a tv game so there was bound to be extra people because it was not on tv
as opposed to if it's on tv you get it for free like no matter whose picture whether it's a don
trail or whoever the hell it is chantel so the we just took a survey and we decided Jackie Johnson's
like a shadow of what everybody claims on his station all the sports nerds see I guess they feel
compelled I'd like to find out off the air what they really think about Jackie's Johnson you know
okay I get no serious survey leave it to me because I have nothing losing that category I can go
on here and say hi I think she's marginal right and again I'm not talking personal sweetheart you
may be a very very nice lady you may be just a sweetheart I don't know and I really don't care
quite frankly but uh that's not what we're talking about the fact is she's been built up to be this
wow oh man really hot piece and I got news for you if I were in that persuasion I wouldn't be
all that excited about her okay there's there are bigger fish to uh oh there are
bigger and bigger and hotter fish in the better asses I still like her okay I'm not I'm not trying
to dissuade you okay because I know you're in I'm tough times wqa not nobody there wqa am hello
hello Neil Harry Potter Jackie Johnson line hello yes sir I listen I have no
house you know mo-mowered thing uh the he brought up the fact and I'm trying to think of her name
Alicia Lane who does the uh weekend anchoring for channel six yeah and she's very I think that's
her name and uh that he gets a lot of jocks coming in there and saying hey who the you know who
the hell is she and she and he thought that she was a lot hotter than Jackie Johnson's line all right
let's hear her for Joe I always like you know it's producer didn't even seem to know I think I
know he's starting about because right I watch channel six news but she's kind of new on the scene
and well let me ask you do you like Jennifer Veloppi um I'm not my under a little you don't
make a joke at it's a little stiff and you know I just I mean uh my girlfriend likes likes to
watch channel six news you and I'm not a big fan of Tony's but oh she likes Tony's
So Greta he's got a big heart on yeah okay well listen pal say how to Jackie's Johnson
here I okay so you see this is great I you could knock me off the chair with a feather
I just hey got one I cannot believe oh okay feather duster I could fall on the floor but
my luck I'd probably break my leg and I don't want to do that just before I'm getting out of here
there he goes there goes the old man but I'm so ecstatic the fact that I'm not the only one I'm maybe
you know you know how it is it's a sucker thought I say something the right away all the people
who agree with me you could say Jerry Greta was hot and they don't agree with you well she's
probably hanging out with sister Jean boy can you imagine where you imagine where they're sticking
that thermometer what you said she's hot I wonder maybe she's got a fever you know maybe she's
got fever in the morning is doing morning at night oh that's right over that guy said in the
anybody out there any you hot guys want to do Janet Reno come on be a good sports that's bad
I bet you she'd stay still long enough for you'd like to get a hold of something
huh oh god like I said I think Jackie Johnson's looking better by the minute this
why he's sick don't be puking in the way spas get Disney oh that's right it's the wrong

most sick and tired of hearing about how hot Jackie Johnson is huh okay how hot Jackie Johnson
and we'll put channels six and seven in parentheses channel seven how hot Jackie Johnson is
they'll get votes anyway here's a whole bunch of facts is you're not gonna like this one from
a rob Bob Rob whatever it means Neil and Bob says Rodriguez is a copycat can't come up with his
own material oh yeah in fact when he started ripping off my eating ass shows I really got upset yeah
it says no need to worry about George this summer he's become your complete understudy one there
will be a pool every day like here's yeah there'll be a pool every day because it's part of
our show asshole I'm not supposed to did I get ripped for not doing it once uh two he
hates his mother like you well guess what he hated her a lot before he even met me right three he's
perfected the silent response effect used between phrases so in other words even when you don't say
anything uh either not happy I say for right now he has a deep sigh exactly like yours make him stop
sighing stop sighing when he laughs here's a complete ripoff of your trading off moan by trading off
moan whoa oh that not that one oh tell us the truth really uh it's your son rest assured he copies
you to a tee I'll probably listen anyway since I have no life there you go what are your loyal listeners
right I'm sure they match that oh now this is a really good fact for me Vaughan this is something
constructive and useful although we all get to that here's one it says just like uh just like
on most topics with exception of being some of your musical taste you are absolutely correct about
Jackie's Johnson being mediocre at best absolutely correct big boobs alone don't make you hot if that
were true Ron Jeremy would be hot yeah he's got tutors like a cow George once again proves he's
a horny suit intellectual spick would not really hop on anything breathing but just has crappy taste in
general regards Mike the polo Mike the polo is your taste blows he says you jump on it real fast
the bandwagon and Jackie so anyway Joe Rose says she's uh here's Yvonne what what happened
I can't hear anything this computer's making farting sounds the computer is farting
he's broken it's broken see this is the other thing why do I have to be here to see this this is not
good for my mental health why do I need to be here to see this what just happened to it
what is he saying I can't see the creator blew up his computer who did easy CD creator blew up his
computer bring me a blew it up so we don't have our bedtime stories on there
are we gonna get those stories on there or not you know this is not he's stretching it a little
bit too far just like that picture picture you just saw he's stretching it a little bit too far
yeah come up to my Adam's apple we need to get the bedtime stories on there mister
anyway Yvonne says I can we put like a curtain over this half of the windows so I have to see his
gyrations of all this crap going on over there I can't deal with it I'm too old for that I can't
cope with it when I was like five I was too old for it I couldn't I can't stand it out of control
every every moment of his life is another problem you know every every millisecond is another
major problem another crisis either happening impending or thinking about conjuring one up
Yvonne says dear Neil I heard you talking about Cologne Germany again today I recommend Hamburg
Germany my husband and I go over here for about six weeks and we love it never been there
Hamburg it's a very sophisticated town with many beautiful people lots of things to do by the way
everybody should go to Europe at least once you're to see how real people live don't you agree
if I'm so really correct Yvonne I'm not an assiatic didn't hit it absolutely correct Yvonne thanks for
the tip on Hamburg oh my god here's another article lengthy lengthy article with teeny teeny tiny
print that I couldn't read with a gunman palmar telescope DC 911 spins tail of present on tragic day
wow and it goes uh thank god the print is so big can't read a word of it
five six seven oh five fifty it's our poll question for on a year today who do you like better Harry
Potter or Jackie Johnson what oh I see a lot of similarities you said bogus I think I think the
word applies in each case I think I think I'll have to be the same person I don't think that at all
every q I am hello yes sir this Neil Rogers speaking yes I can I respond to poll can you respond
to what did he pull that you did just now but then Jackie Johnson Harry Potter yeah go ahead
and I think Jackie Johnson's high and so Susan was yeah what does that happen with Harry Potter yeah
I vote for Jackie Johnson yeah you ever see Susan was on TV before no I have no idea who that is
she's on light FM the radio station she's on light FM yeah that hot chick in the morning well how
do you see her she's on NBC six in the air the news with the Greg Videll and oh yeah I saw that I
saw the promo for Greg Videll I wanted to go out and blow my brains out thanks for reminding me about
that thank you even though you're very boring guy uh seriously I mean not everybody can be exciting
he happened to be a boring guy that's his voice or maybe he just has no personality but if you
see those promos with Greg Videll are you lucky no one are you smiling and by the way Greg I don't
want to I don't want to get you bummed out or anything but everybody still hates you I'm not talking
about Greg Reed necessarily although you know you know Greg hate you but Greg Videll everybody
still hates you Greg I mean don't don't take it to heart unless you want to unless it you know
ruins your day but the people in this town just can't believe that like a bad penny you keep
turning up again and again and again and coming back just what we thought we got ready you you
went back to Chicago to seek your fame and fortune you went and worked for the country kitchen or
whatever that was and then you keep coming back in the media again and just spoiling our day

magnificent pieces of artwork ever and they just they just don't appreciate fine art no class
WQ I am well yes sir he'll yes I am great sensational
Jackie Johnson is a dog okay they'll come out there's a lot of otter he would tell you
the blonde on channel six is Martha the Galsy she's hot okay I didn't know her name and I still
don't but if she's the one yes you're right she is hot she's very odd that's it okay thanks thanks
Pellie so there you go so far we've had a whole bunch of people saying that Jackie Johnson
fuck third man it's so hot is what they're saying but then again the sports people on the station
they're trying to like build up that match of women today you know obviously have to say they're
the politically correct thing absolutely right Jackie Johnson she's a fox yeah right maybe
they're saying she's on fox because you know seven is like Fox winner that might be it maybe
that's what they're saying maybe our hearing is just bad Jackie Johnson she's on Fox and of course
even like Fox anyway she eats locks and what a box
here but it was long as I didn't mean to impersonate it was pair long socks
and brains like a box of rocks in fact maybe she'd like shot some Botox in her
voice maybe that's why her head is like she's rolling up like that maybe she got monkey
pox that rhymes with that too because her face looks like like somebody said yes they were kind of
like school report on Botox they did on I don't know what are these news shows or something like that
Botox injections gone wrong yes I did see that you know what I think anybody who does that
deserves it I think you know if you do that you deserve what you get it's like people that are
diabetic and eat a whole bunch of chocolate and candy and ice cream you know like me I want
to forget I'll deserve because I've been like punishing myself with crap like that kid that got
eaten by the alligator did you hear about that deserved it right they said get out of the water there's
an alligator coming I screw you I know what I'm doing right that's right gop that's exactly right
just like just like when clearance came back from Omaha and the beast was down there on in a hallway
on all fours I warned him I warned him I said you know clearance couldn't find squat in Omaha
and sure enough he did all I had to say squat and he did what is it he had the beast is going to
beard now you notice and you want it you do know the reason why before clearance and the beast
have a not you know where this is going I don't want to go there girlfriend he wants to make sure no
no it wasn't what you think that wasn't it although you do have a point he wants to have the
macho image so oh oh he wants to come out on top of that relationship thanks for steering
clear and especially since clearance looks so uh fade in those pictures we have on there a little
bit like fade Wayne if you ask me anyway I sure like to be a fly in the wall on the night of that

what was the view what that was legit it was legit hey she's a right-wing show for uh you know

they were held bent and trying to get me off the ear and here I am still here going
on the other end of the year so screw Fox all right Neil thanks for Martha that belongs on this
list too the new list are you passing on error we got it we got the how hot Jackie Johnson channel
seven is and Martha Stewart because the next poll question is which of these are you most sick

on that which would have been good no they want to talk about Jackie Johnson well that's okay too
sure and it's not like I'm all I did I just say yesterday in passing and then I happened to see
we're getting this morning because I'm getting up right at that time on the channel seven news is
on like at seven in the a.m. and I turn it on there she is doing the weather and I think this is

to return the ten bucks but when he told the guy that he made a mistake and gave Gully next
to ten dollars the guy said no I didn't so guess what Gully kept the ten bucks there you go
let me see this to you if somebody I mean if you have an IQ larger than your thumbnail
and you have a transaction I'm not talking about thousands of dollars even hundreds of dollars
if you have a transaction of like under 20 bucks you know if somebody gave you ten dollars too much
change or even if it's very early in the morning you're a little groggy haven't had your
a cup of coffee yet you know it's happened sure now that sounds really lame I don't want to pick on
Gully because he's you know got to cover his ass the way things are going on at you you think is
lying about what about that story I don't know all I do know is that at the moment the time that
it happened that's the time you say all patty made him a ticket give me ten bucks too much see it's
and right there and then at that moment yeah the guy knows sure now maybe the guys maybe too
embarrassed to take the then bucks back maybe you heard about it on a radio or somebody heard about
it and went in told me like again embarrassed something like that but if somebody gives you ten
bucks too much change you know it sure and the honorable thing to do is not to go on here like
some kind of a pipsqueak and squeaking around with you I should I what you think I should do what
look for a job oh here it is by the way he's still driving a show he's doing he's coming out of
the break out of the rejoins he's doing the time checks and blah blah blah blah blah and

direct TV when you get your direct TV build you ever like check it out now look at it now
she had any idea how much taxes we're paying now on the satellite down and I want to tell you this
I hate direct TV okay despite a direct TV I really do I hate it and why why
because it sucks because my digital cable in Toronto's got to beat hands down I got like 800
real channels on my digital cable because my direct TV box you know the one with the recorder what do
they call it the oh that's not tevo it's that's the same thing though ultimately that is the
biggest pain in the ass like this morning I get up and and if a bird forget about rain but if
a bird farts in the sky right away the thing goes out you got to unplug it and plug it back in
again reset it it's the biggest pain in the ass of any piece of equipment I've ever had in my
life I despise direct TV I hate it well I got the ultimate TV receiver a couple of years ago
based on you talking about it yeah I'm sorry you're all right I am losing my picture a hell of a
lot more yeah I don't have to reset it I'm sorry I did that to you if I would only know but anyway

out in 40 something dollar bill mm-hmm I'll make wine yeah they say well I'm sure you see on
your screen as it's just white satellite actors in California and basically the Florida
legislatures just like taxes from 6% to 13% the satellite and any other the expenses are gone through
the friggin roof I would take the damn receiver and put it out in the bottom of the pool is what I
would do just I'm serious just out of protest good luck you pal good luck from at its past new
and he made me feel bad because I turned it onto that ultimate TV thing direct TV and direct

picture on our website did you like the best very good battle here and it's good that we took this
down because with the additions of the other things over the weekend see what I'm saying it wouldn't
be fair to keep it on I think nice job Neil thank you oh god squirley most 79 they like that the
best they like that swinger he's swinging them most screws Neil that swing in most 73 a lot of
swing and going on there muscle bound Neil god 69 in fact you ought to take motor the swing club next

mow and gildey 43 mows of the clown 29 fruity clearance in the beast 10 and hairless toothless mow
has only got four is all that's got should be a lot higher than that absolutely fine and the new
pool is up there right now let me vote which of these are you most sick and tired of hearing about
I know what I'm going to vote for because I was it was the motivator for the pool in the first
place thank you the new hairy in fact just only moments ago on CNN there again with the pictures
everybody's running out to buy the book and a little punky kids and yet the one thing I notice
is that most of the kids that they're showing who are reading this book they all look like
Harry Potter they're like nerdy little kids with a silly glasses you know maybe that's why they
relate to Harry Potter nerdy little kids and other kids will talk to little nabs little nabs right
or little nips which of these are you most sick and tired of hearing my favorite picture is it really
Scott and lacy Peterson I'm sorry I misspelled that there's an oh it says so when I'm sorry or if
you can correct it or not make no difference three people say that well just went up there Martha
Stewart's got a pair did you see her with the umbrella the other day that was that was something a
lot of other people that umbrella is most of them had him closed because it wasn't even raining
but that was like to shadow her face like we don't know how old she is in the first place I hope
they fry your ass Martha I'm serious I like them to fry her ass and make the rest of her watch
when you're worth a billion yeah to break the law over less than three hundred grain over
a chunk change what you have your purse right even even beena boy makes that much in a couple
weeks I saw it on his stub a little while ago he showed you his stub he showed me his stub it was not
oh and that reminds me see how this works together here I was thinking about because I looked at
the counter again and we I made George right on their get clearance laid in big letters or somebody
wrote that who wrote that yeah and I'm just wondering the reason being there occurs because we know
he's a sports guy so he's obviously a very viral macho kind of guy but I'm curious do you think
that because he's so shy and so recalcitrant to like bond with these nice young ladies that want
to do him maybe there's something they're physically physically that we haven't like a war wound
not on a war wound like maybe kind of like a deformed like a dwarf penis or something or like a
like a nubbin uh well I have one of those and inversion like an intro version and you heard
of yeah navels that are in these in outies maybe he's got any penis any wini teeny tiny no it's just
they maybe he's got there's something a little out of the ordinary there I mean he is Jewish we
certainly know he's nice and clean and circumscribed oh maybe there was an accident not quite a war
was exactly I think I think now we're getting to the meat of the matter I think there might have
been like a little little little or maybe it's one of those button hook jobs too too much off the top
maybe it was cut on a bias he's not biased five six seven I said I want to pick on
clothes but I really am serious I think that we ought to get the guy laid just celebrate his 30th
birthday and and even on his birthday bash it is how he didn't get laid you know I think I have
a reason why okay I don't think anybody I don't think he cares about getting laid nearly as much
as the people around him do about getting him laid but what does what does he care about sports
I mean that was easy yeah ball games right go to Omaha I mean when somebody tells me that they
did like Omaha because there's nothing going on there I mean even Beenerborg was telling me to
the day about how anybody can't get laid in Omaha is never going to get any and he's right
Omaha's not what you think it is oh it's the Bible bell yeah right right I don't think it's
I think it's just like Nashville you remember my famous month in Nashville right Nashville is also
the heart of the Bible belt and known for that but it's also the heart of like the Alda Hillbillies
and there's church on every corner and across the street there's a bar sure well usually with
some country sluts singing in there you know you gotta be able to stumble from one to the other
exactly not necessarily that order by the way let me say it again sleepers great movie
with the father Robert oh the hero yeah what is he doing again now he's driving me absolutely
up the wall what is he doing Joe Castello will be calling on the hotline with a very good
proposal Joe Castello we just saw yesterday is back from our punishment yes sir I'm here on the
line I just happen to be hearing what you were talking about with clearance yeah and uh here's
the man who wait wait wait a minute here is a man who's actually seeing clearance his penis okay I
have not seen clearance oh I did see an email that came to me last night one of our mutual
listeners listen to you and George and I believe it or not he offered to have his wife
sleep with clearance like a pity uh whatever out of pity he did say pity we have a bad connection
pity yeah I said I said pity right and uh if if he wouldn't turn give me back my five to six
hours ah so yeah there there was a deal they let's know offered up his wife and totally legit so

WQ I am
Yes, sir
I heard you mentioning earlier about your ultimate TV
receiver with a different one other caller right I
Couldn't be happy with my system, but I'm surprised you haven't so many problems with it. Everybody. I know I hate to like poison
Really because they may just got lucky I guess it has to do with the the unit itself is just a lot of them are defective
They've had all kinds of problems. Well, you know, I will say that I did have to that
I would have an all kinds of delays changing channels
recording right and I sent they actually said okay send the receiver back
Ah, you know the one now you understand
See probably what I need to do is the same thing a different receiver his mind is defective
Well, I was still as soon as they sent me the new receiver
I was still having a problems when something was recording. I was always happy
It was just take forever sometime to turn the channel right and then recently they just did a software upgrade
I turned my TV on like three weeks ago and it's that upgrade complete and
They just upgraded the my shows and everything else and everything just works back right now works perfectly now working for me
But of course I haven't changed my unit 15 times yet either
I've only once for me. Hey question for you the Godfather's been on a lot lately on the all over the dish
I've been checking out of course
Every time I watch it always something always pops into my head
And I just a quick question for your opinion when they killed Hyman Roth at the airport
When the guy just shot him and he was pretending he was a newspaper reporter
Right right how to hell would they have convinced him to do that? No, he was gonna get blown away
He didn't know that he thought he was gonna get away with it
Yeah, I just just like just like the big
Bell and Legosi looking guy that was trying to kill him by smothering with a pillow. He didn't think he was gonna get it
Yeah, I was thinking maybe they just want to tell them no, don't worry. We'll have all our people there
You'll be safe and sound and I'm just wondering why the hell would anybody do that?
He thought he was gonna get away with it, but unfortunately didn't work too well
The party's over
Ever great day pal. Okay, so he said he had to change his unit. Maybe that's what turns out to try
Well, let me tell you something like my friend WQ I am

Isn't that the most recent one I think so okay. I'll think about it
Oh, and now we got to get to some of these very important bedtime stories because we're busy
I have it a really great time, but you know something is there important
Priest suit my brothers is arrested on suspicion of child molestations. Oh, no, this has to be a mistake doesn't
Retired clergyman is to be charged with alleged abuse of five children in the 70s and 80s
Between the ages of 7 and 16 and cardinal
Mahoney is a conceded that he mishandled a case he aired and transferring the accusations of sexual abuse
Michael Wempi was arrested yesterday on suspicion of child molestation
The arrest of Wempi near his sealed beach retirement home took places. They clergy sex abuse crisis
Dominated the opening day of the annual conference of Roman Catholic bishops in St. Louis
LA County Sheriff deputies arrested Wempi as he was on his way to play
golf
See what I tell you
A lot of lifeless assholes out there in the course man. He's on his way to play golf
Let it go out there whack a few balls around
Nice going father. You'll see the whole stir on our website and also this one
I am so impressed that I actually fixed my printer yesterday. It's just the miracle
And you know if I had to do it again, I couldn't do it. I don't know how I did it
Impressive
Because I had I guess installed the damn thing like fear for a different time. They had to uninstall
Get out and then what you uninstall something yeah and reinstalled it right and did it the right way this time
Though, which is why you got color on there now. Wow
Hey listen for me. That's a major accomplishment for an old farty farty farty-duty like me
Anyway, this story Toronto police ignore pot party in front of headquarters
dozens of green-wearing pot smoking revelers partied outside Toronto's downtown police headquarters yesterday
Smoking their joints, bongs and pipes without being harassed by a single police officer
Streams of sweet smoke walked into the ears cannabis crusader mark emery of Vancouver resident
Handed out joints to fellow potentuzists urged them to exercise their lawful right to possess marriage wini
Merawanna is legal in Ontario to possess and it's permissible on a lot of smoke
Merawanna anywhere and that is permissible to smoke tobacco in Ontario emery said calling the province the freest jurisdiction
In the western world with recent court challenges of pot laws and the acceptance of gay marriages
Although the event was right on police property no uniformed officers were seen among the crowd inside headquarters
Police seemed disinterested with the party and no officers made available to comment
I tried to if the police wanted to apprehend our pot they could have done so
I'm your said-of-the-not-so-subtle challenge to police
I thought the most provocative place to smoke marijuana with others would be right in front of the police chief's doorstep
Police organizations in Ontario have said they will not lay charges for possession marijuana under 30 grams until the counties
Countries muddled pot laws are clarified 30 grams now how many I thought it was like 20 joints is 30 grams of that you about right
Let me go get my scale
I beg your pardon how big how fat you roll the fat these were pretty fat. Let me show they were showed fat ones too
We're not talking about it in the Toronto star newspaper
30 grams is an ounce more or less yeah and how many joints can you roll out of an ounce
About 30 really about 30 man well there you go
That should be enough for like a couple of hours right so there you go there you hours are American hours
Canadian hours it's like really really 1.75
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T of Verizon
I don't forget the mad dog doing a show at
Hooters in Pembroke pines 2 to 4 the Humpro will be in the studio from 4 to 7 this afternoon
And then you got your marlins on decades 7 o'clock 7 35 now. Why is that why I'm afraid that they play 7 35 is that correct?
Why why not the other games are all 7 0 5 aren't they?
I guess they might make the Humpro work the extra
You know nobody gets a free ride all week fat
So so don't press the working extra half hour
But the 7 30 is the game the devil raised into marlins boy that's gonna be really heavy duty
And of course like I said don't tell willis is a starting picture tomorrow night supposedly and should be out with a mad dog this afternoon
But heads it's the one to two hour
Is it a guy?
Okay
This morning
I
I smoke to joy, to time of dreams, and do it time of war.
I smoke to joy, before I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to war.
Oh my God, he wants to meet her. You see her looking at me.
From my mind, he wants to meet her. You should leave as you can.
Then one day, I'm at the end, to save from me and say, you've heard.
I smoke to joy, and I'm a fine, but first take care of him.
So now I smoke to joy, when I get up, in the sky I smoke to joy.
I smoke to joy, when I'm the video game, and that's every 10,000 points.
I smoke to joy. I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to joy.
I smoke to joy, before I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to war.
Oh my God, he wants to meet her. You see her looking at me.
From my mind, he wants to meet her. You should leave as you can.
Then one day, I'm at the end, to save from me and say, you've heard.
I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to fight, because take care of him.
That's why I smoke to joy, in the morning.
I smoke to joy, the night. I smoke to joy, in the afternoon.
He makes me feel alright. I smoke to joy, this time of the day.
I do it, I'm a foe. I smoke to joy, before I smoke to joy.
And then I smoke to most, those two joys. That's what I do.
Oh two joys.
I smoke to joy, with me and in the morning.
Oh two joys.
I smoke to joy, with me and in the afternoon.
Oh two joys.
And with your brother, you smoke to joy, so when you're with him, you're home.
Oh two joys.
I know you want to say that.
Oh two joys.
Oh two joys.
Oh two joys.
Oh two joys.
Oh two joys.

And if you can't find a way, you might be gay.
Now, come on, don't be saying those things.

Hey Neal, I have a confession to make.
And I hope this confession earns me a shameless request of hearing that moe.
And Gerda Bid that goes, where's all the balls?
But the confession is that I am cracking down time maim
and I am Anthony from North Miami.
Yeah, so you just sent this in and you're the chronic that calls them line nine all the time.
I am, yeah.
Yeah, get out of here and idiot.
See, do I know him?
That's what I thought it was way back in the beginning because what he called the first hand.
That's also a second call of the day.
You're a chronic man.
We don't play that game on his show.
And the one thing we got to butcher all of about a little bit, little bit, is,
and we started doing that is just informing him, you know, giving me information,
giving me heads up and down and in and out about who these chronics are,
like the guy with the eyes, and that crowd, that crowd.
Because he ain't going to put up with that crap.
All those chronic assholes.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a 18.
Also, we'd like to find out who lets Gilbert and the O Station here in the afternoon or at night, overnight, sometimes.
Right.
Should've asked Yolk Kostell about that before.
I'm sure it's not him or them.
I didn't say it was.
I should've just asked out of curiosity what the deal is.
I mean, this is the kind of place you would anticipate people just wandering around just that kind of a place.
McDonald's asked me to industry to cut the use of antibiotics.
Responding to public health concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and farm animals,
the McDonald's corporation said yesterday that it would ask its meat suppliers around the world
to reduce their dependence on antibiotics.
McDonald said it expected its suppliers to face out the use of some antibiotics that promote growth and healthy animals,
and it's significantly reduced the use of other antibiotics to typically protect animals against disease.
It said it's making the change because of growing evidence that the use of antibiotics and farm animals was creating antibiotic resistance in animals and in the bacteria that caused disease in humans.
So in other words, if you had enough big max, you could pop like 50,000 penicillin tablets or tetracycline or whatever, erythrosin,
amongst the cellin.
Exactly.
And went to you know good.
Industry official said the McDonald's decision would likely help out of the way animals are raised around the world because
McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain, one of the world's biggest purchases of meat and one of the biggest purveyors obviously up till this time of antibiotics
that you didn't know you were getting into the one in the first place.
And speaking of Canada, Detroit, Americans visit border town to take advantage of a new game marriage law.
Game American couples are bringing the head for the border city of Windsor, Ontario. How's my good buddy Marty Adler doing?
To take advantage of Ontario's court ordered the legislation of same-sex marriages, by yesterday morning 13 gay couples,
three of them American have a granted marriage licenses in Windsor.
Suburban Detroit residents Jennifer Patty and Aaron James are among those playing the head to Windsor just across the river from Detroit to seek a marriage license.
They just need to do some paperwork required in Canada certifying James divorced 15 years ago.
We've waited this long, we can wait a little longer Patty told the Detroit news. How do you like that? They're pouring across the border, side by each, to tie the old knot.
Wouldn't that be great? Let's have clearance and like I said the other day, let's have clearance and the beast tie them out in Toronto.
You could take them up with you.
And then we can take them to a hockey game, right?
Clarence can get his sports fill. They don't have to go anywhere for the honeymoon, they'll be right there.
We'll give them the old hymen suite. That would be sweet.
56670560.

They've had it up to their ears.
But don't tell that out worse that.
Don't tell a little tommy.
Oh, hey, this is a great story.
New car warns of impending crash.
Do you read about this?
No.
Honda Motor Company has developed a new computerized radar system that warns drivers
and impending crash with slight breaking and a tweaking of the seat belt.
Ooh.
The collision mitigation brake system will be offered on the most expensive model of the new Inspire sedan
that goes on sale for $30,000 went on sale yesterday for $30,000 grand in Japan, Honda official set.
There are no plans to export the feature or the Inspire so far.
But Japan's number two automaker hopes the anti collision system will someday become standard and all Honda models.
The system comes as part of a package of options is not priced separately.
Japan's biggest automaker, Toyota, recently came out with a similar crash warning system,
which is offered as an option for a luxury model, solonial Japan.
Sales have been limited with less than 90 sold so far.
The Toyota system, which breaks and tightens the seat belt ahead of a crash,
doesn't go on until the driver first steps on the brakes.
Honda system is unique in working even before the driver responds.
A radar in the front of the car stashed behind the H logo detects vehicles with an arrange of about 300 feet ahead.
The system initially pulls on the seat belt and breaks slightly to warn the driver.
A buzzer also goes off and a small light flashes on the dashboard.
Just the subtle warning.
My bad.
Especially down here. Can't hurt.

they have on and the babbling sports nerds that are talking back and forth both sides.
Oh yeah, I remember hearing about this, but I still haven't seen it.
It's bus stop.
Bus stop.
Okay.
Just like I let you know about that.
Thanks paly.
It is a cute scene.

No.
I can tell by the look the answer is obviously no.

Especially for somebody on TV.
Oh, hi, I'm Belkies.
I'm shfilkeys.
I mean, what is that?
You got name.
Belkies, what is that?
That would be better.
Boy.
Come up with a name.
I mean, most of us have fake names anyway.
You can do a little bit better than shfilkeys, no array.
I think that might be a real name.
WDQA am.
Neil and Bunny Sado.
I bring you a hundred.

Boy, they really have run out this arm, man.
Just this last hour when I was looking to leave here on such a high note.
On such a note of enthusiasm.
In fact, look at this.
There it all goes.
Right down there.
Through these in here, too.
Oh, you want me to say the Mike Mayo thing, though.
Please, would you?
That's the only thing I'll leave here.
I want to clean up my mess.
I don't want to leave a whole bunch of crap here.
Not that I'm not.
I mean, it's only 125.
Not that I'm like, you know, planning ahead or anything like that.
I'm like, oh, I am.
Well, I mean, based on these calls here, it certainly seems like a good idea at the time.
WQA am.
See what I mean?
QA am.
Hello.
WQA am.
Yeah, my thick meal plate.
Speaking.
Look at that little Tommy Dunham bird.
You realize where you are, where you're stuck.
Oh, very well.
I don't want you to get depressed.
I am.
But you do understand where you are stuck.
Too late.
Oh, wow.
I mean, these are really special now.
These are the cream of the crap crop.
WQA am.
I've really tried.
I've really tried it like Howard David.
I can't stand the guy.
I get for all six detective eyes.
Sounds good to me.
Absolutely.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.
See what we have now.
These are not people who want to talk to me.
These are people with announcements to make.
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
In other words, there's no conversation that's going to take place.
These are people who want to make statements, announcements, and that's it.
That's no conversation.
You know, all that's something.
Oh, I listen.
I'll take it for another half hour.
WQA am.
WQA am.
Yeah, this is for all.
Give me some more.

So maybe she is a scum, K.
But I don't know.
I don't know.
When he finds out like what he did, like I said, we're not going to have a conversation.
He's, he's sticking out loud.
I thought that was a spectacular call.
Hi, everyone.
Welcome.
This is five cities.
We're here all yours now.
QA am.
WQA.
WQA.
Yeah, listen.
Oh yeah, we're searching for love for those weapons of destruction every day.
We're gonna be searching for the most urgent atmosphere.
Searching for the new decade away.
But I don't think we'll ever find out.
There were in there in the perfect.
Overfiring.
Yeah, high and low from house to house and under every roof.
New validate the spin of all those white house love.
If you still need convention to me.
I'll go see an ad for the other doors, a lion from the old man from there.
But we'll keep on searching.
You know what I'm saying.
Keep looking for proof of all the new decade away.
But you know that hey, hey, you're gonna find this.
Ain't never had them in the way.
Okay, speaking of searching, we got a real problem on our hands now.
I don't even know what it's called.
Here's a nice fact.
This is my first day listening to the entire show.
There's one big you do when some guy goes to a gate club and gets raped.
I was on the beach when I heard last time.
I had the volume.
Please play that bit for me.
We got Christina from the beach.
She was a high school student, which we love, of course.
And we know what the bit is.
Brian, who made the bit?
He don't know what it is.
What is it called?
Something QAM dating.
Something something dating.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
I got some discs in here.
I don't see it on the screen.
I just Christina, what are you doing to us?
I'm sure you must have heard it.
Maybe she dreamed she heard it.
Maybe it was just one of the dozen or five hundred other ones where Mo gets raped at it.
I don't know.
But we're looking.
We're searching for Christina.
Thanks for the nice facts.
And we are the best you write.
56670560.
So what we're going to do is,
George and I will look through this while being a boy.
He regulates and keeps the audience.
Aren't you supposed to be filling in the breach here?
Well, look, this is important stuff.
This is a new, a relatively new listener.
And she's going to spread it through the whole high school.
What about the sport whole mind?
I guess that's not it.
That's the wrong hole.
Mo in the beast.
No, Howard gets raped.
Now that's just your ordinary pedestrian.
I mean, that could be anyone.
That was the first one I think.
Fagidor and ginger, Gellie's balls.
Huh?
Here's one that's got an effinit.
Look at that.
What?
What?
What?
Effin something.
I don't really, I don't think it doesn't really get any bells.
Oh, what is it?
What it is?
You do?
I can hear it.
You can hear it?
Yeah.
In my head.
Sing a song.
Starts.
Oh, yeah.
I know what you're talking about, too, but what's all that I call?
Well, he's got to know what it is.
He's done it.
I sang it to him.
How do I know that one?
His book of Brian, too, it turned into.
Huh?
That's all I got that it's got the word,
Seamy.
He became a real chicken.
He just ate the same as he used to be.
Sport whole mind.
Not any of it.
Cheese.
We got a, this could be number one with four bullets.
Requiem for mode, that's not it.
That's the one where Geltie's dancing on his grave, I think.
Moe and Ferral, Ginger and Moe gave a union.
Raypeg, Rick and Suss.
Don't find it yet.
I ain't got it.
We're a surgeon, Kristina.
Have no fear.
We're working fibrously for you.
Can't find it, huh?
No, the fit, either.
WQIM.
Wacko line, QAM.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Jackie Johnson is a state of mind.
Right, that's what I said.
Exactly.
He is to TV news and do, uh, to feminine the,
what the Rascal House is to food.
Exactly.
Joe, Joe, uh, Rose said there was another girl on Channel 6
that's even better looking.
He's right.
She is hot.
I think even Tony Cigretto's hotter than she is.
Oh, he's, though.
And I would, he's gross.
You're right.
Oh, that face.
Oh, I know we all been around a long time,
but Tony's getting really long in the tooth.
He sure is.
And that Jackie Johnson, I think he's right on her push there.
Right?
I think you're seeing it.
Oh, my goodness.
Good luck, you pal.
Thanks for agreeing with me.
Yes.
Moe in the beast.
That's it.
Moe in the beast.
So you had it in your hand just a second.
I had it in my hand and you tell me it's about,
what was he saying?
It was QAMD.
Yeah, that sounds a lot like that, doesn't it?
Moe in the beast and QAMD, it sounds like exactly the same bit to me, don't it?
Moe in the lawn.
Moe in the lawn.
Did I actually read that one in my list when I was going through these?
Moe in the beast, yeah.
Oh, she done, you know what's going to happen now.
Now I'll go through this whole stack and I won't find it again.
Like I said, Christine or whatever your name was, we like you a lot,
but I could scroll in my show.
We'll find it.
What is it?
Moe in the beast.
Moe with Thakador and Enginger.
There's Moe hit by a truck.
Oh, how it gets raped.
Did it?
Uh oh.
Hold on, hold on tight.
Everybody on the beat starts squeezing their real tight.
Squeeze your cheeks together.
Because I think I had it on this damn well better be the one.
Now, both of you see.
Brian, tour to that?
Yes.
One moment please.
Yes.
I'm for the W-U-A-M beauty in the beast contest.
Let's meet our beast judge.
Start it with the illustrious great read.
Thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Now our next judge needs no introduction.
I'm sure you're all aware of our wonderful morning tour.
Right out of my way to the Dapetan.
Well, without any of the foie d'A-R-Dou-Dou-Dou.
I'll announce the award hunt of the beauty in the beast contest
so I can get out of here and go home.
All right, give me the goddamn envelope.
Here you are, M-O-T-A-R-D!
End of the winner is match lorette number one.
Okay, beast.
I am the beast.
You're a path little toyed.
Behind that curtain is your date.

Let me say number one.
I think as you can't think we're all the fat me ahead.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, you don't even harder to me.
Give me a minute here.
I can't think I...
Number one.
Take up your mind.
Who you think you're...
We do not want to be proud of you.
All right, beast.
Meet your mystery date.

Knock it off.
Get in the back of your head.

For her, yeah.
Excellent.
Well, she's ecstatic.
I mean, it wasn't one of my all-time favorites, but keep in mind, gang rape is funny.

cost of drugs in this country.
The 62-28 boat attached to the measure pending Medicare Prescription Drug Bill moving through
Congress, where approval in the House in Senate was expected by the end of next week,
lawmakers, especially those living in states' border in Canada, have been pressing for
the change for years, spurred especially by senior citizens in their states who board
buses across the border and by cheaper drugs in Canada, but the provision includes a measure
that could prevent it from ever becoming law.
It requires the Secretary of HHS to help the human services to certify that the
re-importation can be done safely.
Congress passed a similar law once before, but HHS Secretary of the Umshis Donna, excuse
me for being at the U of M, Chalela, would not certify that it could be done without
risk to her patients.
Her successor, Tommy Cheezhead Thompson, said the same.
That didn't stop the Senate from acting.
Senator Byron Dorgon, Democrat of North Dakota, successfully argued that Canada's safety
controls were just as reliable as those in the U.S. and U.S. consumers have nothing to fear
from drugs, law from Canadian pharmacies.
So what about the boroughs Donna would get is a bunch of repressive assholes trying to
like prevent people from saving money and getting ripped off by the drug companies here?
How can they galag you if you save money?
That's what I'm just saying.
Right.
They're trying to prevent you from saving money.
And the Republicans should not want to do that to them.
No.
No, they want you to like, they want you to empty out your pockets and give it all to
them and their buddies is what about boroughs now.
Just empty your pockets, empty your bracket out and leave it to us.
Trust us with it.
We'll take care of it.
We'll hold it for you.
Right.
We'll invest it.
We'll call up Mitch Hirsch.
Somebody that we can trust.
Somebody with a great track record.

Right.
Old news, ancient history.
WQAM.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Remember that guy that was talking about the Godfather with the guy who killed Hyman Rock?
Absolutely.
And it wasn't covered in the movie, but in the book, when the Godfather wanted to get
Michael Holmes safely and get him cleared of the murder charge, they would get somebody
who was terminally ill to confess.
I always thought the implication was that this guy had to know this was a suicide mission
to go kill Rock.
And they took care of their families and perpetually.
Well, no, that was Frankie Pentangely.
That was his deal.
Right.
He's got in the bathtub and open up his wrists.
Right.
The his family would be taking care of that.
And we don't really ever know.
You know what I'm saying?
In other words, you can assume that if you want, but I just got the feeling that, well,
you're probably right, because how the hell was he going to get out of there?
Right.
Right.
That's why I always thought, you know, he just opened his arms up and let him blow him
all the way down.
You could be right.
I thought he was ruddy.
Nah, not too fast, though.
He was thinking, go to the front of the back.
I think the answer is not fast enough.
Thanks a lot, Polly.
Have a good summer.
George does just fine.
Don't worry about him.
Don't worry about him.
He'll be fine, but he'll be okay.
I will, because it'll be the summer.
He's a good.
Take the canola.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, boy.
Do you like them?
Chocolate cover canola.
Doris market has got, oh boy.
Woo, we ever had those?
No.
Oh, don't.
Chocolate cover canola.
Now see, he wouldn't like it because he didn't like chocolate.
Plus, he likes crap, bland crap.
Never have linser troubles.
The wife's been buying those lately.
Linser?
Linser truffles.
They got us.
I had linser pilates for breakfast.
Linser, is that screw-in?
That's doing that.
I thought maybe Dorine was doing it.
She's the one with a big fat ass.
Screw-in is doing it.
It won't help that, Pichy.
You kid me.
She won't smell any better.
Screw-in is doing it.
What's he got the bellows out?
Is that what she's doing?
Yeah, she's doing the bellow thing with her legs.
The buck monster.
Yeah, the buck monster.
You're not a buck monster.
Poor screw-in.
And look, you could stand on your head.
You could twist it into a pretzel.
You're still going to smell the same, honey.
You're still going to be the same infection riddled piece of turd that you've always been.
What?
Can you imagine what's crawling around inside of that body?
Wow.
You know who can tell you?
Roy!
He's got the road, man.
To a piece.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
This is sports radio bicycle.
You way, yeah.
You fudge back him?
Coming up tonight.
I'm inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story.
They got us chanting along to their hit, poor some sugar on me.
But could the song have been about sex?
We'll find out from Death Lever.
What ever gave you the idea it was about sex.
Sex, that is rich.
Death Lever vocalist Joe Elliott spoke to inside the behind along with his manager Slavvy Gold.
That song is not about sex.
Right, definitely not.
I specifically told the boys write a song about sugar.
About how much you love sugar and you want it poured all over you.
In fact, if you had the choose between getting sugar poured on you or the luscious love nectar of some hot paid poured on you,
you would definitely not go with a sweet sticky, glistening moisture dripping from the nuts.
It's about sex.
Yeah, it's totes about sex.
I mean, well, you got it.
Of course.
So why asks inside the behind, did they feel the need to lie?
Listen, things ain't been too good for Death Lever since the 80s.
We've been looking for ways to make some dough.
So we're, we're doing a children's album.
Yeah, we thought we could put some distance between us and love juices.
But the bands are going to love this record too.
Don't you worry, the boys ain't going to compromise.
No way, we're going to rock you.
You know, with songs like, my best friend is neat.
And across the street with care today.
Right.
And they must do what mommy and daddy tell me.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
There they go.
Come on.
They're going to be, I want to take drugs and barbie.
No, no, no, we all got to eat.
Death Levered.
A band's got to do what a band's got to do.
But we'll all sure miss those references to female secretions.
It's a big, juicy, shopping-want-look-it-show business tonight, on inside the behind.
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to Dhamma people killed.
With the gas that we sold him, first time aggressor nation and the only one that's going.
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.
Forget about Korea and the notes they're totem at the right wing.
He's drilling it over and over into our head.
Her daddy rag has some, famines of mass destruction.
3000 people killed.
I'm not forgotten, let's exploit them instead.
Hey, there's oil to be counted.
Going after Saddam too.
Plankato Samma.
There's no longer mention of the name it lauded.
But no one seems concerned all.
Come be in complacence.
Believe in every word of this cartel administration.
That controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right wing.
He's drilling it over and over into our heads.
That I rag mess up.
Weapons of mass destruction.
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.
We're all suspects now, not the ash crop is saying.
I have nothing to hide.
Tables, bonkers, all are saying.
Blind obedient cattle don't have any reservations.
Bout a provoked battle and world annihilation.
Old regimes must fall and have a virgin installed.
With no objection at all.
Timber crack don't have the balls and the right wing.
He's drilling it over and over into our parade watchtap.
I rag pass up.
Weapons of mass destruction.
All we're buying.
Only I rag pass up.
Weapons of mass destruction.
Bye bye bye.
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now.
I'm taking your goddamn teeth in.
