Oh, you love me. Long time, son, young guy.
You love you long time.
Good morning, God. How are you?
Okay, Scott, what's up?
Oh, I thought that was glorious.
You were right about the...
Marlins again, let's say you haven't been wrong
about the Marlins once all year.
Even their dismal...
But, in this world, we're serious too, man.
It makes no difference.
Yankees are the red socks.
They both sucked. They're already the choke.
My father said that the cups would come out and game seven
and be only a shadow of themselves.
That the fans would be a shadow of themselves.
And they went out and...
You really got a little excited when it was five-three.
They were having their party on wavelength.
And that all ended.
To see coming out gets that ball.
I mean, just what went through your mind when they...
This team was 13. Games out.
You know what went through my mind?
Really what?
Is that I got two primo box seats.
Oh, yeah, eBay, they're into the three games.
And they're going to be on eBay.
And I'm going to make a fortune.
That's what went through my mind.
That is beautiful.
Yeah. Capitalism and its best.
Never went to one game all season.
And then, into a Marlin game in the years.
And I'm going to make thousands.
Thanks a lot, Greg, you idiot.
By the way, speaking of Greg Reed,
he was passing around a trophy yesterday.
Yeah.
Everybody.
That wasn't for QA, it was for power.
And now, I know it is, but he took credit.
And now, today is Boss' day.
And they passed around a card for him.
And I signed Boss' blow.
Yeah.
I got something for him.
I can't be there to sign a card.
But here's something, Greg.
To tell you what we all think of you.
You idiot.
Here's one for you.
How much do you think?
How much money do you think he can make on the world series tickets?
But, for the man.
That is so sweet.
How much do you think I can make?
I think that you can make a...
Give him a grand.
How many seats are there?
For each game.
How many seats available to the public?
No, to you, to you.
Oh, I got a pair.
For each game.
I think there were, um,
13-15 hundred bucks per game.
For the pair?
Yes.
You're in dreamin'.
The playoff tickets were going for a 25 hundred bucks
and a pair for Primo seats.
25 hundred a piece.
At the Marlins' Cup, they were not going for that price.
Well, that's what it said in your newspapers and they never lie.
Well, the newspapers lie.
Kevin Bass said I was...
The freaking Sun sent over to lie?
Well, Jim Sarni would lie for me.
He said, I don't see.
He sold them ugly.
They only let him out two days a year, like a groundhog.
Put him, put him, put him, put him.
I'll be here all the week.
Which is two days more than Barry Jacket.
Hey, most go on with the show.
Most go on with the show.
Barry has a little paper bag lunch that he takes to work every day.
And Mommy drives Barry to work at the herl.
Did you know that?
He's got a nice haircut.
Most go on the game and you know what?
He's turned into QAM and appearance fee to go to the Marlins' World Series.
Absolutely.
Yeah, it's great.
I got news for it.
They'll give him an appearance fee when he starts showing up after the book comes out today.
This is the big one.
No, no, no.
On the next Tuesday when we have a buyout a day on QAM.
Did it buy out my contract?
All right.
Buyout hits.
Better than those tickets.
I'm going to wear t-shirts that have a cross through his face that say,
fill us in and give him the any-why should we?
You're a bone through most nose.
That sounds good.
Yeah, I think he already does have a bone somewhere.
Let me tell you, wouldn't it be a great act of kindness after all these years for me to say to the audience?
Listen, because you've been so dedicated in the voter all these years,
instead of like peddling my tickets on eBay,
because I don't need the money.
Your buddy, Scott Jr., has given me a bunch of crap this morning before the show.
Oh, you don't need the money or loads.
I'm broke!
I broke!
I left my house!
He's a family!
I wanted that!
That's my job!
I have to work him away right now!
I'm here, just to show you what a good guy is.
I'm a kid, I have a war!
Why do people like to be waiting on my dress?
Just give my Marlon World Series tickets away today, but don't count on it.
No way!
Dude, I screwed a publicist's money theory.
When I make money, I mean, you and I can...
Listen, if I get tickets, I'll be just like Todd Greck,
I'll sell them for like 1500 a whack to one of my clients and rip them off.
That'll be great.
But, you think I can make his 1500 a pair?
Yeah, I think he should.
1500 per seat.
Oh, 1500 per seat, right?
Yeah!
So these three grand times these nine grand, I'll take it.
That's beautiful.
And then you get...
What are you gonna do with the money?
Maybe we can buy more cash.
We can't, I could have a pompadopark with nine grand in cash.
We can give five grand adi-candle, we'll buy more cash.
Why did you say that?
Because some adi-candle turned it into 15 grand and we can get rid of them all.
Have a great day, Neil.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
See us, guys.
Ireland's worth it.
Ireland's worth it.
Ireland's worth it.
Ireland's...
Give me another bag.
There's a big buster.
He's really showing his age.
He doesn't have to take more than a minute of him weight.
He can take him can ya.
If you don't work like a slave, take parts of DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
Got a dieting.
Black and 15 night to pay hold up.
A concletum life is a sided.
And he's a lifelike, a lay white, the art of DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
Oh, the chain of crappy chic, register runs DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
He's a fully waged to employees.
Adi-candle, arts of DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
I kinda cut the white and the men were a DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
With all the girls he's got, he drives around in the Dutch caravan.
DOOM's bag.
Dick got the gig.
Two replace-pile porn, who banged the kid.
In the back of his horn, that's all he did.
The band stand was born, the Clarkson DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
He seemed delighted.
With anybody with wind, the cashier prices.
On the fear of myth, he never mind it.
The cashier wasn't his, the Clarkson DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
I never realized what a fan piece of crappy is.
After all the years I've been working in, the Clarkson Crank Eel comes in every calcantre.
DOOM's bag.
DOOM's bag.
1006, how about those Marlins?
What do I tell you, Eve?
Little Faith, you could hear the girdling choking gagging sounds from those cubs.
You could hear them all of it North America last night.
It's not the crying.
The even George, I told you this yesterday, even George got sucked in.
The Cubs got sucked into.
I didn't know it was going on still.
But I thought I could check into it.
He just came across my accident and you just couldn't drive it at the end.
Right at the end, and it was perfect timing.
Right at the end, just in time to see the last five minutes.
And I saw the old lady crying and I went,
Oh, she's got a can.
I can't.
It was like when Frater was sitting on the curb there when Don Corleone gets shot five times.
Again, again.
He's like rocking back and forth on the curb.
Again, he's whimpering like mufflinzy.
Did you ever see Frater and Duck together?
No.
Same person.
Same shape.
Hey, by the way, Duck, don't go fishing this weekend, especially with Clarence.
He wants you a part of the gig too.
He wants to go to both titles and a whole paycheck.
By the way, speaking of earning your paycheck, Clarence, I hate to write the news to you,
but you're an idiot.
He's so busy sitting in a sniffing Forell's Bud that he doesn't have time to get the schedule right.
The game tonight is at 818 first pitch.
820 give or take is what they're saying.
820.
The schedule I got in front of me is got Hurricane Hotline on from 7 to 9.
And then they're, they're Ricky Williams show from 9 to 10.
You like that?
Whatever.
But it's also got like, for example, if needed, game seven,
you know, the Yankees and Red Sacks, it's got it at 9 o'clock.
Is that correct?
No.
The game is at 820, okay, in New York.
820, you idiot Clarence, you cymbled in you.
So evidently, we're not going to have like the whole Hurricane Hotline.
And we certainly can have no Ricky Williams show, are we?
No.
No, we're not going to preempt the game.
So unless we're going to join it in progress, I don't know, I doubt that.
Wouldn't that be kind of embarrassing, Scott?
Sure would.
That would be almost as embarrassing as farming out that Panther game.
And Scott, once again, as usual, is wrong.
Trying to tell me, no, you actually at the game last night?
Of course I was.
Because you had your free tickets for the, oh, penis coyotes, the lovely penis coyotes and the Panthers.
A penis one, two to one.
I watched about, oh, maybe 15 minutes of it here and there in between the baseball.
Now, I did not watch 60 minutes, two last night.
I didn't watch small,ville sorry, but I was really a baseball intensive.
I must admit, I watched the entire game.
How do you like that?
Wow.
Well, I mean, it was a heavy duty.
It was a lot of tension.
It was excitement.
It's an annual rate.
Huh?
It's an event.
It was a major event.
So Scott tells me there were 5,000 people at the Panther game last night.
You must be counting all the people at the Sawgrass Mills Mall.
You must have been counting all the people living in the 50 block radius.
Including all my neighbors out there, any acres.
I mean, are you out of your mind?
If it, seriously, if there were a thousand people in that Macarena last night, it was a lot.
And I was watching, they, they had on the package last night the Phoenix Telecast.
So again, they weren't protecting the local, uh, locals from, you know, from embarrassment.
So they kept, you know, they panned every now and then you saw the whole place.
There was nobody there.
And I'm not knocking anybody.
I mean, why would anybody be there when you got the, you know, Marlins and Cubs game seven on TV?
And everybody's transfixed and glued to that.
Why would anybody be at a meaningless early season hockey game, especially against the team that nobody cares about?
Yeah.
And the home team that nobody knows who most of the players are anyway.
The only cheering last night was when they put the Marlin score.
There you go.
Now, if they'd have been smart, they'd have probably telecast the game on the big screen up there.
Of course, the Panthers would have been too happy about that.
But you know what I'm saying? Wouldn't that have been a good idea?
It would have been.
Yeah, put it on there while they didn't.
But then again, the game up on the diamond, whatever they call that thing on that screen up there.
So the public can see it instead of seeing Galdes ugly, push.
Good God.
Scary.
So we got a big day today, boys and girls, a gigantic day.
We're just killing three hours here before we get started.
Right.
So one o'clock?
Play some music or something.
Yeah, let's just pretend, okay?
Like most every other day.
And then a one o'clock, we got the ratings this summer book coming up.
Oh!
That was summer book, generally speaking.
Isn't all that important.
But this one would make an exception because well, there's a whole bunch of reasons.
First of all, like little Georgia looks like it's going to hold up our end, I think, in midday.
Of course, along with the mad dog in that two to three hour.
Mad dog seems to be giving a good helping hand to the Humper who's on what about 20 minutes a week?
Huh? Don't exaggerate.
I didn't say that because today is mad dogs out today.
The big is on two to four.
We apologize for that ahead of time.
And the Humper is on for three hours.
And so he's he's getting in a full days work today, three hours.
So we got that element of it.
And then of course, the morning show, that's where the real pressure is going to come down.
Now we're not going to have the hour by hour because that doesn't come out the first day.
Georgia will have that on Monday when I'll be on vacation.
Georgia will have all the, it'll be on the website too.
And it'll be on our website.
So some people can read it and weep.
Absolutely.
You know what I mean? Read it and weep.
Absolutely.
Read that breakdown of six to 10 a.m. and read those six to eight numbers and weep.
And then see the eight to 10 numbers and say,
Oh, right. Look at that.
For else, kick an ass and six to eight.
Now disaster.
Absolutely.
I already predicted just like I predicted in Marlon's win and all these games and everything else.
Absolutely.
It's going to be a disaster.
By the way, it's got to hate to break the news to you. Yankees going down.
I don't think so.
The Yankees are going down.
I can smell it.
I can smell it all.
I can smell Bob Shepard's bag all the way up here.
I have to agree.
Bob Shepard's just turned 125.
What's heard from Bob?
Happy birthday, Bob.
Number nine.
Hank Bauer.
Number nine.
What number did Hank Bauer wear?
Yeah.
Oh, thanks, Robert.
Good to be surrounded by sports experts like Scott and Robert Creeper.
They know they're crap.
From minutes after 10 already at 560 WQM, you see how it's zipping right along?
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

They were Aqua.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You see in many綠絲 throwing
You see in many綠絲 throwing
Who played Barbie in the band's famous
And電視節目
And电視節目
And電視節目
Grammy. Wonder what that award ceremony was like.
And Dinvina is...
Aqua.
Thank you!
But winning the late-mask for an award is not all Aqua is known for. They were also sued
by American Toymaker Mattel, who owns the Barbie trademark. Mattel spoke to us through
an interpreter.
Okay, he thinks those... how... how... he thinks they... things up with their... those...
Aqua. Barbie is ours.
You Aqua.
But Mattel lost the case. A victory for Aqua. They spoke to us through an interpreter.
Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.
I believe that's... Nya, nya, nya, nya.
Aqua.
Those wacky Danish. Do they even know we named a breakfast food after them?
No.
It's a big, juicy, stopping red-looking show business.
Tonight, an insider behind.
Ten, eighteen, and five, sixty. WQM on a very gigantic, humongous Thursday. What a day.
A little to be realized there was going to be such a significant day all the way around.
Yeah.
And I would think that probably Clarence is digging up some world series tickets for our
loyal audience right now.
Especially, if you're getting slightly with that banner with the ball game on Sunday.
Wouldn't you think?
They had like Mo on there.
Absolutely.
And Mad Dog and Hank and Eddie Kay and Joe and Mark and the big...
Oh!
And Kim Bo camper and everybody was ever born.
Every sports nerd that ever came down to Pike.
They even had the names of dead people on there.
John Moynihan was on there.
At Berliner.
At Berliner was on.
Dave Lamont.
Lamont Cranston.
They were all on there.
Were we on there?
No.
No, on a banner.
Because they're embarrassed.
They don't want... They don't want to have the sixty-five thousand people sitting there.
God forbid we should promote the Nya Roger show.
Because that would be bad.
Because he says bad things about Greg even though they're all true.
Hey, Greg.
That's for Boss' Day.
BAM!
And don't bother me for Norm's number, no more, okay?
Hope you two have a great life together.
I think we got 1200 votes.
What does yours say?
I've been stalling there for a second.
That's a really long hang of it.
Mine's reloading and it says...
1200 is on.
1200?
1200 one.
Anyway, yesterday we asked what was the greatest radio station in the history of South Florida.
We left out... I'm sorry, our problem's rise.
How could I be so dumb?
Am I dumb?
Yes.
WNWS.
I mean, it only worked there for like six years.
That was the beginning of my glory.
Those were the salad days, baby.
And the Emery-All-Bolt-Lith Days.
All of those things, all those death threats.
What was the... Is or was the greatest radio station in the history of South Florida?
WSHE, she's only rocket roll.
R-03.
To your old four now, it just moved ahead.
W-I-O-D-279.
W-I-Q-A-M-145.
Ha-ha-ha.
A week-turt.
A week-turt.
You turn.
That's not so good.
Aren't you embarrassed by that?
See, part of the reason for that being that it would take a lot of really old farts to
remember the first glory days of QA M back when Rick Shaw was on air and Jim Dunlamp
and all of them people.
Right.
Like they.
Roby Young, huh?
I remember.
Yeah, but you're an old fart, right?
And of course me, I wasn't in town in those days, although I do have all the jingos.
We got all the jingos.
Anybody want to hear some old QA M jingos?
No.
We could kill some time up till...
Up till rating time, one o'clock, with some old QA M jingos like...
WQA M or...
But we don't want to do that.
Because then we'd lose all the audience.
They don't give a crap about old jingos or even new jingos.
WEDR came in fourth.
That's 99 jams.
They're jammed at baby.
111 votes for that hip-hop crap.
WZTA Zeta had 57.
So see, after the first four was like a big drop off.
Because the only great thing that was ever on Zeta was a certain morning show on there.
1987.
Other than that, Zeta blows and has for a long time.
Too much CCR, too much...
Me, Kimba.
And of course, too much Paul and Old Ron.
WGTR 40.
I don't know.
What ever happened?
Did the ratings tank?
What was the deal?
Did they dump GTR?
That caused a certain amount of constipation in town.
Oh, it's a very simple thing.
First of all, it was a Cox company and you know how bottom line oriented they are.
Oh, that's right.
They had to pay Hermann and McBean some serious bucks.
They had talent that they had to pay on GTR besides Hermann and McBean.
And they copied the West Coast coast, if you recall, which was a cash cowed jukebox.
Right.
That's jukebox.
That's why they brought Bob Greenin.
He was the leader of the jukebox.
WCKO K102, which was a really heavy duty.
The really rocks, they hard, hard, hard rock.
It was really hard.
36, but they had a crappy signal.
And like they got a call, they used to work there yesterday.
He said they sucked.
He said the station was good, but the management was idiots.
He didn't know what the hell they were doing.
What else is new?
WBUS, the bus, the magic bus had 35 votes.
When I first came to town, the bus was one of the first FM.
It may have been, I don't know, maybe in the only FM station that anybody paid attention
to at that point.
1976.
Magic bus.
You know who worked there?
W-H-Y-I, Y-100.
What?
33 votes.
Now, see the problem with this pool, it's a good pool, but there are various incarnations
of all of these stations.
Right.
Like W-Y-O-D went through several different things, and Y-100, two different periods of time,
and different people were there, like Samwood Zeta.
Y-133 votes, probably mostly for your friend Tanner.
What?
Certainly not for a footy.
Right, and the votes for a footy?
No.
Everybody hates footy.
He's an asshole.
W-T-M-I.
What?
Cox and Kid Curry in them.
Cox was on Y-100?
I thought he was.
Wasn't they all?
I guess.
Kid Curry was on Y-100?
I thought they were all there together.
G-Michael.
Really?
Really?
I thought I thought.
Yeah, Jim really, too.
Jim really.
W-N-A-S-L.
Now again, you'd have to go way back to the Jerry Wissner with the kid stole his wig, his
hair piece, and a parking lot, and he had a nervous breakdown.
Those old time days at INZ, and then of course there was my thing there at INZ when we're
doing like Old fart radio.
And then in 1986, what I decided, hey, this is boring.
Let's do something more interesting and exciting.
And we had a big, big book, 12 plus we had up here.
Yeah, sure.
You ready for that 12 plus?
In the younger demographics, it was all like double digits, 15, 17.
So it was unbelievable.
It was incredible.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
And then they shipped me off the Zada, and then the rest of the history, and I'm saying
a...
Yeah, sure.
You know, we were playing that hurricane promo.
Have you noticed the voice sounds like Lancet or on there?
No, I don't notice our promos.
Oh, I saw it.
W-N-Z-A-M-15.
W-N-Z-F-M-I-95 had 14 with Earl de Poureau.
I-95.
It was down to the bad station.
It was Rocky and Rolly.
I remember the night that they had all the teenagers come down scantily clad in their
underwear to give boys some concert tickets, and then somebody...
Some asshole listener called the cops.
There's always some asshole out there in Radio Land.
Always, no matter what's going on, there's always one sour, really hostile asshole.
I'm gonna call the cops.
They got a bunch of teenagers running around almost naked, yeah?
I think whoever it was probably was jealous.
There were some pretty damn interesting people in there too.
Anyway, Waxi FM-13 back in the golden days of Waxi when Ricky Tiki-Shaw was there acting
like a Nazi and Ricken Suz.
Greg Piedel.
That's I think when they started going downhill is when Biedel came in.
Am I right?
He destroyed it.
I wouldn't know.
Every place he went, he destroyed it.
Love 94.
Waxi?
I'll tell you, you sure got a lot of press for a guy that had to have failed so badly
everywhere he went.
He did very well, though.
I understand if they sterling country kitchen.
By the way, Troy Stradford, we have no copy for Brandy Shoeon.
I just noticed at the corner of my eye, it's the 62nd away from that spot.
You idiot, you simple.
What is wrong with him?
I think Todd Dreckad took him under his wing.
Waxi FM-11-13.
11 for WVUM.
WVUM, it's Microsynthol.
The hurricanes are going to win again.
You made a mistake on Microsynthol.
WCJX-96X, I'm sure that's the station of law's license for phony contest.
11.
WKPX, Piper Hyad 10.
I'm embarrassed that WUM had one more vote than KPX.
What's wrong with you people?
W probably Robert Greeper voted several times.
And also who else we got?
That's a her own clearance.
Another hurricane alumnus.
WMX and the Beast probably voted three or four times.
MXJ8, KISS-7, 98 Gold-6.
How about, oh, you know what we left off for here?
How about WGBS, Ken Maldon's never going to speak to me again.
We left off WNWS and WGBS, Arnie Warren.
He was terrible.
I guess we got to do it again.
Hey, let's do it again.
WRMF-5, Love 95.
Love 94 had five or Love 95 had four.
Surf had four, WS RF, probably for Jack Mark.
WA1A, your music weight, Helen Anderson four.
WHQT, Hot 105, 3WKAT, 3KAT, WCKR had two and I have no idea why.
Life had one, WRBD, Rock and Big Daddy had one.
And WGMA in Hollywood, Country, Kick and Asht, look at, look at,
Jerry Woods knew that had one vote.
So that's it out of over 1200 votes.
I thought it was kind of interesting.
Today we're doing this, Jockeys.
Well, maybe you are.
No, I'm not saying anybody, I can think of.
How's WBD doing, by the way?

We are Sports Radio 560, QAM.
What you to take your head out of your own ass?
Okay.
And days from walking down the aisle
This is up inside your sand nose
With any transit, temperature, you see
I'm here to it, Bentley, and say,
I'm out of your soul, I'm gay, no.
No matter what you find yourself, another stroll.
Brandy said,
Hi, I'm two to five.
Welcome.
And she went up and off,
a screaming, and as if you're the way,
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.
You grabbed the flight to Vegas,
and hit all the strip clubs.
Girls were craving just nicely,
we're given better life,
since he was hotter than the freaking cold.
Brandy said,
Hi, I'm two to five.
And she went up and off,
a screaming, and as if you drove away,
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.
From the time they made a jersey,
they stayed in her home.
I was standing here,
the couple was touching,
and she really went,
the whole mess was a big damn bomb.
They don't have to go,
you're back.com,
missing back to the bus.
Back, back, back, go, back, go.
And she went off and off,
a screaming, and as if you drove away,
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.
33 at five, 60 at W.C.
I'm just,
anybody care about those losers anymore?
No.
No, even the cubs we don't care about,
no more.
Now this facts from Larry,
I guess we should do the poll for today.
Let's introduce it.
Is it one o'clock yet?
Damn it.
It's getting close though.
It's already 10.33,
and pretty soon it'll be 10.34,
and then you know what happens after that?
No.
10.35 is most still alive.
No.
Who is or was your favorite,
since we did the radio stations yesterday,
it's a good segue, I would say.
Who is or was your favorite,
radio disc jockey,
not talk to your host of all time?
See, the reason I put that in
the radio,
is because I'm not talking to you.

what, oh, by the way, I thanks for a revised schedule,
and there was a dialing error, so it comes across twice,
that's why.
I see.
By the way, clearance, your real bonehead, man, okay?
clearance is going to start having a bone through his nose.
Of course, be sitting here to bone,
well, let's be starting to point.
You don't want to kiss my drip, like,
anyway, 56670560,
pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Marlos Line,
who is or was your favorite radio dish jockey,
not talk shows of all time?
I mean, we just got a few votes on here,
because obviously most of the people listening,
don't have their choice on or yet.
Wolfman, Jackie, right, those got eight out of 13.
Ricky Tiki-Schroes got two.
W-A-Q-A-M.
Yeah, hello, good morning.
Yes, sir, what is this?
Scott Mune.
You know Scott Mune?
Pune Scott Mune, W-A-B-C,
all over in New York, everywhere.
I W-A-W-N-W, that's correct, sir.
That is correct.
Thank you, sir.
Absolutely correct, sir.
All right, calm down.
Pune Scott Mune.
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely,
absolutely correct, sir.
Pune Scott Mune, W-A-B-C.
Remember Scott Mune?
No.
Yes.
Scott does, because he lived in that, in the vicinity.
That demography.
Yeah, I can't say demographic.
Scott Mune.
See, we get some real names on here.
There won't have some votes.
W-A-Q-A-B-A.
Oh, yes, sir.
Hey, I got a DJ for you.
Okay.
DJ Disturbing.
I never heard of him.
Is it one yet?
W-A-Q-A-M.
Can I have the keynote?
Q-B-A.
Speaking, we're doing screenless, man.
Let's get with it.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay.
Listen, how about the morning, baby?
Wait on the one, baby.
Yeah.
So, what is that?
He won the tickets.
Yeah, he won the two bad.
I already cut him off.
Damn it.
I was going to give you tickets for all three games.
Damn it.
Well, try calling back.
5'6, 7'5, 60, £5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
How about the mornings, baby?
I'm on the bandwagon.
Hey, bye to go, Marlon.
You know, Pudge Red Rigg is not only one of the MVP for the series,
but he also won the MVP for most times
putting it to Sky and Crossing himself,
which I was very proud of that.
He eats Sammy after that.
How many times in anything?
About third man.
Yeah.
Even eats Sammy's Sosa, and also who are remearsed as it'll odd too.
Won't be seeing him no more though.
I'm sick and tired of that crap.
I'll tell you that right now that pointing at the sky.
You know, just cut the crap already.
Okay, if you want to believe in furry tails and the tooth furry,
go right ahead.
Look under the pillow and see what's it.
God likes the whole set.
I will say Pudge still looks pretty good.
He even knows he got that big fat ass.
He looks good.
Now, let's see.
Do we have the...
What is this?
We don't have any baseball on tonight?
No.
I don't know.
I didn't read it.
I just passed it.
Well, why not?
God doesn't do me.
What is this all about?
I thought we were your sports intensive station.
I'm promoting the game as an A20.
And the revised schedule shows Noah Boston in the Yankee game.
Well, what kind of a communist pile of crap is that for young girls, huh?
Just when we were starting to kick a little bit of ass,
they pulled the Yankee right from underneath us in a rug too.
I'll be God damn less because we got to get that hurricane hotline in from Tony Romans because it's sponsored.
And certainly we got to get the Ricky William show on, don't we?
No.
Who the hell wants to hear that crap?
Dan LaBaster just tongueing and licking and rimming.
God, it's disgusting.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
So that's the schedule.
No baseball tonight.
I guess somebody else will probably pick it up.
And we'll be sucking wind.
W-Q-A-M.
You guys have tickets?
I beg your pardon?
You guys have tickets?
Do we have tickets?
Yes, speaking tickets.
Yeah, 100 on the 55.
You want to pay?
I said, have a nice day, bitch.
Fine.
You guys have tickets?
You guys have tickets?
Oh, man.
She couldn't give a flying fart about the Marlins until right now.
You're into that even bit Scott's life on it.
No chance.
Oh, do you want security counsel to prove your rac resolution unanimously?
They said, let's go in there.
Let's see what we can do to straighten out your mess.
Some agreement on a rac resolution.
It's a recognition by countries like Russia, who you see right now.
That it's a mess.
And you guys have tickets?
W-Q-A-M.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I would love to get a parent ticket.
It isn't possible to get through to ticket master to get tickets.
I have been in a camp since 93.
Yeah, so what do you want me to do about it?
You said you had some tickets.
What?
You said you had some tickets.
Yeah, I got my tickets.
I got mine.
You're not getting them.
Okay, I'm selling them on eBay.
Okay, if you want to go on eBay and see if you got five grand a piece, 20 grand a piece.
What's your free loading phone?
He's free loading, front running and free loading phone.
I love it.
Last season, man, you can, in earlier this season, George couldn't give them Arlen tickets away.
There were people coming to appear.
He's got one to say to the Indian.
Give it to him.
Bring in their tickets and say, hey, give these away.
We don't want them.
We don't want them.
This is going to have them.
They're too crappy for us.
People think they're lying.
Can we have tickets?
And that's all they got to say.
They have nothing to say about you.
Hey, what a great job, Jack McKeehan and Pudge and Fudge and Jesh Beckett and all these guys.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Zip it he do down.
In fact, they wouldn't know.
Most of these people want the tickets.
How many people, how many names on the team do you think they know?
Maybe two or three.
Maybe.
Right?
I know what Rodriguez.
There you go.
I don't know his first name.
And you left out Gonzalez.
There were two of them.
Oh, there's one.
WQAM.
Neil.
Yes.
And now we need Jim Dunlap.
Jim Dunlap.
Okay.
Thank you, chronic lady.
That's the most chronic of them all, boy.
She's really chronic.
But that's all right.
We even have Jingos for Jim Dunlap.
Can we have everyone?
No, I don't need to hear you one.
Jason Piger.
Jim Dunlap.
What's the goal?
WQAM.
And we even have Samura.
And we're going to have the Oscar Pelos to build a short, huh?
Oh, just fire went on.
No, no, seriously.
We're going to have those.
We got them in here somewhere.
Just one moment please.
No, I want to play the Jim Dunlap one.
If we got it, I don't think we got it.
We got it.
We got it.
We have one for John Moynihan.
John Moynihan.
Roseports.
Radio.
My 16 WQAM.
No, there's still aren't the ones.
I'm talking about the real short ones where they just say the name, you know?
Like.
The Florida Marlins.
There you go.
How do you like that?
Oh.
Let's hear it for the Florida Marlins.
Oh.
The Florida Marlins.
Oh.
The Florida Marlins.
All right.
The Florida Marlins.
Get it, Kaplan.
Get it.
Now, what was this Scott talking about for this morning about getting a casket for Radio
K.
What was that all about?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know what it was into that crap.
To what crap?
Exactly.
Now, when we did the crossover at 10 o'clock, you let's get a casket for Radio.
He's just incurring.
He just blurt out a lot of crap, which is why we love for real.
He just blurt it out.
Wait until he gets the hour by hours on Monday.
He's going to be blurting them a lot and then mosegum.
Oh, well, it must be an aberration because we're following that low rated joy and mark show
and they shove this back into the middle of the night.
And that pipe smoker keeps making all those comments about me.
And then those key chains, I should never go along with that crap.
Yeah.
Don't forget, new into two today, Miguel.
Pingo.
Pino, Tile and Carpet.
2101 West Atlantic Boulevard in Pompo, and I'll look for the QA and Van and bring a lot of cash.
Okay?
Speaking of Marlon tickets, World Series tickets.
Ask Miguel.
Oh, poor Miguel.
Can I fix his ass?
That's what I want.
Wow.
Can I fix him, but good.
He never speaking me again.
It won't come back.
He'd probably even be so busy.
Cut the renault.
Oh, okay.
Let's not do it that.
Let me say very clearly, very succinctly, Miguel.
Probably doesn't have any real.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
But you know, he's in promotions, though.
So just maybe because he's such a good guy and he appreciates our fans so much.
He just might, you never know.
It's worth going out there.
So where won't he be at the end?
And say, please, please, Miguel.
Please Miguel, who looks almost as good as Miguel on passions, but not quite.
I guess Scott Jr. knows Miguel and all of her.
He was my phone ringing.
I beg your pardon?
Why is my phone ringing, I wonder?
Is it really?
Yeah.
You're just joking.
He's listening right now, and Miguel isn't going to, well, I'm not positive, but I don't think he's going to have any World Series tickets out there today.
But you don't know unless he asked.
1056 and 560 WQM, if you're underpaid, if you're overworked, if you're underappreciated, get out of your dead end job.

Hi, this is Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News with a one-on-one interview with gubernatorial hopeful Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I apologize.
What do you apologize for? I'm not following you.
For everything, Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News, I'm sorry to the people of California.
For what? Those bad movies you make?
No. Although, if you don't like them, I'm sorry, Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News.
I'm sorry for this.
You just touched my booby.
That was a demonstration, Kimberly Plummer. I'm sorry.
Well, don't do your demonstrations on me, Mr. Schwarzenegger.
I am here for a serious interview with you.
I apologize. You're very whiny.
Boy, hey, with your question. Well, you're very touchy-feeling.
I apologize.
Oh! Excuse me. But did you just touch my ass?
That was a demonstration, Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News.
That's why I want to apologize to the people of California.
And I believe you should. I'm sorry.
I see you have a problem with women.
I don't have a problem with women. I like to touch them.
Excuse me, but we are not an object.
May I see your aunt, either?
It's my what?
Your aunt, either. May I see it?
I don't think I have an aunt, either.
You have an aunt, either. That's right, you.
That's your aunt, either.
I can't believe you just put your hand.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, are you pilots?
Oh! Do it again.
Yeah. Good for you, Kimberly Plummer.
You want me now, don't you?
Europe.
Let us have your aunt, either.
Oh!
I love you.
I'm sorry. I apologize.
You are disgusting.
I want to be the governor.
Here, pull my lever, vote for me.
Ew. Why is it purple?
I eat grapes. I'm a grape, either.
Pull my lever.
11.02 at 5.60 W.N.E.
Two hours away from that big summer book, man.
There's enormous pressure. In fact, my irritable bowel is acting up again just because of it.
So here's a good choice for our poll from Rick, who says, and I would hardly agree, is one of the best ever.
Greatest DJ ever, Bill Bailey from W.A.K.Y. in Louisville.
Ready for that?
Whatever.
I'm just stalling until this thing starts playing.
Oh, you ready for that?
No.
The first thing I heard this morning from my radio was your introduction to your 20 before the hour sports report.
Mr. Yaden, that's your reason why I was a little bit late this morning.
I had a way I wanted to mention this morning, I plan to make this two or three times.
That Thursday night, I'm going to have a series of softball games out here at St. Helensfield and lively, shyly.
Now the press game at 7 o'clock will be between Alan Hamilton and his deputy sheriffs.
And the work that city was great.
Bill Bailey went to W.A.K.Y. in Chicago and did mornings for about five minutes and bombed for whatever reason.
I don't know why they just didn't take to him.
While they were probably still sore about the covers loose near the air.
You know, and if you think they were pissed off then just wait.
You ain't see nothing yet.
Bill Bailey and him to the list, please, said,
400-pound man rescued after he plunges through Flora Mobile Home.
But I did not see the CBS two last night, but I do have the story here from CBS News for a little bit later on when we have some good time to kill.
About Colin Powell being a freaking liar.
But beside that, Newport Richie from Borsehead.
A Pasco County man who became trapped in his mobile home on the floor gave winter, was rescued by emergency workers.
The manager of the mobile home park found the man who reportedly weighed 400 pounds yesterday.
What's your weight today?
About 320.
There he was in that little bedroom sitting in a little hole, said Jean Morton of Orangewood Lakes Mobile Home Community.
Morton identified the man as George Daniels, 61 city fondaniels conscious but disoriented, sitting with his head bowed.
Maybe he was just checking out lunch.
Morton said Daniels told him he had been sick for two days.
Been stuck for two days.
The emergency responders weren't so sure.
They would ask him one time and he'd say a day and then he'd say that an hour a day he was a little confused.
Maybe he was going through a hunger withdrawal.
The floorboards in his home may have rot underneath the carpet Morton, said he called 911 after getting caught from one of the man's neighbors.
And why am I reading this? This is one of the most horrible stories ever read. Why am I reading that?
I think it's funny.
Do you?
Yeah. About a 400 pound guy getting stuck into floorboards in some mobile home park.
The manager should have sold tickets.
Shame on you.
You know what I should have done when I'd build Bailey thing which I'm not too bright.
What I should have done was just got my cursor on the little dot there and moved ahead a little bit because that was obviously a really ponderous thing there.
36, 24 minutes before seven o'clock at WAKY. Good morning Bell Bailey.
That's cool.
You catch that line.
But forgets best of me.
You see he substituted for the ailing chimulo this morning he says to me.
Boy, I wish you had stayed home.
I could have worked an hour.
Why didn't he call me at home and tell me that instead of waiting until I showed up here.
But I couldn't use it.
I would have been happy to stay at home until seven.
23 before seven o'clock at WAKY.
I love being so nice to be with you.
Great.
Bill Bailey was outstanding.
He was one of a kind.
You know what I'm saying?

He's very bland.
As we discovered when he came in sucking out free lunches.
Remember that day he showed up.

I had to make them chase him away.
Yes.
That was embarrassing.
Why don't people do things like that?
I wouldn't show up.
I didn't fight it.
Which I wouldn't have minded feeding him a free lunch.
But I really would have minded him sitting there expecting me to put him on the ear
and put the audience into a coma.
I mean Johnny you're a good guy.
I'm delighted to know you man.
You're okay in my book even though they did close up due to us because of you.
But nevertheless.

You've been enjoying the fresh delicious goodies that everybody loved all those years and still does at Vickoners.
You'll find them on federal highway.
Just south of Broward, Boulevard and the tunnel on the east side.
Vickoners is like a flashback in time to what restaurants were before fast food.
Go and enjoy a burger hot dog served hot fresh and fast.
Vickoners is being brought to you and for a lot of the other day about the same guys.
If you'd be a cheaper, a cheaper and the good news also is that Vickoners uses the same delicious fresh.
100% ground-shock meat as cheaper, cheaper.
And offers you an incredible big fat one, a quarter pound hot dog.
What makes Vickoners so different from anybody else in town is that the burger's dogs are all served with Vick's signature meat sauce poured on top giving you a wild, unbelievable, erotic combination of flavors in your push.
If you want something really great to try, check out the great breakfast menu with Vickoners.
Omelettes, cooked fresh to order French toast pancakes on your favorite side dishes.

Since it's two of the all employees and listeners a qum would rather be skinned head to toe and dipped into a bath
Advancative rather than have a slight fondness toward the moman
Why would you be offering a portable product containing most idiotic phrases that can follow you everywhere you go?
Because it's funny that's why people shouldn't have to pay to have this keychain nevertheless
I did purchase your CD strictly for the animals, but I many people would rather drown a cat themselves and have most voice trailing them around
See everybody's making an excuse it's why nobody wants to come through with a cache if you don't want the keychain or the CD
That's okay. We'll take a check made out to abandon per rescue 10 bucks a hundred bucks 50 bucks 5,000 bucks whatever though
You're wrong. They're not making excuses. What does that mean? They're just not doing it. Yeah

QN62 former pastor of San Henry Catholic Church in Miami Township
That's Miami Ohio which charged with one kind of public indecency six counts of furnishing booze to minors and four kinds of allowing minors to
Possess or consume booze on his premises
County prosecutor Matthias Heck Jr said the investigation of Koon is nowhere but the grand jury brought the 11-9 minutes yesterday to avoid any
Statute limitations issues
The offense is occurred at his home in Miami Township November 2001 in January 2002 include five victims
Formal in one female 18 years or younger
He has since moved to Cincinnati

Huh I don't care either because we got out of the way now
We have like a nice long one and the long segment too. Is it really a chance to just read this?
From CBS news x-8 says Pala misled Americans in other words. He's a freaking liar
The
Person responsible for analyzing the Iraqi weapons threat for Colin Powell says the secretary of state misinformed Americans during his speech at the UN last winter and he is
Greg dealman tells correspondent Scott Pelley of CBS news that at the time of policy speech
Erak did not pose any imminent threat to anyone not even its own neighbors
I think my conclusion about policy speech now is that it's probably one of the low points in his long
Distinguished service to the nation says dealman
Pelley's report was broadcast on 60 minutes to on CBS last night while the rest of us were watching a Marlon Cup game
The human also tells Pelley that he believes the decision to go to war was made first and that the intelligence was interpreted to fit that conclusion
Kind of like the Warren commission
The main problem was that the senior administration officials have what I call faith-based intelligence says dealman
They knew what they wanted the intelligence to show they were really blind in depth to any kind of countervailing information
The intelligence community would produce I'd assign some blame to the intelligence community and most of the blame to the senior administration officials
Steve Allanson and it does another UN inspectors in Iraq also boxed policy speech various people would laugh at various time during policy speech because the information was presenting was just
You know didn't mean anything had no meaning said Allanson
Pelley asked when the secretary of state finished the speech you and the other inspectors turned to each other and said what
Allyson responds they have nothing
Allanson gives Pelley several examples of why he believes Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction
One time he was sent to find decontamination vehicles that turned out to be fire trucks
Another time a satellite spotted what they thought were trucks used for biological weapons
We were told we were going to decide to look for refrigerated trucks specifically linked to biological agents
Allanson told Pelley we found seven or eight trucks
I think in total they had cobwebs in them some samples were taken and nothing was found along came a spider and sat down beside her
Eating its curds in way how do you like that uh
Not unlike her so like I've been telling you all the long freaking liar
It was all decided 1999 four years ago up front long ago
Guys and good with that story about how Halleberton is overcharging is ripping off the public
You see that story on what a shock yeah
From the Washington Post by Sue Fleming no relation to Vic Fleming remember the Vic Fleming trot
No
US Democratic lawmaker or yesterday accused Halleberton the Texas oil services company once run by vice president
Dick Cheney of overcharging the US government for gasoline the firm imports into Iraq. What a surprise what a shock
A bunch of thieves a bunch of bandito stole the 2000 election and they taken over the whole god damn world
Just like the uh lone ranger in reverse like Robin Hooden reverse stealing from the poor giving to the rich
Halleberton's of city are a Kellogg Brown and root
As the contract with US Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild a racks oil sector
Which is included importing gasoline products and short supply to the over rich nation
Millions of Americans want to help Iraqis, but they don't want to be fleeced by Halleberton
Representative Henry Waxman that bald guy from California with a little mustache told the news conference
Waxman said army document sure that as of September 18
US had paid Halleberton 300 million dollars to import about 190 million gallons of gasoline into Iraq
Halleberton charged an average price of a dollar 59 per gallon
Excluding the company's fee of two to seven percent said Waxman
He said the average wholesale cost of gasoline in that period in the Middle East was about
71 cents a gallon a figure in oil industry source told writers was accurate
Which meant that Halleberton was charging more than 90 cents a gallon to transport fuel into a rack from Q
Kuwait
When we checked with independent experts to see if this fee was reasonable
They were stunned said Waxman adding a reasonable transport cost would be 10 to 25 cents a gallon
Especially as the US military was providing security
Waxman sent a letter yesterday to the White House Office of OAMB complaining that KBR was overcharging for petroleum products
So bend over again and get ready to be ahead. Okay America just bend over spread your cheeks. Let them have a good time doing it

The power of the devil, the power of the devil.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
He's not shaking to a line of the hill, till the fake shape pillow was turned.
Till forget to take your pill, a knife she's got in touch.
Tasting pills and nutted chokes, far-a-pulled and broken.
Brushed and shrugged and beat it, took her narrow, honest, though.

No, it's 13 to 1, 1248.
240 bucks, that's not too good.
Especially considering all of them damn world series tickets.
Yeah, and the riot. 240 bucks out there at Pino Tallah carpet.
And the lovely Miguel is there waiting for you.
And he might have a surprise for you, never know.
21...
That wouldn't surprise me.
2101 West Atlantic Boulevard in Palm Pino, man.
And only for those who donate to our best meal for a band and pair rescue,
you movie past in the premiere of Radio this Saturday courtesy of the real yellow pages from Bell South.
So 240, and we can do 500 bucks out 600?
Yeah, okay, 500 sounds good.
You know, it's time to optimistic.
Why do you better get those damn tickets while they allow last?
Let's see, Gonzer is now programming a satellite classic rock format.
And it's got a website here.
When did Legion Let Die a couple of years ago?
Scott Levison stuck in the Pinellas Park.
Oh, thanks Scott, that's the guy's name.
I don't usually read people's last name, but anyway, they won't find a Mason Pinellas Park.
He's one probably pulled a switch on it, broadly living.
The evil doer, Faxson, says, for the workless file, I think I remember reading them in 1963,
Dick Beyond, the Casey Case and Bob U-Banks and Gary Owens, all worked at K-R-L-A.
Pretty good line of says, the evil master. Thank you, evil master, and...
Here's another fact that says, oh, where do I start?
What are cash to characters on Q-M?
Lots of boring assholes.
How do you like this?
Well, if you find them, boring, don't listen to them.
Wussam, whatever your name is, Cuxahoyce.
Not to pick on it, he can't because he sounds like an ice-grab, but he's so boring.
And according to him, the marlins are going to win the World Series if the sun shines at a 45 degree angle from the west.
And the temperature's less than 75 for five minutes.
His gambling talk is terminal.
Joe Castello, oh my god, it says.
I never thought I would say this, but this guy's more boring than George if you think that's possible.
Yes, we do.
And the big...
Ow!
What an asshole, it says.
He thinks he knows everything, and he is not you.
He is almost as boring as Joe Castello.
Fat, ugly, and boring.
How do they know what the big ol' looks like?
They stalk him.
Oh, well they're right.
Oh, he's a good guy though, but he's fat, ugly, and boring.
This leaves me with Howard Davidid, the true definition of pompous asshole who likes to suck...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I almost got sucked into reading that, what it says here.
It's only J-Feelers though, okay, don't feel bad.
Wussam.
Howard Jim Man did hate you like poison, and it signed the phony facts from the mad dog.
But we know that's already too annoying.
Yes, all right.
No doubt about it.
Seven, 0560, 0560.
Absolutely.
Not a AT&T for us, now we're just 10 minutes away from that magical moment when the little hand's gonna hit the big hand.
And we get that big one or two hours, it's gonna be humongous.
Well, Van Jack 61, favorite disc jockey of all time.
Rikshaw 49, Kid Curry 24.
And he said, Anna still got a huge ass.
Joey Reynolds and cousin Brucey 15.
Oh, that's a great pairing.
That's a match made in purgatory, side by each.
Larry Lujak 11, Dick Beyondy 10.
Just changing again.
More of the K's got 8, Dick Purton 8, and Johnny Darks got 6, Harlett 6, and that's it.
But I get down to 5, 6, small potatoes, right?
Small potatoes.
Somebody cue A, I'm hello.
Robby Young.
Robby Young is good.
I think that was him.
That was him come from the other side, wasn't it?
That was Robby, calling from a phone booth.
They're an E on the end of Young.
Yes, Y-O-N-G-E.
Y-O-U, just an E.
Hey, Robby.
That's another one.
I already wrote it with a U.
Deputy Q-A-M.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yes, is this George?
Yeah.
I'm just calling for some information.
Yesterday, Neil was reading an article about the sex.
And, um, and health.
Yeah.
Did you tell me where I put the name of the article?
Forbes Magazine, this month's Forbes Magazine.
Is it online?
Yeah, Forbes.com.
And the title of the article.
The title of the article is, I have no idea.
Get busy. Start doing it right now.
Your prostate will be real healthy, okay?
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
Hey, don't forget about those tickets out there at the Pino Tallah carpet.
Does it have tickets for radio?
Yes.
Tickets for radio.
I mean, you can call them passes, but that's no fun.
Oh, here's unbelievably chronic factor bill.
I mean, just out of control.
A couple of weeks ago, I came by the radio station to pick up a pair of Marlon tickets
that I wanted to jim and to show.
See what I mean?
Marlon tickets.
The game was great.
I appreciate the free tickets, but I have one question.
What the hell is that thing?
Oh, this is a good fact.
What is that thing working behind the desk on the third floor?
On the third floor.
You turned.
It had a Power 96 T-shirt on a go-t that was so long it was braided.
It asked me for my ID and I was afraid to let it know my home address.
So I'll give me your home address.
Your home address.
Does it work there all the time?
Was it a temp from an agency in the Perletons care center?
Still freaked out by the Freaks as bill.
The Perletons care about the news, yes.
And that's Greg Reed's idea of a receptionist, okay?
That's why, you know, they talk about putting your best foot forward to kill him.
Well, I'm going to put our worst foot forward and maybe up your ass.
So that's it.
It's quite the wheel of fortune when you come visit us because it could be the beautiful
Nazlin or it.
Nazlin's nice.
She's attractive.
She's friendly.
She's very nice.
She's a sweetheart.
But most of the time, the it is sitting out there.
Now that's not the first it that we encountered at QA.
And we also had another it.
It never showed up.
No, he wasn't the yet.
He was the thing.
With a smelly old suit that was from like, what was the thing about where they were sitting
in the attic?
What the hell was that?
Ethan Hawke was in a movie?
I don't know.
Flowers in the attic.
No, no.
You know what I'm talking about when I had the cowards in the ant.
The diary of Ant-Frank.
No, they had the cobwebs and the old spins there was an attic.
Great expectation.
Oh, all right.
That's what they had in the pizza joint.
Great expectation.
Little butt plug baseball cap.
Please.
And this freak oldist thing came by and applied for a job and they actually hired him.
They hired it.
And when I called him the thing on the year, he was on his way.
I guess he was actually on his way to work that morning.
Wasn't he?
He was ready to welcome him.
And he turned around and went back home for which I'm eternally grateful.
OK, we got enough freaks and fruit cakes in that building without the thing.
We got it and we had the thing.
And then we got screw in and we got Phil's.
We got a lot of interesting people in that building.
No more PD Lenny though.
Thank God.
Quick call on the show.
PD, we hate you.
560, 705, 60.
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.
QAM, hello.
Hi, Neil.
How you doing?
Yes, sir.
Hi.
I wanted to check in one of my favorite DJs with my motor.
Who was it, Charlie Murdoch?
OK, thanks, Mike.
OK.
Have a great day.
You too.
Bye-bye.
What?
I wanted to hear some jingles.
Would you stop picking on poor blind Mike?
He doesn't like to be called that.
That's why I said it.
Would you stop picking on poor blind Mike?
Wants?
Charlie Murdoch?
That's a good choice.
The first phone call I ever took in mind me.
I was doing weekends in WIOD following Russell Wases, a real asshole.
Playing music, spinning records.
Were we putting him on there?
Who?
Russell Wases.
I was putting him on there.
I don't care.
He doesn't care.
He's got millions.
What does he care?
And then the phone rang.
And now, I'm sitting there spinning a very man-a-low record, I believe.
I'm ashamed to admit.
And I pick up the phone WIOD.
You never worked with you sound just like, you know, I forget who that was.
It was like Charlie Murdoch.
And it was blind Mike.
Is that incredibly how many years ago that is?
About 30, man.
Pretty damn near.
Pretty damn close.
I would say that was like, that was before I came to KAT.
That was my first episode filling in on WIOD back in the Jim Gallant days.
And there was the other guy from Kansas City that asshole.
The general manager in Jim Gallant was the PD.
And they took me to the Playboy Club for a dinner one night to interview me.
Didn't see if they wanted to hire me.
Oh, bunny Barbara.
Bunny Barbara.
Jim Gallant acted like he never saw a broad before in his life.
Like, he never saw a boob.
He never certainly came anywhere near one of those SSY deals.
And he just, there was an asshole made a clown out of himself.
Now, if you were going to hire me, wouldn't you take me like to the Playboy Club?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Didn't they know about you?
It was nasty.
Bitches away from me.
You idiots, okay?
Jim Gallant and Joe Abernathy.
That was the Kansas City Mafia that Cox broadcasting hired to run IOD in those days.
The great entertainers.
Well, I've said it's 100 years ago.
It's still a crap market.
It's 12.56 now.
You don't understand what's going to happen when you come back from the break, don't you?
That's it.
Imagine, I don't want you to get nervous, mall, because…
Absolutely.
A lot of heavy duty crap is coming down.
Absolutely, absolutely.
Any second.
Absolutely.
I know what it does.
You're going to be the one that has to answer for Santino.
Mike.
Michael.
And Ray Probe.
He's got this thing.
This is the Sports Radio 560.
It's more of a nuisance.
The deal rises.
One to two hours.
But it's no Bud David, baby.
Well I hate what I'm doing on QAM.
I'm putting that bag in back on again.
I want what they had must for.
These are my kind of guys.
I wouldn't have had anything to do with anyway.
If the manly sounded guys really gay.
I want more at Christmas more.
Ghost poison is real high.
When I listen to the sports,
a manly voice won't get my attention.
But we'll really get to be stiff in this short.
A squeaky high voice will give me a direction.
Well I hate what we're doing on QAM.
I'm putting that bag in back on again.
I'm going to this here and straight man with voices this high.
Now I'll have to get deeper in that closet again.
So I could impress all the macho brands.
And check out Chris Morendite to help the fans decide.
Yeah, there ain't nothing like having macho sports guys.
His voice has had some practice.
They were 12 years old.
They didn't have a lot of that.
Yeah, stand up real close to the radio and press the sound.
Get their voices on up there.
Really makes my balls stay filled in.
And that crow man.
Well he's smarter than my infrared brother.
Yup.
We're number one.
102 at 560 W.
Can I just play that just for practice?
Okay.
And they come running in there with eight numbers yet.
Well why not?
I guess it hasn't happened yet.
We've got everybody pumped up about this.
And everybody is hanging on the edge of the radio,
including certain people who work in the building.
Absolutely.
Alright, like having spilkeys right over this.
See that?
My irritable balls acting up again.
I'm sooner or later on with these numbers.
Who is or was your favorite radio dish jockey?
He not talk show host of all time.
Wolfman Jack 62.
Richaw 53.
Give it a run for his money if he cleaned that cap.
I bet it could be them.
Kate Curry 24, cousin Brucey 16.
Throw your Reynolds and Larry Lujek 15.
That's this respectful.
Larry Lujek's embarrassed.
Dick Biodi 10, Ray DeKate 10.
Dick Purtonate.
Highlights got six and it's down hill from there.

I'm not going to be able to do that.

I'm not going to be able to do that.
Listen, the Porquichedwick thing is actually he was an invention of Dave Schaeffer.
Oh really?
Yeah, he was like Bob Oluv, what does the thing Howard does?
Bob Oluv.
Bob Oluv.
It's the same thing as that.
He was Porquichedwick.
He was a phony talk show caller.
So it was like Arnie Warren had that the remissor or roofist or whatever was yeah?
Yeah and why did Warren the name of Christ and Joey Reynolds find 15 people to vote for?
Yeah.
Pay them.
All right, bye.
Thanks.
567 on Dave Schaeffer should get another vote there because there ain't no such person.
Who was it that he said to cross-off there?
Cheswick.
Oh, Mr. Cheswick.
He did find his cigarettes.
We're going to see that.
He did, then he just died here a few months ago.
Yeah, I guess.
I don't know.
Absolutely.
They got to play Mr. Cheswick in the cook business.
You died.
Why?
A few months ago or something.
Absolutely.

You decide to?
The magic ballroom or something like that was his show.
What was his name?
The Meckley Ballroom.
I bet you nobody is going to call in JP McCarthy from WJR and Detroit.
So let's put him on there, okay?
Not that he was a good disc chocky because he was just a great voice.
A smoothist butter.
Hey, you want these 12 plus numbers?
Because those are the first ones.
I want whatever you got, Mr. I want those.
Now you got numbers.
Now let's hear it.
You got numbers, baby.
Except I didn't hear what you did.
I just said, I said JP McCarthy.
All right.
WJR Detroit.
Here we go.
George is sticking through there, baby.
And number two.
Stick a number in there.
Oh.
Oh.
All right.
Now these are 12 plus.
Yeah.
Now we just did the run away.
We're number one, David.
I don't know that's for effect, but I have a premonition that says.
We're number one, David.
Of course I'm not saying which day part.
I'm covering my ass.
JP McCarthy, William B. Williams, Charlie Murdoch.
It was really a treat here and from my friend Blind Mike today, you know what?
That's always special.
It's always a special moment.
I always take my, my, my.
What a great day this is.
WDQ I am.
Hey, how you doing?
Pretty good.
All right.
Come on in the air yet.
What is it?
My on the area.
Sounds just like you, but you are you on a speaker phone?
Oh, no, no.
I just have you up on the other, in the other room.
Okay.
But anyway, the Marlins are going to win against the Yankees.
Right.
And then after that, the owner is going to sell them like you did when they want to get the Yankees left.
Right?
But it was, it was a different owner.
Right, but this one.
And they didn't win against the Yankees the last time it was against the Cleveland Indians.
So first up on your baseball trivia, okay?
1997.
Was that the Yankees?
No, no, it was not.
Facing, and by the way, that picture for the Indians who lost the game, what else that guy who keeps gaining more and more weight?
Who used to play for the Indians?
See, Skye is supposed to know these things.
You're supposed to be right on top of it.
Charles Nagy?
No, not Charles Nagy.
Okay, although there used to be a guy named Steve Nagy who was a bull.
Remember, championship bowling with BuzzFazio?
No.
And Thurmond Gibson and Eddie Koalik's.
Of course you know it.
See you don't know.
And there you have Fred Wolff.
You see the way this works, George?
What?
Fred Wolff.
WXYZ.
He tried to put him on there, Fred Wolff.
It's just unbelievable to me because he used to be the host of championship bowling in Detroit on WXYZ TV Channel 7.
How about it?
Okay, here comes some numbers.
Now this is interesting.
These are like a little on the cock-eyed side, a little cock-a.
W-L-Y-F.
Oh, this doesn't vote too well when life is number one in Persons 12 plus.
Slush.
Light FM in the summertime.

400 what?
Dollars.
Oh, we got $400 and almost an hour to go out there with Miguel.
He's at Pino Town in Carpet, 2101 Western Land of Ovarian Poppano.

Bring some cash for a band and pay rescue.
W-I-O-D.
Now where the hell is Q-I-M on here?
Are we still on here?
Oh, look at that!
George?
I didn't look.
I just stuck everything right in the faculty.
Look at that.
You'll tell me.
This is 12 plus in the afternoon.
We went from 2.3 from number 20 to 3.1.
That's the Humber.
Nice going, Humber.
And he's actually working today.
Why are you saying me?
I mean, you're saying me whatever you got, right?
I just stuck the stack of the facts.
So how are they looking?
Who's bringing these into you?
Josh.
Josh and Humber.
Please?
Displeased?
Josh Cortis is bringing them in.
Oh, Josh Cortis.
Well, what the hell is he?
He's a good guy, but he knows nothing.
And he's never wanted it.
W-I-O-D.
Look at this midday.
Not too good.
12 plus.
3, 4 to 3, 5.
So about flat.
Okay.
Well, bring this day about flat and 12 plus.
We're not doing too bad.
We'll be not doing it.
What about I-O-D here?
4 and 9 to 4, 5.
So they went down a little bit.
We went up, what I say, 10 to the point and 12 plus.
Okay, that's okay.
Uh-huh.
That's a bit over.
So where did we have the big increase?
The Humber.
The Humber had the big increase in now.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha.

That was Friday.
So all of these are going to have to come in now.

You'd be amazed.
There you go.
There's the 3 to 7.
Here's the 10 to 3.
You wonder who's number one in midday and 12 plus.

Boring.
Terminal.

CMQ FM.

yeah about the things yes and right and of course you think I'm just
talking about the Neil Rogers show we're number one
you weigh a number one and meant 25 54 in the entire station six and a midnight
yes am I right yes let's have a party what do you say huh let's do it double
I think I might just go on vacation party yeah and we did it memory of our
close personal buddy Don Cox wouldn't have to be a good way to do it and you
know something really interesting I was absolutely correct because if you look
at 18 to 34 which you didn't want to send me because it's like persons instead
of just men but if you look at persons 18 to 34 and you look at the morning
which I don't say I'm just getting now ours midday 18 to 34 or you are just
all over the place with it but here it is I told you I got a buddy what will you listen to me now
well you listen please one moment please if you look at a morning well look at that
two under with two five in the midday 18 to 34 the whole station went up but
morning from a 0.8 to a 1.8 I'll get it's not a gigantic number but again as
persons which includes women which cuts it in half now you know as well as I do
where the hell it's coming from I don't want to make any suggestions yeah right
so that bears out what I've said to that Monday you're gonna have some bad news to
pass along to somebody who tried to get your ass fired absolutely you're probably
gonna be like dancing on his grave and on his weasel too absolutely you're gonna be
applauding gonna give him a sitting ovation I left the letter out of that great
great thanks congratulations by the way thanks a lot Greg and by the way we
couldn't have that without you all oh probably we could have thanks a lot Greg
you're okay and George's book and again he should be patent you want to back
because this is summer book yeah let me see let me oh wow look at that what I
should have been look at the the 10 to 3 Greg whipped it right out I can't oh man
the 10 to 3 for a little fellow like him what the 10 to 3 yes 92554
and a 6.0 all right 8.0 that's 10 to 3 right and that includes your marginal I mean
August but keep in mind some people are that we're giving George a hard time that
this is the summer book okay the freaking summer book which I'm on like Tuesdays
and Thursdays for like what July and most August and then had this first week
August off there's a lot of George jammed in that 8.0 we got our time slot back
we finally got a real lead in if you catch my drink as opposed to a dead man in
the suit now let's see what we got here what do you sell and what kind of
print is this what just happened I don't know I'm faxing what I'm guessing no but
you're sending me this stuff again you're sending me 18 to 34 again I'm not even
supposed to come and include me okay I mean I know the numbers are nice but I
sure as hell don't need them about 40 50 times okay all you might want to
set a copy to a friend or just back to the subway walls with him here will be
good we're number one damn it everybody in Ontario know that we're still
kicking ass so we get a double bonus that sounds good to me I already got it
spent in my mind for like several more vacation sounds good a double freaking
bonus let's see men 25 to 54 look at that WQAM let's say it's a 6.0 yeah from a
4.1 in the spring from number 10 in men which remember how embarrassing that
was because of Moe absolutely Moe dragged this down but this time with some
assistance in there and at morning time slot especially the 8 to 10 hours if
you catch my drift now life number two and man does anybody believe that
anybody listen to light 105 well whatever it is 101.5 5.7 there are
allegedly number two big 5.7 dropping from number one though that's overall I
see that's over one I like I just got to send see your send me so damn much
different crap here it's just usually I can you know I wasn't looking at what
they gave it a tough time having keep slipping out of my fist okay one moment
play I'm stapling so we get the double barrel bonus baby I here's mornings
here you go Howard sperm drop in you know what this is a result of don't you the
fact that Howard sperm dropped over two points let me give you a clue make from
eight to 10 you'll see you'll see on Monday when the hour by hour comes out it's
gonna be a shower of power you're gonna stick you on the tower WB a big Howard
sperm and more still number one but from a 10 8 to an 8.5 Zeta look at that
Paul and old Ron from a 5 3 to a 6.6 how did that happen Q a m oh here's here it is
here's the meat and potatoes right here there's everything you want to know
boys and girls right here everything this is the moment I've been waiting for
absolutely six to 10 a m from a 3.4 in a spring book before for real and now a
5.3 from numbers from tied for 12 to number three so let's say you take
5.3 and double it okay that's 10.6 so I would say that for else got about an
eight and mose got a 2.6 a 2 pay 2 pay 6 now now what you'll see okay when you
get those hour by hour man you'll be seeing radio retmo is fourth and then
after that it's hot and radio I'm more in all these other no speaking
lay stations okay in the morning I might have to refill my paper back there
you're just facts and just tons and tons of crap now what about that Fox Sports
would all make it a big move from a point six in a morning to a 1.3 in men
2554 they're doing it and you know what that's all resolved out can I give you
like a little clue as who's responsible for that yeah for that big improvement
in the morning that's where you see some alarm truck problems yeah I forgot
over the top they're doing they're doing a big number as the crow flies of course
now that baseball is over what the last you know men 2554 midday QAM
proudly we say from a six point we were a number look at that how is that
possible well that's right because that was a 10 to 3 thing right and we were a
9 to 1 back in those days it was awful ugly days you see the difference there
Greg if you screwed around with a show and you had us on 9 to 1 from a 6.6 and
be number two and attend the three time period to an 8.0 and
where number one
followed by life of the 6.8 am I out of paper I'm out of paper hang on a
whistle to them
okay like I said life number two and man does anybody buy it no leave it no big
number three WYOD dropping like a rock you just wait until this rusting hits
them like a bomb and a whole cheap channel chain that's
a lot of the
data three eight to a four okay that's enough rush power from a 490 a 470
about what about that party radio crap I see men in black is doing good they
went from a one eight in the spring to a 4.6 ready for that no but to me it
looks like the party is more than over Chris at 2554 that's not their
demo what about 18 to 34 you look at it you take a peek at it no no no it's
over 1334 but let me just overall okay let's see how party radio is doing
as opposed to power 96 power 96 zooming oh this is going to be a big book for
the vislies man Scott might even get paid before the years out by doubt it power
96 persons 18 to 34 the whole week they went from an 118 number one to a
12.6 number one kid curry nice going kid you're the best man in spite of
Greg kid curry and the marriage of kid curry and Bill Tanner can you see it
oh that's what's put them on the top I think kid probably the one on top
m.i.b men in black from a 7.5 to a 10.1 number two challenging power w.e.d.r. is
third went up a little bit Zeta 5 1 to a 5 6 18 to 34 that's Paul and the old
rhyme and they're doing it life hot oh p.w. I am party wave when I still hanging
in there from 10 to 6 4.3 4.5 overall and that 18 to 34 young punk demo and that
mostly the Zara's demo so we are kicked ass didn't I tell you yeah I'm
usually given it at well but it beat but it will be nowhere you could go either
way but you know we had two good months going in oh yeah we knew that you
didn't destroy this summer like you usually I mean you did a hell of a job and we
also knew that we got our time slot back and we got to lead in thanks a lot for

the mad dog see we got a good combo there we got the mad dog and the Humper together do

extrapolations are correct my stravigations like most 10 10.6 you following that all right you
got a seven point well I'm just doing this by memory but I have to wait for clearance in the
the muff mice to render you know they're busy congratulating each other I'm sure kissing each

18 plus see I can do about that well whatever the hell we had we had a gigantic big month we had
a good one so there you go thanks to everybody for making us a number one again and that

156, 560, W.C.
We got a lot of good news today.
The only bad news is,
mad dog is laying out.
As a result, you got the big.
And two proving that nothing is perfect.
Then you got the Humphorate Four was going to be basking in that 7.0 share.
But he and the mad dog put together.
That's going fast, so.
And then you got Hurricane Hotline 7 o'clock life in Tony,
Tony Romas, Ricky William Show at 9,
80K at 10, and Joe and Mark overnight.
Now, how do you think Joe and Mark did?
A little bit better, maybe?
I, I, I looked.
It's got to be a little bit better.
We don't have that till Monday,
but it's got to be a little bit better, don't it?
No.
Just a little teeny tiny bit, like maybe a tenth of a point,
something like that.
Like a few more listeners.
About 30 minutes.
It should be like half of their audience at that hour.
And I, when everybody is sloughing,
of course, when they're back on to 2 to 6,
I mean, are you going to say that?
Uh-oh.
What?
No.
I just have, I have this feeling of moe's numbers as bad as I think it might be.
I mean, how could he possibly even come in there with a straight push, right?
He will.
If he's putting clues and trees and for else got like sevens and eights,
what kind of a look is he going to have on his push?
He'll have a gate.
Look.
Is that the way it'll be?
Absolutely.
So what's new about that?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
WDQIN.

Yeah.
Congratulations brother.
Thanks.
We deserve it.
Number two, that poor guy Steve Bartman,
I have to hate to be an issue today.
And uh, man, that's pretty much all about it.
Man, I'm sorry moe.
Moe's got to go.
Won't see him no more.
Either one of them is matter of fact.
Steve Bartkin and Moe, they can both leave now together.
Like Tom Likus in the trunk of the car late at night, about three in the morning.
WDQIN.
Baseball blows.
Oh.
Now you know something, I am so ecstatic.
I'm so delirious and so happy about that.
That just before the end of the show today, on a day when South Florida,
according to all reports, it's supposed to be euphoric.
Everybody wants free tickets.
Everybody wants paid tickets.
Anything.
They all want on a bad wagon.
And just before we get out of here, baseball blows.
Another good positive call from the assholes in South Florida.
Man, it's unbelievable.
This guy could go out in a backyard, find $10 million in small bills unmarked.
Oh, this really blows.
What am I going to do with all this money?
Where am I going to hide it?
Give my mother's phone number.
They make a beautiful couple.
I'm not serious.
I'm going to give it all to you.
She could take a wet dream and turn it into a nightmare.
Unbelievable.
Nice going, my.
And this guy too.
Probably heard you in a voice.
WDQIN.
Hey, what's going on, buddy?
Yes, sir.
It's Rick from Miami.
Who?
It's Rick from Miami.
Yeah.
Hey, what's going on, Neil?

Oi.
Exactly.
Morton this bomb and Joe Dean.
Who's the other one who used to be on there with the home of the BZBs WBBF in Rochester.
With a signal at night time, the signal used to go straight up into the air.
Something like that.
I think we got enough names on there to make it worth a while.
Just pick one.
Okay, if yours is none, they're just pick one of these.
Okay?
If you don't know any of them, talk to somebody like over the age of five.
We can tell you a little bit about radio.
Of course, we know that radio blows, baseball blows, many of the calls blow.
There's no question about that.
I blow you blow, Scott Blow.
Right.
Well, I think I got to both be on that.
