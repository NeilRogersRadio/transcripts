Friday night is in the White House doing all his presidential bill.
He's there in the Oval Office though he's not sure what an oval is.
His practice in his speech that he's been working on for weeks should be a breeze.
But it's not for a man who thinks that if you're from Iran, your ear will ease.
Saturday he's still no smarter.
Things went in the center, central gold.
You could say his brain is useless, kind of like the Chinese clocked up, ventricles.
Now he goes to give the speech with words his bow cap cannot reach. He looks so brave.
But he won't tell you how he feels instead he'll talk about some bad mistakes he'll make.
He can't spell, he cannot run out loud.
He can't speak so what he says is always in doubt.
You'll never clue, you'll bring it instead.
So he just babbles on.
Babbles on.
He's got to give that ain't too bad.
Same occupation as dad once had closes his eyes when he counts to ten.
Helps him to remember all of them.
Like the bush we had before he's got the same name on the Oval Office store.
He's in there thinking unlike Clinton.
How to make this country wonderful again.
Open George W. You ain't like his dad when he courtesit more to bomb back dad.
If Saddam wants another fight it might scare George and make him want to cry.
Close his eyes when it goes to betting dreams of the recount making smile.
If you're better when you hear him say.
The USA will be wonderful someday.
He might promise us everything that don't need spittle and he's got to change me.
To blame if something goes wrong.
Once the press gets to him he'll realize the impressive ain't so wonderful.
Mal.
Mal.
Good morning, happy new year to you.
It's 9.04.56.00 WQAM.
For those of you who haven't figured this out it's not George and it's not Neil.
This is Carlos. I will be taking requests and playing some best of Neil tapes today.
So give me a call off the air and I'll be happy to play anything you got.
I'm honored to welcome so many people who devote their lives to the well-being of others,
to the Rose Garden here in the White House.
There are around 5 million hardcore users of the illegal drugs in America today.
We must do and we will do drugs.
We must increase the floor drugs into America.
This will make working in close cooperation with Mexico a priority.
And we emphatically disagree.
There are American hearts being laid down in the bottom of our chests.
About that special feeling we get in the cockles of our hearts.
Maybe below the cockles, maybe in the subcock area, maybe in the liver.
Maybe in the kidneys. Maybe even in the colon. We don't know.
I'm just a regular Joe with a regular job.
I'm your average white suburbanites.
I like football and porn, I'm books about war.
I got an average house where the nice hardwood floor, my wife and my job,
my kids and my car. I'll feed on my table and a cube of six ago.
But sometimes I just paint it up to keep a man like me.
No way. No, I've got to go out and have fun.
It's someone else's expense.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I try really slow in the ultra fast lane while people behind me are going insane.
I use public toilets and I piss on the seat.
I walk around in the summer time saying, how about this heat?
I'm on a story.
Sometimes I park in the handicap spaces while handicaps people make handicaps and faces.
I'm on a story.
I'm on a story.
Maybe I shouldn't be singing this song.
Ranting and raping and carrying on.
Maybe they're right where they tell me I'm wrong.
I'm on an extra wheelie.
Come on up to the road.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to get myself a 1967 Cadillac Yolderado convertible.
I paint with a whale skin off the caps and all other cow and carrier and big brown baby
and I see a lion's red head lights.
I'm going to cry around on that baby at 150 miles per hour, getting one mile per gallon.
I'm on a port of mountains, burgers and McDonald's, the old fashioned not by the great old style of home containers.
I'm going to run second down those grease ball burgers, I'm going to wipe my mom with the American flag
and then I'm going to toss the style of home containers right off the side.
And then I'm going to cut them thing anybody can do about it.
You know why?
Because we got the bomb. That's why.
Two words, nuclear f**king weapons.
So they rush a Germany, Romania, they can have all the democracy they want.
They can have a fifth democracy, cake walk right through the middle of the enemy square.
I don't make a lick of difference because we ain't got the bomb.
So they've done ways.
Now then, he's frozen and as soon as we find a cure for cancer we're going to throw out the Duke.
And he's going to be pretty pissed off.
You know why?
If the government's taking a cold shower, we multiply that by 15 million times.
That's how pissed off the Duke's going to be.
I'm going to go to the Duke and John gets a lady and we marmin' a Sampeck and a B.
And a case of a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a man and a

look at this why don't you push yourself away from the table huh
maybe have a salad once in a while daddy
don't you know how many of the world's people have never had a decent meal again with a charity
speelot well it's true so why don't you send them the bones from the turkey you had for breakfast
I
I
thought she was pushing up days
oh
the last episode was all a bad tree
it seems so bad to me
but when we get back there be it
push the dead off and give me that a beer
that's 20th anniversary of all of the family Saturday night on CBS
brought to you by ibs home correspondent school where you can learn auto mechanics
get repair
the stuff will be
the other night was there a fight on the heart of july
because now his cousin's dead
I'll ball it in the head
what happened we don't know
something fishy smells but he won't tell
so we'll ask Brian
what did you do
Brian
what did you do
seems not so long
he was standing on his folks lawn and he was crying
crying
crying
crying
it's hard to understand
it wasn't as
so then
with two shots lying
I don't know why your age and crew claims the cops report so true
I want to know some more so tell me what's the score
Brian what did you do
accidentally
or just maybe
you're lying
what did you do
oh
what did you do
yes
now he's gone
and from this moment on
we're asking why
why
why
why
why
why
why
why
why
why
yes sir yes
I wanted to talk to you about
two biggest
about one
and boats that you talked about earlier
about one
biggest
cars and boats
now we're talking about bridges over the
causeway not the ones in your mouth
I don't have any of my friends
okay
yeah
calm down
before I put it deep breath
but it's regulated by the United States Corps of Engineers
you do that
did you
no
well it is all bridges over
navid blue waterway
if I knew that I wouldn't have been asking
see
but that
I said if I knew the answer to the question
I wouldn't have asked it in the first place
okay well all I'm saying sir
is that the United States Corps of Engineers
are the ones that regulate
bridges over
navid blue waterways
over one
navid blue waterway
yes sir okay
okay
yeah
so it's up to them to decide
what time
the bridges should not be open
to the marine traffic
yes
and what time should they not be open to marine traffic sir
I'm telling you that they
come up with the times
well what is the time
I believe it's at wish our times sir
that they are not open to marine traffic
other than that they are open to marine traffic
so in other words any schlep with a boat can come along and back up traffic
for too long
that is absolutely correct sir
well what kind of a comment is much a crap is that
that is not a communist bunch of crap sir
sounds like some kind of the end of all
fascist honey pinko
you got five people in the blue
beos to one boat
wait exactly
the boat is going to stop the 5,000 cars
is that it?
no I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jack as in his boat
I think that's what they ought to do
man you better know your laws mr because you sure don't
that's right
I suppose you want the van brigad closed
to both traffic and the hurricane too
I want the bridges closed period okay
I want them closed I want the bridge
tent to go home and watch
his MTV and get the hell out of our life
you know the way I want those bridges closed
let him use the junior tunnel okay
you know I don't know the concept
cause I think the all of the
go on a George Washington bridge and jump
all of bridge tenders how do you like that sir

more there wouldn't be so uptight
flogging the dog never hurt anybody and if people did a little more of it we
might say some lies hell if clinton just stayed home and spanked a monkey
he'd even be in less hot water teaching kids about masturbation would be
no big deal we could even take some standard teaching tools and just twist them
around a little bit like see dick run when you see dick run
get to the doctor because you picked up a bad case of crouch crickets
folks we got to get real about the realities of the world we live in
there are too many kids out there taking a baloney ride and parking there yacht
in hair harbor now if we just teach them to stay home and paddle the pickle
pump the python walk the door wax the carrot or tickle the taco

couple days trying to reach me you've called people i have been invented yet you
called that relative of mine what's the story of the
we're working on a story about uh... the city here promoting on your website
yeah called kissa i won't say it and word good morning
either are you listening to the show
i guess i am i've been listening to a couple days and just you know we are
did you did you hear me go through the entire uh... rationale what that that
song had nothing to do with kindleysa rice
what about the song kindleysa kindleysa that has that that's obviously about
kindleysa and i want to know why you're why you're playing this on your show
i see i'd like to know why you know that this is really interesting
why are you calling me asking me why should play this we make we have song
parodies about bill clinton dozens of them nobody ever complained about that
we have some parodies about al Gore dozens of them nobody ever complained about
those
about that i think i think american folks up in here in the york were pre-offended
by it and you want to let me say this to you care we're not in new york
uh... okay we don't broadcast in the york were on wqm in my army and and
effect of the matter is that i'm not except for people like you and the people
at the that right wing newsmax dot com will make a big simmiss about this
if we're for that they wouldn't be aware that we exist
the over the month this organization that up
offended by it as a national organization but but the fact of the fact of the
matter is we've been playing these songs for many many many months we've never
had one single complaint and when interlopers like you from outside like from
fox news are from some right wing website want to tell us what i mean for you
to ask me how come you're playing that because we want to play it
okay me i want what's coming what is it what is it what is it what is it do for
you what is it called it's called comedy that's what it's called you have a sense
of humor do you think it's funny how uh... they call connolly the right in and it's
in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it in it well here you
bella funny called her the house Negro case of a color whatever we want
but this is a little bit different i mean it's not good it's not the least bit
different she is the house they receive people at fox made out understand this
not everybody in the world is the right wing or like we put more dot they're
actually are those of us who are progressive or moderate liberal whatever we are
who also have the right to speak to express whatever help we want
so it's a what repeat again what you just had for me there you think she is a
what
she's the house negro
and you don't find anything wrong with that
well what you mean wrong with that it's a fact that's my opinion in my title
my opinion you're certainly a
and i don't hear
that's basically that's basically what harry bella fauna said as well and
obviously this is why nobody returned your calls
uh...
whether whatever your name is
uh... because we knew that you were trying to stir up a bunch of crap and
take something out of context
when i asked you to do that
did you listen did you listen to your not to be a plan
we're not doing the ballerade show pay its my show and i'm not going to have
you scream over me you try to talk to me okay it's not going to work
okay uh... you know i asked you in the beginning of the conversation which i
was very common i think you did you hear me explain the origin of that song
the rest of the two-ton song
the fact of the matter is that i don't know i'm sure he must have been on your
channel randal kennedy the black author wrote the book nigger this range
career of a troublesome word
not that i'm aware of while he was certainly on cnn he was on msnbc
maybe it was on fox because he wasn't that i don't know maybe just didn't
weren't aware of it
we can be a question
are you are you aware of that book
you portray yourself to be the sort of liberal voice
but you're
man i'm i don't portrayal for labels on the amount of the example of the
what would you call yourself a human being you see you people on fox
it's this all liberal and a conservative that stuff went out with high-button
shoes of the
thinking living and
in addition to why do i have to and my any florida answer to some assholes in
new york on fox news how i do my show what is it your business
there are a lot of people who can there are people in my amy they care about it
too who are they your calling are they name me one person my amy who's
considered about it
both we know down there certainly and i've got name me one
two look name me one it's offensive
name me one name me one of a very high i don't care what you say we don't
we don't like college okay have a nice day okay

What's up, dad?
Hello.
Hello, I was calling about the watt, but you have to settle in a paper.
What kind of wavits are they?
I have some lops.
I have some lops. Some spotty lops and some solid colored lops.
Oh, wonderful.
And I have a straight ear dough and I have two dwarfs.
What a dwarf.
They're small radies.
Oh, okay. We have a farm and we like to play with the wavits on a farm.
You wouldn't happen to have any like little wavit handcuffs.
Do you want?
Little handcuffs for a wavit.
A handcuffs?
Yes.
I'm sorry, I never heard of them.
What's going on?
Well, we used them when we hunt them on the farm.
We like to hunt the wavits.
And we take them and nail them to a tweed by their ears and in skin and moway.
Hello.
And now I think that's what you don't do at taste, rabbit.
Sir, I couldn't say you're a rabbit.
We have a little game we play called all wavits must die.
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir.
I wouldn't say you're a rabbit at first.
50 dollars.
I like to hunt the wavits.
Well, that's okay. You go out in the wild and you hunt rabbits.
But they aren't for kill.
I like to put them in a little pin and then hunt them down unmaskably.
No, sir, I'm sorry.
And say you're a rabbit.
Sometimes we even spare them to the head with a wasty water.
Ooh, I need your love, John.
Yes, you know it's true.
I hope you'll need my love, John.
Just if this was for you, oh, oh, oh, me.
Touch me, use me, bust me.
I need my share of love, John.
Eight times a day.
I love you every day, John.

Get a tight shot of my behind.
Oh, oh, oh, me.

It makes me wet when I see you get a big erection.
That's too big for my mouth.
I want it mercenary and a cup of juice.
And take it up my lubricated food shoes.
Give me an erection and they'll be to the wall.
E-R-E-C-T-I-O-N.
I wanna drink your balls.

That's the way right, John.
And it's unferconcised.
E-R-E-C-T-I-O-N.
I wanna drink your balls.
E-R-E-C-T-I-O-N.
I wanna drink your balls.
Goodbye, Chris Barley.
You great big fatty.
Always acting like a great big fat dumb retard.
In every field you've ever made.
Too bad for David's fate.
His career could fade cause.
All he has left is that label.
TV show he won't be making bloody movies no more.
As he wants it to be just like John Balushi.
And have drawn candy's chips.
You finally made it.
But we're not too careful what you wish.
You gave us lots of laughter on Saturday night.
But you were way too young to die.
To commit bad men to a side.
Goodbye, Chris Barley.
What did you eat to blow up like a big balloon.
Eating like a fool.
That would only bring you certain death.
The farmers are upset.
And all you left was some cable movies and a few pairs of your pants.
That will fill to make community poos.
And you wanted to be just like John Balushi.
And have drawn candy's chips.
You finally made it.
But we're not too careful what you wish.
Your cast has been hold of piano.
That's six feet wide.
Now you reach the pizza in the sky.
You got so fat you died.
Chris Barley the night they had some broadon.
They're one of the tabloids shows last night.
The night before he croaked.
How much heroin and coke and fish food and whatever else he was doing.
All together.
And vodka on top of it.
You got to wash it down with some good vodka.
That's what Boris said.
It wasn't bad enough that he was doing a hero.
So he's dead Chris Barley.
This guy comparing.
Who cares about that.
Why don't we get all upset if they're beaten up their wife and their girlfriend.
Why don't we get upset about that.
How come nobody gave a crap at the Jimmy Johnson side of Lawrence Phillips who's up about a goddamn gangster.
How come that nobody cared about that.
But we're concerned if he passes a drug test or not.
That really concerns me whether he's smoking marijuana.
Not whether he's going to be beaten women up all over the place.
What kind of mentality we be talking about in this country man.
We're talking about people.
They can't sit down and look at this thing rationally because most of them are emotional cripples.
And this crap about the NBA is going to do pot testing.
David Robinson says, oh yeah, we should all subject to it.
It's a no brainer.
The NBA has a no brainer.
Okay. It's for a bunch of illiterate freaks is what it is.
David Robinson.
You asshole.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
A meal.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
You sound pit dog.
Go ahead, sir.
I'm listening.
Okay. Well, anyway, on the second hand smoke with the marijuana.
I have a friend who basically did not smoke because of the government watching over him.
Yeah.
And he enjoys burning every couple of times.
So when he went to get a mandatory, you know, pissed us and he came back positive.
He told his, his probation officer, he's like, oh no, I was in a room with a bunch of people smoking.
Yeah.
And the probation officer gave him a bunch of like evidence.
I got a great bit for Bulk of Brian by the way of the two in a second hand row.
A second hand smoke, but anyway.
Go ahead.
Anyway, he says that the probation officer gave him a bunch of evidence about how much second hand smoke you had to be in exposed to for you to come back positive for even a miniscule amount.
You had to be in a room that was spogged up for a couple of hours, you know, constantly breathing it.
Yeah.
And I mean, if you smoke pot in the bath at any point, if you like to smoke that stuff and you're in a room and they've been smoking it for two hours,
you're going to tell me you're not going to take a hit or whatever.
And I mean, snowboarders.
So, so, so, so let me ask you so what I good did.
Well, no, wait, oh, I want to hear this about snowboarding. Let's hear this.
No, I mean, snowboarding into Olympics, who is not going to think that these snowboarders are not pot addicts?
Give me a big, all these guys are a bunch of pot addicts.
Pot addicts, oh yeah.
I mean, they are the biggest burnouts.
All the surfers I knew in high school.
Yes, surfers and snowboarders, there you go.
I love your logic, man. This is great.
I mean, just follow the bouncing dots.
Here we go from A to Z to T to, uh, to FU.
Okay, great, great job, pal. Excellent.
That could have been the greatest call in history.
Oh, man, those, those chronic pot heads, man, those snowboarders.
I wonder about Sandra Schmurler, the curler. I wonder what she's doing.
She's probably got her hair up in curlers that bitch.
Oh, and Sweden, by the way, when a woman's curling mites against Canada.
Oh, my God.
The Canadians, like 95% of all curlers in the world are Canadians,
and they already lost one match between that and maybe losing this gold medal.
They may never come out of hiding.
They may like start doing like the Eskimos and build igloos and go inside and never come out.
Come out, oot.
Here's a mobile lady in Hollywood. Hello.
Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am.
Good morning. I, this is the first time I'm calling you.
However, I listen to you for years and I do admire many of the things that you say.
But, however, I take issue a little bit this morning with the pot testing with regard to your employment.
There are some situations where it is very dangerous to smoke pot, particularly if you like to drink beer, lunch, or even have a drink at lunch,
and you mix it with the pot. There are things you can do that you normally wouldn't do.
Like what?
Well, for example, I know of a personal experience because it happened to be an insurance agent,
and we have a very serious situation that occurred in one of our insured business operation where the man did that just that at lunch time.
He came back and then the job that he had been working on for 10 years stuck his hand in the mixing bat and cut it off.
All right. Excellent. Well, I'll let him teach him. I guess he won't be doing that again.
No, I guess he won't.
So what's the problem?
Well, the problem is that drug testing on the job is in many cases very important.
And so if you smoke pot, you shouldn't be doing it while you're working.
I mean, maybe if you're working in a job in a job in a job.
Well, wait a minute. You said you shouldn't be doing it while you're working,
but if it stays in your system for up to a month, then how do you know when you're doing it?
Well, I suppose you smoke it recreationally on a weekend at home, not when you're on a job.
Well, I don't know very much about how long it stays in your system.
I just got through telling you up to a month.
What about beer testing after lunch?
Yeah, that's right. How about booze testing after lunch?
Well, let me tell you something.
How about those kind of...
How about those breathalyzer tests after lunch?
Well, I don't...
I mean, where do we stop this insanity is what I say?
Well, actually, I really do believe that we have become insane with testing,
except that in the case of drugs, it is a very important thing in some situation.
I'm not saying that we should be testing everybody for everything,
because we're losing totally our rights in this country.
We don't have any rights in this country. We have a right to be oppressed by a fascist police state is what we have.
We don't have any rights. This isn't a free country. It's a joke.
Hey, listen, we still have the right to talk to you about these things which makes it a right.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, we're limited as to what we can say.
Debbie, you still got to watch your language or the word police are going to come down and take you away.
Well, that's something else again. I don't agree with that either.
I think if you want to say all things, you can say them,
and that shouldn't be oppressed by anybody, and whether it's on the radio or TV or wherever.
But the point is that I don't know if you agree to this completely,
maybe impartially you agree that there are certain situations where drug testing,
whether it be marijuana or heroin or whatever, is an important factor.
I would say if you're working in a candy store, then they definitely should be able to drug testing.
You don't want somebody or any kind of a restaurant. They don't want you to have the profits.
Right, don't have a shop. That would be a good one.
Have a great day, sweetheart. We have an open line in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60.
Because God forbid, if you smoked weed like two weekends ago and you had a beer for lunch today,
we know that you are a danger to society. God forbid.
Pizza chef or delivery boys definitely.
Yeah, that's right. Chinese food delivery guy, Don Delawese, he would never.
And he didn't even have to smoke weed. How do you like that?
And he still had the munchies. He was a hungry boy.
He was just a big chubby, hungry guy. That's all.
And he ate all $40 worth of Chinese food on the way back to the house.
Can you imagine if they tested radio management for alcohol after lunch?
Oh, yeah. If they went up there right now.
Oh, my God. How about brain testing for management? That sounds good to me.
Of course, where there's no sense, there's no feeling. Here's North Miami. Hello.
Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, you doing Neil? Great.
I have a question. Yes.
I have two questions and then I want to say something about the fire.
How come you can't get ice cream like Italy here?
Because I have a lot of pistachio. I don't eat a lot of ice cream, but man, I used to eat it.
I eat it every day in Italy. The stash of ice cream in Italy.
Gelato sir, gelato is not ice cream. It's gelato. It's made with, doesn't have all that cream.
And it's not all that chalk and artificial crap.
It's made from all natural stuff. And they don't make it here.
You know, once in a while a place will come along and try to make good gelato.
And even if it is good, the public's taste here is so bad because they're busy eating
buyers and seal-fests and eat these that those places go out of business.
Man, I used to eat. I mean, I don't, I'm not an ice creamer, but I was eating it every day, twice a day.
Yeah. I mean, every little shop had it.
Well, when I go to Italy, I eat it a lot and I scream too.
Hey, and I have a question for George.
You guys used to have this commercial called Field Extreme Watches. Was it his voice, honey?
Yes. Oh, I thought.
Yeah, he apologizes profusely for it, too.
And about that, let me ask you a question.
If this guy would have been from Amsterdam or it's legal to smoke pot, what were they going to say to the guy?
Well, you know, it's interesting because that, now that is a good point.
Merriwana, they were just saying on CNN that Merriwana is not among the substances listed at the Olympics as being illegal,
but that it reverts back to the country and the laws there.
So if it were one of the Dutch players in like a soccer player, of course they're not playing on soccer in the winter or a little bit,
but whatever the Dutch competitors are, ice skater, then it would not be a problem.
How do you like that? Canada says that's blatantly unfair in a bunch of crap and they're requiring foul.
Hey.
Oh, boy. That's not. I don't think that's very fair.
How do you like that?
How do you like that green apple, sir?
Those green apple, I don't know.
So I say that this guy, this Graziano or Greg Gabriotti, I say he should move to Amsterdam would be a good idea.
Hey, there you go.
Least he'd have a good time.
And as far as drug testing in the workplace?
Yes.
So they can figure out, it's a they can drug test you at the moment and know how much you've had at that particular moment.
I think they should just band it all together because there's no way that you're going to tell me what I have to do in my house.
In my car, or what I do at any time, then I'm not at work because I only work for them for eight hours.
Not the rest of my day.
So that's the bottom line with that.
Next thing they're going to be doing fish food testing.
Hey, there you go. Yeah, why don't we just survey and see your fat.
I want you to visit see how much food you've been eating.
Right. Exactly.
Yeah, I mean, what do you draw the line? You know what I mean?
Let me get a cute to have been checked this woman mouth.
Maybe she's been giving moral sex to somebody in the parking lot.
All right. Now you're talking. Okay. Have a great day pal.
How you do?
Okay. Sounds like a job he wants.
I did that one time.
It was about 15 years old.
And there I go.
Welcome to the clear channel collective.
You have been assimilated.
Resistance is futile and will result in your termination.
We know what's best for radio and you will be required to assist in the assimilation of all relative radio stations.
Irrelevant radio stations will become all news and left to die.
Since talent is expensive, they will be transported to what we believe are relevant radio stations with smaller wattages and scattered in a network of confusion.
And by the time they are rendered helpless, the collective will have already disposed the man for profit.
Now grab that frying pan and repeat after us.
We know what we're doing.
We know what we're doing.
We know what we're doing.
Fuck you.
Hi there boys and girls.
Today we've been a very extra special friend, Stout and I, to show us all about something really special.
I'm in the door right now.
Come on in the sky, man.
Arja, laddie.
Hey, brought by something I wanted to show you.
I wonder what it is.
It looks like a...
The pussy.
It's my bag boy.
What the bag?
Hey.
What?
Can I touch it?
Sure, go ahead.
Run your hands, everybody.
That's... that's...
Hey, like...
What's this right here?
That is my ball pipe.
What do you do with the blow pipe?
You blow on it, laddie.
You blow...
Hey, you put your mouth around it and your blow.
Oh, can I do that?
Hey, would you like to blow my pipe, laddie?
Oh, can I?
Sure, go ahead.
Okay.
Come on laddie.
You got to put your mouth around it, laddie.
Don't be afraid.
It's not going to break.
Like this?
Hey, that's a boy.
Stick it on the way down yet through.
It's bigger.
Hey, it means you're doing it right.
What's this over here?
That's my chanter.
What do I do with that?
What you do with that, laddie, is you put your both hands on it,
you cover the hole and you run your hands up and down the shaft real quick.
Hey, you run your hands up and down it there.
Now what you want to do, laddie, is you want to blow on the pipe,
you want to squeeze the bag nice and gentle,
and then you want to run your hands up into the shaft real quick.
All together, all at the same time.
Okay, here we go.
Good laddie.
Hey, let's squeeze that.
Sure.
There's good laddie.
Keep blowing.
No harder laddie.
Harder.
Squeeze the bag.
Squeeze more.
Run your hands up and down the shaft.
You picked faster.
Run your hands up and down the shaft.
Keep blowing.
Keep blowing.
Oh, no.
You're doing it, laddie.
I'm a pilot.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
What's that?
You can do that again.
I have to look at you, but I've been listening WQM for,
I've got five to six years, and I've watched the morning show,
evolving everything, and I have a problem.
I'm taking my kids to school and these thinking commercials for,
for the guy that curses nasty, nasty things,
and there's no warning.
It just blurt out, you know,
f*** you, and you can hear the bleep,
you can hear the f***, you know,
and you can hear the venom in his voice,
and you know, I don't have a chance to turn off my radio quick enough.
Now, I heard it, you know, I had a problem again the other day.
I can't explain that stuff to my kids.
I've been listening to this station for a long time,
and I think you're ruining it by infiltrating it with his nasty language.
And I don't know what I can do,
but I just thought I'd better call, you know, and tell you,
it's different with Hank.
If Hank calls someone in son of a bitch,
he just heard the guy act like a son of a bitch,
and there's a reason for it.
But the other guy with his fart and his asshole
and just the way he curses,
he's ruining your first team.
And I think Joe Roach had stand up and get this off,
kick off his program,
because there's a lot of people like me that have children,
and I just don't like to hear someone say,
pissed off on my way to work.
Pissed off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that,
and I don't think it's appropriate.
You know, if you're going to have to enance a little program
in the middle of your day, leave it there.
To make the other programs,
it's demeaned us,
and it really insults my intelligence,
and you know, that's not clear.
I don't know what it is.
I'll talk to you later.
This is Debbie.
Oh, hi, Debbie.
I'm interested in getting some operations done.
Okay.
And some body contouring and some liposuction.
Mm-hmm.
And I was wondering if you get some tummy talk,
and the lip augmentation cosmetic breast surgery
faced all of these things.
Mm-hmm.
And those wondering...
What are you like to start with?
Well, I need to get everything done.
Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed
is my thing.
Okay, we don't do that.
No. Could you do breast implants, though?
Uh, it can't be done,
but I don't know what they would do right away.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Mm-hmm.
How much?
Uh, 5,000.
Excellent.
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced, too.
Uh-huh.
And there's the surgery.
Uh-huh.
Have the lamb stop crying yet, mommy?
Excuse me?
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.
Okay.
Can you make me look more like a woman?
Well, we'll have to see you first
in the upon looking at you.
We can tell you that when we see you.
Should I wear my skin suit,
made of body parts, mommy?
Uh, if you'd like to.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Would you like to make an appointment?
Yes.
Okay.
Um, there is a $100 consultation fee.
That's fine.
Okay.
Um, my name is Buffalo Bill.
Okay.
Let me get a little information from you.
Okay.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Do you want to come in for a consultation?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
Would you like to make an appointment?
Or do you want to call me back?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I got my skin suit and it's like,
I feel like, uh,
Bill.
It puts the lotion in the basket.
I understand that.
Would you like to?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Would you like to make an appointment?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Okay.
I will talk to you in the time.
Okay?
It puts the lotion in the basket.
Hello?
They say I love his tapoo.
That what we're doing is wrong.
But I don't care what they say.
Because my love is so strong.
They tell us we should be ashamed.
We're not husband and wife.
But I cherish each moment with you.
I'm so glad you're in my life.
You're my prison bitch.
My prison bitch.
You're not a light of the men.
I'm glad we share a prison cell.
We're lights go out at 10.
I can't accept who I feel.
Now that wouldn't be a crime.
As long as I'm in my life,
I'm doing you.
I don't mind doing time.
Cause you're my prison bitch.
My prison bitch.
And I have no regrets.
I got you for a candy bar and a pack of cigarettes.
At first you were resistant.
But now you are my friend.
I knew that I would give you in the end.
Oh, prison bitch.
I guess that you were sick from a football.
Prison bitch.
Prison bitch.
And now you are my prisoner.
I'm your prison bitch.
Your prison bitch.
And you're a sex machine.
I only have one request.
How about some Vaseline?
Sure.
I'm tired of this prison cell.
I need to get away.
My sentence made you seven years.
Now seven times a day.
I'm your prison bitch.
Your prison bitch.
You're not a human.
I really hate these markers.
That you don't know.
I'm a cop.
I thought that I could break away.
But now I'm losing hope.
But I'm part of a pin of love so.
And now the prison bitch.
Prison bitch.
Burn out the lights cause I can hardly wait.
Prison bitch.
You're made in one way.
Prison bitch.
And when I get out, I'm ready.
You go straight.
You're my prison bitch.
My prison bitch.
I'll never say goodbye.
You're not like all the others.
Too bad they had to die.
On the second thought I've lived outstack.
If you want me to.
Your prison bitch.
Is never leaving you.
That person would not sell me.
But now you're my soulmate.
That's so perfect.
I know, not again.
Now I know what they call you.
Heart criminal.
You're about to find out what you call this.
The polka.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
And the leader.
And the leader.
And the leader.
She's from the movie.
With your fucking yellow teeth so far apart.
Candle-eat-the-candle-eat-the-what you be doing.
Just the old-fashioned black-ed-token schwarzer-thong.
Is you think, cause you are at home, bootly-flipply-thong?
Is you deflacte and jam-nam-e-kobi-smart?
Does they lack?
Are you shunned, they're used to the leader?
Oh, the way you watch and talk, the white is cause.
Georgia, Jr., say he trust you, unbelievable.
Who tell our allies on the greedy oil wall?
But then he make you clean all the white house bathrooms.
The cup of sea, the toilet, and then scrub the floor.
They tell you no where's the door, not the leader.
Your phone keeps on helping make them all a wretch and you.
Your nape-legger, look you slide, it's bevel-throw.
The GOP want you to be that talk is true.
One day while you be flippin' back, you may realize
That's the dream you just like your esterone.
That's when your head will move from side to side, drunkenly low.
Until push and rummage, they be crackin' at home.
Oh, don't make me angry, oh, go away, look what I got mine.
My baby's a turtle, look at the noise.
Hit my baby far, will you buy more of my records?
What is there at all?
Do some more of my records?
Oh, my face is still rolling.
Cause you take it, sell it, talk down.
I'll drop this baby on the ground.
Do sell records.
Oh no, I'm losing my grip.
The baby dangles the ground.
As I hold it at the window, I can feel your crowd.
Dangling the baby at the window.
I'm a pair of bar, as you know.
And I might just let it go, cause it's way too young to school.
My my records.
Look, it's dangling.
My my records.
Oh my face.
Around your office, baby.
But I'm your hand.
I took your calls from the ebonyx.
They say the putabee's rat furl me.
Now I can't get no job.
Cause I don't got no literacy.
I's talking like an old Negro.
Ebonyx thought they how this way.
Now I can't do nothing.
But my hair is it say that's okay.
Change my name to shoot, roll.
Drive a doos and a quarter and a Cadillac.
I remember when I was feeling all the white man's cars.
Hanging outside, developing their bar.
Grind the blues, my poverty.
White devil's got no job for me.
And I had a odibonyx to give my life a chance.
Now I had a got you to go and sell moe, raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
Lord, he would've barring his song.
Ebonyx makes me sound funny.
Got nothing to do with literacy.
Now I got to make more money.
They were poons, sounds good to me.
I got plenty of nothing.
Ebonyx ain't getting me anywhere.
Maybe I'll mug an old white bitch.
Steal a purse and pull her hair.
Then I gonna take her money.
My cereal and the fridge are dead.
I remember when I was feeling all the white man's cars.
Hanging outside, developing their bar.
Grind the blues, my poverty.
White devil's got no job for me.
And I had a odibonyx would give my life a chance.
Now, uh-huh.
Got to go and build more raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
Raccoca.
Raccoca, raccoca.
That will be the brightest, brightest, brightest.

My wife took their card or the mall!
She drives my viewer again, she's three feet tall!
I wouldn't ride with her no way!
I said I'd need it and I laid it again!
So I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain
Waiting for the early first to take me away
I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain with my friend's time!
Looks like it's time to check my change!
Christ of my stands don't always stay the same!
All that God will do what Yeta tells me to do!
The private high-rides, she must be in a stand!
Just sitting here and resting my bones!
Wondering why my wife won't leave me alone!
We've talked it over and I never went!
I just wind up schlepping through the mall again!
Oi, so I sit on a bench in the rain
Waiting for the early first to take me away
Oi, I'm just sitting on a bench in the rain with my friend's time!
There he is!
To have damn time I've been waiting here all day in this rain!
I will only go and stop trying to smoke!
Welcome back to the glittering pageantry of the Mojáudé de David'a Show!
We have a full ducket today!
Including the cavalcade of our articulate athlete of yours!
You know that pipe smoke is still at it!
What?!
They make fun of me all the time!
Why they don't adore me?
They're there, everything will be alright Mo!
Get your hands off me, a fairy!
You're queer!
You're a tomb chumper!
Real men don't touch only during the game!
Yes, Master!
They want singing!
I'll give them singing!
Get on a piano!
Over there!
Ok, Mo!
Now, hit it!
Back in my day, men were straight!
The end day is not today!
That's why I can't tolerate!
Just got slid days!
Spoils were in day by day!
Stop it!
Stop it! You're more on!
What's the matter, Mo?
My wig fell off again!
Ok, alright, where were we?
Spoils were in day by day!
Ah, take it from here!
The guys that like to worship men!
Clicking we will see full indoor!
We live in the middle of the game!
Didn't mean to soothbrush daydance!
Or to tickle hair retained!
Jesus Christ, I really hate!
Jesus, God's Lynn Gai!
Hi, Felicia!
Gee, I love your dress!
And your hair looks so shiny and manageable!
Are you still shampooing with head and shoulders?
Gosh, chick!
I stopped using head and shoulders a long time ago!
I mean, honestly, who grows hair on their shoulders anyway?
Yeah, right.
So, what are you using now?
Well, it's like head and shoulders only without all those additives!
It's just called head!
Let's tell him about it, girls!
If you're tired of the ocean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Reveal fairness and feeling through, yeah, yeah!
Just remember what I've said, yeah, yeah!
You feel better if you get some head!
Wow, where can I get head?
Lots of places, Chick. You can stop by my place later and I'll be happy to give you some
head in 50 minutes. I'll have you shampooed, styled, and blown dry.
You don't miss a lick, do you? Head sound great, but is it expensive?
Not at all, Chick. My brother says there are places downtown where you can get head for less than $10.
Golly, at that price, everyone should be getting head. That's right, Chick. When you say head, you set a mouthful.
Hi, I'm Dr. Raymond Falotti from Freedom Island Industries, here to kill you. Why you should get head?
First, it lubricates each limp hair follicle, leaving in a wreck, listening shaft. Then the scalp's
natural oils are sucked out of the root, leaving your hair soft, shiny, and exhausted. Nothing
does the job like head. Great. Can I get head from my hairdresser Bruce? Probably, but you might
want to try your girlfriend first.
So I can get my head today, yeah, yeah, let's work, go the long, long way, yeah, yeah, you look better and you'll feel
terrific, yeah, yeah, when you get head, you're a lucky step.
What hair with lots of volume? Nothing gets it up like head. Available at a price you won't find
hard to swallow, and it's going down every day.
Connie, we're out of shampoo. Can you go out and get some head?
What did you say? I said I want you to go out and get head.
Oh, thank you, sweet Jesus, I'm going down down.
And head makes a great holiday gift. Last Christmas, my wife gave me some head.
Then I gave her a pearl necklace. I've never seen her so choke up.
My girlfriend used to give me head, then we got married. Now I'm lucky if I get Jurgens
lotion and a national cheer grab.
Oh yeah, oh god.
Head shampoo. Come on, give it a shot. My hair looks great.
You're the map.
Yo, man, we'll start with your Gothamers book. So anyway, let's do a model in West Palm Beach.
Neil, can't disagree with you more about the pot smolty.
Okay, I'm an ex pot addict from the age of 15 to 25.
Yeah, I'm telling you, I was more dicting than code than anything.
I mean, we had to start more dicting than fish food too, I bet.
Correct. You're joking in this pants another room.
Better take a sample, by the way.
Before we got 38 now, I stopped 13 years ago, but before we played baseball, we smoked,
before we went to the movies to smoke, before we had sex, we smoked, before anything,
we need a pot. We couldn't do it without pot.
Yeah, a lot of my friends are still a lot of people.
Let me ask you this as much as I frown upon people who are like obsessed with pot,
because there are people who are juvenile and sit around sifting and picking seeds all day,
and I think that's a life, but nevertheless, how did it have to wait a minute?
But how did they have this green stuff that had no seeds in them?
I mean, how did it affect your life?
It affected it tremendously because it opened the door to, and you're going to think this is
joking. Open the door to Coke. It opened the door to the toilet.
Yeah, yeah.
No, once you violate your body, I guess you better never have a beer because next thing you're
going to be dead on. I never liked beer, but I'm telling you, it affected me in the workplace,
it affected me driving. I had a lot of...
No, but the argument that, you know, it's the same argument as you better never have a beer,
because then you're going to become an alcoholic, and you're going to start drinking,
you know, sticking vodka bottles in your pocket. I mean, there are always going to people,
be people no matter what you're talking about, they're the alcohol stains of the world are going
to go out and eat until they get to be 500 pounds. Does that mean we should outlaw any foods
that are fattening? No, no, but I, you know, I've changed, I have two kids of my own now,
and they're 14 and 11, and they're getting to that age where I remember when I was...
Were they just going to let you better stop? Yeah, no, no, no, I've stopped a long time ago,
but I'm saying now I'm overprotective. He can smell like his debris in his home.
I mean, by parents, like George's, there were refugees from Cuba that came down here.
Well, no humans don't smoke, we know that. They didn't know any better,
they were working 14 hours a day, I was alone at home, and all my friends did,
and we did, and I'm telling them I didn't know anything, but I couldn't disagree with you
anymore. I'm testing for it, and I hope they keep it out of everything, because it's
different from my life. You know something, I know that when I go over to Holland man,
every time I've only been in Amsterdam about 30 times, I'm going to go over there,
it's a miracle that the country can function, you know what? Let me tell you something,
well, while we were at it, we were less aggressive. Let me ask you, have you ever been to Amsterdam?
Never been to Holland. Well, get on a plane to go there, you might learn something.
There's a pot addict for you there, boys and girls, there's a good lesson for everybody.
He's obsessed. It's like the fish food addicts. I say we go to publics right now,
and we may enforce them to take it right out of the freezer container, because we have fish food
addicts already, and those people are going to kill themselves on that crap, because they're out of
control. And let's close down every bar, because we got alcoholics. Let's bring back pro-abition,
baby. Let's prohibit everything. Then we got sex addicts. Just watch, what's his name?
Jerry Springer, he'll do about 20 shows on that this week. Sex addicts. People who can't get enough,
they're doing it. The NBA they want to do drug testing. We got a guy, a Canadian, a jock,
if a snowboarder can wear a jock strap, whatever the hell he was. This guy may lose his gold medal,
because he may have actually inhaled a little bit, or may have actually smoked a little bit,
or may have actually walked through a room somewhere where somebody may have smoked it, or not,
as the case may be. And they found like a little trace in his...
Squirt, Squirt? Yeah. And they're having a nervous breakdown now, because they, you know,
suit a fed. What else? What else can we test for in your system? Definitely have fish food testing,
because we know it makes your blood sugar go away up, and you become irresponsible, and got
only knows you're going to, you're not fit for driving. I wouldn't be surprised if they stop
you at street corners now. It's stoplights, and they do on the spot checks blood sugar test.
You know, they give you that little pin prick, if I can say that. And yeah, look at my finger tips,
man, look at all those pin pricks. That's right, when you diabetic. You have a lot of pin pricks
on the tips of your fingers, but at any rate, they're going to be starting to do that spot checks
on street corners now. And if your blood sugar is like over 250, but, hey, you're straight to jail!
You're a menace to society, you're going to kill somebody out there.
Airline pilot, before you get on that plane, make sure he didn't have no fish food before he took
off. Here's the four-letter deal. Hello. Yes, sir. For some color, I guess I'd be in acute colors,
since I'm not chronic. Okay. Anyway, I consider myself a well-trained, high-precision cynic.
Yes, sir. You're like me with a lot of the things that you talk about. But in the United States, of
course, what right we all have really is the right to be as irresponsible as we want to be,
until you reach a certain limit. And we have these freedoms, and people sort of they abuse them
until it starts costing somebody some money somewhere, and then they got to go and do something
about taking that freedom away. But what does that mean? When has marijuana ever been decriminalized
in America? Well, I mean, it hasn't. But the reasons for that. Are they tried prohibition with
booze? That's your work real well, didn't it? No, and it's a problem. Work for Joe Kennedy real well.
If you can't expect our people to be responsible with the freedoms that they have, like we have a small
business, and we've got, you know, we do contracting enough sort of thing, and you've got guys,
they're not exactly the top model society, but they go out and they're doing physical labor for you,
and they're either climbing rooftops and things like that, and we've had cases in the past where
people were on the influence of the substance, and they can't access it. And then the customer,
well, if you're liable for it, I can understand it, and you're talking about a physical right,
I understand it. And then not only that, but the employee who's you too, even though he was the one
who was irresponsible on the job. So what do you do about that? Well, in that case, that's an
exception. I wouldn't have any problem with that. I can see an NBA where if a guy is stone, he's not
going to injure somebody out on the court, if anything, he'll take fewer shots. And he probably
wouldn't beat up the coach. Well, a good point. But the thing is, we have something that we do at
work here, not that it works, but it's an attempt anyway that's called a drug free workplace.
And you start off your relationship with the business under the assumption that, you know,
you're not going to, this isn't going to be something you're going to be doing on the job. So
we're allowed to drug test before you start the job and that sort of thing. And what's sad about
this is it's amazing how many people who call up looking for a job, and you say, oh, but by the
way, this is a drug free workplace, how many people show up fill out the forms and then just never
appear again. But isn't that their choice? You just got to your family. But, you know, but the thing is,
if business is going to be responsible for what its employees do, then we have to know we have to
feel safe and secure that they're not going to be out to our agency. No, I would have known with that.
I think that you got a, you know, you have a right because you're liable and you have a right to
make sure that they're not doing whatever might impair their senses, etc. But that's a very rare
exception. If somebody's doing an office job at a desk, unless of course they're making decisions,
decisions that, you know, are like national security risking something like that. Yeah, I can
understand that. Or for radio equipment or something like that. Exactly. And I think I might help
have some drugs for these bastards over here. But the thing is, you know, once again, as a society,
if the people aren't going to be responsible enough to be able to decide when they are aren't going
to use the substances you can't expect. But you know, you know, something, you can't expect them to be
involved. But you know, something, sir, let me say something to you. And that is that as long
as things are forbidden, when you go to Europe, there is no drinking age in any country that I
know of in Europe. And yet, as Italy, especially, public drunkenness is frowned upon to such an extent that,
I mean, they would, they would come and beat the crap out of you if they found you staggering around
drunken the street. They would take you under cover somewhere and give you a lecture and sober you
up and tell you better not to ever do it again. And you don't, you don't have any problem of young
people staggering around drunk or killing each other because they're drinking and driving. You
don't have that. Now the French have it because they got a bunch of drumps over there to begin with.
But I'm talking about in countries where they're generally socially responsible in the first place,
like Italy and like Holland and those. You don't have that problem. There's no drinking age.
There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age.
There's no alcoholism rates, you know, in the world, though. And why have this fame in Russia have very
high alcoholism rates and they also have... What does that have to do with Italy? It doesn't.
What does that have to do with Holland, which is the freest country in the world? What does that have to do with it?
It depends on the culture. They grow up with that kind of freedom and the U.S.
Ah, there you go. That's what I just got through saying to you. So as big older you make things for
bitten the more people want them. That's my point. Okay, before I leave or you cut off...
I want to give you something. I don't know if you can use this as a card, but I want to do a
celebrity impersonation for you. Yeah. Okay, see it. Now that wasn't bad. Georgia was almost
cute. It wasn't a very good... Yeah. The consensus is, let's see, Mike from the key says it's too
expensive. That's his... Wow, that's his opinion. He likes it a little weed now and he said,
too damn expensive. Here's Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. What's up, Neil? I love your show.
Thank you so much. Listen, it is kind of expensive, but I wanted to say this whole Marijuana thing is
just out of hand. I mean, the government, they must be some like babbling chimps, pushing buttons
somewhere. They don't realize that Marijuana is probably the basis in toxic on this planet.
It's less harmful than alcohol. It has never been documented to give cancer like, you know,
cigar and cigar. Yeah. I'm not complaining about cigar. It doesn't send your blood sugar raising
up like sugar does either, but sugar. I guarantee you right now, sugar was a lot more dangerous
than marijuana ever can be. And I don't think they did any sugar testing on this Schmendor
Gabriotti guy at this snowboard that won a gold medal over their nogginal. Absolutely. It's sugar.
Let's take his blood sugar and see if he was doing fish food before he did the thing.
Absolutely. And, you know, I like the guys too. I was listening to the idea. I was wondering how come
you didn't like Garcia and Vegas. I wanted to ask you out as well. That's like my cigar.
You know, I do like Garcia Vegas. I like them, but it's they don't make them in Nix, which is my
sponsor. So I'm not going to come on here and say, hey, I smoke Garcia Vegas. Which one do you like
in particular? The Galante's? You never have the English Corona's? Oh, I don't touch those
English ones. Oh, yeah. The English Corona's are fabulous, especially if you're rolling your
open. Okay. But thank you, Roniel. Okay. Have a great day. Let's go to Miami. Hello.
Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how's it going? Great. Well, listen, you know, a couple bad things.
Unfortunately, marijuana is classified as a schedule one drug, which means it's right up there
with cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and Jerry Springer is perhaps the worst drugs of all mankind.
And fish food. And fish food. But, you know, this is just a word for that guy who was that guy
kidding when he there was a guy you called in. He said, I run a workplace and I tell people that I
drug test, but I don't really drug test. And then that just sort of weed out the part in mind
the point. I mean, we doubt the people that really don't want to get drug. What was it? What was it?
What was I missed that whole thing? But he said that he drug tested drug test. No, he's done drug
test. And he said that a lot of people come by and they fill out the application when they find
out it's a drug free workplace that they don't hear from him again is what he said. All right. Well,
I think he's a fascist because, you know, he's basically just got a bunch of people that we're
doing like yard work or something, you know. But they're going up on roofs and things and he's
responsible. He's got the liability insurance for that. I can understand that. I don't know, man.
I mean, if you're if you're still looking, if you're still not on any substance, I don't care what
is. I don't want to be responsible for your work or driving or whatever else you're doing.
You know, the thing is that they might not be up on the roof and be stoned at the same time.
They might go home, watch Jerry Springer and then be stoned and then go back to work and be
perfectly straight and still fail at miserable tests. Okay, I think this shows on now. What the
hell was the point? I wasn't that away to run long enough to find out. Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am. Hi, how are you? Great. How you be doing? I'd be doing fine.
All right. I just wanted to make a comment about the pot head that called earlier that said he's
more for 10 years. Yeah. He said that the marijuana made him try other drugs. I think that he's
been betrayed as everyone else has been betrayed by all the upside people in this country because
they tell you that marijuana be bad for you and it's evil and all this stuff. And then when you try
it and it's not that bad, you say, well, they lied about this. Well, maybe they lied about everything
else too. So deliciously different marijuana deliciously different marijuana.
This poor guy is going to go back to Canada with his middle between his legs. Never be the same again
because they found this little teeny tiny trace of marriage wini in his test.
Neil? Yes. I say we all get on a plane, go to Italy and smoke a blight. All right.
All right. See you. Hi. The Pope is over there. He's doing it. If it's okay for the Pope,
how come I didn't smoke it? Well, you think that big puffer over the Vatican is? That's not what
you think it is. That's the celebratory smoke. Yeah, they're celebrating it all right. Why do you
think they keep burning incense? Covered up. That's why they do a lot of things. That's why they put
those gowns on to cover it up. That's why they wear those kilts and sculls and baby. Covered up.
Ask anybody in that neighborhood. They tell you this country where the Gantra be good.
Raslanan has some he wants to sell and from a mile away you can detect the smell of smoke.
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. He light up the split and talk. Smoke Gantra smoke smoke.
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. The Gantra be good. You can carry lots of herb in the gunny sack.
Smoke it every day until your longstone blight. With all the money that we have made. Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid.
American tourists come here and say, got nothing like this in the US say they smoke.
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. They light up the split and talk. They begin to cough and choke.
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. The Gantra be good.
Mama tell her son you are an astamian. You like to smoke the giant stiff whenever you can.
Many people coming here for miles around. A bite the earth for you by the ounce of nip.
Raslanan say to her mama you right. They can't you be good tonight and then they smoke.
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. They light up the split and talk.
Smoke Gantra smoke smoke. Smoke Gantra smoke smoke.

i agree i can't can argue with that one that
i've always helicopter wasting time because people are growing a few plants
in their backyard in the meantime up the corner kids are shooting

clients more than twenty thousand men between west palm beach in north my me

crap probably ran a clean operation probably not too many people get no
diseases from that operation probably had only up and up he's gone to jail
everything in his god damn countries illegal man everything is uh... the forbidden
fruit if we can say on of course that's so forget that talk about a fruit
forget about that everything's illegal
everything's immoral unless of course it's the politicians who are doing it
like dan romer he's doing it over there and like uh... bill clinton of course he's uh...
doing it the left and right in which we like him a lot more respect him because he's

matter of opinion most countries even some that we consider very backward uh... the the legal
age for consensual sexual acts is fifteen or sixteen in this country it's what seventeen for
heterosexual acts and eighteen for yes here there's a different age for heterosexual or homosexual
acts of course or is it eighteen for both there's all these gray areas depending on which state

lies in a prone or uh... what position if if you're more than two years older you can be sixteen

and i grew up and i mean i remember seeing my grandmother my uh my mom
and just like talking in tongues
and dropping on the floor and i would just sit there and giggle
you know i made no sense to me with so
ever um anyway real quick nil
um it's enough to give me the heebie jibis just thinking
i think you are song ones
it was uh for the panthers no say too
and i got another one please let me sing it
okay go ahead okay
i'm christweber
i'm christweber
god arrested for a bag of red hair
i'm the ghetto dream
to play be bar without a drug screen
i'm christweber
i'm christweber
call time out when i got sprayed with pepper
burn my eyes that's mean
how about a couple drops of
vizeme i'm james brown
i'm james brown
nil
uh included
here's minis springs hello
yeah hi i was calling because i heard the guy talking about
uh the fact that it was legal and it was legal
but you know i don't i don't smoke marijuana
i haven't done since college days but
but the thing is i'm a firm believer that uh
as long as it doesn't kill you
and you're harming anybody else go ahead and do
let me ask you this
can you go into a drugstore right now
and buy rat poison
yes yes you can
and that will kill you and you know it's got warning labels on the on the can or
whatever you're buying it
and you can go you can go into any story
you can go into a supermarket you go into drugstore
and by legally all kinds of substances that will kill you
you can go into home depot and buy paint thinner
and if you drink it it will kill you
i guarantee you that make no mistake about it
so the idea that something may or may not be harmful for you which is all very
subjective by the way and a lot of it very dubious and debatable
but since when is that the guy the only job that i see the government is to tell us
you know give us the information
tell us can this be harmful to me how harmful is it
and then let me make my own guide damn decision
well that's what i'm saying
you know the thing is is that the only reason it was made illegal
is because it's relatively easy to grow and difficult to attack
and by the lobbying of both alcohol
and cigarettes which it's well alcohol is relatively easy
but the question of cigarettes growing it
drying it out and actually making cigarettes on your own most people aren't going to do
whereas anybody could like grow plant in a backyard
and they just simply take a few leaves
let them dry out in the oven and then smoke it
oh my god
and apparently that's what they don't want
and there would be a lot of competition for those two other industries
oh my god
whereas in the back row that's proving beyond a shadow without
that's killing people every day
there are people puffing on faggots right now
who are going to croak from lung cancer
and emphysema and we've warned them and we've warned them
and we've had all those craggy voice guys
the guy that used to play Hamilton burger on peri Mason
what the hell was his name and what the guy i'm talking about
i'm dying from lung cancer
and John Wayne and all these other big macho guys that are croaking
and if you you know they tell you that
and you still want to smoke then go ahead be my guest
and enclosed just don't blow it in my face
that's what the moniker said
they're puffing on cigarettes too
exactly have a great day
okay what are we getting all worked up about
just because we realize we live in a country
where our freedoms are very limited
we have a bunch of assholes sitting around deciding
what you can do and what you can't do
and telling you what's good for you and what's not
and then we have some idiots who are going along with that
who want to be manipulated
well if you want to be manipulated okay go to some fascist god damn place
go to some communist country
if you go to Cuba for christ's
go live with the del he'll tell you what you can do
and what you can't do go live with the pope
you'll have one hell of a time there man

perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word
f**k out of all the English words that begin with a letter F
is the only word that is referred to as the F word
it's the one magical word
just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love
f**k as most words in the English language
is derived from German, the word flikin, which means to strike. In English, f*** falls into
many grammatical categories as a transit of verb, for instance, John f***ed Shirley. Its
meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective, such as John's doing all
the f***ing work. As part of an adverb, Shirley talks to f***ing much. As an adverb, enhancing
an adjective, Shirley is f***ing beautiful. As a noun, I don't give a f***ing. As part
of a word, abso f***ing loosely or inf***ing credible. And as almost every word in a sentence,
f***ing f***ing f***ers. As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility
of f***ing. As in these examples describing situations such as fraud, I got f***ed that
they use carlot. This may, off f*** it. Trouble, I guess I'm really f***ed now. Aggression,
don't f*** with me, buddy. This missile, why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself.
I'm sure you can think of many more examples. Say it loudly and proudly. F*** you!

It used to be hot back in the good old days,
before the old part came and politicians stayed whole day.
This town was once alive.
They even had spring grey.
There were things to do all night,
inbroward and in day.
Let the old fart walking dead,
and the tower to the left,
the crooked wheels,
who just got off the boat.
I heard Neil Rogers cry.
It's just a day that cry on me die.
Everyone who thought the day knew best,
or the ones who brought us forward,
they told us to buy a meal.
Can you believe there was a time?
They had casinos and hal
and dales,
tried to organize the crime,
but the experiments had failed.
When the brain did kick his down,
and tore the thugs up down,
they pissed along the place.
It's a big cut in the screen.
I heard Neil Rogers cry.
This is the day that cry on me die.
Why did they place a cousin in
what's self-serving as a woman
was at the knee?
I heard Neil Rogers cry.
What about the bad boy?
All the white folks hate the black folks,
and the black folks hate the white folks,
to hate all but the right folks
is an old established rule,
but during the national brotherhood week,
national brotherhood week,
lean a horn and sheriff's park
are dancing cheap to cheeky.
It's fun to utilize the people you despise
as long as you don't let them in your school.
Older poor folks hate the rich folks,
and the rich folks hate the poor folks,
all of my folks hate all of your folks.
It's American as apple pie,
but during national brotherhood week,
national brotherhood week,
New Yorkers love the poise
and the cats or reekens cause it's very sheesh.
Step up and shake the hand of
someone you can't stand,
you can tolerate him if you try.
Older Protestants hate the Catholics,
and the Catholics hate the Protestants,
and the Hindus hate the Muslims,
and everybody hates the Jews,
but during the national brotherhood week,
national brotherhood week,
it's national everyone smile at one
and other hood week be nice to people
who are inferior to you.
It's only four a week, so have no fear.
Be grateful that it doesn't last for you.
Woo! Hiya, Pally!
I'm sorry, I've waited to see you in there.
Don't look okay. I'm making you.
You always close the door, will you?
I can't.
Don't go looking in the door.
I spread my legs when I splatter.
My cheeks are touching the floor.
Don't want nobody to see me like that.
I'm reading the paper.
Then the handicaps door.
Please don't come in.
Beasts and gildies.
Ah!

Don't go looking in the door.
I'm dropping toys in the well.
Please don't turn around.
Try to ignore.
I'm putting to do something.

Like a gold.
Like my political, my name.
She said, for her he blew you.
You got a look for you.
I said, for you.
She called the circle the size of four and look of size.
He grabbed my human, gave a blade, a swing.
And then he cut me.
He cut me.
I used to be real and leave a bow on home like an axe.
I was bigger than that until the rabbi caught me.
He cut me, cut me, cut me, cut me.
Try to find a Jew that's how you do.
That's how you're supposed to know me one.
The only one.
Because of your he blew you.
He can be hung of your Jew.
He hung of your old Jew.
And my police, I'm still on.
The police, I still are.
My religious humanity.
He had the rabbi cut me.
He cut me.
I say, please don't cut me.
Don't worry.
Oh, like a nut.
Help me try to grow without taking a hand.
And not be home like an athlete.
Rub me, rub me, rub me.
Rub me, rub me.
Rub me, rub me.

It's nothing.
It's a dog.
Oh, no, man, it's a little bit far, man.
It's a little bit far, man.
It's a little bit far, man.
It's Barbie with all the fly accessories.
Fish and head stockings.
Three in-spite heels.
Genuine needle marks on the arm.
And removable teeth.
Oh, man, yo, yo, yo, check it.
Oh, look out for your teeth, miss.

Hooker, bitch, Barbie.
And coming soon, Andre the talking pig.
What?
Bitch, get your ass in the car.
I said, put it down.
Run along to the gate square.
And it's got a great big zipper in the back of my pants.
Get off the horse at the old barn door.
Got my saddle burned around.
I'm arriving on the horn.
Look inside, poster dancing all around.
There goes Johnny and his mother's night gown.
All the man left and all the man right.
All the man needs his appellation fight.
Give your partner a silly smirk.
All going hands for a big circle jerk.
Volunteers all raise your hand.
Who's going to be the next pivot man?
Invatch your partner home for a drink.
Lick your lits and give him a wink with a great big smile and a great big nod.
Let him know your gerbil's beclawed.
Getting a head start in learning is very important for your child.
No matter what language your school system recognizes.
Class repeat after me.
AEIOU.
And if your school system endorses black English, then getting that head start means getting hooked on ebonyx.
Class repeat after me.
AEIOU.
Hooked on ebonyx teaches your child the intricacies of this new language through direct comparison with regular English.
Just listen.
Can I please have a cookie?
Good. Now try it in ebonyx.
Give me the damn cookie bits.
Very good to me.
Hooked on ebonyx is the learn-of-home language system that will have your bright young preschooler talking like a violent gang member in just six short weeks.
He'll learn the double negatives.
I know, fuck them.
The excess plural.
No, no, no, no, that's what it reminds.
And the proper way to pose an inquiry.
Yeah, let me ask you a question.
Hooked on ebonyx. Order today.
And by the time your child is ready for school.
Hey, go into no dance school.
He'll be ready to drop out. That's our guarantee. Hooked on ebonyx.
Hooked on ebonyx is not endorsed by anyone in the right mind.
You come onto me and whisper things in my ear.
It sounds so odd.
But if you want to tell me, you're slow.
There's things about me that I don't think you know.
I'm underage.
I said and jean, you should be scared of me.
Cause you forgot that she lived for sweet when he.
If I sweet, you would have breathed and made.
She was 25 but she's just a teen.
Perfectee. I've been my last sweet.
Daddy called me a cop last night.
So my rest got perfect to see.
Because I'll have such a ring.
None of my skirts teach my needs.
And I but just think right out of my show.
She's underage.
She'll think.
First 25, you should be scared of her.
Yeah.
And rolling stones, breath made of a dynamite.
She's looking right by.
She was 25 but she's just a teen.
I did this for me.

Would you fear your nephew is in hell?
I feel that my nephew
is not with the Lord at no
Not with the Lord, in other words in hell
I don't know, I feel no one alone
No one can be cause a
He can't
cause his body is like a limo
You fear that that Roman Catholic
Communionist, they ate your nephew's body
Yes, sir
All right, we have on the line in Van Aes here
Roman Catholic priest on KFI in 640, hello
How you doing? Good
First of all, I put my condolences to you
on the line with your nephew
Are you a priest? Yes, I am
Okay, so I just want to let you
press by something for you, okay?
Yes, sir, this is just
you've been missing form about
the Catholic Church
What if you just hang on on explain to what I believe
and then you can draw your own conclusion
Are you a priest?
Release me from teaching it
and you draw your own conclusion
Let the father explain, okay?
Okay, first of all, we believe that
when we see communion
we receive the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
Oh, to my God
Well, hold on, man, I mean
I'm just calling to let you know what I believe is
You eat flesh and blood
If you want to look at it, that way that's fine
Oh, my God, I want to find
This is our belief and you draw your own conclusion
I want to find
Now, you've got to let the father explain
Well, when I want to hear you talk about it
What if he doesn't listen from?
This is our hell-raiser, like Clive Parker's young man
Okay, the young sir, because you've been missing form about
What happens to your nephew and I will tell you
You eat the butt, you eat the whole damn thing
Excuse me? Don't you eat it?
We eat the host, yeah
The host?
But he sees the whole body of the man
That's not what I said
You said you eat the blood and the flesh
Of whom?
On the man?
No, on Jesus Christ
Oh, God, that is a blasphemy
Well, if you choose to believe that
I'm trying to do it until you're not by belief
So you need to take it to the religion form
Do you eat up on the booty too?
I'm not going to answer that
I don't understand what that means
What does this man talk about eating the Lord Jesus?
Let him finish
Let him just say what he has to say
The scriptures man, where Jesus took bread
And blessed and broken and said
Take this and eat it
This is my body
And then he said the cup of wine he said
Take and drink this is my blood
And again he said, I'm going to eat my body
And drink my blood and I'm going to write the name
Oh my God
This is good Friday
Exactly, and you're talking about eating up on Jesus
I'm going to tell you that
For me what we believe
You grab it on Jesus, ain't you?
You want?
Grab it all over on Jesus
If I think you choose to believe
And my nephew, what about him?
Okay man, I'm again
I'm back on Jesus
Then Catholics, Matt, done your boy
You want to laugh on the floor?
You want to laugh on the floor?
You want to laugh on the floor?
You want to laugh on the floor?
I'll tell you
Listen to me
It's like a brother best homie
Listen father, I thank you for taking the time
I really do
How are you? I'm your good Easter
You pay for your sins
Well, only better to die
That's true, thanks father
That was a Roman Catholic priest
They're making on my boy like a brother best friend
Oh, you can eat me
What was it?
What's it called man?
Oh, you could eat me, bro
Oh, you could eat me, bro
Oh, you could eat me, bro
Oh, God
So, I understand
Has that sonny love been retarded?
Voice of bombers the wrong way
And oven barons can be in America
Where they follow books like cheese
The United States of arrogance
And by Bush and his family
We beg of this country
Of the humbling torque the largest maze
And I disagree
I don't want to be a Pax America
In the goddamn USA
What's a few thousand innocent lives
Stop living it the last
If you want that SUV to drive
You're gonna need more gas
It's the greatest country in the world
They train us to believe
And anyone who says that obviously
And so forth to lead
And oven barons to be in America
Where we take triologically
We've a flag in one hand with our hand in the sand
And blindly follow the powers that be
Habitat tick, ho, ho
Up, washing stink from news
On a 65 inch screen
Scratch your balls and fire
Everything's okay
In the goddamn USA
Go, let's marry
Oh, oh, oh
As Nancy K was leaving her ring
She's lucked up from behind
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer came down
Upon her knee
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer made sure
On victory
A limb-pick-madden round on you is an ugly ground
Over every move
She can't find the groove
She's off balance
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She foregoes her plan
Makes her way into the stand murder on her mind
She has never minded a challenge
Oh, oh, oh, oh
The crowd they make a break for the door
But it's too late to run
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer just smashing in their heads
She would not leave little hammer till everyone was dead
2048, Tom, you're at the perigate
St. Pete checks his book
He gives her a look and he tells her
Now, out, out, out
She claims she's innocent
Laces up and throws a 50 ton of teeth on the line
This guy's out of line and he's got to go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
As St. Pete was turning the page
Tom, you're took perigate
Bang, bang, ton, you're still the hammer rang saint
