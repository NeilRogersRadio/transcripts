Not to you.
And anyway, here's the fact that we apologize profusely because we're apologizing to people
I can't hear us.
Let's shout it out.
Now I'll talk a lot like the beast.
Seriously, this morning he was like pinning the needles in here he was screaming so loud.
He must have went into Beenerboy and went into the building.
We apologize because our internet feed is down.
Oh, how unusual.
Cain O'Vill.
Yeah.
Remember when her show used to be on Cain O'Vill?
She was on right after Cape Valorant.
But you know, it's just another piece of crap because from a technical standpoint we're
just over over to limits.
Last night they had 75 ball games going on all at the same time on 125 different radio stations.
There were people bouncing off the walls in here that they were so psychotic trying to
get all this stuff on here.
Are we back up?
Should be.
No, no, wait a minute.
Does that say yes and you say should be back up?
No, it says should be back up.
That's what he quote.
Oh, it should be back up.
What does that mean in the future?
Like now.
I'll find out really quickly.
Oh, what a place.
What a place.
This is called spreading yourself to a thin and then of course on top of that after broadcasting
50,000 different ball games that nobody gives a crap about against a bunch of girls schools
and exhibition games and the Marlins losing their 500th in a row.
Then we got Ferrell doing a show from the Bahamas which he can't hear us and we can't hear
him and he's talking a language that nobody understands which is fine.
What is it all about?
What the hell?
We're back up.
Now let's hear it.
The feed is back up.
So you people that are faxing me here and I got the one from Allen and Alexandria.
I got one here from Jim and get your internet feed.
Okay, we got it going but thanks for alerting us because otherwise what that would we know?
Would we know?
No.
Am I right?
Absolutely.
Thank you.
Don't forget Cadbury Dark Chocolate for those people listening on the web.
Hey, listen, it's important to a lot of people out there.
There are people who believe it or not around the world who listen to this show on the internet.
This is their life.
Which is pretty goddamn sad but nevertheless.
Well, I got these markets that have nothing in them.
Like Windixi?
Yeah.
I've been there.
Not no more.
Anyway, Cadbury Dark Chocolate, that's the cats me out.
That's where it's at.
By the way, they, I mentioned it caught a rat.
Am I anic?
I don't know if you mentioned it on the area.
But then there was another one crawling around yesterday and John said it sounded like
the trap like that.
So it just snapped.
But then he said after that he heard some, now see, I don't really know how those work.
Now you would know since you're an outdoorsy kind of backwards yahoo.
That's me, yah.
Now, Mars traps I know because mice are like little in the Mars trap and it's a, that's
bye bye.
But like a rat trap or a coon trap or something like that.
Well, that, the rat trap is just bigger.
It snaps them just as, yeah.
So in other words, they're like dead immediately when they're dead.
Well, you know, a few seconds.
Because he said it sounded like it was crawling around or something like that.
They, they, they do some death.
They do, they do, they do like the death dance.
Yeah.
They, they ride and kick and.
And, uh, well, I'll be damned.
That's bad.
Now see, that makes me feel, well, I wouldn't know if it was, if it was a little mouse who
would make you feel bad.
When I lived in how Indiana many years ago when I worked in Sturgis, Michigan, WSDR,
Sturgis, Michigan, what a place.
Hey, they had a place there where you still have a lunch here.
We didn't have the best goddamn clam chowder in the Midwest.
I used to, for lunch, when I would, it was two big bowls of clam chowder.
That'd be my lunch.
Nothing else.
No, I'm great.
Just the chowder.
It could bathe in it.
It's great.
Oh, man, I do love that stuff.
I can't remember the name of the restaurant.
And of course, in Sturgis, Michigan.
But anyway, so I lived right across, right down to Hershey Highway, because Sturgis is
right in southern Michigan by the Indiana border.
And I lived in this little tiny town called Howe, Indiana.
Okay.
Right down the street from Del Pletcher's farm, Del Pletcher was a harness driver that got
kicked out of every track in North America.
But at any rate, uh, what is?
Huh?
Nice.
Well, you don't interrupt me when I'm talking about Del Pletcher.
This is important stuff.
So anyway, one day, and I had an actually, I was thinking about this yesterday.
I'm wondering how much rent did I pay because I rented a house.
And I guess, I don't know, maybe it was a hundred bucks a month or something like that,
because back in those days, how much was I making?
A hundred and a quarter of a month, a week or something?
Not much.
You're a million there.
Yeah.
Not necessarily.
This is 1966.
I'm thinking.
Yeah.
So anyway, I'm out there in the country.
And I got a nice, big old house that I'm renting.
And, uh, I'm in the kitchen one day and I look up on the cupboard and sitting there.
It looked like a scene from a Walt Disney movie sitting on the cupboard.
It looked at me right in the eye.
There's a little mouse.
Cute little mouse.
Yeah.
Nasty creature.
Kill it.
So I got a broom and actually I was trying to kill the damn thing and, uh, if they run
like hell, somehow I got it out of the house.
It's just the whole ass.
Hold its little ass.
No, but seriously, I don't know.
I mean, you sit there and look at it and look it back at your mouse.
This is a very innocuous creature as opposed to a rat, which is a nasty, gross thing.
They're, they're all bad.
And let me say it again.
No, mice aren't bad.
Kill them all.
They're no nasty.
I say kill them all, but don't you feel bad to kill a little mouse?
You're a bastard.
Are you kidding?
There's probably a plotting Prince William for spearing that bambi over there in Africa.
It was a dip dip.
When they turned them into a spearchucker in Africa, that was bad.
It was a dip.
And the British people are almost as upset about that as they are about Tony Blair.
Yeah.
That was bad.
Because that was just a little deer, a beautiful deer.
And of course, does Prince William need a god damn deer?
Wasn't a deer.
Bastard.
It was like a little, what do they call those?
Dictics.
It was a dig dig.
He speared a dig dig.
Yes.
Maybe he had some spotted dig for lunch.
It's a small, too, horror, and first supper.
Maybe he had, well.
And anyway, they're pretty, the worlds are very embarrassed about that whole.
No, no, they're not.
They're not kind of little things.
They're into the fox hunting too, you know, going out with the hounds and a whole
deer.
The Brits are just, they're a bunch of barbarians, you know.
They butchered up the whole goddamn world.
Just like it said, they're in, wasn't that in Berlin for Columbine?
Yeah.
I think what they talked about the Brits.
The Brits.
Yeah.
And about the Chinese and about the Germans and the fact that there's so few little
violence in Germany now, and it has nothing to do with their history.

No, no nobody says that but assholes like George Corso and Miguel Escobar were saying back in the early part back in June when I came back for a week
They were saying oh well
Do you think we ought to let Neil come back to work right away when it returns from Toronto?
Where should he go into into quarantine for 10 days because of the SARS you know, you know and the AIDS oh
Yeah, that's right. I forgot about that speaking of assholes like Miguel
What are you doing what what a guy's name is he doing now? Is he got you put another perverted picture on our website?
Did you put another guy pitching a tent?
No, he's just trying to suck up to me
That's why he put that picture under there because he's you know
He realizes what an asshole he was would all at the quarantine. Oh, and he's got SARS
No one you almost passed out of your wedding. You're such a guy then pussy, okay?
Cubans are pussies make no mistake about it
She's seeing what I just went through because of you by the way. What is that?
I was on my uncle's friendship and all the employers are Cuban and earlier he was unfair
Off on your ass screw them tell me get back kind of an anibos
Screw you and silly okay
By the way, see you take the bananas off your coffin where you please. It's embarrassing. We're starting to rot
In fact the what's your name? What what's your name on the the chimpanzee on passions
Precious precious is gonna start eating the bananas if you don't put them away
Anyway, yesterday's pool we asked generally speaking
Which religious group in the US is the most funn- well, at least they had the station now. No, that's something
I'll say that much at this big place that Miguel was talking about at least they were listening to WQM nice going on he goes
Well, you're laughing about they're not uptight like you are they don't care about this crap about all that's right
They wouldn't miss a second they know that that Rosanna Rosanna Dana, or Rosa whatever her name is
She didn't know what a bitch she is and a phony
They've seen her husband too by the way. Oh brother
Generally speaking which religious group in the US is the most fanatic we ask yesterday
253 votes before we finally shut that baby down
Born again Christians 856 make no mistake about it. They are fanatic. They're dangerous. They just refuse to uh
Buy by the Constitution they kind of make it up as they go along
856 votes. That's damn near that 68.3 percent more than two-thirds
Jehovah's Witnesses made a nice showing coming from a nowhere in the second place 132
Even beating out Muslims 127
Orthodox Jews had 81
Catholics only 31 and Mormons small potatoes here 26 Mormons here are like, you know
We don't see them too much not the script. No, but I mean you just don't hear a lot from them
You don't see them too much. Nope on their bicycles with a nice
neat white shirts and black ties. They don't wield any power here
They don't wield any power. No. Well, maybe we could like get our own mighty Mormon radio station going
Okay, mighty Mormon power power ranger radio rangers right sounds good to me
So there's your 253 votes and the essence is the bottom line is that boarding in Christians need some help
Okay, no, I take that back. We need some help and protection from the boarding in Christians
And I know we have a few in our audience and the please reconsider that's my suggestion to you reconsider your evil ways
Okay, and your and your intolerant attitudes. We can't deal with it
Rob, they were oh, and I got a couple of pre-stories that were faxed to me here
Now why didn't you hear this? I'll also get that fax that J.J the X-Fan that's I'll get to him eventually
But I'm dragging this out because I want to make Duff happy today, you know
He's praying. He's in there rubbing his legs together like a um
Like a grasshopper. Don't grasshoppers do that? Crickets
He's doing it like buddy Holly
He's in their rubbin his legs together with clearance
And the praying that we actually go all the way through to with none of those comedy bits
Try to come in here and grab my schedule and change that next Wednesday
But being the law-biting citizen that I am
Last time I saw this schedule in fact, you know, I'm gonna do I'm gonna faxed
George. I'm gonna fax this schedule to Toronto. So I have it up there and then of course he can't change it
hahaha
And if I don't happen to show up Wednesday morning, I can say hey, I'm just following a schedule. You moron
Here sports radio 560. She went
Back in you've seen him on channel seven news first as a two bit reported now as a two bit anchor that wears more makeup than tami fae baker and Maryk combined
Rick Sanchez sings
Here are the dulls and tones of the men who brought you crime check, Rick Sanchez.
Like with the rancher, you're overgrabbing our purr-car by our blue-blood.
Rick Sanchez, overgrabbing our purr-car, by our blue-blood.
Rick Sanchez sings, give me a hug with a bluff and a laugh and a laugh and a laugh.
Don't miss Rick Sanchez in his pasty face tour over Hylia. It's one show you all want to miss. Take for a good one
Rick Sanchez he loves his audience. I
want to miss you. Wow wow wow. Is that impressive or what? No. 60 bucks. And you know the three people who came and bought the stuff that's 20 bucks to pop three people. That's the audience at 4 30 in the morning. Are there only two people that they bought three items?
60 bucks. You know something if that's that's a message right there. You know I like your willot. He's a good guy and a good friend, but it's time to hang it up. Right?
Oh probably holding more. I'll do it for you. I'm all right in there between Mo and Gildi two to five in the morning. Sounds like a winner to me. Joe Rose 5 to 8. Huh?
In fact, you're Rose 5 to 6 and Joe with the for real 6 to 10. Okay. Sounds like a winner to me. Pell. Take it all right. The new poll is up already. Now what is this? Best of the older well. Thank God. Well actually raise your mind today. I thought for we only need. We only need the 140 bucks to get over 17
grand yesterday. And I'm thinking to myself that's seven CDs or key chains or a combination of these things. 140 cake. Yeah, like like falling off a log in the middle of the
Kuhlwasi river. And they raise 60 bucks to one mark for best of me. Let that's that's a bird. I would just leave town. I get in the car in the middle of the night like Tom don't like us. I pack up my goodies. I stuff my wife in the trunk. Joe. And I just get that lot of here. That's bad. That's pathetic.
60 bucks. Anyway, we will have a best of the love and hit today a serious one in the hooters parking lot. Oh, it's tonight. No, it's well. What is this? See, you know this Miguel, like I told you, he's so worried about whether I brought SARS back. He can't get his act together. It's in the hooters parking lot today.
Hey, South of corner of Pines University. The only problem is he doesn't have a time. I mentioned that to him. He said when I get there. That actually does mean something. What do you mean by that? It means he's going to leave as soon as he's able and we will start as soon as he finishes servicing.
Dureen and screw in not necessarily in that order and clearance. You do want him to get going. No, he can do that in a heartbeat. You know, scored, scored no problem.
Anyway, so there will be a hooters parking lot, South of corner of Pines University. So that'll be our first broiled van hit. Where were we the other day? I forgot. Wasn't it in date somewhere? I forgot. Have insurer.
Oh, that's right. Mark were 200 and what? That's where Joe and Mark were. Right. He was in. Where now was he? I'm a rain. I don't know. I forgot.
I haven't real problems. Boys and girls are Alzheimer's is kicked in here. Q. I. Am. But in any way, they'll be there and we'll let you know what time. So give you plenty of opportunity. Like, you know, dress up.
Yeah, slick down your hair or like paste it down real good. So we don't fall off and get embarrassing. We'll talk about you on the air. And then you can go and get your best stuff. Also tonight, 6 to 8 PM George and I guarantee you'll raise more than 60 bucks. I can't guarantee that.
If you don't raise more than 60 bucks, don't come in tomorrow. OK. And if you do raise more than tonight from 6 to 8, George at the new solid golden for lottery on the Northwest corner of open and federal, which is new.
I'm going to get a skank club. And tomorrow, George will be at Bill Siles. But now I don't think he's going to raise too much tomorrow. Bill Siles, Boulevard of savings on the Northwest 36th Street corner just west of 27th Avenue. Get the best of Neil and enjoy free food from Atlantic City.
Substitutes drinks from Dickens cider. That's 11 to 1 tomorrow. So we got some busy beavers around here. Bill Siles. Anybody who worked there know who he is? Who I am? Anybody over there? Listen to the station? No. No where we are in the Nile. That's good. They call me a sandwich a guy.
Yeah, that's how it's a guy. And of course they just are there to hop up the free food and do a great job of it, by the way. OK, here's the new pool. It's up there already. And of course the astute people in the audience who are hop right on it. They're already voting on it. I like that. I like the way we do that now.
Have no fear, Eric. The old daughtering fool that I am. I'm right on top of it. What does this say? It says I used to go to Catholic Church every Sunday and give my 10% as the church required.
When he walked in and already say what do you require? Now I go to the take now I go to take back 20% from the basket when anybody's looking just for the simple fact that they pissed me off and I'm not going to take it anymore.
Signed five finger. I don't know what this means. Five finger discount. I don't know what he's taking his five fingers. He's sloughing it out of the sack.
Five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the 18 TNT and Verizon. I wear the hell's the pole. I mean I know it's up there, but I hear it is.
Who do you think is or was the most dislike media person in South Florida? Now I put this up because here's one that Mo might not win and it looks like he won't.
And I knew who the winner just could be. I don't want to piss off those crazy Cubanos by the way anymore that Miguel was just talking about wherever he came from from the cock fights.
But the fact of the matter is here's one Cuban guy they don't like too much and we're not talking about Cecil Cruz either.
We're talking about Ricky Tiki Sanchez. That's why I play that bit in case you didn't notice. Who do you think is or was the most dislike person in the media person in South Florida?
And my list consisted of Greg Budell, Rick Sanchez, Mo Howard David, Neil Rogers, George Rodriguez because we put ourselves on air and don't bother us.
And of course the Humper Hank Goldier. In all the days Hank probably would do better news right now because he's metaled a lot and he's turned into a pretty good guy. We like him a lot.
In fact Hank will be on from Vegas today. How do you like that? Are you ready for that? I'm ready.
Another one of those tough assignments for the Humper on your gambling channel 560 QIM. Bed on it. Remember how we used to slow it on IOD used to be depend on it?
QIM, we got the crap here man. Bed on it. Whatever you want. Bed on it.
And there's already 77 votes on here as in 77 WABC. Cousin Brucy by the way is an asshole with an even worse hair piece than Mo.
77 votes. Who do you think is or was the most dislike media person in South Florida? Ricky Tiki Sanchez. He's taking it up the butt with 35 votes.
Mo Howard David, who is going to maybe give me a run for the money but he's 21. Only 21 Mo. And by the way don't be calling the station Mo.
Well when you're pleased that's what Rick in whatever the hell are you name and Joe and Mark said no more calling this goddamn radio station.
If he ain't calling Joe he's calling Joe and Mark. If he ain't calling Mo he's calling Joe. It's Mo Joe radio.
Yeah we got Mo Joe radio in Toronto. Why the hell not having Mo Joe radio in South Florida? Okay shut up.
So the thing just changed again now that people are aware what the pool is 87 votes. Rick Sanchez 39.
Mo Howard David at 25. Hank Goldberg eight near Roger seven. George Rodriguez seven you and I are tied and Greg Badell only one.
Well that's because everybody hates Greg Badell. They do. He's got a faded away though. Yeah he's faded away into oblivion is on a station which we don't even know where it is on the dial and don't care we couldn't care less.
Here's an interesting thanks marginally. It says by the way if nothing's going to do today. He's got to be dreaming.
There's as much chance that we're going to let the entire like this crap today as clearance getting laid with like a real woman by the end of the year.
You know what I'm saying? Define the real. One with the right body parts. All three body parts required two breasts and a slot.
And now my Hank goes to Vegas. He likes to play the slot right with nothing extra as well right. Right. Okay.
Here's the facts and Roger Coppnik who says in 1977 WQM had a DJ named Dr. Boogie. He was also the coordinator for the high school course bottom segments and I was the
one who's wondering if anybody still remembers Dr. Boogie. No. And knows his real name if he's still around.
It's sadder and do we know? No. It says Roger Coppnik. Do we believe that there's really such a name as Roger Coppnik? Why would he lie? Maybe Dr. Boogie is Coppnik. You think?
I never planned on being governor of California. So I was allowed to be honest. I was doing a lot of things. I wasn't thinking about politics and being governor of California.
It's so scary that there are no words to describe. It's just it's and the fact that these annual morons, you maniacs in the media presenting this with a straight face like this is a real news story.
Like this is somebody who's credible who's got qualifications even to be god damn rat catcher forget about dog catcher. Yeah. Maybe you could come to my house and be rat catcher.
Shove his ass up on the attic. See if you can get it work his way out of the trap. The tender trap. I think he already got married to the tender trap. That chinless bitch.

My life and local this is 4405 city.
The biggest baddest point is rocker of all time that he's not taking any prisoners.
He's Axel Schwarzenegger.
Welcome to the jungle.
He got fun and games.
He got everything you've got to be loyal all the hell.
Axel Schwarzenegger.
He's all pumped up and ready to rock.
Take me down to Paradise City as a glasses screen as the girls are pretty or as stick a grenade launcher for the sun bomb shine.
It's military industrial strength rock and roll the way only Axel Schwarzenegger can tell it.
The urban aglimator, a John Claude bandam is a f***ing thief.
Steven Cigard is a f***ing kid with a ponytail.
The only reason I did a film with DeVito is because he could smite standing up.
It's Axel Schwarzenegger exclusively on Terminator CD's record in the sense.
If you don't buy this album, I'll bid back.
What a bad thought that is.
1117 at 560 WQM.
Ruth Buzzy is on passion.
She's the nurse.
I mentioned that yesterday but like in the middle of all that crap.
I just want to mention again that is Ruth Buzzy.
She's a hoot.
You don't remember Ruth Buzzy from my picture?
I did.
And other things.
Yes.
Like what?
Uh, stuff.
Authorities speaking of stuff as in stuff at somewhere.
This kid, they ought to slice his balls off.
Write a national TV.
No need.
That had done John Walsh.
Authorities to arrest teen and internet blast to attack.
All you punk asshole kids out there who think you're a bunch of wise guys.
Dicking around, you know, hacking in this computer and hacking in that.
Hacking this, okay?
Hacking the wife.
Like OJ.
Virus writers.
Yeah, you virus spreaders.
Man.
Makes that sars crap.
He'll let it away and get our freaking life.
Go get laid.
Discover your pubes, okay?
Go get a life.
And of course these are the kind of kids who can't get laid.
Right.
It wouldn't surprise me if one of these days you're going to come in here and there'll be like viruses all over the whole damn building computer system started by clearance.
You know, to get a...
Everyone I say?
Yeah, I know.
Because he can't get laid.
Even Duff turned him down this morning.
The first step in getting laid is to step away from the computer and leave the house.
No, they think the first step in getting laid is going online.
There's chat rooms.
Chatnet.
You know, with Gertrude, his real name is probably Richard.
Right.
Well, it's worked for some people.
Anyway, US cyber investigators have identified a teenager's one author of a damaging virus-like infection,
at least weeks ago, on the internet and planned to arrest him early today.
Maybe they already got him in custody.
You think I hope so?
I hope they just chop his penis off and they can find one.
The 18-year-old was accused of writing a version of the damaging blaster computer infection
that spread quickly across the net.
The official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, the official asked that further by identifying information about the teenager
not to be disclosed to the arrest.
Further details expected to be disclosed today by the FBI, US Attorney's Office in Seattle.
He spoke for the US Attorney's office there.
John Hartting said there have been no arrest made.
They're not saying yet.
Collectively, different versions of the virus-like worm.
Alternatively, Claude Love Sand or Blaster snouled corporate networks worldwide, forcing Maryland's motor vehicle agency to close for one day.
The infection-inundated networks infrusted at home users.
Simon, to a core-pleading anti-virus vendor, said the warman had variants infected more than a half a million computers worldwide.
Experts consider one of the worst outbreaks this year.
For that, this kid, I think we just timed to a goddamn telephone pool and let everybody whose computer was dicked up by his virus come along and with a baseball bat and just beat the crap out of him until there's nothing left.
Right?
Like in Casino, just keeping the depth of clubs and bats.
I like to come up with one of those real sharp cutters.
Like in all, not in all, all is like Pierce.
Like in Fulaynife.
It would never be good.
Like one of those knives that Jeff Tony sells on the infomercials.
Right.
One of those real paper thinned with slices of your balls right off.
Yeah, I'm even worse than against tonight.
In fact, what we'll really do is we'll just have Jeff Tony stand there, giving dirty looks for hours.
That's the kind of punishment this punk deserves.
By the way, Jeff Tony, lose some weight.
You're fat, little tub.
You little round man.
You know, it's one thing to be fat, which I've been for a long time, but it's another thing to be a round man.
You know what I mean?
Like the beast.
Beasts is a round man.
Short fat.
Short fat like Chef Tony.
It's what?
A bad combo.
Oh, it is really bad.
Also, speaking of the internet and a lot of hanky-panky going on.
Revealed how the RIA tracks down loaders.
The recording industry is providing its most detailed glimpse in the some of the detective style techniques that's employed as part of its secretive campaign against online music swappers.
Most of whom are doing poppers.
The beslowsers were included in court papers.
Do uh, straight guys do poppers?
That like locker room, uh, that stuff that you see in the night.
Amonite trade.
No.
I bet you there's some straight guys in the office, mostly faggots.
Now, why is that?
Don't know.
Ask beener, boy.
He'll tell you.
He's got some better stuff.
The beslowsers were included in court papers filed against a Brooklyn woman fighting efforts to identify her for allegedly sharing nearly a thousand songs over the internet.
The recording industry, the dispute at her defense that songs on her family's computer were from compact this she had legally purchased.
Right.
According to the documents, the RIA examined song files on the woman's computer and traced their digital fingerprints back to the former Napster file sharing service which shut down in 2001 after court ruled it violated copyright laws.
The RIA, the trade group for the largest record label said it also found other evidence inside the woman's music files,
suggesting the songs are recorded by other people and distributed across the internet, the wicked wicked internet.
Comparing the Brooklyn woman to a shoplifter, like what's her name?
Winno, Winno, Winno writer.
The RIA told US magistrate John M. Fatsiola that she was not an innocent or accidental infringer and described her lawyer claims otherwise as shockingly misleading.
The woman's lawyer, Daniel Ann Ballard, in Sacramento, California said the music industry's latest argument was merely a smoke screen to divert attention from a related issue of whether her internet provider, Verizon Internet Services, Inc. must turn over her identity under a copyright subpoena.
You cannot bypass people's constitution rights to privacy due process and anonymous association to identify and lage infringer Ballard said.
And it goes on.
Now here's the facts from one of our regular facts who's really slipping today. Bad move, okay? Very bad. Very unfortunate.
I realize there's a lot of pressure on. It's a big, labor day holiday weekend. Heracones beat up on a girls' team last night. There's enormous pressure on.
But the semi-indiotic facts like this when we're taking one of our very scientific, high-faluten polls today is unacceptable as what it is.
And I sure wish I wouldn't have eaten that grilled cheese. It was very good.
That's another thing it's going to save my life to be in order. Here's not all that. How he's isn't going to be sitting there.
They had a little bit of bacon today. You notice they didn't eat too much of that. Even though they had 40 pounds of it again.
But since there were about 75 sandwich grilled cheese in it with Zach's name on it, I figured I'd do him a favor. I'd steal one.
That was the Zach Stack, I've said.
The Zach Stack, yeah. What a pig you are, man. No, seriously. If his family could see the amount of food in there with his name on it.
There's like a hundred pounds of food sitting in a gigantic cardboard box. How many pounds have Zach's name on it?
Thirty pounds of food. And he's talking about diets. And you know, he's another fat slob like me.
But at least I admit it. I'm not putting on any act. I'm a fat slob who can't resist, especially grilled cheese sandwich.
Buttery, bacon and butter. That was good. And of course the butter makes everything slide out like, yeah, you're going to need some long bits in that one o'clock hour, I think.
Why is that? No, no, this wasn't one of those. This didn't have all the butter on it. Have you never had how his grilled cheese? No, as a matter of fact.
I think there's one in here from like the last two that I know that to be really right going out. In fact, it's growing its own cheese on the outside. It's a double cheese.
It's got original American cheese on the inside and the own newly fermented cheese on the outside.
Anyway, this fact is so idiotic. It says you have to include along with Rick Sanchez, the other two disasters on the NL on watchable channel six.
Jose Diaz Balar and Jackie Nisbrow. See, this David, and this is one of our regular nut the chronic David, but another one.
You didn't read the question. Granted, those people are annoying. Granted, they suck on a year, but they don't engender.
Even Angela Reyes, horrendous and embarrassing as she is on a year. She doesn't engender hate. See the difference, David? Are you getting it? No.
I didn't think so. Who do you think is or was the most disliked media person in South Florida? Now with Jackie Nisbrow or Jose Diaz Balar,
or any of the other 600 Diaz Balar's fallen on a category? No. Of course not. I know someone who does that we love Duff.
Yeah. Belkies. Spelkeys Nere? Yeah. I hate it.
Okay, well let's get around there. Right away, Belkies Nere. That's B-E-L-K-Y-S. Nere, I got no idea how he's fallen.
No one makes me proud of Nere. And E-R-E, I don't know. What? I don't know.
Al Nere, he was in the Godfather. I really reached for the remote faster than anything else that can come on my TV.
She gives me spulkeys. Old Belkies. Eyeball surgery doesn't make me reach for the remote faster.
Belkies Nere. I think Eric knows how to spell it. If not, you hammer it out with him. Hammer it out with a hammer.
Because I have no idea how to spell it. But she definitely deserves it to be on her.
Because a lot of people not only find her annoying on her, but they can't stand her. They hate her.
They just...
N-E-R-E-Y. N-E-R-E-Y. Belkies, B-E-L-K-Y-S. N-E-R-E-Y. Belkies Nere. Or as we call her in their little Italy, spulkeys Nere.
Thank you, Miguel, who was at the Hooters' Lot now.
Is he really? Yes. Well, I'll be goddamn.
Are going to raise a lot more than 60 bucks. Now, where's that shitty game, huh? I'm wearing it.
No, sir, where the hell is it? He gave me the sheet.
I got a copy. That's no fear. I got to find mine. It'll kill a lot more time.
Southeast quarter of Pines and University. Just a minute now. I got to find mine. Okay, I want my sheet.
What heck I'd die, doesn't that ashamed?
The guy that played...
Cheswick died. You know that. They all do.
What did I do with the sheet that Miguel gave me? I mean, this is bad. There it is.
See, it's important that I find this.
Hooters' Park a lot. That's where you'll find the love of the Miguel right now.
In a QM van, of course. On the Southeast quarter of Pines and University.
Now, when he says on the Southeast quarter, oh, the Hooters Park not okay.
And you can get your best of the all, good stuff. And also, maybe he's got a few of those old mad dog key chains.
And definitely the new Mohawar David of Keychain. Right.
Just be careful. You don't catch nothing.
And the best in the LCD is this 2002 and 2003 and all these good things. And some 2001 hangovers.
Speaking of hangovers, how's Brian Greacy doing?
27 pound and over your Georgia to I'll give that later. Too many year long promos on here.
We got important business to take here. Like gambling business. I have to laugh my ass off.

Homophobia. We're just living life. The way we want to.
It's come on. Yeah. And that is all what people say.
Well, nasty nasty things they do. It's come on. Yeah. And that is all. It's just something they they can't approve.
Play me. Scream is dressed up all in dry. It's so sad.
The other ones that make us all look bad. Also bad. We're just living life. The way we want to.
Yeah. And that is all. If what they say those nasty things they do. It's because I'm gay. And that is all.
But it could be so hard inside you. Oh, yes. So so hot inside you.
And that player's communication chief was I over 75 that bombing in the office morning.
Including that big. How do you like that? We don't care about them anyway.
Including the big Shiite Mula Bulla. They're all screaming. Ah, Shiite over there to pretty upset about it.
So the insanity continues. It just goes on and on. And then you get a fax like this.
You just want to throw up your arms and say what? You know, who gives a crap? Fill in mudgate. Who's a chronic faxer?
And I shouldn't own a long time ago. Fill needs mental help. Wait till you hear this. This this will make you cry.
It'll make you want to cry. Neil, stop being such a hard ass about Arnold.
He isn't a bit crusty in his choice of words, IE stuff. But I believe he is sincere about his intentions to bring fair government to California.
He is for social programs which pisses off all the Republicans. Some believe he can convert some of the right wingers to a more moderate, kinder gentler fascism.
And by the way, Neil, not all Nazis were evil. Most were propaganda victims as most of the flag waivers in American society are today.
Besides it was Arnold's father, not Arnold himself, who was the card-caring member.
And then he goes down with the thing here about bashing Bush, which is fine. But I mean, is this pathetic?
Talk about getting sucked into a bunch of stupid crap? Oh, yes, he's got his positions on the social issues.
Haven't thought about affirmative action yet or about Proposition 52, or Club 54.
I told you to make it like we could be. I'm glad I'm sitting there.
Right, this is how it is. Fill in mug gate, you better rethink your position.
Okay, I think you belong in a prone position. Maybe you are in the prone position. Maybe you got into a bad bowl of grits and it gave you the schmitz or something.
Okay, because this faci just sent me this enough to bring a tear to my fly. It's enough to make my roids start boiling again.
Or maybe it was that grilled cheese sandwich.
I mean, stop and think about this. Okay? Anybody? Anybody? Some schmuck down the corner can say.
Finish, okay? I'm talking to her. Okay. I don't know what they're talking about, but I have no memory of any of the articles.
No, I don't remember the, of any of the articles about all that for land-bearing I was doing and about all this screw in this one and that one and all of that.
Because I wasn't planning on their life in politics and being governor of California.
What kind of an answer is that? What kind of a horseball answer is that to the question? What does he bring to the table besides a big name?
And a white would have to. Remember a horse with no name? He's got a wife with no chin.
Name? Money? That's all you need anymore. Right. Name and money. And that's absolutely nothing else.
Well, he's for so unassociated issues. What does that mean? Well, you could find Joe Smith down the street corner. He can give you a 10 questions and he can answer all 10 away that you agree with.
Does that make him qualified to run for office? Where do we dog catch her? Of course not.
I'm for happy. Some of you people are so goddamn stupid. It makes like I said my hemorrhoids bleed all over his chair. Looks like the Randy Rhodes chair right now.
I was just bleeding over here. You bloody idiots. What else wrong with you, man? Oh, God. Thank God for Canada where the average IQ is at least a little bit larger than the average penis size. Christ almighty.
And this crap I get. I'm not even going to dignify this facts. I got from this X fan. JJ blow it out your ass. Bye, bye, Jay. And he's go out there. Check ass.
Give me a song of the dance about the Iraqi terrorists who are going to blow up a some wall with my mother shopping in it. Oh, let me know when that's going to happen.
And Iraqi terrorists know it seems to me that 15 of the 19 terrorists that I'm 11 were Saudi Arabians, you know, the Saudis who are good close personal buddies with your friend George W and his family.
And somebody just facts me just moments ago, Saudi Arabia is $30 billion bonus from oil revenues. Right.
Things get better and better for Saudi Arabia. Oil prices may average 27 bucks a barrel this year due to the failure of the US to restore pre-war production levels in Iraq.
Predicts the national commercial back insolence, but I'm going to tell you we are going to take it so deep up the old hole.
What is the Iraqi thing forget about the loss of life if you can. I mean we shouldn't but just setting aside the financial hit that we're going to take.
And is it for any reason? No. No. Other than absolute total of confidence all based on a pack of lies by a bunch of lunatics like Richard Pearl and Paul Wolfowitz and all of these and Rumsfeld.
All of these far business going and whatever else they might be. And Jews. It's it's it's pathetic.
They could hold a special one hour broadcast and make it mandatory viewing in all of America coast to coast tonight and come on a year and be honest and say we lied to you.
We had ulterior motives. This is what it was really all about and you know what the public in the poll would say well 51% still support the president.
It would make any difference. That's how mindless and how numb the American public is numb and dumb. Remember that movie number and dumber? Yeah. God.
Now speaking of our poll, we'll get to your calls. I see a lot of lines frantically. I will get there. We got to take our time because Duffinsist that we go all the way to two with this crap instead of having a nice one or two hour comedy bits, which be a nice easy way to you know ease into the holiday weekend.
It would be very pleasant, but that doesn't want to make life pleasant for us, which is why he also wants to scratch out my day off. Thanks Wednesday, which Greg was probably giving me that day off just as a way of token of thanking me for continuing to be number one and being the cash cow bonus bonus.
The cash cow of this radio station right every scene with LC the board and proud together. I see your utter. Yeah. That's what you think.
193 votes. And by the way, you know, one thing about being a fag is you don't have to have a big penis to satisfy your woman. You don't know if you're straight either.
I had a fabulous line. 194 votes, but this isn't the for real show. Okay, with a big package. We're just keeping a nice and clean with that real clean family. A whole cement entertainment like Motalks about that we're still waiting to hear.
194 votes. Who do you think is or was the most dislike media person? So we apologize to mo because it's a very boring poll, even though he's on it though. So I guess someone see the poll the other day was boring because he was not at the dead people.
Oh, maybe he will be soon. Anyway, Rick Stanch has a hundred out of 194, 194 already not bad. In fact, when the hell did I read the first poll like about 1045? Yeah, 1040.
Mojaro David at 54. He's only a little more than half of what recentches is God. You just can't hold a candle or Rick. I'll take that.
Hank Goldberg 13. George Rodriguez 12. Neil Rogers 10. You got me beat by a pair. Greg Budele 4 and Spilke's Nere is only got one. Only one. What's like at home? You are pretty impractic about that. Spilke's Nere. Nobody likes her. Yeah, but again, keep her. Keep in mind. It's a contest. Right. It's her against these.
It's other more prominent, more dislikable people. And you know, Rick Stanch has is going to win hands down his pants. He is just in fact, even if we were to just take it out the word media and just said the most dislike person.
We could put Joe Carrollo on there and the mayor, Pinga, Pacania and all kinds of evil people Hitler like my mother evil people. My mother, your mother too, your mama.
And he's still he's still would have had no problem. He would have beat him hands down. Ricky Ticky Sanchez. They hate you Rick. And by the way, think about it again. Don't come back.
Don't come back.
Rick is what they usually call it. Well, Rick, you you're making me so damn horny. So damn horny right now. Well, good. That's a good sign. How did you feel when you found out you were going to be alone with me today?
Thank you, God. That was really happy. You're not the girl. We kind of just leave me hanging now. Are you not me? No. So you don't mind if I put my hand here right?
They told me before I came in here. You were going to ask me that. So all right.
Whoa, whoops. I'll spill a little there. A little premature presidential evacuation. It's all over. Yeah, I'll love everywhere.
Well, you all make use of the pretty little mouth of yours and clean this mess up. Oh, yeah. I mean, I have to do it. I have to just lick it up.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So delicate. Got that right.
Britney's just focused. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Britney, baby. Well, we, uh, we continue this a little later. Just, uh, I, uh, I gotta take care of something. Uh, yeah, that's it.
Oh, definitely not anytime soon, but yes.
I'll tell you one more thing. The reason I played that I'm very sorry that I did. You know, I never played that because that's the worst Clinton voice they've ever done on that service.
But because Britney and Madonna last night at the MTV music video award show exchange a little pick on the lip and MTV.
I mean, CNN just since 11 30. You know how many times they've shown that?
About 30, man. Yeah. Just since 11 30 over and over and over and over again. Now Britney has unfortunately in the eyes of many head of her social guys dropped several notches since seeing that because in the case of Madonna,
can you even forgetting about Dennis Rodman if you possibly can? Can you even imagine where those lips have been and what they've touched what that tongue has.
Oh, what that tongue has. Yeah, brought. God, that's rotting. All right. Has rot.
So the fact that Britney actually made like a little bit of lip contact there. Nauseating and disgusting. Not quite as disgusting.
That was the fact that Justin Tinkerbell. I see got an award on there and as soon as that kiss their place, who are they showing any audience?
There's the little Justin Tinkerbell, that little fruitcake, that little screaming, flaming fairy, Justin Tinkerbell. Well, we didn't have facts. We had to. Yeah, right. Sure you did.
That's what he's calling it. So I think I think maybe there's a chance maybe since we know Madonna goes all three ways. Maybe Britney also was a dyke, which I think was.
Oh, yes. That's where it's at man today. Nice to be us. That's what it's all about. Back in 10 minutes.
How many times are we going to see that this hour? Right after Leon Harris tells us about Kirby Puckett.
Here's a ridiculous facts one of the worst of all time. But the facts are really pouring in. Well, first here's this one. This is good. It's a spielke's Nure looks like an anorexic drug addicted homeless man.
That could be the best facts we've had this year. Thank you. Nailed it. Spielke's Nure looks like an anorexic drug addicted homeless man.
Absolutely correct. She might be a god nuts. No, he would shake and had that neck. Yeah. Zoli in North Miami. Here's the fact that just almost as bad as Phil and Muggate, who's got a big Arnold blow up dial in California.
It says Neil is a lawyer. Listen, right? I'd like to give you some words of advice. I love it when you're here and talk. Well, I sure don't talk about stuff that's going on around you.
But I must say that your best shows are when you are broad. Yeah, I haven't even put the dress on yet. I know your best shows are when you're a man when you're abroad.
I love your take on politics and religion. I agree with almost everything you say except maybe some of your music tastes. Here's my suggestion though. We as listeners want to also hear about stuff in your life. Talk about Canada and Amsterdam and your experiences.
I love it when you mention stuff about your dogs, strapping on your carpet. Do I have dogs in Amsterdam or Toronto? No. No. Or are you farting in the shower? Do I have to be in Canada to fart in the shower? No. No. That's good radio. I guarantee you, that's what it says. That's good radio farting in the shower. I'll pass. Although I do fart in the shower more here than I do up there because of the horrible food I eat here.
I guarantee if you think a poll to winning vote would be to hear more about the adventures of Neil Rogers, it helps us to relate to our God better. Along with bedtime stories in the ever popular ripping of your QAM cronies. Also, how about more gay talk? You seem to avoid mispelled, avoid gay issues. Why is that gay issues like what?
Oh, I know that you're not a subhating fag. So what's the deal? The deal is this isn't a fag show, Zoli. Butch up sweetheart. That's all Uncle Neil. Don't take this the wrong way. I'm not telling you what to do. Just suggesting fun stuff. Right, like farting in the shower. Well, I'll tell you what, when I get home the staff know and I hop into a hot shower and see if I can rip off a few good ones for you. Okay. I'll record it and play it on Tuesday. We'll take somebody with you so you can talk about gay fun stuff. Yeah, farting in the shower. Right.
There you go. A group, a group gay shower fart. Here's another fact that says when it comes to the great massive American is just waving off the looting perpetrated by Bush and company. I reminded of Eli Wallace character in the magnificent seven. We played a Mexican Bandito. See, I like the part where he sang.
When I said when I could plan his own people so viciously he responded if God hadn't meant for them to be sheared, he wouldn't have made them sheep. That in the nutshell, I think is the credo for this gang of hoodlums have just taken over our country. And most Americans are just too stupid to care.
Absolutely correct. Conservatives and others, including yourself back to the KAT days have complained loudly for over 30 years about the decaying American educational system. Well, they were right.
Now we have the proof in the pudding is they used to say very, very sad. Speaking of sad, did you see this report last month about Saudi Arabia? I just got to that about the oil money 27,000 in small potatoes.
The Bush family and the house of saw the house of cards of falling deck of cards. Here's a fact from Warren who says now I know the significance of the beast. Tell Moe better watch out. Better watch his back.
It says the mark of the beast warning to all and of course it's got the obligatory six six six these are six is on it. God is for warn us of a time when the man of sin a superhuman dictator known as the beast will be given power over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell on the earth shall worship him except the saints.
And he caused it all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive his mark number or name in order to work by or sell.
In other words, if you shave Moe's ass, you find a lot of dingal buries the mark of the beast right. And no, that's on clearances as he left the mark.
As a snare shall come on all the echoes on all this crap is silly biblical garbage written by a bunch of silly idiotic superstitious morons thousands of years ago who didn't know up from down or in from out.
No, they didn't know in and out. It's about all I knew. Just like the animals. Rick Sanchez, 116 votes. Who do you think is the most just like media person in South Florida?
Rick Sanchez, 116. Mohawar, David, and 59. That's like almost double.
He's got one more vote than just half. Moe.
And then it's small potatoes. We're small. Georgia Rodriguez, 14. The Humper and Goldberg, 14. You're as truly 11.
Greg B. L4 and Spilky's Narein, with four out of 200 out of 222. We're a third of the way there. We're a third of the way to the beast.
222 with Karen of Valentine. Was she on that room? 222? Yes. She was kind of annoying. Bokobrag likes her a lot.
She reminds me. I think she's the same person as Valerie Burton. Ellie. Aren't they the same? I don't know. It's the same person I believe.
Reincarnated. What about Catherine Ross? She was kind of cute. I like Catherine Ross. Yeah, she was cute.
Wouldn't she in movies with some of those fags like Rob Lowe and some, oh, by the way, speaking of Rob Lowe, wow. There is a God. There is.
Oh, God. Because have you seen the promos for whatever that horrible new show is that he's on? No. He looks about 80.
And I mean, I just up with you. I mean a bad 80. So for somebody who was such a real, real pretty boy when he was younger.
I mean, he was already man. He'll pretty. Oh, yeah. I bet it had a lot of you action. But he is a badly.
He's a lot of makeup on. But he looks horrible. I mean, he's got the face falling apart thing.
You know, his right cheek is where his eyebrow used to be. It's not good. Good. Exactly. I'm delighted.
I'm getting sick and tired of all these hot looking guys. You know, and sooner or later it catches up with him.
And he's still looking like crap. We got some of these pre stories we'll get to. 180.
180 what? Oh, one of that's good. That means we already beat the 60 from Joe and Mark. Thank God.
That could be one of the most embarrassing things I've ever heard in my life. We have 17,100 bucks for a band in Pet Rescue.
And don't forget Miguel is still there and the QM van who does parking lot. Southeast corner of Pines and University. How long is he going to be there?
It will be nice to know. I don't know. Till he feels like it. Just like the time that he showed up.
Right. Remember when he gets there. And he leaves.
He leaves when he leaves is when he's begun. I think the Joe and Mark thing maybe had something to do with the fact that there was no one on the earth at the time pumping their presence while it was going on.
Pumping it up. Maybe we need to pump up the appearance in California.
It just seriously. When just when you think you've seen it hurt at all, when nothing can, when nothing can phase you any more.
And I'm sure we're not done. And all of a sudden here comes this madness, this insanity.
And we have people like Phil and Mudgate and others like George Schultz who of course for political reasons because the Republican party wants to steal control of the state of California just like they still control of the White House with this fixed election in this state.
Just like Tom Delay is trying to redistrict the entire world to make all Republicans even like in the Netherlands.
But you know, and we got people say, oh yeah, Arnold is good. He'd be a good one. He'd be great. A good what? A good what asshole?
Some of those bodybuilders probably thought he had a good asshole.
It's 11.56. Four minutes before. What are we doing here? Did I screw something up? I don't know because I keep throwing these pages away and throwing these pages away and trying to shut that fucking thing.
We're supporting you five six. You a yeah.
The state Goldstein but you can call me Galdi. Whenever I'm in town I listen to, wait a minute I am in town. It's the 12 to 1 hour.
Die!
She won't go down. When it is up again, you're never gonna keep the town. She won't go down.
When it is up again, you're never gonna keep the town. She won't go down.
When it is up again, you're never gonna keep the town.
Kissing is fancy day. With yourself you must make.
He's trying to whisk the drink. He's trying to block the drink. Need it hard to drink to get a rent to cake. He tells us that it really makes him feel good.
He tells him that what the hell is over to get bored?
There's no way boy. No way boy. I'd enjoy.
She won't go down. When it is up again, you're never gonna keep the town. She won't go down.
When it is up again, you're never gonna keep the town. She won't go down.
When it is up again, you're never gonna keep the town.
It's a 12 to 560. I've never wanted to hear it again. I can't stand it.
The only good thing was 100 years gone by. That voice just drives me nuts.
Anyway, we have 245 votes on the pool. We may actually go all the way to the pool. We're gonna tough it out. What do you think?
What do you care? You don't have to do anything.
You're right. That's what I always do.
I still have a fair amount of energy.
It's like being in training. You have to pump it up a little bit.
Pump it up. In California.
Phil and Mugget, get yourself some mental health before it's too late. You silly goose. You silly person.
What is wrong with you, man?
He wants to do good things for California.
Yeah, that sounds pretty heavy, duty. That sounds like a very complex.
How about the budget deficit? Well, we're still looking at that. We're still coming up with ideas.
What about affirmative action? Well, we haven't looked at that yet. What about Proposition 52?
We don't really familiar with that yet.
It doesn't like immigrants. It's gonna be on the same ballot, by the way.
Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be on the same ballot, which is really an anti-affirmative action thing.
But he don't know from it yet.
It's gonna be on the same ballot.
What?
As the recall.
Yeah, in California.
5670560. Let's start taking a whole bunch of calls here now and see if we can really make it till two o'clock.
We got a lot of heavy to get these pre-stories here yet.
We got information up the ass is what we've got here at QA.
Let's see that schedule, man. You got Joe Rosentoo again.
Mad Dog, he works about like once every few shows, you know.
You got the Humper back.
Now we're not back in town to back on the air from Vegas, 4-7 this afternoon.
You got Marlins on deck. Marlins are home. Big homestand, by the way.
This is it. You got five teams tied for the National League Wildcard.
Five. Flatfooted tie.
And it's amazing because the Marlins and the Phillies between the two of them, they have lost so many games in a row.
I mean, the Marlins go in a nine game road trip, they lose eight, including Don Trello who's lost it, but at any rate.
Exposed at the Marlins, the Exposed who are one of those five teams are a hot of any Pistola who play half of their games in Puerto Rico because nobody wants them.
Nobody wants anything to do with them.
And then you got 80k follows the baseball game and ESPN radio overnight because Joe and Mark only raised 80 bucks yesterday and their appearance.
And they're being phased out.
80 bucks. That to me is just...
It's unconscionable. It's shy or...
Was it 60 bucks?
Here are our guys at Grantue. They're on a year overnight. They have a limited audience. Everybody is sloughing at that hour the night.
But they go out there and granted there was nobody on there promoting it at that hour because we were in all that Dolphin 40-hour pregame.
But nevertheless, did not plug the hell out of ES today as much as I could and they raised 60 bucks.
Would you be ashamed and humiliated?
Me? No.
Was that Miguel or was that like an improved drug dealer?
None of the above. Did you see me smile?
What does that mean?
If it had a drug dealer or dancing, you know.
Okay, 5607.0560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. Let's get this thing going. WQIM.
Hey, are you doing well?
Pretty good.
Hey, listen, I got to ask you something. What do you start with this thing, juice?
You know, your promo for the gambling has juice in it.
Yeah.
Then I watch an MTV last night, you know, some of that award show.
And then a big commercial comes up with juice.
Juice.
Juice.
Yeah.
I'm amazed. I mean, looking if you started, a trend of juice.
Well, I'll tell you who started it.
Oh, man.
The juice.
All right, but it's all you, man.
Okay, you can.
Yeah, Sarah started it.
I wish I had that CD in here, but I don't.
It'll be good when I'm back home next week.
Oh, that's a CD.
Have you heard?
That's what I'm playing stuff on.
Oh, I have all of my stuff right there in the DCS up there that's loaded with all kinds of good stuff.
As opposed to this one, which may be equally loaded, but with a lot of crap,
which haven't played a lot of it so far today.
Stuff that you don't ever want to hear again, including that one Clinton and the Brittany.
That's awful.
Really bad.
That is really terrible.
Excuse me for playing that.
I apologize.
I'll never heard again.
In fact, the first thing I do when I get back there is I'm going to delete that from my DCS up there.
Okay.
When in doubt, I'm yanking it out.
132 votes for Rick Sanchez, 70 for Mohawar David.
Who do you think is the most or was the most dislike media person in South Florida?
This is the kind of poll South Florida loves.
And the people are going to say, well, there's Neil being negative again.
I'm not being negative.
We're just having a little bit of fun and taking a little shot, you know?
That's what South Florida likes.
Being nasty and mean, spirited and hateful, taking a cheap shot.
And especially when we put ourselves in there, how can you not that?
We're not thin skinned.
Like some people I can think of.
I don't want to mention no names.
We're not thin skinned enough tight calling in all the time.
Absolutely.
Right, Mo.
Rick Sanchez, 132, Mohs got 70.
Not even, no contest, Mo.
George 17, Hank 17, I got 14.
Philke's the race seven and Greg P. Delzone got four.
And you want to know why Greg has nobody remembers who the hell you are.
If they did, you'd be leading.
I remember those billboards that said, don't you hate this man?
Because even if you don't, he thinks you do.
He was reclining.
He could be the most paranoid human being ever ever met in my life.
Everybody hates me.
Yeah, well, that's true.
The good thing now is though, he's been away so long.
Most people don't remember who he was.
They don't remember those glorious days when he was waiting on tables at the sterling country kitchen.
Right near Mommy's house.
By the way, Mo, your behavior yesterday, unacceptable.
Chi Chi is unacceptable, my mother.
Why do they do that?
New herrings, mullems.
Are they all like that?
I don't know if they all are.
My mother could find fault.
There is nothing that has ever been invented.
Nothing that could ever happen.
Nothing that I have ever done that she couldn't find fault with.
She is the most negative, the most nagging, the most hostile person that ever came.
She makes your mother seem like...
I beg to different.
Like Sandy Claus.
My mother is pure evil.
The hostile evil is the word pure evil.
Evil is the word of the God selling a message for my mother and your mother.
Those people are evil.
Say, there you go.
The two seas.
Complain.
I know what's the answer.
Guys, I'll see you next time.
I'm on the big three.
Yeah.
Criticize and complain.
Why do they have to do either?
Both.
Then they do both.
It's a hobby. It's a way of life.
It's not a hobby.
It's a way of life.
We just shut up and we would have you shut up.
We would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you
shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have
We would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would be
We would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up and we would have you shut up.
So how would I feel when I, when I, when I, when I, because I would rather call myself an otherwise container.
right now Charlie is offering you an unbeatable deal. He is offering you his summer special
hair system for just 549 bucks for first time customers. If you already have a piece,
you can say 50% on service and repair of all kinds of hair systems, including shampoo
and trim. In fact, Bob Eisenberg, who is one of our really umptious sales holes, was
in here this morning. We used to laugh at Bob to his face and behind his back because he
used to have a mousey muskrat on his head, a real, real red one. Looks like a silly goose.
And then we said, hey, how about going to Charles Zelfier and at least looking halfway decent.

I like women. I mean, I love women. But sometimes I can't find a woman who likes me. That's
why I'm glad there's a drive up jack in the box at my neighborhood.
The new jack in the box sperm bank. Perfect for the guy who can't find a woman when he needs
one.
Oh, that's the wrong jack in the box, you know. But that was kind of amusing. I mean, I
just got a file. I get it about a little bit.
Oh, about that one. Yeah. This is the one I was hoping for.
Hey, how the hell are you? Welcome to Jack in the box. I'm Jack. Can I be happy to fill
your order if you know what I mean? I'd like a Jack burger and a large fries.
Sorry, pal. We're cleaning the grease fryer. We don't have any French fries today.
Okay. Uh, then just give me a small order of fries, please.
Look, chief. Maybe you didn't hear me. I said we don't have any f***ing fries today.
So how about something else? Okay, then just give me an order of fries.
Listen up, pal. Who put the straw and straw, Barry?
That you did, that's right. Nature did. Who put the apenate break up?
That's right. Nature did. Now listen carefully. Who put the freak in French fries?
There ain't no freak in French fries. That's what I've been trying to tell you. But
breath, there ain't no freak in French fries. Now get out of my sight before I shove your
teeth so far down your f***ing throat. You'll have to sit on the Jack burger to eat it.
Oh, and have a nice day. Thanks Jack. It's a 12 16. What the hell happened
all my spots? You know, I think somebody was in here interfering with my show and I was
trying to like put all this crap in order. Shame on you people. Okay. Shame on you.
Everything is like out of order and all screwed up in here. Don't forget Miguel is over
there at the Huda's parking lot in the QM van. Southeast quarter of Pines in University.
Go buy and pick up your best of the CDs and the Mohawar David and Keychain and he might
be there too. And some of the stuff from last year that's left over. Did he give you any
updates, any report? Not likely. Well, what does that mean? Is he going to give us a
departing time and E at T L? I'm sure. Okay. So go and see him and say hi. 5 6 7 0 5 60
on E at T and T and Verizon wireless line. Nobody Q I M. Ola. Nailed? Yes. Hi. How are you?
I'm good. How you doing? I'm really good. Well, that was a shock. I didn't know it was
screenless today. It's it's screenless Friday. How cool. I have a question. I hope I don't
sound like a like a giddy teenager here. Okay. Bear with me. But you sound like a giddy
teenager. So bear with me. I remember that you knew or know Johnny Depp and that he used
to come in to the studio. He came in once on Zeta. Yeah. Because let's see. 16 years ago.
I never thought twice about him really because I guess all his movies were a little out there.
Yeah. But over the summer I saw Pirates of the Caribbean. Right. I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed
him. I thought he was a great looking guy. He is a great looking guy. I haven't seen that
movie. But everybody says his performance was sensational. It's a blast. You know what?
It's it's a fun like escape. It's kind of movie. But if you just from knowing him, I think
you get a kick out of it. It's really it's worth saying. Right. I said, Oh, God. I got
a call me. I asked him, you know, what he was like. You know, he was just, you know, an
intense guy. Can I give you one word to describe what he was like? Oh, yeah. Okay. Todd. Yeah.
Man. I would say so. Wow. He was a nice kid. He was very friendly. He was a big fan
of the show. Of course he grew up in Miramar or Helen. They were, you know, those in that
part of the. And so how did he come to get onto your show? Did you where did you mean
him? Somebody set it up. He was in town with Greg Alman who unfortunately couldn't make
it because he was stoned off his ass. But and so somebody from some club or listen to
the show, they brought them in at like 6, 30 in the morning and he came on here for a
couple of hours and we took some pictures, which I wish I still had. And he was just
fun and a lot of kids called in and people and whatever. People he went to school with.
But but since that time, he's become such a big star. I'm sure he's forgotten about
all of us. Yeah. Was he doing like TV then that jump street show back then? I don't
know. In fact, you know something I forgot all about that show, 21 Jump Street. That
was a good show. I'd like to see it because I've never seen it like I sure would like
to jump to know I'll say it again. I just wanted to get your your input on him because
like I said, never thought twice about until I saw that movie went. Okay. We stood
in the hallway there at Zeta and the INZ building. We stood in the hall together and
took a picture of us with our arms around each other. You know, I had a he had a black leather
jacket on. It's a 16 years ago and see at that point, I should have just grabbed it. You
know what I'm saying? Oh man. I should just reach down there and just grab it and just
see what was like. No, those pictures would be nice to see now, right? You bet. Well,
have a very nice day. You too. Ever great weekend. You too. Bye. Johnny Depp, one of our
favorite people on this show. Don't be messing with Johnny. Okay. Who was great in
Ed Wood if you watched the first of 20 minutes. That's all you need to see. Eddie, help me,
Eddie. And it was kind of reminded me of some of the cause you used to get like at home.
George, help me, George. From my mom too. Now, I'm not talking about from your mom. I'm
talking about something a little bit closer to home here. People, somebody who used to
be on the floor right where you're sitting, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, po, what do you even have
been eating and eating and eating and eating? I got to get out of this place. No, seriously.
Like, this is worse. See, I used to get blamed for a lot of this stuff. And I love how
he's, but there's some kind of a sickness going on with his place. They don't bring in
like a little bit of food for everybody. They bring in like, like, tons. It's how evil people
order here by the pound. They don't just order a little bit of food. I have four pounds
today, guys. I have 16 pounds of food. I just get a sandwich that I have to bring. How
many pounds could he bring in for Scott? How many pounds of food would he like today?
Oh, about a hundred. How about George?
About third, man. Just a sandwich. That's all I get from them. Yeah. One a day. It seems
to me that there's maybe it's just my imagination. Well, I have to stop at some point. You know,
I take a look at the galaxy. Do we have an update or not? 200? 200. We have 180, like,
an hour ago. Well, he says it's slow. So hit it, pound it. What the hell is going on
out there? This, this is getting me really aggravated now. And he'll be there until,
whatever, until the crow flies a possess. 17,020. But we only have 200 bucks today over
there at the, and this is in brow or no less than Miguel is waiting with our best in the
merchandise. What? I don't think we're going till two busy intersection two. Yeah. There's
80,000,000 people in this town who are going by the intersection. There is no excuse for
people not to be buying their best in the merchandise today. They did what? 1,400 on the other
day, wherever it was, which we can't remember where it was. I did a lot of. And then to
unmarked it only 60 yesterday. I'm knocking them and they're only doing 200, which means
there's nobody listening. Duff hotel. I'm not going to sit here until two o'clock
try to talk to them. There's nobody listening. We have nobody. Well, that's why you need to do
that 1 o'clock hour to get them listening. Okay. I'll do it. I don't give a crap. I'm getting
out of here and I'm really excited about it. Miguel is in the QAM van. That's in the
Hooters parking lot on the corner of southeast to southeast corner of Pines and University
drives in very congested Broward. There is absolutely no excuse for you not to be the first
in your block to pick up your best in the LCDs and the very highly touted Mohawar David
of Keychain and some of the leftover mad dog mad at Keychains from last year and some of
the last year's CD era 2001 CDs. That's that's I thought he was off to a pretty good start
there for a while, right? These people need to be jump started. They need to be kicked in the
ES and plus there's nobody here anyway. Who's big English? WQ I am. Hello? Yes, sir. Oh,
Neil God. Oh, man. I was told that I even ran upstairs and wrote a fax but I forgot the
fax number. I was calling about the other day you were talking about the crazy religions.
Definitely my vote is with the born against but the Mormons are really out there and they got
throughout there. Oh, there's a book out now called Under the Banner of Heaven. It's a count
of these Mormon brothers who received this divine vision to kill each other's wives and kids.
Hmm. Now it's far out. Also you can ask George if he knows this new anal porn queen called
Belidonna. She's from a Mormon family. No, she's from a Mormon family. She's an anal porn queen.
Absolutely. What an ass. Do a web search. You'll find about her. Her name is Belidonna. She's like
the new hot young. She does everything. She's so dirty. I wonder she's done Britney yet. She ran
away from like the Mormon household that she was in and even seduced a young friend of hers.
Another girl to come with her and get into the porn industry. All right. Yeah, it's out there.
Aia, pole suggestion. Yes, sir. Because I was having a little discussion with my dad about
I think and I might want to get out of this crazy country and go to Canada and I was saying,
oh, it's so much better and there's only other better things and being a stoner. I couldn't call
the mind any of the good points I heard on your show. So pole suggestion is the best advantage of
Canada over United States. I'm going to give you right off the bat. It's not here. It's not
here right now. Away from W. Right. That's the best one. Have a great day, Palli. Thank you.
See you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Well, I give you like 70,000. The reason the people are polite and
friendly and the decriminalization of pot laws, the relaxation, which is coming up and the game
marriages and the everybody is left alone and being progressive and forward thinking and not
supporting the Iraq attack, things like these. Have it enough common sense to do these things.
Of course, we have some problems. We've got the bad meat now on the heels of the blackout and the
sars and the mad cow. Now we've got some tainted beef. Yeah, some bad meat. Anybody out there ever
get a hold of some bad meat? I have 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a 18. Ain't good for you. I'll
tell you that right now. I have to eat pills after that. Lots. Big ones. WQAM.
Take shots. Yes, sir. Hey, you were talking about chocolate yesterday.
About what? Chocolate. Chocolate. Oh, chocolate. I thought you were talking about it.
Shockly. No, no, no, no, I'm chocolate. Hey, while you're still down here, I don't know if
they have any phenomena. Have you ever been to Mrs. Fields? To what? Mrs. Fields.
Peppy Fields. No, Mrs. Fields. Mrs. Fields. Cookies? Yeah. What has she got to do with chocolate?
Everything. What do you mean by that? Well, they have double-fudge brownies there that I think
if you try those. Well, you know, at the Eden Center, which is a big shopping center,
the big mall in downtown Toronto, they have a Mrs. Fields right there. Well, do this.
Get to an order of double-fudge brownies. Take them home. Put them in the microwave. Maybe 15 seconds.
And then dip them in some Nestle-Turdly screen. Oh, well. And put them in a whole pile of dollop
of whipped cream on top when a cherry emerged. You know, a merisky no cherry. I'm telling you,
you try these brownies and then you let me know what you think. Okay, thanks a lot,
Peppellers, a brownie hound for you. I like Mrs. Fields. What? He's a brownie hound.
I'm not going to try that. I got to lose some weight, man. I got to lose that 35
elusive pounds. The elusive butterfly, huh? Yeah. I was doing pretty good the last couple of weeks
up there and then I came back here and right off the bat, you know, it's the same old crap.
Never stops. The cycle of death. The cycle of death sitting around watching TV and eating and
eating and sitting around watching TV sitting on my ass here. I haven't gotten up out of this
here since 10 o'clock. No, no, no, I'm just standing up for a second. Christ, I don't want to have
like another pulmonary embolism or something like that or some kind of a TIA or MIA like the president
wasn't the MIA. A wall. Yeah, he was a wall A wall A wall all of these things. That's his brain
that's MIA and common sense. 26 past noon at 560 WQM, but I don't I don't know what the hell's
going on here. I think what happened is I had a page of the log misplaced and I'm a lot like a
backass. We're here. I don't make any difference. So help me if Miguel don't get like at least
500 bucks out there. What the hell's the point even going? Right? This is the meat and potatoes of
our fundraisers is these van hits and that's why Miguel sacrificed bonding with the Doreen in here
today. He's sacrificed at least a couple of hours of having a chance to be close and personal
and sniff her essence. Spooned. Right. It took him out there in a van and sit there just boiling
his ass off and probably the on air condition QA and van waiting for you people to show up and
cut loose a few bucks for a band and pay rescue. What the hell is the story here today? God damn it.
What are you waiting for? Christmas, Shivowis, Sookas, Hanukkah? Let's go. Well, that's depressing.
200 bucks. He had 180 before you can say Joe and Marka suck. You know, I mean he had like wildfire

Hey. Do you like famous people? Do you like joining fan clubs? Do you have absolutely no sense of
human decency whatsoever? Then join the Scott Peterson fan club. Oh he's so funky. There's no way
he could be guilty. Of course not. That's why thousands of women are writing love letters to
Scott in prison hoping to become the next lucky Mrs. Peterson. I think I can change him.
But he doesn't need changing his soul. You. Well, you sound like the perfect candidate for the
Scott Peterson fan club. Sign up now and you'll get a Scott Peterson poster, a Scott Peterson
bumper sticker and a set of Scott Peterson trading cards. I'll trade you two scots with the
orange hair for one Scott New Orleans jumps to. No way. That's the most correctable one.

and letters from Scott himself. Look, I got a letter from Scott. He wants to marry me and take
me fishing on our honeymoon. He's so sweet. Plus, one lucky fan club member gets a chance to meet
Scott face to face. And behind it, two in stick reinforce glass window every third Wednesday between
the hours of one and one 15 p.m. Oh, I hope he has the orange hair that day. Yeah, that makes him look
so homicidal. Yes, you join the Scott Peterson fan club because you're almost as sick as he is.
Come 33 at 560 W. There's another good reason to be in Canada.
Unless you make a mistake of watching CNN or MSNBC, you won't hear one word about Scott Lacey Peterson.
Wow. And of course, we don't get Fox News. There's another good reason to be in Canada. We don't get Fox News.
Plus, we do get movie Ola and the scream TV and the driving movie channel. There's three more
to be in the world. We're going to start. Feds bust multi million dollar drug ring. Guess where this is taking place this
story in Miami. Details of a multi million dollar money laundering and drug smuggling business become
public today. But federal authorities disclose specifics about the two continent operation the US DEA said.
A news conference by the US Attorney's Office in Miami will provide information about the four year long
laundering operation of about 20 million, 13 million of which has been seized by federal authorities.
The other seven million will take and split up here. Primary transactions occurred between
Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Columbia, but the testicle stretched into several other US cities.
Cocaine was among the drugs involved. How do you like that?
Sources said 30 of 39 people have been indicted on custody. 12 are arrested in
Columbia where they seem to have some kind of a problem. Absolutely. Nine people weighed their
first court appearances yesterday in US District Court in Fort Lauderdale. Three more to appear today.
The sources say the arrested include some Columbia and suspects who were lured here to pick up drugs
or money as part of the investigation. One person was arrested in LA, three in New York, one in Chicago,
and at least one person in a very dangerous New Haven, Connecticut. The money was picked up at
various locations turned and was in turn wired by participants around the world in 80 days with Michael Todd.
Remember Mike Todd? No, you don't know. He was one of Elizabeth Taylor's 85 husbands. Did Miguel
call in with an update? There he is right there. If that's him, it says so.
Four for what? For this? For $100. Well, that's double what we had a minute ago. Right.
Now, now you got to admit, when I said that Miguel called in with an update when the E in update,
when that last letter of the board came out of the ring, the phone rang as I was speaking.
I am so damn good that it scares the crap out of me. 16, 920 and 400 is what? 17,320.
Well, at the very least, I want to get another 180 while his lovely asses out there today. Okay?
So get your ass out there. Let's do all the promos. That'll kill some good time because we are going
all the way to two just to make the offence clear and happy because I'm sure that they're feeling in
the back of the mind and probably in the middle of the front two. Well, those guys in there,
they're just really screwing off of those comedy, but anybody were paying him all of that money.
Anybody can sit there and play a bunch of cards and crap. You know, well, I got news for a
now you know that's what they're thinking. Sure, they don't have the balls to say that to me due to
my face even behind my back, but that's what they're thinking. Wait till you leave town. I screw
them. I don't care. I don't really care. I see what they do all day. Sit around making up schedules,
killing time, schmuzing going from room to room, you know, like pollinating like a guy damn honeybee.
Yeah, they're pollinating. Oh, well, I'm checking them with the rail now. Hey, Scott, how you doing? Okay,
you know, that's it. That's what they do. We have expensive, glorified babysitters is what we have.
Good guys. Not knocking it. That would be bad. So anyway, Miguel is in the hooters parking lot on
the South-Aid corner of Pines and University drives in Broward and prestigious with our best
and the merchandise and you're going to want to pick up that Mohawar David key chain.
That'd be funny. Yeah. And especially if they have any of these left over, you're going to get those
as once those are gone. Forget about it. That'll be it. And are we we are going to work on this
for real one, right? We are working on it. Right. All right. See, I it hurts my throat just to try to do
that. I can do it today because I was at that concert last night. Oh, yeah. Why don't you tell the story
about the episode you had at the concert with the Ruins? People are assholes. We had great people in our
great people in our session. Cities, cities of pop into the night. Yeah, Titties in your section. Oh,
yeah. Not even connected. Just Titties flopping around. Just loose. And which is good because I was
there with my teenage daughter. So she got a good education about how to behave at a concert
when she's 18. Yeah, let's hope. How old is your daughter now? 15? Very good. She ended up 15.
So, Renault's 15. I mean, she's dating now. So we had a fun day now. Yeah. No, no, no,
nobody wants to hear about the concert. They want to hear about your daughter and who she is. Such as it is.
Not dating individually like, you know, doing all somebody's picking her up and going on dating.
How do you know that? How do you know that they're in stuff going on at school like behind
or no one ever knows that. No one pulls up in a corner. She goes off. You know what I'm saying?
I'm the hallway. She's at home at night in the unit. She's in the room. Off places at night on the weekend.
She's a lovely little girl. She's not a little girl anymore. She's lovely young.
I love the name. Yeah. I didn't say much. Is she really? Yeah.
Taken after mama that way. Yeah. I know only in that way. Mama's eight feet tall by the way.
Yes. George comes up to work. But anyway. And these assholes wouldn't let us out.
Of our section we wanted to leave. Yeah. And you were a little bit knee-breed. That assholes.
Just a tad. Good. That's what it took. But I was polite. I'm still I'm not one of those.
I'm not a belligerent drunk. I'm the other kind. The modeling drunk. The I love you man kind of drunk.
I was polite. Excuse me. Excuse me. You. You. They stand there with their arms folded like I'm not going to budge.
Like to what? Well, but what is that? What does that mean? Is that just part of the rudeness and the
unmanse of this town? Welcome to town. There's a lot of reason to be in Canada. They didn't pull that crap.
I still think that that the stone's concert in Canada and Toronto with a half a million people without any any
kind of really incident of any significance. 500,000 people out of boiling hot day.
Is is shocking. It's just you almost can't even relate to it. Yeah. You know what I mean?
I know what you mean. Now the best part of that thing last night. Yeah, you've been there. You've been to the you want to see the
backstreet boys there in the pouring rain. Thanks a lot Woody. By the way, nearly got pneumonia. Like what? I'll never forget that when we walked out of there.
But anyway, pouring rain last night also, but you know how they have the big lawn area where they seat people. Right. They.
Backlight boys were lip-syncing. Everywhere. Inch of sod from that lawn area was torn up and used as a projectile.
I got sucked in by the backstreet boys and they threw the sod as projectiles all because I thought they were really singing and
everyone got covered. Yeah, they were great. And of course that I find out that they can't see the right of a paper sack outside of the studio from the head to its own.
20 to one and also we got today six to eight George will be at the new solid golden for Lauderdale. Let's his new hanging it out
place on the northwest corner of open the federal hub the best of stuff there. I'm sure.
And there might be some other best of stuff as well that you can grab a hold of. Also tomorrow,
Bill Sittles Boulevard of savings little George will be there on Northwest 36th Street. He especially wants to send a personal invite to the guy with the eyes and the guy with the
fanny pack and Jack with the hands. That's Bill Sittles Northwest 36th Street just west of 27th Avenue. Get the best in the
Illinois free food from the 90 city subs and drinks from Dickens Sider from 11 to 1 tomorrow. Jack's teeth are way more interesting than his hands.
Are they really? I never noticed. I could never get that close. I could never get that close.
By the way, there are some people with really bad breath. I just I just mentioned I'm not talking about you but no, there's some people with really bad breath and I don't like it.
You know what I mean? No. I'm not talking about anybody in particular. I just know some people who have very bad breath.
And it is annoying as hell to me and I wonder if they've ever seen this amazing thing called a toothbrush or even thought about sticking it in their mouth.
How about a toothbrush? Don't just choose a little bit of gum. How about a little juicy fruit?
I'll just let that one go. I know you will. I don't necessarily. Although I take a little peek.

Come on us before 1 at 560 WKM 349 votes on a poll.
Not too impressive as a matter of fact.
Of course, who the hell could be here now?
It's a holiday weekend, right?
Right.
And they said there's going to be more people traveling in this country this year
so the end year and the last eight since 95.
This is the last gasp weekend, too.
84% by car, though, because we have a lot of pussy's out there and they're a little
a bit of a scared again.
They just don't want to wait online for five hours waiting for someone to search them
and all that.
Did you see the lines they were showing on that news report?
Where was this?
A airport you name it.
No.
At you name the airport?
No.
All these lines.
No.
Yeah.
Well, maybe today.
Yeah.
Because it's Labor Day weekend.
Well, I mean, if you got any brains, you don't leave when everybody else is leaving.
You find that you know, you do a more creative way of doing it.
You get to be a little bit more clever than that.
If you can.
If you can.
Well, what is the world as a way?
OK.
Anyway, we got 300 and some of our votes on a pool.
Who do you think is or was the most dislike media person in South Florida?
352 to be exact right now.
Rick Sanchez.
He's got it licked.
He's looking at 179.
Mohauer, David, a good showing is usual from all, but a distance second only 93.
Not even a hundred five sixty.
WQIM.
Oh, five hundred and sixty bucks.
Well, that's pretty good.
You see, once I bitched them out or once they had time to figure out that they go over
and give them a little squeeze, I'd squeeze it.
17,040.
You didn't ask him.
That's time he calls asking where the hell he was on Monday, because we can't remember.
Because we did 14 hundred bucks.
There was pretty good for our opening salvo.
Right?
Right.
Monday or Tuesday, whatever there was.
Whatever.
And because yesterday in case you tuned in late, you on mark raised 60 bucks
for abandonment, pet rescue.
I mean, I would just put my tail between my legs and go right to the pound.
We didn't have before.
No, that's not that's terrible.
I'd have put up the 60 and saved them the trouble of going.
Now, seriously, I'd have put up the 60 bucks.
It's malpatitis.
It's nothing.
352 votes for extension 179.
Mojauer David 93.
George Rodriguez 23.
You moved in the third place.
Nice going, George.
Hank Goldberg 21.
Neil Rogers 20.
I'm on your ass.
Delkie's Nareed 12 and Greg Bitole only four.
Nobody has any idea who that man is.
He was at Brandy's.
How could we forget?
Oh, that's right.
Our fine sponsor, Brandy's boy, Troy Stradford,
is going to be really parked off at me.
He was with Troy at Brandy's on whatever day it was.
That's why everybody went there to see Troy.
I told you he draws a crowd.
He does draw crowd.
People like rubbing his bald spot.
He's a good guy.
You know, this is the old oil this morning.
I got to be honest with it.
Even though I'm a daughtering old man,
I'll be 61 in November.
I mean, 61 is just, I'm so freaking old.
It's terrible.
But this morning, I had my first fist experience.
Now, not the kind that you're probably thinking about.
Huh?
Yeah.
I think people can be with Troy.
No, well, you never know.
Sometimes I shock the whole other people.
He usually.
Well, just because they have a record.
Well, I haven't heard it yet.
Anyway, like I started to say,
he extended his black hand.
He's got a hard, a hard hand, by the way.
He's got a big, well, football, you know, football.
He's got a hard, hard knuckle.
He's a hard fist, yeah, that would hurt.
No, no, they didn't hurt.
And we did the fist thing, you know.
For the uses lotion.
And I thought, it was the previous lotion on his, uh,
on his basket.
But anyway, and I thought to myself,
what, that sure makes me hip and cool now, don't it?
No, not really.
I don't watch over it.
See, because, and again, it all depends,
you have to be very careful,
because when somebody who's hip and cool like Troy extends,
you're heading out, they just put the fist out like this.
You have to do the, the, that's gone.
That's how it.
Yeah, but I'm saying that's, that's, that's passe.
But if he would have done that, I would have had to do this.
And then I'm topping on about, that's out.
Now it's just this, saying, of course,
you get it from the jocks, the jocks are the first ones
to like fist each other.
Always happens that way.
Yeah, mostly in the locker room, of course,
when nobody's looking.
And now it's out, out of the route, locker room.
And now it's out in the open, they're fisting,
which is really disgusting,
but nevertheless, it seems to be very popular.
Right, Tom.
Now if you're really excited.
So, and that, because there reminded me of the time
that Greg came in there, I'll never forget it
as long as I live the book came out.
And as usual, we kicked ass, we were, you know,
and he's putting on a phony,
congratulations with you, even though he hates you,
like poison.
And he did, it was back the, it was one of those high five.
Oh, it was just a high five?
No, it was a low five.
Was it, was it low five?
I thought it was high.
No, it was a low five.
High five.
No, you know what I mean?
Yeah, no.
As opposed, see, I, I'm sorry, I just,
I'll call me old-fashioned, but it's so much easier,
especially when you're senile.
Just remember, hey, this is the way you shake hands,
like this, you know, 100 years ago,
you keep changing it.
It changes every week now.
I'm sorry, I can't keep track to lose like tracks.
I can't keep track of how I'm supposed to do
to be hip and cool, even on my squares, a cardboard box.
I don't, I have no idea.
Nor do I want to know, you know, but well,
but I mean, he just, he just extended it in such a way, you know?
Right.
And when somebody like him extends something to me in such a way,
I make a decision whether, whether I want to participate or not.
And of course, in his case, that was as far as we were going, you know.
He's a good guy.
He pounded it, yeah.
I bet you're pardoned?
You pounded it.
Your fists.
I pounded it with my fist.
I don't think so.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six,
he pounded five, six, he, okay, I want to do the, what?
You said pounded five, six,
that's what we got.
That's what we got out there at, at hooters.
On the southeast corner of Pines and University,
I don't know if we really have a, if we, now listen, here's the deal.
I will do the one or two with no best of stuff.
We'll just do the regular hour today.
We'll, we'll, like, face back in,
even though Monday being a holiday,
George is working, which he shouldn't have to, but he is.
But Monday, do whatever the hell you want.
Playing all kinds of stuff.
Right, music,
but I'm just saying, but today we swing back into the real thing,
then starting Tuesday, we'll get back to doing, like, a real show,
and stop pretending we're doing what.
But if, if we can get that thing up to a thousand today,
that would make it worthwhile, or should I?
All right, yeah.
Bribery.
I think there's a lot of people out there
should pay like 20 bucks or 40 or 50 just to go out
and shake Miguel's hand.
Sure.
Just to fist him a little bit would be good.
For a hundred, huh?
He might be a little worn out by the end of it.
In fact, Doreen might be a little jealous,
but nevertheless, not to mention his lovely wife.
17,480, which means we did,
well, we got for a, what did we do?
And you got me confused.
No, we got 360 today, right?
Or no, five, five 60.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Five 60 WQAM.
See every time I say five 60,
I'm conditioned to do that.
What?
Six hundred.
Six hundred.
What are you laughing about?
You're thinking about fisting Miguel, I know you.
17,520.
That whole thing is just,
seeing now, why you make me think about that?
It wasn't bad enough that he started last year with it.
Two years ago, with eating ass,
it got Maddie Bell all bad out of shape
and nearly got Dwight Lutterdale Candid Channel 10.
That wasn't bad enough.
Now he's doing this fisting crap, you know?
This is the kind of stuff that I have to try to overcome
on his show to keep a nice family ambiance
on his program, as Mo Witzer and a program.
I'm so sorry.
Five six seven, oh five 60.
And I'm telling you, I don't see enough
a lot of action.
We're doing screenless here.
I see only two lines ringing.
That's not a, it doesn't bode well for Duff's one to two hour.
WQAM.
Yes, I'd like to say hello to Neil.
Speaking.
Yeah, it's good afternoon, Neil.
How are you?
Okay, Neil, I just wanted to tell you something regarding
Mo Howard, David.
I used to work with a New York jet years ago,
and I lived in New York and I still say it touched
with the people up there.
Right.
And you know, they can curl you wholeheartedly
that he is without a doubt one of the most bifold.
I mean, he's virtually evil.
He just is a miserable person.
Absolutely.
Yeah, you know, the picture you have on your web page of him,
I sent it up to a couple of people up there.
And they were like, yeah, that's you pretty much
captured the essence of Mo Howard in the picture.
He really is.
People think that I'm making up.
I couldn't manufacture anybody as evil as he is.
You know, I like this.
The people like it so far, if I work for the ticket department,
but you know, I stated touch with a lot of people
in their organization.
And the ones, you know, the work in media of this.
Yeah.
Nobody likes them.
It's incredible.
I, you know, it's a fair that somebody
could be looked so down upon.
Yeah, he is universally despised and reviled
by virtually everyone who's even ever smelled him.
Well, you know, like I call you a wild dog next
and check that a web page to you.
I don't know if you have had a chance to look at it
on ipl.org.
I don't think so.
I know you like to re-farm publications
and on this web page.
Well, no, I did check that out.
I haven't written down up in Toronto.
I do check that now from time to time.
Yeah, it's really a good source of information
for anybody.
And I live off of it because I do travel from time to time
and before I go to a city, I just pull up their newspaper.
I pretty much know where I'm going,
what I'm going to do before I get there.
Right.
And you listen, you have a good holiday week, then.
And you too.
Thanks for the report.
OK, bye.
Thanks.
See, there's an update.
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, he is reviled.
Absolutely.
Universal.
My life and local.
This is 420560.
You wait, you wait.
Under 2 hours.
Hot stuff right now on Channel 23, baby.
They're doing it.
Baby, my partner.
New ones on the way.
Haven't been a daddy since he has today.
Heather's expecting.
We can work it out.
But it doesn't make me want to twist and shout.
No.
When I'm 60, Laura still changed diaper.
Absolutely.
When this gets grown up, I will be dead.
Better stop the clown, baby whitebirds.
My aching head.
Or baby McCartney won't give me no rest.
I am not much better off than a bitch.
Don't know if the kid will be a singer.
Just hope it's healthy when it finally comes.
What the job to have 10,000 fingers.
Unlike its mom.
Baby McCartney, your dad is elderly.
Wonder why it couldn't just let me.
103, our new favorite TV show is on right now.
Channel 8 to the face.
What's it called?
Enganyada.
Enganyada, which means fooled.
But it's feminine words.
What means she's fooled.
Enganyada.
Miramar Cera.
I need to talk to her.
She's the woman we're in the lot.
I have a lot of money.
The guy in the room.
And the boy I was inside.
I'm in the room.
I have a record.
Oh, to blind it's on her.
She's so hot that if I were of that persuasion, I'd be hubbin the TV set.
Where the hell is she?
She just showed up.
Oh, she was just up there.
She is.
No, no, no, not that blonde.
No, the other one will take her.
No, no, no.
The other one's like, makes her look like a...
Here we go again with this crap.
Look at this.
She's sitting.
He's got his hand up her ass.
Look at that.
This is our kind of show boys.
Well, it's only been on two minutes.
Another five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
The other five minutes.
Oh, wow.
I always love that channel painting today's baby.
That's the best.
That is the show.
I'm serious.
And look at this.
They're going to do it right there on camera.
Well, she was thinking about it.
Or he was.
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixteen.
Now this is the hour.
This is what tough wanted baby.
Clearance and tough.
They said, well, he really do it.
Or is he just going to take his way through again.
Now we're going to do it.
But I don't see anything on the phone.
He's one call.
And you want to know why?
Because they're busy watching the show.
W-D-Q-A-M.
Yeah, can you speak to Neil?
Speaking.
Does Neil?
Sounds like me.
Hey, how you doing?
Pretty good.
How you?
Pretty good.
Hey, when are we going to get rid of Moa?
Get in that fresh cup of Joe.
Good, good suggestion.
You like that, huh?
I love it.
Yeah, get rid of Moa and get a fresh cup of old Joe.
Sounds excellent.
Have a great day.
Sounds like a plan, man.
You too.
Have a happy, a Labor Day weekend.
Everybody.
We'll see ya.
Because I'm busy watching the TV.
Oh, if they would read one,
read one to one from yesterday.
I love it.
We want it.
I would.
And even a guy who's in the sack here, I ate too bad.
You know, the one that's got that Shmata on his head.
He's got a bloody stump.
Five-six.
And with all the action done this show, believe me,
you couldn't blame anybody for having a bloody stump.
Good God.
They never put it away.
Five-six-seven-oh-five-sixty.
Five-six-tee.
Yeah, you can always tell that you're hookin' up with something
and you know, I mean, it's got a lot of action when that baby is really raw.
I'll pay you that right now.
When that thing is like just like paparice again,
there's that word coming back again.
Papyrus.
Like onion skin, as opposed to like four skin.
Oh, we even got a call on line nine from that asshole WQAM.
Can I fuck your-
Uh-huh.
What do we do?
Yeah, exactly.
It was an S, by the way, what he said.
Yeah.
You're a moron.
You're an idiot.
You're an individual.
And of course, all I crap.
Well, I'm just a big fan of you, you're an idiot.
Get some mental health, OK?
WQAM.
I have a million people every year at Indianapolis.
No major incidents.
A quarter of a million people twice a year at the corner.
No major incidents.
Yeah, they're not those those special.
Doing what?
You're talkin' about it to watch cars go round and round?
Yeah, but what about that?
It's a little bit different than a rock concert.
You moron, OK?
And by the way, stay right there where you aren't keep picking your nose.
Idiot.
It's not about car races.
But they'll listen to it with anything.
And of course, the incidents there are generally on the track when people are getting killed all over the place and all the rubber neckers are watching it.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.
Whoever heard of a rock concert with half a million people,
where there are a whole bunch of, you know, crap going on, right?
Right.
And it's got, well, what's up?
Your sound is boring as this town.
It's your, you're one of the reasons I'm delighted it is hell to be getting the hell out of here.
You're making me ecstatic.
Just thinking of your dull, horrendous, negative voice.
To just a tone kind of turns my bone in a downward direction, connection.
WQAM.
You can hear voice.
QAM.
Yeah, how are you?
Pretty good.
You know, related to what George is talking about, 100% correct.
I noticed it in the movie.
You try to get out of the aisle and normally I'll stand up when somebody come by.
But no, here they sit there and like go, they scoop back maybe an eighth of an inch.
This one's not as pretty as you like it.
You know, one guy put his leg up so as an impediment like a blocking point.
I also noticed, of course, at the, I don't know what do we call it, the Macarena or the one I was called now.
Same damn thing.
So what I do, I'm a pretty big guy.
I just plow right through, you know, and oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
You know, can't get in and push it in there.
They just pretend you're an Amsterdam and just push everybody else out of the way the way that they do it.
I know.
I have a great week down here.
And you too, thank you.
Yeah, if you're in a midst of a bunch of rude people, when in Rome, you know, screw the Romans, that's what I say.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, looks like he's thinking about it right now.
Look at that.
That's all he do on the show.
Is this dinner?
If they're not doing it, they're like preparing to do it or thinking about having just done it or getting ready to do it again.
That's it.
All they do on the show.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
That's the reason it's going to be tough now because we got everybody tuned into Channel 23.
Even if people like, leave the volume.
Even if people like, hate you, folks.
WDQ I am.
I like 6 year olds with soil panties.
What is it?
I like 6 year olds with soil panties.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
We're happy for you.
Trace the call. WDQ I am.
That's probably one of the people that are going to see it.
Bill Siddleston.
Yes, sir.
Is it Neil?
Sounds like me.
How are you doing?
Do you have brandy's first appearance?
I'm in your party.
Your first appearance with a guy with the brandy's during the week.
And brandy shoes.
That's right.
Well, thank you so much.
Now, everything we can do.
And you too.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
See, I told you, this one is two-hour bad mistake.
But again, you got two program directors and there are two experts.
Oh, please do the one that's a bad mistake.
Your fools.
Your fools, both of you, man.
We can be sitting here and enjoying our new impanjata or whatever the hell this show is.
And uh-
It's like that better.
It is better.
Our new Chalupa.
And instead of that, we got to like put up what it was.
What's the idiot's here for a whole lot?
She hopped on the wheelchair.
That's our programming brain.
Yeah, these are the brain trust.
You missed it.
I mean, look away for a second.
And the red had jumped on the wheelchair.
Holy cow.
And it's not-
She got busted.
I'll be damned.
There are just a bunch of people hopping on each other and trying to hop on each other
and grabbing each other and slamming each other against the wall.
This is a typical Cuban family, of course.
Even though the rent is oiling probably.
But this guy's probably paralyzed and raised down.
And she jumped on it anyway.
Fights, she jumped on it, huh?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on it.
Don't forget, get out there.
The best and the ill stuff all I merchandise, including the world famous MoHauer-David-Ed
keychain.
There you go.
You can play-
You like you can sit behind people in various events and just stick it right behind you
or you're in play-
Absolutely.
Stuff like that.
And they'll freak out.
They'll think that the molemyster is there and the-
Gee, I don't smell them.
So, don't forget-
What's his name?
Miguel is that the hooters parking lot in the QM fan right now.
I saw the coronavirus in university.
If you speak to him, realize in the right language you might like to invite you in for
a little tumble in the back for a few seconds.
French.
Have a good time.
You said the right language.
Oh, French.
If you give him like a little French kiss.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, you're going to get a lot of idiots this hour.
But that's what they wanted.
That's what you guys wanted.
We wanted a good hour.
We had good calls today.
I didn't take a whole lot of them, but we didn't have too many idiots today.
No, not till recently.
This hour.
This hour.
You might like to invite you in for a little tumble in the back for a few seconds.
French.
Have a good time.
You said the right language.
Oh, French.
If you give him like a little French kiss.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, you're going to get a lot of idiots this hour.
But that's what they wanted.
That's what you guys wanted.
We wanted a good hour.
We had good calls today.
I didn't take a whole lot of them, but we didn't have too many idiots today.
No, not till recently.
This hour.
You might like to invite you in for a little tumble in the back for a few seconds.
French.
Have a good time.
You said the right language.
Oh, French.
If you give him like a little French kiss.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 8, 5, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,
4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
And now, Barry's singing about it in his brand new CD can't smell without you with fractured versions of Barry's hints like Copacabana.
I broke my banana, broke my banana, and now it's the size of a banana.
As well as a remastered and really nasally version of Mandy recorded at the moment of impact.
Oh damn it, my nose hit the wall that would say King.
But that's not all. Barry Manelow's cat snow without you is swollen with hits.
You nose and love, like I break the schnauz. I made it through the pain.
Looks like I broke it and a title track with Barry's trademark hook.
You know I can't smell without you. I can't breathe without you.
I can't stiff and I can't pick. It looks like my face was hit with a brick.
Barry Manelow's cat snow without you. Walk into a Walmart.
Ow! And pick up a copy today.
The hardest 12 inches in football.
117 at 560 WQI am happy Friday to a happy Labor Day.
Which is kind of ironic because it's a Labor Day holiday when most people don't labor.
Just I don't know. It's kind of dumb.
But it's nice to have a holiday. Don't we like holidays? Sure, especially in this business.
Now, well there's that one call. It couldn't be the retire guy again because he's the only one that calls on six.
But stuff came in here. Try to give me a pep talk about how great this is the one at two hour.
Which he's full of crap and we know it. WQI am.
Hello. Because he has a guilty conscience. Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil, how you doing? Pretty good.
All right. Until what time is the girl going to be there?
Till you get to you leave with your stuff.
You know, oh, are you making any other appearances for the best of all?
Oh, yeah. All the time. Why not go to the sheet on it? Where are you?
We have a sheet on it. We have a sheet on it? Like where the next two appearances are going to be.
Where's the sheet? I don't see the sheet.
When you've been reading from all day.
I see talking about the I tell you. He's talking about Miguel. He wants to see Miguel.
Miguel will be. Yes, some of them.
He wants to hook up with Miguel and check out some of that fist action.
No, George. George is going to be six to eight tonight at the new salad golden for lottery on Northwest corner of Oakland in federal with Miguel.
And a corner of Oakland and federal. OK.
But don't make a federal case out of it. And then tomorrow George will be at Bill Siles Boulevard of Savings North for a 3060.
Just with 27 Avenue. All right. Got it. Got it. Thanks.

Former minister sentenced to life on Sodomy conviction. All right.
Louisa Kentucky. I never heard of that. Did you? I thought it was going to say Louisville. But it's Louisa.
A former Baptist minister who fled the courthouse before being convicted of Sodomy was in court Thursday.
When he was sentenced to life in prison, plus 20 years.
Truman Evans, 57, disappeared July 1st as the jury deliberated.
That's a sign of innocence if I ever heard one.
Evans walked outside the Lawrence County Court House saying he needed fresh air and fled.
Bye-bye. The FBI found Evans on July 16th in the department of Redden Geneva, Ohio.
On Thursday, Evans of Louisa sat silently behind his attorney.
As Judge David Hagerman be rated him for his crimes, there needs to be some concrete walls between the court.
Between you and young children, Hagerman told the handcuffed Evans who was flanked by armed deputies.
Prosecutors, this is a Baptist minister. Prosecutors said Evans forced a child to perform oral sex on him and attempted another to force another to do the same.
Evans had testified the last day of his trial that his accusers made up the stories about being molested because he had spanked them.
Juris deliberated 35 minutes before convicted Evans of 1st-degree saturday on a 7-year-old boy.
And criminal attempt to commit 1st-degree saturday on a 9-year-old girl.
jury recommended a life sentence plus 20 years.
Oh! The judge said given the evidence against Evans, 35 minutes was a reasonable amount of time for the jury to deliberate.
There you go. And, if that wasn't good enough, sex offender minister gets out of prison, this in Lakeland, Florida.
A real Mugwamp Yahoo place. Ever been in Lakeland? No. Don't.
You know who lived in Lakeland? How come I don't hear him? I don't know.
There he is. Well, we don't want to overdo it.
The Reverend Kenneth Baxley is a free man having served. He loved months of a 30-month prison sentence for having sex with a teenager in his care.
Baxley 38 was served four years as leader of the Central Baptist Community Ministries in West Lakeland,
resigned the position in February 2002 following his arrest on five counts of sexual battery on a child.
How do you like that? At the time he was already in the Polk County jail, he was in the Polky for fending the register as addresses as sex offender,
a charge stemming from his 83 offense for which he was sentenced to probation. Baxley was sentenced in May 2001 to a two years for the failure to register charge.
And yada yada yada. There you go. On and on it goes.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Let's get those phones smoking, man.
Or Duff is going to really ruin his whole weekend. You know what? It won't bother me.

Okay. I'm just saying till two o'clock. I made that up. Well, he haven't had any.
You don't want to come back here too soon because the read might start hitting on him again. He's so tired of that smell.
You know, he can't stand it. And I don't blame him.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon. Wireless line.
Well, you know, you're sitting in there laughing, but I think he's got an excellent point.
You want to know why? Thanks forever to get that taste and smell out of your system.
You got it, Henry. Oh, by the way, loosen weight. You fat cow. Jesus. I still can't get over how.
It looked like somebody took a gigantic, not a bicycle pump, but you know the air hoses.
No, not the ones that you put air in your tires, but like the vacuum.
You know, the big vacuum things they have at the gas station that you vacuum your car out with.
It looked like somebody pulled one of those hoses up and we asked and just pumped him up.
Maybe Henry Barrow could be governor of California. They pumped him up. What's that now?
He said, meal. That's a thousand.
Yeah, that's it. What? Meal. Meal. As in meal Rogers.
So we got a thousand bucks. I never, I never drained. We could do it.
I'm in shock.
So I'm trying to figure out I'm trying to scrap right now.
So if we started at what do you start it? It means we got 18,120. Let's hear it.
Oh, oh. Oh.
Nice going, Miguel. And he's still there for like to whenever he feels like leaving for another half hour anyway.
So 18,120, which means early part next week will be over the 20,000 mark and we're really only starting to get this thing organized right now.
Right. And once we get those for real key chains, it's going to be really
again, there's no telling how big that'll be. You know what I'm saying?
Absolutely.

Sounds like to me.
438 votes on a whole lot of them ahead.
Getting into somebody.
Who do you think?
We got to get Larry King on there.
I know Erick's probably not paying any attention anymore
because he figures this is all done.
He's probably not paying no attention.
But, nevertheless, Larry King's a good suggestion to that we didn't think about that earlier
because he hasn't been here in a Koons age.
But a lot of people don't like Larry too much down here.
They don't cut into him because he ripped off a lot of folks down here.
Do you ever pay him back?
No.
No.
Made millions and millions.
He still making millions.
Ever pay anybody back and dime down here?
No.
Just stuck it to him.
Hey, Duff, I hope you're listening in here or office
because there's only one call on the board on screenless right now.
He says it's on there.
Or he just put it on there.
It's on what?
On fire?
OK, just relax.
Don't everybody get all bent out of ship?
Catch what I'm saying?
Uh-huh.
OK, good.
Larry.
So it'll pop up next time.

Oh, chronic.
Mr. Negative, Mr. Heavy Breathing Hostel Negative.
WDQAM?
Hello?
WDQAM?
Weak, Lane, Fony.
WDQAM?
Yeah, sir.
How you doing, Neil?
Pretty good.
Um, listen to that.
You know, I think it's funny.
I think it's funny hearing all those both good.
First of all, guys are real asshole.
Yeah.
You know, first of all, guys are real asshole.
But there's one thing I gotta get him credit for.
At what's answer?
He's not a fag.
I'm gonna have to get out.
How does he know?
Yeah, how can you be sure of that?
Especially with all of being the rapee and all of these bits.
My holy, your friend.
WDQAM?
Yeah, Neil.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Um, I was in Canada this summer, Vancouver.
And I really had a great time.
That's a beautiful city.
Good.
Have you been there?
No, I have not.
That is, uh, well, I could move there in a heartbeat.
I didn't have everything down here going for it.
That is really beautiful.
That's why everybody tells me that.
It's, uh, it's pretty, the people are nice.
They speak English.
Everybody gets along and...
Sounds kind of like Toronto to me.
Everybody speaks English and everybody gets along.
Yeah, I used to go to Toronto.
I lived in Detroit a couple of years ago.
Right. Well, that's unfortunate.
Yeah.
Well, it's good that you got out of there anyway.
But, uh, if you ever get a chance to go by Vancouver,
boy, it is really spectacular.
Okay.
Have a good one.
And you too.
There's a guy at Town in Vancouver, right?
I want to go.
Okay.
Go to Whistler B.C.
Okay.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

And the Shadow knows.
And the Radiant Hot Springs.
You can smoke some really good rope up there in Whistler B.C.
W-Q-I-M.
Now, what the hell was that all about?
W-Q-I-M.
Hello.
Hola.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Uh, for you, please.
Speaking.
Neil, how are you?
Pretty damn good.
Good.
Hey, Neil, I, um, got back from Amsterdam about three weeks ago.
I'll be damned.
Was my first visit there and loved it.
I had a great time.
Now, you're not the guy that was standing in the hotel room next door to me.
There are no other.
No, in fact, I, uh, my wife, well, we were, uh, on the tram said,
as you think you're going to run into Neil.
And I said, I, Neil has not been talking nicely about this place lately.
So I don't think we're going to speak him in.
No, I was just there.
I know.
I know.
And then I heard that you were there.
Well, I see you, you're, you're locked out.
I mean, you know, you have, if you've been to a place a hundred times
and then you have a couple of bad experiences, you can't just give up on it.
But I will say, and everybody I've talked to agrees with me,
they went through a period of time when the tourism was way down.
And there were no tourists there, like back in May and back in the wintertime.
And it was, it was deadly there.
It was just very boring.
But, uh, but starting again, I guess in late July and August,
it really picked up again.
Well, I, we really, we really loved it.
And we were looking forward to going back there.
Again, Neil, what I wanted to let you know was that,
the first thing we got there, we took the number four tram,
we're going up to the city center and we got off just before Rainburn's plan.
Right.
And, um, we walked into this, we were looking for a place to eat,
and we walked into this little Mexican restaurant,
and we sit down, and I tell my wife, honey,
that is Celia Cruz that they're playing a CD of.
And she goes, you know, Celia, who?
I said, you know, a Cuban lady who died in,
was in the front page of the Sunsendle for two weeks.
Is that a gay background coming out?
No.
Exactly, Neil.
So she goes, forget it, how would you know?
So the waiter comes over and I said, excuse me, sir,
is that Celia Cruz?
Is that a gay background coming out?
And, and Neil, he goes, not only does he say yes,
he says, we were in mourning for her here a couple of weeks ago,
when she died.
Yeah, I know they hear, sir.
Well, maybe, maybe in that little Mexican restaurant they were.
Well, yeah.
Nobody else in Amsterdam knows from Nocella Cruz, I'll tell you that.
Not, but the guy was blonde, Neil, and he looked at me.
I'll still believe it.
Incredible.
Well, thanks for the good news, Palli.
And I say I was going to have a conversation with him.
Please, listen to me.
No, because I was going to tell him I know exactly
the restaurant where he's talking about.
I'd never been in there.
I know exactly where it is right there in the Rembrandt Plan.
Not too far from McDonald's and also from the Fulafel place
where the rumors once ate and biocally paid for their own food.
On the Rembrandt Plan.
How do you know that?
Because I witnessed it.
Okay.
I was actually there.
And, well, no, I didn't see how I'd go in there with him.
I don't think.
See if you'd take in your cab or leave it.
I didn't.
I didn't.
I didn't.
That's why I paid for their own food.
But they told me it was very good.
I've never had Fulafel.
Now, there is something that's, because there always have
any ethnic food festivals in Toronto.
Right.
And they have like this stuff on a stick.
Now, like the, um, oh, no, no, no, no, not that.
Stuff on a stick.
It's called Slovakie.
Slovakie?
Yeah, that's Greek.
Yeah.
And it looks really good, but I think.
Greek stuff on a stick.
Greek stuff on a stick.
Oh my God.
Yeah, probably.
And I've never been daring enough to try that.
I don't know what the hell it tastes like.
You can order it at the restaurant over here.
You can.
You can.
Slovakie?
Yeah, they don't give it to you on a stick.
They put it on a plate.
They stick it.
They place it.
They get up there.
I'm a little.
This is 205.

QAM.
Tonight on biography with Mr. Manganese.
Hello, I'm Harry Smith.
It's an angry attack.
It's a angry attack.
Join us tonight as we delve into the life of Cuban icon Celia Cruz.
Born in Oyster Bay, Long Island.
Cecil Fragman was a gifted child in more ways than one.
Little did he know what one it would be.
The early days of his career were in Vaughville, performing stand-up comedy in drag.
So I tell them, if you want flowers, go bang a florist.
Is it me or his and boo, or my big red sparkles, you?
World War K.
Cecil signed up as a merchant marine in Wasenta Cuba, where he retooled his Nyclobak and became the well-endowed Superman that was featured in the film Godfather Child.
Little did he know, Castro would rise the power, forcing him to change his act once again.
Look how my marrame is tied right around that time and there was a void to be filled.
So I happened to be hung like Uncle Melty and I decided to slip on a dress and start singing.
You know?
Cecil changed his name to Celia Cruz and became enormously successful as a drag queen salsa singer.
Riga, won't be a standard for body in drag and say look like her, that's first time we're the ten.
Rube business dealings earned Celia his fortune, like they did song he had after a record label offered him 85 cents per record in royalties.
One dollar meter, one ticket, one dollar spend.
On a sad note, Celia died.
No, it's a coming, I'm not allowed.
Fourteen till two.
A lot of people in the flow, I'll tell you that.
We did eleven hundred bucks there to do this, pretty damn good, thanks to our friends of an Arab Hooters in the parking lot.
I don't know if we have any on the inside but we had friends in the parking lot.
Right.
And Miguel has gone, okay, so don't be slurping up there right now, say oh gee you didn't tell us he's gone.
So turn around, go home.
So one of our listeners out there who's obviously got a little bit too much time on his hands,
faxes me a picture of from a movie, the movie is Skadoo, and there's a guy here holding some chick up in the air and she's blowing a trumpet.
Like I don't know what this is, who knows, she's blowing something.
And he's popped some serious wood there, looks like.
Hello, you know you really can't be sure.
And like I said, this faxer has been watching a lot of things very real close, looking for something.
Anything I think, but thank you very much anyway, it's amusing, it's cute.
It's fair.

Larry King got a vote.
Absolutely.

Yeah George.
Yeah, like the Kineo.
Okay, where you coming from?
For Lauderdale.
Let's go to For Lauderdale, hello.
Hello.
Yes sir.
Yeah, Neil.
Yeah, you're talking about this Larry King old time?
Yeah.
Back in the 60s, he had a radio station on a 70 NICT recording.
He had a radio station?
Well, he's on a radio station on a 70 NICT recording way.
He came in, he used to come in as a steady customer to my restaurant and I worked for parking cars.
Right.
I cast a check for him for $10.
And it bounced.
Now it didn't bounce.
I came to the owner, Mr. Winer, radio won, we're winner from the park.
Bomi Fistidas.
Yeah.
And it bounced.
Bomi Fistidas.
Yes, no, it wasn't 50, it was 20.
Bomi Fistidas.
Yes.
But I just want to confirm that.
Bomi Fistidas.
And this is back in the early 60s.
Bomi Fistidas.
Right.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
Wow, there's something to look at there.
Like again, anyone pushing and showing me is hot headed to Venice, wait, London.
Stop the car.
Wait up.
What extra time was Nathan yesterday?
What was he doing?
Why can't we have an instant replay?
I don't want that immediately, but we're just going to see.
He's feeling the same.
He's got his head in his thoughts.
But I'm going to have to go with you.
I don't want to be there every day.
The best of the days.
I want to be on the Riviera, I want to be there for the Riviera.
Oh.
In your house, they're doing something more.
I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I don't want to be on the next floor, I want to be on the next floor.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Oh, and here's my card on the ice.
Oh, here's my card on the ice.
One, two, three.

Here we go.
Here we go.

That's raw.
Oh, yeah, damn cute.

And there was a good idea, Duffy right? This was fun. It's your better than just sitting here and play a lot of funny stuff.
How many votes we got on there? Who do you think is or was the most dislike media person in South Florida to the anals of time?
467 votes and Ricky Tiki Sanchez. You're a winner, Rick. 233 votes. Mo' Howard David in 119. George Rodriguez 30. I got 26. I'm tied with a Humper.
Stokey's Nerezo only won behind. She's got 25. We got 26. Greg Viedel 6 and Larry Key's already got a pair.
But he's still not giving no money back. WDQAM.
Hey, I had a quick question for Neil. Hello.
Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I had a quick one for Neil. Go ahead. You're speaking to him.
Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, okay. I'll be sorry. Quick, quick question for you. Did you see the big kiss?
The big kiss. Britney Madonna. About 800 times. They show it like every two seconds on CNN.
And the last thing. And like I said, no one where Madonna's lips have been and what they've been near. I mean, would you even consider that?
No, not personally, but Britney on the other hand. You know, and why you're not cross-stress or are you not on your pole?
He's why? Not on the pole. I hate that guy.
Let's see. Yeah, you're right. That's a good point. He should be on it.
No. No. Good point. Let me know. We'll put him on her.
Yeah, it's an error. Let's get him on her. Brian or cross. They hate him.
It's not just it's not just like some of the other people that were mentioned who are just media people who we don't really like a lot, but they really dislike intensely.
They despise you a little, Brian. They find you nauseating and grotesque and self-agranded.

Okay, it's a 4-till-2. We got the little dog. Joe Rose is coming up into a clock. Now, let's get back to some real programming. What do you say?
No. The Humper is back on the year today from Vegas, 4-7. And at 7 o'clock, you get to Marlon's on deck.
This is the series of the year after this grotesque slump on a road, losing 8 out of 9. But the Marlon's miraculously are still in a 5-way time for the Wildcard spot.
So this is the series of the century. Do you think anybody's going to be there tonight?
No. No. I mean, Montreal exposes the hottest team in baseball. They'll be here along with Milwaukee, which still count.
But they'll be here tonight to play the Marlon's at 735 at the PP Park. You're going to be there, right?
What? Where?
The gigantic series. Any camp at the baseball game and ESPN radio overnight, because Joe and Marco only raised 60 bucks for us the other day. They're on their way out.
Jay and Davy says, I'd like to nominate a little Brian Orcrossy, a little psychic work there by Jay and Davy.
So, every time I see him doing the weather, I want to puke. He makes all that money to be on three times a year because they know everybody hates him.
Keep up the good work. George was great over the summer and most sucks. Nice going, Jay.
He puts all the bases, sweetheart.
18,220 for a band and pet rescue. We're up there. Pretty good start.
1100 today by the lovely Miguel. Thanks Miguel. Don't forget the 6-8 tonight. George will be at the new solid pooled and for a lottery on Northwest Corner of Oakland and Federal.
We're going to have our best stuff stuff. And I guarantee you'll make more than 60 bucks.
Don't guarantee that. Why?
All right.
Guarantee. I bet you're life on it. Okay.
How can you not? 60 bucks? That's 3 CDs. That's 2 CDs and 1 more Howard David in the keychain.
All right. I can do that.
Or that's 1 more Howard David in the keychain and 1 Mad Dog Managed Keychain from last year on 1 CD.
Looks like I'm buying 3 CDs. There you go.
Guarantee. And then it builds titles George tomorrow. But where they like to eat the food. But they have no idea who he is.
It's a great scam. He said going for a ride.
Yes. How much a guy?
Bill Sandles. Bill Seedles. Bull of Art of Savings. I know.
It's pretty silly. All of them on Deacon site.
Just west of 27th Avenue. Get the best of the ill and enjoy free food from the Atlantic City's Ups and drink some Deacon Sider from 11 a.m. until 1 in the p.m. tomorrow.
So do you really want me to smit can that?
Okay. Because I don't want to leave like a mess here. I want to leave it like nice and clean and pristine from the queen.
