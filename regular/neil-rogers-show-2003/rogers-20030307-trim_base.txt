here this morning which we were reading comment on in its entirety just because
of that don't get all silly again now asshole we take it on poor fat d'Arine
you asshole so we're trying to figure out how come I'm here like a little echo
this morning is that just my imagination or is that what is that I don't know my
son huh I'm not talking about that he just a little I don't know maybe it's
good maybe we should have this reverberating from coast to coast then we can
all forget about that depressing contrive press conference last night that was
pretty depressing I don't want to discuss it just saw his push on the channel I
changed the channel real quick anyway before we get into mow and d'Arine you
asshole and very jackson you asshole and Gregory you asshole anyway Florida
mayor warns girls got wildcast not to encourage flashing did you see this
story yeah Panama City and wasn't I just talking the other day about the
beautiful pristine beaches in Panama City sure were that what about all the
important in Christians it's one of their favorite stop and off places they have
all of their they hold their meat there each others the mayor of america's spring
break capital wants nothing to do with wild girls that's America's spring break
capital now I didn't get the memo that's what it says here that's where one of
those girls got wild videos is made and it looked like it was pretty happening
no more I think it happened again the creators of the girls gone wild videos
are planning a live pair for your broadcast next Thursday from an on the
slow spring break destination in the videos college age women bear their
breast while parting the girls gone wild production crew and tour bus
recently arrived in Panama City beats Florida that's prompted police in the
sheriff's office to be on alert with officers on the lookout for public new
to the loot acts and a certainly conduct mirror Lee Sullivan former police
chief himself warns the girls that they go wild in his town they'll go to jail
along with the crew I do like that
I don't
Mayor Lee Sullivan you ask for those wrong with you man that's what that's what's
gonna bring everybody out there the guys and the girls and those who aren't
decided they're all gonna be out there just the filming at the mouth you ask
all with you Lee and they show a lot more than their breasts do they really oh
yeah and I mean they do that girls gone wild is right and it's not just flashing
so on speaking of body parts Oprah's back on top but it says to play on words
that's what it says in the hero along with that very jackass column about the big
QA a milestone with Mohawar david is one year anniversary coming up I noticed
nobody wrote anything about my 27th anniversary on the year in town that
wasn't important news I know you I saw potatoes I guess they haven't seen you
lately yeah out of sight out of mind but Mohawar david and he's got his big one
year anniversary coming up and it's got a whole big cost of column here today
which I sure hope nobody missed but just in case they did we'll get into it in
great depth in the tale boy he and Doreen really you asked for when added from
what we're hearing all kinds of cost of comments about fat Hank that he see when
you open up a big mouth moe and everybody's listening he doesn't understand
that he's still isn't get it didn't I even in the midst of all of our stuff
going back and forth didn't I at least have the vacancy to warn him about spies
about spies who listen in on Q even when he's in his studio there they can listen
to whatever they're talking about on Q and then babble it out to everybody in
the world they babble on so to speak yeah well he just he doesn't get it and so
he always I guess when his microphone is open even if it's only like off the
year and that kind of position like out on remote he doesn't understand that
thousands of people may be monitoring his as verbal her her rings in the
hysteria right like this morning when he looked at Doreen and said you asshole
man we understand it was pretty hostile and nasty and then comments about fat
Hank that's unacceptable okay I was wrong with you man picking on my
pies on Hank he's a good one to talk about people being fat that would be like
my calling people fat okay right right you would have a bitch I never do that
I never pick on Doreen either see when I do what they understand it's the show
everybody else understands that except Mo that's the show that's what they pay me
to do but when he does it it's like personal and vicious and hateful that's
the difference and means spirited because you're dealing mainly with a prick is
what you're dealing with anyway our point yesterday before we get all of that
stuff what's the liberty death during your lifetime had the greatest impact on
you not even a contest John Lennon just blows away the competition is that
incredible I mean I knew he'd probably win but just just destroying
bearing everybody else if I can say that can I say that no John Lennon 270 votes
this is out of over 1300 quite a response again here huh they'll earn heart
93 oh boy they'll earn heart old number three 93 votes which indicates that I was
wrong we do have plenty of Yahoo's out there plenty of nose pickers plenty of
pickup truck drivers right plenty of real connoisseurs of great sport they
learn hard 93 I still don't get it two pack 83 do you believe that no well
Elvis 71 Phil Harbin 68 John Belushi 57 Kurt Cobain 56
Princess die 47 Chris Farley ever see a princess die
what Chris Farley 42 Jerry Garcia 30 Mr. Rogers 30 Fred Rogers just died just
days ago JFK Jr. 29 Paine Stewart 27 and again we have great difficulty on
the show believing that not because we're not in a golf so much but probably
because we're not in a golf so much on the show yeah we have a lot of trouble
believing and that anybody would say Paine Stewart we're just out of time I just
want Peter Alistair know that all of us American golfers on the water company we are
Chinese too they are not any more you're not John Candy 27 Bob Marley 26 John Wayne
25 the Duke our kind of guy wasn't he no
a sermon months in 23 that's surprising to me I guess we had a lot of Yankee fans
out there maybe Joe Castello voted multiple times Frank Zappa how's Joe Pepitone doing
by the way anybody seen him lately Joe Collinsville Scowering Andy Carey who Frank Zappa
23 and Stevie Ray Vaughan 23 so they were tied with Thurmond Munson Bruce Lee had 20
Roberto Clemente 18 and Carol O'Connor at 18 George Harrison and Walter Peyton each
had 16 I'm embarrassed that I forgot that Walter Peyton died Walter Peyton was so great
and such a good guy too notorious B.I.G. Biggie Thmauls had 15 Jim Morrison only had 12 and
Sam Kinnison had a dozen and that a little shocking you that Jim Morrison had only 12 when
Dale Earnhard had 93 see what I'm saying yeah it's this place Freddie Mercury and Salina
each had 11 Jackie Gleason had 10 which is amazing because Milton Broell only had one well
Milton Broell wasn't associated with South Florida yes and that must be it sure why not
well plus Milton Uncle Milti was like he was 150 years old number one and number two he was
out of sight out of mind for so long you know although he didn't have a very big penis
that trouble closing the casket Jackie Gleason and Jim Henson each had 10 Harry Carey 9
Gilder Radner 9 we love Gilder Radner just he was just so great Tim Horton had a must
have some Canadian some leaf fans oh sorry about last night again by the way they just lose every
day now Marvin Gaye had eight Marvin Gaye only had eight that's your influence again yeah sure
Wolf Van Jack had eight Roy Orbison misspelled on their own only one S and Roy Orbison Eric that
must be Carlos's screw up six Morris Gim had only five and Jim Krochi had five aren't you amazed
Morris Gim had only five it just happened a few weeks ago and he was local yeah they had lots of
hits Rock Hudson had four Arthur Ashe Lucille Ball Rick Nelson had four Lucy had only four
oh Audrey Hepburn Sherry Lewis and Brandon Lee each had three Jack Buck had a pair
Uncle Milti and Michael London had one and Freddie Prince didn't have any which is why
he was brains out nobody loved him huh well somebody called him in but that was the guy who called
him three different names right right so I guess the other two he was more broken up about when
they picked the bucket and poor Freddie Prince now what's his son's name Freddie Prince Jr oh yeah
I just heard him remember just a joke I like Freddie Prince Jr. although he could use another
meal or two you know it and another like a sandwich would be good oh it's speaking of eating another meal
I just emailed it's the first time in my life anything ever pissed me off enough to email like a
network yeah CNN they certainly not news network that asshole that doctor Gupta they got on
every day Dr. Guppy yeah he's he's honored this morning talking about the blood sugar and maintaining
insulin levels and weight and all this other crap and about breakfast and about how people who
eat breakfast do so much better with their sugar levels and keeping them you know of course I never
eat breakfast I've never been a breakfast eater so then he puts on a list of the foods that he
recommends for breakfast and the things that are bad Dr. Atkins must be having an off-part attack
he says bad things are like eggs and bacon which of course Dr. Atkins recommends and you can debate
that but he says the good things are like pancakes and uh flan waffle which are pure sugar once
they go into your body they're pure starch pure refined carbohydrate in addition to which what do
you put on pancakes and waffles sir switches pure sugar and this guy's on international TV on
there I just sent him a hostile email saying I should have a kill into people who needs bin Laden
when we got Dr. Gupta on CNN certainly not news you asshole nice go and let him have it mo you
asshole you and the public watches that oh yeah I'm gonna go make some big a plate of flapjacks
right now right big Belgian waffle right some angiomama waffles and stuff and again just pour
on my maple syrup maybe he expected to eat them dry yeah I got something he can eat dry jerk
913 at 560 WQM he's speaking to eatin something really great and we'll coast that's right
they don't have pancakes and waffles but they have just about everything else they got three
locations for either in sunrise north mimey beach and their newest location in Pember of Pines

where you going don't I get it dinner we'll cabling he retouched
okay nine we just heard that nine 18 at five 60 W. Kim so just got my response from CNN yeah
thank you for taking the time to submit your comments on the top stories of the day on CNN
no dot com it's very important to us to know what your viewers are feeling and we uh take we
value your response uh this is how we're able to consider changes that will appeal to you our
valued viewer due to the volume of emails we receive we do not personally be sparse spot email
yadi yadi yadi and we'll pass it along and blow it out sure yeah so in other words I'm that's okay
I still feel better about having done it because I was so pissed off and fired up you know I'll
okay I'm fat and I'm a failure and I'm diabetic and I just had a whatever it was stroke no I know
it was a pulmonary embolism which causes like a little stroke that's what I had all right a
blood clot a bomb a clot but anyway no but seriously and so I'm not maybe the picture
of health but at least I've read a little bit something about it and if I could do all the right
things that probably be looked just like you know John Wayne when he was alive but the fact of the
matter is they put this irresponsible crap on the ear and there are millions of these gullible
people out there including those lifeless and desperate shut-ins that you're always talking about
they're sitting there watching this crap and they believe it oh yeah have some a big plate of
pancakes with syrup on there that'll get your blood sugar and ice and level out at about 500
that'll keep it up there all day even better than Viagra keep it up oh don't forget this
Sunday is the first episode on 60 minutes the first episode Baba and the Bob Dole that's wrong
with you asshole get with it I was gonna say what they probably will be so you know fintains
getting a hundred thousand dollars in episode yeah you see how much dole's getting
eight bucks yeah just a little bit of it if I'm not gonna know Bubba's the big guy right he's he's
just the uh what just the banana Bob Dole just the limp banana so anyway here's this story and I
according to a motha was written by very jackass but it doesn't have a byline and at least not on
the website it's confirmed by the way he is very jackass it figures because Greg is quoted widely
here it says David and WQM milestone morning show at one year mark writes very jackass
next week Dolphins radio announcer Howard David had marked the one year anniversary of his
ballyhooed debut as the main host of WQM's morning show you asshole so how is it gone question mark
both sides seem somewhat disappointed but for different reasons David is disappointed in the
lack of support he's received and WQM management is less than thrilled with the ratings and certain
aspects of the program now here comes a paragraph that you ought to like listen to very very
carefully that's my personal advice got it got it I'm listening I've had concerns about the daily
quality of the show the lack of humor and the lack of invigorating sports talk WQM general manager
Greg Reed said I thought invigorating sports talk is an oxymoron he goes on to say I still have
the same concerns we're going to try to do some things to spruce it up like adding a third
person alongside David and Steve Goldstein question mark then they already have a couple of third
persons yeah a couple of third person they had Carolyn in the beginning and then Mo Blue
who are out of there and then they had the beast in there and he blew him off because he was unprofessional
it could be adding a person it could be adding an element Reed said we will keep striving for
the right formula David said he hasn't heard a discussion of adding a third host but he's not
opposed to anything that would make the show better like maybe leaving Mo oh leaving Mo what
David a client to respond to Reed's comments but said he thinks he's done a good job 70% of the time
and we're working on the other 30% on balance he said I'm satisfied with what's been done
and and then here's a line I guess very much to have this you know how they do it on the word
processors they just have lines that they drop in or repeatedly like and copy right this this
line is repeated verbatim from an earlier Barry Jackass column verbatim but David could not have
anticipated the bashing he's received from a few hosts on the station particularly Neil Rogers
yeah that's a hot key on the word processor right that's f6 I was brought into spearhead
a morning program and so far the gun I've been given hasn't been supplied with as much ammunition
as I thought I would get as far as support he said how that means now here comes the best part to
show what a even though he lashes out what an equator he is David declined to say whether he's
referring to management or the critical host on the station but he emphasized the sales staff has
been supportive and called Goldstein a tremendous asset now that part about the sales staff surprises
me because each and every one of them has come to me belly it can about the fact that they can't sell
his show for crap but at any rate I'm very demanding of myself they've said in time it'll be proven
what we're doing is right Stephen I are being asked to do the job of three people I mean has to do
the job of Joe Rose a former dolphin who's very popular and Jeff DeForest who has a pretty good
following in this market yeah I hate to break the news to you Moe but that's not quite accurate
because those guys were on from six to ten back in the glory days of QA and when we were on
from ten to two which is where the show belongs and Hank was on from two to six wishes or he was doing
great they were doing four hours a day not three an addition of which he already had the third
person there twice any below both the mockers they weren't up to his standards do what I'm saying
you asshole read says he has no regrets about firing the humorous DeForest who pleaded guilty to
paying kickbacks the fourth would be a good addition says very jackass but he says he's happy doing a
four to seven PM show at WDJA a 50 a Palm Beach station which is boosting its signal to increase
penetration in a Miami-Dade County Rose left the station to show to work exclusively for NBC six as
very rhymes with Mary as the beast committed to David as a morning host long term read said nobody
in the business has any assurances but I'm committed to Howard for the time being we need to work with
him former program director Duffland's the incurrent program director Josh Darrell have said in to
give him direction you hear that I heard it I'm so committed they babysat to give him direction
appointment to write to write to give my compass in a road map so as straight in his old ass out
read said he was disappointed by the morning shows ratings in the fall but encouraged by recent
trends covering November through January in the fall the morning show had a yadda yadda yadda yadda
and have a bow 3.2 down from a 4.9 the old team had but among men aged 18 and older the shows ratings
jump from a 4.2 to a 4.9 in the past year months but for six in the market Howard did very well
even beating Neil Rogers read said ratings wise he started to perform better we need to get
decent ratings out of that day part even beating Neil Rogers because that was in one bizarre month
and one that Mary doesn't understand that in January one month we get the hour by hours of that
although Carl Foster and his co-host morning show ratings have risen on WRFX 940
David's program still has a sizable age among all listeners 12 and over in the last book a 2.7 to
a 0.6 David is at no risk of losing his dolphins play by play gig reading the dolphins were happy
with his work David said he enjoys play by play more than talk but has no regrets about joining WQAM
I'm under contract for two more years for both jobs and plan on fulfilling that at least he said
the best thing I've done the most satisfying is getting involved with the reach for the
Starris Foundation to benefit children with cystic fibrosis not that he would say anything
self-serving or anything like that you follow what I'm saying you asshole so there it is a big
column here by Barry Jackass about Moe Howard David is a 1 year anniversary and our fearless leader
runs on to all that thrill with the very weak numbers we've seen repeatedly over the last year
not all that impressed by that fluk during the month of January that goose up that last trend
that nobody believes anyway and now that he pissed off Dorina's morning by calling her all kinds of
names asshole I think he's made a clean sweep can you name me one person I mean you know I don't
want to pick on Moe because we got lots of other stuff to do here huh do I want to pick on
here oh but seriously I mean you'd think that when you're working in a building with about oh I'm
no fifty to a hundred people when you say that's how many people we got we got about a hundred
about a hundred when you think there'd be somebody who likes you somebody who would you know stick
up or you say hey well you know almost a pretty good guy and I like him and he's okay by me
when you think that somebody would uh uh uh you're not anymore not anymore I think maybe Dorine
might have been the last uh oh I don't know what you would have said well how about Luanne
doesn't she still like his back no no no I can't I can't name you one and don't give me guilty
because gully is the last couple of weeks gully has been in fact I think that's why gully's got
Laryngitis he's been squealing all over town so much the last few weeks about what you're gonna do
and moe and oh my god he can't handle that anymore but all that stuff so I think he's had his
fill of being the appendage to his honor to someone who wants everybody to get down and kiss his
ass and his ring and then there was also another great line that didn't get on the ear this morning
but I think that the spies heard this line which is one of the classics of all time
and that is that I guess when he was uh they were talking about the very Jackson article
his response is that during this year at QIM everybody in the building has stuck it up his gang rape
it's funny but back to him how do you like that yeah or something that affect I may be
paraphrasing slightly but I think we're fairly accurate there we're going to let the employee list
see anything bad that's happened to you moe you brought it on yourself whether it has to do with me
with George with Hank with Doreen with anybody else in the building the salespeople with Greg with
Muff with Clarence you brought it on yourself by being a silly pompous old man a humorous old man
who wants everybody to genuinely flick and kiss your ass who's just incapable of functioning with
other people that's the problem that's the bottom line with the molemeister with the alike issue
with the hated with the elevens play by playwork that's all irrelevant at this point
what is relevant is that here is a guy who is incapable of functioning in a setting with a bunch of
other people can't do it can't do it now when the beast comes in the way in later maybe he'd like to
refute some of my comments but I have my doubts you know and the beast will be coming in around what
you said about 12 30 of 30 yeah to get away do his weigh in for balance for life and it's about
time you fat bastard okay this is the beast yeah this is the fat beast and by the way don't forget
about his big promotion there on a qm website with a six thousand rules on there how'd you like
to have a dollar for every word that they've got in the rules on there for the uh beast gets laid
hopefully content ain't gonna happen trust me that'd be a good pulled question though who's
gonna get laid first and now I got a guy even better when uh who's gonna have sex with a woman first
listen the beast Clarence or Neil huh you wait I think I got a shot

A big blackmail of a stationery
It's stuck between a thine
Roll!
You don't think blackmailing a charity is wrong?
You think all the followers are funny?
It's a giant pulsing shlaw
That's a little failed right?
What problem your ass is dying?
Blackmailing someone's a lord?
You think all your names are dying?
You think all your names are dying?
It's cruel!
It's cruel!
You'll be the fit job bank tonight!
I smack your hands and bruise up your body the way you lie

You got to take with no change in that
No!
I have 45.
Remember that scene in the godfather when Sonny is banging it
brought up against the wall?
Right
The door
And Tom Hagen goes to the door.
Remember that?
Yeah
I was just picturing
And screw in right up against the control room door there
Anyway here's the facts from Gill in homestead is becoming a little bit chronic
He says what's the joke of the humming jingle song?
I'm dying to know.
Well, mmmm
And the other question is how Lee Burry is the best looking female actor so I just wrote her down.
Of course you'll get a lot of votes.
Yes.
Although those pictures on the front of that tabloid last month
Remember that?
She was all solid and she wasn't wearing anything.
I mean you can make anybody look ugly.
Look at that picture of the beast on the QM website.
Boy he looks nasty.
Looks like his head is...
Oh that's 14 feet wide.
You wear a suit.
What?
He's wearing a suit in that picture.
How can you tell?
The gutsyed up.
How to help?
Can you possibly tell?
Anyways so there's two votes on the poll so far because they're yours in mind.
I don't know.
Oh who the hell are you?
I guess Eric must have.
He voted for Marilyn Monroe.
And I voted for Jordana Brewster.
I tell you she is really if I were disposed, if I were that ilk you know?
I don't want to vote yet.
My choice isn't on there.
I see.
Well so far we've got Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Jordana Brewster, Elizabeth Taylor,
Bo Derrick and Halle Berry.
Your choice is not on her yet?
Who's your choice?
Denise Richards.
Denise Renee Richards?
Yeah.
Yeah Carlos is making the wishy-washy hand signal.
So Denise Richards?
She's beautiful.
She's the most beautiful actress on TV or in movies of all time.
So why are you voting for Carlos?
Boy I don't know but not her.
Alright.
Little Venus boys says you be ill in.
Yeah what does he know?
Not much.
He knows it gets really cool.
Oh it's big in the weather.
Sonny here today it's going to be all we have to like maybe 26.
I don't mind that.
But I hear it's in the 90s already there.
It's the first weekend march.
When somebody tell the weather for you down there it's only the first weekend march and then the 90s every day is unacceptable.
I see that thing in the sunset and they say oh well we've decided that there's not going to be any spring this year going right from winter to summer.
What the hell is that all about?
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
How are you?
Great.
Question four I was wondering where your friends and was wondering why I haven't heard and tell me that he paints this doesn't paint his ballspot in a while.
Yeah.
What happened to that?
What happened to what?
Paint your ballspot.
I haven't heard it in a coupons age.
Oh that's not true.
We wasn't going on the thing with the best spot.
We didn't even have it on there.
Feel Roger's got it.
I don't have a bone spot.
I don't have a bone spot.
I don't have a bone spot.
I'll think about it.
Yeah.
5607 05 60, 05 60 on the AT&T and Ryzen Wireless Line.
Here's Delray Beach.
Hello.
Hey how you doing?
Okay.
I'll give you a name but I just want to comment on the speech last night if I can do that.
Go right ahead.
Take it all the time you like.
Yeah.
I don't know man.
I'm a young, I'm a young young 23 now.
It just seems to me like he's talking about all this stuff man.
It's all against everything we've taught in school and everything.
We acted like we're terrorists now.
We're attacked over the plate.
That's right.
You know what I mean?
And he keeps talking about this stuff about he's been doing this stuff for 12 years but in the meantime he hasn't attacked anybody in those last 12 years since we kicked him out of Kuwait.
And he hasn't attacked us or killed anybody else that we know over the night.
You know it's it doesn't make any sense.
Let me answer any questions.
He just keeps repeating the same statements over and over again.
Let me answer your question.
Yes sir.
Have we ever gone into war as an attacker before?
In our history?
Yes sir.
Well I mean not just out of the blue like this I wouldn't say would you George?
No we've gone to the rescue of people.
I remember I mean we've gone in and we participated in like international police actions and things like that but in terms of just starting a war and invading another country and saying that we're doing it to remove the leader of the country.
You know we've never done that.
Right and hey I want to vote for I know you're going to disagree but I got to put JLo on him man.
Okay man.
Alright.
See you.
He wants JLo he likes that big ass.
Hey there's a lot of people.
Now I know she was in a movie and Britney was in a movie and we consider I guess JLo.
She has an actor.
Yeah she's got a whole bunch of people.
Okay okay okay Jesus God.
No the reason I mentioned that we talked about that the other day is because Britney.
Yeah.
You know every time you put her on any pull no but it could be with her.
I can understand that but the fact all her Jardinah Brewster is a lot harder than she is.
But the fact of the matter is that she's not an actress just being in one really great Z movie last year does not make Britney a.
But JLo you're right she's been in many movies and take it for what it's worth.
No thank you.
Welcome.
So JLo's on here.
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's Miami.

567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
I love it.
Mad dogs out at the route today where they haven't had any excitement except for this morning Doreen and Moe had a big blow up.
They had the big blow.
Real screaming match I guess.
For the four light words, fifth flying all kinds of crap going on back and forth forth and back.
Mo making all kinds of cost of comments about who are sucking up to fat Hank and oh brother.
And speaking of that fat Hank will be out there throughout through this afternoon.
650.
Now why what is that?
What are we going to do for 10 minutes there?
Yeah, I don't want to get on clearance as that's for damn sure who the hell would.
But these schedules he's making man he must be crumbling out of the pressure.
Because look what it says there it says 3 to 650.
Hank Bloomberg at the rail and we know what Hank likes those short shows.
But then seven o'clock Chitko pants are previewed.
The Panthers at Atlanta 730.
Well what's going on between 650 and 7?
Are we doing transmitter maintenance?
4th.
Are we shutting off the air for like 10 minutes?
Are we going to let Hank go out there and do a big BPM or I mean what's going on?
What kind of a schedule is this clearance?
Oh no.
God any K after the hockey game and ESPN radio overnight because it's Friday.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
Hollywood.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
How are you?
Sensational.
In my opinion the most beautiful woman in the world Catherine Hepburn.
Okay.
Put that on the list.
And Todd Grant come still waiting for you to call me for lunch.
Hold your breath.
Yeah.
Don't call your for lunch the same day that rumor buys George his lunch and the same day Todd brings this new copy for anything.
Catherine Hepburn okay there you go for the oldie moldy crowd.
I'll be honest with you I never thought that she was all that great.
Look I mean he's in total his opinion but it's so much.
Skinny little bird lady.
She was a good actress.
Yeah.
She was a much better actress than Spencer Tracy was an actor Audrey.
Huh?
Audrey was the pretty one.
Catherine was the other one.
Yeah.
She was very but the voice.
Uh huh.
In fact I had an aunt on my father's side who looked a little like Catherine Hepburn.
Real butch looking.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Isn't that ironic that on my father's side were all like all these goyem.
Huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She was married to a goyem and his brother was married to a goyem.
And then of course the other part of the family that all became fanatical Zionist
and moved to Israel.
Oi!
Which led to his mental collapse.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 6 8 T and Verizon wireless line.
Oh man.
He was reminding me.
Oh what is it?
I go right one in.
I go right what?
A name in.
Who is it?
Angelina Jolie.
Okay.
Yes sir.
I'm here today.
What?
Today my birthday.
Oh boy you people are a little pushy.
They do the other guy want to be pushy.
He wants his bald spot and you want to be.
There you go in the left to charge you guys.
I started to call in yesterday but somebody mentioned Jim Henson.
The only two people that ever I don't want to I just want to address the John Linden issue.
Why it was such a go ahead.
Okay.
The thing about John Linden was right before he was killed there were rumors that the Beatles
were going to like get back together and do a performance.
Everybody thought that would be the greatest events and woodstock and that was the shocker
about the lemon thing.
Well there were all kinds of rumors about that.
There were rumors that it was assassinated because he was a subversive kami pinko drug doing
all the other stuff and so they had a hit.
There were all kinds of rumors.
No no no.
I mean as far as why people are so upset about him being killed.
I see.
They could in the Beatles.
That was the fact together as if he was dead.
That's what the thing about.
So in other words it's not that they admired him or his music that much.
It's just that they were selfish and they wanted the Beatles to get back together again.
Yeah that's what I'm saying.
Pretty selfish damn reason if he asked me.
Isn't it?
And Jim and Jim Henson was it's only two people who ever bought him a Hanson because I liked all the voices that he did.
And I thought it was an innovative person.
He did pretty well.
I got ten votes.
Yeah.
And he was only in his 40s.
He died of pneumonia.
They say I've heard of the rumors but they said he died in pneumonia.
And I just want.
I just want to tell George if I had the money George because I'll be over in Amsterdam next week.
If I had the money I had a bunch of tickets you could have gone with this since nobody else wants to we had to get a gather some money together for you.
No way you're going you are going to Amsterdam next week.
I'll be there Wednesday on the damn square walking around.
Where are you going to stay?
Over and I think it's called lead explain is that I like the lights of playing yeah.
Light is playing okay I'll be over in light of playing.
Lights up and now I'm going to walk down to the foot locker and see if I can get you hanging around down there by the Hennacom Brewery.
I used to live not too far from the Hennacom Brewery.
I know where you were.
I used to shop in the same grocery store.
You shopped that I know where you were.
Get out of here.
What grocery was that?
It's around the other side behind the Hennacom Brewery over there.
On the other side of the Hennacom Brewery if you go over to the corner.
You talk about dirt.
Yeah.
I didn't shop there.
No I didn't shop there.
You're just you're just you know you're trying to piece little detective work not good though so the.
Have a great time.
I've got one I storage one question.
Yeah.
If he if he had the money and he could go to Amsterdam.
How would he get out of the country and back in force if he's not a US.
It's a different passport form.
Oh but you can do it.
Yeah.
Well we need to get some money together to let you go buddy.
It's called snicking snicking into the wheel well is what it's called.
Have a great time pal.
Thanks Neil.
I sure wouldn't be traveling this time to Amsterdam.
Would you?
No I don't want I don't want to get in freaked out or anything like that.
And that's something though because I once said that I live not too far from the Heineken brewery and of course this being a chronic and a weird listening hanging on every word.
And so he puts it because he's obviously been over there and he knows that there's a big dirt supermarket right around the corner.
I shopped in there only maybe twice.
I shopped in Albert Heine.
Heineken.
Yeah that's right.
In fact I spent a lot when I was over there.
What do you think I was doing most of the time?
I can't find.
I can't find.
Oh there it is.
One million thousand.
Oh no no.
I finally found what I was looking for.
I went back to that again. God must be punishing me.
I looked up Heineys.
Oh it wasn't even worth it Rick.
Anyway Albert Heine.
That's the big supermarket chain.
So next time he calls in he can tell me he's the shop and to say Albert Heine as I did it said it was so on.
Oh yeah I know where you shopped.
I saw you used to buy it ice cream and crap.
We not had an advantageier reason.
Yeah you're right.
560.
560.
560.
560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
I sure wouldn't be traveling myself out of Amsterdam next week you know what I'm saying?
Or it's not like it's England.
And thank God there's like no Arabs over there too.
My name is Langlo.
This is 440.
560.
You weigh in weigh.
How young is 2 young guy?
This is the time of year.
What everyone's doing.
It's Irish.
Say Colleen.
Would you be wanting to come over to my place to have me a wax my shell.
Oh now that I would my to touch it.
If you be wearing the green.
Sorry though there's a smart lassie.
She's making sure her lab is wearing the telegreen protection of lip for a condom.
Don't be wishing on a forlift clover.
I'll file in for the gift of gab.
Especially if you're planning on kissing some blindy stones.
What have you.
Be doubly in your protection with different condoms.
They're strong enough for a man.
But I like them too.
So, take yourself a different condom.
And you won't be catching anything else.
10 o'clock at 560 WQM Happy Friday to you.
I see a little beater boys doing it to Eric again today.
Really sticking it to your pardon.
Well he's only got four names on the pool.
Yeah.
So somebody is screwing up on because we've gotten like at this point.
Let's see six eight.
We've got like a whole bunch more names.
I email them.
I email them to them after we get like four or five on the list.
Yeah.
Because we have 53 votes on here.
But it's kind of meaningless because they're only choosing among the four names on here.
I just emailed them the last the last one.
I mean, we don't have both Eric.
We don't have Halle Berry.
We don't have Denise Richards.
But George is not very happy with you about that.
We don't have J.Lo.
Stop my fault, you have no taste.
We don't have Catherine Hepburn, which said guys,
and we don't have Angelina Jolie.
And Miguel's going to come up and there and beat the crap out of you.
Beat the snot out of your ass.
Those are the last group that I said that they should be up in a second.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You guys are just diddling around here, man.
We got a big important show going on here to one o'clock.
And you're like a crawl along in a snail's pace.
But at the rate you're going, it'll be one o'clock about four in the morning.
If you follow what I'm saying.
What?
Yeah, in other words, we're going making so little progress.
You are going so goddamn slow.
It'll take us till four or five in the morning to get to be what we're the equivalent of one o'clock.
Don't you see what I'm saying?
No.
Good.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Line.
Who is or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies?
And it shows you I screwed up really big on a one last year.
And I again apologize.
I was jerk.
Grace Kelly is leading with 31.
Of course, that's among the first four.
But even so, and Liz Taylor's got five.
And I left him both off at her last year in a fit of peak.
I don't know.
Just because I thought Tom Wolling was prettier than a lot of them.
And probably he is.
Pretty something.
5, 6, pretty tall.
Pretty tall with pretty big feet.
All that kid's going to be calling it again.
What do you care about Tom Wolling's feet?
Just like that guy down there in wherever he was.
And Kendall wants to know about that.
Yeah, what is that?
What is that?
That's pretty funny.
Can you play that for me?
I'll get it.
There you go.
It is your explanation.
Schmuck.
I'll say Schmuck has her friend Gildon where it is.
Oh, here you go.
Small belt, Kristen Croc.
See, I just got through Sam Tom Wolling, didn't I?
Yep.
And this was already on the way.
Boy, I'm going to tell you.
Seriously, I'm a Schmuck.
Rhymes with Croc.
Now, you were spilling that right K-R-E-U-K.
I don't know.
Kis-Kristen Croc.
Kis-Kristen Croc.
This is UCF Kenny who's also attaching the picture.
Yeah, we don't need a picture.
We know what she looks like.
She's okay.
Notice I didn't fact the picture which just looked like a bug.
God, don't waste my bank paper.
I don't want to.
Okay, what about Audrey Hepburn?
Okay, we got Katherine Hepburn.
You mentioned Audrey.
Okay, no problem.
She sure was a lot prettier than Katherine.
Audrey.
She was in the breakfast at Tiffany's.
Then we just talk about her the other day for what?
For a while.
No, seriously.
What were we talking about?
Audrey Hepburn for.
I don't know.
It was the dead or alive thing.
Was it?
Did we figure out if she still alive Audrey?
I forgot.
That was the death.
Katherine's not.
Katherine's dead.
Linda.
Now what is that?
Linda a Carter?
It's the boss to say Linda and it says Linda.
Oh, jeez.
Linda Carter.
They understand us with a Y but, uh, oh.
Oh, scary.
And it looks like from in your handwriting too.
Sure does that.
Who is that?
I don't know.
Somebody.
That's yours.
I did write Linda Carter.
No, seriously.
But it's somebody, uh, regular that we know.
We're going to trace that.
Let's see.
Look who's winning D'Areal.
Rod pampling anybody ever heard of him?
And it says, no.
Who now is that?
I know D'Areal.
I know Mo but I don't know.
Rod pampling.
Did you ever hear that name in your life?
I wouldn't have.
Don't forget.
Mad Dog and Hank will be out at D'Areal this afternoon.
Got only knows why.
They must be paying a pretty big buck for that.
Let's see.
We invaded Mexico and took most of the US southeast.
Yeah, that's a big point.
I forgot.
President Franklin, Pearson, General Scott.
Protestants invading in a Catholic country.
You're right.
Right on target.
Out of sight out of mind.
Not too embarrassing.
We don't like to talk about those ugly, uh,
chapters in American history.
Okay.
We don't want to get into that.
Jennifer Connelly, Isabella Rosalini and Audrey Hepburn.
Catherine was a good actress but even the beast wouldn't have touched her.
Isabella Rosalini.
Yeah, who's that?
Uh, just a matter of fact, as well as.
Is Isabella Rosalini that at that?
I mean, she's very disliked and famous.
Wait a minute.
I can't wait.
What?
Isabella Rosalini.
I wouldn't call her beautiful.
I mean, she's got a look about her.
Who's that?
Isabella Rosalini.
You're a great guy.
She's a handsome woman.
Yep.
So you don't like her?
I don't think she belongs on the list.
Okay.
Jennifer Connelly.
Jennifer Connelly.
Definitely.
Even.
Even though she's going through something.
I don't know what.
How about John Connelly?
Who?
5'6'7'0'5'60."
He was riding in the car with JFK.
John Connelly.
Oh, right.
And the wrong spot the wrong time.
And how he's dead.
Don't you remember that magic bullet?
Uh-huh.
It went through his hand and broke his wrist.
And it went right up to the president's neck and killed JFK.
It was just an amazing bullet.
It was a wound up on the stretcher at Parkland Hospital.
And it was pristine.
Remember pristine the queen?
It was like brand new, like right out of the box.
Hell of a lot of damage for one little bullet to be in such good shape too.
Okay.
The other names are up there now.
Grace Kelly 32, Marilyn Monroe 15, Liz Taylor 6,
Joanna Brewster 5, Katherine Hepburns got one.
Gotta be from that guy.
Either that or Spencer Tracy came back just long enough to vote.
I'm sorry.
I understand that it's for the old parts, but I still say Spencer Tracy was always the same in every movie.
Yeah.
Father of the bride.
Look who's coming to dinner.
Dr. Jika and Mr. Hyde and, uh, Jessica and Dave Hyde.
Huh?
Not a lot of range.
No, he was always the same.
I'm not saying he was a bad guy.
Maybe he never stole a freight train, but he just, uh,
a good job as that character.
Yeah, whatever that character was.
I think the character was Spencer Tracy.
Here's a call from Oakland Park.
Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
I'm gonna do you.
Uh, my name is Richard Steel Long and, uh,
I'm, uh, uh.
Oh, boy, they're all out today in full force, man.
They're gay.
Yeah.
There he is again.
I wonder if he's related to Mike Oxlong.
Here's Pompato.
Hello.
Pompato.
He home me.
Let me.
Yes, sir.
That was it.
Okay.
A lot of short ones.
You're right.
I know I was right.
Here's Weston.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
It's a good category today.
Uh, tough choice.
Well, we've done it before, but we didn't do it right.
And there's one thing you've got to keep doing until you get it right.
I missed the other one.
It's tough between Shirley Jones and Jane Russell.
And, but I'd have to say, but, well,
she's a very young girl.
She was young.
Well, she really?
Oh, yeah.
She was a pretty David Cassidy.
She was already old then, but my, my vote was good.
Well, okay, thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Who would get the other ones he said?
He had a couple of good ones.
Oh, Jane Russell with a big boobs.
Yeah, that's all that was good about her with all the bra spots.
Huh?
Yeah, she was a real manly looking guy.
She was very macho.
Big boobs, but not a pretty same.
That was kind of the look back then.
The Catherine Hepburn, Jane Russell look.
Mm-hmm.
You know what I'm saying?
Yep.
By today's standards, they would look very macho.
Like, don't crop her.
There's another one.
Oh, yeah.
Real butch with the shoulder pads.
But she knocked a living crap out of you.
Just look at her cross eye.
Give her the show.
Look, I can't afford Betty Davis.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I'm telling you, who was actually a pretty good looking guy,
even though I said the contrary yesterday, it was Warren Beatty.
What was the movie he was in?
He was very young in that movie.
Shampoo.
Now, way before that.
Well, you thought he was a good looking guy in shampoo?
Oh, I said that.
That's not what I said.
Oh, man.
You said what was that movie he made?
No, it was much, much before that.
It was probably one of the first movies ever.
You know, you know those cornball channels I got in there,
like the driving classics and stuff like that?
I can name two movies, three movies he was in.
Shampoo, Dick Tracy and Reds.
Well, it wasn't none of the above.
What about the great one he was in?
We played the...
Technically, Bugsie.
Bugsie.
That's right.
That was not a bad movie.
That was a damn good movie, Bugsie.
That's about the only time I ever liked him.
And it was in Bugsie.
And I'll fall down.
You forgot that.
Yeah.
With Carl Maldon's nose and Brandon DeWilder in Black and White.
Oh, gee.
Why do they have to make movies in Black and White then?
What are you laughing about?
Well, that's not a laughing matter.
And you're who's also in that movie, all fall down.
I don't know.
Even with a restant, I believe.
Wasn't she?
I don't know.
No.
She was in on the waterfront with Marlon Brando.
She was beautiful too, even with a restant.
Get out of here with that crap.
All that fag crap you keep playing.
What's wrong with you?
I think the audience is catching on to your crap.
All fall down.
There's the Andromeda stain on most pants.
Boy, so Doreen and him really got into it, huh?
Yeah, they did.
All through the night, all the presidents' men, all this for that, all spare.
What am I looking for?
I'll fall down.
Now, what's the reason I can't find it?
No problem because it's not on that page.
Yeah, even with a restant, like I said.
Angela Lansbury was in it.
And Barbara Baxley, I have no idea who that is.
Angela Lansbury, wasn't she?
Didn't she play on Idri Magini?
She was in Bednabs and broomsticks.
Maybe that's what she was.
She was somebody's mama.
She was your mama, one of those shows.
Maybe it was bewitched.
All right.
Right?
I don't remember.
Angela Lansbury.
She's another one.
I always looked.
She was kind of like Tabithon.
Where did she go?
No, no.
Is that Angela Lansbury?
Yeah.
Oh, I can't remember the movie Stamson and Delilah.
Oh, I can't stand her Angela Lansbury.
And that's right.
She is murdering her, it wrote.
Yeah.
Oh, she's not going on my list.
And she was Mrs. Potton.
Maybe we should have a list of you.
One day we'll do a poll of the Butchers looking actress in history.
That would be good.
All right. Get it, Rita.
She's an actress.
Sometimes.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What about the feel, all right?
Oh, what about the feel, all right?
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
CAPRIN HEPPERIN DEAD
Orgory Hepburn
Did we decide she's still alive?
I don't think so.
No no no.
Look that went up, Carla's!
Do something useful.
Can't remember.
She's dead.
Yeah, orgory Hepburn is dead.
Ah no.
How about she died a long time ago and we forgot about it?
Anybody on, let's see, Rick, how well she's still alive?
a feel or endless still pretty good in Barbara Eden. This is the Montgomery's not still alive.
Yeah, but she's also not going on the list. She wasn't, Tammy, she was nice and we liked her
a lot. Beauty, right? She wasn't a beauty. And a beauty. She was a beauty, but not a beauty.
And she did a hell of a dirty duty to her country by doing that show is what I was trying to say.
And then it was Darren. We had two Darren's. We had Darren with the funny nose and then we had
the other Darren who came out of the closet later on. The two dicks. Dicks Sergeant and Dick York.
York. All right. Far we on top of it today or what? We got a baby. Of course nobody
y'all has any idea what we're talking about. We're just rambling today. Go like it. Bye bye. Too bad.
Nice dex down 12 and a half. Well, look at that. Oh, Germany says they're skeptical of UK's
deadline plan. Did you see that? Good. Yeah, they're. You might mention my name to rice,
master Gary. Okay. How the world has turned that the Russians and the Germans are the voice of
and the chinks. Yeah. Yeah. The that was only down 57 of the Nasdaq.
Contents. So maybe they'll make a little comeback. What do you think? No. Maybe they're making a
and of course you know how fast this stuff comes back. The mature show is just telling me. Yeah,
this stuff comes back so fast. So while you pour bastions out there, they're waiting for your
two cent comms to come back and all the other tech crap that those are grave rubber sodium. Oh,
have no fear. It comes back so fast. Like grease lightning up the churches ass.
Let's see. My poll vote was from Maryland. No, Rose is Tracy. My poll suggestion is for Charlize
Theron. She's a Maryland-esque glamour and beauty. Excellent choice. Charlize, they've all
already done in a minute. What about Catherine Zeta Jones? Yeah. Beautiful.
Face beautiful accent. I thought it was going to say beautiful ass. Rosalind Sanchez, rush hour
two. Look around Puerto Rican and Leonor Valeria. Blade two. You see a common thread here? Yeah,
no idea. Leonor Valeria. Never heard of people. You know what? No, but you nobody else has either.
What do you mean? It says look around. You look around. Rosalind, which I'm sure that's not how
anybody spells it, but nevertheless. Rosalind. Well, here it says Rosalind. Okay. How about the
Rosalind? What's your name? Carter. Yeah. Grace Kelly's leading. She's got 41 votes.
Maryland on Roaster to move up. 19 Liz Taylor's got 10 and Bo Derek's got two big ones.
10 14 at 5 60 WTQM on a very bizarre Friday. It's just not going to be the same as usual because
of that. All that stuff out there this morning with Doreen and Mo and Mo and Doreen. I mean,
we're out there in public, you know? They're out there in public putting the radio station on
this place. Supposedly put their best foot forward. There's Mo yelling, you asshole, you asshole,
you asshole. And Doreen walking around getting psychotic. It's about time she struck back though.
You know, nice going Doreen. She moved up many notches in our estimation today, didn't she? You
asshole. That's right. Taking on the momeister and telling him right to his push,
what a grouchy old piece of turd he is. I want to tell you about a great place. Delights at West

Twenty after ten at five sixty W.C.
Hundred and six votes on the survey
Who is or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies
Grace Kelly forty five, Marilyn Monroe twenty, Elizabeth Taylor eleven, Bo Derek eight,
Halle Berry be heaven seven
Now I want to say this about Kristen Crook
Okay and I'm very glad we got people to watch smallville
Can you believe I just cracked a window?
Why not?
I just cracked a window a little bit to get some fresh air in here
Instead of a hundred degrees in here at least
Miles one thing about how cold it's been?
Yeah
You don't have to worry about it being toasty in here
In fact you could burn toast in here
It's a little on the toasty side
Even when you turn the internal well I want to go into it
But anyway the air quality is eighteen
That's in a good range and the temperature is
The sun is shining there's a couple of puppy clouds in there
The temperature is it's coming
Haze, purple haze, and the temperature is...
On the case, minus six
Which is what about twenty?
But turn!
So anyway even though it is a little on the toasty side
I just cracked a window to get some fresh air
And now I feel almost human
But anyway getting back to Kristen Crook
She's cute
Yeah
It's exotic
But not stop
What?
I mean then we can put Phoebe Katsun here too
We're gonna put her on here?
Why not?
Okay
Okay
If we put Phoebe Katsun in there we gotta put brick shields
Okay
Brook shields is a lot more beautiful than Phoebe Kats
Sure
And since they were both in those two movies, Paradise and...
What do you have there?
Blue, Blue, Zgoon
Okay, well I'm trying to talk at the same time
I have a Katsun Brook shield
But Kristen Crook, she's cute
But the question is who is or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies?
That's a good point
Of all time, huh?
It's a good point
I didn't vote for Kristen, Kristen, Kristen
She's cutesy, you know?
She's cutesy like, you know?
But I mean to say that she's beautiful
She has no boobs at all, none
Okay, I'll check and get back to you on that
I'm telling you she...
You don't have to check
She's got no breasts at all
None, even Tom always got bigger boobs than she's got
I like to be thorough
Okay
You can laugh and make a big joke out of it
I know my boobs, Mr. Believe me
I work with plenty of them
Not to mention no names
Anyway, here's the list so far
Grace Kelly Merlin Monroe, Jordana Brewster
How's she doing Jordana?
Six
See most people know who she was
If they know who she was, she'd be giving Grace Kelly a run for her money
She'd drive her right off the road
Oh, that's bad
Liz Taylor, Boddara, Cali Buried
Denise Richards, J. Low, with that big fat
Captain Hepburn
Angelina Jolie, Kristen Crook
Audrey Hepburn, Rest in Peace
We miss you Audrey
We like you, you're okay
She was in breakfast, activities, and what else?
Why is that? That's the only one I know
She was in a lot of movies
But Linda Carter, Superwoman, right?
Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman
Jennifer, Jennifer
Well the reason I'm saying that is because
Catwoman was on with Batman yesterday
I don't miss my Batman between 5 and 6 p.m
I'll tell you that two episodes back to back on Adventure TV
Was it the Julie Newmar, the Eartha Kit, or the
What was the third one?
It was not the Eartha Kit one
Julie Newmar, the Tall one?
Yeah, I guess
Jennifer Connolly, Raquel Welch, Sophia Loran, Barbara Eden,
Charlize Theron, Catherine Zeta, Zeta Jones, Phoebe Kates, and Bushield
I think this is a pretty good list
In fact, I bet you that the Beast would mind having the
Attendees living ones, even a couple of dead ones
Show up for the runoff for his contest
They're on March 26th
That's a hoot, that's a real panic
At least some of our people
They're got a sense of humor
I think that they're going to get the Beast laid
In fact, this is good of a chance
That'd be a good poll question
Who's going to have sex with a woman first?
Gilbert, the Beast, Clarence or Neil?
Huh?
Or Freaky Carlos?
Oh, and here's my good friend Phil Sotsman
How you doing Phil?
Hi, Neil, how are you?
I wish Bill Carlos would have told you you were on it
I wouldn't have liked you waiting for hours and hours
Well, I waited a long time but I thought I had something contribute today
First of all, I think that Warren Baby looked his best when he was in Bonnie and Clyde
Okay
He was very handsome in that one
I didn't know that you cared, but anyway
I think
Yeah
But anyhow, also I think that Rosalini is a Bella Rosalini is as beautiful as a mother
Ingrid Bergman
Oh, I don't agree
I did not know that Ingrid Bergman was her mother
Of course Ingrid Bergman was a lot of people's mother
And she was married to a couple of the fathers
She was married to a few of the fathers but she also made beautiful kids
No wonder they burned her with a stick
The last thing I wanted to say was please don't leave Kim Novak off that list
Because he was without question
I know I'm dating myself
No, no, it's not bad, it's like that you're sneaking a whole bunch of names on here
You've caught on to the fact you don't
No, Kim Novak by herself
Yeah
Not even close
Yeah, you're right, she was great
Who are just women?
I think she went both ways by the way
Really?
I'm not sure
Well, it was a little cutesy, said movies and TV
Oh, it was a little cutesy, it kind of lost its flavor on a bedpost after you sent it
Okay, listen, take care of yourself, Bill, everything okay?
Yeah, everything is wonderful, hope all's well with you
Great fight last night in Toronto games
Yeah, they lose every day, at least they're consistent now, they lose every day
They also beat the crap out of everybody every day
Yeah, well, if you know what my keenness is if you can't play good just beat the crap out of everybody
Take care of yourself, Bill
You too, Bill, take care
Bill Saltsman, our good friend of Oyster Calder Race Track
I should ask him again how come that Vick Stoffer got the job at Gulfstream
That's just really frosted my ass and also doing races out in California
Vick Stoffer, he must have naked pictures of John Brunetti or somebody
He's got naked pictures of Doug Don and John Brunetti, forcing around
Yes, he goes both ways radio and TV and movies
5, 6, 7, there's the UN, the UN report
Earlier today as we await the stuff
They're getting together there, they're going to be up and down
What some of the suspicions are the community's top files that the Iraqi government may have
Let's put that up on the screen
Put it up
1,000 weapons for delivery of chemical and biological aid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't think they're going to get it, do you think it's going to go through?
No
Do you?
No
Whatever the resolution is going to be, it just didn't going to happen
Just not going to happen because there's just too many people against it
And like he said last night we don't care, we're going right on in
We're going to ram our way in there, we're going to knock down the door
Just like remember in the elections office in Dade County back in 2000
Let us in, let us in
I'm going to be knocking sit on his door right down, that's right, he's going to have those same guys over there
Knock on sat on his door down
Let us in
I wonder how many chances he's got hanging, probably from his...
Back to him
And you know something then they'll get there and hey we got Sodom, oh no it's not ready him
Because he's got about 15 doubles
Right?
Even Rodgers, even Rodgers Hornsby never hit as many doubles as Sodom who's saying
They all look like him over there, they have a mustache, they look like him
And the thing that proves to me that Bush is full of it is they don't have the right headgear to be our enemies
So as much as he says, right?
They just don't have the right headgear
Anyway, 28 past 10 at 560 WQM just rolled them along, have it a great time
Oh I feel so invigorated now with the window open in here, I bet it's like 14 below zero and here already it's great

10-31-560 WDQAM
Here's a long list of names and it says having said all of these will still look for Grace Kelly
Well, that's a good choice
She's winning hands down your pants man 53 she was
Pristigling
Strikingly beautiful
Yes, she was perfect
She didn't have a pimple on her, you know
That's the way I look at Grace Kelly
Just magnificent looking
Anybody ever see her rear window?
And then of course when you stop and think about the fact she was in that movie with Jimmy Stewart
I mean, you know Jimmy Stewart and everybody liked him
He was, you know, I still think he's overrated
But nevertheless, I mean Jimmy Stewart and
Grace Kelly, you know
Yeah
And I'll tell you who else I still think is beautiful on TV
And I wish they all knew her name and maybe someone the passions people were calling
And I'll put her on the list
The actress that plays Sheridan on passions
She has every bit as beautiful as Grace Kelly
One, not a pimple on her anywhere on her body
She's got beautiful, great body
She's gorgeous
Sheridan
Got it, they even named a street in Hollywood actor
You never saw her, I didn't know
What is wrong with you? I mean just to take a peek
You know which one she was right away
I don't know if the volume off and the characters come and go
I don't know if they did
You know her immediately
She would be on you
Oh my god, you say holy cow now I know he's right
Mackenzie Westmore
Is that her name?
I think so, let me double check that
Double check, make sure we get the right name of the actress who plays Sheridan on passions
Because I think anybody out there would agree with me that it's pretty damn hard to beat her with a stick
What's her name again?
Mackenzie Westmore
Mackenzie Westmore
Mackenzie Westmore
Okay, put her on her
Now here's the other ones that I put on her since Phil called but she had about 400 of his own
Since Brooke Shields we got Isabella Rosalini, Ingrid Bergman, Kim Novak, Jean Tierney
You got these?
Kids
And Jean Tierney that's GE&E, now how come a woman was named GE&E?
I don't know, I haven't got that time
What?
Happens all the time
Does it really?
I thought Jean for a woman was GE&E and I thought Jean was like a guy like Jean Pitney
No?
Well anyway, Jean Tierney
Catherine De Nouve
Okay
What?
Nothing, try to write fast
Catherine De Nouve
Definitely
Do you remember that spot you used to do?
I'm Catherine De Nouve
That you do it in the D-D-D-D-Nouve?
Yes
And Margaret, that's what the hyphen by the way, Elvis did her, so allegedly
I don't think Elvis did, I don't know, I don't really wonder about him, you know a lot
Of course he did Mama, he slept with Mama for 20 years
And Mackenzie Westmore who plays, we don't have to put on her Sheridan, something in parentheses
So they know who she is
Or just put passions in parentheses, okay?
Or Sheridan from passions?
Or she's on like an Efton and an NBC on it, she'll have that Neo Watches called passions
How about putting on her picture up next to it?
There you go
Okay, let's see Michelle Fyfer
Somebody says, Honor Fax
What?
Nothing, that's a sure
Oh, it entered day much better than anything, then he switches could hope to be
Oh please
Okay, Michelle Fyfer, put her on it
Don't stuck it into a snit, boys
Now let's see, here's the facts from the rabbi
The most beautiful actress on TV, Pam Greer
Now who's Pam Greer?
Black did a lot of those black exploitation movies, Cleopatra Jones kind of movies, she's got huge boobs, no ugly face, huge boobs
Well, no, we're not talking about who's got the biggest boobs, okay?
Because then Fat Boy would certainly win that in the Beast to be second
Winnie?
He says, one day he should do a pull on celebrities who should just close shop and go away, for example, lies a mannelly
I can still hear that trill howl in my ears from the promos they ran for a recent concert
That's not a bad idea rabbi, even though we're not too fond of you, but that's not a bad idea
Why don't we like him?
Was he always picking on you the rabbi?
I don't know
Says you were a virulent anti-Semite? Well, George don't mind that, he says the truth counts for a lot
Okay, so there's the list as we've got it so far, just add Michelle Fyfer, you got her?
Yeah
We're gonna have like 75,000 choices to keep you busy over the weekend, all right?
I'm serious, you have got to see Sheridan on passions, is there anybody?
I wish that we had more women listen to this show, because most guys, except for a few of his fans, don't watch soap operas
And at least in which most guys work anyway, and they're not home near a TV set when they can watch soap operas even if they wanted to
See what I'm saying?
But I guarantee if most guys saw Sheridan, they would say, holy cow, that'll will fag his right, she's pretty god damn hot
Here's a call from poor Lauderdale, ho
He's poor, she doesn't really part
Ah, you know yesterday he couldn't get through even once
He couldn't even get through once yesterday, so that means he's been dialing for a day and a half and he finally got through again
They all hate you sir, they hate you like poison
But congratulations on living another day and swacing all that oxygen
Call him sir, he's like 12
To sir with love
What about Sidney Patti, he was pretty
Oh that's right
Pretty dark
Guess who's coming dinner, they see who comes back to that again
And guess who Spencer Tracy was playing in that movie?
Spencer Tracy
Right
I don't know, and of course nobody, we don't have enough old farts around to argue with me about that because in his day
He was considered like, oh, right Spencer Tracy is the greatest actor, and based on what?
Based on what?
Based on the fact that he was always the same, I mean he was like very natural
I'll tell you who's natural, who's great
He might be the greatest actor of all time, this is good enough credit, is Robert Duval
Right?
He's just great, hmm?
Ervy role that he plays is just, he's fabulous
You still, you gotta lift that scene out of apocalypse now
Because it's hysterical, you don't know what to do
And he acts so effortlessly, in other words, he does everything like, so natural
As a matter of fact that scene epitomizes what you're saying
Because you wouldn't think that he was anything other than that character
And I'll tell you another movie that I'm surprised that more and more people, because it was a, had a cult following
And they changed the name of the great Santini, which was the ace, and then they changed the name of the great Santini
But more and more people have seen that, and they think it's a great movie, which it is
Bull, Bull Amitum, what's that name?
Right
And then what's your name that played the wife?
I love her, I can't think of what her name is
That was a hundred years since I saw her
No, come on, you know who the, who the actress was?
She wasn't beautiful or anything like that, and I blive danner
Was that her name?
Yeah, Bull, Bull, Bull, Bull, Bull, Bull, Bull, Bull
Who's mother, is she? Rosanna danner?
Here's Pembroke Pines, hello
How you doing Neil?
Okay
You have to add one, Ava Gardiner
Ava Gardiner was beautiful
She, she still be alive, if that guy didn't push her off the boat
She got pushed off about two
Remember what's her name? That guy Robert
I was thinking of Natalie Wood
No, no, you're thinking of Natalie Wood was the first Robert Wagner
Yeah, Natalie Wood should be on her too properly
Okay, thank you, Sir Ava Gardiner was once very defranceton after by the way
And, and, you notice yesterday in the pool about the
Goodbye old blue eyes, you finally died
Welcome back to the right, tack as they chew you up
From your kiskeys to the worms in your tongue
Now that your life is done
You won't need your gun, cause you leave him busy
Staring the sauce for you with the pound of kukukababoo
And your appearing tonight at the sands in the sky
You thank Jackie Kerenlundsby
And we tell our heart, we'll know where all the other drugs will be
On HB, Ava Gardiner will be about your life
And see the guy complain about us anymore
What the hell for you died
Goodbye old blue eyes, say hi to the guys and give our big dogs to Sammy G and Tana and Cartoon
For saving drunker air by using his hair
We tacked your casket with some things
That you also bring like, socked artists for the narrow along with some booze for Dean
And the pair of glasses for Mowgree
Wish you could shoot him by time but look at who survived
Ava Gardiner will steal a line
And that's what Joey love is a lie but only looks like that
Have a tooth to prove he's more the unskilled broad to say
We need to fix a head shut, Sammy Mowg
But I've been trying to be your kid
I'll tell you what, the hands blick, I would be starting his own car if I was him right now
He's doing his report at the UN, you know, on the inspections
We also expect to add low level, close area surveillance through drones provided by Germany
He said something about Lodron
But anyway, he says that they're able to do inspections at any time and they can show up unexpected
No problem at all in their getting tremendous cooperation and that is not what El President
He wants to hear him saying
That is not what Roland Kohlin wants to hear him be saying
You know they have those remote control car starters now
That's what I'm thinking for Hans Blix, no dirty tricks like it says on S-Knowtrix
Tricks of her kids
Yeah, no tricks for Hans Blix, please
He's saying a lot of stuff that they are too crazy about here and I guarantee you
Anyway, Sean and Hollywood Facts is here
He says I think you're a little hasty in the valuation of Angela Landsbury
People are created with a nosy old bag from murder she wrote but may forget that she gave one of the most delightfully sinister performances ever as Lawrence Harvey's evil mom
In the mentoring candidate
That's correct
As to the mother bit, you may be thinking of Agnes Morehead
I do that every damn time I'm in
I may not be good but I'm consistent
I'm consistently full of crap
Okay, that's because of that first stroke you had
That might be the bad one
This one was no picnic either believe me
It was a pulmonary, what do they call it?
Pulmonary embolism
Oh, there it is. It cuts off the, you know, little luck luck gets in you long cuts off the oxygen your brain for a few seconds and like
Like what?
What?
What, I just say more head? Hey, everybody wants more head, even Agnes
Yeah, Agnes Morehead played her mother in door, and uh huh
And Dora
Right, Splendor and a Grass was the Horn 18 movie that Warren Beatty was in, right?
Also, please consider for the list, Ingrid Bergman
It says no young man ever saw those eyes and didn't whack off at least once we already got her on there
In fact, we've got her tied to the steak
And we're gonna make it like medium well
And for my girlfriend Ashley Judd, good choice
It says am I being overly understanding when she asked me leave the room when Ashley Judd appears on the screen
In other words, this is Charden and Hollywood
When he sees Ashley Judd, he pulls his
Pud
Here's one that says how about Kate Jackson or Tom Cruise
Yeah, they both got a pretty but I'm putting Kate Jackson down
What do you think Tom Cruise? Hey Tom, we don't we don't have any way of proven it but we just think
You're gay
Okay, because you've had too many press conferences to the contrary
We don't know it for sure and we're certainly out of serving it but there are those people who believe
You're gay
Okay, Tommy
What a silly guy
He just turned out to be a silly goose and I think most of us like Tom Cruise in the beginning, you know
Right
He was used kind of like, well he wasn't some fun movies and frisky business was cute and at the losing it
And you know stuff like that, I never took him seriously as an actor
Right, but we kind of liked him
He was kind of a likable goofball and once once he started holding his 5,000 press conferences
And suing everybody just because they said he's a fag, you know, it starts getting a little bit suspect
How is the pull coming glad you asked?
Who is or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies?
Grace Kelly 56
Marilyn Monroe 21
Halley Berry 15
Liz Taylor 15
13
Board Derek 11

Rack Hellwell's 8, Rams with great and late Angelina Jolie 7
So Fiela Renn 6, she's got to do better than that
Catherine Hepburn and Barbara Eden and Catherine Zeta Jones, he's have five
Jennifer Lopez 4 from the Puerto Rican crowd
From the I like the big ass crowd which means your people as well, I'm sure
Jennifer Connelly 4, Linda Carter 3, Cherice Theron, Charlize Cherice
What about Sid Cherice?
Who?
You don't even know who from Sid Cherice do you see that goes to show you but a punk you are
Yeah, good
Oh, Charlize Theron's got three and then poor Audrey Hepburn who's still dead
She's only got a pair and then it's the small potatoes after that
I want to change my vote because I just fact you a name that's on the set in
Yeah, Vivian Lee
Vivian Lee from Gone With The Wind
Was the most beautiful actress on TV or the movies was Vivian Lee?
Possibly
Okay, L.E.I.G.H. by the way, Carlos or whoever's writing these down
Vivian Lee
I still say let's put Pinkie Lee on one of these
He couldn't crack the list yesterday
And I got one on here that nobody mentioned yet which is definitely got to be on here
Out of equal time Susan Day
Hmm, I like you one
I'm not accepting, I don't really care what you think, Susan Day
Because in my day believe me
Everybody watched the cartridge family because they wanted you to see David Cancini or Susan Day
And I thought she was hot
Susan Day, D.E.Y. plus I feel bad for her because you got beat up all the time
Yeah, but she at least she always looked like she was battered and abused
And plus the fact that she was still as a complex over the fact that he had much better hair and she did
Let's see, here's one that says, oh I see somebody planted this seed in your mind, huh?
Yeah, speaking of seed, how about penny Duke?
Not just a joke, okay
I was gonna say more than you
How about Brett Summers?
No thanks
Let's see, here's Vivian Lee also his black-danner mother of Kenneth Pounder
That's what I was gonna say, yeah
I thought Audrey Hepburn was dead and Catherine Hepburn was alive
Oh, that's right and tw-
Thank you Donna and you've got your thumb on it, she's got all the accurate information
So Catherine Hepburn is still alive and twitching in New York, that's terrible
Is it?
You know you're gonna have to play that bit again now
Oh, not this one
And now the sound of Jimmy Stewart making love to Catherine Hepburn
Oh, wow
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'll tell you a couple of people I get confused speaking of, obviously, Catherine Hepburn
Not that I confuse them, but just as far as they're alive
Is the two sisters Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave, okay?
Because one of them we like which I think that's Lynn
All right, and Vanessa's the one who's like she's busy protesting in the world
But she's also like the I don't know what she's just a rabble rouser, right?
Tommy Pinko bitch. Okay. If I got those right or not. Yeah, but I don't know which is which
You know what I'm saying? I don't know what point is the rabble rouser
See that's what I'm trying to say Lynn Redgrave who I think used to be on a pyramid all the time with Dick Clark. Yeah

Hunts blicks if he wants a better live out of this he says they need more inspectors to ensure doing a good and thorough job all
This is not at all what ill president. He wanted to hear him be saying is allowed the determination

We were that that Luis McGell is not only big in Hispanic but also in Italian and he was singing like in Spanish
I believe I wasn't paying that much attention, but it was definitely him
Greatest voice in the history of the world. There is nobody even close to Luis McGell
That's not my opinion that is a fact
Don't pay any attention what George tells you or anybody else that is a fact
The greatest voice in the history of mankind. Now. I'm not talking about whether we can sing or not
At least you can say he's a lounge act

You know who's a great actor which nobody's gonna know except a few old parts. Bokeh Brian will know who I'm talking about

The heart.
Alright.
1102 at 560.
In case you didn't let you miss some real fireworks before our show this morning.
Well, they wouldn't have heard them on here anyway.
No matter what some of the fallout of it though.
Out there at the ral the most exciting thing that's happened during the entire
derailleur tournament this week was the big brawl between Doreen and the
Mollmeister.
Too bad we don't have the audio from that.
You know, we probably, of course you'd probably take a week to put all of these into it.
Before we...
You asked for.
It was nasty.
You asked for.
So he's evidently alienated the very last person in the building who might actually even
speak to him voluntarily and just pissed her off big time and made all kind of
cost to comments about how she was sucking up to fat hank out there and
said everything and so on but wouldn't take care of him.
Well, if you were her or anybody else would you take care of him?
No.
In fact, I think by his ever in behavior in the last year I think there are a lot of
people who would like to take care of him if you against my drift.
Anyway, here's the fact that says how about Nikki Cox for the pool says Jason?
Yes.
She was the hot red head on the on the sitcom Unhappily Ever After.
Also, we had a own show called Nikki or Nikki on the WB.
Says George should know who she has enjoyed already said...
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, Nikki's Cox, we got that on there, Carlos.
We do now.
Now you put these on or is he doing it?
Oh, Carlos has to go through a whole big song and a dancing male in them but he's doing it.
Little Boeena Boy?
Yes.
Oh yeah, he's probably put a couple of caustic messages on there for Eric like I'm doing this better than you can and all that stuff.
But don't forget, on the weekend I should mention this since Carlos and I make so much work for ourselves on the weekend.
And now we put new stories, new bedtime stories on our website on the weekend, which we started doing it last week.
And at a pretty nice response to them, I bet it's even bigger this weekend.
Huh?
Instead of just being lazy and leaving the same damn dated stories on there, which is no good,
especially the kind of stuff that's happening in the world now.
So you can count on every Saturday and Sunday except on our vacation with George is too lazy to do it.
Saturday and Sunday you'll get new bedtime stories on neoargers.com.
It's Yosel Boss.
And I have two packages, not one but two packages downstairs.
Why should go down right now and get them, you know?
Okay.
No, I'm not going to do that. I have to get dressed.
You have to place them along once you're crappy.
I got it.
You got it.
Faggy disco crap.
Right.
Oh, shake your shake your booty.
He's speaking right now.
If he wins, there's nothing.
And then he gets something on the shake your booty.
He's akin to a shake, my hammer.
Will you kill that crap already?
Or are you going to talk it up?
I'm not going to do it.
A woman who slipped on dog feces and her to rank a while she was shopping at Pet Smart store in Frankfurt, Kentucky.
Uh, deserves a jury trial.
The Kentucky Court of Appeals rule today.
She slipped on dog crap.
The Boone Circuit Court granted Pet Smart a summary judgment in September 2001.
And dismissed Vicki Jenkins claim that store owners were negligent in her fall.
Oh, God, did she fall from it or in it?
Oh!
Woohoo!
Jenkins had testified in the original case that she shopped at the store at least once a week for about six years
and never encountered animal feces or urine on the floor.
And now she urines to sue them.
She told the court on April 23, 1999, April 23.
She was shopping at the store, was not looking where she was going when she stepped in the feces and slipped.
Pet Smart argued that because Jenkins acknowledged that feces were out in the open and she could not say how fresh it was, they should not be...
Ha, ha, ha!
They should not be responsible for her fall, how fresh it was.
You stick a turkey thermometer in it.
Oh, my God!
To determine the freshness.
On sale today, fresh feces.
Which species?
From the canine species.
The store also maintained that since she had shopped there for so long she should have been aware that animals were printed to walk around with their owners.
And of course, any animal every now and then.
I mean, not like a horse that just lifted its tail in it.
Does a big number, but a dog every now and then.
A little more obvious.
The store also maintained that since she had...
Yeah.
The appellate court disagreed with the circuit court decision to dismiss the case in a three to zero decision.
The court ruled that there are enough questions that a jury should decide the outcome of the case.
It is wholly reasonable for a customer to be pursuing merchandise on shelves lining the aisles through which she is walking,
instead of focusing solely on the surface beneath her feet the court ruled.
Additionally, Petz Mart's duty...
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
To keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition must be examined.
Let's go examine their duty.
You first.
And evaluated in light of the special nature of the risk the customer's safety inevitably created by the presence of animals.
They said,
or,
talk about a big cemist man, give her a few bucks and just cut the crap already.
We didn't go clean enough while you were at it.
God.
Kind of stuff that people get involved in.
You know it's enough to make your uptruck.
Interviews.
5-670560, pound 5-6-the-honey-h-e-t-of-d, and Verizon line.
Here's Carl Gables. Hello.
Hey Neil, how you doing this morning?
All right.
All right, that's good.
Thank you.
Two things.
First, did you see that poll yesterday about any Democrat versus Bush?
Yeah, I talked about that.
Any anybody would win, yes?
That was great.
And second of all, I have three women for you.
First, do you remember Christian Appal
from Marywood Children?
Yes.
Betty Boop.
And Davey Phu, not Betty Boop.
That's Betty Page.
And Davey Phu, and Tess.
Okay.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
What do you say?
Betty Boop.
Betty Phu, I don't think Daisy Phuentes has been in a movie.
Actually, she's been on TV.
She's been hosting shows, does that count?
Yes.
Okay.
The poll again is, who is the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies?
She's on TV.
So, ding-dong.
There you go.
And what about Carmen Moranda?
Are we putting her on her?
Carmen Moranda?
No, that's just joke.
Christina Appalgate?
Yeah, Daisy Phuentes.
And Betty Boop.
And Betty Boop.
And Betty Boop.
Who is in the movie with Joanna Brewster?
Jordana.
Carmen Diaz.
Oh, Carmen Diaz.
You want to put her on her?
I don't think so.
You do?
I mean, I'm not a big fan of hers.
I mean, I like her personally, and she's a good character in movie.
Okay.
But I don't think she's like a ravishing beauty or nothing that way.
Carmen Diaz.
Her name is Carmen Diaz.
I'm Carmen.
Sorry, yeah.
What's wrong with you, little Boa?
God, are you an idiot?
Carmen Diaz.
The water they took away your spot under the overpass.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound fire.
Yeah, that's really something.
But the other homeless people won't share with you the spots under the overpass they kick your ass out.
They take away your permit.
They're jealous of my genius.
Here's for Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Neil.
How are you?
Great.
I have a name for the, uh, the Liz Brookberg from the E Channel.
Who is it?
Brook Burke from the E Channel.
She came to Allen Burke.
And I was surprised George didn't recommend Jackie Johnson.
Yeah, how come about what's wrong with it?
Weather, babe?
Jackie Johnson.
Jackie Johnson.
I want to change my vote.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, pal.
I won't get up, right?
You did it.
Thanks.
Okay.
There's a lot sharper in you hour.
Tell you that.
How could you leave off Jackie Johnson?
Obviously, out of sight out of my, you don't watch Channel 7 News.
I'm sure.
No, only when he did you sure wouldn't admit to it.
Jackie Johnson, Channel 7 News, uh, Weather, babe.
Mm-hmm.
Brooke Burke, Cameron Diaz.
Christina Applegate, Daisy Fuentes, Nikki Cox.
Those are the most recent editions.
How they, how's the poll coming?
As we continue putting it together, like an erector said.
249.
And look at all the ones that have zero so far.
Oh, that's sad.
Jane Russell doesn't have any.
She used to have two big ones.
Yeah.
That's what I was talking about.
And Margaret Jean, Tierney, Brooke Shields, Ingrid Bergman.
Oh, these all have none.
And lots more, too.
Ashley Judd, Vivian Lee.
How, how can you say Vivian Lee?
Oh, come on.
You didn't see Gone with the Wind?
I have several times.
Oh, my God!
She was beautiful.
Susan De, Winner's Paltrow or Tippie Headroom.
They all of those have none.
Zero.
Even when she was older.
Oh, I got good news.
Mackenzie Westmore Sheridan from Passions got one.
Oh!
This is my challenge, which I've been challenging you for months
and you just refused to do it because you know I'm going to be right.
Is to watch Passions.
In fact, you know something.
Watch it today.
She says she's on a lot today.
Okay.
Yesterday, I saw the one that you'll see today.
NBC between two and three.
Okay.
She's on a lot today.
I think.
Okay.
You'll lower her right away.
You won't have to turn the audio on.
It will not be a tabitha of the witch, by the way.
It will not be her.
And you will also get to see Tabitha's body parts flying all around
as she comes unglued, which parts all of them are ahead.
Her legs.
They're all like, they all come because she's a witch.
Okay.
Has to go on the book of spells and find the right spell to put her body back together again.
But anyway, yes, what's the silly show?
Mackenzie Westmore Sheridan from Passions got one.
Kim Novak, Kristen Crook, and Eva Gardner each have one.
Isabella Rosalini's got a pair.
Natalie Woods got a pair.
They're floating out there in the at sea.
In fact, you know something.
I'm surprised that they didn't keep her a drift for a while.
Oh.
Phoebe Cates, Linda Carter, each have three.
Hey, I got news for Robert Wagner in his day, boy.
In those days, he was a lot prettier than she was than Natalie Wood.
The young Robert Wagner.
Oh, whoo.
Charlie Starrin's got four Michelle five for five.
Aubrey Hepburn five.
Catherine Hepburn is still alive.
She's got five.
Jalos got five.
Jennifer.
Kamli's got six.
Angelina Jolie's got eight.
Barbara Eden's eight.

Now this damn thing's changing again.
Just one thing I'm getting caught up.
Angelina Jolie's got nine.
And Catherine Zeta Jones nine.
Jordan Ann Abruster's got ten.
Oh, I want to commend this audience.
I'm finally getting their ass together.
Okay?
Jordan Ann Abruster's got ten.
She is so goddamn beautiful that I'm telling you.
You'd like to like just have several meals right off her ass.
Yeah, you too.
Well, I'm thinking about it.
All right.
So, Fiela Ren 10.
I'm going to beat that beast to the punch.
Okay?
And of course, Clarence forget about him.
I think Clarence is unique.
Bo Derek 14.
Elizabeth Taylor 15.
Raquel Wells 15.
Denise Richards 15.

Jordan Ann Abruster's only got ten.
And at Denise Richards 15.

Yeah.
Halle Berry 19.
Marilyn Monroe 25.
And Grace Kelly 62.
Oh!
The beautiful unbelievable Grace Kelly.
The former Princess of Monaco.
She died then.
That close to show you when you drive in your little sports car real fast on the mountains.
La montagna.
Isn't that what happened to her?
Yep.
She drove over it already.
Just like what's the name like James Dean, right?
Only she smelled it up better and he dug her into your van.
Here's a lady in Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hi, Uncle Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
How you doing?
Belated happy anniversary.
Thank you so much.
Can I change the subject a minute?
Sure.
Go ahead.
How do you like the new and improved Shane Willis on guiding light?
Much better.
Isn't he cute?
Oh, yeah.
He's like a real human being.
The other one looked like he came off the spaceship.
Like a lion.
I know.
Yeah, but it was very strange your Batman lips.
I think this one's really cute.
He would do.
Yeah.
And who do you think the stalker is?
Well, we know it's not Olivia.
Right.
Because he's in jail, so it can't be.
Do we think that maybe it was Richard?
I mean, not Richard.
I mean, what's his name?
Edmond.
I don't think it's Admin.
Every day I think it's somebody different.
It would be too obvious to be Alexandra.
Well, and when they thought it was Holly, I thought, well, it can't be Holly because they think it's Holly.
Can I tell you who it is?
It just dawned on me.
Who?
What's the Butler's name?
Because they never paid any attention to them before I used their names.
No one.
Go on.
No one.
That's who it is.
The Butler did it.
I'm telling you, the Butler done it.
I even thought maybe it was Lizzie because when that call came from the spawning man's in the other day,
Lizzie just happened to be home from boarding school.
That could be it.
But I didn't think it was Holly, but now it might be Holly because I think she's leaving the show.
Is she really after all these years?
Yeah.
You'll notice, speaking of Lizzie, by the way, that all of the other kids on Soap Opera,
she was about four years old one day.
Right.
And then like a week later, she was 12, and then about two weeks later, she's like 19 in real hot now.
And now it's a different Lizzie every week.
Right.
So Holly is leaving the show?
Well, I read and spoke by just that she's going to be on a recurring status,
which means we might see her once in a great while.
I'll be damned.
She's been on there for about 500 years.
I know.
I think of all the people on that show right now.
She's been on there the longest.
I think so.
Yeah.
Because she's the original Holly with Roger Thurken, all that business.
Right.
Oh, and Neil, Joanna Brewster used to be on after World Tourne Festival.
Right, exactly.
That's why I first saw her.
That's when the real beautiful blonde Michelle was on guiding light.
Remember that Michelle?
Yeah.
Oh, is she really?
Mm-hmm.
They get around.
In fact, you know, who else is on one of the shows which I saw in yesterday is the kid that used to play Billy Lewis.
Oh, you're kidding.
The one kind of swishy looking one.
I mean, you know, the one.
The fact you look at one.
Have a great day.
Thanks.
See you.
See, and I'm sure that boars a lot of people.
I don't know.
What's too bad?
We don't care.
We don't care.
That was very refreshing.
It was a breath of fresh air to me.
George, we're out here about punky Brewster.
He likes punky pie.
11.50 and 5.60 WQM.
Holley's leaving guiding lights.
You just learned that.
That's, that's worth the price of your mission.
I'll tell you another place where it's worth the price of admission.
That's Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.
And the fact this weekend, why not take a whole bunch of folks skimmed together.
All your friends, both of them.
And everybody else you know,
and head for one of the Emerald Coast locations and have a real feast.
You'll find them in sunrise, North Miami Beach, and the brand new Emerald Coast in Pemberg Pines.
They've got six different kinds of stoops, a stoops, and soups.
And you can try any of them or all of them, if you like.
Sample dozens of succulent entrees.
They've got all kinds of good stuff, chicken and beef dishes and seafood and all kinds of vegetarian stuff.
Oriental surf and turf on the weekends.
New York strip steak made your order in the gourmet center, a sizzling Asian grill,
featuring all the good stuff that you're looking for.
Teriyaki steak, shrimp, chicken, seafood, hand-carb,
framework like I said, cook to your order.
And you'll walk out there with a smile on your face and a big feeling of fullness in your public.
No headache because they don't use any MSD or cornstarch.
And they use only the best cholesterol free was and all the cooking too.
They're a fai at the Emerald Coast features a full sound of var,
new sushi bar, fresh shrimp cocktail, and the famous lobster fest is back at Emerald Coast
featuring lobster, thermometer, and lobster bisque as well.
If you have any room left at all, which will be a miracle,
but it's well worth it, fill it up with some goodies from the dessert bar at Emerald Coast.
Pie is cakes, pastries, ice cream, all your favorite toppings,
and fresh fruit, what a perfect ending to a gigantic pig out.
Emerald Coast you'll find them in sunrise, pine-aloted 44th Street.
They're on Collins Avenue just north of 163rd North Miami Beach.
And at the intersection of Flamingo and Pembroke Roads and Pembroke Pines,
they accept reservations, take out and live the available two-call 9-5-4-572-38-22.
Tell Richard that old Neil told you to call the Emerald Coast for a fantastic delicious feast.
9-5-4-572-38-22.

Really, is watered inside? Because my ass feels like it's on fire. It feels like my ass is on fire. I'll have to get rid of one of those inflatable tires. Because it burns, burns, burns. It's like my ass is on fire. My ass is on fire.
One thing that I break again too is squirting through the old food shoes. I married it from which it though was games. And it shoots from out of your ass. Oh, my God.
It feels like my ass is on fire. I'll have to get rid of one of those inflatable tires. Because it burns, burns, burns. Like my ass is on fire. My ass is on fire.
It feels like my ass is on fire. I'll have to get rid of one of those inflatable tires. Because it burns, burns, burns. Like my ass is on fire. My ass is on fire. My ass is on fire. My ass is on fire.
I'm 21 at 5.60 W.A.M. Anybody notice how almost everybody dropped off with the soap opera talk? No, I hadn't noticed. Now that you mentioned it though. Oh yeah, a whole bunch of people dropped off. You know what? We don't really care.
They'll come back. We just had to clean it out a little bit. Here's the lady in Haya Lea. Hello.
Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am. It's great to hear you sounding so good. And stop flirting around with those strokes. They're no fun. I know.
I just wanted to comment on Sheridan. You're absolutely right. She's gorgeous. Isn't she? She doesn't have a pimple on her. She's really beautiful. But you know what I think that they could be our secret weapon. That girl could wield a roll of duct tape like nobody I ever saw.
Oh, that's right. Now you're going to see today the one that I saw yesterday where she dresses up as the nurse to sneak into kill Sheridan at the end of the show. And you're going to be amazed.
Hey, she's got a white wig on. You're just going to be astonished when you see her. She takes speaking of the duct tape. Old Ma misses a wall. She finally got. She finally waddle over to the phone, but Beth came in and time to intercept her. Be sure she could make the call.
And at the end of the show, she puts all the duct tape back over her pussy again and shovels her back in the room. And she's all dolled up as the nurse now. She's a lovely thing.
She's too much. She's the most murderous little witch. I guess she must be a good actress because I can't stand her.
Yeah, you know, it's time is going on. You know, so much more evil she's becoming. Yeah, she really is. Yeah, you know, that's the one I want them to catch. And I hope he catches it because she thinks that she is such a sweet little thing.
Yeah, I'd like to catch him. Yeah, I mean bad. I wish they hadn't replaced the original Ethan. Oh, amen. This this Ethan is a stiff as it gets. Yeah, he is. Have a great day. You too. Take care of yourself. Thanks.
Okay, we're doing so pop. We're talking to me. I ride your show. George is getting really pissed off. Too bad. What?
We had a good time. At least we got a couple of women calling in anyway. All the men are gone. But that's Jennifer love you.
It whatever. I mean, yeah, sure. What? She'll get some votes. She'll get some votes. You know how you're always talking about Malsi. Yeah, she's the Malsi poster child. How about Elizabeth? What does this say? I can't read the writing.
Elizabeth shoe. Yes. Yes, what? Yes, it's Elizabeth shoe and yes, she's cute. How about Andrew shoe? Who? He was on that show on Melrose Place. Never watched Billy on Melrose Place. Well, we're not doing guys anyway. At least you're not. Jennifer Garner. Do we know who Jennifer Garner is? Well, we don't. What about Rosanna? Our cat?
Yeah, she looked good once upon a time. Let's put Rosanna our cat on it. Well, they were like that. Ask these people their opinions and if they want to say it, let's put it on there. Give them something to do over the weekend. Here's Vanessa Williams for one of our shfarts or listeners. Definitely. Definitely put Vanessa on there. Get it for Garner. That's from Alias by the way. Okay, that's why don't. And is she belong on there or not? A lot of guys think she's great. A lot of here's her name, Banty, about Jennifer Garner. Is it a Gardener? Whatever. We'll figure it out. I'll find it. Okay. Yeah, yeah, but you will. And then we're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to
go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. But I think it's Vanessa L Williams because of that sack lawsuit. All of you stuff. You can't refer to her. Is that the other woman? Also, Vanessa L Williams. It also says Dorothy Danridge, a close second. Do you remember Dorothy Danridge? I did. I saw that movie. I remember her name. I don't remember what movie was that. There were soldiers in it or something. It says, oh, yeah. How about that two pack number three with a bullet? What is today's pull excellent. Very good.
Oh, this is bad. This is not so very good. Tennessee investigators apologize for gathering
protesters' names. So American.
The head of the state's top law enforcement agency apologized yesterday for an agent
who gathered protesters' names at a peace rally in Nashville.
I extend my apologies to the people in this case Larry Wallace directly, the Tennessee
Bureau of Investigation said during a news conference at the agency's headquarters, information
collected at the Wednesday rally about 300 people in Murphreesboro will not be retained
he said. Wallace said the agent, the 17-year veteran is being re-assigned within the criminal
investigative unit. He's worked hard, done a lot of good work, but I don't know what
he was thinking. Wallace said TVI officials pointed out the agent had violated no laws.
The rally at Middle Tennessee State University coincided with a bookstought bombs demonstrations.
I'm 230 high school and college campuses across the country on Wednesday. We talked about
that. Books not bombs. And the students all walking out.
And just like a lot of the companies are saying at the UN right now, Gournish-Telfinn,
in any language, 26 past 11 at 560 WQAM 56070560, pound 560 on the AT&T line, who was
the or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in a movie today? Grace Kelly, way ahead,

race. You know, for years I've been telling about the health benefits of Oliomet, I'm

after you made a. Yeah.
Heather Locklear. I'm going to
put Pam Anderson on there. I don't

for every guy that used to watch Bay
watch when she was on her sitting
real close to the TV with his
joint in his hand. I guarantee you

Say no response because you know
it's true. I'm reading this great
article that Jeff Hygis gave me.
I'll fix it right to you. Heather
Locklear and Pamela Sue Anderson.
Pamela Skank Pamela Skank Anderson.
We're going to work on it right away.
Get him on there. We don't have

attention to this man. What's this
article from Fatboy about?
And speaking of Fatboy, where's my new
bed? You you tub of crap?
You're just how they're all going to
do this. And I'm not saying I want
you up one of these days because
you know, but we get him involved.
Oh, and the down is up 22 point.
Oh, oh, look at that.
And the next next down only two and a
half points making a big comeback
after those grotesque economic
numbers came out a 30 this morning.
Bad employment numbers. Bad
everything consumer confidence.
Yesterday, if they said you can't
complain about consumer confidence
because there isn't any.
And stuff like that.
I think maybe the reason that the
market has turned around a little
bit is because they're watching the
you end the the bait that's going
on.
And cooperation. I was clear as they
are. Thank you.
The British and Bethel to the United
Nations, Sir Jeremy Green
stocked with it once again, a very
tough line suggesting that the
British and US governments are not
going to wait much longer. A
formal proposal we expect from the
British government to be announced
when Jack straw, the British for a
second. You know, I think I think
it's going to be the last straw that
got a trineman's chance in hell.
I love this is for 305 60.
Get and stick it.
Niet Joe. He's rich. He's handsome.
He has great taste in furniture.
And he has 20 beautiful women
interested in him. But there's a
twist. He's not interested in them.
It's Joe homosexual.
Fox's newest reality romance show.
See what happens when these lovely
ladies try to get Joe's switch teams.
He didn't want to talk to me at all.
He just want to say more pictures
of my brother. Don't miss Joe
homosexual. We were supposed to have
a romantic dinner together alone.
But I didn't know he was also bringing
Cliff his friend and be sure to get
the final episode of Joe homosexual.
When Joe pops the big question.
If Sandra. Yes Joe.
Would you.
Lead me a clip alone for a few minutes.
Whatever Joe homosexual right after
Boston public bad house only on Fox.
Love 45. I'll take it one thing.
These two factors you just sent me are pretty revolutionary.
First of all, the one from Fatboy.
He better watch his big fat ass.
Okay. Did you read it? Yeah.
Well, we're not going to be talking about that on the air.
This is not enough. Why I kind of think I'm sure.
Oh, I see. What do I care about that?
That's part of the soap opera.
I see we're not talking about soap operas anymore.
Okay. The whole audience is gone from that crap.
That was your idea anyway.
Well, seriously, we can't afford to be talking about soap operas.
Come on. One more hour.
Oh, and as far as fat boys concerned,
a big fat trouble make that's my opinion.
I'm like Disney always has been always will be.
Give me that mattress up here fat boy and quit.
Let's turn the pod. What's in it?
Dirt says he don't need you.
Steering it before he smokes it.
Now this other fact.
And I said, you read this?
No from Dan.
Okay. Yeah. You got it there. I got it.
It says, did you mention the lovely Benny page?
I have no idea who that is.
Do she's a a pin up.
She's never been on TV or she made movies,
but they were like burlust movies.
You know what I mean? Not real movie.
And then you know, Daisy Flanders shouldn't be honest either.
Winning her right now.
That's why I was talking. She hosts like game shows that
emergency videos actress, right?
That would be like saying Vanna white, right?
Get get her off of there, Daisy Flanders.
I'll get her off. Get her off.
And says, don't forget Jane Mansfield.
We don't then. Let's get her honored and also of
Mimi Van Doren's got two good choices there.
But then the other part of this is so extraordinary.
Shocking.
It says also I most humbly apologize for the extra votes for
key Westia tonight.
It shouldn't be the most reviled whole corruption.
The known universe that comes from one who used to live in
God, they're more could show me the pull was kind of a
catharsis for me says, Dan.
Are you following this?
Yeah. Dan don't do it again.
Dan, we did it with our pull.
I mean, like 150 or 200 extra votes for key West.
He was banging it all night long, evidently screwed up all our
plans, screwed up all our plans.
Try to, but we were on to him.
We know nobody could touch Miami is the most overrated city
in the universe.
Speak out of the sopranos.
James Gandalfini star these sopranos is father complaint
claiming HBO breached his contract for a fifth season.
The newspaper said in the complaint filed the LA superior court
candle, Phoenix is HPE.
Mr. deadline for advising the actor that the services of be
needed for fifth season scheduled to begin filming on March
24.
This doesn't mean he will not show for work on March 24.
Martin Singer has lawyer told the daily news for our Friday
editions, but will have to then to evaluate what to do.
We're seeking a declaration from the court that he does not
legally have to render acting services for this season.
The daily news is reporting that Gandalfini words about 400
grand an episode, including bonuses is seeking 750 grand
an episode a well time.
Orders the per company of HP and CNN certainly not news where
that doctor Gupta is given bad information on here and I
emailed him this morning and pitched them out.
I don't ever hear anything again.
Yeah, but I felt better doing it.
You know, did you?
Yeah, I did.
I felt better emailing my disgust in this May.
The fact that he's putting on his horrendous information about
pancakes and and waffles are two great foods for breakfast.
If you want to keep like steady blood sugar on, yeah,
if you want to keep your blood sugar up to 500 all day,
that's a good idea and be sure to use like lots of extra maple
syrup on your flat jacks, you idiots.
So what's the Mexico guy saying with humanity?
Tentfully deposit this trust.
Thank you.
You welcome.
He said, much is grossiest and audio is now is it?
I don't think it's looking too good for this resolution.
So last night, like he said, we don't need the freaking you when
and we're just going to go in anyway.
Now what he said something like that.
It's done.
Sit on the let's go.
A sure note.
How they showed up.
Pulled this morning on certainly not news that 58 per I think was
58 to 36% if they had a choose between waiting until the
you end passes a second resolution, 58% said, let's wait.
Let's have the whole world doing it with our side and only
36% said, let the US go in there and do it alone or like with
the Brits or whatever the city assholes will do with us.
How do you like that?
Not looking too great and Colin Powell looks like he's got a
twitching colon this morning.
Not looking too happy.
Here's Hi, Alia.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir, I got two of them for you that if you don't put them
on hammer, it will probably be pissed off.
OK, Olivia, the havelin.
Yeah, and Marino Harrah.
OK, Brian to be upset.
I know hammer, but I said she loves Olivia to have a little.
Yeah, maybe he could have cut the beast with her.
Probably have a good one.
Thanks.
Olivia to have a little and Marino Harrah got those.
You got Francis Oh here.
Who?
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18th.
Nobody's catching Grace Kelly.
I'll tell you that.
Who is or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies?
Grace Kelly's got 70 votes.
Halle Berry and Marilyn Monroe are tied for second 28.
Rackel, well, 20, the least Richard 19, Liz Taylor 19, Catherine Zeta,
Jones 18, Sophia Lorraine 15, Vodaric.
You know, if you take one, he had a Vodaric, you've got Drek.
Vodaric 14, Barbara Eden 12, Angelina Jolie 11, and Jordana Brewster's only got
10. Oh, now she just moved to 11.
Thank the Lord.
She just hopped up there with Angelina Jolie.
Would you like to see her hop by Angelina Jolie?
Sure.
Or the other way around either.
Here's a call from Port Charlotte.
Hello.
Yellow, Zio.
Yes, sir.
The best of all.
Lena Horne.
Lena Horne was beautiful and had a great voice.
Who was with Lena Horne and actress though?
Was she in movies?
She was in Stomy Webber.
Stomy Webber.
Excellent choice.
Thank you.
She looked on the coffee show.
She was on what?
The Cosby Show.
Who cares?
You're the one who watched the Cosby Show.
That was him.
Nobody watched the Cosby Show.
Blank people didn't watch it.
White people didn't watch it.
But little Venerable Carlos watched it.
They had it on at the shelter.
It's not like he had a choice.
I see.
She was on the Cosby Show.
Boy, there's a guy.
If he would just stuck with his yellow putting spice, you know, we could add on him.
And I spy with Robert Culp.
That's before your time.
That was a good show.
That was an amg good show.
It was pretty weak.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, there's Jack Strang, Colin Roland.
Here's Roland Cullen.
Active and unconditional cooperation.
And Jack Strang's nodding his head.
Later, immediate, not passive active, not conditional, unconditional of every respect.
Unfortunately, in my judgment despite some of the progress that has been mentioned,
I still find what I've heard this morning, a catalog still of noncooperation.
Jack Strang nodding his head so hard that it's about to fall off because he knows that Colin will
whip out those pictures of Tony Blair and Prince Charlie doing it.
Yeah, I'm telling you.
And then that picture that Billy Goe hump in the queen, you watch.
He's got the pictures right in his coat pocket.
We know exists.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, down by the 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's for the outer day.
Hello.
For Lauderdale.
Can this be again?
I guess it's your good.
Let's try Key Largo.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
McDonald's.
I did you hear it?
McDonald's is taking me the front out of french fries.
Yeah.
One data data.
Maria one data status.
Here's a pop up.
Pop it.
Oh, hello.
Neil, I have one to give Grace Kelly a run for her money.
OK.
Ginger from Gilligan,
Ireland.
Ginger from Gilligan,
Zylin, Tina Louise.
Is that ginger Rogers?
I have no idea who that is.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
They're running a little grim.
We might better put Colin Powell on for a minute, you know?
The military force, but I don't think so.
Oh, here's a call from sunrise.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Who am I speaking to?
Neil Rogers.
Star a stage screen and paradise.
Neil, I called before and I mentioned Loretta Young.
What do you think about it?
You call what you called before what?
I mentioned Loretta Young.
Yeah.
You mentioned to who?
Who did you speak to?
Somebody answered the telephone.
I don't know.
He said he would put it on the list.
I'm checking with you.
What do you think?
He's not putting it on.
Unless he lied to you.
Oh, OK.
I say put it around there.
She's, you know, if you're over the age of 100 like us,
like you and me, why not?
Right.
OK.
Thank you.
Be sure and take your medicine.
You got Loretta Young on there?
We do know.
She won't get any votes.
Put it around her anyway.
Keep him happy.
Listen to Dave says put Katie Holmes on list her.
Katie Holmes.
Mm-hmm.
Who's that?
No relation to John.
She's a cutie.
She's on one of those teen shows.
One of those Dawson's 38 Creek.
No, he's WB shows Dawson's Creek.
Easy view.
Everwood easy.
This is easy.
Easy to know.
She's right.
OK, Katie Holmes.
Let's get her on there.
Oh, you say clean pop.
Who?
Five six.
Oh, five 60 lamb chop.
Oh, I guess what?
Are these cholesterol busters for you?
Wait till it's right in the middle of lunch time.
I'm going to help people with their diet.
Oh, and this is a study from the University of Toronto.
It said the reductions in cholesterol or surprising.
Instead of taking all of those pills that they keep trying to
predate or is so core and what are some of the other
those statin drugs?
Zide effects.
Yeah, they have bad side effects.
But anyway, instead of taking those, they got an amazing new diet,
vegetarian diet, and says the reductions in cholesterol are amazing.
Most dietitians wouldn't expect a sort of reduction to diet.
It means whether most people would stick with such a diet.
It's another matter.
It says because it involves daily okra, eggplant, and metamusel
among other things.
That's how good?
Yeah.
Okra, eggplant, and metamusel.
Okra.
It's called the portfolio diet.
And the University of Toronto presented his findings that
I mean, he and Miami Beach yesterday at the American Heart Association.
The research was sponsored by the Canadian government,
the Almond Board of California, and food companies,
Unilever Canada, and La Blah brands.
So I wish I had a La Blah by me here.
It was a pretty impressive result.
He said the diet is based on low-fat vegetarian regimen
that emphasizes food shown individually to be beneficial.
Soy, soluble fiber, plant stirruals, and almonds.
Sources of soluble fiber include oats, barley, legumes, eggplant, okra,
and metamusel.
Some brands of margarine or high-end plant stirruals.
Sounds like a wiener to me.
I'm going to go half-out and lobloz right now as a matter of fact.
What do you think is in my two packages downstairs?
Two pack.
Thrux.
Fibre, local, this is five cities.
The radio's all yours.
How many?
Q&A.
Mr. King, I'd like to relax by having Mary Magdal and massage my balls
while listening to the Neil Rogers 12-1 hour beeping.
Hey, hey.
There's a new prescription drug whose name says it all.
Zidafacts.
Finally, a prescription medicine that always gives you more than you'd expect.
Zidafacts.
Isn't it time you experienced zidafacts?
They cause loss of blood, loss of hearing, loss of virginity.
Vertigo, impotigo, impotence and prisonments shrinkage of the genitals
and largement of the genitals, softening of the brain, softening of the stool,
loose tools, barstools, toesstools, huge free historic bats
swiping out of the sky and eating your dog.
Halletosis, honeyberry, berry, berry, manolo, recto-bleeding, recto-numnus,
chest pains, hunger pains, dry mouth, cotton mouth, large mouth, small mouth,
hell mouth, or death.
Zidafacts is perfect for everyone.
Not intended for women who are pregnant.
Women who are met, men who are pregnant, children with dogs, children with dogs
who are pregnant, the elderly, the young kitty cat, Steve Perry,
tadpoles, tadpoles who are pregnant and pregnant, pauses.
Indus flavors like these.
Ask your doctoral pharmacist about Zidafacts and find out if it's responsible
for the mysterious, postulent growth under your left armpit.
Zidafacts.
It's 12 o'clock, 12 noon, the big hands out a little handy with 560 WQM.
Golf stuff, heavy duty, this afternoon.
I hope my dog and Hank Boca had a chance to smooth things out over there
with the people at D'Areal.
Yeah, when you think after that, grow test display between Moa and D'Aurena's
morning, having a big brawl right there on a guard then, of course,
shameful.
So anyway, the man dog and Hank will both be doing their shows at D'Areal.
I finally figured out what that 10 minute gap is before the Panther game is.
It's a chance, 10 minutes for them to turn it off before they realize
we've got a hockey game on.
Panthers and the trashers in Atlanta tonight, any interest?
No.
Panthers just fired two coaches, brought Dwayne's Sutterback, Bad Move, Bad.
Anyway, our pool today, we're getting a phenomenal response as usual.
And we only have about, do you think we need a few more choices, Carlos?
About 30 minutes.
Oh, I think I just snorted.
Who is or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies?
And we've got a list as long as John Holmes Leg.
Heather Locklear, panel Anderson.
Are we identifying her as Pam Anderson?
No, but say slut.
I think it's slut.
I don't know, panel of Lee.
And Pam Anderson Lee.
I have no idea what she's calling herself.
Pam Anderson, I don't know who it is.
Would you put, I just put it on there as Pamela Anderson.
Fine.
Grace Kelly, who's killing everybody, man, she is way ahead.
Of course, if she keeps going that fast, could be bad.
Hey, Marilyn Monroe, the beautiful Jordan Abrooster, who I don't care what anybody says.
She is as good as it gets.
She is as beautiful as it gets.
Elizabeth Taylor, Bo Derek, Halley Berry.
Denise Richards, Jailo, Katherine Hepburn, Angelina Jolie, Christy Crook, who's on small
bill, Lana, who just can't get laid for a lover money.
She just wants to take a look at it, Clark, and the spaceship too.
Audrey Hepburn, Linda Carter.
Amazing how many votes we got for Audrey Hepburn.
How many votes did she have actually?
Ten.
Vissie?
Yeah.
Can we introduce this to us?
Is this a central rating list reading for a very important bulletin?
Yes.
Hey, it's the beast I actually made it this time.
I thought you were coming to 1230.
I got here early just for you.
You fat to have a crap and?
I love you too.
229.
That's not too bad.
It's four pounds less than last time, right?
Two.
Mark, I said it's two pounds less than last time.
229, he started 284, so he's lost 55 pounds.
I really think it's going to speed up now because I'm getting a personal trainer and
everything and it's starting to exercise and all that stuff.
It's about time you fat to have a crap plus an additional which you only got 19 days
until your big date.
Yeah, we really shouldn't talk about that.
Why not?
Because I feel like a Patsy, a tool.
Yeah, they put my rush limbaugh type picture on the website and I don't think it's
really getting me anywhere.
You mean that huge?
Well, how many contestants do we have so far?
How many entrance?
Do I have many crickets chirping somewhere?
You mean the big zero, huh?
No, I'm not privy to that information, but I see.
I'm not sure.
Maybe you can pass some of your sloppovers off to clearance.
Actually, that's his idea.
To be honest with you, that was a pretty good idea.
I'm sure it is.
Well, I got news for if they don't want to touch you, but do you think they're going
to want to do with him?
Anybody out there who wants to get laid, in fact, I think you should have started like
at 91, not 21.
If you're already aged 91 and you want one last fling, here's your chance.
Right.
It may not be good.
You may not be able to find it, but you're, you know, what difference is there?
I figure some shakes are going to want to use me for a trip to the Bahamas, right?
No.
You think?
I mean, you think.
No.
No.
Not when they see that picture.
That was like 50 pounds ago, though.
It's one thing to have a size 42 waist.
It's another thing to have a size 42 head.
It's a little big.
It's a little large.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Well, good luck to you.
You'll need it.
It's a nice one.
There are 55 pounds.
You feeling okay?
Yeah.
I feel great.
Well, what made you sick?
We just had the corporate crowd like everybody else?
Uh, basically.
Yeah.
That sort of a foolish type symptoms.
And listen, I mean, the room where I'm here is that if nobody else assigns up a new
thing, maybe Doreen will help you out.
I think she's busy with Howard.
That's what mode told me.
Anyway, get out of here.
So we got Halle Buried and he's Richard J. Low, Catherine Hepburn.
I'm weighed on here.
Jennifer Connoreka.
Well, so feel alright.
It's going to take me an hour just to read the names on here.
Barbara Eden Charlize, there on Catherine Zeta Jones, Phoebe Kate's Brook Shields, Isabelle
Rosalini, Ingrid Bergman, Kim Novak, Gene Tierney, Catherine DeNive, and Margaret Mackenzie
Westmore, Michelle Fyfer, Ava Gardner, Kate Jackson, Ashley Judd, Susan Dave Hivinly,
Tippy Headron, Nikki Cox, Daisy Fonday, we crossed her out, right?
Yeah.
Get her out of there.
She ain't no actress.
Christina Applegate, Cameron Diaz, Brooke Burke, Jackie Johnson, your favorite, favorite
lady, Vanessa Williams, I'm Vanessa L. Williams, Rosanne Arquette, Jennifer Love Hewitt,

Yeah, whatever.
Elizabeth Shoe, Jennifer Gardner, Jacqueline Smith, Marlena Dietrich, Merle Alberon,
Bridget Bardot, Alyssa Milano, Rita Hayworth, Jacqueline Piscitt, Jesus, I got to turn
a page over here.
I'm going to headache from this.

Katie Holmes, and Elizabeth Hurley, huh?
A spectacular list, if you ask me.
5667-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T, Carlos' we can't take more than another 40 or 50 names.
That way you just said, right?
Topse.
Here's Miami, hello?
Yes, sir.
What's up, man?
I can't believe you forgot to be off.
I didn't see his name on the list.
Yeah, it's name.
Okay, good one.
5667-0560, she's going to be on the butcher list that we're going to do.
Who's the butcher's of the mall?
Okay.
Or in her case, who's the bitchiest of the mall?
She was really, I don't like Bearth, at all.
Do you?
No.
I mean, the Jefferson's was great, but they should have stopped right there.
You know, all in the family we love, we love everybody on that show.
The Jefferson's was sensational.
In spite of what Tom Jicke said, but then he, like I said, should have stopped there
and then they had to push it a little further with mod.
Bad no.
They did tackle some real controversial issues on that show, but unfortunately you had
to see her on there.
Yeah.
And him.
Walter.
Yeah.
Very annoying, but Adrian's Barbos made up for all of it.
Oh, Adrian's Boo Boo.
You're magical bouncing Barbos.
I almost forgot about her.
Are we putting her on the list?
Eh, whatever.
No.
No.
Here's Miami Lakes.
Hello.
Miami Lakes.
Yeah, hey, how you doing here?
Okay, sir.
Take your leave.
I should have no fight.
Who?
Jolie, Angelina Jolie.
Take her off.
Yes.
Got no answer.
Okay.
Thanks.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Yesterday, maybe we'll do that this hour instead of putting more on.
We'll take some off.
There you go.
Where are you going, Carlos?
Come back.
Yeah, let's take some of these names off of there.
Probably got too many anyway.
We're trying to do your favor.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10.
Let me forget during the break.
I got to close that window.
I'm going to start freezing in here.
And also go downstairs and get my packages.
And then by the time I get back, it'll be one o'clock.
Oh.
Here's a call from Perine.
Hello.
Hi, before I came in.
And back to you.
What about Brittany Daniel from Joe Dirt?
I don't know if you ever saw that movie.
Brittany Daniels?
Yeah, Brittany Daniels.
Long girl.
Beautiful.
I don't know if you know who that is.
Carlos, you know who that is?
No.
Did he say from Joe Dirt?
Yeah.
Anybody had a section with over in Joe Dirt?
Sure, it's not Jamie Pressley.
No, not Jamie Pressley.
Brittany Daniels.
OK, we got it.
Check it out.
Thanks.
OK.
We got it down.
He sounded like he knew what he was talking about, which is more than I can say for some people
who are watching the TV screens under overpasses without cable.
560, 560, 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
He sounded pretty distraught over that contest.
Yeah.
Distraught, embarrassed.
Uh-huh.
Why do they keep doing things like that?
Well, you know, in his case, I guess he doesn't care.
He wants to be the guinea pig.
He's got half of that down anyway.
By the way, Brittany Daniels, definitely.
Oh, you got her picture on the website?
Yeah, I remember what she was for that movie.
All right.
There you go.
Brittany Daniels, she's on there.
Here's Igor Ivanov, the four minister of Russia, Ruskys.

The special responsibility we have at the moment.
And the choice which we will have to make.
Yes.
If we succeed through our joint efforts at resolving the Iraq crisis, pursuing to the United Nations
Trigger, this, of course, will have a positive effect on our efforts at settling out of the
See, if that's time to do promising, this is just an exercise is what they're doing.
You know, they always tell us that exercise is good for everybody, although I don't think
they'd agree with this one.
It's just an exercise because when they get to the vote, it's going to be yet.
Nay.
Not good.
And they'll say, okay, we get the message now.
Let's start dropping the bombs.
Am I right?
Right.
Here's a call from Keybus Gain.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, hey.
You're right there.
Hello.
Speak to me.
Okay.

Okay.
Thank you.
You don't have to sound cheap as you're about it.
Linda Lovelace.
I don't.
I mean, she was all right.
Okay.
Huh?
I just used a little kind of beat up toward the end there.
A little advantage.
You look a skanky at the time.
You thought at the time she was scabby?
No, you're thinking of Harry Reams.
Him too.
Linda Lovelace put a runner.
Carlos has no idea who that is.
In fact, wasn't Greg Askinat a long time whose deep throat?
Who's the mole?
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60, pound, five, 60 on the AT&T line.

Prove 16 at 560 W.Q.A.M. A class section lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of 19th
century ordinance that bans the use of lude and filthy words.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court stems from the October arrest of Salvador Garcia
17, who was charged with violating the ordinance after flashing gang signs and shouting,
King love and dragon killer.
Ready for that?
Okay.
Whatever you do, don't say.
Dunga killer.
Defense attorneys Thomas Morrissey and Robert Farley said Garcia never made the statements.
Morrissey said however, the importance of the case of Stins beyond Garcia because the
ordinance has an impact on people's right to speak.
This was in Chicago.
It allows the unbridled discretion of the police officer to determine what's at appropriate
order act by a citizen.
He told Wednesday, Chicago's sometimes.
Morrissey said the ordinance often is a pretext for arresting people when police have
no other reason to do so.
During city budget hearings last fall in Chicago, figures showed the ordinance against
indecent lute or filthy acts brought in 144,000 dollars in fines, mostly for public urination,
court, court, the fine currently is 300 bucks.
Morrissey and Farley said Garcia was arrested while watching TV with a friend in an apartment
that was rated by police.
The two were told to wait against the fence outside the building.
Morrissey said Garcia was arrested after he ex-polished what he and his friend had done
wrong.
That'll teach him.
Open up a mouth and be a smart ass, right?
Yeah.
There you go.
Zined America, baby.
So I think, based, I think maybe they'll use this, you went actually today when they take
the final vote later on.
I think they'll use the actions excuse to say, well, we did our best.
We tried to convince you and the UN is a paper tiger and you won't go along and that's
it, right?
Right.
If you miss Barry Jack, ask his column, get the sports section out of the trash.
Get out of the bottom of your bird cage from the heraldous morning.
David and WQM milestone morning show at the one year mark.
A scandalous, I think basically Greg threw him under the bus, getting pretty crowded under
here, by the way.
I, I, I, yeah.
Move over, Moeick's getting crowded here out of the bus.
One thing a lot Greg read.
When's the last time you ever read him say anything in public good about anybody that
works for him?
You notice that?
When's the last time that happened?
I'm thinking about it.
I'll get back here.
I won't tell you what exactly he's taking at the last time he was hitting aозg it.
You know what I mean only a few.
She was almost as pretty as Robin. That's right.
Okay, thanks. As Robin read breast.
Yeah, I guess she was the cat woman on the show yesterday.
Okay, although the villain, this is one the...
What the hell was his name?
The Sand... Sandman?
Sand... Was that it? The Sandman?
I think that was what it was.
The Sandman, I've never seen him before.
Although I've seen the actor. He was an actor that used to be like an outer limits a lot.
Very popular character actor.
5670560, pound 5660.
How is what's her name doing? Sheridan. She's still got one vote.
Ah...
Mackenzie Westmore, the beautiful blonde who plays Sheridan on passions, still has only got one vote.
You'll be sorry.
One of these days when you finally get around one by accident, you flop upon your eyes upon her body and you'll say to me,
Hey, is that who you're talking about?
Here's Miami. Hello.
Miami.
Oh, Nail.
Yes, sir. Yes, I am.
Here's a plus ten on a Peter meter. Ava Gardner.
Yes, she's on there.
Oh, it's a homestead in here.
Frank Sinatra said she was okay too.
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
She was beautiful. In fact, there's a whole big thing about her.
He was obsessed with her.
Did you ever read that book about Frank Sinatra?
No. I would read a book about Frank Sinatra.
I did.
Pretty scathing. It was like the unauthorized biography, just a scathing rip job.
And he was obsessed with her. And like, even after she dumped them, she just wouldn't take no for an answer.
Huh.
You know what I mean? You know how he and his crowd always reacted a little hostile.
5,6,7,0,5,60.
Oh, yeah. Kind of like Doreen and Mo.
Boy, I would like to have been a fly on the wall on the uh...
somewhere. I wish I'd had a camcorder there.
When that had been great, we could have put all the pictures right on our website.
Pictures, videos, movies, maybe.
Mo, duking it out with the Doreen.
I think I give her the edge.
Here's a call from Cleveland. Hello.
Yeah, we're legit. How are you now?
What is it?
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.

Creators on the moon, Neil.
Not that Carlos is a little bit slow, but under the overpass,
you don't have a lot of interaction with like real living and breathing people.
And then of course, he comes to QAAM, so at least it's consistent.
Here's North Miami Beach. Hello.
Hey, Neil. How you doing?
Listen, I got two names for you, and I got my favorite number three hockey player.
Yeah.
See, how about Julie Christie?
Julie Christie's good.
How about Diane Cannon?
How about Frank Cannon?
And my favorite number three hockey player was...
I know he played on a crummy Detroit team back in the early 70s.
Dennis Hexall.
He was number three?
I think so.
Could have fooled me.
Who would be?
I have no idea. That's what I'm saying.
I was so obscure that who the hell would know.
I know. Ready here, Guy. We're always getting into fights.
Yeah. At least you didn't say Denise Pothman anyway.
Number five. Okay, thanks a lot.
Denise Pothman, maybe he's the best.

Did I?
Just a joke. It's just a joke.
I can't get a Vino Playoffs. It's just a little bit of joke.
Anyway, the Leafs are going right now.
Today I'm going to think they had a really big lead there on everybody for the playoffs
because it's going to be over real quick.
Olin Nolan or no, Olin Nolan.
Okay. Who the hell are they?
73 votes for Grace Kelly, the most beautiful actress in TV or the movies.
73 votes for the magnificent, beautiful Grace Kelly.
A lot of people want to look in her rear window.
Marilyn Monroe 32.
Halle Berry 32.
In fact, George wouldn't mind sticking his tongue in her rear window.
And I would like to see her slam that window that thing right down on her.
Halle Berry and Marilyn Monroe tied for second 32.
Sophia Loren 23, Raquel Wells 23.
We've run a gamut with the age barrier on this halfway.
Yeah. We've got some of those WB and Fox shows people.
And then we go all the way to the Loretta Young.
And Loretta Swift.
How come we're not putting Clara Bowen there since we're getting old?
Yeah, we got Marlene and Dietrich.
Yeah, put the girl down.

And Verizon Line. Here's Miami Lakes. Hello.
Oh, right, Neo.
Yes, sir.
I have to second one of those guys, one of the guys earlier call her that said,
take off Angelina Jolie. She's a skank.
Is she?
Yeah, I wouldn't even do it.
I wouldn't do it worth with George's thing.
And if he had one, if he had one true, what about Heather Locklear?
Haven't heard anybody mentioned her?
How come we don't have her on here?
She's on there.
She's on there.
Oh, she is on there.
I'm sorry.
I don't have the way.
Well, I mean, we've only got 600 on there.
It's kind of hard to keep track, you know?
And Neo, I think it's a trip where you're doing with the new condolences song.
You know, hit me with that drop below without your ass.
Stay here.
Oh, oh, oh.
Okay, good. They love that.
Mm-hmm.
They're, uh, humming it.
They're singing it.
They're squeezing it.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T.
And for Ryzenland, don't forget the QM van.
Oh, don't forget to close my window during next break.
Don't forget to close your window.
Or he did it.
Or he did it on the last break.
You're supposed to remind me of the last break.
Oh, sorry.
I forgot.
You forgot.
I didn't.
See, who's the one that had the astray?
Who's the one that had the pulmonary embolism?
Oh, that's right.
You're in that studio though.
Getting ready.
Sick room.
QAM van will be out at Ryzen Wireless this afternoon, 5 to 6 p.m.
And maybe Miguel will let you take a look at it.
158, 11 pines, full of ardent, pember of pines.
Stop by to win sports tickets.
And register to win tickets throughout coming Marlon's home game.
That sounds pretty marginal to me, don't they?
Don't get me started.
Maybe Doreen put him up to it.
And she's always running him around like her lackey.
Yeah.
Here's pepper apart.
Hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
My choice is Valerie Bertnelli.
Valerie Bertnelli was cute as a button.
Yep.
And beautiful though.
And can't you get Bokobry or Carlos to put the words to the con to Lisa song on the website so we can know it.
No.
No.
All right, have a nice day.
Don't push your luck, okay?
There.
That's as much as we're doing today.
Maybe on Monday we'll do.
And then on Tuesday.
And that's it.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line.
Greg Reed says, what was that one operative line that I come?
Did I throw that away?
Oh, I'll fill.
You know, it's interesting because it's my luck.
No, here it is because I did Schmidt.
Can't I water it up and I threw it on the floor because during the breaks what I do is I got my I put it.
I got my garbage sack.
And I just throw all the use the stuff in the garbage sack.
Well, my luck being that this one is sitting right down there.
I do like that.
Great.
And he says I've had concerns about the daily quality of the show meaning the more Howard David had morning show on QAM.
The lack of humor in the lack of invigorating sports talk.
He says I still have the same concerns.
We are going to try to do some things to spruce it up.
I still have the same concerns.
I think is the obvious operative part of that.
The sentence in other words, Mo.
Greg H2.
How do you like that?
Huh?
I don't want to get more nervous and paranoid with the big weekend coming up.
But Mo.
Greg H2.
And Doreen hates you too.
Greg H2.
Mo.
Now, what's well?
How to side out of mind?
You know how it goes?
Yep.
But when you try to butcher up everybody else's life when you can't tank a whistle of koot.
When you're making nasty comments about fat hank, we take it very personal on this station.
Okay.
Talking about how everybody's treating him.
How about the way he's treating everybody else?
Don't you think we ought to look at that?
Maybe?
Yeah.
Let's take a little peek at that, Mo.
Since you're so concerned with everybody else throwing your ass under the bus.
Probably ought to have a hernia from all.
Oh, fade done away.
I don't think so.
Notice I put a little question mark down there.
Oh, fade done away.
Now, is that when she was in network or in a Vita, Peron?
I'm not sure.
I'm not really sure.
I can't think of a time when she didn't know.
I mean, I like fade out of ways in actress, but bizarre looking.
But don't tell me that she's the most beautiful woman, the actress radio or TV or movies or,
maybe our radio should be beautiful.
Yeah, there you go.
In fact, I think the beast is the most beautiful talk I ever seen on radio.
28th pass known at 560 WQM.
We got a big, big, huge night at Pomato Park tonight.
The only horse racing fireworks stuncher in the world will be going on tonight at Pomato Park.
It's called Hot to Trot.
Australian stuntman Vincent Silvestro and his wonder horse, Handmey Silver, will amaze you.
As Vincent stands on the shaft of his Aussie race by colds the reins in his teeth, 15,000 candle parmarines flare in it,
a marine flares in his hands, and while Handmey Silver races around the dark track shoots off more than 2,000 rounds of fireworks from the back of his race bug,
and the grand finalizes exciting as Macy's July 4th display, it's really something to see.
General parking admissions always free at Pomato Park.
Parmarines show 9 o'clock tonight, along with exciting hardest race action.
Of course, starting at 7 o'clock tonight, free miniature horse rides, free face painting, and clowns for the kids in live music too.
I wonder if they have a clown face for Mickey McNichol probably.
No.
Don't forget to come out to Pomato Park next Saturday, March 15th in Winnifocation Pier, Pertuted, Prezure, K, Resort, and Marina, and Avaco in the Bahamas.
We got great live racing, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, and we got a simulcasting every day, seven days a week, from tracks all over North America.
Pomato Park, a block south Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road. Don't forget tonight's the big Hot to Trot horse racing fireworks stunt show at Pompino Park.
This is sports radio pricing.
You A.M.
From Alabama, South Africa.
Welcome back to the highly dated, more Howard and David and Joan.
Hey, y'all about that last book, eh?
Yeah, the book, the book, the book, the book.
Oh, I sure. I knew when I came in here I'd put this joint on the map.
You're the greatest, Mo.
It's got a heart rate, Gideon. Why am the cat meow?
Meow.
Let us hear scores for a little cerebral celebration.
Yeah!
And I tell you, just what I'm gonna do.
What's that, Mo?
I'm gonna go down that hall.
And take a dump right in front of the door and a pipe smoker studio.
That's right. I'm gonna give it a good squat and leave a little souvenir for our Duke Canadian-fagged friend.
Right there on the carpet.
And another thing.
The floor I go, I would like to propose a toast to our success.
With what?
For my holy Charlie callus.
I mean my holy callus.
What a...
Take a drink.
Are you, you sleepin' on my impotent power?
No, my lord.
But I...
Break the neck down from the loins of greatness.
That's it.
Yeah.
Give it to my green checker penis.
I got a job, Pizzle.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Yeah.
I think you...
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
You're dead, Duff.
What are you?
What do you know?
Is that?
Are you?
What are you looking at, Bully Bean?
I've got a piece of wax, pal.
Now I am screy.
Yeah.
I'm not sure that Johnson-Yakon poof.
Hey!
Watch out!
I ran a line.
Looks like some kind of space.
You're a stripper, Joy.
Hey!
I can't move.
Hey, you great boy.
I command you let me out of these things.
You are to be probed.
Proved.
What do you mean, proclins?
Human, ill, poor, ill, sick.
That ain't have been.
It's search probed.
I want something you know I'm a man.
And you, my relation.
I want to go to the loins of the loins of the loins of the loins.
Reconciliation.
Come with peace.
Break into the command.
Real men don't have the babies.
Maybe they'll be the pregnant of what?
Peace, production, companies.
He terms you and I.
The privilege, HR.
Wouldn't he even put me in space?
Why I'll have you know you can't.
WOOOOOO!
The other boss.
1234-560 WQA.
What is the facts now?
Quit putting these editorial comments on there.
No.
Here's one that says, what about Linda Evans?
And I wrote her down.
Why not?
She's great.
Big Valley, huh?
She would know Barbara Stanway.
I heard she had a big valley.
No, that was Barbara Stanway.
I see.
It said she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen.
And it says, Georgia's a fag if he wouldn't do Pam Anderson.
And you write back, hepatitis infected pus bag.
Now you just have this obsession against Pam Anderson.
She didn't have pus.
And she wasn't infected.
And she didn't have hepatitis when she was on gay watch.
Okay?
Yes, she did.
The hell she did.
She was doing Tommy Lee.
Right?
Oh, not back then.
Yeah, that was the way I was.
No problem.
No, she was doing it.
She was doing it.
Now he's later back then.
Maybe him too, but no, the last one.
And she was doing Billy Watts's name.
Billy Bean.
Billy Watts.
Billy the Black Care.
Billy's Warlock.
You just have an obsession against Pam Anderson.
I don't care what you say.
Nothing.
She's got any votes yet.
Is she on a poll?
It's a ought to be.
And this other fact is right.
We got it.
Pam Anderson's got four votes already.
She's in.
And I guarantee she's going to have big ones.
They may not be for real.
But maybe they fell off from the infection.
Catherine nervous.
Fell with a C and not with a K.
I just mentioned that in case Eric might be monitoring now
in the middle of his lunch hour.
Catherine didn't know.
Maybe that's why she doesn't have any votes because we misspelled her first name.
It's with a C and not a K.
And nobody gives a C K.
How about Barbara?
What is that name?
Barbara what?
Billingsley.
I don't know.
Barbara backed.
Barbara Bach.
Oh, Barbara Bach.
What terrible handwriting.
Ursula Andrews and Barbara Ursula undress.
Sure.
Yes.
Ursula andress in her day.
Okay.
Okay.
This list is out of control, Carlos.
Ain't it?
I wish I was your dad.
Ursula andress and Barbara Bach.
Well, like I said, I'll keep these people off the streets over the weekend.
You got a list.
Man, oh man.
You talk about tapping away on it.
You'll be tapping all weekend on our poll.
You'll be tapping our poll till it bleeds.
So we added Linda Evans Ursula undress and Barbara Bach.
Okay.
Okay.
She's.
Okay.
Listen about, here are the 85,000 most beautiful women actresses ever on TV in radio and movies
in between shortwave.
Here's a call from Evan Chura.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I can absolutely that this name has not come up yet, but it must be because how she looks now.
Okay.
A very young Richard Fardot.
Yeah, she's on her.
Oh, she is.
But I agree with you though, it was a very late addition.
We went a long way until she finally got a mention.
Oh, okay.
Very good.
And it's a pretty sad comment, there isn't it.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
No, seriously.
Richard Fardot back in her day, which is about 100 years ago.
Right.
That's right.
No, she was considered the most beautiful woman in the world back then.
Sure.
But that was a hundred years ago.
But that was a hundred years ago.
And that's why they, you know, in addition to what her name is not spelled.
You talk about, I mean, we got both names spelled wrong there.
Bridget Bardou.
It's V-A-R-D-O-T.
I do believe, isn't it?
I don't know.
Well, I'm sure this one.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
There you go.
I tell you somebody that may get a voter too.
Better not.
What?
I was going to say Jane Fonda.
And her youth, she was very attractive.
But what about her?
Marborella.
Marborella.
Right?
She's pretty good in that movie.
She's pretty hot.
Very hot.
Let's put Jane Fonda in.
And then we'll get all the right-wingers upset.
Oh, he's pretty good at people's daughter.
Yeah, right.
That's right.
Put her on there.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60.
We only have one for another two or three hundred names on the list, so better make it fast.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
Great, happy anniversary.
Thank you.
Hey, I just, I'm one of your little crazy Cuban listeners.
And I want to throw in Spanish actors.
Oh, right.
Finger.
Yeah.
You can even have a bit for her, which maybe you could play Thalia.
Oh, Thalia.
Yeah.
Excellent.
Have you seen her on the website?
No, I have not.
Oh, my God.
You've got to watch this woman.
She's incredible.
Okay.
So, I think you could throw that a bit on there maybe later on.
You got them on.
All right.
See you.
Give me one.
Oh, 21 to one at five, 60 WDQM, the world famous Jim Mad Dog Manage.
After they clean up that message, D'Areal, he'll be along at once.

Tami.
What is it?
Raja.
You got the phone.
Oh.
Phone.
Hello.
Tami Metolia.
Speaking.
This is Michael Jackson.
You lost your job.
You lost your job.
Hey, I didn't lose my job.
I stepped down.
Oh, sure.
However you want to paint the picture, whatever you have to tell yourself in order to save some sort of face you do it, but you lost your job.
You know, actually it's kind of nice to hear your voice.
What?
It's kind of nice to hear anybody's voice.
What are you talking about?
Michael Jackson.
Yeah.
Can you hear that?
That's why Mexican wife, let me tell you.
It was cute for maybe five, ten minutes a day.
But if I got to stay home with her every day, I'm going to go crazy.
You're getting your justi's, jerks.
Tami Metolia, that devil.
All we do is eat Mexican food.
Jimmy Chungas, burritos, tostitos.
I got more gas than exonc.
And you deserve to have the bloat.
Listen, Michael, I'll resurface somewhere.
I'll start another label.
Sure you will.
So you can destroy the career of other budding artists.
Are we going to Chevy?
Yes, honey.
We're going to Chevy.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Oh, jeez.
If it's not Chevy's, it's T-cheese.
It's what's that drive in place?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I called to be right to you.
And all I'm getting is dribble and Jimmy Changa.
No, no, no, no.
Admit it.
I was the reason you were forced to be fired.
Right, I know.
Because I'm very, very, very devilish.
Ah, ooh.
I want to live in America.
I want to live in America.
You live in America.
I live in America.
Okay, I got to take her over to Taco Bell.
Chevy!
Okay.
Chevy, you want to come with us?
No, I don't want to be seen with you.
You are the devil.
So at this point, I am finding myself having some sympathy for you.
All right, all right.
I got to go there, Mikey.
Let me tell you something.
If I were to front right now,
half the neighborhood would go up.
Ah, goodbye.
1244-560 WQM.
So what do we got?
400 names on here yet.
We got Talia.
Did you get Talia?
Yes.
Okay, and Jane Fonda,

pound 560 on a AT&T line,
Pompato Beach.
Hello.
Yeah, hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about, uh, high-passually,
and in a house?
Who is the high-passually?
Yeah.
We do in Pornostar now?
Excuse me?
High-passually.
Yeah.
And who is the second one?
Okay, what are you saying?
Couldn't hear it.
We're really putting that down.
What's wrong with high-passually?
Nothing, I guess.
Pornostar.
Yeah.
We put them to lovely sun.
Is she like a regular actress?
Neither one of them are like all that great.
Okay.
Cross out how high-passually and put brindly.
567-0560,
here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Maybe that's where we slip and pick you.
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, um, hi, Neil.
You have a great shot.
Thank you.
Um, was it, um, how about Renaulta Ryder?
Who?
Renaulta Ryder.
Renaulta Ryder, oh.
Yeah, maybe she might steal a poll.
Okay.
Okay, bye now.
Thanks.
Who?
Who?
What do you think you want to put one on on there?
No.
I don't either.
Skanky.
567-0560.
How is Sheridan doing?
Certainly hopes she's got more than one.
Oh, she's got a pair.
Sheridan's got a beautiful pair.
Mackenzie Westmore to play Sheridan on passions.
I've got two votes now.
She's right up there with the gene tyranny.
And Jackie's Johnson.
How do you like that?
Jackie Johnson's only got two votes?
Huh.
That is amazing.
Maybe a lot of these people don't watch the channel 7 is.
Good.
Good for them.
Because on the sports news shows that's all they talk about is Jackie Johnson is in Jackie Johnson.
And that's all they ever talked about.
I might actually listen.
Oh.
Maybe starting Monday.
Maybe Jackie Johnson is the new piece in the puzzle in the end of the morning show.
To replace.
Here's Sunrise.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
And you know, I have two names.
I want to make sure I get these on for you to fill up your list.
One for E.D.
Cooper.
How about Natalie Wood?
Yeah.
And George probably relates to Terry Hatcher.
I'd like to relate to Terry Hatcher.
There we go.
Okay, thanks.
Back around the tango, Fatcher.
What?
I have no idea.
Natalie Wood and who is the other one?
Terry Hatcher.
I have a feeling I'm losing contact with reality or something like that.
Could be wrong.
Could just be my imagination.
560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Who the hell is Terry Hatcher?
She was on the other Superman series.
The one we can't gain.
She was the lowest of lowest in Clark.
I see.
I don't remember that the series very well.
I would never all know excited about that.
Because you want to start without the makeup on.
Oh God.
He made James Woods like an old smoothie.
Here's Pembroke Pine.
Hello.
Hi.
Yes sir.
One of them haven't heard today anyway.
Jack Lewis.
Yes.
Yeah, we got her.
Oh, did she?
Yeah, she's really.
I think she's beautiful.
Lady Edition if she's on her.
Also, shameless request.
Yes sir.
There is a, I've been I heard a long time ago about deal of Vita Dexametti fast trim mix.
The name of the Jenny Ultra Neutrous fast slim one.
That one, yeah.
Oh yeah.
Is it in here?
It's ACN classic gold.
I got it.
Okay.
George got it.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Bye.
You're going to play it?
Sure.
Excellent.
Come on.
I was great.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So there you go.
George has got it.
Now you're going to have to look it up in the thing though, aren't you?
And I will.
During the break.
George is going to look at up his thing.
Just to show that we're a couple of good guys.
And then we got Carlos to just approve nothing's perfect.
Now he's working his little ass off today with 65,000 names.
You got them all now?
Yeah.
Most of them.
Got Natalie Wood, Terry Hatcher, you got Talia?
What?
Talia.
You got Talia and I got Direa, etc.
Okay, now come out of the break.
Don't forget.
Because you have this bad handle.
This is my...
And look.
This is for 205 City.
Way to A.
Why, there you bastards.
Hey, you with the fork.
When you run to your Cotaroid pants catch fire.
When you walk backwards.
Do you go beat, beat, beat?
If so, then you need our revolutionary weight loss system.
Introducing Dila Jenny Ultra Nutra Fast Slim Watchers.
The only diet program that uses the amazing new concept of eating less.
I never would have thought of it.
But Dila Jenny Ultra Nutra Fast Slim Watchers showed me that if I placed less food in my mouth, I lose weight.
Look at me now.
But that's only the beginning.
Because Dila Jenny Ultra Nutra Fast Slim Watchers will also introduce you to the radical new process called moving around more.
I always thought the best way to lose weight was to just sit still.
But these people show me it was better to move around more.
Look at me now.
And if you sign up now during this special unlimited time offer, you'll be evaluated by our untrained professionals who wear real white coats and act like they care.
Why were there coats? Why?
Look at me now.
Yes. Dila Jenny Ultra Nutra Fast Slim Watchers.
The program that's better than all the rest.
Because it is all the rest.
1253 and 560 WQM. That was interesting, you know.
What? That bit.
Yeah.
Old?
Yeah.
Funny?
I just dropped my list on the floor.
Okay. So I just hit my head on the mic.
I'm awake.
Just a little bit. Just a little tap. Nothing exciting.
So anyway, we got eight million votes on it.
Over 500 votes.
And Grace Kelly is winning hands down your pants.
Who is or was the most beautiful actress on TV or in the movies?
Grace Kelly 77.
Howley Berry 35.
Not even a run for her money, you notice?
Merlin Monroe 33.
Raquel Wells 28.
Sophia Loren 28.
Liz Taylor 23.
Catherine Zita Jones 21.
I find that appalling.
But these Richard's 19.
Bo Derek 18.
Elizabeth Hurley 16.
Jordan Brewster 14.
Another catch it on.
So I notice we got the spelling right on Bridget Bardot, which is nice.
At least in the Bardot part.
And we got Catherine Denev.
We got her first name with a C instead of a K-Nail one.
Who cares?
She still won't have any votes.
Here's a call from Vanita Springs.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
You rock.
One name I can't believe I actually found a name that isn't on the list.
Heather Graham.
Heather Graham.
She is hot as hell.
Natural.
Bombshell Blonde.
Who the hell is she?
She was a Boogie Knight.
She was a couple crappy movies.
Boogie Knight, the name.
They got a crappy name.
She said that was a great movie.
And we George was jealous.
He liked that big package.
Yeah, that's why I like it.
She's a hell of a good boy.
By the way, I know you can't say, but I can still say it kind of leaves us a bitch.
Okay.
Thank you.
I can say that.
I can say it kind of leaves us a bitch.
I just did.
Heather Graham.
Oh, she, her name has come up before.
Hasn't it popped up before all the time?
Yeah.
Boogie Knight, you're always telling me how to see that.
You should.
Even though it was a stuckiness.
It was a lot of powers.
Good.
That's right.
Which one?
The second one?
Sure.
Yeah, the second one.
Yeah.
Now, who did she play?
Mini-Me.
The other secret agent, Lady or something.
Whatever you say.
They all, to me, they're all pretty much the same.
Don't get me wrong.
I know.
Okay.
They all look the same to you.
Pretty much the same.
Here's Kendall.
Hello.
Neil.
I'm not talking about the women.
I'm talking about those movies.
Yes, sir.
A young Galley partner.
And one from Mad Dog.
He always pops a splinter over her as Gretivant Dustin.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Come on.
It's got to be a joke.
He takes the cake for the two worst choices if it's not.
Mm-hmm.
Now, don't put that crap on there.
We're not.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Gretivant Sustard, man.
I guess if you're putting that woman who looks like men.
Right.
Or a woman with a nice mustache.
Right?
Mm-hmm.
She is nasty.
She is grotesque looking.
But it goes to show the sports nerds out there and they just go step right along.
You catch my drift.
Mm-hmm.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hello, is that me, Neil?
Yes, sir.
Sounds like you.
Oh, great.
I have an addition for the lift.
I'm a gringo.
Can I nominate a Latin woman?
Why don't I don't know no law against it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sophia Vergara.
Sophia Vergara.
She's not an actress.
She's never known.
She's been in a few movies.
She has?
Yeah.
Could you send me a list?
Yeah, she was in a movie called The Big Something.
I forgot to name it.
Well, then I definitely need to see that.
We have posters over all over the studio.
How you do?
Yeah, I love her.
But I didn't think she qualified because...
Well, she qualified.
She's on her right now.
Quit talking to yourself out of it, man.
I would never.
Why she had her own travel show every Wednesday night?
That's how I learned to see her.
That's all he had.
We were actress.
Well, now she was in a movie, though.
Now, bring her a movie.
New to me.
Let's have it.
We're putting it down, sir.
Thank you.
Why are you being such a prick to the sky?
She's on the list, Carlos.
Sophia Vergara.
You're telling me how great she is, and then you're trying to put this guy out of it.
I'm not qualified other people based on that crazy movie.
She's in movies, man.
She's in movies.
If J.Lo can be on air, then Sophia Vergara can be on air, okay?
I'm sure she has a much-lovelier and more supple-ass.
There you go.
And while Facebook was without saying.
See, how can J.Lo be?
Isn't that ridiculous?
We put it on there just to humor that guy.
That was in the beginning of the show.
She was one of the first half-thousand selection, right?
She's got nine votes.
She does?
Yeah.
Reacons.
Here's a call from Miami.
Hello.
Hey, how are you doing?
All right.
I got a quick addition to the list.
I didn't hear you say it, but how about Raquel Welsh?
Did we leave her off?
We couldn't left her off.
She's got 28 votes.
She's number four in the run.
She calls me to lose a lot of protein as a young boy.
I'll tell you.
Here and to you.
Okay.
Thank you.
You lost a lot of protein as a young boy last week.
Yeah.
She's number four in the list.
I think that's enough.
Don't you, Carlos?
No.
He says, why didn't you say that now and a half ago?
You asshole.
You smuck.
You moron.
Is that what you're really thinking?
That's okay.
We haven't said.
So Doreen and Moor going 10 rounds on Monday for charity.
I don't think we could raise a lot of money for that.
Definitely.
She hates you, Mo.
She despises you.
She can't stand the ground that your bag spills on to.
How do you like that?
He made the clean sweep and you know something.
It's still five or six days before his one year anniversary.
That very jackass was all whipped up to a friend's about right in about it.
I get 27 years on a year.
Barry Jackson, that don't count.
See, because I don't do a sports show.
I don't do it that invigorating intoxicating sports talk.
But here's a guy that's been on the year nearly a year has now at the end of a week less than a year at Pistoff.
Everybody in a building hates him like poison and Barry Jackass is writing a mouthpiece article for Greg.
You're a good buddy.
Greg.
Grace Kelly, 79, Halley, Barry 36, Marilyn Monroe, 33, Recal Welp, 28, Sophia, Renn, 28, Greta, Franz Sustor, and none.
Bye, bye, bye!
I'm gonna make you a man.
I'm gonna be for my day.
What's next?
Dead babies?
Yes!
