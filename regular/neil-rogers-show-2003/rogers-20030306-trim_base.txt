Yeah, you're all the time oh
Greg is an email Greg it's a fight. It's a fight Greg is an email
Anyway happy Thursday too
We're just roll it along singing the song to the best we can under impossible circumstances in fact
It's fast that you sent me to start the show today is pretty shocking which one the one from Joe Joe mama
Yeah, so as I can't believe how retarded WQM sports casters are I try but I can't listen to hear something new about
Anything other than football. I don't know. I'm always just talking about golf
Whoa man first he listed all the top players in the world none of whom are at the rail name listed a bunch of people that most folks ever heard of
You notice how it like Neil Rogers is next did you hear that too late? Oh, it's way too late now. Oh, oh baby. Oh come on
That would be like going into somebody's house, you know when like stabbing the death all their kids and saying hey, let's order pizza
Well kind of pizza
Anyway, says that they really believe in
Talking about wide receivers all spring and summer. Why me? They like a wide receiver, huh?
I think we got a few people around the building like a wide one
It says please kill these guys even mad dogs sign Joe. That's probably Joe Rose
Because if we kill all those sports guys at least it opens up a little something for him
Like a little hole a little slot for the crazy dog
Speaking of crazy boy, I tell you these wackos out there having a lot of fun with our pool the last couple days
And that's good keep them off the street
Especially your people look at that. Yeah. How do you know those are people get out of here?
How do we know was your people? It's bigger. It's bigger. It's never your people
It's always you know big. It's my people. I admit it's my people. You know whether it's Bob Dylan's or whatever it is
I admit when it's my people, but your people are always in denial
That's the weekend. Yeah, right big it
What's the one place in the world you've never been to that you want to visit the most Cuba Cuba 127 votes
Do we believe it? No, so what do we know? I bet you at least four or five real votes and this pull out of 1100?
Cuba 127
I'm stood on 122. I have a feeling that was the real winner
I'm stood on I want to go there section drugs drugs and sex. Uh-huh
Don't eat no food not too much. We not too much of that wacky weed you'll get hungry and they'll be going to Mickey D's all the time and put mayonnaise on
Yeah, just slide this a mayonnaise on it and your food too
Amsterdam 122 Melbourne, Australia 105 that was really suspect that was the crank vote before we put Cuba on there
So they had like see I think we should have probably just put Australia
Right because Sydney is more popular than Melbourne isn't it?
I would think that they had that funky looking stadium. There are a lot of bags there in Sydney
New Zealand 99 that was George's choice and I still have no idea why and I don't want to know Hawaii 63 excellent choice
Hawaii beautiful beautiful pristine beaches. I'm talking about on the big island on the other island
I'm a Wahoo Allah Wahoo. There are a lot of beautiful people and
Of course because it's so congested and crowded you can like keep going oops oops. Excuse me oops
That kind of deal so he'd be 60 florists Italy 60 but ends up see this is in Rome 57
I realized that Rome was late addition because I can't say how come Rome is non air how come Rome is non air you idiots and Carlos and Eric
They just continue doing whatever they want anyway. You know they won't listen to me
Because Rome I mean seriously if you have to choose between going to Florence or a Rome Italy
It's not a choice no contest. I mean Florence is beautiful like I told I won. Carrier today, but it's not Rome
Not even close
Rome is there more things to see in Rome in
One day then you'll see in Florence if you spend two weeks there. I mean there's plenty to see in Florence especially if you like art or Jane or Ed
Paisus
But forget about that floor if you if you could only go to one believe me Rome over Florence
Trust me when I tell you have been there about 40 million times
Costa Rica 49 for those who like a young and hung and strung out
Prices right in Costa Rica maybe that everybody says all we go there to go snorkeling and scuba diving and a beautiful nature
You know anybody wants to go snorkeling can just go to the beach
I don't have to go to Costa Rica to go snorkeling those rain forests. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they go there because there's cheap
Miners prog 43 that was my choice only 42 others are going to prog that's good. Let's not overcrowded. I hear it's great
Vegas 42 and probably the reason it didn't get more than that is most of our people by now have already been to Vegas
Whether they like it or not 42 have never been there. They want to visit Vegas most stay at the MGM
That's my suggestion. I mean there's a lot of newer places, but well
I'm not gonna start lecturing or we do whatever the hell you want. They got a nice McDonald's there
And they also have that what a burger is not what the name of that joint is what a burger don't know
Yeah, everybody's always telling us about that. Oh, yeah, they got what a burger there
See if I go if I'm gonna go on a trip. I always want to check out who's got the best burgers
It's like people say oh, well. I'm thinking to move it to Kalamazoo. They got any good top shows there
You remember those calls we've only handled about two million those over the years
Yeah, I'm thinking moving to Fairbanks Alaska. They got any good talk radio there
Egypt 36 the pyramids
Galapagos islands 35 now that can't be for real can it
Uh, I don't know
Maybe they're our Darwin fans Hong Kong 34. I've done it. They want to see that to two can
If one can two can Japan 28 more abort 20 it beat the 19
The I don't understand why we don't have more than 19 because the young and the beautiful people want to go there
And we don't have the young or the beautiful because they don't know from it. Meek and I was Greece 18
What do you mean they don't know from a beath? Get out of here. Meek and I was Greece. They probably know from 18
Rhymes with queen Victoria fall 16 Valencia Spain 14 India 12 Nepal 12
I have no idea on either one of those why Portugal 8
Maria 7 diarrhea couple Capri the Alec Capri 5 and Rangoon
Four okay, that's it. I've almost loved it. I'm gonna vote yesterday
I bet you at least 20 or 30 of those were real you think maybe
And yesterday we did our office pull on the date for the start of the war and now of course they got this new business about wow
They're coming up with a compromise resolution and they're gonna squeeze a few more days on this end the couple
You know why don't you just admit it already? Let's just go ahead and do it. You know, whatever you're gonna do
Just do it. They're gonna do it anyway. Let's get it over with
I mean all this other stuff is a dog in pony show the UN resolution
That's only to try to make Tony Blair a little bit safer politically, which it's too late for that anyway
Yeah, he's out now that's the that's the whole reason that's what this is all about to try to cover his damn little white ass
The die has been cast. Let's just get it over with already
Although of course the talking head networks. They want to drag it on as long as they possibly can
So the British Daily telegraph speaking of Brits says troops told of March 17 in vision
British troops have been told an invasion of Iraq would begin on March 17 with a huge bombing campaign being launched four days earlier
The daily expression London has reported now four days earlier would be March 13
Right, right and I said yesterday my date that I picked was March 12 for the beginning of the hostilities. Mm-hmm. So
Barring any further delays. I could be like pretty damn close. You picked what day the 14th 14th or straddle right in a running and Carlos picked when the 17th well
And Miguel course was way way behind the ground war. Oh
We didn't ask the wrist next day, huh?
We put an ass back home wrist next to a little beener boy
The British tabloid quoted a senior government source who had reported had direct access to British military planning and Kuwait as saying that everything is being
Heared up toward a grounded vision beginning on Monday week
Meaning a week from this coming Monday, which would be the 17
With the bombing starting four days earlier would to be lucky 13 lucky for us unlucky for them. We hope
British newspapers also reported that Britain and the US were considering an amended new UN resolution giving Iraq a short time to disarm or face imminent military action
Dropping on a bomb a grande so there you go. It's gonna happen just a matter of time. All we can do is hope for the best right?
Yeah, sure pump some high test and hope for the best
New Star Wars as celebrities face backlash
Quite an article on the front page yesterday. It's a model star that I flipped out
You realize that people like Martin Sheen and some of the other activists are being flooded. Yeah, but it was a male, right? Right, Susan Sarandon
flooded with the male
That's right
In fact, there's a new website that's been started by a woman who claims to be a liberal. Yeah, huh?
Laurie Bardzley and her website is sizzards against celebrity pundits
She was a liberal Democrat. She told the New York Times, but after a litany of superstar anti-war testament
She said I'd had enough her site which collects signatures for a petition employing celebrities to shut up about political issues
Has garnered thousands of names. I don't I don't see I mean you can listen or not listen. That's why I'll look at it
No, no, they're their dishes and title to speak up as anybody else. No shut up. Oh, I see
So here's the supposed liberal Democrat who tells the New York Times. She's got there was you got nothing else to do
I guess a lot of time on her hands
Here's our poll question today after finding out that Arlene Francis died
That's what inspired me to do this and I know we've done this a long time ago
It's something very similar and this is not politicians that don't be giving me JFK and if they are anybody with a lot of initials
What celebrity death during your lifetime had the greatest impact on you
I think we did this about three years ago something like that long time ago and of course there've been some people died in the meantime
What celebrity death during your lifetime had the greatest impact on you and so far we have a very sure list of five Elvis
John Lennon
Kurt Cobain
Phil Hartman
Or George Harrison that's our list so far. Oh, we like to make them a short list
Then it gives these people an opportunity to add to it. Don't it right?
12 minutes after nine at five sixty WQM Happy Thursday to me a war is coming any day now
So it's relaxed just calm down. Well, let's you know
Well, let's you know what to start screaming. I have a feeling that George is gonna be
Show the war starts. Huh?
Just we're just gonna make a scene coming up fairly soon and it's only by coincidence
But I think I'm gonna be sitting back laughing up my sleeve while you're there putting us the audio from CNN and MSN
BC on right like your sleeve. That's right. Mm-hmm. It's about time
Well, see unlike what people are trying to say
You know see I was thinking about this last night. I was very depressed because you're right the Gulf War
One did bring us an enormous audience at IOD but keep in mind that we had Chuck Meyer and Tom Hopkins
I Jennifer Rimm a
Jack Newfield we had we're a news in talk stage made a new department. We don't have a news wire
Let's press a new person to QM now that's right. I have a new string. Yeah, no seriously
Stop to think about that so people are gonna turn into a sports station to find out what's going on with the war
I don't think so muff oh
Greg what are we gonna do Greg it's a fight?
I'm 13 at 560 WQM how many times did you hear about a big opportunity and you didn't act you didn't reach out and grab it and

a gentleman with a great sense of humor. Probably did won't get two votes on your poll, but he
get mine since my computer is crap right now. I don't can't even give them one vote. Keep
up the great work. West Palm Beach. It says that was, uh, let's see. The one that had the least
impact, Bonnie Lee Bakley. I think they can all agree on that, huh? Yeah, I'll come around on that.
Just light them up. Let's pull that Bobby Blake out. I see you're about five minutes to that
every day on the court TV. I can't take anymore. I feel so bad for him, you know. He's the
blathering blithering. Yeah, she had a common. I mean, there just is such a thing. Can we have
like a special category like they had a common and that's it? Christian warned her. You heard
it was a Christian, a Christian brand. Oh yeah. Yeah, he warned her that if she let Betty and
me eat her out of house and home. Now what, what is this crap? I, I have no idea. Oh, that's
the fact that you just fact me now that crap. Oh, have fun with this and our fine friend the beast.
Is this the same beast that's two six to two six to come in and get weighed in? That's him. He can't
wait, but he's trying to get laid. Oh, Clarence, you make me want to upshot Clarence with your
kaka with your kaka with your juvenile childish kaka man. Anyway, first let's do the promo for
Joe and Mark as long as they're going to be doing promos. Six to eight tonight, Joe and Mark will
be out at pro player stadium for the Maruni auto ten sales stop by to spin the deal for a prizes
tickets to see the heath of Canes and the four champions. You've had derail where all of the
players ain't playing. Six to eight at P.P. Park with Joe and Mark tonight. Stop by and see what they
look like, especially Mark. You say, wow, what are you on radio? And then this from Clarence,
it's the find a beauty for the beast promotion. How come we don't have a find a beauty for Clarence
promotion? They thought they would have a better chance to do this. Hank is trying to find the beast
that girls. So here's the deal. Any female over the age of 21. This to me sounds like solicitation
is what it sounds like to me. I mean, isn't this the station that scared of their own shadow? This
is on a billboard WQM, your solicitation station. Yes. Any female over the age of 21 should log
on to wqm.com and fill out the questionnaire that the beast is provided for you and email him your
picture. This is unbelievable. Welcome to dilatate. Holy cow. I'm sorry, maybe we can have some billboards,
you know, that just have our whole new mentality that's a gang rape is funny. Yeah, on a billboard WQIM,
gang rape is funny. That's coming next week, I think, to a billboard near you. A WQM panel of judges
will narrow the, see what they're trying to like rip off the TV crap that they're doing only.
They don't understand that nobody wants to touch him. A WQM panel of judges will narrow the field
of 10 finalists for our live broadcast, March 26th at Gantzbiz in Davy. That night live on Hank
Olberg show the 10 finalists will appear and the beast will find his beauty in a trip or two to
the Bahamas. Oh my god. Let me warn anybody out there. Get serious. Okay. You know how many
you should be? Why? You know how many entrance there are so far? Oh, one. No, you were on first.
I was right the first time. Well, who now wants to date that? What? Just because he's short and
bald and fat and ugly. Oh, and Harry. Not a big test. In fact, you ever see him together with
that Mohammed guy as a matter of fact, his legs aren't hairy. The Mohammed guy, I think,
now what do we can't find the beast? The Mohammed guy is him with a mustache.
Anyway, here's the fact that his bermaguar was an ex-green beret also. It says,
Domi is an idiot. Well, they'll be picking up my boy Thai Domi. Okay. He got three games and
Darcy Tucker got five for that grotesque incident not a little bit. We're not going to do a
hockey talk. Okay. So cut the crap. Here we go. All right. Now we're talking, baby. All
protest all the time. I'm devilish QA. You're meeting and dating and raping station for the new
omelini. However, he'll like Domi. Isn't that funny just before the show Carlos and George
were both telling me there was something in the year? Yeah. If they were sneezing and choking.
I thought there's a corporate disease in here there. Greg is in the sea. It's a germ. It's a germ.
In fact, once you give them off a butterfly net and he can run up and down the hall,
catching germs at it. Germans? Okay. Here's our pool today. Let's get serious and get back to
this because it's up there and already John Lennon's pulling away from the pack, but he hasn't
had the stiff competition yet. What celebrity death during your lifetime at the greatest impact on
you? Elvis? John Lennon. I just voted for Elvis because I had a vote for somebody to see the
results on my thing because none of them had any impact on him. I mean, I don't want to say any,
but you know, Elvis, John Lennon and Kurt Cobain, Phil Hartman, George Harrison, Chris Farley,
John Candy, John Balushi, Bruce Lee, Jerry Garcia, Thurmond Munson, Dale Earnhardt, Marvin Gaye,
and Jack Buck. Is the list so far? It's growing like leaps and bounds. What celebrity death during your
lifetime? Keep in mind during your life. We're not talking about somebody who died like 100 years ago,
not like Charlie Chaplin, isn't he dead? Yeah. Why would you think so by now when you
and cold instead? Or Bella Logosi, which we were talking about him yesterday, and it was another
really silly vampire movie on with him yesterday on one of those, I know where some are
always telling about one of those channels that I wish I could get. Yeah. It was so bad that it was
just, it was like a comedy vampire. It might have been in that wood movie, another one. Could have
been. Here's a call from Pompeo. Hello? Pop it out. Hello? Click. No, no, he wasn't his phone
was doing something. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T. You're such a hard ass man. You
just brutal. Yeah. Just cut these people a little bit of slack. Wait, please, not too much. Just a
little tiny bit. Just a scooch. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil, the year that Salino was popped,
I was 18 and that, you know, a whole girl from the education thing was going on and that really
affected me. Salina. I think anybody else under the age of 100 or both of that. They don't even
know who else he was. Salina. We'll give it a shot, though, man. So, thank you so much. We'll give
it a shot for Salina. Are we adding these on here now, Carlos? You keep track? Yes. Wait till
that day learn hard thing. I'm still in shock over that. Over that. People driving around with
bumper stickers saying, now what does it say again? In loving memory. Or in a more subtle way,
they just have a number three decal or bumper sticker. What is that for, Babe Ruth? Yeah. He was
number three. I'm trying to think of a hockey player, where number three, Marcel Proneval,
where number three would leave about a hundred years ago. That was number three. Nice going,
Neil. Thank you. That's enough to make people know that. No. I know my leaves, baby. I know my
falling leaves. You can smell them all the way from my window. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Let's see so far,
John Lennon 27, Elvis 11. I thought Elvis was on a vigness crowd. Those have pretty big votes.
Huh? He's pretty big around the middle. John Belushi 9, Phil Hartman 9, Kurt Cobain 6,
John Candy 5, Chris Farley 4, George Harrison 4, Jerry Garcia up here and Bruce Lee don't have
any. Well, one guy that called in, he better get their vote. Hop on it, man. And of course,
we haven't added the important ones under yet, like Dale Earnhardt and Marvin Gaye and Jack Buck
and Selena, right? And Thurmond? Whatever. We're building it. We're adding to it. Just relax,
just calm down. In addition to which probably by one o'clock there'll be some more dead celebrity.
Oh, well, either way that they're dropping like flies lately, right? Here's a call from North Miami.
Hello. I knew how you doing. Yes, sir. Great. John Wayne American. John Wayne is a good choice.
They're there. And don't we wish we had the Duke around today to take care of these bastards?
Oh, well, I wouldn't watch pay for watch the movie though. Okay. Anyway.
John Wayne, the Duke, the Duke, Marion, right? What about Rock Hudson? What about it? Well, do
you think he deserved to be on there? Absolutely. He was in that movie with Fay Wayne. I mean, John Wayne,
you think? Sure. Sure. Put Rock Hudson on there. You know, we got to put some of these on
there because some of the people out there don't have the balls to do it. We got to have one for
the mod of Kunis out there. Rock Hudson. What about Tony Perkins? What do you laugh at about?
I love his pancakes, man. Do we have a Perkins pancake house in South Florida? I know they have
in Tampa. I don't think so. It's pretty embarrassing. I know I had to keep dwelling on that.
Yeah. There's so many good places in Tampa as far as eateries and there are a bunch of
mugworms over there who have no taste at all. Their taste is in their tush. And yet they got
Perkins pancake cows and they got crystal. They got the head steak and shake for years before we
ever had one. And I bet you the burgers that steak and shake over there are still good. I bet you
have Sonic still. No. I never saw Sonic in Tampa. When did you ever see that? No, they're just
north of the border like the Palm Beach border. In Tampa? I don't know about Tampa, but they're
in North Florida. I don't think so. I don't think there's no Sonic in Tampa. All right.
Well, we'll find out. We got some Tampa listeners over there on the internet. We got any Sonic
over there? What do you say? You got Blabo? How about Lassiter? Is he still there? Won't see him no more.
957 at 560 WDQM. It's a death day here on QIM. Of course, when you work on a station,
every day falls in that category. So they're trying to get the beast of date. Trying to get him laid.
Huh? Good luck. What a joke that is. Anyway, speaking of exciting things, Brandy's is celebrating
their 2050 year in a shoe business in Pompato Beach. Any independent family shoe store that's

But yoko didn't survive.
Imagine if you're a bullet.
Oh, had gone away.
Yeah.
Imagine ringo sober.
One where if you can.
And George turns you wish.
Oi.
Then the circumcise of the band.
Imagine for ending up.
Eating juicy steaks.
Where have done you mess it around the dreamer.
But it's not bad being dead.
I love here with livera cheese.
And all I use good band.
I was sure the word ahead was going to give it a summer but I guess not.
10 to 560 WDQM.
We got the mad dog at Durala 1 o'clock.
Any interest in that golf tournament?
No.
Hank at Durala 3 to 550.
Short show today because we got Marlon's exhibition game.
550 to whenever it ends against the Montreal X-Pose.
Any interest in Marlon?
No.
And an exhibition game.
And then Eddie K.F.
And baseball and to a Mark overnight.
That's our somewhat aborted schedule today.
Lot of golf.
Lots and lots of golf.
Any famous golfers that we should put on list who died?
What about Ben Hogan?
Did Ben Hogan die?
I'm not sure he did.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can't remember his name.
That I died in the plane crash.
The plane crash.
Oh, what the hell was his name?
Yeah, it's right on the tip of my tongue.
What is his name?
We have that drop in in there too.
We can think of his name.
Oh, something.
Pick it up with a pee.
What was it?
No, I said I think it's with a pee but it's not pee.
What's with a pee?
Who's with a pee?
Yeah.
Well, let's look under a pee.
Okay. I'm not going to find it that way.
All the way do have...
Oh!
Yeah.
Oh, guess what I saw a little bit of the other day.
It was ending and I saw like the last two minutes.
Commando Cody.
Pain Stewart.
Pain Stewart, very good.
Thank you. You're right. Who's with a pee?
Commando Cody. How about that?
I love that show. God, I haven't seen Rocket Man.
Ancient.
Saturday morning at the Candeo Theatre in Rochester every week.
There used to be the cereals and that was one of my favorite.
Commando Cody.
As a matter of fact, Saturday morning sometimes, uh,
surfing the cable sometimes you'll see like just for filler.
Like on the movie channels.
They'll put stuff like that on there.
I love that thingy that flying pack he used to have.
He put on his back and he would fly out.
It was great.
Anyway, here's some faxes once.
I think the celebrity death that affected me most is the Budweiser spirit.
It's truly sad that he died.
But most of us fans can take solace in the fact that Moe pays tribute to his legacy by wearing him as a
To pay you are excellent.
Maybe a little insensitive but nevertheless right on target.
Here's one from John and Porte Lucey who does this and get it.
You're a good guy, John. We'd like you a lot.
But didn't I make it pretty clear in fact that even mentioned specifically no JFK and
OLBJ and OFDR. No political people.
Yeah.
John says I don't know if you're considering to be a celebrity.
No.
But JFK's assassination was a huge shock to me.
Well that's cool. I can relate to that but we'll do that another day.
What death of a political leader?
You know, like something like that.
Huh? Sure.
Some other time, not anytime soon.
Let's see. Now here's one.
Oh and I don't have any of the music.
I think you've got it all there.
I know.
Your celebrity death that affected me most was when Morris Gibb died.
A Mount Sinai hospital in January.
Not necessarily because I gave a crap about him because I was scheduled to have a procedure done there the following week.
I couldn't sleep or wake for the entire week.
And I ended up shmitting my pants in the way to the hospital morning of the surgery.
It was a little difficult trying to explain the stain of the admitting nurse but suffice to say I'm still alive a month and a half later.
Still can't get that smell out of my car though.
I pooped my pants.
That's what he's trying to say.
Boy, I wasn't easy getting that thing up here.
Anyway, good luck you sir.
Do we want to put Morris Gibb on there?
Well, I guess why not. It's recent.
Right.
Let's put Olmores on there.
What the hell?
They'll never sing together again.
And...
This is one that we hadn't thought about. I have no idea why not.
We got four hours to put this thing together.
I thought about it. Did you?
I don't want to let somebody else say it.
Wait until the war is over.
Okay.
And we're both a little older.
Ha ha ha.
The unknown soldier.
Yeah.
Okay.
Put it back in your pants. Come on.
Good morning, Neal and George.
The most influential celebrity death, Jim Morrison.
War Song, Unknown Soldier by the Doors,
which you just heard about 20 or 30 seconds too much up.
Also, Les Kider is alive and well,
and still calls football for the University of Hawaii
and Honolulu says,
Les Kider is still calling football
to the world.
He's got to be 600 years old.
Too bad we don't have a sports staff.
You know, somebody that could like look up and find one to you
when the Patterson Johansson fights were,
I would say early 60s.
Like 61 would be my guess.
Okay.
I guess that makes sense because that would be like 41 or 2 years ago, right?
Well, when Ken comes in,
he can look it up somehow, I'm sure.
Or remember it.
What about Clarence?
So, that's where Clarence is too busy trying to get the beast laid.
You know, this whole thing with the beast is starting to get in my nerves a little bit, okay?
I mean, he's okay.
He's not a bad guy.
He's a little bit pushy in the knowing,
and he did get canned out the morning show,
because he was an unprofessional.
Sixty-two, sixty-three.
What's that?
The Patterson Johansson fight.
That's what I just said.
I said 61, so excuse me.
You were alarming.
And you know what?
I think it was 61, the one I'm talking about,
because they fought twice, at least.
Actually, there was the first one was in 58.
How about that?
Yeah.
They fought like four or five times.
Okay, so like I said, you know,
who could round that time.
But my point being that he was,
that was one of his famous fight calls,
was the one where they kept knocking each other down.
One of them would get up,
and he'd knock the other one down,
and the other one would get up, and whatever.
And anyway, so that would make him,
let's see if he was about 40 when he was doing the fight,
that would make him 80 some.
But I'm just picking the number out of the year.
I bet you could find him on the web.
K-E-I-T-E-R, less Kiter.
Did I spell it right?
Yeah, it's K-E-I-T-E-R.
Just check him.
In fact, if they got his birthday,
they didn't even get most birthday.
I know what year he was really born,
if they go back that far.
Well, he must have been able to have all those records erased.
If they can go back in the 19th century,
you can probably find,
look at that, they're in 1847.
April the 17th, 1919.
So that would make him 81 and the 384 less Kiter.
Or was that Mose?
Now, give me that date again.
April 27th, 1919.
That's the date when Mose was born?
Hey, K-E-Stop!
How do you like that?
And he still keeps going like the everybody cares.
Hey, K-E-Stop!
He takes a look in and keeps on ticking.
Look in.
5670560, pound 560 on the 18T in Verizon wireless line.
And that's something less Kiter, he's still alive.
And he's got glasses, he's got like these Coke bottles glasses like somebody we know.
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
How are you doing, Neil?
Great.
When I was a kid growing up in Toronto on the New York,
we experimented with newspapers in the classroom.
And while we were doing that,
three deaths happened.
Freddie Prince, Jim Cochie,
and the one that hurt the most was Tim Horton.
Tim Horton?
Do you remember the car accident on the Queenie in Canada?
What do you mean do I remember it?
In fact, I saw the whole story of Tim Horton on the biography channel here last year.
Oh, really?
And the fact is they didn't want to let him drive home because he had a few pots
and they drove home alone in a bad storm.
Which people wouldn't like to do in their day?
They tried to talk him out of it.
They said, don't do it, number seven, don't do it to me.
But of course if he wouldn't have done it,
we might not have all those Tim Horton donut shops today.
Was he driving like a Porsche or a Ferrari or something?
Oh, he was, I don't know about that.
Yeah, he had a really fast car too.
He was a record person man.
He was a great player with a great slap shot.
Fantastic.
For the people from the Sabers.
So, Brewer and Bond Stanley and Horton.
There you go.
Bring you back memories.
Okay, thanks a lot, Polly.
Put him down there, Tim Horton.
Got it.
How about Fredy Prince and I forgot the other one he said?
Yeah, Fredy Prince and who was the other one he said?
I forgot.
Damn it.
Fredy Prince.
Yeah.
How's Fredy doing by the way?
Oh, he's still dead.
Now Miguel suggested one.
And who's that?
Mr. Rogers.
Oh, Mr. Rogers.
Geez, that just happened a few days ago.
Very good.
Thank God we got somebody under the age of 100 who is at least, you know, a little contemporaries,
as opposed to all these old people that you and I are talking about.
Now, if this guy's going to put Tim Horton on here, I guess I could put one out of
a really was devastated by and that was Bill Hewitt.
All right.
On the face of Vladimir Donald.
The bellicates.
I was devastated.
Not only the fact that when Bill Hewitt died, but when he gave him like such short
trip on the hockey hockey candidate.
Get another stopper Tom.
Hello, I was there.
We're on the air.
Let's shoot him.
Now they give me short trip.
He did at least games for like 30 some years in hockey, not in Canada.
They give him like about 10 seconds.
And I was the end of that.
Nice going there, John Shannon.
You asshole.
You idiot.
That's my message for John Shannon over there, at least TV.
In fact, he's probably right up the street there.
Maybe Rimmer will pass the message log to him.
Be sure and pass the message, Rimmer.
In between getting me those drugs you haven't gotten.
You asshole.
No, that wasn't for Rimmer.
That was for John Shannon.
You asshole.
That was for Rimmer.
Because he didn't give me my drugs yet.
So I watched part of the Panther Laws pretty coma inducing game last night to Colorado 3-1.
And I didn't see Rimmer crap as a pantset officer.
It must not have taken as many antibiotics as he was threatening.
5-6-7-0-5-60.
Pound 5-60 on the AT&T and Verizon Marlos Line.
Celebrity deaths during your lifetime.
Which one had the greatest impact?
And what a list we've got so far.
If we could just wave a magic wand and bring all of these people back.
Wouldn't that be something?
4-6-7-0-5-60.
You know, I don't want to be militant.
But anybody who don't like the doors in Jim Morrison, to me, is just an asshole.
They're dumb.
They don't like music.
You don't like the doors.
You don't like the ears.
If you don't like the doors, we don't like you.
I was back.
We hate you.
You don't like the doors.
We wish you would get like some growth in your ass and just die over your death.
Don't you love her, manly.
Don't you need her, manly.
All right.
Don't you love her, manly.
And tell me what you say.
Don't you ever, manly.
Want to be her, manly.
Don't you love her, manly.
You listen to the doors and then you think about some of this rap crap that the kids are listening to now
to last about 30 years now, this garbage that they pass off as music seriously.
Yeah.
Not not 30, but like about 30, man.
About the last 10, 15 years of innocentness swill.
That that that has started to music.
Oh, man.
It's just, uh, and what's the comparison?
And then of course that makes us dated and old and, you know, all I crap, which is true.
What celebrity death during your lifetime had the greatest impact on you Elvis, John Lennon, Kurt Cobain, Phil Hartman, George Harrison, Chris Farley, John Candy,
John Belushi, Bruce Lee, Jerry Garcia, Thurman Munson.
They'll earn heart.
Marvin Gaye, Jack Buxelina, John Wayne Rock Hudson, Jim Morrison, Morris Gibb, Tim Horton, Freddie Prinz, and Mr. Rogers.
You're right, that guy, the Freddie Prinz guy, and he had another good one, I would forget about it.
We'll get it.
We'll get to it.
Let me find the way.
We'll get to all the dead people today.
10, 13, at 560 WQM, your death station for the new millennium.
If your old Macri's is dead, if it stinks, if it's worn out, if it's lumpy and bumpy, you know, over a million people are about Macri's the smart way over the phone.

I mentioned this last week is the Osborne one yeah the Dipetsey spot
Yes
Yeah a couple of bloody magicians
He's great on that spot anyway. I mean I can take them for like in small doses right because they're old news
But that spot just does it for me first. They turn into Donnie Marie and then he wakes up in a cold sweat and
Sharon turns out to be far as Anderson. Oh
That's just that Ozzy's the funny one everybody else just a noxious right
Exactly that's put up with Johnny all doors all day no more wars just doors

Oh look at this fricking pancake because 1711 North University just south of sunrise boulevard that's right by me
How about that?
Well Haka I don't know about that good question. I don't need to be going to Perkins pancake house because everything they have is
Fattening yeah, not like other restaurants
I beg your pardon not like those other restaurants. No, no, I'm serious for anything that I would like there
That's my point, you know like French toast mm-hmm
Anyways, Sonic you're all across central Florida from Melbourne on the east coast to Largo on a west coast
But none in Tampa proper. Told you yeah, and crystal what I knew I saw them in North Florida, but you know not in Tampa
Did we already hear about this or is this something new? We have a crystal at 901 west sunrise on the corner of northwest
9th, which is power line sunrise and power line is a crystal?
Okay, no, I think we already knew that yeah
I mean if you have to choose between going away in Arnold and Royal Castle, we might whiff some out for you
A white hot a white hot and then of course you got
Crazy John
So we don't want to start promoting crystal until they spend some money right here's happy
2070 anniversary. Oh, you have Bob Marley on list once Daniel see the know what we do now Bob Marley man
I don't want to put all the Debbie courting artists because that'll be a very long list. Oh, I think proper and buddy Holly yeah, Richie valence
Right, right?
Well, I mean see the question is what's the every death during your lifetime?
And the greatest impact on you I can't see that the big bopper had a great impact anybody unless of course you were shantilly laced
If you did that then I can understand it
So let's not get to have a Roy Orbison
Uh huh you walk over the other grunt my favorite part
Like I said, how about Roy Orbison
Definitely boy Orbison
You think yeah, I was crying over that
What was that because you were those silly glasses?
I tell you one thing that'd be a good pull who who was uglier Roy Orbison or the beast
All of it now bet your word of boy got laid more than the beast. Well, thank you Moses you're the best baby. I love Moses. Yes, you can do that
Okay, we will only me cutting it close Monday is only like
We said you had another week right right? Well, it's not cutting it that close
Well, if I have to depend on remember to get something done
No, I certainly did me good with the doctors
But as far as anything else I just can't count on him. He just you know
Shine me the whole time he was here just so there was 40 below zero outside. He's just uh he's not what he used to be
You know plus he's sick
He's under the weather. He's got a lot of excuses. What did he used to be?
cheap
Now he's cheap and sick anyway. How we're listening on the internet says although he probably won't get a lot of it
Oh, yes, Sam kinesen of course sir
I mean not that we like him or anything you do understand you've heard about those subliminal self help tapes that help you learn
Well, you sleep great idea, but who knows if they really work now decibel houses proud to present the self help tape library
That's guaranteed to work. It's Sam kinesen's quick study cassettes
Hey you want to speak Spanish?
K-Passa
Wait a minute
Come on, count you more on
Yes, it's a proven technique the army is used for years in a week
You'll not only be speaking Spanish you may have forgotten English and there are hundreds of other self help tapes
Despite how to lose weight.
Hey, you want to slim down, you loser?

So get ready for bed and get ready to learn.
Fast with Sam Canis and Quick Study tapes.
The message is loud and clear.
How about right to check out right now?
Now I put your money.
That 24 or 5.50.
Here's one of this is how a princess died.
Don't get in that Mercedes.
No princess died.
We're begging please.
Paparazzi's coming.
After you.
You're gonna crash.
If you were wrong.
No more rich guy for you.
Oh!
Princess die is gone.
Oh, Princess die.
Princess die is gone.
She's really gone.
When you do a tunnel.
Hello, wall.
And what about two pack?
Now see, last time we did like dead recording artists, we left two pack off and the brothers
got upset about that.
So be sure we put two pack on there.
Okay.
If we put two pack on then we gotta put Biggie on as well.
Biggie Smalls?
Yeah.
How about Biggie Wilson?
Notorious PIG.
Notorious PIG and two pack?
Chikur.
Yeah.
Anyway.
So we are putting Princess die in there.
Don't tell me no.
I didn't say that.
Yeah you did.
When did I say that?
I don't know.
Oh, and I see here.
Oh, look at this.
I can't handle this.
Now this is gonna.
I open up a Pandora's box and it's stunk.
Man.
Time to take a bath, Pandora.
Audrey Hepburn should be on your list as Ken.
I think so.
Why not?
Look at all the dead people.
So little time.
I'll tell you another one that I would like to put on here now.
I didn't realize what a good category this was.
And one that I actually might vote for if I had a chance.
Well, so many great actors who are dead, you know?
Well, right.
I don't know.
Seriously, William Holden is one of my favorites and Peter Finch.
Maybe should have broken it down, huh?
Just when we discovered him over on the side of the pod, Peter Finch.
I'm in Madness.
I don't know what's going to take us anymore.
Right?
Right.
But I'm not putting all those on here.
I'm just mentioning and passing.
There's so many possibilities.
And remember, there were a lot of Finches?
Humphrey Bogart.
Long before Greg Reed was walking up in Omaha, Roland, Oswald's in his hand.
Humphrey Bogart was doing it on a keen on mutiny.
And I still can't think of that actor in that movie who just, man, I see a good looking guy.
I know he's dead.
Now when he died, that impacted me.
I wish I would have known about it.
Also, what's his name?
Brandon DeWilder.
Brings the tear to my eye.
He died.
Oh, you know what?
Movie was on speaking of that.
Shane.
Shane was on, which I had never seen with Gary Cooper.
And Brandon DeWilder is about what?
Three years old in that movie or something like that.
I don't, you know, every time I mentioned Brandon DeWilder, I guess I should do a disclaimer.
Because I'm not really into three year old little boys, but you're talking about the older Brandon.
We understand.
I'm talking about all fall down like with what's his name?
Carl Maldon.
But you should see Shane.
It's historical.
And more in baby school.
It is big penis.
I should see Shane.
It's a classic.
They've made us watch it in school.
I don't watch cowboy movies.
It's different though.
It is.
It was not about four times over the weekend.
That's when I saw little pieces of it.
So often ripped off.
So many, you know, things come from that movie Jack Palin says in it.
I mean, it's just.
I'll watch it.
I'll watch it just to make you happy.
After I watch Shawshank Redemption and forget Shawshank.
Before the July.
Audrey Hepburn.
Let's see Sabrina Roman Holiday Breakfast at Tiffany's says thanks.
Can we put her on a disc for you?
Can't so be sure to vote for Audrey Hepburn.
Even though that does date a lot of us because they are the younger people in the audience.
Who the hell's Audrey Hepburn?
Who's that?
Who that?
Now you're throwing a lot of names out there.
How many of these are actually going on the list?
Like Peter Finch is going on, right?
No.
No.
Okay.
No, no.
I'll give you the ones that I wrote in the Jim Morrison Morris gift.
Tim Horton, Freddie Prince, Mr. Rogers.
Jim Croci, Bob Marley, Roy Orbison, Sam Kinesen, two pack, Princess Dine,
notorious B.I.G. and Audrey Hepburn.
Okay, good.
Got it.
Got it.
We're building the list.
It's going to be a big one.
And I'll tell you one thing.
The guy that was talking about Dale Earnhardt.
Yeah.
See, I understand where he's coming from.
Okay.
But the fact that it matters is this isn't country kiss.
If this is, he's on a wrong station in the wrong audience.
Dale Earnhardt does have six.
But this isn't exactly the Dale Earnhardt audience, if you guess my drift.
Hey, it's racing and you know what that means.
They're not heavy duty and do.
Oh, no, good.
No, not too much.
Not my people.

That's right.
I'm going to give it a good squat and leave a little souvenir for our Duke Canadian
Faggot friend.

got a war coming up very soon and you know when you have a war you know what you have dead people
a lot of dead people that's right four minutes before I'm in a QA let me tell you right now if
your carpets look like somebody died on them maybe they smell like a whole bunch of things died on
them possible because everything gets into your carpet you step on it you walk across it you grind
all that schmutz and crap into it and your animals do all sorts of amazing things even more dropped
to pile according to that one bit so get dry concepts in there to make them look and smell and feel
just like brand new not look just new but actually be brand new because they suck out even the
deepest dirt in there way down in the fibers of your carpets and they make your carpets exactly
like brand new dry concepts technicians are schooled and certified by the Institute of Inspection
Planning and Restoration which means they really know their crap inside and out they'll leave
your carpets soil free vibrant and color smelling lemony fresh soft of the touch they'd run a couple
of hours that's one of the reasons I've been using them for over 20 years in my home is because
they do such a super job and they'll give you guys a written guaranteed price before they start
doing a job so whether it's time to clean your carpeting your area rugs your poultry leather
furniture it's time for dry concepts if you have a problem with pet orders or milder orders caused
by water damage just like magic they'll make those disappear too so you ought to yourself to try
these folks was because you'll never call anybody else again that's guaranteed call dry concepts tool

We're not muzzled here, are we?
Here we are!
Anyway, here's the facts that says...
The bananas are cast!
The land blocker!
Michael Landon and Lauren Green. I don't think we're gonna put any of them on it.
Michael Landon maybe, huh? Maybe.
Eh.
Because of his repertoire.
Yeah, because he was done so many different things like House and the Fury and...
Huh?
Right.
Yeah.
And what about Uncle Milti? What about Louis Delilah? Milton Burl?
Whatever.
He was Mr. Television.
I understand.
You don't think?
Did his desk come suddenly?
For some of us...
It's not a question about how that came or not.
It was like no surprise to anyone.
That's not the point.
We were not asking how the death came when it was like suddenly...
...but it was his wife shot.
We could celebrate he death during your lifetime at the greatest impact on you.
Uncle Milti was like...
You know, for a lot of us...
How about George Burns speaking of...
Yeah!
How about Red Scotland?
Yeah!
Red Fox.
Yeah!
For Nancy Kess.
Well, you know, we have to draw the line somewhere, okay?
We draw the line and we draw the line at nine.
Here's one that says, how about the astronauts of the Challenger?
I was playing hooky from the school.
I was watching the launch live.
It was such a big thing because the teacher was on board.
Thanks as Gill and Homestead.
Well, it was the Challenger was very sad.
Remember the school teacher's name?
Christa McCullough.
Yeah, that's right.
Very good.
I remember Dick McCullough who used to play with the Detroit Tigers.
Remember him?
No.
Oh, well, we're not putting her on her either.
Let's see.
Here's the fact that says there are sonics in Braydenton, Lakeland
and Orlando when they're kicking ass.
Huh, surprisingly good.
I didn't think anything of it until I went there.
Really?
Yeah.
I think I'm thinking ever so on.
Fixed lices of bacon and like they butter the buns and it's just it's just good.
That's why they're not in South Florida, right?
Talking about Earnhardt, it says the Yahoo's up here even have personalized checks
with the remembering a legend slogan in his number three.
Of course, they bounce like a stock car off the wall.
There you go.
That's bad like a stock car off the wall.
Very insensitive Glenn.
Excellent.
And he's moving to the second place.
I don't like that.
Even though it's not your Yahoo station.
It is John Lennon's got 92.
They Earnhardt's got 32.
Elvis only 30.
Phil Harp in 26.
Kurt Cobain 22.
And John Belushi 21.
What about South Beach?
Johnny Versace.
It says everybody.
Yeah, sure.
No.
What are you going?
Sure.
Did I ever get one call about that?
No.
Never got one call about Johnny Versace.
You okay?
You got to pack the bag.
Huh?
You got to facts about it.
Saying what?
Did he with one of yours?
Oh.
What a shocked end is.
Next, they'll be picking on Calvin Klein.
5670560, £560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Don't forget tonight from 6 to 8.
Joe and Mark will be out at Pro Player Stadium for the Maruni Auto Tensayle.
Stop by the spin to prize wheel for tickets, spin to the wheel.
And you might get tickets to see the heat, the canes, or the four championships in throughout,
with all those big names.
They are not participating in a big golf tournament.
They used to be a real big deal when people used to play there and somebody heard of.
1105 at 560, WQM, we're just rolling along here.
You know, I got so much crap too.
And I'll never forget to any of it.
Go to our website and find all the crap.
Okay?
Look up all the crap.
We got about 30, right?
That's the reason we're doing it.
Here's a call from my mama.
Hello.
How you doing to you?
Long time no talk.
Yes, sir. It's all my mama.
Yes, sir.
I got a spy report in a name.
Okay?
The spy report is on the internet.
I listened on the internet and I was listening to the mad dog the other day.
Yeah.
Now, when you're on, when the commercial comes on, silence.
When mad dog's on, the commercial comes on, mo-howard is on.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
Are you kidding me?
I swear I would lie to you.
That's a fate worse than death.
I'm telling you now because, oh, Lord, it's bad.
Anyway, the name is Ronnie Van Zand from Leonard Skinner.
Ronnie Van Zand.
Leonard Skinner.
Okay.
That's the name in the closing.
Sus Coleman.
By Lord.
Okay.
Now, what I'll put in the money, are we Ronnie Van Zand?
He want my opinion?
No.
Okay.
Now, we're not putting the money.
I mean, you know, he's entitled and plus we don't get all that many calls from Y Mama.
We don't hear prairie from him that often.
Why?
But the answer is no.
56670560, pound 560 on the 18th.
There's no point in putting people on here.
I'm going to get any votes.
I mean, he'd get like one or two.
What's the point?
We can have a million people on here who would get one or two votes.
Right.
I mean, we want to start doing all that.
See, maybe I didn't do this right.
You know, we've done musicians before.
We should have narrowed it down, probably.
But, at least this way will kill four good hours.
Because if you were just to do actors and actresses, just movie star people, you can just do actors and then actresses and et cetera.
Ernest Borgnein.
He's dead.
Phil Silver's.
You don't think Ernest Borgnein is dead?
I don't know.
Look at Carlos.
Please.
Why did he always look dead?
Like I said, look at that little bean or boy.
Oh, Ernest Borgnein must be dead.
What about Dean Martin?
What about him?
What about Jerry Lewis?
He's still alive.
But, yeah, boy, just hanging on.
I saw another picture in yesterday that disease he's got, that illness.
His face is like, oh, my head is almost as big as the beast and Joe Rose.
Almost.
Maybe Joe has Jerry Lewis disease.
Do you ever think about that?
No.
Huh?
It's a possibility.
He's in proportion.
Joe Rose?
The rest of all of the people here.
His head is as big as him apartment buildings as I've seen.
I like the Wii Wii.
Yeah.
Except for that.

Well, I guess he's...
I thought you were going to say BB King, but he's still taking his bloodshurs.
You know, it is so spineless that they can't play that kind of music.
I love that song.
Yeah.
We miss it.
Love the show, Neil.
That's the best we can do.
All right, thank you for the great day.
And with a little muzzle on.
I got an idea.
How about if I do the whole show that way every day, okay?
Okay.
And we can do the billboards that can have pictures of us with muzzles over our face.
Like it's a Greyhound track, you know?
I'll send you up one of those red rubber balls.
Oh no, we got that in Greg's mouth right now.
By the way, Neil.
Yes.
Organized it's still alive.
Oh my god, they hit him with five shots.
And he's still alive.
Born in 1917.
Yeah, that makes him like 83 and 6 is like 88, 89, something like that.
86.
He's waiting for them to make that McCale's Navy movie.
What did I say he was?
86, like I said.
Yeah, he's still alive.
Ernest Borgneye.
Well, that's good.
We got to have a few of us old parts still hanging around.
What about Elizabeth Montgomery?
See, we've done those.
I know I want to do all of those again, you know?
I did something wrong on this thing.
It's like coming on glued now.
It's, you know, too all-inclusive.
Yeah.
We should have narrowed it down a little bit.
Well, we'll just decide.
We'll be arbitrary.
We'll decide if we like it, you know, you say it and if we like it, yes.
And if not too bad, you lose.
So it works.
It's kind of like the way the president works.
You know, you don't like it.
Yeah.
The rest of the world.
They're putting on a dog and pony show.
They're going to give them a couple more days.
And then they're going to do this resolution thing
and it would pass us fine.
And if not, well, that's fine too, you know?
We want to try to make it look good as proud of what it was possible.
But in the meantime, all this inspections thing has been doing
as a dog and pony show just to give us time to put all the pieces together in place.
You think that's going to be it?
We're going to hit them hard.
We're going to hit them fast.
We're going to hit them from all sides upside down inside out.
That's going to be it.
But I'm being.
And in the meantime, the media is on here.
I'll pontificating.
But, you know, just kill them a lot of time.
Like we're doing here today.
That's what we're here for.
Just to kill a lot of time.
Much once again, I want to remind you, President Bush, saying he's going to have a news conference tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern.
Our coverage will be-
Oh, my God.
You ready for that?
Yeah.
And President, I'd say news conference eight o'clock tonight.
I think he might drop the big one tonight.
Right on Helen Thomas's forehead.
Here's a call from Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
A suggestion for the poll.
What about Carol O'Connor?
Carol O'Connor is great.
That should have been the first name that came to my mind.
Thank you, sir.
You have a nice day.
And you too.
Thank you.
How could we forget him?
Old.
Well, drugs is my excuse.
Well, what do you mean old?
You're old and I'm high.
Oh, and that's why we forgot it.
Right.
You have to be old.
Remember Carol O'Connor?
No.
Everybody.
I don't know anybody who didn't like Carol O'Connor.
Saturday night on CBS.
Eat it.
It's back from the dead.
It's the 20th anniversary of all of the family.
Oh, look he did.
If you need John Jell-O-We.
Daddy, don't be such a pro.
What's he?
Now, what ever happened to my little girl?
Look at this.
Why don't you push yourself away from the table, huh?
Maybe you have a salad once in a while.
Daddy, don't you know how many of the world's people have never had a decent meal?
Again with the charity Shwela.
Well, it's true.
So, why don't you send them the bones from the teige you had for breakfast?
I'm about to move.
Why do we have oxygen?
I can't.
You did that, George.
He was pushing up days, you smile.
Oh, now watching.
The last episode was all a band dream.
It seemed so bad to me.
Look, who was your back there, Beatit?
Who's the dead off?
You can get me in at a beat.

My, my, and local, this is Fort Real Phi Sikki.
I'm waiting, wait.
Neon God.
I didn't know he was dead.
He's an American music icon, the original country punk.
And now he's reaching across the Atlantic to pay tribute to England's greatest punk band.
It's the best of Johnny Clash.
Bushery don't like it.
Rockin' the Casbah.
The man in black is back on track with a very special version of Train in Vane.
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all.
Did you stand by me?
No way.
Yes, London's calling, and they're saying hello to the best of Johnny Clash.
If I go there will be trouble.
And if I stay it will be trouble.
Hello, this is Johnny Clash.
And I shot this commercial in Reno just to watch you buy.
My brand new record.
So you gotta let me know.
Should I stay or should I go?
The best of Johnny Clash.
Look for it in the combat country section of your local record store.
Thank you, family.
11.19 at 5.60 W.A.M.
He's gonna be on it list pretty soon.
Once you think in fact here's the fact that it says,
I like the death poles.
Here's an idea for tomorrow.
No, not tomorrow.
Sometimes soon but not tomorrow.
Who will be the next celebrity to die?
And then it's got a short list here.
Phanamus.
Ronald Reagan.
Tury Lewis.
Bob Hope.
Ernest Borg-Nine.
Good start.
Robert Reagan.
Let's cross him off.
He's a celebrity.
He made movies.
He made movies.
Oh, that's right.
He was a celebrity.
He was a...
He was on G.E.
A better idea.
And then we made him the president.
We got him a bunch of that Buster Brown shoe polish.
And there's another celebrity.
Yes.
You never know when he's going to die.
Oh.
Oh, what about...
Oh, that's right.
I got Bob Hope on here.
Now you're not gonna put Mo on there, are you?
That's bad.
We don't do death wishes on our co-workers like some other people do.
You know what I'm saying?
People that go on talking about a bullet in the head, things like that.
You don't do anything about a wish.
Yeah, right.
You're not fooling me.
Muck told me all about you.
5,670560, 0.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Martles Line.
How is that Q&M website coming for the Beast, huh?
How's that coming off?
That's just got at least thousands of broads on here, huh?
Who is he killing, huh?
Well, why are we even doing that?
Isn't that embarrassing?
Are we just doing that to humiliate and degrade him and say,
we went...
We...
We...
We Hank went through this herniotic effort, this tremendously embarrassing attempt to get this guy laid and he still couldn't do it?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
No shame.
No shame, Beast, though.
Here's a lady in Alamarana.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Um...
I don't think you have Gilder Rednearn.
That was a really shocker to me.
That's a good choice.
Yeah, I love her.
Okay, thanks, we don't...
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Gilder Rednearn, who was married to Gene Wilder, yes.
And we liked both of them.
And of course, that Ilianna Gross-Latin came along and started imitating Gilder Rednearn.
And that was Dan Rosanna-Danah thing, what?
Stole her whole hat.
Stole the act.
That bitch Ilianna Gross-Latin.
Man, oh man, we got some losers in that town.
Wow.
Woo!
Nasty, nasty, one-dimensional means spirited hostile anti-human.
Linkin' Diaz-Belard makes me want to fart.
Why farted in the shower last night?
I mean, I took a shower late yesterday because you know it's good for your sinuses and the whole deal.
Right.
And I'm gonna tell you, I let loose in that and it was the...
Maybe one of the most enjoyable experiences of my lifetime.
Fart transcending sex, transcending even a fine gourmet meal at the world's greatest steakhouse.
And be away beyond that.
And I'll see if you'd taken that duct tape and viscene and sealed up the shower.
Oh!
I've enjoyed it all day long.
I'd probably still be in there.
22 past 11 at 560 WQAM, we got the golf stuff coming up later on today.
We got the great golf tournaments.
I still can't get over that.
It's just amazing to me.
How can anybody listen to that?
I mean, we don't care.
No.
It's like an invitation for people to tune out because we're at the rally and nobody of any interest is a plan there.
We're getting there.
We don't care.
We don't care they're paying for it.
Here's Evan Sura.
Hello.
Yes sir.
Hi Neil.
Great.
There's like a pretty insular leg.
One of which he mentioned yesterday.
Three.
Jack Lemon.
And Walter Rappau.
Yeah.
Who is the last one?
Walter Mathau.
Walter Mathau.
Okay, thanks.
My thing is stuck.
Your thing.
Yeah.
What thing would that be?
My thing.
I'm on a paper.
I just put more paper in there.
Maybe I put too much of it.
I put too much of it.
I just ran out.
Well, see, I put it a bunch of extra just to cover you on that end.
But now it's all fixed.
I'll tell you one thing.
I have so little technical problem here.
You know, it's just amazing.
You think that I actually had some idea what I was doing?
And you think that maybe the equipment here is well maintained because I'm the one that's in charge.
And I'm sure it is opposed to well.
Anyway, here's Tracy, one of our regularers.
She says my vote is for Fred Rodgers.
We did put him on there, Mr. Rodgers.
He didn't get any votes, by the way.
I don't know.
Are we putting those other three on there?
Mr. Rodgers has a mind-wanted out-
What, who?
No!
Okay, Dudley Moore.
Just checking.
The last one I added was Gilda Redner.
We got it.
And the rest of these people, I human him, say, well, that's a good idea.
And we just nod my head and then we just roll on.
Oh, all right.
But with such a kind man replaced by crap like Barney.
All along I thought he was the molester when it was the priests.
My husband and I had our first burgers from Stake and Shake last week in Lakeland.
And though the shakes were great, we were shocked to find the steak burgers were horribly thin and melee,
even worse than McDonald's or crystals.
He had a Stake and Shake burgers down their drain.
Is that indicative of their burgers?
I'm afraid to say that now it is.
We couldn't imagine you'd waste your push on meat like that.
And I won't.
I got better meat than that.
So anyway, just go there and get the shakes.
Haven't I been saying that for a long time?
Yeah.
Stake and Shake, let me down, man.
I'm the one that built them up to like everybody and their brother wanted to try it.
And all of a sudden their meat went bad.
Well, it happens to the best of us.
Freddie Mercury from Queen says DJ Valentine.
Freddie Mercury should be on her, I guess, huh?
We are the fact of the champions.
Freddie Mercury, get him on there.
I'll read the whole list of what I got here.
And maybe some of the are not on there yet.
Okay, thank you, DJ Valentine, whoever you are.
What celebrity death during your lifetime had the greatest impact on you?
See, so again, like when somebody says the guy before I had three,
it doesn't, it's not responsive to the question.
We're not just asking for a list of dead people.
What celebrity death during your lifetime had the greatest impact on you?
Grab you by the nuts and twisted you around and said,
holy crap, that's bad, you know?
Do they get it?
No.
No, they never get it.
Carol O'Connor, see, I think right off the bat, I'm so glad somebody called it on that.
We were leaving him off.
Carol O'Connor was just great.
He wasn't just Archie Bunker.
He was, and then the sad tragic that his kid with the drugs and dying and,
oh, then he had a sue the guy that was the drug, remember, supply the drugs?
I mean, he died a nasty death, a broken man, a just very sad.
That goes to show that God works in mysterious ways, boys and girls.
Carol O'Connor, Elvis, John Lennon, Kurt Cobain, Phil Hartman, George Harrison.
George Harrison ain't doing much, is he?
Not anymore.
He's only got eight votes.
He's right down there with Mr. Rogers and John Wayne.
That's an interesting trifecta.
Chris Farley, John Candy, John Belushi, Bruce Lee, Jerry Garcia,
Thurman Munson, Dale Earnhardt, Marvin Gaye, Jack Buck, Salina, John Wayne,
Rob Hudson, Freddie Mercury, JFK Jr., Jim Morrison, Mori, Morris Gib, Tim Horton.
Friends, Mr. Rogers, Jim Cochie, Bob Marley, Roy Orbison, Sam Kittison,
Tupac, Princess Dinosaurous, ViG, Audrey Hepburn, Rick Nelson, Frank Zappa, Michael Landon, Milton Burrell,
Stevie Ray Vaughan, Harry Carey, Roberto Clemente, Sherry Lewis, and Gilder Ragnar.
That's my list as the right of this moment.
Okay, are we on the same page?
Yes.
27th, past 11th, at 560 WQM, and all you guys out there, no matter what anybody tells you,
size makes a big difference.

Diddy Tucket or Diddy Cocket?
Never watched his hair or seem to have a care, Kobe.
His name was Kirk, now he's pushing up their Kobe.
Wiping drew from his chin, doing arrow-wrapping.
When Kobe.
Your bottle was hot, and now it's Kirk, they ain't got Kobe.
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.
Kobe.
Made a million and I'll never took a shower, Kobe.
He's a number one hit in heaven, big mosh pit, Kobe.
He'll be elders to King and say grunge was my thing, Kobe.
So if you're filled with doubt, don't take Kirk's way out, Kobe.
He got high, said goodbye, then he died.
Kobe.

mistake. But there's celebrities I guess. Right? Yeah. Whatever you say. Don't
forget we got a lot of golf stuff all this week on QA. Here's a call from Tampa.
Hello. What about Raymond Burr? What about him? He died. That was that had a big
impact on me. Did it? Were you a permason fan? Very big permason fan. That's what got
me into the work I'm in now. And what is that? Wheelchair construction.
What about tiny meal? This guy doesn't eat it at the sauna. He said, what is it?
Hamilton's burger. But Neil, very important question. What did I have a duty you?
I know it was some nut. I knew it was some idiot. I wasn't sure which one. And
nobody took the rope. Who should be singing that song? Right? Like that. Because
you always got like something over his pussy. He's a gagged. Maybe he's got
like some of that duct tape on it. And it's plus two five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. North Miami. Hello. Hey. Yes. Sure.
Yes. About. Um, there's a top of the show. Man. How about that?
Prinsies. Who? Prinsies. Diana. Yes. She's on there. She ain't doing too well.
She's got ten. She's like a middle of the pack. Prinsies. Die. She's still
dying over there. So what do you think? You think there was a set up? I think it was a
murder. No. I don't really care. Five six seven. See, one thing about that whole
royal family. I think it just it just frosted my ass. It just makes me angry. But
other than that, I couldn't care less about any of it. Although I would recommend that book
by Kitty Kelly, the royals for a lot of amusement entertainment purposes. And then when you
read about the Baton Burgers and you find out that the house of Windsor that are all
a bunch of Nazis anyway. And then you say, oh, that explains a lot of it. Sure. Yeah.
Now we're beginning to understand. Do I understand the stuff? Oh, keep stracking
everybody. Yeah, even Bonnie Prince Charlie. Five six seven oh five 60. Yes, he
that. That thing in the golf and the kielson those love big high stockings that go up
to your top of your ass. Don't forget the knickers. And the knickers like Moe was
wearing yesterday, those checkered knickers. That's what it's all about. So while
you're people off their plane golf, just keep that in mind. He's a knicker lover.
Didn't he used to do the games to the knickers?
Boxers? Here's a call from Papa. No, hello. Yeah, how you doing? Pretty good. I just
wanted to say I can't believe that a no-talent bum like Kurt Coblam could have 24 votes on this poll.
But that's 28. 28. He's moving up baby. Now that I've paid the owner. Anyway, hey, the worst
thing I think had the most impact. This may not be your thing, but rather than I'm going to ask
it from my thing, we want to know about your thing. Okay, my thing would be brand-inly,
Bruce Lee's son. As if his father's death wasn't tragic enough, the fact that he was an
up-and-coming star and an excellent martial artist and died very young tragically and mysteriously
in my opinion. But hey, it was mysterious. Well, the fact that I'm here, he's in this movie and
he's getting shot like hundreds of thousands of times in all these scenes and all these action
sequences and all of a sudden if it's one scene where he's supposed to take one shot,
his shot in the stomach and fatally killed and you know, it's suspicious. But anyway,
I'm maybe a conspiracy theorist. Okay, I'm going to show up to good work, sir. Thanks a lot.
Brand-inly, the guy who said to Bruce Lee did also say brand-inly, so now he's the
guy with each guy. Well, put him on there. We can put him down at the combo. You know something
no matter how he's a combo, he's just crying. He's like, combo.
Camba is something you get at Sonic. Ooh, that does sound good. With little gin and tonic,
you know, you have your choice of bread, regular bun and also the thick slice toast. No, butter.
In a burger joint? Yeah, holy crap. And we're talking like thick slices of toast for a bun.
Like french toast. Yeah, like thick french toast. That sounds like I'm going to go out and give
you some french toast. Not, I can't do that. But boy, I do love french toast. Like powdered sugar
on it. And not just with regular, regular syrup on it, but like with the boys in very syrup?
Sure. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's good. You don't even need the syrup. Just the hard part. Now, what was
I just going to say that was so important before that brand-inly? Oh, yeah. No, seriously, about
suspicious. He brought up a good point. Suspicious celebrity deaths. Yeah. Bob Crane? Sure. Well,
was that the George Reaves? Yes, it was. What? I thought the girl's dead shot. And what about
suspicious rams with sedvicious? Right. And malicious. Oh, there's the villain Bob's show they're
promoting. The things that their husbands could say on television could conceitably have some
impact on what they're wise. I mean, one thing about Bob, you know, you think that he
mought to floor up with him in the election. Wait till you see them on 60 minutes. He's just going
to like scrape the wall with him. It's going to be a suck fest. And you know, yeah. The first thing
Bob is going to say, well, at least my penis works, Bob. You know, and he'll go downhill from
there. Yeah. That's right. Marked my words. It was a war wound. And the second thing's going to be
you call that a penis 1041 at 560 WQ. I'll tell you guy who knows his parts and that's Jeff Cohen
over there at the pizza lot. He's seen him all. He's seen every kind of well. You know what I'm talking
about? If it's alive, he's a known it and smelled it and touched it. Pizza loft is some of some
the world's best chow and tonight is Thursday. I plan not like plan. It's a biker night. All the
bikers come on the red plant is now what it is. Thursday is bike night at the loft either location
you show up on a motorcycle. You buy one dinner. Get the second one for app price every night. There's
something special going on. And all the time there's something really great going on. Great
delicious fresh food cooked to your order. Nothing soggy. No rubbery pasta and teeny tiny prices
which you'll enjoy bringing a whole family and all your friends over and over again. And maybe
you can say hi to the rimers pizza loft has got those combination dinners. You can try a little
bit of this and a lot of that chicken, veal, seafood, fagazza pizza, three different kinds of great
pizza. Don't forget calzone, super sub garlic rolls that are just or gas miktors so they're
good. Jeff has it all at the world flaming pizza log and for take up delivery and catering which
they do is to append his job of in the daily location, which is on university drive between
Griffith and 595. Kitty corner the army low cafe right. Pion pier went imports with tons and tons of
parking for the a daily location called 9 5 4 9 1 6 8 8 8 8 9 1 6 8 8 8 8 the
portions are gigantic. And like I said, you won't you'll laugh at the prices. They're so reasonable.
And now in plantation out by me right behind Walgreens, I'm a corner of Nabil and Sunrise. Believe
you me, we needed a good restaurant out there. And now we got one. The pizza loft were the same
great food and the same great deals for take up delivery and catering in plantation called 9 5 4
3 8 2 1999 3 8 2 1999. And if you realize, maybe Jeff will let you take a shower with them in the back.
I bet the local this is 560. The rate is all yours.
You win.
I got you in the mail today. The package was round and plain.
But you're looking better me. When I said good to see. I found that you right there.
Looking like the news. I was feeling like a job. I couldn't find the bomb. I said.
My pop you. I.
Yeah
Might be days.
I was
Of first time.
I like it too, the face, so I was
Pulling you up first, some love
His palsy lips made of plastic
She's floating towards the face
I'm still here
I'm even with my girl, but soon
Pulling you up first, some love
She was also nice, opposition device
I love to feel her, so I was
Pulling you up first, some love
Dedicated that to the beast, I guess, huh?
Let me 47, there, that be a lot cheaper and a lot less aggravating to go through all of this crap that we're doing with this big promotion
Because it's not gonna work, nothing's gonna happen, it'll be just humiliating and degrading
As opposed to just, we all chip in and buy them a really nifty of low-up doll, what do you say?
If we all chip in, we can actually get them up for real hookah
You think?
Yeah
Like a blind one
Who's also lost their sense of smell?
Now, beast isn't the one that smells
Oh, Dan from IMEBIT says different pulls like you mentioned are a good idea
That's right, we should've liked narrowed this down, we could have milked this for months
That actors, actresses, and musicians, dead guitar player singers, we're gonna get a lot of mileage, you're right Dan, I'm dumb
Stevie Ray was great, but he was heavily influenced by Jimmy Hendrix, he says
Yeah
Also a Sunday
Okay, everybody sit down again
You know what I love at Pompadot Park when he started paying the national anthem, you know?
Yeah, I thought we were for the races
And the old people, old, I mean, the really, really, really, really old people, the grandparents of the people of the age of 100
They're still sitting there because their death is bad, right?
And they're like, look around, and the thing is like 90% overwood, and finally someone was like
Ah, and they'll crick and get up, you know, very amusing
Anyway, he was heavily influenced by Jimmy Hendrix, so Stevie Ray, he's not too keen on
Also, as I knew Morris get pretty well with Sen by his untimely passing
But John Lennon gets my vote, says Dan from my movies
Thank you, Dan, you're a man, Dan
5,6,7,0,5,60, Pomp, 5,60 on the AT&T line
Now did I see we have another lady on there, almost died when I saw that, a lady in Miami, hello
Hello, Neil
Yes, ma'am
Hi there, I just wanted to let you know on your recommendation I just finished farewell to God
And?
And I'm reading, Dineded by the right, excellent recommendation
Outstanding, good choices
And my choice is for Bob Mollie
Okay, we got him
I have a question for you, why is it okay to play President Dump Schmitts
And it's okay to play Connelly-Saw, what's the difference?
Because he's white
Oh, that's right, I forgot about that
Right, just say one thing to yourself over and over again, Miriam Olofant
That's right
5,6,7,1, you know what I mean, I don't want to get into a big thing, the audience is, they know what it's all about
Of course there was a big story there but Tom Jikamist that one too
Just like he misses everything else that's going on because he no longer has this finger on the pulse of the community
Which is why he's had like 800 more shows on network TV crap
Over and over and that's all he writes about
You're not fooling anybody, Tommy
Boy, if ever, if ever anybody was emblematic, symptomatic, just a perfect example of what that sounds all about
What it could be and what it is, the difference, it's him, little boldly
One thing I always loved about my close personal friend Tom Jikam
Now actually it's two things, you know what they are? What's that?
It's five, stupid!
But other than that, 5,6,7,0,5,60, pound, 5,60
And you know something little Tommy, I'm going to tell you right now
See, I'd rather be sitting here killing four hours taking a pool
Which is a little bit of fun, even though these are all dead people
Kind of in a morbid way, it's a little bit of fun
Killing some time, getting people's minds off all this other stuff
You know what I'm saying? About how the market watches in the crapper
Which it is, the bow is down 89 points
And the nice next down 10 and a half
And about that we're going to war any day now
And arguing the same crap back and forth and forth
I mean what's the point? You don't want to say it?
No, what do you say?
It's depressing
Let's do something like a little bit more uplifting
Like talking about dead people
Huh? Yeah, uplifting like this
Kill some people
So he was with the new Christie Minstrel's
And he was a green beret in order to have a red thing on his head
Tell me you're lower than the lower again
My breath, over my end, over the end
And we're all that we know, distanced yet
I'm dying out of here
So last night American University, they had a debate
Which has saw about three minutes ago
Yeah, Crossfire, one of those contrived debates
And they had Senator Rich and Tormo, Pennsylvania
And Diane Feinstein from California, who's totally sold out
And I don't know why they would call it a debate
Because they were both pretty much saying the same damn thing
And of course they were the college students
Where is American University?
Diate
Where is that? America?
No, seriously, where is American University?
Don't know from universities
Well put it on there, Carlos, but do a search
You're doing a good place right now, way out of here
Because the students there
And Washington DC, well isn't that sad, huh?
They were like really gung-hole, let's go get them
You know, like you're doing the Arsenio with a hand
And they let you know, let's rule, like crap
Okay, whatever you say, in fact you guys, they all look like they were healthy young people
Let's send them over there, what you say?
There's also American University of Peru
Perfect place for them, perfect place
Here's a call from Miami, hello
Yeah, how you doing Neil? First time all
Let's see
A couple things
A guy that influenced me was Arthur Ash
I don't know if you made your list or not
Not yet
Yeah, and also you have a list of celebrities that get ready to die, how about Charlton Heston?
We can only hope
Have a great day, pal
Yes?
Yeah, have a great day
Thanks
And I didn't really mean that about Chuck Heston, my good personal buddy
You're the son of a bitch, huh? I meant it
You son of a bitch
Holy Moses, it's Chuck Heston, he'll be dead
Of course he won't remember
566-10560, what a miserable nasty rotten
You know, what's that line about the cold steel in the hands?
What's that line that you use? The NRA nuts?
They'll have to pry my gun away from my cold dead fingers, something like that
Yeah, well you know something probably get a 90's share if we could televised it
Here's a call from West Palm Beach, hello
Hello, Neil
Yes sir
So it was one I wanted to get in, how about Walter Payton?
Did he really die?
Yeah, he's gone
How long ago did he die?
I don't know about two years ago, he's delivered
No, that's right, I forgot all about that, they just kind of zipped on by it, right?
How about the animal that had a die for Moses Wigg?
Yeah, that's true
Okay, thanks pal
He had a muskrat, the dead muskrat
Walter Payton, somebody else mentioned that, let's get him on here, what do you say?
Sure
Not Sandy Payton, Walter Payton
John Lennon's in it all alone by himself
I'd sure like to hear from somebody before the show ends today about this Dale Earnhardt thing
I mean I'm glad that the guy called it right off the get-go
And we'll explain to me that we would get a lot of these votes in about all the red necks with their pickup trucks
It probably doesn't register as you're driving down the road
When you see that three on there, it probably doesn't like when I see sports stuff
When I'm driving down the road, where?
Down here when you're here
Yeah, because ever since he died, they're everywhere
You just probably don't notice in the little corner of the windshield
I try to avoid reading all the propaganda in the back of people's cars
Sometimes I know it's a revolutionary concept, but my car is I have for transportation purposes
Not to spew propaganda, not to convert anybody, not to politicize, not to proselytize, not to circumcise
I just like to have the car to like get from point A to point B
I know that's very, very radical
Yeah
My son is an honor student, you have a big deal, you're probably an asshole
You know, I see those and usually the people with those bumpers stick is on a drive like crap
Right?
Like maybe the kids got all the brains that skip the generation, you know
Not impressed
And the same thing with all these religious ones and the fish and all that
I mean, save it already
It goes to show you how intolerant they are
They don't have even the common courtesy
Just to leave you alone out there in public when they have you as a captive audience on the highway
Just leave me alone already
That's one step away from the assholes that come knock it on your door to try to proselytize
You know, the Jehovah's Witnesses and Immormons and all that crowd
Right?
So I want to step away from it
I'm not out there driving around to get religious inspiration here
The only religious thing I want to see on a billboard somewhere is
Too good
That's it
You know, the one that says QAM, we used to have balls
I'll tell you a place where they got big balls because they're still in business in North Bay village
And that's Flores
Not too many people still around over there, but Flores has lasted through all of the chaos, through all of the decades, forever
How much your Flores have been here for about four or five hundred years, you know what?
I wouldn't be surprised to punch that thing on stuff there for a slice
That's right, freshly made everything at Flores, you'll taste the difference
Nothing prefabricated, nothing out of a can
First they made pizza dough, fresh baked garlic rolls, they bake them right through a bidet on the spot
And the portions are gigantic, they use more cheese and meats on their pies than anybody else in town
So if you're in Dade County, you want delicious Italian food, this is the place
A South Florida institution, and you'll find Flores at 731 North E 79th Street
That's just a block and half off this game, Boulevard, or column at 305 758 553 51
758 553 51, and Flores delivers, too, the liver from 34th in Biscayne, all the way to 135th in Biscayne
They'll go to Quaside, Cricket Club, the Jockey Club, they deliver as far west as 12th Avenue in east to Collins and 71st Street
Give them a call, if you're nice to little duty, she'll give you all the details about the great pizza specials
You pay only 1399 for large cheese, pylate, risotta, and six delicious chicken wings, all of these things
Call Flores and tell them that crusty old nails, I gotta record because it's a pizza joint
Crusty old nail, 402, call 305 758 53 51
305 758 53 51
Slight in the wall
We're sports radio 560, you AM
Oh, this is Pope John Paul Lind, and if he asks me, they only say more fun than playing grab ass with a Swiss guide
Is the Neil Rogers 12 to 1 hour?
Oh
Oh
In a place that feels just like the band-aid at the zoo
If you jump back dressed and drive the dream, then we need to live
If you wanna bring the surf for band-aid, then we need to teach all you gotta do is just ask the owner
Who writes a slash with sand into Palabin Mountain?
Grrr
Hays girls, but don't wear pants, then to Palabin Mountain
I'll tell a band-aid, and we'll take your back, gotta smelly but grab, filled with salt
I love those nails too, or wonder who could know that I the answer, and there's my heart deep right there
I praise my name, I appreciate a lot by the way, so when I call you I re
Have you seen anyOkayEz ved мед, rah plen, r сто as
As a bug grab built it send it to Palabin Mountain
And use a BUNG, all that زob d bann in the ghinostown
Who's home defining no?
Oh
Breaking
but I'm sorry.
Wasn't it awful how the way they repressed their women and a man and they would
let them listen to music and stuff like that? That was nasty. Yeah.
All we didn't mind them that much because we were going to build that pipeline. But anyway,
that's why when I watch these debates, it's just it's infuriating because
all these people are so brainwashed, they all just repeat it.
Like they're at a religious service, you know how they repeat the lines from the
Bible because it's the same people.
And it's the same as those repeating, no, all of them now they say the same crap.
He gassed his own people and he invaded another country.
He invaded the other country like 12 years ago when he gassed his own people 20 years
ago, but a gas that we gave them and we stood by their insurcus hand, Rumsfeld.
It said nice job there, Shmata.
It hurts his own people by the way.
Just ask them.
Well, they were close by.
There was neighbors.
You ought to know about gas in your neighbors.
Anyway, here's the fact that it says from our Haitian brother, what about Abbey of
Dear Abbey?
What about Dear Abbey?
Right?
Abigail Van Buren or whatever it was?
No.
It says by the way, the muffled kind of Lisa song was absolutely hysterical.
I almost cracked my pants.
Thank you Haitian brother.
Dear Abbey, what you put on there?
What do you say?
Huh?
Whatever.
You think?
No.
I can't believe I forgot that Walter Peyton died.
I'm embarrassed about that.
That's a bad sign.
It's not a good sign.
Who?
Walter Peyton, okay.
Great Chicago Bears running back.
Number 34, Walter Peyton.
Oh, yeah.
No.
Get with it, Mr. Sports.
I'll tell you one thing.
Clarence ever finds out that you're as much anti-sports as you are.
You're going to be on real thin ice.
Even Tim Horton never skated on ice that thin.
He already put it on.
He already put it on there.
What about Bill Borrelco?
Who?
Yeah, that's right.
What about Terry Sajuk?
What about Jacques Plant?
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60 on a AT&T.
Police got all in Nolan.
All right.
Now we need some defenseman, like about four or five.
Here's a call from Lake Worth.
Hello?
Lake Worth.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Great.
What about Harry Chapin?
That was given a free concert up in New York and he died in a car accident that same day.
Yeah?
Well, it affected me.
My friend.
Did he die in a taxi?
No, I think he was driving.
I think he had a pretty bad driver record, too.
Oh, well, thank you for that.
That would have been bad if he would have died in a taxi.
Yeah.
OK, thanks a lot, pal.
Oh, Harry Chapin, what do you say?
No.
It's an perpetrator.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, Charlie Chaplin, maybe, but Harry Chapin, no.
What celebrity death during your lifetime had the greatest impact on you?
Carol O'Connor, Elvis.
You know, the Elvis, then we could take a whole pool on that one day.
Yeah.
Seriously, although this audience, we'd better not do that because the audience generally
don't give a crap about Elvis.
And it threw in Harry's fourth, 37.
Aren't you surprised?
Yes, actually.
He just barely had a little Kurt Cobain.
John Lynn and 125, they'll earn hard 44.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I know.
Don't know or ask me.
See, what makes him so different from, like, Mario and Dready and AJ Foyte and all those
other guys?
Why is he so special?
He died?
Well, after some other dead drivers, in fact, there have been plenty of mood died like
in a crash.
Yeah.
Right?
But they're not as important because they didn't win as much.
Is that what it is?
That's what it is.
Plus me.
I don't think so.
I think maybe they had a blow-up doll.
John Lynn and 125, they'll earn hard 44.
Phil Harman 39, Elvis 37, Kurt Cobain 32, John Belushi 29.
Well, he's been dead a long time now, you know?
During our CIA 18, John Candy 16, Payne Stewart 16, Princess Die 13, poor Mr. Fred Rogers,
12 and Chris Farley, 12, everybody else in the digital world, including George Harrison.
You see George Harrison?
Not doing as well as I thought he would.
He's only got...
Yeah.
For George.
Well, you know, you can't pick all the Beatles, you know?
No.
Not yet, anyway.
I mean, like, when Ringo died, in fact, that would be a good one.
Who would you like to exchange?
The Beatles Exchange student program?
Yeah, like the dead people exchange program, you know?
Like, Sonny and Cher, maybe they're people like, say, oh, let's bring Sonny back and
the Cherish student.
Well, that's bad.
That's terrible.
But anyway, the Elvis thing, if we had any interest to which we don't, you could take
a whole poll on that.
Sure.
On people that still think he's alive.
People that think that he died squatting at stool.
What's that expression they use?
Straining at stool.
I think you're pardoned.
Oh, is that the medical type of term?
Yeah, straining at stool.
Like, if you look up hemorrhoids, do a stretch on hemorrhoids, and they'll say, one
of the causes of hemorrhoids is straining at stool.
Not straining in school.
Not straining in school.
Oh, straining at stool.
Which is a very interesting play on words.
And then those people think that he died from the drugs.
See, when you take a lot of drugs, one thing about prescription drugs is they tend to
make you, now, in some cases, some of them as a side effect, they like diarrhea.
But the other side effect is really bad constipation.
They plug you up like a drum.
Maybe that was it, you think?
Maybe.
Maybe he was straining it.
Maybe his heart was bad because of the fat.
Because it was oil clogged.
Yeah, and he had a fart attack.
Because it was surrounded by pounds and pounds and pounds of oozing nasty fat.
And there was peanut butter.
That was oil clogging his heart and his liver, and all his other vital organ.
Not to mention the booze and pills.
Right.
That was just the frosting on a cake, I guess.
I'm telling you what I do like, though, with whipped cream on it is curate cake.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T and fries in line.
Here's Hylia.
Hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
This is Richard.
I'm actually from Jacksonville.
And when I come down here, I come down to Gulfstream for a couple of races over here
and there.
And speaking of the number three, if you travel through Jacksonville, it's on 90% of
the cars there.
Oh, my God.
Truck's cars, everything you name it is there.
Oh, my God.
It's everywhere.
And so as a matter of fact, in all my exotics and my gimmicks, I have to use the number
three because it's embedded in my mind.
Anyway, back to the celebrity that I've dealt that really affected me.
The great governor of Alabama, George Wallace, that kind of bothered me.
Why was that?
Well, I don't know.
I was a little guy when that happened and he kind of scared me and all that.
And think about George Wallace.
Well, what did he mean?
He was a little bit ill.
He got shot.
What is it?
He might even have been a distant relative of Dale Earnhardt.
Yeah, that's true.
I could have all been from the same clan.
Okay, thank you very much.
I should go back to Jacksonville soon, please.
No, we're not putting him on there.
Oh, he did the toward the end there.
He started liking him dark folks a lot.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Tonight, 6th, 8th, Joe and Mark will be out at Pro Player Stadium for the Maroonie Auto
Tenseil.
Stop by to spin the prize wheel for tickets to see the heat, the canes and the four championships
had to do well.
Somebody's got to kind of embarrassing for broadcasting there all week.
Let's see.
Dear Abby is not dead or sister Ann Landers is.
Now, that is not correct.
I don't know.
Abigail Van Buren died, didn't she?
I don't know.
Look at that, Carlson.
He said she died.
He says, Phil and Carl Springs, I think you're a wrong film, but we'll check it out.
You could be right.
I don't know.
One of them died.
What about Doodles Weaver?
Who now is Doodles Weaver?
He has to probably get that buffet book, your pal Bill.
He still wants to get the book out.
How do we attack the buffet?
You can look at Bill.
Okay, Bill.
Do you want to get the book out?
Do you want to get the book out?
I have no idea what he's talking about, nor do I want to know.
56670884.
Did I lie to you?
Who's that?
Dear Abby.
Told you.
Well, no, wasn't that just a shirt?
I think you're wrong.
What about her sister?
No, Ann Landers did die.
That was her sister.
Right.
But I thought Dear Abby also died here, just, huh?
No.
No, just one of them.
No.
Like you're wrong, but just confirm it.
Hey, the internet wouldn't lie.
Maybe she's like South Florida.
Maybe she died and she's still walking around because nobody's totally dead.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
Hollywood.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Neil Howard.

He sure was great.
Phil Harbin, thirty-nine.
And his humor was fine.
Dale Earnhardt, forty-four.

I don't get the Dale Earnhardt.
I don't care.
I mean, I keep hearing it and I'm sure I believe it, but why?
Why?
What is it all about?
What is the big simmiss?
Why?
With some race car guy, huh?
I mean, they beruth anybody say him?
Joe D'Amaggio, Jolton Joe.
Mickey Mandel with that stolen liver?
No.
I mean, no.
So we're going to put sports people on there.
Thank God at least Bobby Clemente got on there.
Got a few votes.
But Dale, frickin' Earnhardt and Painstored.
You're right.
There's like a, there's like a, there's like a disease on his station.
Remember John D'Amaggio?
And, Nicky, remember, you're in a, well, I mean, the show is being broadcast in a redneck state in the south

I heard somewhere we're going to have some of Flam filled fun and a paradise today.
I know Hank Oldboy and Gennaya don't have differences in the past.
But it's been brought to my attention that the Hank has arranged for some beautiful women to join us in a plushly-affirtered studio.
Yeah, it's out of glamour queens from Key West.
By the way, something.
Yeah.
It hasn't escaped me.
That's around me with women.
Is a good way of keeping me from getting raped.
Yeah.
This hair is a big joy, humidity, and respect from Hank.
Bigger than his pants.
They're coming in now.
What the fuck?
Put your teeth back here.
Oh my god.
It is.
It is.
You may get around to me.
Hey.
Get a little bit of voices.
There must be heavy smokers.
Hey, hey.
So, what do you know?
What do you say?
There, ladies.
Oh, we're fine.
I won't grill in the back there.
A bit stuff that goes you think.
Yeah.
They're a wait a minute, something.
Ain't you a guy of Perry Mason?
Oh, it's you, Mo.
Oh, you can't be Perry Mason.
You're dead.
Perhaps, but I'm still in better shape than you.
I didn't know.
You got some knife walking in here, just like that.
Would you mind sharing with the court exactly why we were asked here today?
What?
Certainly.
It's an offering of peace from Hank Goldboyke.
And the hell of God.
Wasn't it you, Mo, who called the Key West Queen's Agency and said, help me.
My show is dying.
No, it's not true.
And wasn't it you, Mo, who said, rapes not money?
Okay, okay.
Yes, it was me.
It was me.
I said, rapes not money.
I submit your honor that Mo submits.
Wait a minute.
I so rule.
What's the meaning of that?
My girls, let's make him out of it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Go.
You.
You.
You.
I said, rapes not money.
Yeah.
And is there any desperate brought out there that's like, can we bribe you, can we blackmail you, can like at least take a look at it.
I thought that was exactly what they're saying.
See if you can find it.
Here's a call from Margate. Hello.
Hey, Marg. Hey, how are you?
Yes, sir.
Oh, sorry.
Hey, how are you? Great job.
George Sucks. By the way, how about Jim Henson from the Muppet?
Jim Henson. That like set you back a little bit?
Well, I mean, you know, I hear a lot to do with you. I mean, everybody watch Sesame Street when Eric Gays and I watch the Muppet in the
other reason. When he passed away, it was kind of like another good, the Muppet kind of died and it was kind of, you know, kind of freaky.
I have always heard the voice of the Prog change, which really confused me.
Okay.
All right. Cool. Thanks.
Well, you got him, man. Thank you.
Why do you hate that guy?
Oh, because he hates me.
Oh, maybe he was just kidding, but that was a very good choice.
Jim Henson, he's got it.
And what about Captain Kangaroo? Isn't he dead?
I don't know.
What that was his name?
Bob Keeshin.
Very good.
Isn't that his name?
Right?
Mr. Greenchains is dead.
How about Keeshan?
That's right. He's alive.
Speaking of sports, Rick from Tampa says in reference to Dale Hurnard being so popular here in Tampa.
Oh, yeah. I can only imagine.
They have life-sized pictures of him on the Coke machines all over the place.
The number three stickers, especially the ones with angel wings on them, are very popular here as well.
I'm heading for the border as we speak, so this is Rick from Tampa.
And I think what he really wanted to say is a PS and a bottom of it was.
Damn, Tampa.
Yeah.
I don't get it.
I mean, I realized that I made travel in very limited circles, but Dale Hurnard.
Number three.
If I can quote-
That's a, huh?
If I can quote Joe Castello.
Yeah.
Motor sports is the most widely watched sport in the world.
500,000 people show up to watch a-
Yeah.
Who cares?
Well, like I said, I was quoting Joe.
Who cares?
He must have been kidnapped as a very young child.
They must have tied him to a cheer and forth and watched those cars go round.
And like that-
Hey, and Joe's defense, he's an actual participant, not some spectator.
I see.
That's like saying, in Joe's defense, he actually plays golf, right?
Here's a lady in Pompato. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
First time call of very nervous.
Excellent.
But I think I get a good name.
Sam Caneson.
He's on there.
Oh, he is.
Or at least he's supposed to be on there.
Now, let me take a look and see if he made it on the look.
Because I've got him written down.
But you know these guys here, especially-
He's there.
He's got four.
He's got four votes.
I would have put my vote for him.
Okay, thanks.
Okay.
Bye.
See you.
He's on there.
Got four votes.
Not doing all that great, Sam.
Caneson out of sight out of mind.
He'd been did a long time.
He had a haircut, Sam.
I think he used to use the same barber that Greg read uses.
5,670560, Pomp 560 on the AT&T line.
What's the liberty death during your lifetime?
Had the greatest impact on you.
I'd say Brandon DeWilda made me cry.
I didn't realize it at the time.
And now that I look back on it and think of all the entertainment that we missed,
we must be missing a lot of really great Hollywood people too.
You know, like Belolagosi,
Boris Karla, Vincent Price.
Right?
Vincent Price was great.
And he didn't die all that long ago.
No.
Right?
Right.
Even Punks, though, who Vincent Price is, I would think if they ever watched any horror movies.
You think we ought to put him on there?
No.
Why not?
Just because old.
Okay.
I'm easy.
5,750560, Pomp 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Lines.

How about the Red of Swift?
She's still alive.
Richard Dawson?
Oh, guess what?
What?
Oh my god.
Now you see how you put all these things together?
There you go.
Stop.
Night night.
G-Maver is night night.
How about G-Maver?
I'm not putting them on there, but he deserves a mention.
There you go.
Anyone who else deserves a mention?
Speaking of quiz shows?
Ray Cones.
Ray Cones, yeah?
That's true.
Who are you going to say?
Johnny Olson.
Right.
Johnny Olson, who was the announcer, the booth announcer,
had about 6,000 different and speaking of quiz shows,
what about Bill Cullen, huh?
What about him?
What about him?
This audience don't know Bill Cullen from Matt Cullen,
the place for the Panthers.
Who?
You don't like Bill Cullen?
What game?
He was on a million shows.
He was on the original prices right.
He was on...
Oh, that guy, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bill Cullen with a wooden leg or whatever it only had.
He had a peg leg.
He was great.
Everybody liked Bill Cullen.
And then you're going to be knocking Arlene Francis
now that we found out that she was it.
I put that on her, so Boca Brian will have one to vote for.
Be Arlene Francis, but I'm not going to do it.
I left this little for Johnny Olson.
I don't put Johnny Olson on her.
How about Rod Roddy in those suits?
You know where he gets those suits, don't you?
26 past noon at 5.60 WDQM if you're still reluctant about ordering a bet over the phone,
don't be hesitant, okay, because a lot of us be doing it.
Over a million people of bottomatris right over the phone from Dalai Mattris,
and hundreds more smart people are doing it every week.
We've been talking about Dalai Mattris all the time on this show for years now,
and nothing's got a bigger impact on the way you feel every day than a great night's sleep.
If you want to start sleeping good,
get you a great name brand.
Matt Pres is an unbeatable price from Dalai Mattris.
The only smart way to do it.
Just call 1-800-MATTRES.
They got C. Lee, Certa Simmons, King Quill,
every size and style under the sun.
They ranked number one in customer satisfaction.
They got more repeat and referral customers than anybody else,
because they will treat you right and you'll come back again in a game.
Once you buy a mattress from Dalai Mattris,
you never go back to buy it the old-fashioned way and assure them again.
And don't forget, when you buy your mattress from Dalai Mattris,
very important, they take away the crappy old vetting and set up your brand new one for you for free.
That's right, Dalai Mattris takes away the smelly, crappy soil-stayed,
nasty old vetting and sets up the brand new one for you for free.
So make the call now.
They'll be knocking on the door in no time at all when you want them to be there.
1-800-MATTRES,
and tell them that Fatal of Neil and even bigger Fatboy told you to call.
My, and local,
we're sports radio five-sixys, you and you AM.
Oh God, Neil.
Great job.
A piper comes a cheap and crappy claim that flows
A gunning death my head's about to be only way out of the blue
Now heads the only ones that slept alive today
From what they called a Kennedy curse
If Dorothy Kill Gowdy was alive she'd say
Here up it's only gonna get worse
It's a view that sounds like a gun gun fall in play
Fudder, splatter, splatter, splatter, cool
It's a view that sounds like a gun gun fall in play
Fudder, splatter, splatter, splatter
And you talk about really bad taste, George
Yeah, 1232 and 560 WQIN
Well we probably pissed a few people off with that
We're supposed to be more sensitive about JFK, Jr.
Get the honey, Jr.
We'll send them a shovel so they can go dig them up and suck his ass
He's got nine votes
Yeah, he's tied with John Wayne, he's tied with a Duke, how do you like that?
I always think of them together, you know what?
I better buy nine shovels
I always think of them like side by each
56670560, you know I just looked on a website, on a QM website, and saw the picture of the beast
Yeah, have you looked at it?
No, I don't need to, I've...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's considering it's a fairly flattering picture of the beast now
I do want to say this with all due respect
that if any young ladies are sucked into this thing so to speak, they actually do wind up showing up on the 26th of this month
and wind up with this, however they're going to do it
They'll never come to that because when they walk it and they see him there
They're going to have to have a cheer with his name on it
You see what I'm saying?
Maybe you know what I'm saying and that is that if they walked in and they looked like anything even human
and they saw him sitting there, they'd run out screaming like a banshee like they'd just seen a ghost
You know what I'm saying?
Who said they're looking for humans?
Oh
I think it's a recipe for disaster
In fact, when you go online to show what our management spends a lot of their time doing
and you'll see the rules for this content, there's like 75,000 different rules on there
One of the little things in tiny print is if any of our ladies that you actually get to see it
please take a picture because you'll probably never find it again
They should have one rule show up

Hey Greg. You call that a penis?
From 58 at 560 W.C.A.M.
So there's somebody who's just astonished here.
Do you see this from this attorney in Fort Lauderdale?
Yeah. Yeah.
That we can't play the original condolences.
Well let me just say this to you, sir.
It's a Goyshevelte. That's all I can tell you.
Sure, blame us.
We have a lot of right way.
Uh-huh?
No, he's not blaming us.
No, you are.
Oh yeah, you.
Yeah, you.
You.
But anyway, it's just one of those things.
We got a bunch of right wingers.
We live in a fascist guy.
I mean, people are getting like intercepted
in shopping malls now because they're
wearing protest t-shirts.
We're talking about adults.
It's not bad enough that kids are getting sent home from school
because they're wearing t-shirts to have an opinion.
Give piece a chance.
Yeah, give piece a chance.
Give piece a freaking chance.
The Beatles, John Lennon and George Harrison
are turning over their freaking graves.
How the hell are you?
Exactly.
It's enough to make you just
crap your brains out to think what's going on now.
The chilling of speech.
And then of course, when you see that Michael Powell
is chairman of the FCC,
although the kind of things that got nothing new with the FCC,
ask Greg Wheat.
He'll tell you.
We don't discuss it.
We just roll over and play dead,
but we don't discuss these things.
So that's America for you today.
Anyway, we asked our speaker.
We're only over and playing dead.
What celebrity death during your lifetime
had the greatest impact on you?
Carol O'Connor, Elvis,
John Lennon, well, we got a great list here.
How's it going so far?
I don't have time to read them all.
Because we're, see,
unlike certain other shows,
which I don't want to mention,
no, no, no names,
moaning shows.
But I got the digital clock,
the time right there in front of me on City Post 24.
And so I do that so that I have an idea
when it's time for us to get out here,
when I time is up,
when a mad dog is standing by it derailed,
so he comes on on time
and then hang in the rest of the stuff.
You know what I'm saying?
So what time is it?
1259.35.
I see.
Okay. John London 145.
They learned hard 49.
Elvis 42.
Philharve and 41.
John Baluchia 30.
Oh, and what a long and passion thing about auto-wracing.
Did you read this?
No.
Oh my god.
All I can say is,
whatever you like.
Bye, bye, bye.
The intellectual leisure show
