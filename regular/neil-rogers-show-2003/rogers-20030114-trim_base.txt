That these are your props, so beautiful.
I'm so glad for the fact that I got
a
And I'm embarrassed to be an American
Where we take triadically
Way the flag it would have
With our head in the sand
And blindly follow the powers that
Beep, have a sad tick
Pfft!
Up, washing state brand new
Is on a 65 inch screen
Scratch your balls and pie
Everything's okay
In the goddamn USA
God bless America
You'll come back now you hear
916-560-WQA
I'm a section of Tampa International Airport
Was evacuated yesterday
After the airport baggage screening system
Detected a mouse trap and a piece of luggage
A mouse trap
Oh my god
The airport's ticketing area was evacuated
For about 45 minutes but the Tampa police
Bomb Squad found no explosives in the bag
It did retrieve a mouse trap from inside a coffee can
Said Chris Radigan, a spokesman for the
TWAA, T Transportation Security Administration
When you look at the monitor it had all these wires
And looked very, very suspicious she said
Airport spokeswoman Brenda Gegehagen
Said the bag's owner was talking with the police airport
And TSA officials the owner was not in charge
She said she said a few planes from five airlines had 20 to 30 minute delays
But didn't have an exact number
Mouse trap
First of all why would you carry a mouse trap in your luggage
Maybe you need it where you're going
See Christine Aguilar
Huh what's wrong with that
Got to carry a build a better mouse trap
So we've also had some more additions to our survey
Although I noticed like George says nobody's on a phone now
Because they all ate me and people called in shouting names out
That's not the way we do it on this show
We nice to have a little verbal intercourse with some of you
Have some ideas about some of these people as opposed to
Just calling up like a hit and run artist
Like what was the one that I didn't put that mother?
Several I'm not putting down the ones I am putting down
Buddy Holly Frank Sinatra Freddie Mercury
Another queen
Jerry Garcia and Rick Nelson
How could we have forgotten Rick Nelson? Love Rick Nelson
Love Hosea and Harriet they're both dead
Boy a lot of dead people you know man
And more every day
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 8 8 and 10
And Verizon one of the slots are really great news
It's Tuesday it's the 14th of January which means
Smallville the night new episode
Now is it really a two hour special thing or was it
Did somebody just make that up?
Oh no I don't know I'll check
Well let's check that out
When it out let's check it out come on
A two hour special smallville man can you imagine
Get out the extra big box of Kleenex
Man oh man
So Michael Mayo steals a column right out of the show yesterday
Wow in today's this unsentinel
It's on our website by the way or will be momentarily as soon as Carlos gets through a showering and douching in there
Now going to take a leak at about 8 25 this morning in the ati room
And there's Carlos in there in the sink
This whole body is in the sink he's got the water running full blast
He's showering in the sink shaving and douching at the same time
Kind of like an all in one deal
I mean maybe they can develop a deal like that where you like it like a chamber
Like a gigantic toilet like thing and what you do is you just get in it and the water like it does everything
Like a shower brush your teeth you shower take a dump and
Douch all at the same time
I think it's an invitation station wow
This is wqa your sanitation station oh
We're trying to clean up our act aren't we no no
So Michael Mayo writes
Don't tell me their faxes coming in on this stuff because you ought to see some of the names coming in like frank zappa
Frank zappa was not oh get out of here
Frank zappa wasn't a recording artist like in the sense of recording artist he was a
Comedian he'll do well
Oh no virgin Mary seen on picture window in Canada
Oi hey do you see this? I didn't see that
I think that it's an omen man. I think that the second coming is coming. Oh, let's get rid of that call from highly okay
Hi, Alia. Hello. Hey
Yeah, okay Jim Krochi did time in a bottle too
And Karen Carpenter I think is one that you go. Oh Karen Carpenter excellent choice. Love you. Thank you
I told him to be good call from highly they're always great
Karen Carpenter Eric. I'm sorry about this, but we did you know just a
We're not sorry. He missed a whole bunch of names anyway, so we'll just uh
I'm gonna call him during the break. You're gonna one. I will call him during the break
To catch him up. What do you mean? He was all taking a dump or something
That's a good job. I can't imagine Eric doing something discussing like that
I can imagine Carlos doing that with the virgin Mary stories on the site
Okay, we're just just relax a little bit. Okay, just take it easy
Slow down a little bit. We got four long excruciating hours to butcher here today
So just just take it easy
This is an exactly like yesterday show where we can fill in with all that music although
Although an appropriate thing to do it certainly would be appropriate to remember give us some memories all
I don't have any music here like all my doors stuff is up in Toronto. Do we have any doors music here now
Mike back there back in it, huh?
We might have some uh
Like I got compilation discs greatest hits of this and that we might have some of them
I'm talking about playing the doors for four hours today although
I mean who we got on their Elvis. We certainly have an Elvis. I saw one disk back there. It's somebody didn't steal yet
John Lennon, we got every Beatles song that was ever invented, I imagine.
George Harrison? Do we have any George Harrison? Oh yeah, we did. Back there.
Remember after he died we had that thing back. Of course I'm not assuming that
they're all still here. Roy Orbison, must play Roy Orbison today for hours.
Jim Morrison, like I said, Jimmy Hendrix, we don't have no Jimmy Hendrix.
We got Purple Hayes. I don't know what I got.
I got Judy Garland. Judy Garland would be good. He did a lot of drugs.
He had a lot of BOOs. But he had never done any drugs that we know of.
But he had a lot of BOOs. He was kind of like clean cut, Yahoo, all American red
necky with him nasty glasses and he's dead. Jim Krochi, we don't have that here.
I got it home. Maybe tomorrow we'll do that. Sounds like a plan to make.
Frank Sinatra, we certainly don't have no Frank Sinatra music here. Sorry.
We got some Frank Sinatra operatives. What do you got there? Not Frank Sinatra.
So, Bing Crosby. Bing Crosby is even better. And he's also dead.
Let's put him on there. Just a joke. So here are the names that I added on there,
which you shouldn't have to Buddy Holly, Frank Sinatra, Freddie Mercury,
Jerry Garcia, Rick Nelson and Karen Carpenter. Please, Karen, maybe a little salad would be good.
Maybe the one that's Gloria would eat on all in the family.
The one that Archie keeps screaming. How about a little salad?
Come on, Gloria. Boy, she a pig or what? Sally Struthers.
Yeah, I used to like Sally Struthers when she was on that show. And as soon as that show went off here,
I turned a despiser. And that as soon as the show went off,
is also when she blimped up to balloon size or ballooned up to balloon size,
however you want to look at it. A cow. A lot of fat braids on TV, you know that?
Rosie O'Donnell, Roseanne, Oprah, Sally Struthers,
starred Jones on the view. Oh my God. She's not fat. She's in another category.
Fat. Have you seen her shoe commercials for Payloss?
Well, how she find her shoes? I guarantee she don't tie no shoes. You notice women don't tie shoes anyway.
Oh, you know what I've got to wear now? I went to my podiatrist yesterday.
They might have thanked her a lot when we were the best, baby.
Remember, even though the Panthers are just getting annihilated,
we can't pick on remember for that. He had planned all those pretty soon. They might sign them up.
But his doctors are the best. Went to my podiatrist yesterday. I've got a bone spur.
Heels spur? Not a big deal.
But I got a pilot. Saw it. I got a pilot off for the nail file.
But so you know, one of the many things he did. By the way, thanks again.
Doc, you're great. One of the many things that he recommended.
Shoes with high heels. He said he recommended boots.
I'm not going to be wearing no cowboy boots. Can you imagine me wearing cowboy boots?
Yeah, Carl said, oh, yeah, yeah.
But I'm thinking like maybe high heels like pumps are pumps, right?
Pumps would be good. See, I mean cowboy boots. It clashes with my image.
But I'm thinking more like well, you know, they have this school marm shoes.
They're nice and square toad. Oh, yeah.
What the heels on them? Maybe I can borrow some of those from my mouth.
I've got a size three foot. I've just squeezed them on. You know, just get the old shoehorn and shove it in there.
Sightings of images of the virgin Mary on windows and walls in the northern reaches of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan
have produced a minor tourism miracle for the remote villages involved.
Exactly. Exactly. My thoughts precisely.
Since September, mysterious images of Mary, mother of Christ,
have been reported in four villages, three of which are accessible only by airplane.
Well, you know, she, I don't need a plane to get where she's going, sparing hundreds of people to visit.
How do you like that? The virgin Mary in Saskatchewan, she finds the most bizarre places.
Jesus Christ! The latest images appeared yesterday on two homes in Bolville, Saskatchewan,
which has fewer than a thousand residents. See, she don't want to be like an in-time square.
She don't want to be like in some place. She wants to go into the, uh, boondocks, like in clear water on a side of that bank building.
The images appeared to glow at night and have been captured on video, said,
Bertha de Rocher, who owns one of the homes. No relation to Leo, I'm sure.
De Rocher said she didn't want to tell others about the image on her picture window at first.
I told my mom and she said, oh, you're probably seeing your own shadow,
so I thought people wouldn't believe me. De Rocher told Reuters. Since then, more than 300 people have come from hundreds of miles around to view her window.
It was just glowing so beautifully. I had tears in my eyes, De Rocher said, adding she believes the sightings are some kind of divine message.
Maybe they're from...
Oh, God!
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of the Keywiton Diocese, home to the four communities, was a way on retreat and unable to comment.
A spokesman at his office said that Ices has not received any official reports of the sightings.
Sightings of the images of Christ Mary and Saints are not uncommon around the world,
and it had been witnessed in media's diverses glass, water, a burrito, and a Camero muscle car.
Oh, yeah!
I would have thought he would have showed up in a Corvette.
By the way, mad dog, that was my Corvette. You were talking about it. It's not white, it's silver.
Did you know mad dog is colorblind?
No. He was asking me yesterday, who's the white Corvette?
That's a snappy car. I said, mine is silver. Well, there's a white one down there. There wasn't any white one. It was mine.
Huh? He's colorblind.
Everything he sees has got like either aqua and orange, or it's that Admissigan blue.
Everything?
Everything he be the color guy.
Possibly the most recent famous Canadian sighting was a Christ-like image on the brick wall of a Tim Horton's donut shop at Brasda Or on Canada's Atlanta coast of 1998.
Oh, man, I bet you he was there with Tim getting signatures for Doug McLean.
Or is it the other way around?
You think? Let's call up what's her name in Washington and find out what's almost her name, that hockey writer?
That broad? Rachel Alexander.
Very good. Oh my God. Let's hear it for George.
She had really large breasts.
Rachel Alexander, who had a gigantic pair of hooters, which is why George members are very vividly, but wouldn't know a hockey puck if you stuffed a whole bunch of men between her breasts.
Rachel Alexander, Bauwau Pikao-Kick.
Rachel, Bauwau Pikao-Kick.
And she got promoted.
And what do we got? We got Mike Russo and David J. Neill.
Of course she got promoted. Did I mention?
Big breasts.
Well, that seems to work a lot of places.
27 after 9 at 560 WQM Snow and Miami unbelievable Tom Limon and Joe Prieto are buried.
Not necessarily in snow, they buried in cars.
The fact that we have sent Hal at Pontiac so many cars, there's no place to park them.
Even Tom Limon had to park cars in his driveway and probably won't bring them back, so they need to place one in yours.
Hal at his blowing out all the new vehicles, regardless of profit, that's what they're saying now, when in doubt we're blown it out.
Including the Pontiac vibes starting at only $13,998 and up to 5 grand off on every GMC envoy in stock.
Plus get 0% financing or up to a $3,000 rebate.
Of course Hal at's also got as always a dependable selection of pre-owned cars, production SUVs.
If credit is a problem for you, if everybody in the town just laughs at you when you come on a lot, don't worry about that.
Just go to Hal at they won't laugh, they'll take your money, they'll cut you deal at Hal at Pontiac no matter how much of a deadbeat you are, even if you know Carlos.
It's a winter blizzard emergency clearance, Hal is going on right now at Hal at Pontiac GMC, 13401 Soptix, Ohio.
That's US1 across from the falls where they've been doing it right by people for over 35 years, they're open every day, seven days a week.
As always you'll save even more if you tell them you heard about this thing on the Near Rogers Show called the Near Rogers Neal Deal Hotline at Hal at right now at 203 at 1-88-534-421.
That's 1-88-534-421, where Hal at Pontiac GMC proudly says we be professional grade.
My, my and local, we're sports radio 560s, you ain't, you ain't, I ain't.
Hey there, people on Bobbibrow, the sea on the queue is boy and sound, my car is fast, my teeth is shining, I tell all the girls they can kiss my hiding.
Welcome here I am, I'm at a famous school, I'm present sharp and I'm acting cool, I got a cheerleader here once they help with my fate, but better do all the work and maybe later I'll bring the roll, God I am the American prince, I do not think out too extreme, I love my handsome son of a bitch, but I'm gonna get a good job and be real rich.
Women's Liberation, we've gained, we've been all across the nation, I'll tell you people, I was not rich, I caught this guy by the name of pressure, a lady, a little bitch then, all she tried to make you say when, she had a fault in a vice, but she left the bitch, I guess I'm still above, but I'm not.
Now it's just a bit, oh God I am the American prince, but now I smell like gasoline, and I'm a miserable son of a bitch, and by a lawyer a lady, I don't know who is.
I want the one, the one, the one, the one, so we'll win out and bought me a leisure suit, I jingle my chains, but I'm still kind of cute, got a job doing radio promo, and none of the jacks can even tell I'm a home dog, if they've slid me in a friend, sort of dripped it along, and say, yes and then, I can take about an hour on the tower, a hour, along as I guess,
a little bull, the chow, oh God I am the American dream, with a spindle, I've got till it makes me scream, and I'll do anything together again, I'll lay away nights and sing a thank you friend, oh God oh God I'm so fantastic, thanks to Freddie, I'm a sexual spastic, and my name is Bob and Brown,
what's me now, a fool down, and my name is Bob and Brown, what's me now, a fool down, and my name is Bob and Brown, what's me now, a fool down,
so here's a fact of Paul, who says, Frank Zappa with the most prolific songwriter composer in American music history, do you know that? I had no idea, well that's what Paul says, he has written composed over 400 original songs, he spoke out against bad government, campaign for prostate cancer research, he conducted voters registrations at all his concerts, and generally spoke his mind through music about the entire human condition, please add him to your list, thank you for your consideration, well I mean that's so polite, thank you for your consideration, how can we refuse, how can we refuse, and not only do we put him on the list,
but we also played Bobby Brown, he'd be going down, so the list is growing like crazy, now I knew it, let's see we've added Buddy Holly, Frank Sinatra, I'm just adding the ones that I had fast Eric, a lot of hope it's on there already, John Lennon's got 17, Frank Sinatra's got 17, Jimmy Hendrix 16, Elvis 10, see what I mean about Elvis everybody else in single digits, pulls up, but we're adding to it, it's not done yet, Freddie Mercury, get these Eric, Jerry Garcia,
Rick Nelson he won't do that well but he should, well he's got a lot of competition, not to slide it, here in Carpenter we could play some Carpenter's today what are you, no, thank you, and here's some other one Kurt Cobain, how can we have left them off here, Kurt Cobain, little insane, and a lot of pain, not no Mo, and Frank Zappa, we just put him on there, so there's the list it's expanding, even as I sit here I'm on a really, I was, I'm not sure if I can get in, I don't know if I can get in, I'm not sure if I can get in, I'm just, I just can't look at him, I shouldn't need to do this, I shouldn't need to do this, I'm not sure, I can't, I can't do this, I can't do this, I'm just about here, I can't do this, I can't do this, I can't do
my fat ass. So one out of a hundred here on this fact isn't too bad it says I can't
believe you left Kurt Cobain off list. Well he's on there now okay just calm down. What
about the what about the guy from Millie Vanille who killed himself? The guy from
recording artist not lip-sinkers recording artists. And then it says what about David Lee
Roth he may not be dead but his career is. That's cute. That's a whole other category.
Okay so like I said one out of five thousand ain't that bad. Did I finish my story about
the Virgin Mary on the picture window and says, guys I want to not sure I finished that. Yes I did.
Oh yeah the Tim Horton donut shop. I'm Canada's Atlanta coast of 1998. He sure gets around
at Virgin Mary and I might have to play that momentarily. Well Virgin Mary. And the best part
of the whole deal is that they actually assholes out there who believe this stuff. That's the most
frightening part of it okay. Oh my goodness it's the Virgin Mary on the side of our bank building.
It's the Virgin Mary on top of a Toteino's pizza. It's the Virgin Mary inside of a double burrito
supreme with extra beans from Taco Bell. How do you like that? I wonder and then today is the
14th we missed the yesterday. Is it only on Friday the 13th or the 13th of every month? We don't
hear about it no more so must be out of business. 13th of every month supposedly that
Rosa Lopez is house in Hollywood. She's got a date every 13th of every month. Lucky 13.
Lucky for Rosa although I guess not lucky anymore because she used to have all the whole block
blocked off with people parking there to come and watch wait for the Virgin Mary on the 13th of
each month that Rosa Lopez in Hollywood. But I guess she's small potatoes now. Now that Virgin Mary
is making the tour up there in Canada. Probably heard that I hang out there every now and then.
Probably looking for me right here Mary right over here bitch. Oh that was bad.
You can't call the Virgin Mary a bitch can you just did? I just did.
So Michael Mayo writes a column totally cold from this show playing hooky to remember a forgotten
voice about my cranberry. Better late than never Mike. It's about time he wrote something
not though it's still a pretty crappy column. Back to the sports page Mike you know tell
those people over there to sunset and they'll pull me back right below and I know a little bit
about sports not too much but certainly writing these kind of like human interests or whatever
this is I don't know what you call it. Anybody have any idea what we call this column that
Mike Mayo writes in the sunset every day. But anyway well I guess I better do the break first
then we'll get to that. It's not all that long it's Mike deserves it. Any points out who's actually
what I've been saying about how they only give him like a just a cursory acknowledgement to his death
and I guess he wasn't no more more as give which is what Mike Mayo points out and then what I just
said the other day yes. Nice going Neil thank you very much. The check better be in the male Mike
stealing columns off of the show he does mention me and Hank in there briefly that we were at IOD
that's the only coverage we get on the Uranus in the newsmeet anymore is the fact that you know
we used to be an IOD not that we're here now or anything to do with our shows now or anything
about our lives now or anything at all but just well they used to be at IOD back when they were good
back when we liked them now they're on QAM so automatically we despised them you know what I
think they started despising us I think back in about March of last year you know what happened

and he guys says well we're hoping you will because a lot of us out here don't like you even the
mad dog what's not to like okay just because he went to Michigan just because he's a Homer which

quality footwear there's a great store where they have the best selection in town they have the
best professional service people really know your feet inside and out even if they have to put

and paul McCartney who's still looking for uh hulio down by the schoolyard
he's right over here next door
no he is the schoolyard our hulio he's big enough to be the whole schoolyard
paul McCartney i don't know you put him in the same category with john lennon
George Harrison just because he was a beetle that's like saying that ringo star still
was roughly wrote a lot of their poppies
about rote recording artists were not saying no no no no no no chance
recording artists being together
oh no no no we're not we're not saying who the Beatles
we're not saying who is the best musician which would include writing and by the way guy
gross right now that he made many more records than john lennon after the Beatles
so alone in with wings oh and so many of them so bubble going to me oh
oh
yeah but live and let die don't bring up say say say well i'm
oh say say say say
what's that Michael Jackson inspired him to do that say say say yes
oh and if you're like the big badly Roy Brown wait until you hear
ah good golly miss mod i loved him croche he was one of my all-time favorites i used to play him on
a radio back in the good old days when i was a like you know a district
while he falls into it on the radio wspv and cirrhizaldis eight minutes still 10
and here's Jim croche and operator
i've a radio or could you help me place this here's Karen and the Ken Carpenter
who's Ken Carpenter i want to say dick again
if we're in the girls say dick to many things
living in LA with my fairs oh don't you give love to me
right
who that was right
probably Ray van jiric
never Ray van jiric sure that's an intellectual asshole
from the beginning of the way in fact i saw a piece on uh maybe it was on the biography channel
they were doing a gym Morrison thing and they had the thing about uh down here when he got he
never exposed himself here by the way he never actually whipped it out he threatened to
and the cops still busted him Jim Morrison because they heard that it was so big it would have
been like a runaway alligator or something but anyway so Ray van jiric is telling the whole story
what a sued he is remember we had that clip from him back in ios i used to play
but it could be any clip he always has to hold yeah real a real pontificating uh self-aggrandizing
so there's a little Jim croche for you now let's see who else can we have uh
when the fork got in there huh how about some queen how about some Freddie Mercury
i got some of the computer i think
stuff said he knows some queen how about Roy Orbison that's what we want
isn't that a shame that we have to like put him to the test and
well why don't we have this and once upon a time we did i got plenty of
Orbison up in Toronto my studio is up there i may have to go up there and play music
if you scour some of those things there might be some Roy Orbison in there
some of these discs that you have back there buried you mean like only the lonely something like that
we sure don't have you got it i love that song you know you remember my great accomplishment at ios
was i got the uh people was it the coast of that i got the people to play you got it i got
disney to convince them to play it put it on the playlist how about that yeah that's the only time
i've ever had any influence on a music on other station you know at fm in the building anywhere
they actually i remember that he came in no they're playing no Roy Orbison now just to pacify me
you know then he went back and puked in the waist basket again he's gone disney
oh sir i mean Roy Orbison another one underrated Roy the boy phenomenal that's my opinion i
might disney get out of here loser by the way nice job there and at the coast whatever the
whole thing is now what is it neither fish nor foul we don't even know what that's the and of
course party radio well people all over town i say they've heard those four records enough now
they're they're switching they're going to power 96 just to spite your ass what would you
i'm up in there now george is with us i think i might have a Roy Orbison song okay oh that'll
do it for me that'll put me in a bunch of better mood i just don't know which one don't forget
Tuesday at smallville tonight that we find out if it's a two-hour episode or not yet well wait
wait for get Carlos on the computer there and get on uh Warner but wb and get that schedule for
night inquiry minds out there why don't we got at least four or five people miss audience who see
smallville not just sitting around looking because there's some good looking people on there

naked in fact i think tonight tonight that Clark go whoops it out that's what i'm hearing

singer's wet of a paper bag frank sonata i i nobody can ever dispute the fact he didn't sing as
he talked to song new york new york he talked to song he never sang never sang one note in his life
and he used to search for the note he did he searched for the know he was sterling new york you
know searching for it like oh i'm close so there is up here jimmy henbridge 19 jimorison 15
11 so many 14 this is not an Elvis crowd which is probably pretty good because if it was an Elvis

Karen cropperter five Jerry Garcia's got four for jumping Jeff from jurzy there there you go that
should pass the value George Harrison three that pisses me off shouldn't George Harrison have
more than three votes sure George Harrison was great certainly much better than Paul McCartney
in spite of what you're saying see Carlos again there's no contest there you're saying that
Paul McCartney is better than George Harrison Paul McCartney created more so much more music you know
what so did a grateful dead no no great music you don't even let me face the sentence more good songs
than any of the other way to see there you go again as Ronald Reagan said there you go again he had
made him the best recording artist how many hits did Frank Zappa have a half a one so so that made him a
bag recording artist see what you're what we didn't ask who was the most commercial recording artist
of all time thank god yeah how about pericomo Paul Rose find a way that's like the other

hi we don't want to put him on her doing whatever that's put him on let's put him on air
we'll give uh... eric something to do he's he's because i heard um most say this morning while i was
monitoring that it's uh... really kind of like a dead Tuesday everything is very very slow
better get used to it more because now that football is over for certain uh... teams like most of
the state of florida except the bucks uh... it's gonna be like that way for months to come i have a
opinion it could be a slow Tuesday and a slow Wednesday and a slow Thursday it's getting mighty
so harry chapens on their two eric how about syd vicious i said vicious and two pack and biggie
and alia left i all left i low pez and donny hathaway donny hathaway is dead who
donny hathaway don't you remember he does song with who do you do that song with i remember
jane hathaway no no donny hathaway and uh... was it deon warwick not deon warwick

reberta fly thank you very much much i'll tell you now now he's got the glasses on you see that he's
got the spectacles on now he's really getting into this heavy duty really serious reberta
flack and donny hathaway where is the law i think that was the name of the song
where is the love you remember that
you remember where is the love i can't believe it what is wrong with man that was donny hathaway
yeah he's dead or at least so it says here can you play jim krochi's don't mess with jim i could
play that if i had a whole cd here i mean robert download that thank you robert
you're okay in spite of what i heard most say about you this morning when i was monitoring
also it says i read that art bill retired yes then i think i've got some guy and they're talking
about ghost i'm coming back from the track last night and any k was doing his gambling thing so i
punched over to iod and they had who is that guy they play ghost music in the back George nori
oh and they play the spooky music in the back oops and uh marvin gay's beautiful daughter
nona nona nona nona will appear in matrix two reloaded in the role intended for the late alia
well at least there's some justice there marvin gay's daughter marvin could make it he's busy
he's busy with virgin Mary on the side of that building so we're building a great list here
well that's not it i already took that out that's on there should he be on there oh i found something
though by the way okay decal the clown they call us and it's right the boy tip those tomorrow
every night you didn't like this one no i like it a lot and now i mean you can play a little
but there's a right the boy ladies
what is a lesser song or what they know probably
we got to get uh what was that oh you got it
which was like hurry lateness for literally but he still looked the same i'd say
kill it that's uh that's so depressing it's even more i mean at least the reason we played all
the depressing bg stuff yesterday's because moris just died over the weekend so we were able to
tolerate some of the earlier bg's the real prediscode depressing days but that's really morbid
but right the boy you'd have to give us one of these strangers not just ugliest he was ugly
but one of these strangest looking dudes whoever recorded a song would you agree
absolutely that'd be a good poll to take some time the strangest uh recording artist huh
huh how about love is strange by mcci and sylvia who i know how about strange brew by
strange brew by cream very good very very good how about our claptin he's not dead yet
but we're working on it his kid is close that window too late too late Eric
remember that day that we lost touch with the audience right you lost touch with the audience we
lost touch with the audience so here's the list so far has the pool coming a lot of votes John
London 41 muffs that he voted for John Lennon took the easy way out frank sanatra 29 jim morison 26
now we're talking oh yeah greatest voice in history next to louise maguelle louise maguelle if we
do louise let's see uh just change again john under 41 so not for 30 are you old farts you silly people
john jimmy hendrick's 26 jim morison 26 elvis 18 yeah that's that's about where he is in our crowd
this is not a big Elvis crowds are mind me again on the 80th anniversary of his death remind me don't
play no Elvis stuff because it alienates and i mean the bg stuff yesterday they tolerated well they
took it they took it with good in good spirit i mean like if Elvis dies again we could like have an
Elvis a little beat us over the head with the bg plus i probably chased chased a lot of the
others people away by tacitizing the men out there who've been uh schlepping to grace land
remember that one show that was a whole time ago but i was in shock i said all you guys that have
gone to grace land your wives and girlfriends must have dragged you there you couldn't possibly have
gone oh no you're wrong the only fact we liked it so much we're going back
i think i think next to playing golf the surest sign of having no life is going to grace land
to see the king but what is i don't know
even his mama before they stuck her in the uh fox for her long dirt nap even mommy said boy
what a bunch of lifeless ancillos they probably wish they had slept with Elvis till he was 21 like i
did anyway frank zappens got and i missed that skipped over Elvis 18 Jim Krochi 15 thanks again
muff and robbert because he'd never have 15 if we hadn't played the couple of clips there
bad bad lee roe brown i butch is one of the most popular songs in this time you know it's a good old
boy song i love it Freddie Mercury 14 thanks zappa 13 Roy Orbison 13 there you go George
just in time for a he'll probably go down to loose them now after you play that
Marvin gay 12 i don't see any beach boys getting any votes on here Marvin gay's got 12 i don't see
a dentist or Carl Wilson getting any to debunk your theory carry carbon with eight i think

Sam Cook, Patsy Klein, Otis Redding and...
And what I find.
I found it.
I've been needing for what you're saying.
When you say you know I'm stating it, no one but you know it's for me.
I've been needing for what you're saying.
When you say you don't care.
Nobody else but me.
I sure liked him, Otis.
I liked him a lot.
Rick Nelson.
So how's that vote coming so far?
We got 75 million votes.

Holy moly man.
Otis Redding don't have none yet.
Well he just went on there.
Huh?
He doesn't have any Otis.
Patsy Klein's got one.
See?
There you go.
Probably the guy who facts me that.
Rick Nelson's got two votes.
Are you people out of your mind?
He's only got two votes.
Jesus Christ.
Call out Virgin Mary and get her on the case.
We only got two votes.

And don't Jerry Garcia.
Mary.
We never part.
So long Mary.
So good by heart.
Take a look at that.
Jerry Garcia's got seven votes and Rick Nelson's got a pair.
A small pair.
Does that tell you what this town knows about music?
Does that tell you what America's all about?
Jerry Garcia and the great.
Well then I will say this.
If it wouldn't have been for them,
we wouldn't have been in juries having so many great ice cream flavors.
We wouldn't have had no fish food because there wouldn't have been no fish.
Right?
Well they might have named it something else.
We wouldn't have had no cherry.
We wouldn't have had no cherry.
We wouldn't have had no cherry Garcia.
Who wants beetle food?
Ooh.
Just the sounds of that.
Beetle food?
Or something else?
Like sawdust, you mean?
Two votes.
I could play all of these songs.
You still won't get them any votes, but I mean...
It's wrong with you people.
Well I've been waiting ever since it.
Guess my face has gotten undisturbed.
Broken heart.
I will say this much though.
See because you'll recall that Ozzy and also being the genius that he wasn't
doesn't get as much credit now that he's dead.
Anymore when he was alive.
And did the first TV music video, which was Traveling Man with Rick Nelson.
But when it really...
At the end of the show, Rick...
Once he started his musical career at the end of Ozzy and Harry Day,
we'd Rick with Sing a Song.
He'd be there with a little band and he'd sing the song, whatever his current hit was.
When he really pissed me off was when he did this song.
Because I'm fast-sominal with my favorite then, and it's still one of my favorites today.
And it's just frosted my ass.
Big time.
Give me an arm and love again.
I mean who you kidding man?
No one here is dead.
I mean, I'm not ready.
Not thinking about that.
Well...
I mean, that's just...
You ain't no fat stomino sweetheart.
You look really good.
You look pretty damn good.
Let's take a look at it.
But I mean, as far as fat stomino, he don't look good at all.
I mean, he is pretty chubby.
Chubby boy.
But what a great singer, huh?
He's still alive so he isn't on our list.
And as a matter of fact, wait till that day when fat stomino meets his Marvin Maker, huh?
And then we'll put him on list and do this poll again.
And if he doesn't get like a whole lot of votes, I'm gonna be really indignant and pissed off that day, more so than usual.
I'm gonna have my ass frosted and put him in Macy's window.
When you be pissed off, fat stomino, in fact when we did the greatest...
Which one we've done so many of these, I can't keep track.
How did he do?
Don't recall.
Erick can look it up in between sandwiches and in between adding more names on list.
Hey, listen, we want to keep Erick busy up there. He's always talking about how busy he is.
Let's put him to the test. He's not too busy to put these names on here and believe you me.
He shouldn't be.
Playing hooky, do remember if you've forgotten voice, Royce Michael Mayo, in his morning's commentary in the Sun Sentinel.
He says, the barflies were sitting around, Danny's last call on Monday, remembering a friend when someone brought up an old joke.
The first thing I do is read the old bits of my names, not there, means I've got to get up.
Getting up never used to be a problem for my cranberry.
When he ruled morning radio in South Florida, he'd set the alarm clock for 3am, springing out of bed before the backup went off at 3.30.
Then he'd be off to the WIOD studios where he'd make waking up easier for the rest of us.
The old bits didn't do him justice. He died January 3rd at age 60, a forgotten voice relegated to the fringes.
The Harold gave him 229 words, the Sun Sentinel 300.
Even the newspaper in Cleveland where he had his first big success, did better with 462 words, too bad the plain dealer couldn't spell his name right.
A great guy, a generous guy, said Barron or Dan Chichester.
Remember he used to talk about him?
No, I do.
Anything anybody asked, he was there. He was a very funny guy, but not ha-ha funny.
A sumer was a sarcastic, dry, subtle kind, and he wasn't afraid to have a cocktail.
A Minerie's last stop at WJNA launched a crusade to create a summer holiday called Hookie Day.
His listeners met him at Captain Jack's Ocean Frontiki Bar and Pulp at a beach, and they drank the morning away.
We're doing this because August doesn't have any holidays when he explained in 2000, I figured two or three years Maxwell had this declared legal holiday, and everybody will get the day off.
Winnerie wasn't an international pop star like Morris Gibbs who was death-din-rate front page coverage, even in the region where he worked for 27 years.
He was just a solid guy who did a lot for the community, he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for local boys and girls clubs.
In Cleveland he organized Winnerie's Raiders volunteers who cleaned up public parks, and he co-founded shoes for kids which collect sneakers for poor kids.
Winnerie spent 17 years at WIOD, the station at Launchler at Kings Career, and was a former home to Neil Rogers and Hagelberg.
The station rewarded him by firing him in 1993, said he wasn't attracting enough young listeners, wouldn't even allow him a farewell show.
Even as Winnerie bounced around the soft-loaded dial, leasing his own time over the past decade, he maintained the loyal core of listeners.
The Chichester was one of them. Their friendship was born 25 years ago when Chichester owned several restaurants and sent Winnerie a case of Smurna vodka for his 35th birthday.
Winnerie repaid the favor a few years later by showing up on Chichester's law at 6am, with the Croll Springs High School Marching Band.
It was my 40th birthday, Chichester, said I knew something was up when I heard the dog making funny noises. I opened the door and there's a 100-piece band playing the Star Spangled Banner, and there's Mike with his headphones on, broadcasting.
He said Danny, we put four cases of champagne and I so we can make a party of it.
Now Chichester is tining a party and fundraiser in his old friend's memory. It'll be February 20th from 5 to 10pm at his new bar in Fort Lauderdale, 33-55 Northeast, 33rd Street, a $20 check to the Boys and Girls Club gets you all the chicken and ribs you can eat.
He knew Winnerie hadn't been well for the past year, figured it was serious when Winnerie gave up the booze.
Winnerie was a less frequent part of the Breakfast Club friends who would eat and drink after Winnerie's show. Winnerie stopped by Chichester's new bar in early December. There was something wrong with his throat.
He said something about a tumor a few weeks later he was gone dead after surgery. Every day at somebody else at Chichester you can hardly walk because of neuropathy.
I just wanted to do something for him to try to raise a few more grand for the Boys and Girls Club. I think he would have liked that he had a heart of gold.
Nice going there Mike Mayo, at least you made an attempt. People as it was, at least you made an attempt.
And the main point in there was here is a guy who did a lot for the community, raised a lot of money, was a fixture for almost 30 years and he gets 300 words in a goddamn sun sentinel and 229 in a herald and is buried back on the obits page.
Tom Jic of course being too busy. He's out there in Hollywood again for the 500th time this year already in so they January being wind and dying to write those puff pieces about the stupid ass network shows and a bunch of crap.
He's one of the evil doers terrible Tommy. He used to be a good guy but he's turned into an evil doer.
Tragic. I wonder if Tom Jic will write anything when he gets back to town when he excuse me then George.
Will the old news you think is that going to be the excuse? Sure that sounds good. Yeah. We hate you Tom. Don't take it personal but we hate you like poison just like Hank hates Mo.

I'll tell you the guy was scary. Hold those eyes. He looked like he could suck the urine out of your bladder with the power of his mind alone.
Bobby Lardman was a roadie for Gary Newman during his heyday. After every show he thought she's it's too weird. He like unzipped his skin and there was this spindly-ass glowing alien from like close encounters. I sh**t my pants. I'm not ashamed to say it.
In 1980, BBC rock critic Edward Upper Glass was sent to interview Gary Newman. He has never returned but an audio tape was mysteriously delivered to BBC headquarters in London days later.
Gary, who are your musical influences? Are you bleeding? Kidding me? No!
Gary Newman, think about it. You never see him and a being from outer space in the same photograph together. It's a big juicy, stopping wet look at show business tonight on inside of a hind.
Maybe he was a really an actor. It's 10-47 at 5-60 W.Q.A.M. So Eric faxes me a pool that we did back on sometime. I don't know when he'll us was. But anyway, we did a pool we asked which of these songs you liked the best we had. 1894 votes.
Man, it must have been a weekend pool. I'm assuming. And I was American Pie wanted. Why did he fax me this? Because I asked how fat stomino did. Right, he faxed you the two categories that he was in on poles that you did.
Aha! Okay. Well, here's Harry Reem's biography. Anybody interested? No. Get him a body cut. American Pie won 243 Lila. Own over Lonely Heart by Yes. Are you kidding me? Own over Lonely Heart? It was okay. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, Stevie Ray Vaughan, no. Some of these facts that I'm a far less today. No. Also, Joe Strummer. No. The answer is no.
But thanks for the suggestions. Anyway, fat stomino is on here was a blueberry hill was 29th. Had 21 votes. I mean, owner of a lonely heart pizza of great balls of fire. Dear God by STC. Why did we put that on there even? I don't think I was here for that. I mean, we like it. But why did we put that you weren't here for that? Higher and higher by Jackie Wilson. Don't even it's over crowded house. Oh, I see. I see. I don't see. I don't see.
Oh, and then there was the other one the best male recording artist. Here we go. Roy Orbison 147 Ellis had 141. Isn't that pleasing to you? That's pleasing to me. Steve Tyler only 37. Freddie Mercury had 110. J Black 14. Where's fat stomino? I had only seven. He's in such a different genre. You know, he's just such a whole different thing. There's your thing he's got like a different thing. I ain't seen it. And I really don't want to. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,
o, m 5, 6, p, o, m E, h e, e, t, t, and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Yes ma'am you know you took the 40, not the number of words that theI obituary's lists for names, and I'm not sure that the cause of it. Everybody's aware of it-, the newapers charge you for those words. The families. Your- I had no idea. 다음 content biliary. No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but the fact is this was not a regular obituaries like a news story on the old bit page
Well, it yeah, but you know, they take every opportunity to make money anyway. They can that's outrageous
They charge me
$800 for an obituary for my son
Oh my gosh, and and then they used it in the Spanish paper as
information it was a
Suicide and
They took every opportunity to sell papers and
They're still filling me for that. I mean it's ridiculous. I can't believe that they touched that amount of money
800 bucks to publish an obituary and the other five I would send it back to him and say good luck to you
Fighting it good for you
Yeah, anyway, I just want to let you know. Okay, thanks. I'm sorry. Okay
5 6 7 depressing 5 6 7 0 5 6
10 5 6 the only 18 T and T and for eyes were as well. You give me a look like that
Now see the stories that Mike Mayo was referencing weren't you know the regular
Bitter is what he's talking about the like these were all of this these were printed as news stories because he was a celebrity
But the point that Mike was making was then and accurately so because he's ripping it off from what I said is that
Here's I'm not gonna go through it again. If that's the case
Why would anybody have an obituary printed?
The people that need to know are gonna know well, I'll tell you one thing my father's obituary was like very very short just a few words
Just a handful of words
In fact, there were only two words that I saw in a story that I satisfied me
Yeah, that was enough for me. I don't have to read the obit page anymore 5 6
You I told you that before and I was a truth both newspapers
That was the first thing I looked at every single day for years and then finally I'm up and through honor
I get a phone call. I guess what your father died and I said oh right now. Okay, I don't have to read the obits
And I never understood the issue before then I heard him call a talk show once really. Yeah, did you really yeah?
Exactly
Here's for a lot of deal hello Neil. Yes, sir. Okay on Sunday
Mad listening to magic and they said they were gonna play a bunch of songs for the bg's for Maurice Gibbs
Right, I didn't even get to hear them
But I went and said 11 came back outside
Magic again. What was the first song that's laid?
Building a butter oh
You see I wasn't exaggerating I'm not be somebody over there must have a fetish on that song
How about two names Frankie Lyman and Mama Cass?
Well, those are the marginal ones
Okay, thanks
What about Mama Cass Frankie Lyman is not gonna go under bokeh Brian would vote for right?
I mean Frankie Lyman was okay. In fact, I have that many disc. It's got all the stuff on here
Of course we can't play because we don't got no many display in here anymore
It's being it's being thickest. Yeah, as soon as I leave it'll be you know, it'll be back
But mama Cass, what do you think? No?
Well, you got so many people that have died
Hard to rate
Right I mean she was all right. She was fat
Loved her now what she choked on a sandwich or something. I think they just made that sort of like Muriel Lonza
Choked on the sandwich. She grabbed on it. She choked on her fat very good the way to put it
She was big and fat. We don't have a lot of sympathy on the show for big fat people of croque over their own fat
Now if I was skinny, I mean then I would have no credibility, but I'm fat myself
Does that make any sense? No, no again graded on the QA curve
Although I do have great circulation in my feet my good podifers told me that yesterday
Thanks to remember my podifers friend said I have great circulation
In fact, I checked the herald circulation. I got a bigger one than they got
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. Oh, we hate you with the hero by the way. Can't stand you
pound 5 60 on the 18 T and T and Verizon wireless line
We do like Mike Mayo personally. He's not a bad guy, but his columns
Generally blow all of the winery won. Thank you Mike. Thank you for at least being one voice
Even though it was very very very lame
But at least being one voice to make the point of this guy after all he did and raised the money was a pretty good guy
Deserved a little bit better, but this time like I've told you it's unyielding man. They give you nothing back nothing back
Just like just like a couple of months ago when there were a bunch of assholes trying to like drum me off the ear and get all whipped up
The Fox News thing anybody in this town even write about it. Did they even recognize it? No? No?
Nothing zero Zipity doda
Here's Miami. Hello

See now he's sucking up to me just like Moe is trying hey, we're monitoring you Moe
I hear all that sucking around. I'll always stop doing that for a few days
Since I told him to blow it out his old ass
It says the doors are a group that were way before their time
If the same group had come out today they would have dominated even more than they did in the 60s
Also, I'm not sure you agree, but I happen to think the doors the movie is absolutely incredible
Val Kilmer did a dead-on Jim who could have done better
Except maybe what's his name does the news and I would be my former producer that nitwit
John Leavitt who used to travel with the doors
And then he used to slam doors in his face is what I'm hearing
John Leavitt
I heard him also when I was listening to that spooky guy that guy with a ghost on iod last night. What's his name?
I don't know you told you told me before
Carlos that came from him, but anyway, uh, and I heard the newscast there was John
Leavitt my friends in the Jewish community and my friends in the light and community. Oh get out of here John
man
Anyway, it says I've seen that movie hundreds of times and guard that DVD with my life's Greg
He's seen the movie hundreds of time even the godfather and network as many times I've seen those movies
I certainly couldn't say I've seen them hundreds of times
I would say that anybody who has seen any movie except maybe Debbie does Dallas a hundreds of times has some kind of neurotic problem
I'm sorry Greg
It says they're the only music from the 60s that I love see well. There's more problems see what I'm saying
You probably don't remember what I sang a song parody on your show spelled P-I-P-A-R-I-T-Y
See parody is what we have in the national football league all mediocre teams parody is P-A-R-O-D-Y
See you learned something already dig Greg not parody, but parody if you got it
Oh, I sang a song parody on your show about seven or eight years ago using light my firetattled Shula time to retire
Remember that? Yeah, no no
P.S. it would make my day if you could do it your Ross Perot impression, please no
Today's Greg and uh, you know like I told you I knew one of these good as yesterday because yesterday's was his close to perfection
And was good timing to run on the hills of Morris Gibb passing away
So today naturally you don't want to do too good because then I have to live up to that every single day
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's a call from Davy hello
Davy
Is gone. Okay, so that leaves us with one call on the board
What a nasty kettle of fish we got here now, you know what?
You
Last call is from Miami. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yes. What about Kurt Cobain? He's on there
What do you know there? Well, wait a minute. Maybe now let me check see on his
I'm gonna put him on
Let's say Kurt Cobain. There he has got eight votes. Hey votes
Okay, also about the bg's. I mean, I'm not a big fan of the bg's
I mean, it just bothers me the way the guy sings like a like a white woman with that high pitch voice, right?
I mean, I have a falsetto
Is that a woman? Yeah, and after Dennis Schraublin. Yeah, I mean, I can take her lever
But for the most part, I don't think it's about her voice. I mean if you want to listen to somebody just for the voice
Very polished. I mean, you might as well listen to Julianne Drew's. It's about what you know the the rawness
You know the rawness. Yeah, the rawness edging is a lack of production
I mean sometimes you can have like an open source somewhere in your body and it's really raw
But you don't enjoy the rawness. I mean, like you
Unless you're doing that even as far as the doorboard goes
I mean most of the artists on the doorboard are probably you know crappy over polished pop stars like you know the boy bands and all that crap right and
I like like O-town. Oh
Exactly, and I mean, I think George knows a most of the good music out there doesn't even make it to the top
Of the charge at all. Yeah, so you know, that's like so so what are you trying to say that?
Janice Schraublin was great because she was like yeah like that. Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't need to listen to them
Like I think you have to be really strong. They're really drunk to really listen to her now. You're getting warmer. Okay. Now. Yeah
You got your thumb right on it. I'll admit it, but I mean as far as I mean, I think she's a lot better than that
You know, Brittany bitch or you know, well now you're talking last time power, you know, mm-hmm. All right, Neil. Love you. Thank you
There you go. He made a couple of good points there. I'm already not sure what they were but
He said Janice Schraublin was great and if she came door to door selling as the A-bond lady he'd open it wide in the door too
And then kick her ass out. Well, yeah, maybe he never saw her
You seen her. Oh, yeah, man
He made Doreen look good
5 6 7 0 5 well 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 just a joke Doreen just relax back there
Where would I have you are in a building? I have no idea where anybody isn't a building now
You know what just as well probably just as well

Have you met the new sales guy yet boy waiting to meet this fruit cake, you know that stuff
He's talking about other sales people PD Lenny
Boy, do you see that routine he went through getting on a scale here? Do you see that routine? No
Took off his jacket took out his
Keys took out his wallet laid it on the table over there weight about 45 pounds the wallet
Then he goes over there. I'm doing great. I'm doing great way. I 82 pounds soaking wet
He's red rough and sore
I
Get red rough and sore just seeing him waddle in there in the morning
He just that's one of the things about not being here. That's the best that is the best
Not having to lay my eyes on PD Lenny. It just makes me feel like a real human being
So he doesn't like to be Jesus because they're muted well. I mentioned that yesterday
That it wasn't exactly what you called your macho group, but in spite of that sir
I will say this in our poll which we got a pretty good bunch of macho guys out there at least for your forum
They did very well
Didn't you didn't you think they did better than
expected better than expected right
Especially with the sour ass hateful audience we got a people or and didn't that guy say that it was very
Negatory that phony shrink the quality of the day right starting up his crap again
It's negative when we want to feed negative when we want to feed positive like about the bg's it was mostly positive
So there you go. It's the in and the yang that's the way life really is sir

So even though they're just pure sugar. It's like it would be like taking and injecting liquid sugar into your veins

See and we didn't ask who the best ah
We didn't ask for the best I purposely did that
We asked who's your favorite which doesn't mean that they're necessarily the best for example
Like I think that the Jim uh Marvin gay
Was better than some of these other ones above him but not necessarily somebody's favorite
Thought I'm saying does that make any sense maybe a little bit
There's a difference
Uh, it's not like food if you were to say what's what's your favorite flavor of ice cream
Then that would be the one you think is the best
Right right okay

It says if you George you suck if you back on it might all you miserable
This is great. Oh, he's one of many people who wants to have a conversation with me off the air now
We advise you George having a conversation with anybody on here. I immediately throw rocks through the window
Explain that on the air a lot. This is a talk show of hand
The only people supposed to crawl in are either rumour or people who have something to say to me
He's the guy that calls up and says I don't really want to go on the air but and that's not
Arnold Arnold sorry that we don't play that game
If you want to call George I give you his home number and his cell phone
And the number at this motel. He's so nice to you on the air. It's given the number at the phone booth
No Miami were robby young used to live
He says me last week you mentioned the Frank Zappa song titties and beer. It's off the live in the york album. I've noticed for Frank Zappa
But but still that wasn't that album. I had nothing to do with the song that I keep thinking in which I'll play in a minute
It's live at the rocks here something. I you know, I'm sure that song is like a takeoff. I don't know
Maybe I could be wrong but nobody it's a parody on something
PS George I dedicate the song who are you by the who to you because you're so phony with your split personality
Take care Arnold. I guess I guess he's saying take care to me because it says you're on the top. It doesn't mean you take care
He's thinking in your case take a good. See I already did this morning is what the report was and it was great

What
A perfect cross-brings didn't happen with your decision on mama caz
He says what about the sandwich eating mama caz and also steve you steve you rave on they won't let steve you rave on alone
I didn't I tended at
Erosmith's career was revitalized by run DMC. I thought it was steve you rave on the steve you rave on
Revitalized mama caz's career by yankin at sandwich out of her throat
Yeah, he reached right in there and yanked it out and the sandwich too
So there you go. Okay. Oh, yeah
What am I gonna tell you five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t
We got an alert by the way for phony votes alert on Jimmy Hendrix after we had a little thing
And I looked it up in the book we had a Jimmy Hendrix uh flurry there at experience
Yeah, Jimmy Hendrix experience and I think Jimmy Hendrix is getting a big big buzzer in the skies what he's getting from us
Because John Lennon's got 83 and Jimmy Hendrix all of a sudden out of nowhere's got 70 anybody buying that no way
That's all the people out there still do an magic mushrooms that they had shipped in from Amsterdam
Jackie Wilson's on a pool. I don't have any yet. He'll get some five hundred and twelve votes already and most of them seem to be real
Couple of odysreading a pair patty Klein for Janice Chaplin
Rick Nelson and buddy Holly five see that that's just do you realize how ridiculous that is
That Janice Japlin is tied with Rick Nelson and buddy Holly
I mean, it's just outrageous
buddy Holly who wasn't around that long because he died in that plane crash
But he was considered to be one of the early
Pioneers indeed kind of like they be crockered Daniel Boone
Think he came from the same town, but I'm sure you must have had many an argument
And I'd like to point out by the way Elvis Presley's not from Tennessee is from Tuplo, Mississippi
I just mentioned that for the idiots there on the VH1. Oh, anyway, I had arguments about what Janice Chaplin
People argue that point with you all the time. What point you mean the one that the guy said up and then they say oh no
She was great no
All the time really oh she was great great what a great singer a great performer on the same people say that who said the Bruce Springsteen is a singer
Not just a great the fact that they say he's a singer at all. I find very amusing
Couldn't sing as well of a paper sack
And to watch him exploit the tragedy of 9-11 the way he's done and waving the American flag and go through this whole dog and pony show
To try to revive a flagging career if I can use that word just really pisses me off
Bruce Freak and Springsteen
I think he's been blinded by his blight if you ask me
He couldn't lick manford man's ass Irish spring asses. I was just thinking about. Oh Irish Springstees that on here
I think it's ACN. Oh, oh, it's in the thing
It's in your thing
Anyway, the fact that Rick Nelson and the buddy holly have to be saddled with Janice Joplin who's going door to door trying to sell
personal care products to Carlos so we can do sh in the shower in the abat
Seriously, you should see when I want to take a leak a 25 I'll never forget it
And he's got like all these all style the stuff around like he's in home some people bathe before they leave in the morning
Yeah, that's really a good idea at moment
He doesn't have a tub at the house
What is he doing water? We know if he lives like in a place in his car. I think does he live in his car?
Does he have a car he has a car?
Oh, what kind of car does he have?
Little one
Uh, he has a little over at Nelson just moved ahead of Janice Joplin. Thank you whoever did that
Thank you very much if I had a prize to send you. I do we have nothing
Harry Chapin eight George Harrison's out only nine George Harrison's got only nine
What's wrong with you people he died not that long ago
Even if we only wanted to vote on like my sweet lord and uh
What's the other one they would I love?
George Harrison saw the George Martin thing got my mindset on you. Okay, very good. Oh, very good
And there are a lot of people. Oh, that's commercial crap. That's it like that the George Martin
Neo was all that same crap. How was it great? It was great. I played that on Zeta was coming out of my ears at Zeta
Because I loved it
Better than that crap pd uh, bolder one just to play you idiot you assassin you grave robber
Kurt Cobain 10 Morris give 11 Bob Marley's got 11 months he Bob Marley's on air. What do you what you people be talking about
Karen Carpenter's got 13 a lucky number for us and unlucky one for her though
Jerry Garcia's got 16
Roy Orbison 19 Frank's app of 22 I guarantee you will be doing better if we have some good stuff like you got it
You got it Frank's app of 22 Marvin Gaye 24
Uh Jim Krochi 29. Thank you again to muff and uh
Little Robert for the Jim Krochi stuff
He would never gotten that many votes and you want to know what really put him over got him that many votes
What
Big badly broly were a brown. Oh, yeah
Well, this is the kind of place where that would be a most of america is the kind of a place
Oh, yeah, it's great, but it's a little on the red that he said oh my set is in the door again. Don't slam it
It's actually turned the city. I beg your pardon he already told me that I gave him credit
That was a talk-up that will live for the 80s
It was one of those contrived 40 talk-ups Ricky Tiki
five six four
All the time that's that puking thing we got important to read in the magic city that thing
What is that under that thing I were spring thing no no the the the talk-up thing
I think it's under Ricky Tiki. No, it's because that's not Ricky Tiki. You're you're losing it
Just before I really thought you were like making a comeback. That's not under Ricky Tiki
The the cart that it was on had just a question mark on the front liquor remember the label right a question mark on it
Isn't that amazing that we can remember with our brilliant minds all of this unimportant crap
It's almost like remembering Harold Snodgrass
at Hazel Park and

You don't know what it's under. I thought it was Ricky Tiki
All in these years you thought that was Ricky Tiki was a real real Ricky Tiki
But that's what I thought they were making fun of and that's what I thought it was labeled as
No
It had a question mark on the front remember question mark on a mysterious. Oh, I had a feeling he's probably still alive

Oh, and here's one I guess Bill Cabrine must have called somebody and
Bribed him to the fact that in
So we put around there and on
Dusty Springfield oh
I don't know
I mean that how could how seriously stop a stop and think about the nature of this pool
Here's the question again and a lot of times I'll ask a poll and
I you know we appreciate we get a lot of votes and some of them are even real ones
It's just that you don't look at the question carefully enough stop and think about it take two or three seconds before you hop right in there
And do something stupid like duff talking about the ball of the john yoko, which he apologized for he said he never wants to hear it again as long as he lives
Who who is your all-time favorite dead recording artist dead
Now I get it who would say that dusty springfield that would be like saying
If she dies someday, which he might saline Dion you know
You find some frogs some frog you know we don't frogs aren't allowed to vote in our pool
Okay, we have a frog filter they can croak if they want to but I sure can't vote on our pool
Who is your all-time favorite dead recording artist Elvis
Janice Joplin John Lennon how about the Lennon sisters
How about Lawrence or well, huh Lawrence about what what's that thing we got in there? Oh, I know what we got you know, I never play it
Oh, don't tell me it's not in here. What is that under G dead is it under G dead? Oh, we're let's sir. I
Don't I don't see it
How come it's in my DCS in Toronto when it's not in the one here? Oh
Because it's the guy's name who said that
No, it's not a Florence Welk. No, it's not
It's not in here. It's in there, but it's not Lawrence Welk who said that. Oh, it's a Stan freeberg. There it is
It's still I see what you saying. It could be possibly be understand freeberg
So you always do that to it's not maybe it's under freeberg
I don't think it's in here and you're just making up all kinds of stories. It's not in there you lied George lied
Anyway, can I get back what what what that was I doing Jimmy Hendrix by the way overlook some of those votes under because I I catch that in a heartbeat
You're not a fool in this old queen. I'll take it out right now
That's what the Freddie Mercury would say if he could
Elvis Janice jobling John Lennon. I want to keep saying the Lennon sisters. I don't know why it's just the way he used to say it now the Lennon's
sister

Somebody will call George Harrison Roy Orbison Jim Morrison Jimmy Hendrix Mori Morris Gibb
Stop calling him a Reese already, okay? Mo Gibb
Marvin Gaye Jim Croci oh Jim Croci
Better than a walking car
Me know that your car
How do you roll your camera? I think if they want to have a true test of a patriotism that everybody should stand up
And anybody who raises their hand and says they don't like Jim Croci immediately deported that would satisfy papu can
And I think he's a little bit unhappy the love you folks came in Georgian Carlos
Jim Croci buddy Holly
You like buddy Holly sure why not we like buddy. He's a little overrated. I would say though
How many hits did buddy Holly have before he died
Peggy Sue that'll be the day that was buddy Holly in the crickets what else
Let me look it up in a book just because we don't want to be scientific
What else I mean he did die in a very young age and it was gonna be bigger than life itself
I guess he was extraordinarily ugly like Roy Orbison I think that helps
I think that helps a lot oh look at all them uh hits on here
But not big ones see
Peggy Sue that oh boy that's right oh boy
Maybe baby
Raven oh yeah think it over pools paradise early in the morning real wild
Heartbeat it doesn't matter anymore rating in my heart and someday when I'm gone from you oh Bobby V in the crickets
That must be after that plane crash
Bobby V remember Phil Henry hated Bobby V remember that I got very upset that day

By Bobby V and red rubber ball was by the circle jerk. It's wrong with you
5 6 7 on ton you the music stuff that we do I just get blown away in fact
I think we're changing format to all music
Starting right now okay
I mean if it was good enough for Q and back in the old days not guarantee our signals probably a lot better now than it was then because our crack engineering department
Aren't there on crack
I said your hoodie was got a big crack. I'm sure that cuz he's basically like a lot. I don't want to I don't want to think about when who you'll bend over
Especially if you're like downwind can you imagine can you imagine when the fact people in this building cut oh cut loose
Man oh man. Oh man. Can you imagine being downwind from fat boy?
Whoo talk about heavy duty

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line
Here's a call online one that don't have nothing next to it George. Hello
Where's this from? I don't know. Here's a call from somewhere
Is that me? That's you. Where are you calling from sir?
All right, well I wouldn't tell anybody either
Okay, well I know some of the details about that uh the aerospace misresurrection and run DMC go right ahead the actual
They put him back on a map is what I'm hearing
Well sort of the actual resurrection happened long before the Armageddon soundtrack in 1989
With songs like ragdoll and jane he's got a gun right great right before that though before we saw
Uh the band again on mpv run DMC read it that song and had aerospace myths are in it
So they didn't really have anything to do with it
They just kind of showed us Steven Tyler right before David Gesson resurrected aerospace with the jane you've got a gun and everything there you go
Uh can I ramble a quick conspiracy before I hang up it's only two seconds sure go right ahead
Okay, the term british invasion actually originated from the CIA to represent British artists whose lyric some of their lyrics
We're originally intended to work on the minds of a few assassins living in the United States
But that all ended when the CIA used their own assassins marked David Chapman to kill John Lennon
Who didn't know the origin of some of the people's lyrics and was super enough to stay living here
All right, okay
Did you know that the CIA killed John Lennon off until the small but I never knew that
Roger Whitaker
So
He belongs out there
The box he just let him right oh
Com air here's the vacuum com air is the place

Anybody that picks on Steve Tyler's gonna have a call over my big fat smelly body. I'll tell you that right now
Okay, Steve Tyler is god right next to
That's right
Great I still don't understand anybody doesn't like their music. What what is there to knock about their music?
Huh, I mean, I realized not everybody likes fish food or rocky road ice cream
But how could you not like hero Smith explain that to me in addition to which I discovered and I found this out the hard way over the years every time
We talk about music that the people who dislike them dislike them intensely. It's not like just a hate them
I don't I don't know maybe they figured like they're competing with somebody that they like I don't have any idea
Just that the people who don't like hero Smith hate them
Both of them
Now here I was trying to thank thank goodness for duff here because this is his one area of expertise is this corny old music
Him and Bokeh Bryant, but somebody faxes blew on blue by Bobby Vinton
Ha, which isn't exactly Bobby V. He's got Bobby Vinton the Polish prince confused with Bobby V
What do you laugh at about that's what he's known as the Polish Prince? I know all about okay, sure

If we got job rule how about jamama
What do you say mama? Okay, let's put her on there see what happens put big fat mama Cass on there Eric don't listen to these guys
Okay, you're just doing a out of prejudice
That
Well, that's right Carlos just reminded me the Papa John just croaked sure long ago Papa John from the pizza place
I know he died. I know he loved John Sebastian. Let's put him on there. All right, well he he belongs on there more than mama Cass
He wasn't some fat old slob that ate too many slommy sandwiches and choked on John Sebastian was pretty good musician
Sure
Let's put John Sebastian on there. What do you say and then maybe we'll put Joel Sebastian on there later
Man was he a good dish jockey Joel Sebastian. I loved him
Let's play some more that DJ stuff
Okay, no, I mean it's just it's just a joke
Well, you're just you're brutal. You're really right. All the things that that one factor said about you
He didn't even come close
So we're putting mama Cass on there and who else and Joel and Joel. I mean a John Sebastian
You don't even know who Joel Sebastian was he was on WSYZ in Detroit
He was he was a this jockey was on Ckl W and Detroit
He was on I think I'm WCFL
And it was also on WSYZ in fact once upon a time WSYZ in their heyday is a rock station in Detroit
All the guys in their head at same kind of like I'm not how to describe the throaty
They had a kind of like Phil Henry you know that throaty kind of sound fills got their real gravity
Yeah, no not gravely, but like a rich Joel Sebastian sound like that and Lee Allen also the guy don't see that was on the weekend
And then he went to Ckl W I believe would Dave Schaeffer and dead babies

That's seriously did we put him on there or not I think not
Oh, you know what happened? Voka Brankham in here in the middle and all these spots all of these spots all of my copies in here like all bald up

What what is he saying?
Nothing that was just this whole big thing going on in here. I thought we might want to share it. Oh yeah

As if in an idiotic taking that pull without Bobby Dermon
Indeed, what do you think about Del Shannon to be on Adam on there
He's not on there. No all those hits
He had three or four good it. He certainly had as many hits as some of the other stiffs we got on here

Prove it. Nobody's perfect even though you've come up with some amazing. I mean, oh you didn't get branded
See when I thought you'd get up at a rock and rub as uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, who you know
You don't know your rock and rebels in Buffalo radio mister. He would talk about it all the time Joey
What I had to do those and what what he says what what he's saying. I don't know. I had to tune down
Joey would talk about the rock and rebels all the time and pretend that maybe those guys actually really got paid
He was a pain in the ass is what I heard. I am that him right. Yeah
He would talk about that rats up your ass or whatever that's rats in my room. Yeah, that was him and Tommy Shannon rats in my room
That was a real song believe it or not
And of course every time he and Bill Marshall were in the studio George was thinking rats in our room

I
Take back what I said before he was pretty damn good Bobby Dermod, but you were name and beyond the sea. That's
fat
I didn't like his corny stuff. I liked his uh upbeat stuff like that
Dream lover. Well dream lover was not beat but it was great. That was a good song. I was his best song. Is there any argument about that? No
See it's always a good way to win an argument is like to close the debate before anybody else has a chance at like
Sorry times up
26 pet now. What about Dusty Springfield? We put a runner to pacify bokeh brine because I better check this list here because Eric is left
The building oh there he goes. You got Del Shannon mama Cass

But nevertheless florists are still there our close personal friends in sponsor florists
Which shows you how great they got to be
They're about the only ones left in that hood which is a shock have you ever been presented with an opportunity when you should have
What it done something what you've passed on it made a bad mistake. Don't do it again
Because here's an incredible fanny main mortgage rate at 3.45% out there just waiting for you the rates available like calling financial group toll free at 1-800-9-4053-63
If you were to compare a 7% rate with 3.45% you'd save 3500 bucks in the first year low for each hundred thousand dollars that you owe
A hundred thousand bucks is only four hundred and forty seven a month
Here's an opportunity that won't last it's a 40 year low
So if you're thinking about refinancing or purchasing a home call financial group toll free
1-800-9-4053-63 the process is simple and the call is absolutely positively free
1-800-9-40-L-E-N-D financial group has been an equal housing lender to thousands of borrowers with this fanny main program
Credit restrictions do apply and rates are something to change if you wait too long
5.34 APR call financial group today at 1-800-9-40-L-E-N-D
5.34 APR call financial group toll free at 1-800-9-40
5.34 APR call financial group toll free at 1-800-9-40
Y'all need any pressure to see

The air is where he'd rather stay
Rather to drop him into the bay
Love's to his license because he had a few
If he couldn't drive then maybe he shouldn't have flew
He'll tour
The tour
Till the air
