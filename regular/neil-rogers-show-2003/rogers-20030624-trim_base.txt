We have a pack on our mics and Neal's coming up next to absolutely.
Wait till you hear Neal today, he's just gonna, oh.
He's gonna go off.
He's gonna what?
You're gonna go off like a NASCAR engine blowing.
On what?
On whatever you want.
Not me.
Yeah, yeah buddy.
Not me.
He's outsiders trying to get us.
All the crap you can unwrap.
All the slime all the time.
I'm in for al!
Coming up next.
That's me.
I'm not even like that.
That's me, slimy man.
I'm the devil.
Satan.
I am the second coming evil.
You should took all the heat off us, I'll tell you the value of the smoky dead is now.
Everybody's suing me, everybody's suing me.
The right focus is then on your ass man.
The whole world is focused on your slimy and.
I'm so mean and slimy and disgusting and repulsive and degrading and just really degenerate.
I'm so potent.
Uh huh.
Good luck to you.
And that's why everybody likes you a lot.
Hey remember this to the, uh, Marlins are gonna be at 500 in the race.
Well you start with that baseball stuff again, Jesus.
I just remember all the pitching matchups.
When the hell is hockey start already?
Hey, did you hear hasakes coming back?
I saw that.
What the hell is that crap?
That's like, it'd be like you're a little bit tired of that crap.
That'd be like, you know, jigs playing goalie.
He is.
How do you get that name by the way?
I don't know.
I think he got it somewhere in New York.
Yeah.
On the Long Island.
Hey, jigs get out of the way.
Yeah.
Why is that?
So you were taking his job this season or, uh, what you better do it now because there won't be any next season.
Well, you know, I heard guilty has that job.
He started with the Univision yesterday.
He had an interview at Fox for a ride at least position.
He's flying all over the place.
I think tomorrow he's got a network die in Sawyer spending an hour with him.
Are you picking on Mo again?
No, no, guilty.
No, you're picking on Mo by the way.
You gotta get it nice.
Listen, I hope all the people in Arizona in the rush friars.
I hope they die.
Yeah.
And that was, that was not me that said that.
I know quite frankly.
I don't know anybody in Arizona.
Lot of right, lot of right wingers out there.
Somebody will get mad at me that I said that, but you know, I love burning wildfires that burn homes down that aren't mine.
We hardly ever glades catches on fire this summer.
It's pretty great.
Every day, Neil, I drive here and you know that as you enjoy never being here that I receive your, you know, like receptacle end of the weather.
I receive your weather and my bed weather when I drive.
I cannot see now driving.
It's called white out.
It's like for television.
I drive now blind with headlights on driving rain.
And yesterday I saw Wayne Heisenga flying through the air.
I heard you would make yesterday that hockey's your favorite sport.
I knew there was something I liked about you.
It is my favorite sport.
I love this sport.
But I also understand that I mean, it is, I think Billiards is more popular right about now.
It is.
It really is and cricket.
When women saw, when Dyke's softball beats hockey, the stand-up playoff sun ratings, you know, we got real problems.
Yeah, but the girl that pitches for Arizona is just like a split and a half.
Everybody wants to do her all over her face and everything.
So they want to tune in for her rack and her face and her nice ass.
And no one cares.
There was a cheek to play for Kyle.
She weighed 600 pounds.
At the time she ran, they thought they were having a fault line.
And you know, Los Angeles was moving.
They were having a earthquake.
Well, Dyke's are definitely in big time now no matter what they're doing.
There's really nothing quite like a really big fat dyke, I think.
Yeah.
This is a great way to start your day is having a 600 pound woman come after you.
Are you pecking on Janet Reno again?
She's dangerous.
She shouldn't be allowed to drive.
She shakes and everything else.
She's hanging out with Sister Gina running the beach right now, Ben.
Yeah, the two of them.
I can just envision it.
I'm sorry.
Okay, you got your up that image.
You're, you listen, don't drag me into that cesspool.
I can just see you right in the middle.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Kind of Lisa is today.
Have a great day, Scott.
Set up the Tel Aviv press conference.
Take off those checker pants.
Oh no!
I'm Ted Nugin, rocker, patriot, and statistic gay man.
As you know, the tragedy in 9-11 was like a really bad thing that happened because it built glit in him to juice.
So I want you to show your support for our president who was appointed by God himself.
For a limited time only, you can have this personally autographed photo of our fearless leader on that tragic day.
He hits him full-gather and on genuine papers made from trees in the Great North West.
Yours for only $150.
Come on, a night of like this will soon be an e-bay collectible.
He know that.
So call 1-800-NRCC right now.
But wait, you call within the next 10 minutes.
You'll receive this never before heard audio of our mighty president on the morning in 9-11.
There once was a cat killer who was very hungry.
He ate an apple, but he was still hungry.
Then he ate...
You think this the president should have been in an attack on the World Trade Center?
Okay.
Then he ate some strawberry-ish and had a stomacic alice.
The Uncle Tick is on the phone.
You shouldn't need a lot of junk food because you'll get a stomache, Aiki.
That's 800-NRCC.
Tell you what, if you call now, I'll even throw in this here.
A bunch of bananas and wearing on my balls.
But we sure like him a lot, don't we?
No.
He'll president say, man, he's got the IQ of a fruit fly.
It's 10-05 at 560 WDQM.
Welcome to another great Tuesday.
Isn't that great?
Uh...
Now please tell me it's not pouring down cats and dogs there yet.
Uh, not as of five minutes ago.
That's good.
Yeah, that's a good thing.
The even better news than that is that Bonerboy showed up today.
He made us a nice kind of a cameo appearance today.
Yippee.
Not in jail today yet?
Certainly.
It's early in the day.
It is early in the day.
He's not on the loose with his caboose.
Probably hanging out with old chief moose.
Get ready to write that book.
Anyway, he's had a few problems last couple of days.
But we don't want to go backward.
We want to go forward.
Don't we?
Absolutely.
And now that I got there in my 360, you're going to be hearing that.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
So many times today.
Factor, man.
Anyway.
So we got the contest.
It hasn't even started yet because it's only the 24th of June.
So the July one hasn't started.
But we got our first entry already.
For the last of these series of high couples contest.
See, this is going to work out really good because we got this thing going on for July.
And then starting August 1, we got our best needle CD in the amoki chain.
Right?
Absolutely.
So what the more could they want?
But we did put that on there, didn't we?
Absolutely.
We took something off there and we put it on the amoki chain.
So that'll be starting August 1.
So we'll keep like a whole bunch of steady crap going on, which is good.
Anyway, if you want to email to neoranges.com, the picture if you want to enter the high couples contest for July.
The prizes are the same as they were for the first two.
Three day, two nights day for two of the Royal Oasis Resort in Casino and Bahamas with Ram trip air for Ram Lake or Air.
Or your choice.
Three night, two day stay for two of hedonism, two or three in Jamaica, all in close to transfer.
Spood, drink, or two of these entertainment, no air for on that one.
And third place will be dinner for two of the world famous pizza log.
You can hang out with the Jeff and he'll show you his famous goods.
So that's the contest in July.
You can start saying the pictures in now.
We already have like I said, one totally unexpected. That was nice, wasn't it?
A little bit of a surprise.
Here also maybe unexpected as a not just a sentence, but a full short paragraph.
Two sentences. What?
Two sentences for the price of none from living history, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
This is going to save everybody out there a lot of cash.
How much of this piece of direct cost?
It's usually on the screen.
28 bucks.
48 bucks.
44 Canadian, a 28 dollars.
Keep your money in your pocket.
Just tune into our show in the first half hour every day.
And we'll read maybe even like a whole paragraph someday.
This is a paragraph.
She says my mother and my grandmother's could never have lived my life.
My father and my grandfather's could never have imagined it.
But they distilled on me the promise of America which made my life and my choices possible.
Let's hear it for Hillary.
There you go.
And that more than enough for one day.
God.
We're already halfway through page one.
Hey listen, Hillary is good and small doses. That's what Bubba said.
I mean, it's only about a 550 page book.
So how many centuries will it take us to read this?
About 30 minutes.
You bet.
Oh, guess we've got some bad news to start today.
I hate to do it on our sour note.
Oh, this guy on six.
This is going to be the retire.
Let's get him out of the way.
Here's Miami Lakes.
Hello.
Hill.
Yeah.
I'm not going to die.
I love Daniel.
Yes, sir.
But I want to say, since you're ready or station,
instead of having the people with the great bodies,
why don't you have people with the great voices?
Yeah.
Well, that'd be more of a profit.
And I mean, people who have a voice for radio.
Exactly.
I'm glad to see you know, on the same phone problems that are for L.D.
They always make the phones perfect for you.
Now, the phones are usually screwed up for us.
And that studio never has any problems.
It's about damn time that they started getting a hex.
Well, you've been yelling at them for years and they've never gotten you right.
Have they?
No, they have not.
You're still God deal.
Number one in our book.
You want to talk about the survey yesterday?
I didn't hear it.
Who won?
I'll get in a minute.
Super.
Have a great day.
Have a great day, pal.
I say goodbye.
Well, that was interesting.
That was like a nice guy in line six as opposed to retire.
And I've got that asshole who then comes back later
and to share with different voices.
Anyway, I have some bad news for you.
Although you don't care because you don't know who this is being the anti-Semite that you are.
Leon Yuris, author of Exodus, novel of the founding of Israel and other best sellers,
dies at the age of 78.
It dies?
Oh, no.
Author Leon Yuris, an immigrant's determined son,
who made it big with a million selling Exodus.
Another greatly popular novel has died.
His ex-wife said that he was 78.
He died Saturday of natural causes at his home at New York shelter Island.
Photographer Jill Yuris said from her home in Aspen, Colorado.
What was some of the other books he wrote?
I don't know.
I like the theme from the...
It's inspiring.
Well, I'm sure that somewhere in this lengthy story that I got here,
it's got the names of the other books that he wrote.
The Angry Hills, Battle of Crime.
There was this first novel to start about the Marines.
Oh, some of the other things that he wrote after Exodus.
Topaz, an espionage story involving the French government, Trinity,
an encyclopedic novel about Ireland.
He was okay Leon Yuris.
You know what I'm saying?
But...
He died?
Happens to the best of us, okay?
A lot of that going on these days, Gregory Peck.
Who else died a couple weeks ago when Gregory Peck...
That news guy.
Oh, David Brick.
Oh, don't say that, news guy.
That's so great.
I forgot.
No, David Brickley, whose eyeball fell out on his cheek
and I knew it was time to retire.
We like David Brickley a lot.
Good night, Chuck.
Good night, David.
Good night, friend BC News.
See, that's way before your time.
I thought of my life.
All the good stuff, you know, I hate to break the news to you
because I don't want you to feel bad.
You and Bonerboy there, but all the good stuff happened before you were born.
No, I understand that you old people keep going on about that.
Oh, there's that spartan on line nine again, our chronic.
Here's the chronic line.
Hello.
Miami.
I know it was him.
But he couldn't wait.
Couldn't wait.
I know Dan Weller was him.
He's the only cause on line nine every goddamn day.
We're gonna get you some help, sir, okay?
After we get a butterfly in it and catch your ass.
We're gonna get you some real help.
We're gonna turn you over to the guy named Miami police.
Now, let me ask you, was it the city of Miami police?
Or was it the FHP or was it the city of Halea police?
Oh, city of Halea police that nailed your ass.
Yeah.
We had that little bit of a wreck and little problem with your license and all these things.
If they grab you and throw you against the wall and leave a thumbprint on your arm.
A nice, bruised thumbprint.
Is there any way to get like prints off of that?
Are you gonna start in with the police again now?
No, it was just a...
See, if I'm you right now, I count my blessings that I'm sitting there on the outside.
I'm free as a bird.
In fact, I can hear what's your name, singing right now.
What's your name?
Free as a bird.
Free as a bird.
What's the hell's your name?
Canadian, Portuguese Canadian.
Relief potato.
Relief potato.
I love Relief potato.
You know, she's actually pretty cute.
She's great.
I was talking about her years ago before her first album was out.
Well, I was talking about her long before you seen her because I saw her in Amsterdam on my satellite.
Back when I had my crappy apartment.
You're right, I'm sure.
When I had this 15, 20, 34 whole bunch.
Fuck third man.
Oh, music channels are on TV.
That was the one great thing.
I played her on the air like three years ago.
And Ellie Furtado.
She's excellent.
She's Canadian, and Portuguese.
Portuguese.
Anyway, I'll give you the result of the poll from yesterday.
A lot of people, of course, are like dying to hear that.
Probably, Spooky's, Buré, whatever her name is.
She's probably listening right now.
They hate you, Spooky's, from Channel 7.
From that embarrassing deck of Drecko Drive show.
They hate you like poison.
Anyway, it's 12 minutes after 10.
