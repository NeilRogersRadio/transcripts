It's not in a hero does not even on Miss Fudge's website. This is from a website Tom Flacco dot com
I yeah, what that sounds like a really good exciting writer. Here's this you want to know why it's not in there because here's what they put in the newspapers
Today icing down comatose patients is endorsed. Do you know who Catherine Harris is?
No, was she raped by Kobe Bryant? She used to be hanging real tight with Jeb Bush
Now just so happens that Jeb Bush was here in Toronto the last two days you following us. Yeah
And according to this story
It says after there was this light plane that cracked you do you hear anything about that story probably not the city Ireland and Toronto here yesterday morning
Yeah, there was a small private plane out of Chicago to crass because it was real heavy fog
Right and so all day yesterday
They were searching for the plane and for bodies and so on
Source said that governor Jeb Bush was reportedly at the accident scene shortly after the crash
Reports and sources are as yet unable to confirm why the Florida Congresswoman meaning Catherine Harris and former secretary of state during the Florida
2000 presidential election Chad controversy had flown from Chicago to Toronto
You think they're getting it on or something? Oh
Well, that was widely rumored. That was the story. That's great. I hope he's doing her repetitively
Well by according to this story she's dead. I don't think he's gonna be doing it anymore
I'm glad she's dead. I've never heard of her. Huh? I'm glad she's dead
I've never heard of it. We did we did her over and if this turns out to be true
We're gonna be a lot of us very pleased too. Nothing. We wish anybody any bad health

Right now it's almost time for a break right now. You're right quick. The second you'll ask
Scott
Quit sucking up to Neil. So I don't know if this story is true or not
We're gonna have to get like because I don't know anything about this website Tom flaco.com. We've never heard of it
But somebody fast is to us and if it really is true because I do know the story about the plane crash
Because it was on the news here all day yesterday was heavy fog yesterday morning in Toronto
And it was a small plane out of Chicago that the disappeared and then they discovered a crash into Lake Ontario
And they were searching all day
But in none of the stories that Toronto star any of the stories is mentioned Catherine Harris
But I will read this story and we'll just we get we got to get a second
We got to get a verification on this right but the big headline says Florida representative Catherine Harris dead in plane crash
According to a source who refused to be named in this story Florida congresswoman Catherine Harris died
Yes, any morning a light plane crash in foggy conditions near Toronto's island airport around 10 a.m
Reports and sources are as yet unable to confirm why the Florida congresswoman and former secretariat stayed during floaters
presidential election controversy at flown from Chicago to Toronto
However, the source also said that governor Jeb Bush was reportedly at the accident scene shortly after the crash and of course
He was here the last two days
Our internet search confirmed that there was a crash yesterday morning in the Toronto islands at about 9.57 a.m
And that there's currently a search while this was yesterday and recovery being conducted
According to a Toronto Globe and Mail report at 451 yesterday afternoon
How also we all confirmed there was activity in Harris's Washington DC congressional office at least until midnight last night on the Monday of a long
Fourth of July holiday weekend when congress was not even in session
The dual plane was a small private beach crap piloted by an unidentified American according to constable Mike Hale
Hales of the Toronto Marine Unit speaking at a press conference yesterday afternoon
Hale said the Adi Adiante plain held seven people including pilot and six passengers
Uh, and it goes out about how they try to confirm it with Harris's office
It says it curiously at least one person was working quite late in Harris's congressional office last evening as their call seeking commos answered at 10.35 p.m
Most strangely the female who answered the phone did not initially identify that we'd even reach the office of US
Congresswoman as would be the normal procedure thus indicating that the woman was likely not a member of Harris's regular staff
So we asked again whether it was her office. Yeah, it is the woman said softly
Whereupon we answer to confirm or deny that Katherine Harris died in the plane crash yesterday morning
The woman somberly told us reporter no comment. We're busy. Goodbye. Hang up the phone at around 10.36 last night
We called back again around midnight the same woman answered the phone
We again asked whether representative Harris had died in the plane crash in the morning
The woman said I only answered the phone thinking you were somebody else
I don't have the authority to answer that question goodbye. She said hang out of the phone around midnight
How you like that?
Ah
Sounds really uh suspicious to me
What that was Katherine Harris coming here to Toronto for a while jib was in town for two days. Huh one can only wonder
Enough to send collab off another one of those wild shopping sprees
Pretty bizarre. Okay, we got a lot of stuff. We got the marlin game coming up at
145. Let's hear it. So we got a short show today. Damn it

Speaking of books
I got from my good close personal friends at amazon.com yesterday
Nice delivery. They sure are great. Yep. Let me just say this right now. Okay, because people are always accusing me of being negative and ripping this one
And if somebody is good, I'll be the first one to scream there up praises
Amazon.com is sensational

Anyway, I ordered it from them. I first order and once you place the first order online with them

Actually, that's a book out of be reading from on a year every day, you know. Yes, please. Yeah as opposed as opposed
To that Hillary Crayl. I just mentioned that in passing
So anyway the thing shows up nice in a nice box
And there it is through just a couple of days and I had it but I mean
Here's the uphold a George took yesterday and kind of embarrassed. What's up your ass? Oh, right. Don't see there
He goes again with an ass stuff. I mean the first show right out of the box
What are some point schedule? He doesn't waste any time he gets right into your ass
With like a little periscope

So must have a lot of busy asses out there asshole drivers three hundred and fifteen of you said that

peda I mean I love animals to a point but you people are like insane. You need to be institutionalized my bank
22 votes
That was my vote. God
See it isn't just playing ordinary pedestrian walk. Kovie anymore now it's first union walk. Kovie
Which is like the anti-Christ has just taken over my bank
Since I've done my bank. Well, let's see a butt plug 22 be an abory 11 my phone company 10
That was that was the end of George's pull the result
I don't want to dwell on it for more than another two three hours about the bank sucks win
What's your IQ gotta be to work in a bank?
Seriously, I mean how stupid is it possible to be and
It started out it was family band by the way my best regards to my close personal friend Matt Korshoff and miss you Matt
Called me on the year one day several years ago offered me the services of family bank kitty corner right from where I live
It was great. He used to take care of everything for me even used to call in my my federal tax deposits everything
Give me like friendly personal service with a smile
Then all of a sudden he left and family bank go change a little bit then all of it before you know to became Republic security bank
That wasn't the too bad. It wasn't great. It wasn't too bad
They'd screw up your account maybe like once or twice a year at tops
Then all of a sudden before you know why you're sleeping you wake up in the morning and Republic security bank
Just became watch over your money bank. They suck
And you go into the bank or you go through the drive through another than my friend Carol
I miss you Carol other than her you don't you see people you never saw before you never want to see again with an IQ of about third man
And they just keep screwing up your account and like putting holds on your account doing all these bizarre things
That they've agreed that they're not going to do and just screwing up your life. Well then all of a sudden one day
I don't know what day that was
It becomes not just plain or ordinary walk over your bank anymore, but now it's Republic security and I'm in the what is it first union
first union
Could that be the same first union as in first union securities and matures?
Yeah, that's what it sounds like to me. So we know what they're all about their crap
And my nine digit
Account say I got I got two accounts in the same bank. I used to have nine digits in your account number
Now it's 15. They had told me yesterday on the phone during my three hours that I spent on the phone on screwing up my account
Now it's 15 digits. You know what that means?
Well, they tell you that that means that used to be just a number now. You're a much smaller number right
Used to be just just another number to us now. You're like a little teeny time
And this is what's happening in the USA boys and girls
This is not just every radio and TV station all by the same couple of companies every goddamn bank every a supermarket
Everything you know everything you buy everything you need is all by the same bunch of grave robbers every pill that you have to take
Everything your whole life is owned by about a half a dozen goddamn companies including those Nazis at Walmart
So that's what you got you've got a bunch of incompetent assholes. You don't really care about you
They put a hold on my check again in my last deposit and it took them about 10 days to finally decide to contact me and let them know that they had bounced the check
I wrote to myself they bounced my federal income tax and deposit
They set off a chain of events. I go to my ATM on Saturday morning here to my nearby next door ATM
I stick my card and area and it goes
Like that it starts laughing at me like
Like that I hear giggling sounds your financial institution declines because you're overdrawn in your account
Well, I'm overdrawn in my account because they put a hold on my guy then deposit
So I can't get any cash out of the ATM over the weekend. They've screwed up my whole goddamn life
So I had a real pleasant July 4th holiday weekend and about three plus and hours on a phone yesterday talking to a bunch of
Inbasils morons
Oh, but if you call our one eight hundred number they can handle it see the reason she was dumping me off to call
1 800 number with somebody who's probably in Polkipsi or somewhere who doesn't have any ID who I am is because I find out later
That she this bitch over there. She had a line of people at her desk with the same complaints that I was making
She's just trying to get me off the phone
So all I want to say is watch over yourself. Okay, because if you're with first union
Walk Kovia Bankman you got real tourists if it hasn't happened yet. It will
It will
Just a matter of time not a question of if it's a question of when
Because they're incompetent and they don't give a crap they they could care less
Do we have any confirmation on the Catherine Harris story? No, yeah, because I checked the Miss Fudge report. It's not on there
We have no cable here currently. Oh, geez. I'm gonna get on CNN right now. Isn't that a pretty sad commentary old
Years begins an amazing recovery
Talked out when he said the first time he was able to speak. Oh, okay good. We'll we'll wait with Bated breath
The twins died by the way in case you missed that overnight those
Sign these twins they died. That's my fault
Yeah, cuz George said see you don't want to be like for well now. He's just he goes way over that crap
I hope they all die, you know like this hockey player he dies. That's great. That's great. Yeah
Come on. I wasn't hoping that they would die. I was getting off my career. Yes
There are Iranians you hate the Iranians. You always have I never met one you put a hex on those two young women
I can fast this is the story that pissed me off so bad that I just want to spit blood almost enough to make
me want to come on here in the day that I'm not working almost you know, I said
This fort Lauderdale child molester and suicide case gets 10 years probation
Suspended a sentence basically is what it boils down to
A 35 year old man was sentenced to 10 years of probation yesterday after admitting he molested a boy at least twice about 15 years ago
The victim was not in court yesterday. However, Chris Hamin shot himself to death April 28th
Just days after learning his abuser would like to never go to prison he was 27. He's dead
And this guy gets 10 years probation
Hamin city was molested over a two month period when he was a child by a man he called Uncle Freddie later identified as Frederick
Irreserie the attacks occurred at Irreserie's coconut Creek home. All the victim was in Irreserie's care
When police contacted Irreserie quickly confessed according to police and court records
Criminal charges were filed Irreserie was looking at life in prison for raping the boy
Irreserie was about 20 at the time of the crime. There was a problem. However
The defense raised a question about whether Hamin was 11 or 12 when he was abused
Hamin's age at the time was crucial if he was 11 there's no statute limitations for prosecuting the abuser
But if he was 12 the time limit already had run out
With Hamin's death just weeks past Irreserie on Monday pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted sexual battery of a child 12 years
A roller in addition to a decade of probation
Irreserie has to register as a sexual offender have no contact with any child under 18
Taken past two polygraph test a year and give officials a DNA sample so it can be entered in the database
But no jail time 10 years probation because of a technicality because the kid wasn't 11 he was 12 and now he's dead

So I just read the entire story about the plane crash the light plane that crashed yesterday morning here
Yeah, did you also read the facts? I just sent
Uh no because it didn't come over yet. Okay, and it said
That's just an internet rumor
I'm sorry. I mean, it's just an internet rumor
I see
Well, it must be a little bit more than that because this story is very very lengthy
I mean, I'm who now ever heard of Tom Flacco calm not me
But it doesn't mention anything about the name it just mentions the name of the pilot in this story in a globe and male
It doesn't say anything about who the passengers were so
Certainly as possible and of course if it turns out that it was her and she was on her way to Toronto and Jeb Bush was here for two days
That would sure be interesting wouldn't
Here's a call from for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir
Captain Harris is sitting in the audience and sees Ben right now. Yeah
So she's not dead
She's maybe they got her propped up. No, this is live. They're giving out distinguished uh
What you call it awards, but they keep standing the audience and she's sitting
Way over and far right. So she's alive as well. Are you sure it's not a stunt double?
Thanks for the good news pal
Like I said, thanks for the bad news
So what did I tell you when you sent me this? I said I was very skeptical
But we all know why not go with it
Sure, just in case and then we cross our fingers and hope that maybe it was true
That's a bad thing to say, but I really do uh, I wish I nothing but the worst
bitch
So evidently it's uh another one of those internet rumors like you said and of course this website is a marginal
Invest to the hell over her to bit which is why we can't find any place else because ever to ever deadly
It didn't happen evidently
NBC was called just called the station to tell us it was uh a fake the stories of fake
Okay, well, just don't get so breathless. Okay, but it was very exciting for a couple of men's one that
Yeah, what do you mean NBC just called the station?
Is that just came running in here to tell us that NBC called the studio to tell us that it was a
Might away on you assholes at NBC aren't you embarrassed at MSNBC at a fire Michael Savage after putting them on her in the first place
Isn't that pretty embarrassing?
Yeah, come to the peacock has got its tail between his legs
MSNBC yesterday fired that right-wing fascist Michael Savage for anti-gay comments
The popular radio talk show host who did a weekend tv show for the desperate cable channel
Refer to an unidentified caller to which show Saturday as a sot of might and city should gates and die
His comments were extremely inappropriate and the decision was an easy one MSNBC spokesman Jeremy Gaines said
There was no media comment from Savage according to a spokesman his office in California
The branch talk talking savage is one of radio's hottest jocks. It says here
His Paul reverse society advocates closing borders deporting illegal immigrants mandating health test for immigrants and eliminating entitlement programs
The televised version of the Savage nation began March 8th despite the protest of such innocent groups as the gig and lesbian lines against defamation
Erid at 5 p.m. on Saturday
Savage didn't rent laid into a tv hit
He increased the ratings for the time slot marginally according to MSNBC in other words
They probably went from a 0.1 to a 0.2 or something like that nothing
The incident that resulted in his firing began innocently enough savage was taking viewer phone calls about the airline horror stories
And a male caller began talking about smoking in the bathroom
Half an hour into the flight. I need to suggest that Don and Mike take your something the caller said before he was cut off in his words
became unintelligible
You know what I think your caller said Don and Mike wow blow

Yes another phone caller didn't have a nice light in the bathhouse is angry at me today
These bombs mean nothing to me. He said
Glad spokeswoman Kathy renna said of Savage's firing. It's about time
The latest detect made the clearest case for why Savage has no place on any reputable news network
MSNBC witnessed firsthand exactly the kind of verbal assaults glad in the warning them about for the past five months into their credit
They backed up their promises told him accountable and they fired his right wing ass
As if it makes a difference. I mean he as far as TV was concerned
Didn't even make a blip on a Richter scale and you know who else doesn't make a blip on radio
I can see that Glenn Garvin and the hero does got this big big glowing piece over the weekend about Bill O'Reilly
And about how he's kicking ass on TV. He and he talks about his three million listeners nationwide on radio
You know how many there are in South Florida
Yeah, he doesn't he doesn't even crack a zero. He doesn't make a point one on a radio in South Florida
And since you're writing the column in a heralded in South Florida, Glenn Garvin
You might want to mention it in there, but of course you wouldn't because it's obviously a puff piece
sucking up to the right wing

No cost it has reported but this morning's Toronto star says or somewhere I read that they believe it was a suicide and then he hung himself with a belt.
How many hang yourself with a belt?
Here I'll show you.
Oh.
You put the one in through the loop, right?
But you don't put that little tang through any of the holes and then you get a loop around your neck and you tie it off to a pipe or something and then you jump off the chair.
Oh.
Why Shanko was acquired by the Rangers Mark 12th, the March 12th, 2002 along with Mark Tan Ruchinsky from Dallas stars.
Why Shanko played a final 15 games of that season with the Rangers two more last season.
Yadi Yadi play most of last year with Hartford and the A.H.L.
The Rangers organization is shocked and deeply saddened said President Coach Glenn said they were in a state of an issue today.
He played 138 career NHL games with the stars and Rangers scoring 14 goals and it's just like so many others lately he's dead.
A lot of people die in these days including lots of Americans in Iraq.
I just mentioned that in passing every day.
Every single day there's kids dying.
Good movie.
The Born Identity with Matt Damon speaking about an afflick.
Matt Damon was great in the Born Identity.
You haven't seen it yet?
No, not yet, but I will.
How about Bonehead Boy?
I thought.
And I thought it was good.
I missed like the really first part of it so I was confused almost to the end, but it was still a good movie.
I got news for you.
You're still confused.
But I thought it was very good and he certainly that was his best role.
I would say I mean he was like really they pushed him up and he was he was pretty good.
I'm good.
Look good too.
Nice going Matt.
Bad movie like I said.
Awful movie and you both ought to hang your heads in shame.
I mean for it wasn't bad enough that somebody there gave me a bully.
That was me and kids and gummo and Harpo and Groucho and I crap.
That wasn't bad enough.
But then a beautiful mind.
Oh my god.
What is it that you could possibly like about that movie?
You didn't see it so.
I saw it first 20 minutes.
I would be in a coma right now if I would continue trying to watch that.
Okay.
I mean you talk about slow.
Yeah well.
It was like my life was on 70 RPM and it was like on 33 in a turd.
Yeah whatever.
Slow.
Didn't go anywhere.
Well it did.
Well I didn't have time to wait.
I was in a big hurry.
I'd rather wide up watching which I did see the black cat with the Velagosi and the Boris Carlisle.
I watched that instead.
It was on my screen TV.
That was good.
And you saw it?
Yes I did 100 years ago.
Now here's a movie.
Well guess what else I ordered but you are disappointed me this morning.
I ordered Edward on the VHS which everybody says is great because it's not out in DVD yet.
I don't want to wait.
Another order from Amazon.com.
You see when you do me right I'll talk you up from now till the end of time.
When you screw me over like first you knew how Kobe a bank.
I'll rip you an ass because you deserve it because you suck.
You suck.
They should only rot at first union while Kobe a bank.
Oh well our policy is this and our policy is it?
Yeah.
They don't even know what that their policy is.
They couldn't get it straight if you had a guy named Gun of their head.
Oops.
But anyway.
Urban legend with the lovely what's his name?
Jared Lido.
I ordered that and you said it is okay.
It's a yeah teen slaughter.
Logan.
I saw the preview of it on one of these screen TV.
One of my numbers that you don't get.
And it looked pretty good.
I mean if you like that kind of thing I mean that's okay.
I like that kind of thing.
All right.
Instead of the review I read said it wasn't as good as scream but it was then close.
Scream was good.
It was a hoot.
Sure.
Now here's the movie especially for all our whole is all the 30 we got listed out there that you will really enjoy.
And I think everybody else will too.
Now maybe this is the movie that they keep crawling on and I don't think it was Mexican though.
It seemed to me like it was a film didn't have spaniards.
That's not the one they keep calling about the one you see.
Oh.
It's from the year 2000 kisses for everyone.
I've seen it before but last night I saw it in centenary.
No.
In spongebob with English subtitles.
And I'm not sure some of the words that might come up here what I recorded from it but that's okay.
The other thing don't speak spinoff.
But that's right.
It's from trance.
Notico.
But for this you know they might learn it.
He must have separated the halloween.
The prelude of the movie.
Yeah.
Oh he must have been watching a beautiful mind.
Oh sorry.
Can I have a look?
That part later.
That was him.
Now we're going to show you the resistance that they block the positive thinking.
Where did you get the money from?
Anyway there was a lot of sex, a real and imaginary and a lot of young people and a bunch of sloppy hookers.
It was just a really cute fun movie.
It was nice.
Sloppy hookers.
Yeah.
You're kind of movie.
It's okay.
Kisses for everyone in esponial with English subtitles.
I'm just recommending I enjoyed it a lot.
I liked it.
You didn't like it?
Well that's where you haven't even seen it.
How do you know it's bad?
How do you want to hear right now in a sitting position?
Now guarantee it's better in a beautiful mind.
Okay.
I'll check it out.
That was so freaking boring.
Here's Coral Gables.
Hello.
Oh Coral Gables.
He's in there.
Sure gets around.
But you sound like you're far away today sir.
You sound like you're fading off into the distance.
Like your life.
Retire.
Too much energy.
It might be your last asshole.
How is the pool coming?

A lot of people would like, oh those two twins by the way they died.
My fault.
Well you put a hex on them.
Everything was going along so well.
And they were you know, breathlessly on all the news channels even up here.
They were telling us every every incision, every thing that they were doing.
And then I get up this morning, oh they died.
See it's their fault for inflicting it on me so much.
What's the next big story because they died?

Thanks a lot Miss Budges and Beautiful thing.
Huge headline story right above the big gap hearts.
Thank you.
That's how we're going to talk.
That's a good thing.
And it's full of hope.
Yeah, the chain is not a heart that's old.
And it's gone above.
He'll keep on working till as hard as cold.
He'll keep pretending that his heart ain't old.
But it's really old.
Oh, well, we made the big time.
We made the Fudge report.
Good morning to Miss Fudge out there.
I know you're listening on the beach.
She loves me.
She's obsessed with me in this program.
You do realize that, don't you?
Yes, I do this.
Anyway, here right above the above the headline,
I mean, the big story.
Mine is top rated local talk host, Neil Rogers.
WQAM 560-AM spelled correctly.
Thanks, Miss Fudge.
Fueled an online lampoon yesterday, today, Tuesday.
I better put my glasses on so I can read it, OK?
Well, it's, you know, a couple of inches away.
Tuesday, that Congresswoman Catherine Harris died in a plane crash yesterday
while in the clandestine rendezvous with Florida Governor Jeb Bush in Canada.
Catherine Harris is dead reported by me, legend Rogers.
I've got the new story right here.
It's on the internet, a plane crash.
Representative Harris, who rose to national attention during Florida's
2000 election, recount appeared live on a House Farm Washington,
as Rogers was detailing a repaired death rate posting found online.
How do you like that pitch?
She gets around, you know what?
My God, she's all over the goddamn place.
Nice going, Miss Fudge.
Thank you.
And, you know, let me just say this, if Fox News can go to court
to get a ruling that says, oh, you can just make stuff up and put it on here.
It doesn't have to be true.
That's right.
Then we can do it too, OK?
Even though we were conned in by somebody said it's the facts.
That's OK.
We were skeptical enough, don't you think?
Yeah.
We said as much.
Nothing.
He would say that.
He would say that.
He would say that.
He would say that.
But nevertheless, I made for some of Son of God, a son of God,
the Mfudge report in the middle of the summertime, in the middle of the Adog days of summer.
So, whoever sent us that original facts, thank you very much for the misinformation.
Here's the facts.
It says, I love this fact.
It's short, right to the point.
It said, Barnaby Jones had one of the best theme songs, but the show itself was boring.
When I was a kid, I would just watch the opening credits and then change the channel.
Good thinking, yeah, me too.
I love that, man.
When we did those shows on TV things, I kept trying to pedal this and convince you people this was the best.
It is.
It's the best.
That is the best.
Am I right?
I like it a lot.
I'm not asking you.
I was asking our buddy.
Absolutely.
He'll be back Thursday morning, by the way, those of you who've missed the moment.
The Mole Meister.
Let's see, how about Neve Campbell for your poll?
It seems that every movie role I see her in, she's sucking face with some other chick.
Maybe she keeps picking those roles for a reason, just like maybe Moe keeps picking his butt for a reason.
No, honorable mention.
Cameron Diaz, just a hunch, or even the two together, I'd go see that movie.
It says, I don't think either one of them is a dyke.
Do you?
No.
Okay.
Well, I mean, we could put it on here, but I don't think so.
Because we got a whole bunch of other good ones.
Jodie Foster, how can we leave Jodie off of there?
Because she's well, not now.
No, she's not out.
She's not out.
All right.
Just because you have very heavy, heavy suspicion.
Huh?
Okay.
She's not out.
Okay. I know she's not out.
Now Betty White.
I mean, Betty White, I believe, but I mean, nobody knows who Betty White is anymore.
Okay. Only us all for it.
So that would be a good one, but I'm not putting it on there, right?
Elizabeth Taylor is ridiculous.
How many times she been married?
About third, man.
Come on, this week.
Elizabeth Taylor, just because of her fondness for Michael Jackson, she's a fag-hag.
Okay. That doesn't make her a dyke.
In fact, most fag-hags that I've encountered in my life are not dykes.
Amazing enough.
I don't know. Maybe they're just afraid of a penis.
I don't know what their deal is.
I don't know. I've got somebody.
Jody Foster.
When you stop picking on my friends, Jody Foster is going to go on the list.
You got to know who's keeping track of this.
We all are. She's on there.
We all are.
Because I don't want to push Venerable because he's obviously had a rough start to win today today.
Anything you'd like to tell us about?
Wendy's great.
I beg your pardon?
Randy Moulthashe is great.
That had nothing to do with this morning.
I just had it said that on the air.
Well, we know that.
Randy Moulthashe is great.
He helps all of my friends and me and everybody else.
If you get a ticket, if you get some kind of a traffic problem, if you're irresponsible like Venerable,
call Randy Moulthashe to take a defense team.
He's the best in the world.
Love your Randy.
Save my ass.
Yeah. Believe me, it's going to take a lot more than him to save your ass.
Jody Foster, Jackie Johnson, I don't think so.
I think Jackie buried.
But well, that proves it to me.
But I don't, I mean, she's just Janet Jackson.
Now we're starting to get a little more of the meat of the matter.
Get Janet on there.
And Liza Manelli, see again, confusing.
She's a fag hag.
She's not a dike.
She's a fag hag.
Just like her mother was.
OK, it runs into family.
Judy Garland, Liza Manelli, Liz Taylor.
They're fag hags.
Don't you get it?
No.
Don't you understand it?
No.
It's got to do with no fag hag from a glory hole.
People are so out of touch, you know?
Seriously, straight people.
Some of you are pretty nice.
No.
But you're so out of touch with faggery and practice.
You're out of touch with life.
Oh, fag.
Flory holes are just for fags.
I know that.
Get to.
Well, if you were a little bit more creative,
if you were one of those unisexed pearls,
just imagine what you could be doing in there.
Anyway, how about Angelina Jolie?
If there's Trisha, she looks gay.
Angelina Jolie, have you ever heard that?
I know a lot of lesbian women really wish she was.
Yeah.
She's very popular with women.
Well, now we're not asking who would you like to be gay.
That's not the poor question today.
Who do you think is most probable?
OK, not fantasy.
Not who would you like to take a tumble with, but, huh?
That would be like my saying.
I think Ethan Hawke is gay.
It's just ridiculous.
You know what I'm talking about?
Swishful thinking.
Urban legend.
So you didn't like that.
I'm just wondering.
No, I like the point.
I like the movie.
I'm just dreaming everything.
I just didn't know that I didn't think that you were a lot.
At least in this movie I got farmed all the way through.
So is somebody going to call us about their kisses for everyone movie?
That was really cute.
You know what I'm saying?
No.
I mean, it's not in the league with a lot of these other heavy, heavy movies we've talked about.
But it was cute.
It was in Georgia.
You'd like it.
I'll watch it.
And by the way, we heard the rumor.
A little birdie told me speaking of that that Miguel was in there on Friday.
Saying that at the end of the show.
Yesterday was it.
Saying he didn't like a record in Purdue.
I guess you didn't read the company memo.
That we don't allow more than two sticks on the air at the same time.
Just keep it more important to I say.
Here's Pembroke Park.
Hello.
Well, see Miguel didn't like that movie because there was nothing about cast or when it yes sir.
The Gourney Weaver.
Is it Dike?
Of course.
How about Charlie Weaver?
Uh, I think I played with Cloud.
Yeah.
Yeah, him and D.
The thing is, yeah.
Okay, we'll put around here and make you happy.
And he puts the Gourney Weaver on there.
Okay, she's alien to me.
5 6 7 0 5 60.
We can build a nationalist here.
How's it going so far?
Hillary.
Yeah.
And look at the number on here.
Hillary's got 69 votes.
I wonder if there's a message there.
And nobody making cracks about, you know,
Janorino and sister Jean and stuff like that.
Hillary Clinton 69.
Jimi Lee Curtis 25 and a corner.
48.
See, I told you.
I bet you one of those was Pavelle Berryville.
I only wish.
Isn't there two ends in Anna?
Mariah Carey.
Uh, what difference does that make?
Uh, we'll just take up more space.
He's got a long last.
They don't be picking on the poor Eric.
Okay.
He's under such incredible stress now.
Because he knows that sooner or later,
Bina Boy is going to screw up and he's going to have to do all this stuff on our website.
We got a whole bunch of great bedtime stories on our website today, including, uh,
Captain Harris croaked.
I heard Matt Dredd was flying the plane.
I heard Miss Fudge was flying.
Not with a plane.
You're right.
Here.
See anything we do on this show will be on there immediately because he listens religiously.
He just obsessed with this show.
In fact, he's probably on the phone right now with my good friend Lynn Sammels.
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
You know, I have it a good time.
That's, that's okay.
That's okay.
Lynn just can't help herself.
You know, she's, uh, one of those I was talking about.
Mariah Carey 7, Britney Spears 6 and J.L.O. 6.
Well, Britney's got 6.
Now, that's either 6 people who are thinking about Justin Tinkerbell and about all these, uh, you know,
uh, bye, bye, bye.
That's stuff because I'm thinking about it.
Have you ever seen her where the guy to look good?
No.
No.
No.
I was searching, I was searching.
No, seriously, after she dumped Justin allegedly because this is all tabloid created bullcrap.
I mean, don't believe any of these things you read or hear.
It's just all manufactured like Leo and all those Ordies Leo's who have a little hot paint.
Right.
Bullcrap.
And Ricky Martin knows hot chicks.
Yeah.
I think the hot chicks he had where it Kentucky fried and repeated people ate too happy about it.
He was just here recently, Ricky Martin and they all said who he was here in Toronto.
I had a lot of losers here lately, Jeb Bush.
He was having a client, Justin meetings with somebody, but we don't know if he's here.
I'm not going to say you.
He's scientific.
The best thing to do in those studios.
Say I can drop it and I'll do the show today.
That's a really cute movie.
Are you out of see it?
I will see it.
A little bit on the lighter side.
I mean, it's got like a very poignant, it's got some poignant ending and it's said when so on.
But, excuse.
Here's a call from Boca.
Hello.
Missy Elliott.
She's around more sick.
That's him again.
Mm-hmm.
See now today he's from Boca, but he's not lying now.
Why don't you try calling out another line, asshole.
Okay.
So I don't know before even punch up the call it.
It's you.
Or what did you try this?
Yeah.
Try that.

Thanks, Bubba.

Seven years in my butt.
A penetrating biography.
What did I just want to be loved? Is that so wrong?
Coming to a theater near you.
Is that for real? There are any inter-harvey firesteen?
Never seen the two of them together, have you?
That's true.
Love it 20 at 560. Nobody can...
How come Miss Grudge didn't put on there that...
Well, there are a whole bunch of things you could have put on there.
Just sticks that on there.
You could have put a whole bunch of other headlines about this show.
He ought to have the QM lineup on his website.
How come we don't have a link on his website?
Come on, Miss Grudge. We want a link.
You asshole.
In fact, oh, speaking of people in the closet.
What about that Mark Foley, huh?
You ass representative Mark Foley asked organizers of a nudist summer camp for children to strengthen their background checks of employees yesterday.
After meeting with leaders of nudist organizations who were defending the camp.
Yeah, this is Mark Foley's big thing now is the teenage nudist in the camp.
Nudist camp.
That's his big cause, Celeb.
Come out of the closet, Mark.
It's long overdue. You know what I'm saying?
Got it?
A coalition of groups representing recreational nudists asked to meet with Foley,
appealing them to respect the privacy of the families who choose to send their children to the camp.
Of course, the people at Foley, you know, can sort this with...
They like to send all of us to camp, a different kind.
Foley called attention to the camp last month when he asked Governor Jeff Bush to investigate whether the summer program was illegal.
Bush's staff... Did you hear about Katherine here, Spineway?
No, what?
Bush's staff, she's still alive.
Bush's staff responded.
They found no education of illegal activity, but that they would check to see if any complaints have been filed.
The week-long summer camp run by the American Association for Nude Recreation outside of Tampa allows kids 11 to 18 to get together for game sports and discussions about their choice to stay in the buff.
I want to make sure that they're properly regulated, properly secure, and they're not going to have kids come in contact with undesirable said Foley,
a West Palm Beach closet queen Republican who's running for U.S. Senate.
Nude is too met with Foley, say they wanted him to stop harassing the camp now that state official said it was legal.
It's a fundamental freedom in this country that makes such personal choices, surely mason executive director of beaches foundations,
through the group that supports clothing free beaches set in a statement.
Hey, I got this for you, Mark Foley. If you want to start investigating something, I was thinking it was a little bit deeper into the Catholic Church, the pre-scandal,
since we've only scratched the tip of the iceberg.
If you want to find some real trial molesters, some real pedophiles.
Anyway, speaking of Ms. Fudge, let's see, here's the fact that says, what is a fag hang I really want to know.
And they're serious, obviously.
Yeah, they are. What is a fag hang? Well, a fag hang is a female, a heterosexual woman who for some reason has an affinity,
an obsession for hanging out with male homosexuals. You got it right.
First, as an Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson, as in Brook Shields and Michael Jackson, and is in Liza Mnellie and Judy Garland,
from any gay man, and that kind of thing. As in my friend Lynn Samuels and Ms. Fudge, and the list is long. That's what a fag hang is.
I don't know where that expression came from. I don't know, but they run. Fag hang.
I read it in a mag. Dad, you should have to be an old mag.
Here's one that says, I need to share with you what is probably a classic Rush Limbaugh experience.
Since moving to New Jersey, I continue to listen to show work by the way. Thank God.
Thursday, work let out early for the holiday. And the car was slipping through the stations up here, came across Rush,
ranting and raving about what is supposedly the new meaning of the words American and patriotism.
He was angered by the fact that some people are claiming that the qualifies an American or patriot, one must speak out against the US government and government policy.
As support for his spiel, he played the off-heared Senator Hillary Clinton speech, professing that being an American means having the right to be free to speak out.
Of course, he wasn't advocating that to be American, one must exercise this right.
Never less since his speech was probably already discredited merely because it came across as Schrolin screeching weeks ago.
It was logical to Rush that it could be substantively discredited as well.
As his show as an opinion based, it's his right and his listeners right to disagree with the viewers.
However, he totally misinterpreted what he said. And once he says it, it becomes gospel on his show and blindly followed by his listeners right.
As Rush spoke, I found myself sitting in my car shouting, no, no, at the radio knowing that as followers were not going to get it.
If his listeners understood his show to be sat there a comedy, I'd read easier.

America's top spy catcher Paul Redmond has suddenly resigned in the middle of his secret investigation into how Sodom Hussein and Osama bin Laden allegedly obtained US computer software the Sunday Express claimed this weekend The software said it was able to two most wanted men in the world to avoid capture because it can pinpoint every move in the global manhunt Redmond's departure last week was accepted without discussion by President Bush the man who had brought this spy catcher out of retirement to conduct the investigation
Are you ready for that? Yeah, I'm soaking it.
Hours after Redmond and cleared his desk Bush ordered a GBP 25 million dollar bounty on Sodom's head.
He wants Sodom dead and alive and the same goes for bin Laden already Bush has agreed to either man for going to trial and being shot after interrogation.
The official reason given for Redmond's abrupt departure was health reasons but stunned colleagues in the Homeland Security Department of Washington where Redmond had his office insist the former associate director of the CIA was in perfect health is the part of his lead to intense speculation that he may have begun to uncover embarrassing details about the software came into the hands of Sodom and bin Laden.
Let me read that first sentence again America's top spy catcher Paul Redmond has suddenly resigned in the middle of his secret investigation into how Sodom and Osama allegedly obtained US computer software.
Which is said to enable the two most wanted men in the world to avoid capture because it can pinpoint every move in the global manhunt.
It kind of like a scene from a born identity where they were like pinpointing I mean it's a pretty neat movie I think you can enjoy it.
It's on the list where they can watch every street in the world they can bring it up on a computer and they can see who's on a street and they can zero in and they can zoom in your toilet and into your into your it's amazing.
Pretty damn good stuff and of course probably that's the way of the wind anyway it's probably coming if you ask me.
Uh huh.
In fact I want to sworn I saw Jim Bush and my balcony about a half an hour ago bitching me out about that Catherine Harris story.
Too bad, Jeb. Too bad it's not true. Wouldn't that have been a scandal huh?
Oh yeah. Wouldn't that have been something.
So whoever created that phony story and then that nice job because he put all the pieces together very nicely.
What do you hear what I'm hearing?
What are you hearing?
Well maybe that's outside I don't know maybe they're like drilling or whirling I hear like so because everything is so nice and quiet you know.
Beautiful day by the way it's 80 it's going to be like it's going to be 80 it's going to be more than that but it's beautiful sunny not a cloud in the sky.
I just mentioned that in passing.
How's the weather in South Florida be no boy.
Actually this is the first day in like 20 that has a rate.
All right. Not even noon yet. Okay. It's not even noon. It's not time yet for those big cumulus clouds to start forming over the everglades and then sweeping across the state.
Here's a call from this is amazing in it. It's not even noon yet. We've already got our second lady of the day in Boyton Beach. Hello.
Hi there. How are you?
Good. I'm cool. God. How are you?
Pretty good.
Good. Kind of couple for you but these might be obvious.
I don't even know what a bag had yet. So.
Oh yeah. That's true.
You're so happy. You missed that even if you didn't know the name. Right.
You know. Why do you have to explain that anyway. Helen Hunt of course. Right.
Helen Hunt. Sure.
Absolutely. Okay. Her ex-beard tank. The area.
You know Linda Evans and Yankee Yani. Right.
Linda Evans is it Dyke?
Yeah. Absolutely.
Come on.
Absolutely. Inside info.
Okay.
How about you over here.
Plant it out or get those on your on your on your from their website.
Okay. Well my. My died sister.
Forging to me. My Tyson hates his mom.
My mom left him hates women. My person is a Dyke.
Little.
I'd be and Janet Jackson might be a bag. I don't know.
Have you ever seen Janet Michael together? Well how can we have him put Janet Jackson on the list here yet? Have we?
Oh yeah. She's got five votes already. Janet excuse my.
Yeah. But she might be Michael. I don't know.
We can't say man. We can't. No we've already done that a million times.
We even said if you want to but we've done that you know been there and done that.
All right. Anybody we might not suspect.
I don't know. I think Helen Hunt pretty obvious if you know but that might be a revelation to some people.
Maybe Miss Fudge will be put it on her website.
I think I might right next to Catherine Harris have a great taste. We don't.
I hate what Kovia enjoy your vacation. Oh you said the right things. Thanks.
Bye.
What Kovia bank blows okay in case anybody has no if you're thinking about opening into a account software to do not go.
The first you need to walk Kovia okay under penalty of death they suck they will terrorize you they'll destroy your day.
Your week your life and certainly your holiday weekend. God.
How do you like to be a big shot like me and make the kind of money that I'm well see I because you're going to see it.
Okay. But let me just finish and go to your ATM not not that I would brand short of cash thank goodness because I you know me I'm like a walk in bank.
I got a few hundred American I got a few hundred euros so in my sack I've already got some spirit that I could always get it to change place.
But the point being you go to your ATM it's like a routine with me you know when you get the best exchange rate by getting it out of the ATM.
You stick your card in there and it goes.
And you hear like the little man inside the machine like who are you kid man you're your financial institution says you ought to be institutionalized because you don't have no cash.
Well let me tell you it's worse when you're not a big shot when you still have a lot of money when you don't have a big mattress full of money to fall back on or a wall it was.
That's even worse that's right and you're very very careful to make sure that you don't make any mistakes and still.
And which that is good.
And you know something I haven't I haven't had anybody call in today recommend me a bank which I was hoping would happen.
I would give me some some friendly personal service and not keep putting a hold on my deposit.
Well I didn't want to be a tool that's for sure they suck yes hard.
Oh god and of course like I said the people are working banks I used to think well you know the Tom Jones he's a he's a bank vice president.
Everybody's a bank vice president means they're making about 15 grand a year is what that means.
It's an ice title but it means they're a flunky.
Oh do I miss those days of friendly family bank and Matt Korshaw for my good friends I knew everybody in there they knew me there was never a chance that they were going to screw up my account ever not a chance.
With these people if they get it right it's a freaking miracle you kiss the ground you start rubbing your rosary beads you rub it real hard.
If they ever get your guy then deposit right at first union what Colby you man they suck.
You people make me sick I should sue their ass you know just for the stress factor.
Okay is not a guy that I'm showing Fox the stress factor class action yeah let's all sue their ass and evidently I wasn't the only one because the long July 4th holiday weekend you know they had extra opportunity to screw up people's accounts when they were desperately hoping to get some cash.
Oh well it's in our policy if you need to find print it out they send in these little brochures that everybody Schmidt cans and throws in a waste basket.
You know a little message from your bank you know from first union and the print is so small you couldn't meet with a magnifying glass and you Schmidt can't even throw it away you see it's nothing.
And in there maybe maybe they said well our new policy is you know if we don't like the way you look or it's not the right there we're too busy we can't be bothered not putting a hold on your deposit.
Even if you're the biggest deposit in our bank let me say it again you people suck you make me nauseous don't do it again okay do not do it again.
Now I got another new deal is every time I make a deposit I gotta send John in or the bank if I'm not in town which is most of the time I gotta send somebody in there with the deposit handed to this broad who's sitting at the desk.
And she scribbles a little thing on there like you know like a little like a hex.
She put some kind of Jamaican hex on me when and then she sends him back to the guy then yeah that's it to the teller teller what tellers that she's full of crap.
18 till noon at 560 WQM for the next two weeks it's a special holiday deal let's see for the next week we did last week from our friends at balance for life it's the best you live ever offered.

Or whose meaning has been changed through censorship.
Good point Mike and Cooper City.
Don't buy your DVDs at the blackbuster whatever you do.
At Schlockbuster they suck.

Hello.
Hi Neil.

Good happy summer to you.
And back to you.
I have one to add to the list kind of older but Barbara Walters.
Barbara Walters you think is a dike?
Well doesn't everybody know?
I'll be honest with you.
I never thought of her in any kind of a sexual way.
She looks to me like her.
Well me either.
But she's just been around forever and I've always wondered about her a little bit.
She always seems like want to interview the women a little too close or something.
I don't know what it is.
Yeah and of course she's on that view show and then she start that show.
Yeah I think that's all lesbian's actually but I don't want to you know I don't know their names.
So I don't want to.

That would be a better name for it.
You should have your own TV show.

Okay so I have a facial rating on I know.
I'm saying it's on Friday's from 10 to 10.
Right.
Also that poll you do the other day about the best, well the actor you would not go see in a movie.
How about a poll for what movie you would go see just because an actor is in it or an actress?
Well that's a good idea for Thursday.
Who would draw you to a movie?
That's an excellent idea for Thursday like I said.
Personally if you were going to go see a movie just because of an actor who would it be?
Oh.
That's very tough.
I don't know.
I may be mad Damon now.
Yeah.

Right.
314 votes on our dyke pool.
Which of these female celebrities you most strongly believe is a dyke.
Hillary Clinton 145.
Hillary's in a leak of her own man.
She's way way out there in front and nobody's gonna catch her ugly ass.
So he falls to those given her a run.
She's got 73 and notice how Jody passes to everybody else like they were standing still.
Well, it's our fault.
Well, it's probably a good thing we didn't put her on right in the beginning.
She'd be right on Hillary's ass.
Jamie, the Curtis 36.
Do you know that she's Tony Curtis's daughter?
You do know that yes, I did Bernie Schwartz.
You know what he likes.
Mariah Carey's got 12 and a corner.
Holy 11 J. L. O nine.
Sigourney Weaver nine.
Britney Spears got eight.
I can't tell you by whom.
Janet Jackson eight and a cool Kevin's got a pair.
Probably bigger than Tom Cruises.
Anyway, this story about Jeb Bush and Ernie Eves.
If you only knew what a schmuck Ernie Eves was,
you'd realize this is a match made in purgatory.
A match made in moustache.
God, what a couple of assholes.
So here's this big glowing picture.
They're both smiling and laughing.
Jeb Bush up here.
Thank God he's out of here today.
Bye bye, Jeb.
Have a safe trip home, you asshole.
And the story says the headline.
The headlines says Canada and US so close.
They look alike.
Jeb Bush says the striking similarities between Canada and the US overshadow.
Any disagreements between the governments of the two countries?
Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, said yesterday.
In fact, there was little to identify Canada as a foreign country
to visiting Americans, Mr. Bush said,
on his first trade and tourism promotion mission to Canada.
This paragraph here ended in Toronto.
It didn't have to go through customs.
I wouldn't know I was in a foreign country, said Mr. Bush.
The brother of US President George W. Bush.
Many Canadians have the same feeling if they flew into one of our cities.
I told you this story a long time ago about how when I was a little kid in the first time.
I had the schlepped over to Niagara Falls.
And crossed over from Niagara Falls to New York and Niagara Falls to Ontario.
And once we crossed the border and went into Canada, I kept wondering,
where is all the snow?
Of course it was the middle of the summertime, right, and him.
And I was like a little tiny kid.
Where is all the snow?
Many Canadians have the same feelings if they flew into one of our cities.
Hey, look at that. There are some big buildings and there are some cars.
There are some roads and there is a store and there are other McDonald's.
What an asshole man.
And then there is a whole big spread on this story.
Toronto versus Miami.
Now see, they narrow it down.
Miami meaning date county to the Toronto city as opposed to the GTA,
the metro population, because Metro Toronto is five million people.
But anyway, date county they got 2 million, 312,000.
Toronto, 2 million, 480,000.
So they are trying to make a similarity there.
His spandid population, Miami 57.3%, Toronto 9.3%.
Black population, Miami 19%, Toronto just 8.3%.
All right.
Fullyage, Miami palm trees, Toronto fur trees, architectural flourish,
Miami art deco, Toronto pool and the condo.
Typical TV character, Miami sunny crocket and Miami vice,
Toronto Joey Jeremiah and the grassy junior high.
Recreational drug, Miami cocaine, Toronto Starbucks.
Election debacle, Miami hanging chads, Toronto running drag queens.
Most common form of transportation, Toronto TTC,
that's a subway, Miami roller blades.
Most famous Latino visitor, Toronto Ricky Martin,
Miami, L.N. Gonzalez.
Waterfront creatures most threatened by urban development,
Toronto tent city residents, Miami manatees.
Tala's building, here's one that made my blood boil when I saw it.
Do you know what the Tala's building and Miami is, being her boy?
I thought it was that one that looked like a staircase.
It's the Wacovia financial center, 55 stories.
I got some stories for the people of Wacovia, more than 55.
At least just this weekend.
Lots of stories, 55 stories, Toronto the CN Tower, 181 stories.
Of course, these days you don't want to have too many big buildings.
Gay rights, Toronto marriages been legalized.
Miami is illegal for a man who are any kind of strapless gown.
And it goes on.
Pretty interesting stuff because you know, he landed at the airport
if they wouldn't have put him through customs and said,
boy, there's that asshole going over Florida.
He would have thought he was like anywhere in the U.S.
Like Toledo.
For a dike list, here's one that says,
how about King, oh, Queen Latifa?
Queen Latifa says, I honestly think her package is bigger than mine.
Well, I'm sure it's bigger than mine, which ain't so much.
Queen Latifa, let's get that big nasty bitch on there right away.
Did we ever get Whitney Houston on there?
Did we, yeah, she don't have any votes yet.
Oh, look at that. There's a whole bunch of them that just went on there.
Look at that. That's excellent.
Nice going, Eric.
Although a little bit slow, that's Venerable's fault.
I'm sure.
Well, that's because Venerable is busy putting all those bedtime stories on there, right?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, because he showed up about a minute to 10 today.
Not late, not late, but a minute to 10 because he had issues.
You know, this is a man's always got issues.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Ever since parents attacked him last week in a hallway, he's just never been a same again.
Here's Carl Gables. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Woody Graber. How you doing?
No, Woody Graber again. Jesus, what are you becoming like chronic?
Well, you were talking about banks, and I got to tell you about my bank.
Like I said, it's your great year from Woody Graber today.
It's exceptional.
Melon United National Bank.
Smellin'?
Yeah, one of the managers I deal with is a big nealy.
Oh, thank God. But where the hell am I going to find one of those by me? I'm not.
They're embrowered and then Dave, I know.
I mean, they're national. They're around the country.
Really?
Yeah. But they could probably set up anything you want because your check comes from there, right?
Right.
From down here.
So they can help you set it up.
I'll be glad to give you a name and number off the air, if you want.
You have no idea how great that would be.
The minute that I set my foot back on Florida, Soil in a few weeks,
that's the first thing I'm going to do is switch banks.
I got to tell you, Melon has been over backwards for me.
They have been so wonderful. I mean, you know, I'm just a poor schlepper off the street, but they have...
No, no, wait. Let me ask you this. That melon bank.
That's not connected with the Pittsburgh family.
Like Richard Melon's, Skafe, and would that outfit, is it?
I don't know quite honestly.
Because I have a feeling if I put my money in that bank, it might like vanish overnight.
You know, they might make an accident.
There's that tag that left wing pinko off bag.
They might not like me too much.
No, these guys are great. They're just wonderful.
And I got to tell you, like I said, one of the branch managers Greg that I deal with,
he just like, he says, why? I heard you had Neil the other day, you know?
Really?
He's a big meal fan.
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll put you on holdin' Beenerboy can take his name and the info,
and that would be great. I'd really appreciate it.
Because I like to find a bank where they give me a little bit of service.
Just a look. I'm not asking for a lot. Just don't put a holdin' scrub
might deposits. That's all.
They would never scrub your deposits. They'd never scrub one of mine.
Excellent.
Yeah, definitely.
Okay, hang on Woody and thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
All right, no problem. Take care.
Okay, take care of my good close personal friend Woody Graber online, one of the Rebeenerboy.
Like I said, I'm always glad to hear from Woody.
You know what I said when I heard his voice?
All the time.
Yeah.
By the way, guess who I heard yesterday on the racing channel?
I guess I could hear him any day. My good friend Phil Saltsman?
How's he doing?
He's doing good.
Callin' the races from Calder Race Course.

There's a bit called what fell.
And the name of the movie was now.
Oh, no, no.
I couldn't understand.
He was, he was talking in some of the language.
I don't know.
He was speaking in a Greek.
So we, I guess we'll have to play that right, fell.
We ought to.
Not in here.
Oh, come on.
Not in here.
After I put 80 billion bits into this DCS over the weekend.
It's not in here.
You know what?
That might even be a rock comedy.
Yeah.

Anyway, we don't got it.

A thousand mediocre movies.
Not too many good ones.
She's not good.
She's not good.
No.
Didn't you like what you, Dr. Electric?
No.
I think affected Southern voice.
Right.
Exactly.
She was awful.
Which is probably one of the day.
Said it was money, but there may have been somebody that said,
you know what?
Why bring that bitch back anyway?
Dr. Electric.
Dr. Electric.
She was awful.
No wonder they wanted to kill that slut.
In fact, that was the one part of the movie when I was definitely rooting for him.
Clarice.
Clarice.
Clarice.
12, 14 at 5, 60 WQAM.
As we went our way up to the Big Marlin Cup game, we got the,

Remember the paint the balls spot.
They wanted this guy waxed it.
Will it sky?
No.
I never see what it's got because I don't want to show who the hell was it with some actor with a really,
just shiny.
Like, uh, man, you could see the reflection around million mind.
He could have been like a lighthouse.
And that's what happens to a lot of guys, but I'm curious.
The guys like professional people who are like actors and things like that.
Do they like shine it?
Do they wax it?
There's a special wax.

Mrs. Mayor of Meridian, he's joining us now on the phone, Mr. Mayor.
Sorry to have to report this horrible story.
Tell us what you know about the specific details.
This morning, sometime before 10, on a pre-arrived at the scene.
And, oh, this is not confirming exact numbers, but we have multiple deaf, multiple injuries.
The scene has been secure for some time now.
We've been on the scene for about an hour.
The employees are in the facility and are being ministered to a team of clergy that's assembled here on the site.
We're family members that are coming out and being assembled across the highway, where they're also being seen to by members of the clergy.
Obviously, an unspeakable tragedy here on town.
Any word, Mr. Mayor, on a possible motive?
No word at this point.
Do you know the identity of the shooter?
The identity of the shooter is known.
We're not releasing that at this time.
And we're-
He killed himself by the way now to notify affected family members first before.
There he goes, shooting at a plant in Meridian, Mississippi, in a gunman kivshot himself.
And there's more dead people in America with guns.
So anyway.
Yes.
Where'd you find that bit?
Hey, listen, I got my crap together here.
I understand.
It's on the best in the- in the old 1995.
The one we don't have here.
Well, the one I got in my hand right now.
I got it.
I played it.
Fell rhymes with Nell and smell and Pell Mel.
Smokin if you got him.
So anyway, here's- thanks very much for tipping me off on it.
Where's that stand again on the murders in 2001?
City of Miami and the City of Toronto, not the metro areas, but-
Or no, actually, Dade County.
But the same population.
Two points, we made in 2.480.
In fact, Toronto is higher.
Murders in 2001, Miami, 204, Toronto, 59.
Got that?
Got it.
Sounds like a little more than four to one to me.
Let me just give you one reason why there's more people getting murdered in Miami than in Toronto.
That's it.
You've got the answer.
What is more people getting murdered in Detroit than Ottawa?
Yeah.
Here's the fact this is great Matt Damon movie, Rounders about Highstakes poker.
With John Malkovich, John Tuturo, Martin Landau, Edward Norton and Gretchen Mall.
You seen Rounders?
Nope.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Like Matt Damon alive.
Oh, yeah.
You like Matt Damon alive.
Yeah.
Well, I do.
He's good.
And he can act pretty good too.
What's the other movie I saw this weekend that I haven't seen in the 17 years that you liked a lot?
War of the Worlds from 1953?
Oh, yeah.
Actually, it was on one of my, you know, driving movie channel or whatever Cornball.
And it was on there again.
They shot that picture.
What a-
Yeah.
The preacher walks up and he's got the-
The Bible and he's got the cross in it.
But it'd be-
But it would be the shadow of the shadows.
That's the thing.
He's a zapper man.
What the hell?
That was in him.
Won't see him, no, Mal.
Here's one that says, put Miss Elliott on your list.
She's been with more chicks than a mother bird.
Says Chuck and Miami.
Who knows Miss Elliott?
Missy Elliott.
Missy, Miss the meter Elliott.
Who's that?
Fat, fat, fat, fat, lady.
I don't know.
Missy Elliott, is that her name?
Yeah.
Well, get a right, Chuck and Miami.
But thank you.
Get around the list.
Missy in the-
Whatever name is.
Missy, Missy.
Here's the facts from Sergio again.
Who says, don't do it.
Neal, Mel and Bank is the same.
Richard Melon's safe.
I'm not-
I'm not going to bank there.
Thanks anyway, Woody.
I'm not going to do it.
I mean, you have to have some principles in life, right?
Who would be like, like you going out and shopping at Walmart today?
Never happened.
Isn't going to happen.
And there's no chance in my banking.
Nothing against the guy that's over there.
I wish him all the luck in the world.
I'm glad he enjoys the show.
And I hope he doesn't take it personal.
I will not do business with any incident.
I'm not gonna make a promise.
The situation connected with the melon family from Pittsburgh.
Go care, Richard Melon's skip.
In sort of.
No.
Or Florida citrus.
Right.
Just one of those things.
Like I said, you have to have a few principles.
I mean, who is the only bank in the world than you have no choice?

Following is a paid public service announcement from the International Riteful Association let's face
Most of us will never be rich. Hell we probably won't even be successful and that's pretty damn depressing
But as usual with every problem there is a solution. Hi. I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about hand guns
They scare the shit out of people intimidate them and giving you whatever you want. That's right hand guns
Think about it. Need some cash rob a bank
Don't have enough money for beer or the convenience store takes chips and pretzels wire at it's all free of you've got a handgun
Some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him to simple solution of life's complex problems
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner
Well, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares by the damn thing of the street just buy a lot of handguns
It's a great alternative to working problems out and be considered a population control
Yes handguns. They just might make your fans
1233 or 560 I've sitting here. I'm looking out my window. It's a beautiful day, and I'm thinking you know, I could be in Batavia New York
I could be in Kalamazoo. Not seriously. I see people walking around. I see cars. I see streets and buildings. I see London. I see France. I see a restaurant day
And I'm thinking I could be like in Pittsburgh
Yeah, I could be in if saline Michigan. I
Could be in Sacramento, California
Looking out the window. I'm just thinking these because you know Jeb Bush. He had a step right on it
Here's a good fast from Gary at least I hope it's good
He's just having with Bank Atlantic for over 20 years the people are friendly
They never made an error in fact in my poor days. They actually covered a couple of slightly overdrawn checks
Also, they're open on Saturday and Sunday. That's what the paralysis and remember
Yeah, he was touting Bank Atlantic
Because he said what Kovia blows is what he said. He's absolutely correct. Why Kovia blows a suck
Man, well that's the policy about that. Where do they find these people?
What's the obsession that they have with hiring these certain? I don't want to get into a whole thing
You know ethnic thing but these Jamaican kind of people you know
These imperious Jamaican women who have got a real crappy attitude and make it very clear that they don't really give a crap about you
Even if you're the biggest deposit or their institution they don't care because they got a whole lot of other angry people
Staying at their desk call the toll free 800 number and mess with them. Okay, but she ain't got time for me bitch
God
Man you can't complain about the service they give you because they'll give you none they suck
And did you mind me to make my point about that the first union of my Kovia bank sucks?
Don't forget to
Okay, here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hi, now. Yes, ma'am
You're missing the biggest richest guy in the United States for your poll look give me a clue because that's why I would be a person
She got it. I got it. Oprah Winfrey. Oh my god
Yep, that's her how could we have left off Oprah wow
Thanks for the reminder we're just getting a little old and feeble. You know how that goes that's okay
Same goes here. Thank you. You too. Bye. How could we forget Oprah? Yeah?
Oh, but she's gonna marry what's his name Maxwell still in
Oh, yeah, they're gonna get me well. Maybe they're not well. Maybe they are well as soon as J. Lo and Ben Affleck tied the knot
They're they're thinking about it next year. I mean not that it makes a difference. She's still got no talent her show blows
She's got those ridiculous pastel backgrounds that are well
I don't know what that's supposed to prove and she's got all these women millions and millions and millions of American women
Oh, she has to say fart and they're all like sitting on one cheek
Man, oh you go buy this book. Oh, by the I mean yeah, I know sure we recommend you good movies because you know
But it's not like some kind of a scam we got going
As a matter of fact look how stupid we are. Let's get smart
Yeah, like a Hollywood video or something right local story. Let's start our own goddamn video club on here
Let's start stealing a bunch of DVDs or making their bogus copies and sell them on the internet. Oh, by the way, Miss Fudge
Careful far be it far be it from me to disbelieve anything. I'd read on the internet
Wow talk about the popcorn the kettle pig mat
Oh, you see those cool joints just as they died those are rainy and sisters they died
It's my fault and they keep showing them on here again
Yeah, well, it was so great they died
It's I know you're not supposed to make fun of things like that. I'm not making I'm not talking about them dying
I'm not like for well on it. I think when people die it's sad usually although if the Catherine Harris there would have been true
Well, but I mean, you know, there are a lot of things to think about when you have simis twins like that. I mean how do they?
Go to the toilet. Yeah, don't go stealing my tomorrow's show. No, I think that's a good show for you tomorrow
That would be a good poll. That's what I was gonna do which things would be the most difficult for simis twins to do have sex
go to the turret
Right on a bus right right a bicycle right a bicycle drive a car
Be a game show contestant
You see what I'm saying
Pitch for the marlins
That would be something that would really be something when you have two balls coming at you at the same time
As Ramosa said
You know those the original simis twins the the Chang and Ang brothers they both between the two of them fathered like
20 kids or something really and they married twin girls
They had in the Toronto star yesterday in the front page. There were two
Asian I'm not Chinese, but they were like I don't know where they were from
Pakistan or summer and
Kids that were like separated not it again. Get shortly after birth and
They and they you know how they look fine. No, they weren't after birth. They almost though
I guess but they they look fine, you know
They're like 18 now and even separated for years and they're surgery went okay
Unlike these poor Iranian sisters who died that would have put you off
Like if there were I'd you know the simis twins, but they were otherwise attractive
Facially speaking
What do you mean by that would you still do them? Oh, you mean if they were still connected? Yeah, or just imagine you could do one with each hand
Huh
That's something to think about now. Does that count as a three-summer what what was that that they said during the
Revolution, what if by hand and what if I'm out?
Is that what and who if you see that's what Paul Revere said something like that
5 6 7
Oh 5 60
5 60 there's another good question for you would you have sex with time these twins?
My poll was gonna be tomorrow. Yeah, I'm sure another one of these filthy disgusting
Yeah, yeah, I still wonder about that. I know it's it's but I mean you gotta go you gotta go
Right what what the party how about if one of them has to go and the other one doesn't I guess you don't have a choice, you know
Just come in and sit down or read a magazine while I'm taking care of
Venice right maybe that you that they had side-by-side toilets they could get on the same schedule
Don't forget I'm in Canada side by each. Oh, sorry. Here's a call from Key Largo. Hello
Good afternoon. Neil good afternoon to you sir. God you sound so happy up there. I am
I feel like I'm in paradise
You are in paradise
Belkies in array. Spilky is the rate you think is gay rhymes with the ring. Well, I hope so
Really? Okay
Well, let's put around there just to make you happy it's something like you're gonna get a real charge out of it
Okay, thank you. I am having a great day
You too. Let's put spilky's the runner any show we can take a dead bitch
We're delighted to do on the show pretty exciting the NBC call to inform us that the
Catherine Harris dying in a plane crash story was bogus
It was an internet hoax and then the rest of that story is they wanted to take a clip of us talking about it
To use on their news really. Why would they want to do that?
I don't know tough came in and asked the nice side no, right no right
Why do we want to do that?
To try to make us look like I said right out front that we were really dubious and trying to find the website and the whole thing
But it was just you know, it was a possibility and I checked out this on Sentinel and they hear all the it's not like it
Just came over to fax and I went on here boom here. It is we checked it out for a few seconds
We put it right on the air. Why not if it's good enough for Fox for those back to it's good enough for us
In fact, just make up a bunch of stuff and fax it to us and we'll read it on the air
Why not get a 90's here? Hey, by the way speaking to that we I think we all owe a
Collective a dead accredited even always been in a very short time
To Scott even I know that some people find him abrasive and some people find him to be a little invasive and uptrust whatever
But I think he's a little fire under this place
You know long overdue this this radio station has been stagnating ever since Greg Reed decided to fitily fart around with our morning show
We we've been having problems and then we decided to stick this show from nine to one instead of ten to two
That was like the last nail in our coffin
He just about buried and then after that when he put somebody on the air
Absolutely in a morning of precedez who was encouraging his audience not to listen to us because he's a humorous old fart
That was like the last thing and it was like closing up the box
So now we got a guy in there who's like you're created some excitement and we you can feel it you can smell it and speak in a feeling and smelling it
The little you know before the show every morning when for all is on
He comes in our studio during the commercial breaks and he and I have a little verbal intercourse a little chat as to what's going on
And he was pointing out to me this one now
This is a guy's only been there for six to seven weeks keep that in mind
But even even he's been there long enough to see the difference in the atmosphere and in the building in the hallway
The the morale among the troops as to when certain somebody is there and like now when he's not there
Absolutely the difference when everybody's in a great mood and they're like high-fiving each other and playing grab ass and all these other things
He went on for a long time about that
So I just mentioned that in passing okay. I think we've been given a new leash on life. Thanks Scott
You're okay, by the way, we ain't getting no breakfast
Hillary Clinton, which of these female celebrities do most strongly believe is a dike
And we ever get Oprah on there right away. Yeah, she's on her. She don't have any votes. She will
459 votes Hillary Clinton 170 to already foster 127. See she's slowly but surely she's closing in on her ass
Oh my god, what a thought. I don't think she's got any as does she Hillary? Oh
Him and her walk in hand and like I said she's all ass
And 2170 Jodie Foster 127 Jamie Lee Curtis 38 that I mentioned who's the father whose daughter
Jeannie and Jeannie and Garaflo 16 she's moving up fast
kind of very I don't pay that much attention to who she's doing
Mariah Carey 15 and colder 14 and a quarter. Horia 14
Britney Spears 12 Seguro and a winner a we winner 12 J. L. 12
Janet Jackson's got eight
Kathy bait six Christie Mcdickle five. That's good that Christie still got some votes because most people probably forgot about her
Now what was the show that she was on was she on family? Yes
With what's his name Gary
Puckett Dornhofer what what what whatever the hell his name was
You know who I'm talking about Gary Frank's okay
I never watched family and the mother was say the Thompson and the father was James somebody who died a couple of years ago James
Somebody James. I'm dead. Well, what a memory, huh?
That was really a corny show. I did like Gary Frank though sooner reason I watched it
Kathy bait six Christie Mcdickle five Nicole Kidman for Whitney Houston three Helen's hunt two and that's it a whole bunch of people with no votes
Yet get with it folks Daisy Fuentes Linda Evans Melissa Rivers downtown Julie Brown Elizabeth shoe
These people have no votes also also with no votes are Linda who else shard a
Well somebody must have just a got one and they're all young
Lisa Marie's got one Queen Latifah to and Oprah's got one now finally nice going Oprah
That was kind of a giveaway when she said the wealthiest biggest fat is Oprah no talent bitch. That was kind of a dead giveaway, you know
God, I just you know more power to her I guess
But there's just something about her attitude that I don't like she's like not it's like her stuff don't stink you know what I mean
Instead of being like a little bit humble and saying she I've made billions of dollars and I have no talent and I have no idea
What I'm talking about and it kissed the ground for it. No, she asked like she's gonna say the word remember when she came to Miami that time
Oh, yeah several years ago, and she was she came to Miami to help us fright the crime way
And she was gonna have that show and that was gonna do it it did didn't I think so have you hear anybody dies since then?
I don't think so no more crime either no more shooting no more crime no more dying
Although a little of an every time they see her show on here they all scream
And boom would you look you notice we didn't have one call about that movie
We don't have any tricks anymore. I think you chased them all away. Sorry kisses kisses for everyone
I never heard of it. In fact, being a boy. Are you still putting stories on or not?
I sure hope not there's there's two but they were already on yesterday
Oh, and I was wondering whether I should put them on again. No not again my bad, but please do me a favor and do a search for kisses for everyone

She's okay by the way Pete says thank you for the information
Bank Atlantic blows. I just had the same exact situation you had this weekend with him
I had my paycheck wired on a Wednesday
Road checks that were cashed in the following Monday and bank Atlantic claim that was overdrawn because it takes them five
You know you know something?
Five business days for the wire to clear cost me 60 bucks
They do have excellent service but the bank charges are through the roof if you want to check your balance at an ATM
Even there's a cost of buck and a half then if you want to withdraw money another buck and a half after while these charges pile up
I just got back this morning from closing my account with them. I use under the mattress banking out and they're great
And up he also says get for real off the air abruptly attend on the dot
I like him a lot but two hours is more than enough. Well if you can get him to shut off
You're lucky and I have paid to get it
Listen to me. I mentioned this to you before to show and I'm not one of those you know
I had this crusading on her radio. I gave that up for Lynn. You know a long time ago
But many many years ago when I was on WNWS WS news at night talking to 90-year-old people we did accomplish one thing
And I think it was back when BDI Bobby Graham was in the Senate at that time
I mean when it not the he's in the Senate now dummy when he was the governor and
And thanks to him and some people in the Florida legislature
We brought it to their attention this scam that's been going on out back in those days
They used to hold out a town checks all of the banks in South Florida. They're in the state
They used to hold them for like I don't know two weeks or so ridiculous amount like that and checks that were like in town for five to seven days
Well come to find out that because it's all done electronically and keep in mind this was years ago that we did this
They forced them to write a law
But even that law is is not restrictive enough. We find out that almost every local check clears within what all of them do within one day and some of them the same day that you
Deposit local banks because it's done electronically and out of town checks two to three days tops tops
Even if you deposit it from a bank in LA two to three days tops for particular because it's all done electronically
So I think what we need to do is get somebody on a ball with us and cut this crap
Because this is the one of the biggest scams in America
How would you like to be in a business where you have a whole bunch of people handing you their money to hold for them?
But before you let them use it you hang on to it for several days and you're making money on it. You're earning interest on it
Which is exactly what they do. It's one of their biggest money makers one of the biggest scams that the banks have going
There shouldn't be any hold maybe a day. Okay. Maybe they if it's not like a long-time customer that they know is dependable and doesn't bounce checks
You should have a status
Well, that's what I had until goddamn my first union in Wacovia came along. They should only croak. They suck and their attitude sucks
I understand there's just 700 other angry people in line in front of me, but I'll be goddamn this up
Yeah, like you said if you're a schlepper like you and
You're trying to like juggle and rob from Peter to pay Paul and fighting checks and doing whatever which happens
There's happened to all of us in our lives
I understand that but when you're somebody like me who's making some serious bucks
I don't bounce checks. What would you think if that check that I gave you for beater boys computer?
What would you think of all sorry mr. Rodriguez, but the checks no good it came back
Yeah, dead be old fat dead be old fart. What's wrong with you in the money? You're making you piece of crap
You put that no seriously you'd be pissed off
I would be alright. That'd be funny. It would be funny coming from you somebody else that freak out
Yeah, coming from me my ass. Okay
Coming from you and if you already spent that money if you're already written with checks on or something
You wouldn't think it was so goddamn funny sweetheart. No, but not a problem right now
How do you know check your balance lately? Yeah?
Five six after I told you the story you probably run a phone immediately. Oh my god

We have to add another a penis story Peta
Peta and KFC in game of chicken
An animal rights group said it plans to file a lawsuit. This was yesterday
Against fast food chain KFC
Accusing the company of making misleading statements on its website regarding how the chickens it sells are treated
There's nothing worse than misleading statements on the internet. You know that
Right. I hate that's what the mr. Ruggie said
People for the ethical treatment of animals
Said it'll file suit in California state courts
Where I guess they did yesterday against KFC and its parents yum brands incorporated yum. Why you am young
Rhymes with dumb
Seeking and injunctions stop what it says are deceptive statements on a KFC website
Peta contends that Peta contends that chickens KFC buys from suppliers are abused through drugging feeding and slaughter practices
The director of vegan outreach of Peta Bruce friedrick said the treatment is legal
But they can't legally lie about it and they have been they've been lying about it through their teeth
Friedrich alleged KFC's website other public communications contain miss statements about how the chickens are treated
The claims on the website are transparently absurd. He said we've tried writing letters to explain to them
On their what is on their website is laughably obviously wrong and they've ignored us
Sposed people for KFC and young could not be reached for comment. They're probably hanging out with a kernel
Peta in a draft of the plan lawsuit obtained by Reuters takes issue with a KFC statement on its website
That it's guidelines for the treatment of chickens are designed to ensure that all birds are handled humanely and suffer no pain
Now I'll be making no comment about the bird okay because I know that's what's coming from you next
He's feeling he's feeling no pain
The Peta suit is one of the new risk-facing food companies such as crafty McDonald's recently
Plainiffs and obesity lawsuits alleged that certain food products responsible for making them over weight and by the way the last few days
Because I haven't been on the air there been all these stories about those trans fatty acids
Which I've been screaming about for years and which dr. McCulley cullkin Kilmer whatever his name is also with screaming about
And trying to tell you that it wasn't a cholesterol. I was gonna give you a heart attack and clog your arteries and kill you
But it's the trans fats baby. So let me just tell you this little piece of advice
Okay, you're not gonna do it anyway
But those french fries that I'm always screaming don't eat them don't eat them
Yeah, but and cookies and the and also like I totally I'll admit it bryers ice cream
I thought aren't they supposed to be famous for using all the gritty being natural
Well, guess what all natural partially hydrogenated oils
If you look on the label that says hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated that means it's trans fatty acids
And it's gonna kill you in the long run maybe in the short term. What if it's impartially?
Maybe in a few minutes. It's a third man. It'll kill your damn ass, huh
Well partially hydrogenated only kills your partially. I say like the markdown which parts
Well, whatever one that's in the mood for on that day. I'm just telling you
Trans fatty acids. That's what all you
Doctors you fakers ought to be concerned about instead of this cholesterol boy
The whole thing with cholesterol was just a scam so they could have Dan Reeves on tv selling you zokor and lipitor and all this other crap
All this other bull crap that's got these brutal side effects
I'm just that's just my opinion. Okay, continue taking whatever you want whatever crap your doctors pedaling in these days
Have a good time with it
Make a lot of money for all those goddamn companies for Eli Lilly and Pfizer and all these other grave robbers have a good time
Did we ever come to a conclusion by the way in Florida what what the deal is with those
Buy drugs from Canada things that they were trying to close up. What was ever the option? I don't know if we have closure on that
I see but we sure had a lot of ladies call today, which is a real breath of fresh here. Here's a lady in for a lot of deal. Hello
Hello. Yes, ma'am. It's another lady. All right. All right
Excellent on the chronic factor killer
But I was able to call you today because I'm driving down from Paul Beach
I wanted to tell you about Melanie and I in national band
Okay, and I don't know if you heard this but um used to be United National Bank of hometown banks here
Right to the customers
Then melancham down and join them but they still stay just as nice the local people are pretty much in charge
And it still has the atmosphere with small town bank right and they're fantastic and they're very easy to
On the internet so I bank online now yeah, and I really I really recommend that now two things though
The only water near office that I know or brownored office that I know of is right across from the brother County Courthouse
Uh-huh, and that's all building oh god
Yeah, but I don't know maybe they have one out west now
And the other thing is that it um yes, it it is from the melancholy from Pittsburgh
Not for me then
Not for me
I'm from Pittsburgh that I you know anyway also would you put tender bollic on the list
You think sender bollic is a dike oh yeah
Just look at our last movie just look at her what was your last movie god
Uh-huh, I didn't see that with you great
Okay, I'll be rumours about them having a round hands that they didn't and I'm well under show
Well, we got it down
Thanks, Laura. Have a great day. All right
Get Sandra Bullock on her boy. She's taking a beating on our polls the last couple of weeks. Uh-huh
And that's okay. I think she's cute
Yes, she is and quite frankly. I don't care whether she's a dica. I should know a fact like me
Care what is she I mean what differences and make anyway what we think we're not gonna get to know any of these people
What what differences in me we're not gonna do them anyway, right like mad Damon am I gonna do mad Damon?
I'm gonna meet mad Damon am I gonna like touch it? No, of course not you know, I mean he's pretty good
I'll tell you a born identity you'd be really proud
It's a boy, Matt. You really pushed up a lot. I wrote a talent
Yeah, you'll like the movie trust me. I guarantee I got bet be your boys life on it
In fact, I'll bet everybody's life if it isn't more interesting than a god dim uh that horrible horrible movie that you forced me
And it was mostly be your boy. Oh, this is really great a beautiful mind. Even if they had beautiful minds
I should have kept looking for the wrong name at least then I wouldn't have found it
A beautiful mind with Russell Crowe. Boy you ought to be eating Crow right now mr. I'll tell you that because that's for the birds
That movie it sucks I stand by
Well, when when does it get good at what point of me?
He's beside the fact he's drinking
And figuring about much of numbers and he's kind of like a social misfit beside that what what what happens?
It's all foundation. You have to watch it. Oh, no, you know, you think it is
You probably know that off right when it was about to get good
ah
right
Yeah
Yeah, you probably left just about when it was ready to get hard see what you don't know yet watching that movie. Yeah, he's crazy
Yeah, and what I don't know is I had a crazy divide and then to watch it. I know I was crazy
But it was based on a real guide on some math and math issues still alive and uh teach and class up in wherever it is
Berkeley or something yeah
Wow, it's
crazy
I bet you share gold farms a lot more entertaining than hill ever big
I stock up the old thank you
I got like a little
Quinge yeah, I go in when I have to
I'm not very clean
See that movie is much too cerebral from a girl without with all due respect. I mean he's a wonderful guy
He looks great. He does a good job for us, but he's uh
dumb, you know
You know, I mean I don't mean like he's articulate. He can speak english. He's peeking upon you know, but he's uh, you know
You know, I'm saying
Well, no, it's just that stuff's aren't done yet come on like I said
He's probably the smartest pick I ever met my life uh with the accepted present company. I don't know too sure about either one of you
So anyway, this fax from Matt Korshwarf at city national bank of Florida
This is like a see and it's a damn good thing. I come on the air and bitched about it because that's how I met Matt in the first place
Although, he always turned me down. No, but seriously
That's how I got with family bank in the first place. Remember I was bitching about Haitians and I mean nations bank
Yes, and look what happened to that they went out of business anybody see nations bank lately
They got bought out by some other fakers probably my first union or somebody. I think it was
So don't be mess it with me with my banking because I'll put your ass out of goddamn business if it's the last thing
I do when you start dealing with my mind is I told this woman down the phone and on whatever yesterday
I said we're not talking about a uh a
Supermarket we're not talking about a god damn hats store. We're talking about people's money
And you people just keep making two goddamn many mistakes. It's unacceptable
She's got this cavalier goddamn attitude about well kind of like they'll do me the favor if they feel like it
If not then they won't do it like they're doing me a big favor right
You can't you can't extend a privilege to a customer and then all of a sudden say oh, but we're not gonna do that for anymore
We changed their mind
You see what I'm saying? You can't expect to keep customers by doing that
It'd be like us saying well, you know
We used to do a pretty entertaining show for the audience out there
But we're not gonna do that anymore. We're gonna play like Beethoven four hours every day
Let's give it a shot or let's just play
Play that all day every day. I like that a lot
Don't forget we got the marlins in the cub that don't go running away because we got a ballgame coming up
Okay, no, a lot of you like to play that game because you want like
But the way to marlins have been playing lately and we got Don trail d'Arnell whatever his name is what is his name
Don trail willis
the talk of
America he's gonna be pitching against the of cubs and wriggly field one forty five to pregame and the game at 220 this afternoon
With Harry Curian Steve Stone
You know is there any more don't let me forget on Thursday
Because it's a long way off when you get to be this old who knows if I'm gonna make it
But when Thursday when I do the crossover with for real I want to ask him because I know he won't be
S. Me is there a more boring baseball announcer than Dave Van boring on a marlin's seat
That's one of the problems. That's one of the reasons I have nobody out there is because there's nobody to whip up
enthusiasm
I say let's get for relatively to play by playing next year. There you go. Hey, he's looking for some extra money. Yeah
I mean he can do the panthers. He can do the freaking marlins
Look at that. It's an epic home run
I can just hear it now probably get a license in this middle of the second inning, but it'll be great
I'll get some people out there just like Harry. Carrie got us all to be comforts
That's what they're like Bob Prince made all the people pirate fans like Rick Weaver with his white hankies and his schmoth is in his bad aroma
Too bad we got what we got now pop had janko look. Oh, we got absolutely

You know, it'll be fun right now.
Here's the third race from Calder with my good close friend Phil Saltsman. Wouldn't this be fun?
They're all online, hey, it feels not there today.
And they're all.
Oh, like I said, who wants to hear that?
No, remember he told us he's only working like so many days away.
No, sorry.
Glad war for Corp.
We love your escalade.
A roof and chainy bush venue.
That's just USV.
We don't mind you see our jobs go.
A bad economy's good.
We're fascinated by jail.
No, don't need no stupid.
Oh, that's what it's crazy.
The facts are far away.
Everybody's earning five years.
Like us, you ask.
Oh, it's big enough the American exit way to shootings in Mississippi today.
And Meridian, how about the near shootings, the near Columbine repeat that we had yesterday
in Jersey?
Yeah.
Almost, almost doesn't came within a, came within a kinky little hair that close.
Having another mass shooting in a school and got only those where else they were going
to be shooting up a bunch of people.
Crazy people with guns, man.
Got a whole bunch of faxes here.
Here's one that says to Ed insult injury if you deposit cash in your account and watch
over your money after 2 p.m. and broward 4 p.m. and date.
The money doesn't post immediately in your account.
What kind of crap is that?
They suck.
Yeah, I've heard that.
They can make a cash deposit and they still put it on hold of the next day.
Even though the money is in there, maybe they're afraid the money's going to bounce.
There you go.
They don't know what that money came from.
That's right.
Now, somebody faxes me a poll that we took of what's the movie had the most shocking ending.
And American beauty was on us is remember this.
Yeah, I think it's it well on the poll.
Is there the deal?
Well, I see.
Well, whatever.
I still haven't seen you, but I will.
Don't get pushy.
I must have watched the whole bunch.
I'm about third man week or so, including that black cat with Bella Gossi and in the
Boris Carla, but and wore the worlds again, which was sensational.
Everybody should be forced to see that.
All that religious bull crap, although of course in the end, you know, they have to they
have to redeem themselves because that was back in 53, you know, right.
And of course they were in the church and they were all praying and all of a sudden, well,
I don't want to ruin the ending for you, but everything turned out okay.
Well, except for the people that are already zapped away, you know.
So anyway, American beauty, I'll get it.
I'll get it today just to calm you people down a little bit.
Now here's one I really, I mean, look, it's a matter of opinion like George and
being a boy both liked a lot a beautiful mind.
Tell me it was the biggest waste of time I could have been picking dingleberries out of
most but okay, it finished 20 minutes and probably had a more enjoyable time than
watching that.
It was just it just it was slower was no more.
It didn't go anywhere.
Although that's something to think about on the station.
No movies are like that.
That's the foundation building.
Too long.
Too long it too long, you know, it's like too much for play.
Some of it is okay, but about 20 hours of it might be a little bit too much.
Your attention span can't be shorter than mine.
Here's one I saw a magnitude of the other night on your recommendation.
It says awful, just depressing.
Yeah, that's one of the iconic facts.
I see.
When you know what, it's the best and movie I ever seen.
What do you think?
Like it or not?
Tough to do, okay?
I mean, how many movies are uplifting, right?
A lot.
Usually, no, usually movies that are uplifting are corny movies, you know, like Jimmy Stewart
but oh, it's a wonderful life.
That's not the idea.
Well, I'm just telling you, those are the uplifting movies corny.
I mean, the record for Dream was that uplifting?
No, of course not.
It was depressing.
This movie is so portantly made that there were no words to describe it.
In the fact that you don't want to give it as proper a duly indicates to me that you
got to fuck up your ass about something.
Oh, I should have put that on the pole yesterday.
Yeah, that's right about Magnolia.
George is a fuck up his ass.
He's got Magnolia's up his ass.
A buzz, it just looks like a buzz.
What would you rather have up your ass, folks?
Lylots your magnolias.
Bugs.
Yeah.
That's such a phenomenal movie.
I don't see how I shouldn't have played that because every time I played I started thinking
about that scene again.
It just amazes me.
Every character in a movie is just so, I mean, you know, most movies there are characters
that I like that thing we did with the Godfather, you know?
We had a hundred characters on here and you could think about 80 of them and like if they
were in their fine, if not the big deal, a small potatoes, you know, like Frankie Pintangely.
Small potatoes.
Oh, you know that Al Pacino went to the, at least Ross is acting school in New York
as when he got his start.
No, I didn't know that because his bio was on biography last night.
Al Pacino.
And that's why he personally interceded to get that was the first time Lee Strasser was
ever in a movie.
Did you know that?
No, I did not.
No, you got two pieces of news for you.
Did you know that Catherine Harris is dead?
Oh, no, that's right.
She's not.
Well, we can't be perfect.
And Lee Strasser, he went to him and he got him that part and got Father too.
I did just all these things and just a wealth of knowledge with all this stuff that I'm
seeing these days.
Just tons of crap.
I think that's cool.
Pull question.
Which of these female celebrities do you most strongly believe is a bike?
It's a bike Tuesday.
So everybody get ready to stick your feet like they do in Holland, stick your finger in
the bike.
Hillary Clinton 184, 184 for Hillary.
She's still got a solid lead, but Jodie Foster's creep in, creep at ever closer 151.
She's going to make a two-hoss race out of it.
And they still got a 60-throw motor.
Yeah, I was going to put Phil Sonsman on there and Phil's not working today because it's
Tuesday, never on the Tuesday.
Sorry, Phil.
Jamie D. Curtis 41 and colder 26.

Sigourney Weaver 13.
She said that lesbian stuff is alien to her.
Jaila, who says she knows alien, she's got 12.
How can Jaila only have 12 votes?
What does she have to do, folks?
Does she have to come out there with a big billboard?
Does she have to have a sign for it?
She was married to that ballet dancer, whatever that first guy was.
Everybody that she's ever been associated with when I was supposedly married to was a
fruitcake, okay?
Is there a message here?
Is there a consistent pattern here?
Jaila will be 12.
Britney Spears 12.
Kathy Bates 11.
Chris, you know, see they probably figured with a big ass like that what a waste do it be with Jaila, you know?
What are Dice gonna do with a big ass like that?
I know, asked to ask.
Christie McNichol 9, Janet Jackson 8, Nicole Kibben 7, Oprah Winfrey's about 7.

Out of 561 votes.
How do you like that, Boehner Boy?
561 votes.
No bad.
You just aren't the same today.
Are we going to hear about what your prom was this morning?
Get it out of the way to the slate clean.
I got pulled over.
You got pulled over again?
They had to switch my renna-cloth.
They had to switch my renna-cloth.
Oh my god.
Apparently they didn't switch over the tag.
And they were like, I was in the backseat of the car again.
I think they were going to like, they were trying to get a prize and nobody had a prize.
It was telling them anything.
And finally they said, oh yeah, we finally got a car and switched the car with these
producers, you're sure, over the lights this morning.
So yeah.
This man is not allowed to leave the building.
Well, let's build them.
We can find someplace in there like in a kitchen.
But there's an empty second floor.
He can just go over there and go over there and go over there.
Oh, okay.
There's a lot of people going to the back house.
Come on down the second floor.
We'll build you like a little apartment down there.
You're like a back house.
You're not permitted to leave the building, okay?
Because allowing you on the outside is dangerous.
You're laughing.
This is a man who cannot be allowed to drive, to walk, to be on the loose.
Man.
Anyway, I still love that movie.
I'm going to give it to anybody.
So if you're depressed, you're bad.
Hey, you're a soft lord.
Anything got to be more entertaining than that.
Maybe that's what they're depressed about.
Come on.
And I just love Amy Man.
Okay.
I don't care what anybody says.
I love Amy Man.
How you gonna argue with me about that?
No, I've been a Amy Man fan for a long time.
Paul Thomas Anderson is a freaking genius.
Okay, this man is a genius.
Anybody who could have made that movie and done all of these things.
And Jason Robards, like I told you, just basically died on the screen.
Pretty damn close to it.
He died right there on a freaking screen.
See, Jason.
What a great actor he was.
Jason Robards is dead.
Buddy, hack it is dead.
Catherine here.
I'm sorry.
Buddy, episode is dead.
Catherine Hepburn.
Definitely not.
Catherine Hepburn is dead.
Catherine Hepburn probably is with an H.
That's what I was.
Hey, Miss Fudge, it was Catherine Hepburn.
They were thinking about Catherine with an H.
Is that to it?
No.
It's just like you folks.
You don't agree with me that that's the best TV theme of all time.
You're wrong.
Look at that.
You won't believe this.
You're never going to believe this in a million years.
What?
Where I'm sitting here in my studio out on the window.
There's like a little patio.
Enter these cheesy chairs, you know, the kind of like patio chairs.
It just tipped over.
The wind just, I mean, didn't go over the edge of the,
it can't do that, but it just, it just tipped over.
I guess that's got to be paying me for that Catherine Harris story.
Oh, we apologize profusely, don't we?
No.
We're so sorry that we got sucked in.
Well, we didn't really get sucked in.
We just had it and we kind of like debated is this for real or not.
And why not let you know just in case.
And it got us on the drudgery port, which is seen by how many billion people
every day.
There you go.
Thanks a lot, Miss Fudge.
She's packing it.
We got the ballgame coming up.
131 is 560 WQM.
It's coming up at 145 with a pregame from Wriggly Field with Dave and Boring.
And the books, do we love the books there?
But Dave, are you van Boring or what?
Oh, man.
Don't let me forget Thursday to talk about that with what's his name.
With our Savior and Hero, the man who brought us from the depths of despair
back to the top of the mountain.
You'll see, you'll see, bringing him on board has to turn this place around.
It's the best damn thing whether we like him or hate him or whether he's a pain in the
answer, whether he's going to lose the license.
He is just a revitalized QAM, which was like, like dying on the vine.
Thanks to Greg Read and his messin' messin' and messin'.
And of course, thanks to some of the people he brought in, not the mention of names.

Listen what we said.
138.22 till two marlins and cubs. So just minutes away now.
Lynn Samuel's emailed me and she said,
Lee Strasberg would love a bunch of them.
What did I say? Did I say Lee Straszer?
I don't know. You want to know why?
Because I always do that.
Lee Straszer was a salesholder at WNWS about 100 years ago.
I always said Lee Straszer. I would have corrected you.
Well, why did she say that? She had like 80 exclamation points.
Lee Strasberg. Isn't that what I said?
Straszer?
I don't get it.
And I emailed her back and I said,
what did I say? What did I say?
Is there a way in there?
No, no message.
Well, she'll let me know. Believe me.
She'll let you my ass out.
Whatever I did wrong.
Hey, it wouldn't be the first mistake today, Lynn.
Made a bad mistake on that Catherine Harris story.
And are we upset about that?
No, we got some nice coverage on your boyfriend's website.
Billions and billions of people all over the world.
More people than our alive yet today are seeing that.
We put it on that she was dead while she was right there on C-SPAN on TV.
And of course, what was our first call?
First call right out of the box.
I got it. I was watching on C-SPAN at their intellectual audience for you.
Can't pull the wall over this audience's eyes.
All we've been doing it for a long time.
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello.
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?
Pretty good, sir.
That's still magnolia.
I didn't think that was all that great of a movie.
Still a tag.
This is Reverend Jones.
Yeah, Reverend Jones.
Yeah.
Here's the Del Rey Beach. Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, my back is Sharon.
Sharon, do you think it's a die?
Yeah, well, you know, I'll need as much fish as every time you see it.
So what does that tell you?
But I got a couple more things.
I work at a lab in Palm Beach County.
And that fatty acid, you could make super balls out of stuff.
You couldn't kill that with a hammer.
I'm telling you.
That stuff is unbelievable.
Right.
I got a funny story for you.
I was talking to Hank yesterday.
And they want to know why there was no black guys in that car.
And I said, because you'd have to put, uh,
you have to put sirens to go my machines on the rest of the cars,
get them to drive fast.
Here we go.
Boy, he's your like this, huh?
I have to help him like this too.
Yeah, again, that whole dusty,
baker thing about blacks and about the spicks and I don't know.
And here, here about a week and a half ago,
the Toronto Star had a big thing on the front page,
calling the blue jays, the white jays.
And they don't have enough blacks.
They don't have the same percentage.
I mean, let's cut the crap already.
Okay.
Can't we just get along?
No, that would be, be no fun.
Be no, be no, uh, cook.
Oh, God.
Football season isn't that far away.
And what is the one thing we dread about football season on WQA?
Oh, look at that.
Did he take the thing off of me?
I think you're pardoned.
Miss Fudge, he took my thing off there.
I had the big headline.
Now it looks like it's gone.
Well, that, my, uh,
10 minutes of fame, sure, in last too long.
Although, uh, a lot of other stuff has changed on here too.
Well, we had like a little flash on there.
Just a little flash.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T,
and Verizon Wireless Live.
What's that schedule look like?
We got the ballgame coming up.
The big,
Oh!
It works real cheap, obviously.
5, 45, right after the Marlon game,
uh, till 10 o'clock tonight.
Oh, man.
That's an awful lot of the big,
if you ask me, huh?
Don't you think?
Oh, I wouldn't know.
We talked to that spanglish baby talk.
You know what I'm talking about?
I never hear that.
I never hear that.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, 80K at 10,
and then join Mark overnight, 2-5-2-1.
By the way, they still want that hour back.
In case Moe is listening,
you know what Moe says?
I'm listening.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Are you kidding me?
Forget about that.
We don't know where it is.

They come.
Yeah, get out here.

Exactly.

So psychologically we have prepared for that big 12.

Oh, that's the wrong one.
Oh, don't do that.
Oh, no.
What?
So I wanted to go on out to the ball game.
We got to play music, right?
Right.
I'm going to play that.
Just relax.
Relax.
First I wanted to play this.
And relax.
Relax.
By the way, my mother still takes X-Lax.
She told me she took six things, whatever it was.
And then the next day she took six.
Crap.
In fact, I'm going to be getting out the information
I can email my mom and get all the latest updates
on her ball movement.
Can we post them?
We can post my ball movement the time
and the texture on our website.
Does she have a digital camera?
Why do I hear about Catherine Harris?
I'm going to play the music.
Be watching for Millie's Cratcam
coming soon to the website near you.
Put that train spot in the shame.
Marlins in the cup, maybe.

Learned to spell with Don Trell.

Absolutely.
All the crap you can unwrap.
All the slime all the time.
