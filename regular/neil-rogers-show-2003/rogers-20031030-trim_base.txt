Neil, I'm having 20 naked women.
Caddy for me.
I heard that a little crack.
I'm not a crack.
And what about Scrooan?
How's that book coming?
She's got a crack.
How about my one on the stink?
It's out in the book for you.
Now listen, I'm on a rapper.
One.
I just had Keenan on and I was teeming.
Yeah, I told him.
My Keenan and I told him I was wearing my Dougie Gilmore
a road blue leaf sweater.
I'm sure he was impressed.
I thought of you this morning when I put it on.
Maybe the Panthers ought to sign Dougie Gilmore up.
We can't do it here.
Maybe they ought to sign them up.
How about over six on the power play?
And how about three shots in the third period?
How about them getting their ass kicked in Ottawa again tonight?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't want to say that to Mike.
So I asked him instead what his favorite fish was to eat.
Yeah.
And I also don't know if that's it.
Did he say snapper?
Do you know the river up there?
What's it called?
He gave me the name of it.
What was the name?
It was a little little nile or whatever that runs through Ottawa
and all the little kids in their family skate on it.
You're asking me?
I don't know.
You're the crap about Ottawa.
You're going to people who live there hate it like poison.
No, they don't.
Yeah, they do.
No, they don't.
Ottawa sucks.
And they're going to build a new stadium for the Marlins in Ottawa.
It's a great town.
How do you like the fact that if they do build a stadium Miami which they will,
they're going to call it the Miami Marlins?
I actually like the Toronto better than Ottawa,
but I think Ottawa is a cool little town.
I'll take it town.
I think it's sucks.
They say admittance and sucks,
but I think admittance was cooler than Calgary.
Yeah, Calgary is a bunch of a Stant Peter's man or a bunch of Rednecks.
Yeah, a bunch of truck drivers.
They be Cowboys.
But they have a bar there called Cowboys with a bunch of,
let's just call them Husseys.
Yeah.
And it was unbelievable doing the two-step with a bunch of hockey players.
So you're going to get your own website.
Let's hear it.
I'm time for Crennallos.
Yeah, it took me a lot of money too because,
you know, I just wanted to have a cool site where I could,
you know, like you make money.
The difference is that you give all years to charity and I'm going to keep all mine.
Yeah.
Well, I'm nothing wrong with that.
No, I'm just like you.
You know, I'm not like,
I'm just like you.
You can put all your filth and photographic rep on your website.
You don't have to sit on the area.
You don't have to say, ask.
You got there right now about that.
How about I'm just like you.
I'm following in your footsteps.
I'm now building, and I've had one before in my garage,
which was my garage days revisited studio.
But I'm building a studio in Boca.
Excellent.
Yeah, I get a,
that way you won't have to see Mona.
Exactly.
And I get skied every day.
I see the Jew.
You just get, you know, you still doing a drawing with him eight o'clock or so.
Skitting.
No, I don't ever talk to him anymore.
Are you serious?
Yeah, why would I?
Absolutely.
I mean, I just have nothing to say to him.
And you know what?
I didn't take long boys and girls,
all those people who thought it was just me and George.
Just say everybody else in a building.
I don't have anything against him.
I just, I just don't seem to have,
I have better days when I just avoid him.
Yeah.
I don't have anything to say to the guy other than, you know,
have a nice trip and I hope I don't see it till Wednesday.
Yeah.
Obviously town, I know he doesn't work.
So it's great.
Whenever they're on the road, I'm having a party because I know that was the
best thing about coming back from vacation.
Usually it's kind of a downer after you have a good vacation.
Right.
But he wasn't there Monday or Tuesday because he was in 10 p.
Right.
And I thought this is great.
I actually wish that he would have caught on fire or his hair in
San Diego.
At least a muskrat.
Yeah.
You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,
his, his hair is just like those trees they're filled with beetles.
Mojauer, David, it had to have a flaming muskrat removed the surgically
from his head.
Here's us making fire noises in the studio.
What does the story with mandage is he like under the weather is he on
vacation.
He's off again today and he's got a, he really learned well.
I'll tell you that.
You know, he's a millionaire who cares what he takes days off.
You know, it's funny.
He admits that I'm his mentor.
I taught him how to work like about two days a year and get paid like big
bucks.
Well, why do you, what do you think I'm doing everything that you've taught me?
Yeah.
Even to hate everybody and and doing that.
Yeah.
I, I, I, everything.
I just follow everything.
You give me and then we're doing now.
If I don't like to survive, you survived the initial crap there.
You're gonna be okay.
I'm, I'm survived.
I'm trying to go into the radar love, but I, I, uh, I have problems with the feds.
Let's see.
And then, um, let's see.
Don't say it.
Oh, tonight I'm going to a party.
I've heard it.
I'm the night's the ratings party.
Me and everybody's invited.
I'm going to be given a location a little bit later.
Give me my buddy Greg having a cocktail.
Won't that be beautiful?
Yeah.
Hey, what do you have in Scott's rocks?
Hey, you know, it's great.
They invite everybody to a bar to get loaded and then drive.
Aren't you oppressed by those suits that he wears, you know, those Brooks Brothers suits?
He really impresses them.
Yeah, you know, my dad buys Brooks Brothers and I buy Hugo and I buy, actually, I have a guy in Atlanta that makes me suits.
And, um, and when he makes him, he gets drunk with me.
So it seemed better in there.
Unless I thought that by my suit.
I would go out and be able to afford to get a decent haircut.
I buy go to the leechies, but I go to Toronto to buy my suits.
I swear to God.
Do you really?
Yeah, two for one.
Dude, why wouldn't I?
I get $1,000 with the suits for 500 bucks.
I don't want to get Paul and Old Ron all of a sudden talk about the fact that it's sunny and beautiful.
And it's going to be $59 to the end.
$68 tomorrow in Toronto.
I'm going to start doing Toronto weather reports every day.
I hope you do like my show because you know, in about a month and a half, it won't be $58 and 60 there.
Boy, speaking by the way, speaking of Paul and Old Ron, I'd like to see, you know, this last rating book where we did such a great deal.
Is it a guy that I lost, too?
No, seriously, I want to see the breakdowns.
My mufflincy and clearance between the two of them, they've really laid out on the job.
I don't have any of the mufflies that don't have the hour by hour like you against them and me against IOD.
I have nothing here.
Well, the difference between...
You think that instead of swishing around down there in Key West at Fantasy Fest, then maybe mufflin would get off for lazy ass and send me some reasonable crap?
Lazy ass?
Yeah, lazy ass.
I don't think it's a lazy ass.
No, lazy ass.
I mean, the...
The...
The...
The aura...
Right, they had all those people have advertising and bestowing that needed.
But those guys are probably doing the old ass to ass right now.
How many people do you think know that they have...
They have turned his back on clearance.
Don't ever turn your back on a beast. Not a good idea.
How much do you think we suffer being on AM radio, Neil?
On what percent?
About third man.
And literally how much is it if we were on FM?
If we were on Power 96, can you imagine what we could do with that signal?
We could have doubled it to zero.
You and I would have 15 shares.
That's right.
Why isn't it that these lead doesn't spend any money on billboards and advertising and buses and all that?
We didn't have billboards back in the spring.
Until I showed up.
And as soon as you showed up, we couldn't afford them anymore.
Yeah, but now all...
You want to know why I'm a share behind those things.
No, I'm actually with them.
It would be good if we just...
Schmidt can't...
I won't set it.
If we Schmidt can't mow...
And we took the money that we're paying him that half a million a year.
We could buy a lot of billboards with that for the right authority.
Somebody told me...
I used to...
And I know it doesn't matter here at the station,
but he's got these huge 18 and 30 bars.
And one day I drove home and I went...
He knew I must be getting old.
But then I realized...
When you're on an age, all the kids are at school at 730.
And there's no kids listening to me or college kids who are in class.
And eight o'clock in the morning is when class starts.
And so all I have is retired.
Unemployed, bonk smoking perverts.
All right.
That's my problem, Mike.
I love your craft.
You know what most is the most is that I bought a big fat chalet right near of it.
And he's in the little business.
Everybody can take it to him.
In fact, what you ought to do every day is just have like a picture of your house.
And just stick it, just hold it up in the front of the wall.
Oh, it sounds...
And did you hear last night I had a bunch of little hoodlums attacked me at my house.
No.
And they knocked my door with like that karate kick and they were all dressed as Navy Seedles.
They pulled it.
They were all over the frickin...
They were in the bushes.
What the hell was that all of a sudden?
I was like, I'm gonna see my girlfriend naked.
A dry run?
It was a dry run for Hell night.
Can I determine it burn the city down?
All right.
That's it.
I love pre-Halloween violence.
I can only improve Detroit on ten years now.
I gotta run, I just farted it. It really smells.
Okay, have a great day, Scott.
We did it!
We did it!
We did it!
Well, congratulations. Get alive.
All right.
I can't believe I'm the winner.
I am the winner.
Well, it wasn't even close.
I exterminated all of great things.
The people didn't see the care.
I grabbed the poopies.
I didn't eat those.
They missed.
California has spoken at the women.
As the women said, I followed them.
In all it was like 30s to 3s.
But I don't care.
And the voters don't care.
Because now I'm done with all of the data of the California G-Wall P.
Well, I used all of my muscles.
And I used all of my sex appeal.
I'm very hot.
I guess the voters didn't care that I made all those big mouthfuls.
School meal.
Ha ha ha.
Well, if you're honest with your public and you tell them,
you are the far most free.
Trust me.
They'll forgive you like they did me and reject you to the DOD.
Here's a key change in the song.
Who's the man?
A little fat man.
Super Mario brother.
Never had a girl.
Parable.
The voters start about to make it in his little pack man on the way.
Look at the little silly tiny holes.
I'm the victor.
I'm the winner.
And my hot wife is a can of D.
Ha ha.
And now I'm done with all of the California G-Wall P.
Oh my god.
Ten per...
Oh, I love the way that just bills out.
Ten past ten at five sixty WQM.
Happy Thursday, today we got a best anneal van hit today, 11-1.
A lovely Miguel will be a ding and dent solutions.
He's there right now.
What do you mean by that?
He's there right now.
Well, why is that?
He just got there.
Well, it says 11-1.
So is he going to stay there for one?
Yes, indeed.
All right, now till one.
Ha ha.
Miguel's trying to make up for lost time.
Nice going, sweetheart.
From now till one o'clock, he said ding and dent solutions at 370
South Dixie highway that's on the northeast corner.
And I called Bokeh Brian to see if he wants to take his accurate down there to see if they can fix the smack job that the carwash guys did.
Yeah.
Because I'm going to wind up paying for it.
And he said he didn't call back.
So hey, Bokeh Brian.
I'm going to get a brand-new idea.
Get a brand-new idea.
Yeah, and in addition to which I didn't get nothing from him this week either.
Or last week when I was away.
Let me say it again.
On the northeast corner of Lijuan, US-1, from now till one o'clock, he's there right now with our best anneal merchandise including the Mohawar-David-D-
You asshole.
Keychains at our best anneal CD for a last year in this year.
And what else we got?
We got T-shirts.
I don't think he has them on there.
First ten people who make that $20 donation to abandon pay rescue get a pair of tickets to see the heat and the pistons tomorrow for opening night at the Mickey-Earson downtown we don't want to go to the arena.
Isn't that great?
Let's just start naming all the stadiums, all the teams rather after wherever the stadium is.
Or they could get a sponsor like the American Airlines arena?
Yeah.
They could be the budget rent-a-car marlins.
Or they could do like in-ron field and get a sponsor that goes bankrupt and out of business and then have to change you to re-five minutes.
Like that place in Philadelphia that Scott was telling me about where they played last night and the panties got their ass whipped.
They used to be-what was it?
The Spectrum.
No, no, that's another building.
That's next door.
But this one's already been the course or the Comcast.
Whatever, it's been like five different things already.
Yeah it has.
So, oh and before we continue with the show, oh look at this, we got to do the break already because Pharrell was,
they see that and they turn around and walk on.
One thing about QAM Man, every day is Halloween and our lobby with fruit cake.
So, what was it just about to say that was so damn important about Pharrell that you're going to build an ice sculpture to it?
No, but before that I had-well we'll do the break.
I got a book that you absolutely must not buy.
In fact, I got the book that you must buy and read and that's, dude, where is my country Michael Moore?
And when you must not buy, I'll tell you after the break, don't-it don't even think about it.
I am so pissed off at Dr. Arthur Agutsten, you really frost my ass you silly person you.
Talk about an exploiter and a user and a bandwagon jumper and a total piece of crap.
Your book blows, man.
Just a puff piece for all his buddies on South Beach and all his favorite restaurants.
He's probably getting free meals with all those restaurants now.
So did you like it?
You know what it is? It's a freaking recipe book. It just makes me sick to my stomach. I want a puke.
And you know the truth, your name is almost like Dr. Agutsten.
Dr. Agutsten, I probably changed his name for Kwanola.
Probably not. Seriously?
Just a coincidence, I guess.
Just a rip-off and a bad piece of crap. Don't waste money on this garbage, man.
All that does have a nice glossy cover.
10-13 at 5-60 WQAM. How about those Miami Marlin?
Oh! Let's hear it!
We got our pool. We got the Herald Pool. We got a good Linda Robertson article from yesterday, which is about time Linda.
Hey, imagine this. Imagine zero closing costs.
Zero application fees. Zero credit, zero fee.
Zero discounted points. It's the last mortgage you'll ever be needing in your life.
The revolutionary only one mortgage from financial group now with interest rate is just 1.95%,
which means if you have a $200,000 loan as an example, you pay only $738 a month.
And once you refinance your good new home mortgage from financial group, you'll never pay closing costs again.
1-800-940-Lend is the number to call to get all the information.
Grab yourself real financing power with the low rate mortgage you can move to your next property
without any further cost or expense.
Only one mortgage from financial group call 1-800-940-Lend for details.
It's a whole new and smart way to buy. There's zero underwriting fees.
There are zero dock fee, zero prepayment, and penalty, zero closing costs, even when you move to another property.
Get financing it's just 1.95% like I said.
Never ever pay closing costs again.
Call financial group today and tell them that crusty old neopolded call toll free 1-800-940-Lend.
That's 1-800-940-L-E-N-D, the Renequal Housing Lender.
Restrictions apply rates up to change monthly 5.19 APR.
My life and look all this is 4.056-E-Way-Way-Way-M.
I want to bang in the butt, honey.
Okay!
Tonight on Animal Planet emergency vets.
We've got him out of the tiger.
What seems to be the problem?
I think he's choking on something.
Let's have a look.
Oh my god.
It looks like it is.
He's choking on some kind of fruit.
Tiger stone-yed fruits.
That's what Sigfried and Roy thought.
That's tonight on Animal Planet emergency vets.
A follow-by, amazing animal album-its.
Oh my god. He's got fruit coming out the wasoon.
What?
I meant the tiger.
Roy!
1018 and 560.
Speaking of that, illusionist Roy Horn of Sigfried and Roy was moved yesterday to a-to-day.
How come the story took so long getting to a CBS news?
I don't know.
To a hospital almost a month after a tiger attacked him during that sold out performance as
people said.
Horn 59 had been-who gave you these numbers to fangs me by the way?
I scorned my fine.
You could do it.
We'd already pulled him out of his ass.
Brackdomed.
Oh man.
What?
I touched him.
Oh and here's monthly's.
Oh.
Yeah it's a good thing I've only got the copies because he pulled these obviously right out of his-
Brackdomed.
We could have probably also used the numbers for big so we could see how it's spurmed against
everyone in the morning.
Paul and Old Ron kicked the feral's ass.
Can you believe that?
Anywhere under that?
I'm just buried in stuff here.
You ought to see this.
I got buried in crap.
Buried in a sea of crap.
What a way to go though.
Horn 59 had been intensive care at University Medical Center in Vegas till he was transferred
to an LA medical facility.
UMC's Nevada's only top level trauma center.
Publicized Dave Kurvin declined to say where he was taken or discussed his condition.
In other words, they're not talking.
How do you like that?
If you want to see an actual photo of the Tiger attack of Tigger's attack on a Roy.
You can go to our website, neo-rangers.com and see an action figure going on there.
It's a beautiful thing.
Roy!
Why?
It's the funniest thing of everything.
It's the best thing in history.
Here's for Lauderdale.
Hello.
You're the man here.
I love you, man.
Yes, ma'am.
Want to talk to you about that book?
What book is that?
The South Beach Diet.
Oh, no.
But here's the thing, neo.
I respect your opinion.
I bought the book and the the the the the puff piece about the uh the South Beach restaurants.
They don't need any advertising as far as I'm concerned, but I mean I never bought it.
I never bought a diet book to follow a recipe.
I bought every book every diet book that's ever been made.
And here's and here's my here's my take on it.
I don't care about.
I don't care about recipes.
I don't follow the recipes, but it really educated me on you know the how your body reacts to certain things.
And I mean I never bought that kind of thing.
I'm not even seriously.
But let me ask you something.
I'm assuming you have way to lose, right?
Yeah.
Well, when you say it educated you want something, what kind of a diet is it when it all it has is a bunch of recipes.
It doesn't give you any guidelines.
It doesn't say what to do.
Huh?
It does.
Where is that?
Right before the recipes, it tells you, listen, right before the recipe, it tells you what you can and what you can't have.
Now, I mean, I can see getting discouraged about all those stupid ass recipes because most of the stuff sounds like crap to anyone.
I wouldn't make it or go there and eat it anyway.
No, wait a minute.
For Jay, you're talking about what says foods to enjoy and foods to avoid.
That doesn't really give you any guidelines.
This is just basically a whole bunch of menus.
Well, again, I didn't go by the menus.
I went by the guideline and you know, reading how your body reacts to certain things, how real sugar.
Right.
But you never bought any other diet books.
No, I never did.
Every other diet book that's ever been written will give you the glycemic index.
It'll give you all the stuff.
So I'm going to dance about diabetes and about carbs and refined carbs.
95% of diet books will tend to all of that stuff.
There's nothing revolutionary here.
Well, I mean, if you still got it ready then I agree with you.
The book is probably crab and I'll wait for it.
It's just a rip off of Ancens, man.
It's the most flagrant rip off I've ever seen.
The only thing he says is, well, Ancens recommends too much saturated fat and an affectable...
Yeah, it's just an affective.
I'm going to be honest with you.
I never follow a diet.
I probably like you, you know, I'll break down and get some fish with ice cream or something else.
Yeah.
I'm actually able to follow, you know, the, you know, quote unquote fear.
So in other words, you're losing weight on it.
I lost like 10 pounds and I don't like go off the diet and eat hot crispy cream,
doing it like I want.
It just, it's helped me.
But like you said, you could buy any other diet books basically do exactly the same thing.
You know what the key is though, if it works for you, keep it up.
Exactly.
Like just like you said with the ass, you can diet.
If I buy it on a diet book, see I'm going to rip out of the recipes because honestly,
have you ever followed any recipe on a diet book?
No.
How could anyone in their right mind, especially a man, how can lusually you're a gourmet,
cook?
How could anybody?
I'm going to record a cream.
I mean, you've got all these eating, all these ingredients, oriental cabbage salad with
the five different ingredients.
And somebody, some of the recipes in here, you're going to have like 20 different ingredients
to make it.
I wouldn't do that just in closing.
As far as the desserts is there, I eat sugar, big yellow.
I mean, it works for me and I get a little sweet, you know, a little something,
and it works for me with a lot of the recipes I'm really nasty.
I wouldn't try it.
It's really hard to find the ingredients behind it.
Certainly.
The theory behind it is a good idea.
If you never had a bad one, rip out all the recipes and it'll educate you if nothing
else.
Okay.
Keep it up there.
I love you, I love you, Neil.
See ya.
Okay.
Look at this.
Dill shrimp salad with herb dill dressing.
Dill shrimp.
Just in the shrimp, there's two for their six ingredients there and the herb dill dressing.
Two for six, eight.
Who do we appreciate?
Ten.
11.
Twelve ingredients there.
So you're talking about almost 20 ingredients just to make that recipe.
Yeah.
Nobody in here by mine is going to do that.
You ever make Dill bread?
And as far as the foods to enjoy and foods to avoid, there's nothing new there.
There's nothing revolutionary.
This is Atkins all over again.
Only he throws in a few more vegetables.
That's all.
And not quite so much heavy on a fat.
It's just modified Atkins.
There's nothing at all new in here.
Like I said, I mean all diet books have got some recipes in here, right?
I've got a little bit of that.
But I would say about, I mean, from after the first 100 pages in here,
the whole rest of the goddamn book is nothing but a bunch of goddamn recipes.
It's a rip off.
How much is this piece of crap?
24.95 US 34.95 Canadian A that I wasted my money on.
Jesus Christ and Joseph went to the South Beach diet.
And I see I'm glad that the one con we had, he's probably the only one we even got the book in our audience.
I'm glad it's still a mouth for him, but for me, forget about it.
I'm just I'm forming at the bottom.
I'm so tired of fat people, including me being exploited by people who want to pedal some goddamn book.
Whether it's Suzanne Summers, you know, I don't, I don't want to be grudge doctor bomb because he's dead anyway.
Right.
No, and he wasn't a nice guy.
You're right. He was kind of a schmidhead and a real arrogant butt butt.
But the fact of the matter is he was way ahead of his time.
How many years ago he came up with that concept?
The idea that these refined carbohydrates turned to sugar in your body and they're going to kill you.
And he's right.
And he was absolutely right.
And now that he's dead, they're saying, oh, you know what? It really works.
Oh, what a deal.
And your triglycerides come way down and your car cholesterol comes way down without taking those dangerous statin drugs.
In fact, that's another thing.
This doctor in here, he's a pile of those statin drugs.
He takes them.
Dr. Arthur Aguizen.
You remember Dr. McColley Kilmer Culkin, whatever his name was?
Yeah, yeah.
With a homocysteine and a fall of folic acid.
He tells you about the dollars they're killing you.
All those statin drugs, a zochore and the lova statin and the premise statin and the up your ass statin, statin island.
All of that crap, all of these things.
What am I getting worked up about?
I'm just tired of people being exploited because we're fat.
Give us something to eat.
There you go.
Yeah, give us something good to eat.
Dammit, how would all this other crap?
I'm in the local, this is five cities.
There are years old yours now.
You in!
That's a very undabossed.
Then it just says joke.
10, 30, 5, 60, WQ.
I am happy.
A Thursday too.
Don't forget Miguel's out there.
Now we'll want to clock ding and dead solutions.
370 South Dixie Highway, Northeast Corner, Les Soun, US 1.
First 10 people to make the $20 donation to the band of Per Rescue and get some of our crap.
Get a pair of tickets to the heat Detroit Pistons gained overnight opening night at the Mickey Irison Arena.
One of 422 arenas in stadiums.
We're going to be having a rendezvous, very soon.
So let's see, now the mo actually beat Old Ron and Young Paul.
In that first hour, can you believe that?
See, I need the numbers for big, would be helpful.
That would be really good.
Those hourly is for big WBGG.
Hello, big ones.
We can see Howard Spurm and who's side by eight.
You see what I'm saying?
Wouldn't that be nice?
Sure.
Did you see the whopping September that we had?
Yes.
That's pretty huge.
Huh?
Pretty huge.
Oh, and that's 10 to 3.
Right.
8.9.
I mean, we did over in the eye.
Well, that's nothing new.
We always used to do that.
Now that we're back intended to, now that we're back in the right time slot,
now that Greg has come back to us senses.
So don't be dicking around with it no more.
This year, in fact, this coming year, that's a New Year's resolution for 2000 and 4.
Don't mess with a lineup no more.
That good idea?
Okay.
No, seriously, just at least through the next year, leave it alone.
Don't keep tinkering and tinkering and screw it around.
The audience likes familiarity.
Even if it's somebody they hate.
Look at Mo.
Absolutely.
They can't stand it, but now they've been there for a while.
They're warming up to them a little bit.
Not much.
5.3 in a 6 o'clock hour and the Ron and Ancien Paul, who hate me like Poison,
and by the way, the feeling is mutual and you're still like a higher Paul.
5.0.
So we beat him like a little bit then they just kick ass.
Look at that.
6.9 at 7 o'clock, 7.48.
As opposed to Mo's week 4.7 and the 4.8 and 5.3.
You follow those numbers?
No.
So from 7 to 10, they just kicked our ass.
So that's something to be said for them.
I have no idea why.
I'm going to show what?
Promote it because it's on FM.
FM.
FM.
That might have something to do with it as in flying mattress.
So we'll get those big numbers.
I'm sure I'm sure that Muff is working on it feverishly right now.
A Fox sports, they didn't do squat.
They had Tuesday midday because they were a non-sports show.
So the sports nerds, some of them went over there.
But other than that, they didn't do crap.
But boy, we sure had an impressive September all the way around.
That's nice.
Now let's see.
Here's a look.
Should we dispense with that chronic in Miramar?
Here's Miramar.
Hello.
Hi, I'm Colin about a facility.
Something about the Southeast diet.
A friend of mine who I work, his mother actually wrote it.
And this doctor that's on the book's name, he just bought it for Miramar.
So he doesn't even really, you know, he didn't even come up with this thing.
It's just some normal lady that just kind of changed around the act into that.
You know what I mean?
So it's all about the way.
Absolutely.
That's what I have to say.
Thanks for the info, Pali.
You're welcome.
Now why did you put chronic on there?
We never heard from that guy before.
Oh, I know why Scott put him on there because he's trying to get my attention because he wants to thank the hell of the police department.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's never supposed to say something.
I'm giving you that opening.
You can drive a Mack truck through it there.
Well, they have a freight train which they never stole through it.
Yeah, they're still all right with us.
Okay.
In other words, he got the, in fact, both Scott's got speeding tickets this morning.
Our Scott and Farrell both got speeding tickets.
I drove past them.
I thought they were supposed to speeding ticket.
What do you give you a ticket for being a lady early in the morning?
You can't get your ticket.
I'm taking redress.
Thank you, pardon.
Now this is interesting.
George and company.
It's not for Neil and company.
Thank you, Anthony.
Good morning.
I have a pool idea for you.
Maybe you think so too.
Most embarrassing moment.
Yani, yani, yani, yani.
Mitz and son, right?
Not bad, Mitz and son, right?
I'll put it under my pile of poles, under my pool pile.
I was starting to say before we get interrupted by Scott who wants to suck up to the hell in the police.
Don't suck up too much, any Rosenberg will sick him on your ass, okay?
And then you really be in deep crack.
I'll make a note of it.
The interesting part about our pool against the Harold Pool.
Now there's a pool on the Harold website, which I'm assuming was in the sports section of the paper.
Or maybe it's one of those poles that's only on their website.
I don't know.
But obviously it appeals to the sports nerds because you have to click sports
and go to the sports crap in order to get the sports.
Right.
And the question they ask is, should the Marlins get a new stadium?
3,110 people voted as of about an hour ago when I printed this out.
No way they don't need it, 145.
5%.
But you notice, should the Marlins get a new stadium?
They're not saying how they're going to get it, who's going to pay for it?
So the question is, worded week, although not with taxpayer money, 811, 26%.
Sure, they did so well, I don't mind paying.
Right.
1,051, 34%.
And only if they don't dismantle the team, 113 votes, 35%.
So they're positive, 69% to 31%.
You see what I'm saying?
69% say, oh yeah, sure.
Sure.
As long as they don't take the team apart and they're willing to lose that extra $40 million
next season, which I'm really dubious about that.
Our poll, we had 1159 votes, which is pretty good considering it's only one little crappy
AM radio show in a goddamn prestigious Harold had 3,110 votes.
See?
Mm-hmm.
It's not too bad, really.
Plus a lot of our people can't vote on this thing because a lot of our people are
fools and they have AOL.
I'm sorry about that.
Get with it.
Get rid of AOL.
They suck it.
Who should pay for a new stadium for the Marlins we asked, 1159 votes?
Only the team owner is 513.
44.2% almost half people said, oh yeah, they want to build it great.
We'll maybe show up and maybe not, but who cares?
No stadium, no way, Jose, 180 people, 15.5%.
The suckers in Dade, 166.
Incredible.
14.3%.
Only people who don't speak English, 164.
14.1%.
The taxpayers only 79.
That's only 6.8% of our audience said, oh yeah, one of the taxpayers should pay for the stadium.
And only the people who go to the games, 57, 4.9%.
Out of 1159.
Now some of the people would respond by saying, well that's because it's your show kneel and you're so negative.
Well what is the last time that anything that I had to say had anything to do with the result on our pool?
I mean once in a while I'll agree with the result, you know, the end result of the polls.
No, usually they vote the opposite, just to be bastard.
No, no, I mean they vote however they were, way they feel they're all anonymous.
It's anybody who's out there in Radio Land, they don't follow the leader, they don't go step along.
I only wish that I could go step them along.
What did I mention and we beat the crap out of rush?
Not at all.
I glossed by this, which I shouldn't have done.
I still don't have those big hourly's, which I'm sure, you know, it's a little beyond my experience.
They're cooking them up right now.
Are they cooking them?
Yes.
Well, no, seriously, you want to know the rush numbers?
From noon to three, we had a 7.7 share, a 7.5 and a 7.3, okay?
Okay.
I OD at a 6.0, 7.167, we beat them all three hours.
That was when he was still on it before he went into it to dry out.
Love it.
I wonder what Todd Rex is going to think about that.
Oh, rush beat Niel.
Yeah, he hates you too, Todd.
In fact, rush limbaugh.
Either without the Aussie con.
He's the entire QM sales department told me so personally before just before he went in.
So anyway, look at those big numbers, but we're pretty pleased with that.
In fact, it was a smash-ass book.
I noticed that the queue went down, but I like to look at the listenership one way off,
which means we have a lot of very loyal listeners out there.
I love that.
Huh?
Yeah.
Thank you so much and keep it up, baby.
We need your help because believe me, we got Greg Reed.
And don't forget, you're invited to the QM party tonight, the ratings party.
Right, it's going to be at...
Nuh-uh.
It's going to be in Pepperpines to a PM.
Right.
Right?
Well, we can't identify anybody.
I don't know if it's a low budget operation, we might have a bunch of free-loader show-up.
Maybe the guy with the eyes would show up, maybe that crazy, the guy with the hands, they can't get away.
Huh?
They can't come in anyway.
Why not?
The place will be closed except for us.
Well, that's what you think.
They'll knock the dough down to get in.
Now, what's for all bringing his 34-seater?
No, no, the employee's only.
He was threatening to bring her in.
I know, I talked him out.
He's going to leave the rest of her home, but he's bringing her in.
No, bitch is allowed.
Oh, then SCRAN can't be there.
Oh, she's an employee.
Oh.
SCRAN's book.
It's going to pass that South Beach diet like it was standing still.
I'll get back to that book because it really pisses me off.
Now, the guy that called, he was right.
In all fairness, in fact, I even eared Dog God, Dog Year, marked it.
Dog here.
I think I did.
Yeah, here it is.
It's got two pages.
Foods to enjoy.
Foods to avoid.
Well, that's great.
Like foods to avoid, starters and carbs, bread, cereal, manta, oatmeal, rice, all types, pasta, all types, pastry and baked goods, all types.
How about candy?
How about bread?
And if you're looking at foods to enjoy, candy is hard, sugar-free, chocolate powdered, no added sugar.
What is chocolate powdered?
A cocoa powder?
No, no, chocolate powdered.
All right.
Next is cocoa powder baking type.
Just enjoy it.
Sure.
But little to 75 calories a day.
Fudgicle sugar-free.
Those are actually pretty good.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
I'm going to give you a little bit of sugar.
Now, the longest running motion picture musical in history has been reimagined for the 21st century.
Cherry Brookheimer presents Sylvester Stallone in.
Yo, how you doing?
I see you met my faithful handyman.
You're pulling the rocky horror picture shell.
You're pulling the rocky horror picture shell.
You're pulling the rocky horror picture shell.
You're pulling the rocky horror picture shell.
You're pulling the rocky horror picture shell.
You're pulling the rocky horror picture shell.

You're pulling the rocky horror picture shell.
Then I hope to the right.
You'll make your way through a rice of me.
Has it just got married rocked?
Yeah, but make your way through a rice of me.
To load his bag as Rocky Fender Boa.
The rocky horror picture shell 2003.
Absolutely.
Coming really, really strong.
Straight to radio.
Absolutely.
1046 and 560 WDQM Happy Thursday to it.
Should we take that call on the Gables?
Yes, sir.
Coral Gables, hello.
Coral Gables.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
How are you doing?
How is your vacation?
It was excellent.
All right, so when storage coming back?
He's not.
I mean, I think you're doing for another vacation.
Yeah.
Get off.
Why is he hired?
We only get assholes from Coral Gables.
I was just thinking that before I punched it up.
I thought it's required to call from the Gables
because we never, I don't think in all the years I've been on the year,
we ever had like a rational calling from Coral Gables.
No.
It's always some Ojramprovakad through asshole.
I think it's an ordinance, city ordinance.
Is that what it is?
You must be an asshole in Coral Gables.
I'm sure that's possibly what it is.
And keep it to that.
That's the explanation.
Just like they don't lot of them like Noah.
Pick up trucks and you're a driveway and Noah ducks and Noah peacocks and Noah rational people.
Team to become Miami Marlins of stadium is built in the city.
The Florida Marlins are agreed to change their name to the Miami Marlins
that the city builds the World Series Champions in New Ballpark.
That was for you.
That probably was.
That was probably Dr. Aguttsden's a boyfriend.
Wait till I read the, this little blurb.
You know, in the back inside the leaf cover.
Arthur Aguttsden MD is a cardiologist who has served on committees of Yadi Yadi,
and this and that.
He lives in Miami Beach with his wife, sorry, and their two children.
That's how they are.
Sorry.
He ought to say I'm sorry.
This is the number one New York Times bestseller of the South Beach diet.
The delicious Dr. Design full proof plan for fast healthy weight loss.
If you've got about 40 hours a day to go in a kitchen and just cook up a storm.
Or if you want to go eat it all of his favorite restaurants like Joe Stone Crab.
And not only does he list the restaurants, but there's the picture of the executive chef.
And some of the restaurants he's got like their whole life story in there.
Like the blue door at Delano at the 1685 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach
with the executive chef Elizabeth Barlow.
And a whole story about the cuisine and the decor and where the tea rooms are.
And here's the China Grill for Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.
Christian Plotchick.
He'll make your pots.
He's the chef there, whatever.
And what is that?
Whoever heard of such a thing.
So in other words, if you live on South Beach or anywhere within driving distance,
you can really get some of these like the Asian Parasalad of the China Grill.
The Roomy Supper Club, a 330 Lincoln Road Miami Beach with the executive chef Scott Ferdell
and JD Harris, who looks a little bit like Roy.
Wow.
This is a fraud as far as I'm concerned.
From where my ass is sitting, this book to me is, I'm not saying that it couldn't work for you.
But what's new here?
What's the deal?
Foods to enjoy lean cuts of beef.
Woo!
Sirloyne, tenderloin, top round, poultry, all types of fish and stuff.
We already know this.
This is Atkins all over again.
With a few more vegetables in the beginning and with not quite as much fat.
It's exactly.
It's just a rip off of the Atkins.
Dr. Bob is rolling in his grave.
And this is the number one New York Times bestseller because those fat people are desperate.
Team President David Samson said that date County and Miami City officials requested the name changes part of the negotiations for new stadium.
It was something Marlon's owner, Jeffrey Loury, and I had no problem with Samson said yesterday.
It was not a negotiating point.
You know what else he said?
We won the World Series.
That's what he said.
Wait.
And people couldn't put, they were a gas.
They were shocked at the sound of that voice.
We won the World Series.
They were just, their eyelids were drooping.
Miami City manager Joe Ariola said yesterday that the name change has been part of the negotiations all along.
It has to be Miami Marlon's and that's all there is to it.
They agreed to it.
But that's it.
Like it or not.
Stuff it.
Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penga-Pakania has said any stadium deal will be predicated on changing the name from Florida to Miami.
So I guess we have to have the, uh, brow, if that's the case, let's play hardball.
Hard puck, right Scott?
Sure.
How about the, the Broward Panthers?
Right, Alex.
Right.
Or the, uh, Sunrise.
How about the Sunrise Panthers?
Then arenas in the city of Sunrise.
Yes.
Sunrise Panthers.
They really blow, huh?
They're going to beat the Sunrise Panthers.
But when I head home Saturday, let's all get together and go what?
They're going to beat the Sanders tonight.
No, they're not.
Five one again.
I already have my premonition.
Out of a five Panthers one.
I hate to say that because I like to see him do well.
I like to see hockey stick around in Florida.
But it's just, uh, you know, it's like bowling in Czechoslovakia.
It just doesn't compute.
Here's the poll question for today.
Oh, and, and the guy that called yesterday, it was giving me a lecture just like his last asshole from the Gables.
A lot of assholes out there, which we enjoy a lot on the show.
That's one of the reasons so many people listen.
Uh, it was giving us a lecture about, well, you know, there's four billion dollars a year for the Brideg County School Board.
The, the story about, uh, by the Amtus Buddy Nevins, the today's Sun Sentinel.
Lack of money delays, mailings of 80,000 Broward voter cards.
I realize that's in Broward, you know.
It's just a classic example of the kinds of things that we don't have money for in Dayton Broward and Palm Beach.
And all over the place.
So get your priorities straight.
That was what I would suggest.
Here's today's poll question.
What song is so annoying you never want to hear it again?
Now, I don't, I really probably shouldn't say what inspired me for this poll.
Oh, come on.
So it's one of our spots, which we just got through playing with one of our fine spots, which I'm sure I don't know what the music or maybe they did.
I just, I don't want to hear this no more.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, one more time.
What?
One more time.
No, this is how it works.
I'd rather, I'd rather croat.
I'd rather go eat at the edge.
You know, Stonecred.
I'd rather go buy another copy of this book.
I could do this on the table.
I'd rather sell, you know, that's sour horn.
There's nothing worse than a sour horn, believe me.
Ooh, I'm gonna play along with my comb and paper.
That is it.
Oh, right.
Hey!
Hey!
I lost it.
Okay, that's enough.
Oh, man.
That was my choice.
I don't want to hear it.
I can't understand it.
It's part of the whole prefabricated world that America has become.
Everywhere you go, every stadium, every venue, even you go to a meal.
You know what somebody has a birthday party?
They're gonna start playing that.
Rock and roll part one, Gary Glitter, and the other one that came to mind was proud Mary
from CCR for back in my Zeta Days.
I added two.
Okay, let's hear what they are.
Sweet home Alabama.
Oh, come on.
I like sweet home Alabama.
Oh, huh?
I'm sorry.
But again, that's your choice.
Growing up in the South, they just beat you to death.
Sweet home, they like that in Tampa, man.
And just a minute, Leonard.
I'm right knees down, Leonard's skinnered.
I'm sure I spelled it wrong when I fasted it's Eric.
I don't care.
And Funky Town by Lipsink.
Funky Town?
Yeah.
Where do you hear that?
It just never went away.
Why do you just don't like disco?
That's your pro.
Oh, I like disco a lot.
Don't get me wrong.
You don't like Funky Town.
I don't like Funky Town.
Okay, there you go.
The next one is the form to get you started.
I gave that one.
Or a list and we'll put that up there.
We can take the other one off of the area and get this thing going.
Get this turkey going.
Anyway, here's that story by the anxious, obnoxious buddy, Nevens.
Election supervisor, Miriam Olipins office is so far behind in its work that new registration cards have been mailed since mid-July,
leaving about 80,000 Broward County residents without their voter identification.
80,000.
We have a backlog conceded Bruce Elridge, the elections office director of computer systems.
He said the office ran out of money for the printing of registration cards and postage in mid-July.
The office has fielded hundreds of angry phone calls from voters waiting months and months for their cards according to a state report released last week that was highly critical of Miriam Elephant.
The voter cards should begin to be mailed after next week's mailed in election now that the office has received money from the County Commission for New Fiscal Year that began October 1, Elridge said.
Newly registered voters and those who changed the regressor party affiliation will need the cards to vote in the special primary election in Florida House District 91 on January 6 and the general election January 27.
This, by the way, is the same office that we had this through a couple of days ago, have been setting out extra ballots.
Some people, like two or three or some people got it.
The whole ballot, the extra one, that somebody that didn't get theirs.
Also waiting for new cards or voters in as many as 50 precincts that have been changed because the old polling places didn't accommodate the disabled or the landlord no longer wanted to make the property available.
Elephant did not, of course, return her calls to her office for comment. How do you like that?
One of those waiting is Jay Marcus, a team of plantation, his mother Sharon Marcus, said her son registered to vote in May.
When the card didn't arrive, she began calling elections office and was told there was a backlog.
They said there was no money, no money, no money, Sharon Marcus recalled three times in her, no money.
Mitch Myers' plantation went to the elections office more than two months ago and it switches registration and went independent to Republican, bad movement.
He never received a new card, thank goodness.
So we visited the elections office earlier this month, asked what happened. He was told the card was printed but couldn't be mailed to him as required by law because of lack of money.
He still don't have it, Meyer said, which is good because he's a Republican now.
But how do you like that?
Lack of money, 80,000 people in Broward still waiting for their voter cards.
What's that mean? What's 80,000 votes in the country that's got that?
You know, such honest elections.
So there you go. There's just one example out of thousands and thousands and thousands of examples in day, Broward Palm Beach, every damn county in America.
This really, this really cracks me up.
Mimeo official zeroing in on orange bull as area side of the stadium.
It's right, possible new sites are being checked out for the Florida, soon to be Mimeo Marlins but the talk keeps returning to one spot.
The orange bull. You go ahead.
You'll love the tea rooms there. I'll tell you that.
City manager Joe Areola said yesterday the area around the orange bull and perhaps the stadium itself, which University of Mimeo football team calls home, is a top contender.
It's a big consideration. We could fix the orange bull, rearrange the orange bull, build next to the orange bull or probably a better idea, just blow that damn thing up.
I can love this sports 20 or 560.
You way out.
Howard David's a bitch.
Good morning.
I'm on a home lies at the heart of the American dream.
It serves as the foundation of many Americans financial security and the good news is this less than half of all African Americans and Hispanic Americans are homeowners.
We must prevent minorities from owning a piece of the American dream.
So I have asked the Congress to join me in creating a second obstacle to minority homeownership, permanent complexity and difficulty of the purchasing process.
But government action isn't enough. That is why I've challenged the real estate industry leaders to join with the government in a major nationwide effort to increase abuse even on scrupulous lenders with an overriding and urgent mission, prevent minorities from owning a piece of the American dream.
And we are doing just that. Thank you for listening.
You're welcome. It's love that I wanted 560 WQM. How's Miguel doing out there at thing in the then place height heard yet?
Well, then some to promising Miguel from now at a lot of clock is a ding and dent solutions.
370 South Dixie Highway that's on the north east corner of Lijun in US one.
That's a hot bit of our audience right there and it's slow.
Huh? First 10 people to make that $20 donation to a band of per rescue get a pair of tickets to see the heat pistons opening night game tomorrow at the Mickey Air Center arena at the place where nobody wants to go and they're doing a good job of doing that.
OK, how's that pool coming? What song is so annoying you never want to hear it again?
Funky Tonets, Georgia's choices leading out of 19 votes. It's early running. Got a lot more to get on air eight votes.
Rock and roll part two Gary Glitter five. Shame on you. Sweet home Alabama Leonard Skinner.
You didn't spell it right five and proud Mary CCR's only got one. Scott actually had a couple of good suggestions.
OK, let's go. Side by self. The macarena. Oh, macarena by the look of the macarena.
Low still Rio. Ooh. And who let the dogs out? Oh, the Bahamas. Yeah. Who let the freaking dogs. Oh my god. I got another one. Yeah.
Who let the dogs out the Bahamas. I'm just right now. I don't mean to write these down to you. No, you don't. You're right.
There's another good one for you. Yeah. Don't worry. Be happy. Bye.
Oh, that. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That. That.

the hero always is in position of trying to foist over into public anything that they think
is good for them.
Not what's good for the county or what's good for South Florida, like the metro rail,
and like a lot of other crap, and like a lot of corrupt politicians like Jabbush, for
example, all of these things.
I mean, it's just amazing to me how the public just sits there and it's almost like they
love the taste of crap.
You know what, they can't get enough of it.
Have a little ketchup and mayo for that place.
Mmm, that's delish.
Looks like...
Maybe that's in Dr. Aguidston's book too, how a little bit of that crap.
This book makes me want a pupe.
I could write a diet book if I want to rip off Bob Atkinson who better than this.
Well, it's all the rage.
Go for it.
I would like just once in my life to buy a freaking diet book and probably, you know,
and just have no recipes in it.
Nobody is going to cook those recipes.
Am I right?
Even women aren't going to cook those recipes.
No way.
Fact people are going to spend hours in the supermarket loading up the cart with this
kind of crap because when you're in a market, that's a thing.
You were staying to be in because there's all kinds of good stuff in there too.
Guess what I had yesterday.
Uh, for the Hagen-Daz rocky road.
Oh, why would you do that?
Here's a call from Boca.
Hello.
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
I'm like that song.
The business.
What is it?
I hate it too.
One piece of raping day.
I hate it when I hear it again.
I'm going to kill somebody.
Call me back on a real phone, pal.
Your phones are crap.
Crap it out.
Can we hear from a guy?
Are you all yet?
No.
Probably because he's lined.
They got a line there from here all the way to Alacuipa.
They're lined up by the side by each.
Could be.
Here's a call from Deerfield.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
The Pope's Moan's belt.
No, that's what we have here is an asshole on the phone.
Guy.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Yeah, this song that I can't really don't want to hear no more, believe it or not,
I'm 46 years old.
I was in high school.
I was a kid.
I heard it quite often.
You know.
And then for 25 years, I don't hear it again.
And then 9-11 happened.
And that's God bless America.
I mean, I really wish there was a stop plane at it.
You were going to throw up on Kate Smith kicked off.
That would have given them the message.
You know what?
I mean, that song, every time you go to any sporting event, you turn on ATV, anything.
That's all that's singing it.
That's song now.
I mean, you know, it's nothing, not by really.
It really makes me sick in hearing that song.
And I love my country.
You know, it'll get me wrong, but I just think the song is just an inappropriate,
different, you know.
It's just a different story.
But nothing's enough.
Okay, pal, we got the message we could put it down.
Just God bless America.
We don't have to put any artists.
We could put Kate Smith, but he just means in general.
Right.
Don't get it going on Kate.
She ain't feeling too good.
At least, they're not still doing that at the flyer games, which is the reason they're
not going to go anywhere, even though they're hot right now.
They're not playing that like they used to.
They got the Gene Hart's daughter singing the national anthem on my right, Scott.
Yes.
You know, Gene Hart, the great flyer, broadcaster, rest in peace.
And you know what he died from?
You know what he was?
What?
Fat.
Too many tasty cakes.
Gene Hart, he's dead.
Fat kills.
I don't want to talk about it because the audience gets really restless and psychotic when
I do.
But there was an article that we put on a website either yesterday that they before
about how fat has now passed all the other ailments, illnesses, health problems.
Fat is number one.
Wow.
We're number one, baby.
Are you ready for that?
Fat is the number one killer in America.
Forget about smoking.
Forget about all of those other things.
We did it!
Get out of here.
Here's one.
Here's a fact that says, and I see when you send me a list like this, I can't deal with
it.
Can you?
No, that's why I want you to rip this guy.
Okay.
I'm not going to do it.
Now, see, the question is, what song?
Now, and I said I'd give you like a couple because, you know, this is tough to do only
one.
But I mean, to send me a whole list of it, it's stupid is what it is.
Plus satisfaction about the stones.
Well, they're having quite a counter-tomp, so you're about the stones because they're
new, uh, big shots CD that they put out.
Yeah.
This special package deal.
They're only selling it at best buy and one other joint.
They got like some kind of a special deal going on with them.
And so HMV and the other big record chains, even though they came into that benefit concert
in July or whenever the hell was here in Toronto, they're like, they're not going to carry
it.
And the best buy stores are also considering maybe not going to carry it because they're
all distributed by the same whoever it is.
So they're pissed off at the stones.
Loving you by many repetitions is filling curl springs.
Loving you.
Yeah, that's good.
Sure.
I don't hear it that often.
Of course, I know any of this that often is analysts of the radio.
Boy, your life is so much better when you're listening to the radio except for the station.
Don't you agree?
Absolutely.
In South Carolina.
You're like, well, you're in the crap if you listen to any other radio station but
QAM and if you listen to music on radio on FAM.
Other markets have good radio.
But not South Florida.
Listening to FM and South Florida.
Although, well, I don't want to go into my good friend.
And by the way, we still don't want to hire you, old Paul.
We still want to hire you.
PD Lenny ain't going to be calling me anymore to try to get you hired at QAM.
Oh, he'll hire.
Lire, liar.
Funky town.
They're just sucking up to you.
That they were.
How?
Everybody.
Funky town.
Yeah, it's like torture.
It is, but I don't hear it because I was just.
37 votes.
Funky town's got 12 by Lips Inc.
Rock and Roll part two.
Gary Glitter's got eight.
Sweet home Alabama.
Leonard Scott.
I like sweet home Alabama.
I know it's a red neck.
He saw.
I like to two the first 5,000 times.
Seven votes for Leonard Skinner.
Any of them still live?
Maybe the manager.
No.
Proud Mary CCR.
They're still rolling rolling in though.
Six votes for his season.
Now seven just to win up or whatever.
No six.
What else we got on here?
Don't worry.
Be happy.
But I'm just one zero and he don't have the other one like Macarena.
They're not here yet.
We'll get to them.
They're built.
We'll build it.
What?
Macarena.
That's seven.
Oh, like I said, there it is.
It's way up near the top.
Macarena's already got seven.
Good choice.
5, 6, 7.
How about those Miami Marlins?
Lips here for them.
Huh?
Let's hear it for the Florida Heat.
And that's a good idea because nobody cares about that anyway.
Yeah.
I just lend a Robertson article.
I'm just chopping it to bit to read it.
But I'll postpone it a little bit because I don't want to be too negative.
You know, I don't want to pee on everybody's parade because there's still a little bit
moist from all the euphoria from Tuesday.
Here's a call from Coconut Creek.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to put on any song parody that you've played before you come on.
I mean, I love you, but those song parodies, you play them so much because, and then George
plays them and then you have that hour and Wednesday.
So any song parody.
That's not a song.
That vocal Brian's music.
The guy.
You know, that's the same thing.
I just mentioned him.
I said, huh?
Someone came up.
Nice for him.
Nice going.
That's a Hunter.
Brian was recording.
He died or he went away.
And I conjured him up.
Yeah.
I conjured him up just like a like genie on.
Yeah.
I cast a spell.
I conjured him up out of the dead.
That's the vocal Brian haters.
Your sir, vocal Brian's got more talent is little finger in his, uh, you'll ever have
in your whole life.
Okay, you sad loser.
You pathetic.
Well, and George plays them too, which probably pisses off the guy to Gables.
Oh, yeah.
The guy to Gables.
He just wants you to sound to your voice.
He just wants to bust my ball.
Yeah.
That's fine.
Hey, listen, you see, since I come back from vacation, you know, this I have adopted
even more of a dramatically different attitude.
I really mean that.
I just, I don't give a flying crap about any of it.
I really, I should you.
After all of these years, which is close to, but I know what should I care what these
assholes have to say.
You know, I mean, it's, uh, it's just, it's a venting place for a, for a sputum is what
it basically is.
And every once in a while, you get somebody who actually has something to say and you
say, wow, what a novelty.
But other than that, you're low expect much to do the show in your boxers.
We don't expect much in quite frankly.
The folks never let us down.
Now, here's a, what does that mean?
A call from Ding and Dent.
Is this Miguel?
Hey, Miguel.
No, I just picked up my, uh, key chain and my tickets for Sunday's game.
I want to bless you, sir.
Thank you for those awful tickets.
Was it the dolphin tickets?
Oh, boy.
Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty pound.
And we're not getting any calls from Miguel.
So maybe he left already.
I mean, if that guy can call from there on his cell, you think Miguel would have called
and give you like a little report like there's going to be here.
And the folks are working again, Miguel.
No, they're not.
I was still working on it.
It's just, it's like it throws me a little bit off.
I don't make any excuses if it's a slightly substandard performance by yours, truly.
But it just, it throws you a little off when you look at that thing and it's like, what
is that thing I'm talking about that black square, you know?
Yeah.
It's been reported.
That's the one where Vincent Price is supposed to be sitting.
Here's higher.
Leah, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got a song for you.
I got that one.
Okay.
I think I'm wrong.
That they play in the stadium every freaking game.
That's what I should be on the list.
You mean, that one?
Yeah, beat the crap size.
The beat that I am in as it all funs.
The greatest football team.
We take the ball from Cole to go.
Like no one's ever seen.
Oh wow.
We're in the air.

hate that song yeah that is a good one
that's my who sings that Billy Ray Cyrus Billy Ray well see i wouldn't know
because he's a nose picker is there really some reason is it is it a genetic
thing that's why that the country people country western i've
mentioned this many years ago which is one of the reasons i can't stand most
country music there's like some kind of an effective gene
yes and they all kind of look like a little bit off
the country in breeding it's not a stereotype yeah it must be it must be it
i mean if you ever seen like a really a good looking country western male or
female or i mean tonight a twin okay but she's an exception she's an alien
she's Canadian a does seem some good looking uh hit chicks

jingle bells by the parking dog don't know
because once once they get the stars that stuff goes
oh that'll just there's not a station that doesn't play him
it's enough to make a wish religion would just go away okay thanks a lot pali
thank you to go choices how about this one
but he's right and they just playing out of the ground all i must say that
because of commercial necessity because the big box
are far bigger and much more important now than they used to be years ago
i mentioned this every year we don't get going down like the youth so much huh
now these to start the whole christmas thing like uh in early november
yeah and man no matter what channel you turned on do it was the same crap and uh
oh and i don't mind seeing a christmas carol every year with uh
alistair sim that's the definitive one of course of course
but uh jesus and not everybody's in that just like that crap with the pope
they it's so disrespectful man there are a lot of us who aren't Catholic
and think he's a silly old man in a dress who's being schlepped around like
some kind of an object and a chair and at the whatever that thing that podium
he's a mobile well that too but they just can't stop but now like i said at
least they cut away back because they realized that the goyamaren is powerful
they used to be even though they got the presidency five six seven oh five
sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T there'll be other counts castry see like on
playboy channel you won't be getting that you might get something else
where are we going here's uh four-letter hello
meal yes sir how you doing it's morning pretty good
i got a song for you that is really annoying obnoxious
uh terrible and it just seems to never go away and that is ymca
and excellent choice okay thank you and have a great day sir why amc
and i've heard of people in fact the way that's the one i mean there's some
other ones like in the navy i kind of like in the navy because it pisses
all them semen off so that one we got to get on there ymca they also play
that it's sporting venues yeah along with it well the kind of yeah to kind of
play along with it because we know they're all going to take showers together
when the game is over and they'll be snapping them towels on each other's uh
back them parts they play a Yankee stadium little grab ass even a Yankee's
even a very state Yankee stadium they play in ymca when the ground screw comes out to uh sweep up
and yeah green innings it's choreographed they drive their rakes and they uh do the ymca
and the whole crowd does it did the home office of baseball and on the line does the Indian come
out there no they're not dressed up like that oh i see what is your what why not that's a good
a good marketing tool in fact we might be doing that in the new marlin stadium i think go for it
you know i'm not going to pee on anybody's parade if the people in day county are stupid enough
to do it go ahead have a good time you got your metro rail you got your sales the
panpanny sales thing go right ahead and the best part of it is they're thinking of extending
the metro rail all the way out there to this airport so they're could just as easy be a stop
right there by the orsable so we can all go to the marlin games on the metro rail what do you say
no because if you're driving like from Palm Beach county or Broward county it adds easy
and extra 30 to 45 minutes on your drive each way all depending on which way to cross line
because there ain't really no other way to get there all you could hop on the try rail
spill Collins in the air tonight somebody says the worst song ever completely awful
in fact it says the only thing good about it is your drop-in
which i think this guy's got a point we do like that a lot that's one of my all-time favorite
things is that dropping so there you go all in the air tonight
what we're dropping it fill Collins poor little Phil little munchkin ever see him together with
Maddie Bell same person Maddie has more did we get a report from Miguel yet yeah 180 oh well

halivine Tel Aviv wouldn't you no didn't do it didn't happen you folks are still playing very very
tight with m big bucks and a market man we had that big quarter do you see that oh yeah about the
huge third quarter and the dowels up 16 and the Nasdaqs up seven that's not too much
for the dowels all the way up to almost 9800 the Nasdaq 1943 it's almost enough to make you want
to go back in the market it's not not not almost enough to make you want to be a crazy person how about

280 at the adjoin i mean i i i put her we got her at the head of the pack we put her on her right away
and she still won't hang on i mean i realized you don't have to take him out of your busy day to do

what i still see her there like i said i want apology to the nice lady in my any because she's still there
hi Neil that was more fun though yes man hi the worst song the lean beyond my heart will go on from
the way i heard it yes i hate that song with a passion and i hate her too like poison and
Neil can i say one more song sir sure Whitney Houston my other song she screams i can't
remember the name of the song from the movie the bodyguard what is the name of that song George um
humm she thought she saw the song from um dolly partner well wait a minute i got my book what
the wind beneath my wings i can't remember the name of the song it's the one she she rewrote i will always
i will always love something something like bobby brown needs to slap that bitch around a
hell of a lot more oh yes thanks Neil thanks a lot sweetheart i apologize profusely for my
finger being the wrong place i wish i don't want to say the same thing in california but he never
apologized well he did apologize over and over again uh look at all these Whitney Houston songs
you give good head a good love she's bigger than the Beatles saving all my love for you how will i
know greatest love of all i want to dance with somebody who loves me didn't we almost have it all
didn't oh that's one that don't my songs all sound the same mm-hmm right boy oh boy she's got a lot
of hits for a bitch that just screams and whales and the carries on like a lunatic something in common
bobby brown with Whitney Houston oh yeah they got something coming all right i think what we
ought to do after he finishes off with her is like send him up to see Celine Dion and give her a what for
you know five six seven oh five sixty two excellent choices thank you sweetheart see there's so many
on here you know there's probably about a hundred at least and what's wrong with that now
other so we got two eighty yes that's not too bad we'll get up there we've got to get at least
five hundred used to we used to do a thousand on these it was like falling off a log no problem
those were the good old days those were the good old days and of course uh even on qa and we
used to do over a thousand on these van hits even the gelt can't understand what it is that's going
on we got these big ratings everybody in town is listening all the other people are working a
business are listening including old Paul and ancient Ron but uh the fact of the matter is that
you people are getting a little bit things are tight yeah that that was the reason to put that
tremendous third quarter uh goose there in the economy that the market is just barely in the
green today you see that yeah weak it's a little on a weak side i don't want to start being the
voice of gloom and doom even though i'm very very negative and a nasty guy in a son of a bitch and
things like that but it's sunny and beautiful here in Toronto let's give that Toronto weather what do you
say hey huh just to piss off those guys see we would give the south Florida weather but the fact of
the matter is we don't give the south Florida weather we don't care about the weather look back to
William praise sports station so i had no time during the day unless there's some major thing going
on like a hurricane but other than that and the only hurricanes we care about it gear to give
you to ball give me to ball like that crowd right but unless there's something major with the weather
going on we don't talk about it because that's i we don't care about the news on this station in
fact this is the only show you'll hear anything about the news if they're like dropping nuclear
weapons on homestead you'll only hear about it here this is the same station when they had the
world trade center being attacked that we're still talking about sports for another hour because
gellies are more on well let's talk about sports i mean what a call can we say about that

way he's still got those pictures on his heart it's dry unlike Roger Daltry was it Roger Daltry

The South Beach Guide is 2495 plus tax
Let's just round it off and say it's 25 bucks
If you donate 20 bucks and get one of our CDs
Or to Mohawar David Keychayner or whatever from a band and perescue on our website
So there you go instead of 25 it's only 20 and you saved the 5 bucks

They're in the same category with me for that pole box if there was somebody who you wish wouldn't have been born
In addition to which I'm like Wayne Newton he also became born knowing when he became a born again fanatic
Scott came up with another one even though he had the wrong artist
Okay
You light up my life
Debbie Boone
Oh my god the old Boone in the box
In fact that would make a lot of people happy
You know something that's the winner that's the definitive one right there
But it's good that we gave everybody a handicap
Right
I had to start for an hour and a half with all the other ones
Because that one is going to go shooting up the list
That is probably the most annoying piece of Schmidt that ever was laid on vinyl
I mean just an absolute piece of garbage
Well it's no wind beneath my wings
No that's a lot of John there
Betman will be having put that on there yet but let's get it on
A lot of people did that too
A lot of people did that too
I mean it was okay it was emotional and schmaltcy
But Jesus Christ bed I mean after the first 40,000 times maybe not 40 but
30,000 it just got a little bit freaking ponderous you know
Let me read the article real quick because I don't want to forgive it
Okay
Stady and politics jump aboard the bandwagon rights Linda Roberts in the yesterday's used to be prestigious Miami-Herald
The Marlins were in the middle of one last sweaty exuberant group hug Tuesdays
The World Series champs paraded through South Florida
Be fitting our fractured Megalopolis
The hometown team wasn't faded with just one parade but three in three different hometowns
Plans for a fourth on air boats through the Everglades were shelved through the scratchy uh scarcity of voters out there
Everybody especially the politicians wants a piece of the novelty item now which begs the question
The Marlins are too polite to ask
Where were you in no hope June, jaded July, hotter than Hades August and suspenseful September
We don't want to rain on their parade thankfully no retractable roof was needed on a clear day
But we have to wonder if we'll see so many baseball fans converging on Miami-Discume for the Marlins ever again
Would they consistently pack a new downtown ballpark or would they jump off this bandwagon as quickly as they jumped on
Would they turn off to see baby faced Miguel Corbira and rifleman Josh Beckett who plans to beg as many deer now as he did Yankees last week
If we build it would you come with the question that crystallized in state representative Ralph Arza's mind Monday night
He put it on a poster board and Miami City Commissioner Joe Sanchez held it up for the crowd paying homage to the Marlins at the Bayfront Park amphitheater
Yes we will they cheered
Now that would be a sight even more amazing than these Marlins the fickleness of South Florida's fans is what our government leaders have to weigh very seriously
Even as they work out the details of Marlins owner Jeffrey Laurie on a tentative stadium financing plan that was announced Tuesday night
There is no denying that this is a lousy sports town
South Floridaans may shake their tan fannies at Chicago, Boston, Detroit or New York but people their support their teams Rainer shine
Snow or drizzle winter lose except the Tigers we should be so lucky to have Steve Bartman in our stands we could use a few thousand more die-hards
The Marlins heat and panthers don't draw unless they're winning
The University of Miami football team only the best in the country for most of the two decades doesn't draw unless it's playing a name opponent
We lost the Fusion Soccer Club which is supposed to be a no-brainer with our diverse demographics
We lost the WNBA Soul our college basketball team struggles to fill seats
The dolphins have always been solid we like NASCAR NASDAQ tennis and golf tournaments but those come in bursts
What about the long haul over 162 game baseball season?
We ask our elected leaders to please think with a level headed not one inflated by visions of power elbow rubbing in the VIP suite or phony major league city and economic impact rhetoric
Your constituency is smarter this time around we hope
Go through too many of millions of hard earned tax dollars at for a for profit corporation run by an extremely wealthy man as you did for Mickey Erison
And his American Airlines arena and Wayne Hypinga and his national car rental the Anthocenter keep the communities endless needs and perspective
Laurie is an a tighter pinch of course as Marlins are projected to lose 20 million dollars this year
And he's got to come up with an extra 40 million just to keep this roster intact and he stuck with a lousy pro player stadium lease thanks to Wayne Hypinga
But a new 325 million dollar facility is not necessarily a magic bullet the fans have got to be loyal
The message from Arlen's management was cleared to his day if we don't betray you then don't betray us
I want to put everything to rest because I'm tired listening to the same question Laurie told fans
This is not 1997 this is 2003 we are not this meddling thank you
The politicians including three different mayors and the county commission cheer will come and resist getting on stage to do their best cheerleader impressions and take credit for for what?
Everything about the downtown celebration was so Miami late loud and cartoonish
Thank goodness for manager Jack McKinley doesn't have a posturing bone in his body
I thought you were going to introduce me as another mayor he said when he was finally got his turn to speak
Unfortunately the players didn't get an award in edgewise but we did see one Pierre JP and don trail will is rapping and dancing
We're number one y'all JP saying this unreferring team gave us a sweet October
Don't they deserve the same attitude from their fans starting an opening day she asked good collar by Linda Robertson
And she's got a thumb right on it the fickleness is out for the fans and there's no denying it's a lousy sports town you got it honey right on girl
5 6 7 0 5 60 you watched that you light up my life by Debbie Boone goes skyrocketing that's my prediction
I want to change my vote what song is so annoying you never want to hear it again the macarena 54

Yes you were saying the thing about unforgettable yeah is that it's really forgettable
I don't hear that much because I'm not listening to the radio I forgot about it and
Duff says that Maddie Bell is he can't find him he can't nail him down to get those big numbers for you that you want it
He's got to get those from Maddie Bell apparently a squeak Maddie got really tired of all these people like high boy and other people getting into the task camp program and locked everybody out
Yeah so now you got to see Maddie or see this even the operations manager in the program director that sounds a little bit arrogant to me Maddie
You little pips squeak or saw your little guys you know always trying to push your weight around which ain't much I'd step on his ass
I'd step on his ass and just threaten to like dig the cleats and until he gives the game a key like like in a fatso remember

Course no calls after this binge for revenge. Uh, I love it. I'm gonna get back at you right now
1233 at 560 to put a Q.A. So I thought that the number one New York Times best settle released this is on a book is the South Beach diet
But it's fat headed Dr. Phil who's well, it goes to show you birds of feather
I'll pull one over on the public together. Don't buy the South Beach diet book. Okay folks. It's a piece of crap by the Atkins book
At least it works
And at least he originated and he didn't rip it off from a dead man
Susie and Weston says I know exactly where Steve Keynes eating these days
We saw him at Chordy's last week where you get to dinner for something like 850 foods great though God would minute
And of course the Metro road goes right right. You don't have to drive that is correct
So you can sell your car and eat there all the time
Oh, let's say here now. This is interesting from Ricky who says
The island George correct spelling of Donca Shane not die while we got us spelled wrong under but it's so cute
Yeah, I've been birded-changed it German for thank you very much. Okay. Yeah, oh not pronounced Shane more like shurn
Is what Ricky says so she must be Truman you understand the Gestapo from stress
That's right Ricky. I'm a large Ricky
Esla Katlaya of course the Donca Shane the way she wrote it with a two little dots over the e which is that very Truman way
That Ricky like the letter that looks like a B but it's an S
B S like in Strasse, La Strait
You know I'm saying no. Oh, what have you never been there?
You never been anywhere George once your friend Alvin to take care of all these places
All the high spots he gets out of the back
What is good? Let's you use the apartment use the apartment
It's really a sad tale you know what
Yeah, it is a man who became a self-made millionaire and rose to the top
He used to be slim and in all those porn movies and had a lot of great ideas and big pair of balls and told everybody to screw up and
Screw magazine and screw this and then he did and then they screwed him
They nailed his ass to the wall and boy believe me in his case that took a lot of nails very long very long big spike a big spike
So it's kind of bad, but of course the QAM we don't feel too bad for him because well, you know why
280 votes and a lot of them don't have any yet, but they'll get there unforgettable by Natalie Culls god one
Let's go from the bottom
Muscrat love kept it in slameels god one. We've only just be gone Karen come on please a little snack would be nice
Anything how about one of them little cheese things? What do they call those?
Cheese stick five thoughts are really that good no not well. I like that, but you know you just unwrap them like in
By the way, by the way talk about an educational program. I don't want to get anybody nervous. Yeah
But you know the ones I'm talking about are the ones that are wrapped like in polyethylene just string cheese string cheese
The polyethylene
Because on a plane coming back from Amsterdam to Toronto
There was an interesting guy's in next was who was from Sweden and he's in like the
Marketing business and he knows all about the foods and packaging and the whole thing
And he was telling us that the polyethylene in which they packaged like cold cuts and cheese and stuff like that
That the cancer causing agents and there are much more harmful than even like the nitrites and stuff in the cold cuts
Because it leaches into the right whatever's inside of it
Remember I used to scream about the bottle water the people go out and they buy bought the cheap bottle water in those in those containers
We can actually smell the polyethylene
You can smell the cancer before he's there drinking it
And it's the same thing with this which I was never aware of so probably a good idea to go to the deli counter and get it sliced fresh
Whatever you're gonna buy and just just this suggestion based on a guy who seemed to know what he was talking about
Getting back to the pool. I'm so sorry. What inspired me could oh the string cheese. Oh Karen come on have a slice
Can't hurt

Allegedly told a black man that colors were allowed in the pool state officials said yesterday or today
Maybe should have changed the short a short
The incident happened in peri oh, yeah
A small town that faced protest in 2001 because another black man said he was told at the bar. They could only be served in the back
Attorney general Charlie Christ issued a subpoena today in the owners of the southern motel

Colors aren't allowed in the pool. Well, they don't want that dark rub it off and dirt enough the water right
Camey Patel the owner's wife said Thursday she hadn't received a subpoena
But the incident involved the white desk and no longer works at the motel
Patel did not identify the clerk but says she was told that the woman who had told black guest not the swim in a pool
We told her she couldn't do that because everybody's welcome here. She was the one. She was the one
right
Parkers hometown wasn't known it couldn't be reached for comment the incident brought protesters to town in the river
Al Sharpton went to the bar to meet with the owner

Gail Kaplan oh
At the Hala school for a remarking to nine year old Cheyenne Griffin you took a picture of your family and put it on the front of your folders
The incident happened October 17 during a spelling test the girls mother said
Kaplan also told the girl not to tell her parents who sensed that something was wrong when their daughter usually bubbling to talk about her school day and phone friends
When state-to-room after school was quiet the entire weekend the mother said
Hogan's Blair in her attorney Oscar Michelin who makes a hell of a tire not
Said Kaplan apologized to the family last week in a meeting with a principal
But with what attorney called a strange apology and hardly a comforting apology
Always joked with that way with my husband and family they quoted the teacher saying if I known it was Cheyenne I wouldn't have said it
Now the girl is distracted by having Kaplan as their full-time teacher mother said
She's nervous that she's gonna make a comment to her Hogan's Blair said Kaplan couldn't be reached for comment last night
The Department of Education inserted letter of reprimanded Kaplan's record one official said sensitive

The Reuters news agency reversed its policy against religious advertising yesterday
According to the Washington Post and agreed to carry a paid ad for the United Methodist Church
On its electronic billboard in New York's Times Square. We just have Pornow and Times Square. Now I got religionists
What is it previous to be directed the ad setting a corporate policy against pornographic political religious libelist misleading or deceptive advertising
Inleted to the name to Methodist officials yesterday
Reuters chief executive Thomas age glossary said he returned from a week's travel to order the controversy reported by the Washington Post on Saturday
The church had argued that it should have the same chance to speak in the commercial marketplace as business advertisers
