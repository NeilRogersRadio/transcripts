Neil, my queen, God!
Last night I dreamt of Canzaco
Just like he never let my side at all
I'd wait with Obey Canzaco
He showed me just how to handle the ball
I showed Jose how to vote
So Cancaco breath was kind of vote
I took off my clothes
He kept on his pleads eyes
I miss coming round through bass
And sliding into his face
Get the shower with Jose
My Spanish lullaby
I'll just scum back and jump forward
We got some leash from where I showed him the full little time
We got our fountain votes by the way, boy
But you're like that
I like it
Aren't you impressed?
I know what at 560 WQM Happy Wednesday
It's our Wednesday noon to 1 hour coming up
The Accommodi-Pen-Hour-Do-One
Aren't you thrilled with that?
Always
I know, I'm sure
I'm making a pretty good recovery from my little TIA
My minor stroke
Then nobody seems to understand too much about it
I guess if you never had one and probably don't want to
Believe me
No thanks
But I don't have one
How's the Humber doing?
We're getting the updates on him
I heard him yesterday afternoon
And he sounded like
What have I told you about him?
Very concerned on this part over here about the Humber
He sounds bad
Then I tuned in a little later
And I heard Josh Clarence Dero
And the beast talking about sounding bad
I heard them fillin' a hank of gone homesick
Can I just give you two words of advice?
Okay
Even though this audience rebels and doesn't want to hear it
Because they can't stand the truth
Two words of advice
Fat kills
Okay?
In other words
To make a long story short
Cut the crap
That's what we're going to talk about candy and sweets today
A little later on
Rogers, almond brittle
That's the brand
I guess pretty hard for me to think of a name like
No, God
Yeah, Rogers
Everything is Rogers, Rogers, cable, Rogers, candy
No, God
Rogers, but I'm assuming it's their real name
Former Major League slugger Jose Conzaco was sent to jail
Yes, today for violating his probation for a 2001 nightclub brawl
Can Seco 38 could be held until a March 17 hearing judge Leonard Glick rule
I wonder if he's kind of Larry Glick, do you think?
Who?
The judges should arrest warrant after being told
Can Seco failed to start anger control classes and community service
And had left Florida for longer than 30 days
Which were among the conditions of his probation
Yadi, yadi, yadi
I understand that I have to take responsibility
Can Succo said
I ask for the mercy and understanding of the court
He had some issues
He had some aircraft to take care of in California
But the banjo on his knee
Do we have to see Keith Obergman anymore?
No, please
If ever you talk about a guy that keeps resurfacing like a bad penny
I'm watching MSNBC yesterday afternoon, you want to know why?
I give up
Somebody has to
Oh, okay
And I'm watching there and it's when that fat jury knockman, that fathead guy is usually on between five and six
And I'm ready to turn the dial and they got the guest on there
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, a rack attack, a rack, you know
And it goes back and there's Keith Obergman again
Back to the scene of the crime again
Good God
This is a guy that used to be on CNN
ESPN
MSNBC first time
Fox News, Fox Sports
Everywhere to it
And this guy is like in his own mind legendary
He'd really pontificates and he talks in a very deep voice
And he has that serious look on his face
Like he really has something to say
And he was like, he doesn't
And you want to know why?
I give up
The proof of the fact he's got enough to say is he's a sports nerd basically
That's his background
Anybody that was ever on ESPN
I mean, they'll all do respect to the Humper
I mean, you know, don't really have a lot to see on MSNBC
So he's back on there again now filling in for a fathead
God
So like I said, we have no updates, we know my dog will be back today at one
We're glad he'll be back
And we think Hank will be back at three
But I'm serious, wasn't I the one to tell you?
Yes, sir
Not one of those people that's afraid to tell it like it is
Because I'm afraid I'm going to hurt somebody's feelings
Because you know, if somebody looks really bad or they're too fat
Somebody's got to say something like, you know, put down to them crispy cream
Do something or you could just watch him die
No, I don't want to do that
Now see, one of Hank's problems
I think his biggest problem is he's a schmuzer
You know what I mean? He likes, said, you know, I don't knock it
He likes going out to dinners with all his sports buddies
And they all come into town where he goes on the road
And that's his thing
So that makes it extra hard, how does it, somebody like that can lose weight
But the last time that I saw him, which was early January, man, he had just ballooned to...
Epic proportions, I mean, just enormous
Was that my imagination or my correct?
I didn't see him
Oh, see, that's a cop out again
Just know the cop out
What, Hank? Is that, and he's going to die, that's not a cop out
Well, that's nice, that's very nice
Don't we want to do something to try to destroy it?
We would get to, but just like Mama Cass put down a sandwich
I've gone through it before, you know, Gordish-Telton
I understand
But having just gone through this little minor stroke which is my last awakening, my last warning, that's it for me
That was my last chance
Next one, it's going to be...
Oh, I see
Canito, baby, I'm telling you that right now
Our poll yesterday, in fact, should we do the poll today first, be kind of a dismission that's going to be my last?
Or should we take this...
Huh?
What do I just do?
Yeah, but why was it still on there?
I was going to take a saw-line touring and McCarlis is so quick today, he was like, way ahead of me
Miami, when is this?
Hello
Yes, sir
How are you doing, you know?
Okay
Listen, I know that we're talking about Hank, the Humper
Yeah
You saw the movie, Austin Powers, don't remember?
This guy's looking so humongous, he started really like the bad bastard
Just how they had, they had Humper from now on
The fan-hunter, okay
See, this guy's making a joke out of it, it's no joke in matter, mister
It's no joke in matter
We're talking about bursting at the seams, we're talking about he could barely talk when I heard me yesterday, when I was down there last time and he was on
I heard him barely squeaking his way through the show
You know what happens when you get fat?
You die?
All year about first before that happens, all your dead, various systems start giving out
Right?
They have to cut your feet off
Here's our poll question today, which fits right in, who would be the happiest of Neil Croaked?
Here are your choices, we've got six, I think pretty good choices, didn't put Carlos on there because I can't think of a reason
Yet
George, here's the choices, George thinks he'd get the show
Eric, no more long polls
Greg Reed, a real evil doer
Oh, he is really
In fact, I definitely give him part of the credit for my stroke, and I take most of the blame myself, being fat out of shapes
Sit on my ass down there, being there for seven weeks, which I should know better
Moe Howard David would dance on Neil's grave, Dennis the chronic professional Catholic homophob, or Geldie just out of spite
Those things are pretty good list, it's an excellent list, but I think Moe would probably do more than just dance on your grave
Yeah, what we do, like pee on it, and then we drop a lot
Can't be drop a steamy log on it
Here you go, Ginger
Rogers, almond brittle, I'm going to tell you before you die, now you know a peanut brittle is obviously
Oh, yeah, now this is very similar, but it's almond brittle as opposed to peanut brittle, and it's surrounded by thick chocolate
Oh, good God, you have never lived until you
Now see here I am on a one breath, I'm talking about on a verge of death, but on the other hand I'm also turning people onto something really good
Which they're not going to be able to find, because I'm sure the Rogers candies are not sold in the US of A
Maybe Nestle's turtleneck, maybe that woman will call him again the one that I bitched out, but I doubt it, because she and her son are very pissed off with me
They hit me like poison, too bad, too bad
In fact, wasn't that a day I was talking about being tired of all these people like that bitch they used to bring into smarties
At the hockey games all the time, at League of Toronto, I hope I run into her out on the street, although I wouldn't recognize her
Maybe she'll recognize me, oh Neal, I'm the one who used to bring into smarties at the game, I'll kick her ass right on the goddamn ground
Right on the goddamn snowbank, you heard her run into her with your car?
I don't have a car
They don't blame me, don't blame me for subsidizing terrorism, I'm not driving SUV like George and some other people
I'm not driving anything except my feet
Since I have no vehicle here, I don't need one, I don't want one, I don't want to drive
It's one another thing I don't miss, is driving, obviously after the experience I'm always done there driving with
But a little crazy people, I'm telling you man most of you people on the roads were listening to me right now
Please do everybody else and yourself a big favor, pull over to the side of the road
Okay, just take the keys and drop them in a storm sewer or something
Put them in a dumpster and walk home or take a cab or do something, get off the freaking road, got all mighty
What passes in the name and I don't care what anybody says
Yeah, there are people that go way too fast and some of the punks they want to go like 90 and a 60 or whatever
But the fact of the matter is the slow drivers are the ones who wind up killing all of us sooner or later
The slow, I told you about that little mini caravan of about a half a dozen cars who are following each other
Oldie enters in the pomp and a part of that one, I thought I was going to have apoplex you run in the street
In fact, maybe they caused my stroke
You bastards caused my stroke, you assholes, you old farts
Oi, man
I thought I looked at the cars they're just like all lost and they're like looking at each other out the window
I thought this is the ultimate jujamm right here
What the hell was that all about?
Here is our poll from yesterday
What was the most erotic movie not x-rated that you've ever seen?
Two horse race strictly, body heat, 135
Would you agree with that?
With body heat, yeah
Well, see I haven't got to the other one yet, why do you want to be such a prick?
You know, why do you want to be so argumentative?
I can't wait to be a prick
Nine and a half weeks, 126, that's the one you're not buying
And it's interesting because when I mentioned you that they be four on Monday that I was thinking about doing this follow-up movie poll yesterday
You said nine and a half weeks ago that's how to vote
And so it gets a ton of votes and then you turn around and say, well that's only because they want to be contrary
No, nothing because they want to be contrary
They're just not as repulsed by Mickey Rorck as the rest of humanity
Well, he's nauseating but again they don't care about who the guy is in the movie
I tried to explain that to you
We have this large-hunching, her male heterosexual audience
And they don't care whether it's Ron Jeremy, Mickey Rorck, Mickey Rooney or Mickey Mouse
I'm just telling you the way it is
In fact it probably could be Mickey Mouse
Oh, I sure
And they wouldn't give a crap
Anyway, so nine and a half weeks had 126
And that was it because from there it's way down to wild things with 50
And we've all seen a few wild things in our time I would hope
Basic instincts 49, blue lagoon 46
I'm not going to read all of these, there were a thousand votes and so many in single digits
Wild-worked 36, Monsters, Balls 35
Fatal attraction 34, see there's another example
They didn't care that Michael Douglas was the guy in there
Who's about a 60s of food fly but fancies himself a real sex spot
You know, those are the guys that really get me
Like Ron Jeremy and Randy West, there are two more
Maybe Randy West a hundred years ago in another lifetime on another planet
By the way, good small girl last night
Good to see that mama Kent and Clark are okay, mama Kent
Boogie notes had 28 speaking of that
I guess it must have been the package that sealed the deal
On Faithful 27 the postman always rings twice 24
Mahal Holland Drive 24 which we're still trying to figure that out
Very spooky
Cruel intentions 21, two moon jussian 20 Lolita head 20, bound 20
Which I guess Muffo is there and you were talking about bound
Do you say something about how he likes being gagged and bound?
Summer of 42 18
In fact, he'd look Muffo would look at the red rubber ball
Like the Hannibal Lecter, Mask on with the red rubber ball
Summer of 42 18, Body Double 17, Showgirl 16, Angel Heart 14
1 million years BC 13, Sirens, Chocolate, Sex Lives Video Tape
Summer lovers each had 12 and 10
The other ones in double digits, Sailor who fell from grace with a sea and color of night
That's it, the other one single digits small potatoes
Like George
That's the end of our movie stuff for the time being okay
I'm sure other people will call in and try to vuggus with stuff
And you know what we didn't care
Because obviously what QM is degenerated into as far as the colors are concerned is
Lists, did I mention this several weeks ago?
Yep, that's what they want to talk about
Lists, lists of stuff
Oh yeah, well how about, how about yesterday they were still to the pool from my Monday
Well how about most bizarre?
Let me just ask you one thing

9.19 at 5.60 WDQM, I love that
14 quick votes, the poll is up there now
Now, let me just say this before we start, I left two out
Oh no!
Oh, we'll have to add these on, Eric
Fox News Heather
And John Gibson of Fox News
Don't you think those two are appropriate?
Sure, I think they get a vote or two or three
Pictures death link to a fedron at M. We tell the audience yesterday and we did not
I chanced high as the mole-meister for jumping the gun and I still say the same thing
Until after the autopsy, what's the big rush to judge me?
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah
Mr. Noncommittal?
Well, what do you know about it?
You know anything about sports?
Any of Baltimore Orioles, Pictures, Steve Beckler's death is to at least
partly to the dietary supplement of Fedra.
He was taken three, was popping three of them a day
And even it was only anyone degrees here, it was on an empty stomach
You had the heat stroke, as Oregon started falling apart one by one
It couldn't save them 23 years old, he's dead
Second baseball player to die suddenly in the past year, last season Cardinals
pitcher Daryl Kyle 33, died in his sleep, while in Chicago for a game against
The Cubs and autopsy revealed he had severe arterial blockage
You know what you get, I mean not necessarily, sometimes it can be genetic
But you know generally what you get severe arterial blockage from?
Fat, eat food, eat in crap
Eating crap, now let's talk about candy
Man, you're a bastard, Neil, yes I am, I want to live up to my building
I don't want to let anybody down
How's that cold coming so far, by the way boy?
Now what I was going to say is I thought, now especially since we got Ding Dong
Schooler in the morning, we got Duffinc clearance holding the morning guy's hand every morning
And you don't listen but I will say this, I think that shows Darnes sound a little bit better lately
They've actually got something going on, they've got something to say
And of course again it's a list and they get a lot of calls that way just like we did with the movies
But that's okay
And it's starting to sound like almost a real radio show I would say
Now maybe I'm wrong and maybe the audience obviously doesn't agree because the hot, not that it changes anything on a personal level
Because that's never going to change
And we were still dealing with a devious, hostile, nasty, miserable old coot
But the fact of the matter is as far as the show sounds
You see what I'm saying? Well, I'll take your word for it
No, no, no, no, no, no, the Scarlo's think
Yeah, he listens every morning
He later said they started doing the lists and now that's the way that kind of question it's gotten better
Did you say great?
No, I didn't say great
Take off those checkered pants
Yeah, cut it out, wait a second
So it is sounding better, no, it's not my imagination
There's actually like a little float of it now that they got somebody in there to hold their hand and give them some direction
I'd like to give them a direction like right out the door
But anyway, 27 votes on a poll
Who'd be the happiest if Neil croaked?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Moe Howard David had with Danza and Neil's grave 18 out of 27
That's not nice, I got 22 in line
Oh, your vera has changed
Yeah, how come you're getting the faster number?
It also means it's minus supposed to be the faster pewter, okay, mister?
So I just refreshed mine just to make damn sure I'm not
And now it's just sitting there
I got 26 on mine now
Out of 42, Moe Howard David had 26, 61.9 percent
Then it's the chronic professional Catholic homophobes 6
George thinks he'd get the show of 5
Greg Reed, a real evil doer and that's correct 3
Eric no more long polls 1 and Gildi just had a spite only 1
Don't sell Gildi short, okay?
He's devious and dangerous
Devious, dangerous and squeaky
So somebody faxes us speaking of
Because I know that this audience of all the things in the world that besides hockey
The only other thing that they don't want to hear about especially is dieting and losing weight right
But this crowd don't want to hear that
Don't paint to me
Right, that's right
Who the hell are you to be talking about being fat?
You cow, you just had another stroke, you're a fat slide, you're talking about
Food all the time?
Well the audience likes hearing about food, they love that
You wait and see today, I'll, you mark my words, okay? Mark my turd, you're a seed
Before I do the thing about Rogers truck that's its Canadian A
So that's a good news, I'm not going to start any epidemic, nobody can blame me
Unless we have some people listening on the internet up here in the Canada somewhere
Or we have the Canadians in town right now you know
Yeah, so they're not going to be able to get it there
No, but when they get home
Although they do sell smarties in South Florida
So I don't know maybe Rogers truck that's are available
I still say now it's not a poor question, but I'm just curious what people think
For example, I was thinking yesterday if you were stranded on a desert island
And you had only one food that you had an unlimited supply of, you see what I'm saying?
Right, what would you want it to be?
Some people would say like crispy cream dinner
And nobody's going to say like sirloin steak
And you know that's, and when I'm talking about body parts
You know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about
But that's not the point, this is just for fun
Okay, that's for fun talk about me
You're talking about me preaching to people, this is just for fun
Are you going to be stranded on a desert island anytime soon?
Maybe
Oh, that's right, I forgot where you guys are, I forgot
Once that state falls off from a George Wright
And like kind of floats out there in the middle of Atlantic
In fact, maybe you can have a Florida and Cuba reunion
Kind of like the Moan the Ginger reunion
Since 1885, people from all corners of the world have found their way to Rogers chocolates of Victoria
Victoria BCA
Each has discovered their own reasons, their own private excuses to bring Rogers chocolates home with them
We invite you to use our online catalog
Oh, no!
Oh, no, www.r RogersTrocklets.com, pretty simple and basic, RogersTrocklets.com
During the break, I'm going to go on that thing and see if that almond brittle is on there
I'm serious, you know me with the food
When I tell you something like the Nestleys Turtle, I wasn't joking about that, that was serious business
And these almond brittle, I can't even describe how good they are
Addictive is an understatement
So go on to RogersTrocklets.com and check out their website
Maybe order you a few cases and we'll come to your funeral, we'll send you flowers
Here's Big Arnie, Big is writes me a facts on the subject of fat
How do you like that?
And let me say it again, I'm very concerned about the Humper, I'm not trying to pick on them like some of the callers are
But it's serious business now, it's reached the point of no return I think
You follow what I'm saying?
I know, but in other words, this is the moment of truth
And we're all of us fat people, I'm not pointing the finger, we're all the same
Oh, I lost a couple ounces of fat rich same thing, you know
Always talking about how much we lost, but in the meantime, a couple of weeks later you look at us and looks like somebody stuck a bicycle pump up our ass
Like a big balloon in our puppet, you know?
Exactly what I'm talking about
Wayne Arnold up and down all the time
Wayne Arnold, the human accordion
Great guy, I mean just because your fat does mean you're a nice person, in fact most of the fat people are
I know are very nice people
That's what I'm saying, I don't understand is how can you lose all the weight and then just go ahead and put it back right back up
Because it's an illness, it's like saying how can you like stop drinking booze for a week and then all of a sudden when somebody sticks it in front of you
You're drinking it again, it's an illness
And if only this goddamn world would look upon it that way instead of pointing fingers at all your fat slob
Well, got a problem, man, we got a food problem, we have a goddamn fat problem, don't you understand it?
Let's make it illegal to be fat
Right?
And have round up all the fatis
I see people for example in a convenience stores here buying cigarettes
Yeah
Do you know how much it costs for a pack of cigarettes here?
I have no idea
With all the fat here in the EST?
Right
Close to ten bucks
Now don't you think that's a great idea to help discourage people from smoking faggots?
Carlos, I have to quit today
Yeah, there you go, you can buy half a pack, you can buy one a cigarette, ten bucks a pack
Because they're asking for these fancy, they have more brands of cigarettes here than I've ever seen in my life
And candy, that's the two, well the one thing candy you go
Hockey and candy, that's candy
We got candy up the ass
927 and 560, WQAM
Hey guys, speaking of that size, does matter

Hope no one blows up my brand new Dodge Travis
I've been a Rex's big gave us the news
Popping value with a big glass of booze
I keep a gas mask in my glove compartment
I call 3 Max for a bombproof apartment
Reinforce my front door with center blocks
Wonder if that will keep up the small pots
Checking my mail for that deadly white powder
Stocking my covers with Campbell's clam chowder
Living on orange alert, sure ain't no fun
I think the terrorists already won
I can't take it, I won't make it if it goes to red
I'll pull my covers up over my head and just stay in bed
Oh, he's dead
I'm 31 at 5.60 WQ AM
I made a bad mistake during the break
Oh no, I did what I said I was gonna do
Well, if this man I'm gonna buy any
If I want to buy it, I sure don't have to go online to buy it
I can go right out to any store and convenience store
Even the shoe stores here sell candy
Everybody in their brother sells candy
That's hand-witted, the hot dog stand got candy behind them there
Anyway, so I'm on a Roger's talk and do you look at it?
No, no, no, I don't need it
And the first thing that I Roger's classics
And let me caution you by saying this
Because I don't want people to waste their money and say
Oh, that was really crap
I've tasted some of the other stuff they make too
And it's really very pedestrian and pretty crappy, okay?
And you know that's true in a lot of places
Like if you go to a restaurant, sometimes there's a restaurant where they got one or two things that are great
And the rest of what's on the menu blows
You know what I'm talking about? I do
Well here for example, they got Victoria Creams and this one
But at the bottom of this list, six down it says
Two pound chocolate almond brittle
Oh my god, 24 pieces
Two pounds
Two pounds
And I guarantee you that I could easily eat two pounds right here during the show
While you weren't, while you didn't even always eating it, you're...
Huh? I'd race you
You never even had it yet
No, but I love chocolate
I've come up with all the time I'm gonna bring a few of these things, I will
At least I'll pull
Maybe there'll be just some empty wrappers in my bag
But at least I'll have the intention of bringing them home
You bring the chocolate, I'll bring the stretcher

Absolutely correct sir
Eric no more long pulls one, Geldie just out of spite one
And Fox News had the one, what happened to Fox News, John Gibson? Huh?
Who wrote that whole piece of it that big song advanced about, I'm this and I'm that, blah blah blah
All this other crap, what about him?
I don't know, what about...
Speaking of people that keep bouncing from one another and that work to another one
John Gibson what a kiss O.J. on the ass by the way
That he's out of his little local reporters job on a West Coast
So here's the facts from Big Arnie who says you're inspiring me not to be Big Arnie anymore
You're right, it's too dangerous
I have no health problems right now but need to drop weight before I do my wife has lost 43% of her body weight
While I've dropped maybe 10% a year and a half, I've used the excuse of eating because of stress
I guess it's more stressful than I from the fat, good point Arnie
I'm gonna lose the weight so I won't be Big Arnie anymore
This is for you, you don't even have to read this over here if you don't want to but I did
I did it just to try to inspire you Arnie so you live up to the, we don't put a lot of pressure on you
But you better do it or else
Okay, has he got it? No
I love this story about the woman chased by the fake aliens who on the TVB show
Look at that, we better take a couple of calls here because they're gonna get really upset and then they'll run away
What the hell was that in the beginning there where we hit a whole bunch of calls all lined up Carlos and then they all ran away
Probably people, probably people want to take shots at Hank
Oh, this here's a lot of, here's Fort Lauderdale, hello
Hey, Mia, love your show, man
How about the White Lauderdale for your poll and Corn Dogs on the island
White Lauderdale would like me to croak?
I don't know
Corn Dogs? Yeah, for your, for if you're on an island, Corn Dogs
Yeah, why you like Corn Dogs?
I love Corn Dogs
You love Corn Dogs? They're the best
Okay, well listen, watch out for the old Corn Hole
Here's a guy who loves Corn Dogs, they're nasty
Like you said, pedestrian, sure
They're like a ca ca ca on a stick or something like that
Ooh, man, I could understand if he would've just said like plain weeners, you know, something I can relate to
But Corn Dogs?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line the best
See, I've got an I wrote down candy or something but just best food
Like junk food that you want to have if you only had one unlimited supply of one kind of food
On a desert island somewhere and we're not talking about human body parts
Speaking of Dwight, Laura Deaccombe
I'm not talking about that Dwight, okay?
Look at this poll, Mohawar David had would dance on my grandfielder on the pressure already
112 votes and he's got 70 of would dance on my grave if I croak
I wonder what his reaction was when he heard that I had this stroke
Probably the same as everybody else in town, I know
Did you see anything in the newspaper about it?
No!
You see Tom Jicker writing about that? No, he's busy writing about network TV shows again
Tom, you're an idiot, okay?
At least you're consistent, you haven't written about anything local in about 400 years now
Anything about, forget about just me, anything about anybody
On the local scene but I'm supposed to be out of touch
Mohawar David at 70, Dennis the chronic 16, George thinks he'd get the show 14
Maybe you and Moe could do it like a tap dance together
On my grave, that would be cute
Greg Reed, a real evil doer, eight Fox News Heather two, Eric one and Guilty one
We still don't see John Gibson on there
Well maybe Eric doesn't want to put John Gibson on there for whatever reason
Maybe Eric likes John Gibson
Here's Miami, hello
Neil, yes sir
Yes, you forgot Reverend Jones
No, but Reverend Jones is the show, Reverend Jones is just trying to go on
You can, you can me, Reverend Jones would be in the evening morning for months, what the hell would he do?
He would never really call him
Yeah, but this is not him, yeah
No, it's not
It is not your gay
That's not him, it's not even close to being him
George, what are you, what are you on?
What kind of drugs are you doing?
It's not me and I was just going to give George a couple until
This guy sounds, this guy sounds about as much like Reverend Jones's
I sound like guilty, everybody else is talking about
Says his name except for him
It's not him, go ahead
Not him, it's not me, but your gay, no I'm just kidding
All right Neil, love the show
Thanks, goodbye
That was not him, him or one of his stuages
No, I'm going to jump out the window, I really am, and I'm way up high in the sky
I don't know what you're talking about, he doesn't have any stuages
Why are you, what are you talking about?
He's talking about voices, nobody else mentions his name except him
That is not true
Okay
Absolutely, when we took the poll on the chronic callers, Reverend Jones had a lot of votes
You know, Reverend Jones, right?
That was not him, it was Carlos, was that him?
Sounded like him to me after you played the your gay thing, but I'm not sure
I don't know his voice good enough, well he's not a gay
I will bet both of your lives on it that it was not him, okay?
That's how confident I am
Okay
That it was not him
What is, man?
This George, talk about an uptack, no one of they hate you, man
Just loosen up a little bit, look at what happened to me, lighten up a little bit
I'm light, I watch, yeah, we know that
I watched Smallville last night, I go to bed about 10 after 10, I'm lying here
I'm on a virgin fall, I'm asleep the phone rings, I go running to the room, I don't have a phone in my bedroom
I go running to the other room, grab the phone and there's the depressing Norma Kent
Norm, don't call me anymore unless you got something meaningful to tell me, okay?
If you can't get your money from Greg yet, it's par for the course, I don't really, you know, what can I do for you?
And he's a big shot, he's a Panthers an Oonisper center one and the Merleins are going to do that
And Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh Buh!
Ten minutes, I'm sitting here on a phone, not saying a word, you know?
Mm-hmm
He starts out, oh, what's this about, you had a stroke as if you're very concerned
You know what I'm saying? I'm not saying he's not concerned but he should be concerned enough to let me go to sleep
I get up at six o'clock at a goddamn morning Norm, let me sleep all right
Don't be called people at ten o'clock at night unless it's an emergency
Like maybe exciting news like Greg actually paid you what he owes you
And by the way, Greg, you're still a liar.
Oh, yeah, they have the lawyer call them up and say,
oh, don't sue us for the money.
Isn't this something that you have to keep suing these people
to get money that they owe you that they admit?
It's not like the money is in dispute.
In other words, they admit they owe you the money.
And then they end up,
we're going to have, you'll have the check on Monday for sure.
That's meaning this past Monday.
Did he have the check?
No.
No, he didn't have the check.
But what am I going to do about that?
So do I need that stress?
Do I need the stress?
No.
It would be like, you calling me at one in the morning and saying,
by the way, you're still suffering from the effects of the stroke.
And by the way, my wife just threw me out of the street.
You know, as if that would be a big surprise.
What am I going to do about it?
Nothing.
No, not a goddamn thing.
I wouldn't blame her for throwing your ass out on the street.
In the first place.
Especially with your attitude today that you're so hostile toward these people, man.
Not hostile.
Hostile.
No wonder I have to beg for calls.
You chase them all away.
It was him.
By the way, speaking about hostile McGill's not him.
And say it said that.
Wait a minute.
Who called?
McGill.
Yeah.
McGill called and said that.
Yes, it was him.
So it was not him.
He sounded about as much like Reverend Jones's McGill does.
And tell him the girl to butt out, okay?
When we start talking about Castro again, then McGill can call in, okay?
Professional spick.
Professional grease ball.
We're not interested in your opinion, okay?
McGill butt out.
Silly goose.
Fony baloney.
Oh, yeah, I love the bedtime stories.
Yeah, right.
You're such an ass sucker.
Well, I'm going to next time I come back, I'm going to stick Doreen on him.
We're going to time McGill up, stick him in a corner there and let Doreen have her way with
him.
Think that'll straighten his ass out.
Yeah, we're going to toss him on his new bed from Dalmatians on big new macros.
We're just going to lock him down in the middle of it and let her surround him with her outpouring
of love.
20 till 10 at 5.60 WQN.

Right in local, we are supporting O560CUAM.
This is Ward.
Not as pedophile.
There's a little woman.
All right guys, knock it off.
Hey!
Hey!
Are you being fat fruit cake?
Guys, that's not nice at all.
Now, I'm going to cry.
I'm going to call your parents is what I'm going to do.
Let's face it, being a house husband is hard enough without having to worry about the
laundry.
And thanks to new simply clean with bleach, I don't have to worry.
Simply clean gets out all the tough stains like grass stains, coffee, picks, the f*** this
charge, dried on f*** like on this t-shirt.
So when my wife gets home, my laundry will score an A-plus.
I need a home.
Well there he is now.
New simply clean with bleach.
Get's up the f*** dirt.
I'm 45 at 560 W-CUAM.
151 votes on a pool who'd be the happiest of Neil Croak.
Moe Howard David would dance on Neil's grave, 88.
Dennis the chronic professional Catholic in homophobes, 22.
Not even a contest, is it?
Yeah.
No.
George thinks he'd get the show 21.
That's where the battle is between you and your friend Dennis.
My buddy.
Greg Reed, a real evil duet, 12 Fox News Heather, 5.
Geltie just out of spite, 2 Eric no more long, pulls one.
And John Gibson, a Fox News, it probably should sound her, but I don't mind get picky because
the Eric will get more votes.
John Gibson, none.
Now here's an excellent thing.
Did you read this whole thing?
They used to send me this, yeah.
Facts from West Palm.
Mm-hmm.
Outstanding.
I mean it's a little sick.
Yeah.
And that's the way we like it on the show.
In regard to today's pool, I'd hate to think anyone would be glad to see you keel over.
Here's my alternative to the pool.
What do you think?
I think it's a great thing.
Which W-CUAM personality will be the first to croak?
Neil, Hank, Moe, Geltie, Mad Dog, Josie, the beast.
Anyk, Mark, Joe, the big-
Oh!
Joe Rose, George, etc.
I think he's covered him all, hasn't he?
Pretty thorough when he left off with Kimba Bo camper.
It's a list of them all.
That way you're showing no favoritism or bias.
Then he goes on to say unfortunately my vote would be for the hammer, although he'd only be even money in Vegas.
I've yet to see Moe, but he sounds like an old cocker who may give Hank a run for his money.
Don't get me wrong, I don't want to see anyone go, but this would be an interesting pool.
I think he's got a point, don't you?
I think it's an idea.
Well, you want to eliminate today's pool and put this on there instead?
No, we can save this for tomorrow or something.
What's the right...
It's the QAM death pool week is what it is.
That's bad.
I think it's death.
What else are you going to do about it?
Not too much, I guess.
Here's a call from Jupiter, hello.
Hey, Neil, it's a rough...
How are you, sir?
How are you?
About Hank, you know, you hit it right in the head just passing his schmoosing.
You got to have a balance and he's out there and it's like I hate to say it, but so far gone.
You know?
I mean, you can't...
His whole thing is eating and party, meeting people, but without that balance in your description,
maybe think of money placed on Waparthin men.
Remember that part?
That's a prehistoric story.
Yeah, Mr. Kislo.
It's sad because I like the hammer.
We all do.
I mean, most of us do.
There's some people hate him, but there are a lot of people hate me too.
But the point is, it's just a tragic.
You see it happening and there's nothing you can say or do.
I mean, I keep trying to take these shots on you or hoping, because I know we listen to hoping that I can convince him,
just to put whatever he's eaten down.
But you don't know like an alcoholic, and it's bargone as he is, and I hate to say it.
I mean, what's he going to do?
Get a stomach staple or something?
I mean, really, it's draft and measures.
At this point for the guy, you know?
We're in the wisdom lock, and no more wapathin men.
No more crap.
Okay, thanks.
See, there's a guy who at least wishes everybody well.
Right?
He's not sitting out there rubbing his hands and glee, hoping one of us is going to croak, because we're obsessed with fat.
But it is true.
I think if Hank would like, change the balance, like a few more strip clubs and strippers,
and a few less dinners at all these restaurants, see what I'm saying?
More keto strips, less strippers.
Right.
Exactly.
Isn't he diabetic?
Yeah.
Okay.
Fat rich.
Is he diabetic?
Is he?
Yes, I say.
Am I diabetic?
Yeah.
I've lunch here by the way this morning was 101.
That's good.
Well, it's good only because I'm damn sure I'm making it good.
I mean, if it wasn't good this week after having that stroke a week ago Sunday,
if it wasn't good now, I might as well just jump out the window.
See what I'm saying?
Yeah.
What would be the point?
Although there are other people, and you see they get the messages,
and they have all their different, they're taken out their organs one at a time.
It's like the smokers.
You, you heard about the smokers.
They put them in a hospital, they make them put a tube in their lungs so they can smoke through the two.
They smoke through the neck.
So they're into the nicotine.
A hole in their neck they're smoking through.
That's what I'm saying.
They're smoking through a frickin hole in their neck.
Jesus.
Freckin.
No in their neck.
Yeah.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on it.
So we got corn dogs so far in the other little, huh?
When you think the audience come up with something a little bit more tempting than corn dogs?
Those corn dogs sure are special.
Go man, go corn doggy go.
Here's Pompano, hello.
That corn dog is nasty.
What is he had a lack of corn dog?
He must spend too much time at the county fair or something.
If you're going to be at the county fair, at least get the cotton candy.
Cotton candy.
How about some form of candy, anything other than a corn dog?
Nobody's going to give me something specific.
I thought he was going to say a Schmidt-Kead bar.
Even that'll work.
But you know, it's funny you mentioned Norm Penn, I co-produced this show.
You co-produced this show?
Yeah, I feel in, actually this week I'm filling in for somebody who's taken a day off, a week off, actually.
Who's, name I won't mention.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But, uh, this is funny you mentioned that, I'm out of Norm.
Because, uh, any, any who, uh, corn dog, that's the worst.
Okay.
Oh.
And what time can I read that?
If you co-produced this show, pass the message.
Don't call me anymore late at night, okay?
I just got you having a stroke.
I'm trying to get some rest.
People are cooperating.
Muff got the message.
He sent me a little thing on the internet.
I went on my, uh, on my email.
I took a look at it.
It was great.
And that's it.
He didn't bother calling me again yesterday.
And don't do it anymore, Muff.
Till I let you know.
Don't give me the high sign.
God.
You're like, somebody calling you three in the morning.
When you remember those puking, horrible, sick, flu episodes, you've had, right?
Coming in and going home with that, and somebody calling you three in the morning saying,
or are you sick?
Right?
You know what I'm talking about?
You get what I do, of course.
Leave people alone when people are not feeling their best.
Leave them alone.
Let their body have a chance to heal up.
What is this called?
See how you were doing.
Christ.
What?
Wanted to call and see how you were doing.
I don't want them to know how I'm doing.
They'll, they can listen to the show and hear I'm doing just fine.
It's going to be sunny and 38 today, 36, whatever.
Uh, this, what a little snowy God is going to be melting.
Everything here is wonderful.
Leafs, one last night came from behind.
Four, three over Caroline, over the Hercun's.
What more could you want?
Even a Panthers one last night.
Oh!
What the hell more could life be, okay?
Then maybe some Roger's almond brew.
That is dangerous.
Sometimes if I, and I probably shouldn't talk about it because someday,
somebody's going to point the finger at me and say,
first it was the goddamn fish food.
Right.
Then it was the bagel bites from whoever the hell makes that.
And then that wasn't bad enough.
Although the bokeh burgers, at least nobody's going to get fat from those.
Are they still around?
Oh yeah, they're in the supermarkets here.
You bet.
And they're good if you like.
I'll tell you one thing.
If you like burger king, you like the bokeh burgers because they taste like rubber.
Rubber on the out.
Huh?
No, they're okay.
The bokeh burger really feels like they've got them up a little bit with a slice of tomato
and onion and put little spices on them.
They're not bad.
I want some cow.
You want some real meat.
Yeah, that's what I'm feeling, too.
I like some real meat, myself.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
And I do want to say this.
As much as I'm getting really sick of that business between Chloe and Lana on the small
bill, they had her dolled up last night with the first night to hold it since the show has been
on it.
She actually was prettier than Clark.
No, seriously, she looked really good last night Lana.
You know what I'm saying?
She looked great.
She always.
No, I'm serious.
She really looked stunning last night.
Either was the makeup or something.
She got lucky or I don't know what it was.
Maybe you can get lucky with him though.
No.
And that part of the story that's a one, one complaint about small bill.
The stories are very compelling and very exciting and very action packed and yaddy yaddy yaddy.
But I'm getting really burnt out and that whole story line thing with Lana and Chloe and
they're like both got the hots for Clark.
Why don't they understand?
Maybe he's not interested in them.
He floated.
Right.
Maybe he's more interested in like he's maybe gay.
That could be it.
Maybe he wants to rub oil on Lex's head.
Maybe he'd like to, maybe he'd like to turn him into the oily bird or something.
I don't know.
Flex Luther.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Sadly you have become a shadow of your former self.
Really?
I mean your show is devolved into the Neil and Psycho-Fantic George show.
Yeah.
And so why are you listening?
I tune out often.
Well then my suggestion is do it right now before your brain gets any more polluted.
That's another one of those chronic regulars.
Right.
My show is degenerated to the Neil and Psycho.
I like the show.
I'm more having a good time.
See that's what he doesn't like.
We're having a really new back up there and you're in a good mood and you're not dying.
Yeah and that's right.
We're very satisfied.
I'm very pleased with the way I sound now after having a stroke.
Everything is going great.
But there again is another nice stuff from South Florida.
Not hey how you doing you feeling okay.
Your show is degenerated.
But this guy's listening every minute of every day.
He's a chronic.
I mean it's one voice.
I mean you thought that the other guy was Mr. Reverend Joan.
This guy is as chronic as the day is long.
Yep.
But he's got a sick offentic.
I don't want to go with it.
Psychrophantic George.
Yeah.
I thought George is being rather sick myself today.
Like you know, a hundred and a half old.
So this is one of his lackeys.
Oh brother.
How about Jim lackey, the harness driver?
It was him.
It was not him.
Just kidding.
Are you trying to give me another stroke?
I know.
Oh please God don't.
In spite of what the poll says.
Who'd be the happiest of Neil croaked?
Moe Howard David would dance on Neil's grave 111.
Then is the chronic professional Catholic homophob 28.
George thinks he'd get the show 25.
He sure working on it now.
He's pushing it.
Greg Reed.
A real evil.
A real evil.
There were 13 Fox News.
Heather's got six.
Gildi just out of spite for you.
Watch out for him.
He's the he's the chigger in a wood pile.
A Gildi.
He's dangerous.
Eric no more long polls one.
And John Gibson.
A Fox News has one.
Sarah we pushing Eric a little bit too much.

Yoldi six Eric one and John Gibson to Fox News. He's got a small one in fact the fact says
I'm as used to refer to John Gibson as the ghoul because of his facial scars
What a concept that quips calling someone a ghoul it says he also described Gibson as one of the dumbest factors on TV
Which was more to the point Gibson rose to fame because of OJ like many OJ trial benefactors has no real news credentials
And you are absolutely correct
He was a flunky reporter at LA when a whole OJ thing started

Little blood tacos your lungs cuts off your circulation your brain and like that
little stroke
Took me only a 10 hours in a hospital convinced him that I had a stroke and it took my friend doctor
Hampton tell me that I was right and it's played in the exactly what happened. Well, what do you know?

I know you had one a few years back and this man you've got to stop
Living the 7th area lifestyle you know how to control the stroke from happening again. I don't know why why you don't do it
Yeah, really
If you know what you can do to avoid a helicopter excuse me, that's okay
If you know you can
Avoid it. I don't understand why you don't do it
What does that mean if you can avoid a stroke if you know what the reasons why you know what I'm doing
I've lost eight pounds in a week. I'm out walking every day as much as I can in the abroid or weather
But it's not that bad anymore. I'm doing a lot better now than I was there
So you've tried to explain you when I'm there. It's a death wish
It's Florida. That's well
It's it's it's out floater. There's nowhere to walk. There's no real exercise
I said on my ass in fact some of my days were comprised of sitting on my S four hours at work
Then going home and sitting my ass watching TV and then going to the track and feeding my face and sitting my ass for another five or six hours
But you're absolutely right is it this lifestyle down here is from your car to the mole from the mole to the car
That's hard to the food to the restaurant. See here. I don't have a car
It's true. I don't have a car. I walk more here already in Islam

I walk in the morning to reduce those triglycerides are reduced my triglycerides are 78
That's fantastic. Yeah, it is that's that's supposed to show you just because my cholesterol wasn't too bad my
Their triglycerides are great that alone doesn't get the job done because when you're sedentary
Just like when they tell you when you travel a long flight on a plane
If you don't get up and walk around you can have those deep veins from both season get the blood clot

Carole blank thought she was being chased by a space alien in Los Angeles on a way to where posh Hollywood to home all in the end of this to chopped off
What a shame remember I said it was gonna be copied this because it would be better right but the end of it is all chopped off
That's because probably because it's from what's his name the grudge report
You want me to re-tax you the other one?
No, but the alien turned out to be an actor in a monster suit and the party was phony as well
So now the Los Angeles grade school teacher and aspiring actress is fighting back
suing the new TV reality series tactics
What is it something tactic? Care tactics. Care tactics. See that's such a chop off claiming she suffered severe emotional damage court papers
It is today stupid bitch now what that'd be a good poll question would you rather be more scared being followed by a space alien or any legal alien
Well, what country blank suit the sci-fi channel the producers the scare tactics into actors for
Scaring or so badly that she had to be hospitalized several times for physical injuries and severe emotional distress her lawyer said

So yeah, one way it's morbid. It's just being honest. That's all the honest show
We just know that if I quote there'd be certain people who would be very happy about it
But then they'd have nobody to hate they'd have a fun for you
Oh, they did find somebody that the hateful people always find somebody to hate. Don't you remember that song by Jefferson airplane somebody to hate?
I you know I crawled I was um so I don't employ for a while
I've been like searching the web I looked on Bermuda.com because I live in there a while and there's a link to your website there

Well, you're pretty exciting place. Oh man. It's chronic. Is this chronic is this place? Mm-hmm
Yeah, I believe it's more about the guy that wanted me to spend my afternoon looking at Godfather pictures on the internet
I mean it I almost forgot what he's called's were coming from so I probably took it with a little too hard on him
So I figure I figure that since we have nobody to blame for his blizzard I figured it was a

Survey backs US radio consolidation
This is one of the most ridiculous stories I've ever ridden my life and they're doing it because all their big clients like
Teapchannel that's what they wanted them to say and it also says that in the historic we'll get to that maybe oh the state of oral sex
Don't let me forget about that
What state is that in mr. Cippy?
I think that's why Rick we've removed there just before he passed on to the great football booth in the sky
How safe is oral sex that question's been on the tip of many tongues ever since AIDS raised its deadly head now
What this is from the village voice by the way now?
On experts said that philatio may not be rescued all at least what it comes to spreading HIV
Dr. Jeffrey Klausner who heads the sexually transmitted disease prevention effort at San Francisco Department of Public Health
Based his conclusion on a new study of 239 gay or bisexual men who reported no anal or vaginal sex and no injection drug use in the prior six months
98% said they'd given head without condoms
28% said they knew their partner was HIV positive and although a 39% said they had swallowed semen
None of the men became infected
The risk of HIV transmission via oral sex
Cousner maintains is and I'm going to read this exactly the way it's printed
You'll see it on our website. This is on the state of oral sex. He says is very very very very very very low and maybe zero
Did you get that are you pushing that homosexual agenda again? The risk of HIV transmission via oral sex
Maintains is very very very very very very low and maybe zero
A 2002 Spanish study supports Klausner's views speak
researchers there followed 110 women and 25 men all HIV negative for 10 years each participant had an HIV positive partner
The investigators estimated that over the course of the study the couples engaged in 19,000 acts of unprotected philatio or cunnelingus
None of the negative partners converted in other words got infected
Got it got it that's good. So there you go
State of oral sex is uh, no, no, no, no, not suggest him. I'm not recommending. I'm not endorsing
I'm just reading to whatever it says and that's in the very very left wing village voice follow on the same
I get it. I mean, I don't want to be sick of antics. Oh no
Okay, Dennis. Look it upset with you again. That was Dennis
That was Dennis calling it a critique our show and it's become very ponderous
I sick of anticliddle George just because you won't suck his ass because we know exactly what he is and what he's all about

Jones jets were billion style influenced everyone from pinky tuss could narrow unhappy days to

Never want a great democratic candidate
Jeb Bush slips on Spanish history, would you just to fact me this?
Yeah
Madrid Spain the US president's brother jet bush is part criticism after mistakenly referring to Spain as a republic
In a speech to the Spanish business leaders during a trip to Madrid to discuss business opportunities
Florida governor jet bush's blunder was reminiscent of president bush's past slip ups
Which have included pronouncing Spanish premonster Jose Maria asnard's name incorrectly
Spanish historian Juan Pablo Fuzzi said the era by bush was foolish and grotesque
Fulish and grotesque
It's an offense to Spain and its democratic monarchy Fuzzi told Reuters it's further it further rituals the Bushes in general
Bush the Florida governor was in Madrid to promote the state to Spanish businesses and to meet Prime Minister asnard
Speaking in Spanish bush said I want to thank the president of the Republic of Spain for his friendship with the US
Spain is not been in republic since the late 1930s when general Francisco Franco crushed Republican troops in the Civil War
Franco's nationalist dictatorship lasted until his death in 1975 when Spain became a constitutional
King Juan Carlos one is not head of the state his older brother president bush once referred to as now as an czar
Had of his birth visit to Spain as US president 2001
President Bush accused by opponents of having a shaky grasp on geographies also famously referred to Greeks as grations
Although we do like their formula for hair loss don't we or for her a color whatever it is

American express would said there are no signs of fraudulent use yet
Will not disclose how many accounts were involved with the company joins visa master card those two said a combined 5.6 million of their account numbers
We're subject to the breach or like to all of almost 8 million
Makes it a little bit nervous. Don't if you have any credit cards. Of course in Georgia's case and it Carlos's case

The alleged victim claims he was molested by one of the men then turned to the other for help the priest then began molesting him also the suit claims
Neither Gary Poole nor Kevin Clohecy has been criminally charged also named as plaintiffs with the diocese of Jefferson City

Clohecy's brother David is national director of SNAP these survivors network of those abuse by priests
He's a strange from his brother
A woman who answered the phone at pools Jefferson City Homes the deformer priest had no comment
Clohe has you less 30 miles north of Jefferson city in Columbia couldn't be reached for a comment
His phone number is not listed and his brother don't know how to get a hold of him
So to speak
In Utah two brothers filed an 80 million dollar lawsuit yesterday claiming they were abused in the 1970s by a priest teaching at the Catholic high school in Salt Lake City
The priest is currently serving a 40-year prison term in Oklahoma for sex abuse. Oh
The Salt Lake diocese said in the stem in yesterday to learn of the alleged abuse to one victim in November
2000 and 2002 that diocese offered pastoral care and reported the allegations to state officials that said in Wisconsin yesterday
The Madison diocese announced is paid out $1.6 million to 19 victims of sex abuse in the past two decades
Vision William Bullock said that I see is new have documented abuse allegations against four of its priests
The diocese serves nearly 265,000 Catholics in 11 southwestern Wisconsin counties

It's as I was gonna watch the full football game. I forgot to watch the football game
Didn't know what happened didn't know we had a party that night nothing
After a little bit it all came back to me, but it was a strange strange kind of feeling
Mm-hmm exercise doesn't do it all the time I guess now smoking smoking is one of the worst things you can do

They made me make me look like Mickey Mouse. You know what I'm saying right? Yeah
Thank goodness they got the dog and they know the robot
They didn't have to go through the helicopter thing because I
I didn't realize that they were able to get a little boat out there
And they got the uh the

Speaking of women here's a lady in bokeh hello
Hey, hi me. How are you? Okay, I want to thank you
I'm one of the maybe few people that love the articles you pick out
In fact, I get the one that reads those okay, huh? You're the one that reads them. Yeah, they're a few of us
I don't know where you find some of them. I look at some of the headings and I put them on my
favorite style, but I see some of them from the New York Times, but some of the other places the sources are great
I'd never find them
So thank you mom's glad I'm delighted because I always wonder if anybody can bother's with them
I really do like them of course they're one splendid, but that's the slant I like that's the idea
They're enough they're enough or right wing websites out there. We've got to even an up a little bit
Got that right. Okay, thanks. Thank you and when you're not there there's nothing up there
There's a big blank space and I don't know
So I really look at them almost every day. Well, we're never gonna let coals pull that crap again
Thanks a lot have a great day. Thank you very much
See she was very nice little on the old side, but that's where it goes
I don't think anybody in it first of all young people don't read newspapers
So why should I expect them to go to our website and read the bedtime story see that that's another reason
I was reading the bedtime stories here on here
Even though it was much more productive than then fumbling through a bunch of really idiotic calls which most of them today have been
Uh, but hey, that's what the audience wants give it to a baby. That's what they want
They want a rise the old saying goes they want crap
Why don't you give me the book, but oh no, I was imitating one of our colleagues. No, I understand
But that's just that's just what they want very sad
You can't force feed the public out there. Okay, they want Drek they want kaka
That's why a third of the people watching television Monday that watch Joe millionaire
Hmm a third of the people are watching TV in this country watch and that country we're watching Joe millionaire

God was either one of them attractive. No, I mean interesting. No
No
He was like a dullard. I saw the eclipse. They showed on the news all day yesterday. He's a dullard
Not to mention the fact ugly ugly it looks like a retard looks grotesque
And she was a meast at best margin like about a two and a half on a scale of 50
But it's the hype baby sell the hype forget about the content nobody cares about the content America's not interested in that
And again, just like they said there and that's straight right yesterday
About the difference between the media approach on what's happening in the world in Europe and what what what were presented with in America
And even the difference between a Canadian approach to what the news and what's in America
Pablo
Feed the American public Pablo and puke and crap and that's what they become well conditioned to most of the newscast
Especially local newscast isn't even real news anyway
It's kaka
puffpieces
So maybe they're in Michael Jackson. That's what the American public wants all this other stuff
It's going on a good try and get me to blow the guy damn world up. Wow, but me like that

I can go back and read the bed times there is if you didn't do it like ten times the work I'm doing now
And well, why don't put about a tenth of the number what's the point? They don't want that
But like I said living and breeding people don't read newspapers and certainly aren't looking at the they're too busy on
Pornocytes to wonder on the internet. They don't have time to read the final what's going on in the world
Although like I said the one promising thing was in a big protest over the weekend with the millions of people who marched against war over the weekend
An enormous percentage of those people were like 20 something and even under 20s

PR routes to screw you George which I'm sure he says with love and kisses of course
He blurted out the effort. How come we're not getting any spire ports about what's going on with that stuff?
Huh? Good question, but that can be put in place. It's so tight lipped about what's going on there that it's supposed to be a big secret
Because they know that if I found out I'll put it out on the air yeah
Because the public deserves to know about these things aren't you on medication?
Yes, so if you blurted out the f word
Well, if you how do you like that? Huh?
5 6 7 0 5 60 we got one hour till noon. Okay, let's see if this audience can do it. What do you say? They don't have to be good
We sure like to hear first of all Carlos keeps putting all these I mean that lady was nice
Even though she was a hundred years old
She was very nice because she at least reads the bedtime stories
Which made Carlos feel it's worthwhile all the effort he has to go through to put them on there
Takes him at least about 20 minutes every day
Don't get it started
What do you mean by that? Well the procedure changed but we don't want to talk about that you just relax
We don't want to give you another stroke. I'm not getting involved in the middle of it
Exactly because we have because we have because you're in a psycho a psycho
Computer needs to say don't ever call me again Eric. I'm telling you right now be the biggest mistake you ever made in your life
Another thing he does when he calls here like when he was doing it last time. I was here
In fact, I think that's set the stage for my stroke
I pick up the phone. Hi, you know, hi like like I'm expecting to hear from him
You know what I mean?
Like I should be expecting his call. What am I going to do for him? What does he need me for?
You think that a guy who like jeopardized their entire livelihoods on his program not too many months ago
You think that he would like really be to on the line real tight
But when you're that big and fat it's hard to total line. Can you see him doing like a tight rope into circus?
Huh? Oh, I bet your Carlos would pay lots to see that it would be tight
Here's color rage hello
Yes, sir
Yeah, I'm moving on high on I just wanted to thank you for all the good times through all the bomb hits and

Of course people that you know don't know any better. Oh, this is paradise paradise. Yeah
When I left there was like 87 88 degrees every day in the early February. What the hell is that the middle of February 88 90 degrees? That's winter
Yeah
Little bit too hot and salty and too many of the allergies and the mold and the stuff like that
I would say yesterday not that anybody seems to care but yesterday I turned the corner as far as the stroke thing is concerned
I mean, it's then by next Monday. I'm predicting that'll be like back to abnormal for me. Okay good because it takes a couple of weeks
But yesterday I stopped would like the that sensation that just a little bit of it now you know the headache
A brainy like you know I'm talking. Oh, I don't know
Well, you don't want to know don't go right out. No, I don't advise you don't ever have a stroke
All right, and let me say one other thing too since I got mentioned about smoking smoking and stroking mm-hmm
Uh, those little cigarettes remember what I had those little cigars right it's still having had one but I'm saying
What did I tell you about those? What was that complaining about right that my your whole head feels like it's full of a
Smoking like you're in a fog. Hey Derek. Don't bring anymore those little cigars to the track you jackass
You mean well, but you're a killer man and the cherry flavor which makes it taste good is extra oh poisonous poison
Those things and again because they're small you chain smoke them like cigarettes right oh god
During a course of night at the track I'd sit there and smoke five or eight or ten of those goddamn thing good Lord
By the time I left there was like you know fog, you know
I had the two over to one five six or the nine over the seven I I didn't know what that was going on
I didn't know Brian Sears from Sears and Robock
But that's just the way it goes, you know no more of those damn little Stogies Derek
How many how many people do we know all of us who are trying to kill us with kindness
The food pushers mm-hmm the cigar pushers or you still smoking Stogies no no, I'm not well you are now
What do you mean by that when they give you give them to you
Doesn't matter what you say you still smoking cigars. No, well here's some anyway. No, I'm not
I see what you're saying. No, I'm not no more those did I smoke any of those in that pack? I didn't even open it
I gave you the package unopened and it's pristine form with the plastic condom still on it
Here's a call from Kendall. Hello good show guys. Yeah, that's it. That's not me. Oh, that's more on again
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 put putting these chronic son Carlos. You should be doing a little bit better by now. Okay. He's a burden
He can't help it. Oh
From smoking and faggots here's for a lot of deal. Hello
No
Yeah, no
Let me ask you a question sir. Yes, sir. Do I know you personally? No, why would you call me that?
Why would you call me by my real? I don't go by that name on air, but nobody calls me that except my relives
I've always wondered why do people do that when they call his show. What what is the attraction?
They want your real name come on. What do you prefer?
I prefer being called Neil or whatever the hell you want or asshole or anything like that, but not miles. Okay
It's just stupid. Why do people do that?
I don't know. Maybe it makes me feel like I've been getting myself people obviously. I'm not
No, I apologize. No, you're alienating yourself from the human race, but go ahead
I just want to say that
I wanted to thank George W. Bush for
Basically taking us from being a laughing stock in the world to being
perceived as the bully warm-ongering country of the world and
Democrats better get the crap together and find somebody that doesn't want to make it puke
Or we're really asked if you know what I mean. Okay
Thanks Neil. Okay. Oh Canada
Bush blocks deal allowing cheap drugs for the world's poor by the way. So this is the British
A newspaper the Guardian
George Bush is close links with the drugs industry were last night. This is today's paper by the way
So it is last I blame for the failure of toxin Geneva aimed at securing access to cheap medicines for developing countries
Delegates that the world trade organization expressed frustration that the US again rejected the deal
That would have loosened global patent rules to enable poor countries to import cheap copies of desperately needed drugs
We believe that governments should maintain their distance and should not be directed by pressure groups one EU trade officials said
Negotiator said a solution to the dead likely in America's hands the pharmaceuticals lobby is running the show in Washington
One development activist said
The pharmaceuticals lobby in Washington is running the show and not only that
But since I am in Canada I should mention to you any of you people have bought your prescription drugs on the web on the internet
You're familiar with that aren't you a lot of the companies up there?
We're some prescription drugs had much reduced prices and not gouging the public like they do all over America
Well guess what the drug companies got together and they said well
We're not gonna supply with any of our drugs anymore unless you quit doing that
Right
So we're not gonna let the American consumer
Have a get any kind of a break. We're gonna continue gouging and raping you as opposed to like up here
We're even by a leg over to counter so Claretons over to counter down there Clareton was over to counter here for years
The price of prescription drugs here is a fraction of what it is in America
Why is it that the public continues to want to be raped and pillaged by these rich assholes?
I don't get it and speaking of being raped and pillaged
Where's that other store which I'm sure is on the website Florida Attorney General calls for US
They didn't have to be on the website's in the Sunsendal
Florida Attorney General calls for US inquiry to soaring gas prices
The state attorney general wants federal investigators to find out whether Florida gas stations are taking advantage of the threatened war in the middle east to artificially drive up prices
And that really calls for investigation you know what
Don't you think we ought to explain this for me check it on that. It's a very big mystery
We have no idea what the answer is attorney general Charlie Christ Jesus Christ. Oh Charlie Christ
Asked the FTC on Tuesday to investigate the recent dramatic spike in gas prices
Florida's average cost per gallon for regular gasoline yesterday was a buck 66 up 19 cents from month earlier and 56 cents more than a cost
E.R. Go currently American Automobile Association
It's the highest average price ever in Florida and now three cents more than the national average at the time of the year when gas prices are usually lower
Triple A said because it's not like the height of the tourist season
In soft Florida gas prices are even higher the averages between the bucks six bucks 70 and bucks 72 and brown
Data in Palm Beach counties triple A said
I'm concerned that some companies or retailers are taking advantage of the impending crisis to increase their profits by unjustifiably
Ricing prices quest set and letter the FTC commissioner Timothy J. Muiros and it goes on and on and on
More tax cuts for the wealthy for the big corporations. They continue raping the public the pharmaceutical companies all in bed with the big politicians of both parties
And the public keeps going little more like that
And you know what I think I think Moe had a point
Was how when he said gang rape is funny because that's what's happening in America
That's exactly how to describe it. Thanks Moe

Clarence is a hard-ass and there's afraid that they're gonna take away some of the thunder from the QAM website
Even though they have their own webcam and they do something that's totally different from the sports nerds
The other 16 or 18 hours of the day. Yeah, that's them. Oh, I thought so
560 560 quit being a hard-ass class course
Part of the sportsocracy in our radio station as much as we like him on payday, which is only a week from yesterday
As much as we like him on the 10th and 25th of each month the rest of the time a little on a marginal side
All clearance because of the fact he's part of a sports mafia at QAM
He's part of the problem not part of the answer. You know what I'm saying?
No, what are you saying? So when you call the board of station to tell me you're feeling better and he answers the phone sports
Even though it's supposed to be the program director's office you say to yourself. Oh
Everything you need to know exactly. That's right in like a in a fraction of a second that one sports
That's all I needed no in case I hadn't already learned it
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello. Hey Neil. How are you doing? Are you okay? Um, I'm sorry
I just soon did I believe you during Canada now is that correct? Yes
Okay, so you probably did not see what I saw if I have a news
I don't know if someone told you about about the mold and the duct
No, okay, well, it was that moldy ducts
There was a special on one of the the news reports or something I find about mold and the ducts the air ducts and the air conditioning bands and so forth
And I heard you talk about it before on your station that you had a problem in the actual studio or the station or whatever
I was sure you do we got a bad problem in your fact when I come back
I'm getting a I'm getting one of those type of filters for the room. I was actually curious because I'm I am my family

Which does she keep her job?
They found a hundred ballots or a box of ballots or something
You know, you know the answer to the question because they've got everybody intimidated now
They black pressure groups have got everybody intimidated
And even though there was the pulled on the paper a day that says that more than two-thirds of the people say she's incompetent
But the pressure groups have got her in there and they're holding her hand now in each one of these small
Municipal elections to make sure she doesn't screw up again anytime soon
And they're keeping her in there even though they know damn well that she's incompetent
Well, you know I
Makes no sense because if I live in my job and I would screw up like that
Obviously, I'd be fired but I just got to explain to why why it is that's that's the way it is with minorities in the US

Love the pretty button 560 wqm and of course the battle of the sexes who we what that was all about the fact that most
heterosexual men for whatever reason
I'm still a maybe because they're so terrorized traumatized by their wives their girlfriends their mothers are all of the above
Have this deep-seated hatred of women
It's got one biggest bag
Is that it? Well, that's one reason. Well, that is one of many reasons of course in your mother's case
We don't have a lot of have no more but at any rate
So that's really what that's all about is this uh with this misogynistic just obnoxious hate all women kind of thing
I like it. It's really uh, whatever
Why do we speak to a woman? Why are we supposed to care about lacy Peterson?
They had that meeting and decided we're supposed to care about herself. I see
Well, I don't want to be left out on the limb again, but I guess you know, why not?
I don't care about lacy Peterson. I don't wish you're pregnant. I don't wish her any harm
She was pregling and all this other stuff
But I mean there's so many missing women and so many missing children thousands and thousands and we never hear about any of the rest
The mix of maybe on John Walsh's show or something like that. No, by the way, is his show still on? Yeah
I don't know what it's on, but I see promo is known and I guess I'm like I think between four and five or five and six in the afternoon
Something like that. I saw like about two minutes of it once
I mean America's most wanted is still on techie or because that's a good show, but uh, I don't know about that
But anyway, we hear a little bit about that, but lacy Peterson. They decided is the next Sean relieving
Right and her husband. What does his name Scott? I don't yeah, I guess they were hyperventilating yesterday
We think with all the stuff that's going on in the world
You know, we're on the verge of blowing the world up between Iraq and North Korea and Iran and all these other crazy people and George W
And they're going on about oh
Breathless they have to interrupt that MSNBC about how oh it's god Peterson was just served again another reward for a
Another search warrant not arrested not charged with any crime another search warrant. How do you like that? Oh
That pretty exciting. I feel better. No, man
I don't care about lacy Peterson. I'm very sorry in spite of the fact the news media tells me I'm supposed to be how many times
I told you people that's the problem or one of the many problems of the news media America
They tell you what you're supposed to be concerned about this is important. No, it's not. No, it's important
Anyway, here's a fact from George a different George says hey Neil
I'm vendure came out okay from the stroke you had recently. I was wondering if there's anything you want to do before you croak
Is there anybody you'd like to do? Yeah, I'm gonna go question. Oh, I say
Yes, there are and I'm working on it feverously. Okay. There are a lot of people I like to do
Does I know you've traveled the world of enjoyed many luxury such as your sports cars? What's missing in your life to make it complete George asks?
Hey, that's a good list building pole idea. What do you mean by that? What do you want to do before you croak?
Who do you want to do before you croak? Well take that option out of I don't know their names necessarily right
P.S. Do you still have your Corvette? Yes. He's to love talks about them and the NSX is wondering if you might consider having a pull on America's favorite sports car
No, that will definitely give you lots of materials instead of the movie musicals for change fast cars and women are always on men's mind
What do you think George? No
Thank you anyway George a lot of George is around you know what five six seven oh five sixty pond five sixty only eighteen and tea
Actually one of the things I look forward to tremendously is retirement. Oh, huh
In like three years ten and a half months, but who's counting?
A little less than ten and a half months right that's what I look forward to I like to get out of this radio station alive
That's all and believe me surviving Greg Reed alive is a major accomplishment
Because the long line of bodies who have perished both physically and spiritually under the Greg Reed regime is just legendary
It's just unbelievable
Arbitron survey backs US radio consolidations. You want to say where that is?
A radio listener survey released yesterday bolstered acclaimed by major US radio chains and industry
Consolvation has proved more provided more local flavor and diversity in programming drawing criticism that it was biased
Report by Arbitron radio survey company found that listeners were very pleased with the programming choices available to them
About 79% that they got more or the same amount of programming choices from local radio than they did five years ago
I'm going to be sick skeptic said the report was biased as it came from a company whose businesses perpetuated
By the growth of big radio company profits
The federal government is in the process of evaluating changes and potentially allowing further consolidation
While the broadcast industry has an obvious agenda to defend these changes and push for more said Michael
Bracy legislative director for the future of music coalition artist and consumerry and to think think it's clearly in their best interest to say that radio is great
He said even though all of us know that it sucks the big one. Okay. It bites. It blows
And South Florida is living proof of it radio and South Florida blows. It's a piece of crap man
It's like a steamy floating turd like the one that that brought fun in the backseat of her car
That's what it is a big smelly steamy turd
Every single market in America here's dr. Laura here's Lordass here's uh uh
Jordan Lydia all the same goddamn shows all the same prefabricated music formats
crap
Because they have a lot of a handful. I mean you could count about the fingers of one hand of companies to own the overwhelming majority of all the stations and now now they're saying oh well
I didn't go far enough
Let them own airy station
So you can hear the same speed them and crap all over the place
So that not only for the people listening but also the people in this industry it's just like this Greg Reid thing
They know damn well where else are you gonna go you gonna go work for David Ross and Cheat Channel?
No, that's why they jerk everybody around
Besides the fact that they're cheap and they're always paying a rob and Peter to pay Paul and to pay all these outrageous sports franchise fees
You know why they pay all the sports uh franchise fees sports. Yeah, that's it
So Greg Reid can be a sports maven oh we can have the heat we can have this and we have yeah and and
And what about it?
Are they making a lot of money with those things? No other than a dolphins
You show me anything on this radio station
It's making them a lot of money has anything to do with sports and I'll show you a guy damn cow in a Chinese shop
Forget about it
um
5 6 7 0 5 60 we got it's corn dog Wednesday if you I am
Tomorrow be cornhole Thursday
And then glory whole Friday come up this Friday here's keep a scheme hello
Very good here's crawl springs hello
Oh
Nobody there either okay down to two let's see we got what 22 minutes to go I don't think two calls gonna cut it for quite early right right five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty see they're trying to prove to me that they have nothing to say
And the same handful of the same handful of little see that's why for anybody that missed it about you're going
At this time just a little bit beyond that right
Is when I started to schmit can and the goddamn phone calls going all the bedtime stories and I still say I don't care
What any of you say see I it's much easier to do this for me talk to a bunch of mouth readers on the phone without a doubt
Just parts of the book those shows were so much more productive
I felt so much more like accomplishing something when I finished them and I'm not supposed to accomplish anything
Is what I've learned in that last year
What I'm supposed to accomplish is sit here and talk to a bunch of simple things because the other people find it entertaining
The other people who don't read the newspapers no read the bedtime stories they don't want to hear that crap
They're not interested in that crap
Look at even today even out of the corn dog. What does that tell you?
That it's special we didn't play the right game today. That was the problem. We didn't give them the right toy to play with today
If there were a way to know here's pop it. Oh, hello Neil. Yes, sir. Hi
Hey, uh, it was watching the sports center
That you know my Tyson's having a fight this weekend. You don't know. Yes. Yes. What pal? We don't care
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line. Here's Vokit. Hello
Hello, yes, sir
Oh, I'm in trying for four days. I know that the uh
Paul is over
I'm not sent school stupid movies
But the king of all time was Don Johnson's debut in a boy in his book. You remember that one already talked about that
Are you did? Yeah, I'm a limited driver and I'm in and out of the car, but I listen to you every single day
Well, thank god for you, man. Okay, I just I didn't hear you mention that
But I thought it was the stupidest but the king of all time stupid movies you did I did I thought it was a great movie
Yeah
When they surprised them that he can't go to bed with all the women he has to have a mechanical
Mershavation machine. Yeah, he had a little tube going. Yeah. Yeah, that was a that that brought me up
I was thought about that movie for years
Anyway, I think your show is great. It's great to have something different out of year and I agree with you with more with the morning
I hear him go on at six o'clock and whatever time he goes on and I shut him right away
I can't wait. I really can't wait for you to come on at nine o'clock, but I wish you'd go back to spend that's kind of how I feel
I can't wait to one o'clock. Okay, I have a great day
You too. Thank you
Hey, I'd like to go back to 10 to 2 also, but to see they created this problem now
They don't know how to fix it. They don't know how to sort. Uh, you know, follow what I'm saying. Yeah, I know
They know how to make it right. That's Greg read for it like it's a Humpty Dumpty thing
You know all the king's horses and all the king's asses couldn't put it together again. That's you Greg
Nice job point to figure out everybody else try to throw everybody else out of the bus for your own bad moves Greg
Not full on this kid. Not for a minute and by the way, why do you write a gift norm is check? Okay?
Quit playing games with people's money
One of the things I love about this company is that people that when they make you wait for a check and they finally get the check and they'll get the check and they'll look and see that it was dated like two months before
Yeah, but it didn't have the little squiggle on the bottom. In other words
Uh, it's the Robin Peter to pay Paul thing again
So you hold back a bunch of checks long enough and keep checking at bank account to see if they can give this one his bonus check and pay this one for the
Marlins games see how that works at Q.A.M. Yeah, we're not liquid yet. That's how it works liquid
If you call that liquid, not least part of it sometimes
1142 at 560 especially when you work for Greg. In fact a lot of times
I want to tell you one more time today that size makes a big difference in spite of what anybody else tells yet

I'm reading this thing wrong what it says on the align there on line 12
Yep, that's it.
Hello Jeff.
Yep. I'm just making sure you're still feeling okay
But but also I have to thank City furniture because after you helped me they were unbelievable
They came right back out six my kids beds
Were polite drivers and give me any hard time. They did an awesome job. I have great furniture
All that taking care of City furniture rules. Thank you for your health. Deal
What's happening?
Have a great day, Jeff.
What?
Why did you put him on?
I mean we love Jeff Cohen. Good guy. Long time friend and sponsor
But you know it the idea that he's just going to use this show as his personal play toy every day
Now that I'm up here that's unacceptable. Carlos
You better straighten that little spick out George
What do you want me to say?
It's stupid. No, not a question of what you say after the show is out over today.
Oh, straighten him out. Get a two by four. Get that machete over there to one add some against the wall the OJ one
I'll take his toilet treat bag away from it. There you go
Limit his his his preparation for leaving the studio to like 25 minutes and see how he reacts
Oh now you're being uh overboard over to your line five six. I can't believe he just did that to me again. Why is he doing that?
Is he losing it?
Did I give him a nice uh a wild extended plug yesterday my good friend Jeff Cohen?
Oh, that's right you're gonna say anything as you want to keep getting fed for free. I forgot about it
I like Jeff Jeff's always been there. I like him too, but I just I find it just appalling
I have no words to describe the shock and the smell
Maybe we don't have like a regular feature on a show of beats most of the other calls we get anyway
We'll just have a regular feature where Jeff calls in and just to use his five minutes of the show every day for free
Why that limited to him you got lots of sponsors
The other people don't do that they don't use the show to exploit for fun and profit. They don't do that. Do they?
No, I guess they don't oh
Here's hi Aliah. This should be a good call. Hello. What's up, Neil? Yes, sir. I will save you from the corn dog
Yeah, one that I would like and desert island all that I want some red snapper man
Yeah, how bet I'll bet you do
I see I thought that was an interesting topic, but you know what the problem is they don't
No, no, that is the problem
But you know what I'm saying in other words they evidently maybe that's only for us real fat people
And since I'm the only fat one connected with the show
Uh, I guess I'm way out of line again
Something that comes up a lot people are always asking that what would you know if you could
Be one food if you're a spread out of desert island and you could have as much of it as you want to
But be the only thing you could have that you would we'll keep you happy
We could do all of it. I said Roger's almond brittle because it's the most delicious thing
I've had in years. It's its candy, but it's great
And that's so yeah, you would get sick and die from it
But you're gonna get sick and die anyone and desert island where would that's just for fun
All see you say just for fun. They don't want to do that. They don't want to do that
I thought it was an excellent topic, but you know corn dog is the one answer we got in other hours very good
And snapper
Well, that's another story at least he didn't say black stone ash like you said
459 votes on the pool. What would be the happiest of Neil croaked

We got to put Jeff Cohen on here again to snore the show again
Which I'm just in shock that he would do that again. Don't go having a stroke. No
I'm just I'm just not happy. I'm really not happy. They did that you know because I could I could left him just hanging there
That would have been rude, you know
He's calm to see if I'm still okay. I'm telling you what call me again about 130 Jeff see if I'm still and then about three and then about four
15 would be good
Don't call between no don't call between three and four cuz passions is on at that time
Gali Miss Molly. Here's Miami. Hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? I'm doing good. I've got a question. I'm a little confused about the the North Korea
Problem. I know that the last thing I read was about it. I suppose I guess we cut off some type of fuel shipment which
I just gave them a reason to try to start up this nuclear program
I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped the that shipment in the first place
We stopped the shipment of
Well, no, it was
nerve gas
Wasn't it was it was a
It was a scud that we stopped with the nerve gas. I have the story right here. So if you listen now, I'll read it
Cargo of several tons of chemical that can be used as a precursor to nerve gas was delivered in North Korea recently more the same ship
That was intercepted last December a hauling scud missiles to Yemen the Washington Times said yesterday
Intelligence sources said the shipment of sodium cyanide arrived in North Korea in port of Nampo last week
Aborder freighter So san which is the same ship that was stopped in the Indian Ocean by US and Spanish warships as it sailed for Yemen with 15 missiles and warheads
The So san was allowed to continue its voyage with its cargo intact after US official determined that the Yemeni government legally purchased the scuds
After unloading in Yemen the So san picked up the sodium cyanide in Germany and was tracked by US intelligence services as it sailed back to North Korea the time said and that great
It was tracked back we didn't do anything about it. We just uh, you know watched it
I just want to go back at you. There you go. Sodium cyanide. Maybe they're just using it for something else like you know
treating meat something like that
5670560 pound 560 on a AT&T line. Here's Davy. Hello
Davy hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. Hi Neil. How you doing? Okay? Um Neil. I have the misfortune of having to drive i95
About once or twice a month from here up to Washington DC and you're riding along
Listed on the radio trying to find a station. It's impossible all the stations sound the same everything clear channel owns everything right or some other group owns it
And if you turn it on in that we're land those stations sounds the same as the Jacksonville station sounds the same as the Charlotte station
Right and it's sad. It's really sad. There is no diversity. There is no variety
It's all the same if I hear a stairway to heaven again. I'll blow my brains out. Yeah
You know, it's all the same stuff
So I don't know who these people are saying about there's more selection and stuff
And I have to I have to laugh when they talk about the diversity it's created
Let's take South Florida to Miami market as an example
All the stuff that's been going on in the news the last few months and since 9 11
If you really want to find out after nine o'clock in the morning
If you want to find out any news about what's happening in the world you can forget about it because they're thanks to clear channel
There is no more news station when they bought all those stations from Paxon
W I N Z was all news and W I would be was at talk station. Yep, then they swapped that out
Then they tried to talk on I and Z and that flopped one over like a pregnant pole of order
Then they made it into Fox sports because it was cheap and they opened up a pot and I'll let you just put that syndicated crap on there
And they turn I would be into supposedly the news station, but guess what the news is on in the morning only
And the rest of the day we have a bunch of syndicated crap. That's great. That's correct
So if you're driving around like in the middle of September the top of an hour
But in the middle of an hour and you really want to find an all-new station in South Florida, guess what? Don't have one good luck
Yeah, thanks, Neil. You took your other show. Thanks. I'm in my see. I see there's a good guy. He's happy
He likes the show. He's honest about radio with sucks
And seriously if you want to find out what's going on I had the same experience. Well, I was there
On days when they were like pressing and more important things than who want to go to the ball game or you know about the Tyson fight or some crap who won some goddamn golf tournament
And you flip around the dial and there's nothing there is no such thing it doesn't exist in South Florida
So they've taken two formally sensational radio stations WI and Z 50,000 once and WI would do what some of us know a little bit about and they've turned them into crap
crap
I
Say let's have 20 all sports stations at a market then Greg can have hemorrhoids all all year round
Because the room around here is he's crappin' in his pants about 850 is going 50,000
Who gives a crap if they go two million watts?
They're in Palm Beach County. They have nothing to do with us
Always crappin his pantaloonies remember the fan first went on the year and he's fighting lawsuits
He's having a nervous breakdown see the people that have a nervous breakdown and file lawsuits other people
I have no idea what they're doing. That's what the problem is when you're insecure and you haven't got a clue
And the fact of the matter is that after five years they still don't understand what this show is all about
That's the best part of the deal. They haven't got a clue what this is all about or how to make it work
But anyway have a nice day Greg sports and pain norm sports
Four minutes till noon at 560 well at least we closed out the phone segment today with a guy that had something to say
How do you like that? Huh? When I could wait long enough
No seriously because it's psychologically that made that makes me almost want to come back again tomorrow
And then I think about the fact that next Tuesday's the 25th and there will be paychecks plural air for me on the 25th right clearance
And so it'll be worth coming back
And if not, I'll just call clearance up and he'll say sports
