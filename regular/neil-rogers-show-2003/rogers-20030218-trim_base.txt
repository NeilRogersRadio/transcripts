Now he made me conscious about it. Don't you feel a little self conscious? No, I
Don't I mean
So anyway, the support yesterday we got a pretty good response on that the only problem being that George is pissed off and fired up about the result
Yeah, well the most bizarre movie you've ever seen pulp fiction went by a landslide
But we'll get to that in a second South Korea before you get into a big panic today
I know everybody's on edge of course for the purple alert and
South Korea it was a nutcase a nut job of

So there's a big conch terms about that is they're trying to you know find the skate code and
Who's responsible for these why do they keep calling it a stampede? Isn't that kind of an unusual?
Yeah to apply to people but nevertheless yeah
Stampede what would you call it?
I don't know stampede. I guess okay
Color terrible disaster 21 people dead and
That was another thing speaking to people being edgy
They thought because a couple of their friends have it only got sick and we're like passing out inside their club right poison
I assume that they assumed that it was poison
Yeah, right because we're all getting
Where would they get that idea? I don't know maybe from the federal government or some
Panic man, I don't know and so they all started hitting for the exits because they wanted to get out as fast as they could and
Escape the poison gas that wasn't there in the first place and a whole bunch of people died
Speaking of that Japanese tourist are arrested with gas canister and grill at Miami Airport

Yeah, and I'm sure enough he done labeled it and labeled it on of it
Yeah, well don't make them a stick again and get a new phone. Thank you. That was great and a watch would be good and a watch would be excellent
And like a compass and a road map would be excellent too. It was listening on his way to somewhere last night the Lord asked

He told me had a little gas and his canister
Ishi girl was taken into custody when he refused to give up the canister two boxes of matches and a barbecue grill

He was sent at this kid the Steve Beckler who died from heat stroke the world's picture that he was taken pills with a fed rain
Right now I just printed out the latest the very latest updated story from sports illustrated on this
And they still haven't done the octopsie Brawich County Medical Examiner doctor Joshua purpose said a bottle of pills was found in Beckler's locker
But it was unclear if he had taken any of them or if they contributed to his death
The octopsie said would help determine that asked about reports the pills were a supplement containing a fed rain pepper said
He didn't know what type of pills they were saying they could be anything from medication to vitamins
Okay, I just mentioned that now maybe there was some other information here that they knew on a morning show do you think?
I don't think oh well that's good
That's probably just as well when you work on that place don't think too much now
You notice that pause there in the last break before I hit the acute yes
Now you're gonna hear a lot of those you want to know why was that because I'm just I'm taking an easy next day
By all means just here's the I don't want to feel stressed and pressed
You know like we're on the like air I mean he's got to be like real you know
We don't need to do that loosen up
They need to loosen it up a little bit
I mean the guy just had a stroke a week ago Sunday night meaning me for crying
I don't have to sit here like on the edge of my seat like we're you know like on some real kind of a radio station
We're not on a real uh oh we're here at QA I'm looking for a read I mean that's that in itself speaks volumes now
Take it every bit as seriously as they do
Very well said I think George
That is an excellent uh view on a way we should do things from now on from this moment forward
We're gonna take our jobs just as seriously the whole this whole business
And a whole QA M experience just as seriously as management prize

Yeah
I'd like to have a lunch that like you know looks back at you as we're gonna go to that trade-out hotel up the coast
Anyway, I see there's a change in the schedule. I'm not touching that with your tongue, okay
Uh Tuesday February 18th and looking at the schedule and I see a change on here that was just facts to me and it looks uh very very important
U.M. A Providence basketball cancel last night for obvious reasons because of the horrendous weather
And so it's gonna be on tonight but not on QA because we got the Panthers at the Cunodians
So we got on Waxi 790
Oh my right we got that game of some time it doesn't bother putting the I guess uh 730
I'm assuming I
Nobody cares anyway. No, no, I mean you know they put all this stuff on there like uh, you know
It's something to do clearance. I guess it's something to keep you busy and make you look very program directorish
But nobody gives a crap oh my oh my Waxi 790 good golly miss Molly, you know
How about a half an inch of snow here in Toronto?
I guess I already mentioned that but just so you don't feel too bad for me not not too much
Still a little bit of few flakes out there but warming up almost to uh
Acceptable stages
Here's the a poll for today which we're gonna put together again
Now some people in the audience are gonna say oh you're not doing a movie pull again two days in a row are you yeah?
Why not?
Really it went over so well yesterday was phenomenal
Don't you think yeah
I usually have a couple of bedtime stories and I also have the tabloids for example
I've got a choice what I'm gonna do is like mix and match all the jack-o stories
So I can jack-o
Interest them with uh what
Powerful I'm I'm just saying that they're all so good between the globe the star and the inquirer
And then of course Lisa Maria and not the Lisa Marie Debbie Roe
He counts exclusively her globe reader is the intimate details of her marriage to the king of pop yeah
Which of course was a sham the boys and his bed her tragic miscarriage and the mystery of the frozen placenta ooh
It's mystery the truth behind the Peter Pan nose job
And all of these things so basically most of the stuff that was good in the tabloids was about Michael
I've re I've discovered why there are so many people obsessed with Michael Jackson again in these stories
You want to know why don't please lay that on us because it has nothing to do with Iraq and the war oh
Good point now. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm just taking the easy way out like that bitch said to you that one day a month or two ago
Maybe it's a cop-up, but the fact of the matter is I think there's a certain burnout factor if you catch my drift
Ha ha ha ha ha
Just a little bit of a burnout. Yeah, and they're also they're dropping rumors
I think they're trying to you know lay it to us gently
That any time of the next couple of days the orange alert which I know what a CNN is finally dropped MSNBC still has it on there
I don't know about foxes. I don't watch them
But the orange alert may be ruled back to yellow
So we don't have to be quite so hysterical anymore and a lot of people are gonna be really pissed off
You know the people who went out there and bought the duck tape on
Of his queen and this queen and that queen they're gonna be pissed off. Maybe they're gonna take it back
Oh
I hope they put no refunds at home people on all the crap that they sold to people no refunds. Well keep it for a cloudy day
For a mushroom cloudy day. I keep it handy just in case a radioactive cloudy day because come to fight out that some of the
Good part of the rationale that they got everybody all panicky about came from a an unreliable
Alcatta prisoner who lied they give a lie detector test they said wow
He lied. It's a bunch of bull crap
Now what was this are you did you just fact is back to me?
Oh, yeah, thanks to back to you. I meant to fact that there

Each day after you have a stroke each day your brain on skit see your brain has to heal

Understand that there are cells that die on your stroke, right?
And your brain has to heal and you have this feeling of like all this blood in the top of your head

She got the telegram and her husband died in the award
And she gets the telegram and she's of course crying and just the totally distraught and Gary Grimes comes in
And she undresses him
And hops in the sack and then of course he never sees Ray the movie he starts out and then at the end the narration of Gary Grimes is an adult
There are few movies like that. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, it's like a flashback kind of like Joe Gerstin, you know

While he's looking that up here's a trivia thing
She was the same actress that was in flash Gordon as one of Ming's evil hench women
But you don't know who it is. Well, she's worrying like a thing over her head so you can't recognize her not like some Italian swept away by an usual destiny in the blue sea of august

Fort Lauderdale hello
Yes, sir. Yes, you're feeling better. Thanks. First the correction. It was
Jessica Lang with Nicholson and the postman only rings twice not Kathleen Turner. Okay, and then
I have two and they're both Ellen Barkin movies one is Sea of Love
And the other one that I don't recall the name of it it came out a couple years ago
She plays a detective and she investigates a murder that involves a club of
It's a lesbian club and she kind of gets drawn into it really yeah
Both very good movies somebody will know that one. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Sea of Love one of my favorite songs by Phil Phillips
And then the honeydrippers made it which sure was pointless. Why do they do that to make money the money money trippers
The money drippers I need when the song is redone that never should have been redone in the front
In fact, that would be a good pull right that would be an excellent pull what was what song was remade
Uh, that never should have been made in the first place. I mean, there's some way to word that right
I'm not sure I do that to not know what you mean
You know what I mean sure in fact, I like to impose when the audience can't exactly figure out what we mean
Because then they really get all screwed up sea of love with Ellen
Looks like she took a bad hit to the face Barkin really. Oh god. Maybe that's why it's out of her mouth her mouth is crooked
Yeah, not to mention the rest of her face, which is also crooked and so that's pretty erotic to me
Yeah
erotic
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T line
It's just changing for the first time over here. Let's take a look
Nine and a half weeks has got eight body heat for the two moon moon junction three
Unfaithful three and then the Mahal and drives got a pair blue lagoon's got two somebody else out there enjoyed blue lagoon
Of course, they probably enjoyed Brooke Bush shields and her body double
Well, that's right. She had a stunt double in her because she used to be a taken on a
Yeah, she knows you know, poor little Brooke in that stuff. Well, she didn't pretty pay this is the same 14 year old
She was 14 years old. She was doing those Levi's ads or whatever they were slapping her ass on the thing on the cheeks
Yeah, but you didn't see nipple
God forbid so Burke shield and Chris Atkins. No forget about him
I did mention before the show to George that last night
I saw about five minutes of a movie called if it's Tuesday it must be Belgium
That we've all heard of that movie, but did anybody ever actually see it
No, nobody ever saw it
So I saw part of it last night and it was about these American tourists around a tour bus
And they visit a whole bunch of different European countries in like 16 days or something and they spent a couple of days in Holland
It amps the damn and a couple days in Belgium, etc
And a cameo appearance in that movie by the lovely Luke Halpin who played the Sandion flipper
When he was just a little punk when he was flippin it and here was the Luke Halpin had a little cameo near about three four minutes
Was about I let's see 1969 he would have been about what George
Yes, can they but I just a joke just a little bit all of the type because just a joke probably about 20 years old
Looked really good could I use the next dream meal or two there?
I know if I'd have been an Amsterdam at the time I'd have fed him a couple of extra meals
But nevertheless Luke Halpin looking pretty good. We love you Luke. Even though you're old now and kind of a sour poise
Ever since that morning we called him live on Zeta on the earth, but he
He booked up a little bit he became a preacher. Do you know that no?
I didn't became a preacher or some kind of a born again guy boy
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 now. We'll say this
Oh wait a minute. There's a return to the blue lagoon
Yes
Mila Jovovich and I don't know that the guy is right. Yeah, how the guy sure is a hell lot better looking and Chris Atkins ever dreamed
I had a much more ample penis all the way never saw. Yeah, but hey listen
It just had to be you know return to the blue lagoon
It's right on there. I'm writing it on there right right. Do I want it on there? Are you crazy?
I'm gonna have to change my vote
Because you turned them because paradise was Willie Ames and
Phoebe case
Phoebe case the bird was a big fan of Phoebe if our Phoebe Kates because and I think Phoebe King too
Because he said she was voyish and goish and I think the boys part is what he was attracted to most
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a return to the blue lagoon should be noted that Mila actually does share her nipples with us in that movie unlike brook
I see well that was the real Mila okay, it's supposed to brook that pussy ice brook. She was too busy hanging out with Michael Jackson
Oh, oh, well wasn't that wasn't yes. I think even before maybe not before because Liz was always there
Brook Shields was
Yeah, what's your and the chip and bubbles? Oh
Good God. Oh, I was dating Michael. Yeah, she started talking like him too
Here's Miami. Hello
Miami when is this hello? Yes, sir?
Yeah, what about the movie monster ball with Hollywood? What was it monster ball with Hollywood?
Monster balls
Monster's ball
Monster's ball. Hollywood. Billy Bob Thornton. I understand that there's hot sex in there and you actually get to see his monster ball
Monster's ball. I didn't know how they very head monster balls. Maybe that's why she's having all that problem with the
That's on the tabloids but the sex seven does one good sex scene in a movie making an erotic movie even the movies not erotic at all
It's a matter of your choice. That's the point whatever it is that turns you on okay whatever cranks your chain
However desperate you are at the moment. What's the most erotic movie you've ever seen and the answer is
Monster balls. No, but what was Carlos just gonna say what are you uh
Are we asking I guess you must have seen that movie. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, because there's only one one really hot scene in it
And the rest is has is not erotic at all. It's well this guy that just ball he liked it. Okay. He said it was a three-hanky job
All right, so just leave him alone
Okay, most erotic know the rabbi says angel heart
I think that certainly qualifies. Don't it? Sure
The rabbi shame on you
He's been made with the gorge. It's is again
Oh, here's another uh the saline who with Molly Ivan's that's pretty interesting you were talking to Scott Chape and again
Huh, but what does that mean? I don't know which practice is were you talking to Scott Chape and again?
Feel better still all I see about having the stroke because the first one you remember that no
The first stroke I had at i.o.d. was run on the heels of that asshole Scott Chape and
Making a big song dance because of the fact that I was talking about I played that thing on the ear
That bill called her tape that bill had of that something from i.o.d from years ago
Where Raniri was on air and Henry Burrow and Bill and they were all ripping each other whatever from some Christmas party or something
And Phil costume was on there. Remember that?
What was before my time that I remember the stories and I think that's what precipitated that
In tempered display by Scott Chape and whose voices are on virtually every television station from coast to coast
He's making more money than all of us put together, but nevertheless. He's an asshole. Okay
Okay, I came in and just got me hysterical about that. Oh a lot of people are gonna have their feelings
As if we care on the show other paintings
You know, he was kind of like no. I he pretending he didn't get it and again underlining
Pretending he doesn't get it another train monkey. Yeah, right exactly very well put mo
And by the way if I have to I can't deal with it anymore hearing about tiger woods
Maybe it's just bad luck or maybe maybe he's monitoring
Maybe he knows what time I come sponsoring in here in the morning crawling in here in the studio and crank up the pot
Every time I open up the pot he's talking about tiger woods and Ernie L's and oh that's gonna be so wonderful to say

Anyway 10 20 at 5 60 W to Q I M we're doing the most erotic movie you've ever seen
Don't let me forget now behind the great divide by Paul Krugman
Okay, don't forget
It is one of the bedtime stories on our website today along with about a hundred million other ones
But that's good. I mean really
Excellent in terms of the difference of opinion about the whole Iraq thing in the US and the rest of the world
Because of the news media
Because of the way the stories are being presented and the fact that the news media here feel that they have to be like a bunch of cheerleaders
At least some of them not to mention of course the Fox people who feel that
The media is sick and they can't be happy
That said, we saw it get to that
Also the thing about the guy that access 2.2 million credit cards but hasn't used them yet
Hey, what is that all about?
Well, he's waiting
A hacker has gained access to as many as 2.2 million visa and mastercard accounts the two companies announced yesterday
The hacker breached the security system of a company that processes credit card transactions on behalf of merchants
Visa and mastercard be saying
None of the visa accounts has been used fraudulently visa spokesman John Abrams said the affected accounts make up about a third of one percent of the
560 million mastercard visa cards in the US spokesman for the two companies said they've notified the banks that issued the affected cards
Both card companies have zero liability policies which protect card was from being held responsible for an authorized or fraudulent charges
The audio now let me ask you what happens for example
Somebody steals your credit card right like those gypsy still my credit cards enroll many years ago
Right and they go and they make a bunch of fraudulent charges they get the merchandise from the stores. What happens to the merchants?
What happens to the merchants right because they're not going to get paid?
I guess they're screwed you think
Yeah, no there must be something they must have some kind of insurance whether agreement with the American Express or visa mastercard
There must be some kind of way than they get covered just like the card holder gets covered
I really don't know maybe maybe some astute listener out there will know just something to think about okay
Also, we got healthy ice cream question mark. I don't know if I want to talk about that. Just read about it on our website
Okay, I don't want to talk about ice cream
You'll be pleased to know that I haven't even thought about ice cream although I did discover it. I don't want to talk about it
No, my blood sugar is excellent. I'm coming along very nicely. Thank you. I blood pressure is outstanding
But I discovered something called almond brittle
You know how they have all this great candy up here that you don't find in the States correct
During the next break, I'm going to go into wastebask in the other room and just take the package out so I can tell you who makes it
And maybe you'll find it you and in your life. Of course Carlos wouldn't like it because it's mostly chocolate
And his taste is like Tush. I'll take his share
But oh my god anyway, you can't be next time listen trust me when I tell you you know it in order especially in the beginning
You have to tie yourself along you follow right with something not a lot not a whole bunch of them
But not a whole tirelessly long. That's right until you die
What what do you know about it? What do you know about having to lose weight? What do you have any? I've had to lose weight
When was that years ago? Yeah in my early 20s. I've had my answer to like maybe
30 pounds 30 pounds really yeah you were fat. I grew out of all of my clothes and I had to either buy you clothes
I never heard about this before
Huh? I tried to mention it, but you go like wave it off like it never really happened. You should see the pictures
Like you know who else used to be fat your best personal friend Rimmer
Yeah
Yeah, and then of course you discovered he had to start
Keep paying for the food if he was going to stay that fat and he couldn't afford it anymore
When I bought a car and stopped riding my bike I ballooned up practically overnight in the course of a year
I gained 30 plus pounds
I'll be damned well. It makes me feel a lot better
Here's Kansas City. It says hello

Jacko child sex scandal said to explode reports this week's inquirer
Have you read this? No the Michael Jackson child molestation investigation could explode spectacularly into the open once again
As a brand new witness who stayed with Michael at his neverland ranch considers telling all
The inquirer has learned exclusively
Nearly 10 years ago the singer's world caved in when a 13 year old boy accused the entertainer sexually abusing him
But the youngster did not testify against jacks new bodice silence for a staggering
40 million dollars the inquirer is withholding his name 40 million. You know what was that much?
I knew it was 30 something I didn't know it 40 million says the inquirer and the inquirer don't lie
Now the sensational scandal which jacks and the head hope was doused could reignite
Santa Barbara County Sheriff deputies were aware of these second youngster back in 94 disclosed insider
They talked with him and even had him in a safe house
But neither he nor the boy who brought the initial allegations made it to a grand jury
Because the first boy's family was paid off this boy and his family decided to back out
They didn't want to be the only ones taking on Michael
They were definitely fearful of what it might do to their lives especially to boys life
So they try to keep his involvement a secret and for the most part of the state a secret until now
But the past is being dredged up again in the boy now a young man is considering what to do the recent ABC special on Michael's odd life and a natural obsession with children
Has stirred up allegations that Jackson hope that this appeared but now is most frightening nightmares threatened to turn real
Robert Wagner reformer Beverly Hills Policeman employed his chief of security neverland ranch for three years has written a book that will
Rekindle questions about Jackson's sleepovers with young children
Wagner said he counted up to 150 youngsters who slept with Jackson between
1990 and 1993 he also said he was troubled by Jackson's habit of inviting favored children to a viewing booth in his private cinema
Where he says there was a bed and chair and then closing the curtains around them
What movies do you think they were watching in there George?
Erotic Santa Barbara District attorney Thomas Sneedon says the Jackson case from a decade or remains open but inactive
Now I'm not gonna read your book. Huh nothing it's my imagination
Inquirer files trip up Jackson's claims at the bottom they got like a little uh in set
With a few examples of the B.S. He was talking about that special which you'll notice he had to have his own special to be but it
No, no, it's about it
The inquirer caught the king of pop telling a number of bald face lies in the course of his TV special
Here are some of his claims coveted by the information from our files
Plastic surgery Jackson he claims he's had only two operations both on his nose the inquirer
Jackson has head up to eight operations on his nose
The vision he's had is jaw squared as eyebrows raised a club foot in his chin and since 1983 is progressively lighten his
Completion
Sleeping with children
Jackson he claims it's not sexual. We were going to sleep. I tucked them in it's very charming
Inquirer in the 1993 molestation investigation of Jackson the 13-year-old victim said he had sexual contact with me on many occasions
He kissed me on the lips
Gradually by the buttocks and put his tongue in my mouth. I told him I didn't like that
But he said there was nothing wrong. He said
Cancer boy Gavin Jackson
He uh Jackson held hands with 12-year-old Gavin during the interview and admitted they sleep to get in the same rooms
Flames he has permission from the boys family the inquirer Gavin's father
David Arvisa was outraged that the boys mother was lost into sleeping Jackson's bed and said it's obvious
Gavin shouldn't be up on Jackson's ranch unsupervised but his mother doesn't care
And parenthood Jackson claims he's a good parent for the inquirer top child care experts were stunned
At the way Jackson treated his children during the tipping of the TV special
Shakeily feeding his baby through a veil and making the older ones wear masks
New Jersey psychologists Dr. Patricia Ferrell said Jackson is contributing to serious mental health problems for these kids in the future
The father of the year Michael Michael
Motorcycle how do you like that?
That's just a little piece of intercourse the globe and the star each have their own take
Which we'll get to just briefly little tidbits here near because people do care
They do want to know right as much as we hate to admit it and you want to know why like I said before
Why because it's something different
I mean it's something old but it's something old. It's been brought back and it's not sawed him
And it's not a rack and it's not the bushmeister and it's not all these depressing grotesque it's not the orange alert
It's not Tom Raid. It's not cheesehead Tommy Thompson
See what I'm saying what's OJ up to
It's not OJ any all the way if he would want to go and kill somebody this week
I'm sure they'd love to hear about that too. Oh, can you imagine what a public service he'd be doing
I mean nobody important though. Jay nobody deserves to be alive. You know find some scumbag kill some people
There you go
The sailor who fell from grace with the sea
They say that on there. I saw it. Whatever. You know, we're not gonna argue with them

Do you know what Sarah Miles looks like? No, well
You know what Chris Christopher's and looks like. Yes. All right. Shave his beard. They're Sarah Miles. I see
Offbeat moody romantic melodrama about the effect of wintered women's affair on some critics were mixed
Erotic love scenes idiosyncratic
script
Seacost landscape appeals to fans of non-mainstream love stories. I already wrote it down
And did you know what I'm gonna say her who yeah, I won't get a vote. It's too long to write it down
The sailor who fell from grace with the sea
Oh, what is that?
A sliver with Sharon Stone where she spreads her legs that was basic instinct where she uh spreads her legs
But nevertheless don't confuse them. Well, what about sliver? I don't know about sliver. Yes
Did he like another like spread another was a shower scene
Those cameras there was a shower scene and seen in psycho, too, but it wasn't an erotic movie
neurotic
Corriguer carcola
Some is got color you learn here, which we already got it. No, it was x-rated
And a little humor and as deliverance Ned Vady puts on the Academy Award winning performance right as he takes it back to him
Uh video drum, which was on a poor yesterday
It says was an 80s movie where a woman was having sex with a demon that was in her home
I was still scraping off the sponge on my ceiling from watching that one and you say
That whatever
But what kind of an answer is that I'm sitting here with my pen poised
Waiting for a decision. I like that. It was a good movie
I know I didn't consider it erotic. I mean in spite of Debbie Harry who didn't show us anything in that was she Harry?
No
She was dressed that's what America wants to know was Debbie Harry
So we still haven't got the name of that movie that the guy was just dying
Uh, but he got it off the fact as a matter of fact. I think what was it?
Somebody says that it's called exotic gun the chick wears a schoolgirl outfit and the customer becomes obsessed with her very hot
All right, uh for Mark who sent another facts and uh
Mark has good taste
Because he made a suggestion on the previous facts that I just sent you
The only facts that I got you just sent me is the new copy for dial amateurs

You know what's how Gilbert fit right in there so this period is so pretty.
I just checked Gilbert and Eric is the answer is still no.
1047 at 560 WQA.
Our audience right on top of it, a merchant is responsible for the charges that result from a stolen card.
It's the responsibility of the merchant to establish proof the card does in fact belong to the card holder, the buyer.
I take credit cards over the internet which is a high risk.
I get about four chargebacks per month stolen card.
Thank you very much.
And here's another one.
There are different rules pertaining to liability responsibilities for credit card usage.
If the merchant is an internet or mail order telephone or to merchant, there are no effective ways they can authenticate the identity of the consumer making the purchase, nor is there usually a signature to go with a purchase.
When there's a fraudulent transaction that takes place, the merchant is liable for the transaction and any penalties associated with the transaction.
In the physical world as usually a signature associated with the transaction, even if the transactions are fraudulent when the card holder is responsible for 50 bucks that a transaction amount, while the issue is responsible for the rest.
In most cases, the issue or waves the $50.
Thank you very much Mike.
Carlos with the K and Eric Carlos with the K from yesterday.
Yes.
Rhymes with say.
He says how about cruel intentions one and two.
I wrote him down already, but whatever.
Well, if you're going to write these down, don't I mean let me know about it.
I'm just staying ahead of the game so that I can give them to Carlos so that we don't fall behind.
I see cruel intentions one and one and two.
I mean you're just cruel intentions.
There was a hot kiss in one of them.
Mom just put me up.
Now here's the fact it's very important.
It goes to show that even though we have two computer aces here, computer nerds, that we still need the audience to be monitoring them at all times very carefully.
Because we're not perfect, even Eric's not perfect.
I went to your site to vote for the summer of 42 and it appears that Eric as an error.
Eric has listed summer lovers twice and left out summer 42 wanted to let you know.
Thank you very, very much again.
Now let me just monitor this.
Okay, we're monitoring you, Eric.
I'm looking, I think they're from the summer of 42 with five votes.
I see summer lovers only once.
So like I said, I retract my thank you, Betty, Betty, much and whatever.
Maybe they just couldn't find it, you know.
I'm looking at summer 42 right now.

It says that was the one with James Mason.
Let's see a theme.
That was one with James Mason.
Was it?
I believe.
I don't think I ever saw it.
You never saw James Mason and Suanne line in Lolita.
Maybe you never saw Judy Garland and James Mason in the stars born.
You're right.
I didn't.
Oh my god.
And I'm going to tell you there's another.
That would be a good movie for poll two.
Movies that had no business being remade.
Not tell you one right now.
Well speaking of Mo.
Speaking of Mo.
La Cajafol.
What was the name of the Robin Williams?
That's where he got that Faggot owner.
What is the thing is from?
The Bird Cage.
The Burke.
If ever there was a movie that it was a crime to remake.
That was it.
And what was the Hitchcock movie that Faggot remade because some Hitchcock movie?
That everybody said, why did they do that?
Well, they might have been psycho like three times.
It was psycho.
You're right.
It might have been Rear.
Break them.
Window.
How do we call them re-naked that one?
What's that?
Rear window.
No, I was a...
You forget about it.
You weren't with me on that.
I think Roger Vadim's and God created a woman with Rebecca DiMorne was a very central film.
What was the movie she was in that I liked so much?
Where she played the Housekeeper's name?
The Hand that Rocks the Canadian.
I loved that movie a lot.
It was just fine.
It wasn't sexy or erotic or anything.
No, it was just the fine.
It was good.
It was like a scary, you know?
And she played a real bitch.
The Hand that Rocks the Canadian.
Anyway, it says Roger Vadim's and God created a woman with Rebecca DiMorne was central.
Also think Roger Vadim's and God created a woman with a rigid part.
Doe in 1957 was very erotic.
The only similarity between the two was the title and the director.
Huh?
So what do we do about that?
Right down in God created woman and let them fight over what you're talking about.
Yeah, because we can't...
I mean, you know, the list is only limited to 7,000 names.
Because even Eric, we wouldn't want to do that too.
What do we?
Well, don't answer questions.
Here are two from somebody else.
Since sirens, there are two movies with this name.
Another one with two movies with the same name.
Good.
Good choice.
Is it?
Yeah.
Well, let me write it down.
Now, how do we differentiate it?
I want to change by vote.
It says this one has Ellie McPherson,
uh?
Ellie McPherson.
Ellie McPherson,
who's the erotic life in early 1900s,
hundreds of Australia.
In other words, down under.
Portia D'Rossi, who is a lesbian and real life from Ellie McPherson,
she's in there.
All naked.
But, yes, that too.
Then, then, just as we were beginning a little steam,
there are a little momentumances.
It has Hugh Grant and Sam Neilinet,
but fortunately, they're not directly involved in any of the erotic scenes.
Well, thank the Lord.
Thank you.
For the notorious by their absence during any of the nakedness.
Hugh Grant.
What is this story?
He must have naked pictures of Queen Elizabeth.
I could use wall cast in that because he was supposed to be like a really
dorky, middice and...
Err, he's a very interesting person.
And that's him.
Perpet like Louisa and passions, a real dork.
Veldus Jure from 1967 with Catherine De Nueve had her most awesome.
Remember Catherine De Nure?
See.
Over those spots used to do on TV.
They used to run like every 10 minutes.
I'm Catherine De Nure.
Remember that?
No estate louder.
One of those.
Something like that.
Some one of those.
She was also in the hunger with Susan Serendin,
which was taught at least at once.
She plays a surgeon's wife who works in a bordella for kicks.
She likes her sex rough and degrading.
Very hot for a very arty movie.
Veldus Jure.
You got it down?
Yep.
Well, we got a big list here.
And a lot of homework for you people to be doing over the weekend.
They're going to be out there running tapes like crazy or maybe just stealing.
Getting a few bootlegs from Jury.
What was that movie we were going to get a bootleg copy of and you never did?
I did, but I never watched it.
Eight Mile.
Oh!
Oh my god.
Oh, excuse me.
I wouldn't even watch it for free.
I know my eight Mile.
Okay, I know my eight Mile and telegraph.
I know my eight Mile and telegraph.
Even though I haven't been here in a long time, I know I like to palm of your hand, okay?
And if there's one place I don't want to return to ever, it's Detroit.
Pre-1967, one of the world's great, exciting, vibrant, happening places.
Post-1967, you wouldn't drop a turd in that town.
That's how degrading and disgusting that city is, okay?
How did the poll come in?
I'm glad you asked.
What was the most erotic movie?
Not X-ray, do you've ever seen body heat?
What the hell was body heat?
Because I didn't see it.
I don't know.
Murder mystery, Kathleen Turner and William Hurt have an affair and wind up killing her husband.
I think you said Kathleen Turner wasn't in it.
No, that was not in it.
The other one.
Kathleen Turner is body heat.
Can we get this straightened out?
The postman always wanted to see why his turner.
The one that they said was Kathleen Turner, but it's not a stessical line, but Kathleen Turner at her tiny, but perky titties.
My head is body.
My head is body.
My head is spinning.
Anyway, body heat's got 35, 9.5 weeks, it's got 31.
Blue lagoon, this is only two, really getting a big number.
Way way down to blue lagoon 13.
Of course, that's a long time ago.
Blue lagoon.
Right.
What year would you say that was?
I don't know.
I saw it in the theater though.
70 something?
No.
Well, maybe right around 80.
More or less.
I'll look it up.
I feel like it.
Basic instinct 10, unfaithful 10, and everybody else is like single digits after that.
1980.
What did I just say?
What did I say?
1980.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
How can deal?
That was a lucky guess.
Yes, sir.
Hope you feel and better.
I am.
Thank you.
Okay.
You mentioned Pulp Fetch, the Torrentino made another one, a reservoir dog.
Did you ever see that movie?
That was an erotic movie?
Yeah.
In sorts.
Mr. Green, Mr. Blue, Mr. Red.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a great movie.
It was erotic?
Sure.
In a sense.
It was great.
Okay.
Okay.
I never heard anything.
You're always telling me I should see that movie, but nobody ever knew that it was on the
phone.
You should see that movie.
Yes, you have.
No, no, no.
You said as soon as I finished with Shinverse List and the other one.
Born on the 4th of July.
No, born on the 4th of July and what's the one that Jason was always trying to get me
watched?
Shocked.
Shocked.
I didn't know it.
As soon as I finished with those three, I should watch or whatever he just said, reservoir
dog.
I never heard you never heard me recommend a Quentin Tarantino movie to you.
Oh.
Excuse me, but it certainly wasn't erotic.
No, no.
It was about a fancy rocker.
He's a crazy person.
Oh, that guy was the crazy guy.
You're right.
You didn't even realize that.
That was the crazy guy.
I knew it was a crazy guy.
560.
0560.
Pound 560 on the AT&T Inforizon Wireless Line.
My, my, and look all.
6.
4.
3.
0560.
Way, way, yeah.
You get a lot of it.
Five.
The Rogers on SportsHole Radio WQA.
I want to tell you the truth about the interview with me.
A lot of it was life.
Not for my own mouth, here it is.
On my magic tree branch.
At Neverland branch.
Oh, I sit and write my songs all day.
And I don't wear my pants.
It can poisely over.
I took them in my bed.
I give them milk and cookies.
So that's not what lawyers said.
My Lord will must fell off from plastic surgery.
And my natural black skin can't be white enough for me.
I prefer water balloons over making love.
I have never touched a breast without wearing my glove.
Making love is messy.
For me, it's unknown, known.
That's why I sent all of my sperm fedics to Debbie Roll.
Ah, Kate Monier attacked me.
She ripped off all my clothes.
I've only had two plastic surgeries on my nose.
Not because it looked bad, but because I couldn't smell.
And if you don't believe me, you can freaking go to hell.
And party with the devil.
Tommy Montola.
Suspects he put my hair on fire.
I drink Coca-Cola.
Come on.
Love 020560 WQ.
I'm happy Tuesday too.
A risky business has very erotic scenes.
Is one of our chronic enough factors.
What do you think?
Well, it does have an erotic theatre.
Three.
Okay, risky business.
Get it on there.
Now, this one I find most amusing.
I guess I know what it'll have for crack.
Porkeys is what it says.
I love the scene where the female gym teacher starts howling like a wolf and a smell of
jockstrap.
She jumps on the other teacher right in the middle of the class, how many orphans?
I was played by Kim Katrol, the famous Kim Katrol.
Yes.
What is it?
Is she having a shower scene?
It's as very sexy, I'm serious.
And you're agreeing with her?
Well, it's a comedy, but that doesn't mean that it can't have sex.
Porkeys, how about American pie?
I'm sure there may be people who find scenes in erotic.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, these are comedy movies.
Didn't have the, you know, because there's like a breast here or a hint of a penis there
or a rectum there.
You know, it doesn't, you know, it's a twitching song.
I guess some of these were getting from the real desparados.
You know, we put it that one up there?
What?
The porkeys?
Of course not.
Why do you think that was erotic?
Hell no.
I don't know.
Chaser was erotic, not erotic.
What was the most erotic movie you've ever seen, not X-rated?
What a list we got.
Blu-la-goon, last hangover in Paris, paradise.
Mulholland, now how's that doing, by the way, paradise?
That was a real cheesy ripoff of Blu-la-goon.
Not doing too good.
I don't look at that.
Where the hell is it?
Got no votes.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

of vampire wild things, the sailor who fell from grace with a sea.
Was that the grace from passions?
Could have been.
It was a disgrace.
In fact, I wish grace would take her tomato soup cake and fall in the sea with that.
Good passions today, by the way.
As we find Ivy at the bottom of the stairs net wheelchair,
a sliver exotic, a pretty baby, Lolita cruel intentions, and God created woman,
sirens belled his jaw.
What did I leave off?
I don't know, I gave my list to Carlos.
No, but I just left off one and I just told you, oh, uh, frisky business, very good.
That's it.
That's where we are at the moment.
And we got a real battle going.
I'm going to strip you a two way battle.
I don't like that.
I hate that because then they then they did it all around with it.
In fact, yes, either did it all around with it.
It's 40-40 now.
And I don't have recent body heat.
Each have 40 and blue, the moon way back to 15.
So they did learn with it.
And the poll too.
Here's for Lauderdale.
Hello.
How about Andy?
How you doing?
Okay.
How about Mr. Goodbar or American graffiti?
American graffiti was around with Richard Sear.
American jiggle.
I'm sorry.
Oh, American jiggle.
American graffiti was a like a Ronnie Howard movie.
Yeah, like Happy Days Part 2.
American jiggle.
Hello.
American jiggle was up with Richard Gear.
Oh, with Richard Gear.
Good.
God.
Richard Sear.
Okay, let's put it down.
Richard, just think through.
Yeah, we got it.
What about, you know, the credit card thing I want to kind of talk to you about.
The deal is that if you have the credit card in your hand and you swipe it through the machine,
if you have a merchant, you're not responsible for that money.
It's only if you take a credit card over the phone or over the internet is when the merchant
is responsible for it.
So, so much skills are credit card and good somewhere and, you know, hands it to someone.
They can charge wherever they want and the merchant is not responsible for it.
The credit card company still pays them the money because it's not their response to the money.
That's not what those two factors said.
Yeah, it did.
If you actually read it, it just basically says that, you know, if it's done over the internet without a signature,
that the merchant is responsible.
It's like when you call in for a hotel reservation and they say, give me your credit card number.
And if you're on the charge, if you cancel, they really can't charge your card because they never actually had the card holder,
you know, they're swiping the card in the machine.
That's why when you get to the hotel, they always ask you for the imprint of the card.
Right.
Do you understand what I mean?
Yeah.
It's just pretty simple.
If you have the credit card in your hand, you swipe it through the machine.
You're not responsible for it, but if it's taken over the phone, that's another thing.
I mean, you know, you have to pay for that.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
All right, bye.
I think, I think, don't you think I should say thanks a lot because now I have no idea what we're talking about.
Right.
What? I thought we headed down Pat with those other two factors that agreed and he said, I think the opposite.
Isn't what he said in the opposite of what the facts have said, I believe.
I'm confused.
So we got American Jiglo with Richard Gears.
Yeah, I don't, I don't understand that.
How can any movie that Richard Geer be in unless, of course, now who else was in that?
Sharon Stone.
I don't, I never saw American Jiglo.
Come on.
Now, look it up, Carl.
I should look at him.
The only problem I have beside the fact is bookway, 6,000 pounds is the fact that the print is so tiny.
This is, this, this is what tells me whether I'm still liable or not.
The fact that I can still read the print in this book without your magnavisions.
Law and Hutton.
American graffiti.
Richard, drive, oh, I'm looking at a movie.
Give it up, you.
American Jiglo, when you calm down, look at so hysterical.
Richard Geer, Law and Hutton, Hector Eliano, Elisando, Nina Van Palant, Bill Duke and Brian Davies.
Well, who the hell is Law and Hutton?
We know who that is.
Who is she?
She is an actress, a model and an actress.
Yeah, and, and old.
Old?
Well, the movie is like I could open up the book again, see what you're, was it's an old freaking movie?
Put it down, okay, American Jiglo.
I would give that guy a shot.
Give him a little shot.
I'm not arguing with any of these people.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 8, we're going to have a gigantic pool here today, folks.
And everybody's invited to hop right on our pool.
Just a piss off that, uh,
Conferring guy, that schmuck, that Jackass.
Here's for a Lutterdale, hello.
Hey, Nail.
Yes, sir.
I got a couple for you.
Okay, one is sort of like Mr. Geer movie, the guy in the movie, that great,
It's really hell said but in there people were like
with a lot of hot scenes in that movie with all those girls that you know
but that hospital publication in there.
Okay.
And the second is for all the brothers out there,
Jungle Fever.
I mean there's some pretty hot scenes in there you know.
Jungle Fever?
Yeah, you know, Westwich nights and NFL and I fell asleep
like an influencer laughing.
Sure.
All right.
Yeah.
Should I wait?
Yeah.
It should a lot of scenes where it's been a hundred and a gather of beds and all that.
It's like a the first white beef that ever came out on TV.
A lot of hot, excuse and scenes in that thing.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, pal.
We got you now people versus Larry Flint and Jungle Fever and whatever.
Here's an article by Ariana Huffington about once every five years to
something that makes sense and the rest of the time is the raping right-wing lunatic.
What is this?
Well, this fact is dodo dodo this goes out to Moe.
How about the crying game?
How about it?
I never saw it.
I understand it's got baggery and cross-dressing.
That's all I know.
Well, in that case, the crying game.
All right.
Get it on that list immediately if not sooner.
How about bully?
Yes.
Boe?
You'd not be like it with bully.
What?
Great for a lot of reasons.
I don't know.
Is that bully bully?
Yeah, it was a little bit.
Well, he's not a fact.
Here's Ethanus.
And not sure if anybody mentioned this one.
It's called bound.
We got well bully now, right?
Bound starring Jennifer Tilly as a mob boss's wife and Gina Gershawna as their lesbian
next door neighbor.
Yeah.
They phone love playing a killer mob husband.
Great lesbian scenes.
This is the first film directed by the Wachowski brothers directors of the Matrix.
Bound.
Got it?
Bound?
Bolly and Bound.
I think we're following.
We're getting to a theme here.
And the lesbian scenes could have been hotter, but nevertheless.
I see.
I see.
This is a book.
Have you read this book, Ariane?
Having them pigs at the trough?
How corporate greed and political corruption around the mining market might be good because every now and
end like I said, she does something lucid and makes a little bit of sense.
And then the rest of the time she goes and reverts to her origins again.
Like that crazy thing about the, the SUVs and the gas and all of that.
Oh, my goodness.
It just makes you want to sit down and cry.
I mean, where's the logic in that?
We're helping terrorists by buying SUVs.
What difference does it make whether you're getting 10 miles through a gallon or 20 miles
through a gallon?
You're still buying gas.
As a matter of fact, if you're buying any product that was transported here with gas.
Right.
I mean, come on, Ariane.
Get a life, sweetheart.
I understand that you've had some real tough times here.
Husband was a fact, but that's beside the point.
Really?
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
Don't you remember he ran for governor or something in California and then he finally out
and outed in the whole dealer?
Yeah.
No.
Well, he was.
See, you learn something.
It's just barely 11 o'clock.
Right.
It's down.
12 minutes after 11 at 5.60 WQAM.
Showed on Iraq.
There's Nick Robertson over there showing us.
See, we haven't hardly mentioned that all today.
And don't we feel better for it?
I mean, what is there to say anymore?
You know, what is there to say?
Nothing.
Get lots of work going in.
Whatever resolution it takes.
However much arm twisting and pulling it takes.
And we know that Bush has got naked pictures of Tony Blair and Amousse and Prince Charles.
They're all in there together doing it.
They're humping it.
And that's the way it is.
As Walter Crockite would say.
He's still alive, you know?
Yeah.
Barely.
He don't look too good.
13 past 11.
If I always better shape them, David Brinkeley.

You ain't too way.
Hi, this is Jim.
Love your show, Neil.
Love you.
Love you.
His name is Joey's gotta show on Foss pretending he's rich.
But I grew up with Joe so I should know.
I caught him sometimes he pitched.
He gets okay I guess.
Because I wore a dress and thought he was mine.
All that candlelight in life is a handsome guy and that's no lie, but he's the truth I swear it.
I walked in on him and spun down in Jim with a pill jacket and a carrot and he's got smelly feet.
And his hair is full of grease.
And his another treat.
He's got a fetish for G.C. men long to the G.
Why, why did he never did care?
And he was Mrs. Pac-Man underwear.
And he's the only dresses up like Cher.
1118 at 560 W.D. Jim here's a credit card professional.
Some of them might know the real answer to our question.
Hello.
Neil, how are you this morning?
Pretty good sir.
Good.
I was in an appointment didn't hear the original question.
But I heard that gentleman's answer and he was incorrect.
If I could ask you what was the original question you had about the credit card?
The original question was if somebody steals your credit cards and you're not responsible or maybe only responsible for the first 50 bucks, where does that leave the merchant?
In other words, somebody has to pay for the merchandise to be responsible.
Where does the merchant come in?
If someone hands the merchant a stolen credit card and they swipe the card through their machine and the person signs a receipt,
the merchant is stuck on the hook not only for the goods but they will charge back his account for the credit card money if it is advanced to him.
The merchant is the one who is stuck.
Okay.
On your whole circumstances like that.
Okay.
Yeah, I had two facts to sing exactly what you're singing and this guy knows better than the rest of us.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Yeah, you're welcome.
You too.
There you go.
Three out of four can't be wrong, right?
Sure.
This facts though leaves me limp.
Which one?
The one you just fact me, how about poison ivy?
Jew bear more is so hot.
Oh, man.
What's the point of telling?
She's almost as hot as Tom Green.
Jew bear more is hot.
She used to be pure, she got all scared out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Stop, stop, stop.
She's not even lukewarm.
Even luke Easter was hotter than her.
Okay, you don't even know who that is.
No.
Anybody remember luke Easter?
No.
Is that Dick Feinberg at Poppett O'Park?
Jew bear more is so hot.
Okay, poison ivy, what do you say?
I already wrote it down.
Just for them, I mean, just a human.
It has a scene.
Does it really you seen it?
Yep.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, be pound 5, 6, be on the 18 and 10 for eyes on wireless line.
Don't let me forget this great article behind the great divide by Paul Krugman,
which I'm going to read right now.
He doesn't forget that article by Paul Krugman?
Yeah, that's the one.
From today's New York Times, it says here's like, are you interrupting again?
No, I think Moe had a real good point about you.
There's been much speculation while Europe and the US are suddenly at such odds.
Is it about culture, about history?
But I haven't seen much discussion of an obvious point.
We have different views partly because we see different news.
Let's back it up.
Many Americans now blame France for the chill and US European relations.
There is even talk of boycotting French products.
But France's attitude is exceptional.
Last Saturday's huge demonstrations confirm polls that show deep distrust of the Bush administration
and skepticism about an Iraq war and all major European nations,
whatever position their governments may take.
In fact, the biggest demonstrations where countries whose governments are supporting the Bush administration,
A.K.A., Italy and Spain.
There were big demonstrations in America too, but distrust of the US overseas has reached such a level,
even among our British allies, that a recent British pull ranked the US as the world's most dangerous
nation way ahead of North Korea and Iraq.
So, to why don't other countries see the world the way we do?
News coverage is a large part of the answer.
Eric Althamon's new book, What Liberal Media,
doesn't stress international comparisons,
but the difference between the news reports of Americans in European Sea
is a stark demonstration of his point.
At least compared with their foreign counterparts,
the liberal US media are strikingly conservative and in this case hawkish.
I'm not mainly talking about the print media.
There are differences, but the major national newspapers in the US and the UK
at least seem to be describing the same reality.
Most people, though, get their news from TV and their differences immense.
The coverage of Saturday's anti-war rally was a reminder of an extent to which the US cable news in particular
seems to be reporting about a different planet than the one covered by foreign media.
What would someone watch in cable news of seen?
On Saturday, news anchors on Fox described that administrators in New York
as the usual protesters or serial protesters.
CNN wasn't quite so dismissive, but on Sunday morning,
the headline on the network's website read,
anti-war rallies delight Iraq,
and the accompanying picture showed marchers in Baghdad, not London or New York.
This wasn't all the way the rest of the world's media reported Saturday's events,
but it was now the character.
For months, both US major cable news networks have acted as if the decision
to invade Iraq has already been made and have been effected
as their job to prepare the American public for the coming war.
So it's not surprising that the target audience is a bit blurry
about the distinction between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda.
Surveys show that a majority of Americans think that some or all of the 9-11
hijackers were Iraqi, while many believe that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9-11,
acclaim even the Bush administration has never made.
And since many Americans think that the need for war against Saddam is obvious,
they think that Europeans won't go along our cowards.
Europeans who don't see the same things on TV are former inclined to wonder
why Iraq, rather than North Korea, or for that matter, Al-Qaeda,
has become the focus of US policy.
That's why so many of them question American motor,
suspecting that it's all about oil, or that the administration is simply picking
out a convenient enemy and knows it can defeat.
They don't see opposition to an Iraq war as cowardice.
They see it as courage, a matter of standing up to the bullying,
Bush administration.
There are two possible explanations for the great transatlantic media divide.
One is that European media have a pervasive anti-American bias that leads
them to distort news, even in countries like the UK, where leaders of both major
parties are pro-bushed and support an attack on Iraq.
The other is that some US media outlets operating an environment in which
anyone who questions the administration's foreign policy is accused of being
unpatriotic have taken it as their assignment to sell the war, not to present
a mix of information that might call the justification for or into question.
So which is it?
I've reported you decide since Paul Krugman in today's New York Times.
The usual protesters.
Oh, that Fox Man, he can't complain about their news because they don't present it.
Here's a call from Pembroke Park.
Hello.
Hey, you know, one Mr. Looking for Mr. Goodbar.
Okay.
And the other, the credit card guy that just called you is absolutely correct.
Even if the guy gives you the card and you take an ID from the card from the guy
and they dispute that charge, the merchant is still responsible.
It's still stuck.
And still stuck for it.
And also, have you ever watched the subway ads when the Jared guy is on there
for the diet thing?
If you look at the bottom of the screen where they have a little tagline,
it says subway is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association.
Really?
Yeah.
What does that mean?
I have no idea.
I don't know.
But I've watched it and I saw that.
I'll tell you what, if I see Jared one more time, I'm going to puke my guts out.
I can't stand him.
Yeah, I mean, I started to think maybe the American Medical Association owned subway
so I'm one.
But on the bottom of the tagline, it says subway is a registered trademark of American Medical Association.
I'll tell you, I'm going to find out about that because I've got a friend that owns two subway franchises
and I will find out.
All righty.
Thanks a lot, Pat.
See, there's four out of five out of credit cards.
Now let me ask you this.
Would you eat subway?
Ah, yeah.
What has this passed?
You don't have to answer the question.
Oh, it was a rhetorical question.
Okay.
Oh, it sounded pretty direct.
You want to look like Jared or whatever's name is?
I think I could have tried.
Man, he bugs me.
Oh, you're right.
And then those spots up here, because subway is a humongous franchise in Canada, I mean, it's
just gigantic up here.
And like, here we have 10 seconds.
Here we have 10 seconds.
There's Jared on your screen again.
Just bugging a crap out of you.
Jared, you're my hero.
You know what?
Another year is coming gone and it's middle of February already, but a lot of people are
still getting their life back together for the new year.
And as a result, they want to get everything looking in tip-top shape.
How do you do that?
One of the ways is to call my good pizons at drug concepts.
What a job they do.
When your carpets don't look brand new, these people will come in without the expensive
buying brand new carpeting and make them look like you just had new carpeting laid right
on the floor.
There's nothing like it in laid right on the floor.
That's right.
They really look and smell just like brand new lemony fresh because they dry clean your
carpets.
So the only company in the world that does this and believe me, you will see and feel
the difference and smell and all these other things.
And the same for your carpeting.
I mean, for your drapery rather, expensive area rugs and your poultry as well, all your
good stuff that make it look just like brand new.
And if you have a problem with pen orders, milled orders caused by water damage, like a
magic one, they'll wave it right in your room and make it go away and just like brand
new.
So if you want to get a great deal, always at a guaranteed written price that they
give you before they start the job, do what I've been doing in my house for over 20 years
and everybody else with the brain is doing.
Catch on to the secret of dry concepts because they are simply the best in the world.
Call them tool free.
They won't let you down.
Call 1-800-248-5071.
1-800-248-5071 or log on to their website at dryconcepts.com.
Don't forget with your art concepts you can clean today and entertain tonight.

I'm a pretty 2.560 WQM where he leaves me limp man, where to gear he makes me nauseous,
him and Bruce Willis.
There's just a few of those guys and of course with the majority of the heterosexual population
out there, if there's a sex scene in a movie like this, we're talking about today, or even
in a porn movie, they don't care what the guy looks like anyway.
Maybe it makes them feel better about themselves if the guys really grotesque.
You mean like Ron Jeremy?
Oh sorry Ron.
You're like that.
Sorry Ronny, you disgusting fat Harry pig.
Anyway in the realm of the senses, did you see this one?
Yeah, I never heard of it but I wrote it down.
Language Japanese subtitles, English, in the realm of the senses there's this story of
an ex prostitute who becomes involved in an obsessive love affair with the master of
household where she's employed as a servant in the realm of the senses, okay?
All right.
And Lynn Samuels is okay, she's alive.
By the way, I got your facts excellent, I'm impressed.
That's all I'm gonna say because you said don't say nothing.
Okay.
Well don't ask any questions, got it?
My wife looks fine, have a nice day.
Dress to kill somebody says, what does it say here from Sean?
Not the chronic Sean's model but some of the Sean.
It says, two movies dressed together with Angie Dickinson at the shower scene in the
beginning.
What about the scene in the taxi cab?
Didn't they do it in the cab?
Yeah I guess.
You didn't see Dress to kill?
Yeah, 100 years ago.
Oh come on, that was an excellent movie with Michael King.
Yeah it was great.
And Angie Dickinson, before she knew Larry King and her body double.
Right.
And no way out with Kevin Costner, it says the sex scene in the limo.
No way out we put that down too but Kevin Costner was in it.
Oh.
Oh.
Hey he's no Mickey Rourke.
Yeah there's another one.
Right.
See I get to feel like I don't know and Lynn Samuel says the most erotic sex scene she
ever saw in a movie was in Don't Look Now.
Okay.
Got it down?
Don't look now.
Don't look now.
My, my, my.
What was the most erotic movie you've ever seen?
Not X rated.
Nine and a half weeks 46, body heat 43.
By the way.
By the way.
Yes.
Speaking to nine and a half weeks and Mickey Rourke.
Yes.
Kim Basinger said of her episode filming that movie with me.
He smelled bad.
He smelled really bad.
He didn't bathe.
He had bad personal hygiene.
Wow.
What a surprise.
Ken O'Hell.
So big deal.
Uh, Blue Lagoon.
At least, at least he looked up to his billing anyway.
Nine and a half weeks 46, body heat 43.
Blue Lagoon way in third place, way on ESN 21.
Basic instinct 16.
Last time you went Paris 14.
I never saw that.
Must have been highly overrated.
And very old ancient.
Lyle Orchard 14 fatal of fraction 13.
Unfaithful 12.
Mulholland Drive 10.
Now we're talking.
Monsters balls.
Nine.
Summer lovers eight.
Two moon Kakamoon junction eight.
Postman always comes twice eight.
Wild things eight.
And summer 42 seven.
Down from their coast.
Got it.
Got it.
As we're building.
Now, see, this is the way to do it, Carlos.
Unlike the way we did yesterday, which is okay.
We had almost 850 votes.
I'm like that.
You know.
But this is better.
Don't you agree?
Yeah.
As if you had a choice.
My phone is ringing.
It must be a package on says.
Can you hear my phone ringing in the back?
No.
Good.
God, that was scary.
I didn't hear it jumped out of the seat right here in the middle of the show.
The phone is ringing in the other room.
Yeah.
Or maybe it could be a, or could be Ed McMahon.
Or it could be Jeff Cohen from the pizza lot.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, Jeff.
I'm sorry to hear that you aren't feeling good.
I was late to hear.
Yeah.
Well, you're usually a little bit behind the eight balls.
That's true.
Are you feeling all right now?
I'm feeling pretty good.
I'm coming along.
Not bad.
I need you at least to make it till the plantation store is doing good.
You know what I'm saying?
You need to keep me alive for another few months until I get that thing up to speed and plantation.
Right.
Now I'm healing sunrise and plantation.
Go in here and buy a bunch of food because he's feeding the rimers for free.
I'll leave me hanging, dude.
Get better.
Listen, I needed to use you a little bit for change.
Well, what a, for change.
How unusual, yeah.
Right.
I just got a delivery from city furniture.
My two little kids got dead.
They put it together in the wrong rooms.
And I can't get through to them on their phone number.
I was on hold for 15 minutes.
And nobody's answering.
If my kids come home from school and they're better in the wrong room, they're going to be traumatized and never want to go back to city.
A big, really guy like you.
Why don't you just move around yourself?
I can't.
Sorry, they got to be put together and stuff.
Yeah.
So anyway, I was hoping somebody from city furniture might hear this and call.
Okay.
I'll give people at city furniture.
Jeff Cohen from the pizza loft is pissed off and he's giving you some bad publicity on the air.
And you would like to read.
I've talked to the, I've talked as a matter of fact that they can respond so quick to put the beds where they're supposed to be before I get kids get out of school.
That would be wonderful.
Right.
And then you might even feed them for free for a while.
You might, but I already told you there are other drivers because I wasn't there.
Just like the rimmers.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Anyway, I appreciate you letting me use you once again.
Stay healthy.
Anytime.
And do some exercise, man.
We talked about it in the past.
Say goodbye, Jeff.
Bye, Neil.
Okay, Jeff Cohen from the pizza loft real free loader.
But anyway, people with city furniture take care of him because he can be really dangerous, you know?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.
So we had two tremendous, like almost personal calls.
Fat Rich yesterday to tell us that Brian Sears won eight races at Pompe and O'Park on last Saturday night.
And that this Saturday is the big ol' like a pre-final.
And I haven't a big night.
And he had the two of it in 147 and the six broke.
And then we had the Jeff Cohen just now asking for a personal favor about his kids furniture.
Then I think you feel like really loved and wanted and useful.
Yeah.
Well, you know, like he said, at least he was honest about it.
As long as you're still alive, Neil, let me use you and get the plantations through up to speed.
Right.
Let me see if you can't straighten out my furniture problem from city furniture.
Which why not?
That's what I'm here for.
I'm here to serve.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hi. How are you, Neil?
Okay.
First of all, before I tell you the films, you were talking about Alfred Hitchcock before.
And I think to someone said, rear window was not remade as a movie.
I've never seen it, but it was remade.
And actually they had a perfect casting.
They had Christopher Reeben, the wheelchair.
Oh, that's right.
That thing.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
And that was another one.
That was another one.
It never should have been remade.
Right.
Yeah.
Oh, there's a lot of them.
Also, before I tell you my films, you might have to take off last hang on Paris if you're saying that.
Not X-rated film.
Yeah, I think you're right.
I think it wasn't X-rated film.
That was an X-rated film.
Oh.
I hate to burst all those people's bubbles and mall and brando, but that was an X-rated film.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay. Take that off of there, please, Eric.
I thought about that at first, and then I thought, well, nobody else said anything.
So I'll just dummy up, you know.
But you're right.
Okay.
The three that I would like to mention, a couple of them while I've been on the phone, you've already mentioned bound.
Right.
I just mentioned Dress to Kill, which also had Nancy Allen.
And another film, The Hunger.
From The Hunger?
The Hunger with Susan Sarandon and Kevin De Nouve.
On Kevin De Nouve?
And David Bowie.
And David Bowie, that's right.
Oh, my God.
But he was not really in that erotic scene.
I wonder who is the richest one in Amelbeach, or wasn't him?
Actually, it was an excellent non-bam part.
Yeah, yes, you didn't say that.
Yeah, good movie.
Yeah, so it's very good.
Okay, thanks a lot, Pali.
Have a great day.
And back to you.

American Idol is bad on TV.
American Idol, who's it going to be?
We're going to find out who can sing and who will hear some nasty things.
Here's your chance of life on fame like I can't even shit.
American Idol watches fame, aim voters.
It's up to you.
American Idol, it's season two.
American Idol, two days a week.
American Idol, you're the sure can't shrink.
Simon Cowell is an evil chap.
You'll just want to give a hell of a slap.
Ryan St. Gris is all alone.
Now that things have become a little home.
Randy Jetson's still on board.
He's having me out on my door.
American Idol, right now it's cool.
How soon will it be like all I have to?
And if you're holding off, it'll get off now.
Go, go.
I'm going to watch you, Simon.
But I don't like you, Simon.
Bye.
Bye.
Live in 45 at 5.60 W.
Here's a fact from somebody who sent this.
Chris and Boca, thank you, Chris.
Your website is a treasure trove and you're right.
You are the man for this liberal progressive radio syndicate.
No.
A chronic non-collar, Chris and Boca who loves you,
educated degenerate masses, please,
if you wanted to tweak the self-righteous,
raise the stakes, Al Frankenmines,
and it's the same story again about how the liberals want to put together a radio network.
No.
No, thanks.
Not going back ever to that so-called
topical change-the-world talk radio,
because there are no market for it.
Liberals are like ostriches.
They have their heads in the sand, even like moderates.
They're busy playing kaka in the idea that especially if you're having a stroke,
I'm going to like stick my head out there.
Let somebody else do it, okay?
Stick it out there.
Yeah, stick it out.
When it doubts, stick it out.
Thanks anyway, Chris, but the answer is still.
Absolutely.
No.
And you're right about the website.
I only wish that more and more people would go on there and read our bedtime stories.
Good stuff on there.
Am I right?
Absolutely.
Every color.
Even Carlos agrees.
He's just astonished.
I mean, you know, you can find this stuff if you want to sit around and go to like 600 different websites to find it,
but that's why we put it on there soon, and I have to do that.
And also it gives Carlos and the aircoaches used to uscreen with each other.
Did you put the lover with Jane March on a list?
Yes.
You did?
Yes.
Well, that's what it says here on this fact.
We put the lover with Jane March.
I don't know who she is.
Yeah, yeah, she's really cute, really cute.
She came to Frederick March?
Unfortunately.
How about how March?
Or the eyes of?
March.
Unfortunately what?
I don't know if it's that one or another one that she's in with Bruce Willis.
Ah!
Ah!
It's all close to lunchtime, too.
The good news is that I looked for that candy wrapper that almond brittle and I couldn't find it.
So I must have thrown it out in the trash, damn it.
Well, I'll go buy the keyest store, the convenience store next time, and of course I won't buy one at all, but I'll look at the label and see who the manufacturers who makes it because believe me if you like candy.
Oh!
Almond brittle, you have never in your life tasted there two big squares of it in each year, a little pack.
And by the time you get them with that you'll say, I'm going to go back and buy ten or twelve more of those.
Damn it, those are just.
See, that's the problem.
That's why we're all dying over here because everything, now this story about healthy ice cream is on a website which I'm not going to read it because it's too much bedtime stories, too much reading, but could eating ice cream make you healthier if so it might also make someone rich.
There is growing interest in adding new, new, new, pharmaceuticals, foods with medicinal properties to ice cream, new, pharmaceuticals, okay?
Ah!
See, I'm choking just from saying that.
Getting them in ice cream is relatively easy research, you say the trick is to do it in such a way that the finished product still tastes like ice cream and not like fish as this happened in some early experiments.
Oh, how about for fish food?
Okay, the natural.
That might do it.
There are a lot of people who don't want us to screw up their ice cream since Bob Roberts associate professor of food, sides of Penn State.
These are the same people who say are eating it because it tastes good.
I don't eat it because it's good for me.
Well, I mean, does anybody really eat anything because it's good for them unless they think it tastes good?
I mean, I like broccoli which you don't, but I don't eat it specifically because it's good for me.
I eat it because it's supposed to be good for me and I like the way it tastes.
There are probably some grunola minded people that do that kind of thing.
Oh, like you were given?
Yeah, he did.
He's done.
He didn't do a lot of good, didn't it?
Yeah.
He's still dead.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Yes, I want to add a movie to your phone.
Sure, go ahead.
Okay, the movie is Jade.
I can't remember the name of the lady that was in it for a non-robot caruso,
post-part in it as well.
How old is that movie?
I think the movie is about, I think it came out in about 98, I think.
Because I'm not sure if it's too new to be in my book, but I'm looking for there's jam.
There's Jacob Delired, a Jade.
1995, so it's eight years old.
Oh, how old?
And it's starred, um, Cass David Caruso, Linda Fiorentino, Richard Crenna,
Chaz Palmentieri, Michael, Beane, and Donna Murphy.
And we got it down.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Got it.
Jade.
Got it.
Okay.
A Friedkin back to the, uh, oh, boy, this print is so small, back to the hackery of the Guardian.
Indeed, from the prowling camera tour of the Baroque Oriental San Francisco,
Manchester Bominionaires Playboy, to the creepy, choral music and jarring soundtrack,
this ugly murder thriller pushes close to horror movie territory.
How do you like that?
I will get it.
The print is too damn small.
Man, it is teeny tiny.
You're going to have to hit him.
My Magdivision reading glass.
Pretty soon, Mr.
He's not going to be an old fart.
51 for nine and a half weeks.
It's pulling away again.
Look out.
Body heat 44.
Blue Lagoon 22.
Small potatoes.
Blue Lagoon.
That's what they said about Chris Ankins, and I'm over.
Wasn't it small potatoes?
Well, the water was cold.
Is that what it was?
What was he doing out there?
Anyway, here's higher Leah.
Hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How about showgirls?
Showgirls?
Yes.
How about that?
That stripping movie?
Yeah.
You know that one, George?
Yeah.
Big controversy.
Remember that?
No.
Elizabeth Berkeley, Gina Gershon, La Noudite.
No.
The guy that wrote Basic Instinct took a lot of heat for it.
Basic, a lot of body heat?
Yeah.
I thought we were going to have to have a lot of makeup in it.
How about your porn?
Bad movie, but a lot of nudity.
Well, that's the point.
We did it.
We're not asking which was a good movie.
See, what about Henry and June?
I was on this faceties.
Oh.
You put that.
No?
Well, it was supposed to be an erotic movie.
How's that?
But it wasn't.
It was a scene that was supposed to be erotic between...
No, I can't think of the other.
Henry Fonda and June Allison?
Yeah, there you go.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And it was pretty wet.
Is she still alive by the way, June Allison?
I think so.
Leahy.
Huh?
I didn't see she still depends.
Was that June Allison or was that somebody else?
Yeah, it was.
Well, at least our bit accuses her of selling depends.
Yeah, it was June Allison.
That's a long time ago too.
So I'm wondering if she's still around.
Depends.
That's the right one.
It's not?
No, the other one.
Oh, this is...
It's like the low it.
We launched it less than 10 days.
That's not even that easy.
We're going to be servers, storage, databases.
We need to be wireless ready in six months' time.
No, that's fine.
It's on board.
Maybe it's June Allison for depends.
That's true.
In fact, I don't even think it's in here.
I think it's...
Oh, no.
Huh?
Hi.
I'm June Allison.
Notice you haven't seen me in movies for a long time.
That's because I always wet my pants.
Remember my love scene with Jimmy Stewart and that money strat and fixer?
No, I was soaked.
Do you know Gene Kelly's face?
Okay, that's not for that.
We'll have to find out if she's still alive.
Look it up, Carlos.
There's something to do in between putting down these 50,000 movie titles for the most
erotic movie.
So Henry and June, you say no?
No, let's put it on there anyway.
Just to humor these people.
Listen, maybe they were extra horny when they saw it.
Maybe it did the job for them at that particular moment on that given day.
Okay.
Uma Thurman, by the way.
Uma Thurman.
Is she related to Emma Sumak?
I'll check.
What is it again?
Emma Thurman?
Uma.
Uma Thurman.
Uma.
Uga Buga.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on EAT and T and Verizon Wireless Lime.
We got Joe Rose for the Mad Dog at one and the Humper in the studio.

Okay.
He was great adventure.
It's the crazy guy again.
You're right.
Boy, he just out of control.
The crazy guy.
Yeah, okay.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hey.

Got it.
Okay.
Founder.
Body double.
Blinded a form of film.
Got it too.
Okay.
There was one against all odds back in the 80s with Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward.
There was a scene there in Mexico and the, uh, and the, uh, by the, uh, tunes or whatever.
They were like naked.
Okay.
And, uh, the lonely girl.
Where I forgot her name.
My, her name I think was Applephone or something?
The splonchick.

He's not a touch with reality as if he's or any bulletin
He's got a touch with reality his children are fantasy props and what he's doing is dangerous
says the star
verdict bad
Sad mad and bad or the three of columns here
Michael Jackson thinks he's showing his love for children by sleeping with him the same bed
But this is a terrible act that could scar a child for life
What he's doing with children is inherently dangerous and horribly wrong says J. Howell a
Nationally known crime victims attorney from Jacksonville and the author of state and federal statutes concerning child abuse
Jackson isn't breaking the law by climbing into bed with the child his owner somebody else's but it's just totally irresponsibly says
What kind of responsible adult would allow his kids to sleep with a 44 year old man
And what kind of normal responsible male adult would want to sleep and go with a child?
I'd be surprised that child protection groups are not looking into this and by the way
I'm sure they are there's you think they are
Charming they're taking a peek in the way he says we all ought to be doing that. He says everybody ought to be sick with children
So thank guy that we have Michael back to well, let's see here's one and this is cute forget your subway diet

When you think?
Unsure
Because he was girl he's mentor as I told you before the show to have forgotten all of that had vanished
I guess maybe when I had the stroke it came back
The fact that
Joe Rosal was always guilty's
Taking him under his wing
And so when they used to have the first team and they were like three guys and it was always like two against one
Which it easier is gonna be unanimous or two against one no matter how you how you slice it right
It was always Joe Rosalind guilty against poor D4. I think that's what pushed D4 over the edge, you know what?
I think that's why he did that deal with the Indians
No, that's seriously let's blame Joe Rose for what you say. Oh right sure. Why not?
You done it Joe you pushed poor D4 over the edge
That's why I had to walk around with an ankle bracelet on all the time because of you because always sticking up for that

How about in Manic City
There was one Susan
Another Susan Sarandon
On the
The last city was
Donnie Darko
Yeah
That's really bizarre movie
All right, yeah you have a good one
He'd back to Bizarre movies again okay
Heartland
Heartland
Isn't that what he said
What was the first one that he said
I don't know it was bad so I put it out of my head
Oh okay
Cross them all out
He's I think he's still doing bizarre
Which I think this is the bizarre student one hour
So must be bizarre right
Three in a row
Five six seven oh five sixty
Pond five sixty
The crazy guys are coming on glued
He's becoming told that
You know who else is going to be on glued
Who's that
Because it's already Tuesday
Little Jerry
You know with the squeal of the little writing
Because he knows that you're not going to send me the facts
Has he sent me any
Probably not
Got to be very frustrated
In fact maybe a little chronic Jerry
Maybe he's the crazy guy
When you come right down to it
Stop and think that would make a lot of sense
Ever seen the two of them together
No no
Here's four lottery all hello
Hello Neil
Yes
I've got two for you one on the bizarre side
Kentucky Fried movie
And on the erotic side the one that Madonna did
Was it just the final love or
So
Let that
Okay, thanks over two
Why are they still doing bizarre
Why are we doing that
I don't know
Because just to piss me off
See if they can give me another stroke before one o'clock
They're working on it
Why we're not doing bizarre
That was yesterday
We have to draw the line
We draw the line
Do you understand
Just like we draw the line at nine
What does that under by the way is that in here
Is that not
I don't I don't know
Now see tell me to run tell me to get with it okay
He's got a great a greatest hits
Diddy
Well, I got a package downstairs so that maybe
Because I went out there and checked my message during the break
Yeah, and there's a package downstairs which means
Either
It's another one of those CDs either from him or somebody else
Or maybe a more than one
Or it's $10 million small bills from Ed McMahon
Don't they bring a giant check and you'll discover the answer to which one of these two it was tomorrow morning at nine as to whether I'm here or not
Follow what I'm saying
Yeah
Let's see if we can break this streak
Want to give it a shot
Here's the Fort Lauderdale
Hello
Fort Lauderdale
As we go for four in a row
All right
And we succeeded
All right
Miami hello
Hey Neil
Yes sir
I got a couple but they both might have been rated X when they came out
Is that cowboy
Uh X
That was rated X in the beginning
Yeah but it would lay
That can be on air because it wasn't
It was not rated X later on it was rerelease
Right it was rerelease and it was
Or I don't know if the time is cheap and I don't know what the deal was with that one
Right I think it was rereleased without being X
Maybe the other one is and I'm serious about the title
I spit on your grave
I spit on your grave
Yeah that's a neurotic movie
Rape and then revenge
Exactly that's the one
Okay thanks
Maybe he's been listening to them all okay
Maybe I'm not going to go with that when the guy got his penis cut off in the bathtub
That that was really erotic
And how about the rape scene
Gang rape is funny
See so I've heard
Okay
Well so we're not putting those out
Midnight cowboy that I can put on there
Because it was X in the very beginning
And then later on they discovered
That Dustin Hoffman aka Ratso was so ugly
That there could nothing be nothing erotic about that
Even though John Boyd was a hustler in etc and so on
There was too much faggery in there
I don't think that's the reason it was rated
That's the erotic if it had faggery in it
Oh that's a good point
20 to 1 at 560 WQ
Nobody said cruising with Al Pacino thank goodness
The low point of his career
I tell you one thing
The low point of the beast weight
Has been like last one was he in Friday
Yes
He's lost 51 pounds and balanced for life
And I guarantee you I promise you
That if we have to chain him to the wall
If we have to do like our own liposuction
With a with a with that
The thing we got over there against the wall
That what is it
What do we got
That big OJ thing that the cleaver
The machete
The machete
Yeah we have to do that
Take it to him
He'll be under 200 pounds
Balance for life is what he's doing
And we can do the same for you
See I tried telling Troy balance for life
Don't put Jeff high on this thing
Don't put fat boy on there
Which he tried for a couple of weeks
Then it worked
Was it embarrassing as hell
Of course
Because he's hopeless
We just written him off
But for those of us who still have a chance
Who still would like to stay alive
Would like to be able to walk without assistance
This is the answer for it
Because it's simple
It's easy
And you know how difficult it is
When you go in the supermarket
What am I going to buy
What can I get
Now with balance for life
There's no counting a calories
No counting of anything
No cooking
No shopping
No cleaning
No worries
You just pick up your little black sack
Right outside
You do a six o'clock every morning
And there's all your food for the entire day
The only choice you have to make
Is that little menu
They give you a choose between
Two alternatives for each of the meals on
Every day you're on a program
And that's it
And the food is delicious
Three fresh gourmet meals
Two delicious snacks
Right in your black sack
And that's all you need all day
And the weight will just pour off your body
You'll be full
Because there's plenty of food to keep you going all day in there
And it's all based on the zone diet
Which is very effective
And watches them
Makes the weight
Just melt off your body
I'm getting tongue-tied just thinking about it
So let balance for life
Help you get to be a human size
And in better health
That's the most important part
Call balance for life today at 9-5-4
5-6-8-3-2-29
I'm really getting tongue-tied
Because I'm thinking about the beast
And it's head weighs 110 pounds

Hugh Beaumont as Ward Cleaver

As the Oz

Is that one of your friends from school, dear?
Yeah
Good morning Ozzy
What the fuck is that?
Get out of my face
Now Ozzy, that's no way to talk to your father
Say son, what have you got planned for today?
We may have got planned for today
What?
I don't know, it's just one of the Prince of Darkness
Have to hand out a f***ing antenna

Sorry about that Ozzy
You might just kill it
Or maybe the
Brady Bunchel show up again
Or Donnie and Marie
Now, was that you and Allison or Florence Henderson?
What's Florence?
So what do we got?
I want to give you the list of the ones that don't have any votes
I mean, I don't have leases on top
It's strictly a tourist race
It's not the most bizarre anymore
That was yesterday
It's not which floor to business
You miss most that went out of business
It's not which president had hemorrhoids
What was the most erotic, not ex-rated movie you've ever seen?
9.567, body heat 58
Everybody else, malpathed is including George
But the ones that have zero
This is interesting because
Why do they do this?
Out of sight
Video-drome, sliver
Against all odds
Don't look now, dressed to kill Henry and June
In the realm of the senses, no way out
Showgirls, paradise
The lone legal, the lover, color of night
Crash, dark tide, I'm curious yellow
Clute
One million years BC
Where did that come from?
Did I put that down?
That's the caveman movie that the guy was talking about
What do you tell about that?
Summer of Sam, tattoo, white castle and wildard heart
All of these
Like, uh, 20 of them at least
Have the big
Oh!
Nothing
I mean, I realize there's a long way to go
To them our morning, but is not kind of shocking to you?
No
That they continue calling these in
And this is the problem
That's what happens when you want to call it
15 or 20 or 30
And say oh, by the way
Four of more free yesterday's poll
You didn't say that at the beginning
Call up and name all of the movies
That you can think of that have nudity
Or where people touch each other
Yeah, that's it
Or where they thought about doing it
Would have been good
Or talked about it
Here's Miami, hello
I'm Goliol
Okay
Hello
Yes, sir
Is this me?
It sounds just like you
Yeah
Hey, uh
Look, that lies in COD
Oh, James Spader again
Come on, George
Yes, he don't like James Spader
But what was the ronic about that?
Nothing erotic happened
Well, if you're not a boy or an exhibition
This hit my dot gets your lady
That's right
This guy's a boy or an exhibitionist
Thank you very much for now
You're welcome
No, I've been anything to see
Have a great day here
I'm just gonna let you know
Don't let George crap on your parade
Okay, he does it all the time
Sex lives in video tape
He liked it, it cranked his chain
Put it down
Or put it down
I'm not working with him
But don't be knocking that guy
Just because he happens to be desperate
Maybe that'll think for James Spader
I don't know
He must
Now, what was that movie
I kept telling you about that
And where I came
Re-Kanu Reeves movie
Also with James Spader
What the hell was that?
Was that the erotic?
I don't think so
I think they were doing each other
What do you know that Kiano?
He like
He swings it in all direction
Let's do a pint crash
Hello
Hello
Yes sir
No, glad to see you back in action buddy
Thank you so much
How about
Dutututu
Deliverance
Yeah, how about it
Nobody had that
It was it was amusing the first time
But this time was kind of like
Look on the weak side
Do you know what I'm saying?
When you say it was just a little
We- A little
But it wasn't a hell of a movie
I'll say that
Back when Bert Reynolds wasn't
We're in a stupid hair piece
Was he wearing a hair piece in that movie
Or not?
I don't know
It's hard to tell
Let's ask
An expert
You mean an expert on hair pieces
Right, somebody who would know
I don't think he would know
About other people's hair pieces
I- I- I- I- I- I- I- Yes he- he don't want to tell
I- I- I- I-
Because you have Gator, doesn't that
Well, in fact the information, okay, Mo
That's the way he is
He's a hard-ass
Oh, by the way, don't forget
Joe Roosevelt long ago
Want to talk about how he's been protecting guilty all these years
Here's Oakland Park
Hello
Oakland Park
Yes, I love you, I do
Okay
Are you guys a mission a good one?
Uh, Downs
Got it
Yes, got it
We got it like a long time ago
But you may not have been listening
Which you're in C. George comes right back
Sarcastic
Yes, I think that was George's thing, man
You probably were
Yes
Yes, then at that time and you're entitled
But we do have it on a list
Okay, thanks a bunch
Thank you
See?
You have to be sarcastic with this guy
Now, what do they hate you like poison?
Funny
Nice to people like me
Come on
Be nice, don't be calling people
Assholes
And chopping them off and things like that
Be nice to them
Even that crazy guy
Be nice to them a little bit
You-asshole
Got what he eyes?
Be nice to him
He might, uh, someday come in handy for you
I can't wait to go over it
And Gilbert be nice to go
You know what? Let's have a big party in Owen Vitamon
In fact, maybe Gilbert and the guy with the eyes
And the guy with the fanny pack and come in hang out
Outside with freaky carlos someday
On the lobby
Only if they bring Jack with the hands
I think that's a match made in purgatory right there
Or you're Jack with the hands that goofy guy
That would be good
All those people
If you wonder why Nio doesn't do it
With those personal appearances anywhere
I think we just gave it like the first clue
Okay, the first hint
1251 at 56
If you know what Tom Brady's got
What?
Besides all the other obvious things
He's got a bald spot
I had no idea
Which goes to sure that nobody's perfect
Even somebody is lovely as Tom Brady
He's got a bald spot that's growing
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised too very long
He'll be going to see my good buddy Chuck Alphieri
In fact, next time that I meet up with Tom Brady
I'm gonna say, hey, Tommy is I pat him on the back
Put my hand on his knee
Tommy, I got some good advice for it
Go see the best hair guy in the world
Who make you look beautiful
Even more than you already do
Chuck Alphieri
His natural hairline system is the best technology
Go on anywhere
Which is why it looks like the real thing
The choice is yours
You can have that Sam Dovelson look
Or that Mohawar David had looked
That silly ass look
Where people are laughing their ass off at you
Because it's so obvious
It's like a dead animal tied in your head
And it's not the real thing
Or Charlie's natural hairline system
That looks like the hair is growing right under your scalp
That's the difference
Simple as that
And then they got the guys with the dangerous pills
The guys don't want to drill holes in your head
And the blood is dripping down your forehead
Forget about those things
Charlie gives that 38-year-old T-2
He got nothing loose but the bald spot
Because if after 30 days you don't love the way it looks
And feels if you're not getting laid at least 10-15 times today
Charlie gives you a full refund no questions
Acts
And be sure to mention the Arrogers
You get extra 200 bucks off the regular price too
When you call it a Charles Alphier Studios
And get your hair back for once and for all
So look better and younger than you ever thought you would again

Oh thank you
That's tonight on a brand new episode of CSI Baghdad
Right after no survivor irrox

If you can, I'd like to throw a bomb a rag
If the markets are a drama, bomb a rag
Oh
If the terrorists are frisky, Pakistan is looking
Shifty, North Korea is too risky, bomb a rag
If we have no allies with us, bomb a rag
Okay
If we think that someone's this, this bomb a rag
So to hell with the inspections
Let's look up for the elections
Close your mind and take the righteous bomb a rag
Fall in line and follow orders, bomb a rag
For our right exceeds our borders, bomb a rag
Unbelabel
258-560 WQAM
Ah
Take a look at this pool baby
What was the most erotic now?
They found them in what the pool is today
Are they still working on the design?
You racerhead
I think that's the winner
Racerade didn't do as well as you thought yesterday
No, a lot of people didn't see that movie and then that's a good thing
Yeah, maybe that's excellent for the human race
That's a good sign of why a lot of us are still here
Is the fact that we did not see eraser head
The most erotic movie not x-ray that you've ever seen
9.5 weeks, 69
Did I make that up?
No, and you just look at that and what does it say?
69
Body heat 61
Blue Lagoon 29
Basic instinct 23
Wild work at 19
Wild things 19
Monsters ball 16
Unfaithful 16
Fatal attraction 15
Mulholland Drive only 13
Now you have to see that again from the very beginning
Yes, I did
In fact, I'm sure because it was one of my movie channels
If I go and check this schedule which I'll do in a minute
Uh, it's probably going to be on again soon
Because I didn't see it right from the very beginning
I'll be around that I have my 50 keys to understanding what it's all about
Maybe all the look at this
The postman always rings twice 12 already
And you were pooping that like what's that?
Summer lovers 10 two moon junction 10 and the rest
Kind of like in the George Catereray small potatoes
So this was okay for me this worked out well not tomorrow
What we're going to do?
The 50 favorite dead actors through they will do the 50 favorite uh dead actresses
Okay, and then Friday will do the 50 favorite talk show host
Speaking of uh interesting people
