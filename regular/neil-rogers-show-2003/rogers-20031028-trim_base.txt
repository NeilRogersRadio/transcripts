If you could figure out how to work the clocks on time, Zach,
and Neil wouldn't have to take your pay and use it to buy me lunch,
you could ever get anything right.
You fass off you.
Overrated.
You tubby-dew bastard.
BAM!
You NBA lover.
So let me ask you a question.
What time do the festivities start?
Because I had a call from Clarence yesterday.
But I mean, I didn't...
Yeah, all I cramp about, uh, would've be okay if Boog called in
around 11 o'clock in the morning.
Oh my god.
I'm reading through the stuff here.
I don't see anything starting at 11 o'clock this morning.
Well, it is at Flagler and then later today in Fort Lauderdale,
they're doing it on boats.
Yeah.
And it's just, uh, I mean, Clarence was putting the sunblock on for like an hour,
dude.
It's just a scene around here.
The motorcade is at one o'clock, right?
At about two thirty.
I think you may be right.
And the boat parade starts at four thirty till five o'clock.
You got that right.
And I'm reading all of this stuff and I'm wondering,
what the hell are we going to be talking about?
11 o'clock this morning.
What's Boog going to be down here?
Uh, try to, like, get the dayband boring excited or something.
I think he's going to stride.
I think he's going to try to emulate the San Diego fires and start some arson.
You know, the fact that we're still playing promos with Dave Van Boorings' voice
from the World Series.
How about from us from the wild card win?
Oh my god.
Up, up, and away.
He ought to go up up in a way like Superman.
Put a cape on.
OK.
In fact, it's part of the big celebration today.
We ought to take him like the one bisquind tower and like put a cape on Dave Van Boorings
and have him jump off.
So did you see Brian Greasy last night?
I didn't watch any of that.
I was too depressed about the Leafs blowing that game last night.
I guess Atlanta, no less.
Against, no, Atlanta's pretty good.
Oh, you think they'd come around now in five years?
Well, they all feel a hell of a good start.
They looked like they're playing pretty good to me.
That covaled chup man, this kid is, uh, they, some first seven games, he's got two headpricks.
Do you think he's faster than Buré was?
No.
No.
Buré was fine.
In fact, Buré, you know, there's another guy,
played in the soft photo, got treated like crap, got no respect.
And then whatever garbage they peddled about him, uh,
oh yeah, the media reported Dutifully, Buré Jackass and all the other Mike,
uh, what's that little Pudgy guy that writes in the Sun,
Sun, Sun, LaHonky, uh, how is he now?
Well, Mike Russo and, uh, and they,
other, they sparse it there for the hero.
Well, whatever they would tell him to put in the paper,
they would report it very dutifully.
Well, Pavel is disruptive in a room and he's just,
he's by far the most exciting athlete,
whoever played sports in soft photo.
There's nobody's even close.
Even Brian Greasy.
I said, of course, for today,
because the memory last night's game is fresh in their mind.
You don't think Jeff Brown,
don't keep falling down, Brian.
You don't think Jeff Kona,
did you know the beast died this morning?
Well, yeah, that's one of those things.
You know who did die?
Oh, yeah, Ruddy.
Rod Ruddy, man.
Yeah, he had great outfits.
He had great outfits, you know, where he used to buy him?
Vegas.
Thailand.
Sweet.
I get mine in, uh, uh, uh,
Shelley Bloons.
I guess now I can tell the rest of the story, right, George,
about why he used to go to Thailand to play the game.
I can give you any of the mattress.
That your diala mattress, can you give me a mattress, dude?
Sure, no problem.
Oh, y'all, he got me the, uh, I love the carpet people, uh, dry concepts.
I want to shift in.
I'm at for some diala mattress.
I need a diala mattress.
A mattress that because 34 C, I got to share a queen.
What are it's impossible?
You're going to get your own car.
I mean, you mean clearance is hanging out the house now?
No, no, no, 34 C.
I'm talking about over here.
Fantasy 5th, by the way,
let's hear it from off.
He'll back and he'll do it with some handy duty work.
I asked him today, I said, aren't you on vacation?
It was just a one day.
Well, seriously, why don't you explain to me what,
what it is?
Why would we be talking to Boo?
Why are they interrupting my high-paid show?
I don't know.
I love Boo.
Don't get me right.
It's a very kind of great talent.
But what are we going to talk about 11 o'clock this morning?
There's nothing going on yet.
Well, I had a bunch of little Hussies call from down on a street corner
with cocaine-escapar.
And now it's more exciting than anything Boo is going to give you.
What's he going to talk about the game from last Saturday?
And not on the show, he's not.
What's he going to talk about?
I changed my mind, clearance.
Tell Boo.
Don't take it personal.
But, or if you want to take it personal, go ahead.
We're not interrupting the show to put up reports on.
Breathless reports because all of a sudden, we're at a Marlins' thing.
But if we had a big float with a couple of balls,
and then we said, we've got balls, and we all went around
with a big sack on a float.
And we hung Dona Shalala and Effaji right there on the floor.
That was great.
And we had everything going.
And we had everything going to come down to see that.
I would pay money to really, can we get it?
Just don't know.
Anybody can get us a quick float.
Definitely was about floats.
That was a good idea.
You two got part of Marlins'.
The Marlins' win.
Marlins' win.
Marlins' give me another beer.
Party.
Yeah, I've won the vote.
Okay, Davis is done.
The far end of Marlins.
Now women voters didn't care.
Then I pinched all their buns.
The people of California.
They like me a lot.
I just like them.
I've had a few orgies at Smoglarsabad.
I am the governor.
It's true.
So bad that I do not have a clue.
Everyone is in another high.
I am the cow.
Not everybody.
I am the cow.
You like being the movies.
That's why I'm the cow.
Not of God you're for ya.
Who can believe it?
I'm right.
Who can believe it?
Anybody?
No.
No, not really.
We'll wake up one day.
Here's the quote of the day.
Quote of the month.
If you want to create a strong nation in a strong country,
you cannot let everybody be an individual because everybody has his own opinions
and you just can't stick together as a strong nation.
Then you have to tell people what to do and you can't just let them float away.
In Germany, there was a lot of unity.
Quote from California's new governor like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I thought Arnold...
As we go step along, I'm telling you, that's why the Lord is burning California.
That's why 500,000 acres have already burned and it's no-handed sight.
They're burning in a whole state.
God has burned up.
He has pissed off and fired up.
Let me tell you right now.
So as I just told for real, we're not going to put Bougain here today
unless he's got something special.
We're not talking baseball.
You know, the games are burning enough to begin with.
And I will say it was a nice exciting run.
It was good for the community.
Like I was telling everybody, we found out on the show yesterday.
Nobody really cares.
It's just an excuse to go out and get drunk.
Am I right about that?
Yeah.
That's one thing Saffo does really well in...
...hardy...
I hope to drop it from my head for any excuse whether they really give a crap or not.
Now, speaking of that,
1100 votes on our second poll yesterday, but we did heavy duty.
You realize we did a whole almost 1600 votes?
What?
Altogether, sure.
On a weekday poll, that's pretty impressive.
Now that I'm back, I mean...
Anyway, now George did a fine job while I was gone.
And let me say it again.
You bastards out there.
They ripped George and Ass all the time and I can understand why.
But regardless of that, how come you don't have like a little...
You know what it reminds me of?
It's like jica.
Where is jica's column saying, oh, well, I wrote some stuff like two years ago
about Roger's this and about how Kitty-Make had worked and doing the show from Toronto
and Amsterdam and here and there.
And now that the ratings come out and we're kicking ass, where's his column?
Where's his saying like, oh, well, you know what?
Guess what? They pulled it off.
It's really a phenomenal and it's a real tribute to the old man and George
and Greg Reed being a moron and screwing everything inside.
Oh, by the way, speaking of that, did you know about PD Lenny and Doreen?
So anyway, 1100 and three votes.
Did you already know about that?
We just did all this morning.
Oh, oh, man.
Talk about birds of a feather flocking together.
So here's the poor result from our second pool yesterday.
Oh, I want to look at those calls.
Let's hear it for the Marlins.
Come on, that must be what it's about.
Here's a call from Miami. Hello.
Yes sir, it's at Marlins station.
Yes, Daniel. Go on, you little assholes.
1100 and three votes.
How much did the World Series win by the Marlins impact your interest in the team?
A bit. I watched some of all of the games, 330.
That's what I voted. That's almost a...
About 30, man.
29.9%.
Some, but I've been a fan already.
326. That's 29.5%, which is almost...
About 30, man.
Not at all. I still don't give a shmit about them. 289.26.2%.
Over a quarter.
Tons. I really impacted me.
Tons. I'm a real fan now.
158. 14.3%.
Can we believe that?
No, but that sounds pretty impressive.
Now we're going to do two polls again today, although we got a lot of...
Just too much crap, you know what?
So we don't have time for Bougain or Stupid Calls.
Sorry, Clarence, but I changed my mind.
See, suck me into it.
I got sucked in.
Yeah, you're in a good mood this morning.
No, no, it's not just that, but I thought...
When he called me yesterday, I thought that the festivities were starting like maybe 11 o'clock in the morning.
Something like that.
And Bougain is going to call in and give you a report and there's thousands of people down there.
There's nothing going on till minimum one o'clock.
I don't know if you're listening.
The first deal, the motorcade on Southwest 8th Street on Hai Ocho is going to start at 1 o'clock and end about 230.
The Bougain parade is until 430-05 on the New River in Fort Lauderdale.
So what is he talking about?
You know, I'm really ignorant about all these sports activities, but what could the report sound like at best?
What are we going to find out that it's interesting that we don't already know?
Beats you a lot of me.
Well, it's just their way of trying to like, you know, sneak into the four hours here because God forbid it.
It's like when there used to be a Jimmy Johnson press conference, you know, and Barry Jack asked me if the sports nerds would rip me and ask,
Oh, WQM is supposed to be a sports station, but during the near-order show, they didn't even put on Jimmy Johnson's press conference saying we got a shot.
Yeah, well speaking of Jimmy Johnson, here's the first pool today.
Let's get it up right away, Eric.
And I know that people are going to say, well, gee, you know, you're always just like yesterday.
I mean, what do we get?
We get not only a lot of people calling yesterday saying, well, I'm not going to get too excited because they're going to just,
I'm worried they're going to dismantle the team again.
They're going to Mickey Mantle the team.
And then we also get, oh, well, why are you talking about sports?
You're always saying it's not a sports show.
I mean, finally, something good, something exciting happens in South Florida.
And they South Florida audience, all they can do is be negative.
And then they blame me of being like not enthusiastic enough.
What would you like me to do?
Like do a Kazzotsky in my pants?
What would you like me to do about it?
You're the ones that are supposed to be excited.
I'm not there. I'm out of touch like Jikras says.
I've been over at Amsterdam.
Waking up at four in the morning and looking on the day I'm text on CNN to see what the final scores have been.
That's what I've been doing.
And that's the truth, to show you that I had like a little, oh, look at that.
Antigay preacher busted soliciting a 14-year-old boy.
Oh, right.
We better get to that story soon.
What a shock.
And it, okay, here's full number one.
And I bet you we get a lot of more good calls like that first one, too.
Who should be the dolphin starting quarterback after Brian Greacy's brilliant performance in 10p last night?
It heard it was a tempest in a p-pot.
Brian Greacy, J. Feetler, I hate the dolphins.
I don't give a Schmidt or Haney-Lenoff sports you asshole.
Those are your five choices.
On another sensational poll.
Who should be the starting dolphin quarterback?
That's a little controversy now.
It's a lot of good controversy.
I see great code tags hopped right into it this morning.
But I'm going to put a stab in poor J. Feetler in the back.
I think you're an anti-Semite Greg.
I think that's what is.
I think it's a religious thing, don't you?
Yeah, sure.
I think he's an anti-Semite.
Greg code tags you idiot.
And Dan LeVastard still wants to know how come a Cuban did.
Well, Alex Gonzalez did hit the home run to win game number five, right?
Sure.
He's a good ol' stick.
So there you go.
So without Alex Gonzalez.
And it wasn't also Alex Gonzalez who made that great slide around to touch the plate beyond Jorge Posada.
See.
If I ever hear Tim McArver say Jorge Posada again, I may kill myself.
Do you know what I'm talking about, Scott?
Oh, the way he draws it out.
The way Jorge Posada, like he's trying to be like literate and articulate,
that illiterate piece of crap ex-jock.
Tim McArver is the anti-Christ.
See, hey Ronnie, don't worry about it.
Reagan thought he was the anti-Christ.
Have no fear Tim McArver is here.
He just won't show it up.
But it's Jorge Posada.
But unfortunately for Jorge Posada,
Alex Gonzalez slid around him, got his finger on the plate.
And that was the first run of the game that won a World Series.
Am I right? That was the winning run.
It was.
It was absolutely correct.
10, 14, at 5, 60 WDQM, we got your Marlon Station.
Baby lots of festivities.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Okay.
And QM will be broadcasting live from to the 7 with the big oh and Kimba Bo camper at Las Olas Riverfront for Marlin book parade.
Long and new river will be there from 2 to 7 of course the only problem that is the parade isn't the thing on a river.
It doesn't start till 4 30.
But don't ever let that stop us because naturally we have to capitalize all we can and squeeze as much cash out of it as possible.
Log out at WQM dot com and look for the Florida Marlins World Series wallpaper downloaded to the desktop of your computer.
All of that stuff all that very important information from Clarence Deere who's doing one piss poor job of covering all of this stuff really bad.
Let's see Orlando be on and business kind of like redundant.
What?
That he sends me this thing didn't I just get you saying the big is going to be on 2 to 4 and Kimba from 4 to 7 at the huh.
I just got to say that little redundancy there is the first time liners and memos and all kinds of stuff.
But the important information we needed is it there.
No nice gone clearance you idiot.
And don't have boo calling on a show because it'll be your last living act that guarantee that I don't want to insult him by like hanging up on him.
You know if he should be on a year you know what I mean.
Well you know talk to about something else.
I don't want to talk to him period we have a lot of we have an important show to do here.
We can't like sideline the show because the freaking Marlins won the World Series.
They did?
Anybody who's interested in that show and get that they're done in their Guayabaras and their Marlin t-shirts right?
Marlins Guayabaras.
That's right let's have some Marlins Guayabaras.
Guayabaras.
Or they're like hopping into the new river right now.
Can't really like start to swim enough side down.
So whatever it is you want to do go celebrate have a party have a great time but don't interfere with my highly rated show please.
That's the way it is clearance you idiot you lying sack of crap.

Yankee sucks.
Okay thanks a lot of Pally.
Good call air from Boynton Beach.
He said George is okay not too great but okay and Yankee sucks.
He's got the good stuff.
99 votes on a poll he's in Boynton Beach you better hit the highway right now.
Hey Yankee.
Have fun at Hershey Highway.
Who should we get off and starting quarterback?
This is our first poll today.
We might let this go a little longer and I anticipated because the other one requires some building.
I don't know the other one is too positive.
I don't think the town is in a mood for that based on yesterday and based on so far today.
Well they're all stoned off their ass okay and why the hell not?
It's a party time.
The Marlin's just won a world series.
That's a good excuse.
Just get stoned on your ass.
102 votes who should be that often starting quarterback Brian Greacy 55.
Hey Neal, enough sports you asshole 16.
I don't give a Schmidt 13.
I hate that often 11.
I was my vote and Jay Feeler's only got 7 for the Jewish boy.
55 is 7 out of those people who care who give a crap.
55 for Brian Greacy and poor Jay Feeler's only got 7.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Of course the show you win you're down in that town man they just hop on your ass.
But they're right of course unless you want to.
In fact maybe those 7 people are people who like jets and papi fans.
That could be it.
People are hoping that all pins lose their ass.
Oh yeah put Feeler in there.
He's better than you think he is.
Hey Brian don't fall down now.
Who do you think is going to start against Indianapolis Sunday Scott?
Don't struck.
Don't struck.
He's going to be starting Earl Moral's going to be waiting in the wings with that big sheriff's hat he's got.
He's going to be coming in from Davy.
Anti-gay preacher busted soliciting 14 year old boy Westchester Pennsylvania.
A Pennsylvania preacher known for his fire and brimstone sermons speaking of brimstone hats.
The announcing homosexuality's been charged with offering $20 to a 14 year old boy for Earl sex.
All right.
The reverend Stephen White better known as brother Stephen.
Regularly visited college campuses throughout the northeast often at Penn and Yale in Connecticut.
White is awaiting trial which is set for November 24.
But police say they're continuing to investigate White and believe they may have he may have victimized more than just one juvenile.
We believe there may be other victims out there that this wasn't an isolated incident.
Westchester police detective Stan Billy said.
According to court documents White approached the teen in a green Ford van.
And as if he knew of any strip clubs at alt bookstores or shops that sold sexual explicit videos.
When the boy said he did not, White unsuccessfully attempted to lure the boy into the vehicle.
White then told the boy he could make some money by letting White perform Earl sex on him.
After the encounter, the boy, I guess the boy wanted more than 20.
After the encounter, the boy reported the van's license plate numbered with his mother who then contacted the police.
Nice going kid.
Campus Crusade for Christ leader Aaron Hesby agreed that her organization doesn't collectively support White.
Campus Crusade for Christ.
Brother Stephen is not involved or affiliated with any of these student Christian groups listed on Penn or for Jesus Hesby said.
Penn for Jesus.
Now he'll prefer the pencil so we can erase it.
If he changes his mind.
The general attitude of these Christian groups has been one of distance given certain aspects of both the brother Steve's theology and methods.
As in Oral is moral.
Maybe he was a Methodist.
Sid Chippola.
Sid Onion, a former coordinator of the Lesbian, you know, Chippola's onion and Italian.
You know that?
Now you do.
Sid Chippola, a former coordinator of the Lesbian gave bisexual and transgender cooperative a deal.
Sid she was in disbelief when she heard about White's alleged sexual offense.
I'm still kind of incredulous.
She told the Yale Daily News.
How is it that anyone can engage in something so clearly taboo, especially someone who presents themselves as so entrenched in morality?
I feel sorry for this man and for the boy who crossed his path.
Let me just say it again.
Every single one of the homophobes, every one of the finger pointers, every one is a closeted bag.
There are no exceptions.
Amen, brother.
White is charged with criminal attempt to lure a child into a motor vehicle and criminal solicitation to involuntarily deviant sexual intercourse.
Last week a Florida preacher was charged with attempting to lure a 15-year-old boy for sex.
Police arrested Hughort Lee Bennett of West Palm Beach.
Did you have that story on?
I don't know.
Shame on you.
He's accused of using a gay internet chat room to pick up the teen.
Bennett who's an assistant youth minister at the first 7th day Adventist church in West Palm Beach says he was using the chat room to talk to young boys and girls about being gay.
And to try to put them on the right path, aka the path of his door.
Right, the path of their back door or whatever door they be looking for.
Nice going there. All you finger pointers out there, a bunch of phony baggots.
You're not fooling nobody. Not this kid.
20 minutes away, I guarantee you the calls are going to start pouring in.
All these people on their cell phones from the big ticker tape parade.
Right. And where is that ticker tape parade?
Right over there.
Right over there.
That's south.
Well, let's see.
What I didn't even say here.
Flagler.
Doesn't even. I'm not going to listen to you.
Do you think I'm out of my mind or something?
Yes.
In downtown Miami, workers prepared a stencil.
The World Series in Cigna in Marlins logo where the team would pass the ticket tape parade starting 11 and again a new ceremony in Bayfront Park.
This is a really a horse ball story. This is bad.
So it's a contest like who did the worst job?
Clarence or the assholes at the Sun Central?
Why isn't there like a little diagram?
Showing where it starts, where it ends, who's going to be on top of the other bottom?
Huh?
They've been showing it on the news.
Whose name ends in a easy things like that?
All of them.
But anyway, this other motorcade stuff parade starts at 1 and ends at 2.30.
So we got stuff going on nonstop all day long and two bad clearance couldn't take the five minutes out of his busy schedule.
What are the beasties under the weather, huh?
Under the what?
He was under the desk and always under the weather because he probably got attacked by Clarence from the euphoria of the big Marlins.
So it's sports, so Clarence got a little carried away.
How do you feel under there?
Here's Coconut Creek.
Hello.
Feeders only two outs with 19 to 11 at 5.60 W to QAM.
Are we three? Are we betting 1,000 or what?
So far, let me say it again.
Even Tyco, even Baby Root, never bet in a thousand like we do on this show.
142 votes, Brian Greacy 82, who should be that often started in quarterback?
Hey, Neil, off sports you ass, hold 20.
I love putting those on there because they just hop on it.
I don't give a Schmidt 16.
I hate that all of them 15.
J. Feetler 9.
So 82 to 9.
Not looking too good, Jay.
Oi!
If you're looking for really neat place to pick up some good chow.
Here's the place.
Vickiners and I know about it because I ate there before most of you were born.
Vickiners has been around since 1934, starting in my hometown of Rochester, New York.
Vickiners in South Florida now, that's a good news for you.
It's right by you located on the Federal Highway, just south of Bard,
Bordart on the tunnel on the east side.
Vickiners is a flashback in time to what restaurants used to be before fast food crap.
So go and enjoy a burger or hot dog served hot fresh and fast.
And Vickiners is being brought to you in South Florida by the same guys who feed you
Cheaper Grachie Burger and they use the same fresh 100% ground chuck meat as Cheaper Grachie Burger.
And offer you an incredible big fat quarter pound hot dog.
What a piece of meat that is to put your lips around.
What makes Vickiners different from anybody else in town is that their burgers and dogs are served with
Vick's signature meat sauce poured on top so it does like a kazansky in your mouth.
It's a combination of flavors that will really tickle your tonsils.
If you want something else to try, they got lots of great dishes on the menu,
including a stupendous breakfast menu.
They have all your favorite things like omelettes cooked to order, French toast pancakes,
and all your favorite side dishes too.
Stop by Vickiners, whether you're from Rochester, Brighton,
Rondiquit, Lee Roy, Syracuse, Elmira, Palmyra, Ethica, wherever they head you're from.
And see what all the talk is about.
Vickiners on federal highway just south of Bard, Boulevard, and the tunnel on the east side and four-lotterdale.
And be sure to tell them that ancient neal, sent you by.
My, and loco. This is Sports Radio by City.
You ain't no way, yeah.
Yeah.
First there was vanilla coke.
Then Pepsi jumped on the bandwagon with Pepsi vanilla.
And now, Pepsi is trying to rip off coke in an even bigger way.
Introducing Pepsi Coke.
It's Pepsi with a flavor of coke.
I haven't had Pepsi this good since the last time I had a coke.
That's because the cans have Pepsi, but the taste says Coke.
Wow! Pepsi Coke is awesome!
See, some 20-something gulped it down and said it was awesome.
So it's gotta be good.
And it comes in every possible variety.
There's Diet Pepsi Coke one.
Caffeine free Pepsi Coke.
Caffeine free Diet Pepsi Coke.
Cherry Pepsi Coke.
Lemon Cherry Diet Pepsi Coke Blue.
And Caffeine free Lemon Cherry Diet Pepsi Coke. Blue with caffeine.
Wow! I had no idea the taste of all my favorite Pepsi flavors would taste better with the taste of coke.
Take the Pepsi Coke taste test today.
And see if you can tell if you're chasing Pepsi or Coke or both.
Pepsi Coke.
It's the Pepsi name you know with a taste of Coke you love.
Hey, if there's any of those slipping false specialists that they've got a great new scam for you,
the Coca-Cola people in their real brilliance, they came out with like a clank coke classic,
which I thought was long gone.
Right.
And they put it in the big two-liter bottles with the same color like brownish orange issue label as the Diet Coke.
You see where I'm going with this?
Oh, like poison.
The caffeine free.
So anybody that's like diabetic or like desperate to lose weight or just putting sugar into the system
and thinks that they're buying Diet Coke because it's got the same color label on it.
And then it turns out after they took the swig of the first like 5-10 gallons of it,
that it's a Coke classic and loaded with sugar and they're going like,
I'm dying over here. It's good lawsuit.
It sounds like tomato, don't you think?
Well, why don't you go for it? You're allergic to caffeine.
I'm working on it right after the show.
Anyway, so who gave you this nice map that we got here in all these details?
I've read a search and found it in the Gerald and printed it up in fact.
See, there you go. We had to find it in a hero because the Sun Sentinel blow is that number one.
And Clarence is just falling down on the job.
Don't ever give a little child a man's job and expect him to get it done.
Clarence, you blow man.
He's done lots of man's jobs.
It has he.
What kind of jobs?
Anyway, the parade starts 11 o'clock this morning on Flagler Street from my second avenue
to Bayfront Park on Biscayne Boulevard.
Following a ceremony at noon in Bayfront Park, the parade resumes at Southwest 27th,
and the Avon Southwest 8th Street.
It'll head east on Southwest 8th to 6th Avenue, ending by about 2.30.
2.30, man.
And let's see.
The paraded 4.30 on today, the new river from Lausanne, I already gave you that.
Right?
Then the parade will be followed by a big party at the Riverfront Park at 5 p.m.
featuring Marlon's players, music, and food.
That's a good stuff to eat, a stuff in your push.
And then, what's your name?
That's the second one.
What's the other one?
The boat parade.
No, I just gave you the boat parade on New River.
That's probably this avenue.
There's one at 1 o'clock.
What about the one at 1 o'clock?
What the hell is this story?
Is that like small potatoes?
Where is it?
That one is 20 block route in a motorcade stop right starting in 1 p.m.
Expected to stay in 2 p.m.
And by 2 p.m., I can't keep all of the stuff straight.
There's just 2 damn much.
It's too heavy duty.
Too high pressure.
Now, is that the same one?
Is there only 2 events?
Or are there 3?
3.
3.
Right?
There's the one that starts at 1.
That's the motorcade stop parade at 1 till 2.30.
And there's the 11 o'clock to any minute now starting the ticket tape parade.
Right there.
And I just give it the route.
And then there's the boat parade on a new river.
Boat of them.
So there's tree, countermeasures, tree of them.
So just go and have a good time and get drunk and the stone off your ass.
Like I said, have a great day.
It's available online.
We're all quick to think.
This map and all this information is online.
They'll figure it out.
Just look where there's all bunch of drunk people and you'll have a great time.
Oh, here?
5.6.7.0.5.60.
I want to hear from somebody who's on the way to that big ticket tape parade right now here on your Marlon station.
It would be really embarrassing.
Almost as embarrassing as Jay Feeler have it only 12 votes out of 176.
And Brian Greacy have a 97.
Jay, don't take it personal as you want to.
You're probably used to it by now.
But not only don't they like you.
Not only don't they have any confidence in your athletic abilities, which are marginal at best.
But your close association with somebody that we all know and despise.
Absolutely.
Probably also have to do with the fact that you've fallen like a falling star from the sky.
Like a shooting star right to the ground in the eyes of the public out there because your close association
is somebody that they revile.
Absolutely.
That they hate.
Absolutely.
That they despise.
Absolutely.
That they can't stand and wish would just croak a wicked death and take his weasel with them.
Absolutely.
Somebody like that.
But I could be wrong.
5.6.7.0.5.60.
Come on.
Let's chat it up as they say.
And now what they say?
Let's chat it up.
Yeah.
For the...
Let's chat it up.
That's what those Brits say.
And take a look at them.
If you got a strong stomach.
Here's Davey.
Hello.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian.
I can just see him working on it right now.
Jimmy and Danny.
Jimmy and Danny.

You're a genius.
You're hired.
See, I know we get a good call sooner later.
5.6.7.0.5.60.
Pound 5.60 on the AT&T line.
We love the dolphins.

Hello.
Hey, first of all, congratulations to the Marlin.
Thank you.

And Jay.
Hey, cow.
They love you, Jay.
183 votes.
Who should be the dolphins starting quarterback?
Bob, greasy 102.
Hey, Nie, a lot of sports you asshole.
Twenty five.
I don't give a shmit.
Twenty four.
So I hate it offence 20, that's a good choice.
And J-Feeler 12.
So the 114 votes between the two contenders there, they were could have been a contender.
Brian Greasy has got 102 and poor J-Feeler is only got 12.
Not too tight yet huh?
Kind of like Scrooan, not too tight.
5, 6, 7, oh it had line 1, did anybody start working on it yet?
No.
Did you talk to fiction about it?
Yes.
And he said, the group has to be done at off peak hours.
What does that mean?
That means that's to be worked on when we don't have a day loose your phone calls.
We have a day when we don't have any phone calls.
Yeah, when all the shows are not using the call lines late at night I guess.
Oh I see.
Like when we have ESPN radio on, so it's like maybe late in the week like Friday night.
Sure.
Why should we worry about one crappy line huh?
Here's Oakland Park.
Hello.
Hello Neil.
Yes sir.
Are you in Toronto now?
That looks like it to me.
How's the quality like?
Quality life here is sensational.
It's outstanding.
OK, what about the quality of anal sex for you?
Is it better?
The panel sex is better than ever man.
It's fantastic.
How has yours lately?
Yeah, sees that.
You don't like that.
You don't like that.
5, 6, 7, oh 5, 60, pound 5, 60.
Back home on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
And by the way, let me say it again, my paycheck from this last time plus the abonus plus
the Italian check.
There's enough money I just got through putting in a bank and the watch over your money
bank that more than you make in two years pal.
Then have a great day and have a good time at the parade.
5, 6, 7, oh 5, 60.
Here's a call from Aventura.
Hello.
Hey Neil, good to have you back.
Congratulations to the Marlins.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm listening sir.
I thought about that car off.
Sorry about that, Neil.
No chance.
Hey Neil.
That's for you.
Neil, Peter, bye bye.
Greasy will know if he's good in the next game.
But get the calls.
We really played a, you know, not a really good team.
Played a girls team last night in a great stadium.
That's right.
Don't forget the penis cardinals play there in that stadium.
And it was written to which everybody who got into that game paid exactly what it was
worth for admission.
Nothing.
Zero.
That's right.
That's right.
Neil.
And congratulations against the Marlins.
It's really nice to have you back.
I missed you a lot.
And that's about it, buddy.
OK, everybody.
Hey, Palli, you'll see in the parade.
We'll see it in your banana boat.
Where ever the hell you are.
Can you imagine all the banana boats are going to be going up the new river?
Hey, I got my other two.
Yeah, I got my other two.
Well, I got, I don't know.
It just, I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave the quarterback pool on
all day today and save the other one for tomorrow.
All right.
Well, I'm serious because I just have too much stuff.
I don't have time to be building no poles today.
OK, to be climbing on no poles.
In spite of what that fudge packer was saying a couple of calls back, 5, 6, 7, let me say
it again.
Anyone who points the finger, anybody starts with the anal sex, the fag stuff.
Every one of you is a freaking faggot.
OK, is what you are.
OK, you're a flying mattress.
You're a closet bag.
You have to do anybody what?
And that's what I heard that would be for a flying mattress.
That's right.
Is that like a flying buttress?
Right.
Exactly the same thing.
But vacuumed.
Trist.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.
And Verizon Wireless Line.
I mean, here are the marlins.
We got the parades going on.
We got ticker tape paraded in about six minutes.
And all South Florida can think about is.
Reckham ash.
That's all I know.
Reckham ash.
Reckham big ash.
Reckham small ash.
Little ash.
Reckham high ash.
Reckham loose ash.
Muddy oozing hemorrhoids filled ash.
Reckham.
Ticking seeds out of their ass, et cetera.
That's all I know from.
That's the point.
It's the Amos of the universe.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, man.
What's going on with Ricky, man?
We should just create a death.
Ricky, Ricky?
Yeah, Ricky Williams.
Ricky Tiki, I get lost.
We're not talking about football.
Ricky, Richard.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
See, here again, proves exactly what I've always said.
I didn't watch any of the game last night.
He couldn't have had a bad game.
This guy, I'm sure, watched the game, didn't you?
No.
Oh.
Well, did he have a decent game last night?
And even if he didn't, they won a game 24 to 10.
What is this man crying about?
That's all you people know how to do is cry like babies.
Like babies.
If he got something good, like I said before, to a forrest morning, Pavel Brewery, the
greatest athlete whoever played in South Florida, they wouldn't know him from Pavel of
the dog.
They had no clue who the hell was.
I got a word for your fans.
They suck.
Malcontents.
Yeah, that's exactly.
That's very good.
Malcontents.
I can even spell it.
Yeah, you got Mal Brooks and you got Malcontents.
And that's what South Florida is loaded with no matter what it is you can't play.
And it's like this show.
How many years have been doing this?
South Florida.
South Florida providing them with free grade entertainment and a bunch of yucks every
guy at the end day and also pass along some useful information so that the fascists can't
catch them while they're not the weather unaware.
But in the meantime, it's never good enough.
Wow, you're really suck.
And George and Sons were really good.
And then if George and Sons were, hey, where the hell is Neil?
You're a real phony you want to be.
That's it.
Welcome home.
Same old crap, just like this morning, man, right out of the box.
We got all kinds of activity and excitement, enthusiasm and time.
But the South Florida people, man, that's basically it.
That's our message.
And that's the same message for Jay Feeler, by the way.
Oh, my God.
And Wolf.
This is Fort Real by Sikki.
You weigh in.
Like 18 people are already.
Oh, the Florida Marlin, the Florida Marlin, the Florida Marlin, the Florida Marlin, the
Florida Marlin, the Florida Marlin.
O.B.
Tampons.
The only tampon designed by Win and Gannick Collegeers.
Only win and bleed.
O.B.
Tampons.
Only win and bleed.
Because only win and bleed.
1101 at 560 WDQM, by the way, is it really time to rest birthday today because we have
a special gift for them.
Is only women bleed anyway.
241 vote on the poll.
Who should be that often start in quarterback?
And of course, the big ticker, ticker, tape parade is now 60 seconds, either way, if you
1101 in the big city.
Let's hear it from Anne Marlin, so.
They just put their on C.M.
Look at their least.
How many people are so far?
About 30, man.
241 votes.
Who should be that often start in quarterback?
You talk about piling on, man.
I think you get two 15-year penalties for this kind of unacceptable behavior.
It's absolutely as the man dog would say, disrespectful.
And that would, he would say.
Well, that's what Moll would say because he's in love with J. Feelers Anne.
Absolutely.
Rob Greasy, 138.
I mean, did I say Bob Greasy?
You said Rob.
We should have put Bob on here.
He probably would have won the poll.
Brian Greasy, 138.
Hey, Neil, enough sports you asked.
Look how many of that's got.
About 30, man.
Exactly.
30.
I don't give a Schmitt 29.
29, heart asses out there.
I hate that often 27.
Now that's my kind of thinking.
And J. Feelers 17 out of 155.
Brian Greasy's got 138 and poor J's only got 17.
Now see if there's any astute.
Well, why do I say that?
Sports people, I sports writers inside Florida.
What they should be doing is following this poll.
And then when they put their story in for them,
they should, you know, this is what they ought to be putting in there.
A scientific poll of the Neil Rogers show the most high, whatever it is, show in town.
Because we're going to wind up with about 1,500 votes on this bottom our morning, right?
Beyond a doubt.
And it showed overwhelmingly almost 60% of the respawned said Brian Greasy only about under 7% said poor J. Feelers.
And that's because he hangs out with a moment.
Absolutely.
That's correct.
They used to like him until he got tight with mole.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
By the way, here's today's death report.
Oh, you know what?
What?
Let me do this first.
That's bad.
I told you we had a pressure pack show today.
A car bomb exploded today near a police station in the intensity of Fallujah,
carrying at least four people a day after a series of suicide bombings in Baghdad,
let them about three dozen dead.
The Fallujah attack came hours after four American soldiers were wounded and ambushed
in northern Iraq.
That's also earlier today.
Today's bombing in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad, was placed in a Toyota park
in front of a power station and about 30 yards from a school in a hundred yards
from a police station witness, Hamid Ali said.
So there's the latest death report from Iraq as the bodies continue piling up
as the devastation continues going on.
And the president says yesterday that the fact that there's so many people dying now
is a good sign because it goes to show you that we've got all the terrorists
and lunatics frustrated.
And like they said on CTV here in Toronto last night as they put it on accurately
which they're not going to say on American news because they're too them timid to do it.
As they said last night it sounds like George Orwell in 1984 all over again
where good is bad and bad is good.
And they are absolutely correct.
They got their thumb right on it.
Now what was the other thing I was just going to do before I did that?
Oh about who died.
Oh, who died?
Oh no.
Well they already know about poor Rod Roddy.
In fact isn't the price is right on what time is it on 11 or 10?
So what was it?
Huh?
They're showing up.
Can you ask me does it have their conditioning?
Does the copy say?
Oh yes it does.
Their conditioning bomb.
They died.
See there you go to prices right is on right now.
How do you like them apples huh?
Well down here we have parade coverage.
Do you really?
The streets are closed and they will remain closed until two o'clock this afternoon.
Not playing the market.
How do you like that for being in touch with a real world?
I'm in Toronto.
I got the prices right on CBS out of Buffalo right there.
And we got it.
It's the standard.
Come on Jimmy.
I got it.
What do you want?
Twenty one.
Twenty one is the old dollars twenty one dollars.
Twenty one dollars.
Rod Roddy the flashy dressed in answer button.
The prices right who's booming.
Jovial voice invited lucky audience members to come on down for nearly twenty years died.
Yeah.
Yesterday was believed to be 66 and later in the story it says 67.
But who does make a difference at this point?
No, probably not.
Roddy who suffered from colon and breast cancer died at century city hospital.
According to his longtime agent Don Pitz.
He had been hospitalized for two months.
He had such a strong spirit.
He just wouldn't give up.
Pitz said yesterday.
Roddy had been ill for more than two years but continued to work as much as possible.
And for long as he could said Bob Barker hosted the prices right.
Roddy have been with the game show for 17 years.
His announcing stints included love connection 1981 to 85.
Press your luck 83 to 86.
But the prices right are in him is greatest fame and remains one of the out of the ony ony ony ony.
The Roddy Roddy Roddy he's dead.
How do you like that Rod Roddy's dead?
He died.
Oh, what else is dead Johnny Olson?
He died.
He's dead.
And Bob Barker.
Well, and Johnny Ol.
Johnny Ol is dead.
He died.
Roddy whose real name was Robert Ray Roddy was born September 18, 19, 19, 19, 19,
to seven and four word Texas.
According to CBS, his birth year was 36 which would make him 67.
But of course.
He died.
So it doesn't really make no difference.
Roddy was single is what it says here.
Well, the only family member we talked about his mother died several years ago.
Funeral plans not to be lost.
So Rod Roddy is dead is another part of that ongoing chapter.
But how many years has that damn thing been on the yacht?
Longer than that.
If you know who the first host I think on original prices right now.
I don't know.
Jack Park.
Wouldn't leg.
That's the clue.
Wouldn't leg he's dead.
Glasses.
Black rim.
Glasses.
I don't know.
No peg.
Long shot.
I mean, this you.
Huh?
Long shot.
No.
Get with it.
Okay, I'll give Scott a clue.
Okay, two hockey players NHL, John, former NHLer and Matt.
Matt.
Sending.
I got a double.
Bill Cullen, you idiots.
Bill Cullen.
You know who now Bill Cullen was?
He had a wooded leg.
He had a wooded.
No, it was not on concentration.
Our change was on concentration before him was you downs.
Jesus, you know anything?
No.
Thanks for your honesty, though.
It's refreshing.
Five, six, seven, oh five, six, you.
They got a damn parade going on over the town.
Now, big ticker takes the one.
You're sitting on the side of the ride.
Rodney and the freaking price is right.
Did that just stand on up?
Yeah, stand on up.
That's what the Bob's trying to get it to do.
Stand on up.
And what's your name to win at the pseudom?
What was your name?
Diane Parkinson.
Diane Parkinson.
Here's a call from beautiful Bokeh.
Hello.
Welcome to Marlins Tuesday.
Let's do it!
May we talk, Rick?
Whatty.
Yeah, it's whatty.
Schmock, real idiot.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
I was just calling that you guys know that I thought that Brian Greasey did a great job.
And I think that he deserves to give it a shot.
He is ugly, though.
You have to admit he's really ugly.
Well, that doesn't have to be...
He's not ugly and then feel it with his big ears.
No, that's true.
That's a good point.
In fact, you know something, I think we took the wrong poll.
Who's uglier, J. Feetler or Brian Greasey?
That's a good point.
I think that's...
That was offensively it up yesterday for the first time in a while.
Even Ricky Williams got a lot of yardage and it was nice to see.
Well, congratulations and if they were in like Sunday when they play a real NFL team,
then we'll see how good Brian really is, okay?
567-056-2.
Too much sports today.
I think those people are right.
Hey, Neil, enough sports you asshole.
272 votes on here.
Who should be that often starting quarterback?
Brian, see it's not sports, it's a religion because it's the dolphin.
There's something a lot of people that really care about.
No, it's true, you know it.
It's something they really care about as opposed to this Marlons thing today,
which is just a dog and pony show.
It's a chance for people to jump onto Badwagon and grab the brass ring.
Oh, it's me, it's me, I'm a champion, it's me, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You wouldn't buy a ticket for like 50 cents, you know?
These are the same people that were given back free tickets early in the season
when they were sucking wind.
No, given back tickets they paid for.
Right.
To see if we could...
I'm not talking for him.
278 votes, Brian Greacy's got 161, 58% for good old Brian.
Hey Brian, don't stagger into the hotel no more.
Hey, Neil, enough sports you asshole, 36.
I hate it often, guess how many for that?
Bup 30 man.
I don't give a shmit, guess how many?
Bup 30 man.
30 30.
And Jay Fieler in distant last with only 21 out of almost 300 votes.
Oh, poor Jay.
Man, oh man, he's gonna start getting a complex.
His ears are starting to grow like Bubba's nose, remember that?
When Bubba's nose started growing like Pinocchio, that was kind of cool.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, I'm still like thrown off by that line 1 being dark.
I don't like nothing too dark.
That's what I heard.
Although I do like my chocolate dark.
Don't you like dark chocolate?
Yes I do.
Hmm.
The only thing don't ever get that like 70% cocoa dark chocolate.

Swerling pool of crap
Rancid snatch
Using function moisture
Looking out her voice
Walking with the deal
We can't decide if her butt and filters rancid snatch
Rancid snatch
The one and the what it could hatch
Man, corporate snatch
I forgot about that inner-com thing about we're doing the best but that made it more exciting I guess didn't oh, yeah
I'm excited now. Why is not a heart attack? Why?
Because I think we lost the line or something
What do you mean by that you cut the bid out when you press that button? Oh, I see a couple of completely
I don't know that but I'll go on here right you can hear me. No here's silence. Oh
That's it. I'm sorry. I'm gonna do that a lot just to keep you off guard. Oh, man. I'm balanced
Now who was that on the bad line? Did you just block them off? No, just answer it. See what I mean
Oh, it's probably that from a fat boob shamby, but I it's not working. Is this boob?
What's going on, dude?
There are only people in the audience around this place and you're in it
I mean we want to do only one thing you want to know from we want to know from you. You're not taking that job of the meds
What?
Sweater, God I
Sweat on clearance. There was a grave
I
Said have a good time, Boog. It's nice talking to you
1120 at 560 WQM. There was our call from boob shamby our man. It does a great job
Boob shamby is great talent a good guy and I feel really bad for him because he already probably
Stone on their ass
Wasn't that good oh, yeah, he can't ever word. I'm saying is that what's going on?
Let me just say it again. We got a bunch of free crap for you
Just like those tickets to the dolphin little girls team last night out there in 10 p
Where everybody was late in for free. Did you see how long for they were lined up?
No, I just got no no, I'm not talking about that, but even on the news they showed the incredible lines
No, when they were showing about the state of in San Diego being used for the people who's been chased out of their homes by the fires
They showed the lines there at the Cardinals whatever the hell they call that statement tempi were the fena penis Cardinals play and they suck
Yeah, son devils played there whatever
Uh-uh, I think you're pardon line 12
Line 12 what is ringing show? I am well, I'm not gonna answer it again
He's gonna say oh, I got cut off. I'm we're done with you now, Boog
We'll talk you a little later. Maybe you probably not what is he calling back for is this something like some kind of a communist plot to disrupt
This show maybe well, we're not gonna answer to a don't answer it under penalty of death
Got a feed that very measly paycheck don't answer line 12. Let him just keep bringing it. Tell me we were doing screamers
And you could blame it on me. Well, I don't look at line 12. That's the bat line. Okay, tell me we're doing screamers
And I didn't look at it. He must have heard you anyway. We got why he hang up
I'm not joking. We don't want to talk to you. Don't take it personal sweet. Are you a great guy? We love you
But he can't hear us anyway, and you can't hear anything. I'm a sandia. Oh, that's cause you're way up there to run
I don't know it's because you got a million people scream. I mean the phone still works. I hear you
virally
See you know what we see I wasn't gonna say this but I'm gonna say now because it just reads on my fat old pimpley ass
This is the same radio station back in the beginning of the season
David Samson, Jeffrey Luria. They were the anti-Christ senior in junior. Okay, they're nothing they could do right there as holes
They're this they were that and everybody just ripping them and ass including Mo
Absolutely because the David Samson showed up like you know three seconds late on a show where everything was
Then all of a sudden when they got hot after the all-star game and 900-year-old Jack McKean came along and gave him like a wake-up call
And we got done trail and all this other excitement started having then all of a sudden it became like hey
Isn't this exciting? That was really great. Then Gilles there's sucking sucking sucking heavy duty
They're all in here eating the free food in the press box and now it's like oh my god
You think that Jesus just came back to earth with frankincense and murder for everybody at Q.I
Am you know they just can't suck hard enough
We just don't suck on this show. Maybe you're off the air. I suck. Well, not maybe but the bottom line is we are gonna
Jump on a bandwagon. Yeah, but the good news is what's that? I just saw Booge on Canal Ventit race
Always on bait to taste well he was well
No peeking at a no peek at a pony on this show man cut the crap
Incrably although I do like where is that thing again? I do like I like to name it at the place
I know it was the banner the name of the place wasn't that exciting the name of the place in Florida
There was good ugly tuna saluna. I like that. Oh the La Carreta better. Yeah, La Carreta
Oh, you know that in Amsterdam we had the me look like a place called La Carreta steakhouse. Yeah sucked
Anyway, I'm sure it's not connected, but it was La Carreta and I thought it was right near the hotel right near the Crasnipolsky
La Carreta man to meet there was it was from like before George Washington, chapter on the first cherry tree
Anyway, the Cuban restaurant down the street La Carreta in Little Havana, of course
No, speaking English displayed a banner reading off for you most on the way stores compa ones
I just like Santa

Bob Shepherd's been dead for 25 years and nobody knows it yet
Number seven Mickey Mantle
Seventh-year-old number seven
He's a six hundred years old. He you know somebody should tell him he also does the Giants football games too, right?
Yes, he does. She is a scut all mighty. I mean I know he's legendary
But he's you can notice that his voice is like 90% of it is gone. You can just barely speak
He's one of those people that wants to be buried on the job
He knew who else probably wants to be buried on the job and I can't put him on because the president speaking out Bob
press conferences Bob Barker. He wants to die on the job. I don't know why Neil am I stormed to the threat of death?
Yes, my 12th is ringing. Oh my 12th is ringing again

See clearance set him up to this and there's nothing for us to talk about
I mean everybody's having a party down there a good time
Everybody's happy and waving their flags and looking for a free crack
Right there you go and get in drunk as a skunk and pretend to really be all thrilled about stuff
Which you know they're not and that said there's nothing else there
What what if you got for me? No, there was that good was that a great line or what?
That's my laugh. It may have been one of the great radio lines in history. What have you got for me?
No, well, there's one of those and there's another one to watch to charge
Well, you're gonna love this. Speaking of what good timing. I did it again. I fell into a bucket of Schmidt
Bomm alert over break. Oh, yeah, before I go into this. Yeah careful
I'm thinking of Pedro Ramos the once great picture for the Washington Senators and the Yankees Pedro Ramos
And of course there were those who would call him Pedro Ramos
You see Ramos you call him Ramos. I call him Ramos
So the same with what's that word again
double yellows
Alpha for you most and apple yamos for the big O who of course is a professional spit
And wants to start to win at least the boo when he calls in speaks English. Okay, big O
Maybe that's one of the reasons they hate you like poison big O
Bomm alert over break-win dog. This is a true story from a BBC high comedy a novelty toy dog
Which breaks winds spark the major security report at alert and American airport
Page designer Dave Rogerson's life-size mechanical terrier set off a security detector at Norfolk airport in Virginia
Armed security staff were alerted when the toys win breaking mechanism
Registered as a high explosive on sensitive monitoring equipment
Mr. Rogerson 31 from Thornor leads in England was questioned by FBI agents and looked on an amazement as they took a series of swabs from the mechanical toys
We're in back home. That's the end. I'll make it that up
Oh
The toy animal was eventually returned to him, but he was not allowed to take his plan
Flight had to take an alternative route to North Carolina
Mr. Rogerson said there's no humor at American check-ins and from about 20 minutes
I was quite scared they told me it's the highest reading they had for explosives and they took it very seriously
They were very jumping convinced there was something explosive
In the dog
Eventually the FBI experts decided the toy was harmless and returned it to him
He has now named the toy dog Norfolk after the airport
There was something in the toy dog all right little little little wind
Now what I was at about I wrote on note to myself about not orthodox what that was at all about
Boy, I wish I did oh
Oh, no the guy that called me forward said that it's not a religion about the dolphins in South Florida
It's a religion. They're just not orthodox. That's the point I was trying to make. It's a good thing I wrote that down
Well, I just got under such pressure here today with so much crap going on and all these silly people calling them the bad line
Thanks to clearance. Hey clearance by the way, I finally figured it out
I just went in during the break and took a leak and when I was standing there peeing I finally don't I mean he's a faggot
clearance
Pearl says support
I don't hear any disagreement what I'm sorry. I was on the phone. I said parents. I finally figured out he's a fag
Oh look at that. It's ringing again. What's ringing my phone? Well, why is that I'm kidding
I don't want to comment on that how would I know I didn't mind you to comment. I just thought maybe you'd say oh no
He's not
I guess what so far a long time ago. I saw a girl he took out what's yeah, what was his name? Ed
Pearls support for Clark Ebing. Oh, that's good
The small boomer support for retired general Wesley Clark which pushed him to the front of national polls in the race of democratic presidential nomination
It appears to be Ebing
According to a CNN USA today Galapal the poll released yesterday also shows Vermont governor Howard Dean with a slim lead over Clark for the
2004 election mom is very representative dick Ghebhard is benefiting from an uptick in the popularity which I don't understand for the
For my life, you know, yeah, because the last thing we need is another dick in the White House
It also showed that the democratic mood may be swinging to the left with 39% of registered Democrats now saying they would prefer a liberal nominee
Back in August just 27% water. They liberal standard bear to face president Bush next November
What is president Bush necessary? Yeah, it's necessary. You have a nice and perfect timing again
He said it's necessary. He is almost as good as those nuclear explosions nuclear
Support for the Obama Obama among registered Democrats 15% chose Clark 60% for Dean
But that's down from 21% from Clark early October. He's a fading as Clark support is eroded Ghebhard appears to have the be the primary beneficiary rising in 12%
Ladies national poll converted 8% early in the month also. Let's see who else has got some
A julieberman of Connecticut's got 12% you should live so long read the store on our website
They we have a great stories on our website. Thank you Eric for putting up all those stories
Including what about julieberman on his website? He's got uh, what did say 300 people nationwide right on his bandwagon and foreign Chicago
He's doing it
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts got 10%
And everybody else had single digits really good news shows president Bush's job approval rating 53% 42% as approved
Which is down from like 56% last time
And a hypothetical match up with an unnamed Democrat Bush is the choice of 46% while the president's unnamed rival was picked by 43%
Even Steven and it's going to get a lot a lot worse trust me want to tell you. It's going to get a lot worse
Yeah

The home of the champions

Now we got Kimba boat camper, it says here I'd chool us
But I'm sure that's not right, is it?
Because I schmitcanned it, other thing that
The carretta is fact, because he just sent too many damn things
Or he was all redundant
Anyway, Kimba was riverfront

Los Olas Riverfront
Los Olas Riverfront
Like I said from the boat parade, from the big thing in the new river in Fort Lauderdale

Absolutely
The Mollmeister, alright
If you can't get no Mollmeister, bro, get the Mollmeister
Absolutely
He's a pathetic
5 6 7 0 5 6, let's get some calls from that ticker tape parade, let's feel, get the feeling here, right?
Yeah, okay
I just don't have the feeling that there's something exciting going on in that town that everybody is whipped up into a frenzy
It's wrong with you people, roll down those windows, get them horns honking
Hard
Here's a call from Poppano, hello
Hello
Yes sir
Yeah, I was just feeling it was God, man
Yeah, okay good
What is with the schwarches, they all whipped up, I don't know, they all hopped up on something they are what?
Here's a call from Del Rey-B, hello
Hello
Yes sir
Yeah, by the way you can say it has two different meanings, apple jamos and apple jamos
So if you say one way means one way and say it another way, it means another way
Well anyway, it translates to Sun Sentles as we support our champions, that was that correct, apple jamos?
Yeah, it just means it a different way, not a totally different way, but you can say it either way
Well there's nothing else in a nit record that big apple jamos here corrected my spiktok, man, he's got some nerve
Both of one professional spiktok, but anyways, me a lot of them listened to you since the early 80s
You know, in Ache I had a lot of your ideas when I was a job over at England and you're in a great mood today
This is the first time I've heard you're in a good mood in a long time
You should be able to show a little bit more often like this, if you enjoy it, get that in a good mood
What does that mean? I was in a good mood today, I was in a great mood yesterday too, I just come back from vacation, what does that mean?
Okay, well I didn't listen to you yesterday, but I'm saying today you're in a good mood, you're putting in a good mood and I just think it's great, I just think it's great
Excellent, I'm going to be happy every minute of every day, how do you like that?
Thanks, thanks, I love the good stuff
Whether software or Alexa or not, have a great day, Palli
Alright, thanks, thanks, okay, bottoms up, so to speak
What does he mean by that I'm in a good mood today, what kind of great mood yesterday, I was rambling on, I was talking about the Rat and the McDonald's and Amsterdam and all the other good stuff
What did that man talk about?
Huh?
He just needs to get in touch with it again
Who should be the dolphin starting quarterback, that's our poll today, I guarantee it, Jay Filer ain't no good mood man
It's kind of like Wally loaned me your glove and Lou Gary, that whole routine again, huh?
And then like 80 million gains later, won't see Wally pip no more
Wasn't that his name?
Or was it Barney pip from WCFL in Chicago?
369 votes, who should be the dolphin starting quarterback, Bob, a Brian, I can't stop doing that man
Freudian, I keep saying Bob and of course, Brian Greasy with 214 votes,
Haney, on up sports, you ask, all 48 are saying that they're getting really agitated, that's 13% as in number 13, once more by Dan Moreno and of course one by Matt's son Dean
I don't give a shmit 46, I hate that offence 32 of us and Jay Filer 29, so if you just get down to the Bob Greasy Jay Filer bonus, 214 to 29
You got those numbers, oh yeah, I'm writing them down and tracking them
Breaking in front of your push, 214 to 211, well I'm serious Greg Cotex and Dan La Bastard and Barry Jackass and all these other so-called sports mavens and they're Dave Joseph, all these other sour push sports people
They got to be tracking this because I see all just about all of them jumping on the Greasy bandwagon, gets a little greasy on that bandwagon when you start sliding down at Greast pool, look out Dave
And by the way, we don't care if they fire a degree or friend at Pompello Park or not, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 at the 18, that thing about Pete Lenny and the Doreen, that is just what?
Shout out to make me lose my appetite for years.
How come when I get any calls from like down right there in a parade? I bet you this might be one. It says, Biscayne Tower, hello.
Neil, yes sir.
Welcome to CREF101 Biscayne Tower.
Hey, what we're trying to do is we're trying to wait for our copy guy but nobody can get in here to fix the copy or because everything's all bogged down.
Hey, I just flipped on channel 4 just in time to hear Barry say that he think that Saint Teresa looked over the Florida Marlins in their World Series quest.
Oh no. Yes. You have to be joking me. Nope. I.
I'm not exactly. I'm not exactly in there side by each with the Pudge pointing to the sky. Who's the guy that's from Dominican Republic?
Donald Trill. Well, whichever one has said that he prays to Saint Teresa and Saint Teresa looked over him and the Marlins.
Oh, sounds like a bunch of going to me. Okay. Good luck to pal. By the way, when Dave Van Boring gets by, take him to the elevator to the roof.
Dave Van Boring will jump off the top of one Biscayne Tower during the height of the festivities this afternoon, whether he wants to or not. He doesn't know it yet.
Just save his hair piece. Okay. Mo needs a spare. Absolutely.
5 6 7 0 5 6 D. Seriously, the fact of a plane was highlights from that one playoff game, especially when they won a game.
I mean, I think Scott would probably agree with me. I do. Pretty, pretty embarrassing. I can't believe that Dave Van Boring got the final call.
Yeah. Well, I mean, just, it's just a matter of luck. We were lucky that booster was doing the 11th inning when Alex Gonzalez won a game with that home run. It was a great call. I heard it.
But the fact that Dave Van Boring got the call in that game, it was just a terminal. That's it. Now we're talking terminals about time somebody else on this radio station at the Cones, the star calling for what he is. He's horrible.
He's boring. Even Jim Sartre started to talk about it. And even little Barry Jackass is starting to make some cost of comments. Been between eating his brown paper or a sack lunches.
Hey, Barry. Hey, mommy. You're not be around forever to drive you to work. Well, he's gonna have to take a cab to work every day. If mommy don't stick around forever. You know what?
No, it's terminal is Macarboard. But that's a different kind of thing. Macarboard just, he's not, he's tragic.
Jorge Posada. Jorge Posada. We hate you Tim Macarboard. We wish you would die. Why couldn't you have the stroke instead of Ralph Kiner, damn it.
Here's a call online nine from Margate, which is that's a little bit dubious, don't you think? Yeah. Here's Margate. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir.
I'm looking at this parade and like one tenth of these people would have showed up for a ballgame or two this year. We might be able to afford to keep you any player. That's right. That's the point.
And also there's there's this flatbed truck with a wide load thing on the back. Pudge Rodriguez is riding on it. They got Pudge's ass on the back right now.
Now the Dan LeBaster right in his Sunday column, the Cubans won the World Series. Yes, he said Alex Gonzalez hit that home run in game five and the Cubans did it again without without the Cubans we couldn't done it.
I think the road from Kiocho leads straight to Joe Rob Stadium. In fact, he said, I'll pour you most on the way through a company on a stets exactly what he said. Have a great day, Pally. We bring up. Okay. Ask the K Hermitas.
Five six seven all jack O's single raising funds for Scientology speaking of religious not citizens of that. Very disturbing. A lot of big name. Well, from Fox News or Campy. All right.
A lot of big names stars are unwittingly about to start raising money for Scientology. Thanks to Michael Jackson. How do you like that? And of course, keep in mind he was a married to Lisa Marie who's a famous Scientologist allegedly married.
At 3 p.m. yesterday, Jackson launched the worldwide Internet download of his charity single. What more can I give for $2 a shot? Jackson fans will be able to hear this record made two years ago, but never released the record features Celine Dion, Mariah Curie, members of Instinct, the Backstreet Boys and others.
But what fans in the two doesn't participate in artists probably don't know is that proceeds from the single download are going in part to Scientology. Jackson is designated the help organization, which uses study techniques developed by Scientology founder, Elron Hubbub is one of the beneficiaries of his large S.
The other charity is Jackson, the part is proceeds to include oneness, Mr. Holland's penis foundation and something called the International Child Art Foundation information about his plans can be found at W.W.W. what a scam this is. The oneness foundation is run by one of Jackson's record producers who also produced the Spanish language heard of a single, which was called,
Appoyemos on the way through his compaiones. Ironically, oneness, a boutique operation was supposed to benefit from the sale of tickets to Neverland last month as was the make a swish foundation need to go to see a dime from the Neverland open house event. Probably they're spinning to pay off all those appearance of those little kids.
Scientology's help, H.E.L.P. as well as one, this Mr. Holland's penis and ICAF were not the resumes when Jackson commenced people like Usher, Luther Van Dross, Tom Petty, Ricky Martin, Gloria Stefan, Beyonce, Nolz and other superstars to participate in this recording two years ago.
I bet you're really pissed off about it. At the time the stars thought they were participating in a fundraising event for the families of the 9-11 tragedy. Are you ready for this? This story is scandalous. Now, however, what more can I give a big collecting money for crosses? Many of the stars didn't intend.
Help, which stands for Hollywood Literacy and Education Program, is a subsidiary of the Church of Week in Scientology. The copyright on the Help website, which Jackson's website is now linking to states, the Hollywood Education and Literacy project is licensed by Applied Scholastics International to use the study technology of Elron Hubbub.
Applied Scholastics is a trademark and service mark owned by the Association of Better Living and Education International and used with its permission.
The Association for Better Living is yet another Scientology offshoot, which according to their website, adhered to the teachings of founder Hubbub, the late science fiction writer.
Referred to as Abel, the Association is an umbrella named for Scientology's different 12-step and learning programs. Jackson, as we all know, was married briefly to Scientologists, Lisa Marie Pressley.
In the late 1990s, we still wondered who fathered those kids. Call to Jackson's company MJJ Productions Produceless, and answering service operators said they were on vacation.
And don't expect them to ever return your call and crap like that.

It's a 1202. I'm having a little lunch to celebrate now since we're having a party time today. Why should I be left out? Why should I be left out? Why should I be left out? Why should I be left out?

Friends, this is just like yesterday. It's like, does he rule all over again? They're enjoying the parade. Oh, there in other words, we're small potatoes now. They can't be bothered with me. Is that what you're trying to say? Okay. Well, I'll just eat my lunch. There are certain things that are good like reheated. And chins is definitely one of them. You know it. Usually within five or six weeks is probably a good time to do it. Well, seriously, there are some things that just aren't like pasta. Pasta gets soggy and rancely and they can't reheated.
But chins is fantastic. Lots of good vegetalizing here. It's a nice white meat chicken. A Roman Catholic priest speaking of that has been suspended as the Cleveland Vise. He investigates an accusation that he sexually abused the child on the late 1980s. This is from the Cleveland Plain Deer or the Plain Brown rapper, just like you're going to be able to pick up that Pope by his career tomorrow. One on one in the pink and one in the stink. Reverend Patrick J. O'Connor, who probably likes it that way too, 45 was placed on leave September 3rd, becoming
the 16th priest suspended and amused allegations. No other cases have been resolved. No other priest has returned to the ministry. They're all kind of like in limbo. They're doing the limbo rock. They're doing the limbo rock. This suspension came after review board determined the allegation was credible and up to move forward said Robert Teyak, the diocesan spokesman, the priest and I. The allegation said is attorney and yada yada. He looks forward to the day he's reinstated. He should hold his breath. The diocese has reported the accusation to
the government authorities. The alleged abuse to the place in late 80s. He was assigned to St Joseph Church in Cai overfalls near Akron, but they released no other details. Well, there you go. I have a couple more to but when it that will spread him out. Okay. We all jammed in there. Sounds like we're piling on just like the audience is piling on the poor J. Feetler. Man, you people are brutal. You really are one thing. Oh, and look at that. J. Feetler just moved ahead of I hate the dog. In the least he's not in last place. Jays make it a comeback. All right. I think all the
congregations are getting together now. Who should be that often starting quarterback Brian Gracie 239 56.9% Hey,
Neil love sports. You as whole 56. I don't give a Schmidt 52. J. Feetler 37 8.8% and I hate that often 36 8.5% out of 420 vote. So J. Just hopped over one category as slowly but surely, you know, just like the
tortoise in a hair. You know how that went. Oh, yeah. That's what he's doing. Who worked?
Francis Oh, here. Here's North Miami Beach. Hello. Hey, no, no. Yes. Hey, I just want to say go Marlins first off. And yeah, what does that mean? Go Marlins? We're like to Washington? No. I'm
a whole. Well, I look, I joined the bandwagon and simply would not be good for you, man. Hop on. Hop on the bandwagon. Doesn't cost a dime. No, well, I mean, it wasn't an excuse to get the
underdrunk because I don't need one for that. But it was, you know, it was being exciting that the whole town got involved. Right. Exactly. And it was fun. Anyways, also I was down in fantasy. That's
this weekend. You were down in a fancy. Yeah. Oh, we already had our limited fangs on the phone today. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the
8. What is he? We got to give me that crap. Okay. That guy's such a fruit cake. So you're a bunch up a little bit. Okay. That's
me before about that expression. That's a flying mattress right there. If you want to definition of a flying mattress, if you
look in the dictionary under today's colloquial expression, you'll see his picture right next to it. Sir, we like you a lot. And
well, maybe not too much, but just don't the bug. We just too chronic and too fruity. You're bad for the rest of us. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the
8. T. Where's the where's the beef baby? Where there's some no beef in here. It's a nice chicken. And some great
rooms. I love it. I think I said this once before. I think I should start my own diet. I think it's pretty good for
it too. Correct me if I'm wrong. Okay. Like like there are snap peas in here. There's nothing like a good
pea, right? But mushrooms, onions, yeah. Little garlic and like some of these other vegetables, like there's a little bit of
broccoli in here like snap peas. This kind of stuff you can eat this forever. Sure. I think I'm not even we want
out the chicken without the beef or the chicken without the meat. And I think you'd be damn healthy. You lose a lot of weight if you need to like me.
And you can be real healthy, you know. Well, I want some meat. No, I like my meat. More of me. But I'm just telling you that I think that because I like mushrooms and onions.
And I could eat shrooms and onions forever. There was some asparagus tips in there. And you're not going to make your pea smell bad. That's okay. Who cares? And I'm going to tell you talk about magic mushrooms in
Amsterdam. I just discovered this last trip several not that I ventured in of course, not me. But I saw several different mushroom joints,
shroom places that I've never seen before. They're all over the place. What kind of shrooms we talking about? Toadstools. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound 5, 60 magic mushrooms.
I'm hallucinogenic. I kept in the days to be in our show on Zeta. You still haven't brought any back for me. Here's for a lot of day. Hello. Hello.
I want to say that Jerry Lewis family with family that live with him in the 70s. And he's nothing but a compassionate guy.
I know that you guys talk about him a lot on the show. Well, who's talking about Jerry Lewis today? What are you talking about?
He's a guy today, but you know, he winds up on the poles and I've heard you guys say a couple things about him. He's a really compassionate guy.
Yeah, I don't like him. Why? I want to know why I don't like him.
That's why you're calling to find out why I don't like him. Exactly. Because I've never heard any reasons that you don't like him.
I can't really put my finger on. I just don't like him. I can't stand him. I used to like him when he was younger and doing his comedy thing with Dean Martin.
I thought he was funny, but he's become a pain in his. His teleph on the whole thing. He just, it's snacks of something. I don't know. I just don't like him.
I admit that's the teleph on the whole thing. Plus, plus, you know, when it goes to your head like that, then you can tell it's just, you know what I'm saying, George?
Is that a joke about the medication he's taking? No, it's not a joke. See the new dolphin quarterback. He's the new dolphin quarterback, Jerry Lewis.
He's got a swell head over it already. What kind of a call was that? I have no idea. I mean, are we talking about Jerry Lewis today?
Oh, we got to parade the Marlins won the World Series. We got the big controversy with the dolphins in quarterback.
Even though it's a sports thing and we don't care about it on a show, but we put it on there. This is controversial.
And we get calls about Jerry Lewis, you know, I say screw Jerry Lewis. How do you like that, sir?
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. We have almost nothing going on this board. We got three calls on there.
I'm going to tell you people this town. This is by far and away. This show has got so many more people listening right now than all the other stations combined in the whole market.
Well, I had to hang up on everybody else because they want to talk about Jerry Lewis.
What are you talking about?
There's only three calls. Do you have any idea what he just said? No, no. You did a week's worth of shows with this guy alone.
I told him not to talk. Oh, maybe that's why we're so good. 5 6 7. Let's hear from some parade people.
I think ticker tape parade in downtown. I know that's right. They're listening to the QBA.
They're listening to radio. A ritmo. They're listening to no piquet a English. That's what they're all listening to down there in Dave County.
And they're listening to apoyemos on the way through a copy on this. All the politicians are down there jumping on the bandwagon, glanned handing it out a whole bunch of bulk. They all do it.
They're all just talking about the radio. They're all just talking about the radio. They're all just talking about the radio.
What's the time, Brady? Well, if he's available, unfortunately, New England's got a good thing going with him. Yeah, he's stuck on Sunday.
Let me tell you that. He's still looking. He's got more potential, I think, than either all three of our quarterback.
Oh, I'm going to go with that. He's got a lot of potential. Yeah. And I'm on the modeling thing. I want to know all these sport riders and all these supposed fans right in about all these fans are bandwagon jokers, which I freely admit that I am. That's correct.
But they prefer that 10 to 15,000 people showed up for the playoffs in the World Series. That's a good point. Yeah, I mean, that's all they keep wanting and quick, friggin' wine in already.
Let's have one or two days with happy people, your corrector. Let's jump on that bad wagon and get started.
The last thing, read John DeFeedy's article in the arrow today. It's just what you're talking about. About all the politicians jumping on the modeling bandwagon. It's a great article. How about Jim DeFeedy?
Yeah, that's a big guy. That big fat turban. Okay, thanks a lot, Colley. Have a good day, man. Have a great day. See, there's a happy guy. Oh, he made my day. There's a guy. It's in a good mood. He says, at least we fill the place when it counted the most when the crap was on the line.
He said, I'm going to waste those compaiones. And now what he said? What's not to like? That's right. What's not to like is a great philosopher. And old Jew Fag 1 said, what's not to like? And you know what?
Absolutely correct. He had a thumb right on it. Instead of everybody's always looking for the negative in that town. Everybody's always trying to find something freaking negative. Of course, that's true.
Anywhere, especially with sports nerds, you know, season started here at three, four games. The least play like crap. Oh, let's fire Pat Quinn. Let's fire big fat Pat Quinn. You know, I like big fat Pat Quinn. I can't coach with a crap. But I just like him. And I like big fat guys.
Makes me feel better about myself. 12 minutes past noon at 560 WQM. We got 438 votes on that poll, man. It's going to be by the time I sit my ass down here 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
We're going to have a guarantee about 1500 vote. You think? Well, it shows only it's only been on there two hours.
Now we're leaving this poll on there because I think this is more important.
How much? What is what number is he wearing? 12? Scott Scott. Yes. What number is Brian greasy wearing? I don't know. I didn't watch the game. Oh, that's right. You didn't watch the game. Well, I'd like to know because 12 was daddy's number.
Both of you were 13. Excellent job. Scott. Very, very good. Very good. 443 votes. Who should be the Dolphin starting quarterback? Brian greasy 250.
56.4% hanging a lot of sports you asshole 59. I don't give a Schmidt 57. J. Feetler 38. 39 8.8% and I hate that offense 38 out of 443.
So J is making a little bit of progress. Like I said, like the tortoise in the here just very steadily, very slowly. He might surprise you. I don't think so though. No. No.

And I believe you should. I'm sorry. I see you have a problem with women. I don't have a problem with women. I like to touch them.
Excuse me, but we are not an object. May I see your anida? My what? Your anida. May I see it? I don't think I have an anida.

Hurry, dad. Hurry. The Marlins parade is starting. Okay, son. Don't worry. Climb up on my shoulders so you can get a good look. Here they come. Wow. It's Miguel Cabrera. Sorry, son. That's why me did mayor Alex Penelope.
I think of a can you mayor Alex who Alex Penelope. He's the mayor for the whole county. You know that Miami Heat gave me went to last year. Yeah. This he played for the heat. Maybe. And it goes on here. This is not worth reading. So thanks to the guy who called but Jim DeFeedy is the only the only good article Jim DeFeedy ever wrote was when he said the hero used to be good, but now we suck because we can't afford to be good anymore.
That was the only meaningful thing he ever wrote. Remember that one. Sure. That was pretty embarrassing. At least it was honest, but he said we suck. We don't have the money anymore. We don't have the staff.
It used to be a great newspaper. That's about a hundred years ago. And now we're a laughing stock and a joke. And I'm still working around the payroll. So I'll take the cash. Kind of like the way we feel about QAM.
462 votes. What who should be the dolphin starting quarterback Ryan greasy 261 J. Fielder 42. I'll dispense with the other categories for right now. 261 to 42. You got those numbers in your head.

At the same time, wouldn't surprise me or you smother his man here after your ass. Well, you must be psychic because George has been trying to get a hold of you. And you probably ought to hang on and he'll get you number. Okay. Okay. I. I was trying to call you the other day, but I guess. I mean, I could not get through. Well, you know, it is on a show. Yeah. But I even I mean, everything. All right. I'm doing great. I'm hearing Toronto. I'm happy as a pig in stink and everything is sensational. So you know, no one. No one on the Sunday. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

Say you said that everything working. All right. Everything is sensational, but George needs your assistance. So hang on. I'm glad to hear. You're okay. All right. Thank you. There's a good satellite guy. Mohammed. Get his number for George. And let's say I want to show. Okay. 5 6 7 0 5 60 Bill who doesn't hate George in Fort Lauderdale says.
If you heard about Peter crashing the Fort Lauderdale celebration today, they're apparently pissed off about Beckett's locker room interview as he was accepting the MVP award. When questioned about what he would do during the off season, he mentioned something about doing more hunting. Oh, no. Is this for real? You think? No. It's just a joke. I would. It says when questioned about what he would do. He said he would do more hunting. I guess now. Peter wants to make some kind of a statement. Why can't these. Peta. Maybe it's just fall off a cliff somewhere. Good point, Bill. They suck. We're so tired of you. Peta. Idiots. And speaking of animals and people are
really love animals like us realistically. How can we don't have any new number on the best of the year about our band and pet rescue? We have no just nothing at all. Once again, here's another excuse to just kind of like fall by the wayside because Doreen's got Miguel all tied up in in a corner. I'm sure he's off somewhere doing some promotional thing down at the parade or something. Right. Exactly. Give it away to his t shirts and all the certain crap. Oh, here's the thing. I thought I Schmidt candidates. I wish I would have. Look for the Marlon's QA and prize patrol at the Marlon parade in Miami, which is going on. Is that one still going on?
No, I don't know. I don't know. We'll have those QA in clappers. Oh, and special QM Florida Marlon's World Series t shirts. We got a crampload of those. See we have nothing to promote the people on the air, but Florida Marlon's World Series jump out of the bag and t shirts. We got thousands. 30,000 of those. QM also be broadcasting live to the 7th and the 7th afternoon. The big and Kim Bo camper would loss all this riverfront for the Marlon's boat parade along the river. They're both going to be there. And if you want to log on to QM.com and look for the Florida Marlon.
Marlon's World Series wallpaper downloaded to the desktop of your computer. And you can wallpaper your whole room, your house, your building, your, uh,
breakfast with Marlon's wallpaper and be a real bad wagon for running for any wish we love in South Florida. It's our speciality.
Here's a call from Carl Springs. Hello. And a maple leaf truck. Now good. We know that already. Give us something like a bulletin. OK.
And maple leaf. Another positive voice from South Florida. Another sour, miserable, negative ass hole. OK. Thanks for just showing it to the whole world. Do something about those pimples by the way. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Probably a rangers fan. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello. I knew how you doing. OK, sir. Um, I was wondering. I get to live on an off again. And I heard your mentions. Uh,
a toy strafford. Is that the same guy that played for the dolphins? Yeah. Oh, OK. And he works for WQA him. Yeah, he's a sales hole. Oh, well, so he didn't make it in broadcast. And I didn't even try it. What?
Yeah, that's a good point. He's the only one who didn't become a broadcaster. Thank God. OK, well, I mean, he was, he was one of my favorite players. I was really well. I'll be sure and pass that along. I'll roll like your rubbers ball. OK. He's the Buddha of the QM sales department.
5 6 7 0 5 60 boy, these people whipped up to a frenzy or what? Huh? We love that. We'll see all the people that are whipped up in a frenzy.
They're at the parade and they're over the boat parade. They're all down and we did little kids and they're screwing off from working from school.
You know, like they really cared like the guy who called me for said, you know, where the hell were they?
Where they were? They were like tickets for sale. I'm not talking about the playoffs in the world.
I'm talking about the rest of the time. Where the hell were they? You know what they were doing? They were making excuses. Right.
That's what they were doing. The stadium isn't next to my house. It might rain like for 20 minutes this afternoon.
There's a cloud in the sky. The pigeon just dropped a big one and it might hit me on the head. And the pocket is too expensive and yada yada yada.
And I'm afraid that if I get attached to the team, they're going to break up the team next year. So I don't want to get emotionally involved.
What they won't, don't want to do is pay for nothing. That's what it boils down to. Okay.
The cheapest bunch of people on a face of it. Not the French Canadians. They're in a running. Not the Anglo-Canadians believe me.
They're plenty of cheap bastards here. Right. Rimmer. But the fact of the matter is South Florida, the cheapest of the cheap.
Not the old Jews. They're like almost benevolent. Even the ones that are shoveling the sweet and low in the silverware in the sack.
They're like sandy claws by comparison to just your average one of the mills south over to you cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, tight, tight, tight.
But boy, when it comes to be bandwagon jumping time, they got money up the ass. They're just reaching in there and pull out 50s and hundreds like you never saw.
Oh, by the way, I got a new 20. Yeah. American 20. The American 20. The gay ones. The pink ones. Yeah. They already. Can you imagine once they'll president they discover is that the $20 bills are pink?
How about to go nuclear? I'll be damned. They'll probably be dropping some Lincoln log. I don't have a penis.
Azia's one fox and a flower. They should take one. Hello sports fans. I'm Azia's one. The Prince of fucking football. This year looks like it's going to be exciting in the NFL.
One team to definitely watch out for are the Green Bay Packers.

That's all that's on the cue card now. What do you want me to do about that? Just wrap it up, Azia.
Let's all put this week. I'm Azia Osmo. The Prince of fucking football.
Rolls-Davis is supposed to move for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise. Pull the AP that officials there took note of the warning, but didn't see a need to act on it further.

It's at the point of all three or four people setting wildfires using time devices in Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming that would detonate enforced in Granschlands after the operatives had left the country.

Goes to show you even Bill Clinton had some real little ringers in here. Hi, he had the some real losers. Donna Shalaley was one of them. Yeah. We've got balls. That's disgusting. That the university Miami doesn't want to be associated with that.
Because of course they have no balls. We all know that. That's why they played little girls teams almost every week. So they can win like 83 to 6 and 142 to 3 things like that. Because they have no real balls. It's a pussy school.
500 votes even. Let's hear it. That's only a little after 1230. We already got 500 votes on the big quarterback controversy.
It's about time. Look at this. We got even though it's all sports related. Of course that's right up our alley on QA and. Sure.

OK. All right. I think about OK. Thanks, pal. Let's put Dan Marino on it. Not. Now we don't want to do that. It'll screw it all up. It'll throw everything out of kilter. Right? Right.

You know, the calls on this radio station and the sports. I mean, ours look less face that we know our calls are pretty lame, but the calls on the sports shows are just so it's like that.
Aren't we blessed down here, Jay? Aren't we blessed here?
And this is an adult. This wasn't some kid, some punk who has collected baseball cards and used jobstrap. This was an adult.
It's supposedly macho male. We blessed down here, Jim. After you know, we're in a couple of football games. And then like the week or two later, both teams took it up the ass.
So it goes to show you blessed one week and cursed, cursed the next. Isn't that what father's stool says? A curse. That's right. And don't forget. I put a most loud in the way.
Just a lot of what do you want to do?
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Doesn't it? Yeah, drags. Now we're not doing sports talk. We're doing community involvement here.
Oh, you know, I saw the people come from the parade. Yeah.
And by the way, they'll get the same service, the same treatment that boo got quick to all tone. That was you've ever met. That was one of the great lines in history. Poor boo.
Desperate. I bailed them out though. Hey, boo. You owe me, man. Big time. You owe me because I bailed his ass out. You know, he didn't have anything to talk to us about. He could barely hear anything.
And it was everybody screaming and yelling and getting plastered. What do you got for me, Neil? What do I have for you? Oh, that was beautiful. Nice going, boo. You're the best baby. Don't take that. Well, actually, my best advice would be take the job of the meds. Okay.
Because you'll always be second fiddle with a marlins. If the marlins were smart, they'd make him the top banana right now. The top dog, the Chiquita banana and they tell Dave what's his name? Dave Van Boring. Go back to Montreal. They get his boring ass out of town. He is pathetic.
Even even when he has sex with his beautiful wife, which everybody says she's really hot. You know what that magical moment comes here like that. That's about as much.
I don't think he has any of that man can work up. 20 miles of freighter gets to her side of the piece flops off. Squirt. Squirt.
They read my dog mail and stood there with that hand held out. They held his loud as they could trick or treat.
They'll walk for miles and miles till they fill up all their bags. Then they'll go home and ride out their teeth. On his Halloween nights with those Halloween kids.
The test ends on right. Take it all that you give. And they'll give you a fright. With their bitch scary wings. Getting candy all night. Then they'll eat it like beans.
As soon as it's done, they show up and they keep coming on and on. For hours later you'll find it alone. You end up with three bags of candy you couldn't give away.
Next year you'll pretend there's nobody home. On those Halloween nights. Get it out some kids cats. Do those ghosts just get wet. They give all of them fat. On those Halloween nights with those Halloween grants. If you turn up your lights.
Then some ass will go flat. On his Halloween nights. On the 26th at 560 WQAM. FCC gives Bono a pass on cursing at the awards. When it comes to cursing the government says it's all a need delivery. That's the view of the FCC and its decision that you two singer Bono's cut off a language during the Golden Globe Awards did not violate federal indecency rules.
The FCC rejected complaints from the parents television council more than 200 people, most of them associated with the council, who accused dozens of TV stations of violating restrictions out of scene broadcasts by hearing portions of the awards program last January. The complaints objected to Bono's uttering the phrase, this is really, really effing brilliant.
The FCC using the F word more often to explain the decision than Bono did on the air so the word may be crude and offensive but in the context presented here did not describe sexual or extracurricular organs or activities. That distinction is a key test to measure whether a statement meets a federal standard for broadcast indecency.
David Solomon, Oye! Chief of the FCC's enforcement bureau, said on the ruling that Bono used the vulgarity as an adjective or to emphasize an exclamation and that the use of specific words including expletives or other four letter words did not render does not render material obscene.
The parents television council a Los Angeles-based watchdog group said today would appeal for the decision and that the FCC is splitting hairs.
It's not shocking to us on the FCC decision because the rate toothless line said Laura Mahanne, director of corporate and entertainment affairs for the council, they don't take indecency seriously and that's why you see proliferating on the broadcast airways. She said within those way up in the year. The FCC rejected the complaints on Friday and after the decision this week.
We have previously found that fleeting and isolated remarks of this nature do not warrant commission action, Solomon said. How do you like that?
All right. A rare decision for free speech. Very rare especially in America. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Who should the dolphins that started quarterback B is our poll question on the Arrogers.com 528 vote.

We've got to trap on. I get one. Let you know that she's probably got a big one. Thanks. Probably a Gator fan there. High and more power to them. Okay. All that. All that childish crap in Florida. Oh, I'm a Gator fan. I'm a No. We'll span. I'm a can't spend you. Well, my comment is all of them people would grow up.
That's my comment. Yeah. In George said who the F carries what we don't want to say the whole word like a bottle because we don't get the same consideration.
No, we won't that Solomon guy. Okay. We're not Irish. No, is that it neither is he 5 6705 60 pound 560. We're just Jones and he hear from somebody.
Exceited that big ticker tape parade. And of course go for you at one o'clock. One o'clock starts the other parade.
Of course, that's like in another language. Well, it's in Dave County. So it speaks for it. Spice for itself.
One PM till 230 is the motorcade style parade all the way through.
I Ocho and a 20 block route and they're going to be throwing like stale quiet bears out on the streets.
Once worn by a Che Guevara. And if you were speaking of stale a few old media no chase from last.
A Cinco de Mayo. Some of the beaners left behind. I was speaking of Boehner boy.
Here's a call from a beautiful Miami. Where is Diaz?
Where their radio turned up. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. What do you think about these more?
This baby they're doing it, baby. They did it and have a nice day. See they got nothing to say. What do you think about these more?
I think it was exciting. It was interesting and a lot of phonies and I think I'm what am I going to say?
Am I going to sit here and like start squeezing myself over it? No. No, they're all ugly anyway.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. They're just absolutely as dead as a door nail. Same yesterday.
Very lively on this end of the deal here. Spectre. Right. On this end of the full spectre. Oh, by the way, he shot her. Yes, he did. I already had I discussed that.
But the fact of the matter is that the town in spite of this temporary blip. It's like a blip on the radar screen of life. That's all it is.
You know, take a tape parade. We already went through this in 97 plus they also threw in the 80,000 people at P.P. Park that night.
You know, but this time they said, nah, that's enough. This is three events is enough for the politicians to go out there and grandstand. That's it.
People might actually have a good time at the stadium. But I think it's really poignant to see that all the people that were like excoriating David Samson and Delilah and Jeffrey Luria just a few months ago, including most of the sport holes on this radio station.
Who were just carving them and ass every chance they could get. I don't want to mention no name. Absolutely right. But now, oh, this is the most wonderful thing and what a great young bunch of talent and what a gutsy performance and a syndrome of the team of destiny.
But every cliche that ever came down the cake. Man, it's unbelievable. And don't forget. I'll put aamos. I'm on what is it? What is it?
Miami again, Buenos Aires. Hard days to you. How's it going? Okay, sir. It's official. We live in Cuba. The beginning of that whole parade was all in Spanish. And all it was was politicians showboding. I love my hands. That's all we heard. It was all in Spanish.
Every other word, except when they brought up a gringo. They brought up on American Banana Republic, baby. Only in Miami. That's right. So if you want to go to the American version of the print, I got to go to the brown. Okay, see on the.
I'm going to put that in here. See on the river. Okay. Latina's only Solamente Latinos. Solamente los cubanos bravos. 5 6 7 0 5. Both of them. 5 6 7 0. Will you shut up? I'll write them. Try to give the numbers out. What are you fadling about? Nothing. What are you trying to tell me? Your Spanish is better than you let it on. What do you mean by that? That you speak it good. Oh, I can read it. Yeah, just like that. I'll pay most. So if I have it in front of me, I can read just like Italian on that. I can. I don't know. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it. I can read it.
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. I know like a couple of words here and there. But that doesn't mean that my Spanish is good because I can read it. Oh, you speak it real good. I speak it pretty good. Well, why don't you? Why don't you? I don't know what you speak to my time. It maybe rubs off. Apparently. Oh, yeah. Man, oh, man. You talk about them. Julio's man. You talk about a horny bunch of Catholics. Wow. They're rubbing more than their rosary beads and their crucifix. I'll tell you that right now. The fix is in. Oh, speaking of that. P. Did he accuse the views in sweatshop labor?
Oh, and how about puffed dog on passions? Well, I'm sure glad that I'm back in North America. So I can actually get in touch with fact the people there haven't even seen passions yet. How do you like that? Huh? I could spoil us for everybody and tell me that today on passions. What's his name? Luis would finally show up at the house and Charlie is trying to like jump into the house and get knocked down with a hatchet and a cop show up and Luis shows up and she high tails it and they truck again. Jaylen was pick up truck. What? Now you ruined it for me. Oh.
Well, nothing really exciting happens. And of course, so what's your name got shot with me and on the plane Liz is plotting to break up what's your name again? Eve? Even here T.C. who's have another one of his temper tantrums. And there's poor what's your name? Parisa who's still in a guy named hospital. She won't get that out of there. Sean John, the clothing line of rap music, mogul Sean P. Diddy Combs is underscrupely from a worker rights group for allegedly using laborers from a Honduran sweatshop. How do you like that? Hmm? You know who that was?
Reminds me of. You know miserable nasty people that we hate like poison. And I'm trying to think of what the name of the water. Yeah, they are the kids. That was the name. Pretty good. There is a child living down in Mexico who has to go to work every day. There's that bitch and cover making clothes for Kathy. That smelly, it's coming. That's the work.
But does love the pain. They are the kids who make the core thing. They are the ones who make a bucket of days. A quick complaining. It's just cause me again. The kind you love to buy is true to make a bucket of day with Kathy Lee.
The director of the anti-swet shop National Labor Committee Charles Kurnahan planned to release a report today detailing poor working conditions at the southeast textiles factory in Choloma Honduras where Sean John clothes are made.
John John sounds like a Chinese outfit on a chun John or Haitian. I just had chinks for lunch workers. They are subjected to daily body search at Sean John foundation. You better learn your Haitian mind. You're a pet. Your pet. Toa blows. Workers. They are subjected to daily body searches contaminated drinking water.
They are 11 to 12 day hour daily shifts. In exchange they paid 24 cents for each $50 Sean John sweatshirt they sow. And this is P Diddy Coombs. This is a hit business. Okay. What I tell you P Diddy sucks baby.
Boy it's the one to two hour.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.

You can't sing a leg nor can I god make.
I wish I had a gun.
One of these days you might write your own song.
And then mine you won't steal.
It's not much though.
Cup dog or past daddy at the book question 101 or a Brian Greasey or J. Feeler.

No, maybe we'll do that tomorrow instead of the one I was gonna do because that other one can we can do anytime
But I'm thinking that this is something somebody ought to say something about especially since our governor's decided to be the minister of the state rather than be the governor
He's the freaking minister. Oh, we got Terry's law Terry's law
I know you sympathize with the family and not with the husband, but you're full of crap all right
I'm telling you right now
There is no point in the governor interceding here. He's got no freaking business
Staying his nose in there and jamming a law through their stories that right is this bull crap about forcing people to stay alive
You know, right? That's what her wish is she wanted to die
This was her wish. No, what that's what we don't know. Well, that's what he says
You know what I frankly she ain't making it she ain't gonna come back anytime soon. You catch my drift so he should just walk away
Why is that what do you mean walk away? He's got his money. He's got his new girlfriend. He's got a new baby with her
Yeah, let let the family have the vegetable let her water her and how much broccoli
Okay, you know what I had spinach are grouting at the Ruth Chris last night had a great meal at Ruth Chris steakhouse here in Toronto

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line all you beeners out there have a good time at the parade today
Are the beeners for reading where here's a lady in Southwest launches. Hello?
Yes, hi, I'd like to make a comment about the ridiculous
Celebration that was just had at Bayfront Park for my head go ahead. Yeah, I think it is
Politicians of Miami should be ultimately embarrassed of the fact that they took up over half of the time
Which should have been really focused on the Marlins actually celebrating and not talking about politics for Miami
Yeah, and I think it just shows that you know
Miami unfortunately, you know the
Hispanic influence and politics has ruined the city only in the Atlanta Republic
Baby only in Miami
Yeah, okay only in Miami because we wouldn't be seeing this if it would have happened in New York Chicago
You know LA we wouldn't be hearing
Politicians talk for half an hour before the Marlins actually get up there and you know are able to
Politicians where it sees that they would seize the moment someplace else
But they would get up there for 30 seconds and you know
Have a little and be a little bit gracious and do the right thing
But not in Miami because in Miami they can get away with it because they're blatant and flagrant
They're dealing with a bunch of bozos. Yeah, it's disgusting. I mean I I'm Hispanic and I'm proud to be Hispanic
But let me tell you today. I'm embarrassed
I'm ultimately embarrassed and and it's disgusting the display of of politics that was shown there and it was evident in the
faces of the players that it was such a discussed in
Celebrity in a bad taste of celebrating the Marlins. They deserve better than that
They really do and the politicians of Miami should be embarrassed that was a disgusting display of politics and we didn't need it now
We're here to celebrate the Marlins victory and through the politicians in the world series home to South Florida and
Instead the politicians have to get up there and preach their little preach and it's just a
Disgusting display of politics and unfortunately only in Miami. Amen. Well said
Thank you hanging in the sweetheart. Bye-bye. That was good. That was a good little speech, you know it yes
Coming from a spick at herself and she says she's probably a spick at but she's embarrassed by the display by Mayor
Ping up a canya and Mayor Diaz and all of those other professional space getting up there
Postering pandering betting over backward hopping on each of his ass all the same aircraft and it does making difference
Whether it's Mayor Carrillo or Mayor Diaz or any other whatever the hell they are, you know anybody
I think they need a vowel movement is what the problem is
We need a lot more politicians whose names don't end in Z
Like oh oh yeah like Carrillo
That's okay listen. We've had plenty of crux to go around we had Jew crux that we had very what what I'd the guy
That left it disappeared what that was Joe
Gerstin Joe Gerstin right and we had very shriver and we had Larry my good friend Larry Smith
What kind of a Jewish name is that Larry well?
He probably changed it Larry Smith. We had Jews and we had farces. We had Johnny Jones with I mean you name it
You can't complain about the honest politicians in South Florida because quite frankly we haven't found one yet
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T that she's got a great point
This ain't supposed to be a political rally
It's supposed to be a thing to an honor to the team in the organization and Jack McKeen and all those people who did the the stuff their thing
Mayor Pink up a can you he didn't throw any pitches. He didn't get any goddamn hits
Same with Mayor Diaz, man. I wonder if his kid is still prayer putting them pink 20s
Here's
Oh, go get some here's a call from Fort Pierce. Hello
Yes, sir, let me get my log guy. It's amazing. I want to talk to you about go right ahead. Did you see?
Chan Lowe's cartoon today and the son on this gun fentanyl no
Picture of a guy with driving like a van with Marlon's world champions on it and
1800 flags on the on the car and he's filling up at a gas station and the caption read
He's talking to the guest of gas station at the end. He says hey, you know what? I've been a Marlon's fans in August
Perfect and by the way that guy the guy is dead the announcer van horn. Oh my god
Did you hear the call when they won? Did you hear that? Yeah, we're playing it. We're playing a promo
You think that they would erase it that they be embarrassed that anybody might hear it again and we're playing it
You know what that guy I mean you almost wish for for Joe the gackie
They would go that right exactly. Oh, and lastly the
Did you catch Steve Shapiro's Lugi when he was up in Chicago? No?
He gets on TV and this is after I can't remember which game it was after but they had a close up public from the chest up
This guy has a Lugi the size of Montana hanging off his nose. Oh right
Excellent
Which actually he did a great job. You actually noticed is it any backs away?
Yeah, like you didn't really see that you just thought you saw
Turn around and psyched the mother guy and then he missed it up his nose or disappear
It was an unbelievable move. He pulled a man to lower
Anyway, and in the last and the last thing really is that GW and Asia
Have you seen a stupider this guy has no clue?
Everybody in Asia is telling us that the whole world is scared
Crapless yeah, they were like poison in his responses. Yeah, I can't believe that we don't like us here
Have a great day, pali
Good luck to us
Yeah, Joe's the gackie is a great black and bring us here
I don't know the guy I've never met they've been boring
He may be a very nice guy and his wife may be hot as blazes and he may have a really nasty looking toupee
But the fact of the matter is he just can't get excited and
How he has gotten off in a town that's generally pretty critical of anything and everybody how he's gotten off
But such a free pass beat especially on this radio station beats the crap out of me. He's terminal terminal coma inducing
And a few people but he organization had any sense you'd get together with Booge
And you'd sit down and you make him a deal for like 10 years and you'd make him like the lead announcer
And if you want to keep van boring around like clean the turlits or you know do something like that fine
But not to be broadcast in the game. He's just he's pathetic. He's got a good voice. He just don't have any idea how to use it
You following all this no what good we said he sucks you'd agree with that see agree with that with anybody
You don't even know what we're talking about hope
569 votes look at that what a sweet total 569 who should be that often starting quarterback

They're in tapping it out when a doubt tap one out or just squeeze one out and get your vote on there because this is a
Highly important stuff
I'm sure that they've wants that in the entire staff are sitting there just pondering over this support
Don't you think oh yeah ponderous I'm pondering that is ponderous you're right because they suck

All they show was two places. There was only like 200 yegos out there running around with Bob and I
You know the interesting thing is because all the big talk is now that they want to build in the city of Miami
They're gonna build a new stadium in Miami

Then you'll really see how all these lies all this funny baloney over the years about wow

We're speaking of crumbling under the pressure
Miriam elephant vogue yesterday to fight any effort to remove her is browed county's election supervisor
Flitely rejecting last week's assessment by the secretary of state that her office is in shambles and unprepared to handle upcoming elections
All elephants said she would not resign for this is one militant. You know it
God she reminds me like a like a clone of that bitch that we used to work with at Paxen i.o.d
Remember that I'm sure you do
She maintained that her recent purge of key office staff and the turmoil of the past year have not harmed the heredinus for next week's
Local mail-in votes in the 2004 presidential election cycle. Oh my goodness. We're gonna have her for the presidential election again. Oh, no
I haven't violated any laws or procurement policies or procedures any ethics standards elephant said
I fulfilled my responsibilities. I'm here to run elections
And that's what I'm doing. We're in compliance for having elections
Which is why so many people all over Brought to get in like a whole bunch of extra ballots in a mail just in case they want to vote multiple times
Secretary estate Glenda Hood floater stop election official charge last week that elephant had exhibited an
Allowing pattern of iris not just a regular pattern
But an allowing pattern of irisponsibility that could warrant her removal from office to which I say oh, yes
Hood gave elephant till november 10 to meet dozens of recommendations made by state task force
That hoods into investigate Broward's erection system
Blancing over the highly critical task force report for the first time yesterday afternoon elephant said that much of the criticism was unmovanted
Seizing on a small section of the report that said the county should give her more warehouse space
Elephant charged that that would be the reason for any problem with next year's elections
For warehouse managers said he must prepare 1500 touchscreen voting machines for use in January special election for state house
Citric 91 and city elections in February but has space for only 400
County officials who have been planning to give elephant more warehouse space had yesterday
They're confident they can find temporary quarters for use during that time
quarters half dollars
Maybe those new pink 20s
Elephant also was attacked the counties purchase of touchscreen voting machinery as part of the cost for election misuse
But the state association election administrators came out yesterday in staunch defense of the new technology
In other words the new machines didn't set our all those illegal ballots
Oh
Anyway, it just goes on and on a course of the governor the jebstor he's between the lock in a hard place now
He's too busy with Terry's law. He don't have time to stuff like this
But he wants to get her ass out of there the only problem is there are a lot of folks who are dark
Complexivists say don't be doing that first. They're not gonna vote for him anyway. So what does he care?
Plus he can't run again anyway, can he?
Then don't we have a two-term limit in Florida?
For governor that's a good question. I don't even know we do
I think we do somebody who knows will tell me but I really think you can't be governor more than two
consecutive term. Well, he's got other things in mind, you know. Oh, yeah bigger

This heavy duty crap whatever it is. It's going on this I think this
Are coyote festival cleansing right at the cleansing
Here's Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir
First of all apologies for my fellow countryman earlier
It's obviously the world series because I do have the best players in the world playing here
I just have to provide and apparently they they were supposed to do
Little Havana in the convertibles which they had to cancel because long behold the streets were out of control
What do you mean by that? Well, apparently that they couldn't control the street
So there's no way they could do it in the convertibles so they're doing it in the trolley now
We can they bring the Pope in man they start schlepping him around
And have a good day
five six seven oh five yet another brick that called before that silly crap
You know any Brithett starts talking about other people sports man you are really a clown
That guy that called earlier. Why do they call it the world series?
I think I had too much spotted dick that was his problem. Oh, it's no capertoss too much toad in a hole
Yeah, would it rug be in there?
There's squash and they're oh one of all those and that cricket
Oh, it's it's test cricket and he's got a wicket and he's gonna stick it and
Holy Toledo man
And you know I got attended this you'd be dismayed especially somebody who reviles the whole sport and
Shot at the way like sky news they must take out of the hour newscast if you take out about like 12 minutes for spots
So that's 40 minutes they must take like about 15 minutes of that with our silly sports cram
And if one of the soccer players heaven forbid signs would like some other team like one of the Italian teams are
I mean they carry on like like the Queen just had a
Hemorrhoid pop they have a nervous breakdown
I would think even more so than the stuff with all those ruff see the stuff with the royals
That's just like filler even though they make a big deal of it. It's like filler material, you know
Until the next sports scandal hits
Five six seven and by the way, do you think that princess Anne has ever had a bowel movement like in the last 30 years?
No, I don't think so you ever see that bitch. Oh fossilized. He's got that nasty constipated look in fact the the whole royal family those
Batonbergs they look a lot like some of my mother's sisters family
But five six seven oh five six you they do they look like the Rosen's of Rochester. That's the a Batonbergs
Arm sorry the House of Windsor. They're the Batonbergs. They're a bunch of Germans. Okay. It's what they are
They're not fooling anybody and at Prince Philip man. I guarantee he boosts it make no mistake about him
Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello. Hey, I don't know my good for a lot of Dale. I'm sure in here my whole life
Um, refugees Marlon fans, you know, they're all good and bandy, but what they're showing on the news especially in the TV is
They're projecting the whole Hispanic population as the only fans of the Florida Marlins. Yes, they do play in I guess pro player in
A.M. technically, but that is just a reflection upon the media that is purely Hispanic
That is I guess taken away from yeah, I don't want to sound soundfries just I hate everybody
But it's just to the point where the Anglo-American
African-American
One nothing to do with these
Fans or the Marlins because they cater to the Hispanic and I understand Miami's nothing but Hispanic
Which is all fine and dandy but what's up?
Fans and Proud
Yeah, let me just say this to you if the least and may police ever want to stand a cup again which I doubt in my lifetime
There would be no ethnic celebration in Toronto
You know, I'm saying other words it would be the entire community the entire city everybody be out there in the streets
It'll be a big parade it would have nothing to do with ethnicity
Even though this is a much more ethnically diverse city than the South Florida will ever dream of being and the same is true in any other city
If the Yankees would have won a World Series instead you would have had gigantic parades, uh, you know down
Up and down Manhattan and it would have had nothing to do with ethnicity would have been everybody in the city would have been participating
Yeah, what's this then if anything um it's our migraps more because they're not reflecting the entire population
I haven't seen one report other than the boat parade in Fort Laudell for maybe even Boca
Maybe Western suburbs but they are projecting they're dividing the line now the question's doing that
But I guess they don't seem to m- and you know that's the bridge that the media the public relations
Public relations of other marlins want to cater to they're doing a good job by dividing the community and saying
Yeah, but don't forget the marlins are the ones who are controlling. I don't want to defend them
But they're not the ones controlling the media and the politicians. That's uh, that's business as usual
No, you are actually right. I say to be quick on it, but um the media you know, I'm not looking for a scapegoat
But I for some reason I'm sure there's a lot of other people out there to feel the same way
Especially if you're in Browne, Palm Beach County that feel very isolated that that's the Miami's little Havana theme and
Here we are and you know, it's just a sour taste
And yes, I've gone to only a couple games and that doesn't can be a right too much complaint
But you know as a resident of Florida my whole life and a fan of the marlins and their films often it's just it's very
Aggravating and yet put us more of it back into a shell and
Maybe one good thing in mind though that'll assume your conscience and that is you won't be paying any taxes with new stadium
It'll be all in date
Okay, well thank you. Thank you time. You know, thanks
153 a little sour note is usual in South Florida because there's always that device and it's fueled by the media
Just like Dan La Bastille. Oh the Cuban's one-of-world series. No, this uh, you know
We're hearing that from several people at this evidently the date County part of it is a Hispanic celebration
And of course George says I still don't care
