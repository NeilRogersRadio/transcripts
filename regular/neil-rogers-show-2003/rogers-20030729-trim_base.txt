Joe Rose
Mad dog is a scratch and Joe Rose is gonna have to fill in oh, right. Oh my god

Now what was I just saying before you interrupted something very important? Marlon. Yeah, no about about
Pharrell I got to bust his balls on Thursday because you know all this Marlon hype and the fact of the matter is there's seven
What is it seven or eight games over now? Beena boy. I think they're eight
I thought it was seven but it could be a bottom line is there only one game away from the wild card now the fillies are falling like a rock and
Arizona courses the other team that they had to beat out and they beat them last night and they get
10,000 people there at P.P. Park to watch the red hot Marlon
You know, it's just the same old crap. It's never gonna change nobody freaking cares
Oh, but it rained yesterday afternoon that it rained during the game. No, I
Mean you talk about lame excuses man talk about a front-running phony town and they can't even do that
On the weekend when they're given away crap then they have their 20 25,000 18,000 people and then during the week nights
It's the same old garbage again
10,000 people
That's of course that is tripled most audience
Absolutely never less and you know something. It's not that far off

For the first time in my life today you might want to mark it on the calendar July 29th. I feel like an old man

AC DC this be good list the the question is
The greatest rock performer or performers that's with the without an S it could be an individual like Billy Joel
Or could be like a group of all time. I don't want to influence the audience in any way shape or form
Oh, I think we ought to put her on there don't you for fun. Okay, let's put say a cruise on here, huh? Give a repeat put in the dip
Hey
And you know we want to apologize for all the cost of comments we made about say the cruise don't we know and about Bob Hope no see I hate Bob Hope
Dead or alive he was first of all rear right wing asshole mr. Republican number two mr. golf
So both of those are big turn off for me. Thirdly, he never said a funny thing in his life
Ever I mean even say the cruise once said
Which I thought was kind of a reason that's not as funny as that other track. It stuck in my head
I mentioned what are they track one of the ones that you fire off it starts not saying

We're not counting that good part
They'll know what we're talking about okay
Van Halen if you want to just Van Halen quick quick complicating see I'm trying to make this simple
We got a lot of simple people out there and you're trying to make it complicated
All I can say to you is
Okay, so let's get the we got already got kissed. Let's get Van Halen on there now

The greatest rock performers of all time
I just want to make sure that there are other votes that came up on here because otherwise it'll make it too obvious
Would you vote for Elvis? No, I did not vote for else
I voted for Wayne Newton myself. I voted for
I was tough it was between her and
I
Guess we don't got time to wait for the whole thing to be between her and
See when you pick when it starts out with the vocal. It's a lot quicker. So I voted for the stones you voted for
Kiss kiss why was there that pause there because we're having a conversation about
Queen I didn't know queen was up there about a queen
Oh, we got to get queen on there Freddie and the mercury, huh? Let's get queen on there
How could you leave out queen out of sight out of mind?
That's not even a one that's Gary Glitter. I know it's Gary Glitter
But he's busy looking at kitty porn now leaving alone
So we got Bruce Springsteen on there
Here's a very interesting facts that says
George had an interesting see there it is again interesting conversation with the caller if they conclusion
Yes, today show well. It's about time
The caller was talking about the courtroom see Michael Corleone. I sure hope he brought the KY
Well, they are Italian, you know
They used olive oil the collar that that's right. He used to know his father in the olive oil business
The caller's opinion was that Frankie didn't testify because he didn't want to embarrass the pentangeline name is being a rat
And the presence of his brother all I can say to that is
George's opinion as well as mine and just about everybody else for the brain was that Frankie climbed up because he didn't want his brother
Wacked no no kidding
This makes the most sense because of in chins or spoke no English no speaking English
In fact the first thing he said when he got off the plane was
And had no idea what the leeway was what was going on. So how could he be embarrassed?
George feels the caller's opinion was valid. What do you think what what?
I said he had a valid point, but I still I still stand by my original
He said to a wimp, you know, said to wish he was she a little wimp. He did not have a valid point. He was an idiot. I disagreed. I disagree with you guys
You know what we really don't give a flying crap. How do you like that? And you know what I did say crap there are almost something else
Almost big go ahead. No, stay outside. I'll let it go this time. Oh, okay for all time say no
No, what do you mean you disagree? What's there to disagree about that? That's what it was all about
He looked at him and they had him so they had his brother and just his very presence there meant that if he testified
That's the way it works. Don't you understand? Well the Kosovo Stras
It's that's the first rule of Kosovo Stras is
You've been reading too many stupid books man
The thing you've learned it brings all over you nice time to leaks
Exactly that's a very good book. I then read the book. The book is great
You have to play all the godfather drop-ins for the next two and a half hours. What do you say?
That's my honor
I think your brain is going to stop
Anyway, it goes on about Bruce Springsteen in about these 53 years old
He plays for three hours in the Audi Audi and he's a performer high-energy. Okay, we got springsteen
Here's another one. It says springsteen. They love Bruce Springsteen. I can't stand him
But he is not about me. It's all about you for what? I don't like him either
During many of the springs was a chronic factor, but it's okay
He says I know you're not a big fan of his, but I'd like to suggest Bob Dylan for your pool. Okay

It's so it's so good when you got something that really works hard to do stuff like this
Listener George says the Beatles are my favorite all-time band but
Comment not I see but again listener George you're confusing. I'm not saying
Don't what's the best group you've ever seen live because a lot of people never saw concert right?
Right I've seen a few in my time but then on TV it's not the same thing but whatever you get that idea
It's as how many in your listening audience actually saw them on stage
I have trouble voting for them based on vintage black and white Ed Sullivan show clips is the pull about who we think was best or we saw that was best
Who you think was best listener George think think think remember you read for Franklin think
What was that thing that Ferrell was doing yesterday? I heard a little bit of that about the what was he calling the songs
He was playing he played I say a little prayer by Deon Warwick what's uh
What's bad about that saw?

Elton john 8 Roosprings the 8 and the Led Zeppelin 8 Elvis only has seven
Now that's pretty amazing because Elvis
Well, I guess it's a generational thing
Because his big thing wasn't just his music, but and just his gyrating hips on Ed Sullivan
But all his years in Vegas
including when he parked up to gigantic
Angus sign and was like
Busting the buttons off those tight outfits. He was wearing yeah, but it was you know I'm talking about sequins
The sequins off those white outfits were like popping all over the stage
Too many cheese peaches and what was the other thing and the uh
Peter better than Ann or two in an anter sandwiches
Anyway, the facts from botchewindalusum better you reminded me about that says the police belong unless did I grab love the police?
Now be your boys not too fond of them unless they're nice ones
Police are on the list. I still say that's the greatest song of all time
Irving breath you take and you you would say uh, it's so commercial
First 500 times I heard it. No, no, see that's not that's not the barometer is what did you hear it too many times?
You know, I mean there are a lot of times that were played way too much. It's just fine
I love the police. I had the greatest hits in my car and see he stepped on it. I was saying a lot of songs were played too much
Like that. Yeah, but if you take it on the face of it that one still sucks
What about the white stripes?
Kakka okay, it says they make real
You already read the facts he had that he had that armed he had a cocked and ready to go what they make really good rock music
There reminds me of something that comes from rock school that aids the 70s absolute how about to appease the muskrat wearing DG in the morning
They put pad boon on the list. Oh sure speaking of old how about fan out fats dominoes a great performer and Chuck Berry sure
Both of them I think both of them ought to be a fast dollar. I love the fat man fat chuck
Walking to New Orleans with the fat man and Chuck Berry
They're great rock performers. Neil. This is probably the last facts. I'll send you were moving up north to South Dakota
Just trying to get closer and closer to Canada

Well, I mean, I don't know what that means is because he's moving to South Dakota. Does anyone have the internet?
Right, how's he listening now?
Maybe they don't allow it up there. You think maybe Tom Dachel is afraid that you know some of that
Bush propaganda will seep in that somebody might read about Ann Coulter or miss Fudge some of the last stuff

You do say it. I'm seeing how can I'm getting into my Italian again
I hate that because Italian and Spanish there's so many words that are so similar and I start to there must be um
You know like we have Spanish like when people write Spanish in English sure there must be like something for like Spanish and Italian you know I mean
Because the countries aren't that far apart and uh there must be people that like have hung out
Have maybe like a little Italian in them
Sure, there must have been a time when the languages were almost identical since they started out the same
So there must be like some kind of hybrid. I don't know if there's a name for you. Yeah
Anyway, Kisses got 20 springstein 19 the who 18

You're right they would they would play in the wreck bar down in
Years ago and then
Thanks that we used to do concerts at highlight and those were great concerts also
And then I had the misfortune of taking my daughter to a Madonna concert and I hate Madonna. Yeah
But it was an unbelievable concert. I mean that woman really put on a show
So and then the last thing is if you ever seen Tina Turner and Cecilia Ruiz in the same room together
Those two

Tantalize you and tease you and and drag you along in a story line never the story lies never ever come to an end
It just goes on and on and on and they do it intentionally just to terrorize you
WQA and hello
Yeah, I'd like to speak to you speaking
How about Ozzy Osborne how about him there you go
You got it man, okay, thanks. Thanks. How can we leave Ozzy off we're we're slipping. We just
Were we up to them? I mean we all respect that Don was slipping, you know, I had my chance if you'd come on here with a complete list
Then what would they do?
Then they bitch about it. They say well, what about now? You're right. No, I don't want to have a complete list
But I mean some of the real obvious ones like the doors and Ozzy Osborne
Who by the way never did bite the head off the bat that sets bull crap? Did you read about with that? No
Well, I'm not gonna go in it. No, that was bull crap. He never really did that. I thought he did
Well, I thought if I'm a mistake and I heard him telling the story and people were throwing like fake stuff
In the thing and somebody threw a real one and he grabbed it before he knew it was real right?
I did it. Well, exactly. Okay, he bit into it, but it was like that and they wasn't it was not an intentional act like part of a show right right now
The pigeon was on purpose not during the show, but during that meeting he ate Walter pigeon on stage
How about frankin for Lauderdale who's gonna have a great sense of humor says how about the traveling Wilbur is oh my god, Frank

Put on the best show I've ever seen their number one choice for me, but since they're an
Electronic band from Germany. I'm probably going first in the vote for him craft work good music by the way I like their stuff
Been listening since 72 Gary Newman
The guy who's famous for his most awful song cars used to put on one hell of a show back in eighties and
It says Tori Amos. We just got that
Peter Gabriel or Genesis with Peter always put on great shows
We'll put Peter Gabriel and Genesis as two separate ones. They can take you think how about speaking of Genesis
How about trippy little Phil Collins? Okay, huh?

Maybe you'll have them on as against did let me ask you this did it ever done on Mo no that there must be some reason why everybody hates him
That just means got this fascination with me and maybe it's I guess it's your fault my fault that everybody else hates him
All we have nothing to do with it. That's it
But did it ever dawn on him to start sitting there in moments of quiet food when they're changing his bag sticking the tubes deep inside his
Wondering why is it that everybody hates me like poison is it that I'm full of crap that I'm a daughtering nasty old prick
What is it that I do that causes everybody to just hate me like poison because everyone else is an asshole?
I see so in other words he's in step the rest of us all just out of step. Okay. Thank you

He had those big hands play the entire upside down big gigantic hands, which of course we all know what that means big gloves WQ. I am hello

It's like saying the best of ten in restaurant in town is and then give me ten of them, you know
Yeah, well, there's some really great ones though. I know. I know it's tough. Okay Bob Marley
Okay
Rock the Bob. Okay. Thanks, man. Yeah, you're welcome. See bye. Bye. Bye. You're welcome George Bob Marley. Yep
Didn't like his haircut too much, but he uh, you know
He could weigh a lot of a pound a sound
The Little River band. Oh, I did not like the Little River band. You know at all
I liked him for about a minute, you know, and then I got a real soul
So
And Maurice Canadian 2 and so is I hate to even say the words Celine Dion. Oh my god
You know our good friend Dion who used to be our good friend. He had a suher to make her change her last name
Probably because any collection connection between Celine Dion and music is purely coincidental. She blows
Collective soul. Oh you too. Whoo. We'll want to put you to honor sure
We're not too happy about it. We'll put it on there. How about the clash how about the clash man
Get some real rock and roll on this list not a bunch of pansies. How about the Ramones? All right
Rest Bob Marley just mentioned only moments ago Janice dropped the moments ago and the police did we put the police on there? Yes
Or did the Beenerborg get paranoid
In their heyday it says on this fact what effects are just pouring in here man. It's unbelievable
In their heyday Emerson Lake and Palmer had unbelievable live performances including a giant mythical beast that flew over the stage
Grand piano that rose to 40 feet off the ground a rotated end over and while Keith Emerson played it a revolving drum turret
Power techniques and one one two then a floor crystal
So it's putting the money Emerson Lake and Palmer got it not gonna get a lot of host though
I think it's more of a generational thing with them. Mm-hmm out of sight out of mind long since
Two bands on here. It says deep purple and in the 80s
Ronnie what is it Ronnie James did? Oh, this is huh Ronnie James D.O. I can't read this the worst writing Ronnie James D.O. had a great
Something
Great manager
That says manager. No, what does that say? I don't know what it says. That's why I great something Billy and Bokas is boy Billy
Get some handbrain lessons, but also Peter Frampton in heart
So what is there like how many on that page?
You're for the best of all time is these a hundred
Okay, put any of those on there you want or not. I don't really care. You got one or two of them. Yeah, we got or not
I don't care Peter Fred. Let's see. Let's see. He purple ELP Ronnie James D.O. go get a life
How about EL
Right
What do you think neon violins? What's not to like right? Give EL get EL on it right away
Betty says I've seen the stones arrowsmith guns and roses and numerous other acts, but non-compared to
Are you ready ready cold play? Okay
Their live performance is electrifying and filled with energy Chris Martin is a genius
He plays the piano acoustic and electric guitars his voices rich and buttery. I'm in love with them. Hi, George
It says I love George too. So Betty loves you
Cold plays great. Oh my oh look at that. I wish I had to know this with a bitch Derek out earlier
See how he spelled to me Hendrick somebody to somebody clues us in on this it says J.I. M.I. is if we didn't know we know our Jimmy Hendricks man
And he spelled a Jimmy as in J.I. M. M. what that's depressing blast for me. It says and you are absolutely correct straight in it out Eric
The mother. I am I
Kind of like Diny, you know Jimmy while you do this
Kind of like a Jimmy yeah and Danny and Danny and Jimmy
You know I cut myself shaving this morning to dad to my other woe
It's not that I want to belly it going here, but just a little nick I had like a bad blade or something
And because I take the planets, you know that blood thinner and it just keeps it's not a big deal
And it's not like bleeding all over my chin, but it's like, you know
Doesn't want to stop I guess they don't make those stiptic pencils. It's a skeptic stiptic. Yeah, skeptic pencils. Do you know talking about?
Absolutely, you must do the medicine cabinet. No, I do not have one. I should have you should they still make them yeah
Oh my god, I remember I'm like a son of a bitch. Yeah, but they stopped the bleeding. Yeah, they do
Well, maybe we could get one for Moe on those ratings here. Stop the bleeding stick it in his
somewhere
What about iron maiden somebody says Louise says that iron maiden? Okay. Why not? Why not?
It's free. Not to lie. Okay, so that gets us all up today with the effects is here my god
It's just a zillion of merry minutes about third man at least
case you didn't hear Moe Howard david's numbers by the way the book that just came out today
They blew they bit they stunt they suck. It was an embarrassment a humiliation. It was degrading subhuman
So were they good? Huh? Were they good? No, no
He could have reached the new I I think if we did a little bit of research in fact our good friend
Maddie Bell I'm sure we'd be delighted to do that because he also hates Moe like poison
If we did a little bit of research, you they could go back in the last what is that how many years they've been all sports about seven or eight
No seriously how many you think
Seven or eight sounds right. Yeah, seven or eight years they've been all sports
I think if they went back through all in fact, muff might do that in the
Hersberg time or clearance or the two of them could put their
heads together and
Come up with that information. I think that he broke the all-time lows
So we can go on and say wow midday. We're not talking about midday. Okay. We did great. We're number one
But we'll just just set that aside that we're just doing our Marcel Marcel imitation here anybody could be number one
I'm a day where you try to deflect okay when you talk about your own numbers if they're really bad
Talking about anybody else doing good and how does meaning anything is not an excuse mo
Okay, in fact we need an asterisk for this book because how the hell did we follow follow you?
careful
What's one that flumb ball?

Probably T-560 WQM now, Sean and Hollywood is a regular chronic factor, and I used to like a lot until, and I, he's in Teddo's opinion, thanks for full of crap.
He says, I personally hold a view that you are the risen Christ, but when it comes to every breath you take, and I in the sky, listen closely, says the same song.
Sure. I must respectfully insert the puke card here, he says.
Every breath you take is a funeral dourge with a juvenile top sticks like cord progression that was played on nauseam, ended up running a Grammy.
No, don't worry, be happy, also want to Grammy. I'd rather hear my own Requiem, he says. Or maybe just Requiem, for dream.
Yeah. The cool thing about your pull is that the best brands don't always translate into the best concerts, may I suggest...
Yes.
Yes, for a good mix of sound quality music, music and the actress, as Sean and the answer is...
Yes, you can suggest, yes, don't be, we had to put in our pull, but we will, because we're in a good mood, right?
Yes. What we...
Yes.
It says, a friend once dragged me kicking and screaming to the Charlie Daniels van Constan years before he became a PTL side show.
I went on over the promise to be playing a drug in country's skank, it was great.
The band members were all great instrumentalists, good graphics, great songs, hadn't heard better since.
The good tunes never get airplay. We want to put Charlie Daniels van on there, why not?
Let's put, and Charlie Daniels van on there, just for the hell of it.
Boy, they're sure a lot of stuff pouring in, man. Just pouring in here, including...
Where the hell was the one that I, where is it?
Because I found, I actually found the song, this will shock, this will absolutely shock whoever sent that in, but I can't find it in facts.
The one that had the Mitch Ryder, right? You know the one I'm talking about?
Here it is. Here it is, thank you very much.
It says, the Kingsword Too Bad, we all want to put the Kings on there?
Absolutely. Kingsword great.
Sure.
In fact, you know who would like the Kings, I bet you'll see their crews.
Is that 80s, okay, welcome in.
No, I'm coming. Can you imagine her singing Lola?
Oh, that's you sweetheart.
Anyway, this fact says, love the stones of Aerosmith, but...
But, Mitch Ryder and, oh, this is one of our list, there's an April Springs.
Have I got pardon?
I just know where you're going, so I'm groaning right now.
Why?
Just because we have it?
No, just because there's suggestions.
Mitch Ryder and the friggin' Detroit wheels the best rockers ever.
You knew this was in there?
Yeah, I know.
Well, I knew it was the same blue yet, the clock yet.
What if Nancy stay in line?
Work, work.
You're stuck.
I have been in there all the time.
Jump up.
Get it.
That's enough.
You don't like Mitch Ryder and the Detroit wheels?
No.
I think you're a friggin' communist man.
Maybe.
God, and what kind of a slut keeps hangs on to a dress bluer otherwise with a cumstain on it, huh?
That's my question.
It's that slut.
A fat disgusting slut, an opportunistic slut.
It wants the black meal somebody and make a fortune.
Cow, pig, disgusting slut.
And of course, the American media got to make a...
Oh, she's the amarder.
You know, she's celebrity now.
You're good.
You slut.
You whore.
Well said.
Couldn't have said a bit of myself.
Here's Rich and Palm Beach says,
Neal's poll, some notable left-outs.
Primus.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I like primus.
Mm-hmm.
Is he still on MSNBC in the morning?
Yes.
Primus in the morning.
King Crimson.
King Crimson moves on here.
Sure.
The sex pistols?
How are they doing?
Well, Johnny's just fine.
Psychedelic fruers?
What is this?
Van House, Bauhaus?
Bauhaus.
Bauhaus?
How?
See, I don't know any of these groups.
This is not my bag at all.
Okay, I'm an old fart, huh?
Bauhaus is old, like from the 80s.
Bauhaus is old.
Speaking of Bauhaus.
Is that 80s?
I'm not going to get it.
Enjoy the vision, Rich and Palm Beach.
When you put whatever ones on there,
I'll leave that to you, because that's way out of my league.
Okay, a crusty old fart like me.
What do I know from that, Dreck?
Huh?
I don't know.
What do you know?
I don't know from that stuff.
There were no ones.
Did we ever put the revolts on there?
I thought we did.
Yep.
Okay.
Sex pistols we did, Johnny, run.
And white snake.
Then we put that on there.
Did you veto it because you were hard-ass?
Well, put it on there now.
Okay, then be told.
We just discussed it right now.
Actually, what's the concert?
The end.
It was a very good concert.
It put on a very good show.
Well, excuse us, okay?
I mean, what you say that like, well, like, there you go.
I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't protest.
I'm not one of these people that pretends to know all the music
from like 100 years or all the movies or all the,
I don't know.
Crap.
If I knew crap, I sure as I wouldn't be here working two days a week
over a hot mic.
447 votes on the pool.
Each or hard out, more, your numbers suck.
Your paycheck is stealing.
Every time it gets a paycheck, it's like stealing, you know?
Mm-hmm.
You gotta be on death row.
Stones 54.
Oh, I look who's moving toward the top.
Is that aegitake?
I'm in a no.
See, and I'm in for, that's bad, because I'm influencing that.
Yeah, we need to balance it out.
You're pushing it.
You're pushing it.
See, great.
So, see, very hard one.
Hard one.
Hard one.
I'm in for it.
Everywhere I live, I'm in for it.
You're in for it.
I guarantee if she wouldn't have croaked in that, you know,
at that early time, if she could have been here tomorrow,
we'd have gone over half a minute.
Is that aegitake?
That would have been, she would have been the one they,
when I put us over the wood pile.
We could have had a call in.
Stones 54.
Seedrick 47.
Cruz.
Beatles 45.
Even a hand of the Beatles, how do you like that?
Did you ever see any of those old tapes from the Ed Sullivan show where he had them on?
Yeah.
And said the Beatles, the Beatles.
The Beatles.
Shoot, I'd never understood him.
Or as...
Murf Griffin said one time, the fabulous VGs.
Why don't remember things like that?
Yeah, because they were so bad and so embarrassing.
And another man with no talent whatsoever.
Could he sing?
Could he play the piano?
Could he act?
Did he do good interviews?
Did he have a good show?
No.
But he invented a wheel of fortune.
Well then.
And a bunch of other games shows, which is why he's got the...
He has a deep buried in the closet.
Harry coconuts or something like that?
No, he didn't have Harry coconuts.
I don't think he had any coconuts.
Did he have a lovely pair of Harry coconuts?
Danny Adenio said he had no coconuts.
Remember Danny Adenio?
Yeah.
He had the fever all right.
He said Peter in the morning and fever at night.
Beatles 45.
You don't even know what that means.
When I worked in Sarasota on WSPB about 100 years ago...
You know how many years ago?
About 30 minutes.
Exactly, 1973.
See that throppin comes in real handy once in a blue moon.
About 30 minutes.
Years.
We had a guy who used to do morning show called Peter Johns.
Very pompous, deep voice, deep voice, but a real pompous ass.
He did a morning show.
I did mid days and then we had a guy called Lowell Schumacher.
The old turkey buzzer was his nickname.
Wacky guy.
He was fun.
He was kind of like Suds Coleman, only a bigger skinnier guy.
At any rate, one day...
Of course, keep in mind, this is 73.
And here's Lowell Schumacher, the old turkey buzzer, who is on here.
And he's promoting the lineup.
He says, of course, don't forget tomorrow morning at 6.
It's Peter Johns.
He says, you know what they say?
Peter in the morning and fever all night.
I heard a different version of it.
And he just lost it.
I mean, I think we had to pick him up off the floor.
He just never recovered practically.
We had to put him into an oxygen tank.
He just... that was the old turkey buzzer.
My close personal friend Lowell Schumacher.
Got only knows where he might be right now.
Did you say turkey buzzer?
The turkey buzzer.
Yeah.
55 for the stones.
48 for Celia.
Maybe she's moving in on the stones.
Wait till she catches Mick Jagger.
Wait till she hops on his ass.
To run for his life.
Beavils 45.
And after that, it's...
Forget about it.
Here's one that says, the village people, what are you saying?
Sure.
They were good at it.
They put on a hell of a show.
It was... it was... it was... it was... it was funny.
Here's one that says, the grateful dead question.
Mark, did we put them on there?
I thought we did.
Even though we are very invertebrate.
We did.
We had a lot of fans wanting to see Jerry in a gang.
And if we would have been for them, we never would have had no fish food either.
Not that I have any idea what...
It's the same concept, right?
The whole bed in Jury's thing would have grateful dead in the fish food.
My favorite says this one is the chorus.
Not cars, but the chorus.
You are.
Yeah, the chorus are good.
I like the chorus.
How do you like that?
I'm shocked.
You know of them.
Because all that...
That European MTV stuff.
All those videos?
That's right.
You're the lucky one.
Aha!
That's right.
They actually show videos on TV and Europe boys and girls.
They break the news here.
I know it's an alien concept, MTV.
And they should only croak at MTV.
And especially, what's his name?
They should take with them right off the bat.
Carson...
Carson Deely.
Of course.

Now, where's that the thanks about the crap macaroni and cheese?
Oh, here it is from Mark.
It says Toronto's own very naked ladies deserve to be on the list.
And you are...
I'm so lovely, correct.
So, I'm pretty sure they're going to be at the concert.
Are they going to be at the concert, George?
Are they going to be at the concert, George?
Are they going to be at the concert, George?
Are they going to be at the concert?
Are they going to be at the concert, George?
I'm going to hang on with.
This is better than sex.
You can't hold Jesus Christ.
And in fact, it's...
All right.
That'd be funny.
There it is.
The more Howard David of Keychains.
Sounds great.
That'd be crunchy, clean.
We're going to have our fundraiser for a band and pet rescue again this year, starting August 1, which is only a couple days away.
And we're going to have the best of Neil 2002-2003 since we didn't have it this last year.
And we might actually sell a few of those before they start...
Before they start making those illegal copies, which we hate people who do that.
And you're going to wind up going to jail.
But anyway, that's all.
Now, how are we going to do that?
Is it going to be available on the Web August 1?
That on our website?
What do you mean you don't know?
Who does know?
Everything should be ready in the week of August 1.
Everything should be ready in the week of August 1.
Well, the week of August 1, the last time I checked it was Friday.
Well, the week of August 2nd, like I said.
Third, fourth.
Whatever that week is.
And then, the week of August, like I said, in the week of August.
First week of August, does that?
August, okay.
August 4th.
Just calm down.
Okay, I realize it's a little bit tough math there working all the way from the first to the fourth.
Oh, we don't have the same age.
Sounds like Monday the Fourth.
So in other words, next week, you'll be in the week.
Monday, going to the Wednesday.
One of the Saturdays.
Now, who am I supposed to be looking for, Bernadette?
I don't know.
Bernadette Peters.
I don't see the list here.
And of course, that's this freaking Toronto national post.
This paper blows, man.
In fact, this paper is right there with Harold and the Sunsental.
Thank the Lord.
We got three other newspapers here.
We got four daily newspapers here, like in a real city.
And this one sucks.
But they give it away free and the price is right.
Anyway, we'll get Bernadette ladies on there.
Got it, be in her head.
We got it.
They're excellent musicians who do an amazing job of getting the audience involved in their show.
It's unfortunately because many of their best-known songs employ amusing and intentionally childlike lyrics.
They're often, I'm fairly dismissed as a.
What am I missing?
I thought you had to.
What did you need to talk about?
What is he talking to?
Let me go.
Why is he talking on the ear?
It's one of those things.
What an asshole.
Anyway, intentionally a childlike lyrics.
They're often unfrily dismissed as an obli group.
However, I know many got people who've changed their opinion when they saw them live.
Great showmen.
Great showmen.
Great guys.
What other band could have their fans throwing boxes of craft macaroni and cheese at them and not have it being installed?
Great show is always says market and honor with that fact.
What are craft foods?
Part of the Philip Norris family.
And we know what your kids want for dinner.
More craft nicotine and cheese please.
It's craft-zone creamy delicious processed cheese melted over pure hugely addictive nicotine.
Kids love it.
It's the nicotine.
It's the cheese.
No, you're right.
It's the nicotine.
My kids can't get enough of craft nicotine and cheese.
Where is it you old hag?
Where is it?
Now, Pilly.
Stop digging under those seat cushions.
I've got more nicotine and cheese right here.
Oh, great mom.
Mmm.
Craft nicotine and cheese.
It's the nicotine.
Craft nicotine and cheese.
Part of the Philip Norris family.
We keep trying to distance ourselves from being an evil representative of tobacco-related death.
But somehow it just isn't working.
That's all moody unlucky.
Exactly.
I thought I'd drop that in there.
It's kind of cute.
I like it.
I loved it.
And obviously they did too, the whole family.
Here's a fact from Josh and Volko who says, no joke.
The best performance I've ever seen is from a band called Gwarr.
He's right.
Gwarr?
He's right?
Well, they're kind of performance artists.
I don't think Gwarr or Gwarr.
Gwarr.
It's a lot of, it's a visual thing.
They wear crazy, crazy costumes made of form rubbery and...
That sounds like...
Yeah, that's what that sounds a little like.
Now, then they take people from the audience and they have this monster, suck them up.
They have monsters suck them?
Yes, up and down.
And otherwise, yeah.
I'll be damned.
Anyways, as Gwarr is the band that plays Fokie Metal and Hoses, the audience down with Take Blood
is the battle, the battle enemies on stage is a great show.
And let's get them on their GWAR.
Okay, I used to work on that station.
Here's one that says, how about Aureo Speedwagon, eh?
Okay, yeah, I mean, great.
Well, look, I mean, we're not endorsing.
We want to do a disclaimer here that we don't have anything to do with all of these choices.
We're embarrassed and humiliated and degraded.
And I just buy Aureo Speedwagon, but like Bob Dylan and Springsteen are known as, but...
It's up to you guys.
Okay, it's up to the public out there, which is why McDonald sells so much crap.
Here's one that says Neil, a group that I think needs to be on the list, is sublime.
Yes.
Their style of punk rock, Skarregae, was like no other.
Skarregae?
Yeah.
What is Skarregae?
You're a liar.
I'm so glad I know nothing about that.
Oh, I'm so delighted.
The lead singer, Brad D. Noel, died of a heroin overdose.
That's unusual.
Yeah, man.
Like so many great ones, originally saying, smoke to a joint of what you have the parody.
So how about a tribute to Brad by playing it?
We certainly will.
Closing fire, Norma, and get syndicated.
Do you know that that Tom Donle like us?
Remember, he did that thing with the alleged rape victim with Kobe Bryant?
Yes.
Just for publicity.
You know, he syndicated on 60 stations and he couldn't break his way out of a paper sack.
He's so bad.
He was on TV last night.
Oh, no.
Oh, the...
Oh, the man.
Do you have that leather jacket on?
No.
No, it was wearing like some nasty S30 T shirt.
Oh, God.
Holy crap.
But in any rate, I just...
I don't care.
You know, I'm on the way out.
I'm phasing out.
If it wasn't for my close personal friend, Mitch Hirsch, I'd already be out, over and out.
How about adding Rod Stewart?
How could we forget, even though I find him repulsing and grotesque in his music and knowing,
and it just gross.
Says Kate, thank you, Kate.
Rod Stewart, of course, right?
Right on.
Now, let me ask you, how are the doors doing now that we really...
We stiff them, but I guess Jim won't mind.
We stiff the doors.
Are they moving up at all?
Yeah, they got 11.
See?
They're already in double digits.
They only been out there for a few seconds.
About third, man.
Stone, we're asking today the greatest rock performer, performer or group ever.
Stone's 55.
Celia Cruz's 52, man.
That little little son that's going to be walking.
That little little son that's going to be...
She's going to win.
I know.
I feel it.
I can smell it.
Can you smell it?
That's right there.
Beatles 47.
Put the sauce on it.
It'll cover up that stench.
Pink Floyd 26, Led Zeppelin 25, Kiss 25.
How about Kiss?
I want to give you a kiss.
We're springstained 24, the Hooth 23.
Bush 19.
I mean, rush.
Did I say Bush?
Well, that's right.
That's how many votes he got in Broward.
Bush 19.
Remember that?
And then turn out to be like about two million.
Rush 19, Bob Dylan 17, Elvis 17, Jimmy Hendricks 17, Erosmith only 13.
What kind of crap is that?
Comey.
No, that's just...
I should have voted for them because you know how obsessed I am with Erosmith.
Doors 11, Elton John, she's got 11.
And Van Halen, V. Heaven 10.
So that's the ones in double digits.
Let's see.
We got it.
We got it.
We got it.
We got 20 more minutes of this stuff and we can get the poll finished out.
And one to two I can take.
And I mean, we can play our...
Oh, seriously?
I am so proud of myself how I did this show today with about three minutes of sleep.
I have no idea how I did this.
You did it.
Did a poll, that's how.
What does that mean?
We're poll building all day today.
We are building a big poll.
Okay.
And there's nothing like building a big poll.
Some of us, of course.
A small poll will do.
20 to 1 at 560 WQM.

Hello, I'm Andy.
Hi, my name's Dustin Diamond.
Where you can call me Screech.
That was my name on Save By The Bell on your new partner.
I don't like the sound of that.
Oh, don't worry about it.
By the 11th season, I was Mr. Bell's assistant principal. I'll make a great call.
I don't think so, Aspase.
Hey, Zach used to call me Screech-y-r-r-u. And AJ called me the Screech-in-ator.
But I don't think I like Aspase.
Open your mouth again and you're gonna get bitch slapped.
Mr. Bell didn't use to protect me from bitch slappers.
What do you do if I call him down here?
So I'm gonna kick his ass.
Huh? What if I call AJ?
I'm gonna kick his ass.
Yeah, we just be buds.
In your dreams, pal.
You sound very disturbed.
Right back at you, douchebag.
Hey, I'm not a disturbed person.
I just played one on TV for 15 years.
So, you're not gonna break your jaw.
1246 is 560 WQ.
I'm happy Tuesday to you.
And again, we are.
It's dumb Tuesday.
I'm dumb.
George is dumb.
In Vinaibor, of course, we already knew that going in.
Are we dumb or what?
Dumbest.
You know which one I'm talking about here?
I...
This is one of my favorite groups in the world.
The doors was bad, but this is worse because they're gonna be here tomorrow.
Did you know that?
No, I didn't.
I must have been in the promo.
And there's Canadian A.
And there's Canadian A.
Guess who?
I don't know.
How many guesses do you give me?
Dr. Bell.
Third, man.
Don't step on it.
I would never.
I don't have any idea where this goes.
First song I heard in America.
You stepped on it.
I thought it was...
I thought it was...
Well, that was...
Prelude.
Doesn't start yet.
This is the one I wanted to play in.
Like I said, this is probably the best song I ever sang.
What's your thing?
See, you cut the other one off before the big grunt.
That's my favorite part.
I don't have time for that.
It's not a music show.
It's always fun for a grunt.
See an A.
Step on it again.
Burton comes.
He's gonna come here and think the crap out of you.
Is Burton coming?
I don't know.
It sounds like it smells like it's word.
Burton.
Man.
Man.
I'm sorry about cheering a heavy load.
I was gonna happen to you in any uniform now.
Ow!
I'll be there and shake your hand.
We left him off.
Well, get him on there right away, Eric.
Immediately if not sooner.
It's embarrassing.
We are so pathetic.
We're tragic.
We want to just walk out right now.
We didn't need the money.
You know what?
Between the stroke and the dope.
Yeah.
And my lack of sleep and the whole day.
All the other fuzzarai.
And stroking the dope.
Anyway, stroke this.
This is why not the best Canadian group of all time.
And tomorrow's co-headliners, the guest who says RSS.
What is it saying to bottom of that?
I can't you cut a chopped off.
George's one.
You're just something man.
Me old man.
I can't read that in the bottom.
Thank you very much for reminding me because that would have been.
That would have been in Fomnia.
It probably would have had a hitman here in a half an hour.
Here's one that says the movie blues.
Everybody got a thanks mark.
I mean, got the movie blues and also Stevie Ray Vaughan.
And was going to go see, I can't read this.
Something about Abba.
Oh, gonna suggest Abba but talk twice.
No, I think Abba there.
That show, by the way, goes on all over the world.
Are you aware of that?
Yeah.
I think got to be on there.
That show has to be on.
There's Abba and Abba wannabe's and Abba.
Abba, you have to Abba do.
They're all over the place.
Right?
Abba, that was funny.
No, it was not.
I thought even...
It wasn't even mildly amusing.
You were hysterical.
So this trade, maybe won't you climb on board?
No, I don't play that.
I mean, it's okay, but it's at his moments.
Oh, another...
I guess you saw him that I absolutely love.
Love it.
Skip the one that I absolutely love.
Which one is that?
No sugar.
I mean, I don't have time.
You crazy?
You know how to say sugar is better though, yeah?
I forgot.
I know it.
That girl is walking on that road.
That girl is in that tunnel.
And when all of them go to the bathroom,
they'll go to the bathroom.
They'll come and get ready.
They'll come and get ready.
I'll say one thing.
That one is she sound like a man,
but she couldn't sing for crap.
She just made a lot of noise.
Which I guess is why we call it Hootsie Cootsie, right?
Hootsie Cootsie Mama?
Well, Hootsie anyway.
Not too much of the Hootsie with her, I don't think.
Certainly no Cootsie.
I heard she had a gigantic strap on as their mom heard,
but I probably shouldn't mention it on the ear.
No, that's bad.
You shouldn't say that, because some people get very upset.
Is that aegi?
That's aegi?
That's aegi?
No, no.
And then the next time Beener tries to start that QM van.
Let's see.
How many times...
Look at that cheese right up on a mix of...
Aston's 59.
Celia Cruz 54.
For good old Cecil Cruz.
Tienes must macho.
Celia Cruz or...
Freddie Cruz.
Ann Murray.
Beatles 50.
Kiss 27.
Pink Floyd 27.
Springsteen 25.
Led Zeppelin 25.
The Ho 24.
Rush 19.
Bob Dylan 19.
Elvis 18.
Jimmy Henry 17.
The doors 14.
Thank goodness they're moving.
They're sliding it up there.
Sliding it up to the other side.
Aerosmith 13.
Grateful dead 12.
The dirty dozen Elton John.
It doesn't.
Van Halen 11.
And then after that, single digits, including a...
Billy Joel with Elaine Yine.
Please, please, me a lot.
This is another disgusting story you keep feeding me these damn things it's awful.
Now I'm a troublemaker.
Just making these up.
Sacramento, California.
Four lawsuits filed to California claimed to hope his witnesses officials have been covering up alleged sex abuse of children.
But congregation leaders adding to a series of similar suits nationwide.
All right.
The law firms involved in the suits filed last week in three northern California.
Counties are holding public meetings this week in search of more victims and witnesses.
It's a widespread problem and nothing's been done about it to protect these children to protect future children.
And said, Bill Breesburg, one of the Sacramento attorneys who filed four lawsuits in California last Thursday.
Once the church leaders knew about it, they didn't do a damn thing to stuff.
Sounds familiar, don't it?
Just like our good friends at the Cantler Church.
By the way, I did do some investigative work all the sex with time.
I've had off and been putting bits in the VCS.
I did do some investigation, you know how many straight priests there are in the world.
Yeah, I...
That's what I found out.
And one of them was Father Marin who went with us no more so I guess eight.
And what was the other...what was his name?
Oh, Father Pernoy.
Yeah, he was Father Pernoy. He was also Father. That's good. That's his name.
Oh, I know. He's dead. Yeah.
What a shame. Father Karris. No.
Thank you. That would have kept me up all night.
Alex Karris.
That's the power of Christ to pay you.
Oh! The power of Christ to pay you.
Okay, it's enough. Like I told you, we don't have time for all that stuff.
Is that angry? Is that coming?
No. Is that angry? Is that the bow?
It was coming from the other side, man. I'm sorry. Watch it.
She's breaking on through from the other side.
The spirits? She's breaking back on through from the other side.
She's trying to make it come back.
Anyway, here's a...did I do this sublime thing?
Oh yeah, I got...I love today.
No, it's going on.
I don't either. I'm an incoherent and we're having a great show as a result.
I guess I should never sleep. We'd have a great show every day ago.
Like rumor.
Stone's 59, Celia 55.
I'm guarantee I have all the confidence in the world. He's going to pull it ahead.
WDQA, hello.
Hi, how you doing?
Pretty good. How you doing?
P-T.
We haven't a Zixi chick longer yet?
Zixi chick. So let's get him on right away.
The European version.
Okay, pal. What are you saying?
That was that, huh?
That was my guy.
Yeah, European.
5670560.
And 0.560.
I'm the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. WDQA, hello.
Oh, Neil.
Yes, sir. How about Chicago?
Oh, my God. Another one of my all-time favorite groups.
I feel like I'm an idiot today and I'm probably am.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks, pal.
Chicago.
And also I got some of that here too, which I know gets you upset.
Sure does.
You don't want Chicago?
I want Chicago a lot.
The older, the better.
Old days, Saturday and the park, all of these things.
Well, how about a bar, if you would?
Yeah, what do I think about it?
Get that right, we am all for it, man.
Don't be stepping on poor serious.
He's got enough tourists already.
Well, I guess that's a bonus because we get here a few clips here,
which of course blows off.
No, the fact that we left these people on.
Oh, there we go.
My goodness.
How is Terry Cat doing?
Oh.
Okay, but again, we're talking about performers.
Keep that in mind.
Just keep that in the before you cast your all-important vote.
We're talking performers.
Onstage, people like to really sing and perform as opposed to like in the studio.
Like for real, in front of an audience.
And entertain and amuse the new ladies and jump up and down and scratch through it.
That's the fuck that.
We got somebody at QM, those about scratching his ass by the way.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Wouldn't that have been a hell of a combo?
Celia Cruz and Chicago.
That would have taken her up.
Dynamite.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
Pound 5, 60 on the 18 team for Ryzen Wireless Land.
We got that big one or two hour coming up.
And then we got Joe Rose.
We got a rip Mo and Asperger two hours between two and four rhymes with Mo.
Joe Zaganki also rhymes with Joe and Mo and Joe.
Zaganki filling it for the Humper at four.
And then we got the Marlins and the Arizona Diamondback.
You've got to do better than 10,000 people people.
The team is hot as a pistol.
For all's trying to get the entire town to work up.
They were frenzy.
All the way to notice he's given up, I think.
And they're only one game out of a wild card.
They got 10,000 people there last night.
And they're playing Arizona, which is one of the two teams right now.
They're battling for that wild card deal along with the Phillies.
And he came to the baseball game and he lowly rated Joe and Mark overnight.
I said that was great to this May, you know, because they're good guys, especially Joe.
I mean, Mark, yeah.
But horrible.
What are we going to do about that?
I don't know.
I blame you for that.
It is like, because Joe is trying to be like another, you know,
with eating ass and big racks and packages.
He's trying to do that stuff.
Talk about something real intellectual.
Talk about some heavy-duty stuff, Joe, about solving the problems of the world.
Because all the people that are up overnight are like in some of the acts,
they're much in neurotic assholes.
They don't know from racks and packages and stuff.
They don't even know what they're talking about.
What are we going to do to improve the Joe and Mark show?
Ignore it.
New hosts.
Now come on, that's bad.
Very bad.
In fact, maybe Mo, if we move Mojo in the time slot.
Not bad.
They can switch the water.
What are we leaving you, folks, when we leave it,
your capable hands now, the greatest rock performer or performers of all time,
Stone 60, Celia Cruz, 56, Beatles 51,
Cinque d'uno,
Kiss 28, Pink Floyd 28, Led Zeppelin 26, Bruce Springsteen 25,

I'm in local, your sports radio 560, Celia.
Celia.
Oh, this is Pope John Paulins.
And if he asks me, the only thing more fun than playing Grandass with a Swiss guy
is the Neil Rogers.
One to two.
Power.
Oh.
Surely you've got all the Harry Potter books.
And you've got the Harry Potter homespunectomy kit.
But now you've got to get the Harry Potter pet prodsology kit.
Man, that please great.

Five of it.

And in week seven, Fred Rerunberry takes the role of Sergeant Scusey from Internal Affairs.
Hi, hi, hi, hi.
All new blue with all old actors this month on ABC.
My fellow Americans, we have entered a new era.
And this new era requires new responsibilities both for the government and for our people.
And realize that for the first time ever, we do not believe women should be educated
or should have health care or should leave their homes.
People are going about their daily lives, working and shopping and playing as shallow materialistic consumers
who care only about getting rich or getting ahead.
And this is good for America.
I'm encouraging school children to kill all Americans and we will prevail.
Good riddance.
Tonight on Action News, Britney's new CD, it might be a bit too much for your young team.
This is retarded.
No, I was just going to stand on that level that we're not fucking now.
That's tonight on Action News.
Oh my goodness, you're doing my crew!
Oh my goodness!
I am a Republican, accountable for nothing in purveys to any wrongdoing.
I am golden.
Democrats Scusey, liberals are filthy women who are bred like rats.
I am a Republican.
I am against hate.
Why hate hate?
Unless of course it's my own.
I am Republican.
And I am not a racist.
Neither are my friends at the country club.
I am a Republican.
Sex is for humans.
I am a Republican.
I am a guest civil rights and abortion.
I am a licensed place to prove it.
I am a Republican.
A bad economy is a good thing.
I am a Republican.
I support an unprovoked war against Iraq.
Not only because I'm ordered to do so, but I believe exploiting the deaths of 3000 Americans is good for business.
I am a Republican.
I am proud to have ex-cons running my government.
I know they will never come for me.
Or I have nothing to hide.
I am a Republican.
I enjoy listening to Rush Limbaugh with my dog balls in my mouth.
I am a Republican.
I wish Hitler were still alive so I could eat the corn out of his do-do.
I am a Republican.
And you will know me.
That will be me in the leatherhead cover being led around the fetish club naked by a leash.
Oh God, I love that.
It's like the end of the pile of the scarlet campers in the ladies room.
Yes, sir.
Where's my belly with your lipstick?
Yes, sir.
Oh, sir.
I am a Republican.
You make me your slave.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Don't be fooled by the rocks in my pants.
I'm busy with the big fat potterrican.
I got a secret you may not understand.
I'll bet you didn't know.
I'm really a man.
I shake, leap, weather, eat, and bully all jack.
But I'm still known as the girl from the block.
Hornin' men want me a lot.
But very little know that I have a thing.
I started dressing like this in my teens.
Dressing like a book of queen.
With just some collagen and silicone teats.
My body's well rounded.
Like I told you, I'm a manly man.
That's not footage cheese on my can.
I got my knee back there in the jam.
My hair is real.
Give it a squeeze.
And my hair too.
I do a better cap on the feminine vice.
But I got a little cold.
So I don't have a choice.
I like the surprise in the eyes of the boys.
When they get a load of eye on circumcised toy.
Nothing else is falling, no harmonies.
But under my clothes, the rest is me.
Don't be fooled by the rocks in my pants.
I'm busy with the big fat potterrican.
I got a secret you may not understand.
I'll bet you didn't know.
I'm really a man.
A shady buttery skin, a whole little jock.
But I'm still known as the girl from the block.
Hornet night what me a lot.
But very easy to know that I have a big crew.
Wait a minute.
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile
story.
We take a good, hard stiff look and to start up.
They succeeded with an upbeat tone about pulling through.
Just when you think you're going to fail.
Then they failed.
They were swing out sister.
You know, we still get mail from people about how our song changed their lives.
Lying through her teeth, swing out sisters Corrine Vluery lives in a sewer of denial.
Refusing to face the fact that her happy little song did f*** all to get her anywhere.
I'm sorry for Corrine, myself.
I've come to terms with it.
Corrine's bandmate Andy Carnall visits her often at their home.
I mean, I've accepted the fact that we were a f***ing band who didn't deserve more than one hit record.
No!
We suck, baby.
We're irrelevant.
No, no, no.
Don't stop.
To ask.
Now you found a break to make it last.
Oh, we're lame.
Break out.
Come on, sing with me now, Andy, please.
If you love me, sing with me.
Oh, God!
Come on, go start.
To ask.
Now you found a break to make it last.
You've got to find a way, say what you want to say.
Swing out sister.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, now you've said two sentences and I have not interrupted you.
Well, Bill, if I could just say that.
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not thinking the way with that.
Then at nine, it's more debatable debate on Fox News.
Canadian comed discuss the issues of the day at the top of their lungs.
Tonight the subject Hillary Clinton, is she a crazed twisted liberal or just a vicious conniving bit?
Well, I f***** shut up, Alan, you comey.
Then it's him.
Fox News presents the edge with Paulazon.
We don't know why she has a show, but she's your little scourge.
Tonight on the edge, we'll examine why George W. Bush is the greatest president in the history of the universe.
And we'll hear from both sides conservative Republicans and liberal Republicans.
Fox News.
The coverage is always fair, accurate and balanced towards our point of view.
On Fox News.
Fox News.
We distort.
You decide.
All right.

How's that doing in a car tree?
Well
Oh
The
night.
I told you don't bother me while I'm in here.
I said hello.
It's Mickey Mouse.
Oh, Mr. Mouse.
Good morning.
How are you?
What the hell are you doing to me?
Nothing, sir.
You're freaking killing me.
No, I'm not.
I got David Kelly calling me every three minutes.
Why did we move the process?
Sir, you told me to move the bride.
I didn't tell you.
You must have misunderstood me.
No, sir.
You said move the practice to Monday.
Hey, hey, listen, butt wipe.
I'm the boss.
I make the decisions.
You take the heat.
You all move the practice.
OK.
How are we going with it anyway?
I am mad.
Hold on.
What are you doing?
Remaz.
Yeah, boss.
Shot the hell up.
I'm on the phone, Remaz.
Hi, there.
Yes, sir.
What was your question?
I'm telling you.
I'm going crazy over here.
Between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson called me every three minutes, I'm going to
go out of my freaking mind.
Hold on.
Remaz.
Yeah, here you go.
Stop it, Remaz.
I'm going to fall low.
Stop falling low, Remaz.
Remaz.
Remaz.
It's one thing to my hand, Remaz.
That's your penis, boss.
My other hand, Remaz.
That's the phone, boss.
Right.
I can't hear anything, Remaz.
Stop sawing the phone.
I'm going to fall.
Sorry.
I said, sir.
The moves are working out very well.
The practice is fourth and it's time slot and fourth and fourth.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?

What's the hell you're doing with a high monocoreal?

Don't play, Remaz.
I'll jam the thing down your throat.
Get the food right away from me.
Oh, come on, Blueberry.
I'm allergic.
I saw.
Sir, over 25 million people saw.
Shut up, Eisner.
Listen.
Yeah.
You see me what I'm doing here?
Sir, you're on the phone.
I know I'm on the phone.
Do you see what I'm doing?
You're an imagination for crying out loud.
I'm moving my hands up and down.
Slide aside.
I'm the puppet master.
I say it.
You do it.
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff that you cut out of a Michael Jackson interview.
But sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff to make him look like a man.
And then, then, then, then, then.
Puppet master.
Me.
Idiot.
Oh.
Puppet!
Reveal the mind.
Here's the apple.
What the hell are you doing now?
It's in the floor, though.
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remus.
What's this in my ear?
That's your penis, boss.
My other ear, Remus.
That's the phone, boss.
That's the phone, Remus.
Get out.
Come on over to work.

we were saying basically, you know,
dance hall days.
F**king amazing.
I beg you, I beg you.
What you want to name the band Wang Chung for?
You stupid f**king gold blouse.
We'll hear from the band's first manager, Anthony, up your uncle.
Cool, Jack was such a pretentious little no-bend.
And his hope will also be about the name of the band.
And tonight, never before seen footage of Jack Hughes
explaining himself until his head explodes.
Well, the philosophy of Juan Chung
seeks to find a pitch of music
which conforms to the principles of cosmic order.

That pipe smoker and uncircumse I skew, would bend and gauge in the fatal of death.
I'm a cranky homo-fold, not that I mind it, but I'm way too old.
I fantasize about fear and death, and at risk with feed-loos my boyfriend did it.
I'll just make up with Ginger in some thing, and then ask him to rate my fun.
No, there ain't no more again.
Though I would not feel the most fooling, and I would not be ashamed about a Ginger and more gay union
Just bold and then stroking away.
Boy, baby, kill me, you're not my guy.
Yeah!
You sound like a nine-year-old kid.
Hey!
Only a macho-menly guy.
You don't know me.
That makes me lift my wings.
If Ginger was a lover of mine, I'd bury my oldest baby now.
Inside his pimply rear end, today, today, today.
No, I would not be a sport-old.
Now!
If I was not a closet of faith, that's why a Ginger and more gay union would make me feel giddy and gay.
Everybody follow my thousand balls.
Yeah, Ginger and more gay union would make my sorrel-boney ass kill-stay.
If we had a Ginger and more gay union, then he wouldn't have to get me raped, evident.

We're keeping us in the dark.
A noble act of praise on.
We're far best interests at heart.

so just relax on your back as a question-y-all.
Why do you concern long as you're the winner?
It's all gonna be you.
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.
That little black thing that's walking on that little black thing,
has that stupid-
Bye, bye, bye!
I'm gonna show you what I'm fighting for.
I wanna give you a kiss.
You can kiss my rear end.
Absolutely.
