Good.
But isn't that right, Bobby?
No.
She doesn't have it.
That's not true at all.
Don't you?
You don't have a penis.
It's an underdeveloped penis.
That's what I was told when I was a small child.
Bobby, isn't it the fact that it's really your face?
You were told that small child, you said that you were a himafridite.
I was told a lot of things when I was a small child.
So were you lied to you, Bobby?
I don't think I was lied to about my past.
No, not yet.
Did you live your life in your early informative years as a woman?
Yes.
And it is totally...
It is totally my whole life.
What'd she say?
How?
I...
I...
I...
I was a wonder...
I'm a very athletic person.
I've always been a jeans and t-shirt type girl.
I wonder when it could unclose if I looked like a dike.
I wonder if I...
Well, the way I wear my hair, people are going to think I'm a dike.
Yes.
I wonder what people are thinking about me.
I wonder how may hell did I let this happen to me?
How did I choose to look like this?
If I win, P-A-Y, S-U-C-K-S-O!
Everybody do dog, sympathy A.
Peter Jennings has a real good to pay.
When we do makeup, covers are gray.
Everybody do dog, eaters.
Okay.
Whistle while you work, Barbara Walpheus has a cork.
Oh, I insist her little list dries all the guys the circus.
Whistle while you talk.
I hold, I he, time for NYPD.
See Dennis friends take off his pants, I hold.
I hold, I hold, I hold, I hold.
Where's David Caruso?
Come to Smith's Caruso's store, I hold, I hold.
I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay, I pay.
I couldn't agree more than 903-560 W to QM.
I just found some stuff this morning that was sitting there.
And I haven't played that one about 20 years, at least.
And then that Herado thing, you know something we like Herado back in the old days.
When he was really being Herado, a real jerk, a real asshole.
And exploiting human misery for a while.
You've really started taking himself so seriously running over to Afghanistan with a little pea shooter or his, whatever he's got.
What an idiot.
Is that what he's calling it?
A little pea shooter is what he's got.
Squirt, Squirt, Herado.
Anyway, so it's big of a pea shooter, who is that bimbo that everybody run up and down the hallway this morning?
The bad loretta.
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
He's got a tiny ass.
Yeah.
And?
And what's her story?
Do you tell me?
No, I mean, did you see her?
No.
So in other words, her story must not be too much.
I'll tell you she must have some story because Miguel was in here squeezing it.
He was like jumping up and down, hyperventilating, humping the door knob over there.
What is that all about?
Well, they know he's got all about.
She used to be the way in Newy-cho.
He was like, and they actually worked together.
And then Scroan, who of course, anytime any sex spot comes in here of any variety,
he's marching a whole, a sales staff up and down the hall.
Both of them.
Well, there aren't too many left anymore.
You don't understand how I know.
Yeah.
It was a short parade.
So anyway, Muff opens up the door with his luck just as I'm playing this thing here.
Everything in his room has been dicked with over the weekend.
And we know, just they won't stop.
Must've been the power outage, even though that doesn't turn knob.
No, that doesn't turn knob.
And it certainly don't change the bank on the 360 clearance.
But thanks for your mind check.
That's all accounts.
Now I can go home.
Clarence is the best.
You know what I've always said that about him, even though we can't get laid.
How about, what's your name?
Tristan.
Trista.
Whenever the hell are name is.
Not so in other words, she's not so hot as what you're saying.
I don't know.
I've never seen her like the person.
Well, if you thought she was hot, you'd have been the first one in the hall where you'd not been
got right on the goddamn floor.
Right.
And you'd never made a move from that chair.
So that tells me a lot of the fact number two that she was a QM QD.
Yeah.
That tells me everything I need to know about as cute as Carlos's ass.
Oh, God.
What are those words?
Hands selected by Sam.
You know.
Why did you have to ruin my week?
George wants to apologize.
By the way, for a lot of crap that he said last week on the air.
I will like it to you.
I got another great book, by the way.
I don't know why I waste my time giving all these books out on the air because I don't know if anybody ever reads them.
You think that they ever do?
No one.
Anybody?
No one.
One.
Not one.
Come on.
Somebody call and tell me you once bought a book that I recommend it on the show.
Just take that back.
People call all the time about the farewell to God.
Right.
Must have given up.
Then he had the nerve to go ahead and dying.
The nerve.
Not unless I'm taking him out.
That must be it.
But blinded by the right, if you haven't read this book yet by David Brock, oh, and by the way, my good friend Lynn, I hate to write the new book she already sure knows.
That he outsmist drudge in here toward the end of the book.
I mean, big time.
It's like nothing that's any surprise.
But I still don't understand that.
It's like Jews for Hitler, self-hating fags, right wing fags.
I don't get that.
But anyway, got another great book.
Boy, it is freezing in here.
It doesn't say it on the thing in there.
But aren't you a little chilly when I came in here, but I thought it was just me.
And Carlos is always cold because of that nutrition.
Oh, there's something in the year here.
Now, remember on Friday, they were pumping into poison gas.
And I think today they got to crank that big time.
Maybe that's why they had everybody who was in here, dicking around all weekend.
They must have the door wide open for the crew that was in here.
Anyway, here's a great book.
What liberal media is the truth about bias and news by Eric Olsson?
Hey, Bernie Goldberg.
Let me say one thing about him.
He's an asshole.
Did I tell you?
For our Goldberg and CBS news.
I guess nobody ever took Bernie seriously enough.
He usually do all those puff pieces.
So he had to decide to spill the beans about the liberal media.
Well, it's nonsense.
This book is great.
Eric Olsson.
In fact, there's a chapter 13, the really conservative media.
I might actually read like one page.
Oh, don't be reading on here again.
Why the hell not?
I don't see anybody calling to say that they bought a book that I recommended.
WQAM.
Hello?
I don't tell me the phone is screwed up too.
That would be the ultimate.
There you go.
What do you mean there I go?
Oh, well, it wasn't on?
Well, there's nobody on there now.
Well, not all of the buttons were on.
Hello?
WQAM, Ola?
When is this?
Maybe they need to press their buttons too.
Come a thigh.
Okay, they're not there anymore.
That was my fault.
It was your fault for whatever, so whoever dick with the board in there.
And no matter how many times we say this, if they just, you know, between clearance and muffin,
literally like that,
lock the doors, put a padlock on there, keep these assholes out of here.
Okay?
I heard it was Vlad was in here, dicking around with stuff.
I don't even know who the hell that is.
Which one is Vlad?
Vlad is the black one.
Oh, well.
What can I say about that?
See, you're starting up with that again.
That's what color his skin was.
I asked you how you know which one he is.
I don't know which one he is.
Oh, he's our token here.
I could've said he's the really good dancer.
Let me say it again.
Blinded by the right, all of that stuff about Anita Hill, the clearance Thomas business,
this book is just unbelievable.
I mean, it comes right out, David.
Rockin tells you it was all a freaking lie.
All the stuff about the Arkansas troopers.
The Arkansas project, as they call it, was all bull crap.
So when I sit here and I tell you not to name by in this audience,
cares about the right-wing conspiracy
and about the fact that they've taken over the media and they've stolen the government,
it's the truth, but nobody cares.
You're just liking it up, liberal fight.
Right, you're right.
You're onto me.
Get off.
Anyway, we had the poll about the infomercials on Friday.
That was a horrible poll and I apologize profusely, but it was Carlos's idea
because he had that big list of infomercials and he's an infomercial junkie.
So I apologize.
Don't ever let me get talked into another poll by him.
He's a punk.
So we took that off of there.
And late Friday, I called Eric and we f-faxed over to him another poll.
Sneak one in Nirania.
Look at that. A thousand and three votes on the sneak poll.
That's pretty good.
What are you going to do to respond to the orange, high terror alert
that was issued? It says today, but of course, that was on Friday.
Besides scream a lot.
That's another alternative.
Absolutely nothing different.
454, 45.2%.
I don't buy it. It's part of the war scenario.
268 skeptics out there, 26.7%.
Screw my brains out while I still have time, 119.
Run in circle, scream and shout 84.
I got good choices on here.
Hide under the bed 44.
Stay home a lot 16.
No flights 14.
No long trips of any kind 4.
So the last three categories there is only 34 people out of over a thousand.
So I don't think they're buying it.
You know what I'm saying?
No.
WDQA.
They're not there.
Maybe there was somebody who once bought a book.
WDQA.
I am.
Yeah, I want to talk to Neil.
Speaking.
Hey Neil, I want to call and let you know that I'm part of the Neil book club.
Great.
I'm going to put that Oprah bitch to shame.
I'll tell you that.
Oh, you do anyway.
The first one you recommend a while back was official and confidential about J. Edgar Hoover.
Yeah, Edgar Hoover, right.
And then the second one was a shake down.
I'm not quite finished with that one yet.
You're still shaking it?
Yeah, I got about a little more than halfway through, but it's wow.
It's very interesting.
Blinded by the right man, David Brock.
Trust me if it's the only book you ever buy again in your life.
That's my next one after I finish a shake down after I finish shaking it down.
Okay.
Take care.
Thanks.
There you go.
See, I told you they all in a night and not one, not one.
Man, you're just a, oh, and speaking of, uh, stuff being hidden and buried in about the press.
Page 14A in the Sun Central.
I don't fight it all in the Harold.
Terrorist, the alleged tyrant who's saying still a hazy.
And the last paragraph, oh yeah.
And the last paragraph says they also pointed out the need to the Bush administration or the British government has produced direct evidence of Iraqi involvement with the Al Qaeda terrorist attack.
Network.
Oh, see, there was one of the polls that keeps showing all of these polls.
The one that counts that they showed over the weekend.
Who do you, I don't know which one it was, but who cares?
Who do you trust more on Iraq?
Colin Powell or George W. Bush?
Bush had 24% Colin Powell 63%.
That's why they tried to demotter before the win last week.
It isn't a question of substance, if you can say that word.
It's a question of, you know, it wasn't a message.
It was a messenger.
Say, right.
I mean, he wouldn't lie to us, wouldn't he?
Of course not.
No, thank you.
And he wouldn't make him an offer he couldn't refuse either.
Love it after 9 at 5.60 W.D.Q.M. Happy Monday to you.
We're going to try to recover, put all the pieces of this studio back together.
We're going to get in spite of the fact that nobody in this place will extend a helping hand to us on that.
But I got my check in my pocket.
And that's the only reason I came in today.
I thought I'm not happy to see everybody here today, but I'm got my check in my pocket.
And I'm on the way to the bank right now.
Got that one with a straight face.
Yeah.
Here's the tallie, okay.
Assoles.
Great, guys.
What women really wanted Valentine's Day is for you to put a little thought and creativity into your gift.
This year, express yourself in a fun and original way and say it.
Would they Vermont Teddy Bear?
Just call 1-800-829 Bear and a friendly bear.
Council will help you choose from over 100 bears, hand-cracked in Vermont, and delivered in a colorful gift box.
With a free card and chocolate.
Tell her she lights your fire with a new burn-in lovebeard, dressed like a hunky fireman.
Would love to add to on his arm.
And boy, there's nothing like a hunky fireman.
Or say I'm wild about you with a jungle lovebeard.
They even have an officially licensed lovebeard tender Elvis Bear.
Sending it for Vermont Teddy Bear is a creative personal alternative to flowers.
It'll be around long after Valentine's Day to remind her of you.
If you'd like send a bear to the office or a co-worker's can see how thoughtful and romantic you're posturing and pretending to be.
Over night in Valentine's Day delivery still guaranteed over a known day.
You got a lot of time.
It's the 10th.
Call 1-800-829 Bear or shop online at Vermont Teddy Bear.com.
This year, be sure and say it.
With a Vermont Teddy Bear for Valentine's Day, be sure and tell him old Neil Tordy to call 1-800-829-BEAR.
And look all this is 4205-60.
You ain't too way.
It play like men and they look like women.
Blinded by the ride.
Bamboo, some thy duchy bags, the pixie more a ride.
Blinded by the ride.
I felt like a douchebag because I knew they were a ride.
I know you may not understand what I did or who I am.
Most of you don't read any books.
So let me introduce myself.
Neil Tordy, I was a well respected hard-right man and trusted by high-level snooze.
I used to have a powerful, Republican position, high up on a poor ground.
The Holy Christians were in systems that I had as red-adventive with any means that could be found.
You ain't seen I had a nervous breakdown.
All titles blinded by the ride.
Bamboo, some thy duchy bags, the more a pasty bag, blinded by the ride.
I felt like a douchebag because I knew they were a ride.
I had admission to the parties from my moralistic Christians that are in there, treating it on the road.
Why's that a rexic-pondic sister and cult, they're raising posters, giving power balls a tongue?
My job was to welcome news to the right wing.
Point of view, people might be easy to sway.
And now the hatred that I spewed about minorities and bankers used make me want to prove to you today.
I knew they didn't say I was gay because I was blinded by the ride.
Bamboo, some thy duchy bags, the pasty moral, blinded by the ride.
There was an cult that she was naked on her paws with two gas-taken her.
Dog-star.
I'm 18 at 5.60 W.D. Q.A.
And so I wasn't in Tristan?
Trista.
Trista, why do I keep saying Trista?
I don't know.
Does it really make a difference?
No.
She was a Q.A.M. Q.D., so obviously she must have been really well anyway.
What are you laughing about?
I don't know what you looked like.
I'm not going to take his word for it.
Maybe she's a real hot number.
And when you're down here, you want to see all these people marching up and down the hall.
But they also marched up and down the hall to see Ron Jeremy, too.
Right.
Maybe she was Harry.
Trista.
Maybe she's got a Harry bag.
I'll ask him to go.
In fact, maybe she and Mo are rubbing her bags together since he's got a sexy bag, according to what Scrooan.
By the way, Scrooan, you left this big black instrument in my studio here.
Get it out of here.
There are things crawling around on it.
Anyway, here's our poll for today.
We'll get around to it.
I'm a little bit, I don't know, fog either day, you know what I mean?
It was foggy when I drove into work this morning.
Maybe that has something to do with it.
Maybe.
I feel like I'm in a fog.
Which of these things should we be most concerned about?
Six choices for you.
Listen very carefully.
Michael Jackson's a bad dad.
Michael Douglas has a new movie.
Michael Jordan will retire.
Again.
Ward, Terrorism, and Bloodshed.
What happened to the Columbia or who'll be the next American Idol?
There are your six choices.
I think that's a great poll.
If you ask me, you're going to have to put your thinking cap on.
Don't you find that difficult?
No, yeah, I'm going to struggle with all that.
Which of these things should we be most concerned about?
Michael Jackson's a bad dad.
Michael Douglas has a new movie and of course with Catherine Zeta Jones.
Of course.
Michael Jordan will retire again.
Although we shouldn't probably put Michael Jordan on there because it's just Michael.
Michael, if I hear one more sports there on this radio station talking about Michael,
I'm going to crap in my pants.
It's MJ.
Oh, no, it's not.
It's Michael.
Oh.
What the hell do you know about it?
I heard him say it.
Ward, Terrorism, and Bloodshed.
What happened to the Columbia or who'll be the next American Idol?
So, the muff tells me that it was Joe Kostellah that keeps coming in here.
He also gets in this room.
You would say that on the air.
And he always calls or leaves a really hostile mind.
I don't care what he denies.
Who the hell else was in here?
First of all, air everything in here was like we said.
I'm sitting here playing in the beginning like always in the audience is wondering what's going on?
Are we don't hear?
Yeah.
This audience gets mad out of shape if they don't get enough of it.
Yes.
Okay, although the way things are going.
You know what I'm saying?
I don't like people to get nervous, but the way things are going, the old gas could be something we'll pass on.
And I'm not hearing anything.
Because everything in here has been dicked with over the weekend.
There's no reason for anybody to be in this room.
Is there?
No, but.
There was.
But.
But.
But they do anyway.
They just don't care.
Who do you trust most on Iraq?
Colin Powell, 63% George W. Bush, 24%.
That was a nationwide pull.
Not only does it say that they trust Colin Powell because he looks very sincere and he's a very articulate speaker.
And he never stood afraid.
He's got a reputation as being more level headed, not one of those hawks.
Not part of that hawkish crew of Wolfowitz Pearl, Cheney and Rumsfeld.
But also because of the fact that Bush has only got 24%, that to me is the more telling number in that pull.
Do you see what I'm saying?
In other words, the public, even though they want to come right out and say it, they're kind of like saying,
the movement like that.
Right?
You see him on TV and you start going, the movement like that too.
Colin Powell, you see him on here, the, hey, there's a guy who can actually speak.
He looks lucid.
By comparison.
Let me see which one I'm going to vote.
This is a tough choice on the pull.
Let's see, he'll be the next American idol.
I don't want to watch that show.
Okay, I voted.
The new pull is up there.
Let's get about 50,000 votes on there.
Terrorist alleged tired of who's saying still hazy.
That's on page 14 in the Sun Sentinel.
They, it didn't make the hero.
They didn't discover that.
Several intelligence officials who are somewhat skeptical of Powell's analysis emphasized that Zerkaui might not be a member of Al Qaeda at all.
He has not pledged allegiance to Bin Laden said when he was official.
They also pointed out that neither the Bush administration or the British government has produced direct evidence of a Iraqi involvement with the terrorist network.
I don't want to start getting too heavy due to here, too Newsy, you know what I'm saying, but it is buried on page 14 there.
And we certainly don't want to be intimidated by anybody.
Do we want to be intimidated?
No, not me.
Do we want to be called unpatriotic, something like that.
Do we want American people pointing the finger at us to say, you weren't on board.
We want everybody to be on board on this.
That's right.
And you were like not part of the game plan.
You were part of the problem. That's right.
We're running around and drag wearing heels.
WQAM.
Yeah, what is it?
I don't read anything. Do you recommend?
What do you say?
He reads everything I recommend.
Well, don't call me with a mouthful next time, whatever is in your mouth, which I, that's not even guess what it might be.
He reads everything I recommend. How do you like that?
I do.
I didn't say that we have somebody who's a great articulate speaker out there who reads the books I recommend.
Just because he's got a much mouth, I guess.
He probably was right in the middle of breakfast.
56670560.
The really conservative media.
Page 225 by Eric Alterman.
What liberal media? The truth about bias and those.
Bernard Goldberg. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I wouldn't waste one second reading that crap that he wrote.
What an ass grace.
An idiot.
I mean, you read these two books simultaneously side by each.
And then you're really, then you really know what else is going on here.
And even though I've been talking about it for months, not that any of you people out there paying attention to it,
but it's one thing to say it.
It's another thing to have the evidence to prove right in your hand.
You know what I'm saying?
What are you saying?
I'm saying they're full of crap between Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter and all of these other right-wing lunatics.
They're all full of crap. This all can try. Just lie after lie. Just make it up.
Hillary murdered this one. Bubba did this.
Oh, I saw him lie to that. And Larry came.
Let me show that again.
Made me weep.
Yeah.
It made me weep.
I was thinking to myself to paraphrase that line from the Godfather.
We used to have Bubba look what we got now. That's what I was thinking.
Yeah, you fight.
It's like that flanderer.
Yeah, yeah.
All of that crap from before he even got elected.
They were looking to do all of this stuff.
Oh, and also by the way, speaking of one of the biggest phonies of them all,
Kenny Star.
Oh!
What's his bag?
Remember when he ran into James Carville in the airport there in Atlanta?
He said, I'm going to get your boy. Watch out. I'm going to get him.
I'm going to get your boy.
Yeah.
The independent council.
Ken of Star.
Huh.
All the years that we got dragged down and we got like sidetracked and had a waste
about whether the president got a blowjob.
Who put the stain on the blue dress? Was it with Mitch Ryder?
All of that crap.
He was already going out there.
And in the meantime, we could have been taking care of business. You know what I'm saying?
He started.
We could have been taking care of real business as opposed to this crap.
Not only his right wing lunatics were doing just to bring down Bubba.
That's what it was all about.
And then when they couldn't witness last election, they found a way by hooker by crook.
See, huh?
So when I tell you that we had a bloodless coup in 2000 and people like laugh,
oh, that kneels really fine.
I mean, there's nothing funny about it at all. It's tragic because that's exactly what happened.
By the fin- what used to be labeled the fanatical fringes of the Republican Party,
the ultra-right wing lunatics who now have become the Republican Party and who now control this country.
But I just mention these things in passing. I don't want to darken your weak.
Gee, thanks.
Especially since we're under Orange Alert.
I don't want to get you all nervous and upset.
I was thinking now that they've got the video, the CNN,
now at least there is a little variety.
MSNBC puts it on the bottom right of the screen.
I don't know where Fox puts it. They can stick it up their ass because I don't watch them.
Oh, and there's some good stuff in here about great stuff about Fox and Rupert Murdoch in the Zero-Colderman book.
But nevertheless, and CNN puts it on the left.
Terror alert high.
I'm thinking, well, that's a good start.
They've got the orange thing above the CNN logo, but I'm thinking maybe a little audio.
Just to keep people on their toes since we're supposed to be have that extra level of
awareness.
Maybe that's why everybody was running up and down the hallway.
Maybe it had nothing to do with what the hell her name was.
What was her name?
Trista.
Trista. Maybe it had nothing to do with Trista. Trista. Trista.
What her name was? Maybe they were running up and down the hall because she was under Orange Alert.
Think about it.
26 past nine and five, 60 WQM.
Think about this. The fat one was in here on Friday and what is he pissed me off?
The beast.
You're a something beast.
I hope you listen right now.
You're a big disappointment to all of us.
You know how much more he lost on the balance for life?
One pound, right.
Exactly. That's what he said.
He held up one finger, which is either an indication of the number or it's a message to you beast in it.
You know something? This is our last. This is an ultimatum.
We're going to cut you off.
And if you don't get with it, we're going to give Zach the food.
And by the way, you people in the morning show talking about the Atkins, that what you know about Atkins, you could stick up your ass.
About how Zach got sick because he was doing that.
Zach got sick because he probably had like 24 cheeseburgers and 16 sirloin steaks over the weekend.
Probably a little overdoing it.
Okay. The meat and the cheese and the cheese and the meat.
Zach.
Either that or like I said, he probably had like sores on his back.
Can't imagine where they came from.
Anyway, if you want to lose the weight, get with the real weight loss program balance for life.
This is especially good.
Well, a beast isn't doing that bad. He's lost almost 50 pounds. That's not chop liver, huh?
Right. Although I don't think they do bring a chop liver on balance for life.
Sometimes I've had it. You have?
Sure. Like I said, you might if you like chop liver, pick it. They give you a little menu.
And you choose between two choices for each meal every day that you're on a program.
When I say each meal, there are five, three meals and two snacks.
And you don't have to shop. You don't have to count calories or carbs or figure anything out.
Because balance for life delivers right to your door by six o'clock every morning.
That little black sack. And that's the key to losing weight.
Little black sack rhymes with Zach and back three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks all made from fresh delicious goodies.
And that's all you have to eat all day.
And the weight just pours off your body. Like I said, the beast even though he's been really...
He's just a piece of crap. But he's lost almost 50 pounds and you can do a lot better because you'll stick with it.
But balance for life, help you lose that weight for real this year. It's a delicious way to do it.

Lee Cow, Aaron's coming.
I was standing there one day, not thinking I would die. From being able to make do do do.
I should never eat things all alone. A big back must be trapped inside my bowels.
I'll give you time from infected parts.
You let these butcher doctors in. Now my heart stops. You shouts at Sinai for my intestines out.
I guess I should have known what to expect living in Miami. With the kind of service you've given this town.
I would have been able to leave tomorrow. If I didn't eat that grass I swallowed.
Why can't you let me so you can ask? Why can't you lose us? Get it right. My bowels were blocked.
Inside my hearty can't make my turd go out.
It's good time. It's good time. It's good time.
It's good time. It's good time.
934-560-W-Q-M-Hapy Monday 2. Here's a fast muse of Kenny who's really on a ball this morning unlike Eric.
Eric must be a little out of the weather because it says tell whoever to get it right. There's no A in bloodshed.
I look on a pool. He's got blood's head. Blood's he'd.
Get that A out of there you idiot. Eric, come on. Let's get with it.
Blood's he'd. Man. Here's a fact from Fred which is one's dubious at best.
You can't debate. You can only name call. Not convincing. Finally we get one or two conservatives in the media.
And you call the whole media conservator. Well that inspires me to read this one.
Page I was going to read anyway. One or two conservatives. Right.
The media conservative media says Eric Alderman. One reason that many people including some liberals believe the myth of the liberal media is that they don't know how it's still.
It's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it's not just that it
It's not just about how an influence that exceeds their already considerable circulations.
As we've seen in earlier chapters in this book, he says nefarious political operatives, masquerading as journalists, helped turn the clintons on profitable $30,000 investment
in a failed savings in loan in a way politically paralyzing $70 million constitutional crisis.
But they couldn't have done it without the full cooperation of such mainstream media outlets is the Washington Post and ABC news, which have grown increasingly cowed by false complaints of liberal bias, and hence progressively more sympathetic to the most outlandish conservative debate.
of complaints.
When Washington Post House reported John Harris noted that he and his fellow White House
correspondents were proving far more sympathetic to the conservative George W. Borshten
and ever-bending liberal Bill Clinton, he chose as his main culprit conservative interest
groups, commentators and congressional investigators who beginning in 1993, Wage Day Remorseless
campaign, that they hope would make life miserable for Clinton and vault themselves to power.
This moment had been in the works for decades and it helped turn the tide of Washington
into a conservatism as early as 1978, when Jimmy Carter was forced to switch directions
in mid-presidency and embrace a host of measures that he had previously found to be anathema,
but during the previous decade and have conservative interest groups had grown more, both
more powerful and more conservative, outpacing liberals at first ensuing and eventually exceeding
in many cases the resources of the Old Establishment.
Liberals have no such movement, not a fraction of the money, and what troops they do possess
can both much less organizational discipline than enjoyed by the right.
As Harris noted, the left lacks the ability, if not the inclination to weave all manner
of presidential misuse, misjudgments or controversial decisions into a fabric of a lead scandal.
As a result of the context created by the conservative warriors Harris argued, stories like the
travel office firing, claimed for weeks instead of receding in the yesterday's news,
and they colored the prison through which many Americans not just considered an idea
logs viewed Clinton, and then it goes on about the cocaine thing with George W. and
about how that was just viewed as a blip on a radar scheme, all the other good stuff.
Great book, What Liberal Media, the Truth About Vice in the News, Eric Ultraman writes.
I just mentioned that in passing. Oh yeah, we can't debate it. We're not here to debate it.
We're here to state it, not debate it, okay? Fred, we don't have to debate it because it's a fact.
There's nothing to debate. All the liberal talks, all the ha- let's see, we got G Gordon Litty,
Olly North, Rush Limbaugh, Schmeck Direct, whatever his name is there, Schmitt, whatever
what they call him this week. What's the, I don't know what the guy's name is, the real
right-winger, or the Mark Sampton, or whatever. I don't even know what his name is, Shinebomb.
No, not Mark Shinebomb, the syndicated guy. You got Alice Red Tell, the self-hating fag.
You can go down the list. Who are they? The whole Fox News Network, Tony Snow,
which if you read this book, you'll find out the background of all these people
worked on the Reagan and Papa Bush administrations.
Ritt Hume, O'Reilly, the whole bunch of them. But I just made it up. I can't debate it,
says Fred, another one of them. Another one is Goose Stepping Lemmings out there.
Which of these should we be most concerned about to pull today? War, terrorism, and bloodshed,
nice going, Eric got it straight out right away. 63. He better get it straight now. I'll have
Carlos Callum again. Who'll be the next American Idol 14? Michael Douglas has an Obo. It would
just change it again. Come on. Michael Douglas has an Omovie 4. Is that the one with Katherine
Zeta Jones? The Chicago movie? What happened at Columbia, the Columbia 2? Michael Jackson's a bad
dad one. And Michael Jordan will retire again. Oh, none, the big O. Well, that's something because
other than Tristan, Tristan, and Kristen, whatever her name was. That's what they talked about all
morning this morning on a morning show was Michael, Michael motorcycle all morning.
All morning. Aren't you concerned about Michael Jordan? And the fact you only got 20 points in
the All Star game? Somehow I missed that last night, the NBA All Star game. Somehow,
you're supposed to have called me and reminded me. Oh, I'm sorry. I even watched a couple of
minutes of the rerun of a small bill. Brought a tear to my heart when Red Rock fell out of
his shirt pocket. I'll tell you that. Just when we're starting to get good. And his rock fell off.
21 till 10 at 560 WQM. Happy Monday to you. We got bad news for today, boys and girls.
We got a red alert. Not the one that nationwide. The QA and Red alert. You know what it is? What?
Joseph Gacky's on for mandates today.
Hard worst than anything Tom Ridge could warn you about. Good man, Joseph Gacky. But in fact,
maybe you want to set your alarm for three o'clock. Wake you back up again. When the Humber
comes on, Hank will be doing a show at Schulis State too today. At Brainstead,
most take two. Hercun hotline at seven. A big, uh, oh, at eight o'clock, at 8 o'clock,
at 8 o'clock, at 10 from GA and Joe and Mark overnight to the six who just leave this,
who trash the studio mercilessly. Day after day night. You have to look at the phone. He can
deny it all he wants. It's them. If it isn't them directly, it's their people. It's going on
under their watch. You know what I'm saying? Right. Under their watch, which they must not be watching.
They're watching something. Now I'm sure they are. Just like you and Carlison are watching,
you know, blind date or whatever it is all every day. That's 730. Well, whatever else comes on
after blind date. Jerry. What? Jerry. Jenny. Jerry and Jenny. That's right. And Oprah.
And guiding light and Dr. Phil guiding light and the prices right and Dr. Phil. Yeah.
And Ricky and Ricky, uh, Lake, Ricky and the lake. I'd like to toss that bitch.
Like Ricky. It would bring the lake. God. Is she disgusting or what? Now that Rosie's gone,
they moved her up several notches. Ricky and the lake. 20 till 10 at 560 WQM. If you're not feeling
too good this morning, maybe you sleep out on a really crappy mattress. Maybe it's worn out.
Maybe once upon a time it was, it was okay. But now it blows. Well, the answer is,
get you a great new name, Brad mattress from our friends, our pizons at Dilemma.
Because they carry the finest mattresses ever made in the history of the human race. And even if

So long, Hey Joe. I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying. Come on. So long.
Let it be written when Carlis writes the history of the human race,
that a time when we're concerned about the North Koreans and about the Iraq attack and
big Mac attacks and nuclear proliferation and all this other stuff, that the human race is busy
that we're obsessed with Michael Jackson. What does that tell you about us? Ed Michael Jordan.
No, they don't care about Michael Jordan. He doesn't have any votes. Only our morning sugars about
Michael, Michael, motorcycle. Thank God for Christa, Christa, whatever her name was, you know?
On and on and on. We had Michael Jordan inside out, upside down, up your ass on your plate.
Man, here's my email from Lynn Sandwells in New York who says, well, they need to get support for
this war as another attack on a homeland, preferably chemical biological or maybe a dirty bomb that
can be immediately linked to Sodom. And I live in ground zero, she says, happy Monday from New York.
Poor Lynn, I get out of there right away, Lynn. I want you to get nervous. I would get out of there
right away like now. Don't get on the subway. Take a taxi right to the airport and go to like where
she'd be saved. Like, it's connected. It's not that far away. Huh? To the airport. All I can say,
don't put the airport. Get in a limo. Red a car. Red a car west and head well west, southwest,
northwest. There you go from New York, Northwest. Right. Lickety split. Elmira would be good. Binghamton.
Binghamton will be excellent. I guarantee that I could have school with anybody in Binghamton. Not
Quebec. She's not going to be crossing no borders. Okay. Don't stick her up there with those freaking
frogs. Speaking of New York, I don't want to get her panicky or anybody else. This is in the New York
post yesterday. Suspected terrorist operatives have vowed to strike underground at the heart of
where they savored their last great victory. Sources told the post on Saturday. Don't get nervous,
Lynn. And don't ride the subway. Officials believe that two frightening phases picked up on a
phrase is picked up on a number of overseas phone intercepts indicated an attack on the New York
City subway system and it's thousands of miles of tracks and tunnels may be coming. The latest
threats are part of a prompted defense to raise the terror threat alert to high risk orange on Friday.
Bomb sniffing dog. If you tell me it's not cool to hear, maybe it's just me. Okay, the
temperature says it's not either. I've gotten pneumonia. I'm generally colder than I should be. That's
why I wear this thing. Right. But today doesn't feel any different. Monash Dhanahalallah.
Jose. Well, you're not in this room though. Right. Or maybe it's just blowing it. This
situation. Hold her in here. Maybe along with all the other shenanigans they pulled. Maybe they've
got the event just aimed right at my ass. My ass feels kind of chilly. Bomb sniffing dogs
prowled the city subway system in New York. Yeah, Saturday a traffic was sparsher than normal.
Heighten security was visible elsewhere. The terror operatives use the word underground to
describe where the next attack is likely to occur is leaving big apples strapped. What is it?
Strap hangers frightened. Oh, strap hangers. I get it. See, we would never since we're not
subway type people. Right. Strap hangers. The people that hang onto this. They're strapped.
Oh my god. I'm scared because I really think something is going to happen again. Oh my god.
Said Alexandra Gulbes 21 of Times Square station. I take the train every day. We know what I'm going to do.
I think I think she needs a what's his name? What's his name? Marlon Brando. Oh,
I don't know. Martino slacker up on the side of the face. What am I going to do?
Be a man. Well, sources that increase increase phone activity or channel raise concerns in
the intelligence community that terror mad man Osama Yamama's Elkada maybe poisons tracking
American targets. Homer braud. Yada yada. Well, we know that. New York is the top target once
for a sit-edding and that Washington is at the low end at the ass end of the list.
High ranking intelligence officials also voiced their fears that the next Elkada
struggle be with biological chemical or radiological weapons and such an attack in the subway would
create mass panic chaos and potentially kill thousands and Saturday cop stepped up security
big time in New York. Hotels apartment buildings, synagogues and other soft targets are also under
heightened scrutiny because of Elkada threats to targets with light security. How do you like that?
Well, the good news is that there's some people who've pushed up. Queen's bro community
college professor Bud Nevereau 53 by the terrorist would not drive him away. I moved back after 9.
11. I think all native New Yorkers should come back home. He said, and not a good idea?
Yeah, I knew you agree. Okay, we get behind that movement. If it's going to happen
it's going to happen. I'd rather die here and know I'll die happy. He said it's my home and I
can leave my home because of this. So while you people from New York have a good trip is what
Georgia said. I didn't say it. Georgia said it because he's a prick. A hard-hearted bastard.
We're picking on these people while they're under duress up there. Okay, so they're not going to
pick on Hollywood floor. A big deal. Most of those people- Oh, there's something. Most of those
people died already anyway. Can't kill them twice. This from the BBC talk about heartless bastards.
A plain mocking US President George W. Bush is a pajama wearing dimwit has been such a success that
its extending its run at a larger London theater. The madness of George W. mercilessly satirizes
Mr. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on their approaches to war in Iraq. The plain
out at the present theater in Islington, North London sees Mr. Bush locked in a bunker which he calls
a bunk bed while his military advisors plot a nuclear strike against Sodom Hussein. As war comes
closer to Moot among audiences, chains that actor Nicholas Burns who plays Mr. Blair,
the audience is actually laughing more but the tension behind their laughs has grown.
The show's success comes as Oscar-winning actor Dustin Hoffman joined a growing wave of
celebrities who've attacked Mr. Bush's policy on Iraq. How do you like those bloody brits, huh?
Pick it on for W. Let's go see the play. Shame on that. Now you go see the play, okay? You go
me the schmitz, they make me sick. They're a bunch of silly-ass twits is what they are. And you
think they were obsessed with tabloid crap? They invented it, right? They invented it. They
make us look like bikers with their tabloid hysteria. They've got the mirror and the sun and
this one. They must have like 6,000 tabloids they publish every goddamn day. And the queen had a
bad VM and Prince Philip is a bang in this one and you know this one is a fag and the Prince Charlie
was having the anal sex with the the butler and Diana still dead. All of a sudden crap.
Prince Charles has big ears you know a really revolutionary story like that.
They're the crazy people the brits and these are our allies. The wonder were in big trouble.
That's the best we can do is them. Just because they got naked pictures of Tony Blair and Winston
Churchill's body I mean what's the big deal with that? 5, 6, 7 look at this scream of sour here.
You think the photo we bring it off the hook on this Monday wouldn't you? No Monday. Now that's why I said
that way sarcastic. You think that these people would be just itching to talk about all these good things?
No, not in this town. They could have the bombs bursting in air and these people are still the same old stuff.
Once an ex-free spaghetti dinner or pompato park stuff like that. And by the way I don't know when it is.
Nobody Q.I.M. Neil. Yes sir. I never read it in the books but I did buy Dion Geofranque out.
Well it's a good start that's good. The garlic festival and if you put George's gay lifestyle on your pole I'll vote for that.
Okay excellent call thank you. Let's see what should we both most consider about your gay lifestyle?
We left that one off there. Now because that'll just that'll just rise to the top again.

interesting and about the the questions that still linger about his early retirement when he decided
he wanted to play baseball and Sarasota minor league baseball right but it's like everything else in
the media we get a sugar coated version of whatever they want us to know that's all you get

we get fairy tales is what we get I'm serious blinded by the right I should read the whole book
on the ear okay and they're saying and Carlos is not it I should wouldn't have any audience left
management here get all been out of shape he's reading a whole book on the ear well it's not as

brought on a uh... show on television and i
i really related to him
uh... well not because i'm a gay male but
because it seems like um... your damn if you do damn if you don't
uh... him being from a conservative background and having you know
turned around like he did a lot of people
field that he's
not credible but if you've been a liberal is like of course
they would still think you're going to be turned around like he did he was
what he was the main and
henchman all those years but they but he
but it also showed how power hungry like when he says he got the story about
a need a hill
and uh... you know he left
that guy's house after the meeting you know like exhilarated like well this
is going to be a big career thing for me you know i'm going to be a big
writer
they're all seem to be very power hungry no matter if they're lies or not
but you also read you know another woman that annoys me besides and
colder
lower in group right to read the part about lower in group
i mean she
she irritates me her voice i can't even
but i didn't know she's a bubble head she's a vacuous bubble head bitch
and she hate gays right
well
say this is the thing i don't for the life of the end of the day but i don't
understand it he was concerning with people who hated him and everything he
stood for
from bill crystal to lore anger ham to and colder right out of this and to read
some of the comments by you talk about racist and bigots i mean
some of the most virulent crap that anybody could ever imagine in their lives
and he was concerning with these people because they made him famous and they
made him a lot of money and i mean time here he was like selling out everything
that he was
exactly but i've i've met
gay guys that are conservative and i always say do you know what
you know behind closed doors what
dick chanee probably says about you
you know and and not only that um there's a lot of people that um
it's it's not just gays that that they hate i mean look at how he talks about
the the word feminist and even you have to admit i know you don't like Hillary
Clinton but i don't but he's well i've read a lot about her since she's become
senator and she's very popular in the senate they she's a totally different
person than than what they thought she was going to be
and i still don't like her but anyway but there's another book called the hunting
of the president that you haven't and it's by Joe conison and you might have
right um and it will it's it's very detailed though you know and only for
the people that really want to read about this it'll go from the beginning of
of the Clinton haters and how they organize and how this group of lawyers out
of Chicago and everything i mean it well i left out words you're melons
escaped by the way who financed all of this uh... well we would have been
guy from the scc all the people that and his cabinet all these people
a's not Hutchinson that led the impeachment assassal
Hutchinson right job he's getting now and
who's neil board
who's neil boards he's a right wing assult talk host or midland who claims to be
libertarian okay well let me just respond every time every five minutes they
tried him on put him either on CNN even donnie who had him on a wiki go
that that's the one you have no but did you see the clip that shot down he
showed where he's actually taking his mic off and leaving the show because he
did get to
get to get enough yeah and so donnie rewards him by giving him an hour
and he let's talk and talk talk talk that's because it was different okay he has
nobody watching and he's desperate well i think donnie who actually bends over
backwards to get conservative on his show to show that he's fair he had that
fascist that Steve Wallsberg from the news from newsmyster he had him on again
there than i too i don't know why he is pressing by to watch that stuff i watch it
only because i'm sitting there in amazement in disbelief that he's putting
these people on the air i know i know i know i know i already have enough air time
but but the steep solve but did you see him on when he was with the woman who
disagreed with the war and said that she still wasn't convinced any pointed to her
head and he goes the loony left yeah now you see
whoever called you last week and said well you hang up on people who disagree
you know watch those shows sometimes the conservatives and culture will never let
anyone get a word in she talks she hasn't got any idea what she's talking about not only she
a hateful miserable bitch but she hasn't got a clue what she's talking about
i see everybody's and and and sometimes you see the shows there's this religious guy
sheldon you know you would think it was a Jew with that name
he you know we were sheldon he's a fundamental Christian who thinks the Bible is it
and everybody else in the world is wrong if you have another reason why are you giving
me a list of all these people though i'm sorry have a great day bye

call us back when you see a shrub w-q-a-m hey niel yes at eight three years morning i turn on a
radio station i really listen to and there was a speech that was so magnificent against the war
i it almost brought tears to my eye really he was so eloquent he was so magnificent who was that
is going on talking he's talking about the Vietnam war and i realize my Luther King
Martin Luther King my back could come back at no i thought it was a speech from 1967
why see the great Martin Luther King speech but it could have been completely transported to now
with the Iraq war and if he knew what was going on today he turned over in his grave i know
because he says this is a pivotal point in history we cannot go the military route the industrial
military establishment is not what this country is about and he was going on it was so eloquent
it was so magnificent and he was speaking the way Americans used to speak when they were educated
you know before they were just spoon fed everything by the the the electronic media when people
used to read books and oh god it made me so so nostalgic for when people were educated and people
had minds and they thought for themselves and this was in 1967 he was so prophetic because he was
saying this is a pivotal point in history if we don't get back to our American values the world
is going to despise us and we're going to despise ourselves and we cannot go this this this
industrial material route we have to go back to being the great country we've always been
i'm not saying it the way he said it he was far more eloquent i would thank you uh hopefully
but uh it's somehow the speech and i can't believe that the anti-war activists aren't playing that
speech all the time because it's so contemporary for right now that's all i have to say okay have a

in name calling for reason conservative discourse Laura ingre hand in a merry band of imitators
would bring limbaugh meanness to millions of american television viewers stigmatizing gingrichism
as ignorant and inane Laura was also a symbol of the troubled news revolution would have
establishing a broad base to peel the women she frequently attacked feminism for making women
unhappy and resentful while betraying those same qualities in her commentary Laura stock and trade
with the politically incorrect sound bite showing up at one interview in a full-length fox coat
she mocked the squealing baby foxes which were cute when they were alive in an op edgy question
actor Harrison Ford's manliness after a fear appeared on the cover of people magazine wearing an
earring and the subjugation of women she claimed could be alleviated if more women became gun owners
some of us ingre hand once remarked are proud of a mean ease in nineteen ninety nine

mid-six figure contract he quietly struck a deal with the talented duper public writer Ruth
shallot to essentially draft the book for when shall it wisely backed out Laura was left with a
lame manuscript whose sole purpose was to hold a Clinton marriage up tomorrow scrutiny and ridicule
certainly hillary is not a good role model for women lower announced her personal life has turned
into a bizarre sad relationship where both husband and wife depended desperate and unhealthy ways
on each other at different times in their lives a more transparent case of projection i have

homosexuality which in my presence he always had seemed to be and it goes on and on and on well

Nobel winners attack Bush economics
Thank you Rob
10 Nobel prize money economist of attack president George W. Bush's tax cutting policies
Mr. Bush said his message on Monday designed to help revive the US economy and boost military spending the Congress for approval
Overcapacity corporate scandals and uncertainty haven't will continue to weigh down the economy say the Nobel economist
But the combination of cutting taxes and increasing spending will mean that the US is set to notch up record budget deficits
Greater than those run up by his father more than 10 years ago seems to run in the family
The most pointed criticism by the economist is the proposed tax cuts will not deliver what they're meant to to
To provide a boost to the US economy which is struggling to recover from recession 2001
Regardless of how one views these specifics of the Bush plan. There is wide agreement that its purpose is a permanent change in the tax structure
And not the creation of jobs and growth in the near-term the economist economist and the statement published by the economic policy institute
Nobel economic laureates Joseph Stiglitz Franco Madd Moragliani and Lawrence Klein Moragliani. I love that name
Reserve much of their scornfully proposal to cut the tax on share dividend payouts
This was a key component of president Bush's plan aimed at helping to
Sure up these struggling stock markets the permanent dividend tax cut in particular is not credible as a short-term stimulus
The statement said more over the proposed tax cuts will generate further inequalities in after tax income
It's it in other words more tax cuts for the rich
What it says like Bubba said to Larry King. I don't need it and you don't need it and Larry said
Don't be 50 dollars. How you like that? Say it again, Larry
Don't be 50 dollars. Well, I had that cranked out a little bit because I was gonna play that
Oh, look at this back kneel as it mirror does Mariah Carey have a face that looks like a bag of smashed asses

The godfather returns his tentatively scheduled release in the fall 2004
Well, that's only next year. We might still be alive then
Or not there are many stories left to tell said wine gardener 41 director of the creative writing program at fs u
Little known until now. He has the enviable chance to reach millions of new readers and the unenviable chance to let them down
No more fictional characters from James Bond to Scarlett O'Hara have been perpetuated after the author's death
There have been notable commercial successes such as Alexander Ripley's Scarlett
But few in the publishing industry found the pastime is books worthy of the originals
There's pressure just to write a good book anyway, and that's really what I'm all trying to do wine gardener said
So if it's between godfather two and godfather three
You thought I'm saying right? We got we got to figure out well how godfather two ended
Before we start figuring out what this is gonna be what era
So alpichino is coming back
Right godfather robber do all might come back because they didn't pay him enough to be godfather three
But if it's like interim maybe they can pay him enough. How they're gonna make him look younger? I don't know
Lot of tape how they're gonna make alpichino look younger stackle uh
And who else would be in it
K head clemenza dot with the author named the actress played K dianne Keaton
Most are Keaton
Most are hymen a pagoda won't see him no more
No
Can't do it Sally can't do it now. What about clemenza?
He died at some point
Between the second and the third don't we all yeah he died at some point
Clemenza died
Well, he wasn't in the third one so he didn't die from being fat though you think could be well in that line of work
You know look at all the people who were dead time Hagen was dead in godfather three
Mm-hmm clemenza and his son was the priest right wasn't his son the priest
right
Wish his father could have been here to see him now to watch him alter boys
And uh sunny of course got shot on the cross
It killed the sonny on the quay shot him on the cross where he's dead look what they did the most dead
Remember he was drinking little wine came schlepping downstairs right
Tell me what everybody else in my house seems to know my wife is upstairs crying
Consul your ear of mine
However that went you know something like that say something like that
Oh, we could get them book out and then and then the robber duvel puts his head on his crotch and something like that
Remember that right Marlon Brando seemed to be enjoying that a lot even though they had just shot Santina when it comes with
You say something about looking my head
Anyway, so that's the way but we're still can't somebody will call and let us know where the godfather to end it off
So we can figure out we can just oppose where this is going to be and of course the book is coming first see
The book is coming first. Well, that's good. Well, no, but what I'm saying is that the movie assuming that they will be one
And you can be sure that there will you can bet Carlos's life on it that they will be a godfather for
Now what about Marlon Brando and I can't be in there here we died and godfather right one
right
Maybe his ghost will come back. How about how about Barzini's you gonna be in it? No, he's dead. He'll be the ghost
I'm on my mind. No
Cheech mochi
Kunio
Anybody out there didn't see the godfather wonder what we're talking about too bad we feel very very sorry for you and for us
We feel sorry for us like Don Delabies would say because of the fact that you haven't seen the godfather
I don't care if you like two years older 200 it is inexcusable inexcusable
Good golly miss Molly. I'll use the line that I always use and I mean it as sure as I'm sitting my fat pimply as it is
Here anybody who went into the godfather and hasn't seen it not just once but repeatedly isn't alive
You think you're alive. You know a squat you haven't seen a movie you know schmaltz man

The film has won the most effective final images ever produced
It's a flashback, but see if I read that then it's gonna give it away now
Where's that I don't want to read all these pages of it
Let me just read the first part
On Matahoe states grounds in the year 1959 a funeral is being conducted Mama Krolyoni is passed away and Fredo and other family members
Pay the respects at the open coffin
Fredo wishes to speak to Michael, but it's not allowed to see him
So Connie it recedes in her brother's behalf in the boat house
Connie kneels before brother admits to her pernicious attempts to hurt him over the years
She begs for his forgiveness and insist that Michael see their unstable help us brother Fredo
Michael, I'd like to stay close to close to home now if it's all right Michael. I hate it. Baba baba baba
I don't understand because uh oh that's right they're fishing
On the pier next to the lake Fredo teases young Anthony how to catch the really big fish with a secret technique of saying a hail
Mary every time he puts the line in the water on the army base Tom meets with Frankie
Pentangely and as they share by the way a Carlos before he explained him that Mike oxley
Ox whatever that thing was
Ox long see even I can't get away now on the pier next to the lake
Fredo teaches young Anthony how to catch the really big fish with a secret technique of saying a hail Mary every time
puts the line in the water on the army base Tom meets with Frankie
Pentangely and as they share cigars and walk between two chain link fences
They glowingly speak about the great old days how the crawly only family was like the Roman Empire and how the structure
The mafia families was modeled after the old Roman legions
Yada yada yada yada when homens sat in the hot bath open up their veins and blood to death and sometimes they had a little party before they did it
Relations continue to be strained between cannerist reigns husband and Michael's home and it goes on and on and there's too many pages here
The godfather's three major enemies are killed simultaneously in a rapid succession of scenes
Crosscut between each other
Hyman Roth is surrounded by customs officials and the FBI and taken into custody as he arrives at the Miami airport
He answers a press question about the high court of Israel's ruling. I'm a retired investor on a pension
I went to Israel because I wish to live as a Jew in the twilight of my life
Another report to suggest he's worth well over 300 million dollars, but he doesn't respond directly
I'm a retired investor living on a pension
I came home to vote in the presidential election because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot as the crowd chuckles
He is shot point blank by Rocco posing as a newspaper man Rocco was shot twice and killed as he flees
Rocco had flees
Frankie pentangely takes his own life Roman style his wrist angles over the side of the tub as Fredo and Niri and Anthony get into a small motorboat to go fishing
Connie calls for Anthony telling that Michael wants to take a sanderino
Hearing that Anthony can't go. Fredo mutters. Oh, Schmidt
I don't remember that
He matters something. I couldn't make it out really. So otherwise he knew what was gonna happen. He must have
Carlos is no
Call up Mike ox long and see if he knows I keep trying to explain it to him
Oh Schmidt as Michael stands inside the boat house looking through the outer glass windows and leaves
Blow across the compound
Fredo and Niri fish together in a boat on the lake this guy's filled with dark clouds. Mmm
For shadowing
For shadowing an ominous moment. Okay
Fredo's life is snuffed up by Niri as he fishes and recites a hell marry
Didn't help Michael. Here's the muffled shot and lowers his head Niri stands up in the boat now and now we're finally getting to it
Finally getting close another 2040 60 pages
After his brothers killing Michael sits alone in the dark boat house and thinks back and flashback
Ah remember this to seeing around the old Krolyoni dining room table in their Long Island compound in late 1941
Fredo's sole support of his brother makes the murder even more tragic
It's December 7th of the day that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and the day of their pops birthday
The family awaits the arrival of Don Krolyoni in off-screen Marlon Brando sunny introduces Koro Ritsi
Gianni Russo to his brother for oh, that's right James Conn and the special appearance because he wasn't in the movie
And the reason he wasn't in the movie is because
They shot the young cause
And then the droopy thing over there is brother Michael who's the young Dartmouth educated Joe College of the family
Tessio delivers a rum frosted birthday cake for the occasion
Well, at least it wasn't a tomato soup cake but it's cooked by a grace from passions
Don't any always want to have a tomato soup cake right now what the mood is festive until Michael reveals to the second generation
Krolyoni family that he's in and listed in the Marines along with 30,000 men
Rejecting the deferment that his father had pulled strings to get out and get him out
Michael implies his legions to his country rather than his family's code
Sonny what do you think of the nerve of them japs them slanty-eyed bastards?
I'd drop in bombs that are on backyard on pop's birthday here
Badadada nannico's on Michael. I enlisted in the Marines yoddy yoddy yoddy yoddy yoddy
Why'd you do that time? Why'd you come to us?
Adada and
In since sunny slaps his brother's shoulder and then assaults him before being held back
He aggressively tells Michael break your father's heart on his birthday
Ironically, it's Fredo who supports Michael who's made a responsible
Adada like decision to be apart from the family with an encouraging handshake
Hey, that's well, Mikey. Congratulations
Michael has plans for his own future separate from his family's criminal activities and his father's plans for him
Michael is awkwardly left alone in the room at the table as the rest of the family assembles and an adjoining room and sings a surprise
For he is a jolly good fellow to the off screen Don Vito Krolyoni
A rapid superimposed dissolve shows his father Vito waving little Michael's hand from the train window as they leave the village of Krolyoni
Oh, that's a schmaltz. This is schmaltz-y
The film has one of the most effective final images ever produced the flashback ends in the image returns to Michael's face
Middle-aged prematurely old Michael now a ruthless soul as power mad and paranoid gangster in the 1959
Sits quietly and introspectively on a Tahoe state lawn chair as the cold winter approaches
He is once again alone and fully damned with all family loyalties dissolved
He's wearing his wedding ring although he separated himself from his waspicious strange wife Kay
And the disintegrated aftermath and Mikey of Ellen figure is isolated from everyone and emptied with dark brooding holo dies
His own worst enemies either murdered or alienated himself from those closest to him including his brother Frito and faithful concedury Tom Hagen
The character now I don't understand that oh
That's right you're out Tom. Maybe I can help
You're out the camera slowly zooms in for a close-up before fading to black and the film is credits. There you go

Remember that?
How come there was no a fewer about that?
There was no offer as opposed to the Italian American
and the defamation link and though John Dodge-Oll,
I've asked that before, but nobody has an answer.
Nope.
Here's another one.
This is from Eric and Kalamazoo who wants to know.
He says out there, there must be someone in Miami
who knows what they all schmaltzes.
Schmaltzes isn't cucumbers.
It's chicken fat.
Of course, schmaltzes, yet it's for chicken fat.
It usually gets mixed in with chopped liver.
Is that what I said?
I'm talking about chopped liver.
Eric, I hate to break the news to you,
but top floor day where you thought all those Jews
were, first of all, all the old Jews are dead.
And secondly, this area's been taken over by a bunch
of people who don't speak English.
What?
Who don't know for?
And they don't know schmaltzes from their ass, okay?
So don't give me that air.
Pour Eric up there and Kalamazoo freeze the zans off.
Sorry about that, Eric.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T
of rice, we're doing a little screenless Monday
and still no response.
Nothing.
367 votes on a pool.
Which of these things should be the most concerned about?
277 people say war, terrorism, and bloodshed?
Hard to argue with that.
But we'll be the next American Idol 52.
Michael Jackson's a bad dad, 16.
Michael Douglas has a new movie, 10.
What happened to the Columbia 10?
And Michael Jordan will retire again, three.
Oh!
Which you're going to be hearing a lot
about Michael Jordan on his station,
round the clock, baby, morning, noon and night.
Except between nine and one.
Didn't you hear all the stuff about him this morning?
No.
Here's our only call, WQAM.
Out of touch, liberal.
Yeah, okay.
Out of touch, liberal.
Touch this.
5, 6, 7, little hook run artist there again.
Can't handle the truth.
Can't deal with reality.
Means, mean, spirited the storytellers on the right.
Make up a bunch of crap.
Not one call on the board.
I guess we need about playing music now to 1 o'clock.
I know.
Okay.
44 minutes.
On a screen.
Screenless Monday.
Right.
I think we've, we've scraped the bottom right now.
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, no, no, I'm sorry.
We've never had a Monday like this.
We haven't.
Like this?
Oh, there they are.
Don't be giving me that crap.
WQAM.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Oh, honey, no.
Right on about Cologne, Germany and Munich too.
We were there recently and it's beautiful and good people.
Yeah.
And they just seem so way ahead of everyone in this country.
I mean, architecturally, socially, everything way ahead.
And let me tell you, you're absolutely right.
They think, Bush, they'll hold the administration.
They're psychotic fools, which they are psychotic fools.
But it seems to me reading the papers over there.
That's the only place where you can read criticism of this government and this administration.
It's unbelievable.
You don't read it here anywhere.
Are you reading Canada too, man?
Toronto, they're a slice of an ass.
In Canada and then the English newspapers too, they're really ripping him on all that.
Anyway, keep it up.
Thank you, Neil.
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, but you know, Cologne said this, but a beep, but a boop, but a boop.
And therefore we all have to go step in line because he said it.
Therefore, it must be true.
And the story about that guy that's supposed to be the al-Qaeda terrorist who hung out there in Baghdad for a while.
There it is on page 14 in the air in the Sunsendle.
Terrorist, the last time who's saying, still hazy, like, we don't think so.
We don't think so.
But they keep showing all the pools and they keep spinning it and spinning it.
And it's not a question of if it's just a question of when.
I say like about March the 5th.
Well, we already wrote your prediction, Dan.
And you'll notice what they're saying now is that even Spidey the Orange Alert went up on Friday.
They're saying, well, they're probably going to hold off on any of this.
And then as soon as we start the attack on Iraq, as soon as the first bomb falls,
as soon as the first Tonyel gets a bet out of shape, then the Schmidt's going to hit the fan.
And they'll try it out Tom Ridge again.
He'll stand up there looking like a mannequin.
And he'll say, well, we gave you a warning and, you know, I said it was so on.
And there will be more reasons to take away more rights.
Right.
And lock down everything.
Are you questioning the USA pay for you back again?
Again.
Blow up that rubber raft. He's going back.
They'll say blow up.
Coming to QAM.
Freedom in Coltor's book, Slander Jack M.
WDQAM.
Hi. Is this screenless?
Yes.
Listen, don't waste your time seeing that movie.
I mean, I already read all about Slander and Anne Coltor in this book by David Brock, OK, Schmidt.
All right. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the other guy. Go ahead.
Oh, I was going to say you don't even know me that well. They call me that, yeah.
Oh, OK.
Anyway, don't waste your time seeing that movie, Biker Boys.
Biker Boys?
With Lawrence Fishburn and Lisa Blone and Kid Rob.
I saw it last night and it's dumb. It was so bad.
I was just going to see it as soon as I left work today.
I know. I was just going to say you the time.
Don't see it.
Run my whole day.
See that movie with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell, the recruit.
Oh, I saw the previous for that. It looked like he ought to get the good.
Gone right off the stage. He was on a gone show. They'd have been yanking it.
They, you know, what's all?
It's a good movie. You should see it, but he definitely needs to get a teeth clean when they show close-ups of his teeth.
He's got some nasty bottom yellow teeth, man.
Al Pacino and his fingernails are all dirty.
I didn't want to let you know.
OK, thanks. Thanks for the good.
Since he was in that set of a woman, you know, he can't see his teeth and fingernails through it anymore.
Is that it? Yeah, that's what it is.
They didn't give him a sight back after the movie.
No, of course not. Are you crazy? That would be like Antonio getting a sight back when he comes out of his coma and passions.
What do you know about that? Not much, nothing.
Not too much. It was his very unfortunate because that could like change your turn your whole life around.
W-D-Q-A-M.
Yes.
Real Valo.
I beg your pardon?
Real Valo.
No, he's busy.
Doing a radio show.
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line W-D-Q-A-M.
Nail.
Yes, sir.
A few of my friends, and I will argue about the future form of our government, and taking the next decade or so.
The future form of our government?
Yes. I mean, all things taken into consideration while they're all threatening that it's going to be terror, taxing the country and whatnot.
And the thing is, it all started with a lot of people believe that 911 happened on purpose.
And we were talking about it.
What do you mean by that? What do you mean on purpose by whom? Well, obviously it wasn't an accident.
Well, not on purpose, but a lot of clients.
They didn't plan to plan to stop it. They let it happen.
Yeah.
Okay, regardless of that, we are arguing if our own government was pushing for something, what my friends think,
it's something like called a police state.
But what do you mean they were pushing for?
We're already in one, my friend.
We're already in one.
We live in a police state.
I mean, well, I mean, it's one like a big brother type of police state.
But I'll tell you what you think.
That's exactly describing America right now, this moment.
Exactly, but I was thinking of more of the extreme version, which I'm not sure it's called the police state.
I think the terminology is like martial law.
Right.
You know, where if this place turns into like an Israel where there'll be bombings here, left and right,
that the American probably could start screaming to see like American tanks on the street.
You know, it's not like that.
I was just wondering if you or George or anyone else in the audience might think that anything like that could actually happen in this country.
We're on our way, man.
Well, I guess we're all going to hell in the handbasket.
All right, Neil.
See if they're poor.
All right.
Got flights to hell in or out, not in the handbasket every half hour.
Read the ad colder book.
I love these hit and run right wingers, don't you?
They can't debate it because anybody and colder.
I mean, if you want to hold her up as a bastion of truth, she's a simpleton.
She doesn't know George has asked for my elbow, okay?
Just a hateful sow who just spews a lot of garbage.
But oh, it's that liberal media and see that they can't handle the fact that they're being outed.
They're all being dragged out of the closet.
If David Brockle pardoned an expression and misjudged to, oh, sorry, Matt.
5.67, self-hating.
5.67, 05.60, pound 5.60 on a AT&T and provides more of a slime.
Kenny start, the whole thing.
The whole thing is detailed right here in his book.
As if you need that.
No, no, you do need it.
I didn't think I needed until I read this.
Okay.
Oh, believe me.
All the details, all the juicy details.
Bill Crystal.
George Will, Bill Crystal, Robert Novak, and Colter, Bill O'Reilly.
Go on, Tony Snow.
You can just go on down the list.
90% of the people are talking heads you'll see on TV.
Part of this whole right-wing thing now.
Oh, but it's the liberal media did this.
Now the liberal media didn't tie up the goddamn country for all these.
Like Eric Alderman points out in his book, they felt compelled to go along.
Washington Post, New York Times.
Monica Gate, Trooper Gate.
Whitewater.
You name it.
Forget about the $70 million.
That's the least of the sins that all those years of crap.
W-D-Q-I-M.
Yo, Bill.
Yes, sir.
Hey.
Good morning to you, sir.
Listen, you mentioned passion.
I used to, I'm a young Spanish guy.
I used to watch passion.
Yeah, what happened?
I was in the...
38.
It's like they're still stuck in 2000.
It takes like two years for one week to go by in that soap opera.
Is it still the same?
No, you can make chaos working with Tabitha Knowledge.
They're down in the basement.
And they're doing it.
Oh, yeah.
They have a tabitha doing it, yeah.
When I stopped watching, they found out that Antonio was getting sick.
That's when I stopped watching it and whatever he was going to do.
I couldn't stomach him anymore.
I was just dragged away too much.
Plus, I started working.
I got a job.
That also helped.
My helps.
I got a suggestion for that.
These amazing things called VCR's tapet.
No, no, I used to record it.
I used to record it every day.
I used to record it.
I might start watching again.
Because I'm not here.
There was a lot of you.
I'm talking about passion, though.
Hey, real quick.
In closing.
Yeah.
Five, six, seven.
See what happened.
And once you stop watching passions, I told you, you better start.
It's a fun habit.
Once you turn it off.
Now, I think you might have been trying to say...
I'm not sure.
I think he was trying to say that, wouldn't he?
Senator Warren?
Not even.
Oh, you still haven't seen that movie?
No.
I don't.
I don't want to.
If you value your eyesight, don't do it.
In fact, maybe watch it with your eyes closed.
I'm being good.
No, I'm not sure.
Sounds like a woman.
Oh.
See, I want to remember Al Pacino from the Good Movies.
From when he was good.
In a good movie when he acted good.
Which is neither one of those.
Well, I'll tell you, I got a real mess here.
Who now's making up this log these days?
Is the Water Nazi back?
Oh, no wonder.
Don't mess with my log.
Okay, Water Nazi.
We won't mess with your log, honey.
Ooh.
Thinking about calling her honey.
Just the thought of that.
Makes my skin turn purple.

professionally fat people.

Porked up something like almost overnight.
In the last few years.
Here's the answer for you.
Balance for life.
The beast is down almost 50 pounds in balance for life.
By now he ought to be down about 70.
If he wasn't screwing around so much.
And I just...
I don't want to play bush boss.
But all that free food you're getting from balance for life beast.
It's going to go to like a zack.
Starting next week.

And the food too.
Going to give zack the zack.
I'm serious.
I mean, this beast guy, the character, we've been working to save his life.
And he comes in here, stomping around on Friday.
Like he's pissed off at the world.
You got to be pissed off except himself.

Not that I'm mindless, but I'm way too old to do.
I fantasize about being in bed to do.
In a dress with feet loom my man friend to do.
I'll just make up with Ginger a someday.
And then ask him to grate my buns.
Now they're no more again.
Though I would not be you from what's full.
No!
And I would not be ashamed about a Ginger and Moge union.
Just hold him and stroke him away.
Boy, they kill you're not my type.
You sound like a nine year old kid.
Hey!
Only a macho-melling guy.
You don't know me.
That makes me lift my wig your ass hole.
Ginger was a lover of mine.
I bury my bull this rainy nose.
Inside his pimpley rear end.
Now I would not be a sport old.
Now!
If I was not to cause it to the face.
That's why a Ginger and Moge union would make me feel dizzy and gay.
Everybody follow my thousand calls.
Yeah, Ginger and Moge union would make my sorrows pony ass feel safe.
If we had a Ginger and Moge union,
then he wouldn't have to get me raped.
Love a thirty three at five sixty at every QM.
Everybody on edge of their seats waiting for Joseph Gackie.
He'll be along for Mad Dog a one.
Are you any edge of your seat?
Yeah.
US plans for use of gas in Iraq.
Top US military planners are preparing for the US to use in
capacitating biochemical weapons and invasion of Iraq.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers
cheerfully join Chiefs of Staff reveal the plans in February 5th testimony
before the US House Armed Services Committee.
This is the first official US acknowledgement that it may use biochemical weapons
in its crusade with other countries of such weapons.
The Sunshine Project, another non-profits have warned since late 2001
that the warrant terrorism may result in the US using prohibit biological
and chemical armaments thereby violating the same treaties it purports to defend.
The US announcement creates grave concerns for the future arms control agreements
especially the Chemicals Weapons Convention.
And the UK independent says a group of British MPs have underlined the double standards of
US policy toward Iraq by highlighting Washington's own non-compliance with chemicals weapons inspections.
An early day motion to Parliament signs so far by 34 MPs today said they were
concerned about the US government's prohibited access by verification inspectors
to several chemical industry sites and signing the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993.
The reason cited by Undersecretary at the US Bureau of Industry and Security in October
2002 was that they were protecting proprietary information of US companies.
How do you like that?
Wow, there you go.
Just mention those things in passing.
But everybody's on board, baby.
Right?
We're going in there and kick some ass.
5,670560, £560 on a AT&T line.
WQAM.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
To help me, I'm much more secure in the end today with the orange alert.
I'm trying to find the airport.
And I hope you're not trying to fly out anywhere in the near future.
Why is that?
The line heading into MIA is out onto the June from both directions.
Really?
Yeah.
So that people like myself who used to fly around the state in as of last week,
because they were still flying into the terminal and fly out as you plane to be gone.
You're looking, I would guess, I'm not flying today.
At least an extra hour, I want to have doubling those long-distance, damn parking garage.
Oh my god.
Wow.
Bad news.
Okay, thanks for the good news.
They say close to home.
Definitely.
Okay.
There you go.
Well, see, we don't have who should take that off the pull from Friday.
That's the pull I sneaked in there.
If you plan on going anywhere, forget about it.
This is what he's trying to say.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a gate TNT, and Verizon Wireless Line.

Subways?
I think the Abhinant, maybe the tunnels in New York?
Oh, no, thanks.
Not for me.
Now I'm not talking about going here.

A lot of things you could do down there.
Seren gas?
Right.
Explosions that cause things to collapse.
WDQAM.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hi. How are you?
I'm doing okay.
I want to say something about the Godfather.
Now they never told me how Plum ends a died.
I looked it up on it in more of my books.
Did it?
Did you know how he died?
He died from fat.
He died from fat.
I think just like Eli Wallach, he had one can only do many.
I read the article about the Godfather IV.
I don't think it's going to fly as well as the first.
I don't think anybody can do it as well as Manitusa can do it.
Well, first of all, then Michael, all of...
How do you do this with the age thing?
Godfather II was in the 70s.
And here we are 30 years later.
How they're going to make Michael look like we pick up where we left the...
Unless they bring all new characters in which is going to leave us limp.
They're going to have to bring the sun in the sun.
It's going to be interesting.
I've got to ask you a question so you can know it.
You know Richard Caspon obviously played Clemenza.
Yeah.
What's the only movie he was nominated for in Academy Award?
No clue.
A movie called Lovers and Other Strangers.
He played a father and a Callian father in the movie.
Okay.
I just...
I just...
I just...
I got so that I'm going to make trivia books.
I'll put that in my memory bank.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Take care.
See, he died from fat.
Hey, George is looking up at a godfather book and it says...
It's only a million references to him in here.
Yeah.
One of them's got to have what he died of, right?
Of course not.
He died from fat.
You had friends who died from fat?
Yeah.
Well, what about him?
What about him?
Oh, is he talking about the hair?
First, he's talking about the hair.
And he's talking about the hair.
First, he's talking about the hair.
First, he's talking about the hair.
And the hair is on the line of work.
Yeah.
That was a great scene.
That was a great scene.
But your life can end prematurely.
You don't want to do it anymore.
I'm going to die.
5,6705,60,
pound 5,60 on the AT&T
and Verizon Wireless Line.
Nobody to QYM?
Yay, sir.
Richard S. Costellano did not die of anything
but the same thing that can't do all out of three.
Money.
That's correct.
He would not take the deal they offered.
so that's why
frankie pentangeles part
was a rewrite of
clemenza's part for godfather too
he he also thought he was well let's face it devolves one of our greatest actors
right cast a lot of
i don't i don't buy that i think they should have had richard k should have been
intercom and that was an important part of the movie
yeah well by the time you pay the chino and
kittin and devol and everybody else yeah you know what one of my favorite
things about this movie is that the first one
synatra fought against is so hard because the story was embarrassing
right i think the third one he was begging to be in it
really yes do you know that he never spoke to al martino again
well good
not that's true he never spoke to al martino again but he begged him not to take
that rule because it was about him in the movie from her to eternity
and how many girls see the irony about that is you know who they wanted to do
the from here to eternity instead of synatra al martino no you know i wallick
oh my god oh my god wow what comes around goes around that kind of
he ate the canola is okay that's right leave the gun bring the canola have a great
day bye bye five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t and

a lot of people that right wing hate that it says you know that the and wait till you
for sentence you know that the terrorist regimes of a rack and also my being
handled where they have to be handled i didn't know that the osama had a regime
that's number one a north side they have to keep linking the two together right
of course just by saying so that that makes it together if clinton had had any
balls this would have been handled during his terms you're only spewing your left
wing propaganda because it's a right wing republican doing the dirty work face the
music deal you claim to be affiliated with no party when i ever say that i said
that both parties suck i never said i wasn't registered democrat which i was
having all my life and always will be
but you're a left wing liberal democrat all the way to your bones yeah and what's
the point that that's a left uh... go ahead i'm sorry to be left wing liberal
democrat not just a liberal democrat or not just a democrat or not left wing
liberal a left wing kamy pinko fag democrat we left that out
so that the same clinton that was launching bonds at al-Qaeda and the republicans
were saying that he's trying to wag the dog because he's right yeah
he was trying to change the subject because we had him with all the goods
okay on penis skate and white water and monica gate and every other guy
then gate that ever came down to practice in the including the paul of jones
story that's another reason you have to know all the comrade jones thing that's
important yeah another reason to read this book
totally fabricated anything that went on that hotel room was consensual
but never less as if that's got anything to do with the presidency what he did
don't you understand this is the way they bring everybody down don't you
understand that when somebody turns like a needle turns the tables on clearance
Thomas we uh... manufacture up the story character as i think the fact
your stories like the real need a hill by david rock which turns out to be
totally full of crap fabricated but don't confuse these people with the facts
because there are much i did ahead lot that that that that that just make it up as they
go along
not only about all the fact is that they facts over the rush that he read verbatim
on the year stuff that they just made up manufactured read it right on the

the orange alert made me wonder again why the bush administration spent the last
year and a half hyping the Iraqi menace instead of single mindedly hunting al-Qaeda
mister bush's presidency came into focus when he made his bullhorn vow to get
the people in octaves buildings down but we're not getting the creeps in octaves
buildings down we're getting the creeps who's addressed we know most
americans are willing to give mister bush's war even other dubious that little
curb terror and cn online poll poll shows that eighty two percent in going to
war with a rack will provoke another attack on the u.s. as opposed to thirteen
percent who think it'll prevent one
the orange alert was expected were about to invade an occupying Arab country
so islamic radicals all around the world are angry at us that's also why the
FBI warned Jewish leaders on a Friday that synagogues in Jewish owned hotels

get better by setting up our military in a rack one said we can get rid of the
weapons and squalps the sources of terrorism and we can send an example to other
countries if you cooperate with terrorists or menace and menace us in any way
we're even a cross-eyed at us this could happen to you the bush team is
infatuated with solving old problems israel terrorism oil in a bold new way
Americans in the allies have been watching st. colin for months no one knew if
he was softening the velocosity of the bush in a circle or if the inner circle
was using him as the human shield for its plan to change your history but his
appearances at the you in and on Capitol Hill last week general Powell played
general patent the case was less persuasive than the presenter and it wasn't
clear why the presenter had jumped to the war like side but if the man who always
resisted occupying a rack and succumbed to the plan to occupy a rack more diplomacy
as a charade once they scratch their Sodom itch maybe the bush team can zero
in on the terrorists who put us in code orange and North Koreans will put us on
nuclear notice meanwhile Iraq had better ratchet up its own alert

what liberal media the truth about bias and news by Eric Alderman, yes I know for Biscum.
Oh. He says in 1985 Murdoch acquired 20th Century Fox Studios in much the same way he acquired
the New York Post with lots of cash and some crucial political interventions from the politicians
he funded. He combined the company with the fledgling Metro media television stations to
launch America's first new broadcast network since the early days of TV. Fox was given every
break imaginable throughout the 1980s and the grounds that a new television network should
be encouraged. Finally in 1994 following nearly 10 years of indifference the FCC checked
into the network's ownership to see if it was foreign owned. It was Murdoch's news corporation
was actually an Australian company out in the American one as he had portrayed it. But rather than
allow the commission to enforce the law according to Reed Hunt and FCC Chair, conservative Republicans
lambasted me for the audacity of having looked into the question. While some of what the Fox network
produced has been genuinely great, most notably the Simpsons, much of its programming appears
devoted to answering the question just how low can you go? Conservatives like William Bennett
and Pat Robertson and direct condemning liberals for the promotion of casual sex and alternative
lifestyles of the expensive societies bedrock social institutions like marriage and courtship.
But Robertson has no more powerful and influential enemy in this regard than his business partner
in the Fox Family Channel. In the spring of 2000 the network that invented studs,
the dating show with stripping men, managed to amaze even its critics with who wants to marry a
millionaire. Here women were invited to prostitute themselves in the base the institution of marriage
for the greater glory of Fox's ratings. It almost didn't matter that the programs producers
went about this task entirely and competently as the alleged millionaire was no such thing but
did have for you a few restraining orders in his past. The marriage was never consummated but the
bride did get to pose naked in playboy. A year afterward Fox managed to about do itself in the
cultural debasement sweepstakes with the debut of Temptation Island in which four committed
couples were dumped on an island and filmed canoodling in various combinations.
From the outset the network's news programs demonstrate they similarly catalyc
interpretation of the term family values when it came to reeling in viewers and hence profits.
Its original flagship occurred in a fair erased much of the journalistic rule book
as Bert Kerns one of its top producers later recounted in order to get a copy of a tape alleging
to show the actor Rob Lowe having sex with Sangyong women of jailbait age. The 1988 Democratic
Convention in Atlanta the producers lifted footage from Atlanta station and claimed it was its own
paid-a-club owner for the sex tape even though he had no legal ownership and physically
destroyed the evidence in the face of a lawsuit. As Kerns puts it the Rob Lowe tape was a milestone
for the show in tabloid television sex celebrity politics crime or LED mercas of session with
home video cameras were all rolled into one. We were the effing champions of the world. In fact
the events caught on tape didn't really take place in Atlanta but were filmed in France
there were no underage girls involved and hence no story but nobody ever reported that.
Details aside Kerns was right the conservative Roger Ailes the former Reagan Bush aid who
then went on to head Fox News Channel said he didn't believe that such shows even required defense.
News is what people are interested in Ailes said we're just getting the same girls to dance around
shiny or poles. Despite this rather tricky track record family values wise when Mordock began Fox
News Channel in 1996 with Ailes at the helm conservative fell all over themselves to praise it.
If it hadn't been for Fox I don't know what I've done would have done for the news
Trent Lott dush during the Florida election recap George W. Bush extooled Bush one aid turn
anchor Tony Snow for his impressive transition to journalism and especially taped April 2000
tribute to Snow Sunday morning show. The right wing heritage foundation had to warn its
staffers to stop watching so much Fox News on their computers lest the entire system crash.
The conservative orientation to Fox is invaluable to the right not merely because Fox
offers the spin on reality conservatives prefer to have people see in here but also because it
helps pull the rest of the not terribly liberal media in its direction. Earlier I discussed the key
role played by Fox and its election analyst George W. Bush's loyal cousin John Ellis
in Huffin create the media stampede to call the election for Bush but the hiring of
Ellis was no isolated incident rather with symbolic of businesses usual. For instance when
just before election day the media discovered that George W. Bush had been hiding a DUI conviction
Fox seemed to spin the incident even more furiously than Carl Rove and Kirin Hughes.
Morton Kondraki of Rulekall called it a footnote. John Fonda the Wall Street Journal a blip
Mara Liyas on a NPR yes I agree with that I think it's a blip. The program in question Fox
special report with Britt Hume did not even bother to devote much attention to the potential
election altering news instead it focused once again on trebles Al Gorehead and fighting
off Ralph Nader. When it did return to the story the FNC the Fox News channel
has been focused on the Bush's campaign charge that the Gore team had somehow engineered the leak.
FNC's Tony Snow went so far to give credence to rumors that the Clinton administration had been
involved and predicted this might help the Bush campaign by creating sympathy for it and
therefore backfire on Gore. Snow never cited a shred of evidence for any of these claims which
was wise as nonexistent. Meanwhile FNC's Paul Azon used a lot on the question of just how
long main Democrats had set on the story. In fact it was the local main newspaper where the
reason we cannot know. As Eric Boler noted all this spinery and a damage control is indeed a far
cry from the days during the head of the Clinton scandals when former FNC correspondent Jeb Duval
according to his account New York magazine was once met by a news producer who came up to me and
rubbing her hands like Uriah Heep said let's have something on whitewater today.
Such fairies however the norm for a station where special about foreign policy is hosted by Fox
commentator and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Heroes and irregular series is hosted by
Gingrich's ex colleague in the Republican Congressional leadership John Kasich and on the real
Reagan a panel discussion on Ronald Reagan hosted by Tony Snow all six guests were Reagan
friends and political aid plus the ever-present Ali North. Fox's coverage of the conflict
in Afghanistan is similarly slanted but also kind of crazily flawed. Most famous of course was
the incident which Rolder Rivera missed the spot of the hallowed ground from which he pretended to
be reporting by a mirror 200 miles. Just let it expert expert what liberal media the truth about
Biden news by Eric Alderman hardcover it's out go by 10 copies today.
5670560 now I pick the bad date of quitsniff and glued.
pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon lined up at a QAM.

Hi Neil.
Yes sir.
You know talking about the liberal press you know you can read stuff on
you know websites like Buzz Flash.
Yeah.
You will never see in the media like I saw something over the weekend
about the new Hampshire Republican party.
You know how on election day people call in to get rides to the polls.
Yeah.
Well the Republicans hired a company to call into the democratic lines and
high up their lines so people couldn't call in.
Yeah.
So but you know this is kind of something that's been happening for like last
couple elections you know they've been the last couple.
Well you know the Republican why don't you understand that they're all a bunch of
crooks don't single out just the Republicans they're all a bunch of
crooks from the way Joe Kennedy fixed the 60 presidential election they're all
a bunch of crooks.
Yeah but the Republicans have been.
Anybody lives in South Florida should understand that election
crooks it's like goes with the territory.
They've been handing out these pamphlets in black neighborhoods saying you
know you can't vote if your rent isn't paid or you know that happened in
St. Louis and Baltimore.

Okay. We're going to get started in really parked off WDQM.
Hi Neil. How are you doing? Thanks for reading some of those stories. They're truly frightening.
Truly frightening stuff. I called you a couple of weeks ago and wanted to mention to you that watch out for Friday evenings because that's when the Bush administration releases all of its real knockout punches.
Did you hear about the Patriot Act 2.0? Yes. That they're going to sneak in.
All the speakers have to be given the copy of it and the Democrats are outraged that they're finding out by surprise.
Well I think that it's pretty funny because if you saw the Bush administration's reaction on the weekend to France and Germany possibly putting in NATO troops and NATO inspectors and guards into Iraq and the Bush administration was outraged
at such a sneak attack and that the way that they found out about it was through the media. Well that's how they treat the Democrats.
Yeah. Exactly in the same fashion. And as far as the blinded by the right, it's extended not just into the media but all throughout this Republican government where the fair and balanced approach is the approach that they're using.
On fair and balanced, all spin all day. Absolutely correct sir.
Okay. Have a great day. Good luck to pal. Squeeze that passport real tight till it bleeds.

More than 700 women oppose new to protest against Australia's likely involvement in a potential
war against Iraq.
We're saying out today that there are other, what is all the pictures of Mayahu.
Lying naked end to end on a grassy, no-oil in the Australian beach town of Byron Bay
Saturday, they formed a heart around the words, no war for an aerial photograph.
And here's the picture right here, which you can enlarge and make it poster-sized.
Australia has sent troops and improved fighter jet deployments to join US and British
forces in the Gulf, preparing for a possible yachty-aughty yachty.
The women ranging in the age of 20 to 60.
Oh, oh, 60.
Gathered on the hillside and the beachside artist, Haven in the far north of New South Wales
State.
One middle age woman had the words, bear it off with the voice down under written honor
back.
And acute?
Yeah.
Bear it all down under.
Bear all ass.
I really realize now that I look up here and see all these women, they're desperate
to let our Prime Minister hear how very angry they are and what he's doing and how much
they disagree with what's happening, Organizer Grace Knight told.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio.
A local police spokesman said the protest was on private property and not visible to
the public.
Night's scenario photos would be distributed to the Garter publicity for the women's
stance and Prime Minister John Howard should recall Australian troops already deployed
them at least.
That's Organizer Grace Knight, no relation to Grace Slick or John S. Knight.
I like that.
I like it a lot.
They're a lion stark naked to protest.
And I think that every young woman in South Florida ought to probably do the same.
Maybe what's their Tristicon start to deal, huh?
At the beach at the malls out here in the parking lot.
Now was she fully clove when she was in this morning or not?
I didn't see her.
Was she wearing her QAM QD outfit?
I doubt that somehow.
Sure raised a lot of fear in history and air this morning.
I'll say that.
I know.
Got to spell it when you say it.
F you.

Now when I'm sold mysteries emptied, one of the oldest and most bizarre of all unsold mysteries.
History of why Michael Jackson is constantly making those strange and annoying sounds in the middle of his songs.
And now with the latest album, Her Story.
Not history, her story soon to be released.
The enigma continues.
No exception to this is Michael's latest single of the album's screen with a sister Janet.
Amidst the usual chaotic lyrics and driving beat.
Our producers here at Unsold Mysteries counted no less than 33 whoos in more than 15 groaning noises.
Millions of fans of Michael Jackson might ask themselves, what does it all mean?
Could it be Michael has some sort of medical problem?
Perhaps it's an offshoot of Tourette's syndrome or just the annoying whalings of a confused and gender questioning man-child.
And yet another question.
Does Michael make these distracting, hard sounds in everyday life or just when singing?
For example, might this happen in a restaurant?
Does it like, I'll have the prime rib?
And a big potato with sour cream?
And for dessert the custard pop?
The real thing.
The real tragedy is that some of his finer songs about helping poor children worldwide are greatly spoiled with those distracting.
Oh, half the children make the world a better place to live.
Oh, any, ha!
Anybody has a clue as to why Michael continues to make these god-of-all noises?
Why this man is so annoying?
Please call Unsold Mysteries.
Oh, ha!
I think I got an idea why does it-
He's an asshole.
Anyway, 1246 so I forgot to mention, because I did tape on my Tivo, uh, Eltervision, whatever.
The show that I missed right at night.
Or Thursday.
And what night was it on?
Michael's acting Thursday.
Oh, that thing.
You saw it, right?
I loved it.
I mean, I flipped back and forth.
Okay, well let me just say this right now.
And I've actually seen all of it from the beginning to end.
How could any person in its right mind believe any of that?
In other words, this whole thing was so staged, it was pathetic by him I'm talking about in his end.
They thought they were going to have it to our infomercial.
The part in the beginning where he's asking him about writing the music and he starts dancing.
I didn't know whether to scream, to cry, to kill myself, to put a rock through the TV screen.
You know the part I'm talking about?
Yeah, yeah.
He's dancing.
And he's, uh, he's showing his powers.
His powers and dance.
And of course you did, you did know that he was going to be outraged.
Oh, of course.
And the way it was presented because if he wasn't outraged, that would have been it.
That would have been the end of it.
But now he's got a video about the filmmaker guy.
Right.
Now it has to go on about how indignant he was and about he was promising.
And his friend Yuri Geller, who's busy spending spoons and singing about Michael's acting.
Correct him.
Can you believe, talk about an interesting, I don't know.
I don't know.
Yuri Geller and Michael Jackson together.
They're bending the tailor.
Yeah, yeah.
Don't leave that bitch out.
She won't have it.

I'm not feeling the greatest today.
I feel like I died overnight.
Nobody told me about it.
I think it's that stuff has come in through the vents here.

Well, there's so many fags over there.
Sydney has the largest gatebox.
Well, I don't like count.

Can't you handle the truth?
Are you going to do that Jack Nicholson routine?
I can handle it.
Can't you deal with the truth?
I find it sad.
I don't find it funny.
I find it tragic.
After reading this book by David Brock, this closeted homo, who became a tool if I can use
that term of right wing extremist and now be moans the fact that he helped to bring
this country through all those years of this crap based on lies and bull crap.
Lies!
Stuff just made up.
And now because of the fact that they turned on him and even after they forced him out
of the closet and they even for awhile and let him ride on his coat tail so there's

what do you think it was?
You faggot!
Right.
So it's not as though he voluntarily came to his senses and did the right thing or did
the sense of a more decent thing?
I don't understand that.
