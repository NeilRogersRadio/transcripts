stevey nix the distinctive voice of fleet woodmack her style is unforgettable
her lyrics are intelligible
when they hear the man laughin' the man laughin' up and down
the man laughin' the man laughin' up
stevey's back with all your favorite hits on one big album
it's stevey nix what the hell is she sayin'?
Yes, all her classics are here.
You'll get me, big red and the incomparable red.
Gidgetly, remumble for stereo in audibility, this is TVX at her most nebulous.
What the hell is she saying?
Available now.
What in coherent records of this?
Now you're probably wondering how come I played that oldie?
Here's the answer for you.
Stevie Nicks rates the notorious Madonna Britney kiss is the most obnoxious television
moment ever.
Okay.
How do you like that?
Does anybody care what Stevie Nicks thinks?
First of all, Madonna is too old to be kissing someone who's 22 of the Fleetwood Max singer
told the Harold Sun.
He never stopped me.
And Britney should be smarter than that.
Hopefully she'll figure a way out of this hole.
She has dug for herself.
I love that line.
Maybe Clarence can do the same thing too.
She's got a digger self out of the Dottas hole.
And Britney should be smarter than that.
Hopefully she'll figure a way out of this hole.
She has dug for herself.
That's them.
Wow.
Man, I don't even want to think about that whole topic.
That's a pit.
Original Rock Chick, Nicks 55, said Spirits and Christina Aguilar should wear more clothes
and try writing decent songs.
Shut up, Stevie.
I personally have never been to a strip club, but I turn on MTV and I see in every single
video what must be like to be at a strip club, Nicks, said, which is why people are watching
it.
Oh, right.
Come, bitch.
I think the mystery is gone.
And if you have no mystery, then you already have been sexy, she said.
Real sexuality and sensuality is in the music.
And these girls, these are the Britney Spears, Christine Aguilar and Anna-Non.
She'll go back to writing songs and start over because it won't last and they won't
last.
Says Stevie Nicks.
What's her latest hit?
He just played it.
When they're 55, they won't be around in that said because I think a lot of those girls
are very talented, but they're signing their own death war in Stevie, says.
Nicks was appalled by Madonna's publicity stunt, Kiss With Spears, at the recent MTV
awards.
I thought it was an off-top, noxious moment in TV history, she said.
It's in the story twice just in case you missed it the first time.
Madonna will be fine.
Madonna is Madonna.
She does what she wants.
She'll get over this.
But will Britney get over it?
I don't know.
She said.
I don't know.
Next revealed Madonna and Jennifer Lopez to be in this moochie routine, but JLo told
Mag to kiss something else, as in maybe her fat.
Next is the ultimate rock survivor, weathering drug addictions, depression and a tumultuous
relationship with Lindsay Buckingham.
It says, Fleetwood Mac performs at Rod Laver, Arena, February 23rd, tickets to OnSale
Monday.
Rod Laver, I'm assuming is like in Australia, because this is the Harold Sun, it's
some Australian rag.
So there you go.
That's a good place for her down under.
I think Muff started a little concerto with me in Feral, don't you?
What was he babbling about?
That you knocked on him for running away?
See, I knew it.
I knew that Duff absolutely.
What an asshole, Duff.
Duff, get off this instant.
All I said was go in there and tell Robert or today it's Zach whoever's running aboard
to get the last break over between.
So right away this man like a child takes it personally and we don't even go across
over today because I'd like it then to get the spots over by the time the show starts.
Well, it's his fault, huh?
It's his fault.
What?
Ferals.
There's no question about it, but I'm not looking to start a thing.
All I'm saying is like a minor thing.
Just get the spot break over.
So when people tune in at 10 o'clock the year to show, we're not in the middle of a spot
break.
That's just the way it's done.
It's called a radio business.
That's just the way you do it.
The crossover can go, I know we're not in a radio business.
I know that.
That's why I had a radio nightmare last night because I went QAM.
I mean, we're not asking anything extraordinary or unusual there.
That's all.
Just get the spots out of the way before we come on and do the crossover, which maybe
there ain't going to be any crossover.
And if that's what he wants, hey, life goes on.
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, he doesn't care.
Well, then what was he all been out of shape of?
He's happy to have something to harp about as you.
Oh, good for him.
Sounded to me like he was a little porky this morning, huh?
Maybe he didn't get a freebies there at the U of M.
Whatever that place was that he was plugging over and over again.
What that was?
That joint don't say it.
What?
He sure learned quick.
This guy.
He's got the Toyota place.
He's got the U.M. place with a gift shop.
And he's back to man.
I scored Scott.
You learned quick.
Good going, baby.
Lisa McLean.
Now this is the first.
Oh, I guess I better do the results from the poll.
How do I do this?
How do I do it, George?
I get all the first one is so many goddamn names that dead musician thing.
And then we got a preliminary one today because we're going to do dead, just dead
general people, not dead generals, but like, you know, I guess it could be.
But the way not to interrupt and it really doesn't have a lot to do with anything, but
we may or may not have the ability to play commercials in the entire radio station today.
Just mention that in passing.
Go ahead.
Back to what you're doing.
Oh, and you wonder why I had a radio to nightmare last night.
You know, I've been doing this for about a hundred years.
This radio crap and it is crap.
And periodically I'll have a nightmare and it's always a variation of the same thing.
And one last night was I'm on the air in a station where nothing would be equipped and
it doesn't freaking work.
I realize that's an answer is totally incompetent.
I hate this place.
Nothing works here.
Yeah, that's had a bad deal.
And I got a record playing and a record that the turntable just stops right in the middle.
It just stops.
Wow.
And there's dead air and I'm looking around and I'm trying to find something else to play.
And it's the same recurring nightmare over and over again.
Or like the one I used to have is I'm like a this jockey, but I can't find any music to
play.
So I keep playing the same record.
And I'm looking around desperately trying to find something else and I can't find any
music which I've worked on stations like that as a matter of fact.
We had like about seven records.
Yeah.
And you're doing a six hour music show and you got seven records.
Oh, God.
So anyway, it figures it's a QAM thing.
So we may not be able to play spots.
Right now we have Zach standing by in the control room to play the spots out of there.
The Zach is squatting by in the control room.
The only problem with that is.
Yeah.
Well, they can't play spots out of there either.
So we can have somebody play them from the bullpen, but yeah, can't play spots out of there
either.
Well, ask me if I care.
I see how I don't I don't overreact to these things anymore because I've been on QAM
almost six years now.
And when I sit down with my ass in his chair, I expect technical ineptitude and I'm very
rarely get disappointed.
Everything on this end works great.
No problems here.
I think what we're going to do is just find out.
Toronto studio is working at El Primo, baby.
If and when it comes back.
We'll just run a 20 minute spot break at the end of the hour.
In addition to which I didn't knock on him for going over all I said was tell Robert
whoever the guy that boredop is in there get the spots to last spot break done before
the show ends.
That's all.
That's just the way it works in a business and like a real radio station, which I realize
we are.
But we're at least put on a good act.
God.
Duff.
I think Duff screwed it up.
He got the throw all bent out of shape.
Now Duff's going to be crying and there.
Oh, gee, I tried.
Then what he told me to I went in there and I told that.
Yeah.
Duff's going to be because Duff's an emotional cripple.
He's a good guy, but he's an absolute basket case and emotional cripple.
That's from hanging around with Greg Reed too many years and Tanner of course.
And you better watch it, Mr. because you're in the Tanner building.
Lisa McClellan.
This is from Oakley, California.
This is why I'm doing the first poll.
Let's do the first poll up there before I read all this other crap from Fridays.
Oakley, California.
Lisa McClellan says she isn't erasers.
She says her campaign for a Caucasian club at her California high school is to move toward
diversity, not bigotry.
She says everyone is invited and nobody will be excluded.
Like Harvey Pack would say, nobody picked six.
Remember Harvey Pack?
No.
McClellan's ethnic background includes American Indian, Hispanic, Dutch, German, Italian,
and Irish, I'll still believe.
She says she and her friends feel slided by other clubs at Freedom High School in Oakley,
such as the Black Student Union and the Asian club.
Signatures of support from students, it also and other since announcing her plans three
weeks ago.
One person who won't be signing up is Darnell Turner.
Learned in the spell with Darnell.
Darnell Turner first vice president of the local chapter of the NAACP.
Turner says he thinks the club will create racial tension.
Boy!
How do you like that?
So our first poll today should Caucasian only clubs and groups be permitted.
In the US, they got five choices on here.
Absolutely not.
It's bigotry.
Why not?
There are groups for minorities.
It seems a bit clannish.
That's with a K.
Not in schools are publicly funded places or will blood tests be necessary.
That's the five choices on our first poll today.
Got it?
Got it.
Okay.
Well, she, I, we've talked about this many, many times.
There's the, what do they call the, the Negro College Fund?
You said that like that.
The Negro College Fund.
Yeah, the United Negro College Fund.
Well, if there was like a United Caucasian College Fund, right off the bat, a bunch of
Pico, Cami, a Fag, assholes, I mean, oh, it's a racist thing.
There are a bunch of clans.
You know, I think white folks on, you know, have a shot or two.
By the way, speaking of having a shot, I got the Al Franken book finally lies in the
lying liars who tell them all I haven't gotten far into it, but just to give an idea of
how good it is, the name of the second chapter is an culture nut case.
Okay.
Okay.
I might start reading passages from that.
I'm not doing that swillery book no more, but I might start telling them about it.
I'll go for that.
Oh, that's good.
It's great stuff.
Al Franken, who just, the Rips and Ass, finna, Nazi bitch and colder and all these other
right-wing phony below these bill or Riley's pictures on a cover, by the way.
Rips him a good ass.
Good.
In fact, the lies and the lying liars who tell them all there's and in the upper left,
there's a bush in the upper right, far right, bill or Riley down there and Dick Cheney.
And anybody saw 60 minutes last night what a penetrating piece about Halliburton and
the, and the backtail and Cheney and Wolfowitz and Richard Pearl and all the other dicks.
That's the deal, man.
And just like I told you before, the show, you ought to rewatch the movie network.
Just watch the scene in the ITT boardroom.
We're Ned Bady is sitting on one end of that long table and Howard Beagle is sitting
on the other one, Peter Finch.
And Ned Bady says to Peter Finch, he says, the world is a business, Mr. Beal.
That's all you need to know.
If you watched that piece last night, the world is a business and the rest of us were just
little paws in a chess game.
We mean nothing.
We mean absolutely nothing.
So remember what I always told you, boys and girls, your life is only as important as
you decided it is to yourself because in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't mean
crap, okay?
Unless you got the really, really big bucks.
I'm talking about big, big, big, big bucks.
But there's the mouth readers on line nine.
Too slow though.
So I give him a chance, I give him a window of opportunity there.
And he didn't take the chance to jump through it.
I wish he would, though.
Wish he'd open it up and jump right out.
Trump and his past 10, at 560.
Now what's the deal?
We're going to just so I know we got spot.
I think we'll be all right.
Oh, coming from, coming from Scott.
So you sure, yeah, that's sorry, assuring, coming from you.
By the way, tell your boyfriend, equitbeant, such a, maybe it's time of the month for
her, huh?
Could be.
God, Celah had his knickers in her and a ringer this morning just because we wanted to
get to spots over before the show starts.
That's all unreasonable.
You know, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not going to fall.
Stop it now.
You know, yeah.
A greedy bastard was really showing his age.
He doesn't have a, they poured him in of him way.
He can get you.
If you don't work like a slave, you're hard to do.
You should bag.
You should bag.
He got it, died it.
Back in 15, night for pay, hold up.
The conquer slid him like they'd they'd side it.
That he's the life-fully white, the parts of you should bag.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the chain of crappy, chic, retro, rungs, you should bag.
You should bag.
He's poorly waged to employees that he's got the parts of you should bag.
I kind of cut for white and the men were getting you should bag.
He's got all the calories he drives around in the garage caravan.
You should bag.
Tick off the egg, two replace five board and bang the kid.
In the back of his fort, that's all he did.
And pay to stand was born, the Clarks to do should bag.
You should bag.
He seemed delighted, and anybody would win the cash prizes.
On the pyramid, he never mind it.
The classic wasn't his, the Clarks to do should bag.
I never realized what a thin piece of crappy is.
After all the years I've been watching him, the Clarks to break he'll come to every cow's a dream.
The Clarks to do should bag.
All right.
Did you see the asthor about Cisco?
No.
The rap star, Cisco, when I'd bad the haircut, rested for shooting.
I saw the crawl on there real quick.
I was shooting for shooting something, maybe shooting blanks like Tom Cruise.
But at any rate, I don't, I'm looking all over for the goddamn story.
I hate when that happens.
You know, you see the crawl.
And if you don't look fast enough, you can't get the whole story of the tease.
Oh, I'm, I got a paper jam.
You see that dream I had last night?
That's more of my psychic powers again.
I can't get over it.
We're embarked in totally uncharted waters here in my entire radio history.
I haven't seen a rigged up.
Now you understand, see it's Neo but a psychic powers again having a technical radio nightmare last night.
I get up this morning, come in here and nothing works.
Let me in including my fax machine.
My moment, please.
I'm a tune.
And the best part of it is there's nothing, I mean, a paper is sitting in there just like it's supposed to in my fax machine.
You know, my beautiful, it always works fax machine.
But it's just part of the ambiance of the whole thing.
So we're fine.
So we thanks you this JetBlue Violence Privacy Policy.
We had this on our website.
So again, thank you very much.
But if you folks who read our website and read all those great bedtime stories we have on there,
then you wouldn't be wasting your time in our fax paper with stories that we already had on there.
You see what I'm saying?
Anyway, there's the other page just.
Thank you.
So I'm sorry if we're talking over those spots, aren't I?
No.
No, I'm here.
No, I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
I'm here.
44 votes that our first quick poll today should Caucasian-olded clubs and groups be permitted.
23 say yes.
52.2%.
Why not their groups for minorities?
That's what I voted.
Not in schools or publicly funded places.
9.
It seems a bit clannish.
5.
That's with a K.
Absolutely not.
It's bigotry.
5.
And will blood test be necessary for about the first 50 votes?
Okay, now let's get to the poll result from Friday, the important stuff.
Okay.
So what's the deal?
We're running a makeshift jury rigged.
The jury rigged.
Yeah, and it's probably going to change continuously.
Is that where they got that term any OJ trolley or jury rigged right?
Is it probably going to what?
What we're doing is probably going to change periodically during the course of the show.
So be prepared for a whole bunch more.
More nightmarish.
See, I didn't make that up.
Didn't I tell you before the show that I had a nightmare?
And I told you the whole thing was about incompetent engineers and technical stuff wouldn't work.
I'm telling you, I'm scared.
First words out of your mouth.
Put that freaking miscleo to shame.
I really have psychic powers, baby.
Man.
They'll find a way to blame me, though.
Well, that'll probably be the first paycheck by a couple of weeks anyway.
You mean in 2006?
No, and you'll notice it's a Monday morning.
Anybody notice that Monday morning after the weekend when they square everything up just like my feed went out for several hours here yesterday because.
And you want to know why you know, why I don't know who I blame?
I'm going to tell you right now.
See, WQAM, why did I get started on this?
This has nothing to do with what I was going to do with my agenda with my Fagg agenda.
WQM has got 75,000 generals and no soldiers.
Everybody is a chief and how does that expression go?
Too many cooks and not enough engines?
How does that thing go?
Too many chiefs, not enough Indians.
Isn't that the same?
That's the same thing I'm talking about.
We got 50,000 people running around with titles.
We got the general manager, any operations manager, any program director, any.
And we got Ray Perry, which other than giving out the football tickets, we have no idea what that lead is.
And we got Maddie Bell who runs around just so we can have somebody assured his George in the building.
Well, I mean, we got 8 billion generals and no soldiers.
That's the problem.
And so the weekend, it's like playtime, it's like a sandbox, it's like freaking kindergarten all over again.
All we need is Francis Hurley, which entered Ding Dong school.
We got that.
Yeah, we got her Ding Dong.
And so you come in on Monday morning and everything is, ah, you know, because we had a Marlin game, we had the Dolphin game.
And by the way, speaking of the Dolphin game, I noticed the old man.
See, if it's me, if it's me and I'm paying some doddering old fool with an nasty attitude, the kind of money they're paying him.
Because you know me the way I feel about people that don't show up every day.
And we got a home game, even though it's a Sunday night game.
They find him a nice hotel, like somewhere near here.
Look at like the Jamaican in right there on Ives Derry Road probably.
Right next to that Jamaican haircut joint.
Yeah.
He can probably stay at the Gonja Inn.
Right by the station and he gets up, gets a little bit of sleep, gets his ass in there.
But oh, no, we had a ball game last night.
So no mold this morning.
You know, what kind of nonsense is going on in this place, huh?
Too many chiefs and un-off Indians.
I think that's how it goes.
Something like that.
You know what I'm talking about.
Everybody's got a freaking title.
Nobody's doing anything.
Nobody's supervising anybody else.
We got some people in there walk around patting people on head.
So I'm here today.
Everything okay?
I'm here today.
Everything fine?
Anything I can do for you?
Oh, oh, oh.
Friday we asked who was your all-time favorite dead musician.
Just like I predicted.
I'm sorry.
John Lennon runs away with it.
Don't ask me why because I find that the unconscious and unacceptable.
John Lennon 248.
He couldn't lick Jim Morrison's ass.
If they set him upside by each right now, he couldn't lick his ass.
John Lennon 248.
Jim Morrison 124.
Elvis 110.
The King, which is pretty interesting because generally our crowd and all that Elvis intensive.
Are they?
No, we got a lot of old parts though.
What does that mean?
Old parts.
Well, do you mean like during our C-99?
Yeah, that kind.
Ooh.
Oh, I got to do the break.
And because we need to.
No, I can't get behind because the way the way the technical stuff is going, I don't, I just can't get behind.
Which is another reason why it would be nice if they get the spots then before 10 o'clock on the other show on the forale show.
Nothing personal, Scott, but if you want to be a pansy of pantyways, go right ahead.
Okay?
Act like a petal and little child.
What was the name of that throwout on U of N campus where they smeared all his ass?
I think it pardoned.
26 panty, they smeared it.
Hmm, with Mayo.
26 past 10 at 560 W to QAIM.

Out regions.
What are your qualifications?
I have no experience. I'm a woman nice and a terrible, a terrible guy.
What's your plan?
Here's my plan.
I decided to get a bikini wax and then the end to crazy deficits spending.
It really comes down to this.
Game over.
Get a sack to know that we're going to decide if the game is over or not.
Aren't they in California?
We may get the decision sometime late this afternoon or this evening because it's like three hours behind.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
I'm wide.
The trend.
I beg your pardon?
Congratulations for the trend.
From Greg.
You know something.
I'm going to have to be streamed myself at this point.
A radio station is like I said, got 85,000 people running around with a title.
We can't get anything done.
Everything is like in disarray.
A technical disaster.
Isn't it quite a commentary that this studio that I'm sitting in here in Toronto,
or it's cloudy and raining by the way?
This studio that I'm sitting in here right now is like heads and shoulders above the piece of crap down there.
And you want to know why?
Why?
Because they can't be bothered with things like that because they don't understand.
We got people running that place who don't even know how to help we get on the air.
They think it's like through that goddamn comb you were whistling it.
They haven't got a clue how the hell it works.
They couldn't turn a microphone on if you stuck a guy named Uzi up there.
Correct.
Ask.
Nice trend, okay.
Congratulations.
Did he say congratulations to you on a trend?
Yeah, as an afterthought as he was thinking.
All right, and YouTube.
But August was like mostly you, which is why we're down a little bit.
But nevertheless, there was the highest number on a station in August midday,
10 to 3 by far, by far, even with little Georgia on there,
because August the first week was a vacation week, right?
Right.
And then Tuesdays and Thursdays, most of the rest of the month.
Plus all the rest of the month is for the rating.
Because it ends like about the 20th or something like that.
So it was a heavy George month and still kicked everybody else's ass on air.
And what does he get?
He gets a lot of abuse because that's the way they deal with you QAM, okay?
They're looking in there on a lie because that's just like bush.
That's the similarity between Greg Read and the QAM Mafia and the fascists we got running America today.
Lires.
They lie just as easily as breathing the fresh air, man.
Comes like a second nature to him.
Anyway, we asked who's your all time and I still can't get over the fact that
Muff created a whole countertops there.
Well, you heard my conversation with him, right?
Yeah.
About Zach who's sitting in for who is filling in for Robert in two chairs this morning.
Sitting in his chair and Robert's and I said,
you know, please just let him know that we'd like him to get the spots over before 10 o'clock.
You don't run spots first of all that are by and six to 10 a.m. like a 1002 and 1003.
Just not the way it's done like in a real broadcast facility, okay?
Which we're trying desperately after six years to drag these people into the real world and they still don't want to do it.
And he's like took exception that obviously going that out of shape.
Looks to think?
Yeah, well.
Well, why is that?
That sounds like kind of like childish and churlish to me because I could see that there wasn't going to be any crossover because I'm sitting there bap-bap-bap-bap and they're not putting me on a year again.
So you were on?
I was?
Well, he's just ignoring me.
Well, you were on in here.
You know what?
I can't guarantee if you were on.
No, I was.
Because he wasn't that was not on.
So I'm at the mercy of whenever the hell whoever's sitting in there decides to open a goddamn pot.
Duff.
Hey, Duff, get off your duff, okay?
Quick creating problems where we don't already have anything.
Well, he likes it.
He likes it because it's a minister runner.
Oh, Greg, it's a problem.
It's a problem.
Greg.
You know, it gives him like job justification.
So anyway, getting back to that poll from the weekend, who's your favorite all-time dead musician?
John Lennon 248, Jim Morrison 124, Elvis Presley 110, Jerry Garcia 99, Jimmy Hendricks 98, Bob Marley 84.
That's amazing to me.
Bob Marley had 84 votes.
Sam Marley.
Wow.
We got a lot of Jamaicans, Mom.
No, we got a lot of stoners out there.
We got about the Jamaican Freddie Mercury 63.
What does that say?
We got a lot of queens.
Sarah Ravon 59, Frank Sinatra, Todd with Harry Chapin 52, Frank Sinatra, my ass, okay?
All the way, you know, we asked who's your favorite.
How would you do that?
Oh, God.
Frank Zepa 51, Kurt Cobain 50.
Colat Trigger again, purchase to make sure.
And in honor of that big, half-time ceremony, they had it at the Dolphin Game last night.
So we get the report.
Celia 41, Celia Cruz.
A gigantic man in the recording industry.
A gigantic drag queen.
A monkey-faced old troll.
Very white 37, two packs of courthead 34.
Do we get the story yet about Cisco?
No.
The Cisco kid.
I'm telling you, there's a story, some kind of a shooting.
I know that's unusual in the rap community.
Roy Orbison 29, John Bonham 23, Randy Rhodes 22.
Wow.
Wrong Randy.
Jim Croci and George Harrison and Patsy Klein and Joe Strummer also 22.
That's pretty embarrassing that George Harrison is tied with Randy Rhodes.
Aren't you humiliated and degraded by that?
That's sad.
Johnny Cash 19, and the only reason he got that many is because he just died a specific vote.
Louis Armstrong 18.
Marvin Gay 18.
Oh, Marvin Gay only had 18.
But a Holly 13, Dean Martin 13.
Boy, that's a good pair.
Neither one of them could sing a note.
Bon Scott 12, Ronnie Van Zand 12, Bradley Noelle 12, Morris Gimbe had 12.
Nice going, Morris.
Janice Joplin 11.
Ten votes for Tiny Tim and Warren Z Ivonne.
I see great similarity there.
Joey Ramone had eight, Keith Moon had eight, Glenn Miller seven, Rick Nelson seven.
Tommy Bolin 16, Cooper six.
I'm blown away the Jean Cooper had six votes, aren't you?
Yeah, that is amazing.
Did anybody ever heard of it?
Yeah, old, old farts.
Boy, it's nice to be a happy Monday to all you old farts.
We all woke up again today.
That's something to be happy about.
Sonny Bono 5, Sid Vicious 3, Dwayne Almond 3.
Eddie Cochran, Sid and the balcony too.
Wasn't that that song?
See, I keep getting him confused with Wayne Cochran, who's the Hank's Good Bunny.
Sid and I'll avenge.
In Del Rey and old last out of over almost 16, 900 votes with only one vote.
I'm a dismayed and nauseated from that is David Ruffin, who I guarantee is really brokenhearted about that.
But these people know about music.
They're always good knock in my musical taste.
What some of you know about music.
You could stuff up your ass in the room for the Chinese army west in there.
Okay, David Ruffin with one vote.
What becomes of the brokenhearted?
One of the great songs in the history of mankind.
Is there any doubt about that?
No.
You don't like that song?
I do like that song.
One of the great soul songs ever.
Ever.
And this man gets one vote while certain other cock amig me like Dean Martin gets 13.
Dean Martin looks like a joke vote.
The guy that called him was like in choir when he said he couldn't say what a straight push.
Dean Martin.
Even Sammy Davis would be laughing at that.
But no, David Ruffin gets one lousy freaking vote from the hard ass bastards in South Florida.
And by the way, nice one Tommy Brady with a bad elbow.
Okay.
Everybody's talking about freaking J. Feeder.
A buffalo would have had their running back.
It might have been a ballgame last night.
They might have got their ass kicked.
You know what?
If that kid wouldn't have got hurt.
They were playing like Jack Ruby was the running back in a second half for Buffalo last night.
What do you expect?
Plus the fact drew blood.
So like I've always told you when the when the when the going gets tough, Drew gets going in the crapper.
You can always count on him for some big picks in the tough going in the big games.
Choke artist.
My right Scott.
That's right.
He is. He's a choke artist.
That's why through the three picks in that game last night.
He's stuck to join out.
Nice go and Drew.
You suck.
You couldn't lick Tommy Brady's ass.
Okay.
And believe you me, if you could, I'd like to be there to watch.
I'd like to be there to clean up.
So.
Yes.
The only thing I can find on the Cisco story, which might have been what you saw in the crawl out the corner of your eye.
Yeah.
A follow up story about us and increased security measures on Capitol Hill that quote Senator Gary Cisco.
That's the only thing that came up on the search.
This is about rap star Cisco, okay, which isn't spelled the same way.
I guarantee you they don't have the same haircut.
Okay.
Oh, maybe.
And this was about a shooting, okay?
Which I like I said before probably won't even make the headlines because rap shootings are like, you know, like somebody getting murdered in Miami.
It's not even news anymore.
You know, another one big deal.
But we'll find out and we're also going to find out what the story is with our best of Neil stuff because this.
See today is today.
I guess I'm going to have to play bush boss again and drive along and drive the law.
I'll try the law drive the law drive the law with my mouth.
Draw the line in the sand again because there's just been too much.
I mean, the summertime's over in case you have no effect.
This is a perfect day for you.
I don't know why.
Why?
Isn't this the first day of fall?
Maybe.
Maybe isn't the 21st the end of summertime and are we in the beginning of fall official?
I believe no actually to 23rd this year.
So like I said, this is the last day of summer.
Okay.
Sure.
Mr. Knowson and picker.
Pucker.
Mother.
Picker.
Tucker.
Carlson with a bad bow tie.
So my point being that this is a good time for us to quit dilly dallying.
Okay.
All the summertime, all the farting around, all the excuses.
Well, everybody's out of town, which a lot of Mr. Larvita.
That's all gone.
That's all pass A.
It's time to put your nose to the grindstone here on QA and start following my example.
All right.
In fact, just a showing example.
I think I might take a few weeks off just to make a point.
Best of the neocampaign my ass.
Keep in mind that 10 grand of that is mother seed money that I put in the 10,000 every year to get the things started.
So we have the money to print the CDs and to get the guy to empty chain.
Absolutely.
Going.
And my number that I got here is 23,470 and you had like you said about 300 on Saturday.
Right.
Right.
And then of course the big 40 bucks from Joe Castello last week.
And who only knows.
So Miguel, you know, we love you Miguel.
But if you get your thing out of, uh, out of Doreen long enough to go wash it off and come in there and give us an idea what the we got will be very nice.
We appreciate it.
Because this is the most half-pasted, the most half-past.
And you keep saying, oh, we're going to get to 100,000.
No problem.
Based on what?
Well, maybe that's the only thing.
Based on what?
Well, well, over a month now, this thing.
And you're giving me a solid answer.
We're going to raise 100 grand for abandonment per rescue based on this thing crawling along.
Right. Well, we raised 90 in three months, Laya, the last time.
Yeah.
Starting in October.
And.
So what does that have to do with this?
We just started yet officially.
Well, there wasn't this half-past as this operation is going to see this.
Plus those more Howard David and Keychains are.
Absolutely.
Oh, lame.
We.
Who now wants that?
They all should.
I would think so.
They're great.
They are.
Yeah, excellent.
See, now our luck is turning.
Now our luck is changing for the better.
I'd get it just for where he says, you asshole.
Right.
When you love to walk up behind somebody and just press a button and go, you asshole.
That's right.
Like that guy at blockbuster yesterday.
You what?
I wish I had had one of these in my pocket for that guy at blockbuster.
Yes.
But they got a farted real loud and smelled real bad at blockbuster.
George was bitterly complaining before to show this morning.
That some guy cuts some wicked nasty cheese at blockbuster yesterday.
And that even though George was running to the other side of the store,
they it was following him.
It was keeping up the walls down the aisle.
And it caught me.
And it caught me.
And it was probably into some of the DVDs.
It caught me and it wouldn't let me go.
1042 at 560 W2M.

Yes!
And who's the reason we're talking about this?
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
We're talking about the reason we're talking about this.
I don't watch any of those shows.
There isn't one show that won in the world last night that I watched none of the above.
Let me say it again.
On 60 minutes last night on Halibut and Vectellar should be.
There should be impeachment hearings going out right now against Cheney and Bush and this whole bunch of fascists.
But are there?
No.
That's because the media is too worried about Cisco.
How about how much is Cisco?
About 15 bucks a year?
9-11 masterminds.
His attack was paired down.
You saw that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Sheikh Yibouti, said that they originally were going to hijack five commercial jets on each coast, totaled 10.
And the original plan called for as many as 22 terrorists and four planes in a first wave, followed by a second wave of suicide hijackings that were to be aided possibly by al-Qaeda allies in Southeast Asia.
And of course, if you listen to ABC News during those days, which is what they originally had tried to get me to put on the year which I refused.
We put HBC on for like about five minutes and then we went back to MSNBC and CNN because ABC was all over the place.
Remember they were reporting that bogus report of a hijack plane from Seattle or Portland or somewhere?
And then we never heard any more about it because it turned out to be bogus.
And Peter Jennings was a major, major ass during that entire thing.
I'm just a missive of misinformation was ABC News.
Peace of cramp.
Here's the poll for the main poll that we're going to be building.
Oh no, Eric's going to get upset.
By the way, Eric was a little bit interesting because yesterday it was it Saturday that I emailed him about 100 great bedtime stories for the weekend, including yesterday morning.
He finally got around to it about, I don't know, very late yesterday.
I don't want to start picking on poor Eric because he's fat and he's also probably got some other things to do.
I'll probably not do too much business on the weekend, probably eating in monkey business, wouldn't you think?
But boy, he sure was a little bit lagging on those bedtime stories yesterday.
Wow, wow, wow.
Anyway, here's our set.
See, I told you today's the day that I get out of my system and it's based on the fact that everything screwed up there.
Do you think it's a good day to do it?
Oh yeah.
Little fall house cleaning baby.
That's what we're doing.
And tough. How dare you?
I just want to get him weeping in there.
Can you hear him weeping it? Is he sobbing like a girl?
Yeah.
Sobbing like you're a how could you take like one little request on my part to go and make a big.
I might it's a last thing we did on this radio station.
It's not a major rip.
Yeah.
Grobscot.
Not toughs fault. You're an ass.
Who's your all time favorite dead person not on our previous polls?
That's the question today.
Now, if you don't know what the previous polls were then get lost.
No, no, this is a series of dead people that piss off Moe.
Absolutely.
Of course work too hard on the game last night to come in and work this morning for his half a million a year.
Here's our what we got so far because we had a couple called in on Friday because they couldn't wait for this one.
I mean, this is all encompassing your favorite all time dead person.
It's got to be somebody that's known by this audience anyway.
Like the thanks for calling lady.
Now what was your name Fran?
Faye.
Faye.
Faye winters.
Well, we don't need the winners, but Faye.
I don't know if we want to put that on there or not.
Just thanks for calling maybe.
I don't know who it was.
Right.
Anybody who's listening to the show for more than five minutes knows who that is one of our favorite callers.
Thanks for calling who passed away last year.
Barbara Kaffitman with her yellow teeth.
Now nobody's going to remember who that was.
But we'll put him on the satisfy that little fart that called in Friday.
Ben Franklin.
Where the hell would we meet without Ben Franklin?
Boy, I sure respected him during when we had the blackout up here that one day.
Right.
I thought to myself, thank God that somebody told him to go fly a kite.
Otherwise, we'd still be sitting in the dark.
Don't you think?
Can you imagine what QA would be like without Ben Franklin?
Probably not.
That's different.
Thomas Edison Albert Einstein.
I think that's a good five this star.
Don't you?
I think that's magnificent.
Your favorite dead person who's not on the previous post.
In other words, somebody who wasn't a movie star and actor actress, a politician.
And what was the other one we did?
Favorite Muslims.
Now seriously, what was the other one we did?
Musician.
Right.
I thought you were really off your feet.
I don't want to say that I'm having five conversations at once now.
Are you having five conversations at once?
You have no idea what's going on in here with this audio vault situation.
I don't care.
I don't care because they don't care enough to say they're very best because they allow this.
This slip shot, slacker kind of crap going on with a $2.5 an hour people, excuse me Scott.
All those little underlings are all weekend long screwing everything up, sticking their fingers in every socket they can find.
Let go.
Any other.
And you come on the other side.
It's like Humpty Dumpty was there and of course the you guys have to try to pick up the pieces to put them back together again.
And I'm sitting here in a basement and bewilderment wondering what the F is going on.
You don't want to say what he's saying?
What's the what the F is going on?
Remember that in the work.
You want to know what the F is going on?
Howard.
That was great.
Greatest movie of all time I dare say.
And very few of you would agree because you just you're not in his business.
I guess if you're in a business you have an additional appreciation of it, but you don't have to be in a business monkey business.
Now seriously anybody that saw that movie.
One of the greatest one of the most prophetic movies in history of mankind a genius patty drive.
I'm a mad at hell.
But I don't think it's the same thing anymore.
The world is a business Mr. Beal.
And the fact that just a handful of special interests were control all of the media to manipulate public opinion.
And that whole thing about the Saudi deal.
I mean my God that was like when did that movie come out 30 years ago?
At least 30 man.
I would say 73.
Look it up.
Okay.
Right now.
So that's what we got on poll 2 so far and we'll build it throughout the day.
Phil Specter by the way.
Bad news for you.
Sure if detectives say that concluded the legendary record producer Phil Specter was responsible for the shooting death of an actor.
And have submitted their findings to prosecutors.
76.
Trump bones.
It's not an accident.
It's not a suicide captain Frank Merriman told the LA Times and Story for Friday editions.
Phil Specter shot our wonder Frank Merrimans related to Jim Merriman senior junior Tom Merriman.
No immediate decision was or whether Lanny Merriman.
No immediate decision was expected.
And whether criminal charges would be filed since Sandy given the spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
What was the great invitational pace or at hazel park driven by Jim Merriman junior and later by Tom Merriman?
Philip Brian.
Philip Brian didn't know that did you?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
You'll throw it adequate.
Mr. Smarty pants.
Philip Brian.
You would know Philip Brian from Brian Andrews.
Would you know from Prince Philip?
He does much.
Only Philip Prince Philip had bigger ears than the horse.
Specter whose wall of sound recording technique transformed 60s pop music was arrested February the Turd for investigation of murder after the body of 40-year-old Lannard Clarkson was fundamentally forer of his hilltop Alhambra mansion.
He was released after posting a million dollars bill.
Specter 62 suggested in the N square magazine and if you win July that Clarkson and Atkerson hosted set the House of Blues.
They have shot herself but chairs investigators said in March they discounted suicide.
A member of the rock and roll hall of fame specters worked with such artists as the Beatles, Ramones, Serels and Ronets.
And it produced such pop music classics as The Do-Ron-Ron.
Probably one of the great titles in History Mankind with all apologies to Sean Cassidy.
The Do-Ron-Ron then he kissed me and to know him is the love of course the original to do Ron-Romers the crystals and Sean Cassidy who couldn't sing as well as a paper sack or as brother David's ass his step brother David's ass covered that song.
Remember Sean Cassidy?
Sure.
I'm so sorry.
She's alive and low.
She scores 20 or vice versa.
She way am.
Play pop little boy.
The rest of the songs like Roos is after I am done.
Can understand why everybody makes fun.
The rest room smells like roses.
You mean it seems okay but I'm not the only one who used the rest room today.
I was only in there for a few minutes.
I always break the light so when I am through.
But now the world is out that I hit it.
I guess I'll have to find somewhere else to do do.
Now I'll have to hold it in and hack my head in this space.
When I get my hand but who spreads those rumors all batches is fake.
Cause the rest room smells like roses.
Whenever I am through it smells okay to me when I do do.
Okay play the honor of the cut the bad cheese blockbuster over the weekend.
I mean he just let it rip.
Yeah no decorum.
I pushed it.
Earthshaking event which you were positive that he must have dropped the load in his pants.
It sounded a little wet.
188 votes on a first poll so far should Caucasian only clubs and groups be permitted.
This is in a wake of that story about the girl out in summer California who wants to start a Caucasian only club in her school.
Why not their groups from minorities 50.5% say that 95 out of 188.
Not in schools are publicly funded places 31.
It seems a bit clandish with the K29 will blood test be necessary 20.
Will they be necessary?
Absolutely not it's bigotry only 13.
Only 13 out of almost 200 say oh we can't do that have white only clubs and you 13 people by the way what kind of assholes are you anyway.
Some kind of special asshole idiots.
Here's sunrise hello.
Yeah hi Neil.
Yes sir.
Yeah and Al Franken's book he says the Christian right cares about Israel because Jesus can't come back unless we have World War 3.
He says when George Bush was governor only Christians can go to heaven that's what he said.
It's in the park with Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
He really goes after them too.
Oh do you ever hear skeptic news dot com?
Did I ever want?
Did I ever hear from it?
No I hear of it.
I somebody called in last week I already checked it out.
Okay this is a story I just about Tom Delay said they are at the 10,000 years old.
This is a story about four executive saying pollution to you.
Okay listen every great day.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
Who do these sound like?
He sounded like one of our critics.
Yeah nobody sounded like Stan Worthheimer even a woman.
No.
Because he didn't mention anything about because I think Tom Delay also said casino gambling is evil.
Did he say that?
I'm sure he did just this morning.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.
You're all time favorite dead person not on the previous polls.
I think this is it.
We wrap up the edit because we got to do that straight eye for the queer guy thing.
Right.
Because we've had the audience actually suggest some real good polls lately and thank the Lord for that.
Yeah.
Because we need some help.
We need some polls.
We need some serious poll.
Here's North Miami.
Hello.
Hey Neil how you doing?
Pretty good.
Okay on that fiscal story.
It was Saturday's Harold and that people section.
Oh so it's an old story then.
Yeah and I guess it happened probably Thursday or Friday.
The paraphrases he was basically sitting on his porch and he saw some people sitting in the car and sort of firing shots.
Well that sounds reasonable to me.
So if you want to look it up it'd be like Saturday's Harold.
So cold news.
Okay thanks.
See you.
That's why I couldn't find a goddamn Cisco story because it's old news.
They put stuff on a crawl there like you know president Lincoln enjoyed the play but he and feeling too good stuff like that.
Yeah.
Which is just a little bit dated if you catch my drink because it takes a lot of crap stories to fill up that crawl all the time.
On and on and on it goes.
Well look at that the NASDAQ's down 32 and the down is down 104 points.
Oh right.
Must be just an aberration in the midst of this tremendous economic comeback.
56670560.
Pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
Here's for Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hey Neil.
Yes sir.
Hey yeah this is a Billy from Shoe was on the beach.
I spoke to you a couple years ago when I was in on a dam rack.
Good for Queens day.
Right.
And I'm heading back there this afternoon and I was going to give you a shout Friday but I need to get a 305 number to contact you.
What's the number like it's the one you just dial just used 305.
The 567.
Right.
Oh great.
Okay.
Well I'll give you a report when I get over there.
Okay.
All right.
Good talk to you.
Have a good time.
I'll still believe.
See you.
See you at the merkeys.
56670560.
Pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless.
I forgot to ask him if he's probably flying Martin Air.
When you think.
How would I do that?
I don't know.
I just guess.
KLM doesn't fly from Miami.
Or maybe they do fly from Miami but if you want to pay about $85,000 something like that.
Sister Ripoff.
The whole world is a big ripoff boys and girls because KLM owns Martin's gear.
So what would you rather do if you want to go like in business class?
Would you rather spend $1700 if you want to go from Miami to Amsterdam non-stop?
I'm KLM.
Would you rather spend $5 or $6000?
It's a tough choice.
Yeah.
Of course in your case it's an easy choice.
None of the above.
56670560.
Pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.
I don't know.
I'll leave this thing up till noon.
The one that's under now.
And then we'll get serious about the dead people.
And I don't want mode to get all bent out of shape because I'm sure he's sitting there listening.
And then she's probably just crawling out of the sack right now.
Wouldn't you think?
Hey listen it was it was way past his bedtime for an 85 year old man last night.
It came to ends like around midnight.
Same on the sack in the same sentence just brings an image to mind.
Yeah, sack as in sack of crap.
Well he does see this carry his sack nicely.
But it was a great piece on a an e last night.
It's our special on the Gambino family.
Do you see that yet?
Nope.
It's seen it before.
Yes.
But it was sensational about Paul Castelano and about Carlolgan Bino before him and about what's his name?
John Gotti.
Mm-hmm.
And his punk kid.
John Gotti.
I won't see him no more.
Here's my me B.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Pretty good.
Got a name for your poll.
But before I just wanted to say I saw that thing last night on a...
I don't know if you know what that was in pre-ordained man by these slime balls.
I don't know what it was.
It's thickening man, it really is.
But I was like...
Just just...
Paul, I'm gonna go with the...
Oh, he's wearing Walt Disney.
What would be without Disney?
Good point, excellent.
Good choice.
Have a good one, Neil.
You too, Pali, thank you.
Walt Disney, huh?
I would never have thought of that with you.
Nope.
Where the hell would we be?
What a Mickey Mouse world it wouldn't be without Walt Disney.
Oh, it's Nerf!
Right.
Although, I mean, again, it doesn't mean that...
Let's see, you're all time favorite.
Well, see, this might have something to do with your opinion,
because everything I've read about him has been pretty negative.
Yeah.
Not what you call a nice guy.
No.
Although he did do the original pencil drawing of Mickey Mouse,
although Mickey at that point was like a real thin like...
Right.
The stick figure.
Yeah, all the figures.
The stick figure.
Yeah, he Walt's stick it.
Right, go.
We get that deal.
That steamboat willy.
Take it up.
Take it up.
Take it up.
Right, let's face it, it was crap.
Might as well show steamboat willy.
I make a few den dollars.
Can't do that on Monday.
I think I just hurt myself.
56670560,
pound 560 on EAT&T.
We got a good group there.
Thanks for calling, lady.
I mean, somebody called in just to be nice.
I don't know how she fits in this pool.
And Barbara Kaffitman with a yellow teeth.
Does Williamsburg need gambling?
Yes, she was the art dreckle lady.
Oh, I got one.
You know, I haven't picked one yet.
Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein,
Walt Disney, and George's choices, Carl Sagan.
Oh, but he was very soon with like,
Joe Narratives on PBS.
Carl Sagan was a great guy who should have kept his mouth shut.
You know what I mean?
Oh, he opened up a mouth and ripped religion all the time.
I'm not talking about that, but I'm talking about the, the,
the, oh, he's a little highly affected delivery on those.
What was the name of that series on PBS?
What was it?
Cosmos.
Cosmos.
Great series, but it's just that they should have had somebody else narrate.
Right.
Because he went through this very, I mean,
it's not like he was getting like a burium animal while he was talking,
which is not easy to do.
He was getting a high colonic.
Very spastic, brilliant guy, but he only reminded me of,
I shouldn't say this.
Go ahead.
Well, you're going to get upset.
He reminded me like he was like the burnt back rack of science.
You know, I'm not upset me.
I just, I just talked to him earlier because when I,
a bird crack break wrote a lot of great music, but when you see it,
it's just he's really annoying.
He affected people with that phony just always on.
That's a good like carbon-hameless and dramatic, you know?
Is it?
Have you ever seen him and Marvin Hamles together?
No.
I think it's the same person.
Oh my god.
Burnt back rack and Carl Sagan.
And maybe the other way around.
Maybe Burnt back rack is the Carl Sagan of music.
Huh?
Oh, he probably, Carl Sagan wouldn't like him because he does say a little prayer.
But you know, that Cosmos has required watching for everyone.
It's great.
It's great, especially for people with enough brains to release the brain.
And I realize that the religion crap is crap.
Stop it or religious baloney already.
People are destroying each other like the first guy I said he wanted to make a five-hour speech.
I mean, his heart was in the right place like Randy.
I just told him to show the first guy.
But I mean, this, this bunch of lunatic born again is trying to lead us down the path to Armageddon
so we can blow the whole world up.
If they're ready to die, why don't they have some cool aid?
You know, just like Jim Jones.
At least they kept them themselves, you know?
I want to change my contribution to what?
Darwin.
Well, you can, I guess you can have another one.
Charles Darwin.
What about Sigmund Freud?
I like Darwin.
He had huge balls.
Sigmund Freud.
And...
I can just see the way these are going to be spelled.
And...
How about...
Albert...
Was it Alfred?
Alfred Kinsey.
Or Albert.
I have no idea how to spell Freud, Eric.
F-R-E-U-D.
It's not F-R-O-Y-D.
F-R-E-U-D.
I always spelled it.
F-R-E-U-D.
I actually got one right.
Woo!
Was it Alfred Kinsey?
I came remember what his name was.
Or Albert.
Sigmund Freud.
Why won't you respond to my question?
I don't know which Kinsey was.
You don't know Kinsey, my god, father Albert.
I think it's Albert.
Sex studies?
It wasn't Albert.
Lastly.
I'm Peter.
Father.
Spirit.
Nazi bastard.
Okay, let's see.
Kinsey's name was...
I can't believe I did Freud.
Alfred Kinsey.
Alfred C. Kinsey.
The Kinsey Institute?
Yeah, I don't know why I was like insecure about that.
I don't like making too many big mistakes on Monday.
Later in a week, no problem.
Who put out everybody else's hat?
Yeah.
I did make one mistake.
I showed up.
I could have been in the other room sleeping in real sound right now.
I showed up for this technical disaster.
A festival of technical ineptitude.
It's Q-A-M.
Absolutely correct.
I don't think we're done.
Oh, I'm sure.
I'm sure that.
Nice trend, though, guys.
Yeah, we're going to start calling Greg Nero.
He's fiddling while the station is burning around him.
And then the pieces of equipment are falling to the floor
and the place is on fire.
And there's Greg.
Nice trend, guys.
This is a man who hasn't got any idea how we make it happen.
He hasn't got a clue.
He just winds it up and lets it go and hopes for the best.
God.
By the way, there's something...
If he was still in there, which I'm sure he's not,
because he is a hit and run.
You know, always something I wanted to call you, Greg.
And have a nice week.
Get the place fixed up a little bit.
We'll get the places of pigstile.
1113 at 560 WQM.
See, that's another great thing about doing a show for me.
Not only do I have a nice studio, but I have a nice clean apartment.
You know, I have nice surroundings, the ambiance.
Yeah.
I suppose that pigstile, that toilet, that sewer,
that indoor septic tank.

Never thought I'd find the gun no ride that I've been tuned around into today.
Now it's a classic set of wheels fixed up the way a brother would like to eat.
Now it's a key to China and the dream is cold and a dizziness of the city.
I got the chance of liquid cherry oil.
No baby, open a good auditary jar and give me baby fruit.
No baby, China need a little bit, little belly baby.
Give the suspense kit now so I bounce down the road in a bit.
That is super bad way.
Now with the authors, stop the big deals a day I'll get around the beach in the breeze.
I got 79, my phone, Catalina.
Showed a goodbye now it's my baby, Cadillac.
Star baby, open a good auditary jar and give me baby fruit.
Star baby, Chinese baby, little belly baby, little spirits, go.
I got my wing goes down on the hearts of the day cause the hazy don't work no way.
Sweating fresh with all seeds starts to smell and gets the dusty look in over time.
From a backseat to mind a shiny granite, no lag light, thanks my coffee, China, too, because I've been washing it with all the road.
Don't all be a real, over the catalogue auditary, give me baby fruit.
No baby, Michael Schaapick, wheels going over speed bumps and confused.
Star baby, fresh with all the material, be fancy to be a baby, Star baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Funny past 11 and 5, 6, 250 votes on a pool already on pool.
Number one should Caucasian only clubs and groups be permitted.
Why not?
Their groups for minorities, 118, 47.2% of us said that.
Not in schools are publicly funded places, 44.
I believe George voted for that cause I voted for the why not.
Why not?
It seems a bit clannish with a K-42 said that.
Will blood has to be necessary 28th the answer is and absolutely not as bigotry only 18, 7.2% only 18 out of 250.
Said it's bigotry.
Here's a lady in Boka, hello.
Hello.
Yes ma'am.
I was thinking of the right brothers who invented the airplane.
But weren't there two of them?
Orbital and will, orl and will, bro?
Orbital and will, bro.
Yeah, but I condensed it and said the right brothers.
The right brothers, you condensed it and you made them into one.
You made them sign these twins.
We'll take it under consideration, okay?
Thank you.
Thanks. Have a great day.
What do you say to the right brothers?
No.
I mean, how can the right brothers be your favorite dead person?
We're not asking, keep in mind, we're not asking who's the most important person of all time.
Because obviously that is...
Oh, go.
You know the answer to that.
By the way, speaking of important people that Miguel finally pulled that thing out of her is the, you know, going to get us the number or not.
He's working on it.
And that's what I'm worried about.
Oh, seriously, if we aren't to 25 grand yet, you're finishing the show.
I'm telling you that right now, Mr. I'm just...
I'm not putting up with any more of this foot drag.
And this is the most slip shot goddamn place.
Yeah.
And in this year with these van hits, well, it's raining outside or there's a cloud in the sky or...
Do we need to get it again or, you know, what's the story there?
Oh, by the way, speaking of somebody getting it again, the room around the building is Skippy.
Skippy, which of course my first dog was named Skippy.
And I think it's very appropriate.
One of our sales holes, little rope named Skippy.
He's got his head so far of Scrooans.
That's the word around the building.
Of course, like somebody else would say, it's probably getting pretty crowded.
What with...
Scrooans and all the others.
Scrooans and...
I was talking about probably getting pretty crowded.
Just like clearance.
5, 6, 7, and by the way, to duck him in and apologize for creating a big riff between me and my close friend Scott for real.
Well, what the hell is wrong with him, man?
See, if he would have given it to clearance, he would have handled it more diplomatically.
But ducking the emotional cripple that he is, oh gee, Neil's all upset.
I'm not out, wasn't it, was I upset?
No.
No, all I said was let's not do that no more.
Oh, is what I said.
Let's say you get the spots done before 10 o'clock and then we'll do our crossover.
Which is plenty, you know?
That's the way it works.
It doesn't work that way at 8 o'clock, I guarantee you that.
But, you know, there's a little bit of a problem there.
And maybe it'll fetch the return into something really great, you know, and big.
And then he'll start playing golf with Mo again.
And we'll have like a big brawl.
I don't really care, you know?
I'm beyond that.
Just give me the check.
What's the date today?
22nd?
3rd?
4th?
3rds day.
Get that check there.
And by the way, get it there this time, clearance on time, on time.
Not when you can feel like getting around with or not with some story that's sitting in
somebody's drawers in the building.
And George got his bonus from the spring book on his paycheck.
Let's hear it.
It's only the middle of September, the end of September.
Nice going Greg.
Chief Bastard.
Here's for a lottery deal.
Hello.
Poor lottery.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I called Friday.
How did you want him to do on the pole?
How did you want him to do on the pole?
12 votes.
I called Friday.
Yeah.
Did he win the pole?
Yeah, he won the pole.
He had 750 votes out of 800 pounds.
He won hands down your pants.
That makes you happy?
Wow.
That must be one of your people.
Sure.
Whatever.
They're big in a John Bono.
Whatever category.
Yeah.
Whatever category that is.
Short people.
You pick it.
Yeah, he's probably about two feet tall.
He's not like a munchkin.
Here's Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Neil.
How are you doing?
Pretty good.
My name is Ray.
I live down in Hollywood.
I'd tell you what.
I'm sorry, Ray.
But a recent fan of yours.
And you get, I just want to thank you for the hours and pleasure in the past few weeks that I've been listening to you.
The first time I heard you, a rip and south flart or a new one.
And I was hysterical walking around delivering mail in Emma Hill.
I was listening to you.
Good.
Oh, boy.
Emerald Hill is good luck to you, man.
Oh, yeah.
I'm there with all the economically-
All the rent out.
Yeah.
All the intas.
But two things.
One, I agree with the parole for the white groups.
The second is Henry Ford.
Henry Ford, good anti-Semite.
Always?
Well.
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's dead anyway.
Don't make anything of that.
And another is, I like to find out off the air if like where I get information on getting some of your tapes and things like that.
I have no idea.
OK, hang on.
OK.
And thanks a lot.
OK, take care of him.
Will you please do something with him?
OK, now then.
See, this is symptomatic of the disease that we have with our best of campaigns here.
And now I get a number 23,080.
As of Joe and Mark's biggest draft against it was 23,470.
So now we just lost 300 bucks.
How do we do that?
How do we do that?
How do we do that?
I don't know.
Not to mention the 300 or there are bots that you raised on the Friday at where ever the hell you were.
At the cell cell place.
So Miguel, I'm going to tell you something there.
They do have a cure for syphilis, but you have to catch it early.
OK, he caught syphilis early.
All that hanky panky with the rain.
I mean, he must have caught something because it's affecting his worries.
Brain used to be.
Look what happened to Al Capone.
Did he get syphilis and jail?
Yes, he did.
That's how he died.
He died from it.
So you better get that checked real fast.
OK, Miguel.
He's going to go check it right now.
You better have somebody take a look at that thing.
I was there.
I do it for you.
It's a shanker.
Yeah, it probably is.
He probably caught it from Moe because this number is not seeing.
This is what bothers me is that the number is not that it's like an exact science.
We have to have exact.
I like to have some idea within about 50 grand one way or the other way to hell we are.
Embarrassing.
He says for the month of October,
there are van hits every Thursday locations will be posted on our website.
Well, nice go in sweetheart.
Just tomorrow we'll be doing it 11 to 1 with the computer technology showcase.
Happening at the Broward County Convention Center.
The best of need will be available.
You can spin the prize wheel for Marlon tickets.
Oh, you can spin the wheel.
Oh, and speaking of that.
Now, I wonder when those Marlon tickets are going to be for.
I can't imagine that they're going to be for this big series against the Philadelphia Phillies.
Starting tomorrow, these see the of course they still got the Braves tonight in Atlanta.
But the series of the season,
the wild card in the national league and all likely depends on these next three games tomorrow through Thursday.
At fill out the full of the at the PPP Park.
And I guarantee you one thing,
there better not be no empty seats for those games or that town will be forever known
as the bush leakyest of them all.
One thing to be bush league,
but when you're the bush leakyest of them all,
I mean, we're talking a half a game going into the United States games.
Both teams trying to back their way out of that wild card spot desperately laying down like crazy.
But the big series starts tomorrow at PPP Park.
You better be there or we're going to all be pissed off, right?
Scott, are you going to be there tomorrow?
Sure will.
George, beware.
Beware.
Beware.
I thought you were going to say.
Be afraid.
Be very afraid.
Exactly.
My and local.

For pennies her coupons and dines.

Sounds like a good loss
Okay, Ruffin let's get this straight now because somebody says small correction Jimmy Ruffin recorded what becomes of the broken heart
And I was brother David yada yada yada well. Let me look up the rough ins here. We're just kind of rough in it anyway
A key word or a little count where nothing works
Jimmy Ruffin I told you what becomes of the broken hearted I had it wrong
Boy, I made a bad mistake. Well, thank you very much Jim for correcting me
It's his David was lead singer the temptation most of the early hits any chemist was originally
It's a very gritty decided to change the temptation to lead voice to the grittier David Ruffin
He had done the same well if he was lead singer the temptation at all a big hits
It's even more embarrassing than he only got one vote
Wouldn't you think you would he had done the same thing previously with these supreme is replacing original lead singer Mary Wilson in favor of Diana Ross
The story goes that David Ruffin left the temps in part because he wanted his brother Jimmy to join the group
I suspect it was more about Ruffin's ego than concerned for his brother's career
And anyway, David Ruffin left had a couple of small hits as a solo act and gradually slid into drug-addled oblivion and death
The temps replaced Ruffin with Dennis Edwards no kind of Ralph
Who would become the contours lead singer out of the contours?
Do you love me?
Like a friend after their glory after their glory days. Do you love me and shake sherry?
Edwards was something of a rough and sound like the liberal gritty of voice shadow on later temptations hits like cloud nine
Thanks James. Thanks for the correction. You're right. I'm wrong. I'm wrong
What becomes it a broken hearted reach number seven nine ten sixty six thirty seven years ago for all his old farts
For those of us who know Philip Brian from Brian, Bellamy
David Ruffin. Oh David Ruffin had some big hits by by his own
My whole world ended the moment you left me remember that no
You don't think a few bars. Oh my whole world ended the moment you left me. Oh walk away from love
Uh, a night at the Apollo live the way you do the things you do in my girl Darryl Hall, John Oates with David Ruffin Eddie Kendrick
Well, how about that
Jimmy Ruffin I've passed this way before that's what the guy at blockbuster probably says
Gonna give her
Sure he didn't wasn't his first effort gonna give her out of love. I got it. Hold on to my love. I don't know what that is
Jimmy Ruffin so there you go. We're kind of rough at it
As we try to get it right. Okay, as we try to get the facts straight here on QA
Unlike you're a president and a vice president and a bunch of liars and Washington
And I should point out to you that all the right wingers now including Miss Fudge
Who's got a big Bob Novak piece on there, which you can't believe anybody. They're all on the attack now
But against the Wesley Clark because they're all pinging their pants, but
I will say this and I'm not talking about their stuff. There isn't pretty good article. It's on our website
I think it's on our website in it. I think it's not
Maybe I'll have to read it. I don't think I got it under yesterday because I didn't want to send to early because Eric
It's all confused his first bad grade. It's from yesterday's news day by less pain
Isn't that what we all want is less pain? Yeah, so enjoy
I say if we could all just devote seven or eight hours a day to sex it sounds good to me get our priorities straight now
Four hours to work seven or eight hours a day to sex and like maybe three four hours a day to like picking out
And look all this is for trade oh, five six
Oh
There's a media blackout
And I'm gonna say what's going on that's wrong you right to know long gone
For media blackout no way is going to know what's going on
This way the whole administration can't go wrong
There's been a lot of protests lately, but then I gonna show you what they offer
What's them? They got business for the white house. They're only following orders
Outside of Caleb they don't want you to know what's going on
No, we'll never had to
All the broadcast media to deliver one message
People message in the dark
Yeah
Read the bottom papers babies
You know what's going on

340 votes on a poll should Caucasian only clubs and groups be permitted in the US a
Why not their groups for minorities 171 at 50.2%
Not in schools are publicly funded places 58 17% it seems a little clannish with a K 55
Will blood test be necessary?
30
5% and absolutely not it's bigotry
21 only 21 out of 344 votes 6% say absolutely not and I wonder what the hell their problem is
They're trying to be politically correct. Oh, you can't be doing that
Huh, I guess kind of garbage is that what I'll now garbage. I don't know
You've got the United Negro College Fund the United Asian whatever the hell that thing is that why can't we do this huh?

But that curry I think that the diet doesn't the diet has a way with the powers you are what you eat
Is it green what you eat?
So in other words if we call Joseph Gackie old penis face

Just like I was talking about before light bulb radio with their 95-year-old people. Oh, we're broadcasters. Well broadcasters
Right
Let me read this article by our less pain
Okay, let's paint in more joy
His first bad grade this is in yesterday's news day
He says is the ones of the Iraq War blow against the sitting U.S. President a four-star general flips his service camp into the ring
This general were told is starsly against the war this apparent oxymoron general Wesley Clark is no longer a general
It's amazing what clarity a tiny civilian suit can bring to generals after WW2 general Dwight
Eisenhower lost his taste for battle got himself elected president then warned the nation against the military
Industrial complex prior to his west point days Eisenhower turns out had been terminally influenced by his pacifist mother
Clark it appears came gung ho out of the womb after west point
He led a mechanized infantry unit in Vietnam got a serious purple heart and Jrian struggle successfully away his terminal limp in
Rehabilitation earning his first start age 43. He went on to command NATO forces hammering of Kosovo
Kosovo was not quite a war just as Iraq is not quite a piece still Clark was forced to retire and rethink his commitment to battlefield shock and awe
With eight draftivating candidates and one indecisive war hero the humvee of the democratic party
Hasn't yet gained traction against the Iraq war that bush tricked the country into along with the candidates who serve in Congress
U.S. soldiers continue to die daily in Iraq yet the complicit Democrats can't capitalize on his growing disaster
They authorized in walks Clark whose handlers would have us believe that his clean hands are against the Iraq war
The general is telegenic and a two tonics sort of way lean trim with an easy smile
He's also said to be raw-nerved and vicious and intelligent
So to support his last claim one childhood friend because that he never got less than an a on his report card
Many a straight-A reputation has fallen down upon examination, but this one stands pending examination
His west point record however is not a dispute of the 579 cadets in his 1966 class Clark graduated number one
Off the battlefield few generals who led their west point class have made much of a name for themselves in political life
General Douglas MacArthur who led his 1903 class of 93 comes to mind
But only as a world war two hero and self-absorbed potential presidential disaster
George Patton was 46th of 103 cadets in his 1909 class
William Westmore and the American commander in Vietnam was 112th of 276 and not surprisingly
Alexander Hague graduated near the bottom of his 1947 class at 214th of 310
The one general to make it to the White House last century was Eisenhower
Who in his 1915 Westpoint class ranked 61st out of 164
As a former army officer, let me state that academic brilliance is his valid or invalid a measurement of intelligence in the military
As it isn't civilian life however, Clark's Westpoint ranking suggests not only an egghead, but a bookworm sole committed to the art of war
The self-same warrior would have us believe conveniently that he's opposed to the Iraq war
Fortunately, Wesley Clark has a written record and that record is with so much of his broadcasted abuse is murky on the Iraq issue
In a series of columns for the times of London, Clark raised personal concerns about the wisdom of attacking with insufficient forces
Initially, he also advised that the US should exhaust all means to go in with international support
Clark lost all cautions however after the Western Britain stormed into a wreck under the deception
That Sodom Hussein had weapons of mass destruction weapons that the former NATO commander was convinced to say and owned
Under the April 10th times headline what must be done to complete a great victory
Clark enthused liberation is at hand
Liberation the powerful bomb that justifies painful sacrifices in the year
Yet a bit more work and some careful reckoning need to be done before we take our triumph
Triumph indeed is the note Clark sounded throughout the column at one point
He praised Bush and Blair for their steely resolve and essentially going it alone
His visions in the column suggested ecstasy and celebration not to doubt and opposition is handlers and our generating
Let's have those parades on the mollum downtown constitution avenue, but don't demobilize yet Clark wrote
There's a lot yet to be done and not only by the diplomats
Clark reportedly has never finished second anything
He's not likely to finish second among the 10 Democrats
He's also not likely to finish first the question on the generals are back policy is how can he possibly get an a
Pretty interesting a sharp by less paid in the yesterday's news day
And of course that'll probably rattle the cages some of the old cockers that were out there at the deli damn last week
Getting all enthused and whipping it up to a frenzy you know i'm talking about oh yeah exactly
All the old eight k's in Hollywood maybe they thought they were given like three bagels in the and dill they were
Could be didn't that guy kill him saw dill

So deep in your eyes
It's
out
Crazy
Cops 16 at 560, Archivist sitting on the edge of your chair waiting for the court to
decide later today about the California vote.
Oh yeah, keep the channel right on there.
Right.
Hang on a, this fact you just sent me from a board in Bokers grade.
Yeah.
And it goes to show the depth of hysteria.
See, this is why we're doing it again today.
The last of our series of polls on dead people just to piss off moment.
It looks like it's working.
Absolutely.
It says Neil, most fire reports on Moe have been silly, but last night's dolphin broadcast
bears repeating that often's won the coin to us with the receiving team.
Charlie Rogers caught the ball.
It made about a 20 yard gain.
Moe went on the comment, well, there's at least there's one Roger's in this town who
can do something right.
All right.
Silence.
Mad Dog is speechless.
Now, keep in mind, this is on the Miami Dolphin football network.
OK.
Right.
At least there's one Roger's in this town who can do something where Mad Dog's speech
was silence.
However, sometime close to halftime, Moe made an observation on the game and Mad Dog said,
that's not the way things are done here, Mr. Lamot.
Silence.
Now, Moe is speechless.
I guess Mad Dog really does have a pair.
Perhaps George could find that dropper was great.
How do you like that?
Just when you thought he was on as as for your polices, I think Henry Ford should be on it.
He's on it.
Think about it.
In fact, we can change the pool now.
Eric, the first one, 412, which should Caucasian only clubs and groups be permitted.
Why not?
Their groups for minorities, 212, 51.4%.
Not in schools are publicly funded places.
66.
It seems a bit clannish with a K. 63.
Will blood tests be necessary?
41.
And the answer is, and absolutely not.
It's bigotry.
37.2% of you think it's bigotry for a white only club.
Anyway, he says, as for your pool, I think Henry Ford should have wanted to think about
it.
If Ford hadn't invented the card, there'd be no SUVs.
No reason to invade Iraq and no money for Cheney and Bush.
Oh, they'd find it out the way.
Cheney and Pearl and Wolfowitz and that crowd of grave robbers.
Those far missing the right wing claim.
I think Richard Pearl is Jewish, isn't he?
Oh, I'm positive about it.
Well, he's one of those Jews for Israel.
5.6705.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.
Your all-time favorite dead person, not on those previous pools.
And we're not going to, if you're not into those other previous pools, don't know what
it is, then lay out.
Do they have to be dead?
Well, you have to be good.
Dr. Robert Atkins, who taught us not only how to lose weight, but also don't slip and
fall on an icy sidewalk and don't hit your head or your date.
The thanks for calling, lady, Faye, Barbara Kampenman.
Why am I putting her Barbara Kampenman on his career?
I'm not really any of those.
It's probably we'll do it anyway just to make that guy happy.
Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Walt Disney, Carl Sagan.
And Wayne, the outer ages of universe.
Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, Alfred, he sounded like he was constipated during that whole
narration on Cosmos.
It sounded like he hadn't had a good BM in years.
Billions and billions of years.
Billions and billions of years.
Between his last good turn.
Sigmund Freud, in that effect, really, can you think of Carl Sagan having a bomb move?
But it's just, I don't know.
It just seems unscengely for an intellectual guy like him.
But if he did, he'd analyze it closely.
Probably.
Maybe, pick through it.
Sigmund Freud, Alfred Kinsey, Henry Ford, Robert Fulton, the old steamboat guy, steamboat
Willie, and Mark Twain.
And that's it.
We don't sure how many on here do we?
When we did Thursday, I don't remember what that was.
It was so damn important.
Well, because this is historical and that one was political, the music won no problem.
We had like an endless list.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I have someone for your poll.
OK.
Dave Thomas.
Dave Thomas.
We wouldn't have Wendy's.
We wouldn't have all those clog arteries without Dave Thomas.
There you go.
We love Wendy's.
I love Wendy's too.
Thanks, Neil.
You're sad.
The only thing that pisses me off is that every now and then they come up with some
special new thing and it's so good and you love it and then they discontinue it.
There you go.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
OK.
Have a great day.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That's my kind of girl right there.
She hates salad.
She wants the big triple cheese with bacon and lettuce and all kinds of good.
You know, maybe when they figure out how to fry salad, then that would be good.
They probably they're probably working on it right now.
I'll tell you one thing.
If you do eat there enough, you'll be fried.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
I mean, how can there be any comparison?
You know, seriously, to show I guess it's more expensive, right?
What Wendy's the McDonald's are booger.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
You get no comparison.
Anybody with any kind of taste whatsoever?
Anybody with taste buds that are operating would tell you when these is like heads and
shoulders.
I mean, because you want to know why?
Because they boil the meat.
Because it's juicy.
It's just dripping with fat.
I'm not talking about which is better for you.
I mean, that's that's up to you.
You know, they actually make it fresh.
They really do.
You can check.
Well, you say they make it fresh, but if you go through some of those Wendy's drive
through is later than I what they do.
Yeah, you never know.
Is they like cook them earlier and they like send them off to the side and then they
reheat them back on the oven again.
You know, back on the grill.
Right.
And in too much of a thrill when they reheat it on the grill.
But at any rate and blueberry hill, how about fat stomino?
And that's right.
He's still alive.
Let's do that again.
Oh, seriously?
Is there and why do people eat at Burger King?
I mean, McDonald's is not good, but at least you know what it's going to be.
Right.
Burger King.
I'm sorry.
I just for the life of me, there's no reason that those people ought to be in business.
It's rubber.
No, it's rubber.
Their burgers come through a conveyor belt and they're rubber.
You could drive your guy to him car on it about 80 miles.
Just get for it.
Just get for a whopper's man.
There you go.
Look him up to your hubcaps.
You're home.
Homey.
One of the back for a spare.
Right.
That's right.
Get five to go.
Get a double whopper with cheese.
I only need one to go though.
I'm serious.
Burger King is crap.
Their onion rings are an insult to the intelligence of human race.
They're nasty.
They're like little tiny.
They're like turd.
They're onion turds.
With breaded.
They're like about 90% breading and they're like maybe if you look real hard, there's
like a little bit of onion inside.
It's onion in quotes.
Right.
Cheese is cake, Christ man.
Burger King.
Mlow's.
Those of you people out there don't want to cry.
And I have some good news.
Todd Dreck finally gave me some good piece of news.
Our good friends at Vic and Irv's in Fort Lauderdale getting good response.
That's good to hear.
You don't have to be from Rochester to enjoy a good Rochester White Hut or any of the
other good stuff there.
Would all like a Rochester hot sauce on it.
Mmm.
Terrier Kishki's out.
But it's good.
So glad to hear that.
And you know what it reminded me of?
I was thinking about this before.
When I first came to QAM, first of all, I shocked them by saying that before I started
it on the year, I want to have a sit down meeting with the sales department.
They were just astonished.
Like, what could that possibly be about?
You know?
Yeah.
And then I shocked them even more.
I told them about how I wanted to have those client response sheets for our live endorsement
spots.
What are you talking about?
And they looked at me like, are you crazy?
In other words, you really care about whether you get response for their clients or not?
Now, that lasted for about what?
30 minutes.
How many minutes?
We had a few of those and then they like laughed it off and said, screw you, it's too much
work we can't be bothered.
So when Todd Greck actually gave me a client response this morning from a Vick and Irv's,
it was like a breath of fresh air, especially coming from a putts like Todd, who generally
speaking, doesn't give a crap.
He was just sucking around.
Here's a call from Hollywood.
Hello?
Hey, Neil.
I'll send my way to Miami Springs right now.
But the deli thing, I never got a chance to make it.
Sorry, Zell, I wanted to go there.
I wanted to see what was going on.
Number two, general clerk or any other general, any guy, it doesn't matter what his grade
standard was in West Point or the Naval Academy.
Some of the low balls that actually had pretty good military careers.
But some of the other guys, they were number one in the class and where were they?
You still living?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm not so Jewish, but I make my living selling coach or booth.
You know how delis like to make celebrity sandwiches?
Yeah.
Like the Neely Burger and the DAK, well, they've been asking me forever, they want to make
a Celia cruise sandwich.
But nobody supplied a ferocious meat.
Okay.
5.6.7, I need to go all of that time and I come up with that.
5.6.7.0, 5.60, orders the Sabers beaten the Leafs in the next division game.
4.2, last night, the air candidate.
Three all.
Some more.
Leafs in Montreal, tomorrow's that what he just said.
Okay.
I don't know.
Tree hockey intensive already.
Panthers scored nine goals in their first exhibition this game.
Then they got their ass kicked by Colorado in the second game.
Any interest net yet?
Well, we got the Marlins Marlins.
I guess I should probably give the schedule out.
We got so much heavy duty crap going on today.
Like that last call.
Mad Dog at two, the mad dog who called now.
What did he call him again?
I already schmitkin that facts.
He called him, let's see, I got it right here.
Mr. Lamot.
Oh, that kind of like pie alamo in it.
I'd like to see like a big chocolate cream pie, pie alamo.
Round top of his evolved spot.
You have to hop where it's you'll as 4 to 7 to 7.
Preceding the big, big Marlins on deck at 7 Marlins at the brave 735 last game.
And that's serious.
Any camp at the baseball game?
Joe and Mark with their lowly rated show overnight, 2 to 5 and a.m.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on, I guess I better vote on the new pool.
New pool is up.
The main of head of the day.
It's like in boxing, you know, they have to prelims and then they have the main bow.
Right.
No doubt.
Well, let's see, I pick Ben Franklin.
Somebody as well vote for him right because I still say electricity man has got it all
beat without electricity.
What the hell with Thomas Edison have had to work without electricity?
If you wouldn't have gone on float, float that kite.
We got just a few votes on here.
Walt Disney's got five.
Carl Siggins got four.
Ben Franklin's got four.
Nice going, Ben.
Go fly it again, maybe.
The thanks for calling.
Maybe he's got three Charles Dowell.
Dow one's got three.
Mark Twain, two one for Dave Thomas, one for Barbara Campanman, one for Albert Einstein,
one for Siggin Freud, one for Dr. Bob Atkins.
And nobody else got none.
But that's 2026 votes.
Just went up there.
New poll.
OK, hop on it.
And don't forget tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. are the lovely Miguel will be at the computer
technology showcase at the Brewer County Convention Center.
Just look for the, well, is he going to be an event or what?
Inside going to be inside, huh?
Inside inside inside.
Oh, the best of you will be there.
Plus maybe some of the old CDs, the Mohawar David of Keychain and some of the Mad Dog
Keychains, whatever we have left over and those are going fast to food.
And you can spend the prize wheel for Marlon Tickets to go by there and spin at Ville.
Probably be the most exciting thing that happens to all year long in South Florida.
27 past noon at 560 WQM.
If you're on the Atkins diet, speaking of the late great Dr. Bob, my close personal friend,
you know, he autographed one of the books for me personal.
Yeah, I knew that.
I watched.
Do you think it's worth a few bucks now?
About 30, man.
If you're on one of those low carb diets like the Atkins or the Suzanne Summers, I still
say, why couldn't it have been her on the sidewalk?
You know, I mean, that's cruel.
But if we had to choose between her and Dr. Bob, because she's just a ripoff artist,
she just stepped out on a bandwagon.
Here's the great story to fight all kinds of low carb snacks and goodies.
Delights the West Book of the number one low carb store in the universe over 900.
I bet you they got over a thousand and maybe one of these days, Troy will give me some

I've not found Riley's door.
He was frowns, he was groovy and in fact, he never shaved.
He was just about to put a can into the microwave.
I used the bathroom and he said he didn't care and he was reading the.
You know what?
That's not the one I wanted to play.
Oh, wow.

Oh, my friend, think of us and let the red neck bar.
Oh, I saw Jesus.
I saw Jesus, oh, stick, oh, I'll go by the way.
I saw Him in my shaving cream so I let Him on my face.
When I went to work, I looked like a jerk and I was fired in the street.
Driving home, I was all alone, thinking someone's playing tricks on me.
But in the near future, I could see Jesus.
He's staring back at me.
He's my soul, Jesus, oh, stick, oh, I'll go by the way.
I saw Him in my pop up, no, there is a seed in my car.
Oh, my friend, think of us and the red neck bar.
Oh, I saw Jesus, oh, stick, oh, I'll go by the way.

I heard of that great Carl Allen Trautler, Moll Bandy, I've got you to know.
Traut 35 at 560, look who's leading our poll right now.
Who's your all time favorite dead person not on the previous polls?
Okay, we've been doing dead people for a few days kind of like quasi-moto
Thanks for calling in fact, you know something maybe that's what the Clarissata try
Thanks for calling ladies got 13
See Ben Franklin 11 Dave Thomas 9 all before I finish reading the poll
I'm inspired for tomorrow's poll see it doesn't take too much to get me going on the food
Okay, I know we've done this before but it's been a long time
The best fast food chain is
Okay, okay, we'll do that tomorrow. I will save the other one for later in a week
The other one the straight brown eye
Oh, here's T. R. North Miami says I'll get don't let me forget about the poll the United Negro College fun
Ghost to support historically black colleges and universities these school have an open enrollment and any race of student is welcomed
Well, so what would be wrong with the United Caucasian way of what college fun with the same policies
The schools allow students who otherwise might not qualify to attend other public or private universities a chance for higher education at a reduced cost
In short the term Negro in the UNCF for first of what schools are historically a number of these schools are no longer majority
Africa and American
Some of that is going to be definition of these terms and in fact many specific colleges and schools of these institutions
Which receives support of the ones you have our majority white will I'll be
More so statistics like only a two and a half percent of American positions were African American and really all of them had been trained at one of
the two historically black colleges and university Howard or Mary indicate not only the historical value but current necessity of these colleges
View it starkly what harm came for a come from companies who donate to us. I don't think there's any harm from it
Lastly is there a significant difference between UNCF and the Heritage Fund at Titan American funds Jewish Hill L
Fund conservative Christian was funds there are thousands of racially restricted scholarships
UNCF is different in that funds a class of institutions not a class of individuals got it?
No
In closing Cisco had zero to do with rap was never a rap star never performed on a rap tour

Court bans religious gifts to classmates all right
Kindergarteners and first-waters may not distribute to their classmates gifts that very religious message
According to a ruling by a federal appeals court. Thank God
Oh God the 30 us circuit court of appeals recently ruled in favor of a New Jersey elementary school in
Forbiting a boy from giving out pencils with a message Jesus loves the little children with a heart similar symbol substituted for the word love
They'll stray
No, the classroom is not a place for student advocacy wrote chief US circuit judge Anthony J. Skarica
Speaking for the court in walls versus aga harbor township board of education. Oh, I love that aga harbor township board
The school he said has a legitimate area of control regarding speech within school confines and the younger the student the more control of school may exercise he added
but
The Charlottesville based Rutherford Institute, which is representing Daniel Waltz. I wonder if he's kin to Jack Waltz
You think no
How do you know? Oh, I don't get how many day go get any what grease ball come out of the woodware
Which is representing Daniel Waltz now nine plans to appeal the case to a full-benture 12 judges of third circuit and have necessary to the US Supreme Court
The recent unanimous ruling which was handed down August 27th was made by three judges at stakes had Rutherford
President John White it is constitutionally protected speech
He called the third circuit ruling a dangerous trend ride. I call it the 9-11 fallout
He said the courts as the schools have complete authority to decide what they want said if they don't like a kid's religion
They can pick the kid pick on the kid or if a black kids his Martin Luther King was the greatest person alive if a teacher didn't like that
He could just kick the message out
This idea that we have to watch everything and given the authorities power country
It's a long line of supreme court cases
Mr. Whitehead said even if the first amendment is involved the third circuit is saying control control control goes to the schools
The case began April 98 when Daniel then four and his pre-cindergarten classmates attended a party at school
All the kids brought treats to share Daniel came with the pencils which the teacher confiscated Daniel's mother Dana Walts
Who was in the classroom at the time as a chaperone immediately appealed the matter of the principal the principal assistant superintendent
And superintendent said Daniel could distribute the pencils only during
Non-instructional time because they didn't want the school to be held responsible for endorsing Christianity
All right fairy tales
In December 98 when Daniel and his kindergarten classmates and another party at the school Mrs. Walts
Con-contact of the school's lawyer beforehand to obtain permission for Daniel to distribute candy canes with a Christian themed story
Attached you notice the pattern here sure the little proselytizer
She was informed that Daniel could do so only outside the building during his free time
In December 99 Mrs. Walts informed the school that her son wanted to distribute more candy with a Christian message attached to it again
She was turned down the child ended up giving out the candy in the hallway. Oh
Oh aren't they in forging on his rights?
In May 2000 the Rutherford Institute filed a suit on behalf of the child saying his first amendment rights had been violated
In February 2002 US district judge Jerome B. Simon Dale a federal judge based in Camden New Jersey
Side of a school district blaming the mother for being the driving force behind the distribution of those items and in this lawsuit
It was highly unlikely he wrote that then four-year-old Daniel was able to independently read and advocate the dissemination of the message on the pencils
Joe Bentley the lawyer representing the H. Harbour Township School District also said the mother's influence was a problem
The parents were using their classroom to proselytize
He said there's a difference between a kids ability to understand the difference between what's endorsed by the school board
And what's allowed because the school is taking a neutral position?
Is that pathetic or what you far missing a gliman others out there who want to continue trying to pedal crap down people's throat
Keep your fairy tales to yourselves you crazy people you
That's what I have to say to you about what is the Virgin Mary on my window right now Jesus Christ and he's he's coming next week for lunch
I've got all my idea what are freaking country man religious intolerance and of course now you got what is these fascists you got running
It's perfect on their belt buckles. It probably says God is mid wounds
That's what it says what does that mean?
Means it's all a bunch of crap is what it means
It means God is Jewish and don't you ever forget a little spick

a Phillies and with a Cubs right on their ass right Cubs win tonight and Marlins
the Cubs will be in first in the wild card oh they will they're that close that

rickia Bullo!
versatile
She wants to get back
哪 I got this
She's a tomorrow, a tomorrow, a tomorrow, a real deal.
Oh, what do you guys think?
The real deal.
What do you know about that guy?
What do you know about that guy?
He's a tomorrow, a tomorrow, a tomorrow, a tomorrow.
A tomorrow, a tomorrow, a tomorrow, a tomorrow.
You get down, you get down, my bar, my bar.
We know all the time.
I'm on it, call.
One in 15 is five, six years.
That's not all the two bullets already.
That's the look of Brian Jr.
Here's the fact is, how about Jim Henson?
I started to write it down and I realized he was on TV a lot.
Say what now?
Jim Henson.
What about him?
With the Muppets.
Yeah.
Well, they were like TV performers.
Right?
Well, he wouldn't be on there today, right?
You're right, he's blowing on the entertainers.
Right, there you go.
But, Billy in focus is, my person is Nicola Tesla.
I wonder if he's related to a Rusty Klusla place for Columbus Blue Jackets.
Or I sure hope to, oh man.
Hey Rusty, let me take a look at it.
Below is some of the things he invented.
By the way, can I just mention, can I just as an aside?
Because I watched Michigan State beat those awful Notre Dame fighting Irish those for.
And is there any other football team in America that's got its own network beside Notre Dame?
No.
That's a Catholic influence again.
NBC that carries all the Notre Dame gives one of the greatest graces on the American cultural scene.
And yet nobody says anything about it except yours truly.
That would be like one of the networks carrying all the Shiva games, you know?
Kind of crap is that crap.
But anyway, Michigan State did beat Notre Dame even though we tried to choke it at the end there.
And speaking of choking it, the second, the backup quarterback for Notre Dame, maybe Scott Knowswood is Brady something?
No.
Why is it that all quarterbacks named Brady?
In his case, it's his first name, it's supposed to Tom Brady.
Why is it that all quarterbacks named Brady?
Look so goddamn good.
Jesus, I almost started rooting for Notre Dame.
I know this almost, not quite.
But holy crap, where the hell can he be seen?
And I was sticking to like a The Brady Bunch, but there was nobody good looking on the Brady Bunch.
It's not even close.
Right?
None of the guys anyway.
And none of the girls were not cute on the Brady Bunch.
They were like nasty little, uh, man-be-pambi, them were cute.
I'd do Marsha, I'd do her right now.
Oh, geez!
Oh!
Right now?
Right now.
She's 82.
And?
I'll bring my own KY.
I bet your clearance would do her.
He knew anything.
He was trying to do the sink earlier this morning is what I heard.
He was intergoing.
Thinkrathwim, thinkrathwim.
Anyway, so the eye of the storm is so which you'll find in Spencer Gibbs was invented by Nicola Tesla.
Thomas Edison stole many inventions from her.
See that?
I guess used to be very popular.
George Eastman stole all kinds of inventions from Edison.
And Edison was stealing all kinds of stuff from this guy.
So Nicola Tesla put it on there.
He invented all kinds of crap, which I can't read the rest of the facts, but I'll take his word for it.
Got it?
Got it.
But thanks for calling me.
And he was, of course, we don't believe that.
But nevertheless, that's okay.
You notice how all of a sudden we got the bogus vote today?
That's all right.
That's fine with me.
She's got 40.
Do you believe it?
Oh, name recognition.
No.
These people, it's our crowd.
No.
Oh, name recognition.
You may as opposed to Ben Franklin.
Right.
Oh!
How about Franklin Pangborn?
What?
Thanks for calling, Lady 48.
Dave Thomas 22.
It's not even close with the crank votes.
Ben Franklin 21.
Walt Disney 19.
Albert Einstein 16.
Carl Sagan 14.
Charles, by the way, Hitler can't be on here.
Political figure.
Everybody did that.
That's right.
Charles Darwin 13.
Dr. Bob Atkins 8.
Mark 28.
A lot of grits and stuff.
I guess is what Mark 28.
Samuel Langhorn Clemens.
I don't know.
I'm just not, I'm not that big of a Mark Twain fan.
You know, he was kind of a crimudgelly cleverer, humorous guy.
You know, he created the revolutionary style of writing the way people talk,
which apparently had never occurred to anyone before.
Did he write y'all come back now?
You hear?
You knew the word nigger a lot.
Did he really?
Yes, he did.
Well, today's good thing he ate on this station.
5.67.
He did his hair 50.
No, I'm just pounding right now.
It's a good thing he ate on this station because God only knows.
He's trying to craft.
He did his shit.
You never know.
Right.
Okay.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Good, good one.
Louis Pasteur.
Louis Pasteur.
Yep.
That is a good one.
Okay, thank you.
What about, what about, what is his wife name, Maria?
Marie?
Marie Cree.
Marie Cree.
Yeah.
Did she invent a thermometer, right?
That's filled with Marie Cree?
Oh.
And they also said, I just read this a couple of weeks ago somewhere,
or maybe we discussed it that if you break it like you don't have to worry about mercury,
remember you always used to get told, don't break the thermometer because the mercury is poison.
Right.
It is not.
It's not.
Says who?
Says wherever I read it.
Says it's not as dangerous as you think.
I mean, not like swallow a whole bunch of it.
But and so they're also saying that even the mercury in the fish you eat isn't the big deal no more.
Well, that's a relief.
Don't you feel better?
So it's Pasteur E-U or E.
E-U-E-R.
Louis Pasteur.
Get that French right.
No, no, no.
At least this Roger's can do something right.
I was so embarrassed.
It's so bushly.
It hasn't really even permeated my skull yet.
That would be like bringing my name up to Jimmy Johnson.
And we're right.
Who would do such a thing?
Oh, he did.
Idiotic.
Pathetic.
An overgrown child.
That's what you are, Moe, an old man who never grew up.
I think if you like give him like a rattle in a spoon, he'd start banging him on the counter there in the morning.
Oh, he's got a rattle.
Oh, he's got a rattle.
Well, that's easy to rattle his ass.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
May that's why he keeps taking him dingleberries off it.
Somebody's rattling it.
Here's a call.
I notice how easy it was to rattle for real this morning.
Boy, you better butch up a little baby.
His image went way, way down with me this morning.
What a crack a crap.
He took that personal about getting the spots in before he ended up 10 o'clock.
I mean, that's his business.
And this man has taken it personal.
You could tell he had like a big gigantic bug, a bug of his ass.
He had a bug bug.
No question about it.
Where the hell is that?
Oh, it's like this.
You're taking a scary person.
Yeah.
I'll get it.
Well, heavy all right tomorrow or not.
Here's for Lauderdale.
Hello.
For Lauderdale.
Could be the most important call we've had all day.
You like it so far?
Oh, it's candle.

As you discovered in blood, when I cut the cheese over the weekend, and believe you, I've been around some gaming people.
Whoa.
You could try not to smell them, and it doesn't work.
And the worst thing about it is when you see somebody, it looks really good, and like in the elevator.
You say, oh, maybe I'll just kind of like, sidel up and, and whoa.
You just, you get off on the next floor.
I mean, even if it's like the 37th floor and you're going out of the main floor, you don't care.

I'm against.
Yeah.
Like I jumped and skipped all across the blockbuster when that guy, I knew like real subtle things like say, holy crap, who died in here.
Things like that.
I think my head spun around twice.
Like when the crow used to come in all the time with an e.
See, it's not only people who smell bad, but people who think that they smell good, but overdo it.
I mean, tremendously, you know what I'm talking about?
Oh, geez.
People who wear about like 80 pounds of cologne or a talcum powder are both.

Hmm.

560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line on a tremendous a tumultuous
Monday. Got its only freaking Monday. Holy crap. Here's the call from Miramar.
Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Fantastic. Well, he lunched
ahead of his my little room while sitting there contemplating. I thought of John
Krapper, the inventor of the modern day toilet. Where would we be without the
Krapper excellent point. That's my that's my point for today. So I'll have on that note.
I'll leave you my hotmate. And I hope it was a successful visit. It was. It was I
expelled all my precious body fluids cleared my life outstanding. Nice job,
howdy. Thanks. See you on the Krapper. John Krapper. That was his name. Yes, it was.
See, well, now when you come right down to it, I guess that's where obviously
that's where the Krapper came from. But Krapper being sure for Krapper, right? Right.
So we can thank John Krapper not just for the toilet, but for right. What a
bunch of or just go take a good healthy. Yeah, or you're full of crap. Yeah. So we can
thank John Krapper not just for the actual facility itself for the porcelain
bus, but also for all the other things that go along with it. Like yeah, let's
fill it up with some. Or Greg Reed is always full of that. Or Mo is walking.
Boy, where would we be without crap? You know what? 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 TN
for Ryzen Line. Thanks for calling, lady, for some reason tickle the fancy of the
crank car voters today. Yeah, you know that. I mean, I'd like to think that I mean,
we all loved to relax. She was great, but a little bogus you might say a little.
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi, or you? Pretty good. Scott doesn't know what he's
talking about. Not only are the Marlins a game in a half ahead of the Cubs, the Cubs
don't even play today. Yeah. So I didn't think it comes over that tight on the
rascals. They were like they've faltered there for a little while. Yeah. That's
that's the game in a half over the Cubs, two in a loss. Scott says that you can bet his
life on it. You know what I mean? Make some money. Right. My contribution is lay on
outdoor bed in she. I think we're going to see the caprio. I was hoping he was dead.
Wow. Leonardo da Vinci. How can they leave him out? My God. He's the Renifold's man.
He ridden a one a freaking genius if there ever was one. Thanks a lot, Pally. See
it. See Scott again. You're just still letting us down. But at least one thing. Scott
may not be good, but he's consistent. If he tells you something, look it up. Right?
Yeah. I didn't say what it comes one today. You said if the Cubs won today in a
Marlins lost, if the Cubs would pass them in the standings, they'd be in a wild
herd. You know, I said the cut. That's what you said. If what? If the Marlins
lose today in the Cubs win. Win like a week from Sookas. Yeah, about them. Yeah.
The Cubs ain't playing today. I need to wear the Phillies. The Filth at
Alphier Phillies. Boy, that's serious tomorrow. Let me say it again. I don't want to
start putting pressure on anybody and I'm not. Don't get me wrong. I hope they do
well. You want to know one of the reasons I hope they do well, George? Why? Because
if that Marlins make the playoffs as a wild card, there are four games. See? Go
boys and girls. So we get some more day games like those one o'clock game. Yeah, the
only problem being that they would start in San Francisco, I believe. Am I right
about that? Scott got up. So he can't answer. Oh, yes. He says yes. No, I know that.
But there would be games in Florida at PB Park and they can't play them all like a,
you know, because they got four series is going on. So maybe we get like a break
in there somewhere along the line. Not that we're looking to get off any day is
zero. And are we? Oh, we love those Marlins. So my point being that if there's any
empty seats tomorrow through Thursday against the Phillies, Miami will you have your
chance to show your ass to the world. Okay. How's the weather today, by the way?
I don't know out there. Yeah, out there.
Hot and human. I don't know. I don't know. But I'm just saying it's not like there's any
gigantic rain storm or any excuses yet. I mean, this is only I mean, they're in Atlanta
night, but I'm just looking ahead. In fact, I'm going to be checking the weather. Very careful.
I'm going to look at the radar right on my pewter here every day. No excuses. Okay. If
there's any chance that it's a baseball town, which sure, of course we know it's not.
But if there was any chance, here's your opportunity to get out there and to show your your
tangible support and quit all the BS. Just like when the panthers season starts, where
I think that could be, you know, speaking of stupidity in my own, I just realized here
about 20 minutes ago. What? That I've been sitting on the floor here for like two years.
I must be a moron. No, seriously, because I put this chair together. Okay. Right. Bob
her move my close personal redneck friend order this chair for me. This orifice chair
after they put that big green ugly old saggy chair in here, like a bunch of idiots. And
so ordered me this orifice here in a cane one day from office depot. And I put it together.
And it's very comfortable. It's very similar to the one you're asked to sit in right now.
The only problem is it's got the same kind of a lever on the side, a lever lever. All
right. And I had it too low. And it's just dawned on me after all this time being a little
bit slow in the febrile. I'm sitting on the flow. You know, too low. You're on the flow.
You know, sometimes the hydraulic leak. So you got to say, I think I think it was
especially when there's a big fat tub of crap like I said, and it's been like taking
a slow leak, squirt, squirt, squirt, squirt. And I'm like sitting on the floor. And I
thought, I don't want to do this no more. And so I like moved up in the world. Now I feel
like a real man almost as opposed to Oliver B 19 till two or five 60. Hey, you'll feel
like a real guy. If you call VIP sportsbook.com, we've got about 7,000 sports books advertising

Coo-hoo, baby. Let's turn this mother out.
Puff the magic crapper. And the reason I played it is because we got the wrong name. The
fact it was right. It's Thomas Crapper. Okay. And it's not only Thomas Crapper, it's
sure Thomas Crapper. Wow. Indeed. This is from plumbingworld.com. One of the most
prestigious websites I've had the pleasure of discovering a long time. Thomas Crapper,
myth and reality. Myth, Thomas Crapper as a person ever existed. In fact, that we don't
know his actual date of birth. We can now say that the man Thomas Crapper probably was
born September 1836 since he was baptized the 28th of that month. Crapper did have
a successful career in the plumbing industry in England from 1861 to 1904. And it
goes on about his death and his birth in Yodia. Myth, Thomas Crapper invented the turlif.
Although I will say this, you probably would assume his name would be John. Nobody says
right. I got to go to the Thomas. Right. Right. Maybe they will know. In fact, nobody
in the no one in the know about Thomas Crapper would ever make the statement that he invented
the toilet in his research. Who's this guy? Grabowski? His name comes out because I skipped
over a bunch of stuff. Well, whoever this Grabowski is. Maybe he's related to Mrs. Grabowski.
Remember her Mary and G? If you have him, the sex lady. No. Oh, she's probably dead.
In his research, Grabowski has created a detailed history of Crapper's business life. The
man holds nine patents for improvements to drains, three for water closets, the old WC,
one for manhole covers and last for pipe joints. Every patent application for plumbing related
products filed by Crapper made it through the process and actual patents were granted.
The most famous product that contributed him wasn't invented by him at all. The silent
valveless water waste preventer was a siphonic discharge system in Laudatoria to flush effectively
when the sister was only half full. That British patent was issued in 1819 to Mr. Albert
Giblin for this product and it goes on and on and on. Myth, Thomas Crapper was never
a plumber. Oh, yes, he was, as the fact. He operated two of the three Crapper plumbing
shops in his lifetime, but left a business three years before the final and most famous
facility on Kings Road and London because he hated work like crap. Myth, the word crap
is derived from Thomas Crapper's name. In fact, the origin of crap is still being... I love
it. This is the greatest thing I've ever read in my life. Everything you know is wrong.
The origin of crap is still being debated. I think it started with mode, don't you?
Absolutely. Possible sources include the Dutch Crap A, K-R-A-P-P-E,
low German Crap, K-R-A-P, meaning a violent and edible fish, Middle East crap with two
peas in an E, and Thomas Crapper. Where crap is derived from crap or it is by a process
known as pardon the pun, a back formation. The World War I dobo is passing through England
brought together crappers named in the toilet. They saw the words T. Crapper, Chelsea printed
it on the tanks and quinn to song, crapper meaning the slang, crapper meaning toilet.
The legend of Thomas Crapper takes its flavor from the... that takes its flavor from the real man's
life. Woo! Just savor that flavor. While crapper may not be the inventor of the product,
he's most often associated with his contribution to England's plumbing history as significant
and the man's legend, well, it lives on despite all proof to the contrary. How do you like that?
Huh? Well, I feel very enlightened now. Plumbingworld.com for those who are really obsessed with the
bull. What was the name of the guy that really invented it now? Again? Oh, I have to go back to it.
Oh, nevermind. Throw it away, I'll look it up. No, I got it here somewhere. Never heard that before.
The guy who invented the toilet was Albert Giblin. Giblin. The silent valveless water waste
preventer. Now I got something important to read, okay? Do I have permission to read it? Okay.
I'm not very long, but it's about the Bush and Ted Kennedy, which I'm sure some people
saw this, but it's worth reading, escalating and increasingly bitter rhetorical feud over Iraq.
President Bush fired back at Senator Ted Kennedy and Massachusetts yesterday saying it was
uncivil for the Democrat to accuse the administration of driving foreign nations to take part in the
post-war effort. Bush said the Senator should not have made the remark. Kennedy criticized the White
House last week for using what he described as concocted evidence against Iraq and said the case
for war was a fraud. Absolutely correct sir. In a separate appearance, Kennedy also described an
8.5 billion dollar loan guarantee to Turkey as an administration attempt to bribe the country
into offering military assistance in Iraq. The remarks sparked a partisan battle over the
appropriateness of criticizing the President with House Majority Leader Tom Delay accusing Kennedy
of reaching a new low. Bush, who had originally declined to respond to the attack,
used an interview with Fox News Anchorman, Brett Humeas, that he'd take Kennedy to task. What a surprise.
I mean, Senator Kennedy, who I respect and with whom I've worked, should not have said we were
trying to bribe foreign nations, Bush said, according to a partial transcript made available last night
by Fox. I mean, my regret is I don't mind people trying to pick apart my policies and that's fine
and that's for a game, but you know, I don't think we're serving our nation well by allowing the
discourse to become so uncivil that people say, use words that they shouldn't be using. Democrats
have been infuriated by similar comments in the past saying that Republicans are trying to cast
them as unpatriotic because of their questions about Bush's foreign policy. Last night, Kennedy
responded in a statement saying, for the sake of our troops, it's time for this administration to
speak honestly about that's faders in Iraq. Many Americans share my views and I regret that
the president considers them uncivil. Jim Jordan campaign manager for scary Senator John Kerry,
who voted in favor of authorizing the interaction in Iraq said it's always amusing to see
anybody from the Bush administration accusing Democrats of uncivility. Kind of like Greg Reed calling
Georgia Liar.
Yo.
Uncle Ted dude, throw on some boxer shorts. Let's cruise a bar and rage with some babes. Excellent.
Our money.
Uncle Ted dude, let's use our end to the slap's name to impress the babes and do the wild thing
in the compound. No way Bill. Just wait, Ted. Excellent.
They're rich, they're powerful. They like to swim naked. William gonna be smitten. Then
you're gonna be in the lunches. Next for the venture are two the next genitiles.
Excellent.
Coming soon for a bit of you for your next excellent. That was exciting. A little finger
slippage on a button there. Keep you on your toes anyway. I love when it happens.
Anyway, I don't have time to read this whole thing because I would read one more piece but it's
on our website. I was just checking to make sure that it's on there today and it is by Eric
Margolis and yesterday's Toronto Sun and this is the article I was talking about before where he
makes reference to Hermann Gehring. You'll love it. Porsche's tame US media may yet have teeth
rights Eric Margolis. He says, I've long considered CNN's Christian Almond Ford Outstanding Journalist.
Last week, my opinion of her rose further when she ignited a storm of controversy when asked
by a TV interviewer about the US media's coverage of the Iraq War. Breaking a taboo of silence
in the mainstream media, Almond Ford courageously replied, I think the press was muzzled and I think
the press self muzzle television was intimidated by the Bush administration and its foot soldiers at Fox
News. Right on cue, faithful to Reich Martial Hermann Gehring's advice to attack all the sending
views as treason, Fox accused Almond Ford of being a spokesman woman for Al Qaeda. I felt
for Almond Ford having myself insolent by the US Neal Conservative media as a friend of Saddam
for disputing what House claims about Iraq, whose secret police had threatened to hang me on my
last visit to Baghdad. The war like Mama's Boys at the Neal Khan National Review actually had the
hoots for the call me unpaid periodic columnist in my own paper pillory me for opposing the Iraq
misadventure. Now as White House lies in this dorsany are being exposed every day, these critics
aren't man enough to admit that their pirating of administration war propaganda,
Almond Ford politely calls it high level disinformation was foolish and unprofessional.
Christian Almond Ford is absolutely right. The US media was muzzle and censored so and it goes on
which you can read the entire story on NealRages.com. Right on cue, faithful to Reich Martial Hermann
Gehring's advice to attack all the sending views as treason. Got to love it. Oh yeah, love it.
You love it? Yeah, lots. Anyway, here's what's happening on our pool now. Who's your all-time
favorite dead person? This is our last dead people pool for a while until Moe dies and then we'll do
one like what would be that pull question? How delighted are you? How fast are you dancing?
