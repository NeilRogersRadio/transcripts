Why does he come in and act like he likes me or something?
I don't understand. I'm like

You won't be seeing me around the house
Now that football has resume
Absolutely
I'll be down in the wreck room
Just see who is beating whom good by my wife the kickoff
Right and I just bought a brand new case of beer
You won't see me for five whole months
I'll be downstairs getting drunk
Watching tackle sticks and puns for the joy
But fall season has begun and I won't be seeing you till the season is all through
I will miss you with all my soul
But I'll return after the superboats
I guess I'm just a football
For the next 21 weeks come upstairs just to take leaks no more life
No more sun with false season has begun when they run when they pass
I'll be cheering passing gas for the joy
Oh
I
Ten away to five sixty wQ. I'm so into a clearance who of course is a real sports nerd
Which is why he can't get any action told me this morning the key to Tom Brady success
He said he's got a hardest 12 inches in football anyway happy Thursday to you
Well, this week's yours flown by hasn't it not
For some of us so the people from critter control found a dead rat in the traps in my attic
I should have thought of that big one. Yeah, should have thought of what big ass rats
They're everywhere they have a big ass and the rest of them too. Yeah
So they really can't make that much noise. Oh, yeah
Well, I'll be damned especially when they're chewing through the ceiling
They put on the trash
I give up peanut butter. Oh, yeah, yeah. Why is that?
They put like
Extra trying out gets hard and loses its aroma peanut butter is oily
It gets hard hardest twelve inches in football
Peanut butter is oily and it smells
Like all that bacon. I yesterday ate it like a how much is a rasher of bacon do you know?
I've heard that expression so many times. I have no idea what that means but whatever that is I ate it and
Man oh man what that did to my back though. Whoo. Did I pay a wicked price for that?
I why did they do and they did it again today but being
Wising up and I wanted to go through that again
They're not dead. It's nothing but well, that's how is we love you
But they cut the crap already you know like 60 slices of bacon will be enough
That stuff is nothing but fat and grease and a pork pork
Oh, do I have a lot for that but I'm not gonna say it because I have I'm holding right here a letter from the very ultra religious right wing
John black and Ford Lauderdale
Who's been writing this crap for years to the Sun Sentinel say you know see that's what so boring about this town
It's the same old colors and the same old letter writers to the editor and the same old get skis in the same crap man
We need some new blood. How many years have I been saying that that's why Forell is doing so great
Even if he shows sucked which it doesn't but even if it did he's new he's different. He's off the wall something different
We need some variety
But some in man, but get bust loads of like real living and breathing people in here and crank the humidity down about 80%
Of course we'll have to bust some people out tonight. I of course
Including all the old Jews and old Cubans yeah, I go out to get the newspapers this morning
I'm telling you seriously it was so humid how humid was and so goddamn hot and like at seven o'clock
How and humid can it be at seven o'clock in the morning?
How hot you want it? Oh
Unbelievable how how can anybody be here?
Which they're not and now today and I don't know about you coming to work this morning
But the evidence of Labor Day weekend is upon us because it's been pretty thin the last week and a half but now
Oh anybody who was finally bailing out to enjoy long holiday weekend. They're gone and back up to three near death experiences
per day this year's that there was like nobody in fact
You know when I came to a dead man's curve there by the stadium
That's what I call it now dead man's curve I was very wrong by the stadium where there's no traffic light and you hope you can make that left turn on
The Ives deri that's the one you wiped out on is it?
No, that's the one you get on the turnpike okay or off the turnpike
No, no, this is this is where you come to the end of the road by the stadium and you have to make the left turn Ives deri
There was nobody going either way nobody
Until you got like right up to that school when people were whipping to the schools on about 80, you know
Look at this it's already 12 minutes after 10. I love that crossover with for real. Oh
Don't forget check out the erudges.com and see the new exciting mode is a beautiful thing
The hardest 12 inches in football go up those checkered pants
Well, he's an act she's here. Oh buddy wants to play a brand new roll now
You
I don't hurry now, I don't hurry
What I'd like to do is an excellent driver
I'm just like a tiger
We'll run, run, run, till the voters
And your name is away
Run, run, run, till the voters are
We'll run, run, run, till the voters
And your name is away
There's an arrow just like Rainman
There's an excellent driver
I'm glad you didn't know that
It's 10-18, that's good reason to vote for him, ain't it?
No!
No, he's a moron
How do you like the way they're
peddling around on these radio talk shows now?
Well, I do not for game marriages
But I'm for a man that a woman
And domestic partnerships
And I'm for a...
I mean, well, what is it?
I get weak, why am I starting with this now?
I don't know
I really do, I make myself weak thinking about
How goddamn stupid people are
They take some moron, who's...
Inarticular would be the understanding of the centuries
A literate, he's an asshole
He's nothing but a goon
Who represents the dumbest of everything that's dumb
He wasn't even born in his goddamn country
His father was a freaking Nazi
Yeah
And other than that, he never stole a freight train
So let's make him governor
He knows that bush
I beg your pardon?
What'd your brother have?
I'm old
At least there's some time we're there
Right
Anyway, 16,860 for abandoned perrescue
We did the 14-a-re bucks yesterday at Brandes
Thanks to our friends at Brandes, by the way
For allowing him a gallon-toy's transfer to be there
By the way, Troy Stratford told me something shocking this morning
He said that Dan Marino had the smallest penis of any player he's ever seen in his life
He said he was hung like a butterfly
And you know, Troy did play with Dan
And also was on the same...
Was on the same football team
He said he played with him a little bit
How many times?
About 30, man
He said nothing ever came of that
So anyway, Dan Marino hung like a midget according to what the great Troy Stratford
The phenomenal dolphin running back during those grotesque awful years
But I was pretty shocked that it came out with something that openly, you know
Nice going, Troy. We always liked you
So by the way, 16,860 for abandoned perrescue
And the best of meal stuff
And what happened to the sheet that he was going to give me?
I mean, he gave me the thing with the number
What happened with the thing about Joe and Mark going out at noon to two?
This Miguel, since he got married, didn't we warn him?
Oh, yeah
His ass is where his head used to be
He hasn't got a clue
He has ass upside down
Well, first of all, stopped saying new to two because I think that was why he took that sheet out of there
Well, when are they going to be?
Wherever they're going to be
It might be three to five
Oh
Like I said, he can't get his ass together
But they're going to be out somewhere with the best of meal stuff today
And we'll go over 17 grand
That's really not very bad
Not at all
Huh? Considering we're just getting started
Wait till October of Emberty's similar
It is actually some people here
It'll be great
Can I read this letter?
Well, I got to give the results of the pool even though Farrell already did it
And you notice he sees the opportunity to do that
This is a way of rubbing it in against Moe
Is all that was?
You're not fooling anybody Scott
It was a way of sticking it in Moe's back to which we say
Oh right
Yeah, nice going
But we'll read it again
You can never read it
Especially when it was such a...
I mean, I thought he did poorly on the play by play
And actually he did
We should have saved that
We had 303 votes
I remember that
And you notice
Since he was bitching yesterday about our polls
1151 on this one
That's four... That's almost 1500 votes
On a weekday when there's nobody here
So somebody must be out there if you catch my drip
Somebody must be a listener must be monitoring
Maybe John Black and Fort Lauderdale's monitoring
Yeah, he's one of those monitoring type guys
Same same ilk
He writes in the sunset letters to the editor
And I notice right to the right
And to the far right of his letter
Here's a cartoon
Editorial cartoon
It says 21st century America
And it shows a garbage truck
And in the back here's the thing with the 10 commandments on it
Is that pathetic or what?
Sad
Tragedy, and there's the zits flying out of James Woods' puts
Also the same garbage truck
Conscience class
John Black, chronic writer, and right-winger says
The only reason that so many object to the public display of the 10 commandments
Or any other Judeo-Christian objects
Has nothing to do with the law
These people do not want to have their consciences seared
Any object on this player reminds them that there's an Almighty God
With whom they must give an account someday
No, God
writes John Black and Fort Lauderdale
See that this is what you're dealing with
He says it therefore it's so
And again this Judeo-Christian
Do the Muslims believe in it you'll get
How about the Ahindus?
How about atheists?
Agnostic
Everybody else the Wikens
Buddhist
Like a Trish Tradfer with the golden boot on his head
Huh?
What?
It's a golden bootie
He's got a golden bootie that's what he said Dan Marino had
And a very tiny penis
Oh, bambooty that old
So anyway that's your giving idea one of the thing
That's what our pool is going to be based on
And this whole religious thing
Because there's a big thing on the front page of the hearledus morning
Religious battle in US's building
And they're trying to make this nutkin
In fact look at that
A centerpiece for so long
Judge Morris is spending this
Keep justice in Alabama
Excellent
He's charged with defying a court order
Good I hope they throw his stupid ass in jail
And all these nutcases can
What is Brian Cabelegan on CNN?
Keep justice Roy Moore was expected to appear here with the podium
Scheduling conflict he will not be here
Then at one o'clock, central time, there will be a filing, a refiling of lawsuits
In district court here in Montgomery
And at 10 o'clock, once again, we get the money went back in
Yeah, they just won't take no for an answer then
In other words, forget about the Constitution, we got a better document right here
We got the Bible says this and we're going to force it on you
Whether what you want it or not
As solely that a Brian would say, we're going to force it and hoist it
Crazy anarchists
Yeah, they're crazy people
This is one of the biggest problems in this country unlike just about any place else that I go to
This is supposed to be so superior in some and come to find out this country has taken gigantic steps back in the dark ages
And of course just like everything else it starts at the top
If the fish is rotten at the head, right?
Sure
If you find something rotting in the head, crap rolls down hill
Right
And that's what we got in this country starting with a religious nut up there
At least under the name of religion all over the rest of it is all like more hanky-panky and big business and big bucks
Of course that's what religion is anyways, nothing but big bucks, tax-free big bucks of course
The biggest scam in the world, okay, I'm not going to get all whipped up, yes I will
Please
You know, I thought for a few seconds about maybe today going back to the one to two not playing the comedy hosts
I thought about that for a few seconds
Thought third man
And I said, are you out of your mind or what?
Come on out because there's nobody here now
No, because it's really, I don't know, it's kind of like I feel like we're cheating
Like we're just faking our way through which we are
Absolutely
Until next week till after Labor Day, but you know, I feel like we're sure changing the audience a little bit
And you know what?
Tough crap
They're sure changing us
Yeah, they've been doing that for a long time so now pay back as a bitch
And there's nothing wrong with those comedy, but I've tried to mix it up a little bit, put some good crap in there
Old stuff
I was starting to squirm around in the chair, I shouldn't have eaten all that big
Oh, you should have stopped me yesterday, that's bad
You should have come right in here and said, are you out of your ever-fake in mind?
I ate one of the pieces
Yeah
And I ate about 50
Right
Oh, in some other words, that was the favor you would do if I ate in one maybe that one would have been the last one to rip my ass open
Oh, I can't think of the thing I did
I'm not going to be the ointment and the suppositories, the inesol, the soothing balm
Man, and just shove it all in like, oh brother, I'm serious
Last night I had a major exclamation project to try to like get all that stuff back together again
Oh, brother, there is nothing like Roy, he doesn't have a bidet, do you?
No, I do not have a bidet
Even up there, I don't have a bidet
I do have a soothing relief
Although I do have like a whirlpool thing up there
But I don't have a bidet
I highly recommend that you should probably have bidet
Days like that
When a doubt washed that thing out
So at any rate, quit eating all that bacon
I have some good news though, some sensational news for this audience about something you can eat
Not too much of, don't overdo it, don't use it as an excuse to get carried away
No, I'm serious, what the hell was that?
Is it like, oh yeah, like, like, like, like, like, oh, I'm coming to work this morning again
I can get almost to here and it's getting real dark, which is not unusual, it's this neighborhood, you know
But it's getting really dark, it looks like there's tornadoes on the way like the end of the world out there
And show enough now I can hear it out there
Thunder and lightning and crap and rain
What did I just get through, Tonya? This is not a place
This is hell
This right here, your ass is burning in hell
Believe me, maybe that's what happened to me when it wasn't the bacon after all
Boy, this is a horrendous place
Well, why don't you get out of here if you're like, okay
Okay, no argument for me
Soon
That does sound pretty ominous out there, don't I?
Yeah, it does, it sounds like it was just rattling like a nuns
Nons were bowling like in the, leaving a lot of 10 pins

There's a place you can chill I said young man if you're a $3 bill you can't rate it and then you make convert
They won't treat you like a pervert
It's fun to pray at the a-pay, it's no culture, it's fun to pray at the a-pay, it's no culture, yeah
All right then you fish up snazzy and there is no doubt, he's one of your friends said
I'm a sponsor pray at the a-pay, it's fun to pray at the a-pay, it's no culture, yeah
They too not persecute, you can worship in peace, you can marry a girl named Steve
A bitch, a culture, it's fun to stay at the a-pay, school full church, yeah
Okay
Young man, we will let you run in, young man, we sing shows who's not here
A heart is twelve, it's visit, booklaw
1033 at 560 WQM, so how he and Delray beat you, it's me and says, russia, here's the definition right from the old dictionary
Oh, an athlete
A thin slice of bacon or ham for frying or boiling or a second definition, a portion or serving of such slices
So that was more than a russia
No, but I mean in other words a russia doesn't necessarily mean a specific number, it could be like couple or it could be
About third man
A bunch like I yesterday, that was disgusting
I mean it was delicious, yeah
It was sensational, but just a little bit over the top and under the bottom
So I interrupted myself which is good because I haven't given a result from yesterday's poorly yet
It's already almost 1035, you see there's a method my man is taking this
I never even talked about the dark chocolate thing, so I said I had good news
So this is great
I wouldn't say it's great but it sure is very effective in killing time
No dark chocolate which I have to do one of those people who likes my chocolate dark
I like my people a little on the lighter side, but I like my chocolate dark
In fact, anybody darker than Malcolm, I would say hey you may be a very nice guy but see ya
You know, I like my guys much more on the lighter side, not pasty
What? Like me?
Oh, oh, no I don't ghostly
Yeah, I always ghostly
But anyway, so dark chocolate the new skin and of course you're always skeptical about this because every few months they're coming out with some skin
Tomato sauce, tomato products, good for prostate cancer, for preventing against prostate cancer
All this stuff you know
And it's always in the back of your mind you're thinking well they're trying to pedal some crap
Now the new daily other day red wine if you drink red wine it makes you live longer
And also probably bad for your roids I would think
I don't think now is the time because actually there are lots of wines that have only two or three carbs in like a glass
You don't want to get the sweet fruity wine
No you want a nice dry red wine
Try the wine?
I never drink
He and Bella could have been good in the clockwork orange too you know
I lost that cart, we lost those in the mix
I never drink fine
Which they did bring that back in the Edward
Edward is good but like I said watch half an hour of it and then go have a good time
No because it's just the same thing
Eddie, Eddie, come help me Eddie
I've got a problem over here
In fact I wonder if Bella knew a beater boy
So at any rate what was I just saying about the dark chocolate?
Yeah
So the new thing after the red wine right on the heels of that there's a story in the American medical, the urinal or whatever it is about
Dark chocolate, eating like three ounces
Of course you do realize how much like you see that those two fingers
That's it, that's three ounces
Not a lot
As with anything moderation
Dark chocolate will lower your blood pressure
And I thought yeah sure right
So luckily in Walgreens, of course they end please
All you people out there do not buy Hershey's chocolate
It's American, it's generic
It's some of the worst crap you'll ever have in a history of your life
Anybody that eats Hershey's chocolate must have real good taste
Don't kind of say that right now
It is so bland and it's also like Waxi, you know what I mean?
No I know
Waxi build up
They have different kinds but there are so many better kinds than Hershey's
No, don't you understand what I'm saying?
Don't eat Hershey's chocolate
Period, okay
No, if you're going to eat chocolate eat good chocolate
Oh I agree, don't eat crap
It's like if you're going to eat spaghetti don't eat Franco-American
I've never seen
Don't eat Franco-American out of your can
No seriously I mean how hard is it to throw some pasta in a pot and the
Schmerzler sauce on it and the same with chocolate
You go into anywhere you go into a convenience store you go into Walgreens
You go into a public anywhere you got like all kinds of chocolate now
Yeah but sometimes you're at a friend's house and that's all they have
Well it gets a new friend
If your friends only have Hershey's chocolate and offer say
Fett and walk right out and slam the door in their face
You know everybody has a part in the bowl of Hershey's kisses
Like on their coffee
Dude, everything like that
It's crap!
Why don't you get your hand out of there?
I dive into the bowl all the time
Oh Hershey's kisses that is
Whatever
It's like a bio
You're going to take this one over a bio
They're everywhere
Vanilla
Sure
The same people like vanilla ice cream or like Hershey's chocolate
This is a lot of people you know it's crap
Anyway what I was starting to say is dark chocolate
So I go to Walgreens last night thinking
Well this is a really good idea let me test it out
Because when I'm back here my blood pressure is a little bit higher than like when I'm in Toronto or anywhere
Or like an Amsterdam anywhere but here
Because first of all here I got a drive
I got to come here and put up with all the idiots here
And I got to do this you know
In this studio is opposed in the lap of luxury in my Toronto apartment
Right next to my bedroom
So my blood pressure is a little bit higher or nearly
So I thought I went in doubt I'll check this out
So I go and I'm looking through
As in any drugstore now they've got a phenomenal selection of candy
I mean every kind of candy, at least in America
And American candy is pretty weak
Canada does have much better candy and ice cream
And government
And lifestyle
And the bowling and curling and hockey
But at any rate
So and drugs
So I go down to candy aisle and look at here
First there's Hershey's and obviously a lot of people out there saw that on the news
Because they're Hershey's dark chocolate
You know how they have those big bars?
The kind that are supposed to like be for a whole family that I can eat in two minutes?
You know they're on the other side?
Oh yeah
So they have the regular ones
And they're like all stacked up the whole thing is full
And then it's Hershey's dark chocolate with the same big one
And there's only one the one I was in the front
And it will be everything behind it is empty
Well I look at that and I turn my nose up and say
Faa
To that
But I'm looking and looking and I see
Dove
Extra silky dark chocolate
And these little thin bars
We buy the bags that have the individual
But the same thing
You listen to me
Little thin bars so I get two of those which couldn't have been more than ounce max
Okay
And they are delicious
Delicious
Although listen don't
Now see they also say like with a dark chocolate if you eat the kind that's like 7.0 cocoa
Whatever it doesn't raise your blood sugar
But it also tastes like baker's chocolate
You know what that tastes like?
Oh, bitter. I like bitter sweet
But this is like bitter bitter bitter
Ooh nice there's a threshold
So don't assume that if you go and get the doves silky chocolate like I get that it's gonna like
Send your sugar up a little bit not not dramatically unless he tons of it
But the good news is that I'm sitting there and I'm taking my blood pressure like every half hour
Just just to see do my own little clinical test if this really works
And you know what it did?
It worked
And my pressure this morning was the best it's been in in days since I've been back here
139 over 82 before my pills that's not bad
Not bad at all
No
And that's thanks to my goddamn love of extra dark extra silky extra delicious chocolate
So you're gonna get chocolate get paragena get what was the kind you were talking about?
Lendor which is great that's from Switzerland or from wherever it is
Or good diva
Oh yeah
Or paragena from Italy
Get some good stuff don't be eating like Hershey's chocolate
The liquor store has all these gourmet chocolates we have
I mean even the goyum will laugh you out of town and if they catch you eating Hershey's chocolate
They win awards every year
Those are the ones that you're asked to out who does Hershey's
For what?
For their chocolate
For a scam the regular bar
Get out of here you're crazy
It tastes like wax
It tastes like wax
It tastes like it has a paraffin coating on it
Are you with the people in the McDonald's too?
Just because more people eat crap you say that
It's more of its garbage
Hershey's chocolate should be outlawed they win awards
So?
So does the Cindy Lauper
What does that mean?
wins awards
So they puffed the P Diddy win awards
1155 votes on yesterday's pool
There should be a special award for Moe for this pool what a job he did
That's two polls in the same day that he just absolutely crapped out
Wow
Why don't you listen to the Moe Howard David and Joey asked yesterday?
1155 votes this was the second pool of the day it's tremendous turnout
He's a pompous old ass 440
What's that just might have been the correct answer?
Absolutely
He's effing boring 354
I don't give a shmit about sports 219
I do listen he's great 94 which is only 8.1%
8% of this audience
Which means 92% like Ferrell said think he's a piece of crap
And his muskrat is on to tight 48 people said that
A grotesque showing two polls for the price of one on the same day for the Moe man
Boy they hate him like poison
Night like rat poison 19 before 11 at 560 W.C.
And we got Joe Rose for the mad dog a two in spider George keeps trying to make me change the schedule
It's the little dog on today too
Hey the mad dog is in New Orleans man
He's having a few green lizards and purple lizards
Purple people eaters right now with the old Moe man
Trying to forget their troubles and then of course we got the 800 hour adult in pregame show
Because we get a lot of spots in there starting at 4
Kick off at 8 the pregame shows at 4

Absolutely
It's because we can make a crap load of money in there
We're like how many spots and hour we run
About 30 man
During that pregame show because it's just filler just to run wild spots in
18 before 11 at 560 W.C.M. if you're underpaid if you're overworked under appreciated

The hardest 12 inches in football
12 minutes before 11 at 560 WQM
How do you like that?
Everybody's got 12 centimeters
In fact, look at that number one about voting a poll 12
That's the magic number if I'm you are the double is going to be one two
Got it?
Final score in a game?
Whatever game you're betting on?
12 to something?
12 to 12
Here's the new poll generally speaking
Which religious group in the US is the most fanatic?
Now I have a listing here and I may have left some out of only got five
Born again Christians have got 12 out of the first 15 votes
See the audience is clever they realize that Eric swaps the poll on there like you know in the middle of the hour
And so they like to hop on there right away which is good
Muslims too
Catholics one
Mormons don't have any orthodox Jews have none so far
Although the orthodox Jews of course are
I can't even find a word for it but nevertheless I'm talking about the real Getskis like Julie Raman that crowd right and your former accountant has got the tallus and the Tiffil and all that crap
Certainly qualified but more subtle than the other
Nests you mean like what you throw a brick through your window in Brooklyn because you're not a orthodox that's pretty subtle
No but like the
On the news right now well at least the orthodox Jews aren't killing any abortion doctors yet no yet
So it's like coalition get all that whole thing about monkey see monkey do you think I left any religion off that poll
Since this is the area of expertise I think you got the fanatical ones covered yeah born again Christians Muslims Catholics
Mormons or thought and maybe even Mormons don't belong on there although
They do run around on those bicycles trying to convert every in the northwest
Where you wield power oh and you talk right and the environments in the small
Yeah, you're right like I said that definitely believe
You're just gonna ask or in snatch he'll tell you now what about the other ones that come around with a watch tower what is that they're
They're
Witnesses but oh no that's right to go with this but they're they just
Just still run away yeah they look at their
Bad like the crazy people on the street corners
I want to say it again boys and girls listen to me very carefully
Because you see him in Toronto any big city New York Chicago any like large real city of course this is not in that we don't have a real city here
But you'll see them on street corners in the downtown areas and
They're always how is the final days are coming and get the good word and turn to Jesus before it's really and they're always crazy people
I mean they look crazy they're dressed like they just slept in a dumpster overnight that you just look at them and say oh there's a crazy person
So that bears out what I've always tried to tell you on this program is the more religious somebody is the crazier they are and
Ergo the more dangerous they are now generally the people on the street corners
They're not all that dangerous because they're out there you know they're like right in front of you and you're keeping eye on them
Right a lot of the rest of them they're like insects no cms
Right and if you don't see him you never know what the hell they're going to be doing like especially at the abortion doctors things like that at the
Applant parenthood clinic things like that
Look at that
Boy oh boy I think they hit the jackpot 35 votes born again Christians
29 George
Waslam's three Mormons one orthodox Jews got one and Catholics have one so everybody's got something
Let's see pre the reason I play that bit priest abuse case dropped out this is really tragic
And I noticed that the local media once again you people in the media are a bunch of imbosils you're crazy people you I don't care what anybody says
The reason America's in the shape it is today not because of George W. Bush not because of Dick Cheney not because of the devil Rumsfeld
Not because of Richard Pearl or any of these fascists. It's because the American media which again that's the one of the most important things in bowling for
Columbine even though we kind of glosses over when he shows the Canadians and where they get their news from and are watching the CBC
As opposed to the crap that's peddled for news and the way it's presented his news now the story and the local media here about this
Reverend Gwyshard
Alvaro Gwyshard who was reinstated over on a beach. Oh and well the charges were dropped and there was a big petitioned
Drive and people were crying and they welcomed him back. Well, let me just read you the story from today's hero that there are a Sun
Settling spirit on page 5 B
Priest abuse case dropped
Time had expired for prosecution the date County State Attorney's Office will not pursue a criminal case against the Reverend Ricardo Castellano
Say well known priest who may least four former altar boys of accused of molesting them
Prosecutors announced this week they're unable to pursue a criminal case against Castellano's because these statute
Elimitations that run out is that the same statute that they were arguing about in Alabama? I don't know
According to Florida law if a sexual assault victim is under the age of 12
There is no time limit to file charges but the victim is 12 or older as were castellano's accusers these statute
Elimitations is four years
Four years?
Regrettably the statute of limitations laws like tying a prosecutor's hands state attorney Catherine the friend as Rundle said shorts
Even if a crime was committed in all evidence corroborated you cannot under the law prosecute it's very frustrating for victims and for prosecutors
It doesn't mean a crime did or didn't occur
A reviewed team for the Archdiocese of Miami has yet to decide whether the priest was suspended in May of 2002 will be reinstated
He still faces several civil lawsuits filed by former altar boys alleging the priest molested and fondled them in the 1970s and 80s
When the Broward now here comes in a very important part when the Broward state attorney's office recently decided it could not pursue a case against the Reverend Elvara Guysard on the same grounds
The suspended priest was reinstated we shard returned to his altar in a standing ovation on Sunday he has civil lawsuits also pending
Even if Guysard has found guilty in civil court his reinstatement may stand
Civil court is civil court what our concern is what the state attorney's decision said Archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Rossa Gosta
I can't predict what will happen with the civil lawsuits have remained reinstalled as a priest and active ministry
That disappoints an attorney who filed two lawsuits on behalf of the accusers of Guysard and Castelanos
We were quite surprised because our understanding was that the statute of limitations has expired
It had nothing to do with the merits of the case said attorney Jeff Herman in other words
We don't believe the state attorney has in any way cleared father Guysard of any wrongdoing
It baffles us as to what motivated the archdiocese to reinstate him
They're right there there's what it's all about okay
All of that dog and pony show they put on the big meetings in Dallas and the pope of the old rope of the oak of it
There are all these gatherings they had in the powwow and confabs all of that crap
That's all it was was just a dog and pony show like I told you
Just to try to shut everybody up especially to Boston Globe
Shouldn't baffle anyone?
No it shouldn't baffle anybody because that's the thing deny and hide and lie just like Nixon said
You know you can always say you don't remember you don't forget and stone wall and all these things
Even the fags in New York never saw a stone wall like this
That's right
I got to read that last line again it baffles us as to what motivated the archdiocese to reinstate him
Because in other words it was just a technicality that the statute limitations read on nobody said he didn't do these things
In fact they had a whole bunch of very legitimate and credible allegations
But and this statement from this Mary Rasa Gosta bitch at the Catholic art sti
This is unbelievable
Civil court is civil court what our concern is what the state attorney's decision
So in other words if he can't be prosecuted criminally even if civilly he's found to be liable just like old shit about any of it
They don't give a crap just get off our backs already okay leave us alone
See we'd like them to get off the altar boys backs is what we'd like
And fronts and bottoms and private parts
Good God
The hardest 12 inches in football
Yeah
So there you go again there's one more reason why you ought to be abandoning all this religious bull crap
If you have even just a teeny tiny brain and a willpower to say hey
I was brainwashed as a child but that's when I was a little naive stupid little kid who wasn't old enough to understand
Now I'm an adult I have my own mind and I'm gonna say
FAT BAM
To all of that crap that's what you ought to be saying they can't
Well they should and some of us can and have someone a no says emotional cripple a lot
Yeah right the perfect because they can't face the fact that we're gonna die
Oh
Bob hold the died
No he didn't
Well he's doing us all shows in the sky
Well I hate to say it but there's gonna be a lot of dead service people up there in the sky from new to the show is for
Because we keep having our people two more killed in Iraq yesterday standing remote thanks to our religious
Fanatic president who of course is so religious that he believes in all kinds of killing and being killed in the
Bring them on bring them on you know bring them on shoot them off all of that crap
This is this is tragic what's going on in this country right now
And here I'm getting a side about it is if I'm gonna make a difference now it's not good that's entertaining
We're giving me some dark chocolate my blood pressure is going on. I'll be right back

My name is Michael and this is 4205-60
But the Lord even loves neo-rogers
I'm a man
I'm a man
I'm a man
I'm a man
My fat body is right
I'm breaking this weight my bowels are losing control
Feel like a ghost in die
You're the burners we win out my home
I got a real
I got a real
I got a bad rash from a rash or a bacon
It's 11-03 at 560 or several rashers of bacon what a hell was about 800 slices
Don't do that again to me how is it really great I like the way it's really crispy like that but you'll notice it's also like real greasy
How are you going to get around there?
Generally speaking like for example there's the Schneiders microwave bacon which I can't find here unfortunately because
Cornel's microwave bacon blows it's terrible
But in the Toronto I get like Schneiders microwave bacon and the longer you put it in it gets a little bit crisper
You put it on paper towel and microwave and you put it on the paper towel and then when you're finished cooking it you turn it over
So the paper towel absorbs as much of the grease and schmutz as possible
Sure you stop it up
Yeah it's it's sobs it up but the stuff I was eating yesterday wow it's like I had like a whole bunch of valvally
Well that's an order I had a loop job for them to individually paper towel each size
Of course it's always a good idea to get a loop job before you get deeply involved
Anyway you know the people you saw the people that were like in fact the ones that are still there in my company
They're a bunch of mug ones
I know I wrote that word down because there's no other way I can describe them
I mean there are a lot of other adjectives you could use that would be adequate but mug ones I think some set up beautifully
That's what they are they come from Kentucky and they come from places like Taylor Michigan
Which is a suburb of Detroit where all the rednecks live who have the 80 pound jar of gasoline on the TV set
And mug ones right the trailer people sure the people who watch Jerry Springer
The people that are on Jerry's exactly people that are in the audience going Jerry Jerry
Right that's the crowd the mug ones the born again a lunatic now actually these people I take that back
These people would like Jerry Springer off the ear so I take that back
No seriously these are the people would say oh that's the devil is behind that and Ozzy is born and all of that stuff
So I take that back
No I give Jerry Springer credit he has found his niche he found what he merking people wants he gives it to them and he's making money
It's the lowest covenant and on it he's the greatest business man that's I've ever seen
mug ones UCF Kenny says welcome back to this Schmidt hole not for long Kenny believe me I'll be out of here before you know I'll be you to here
And but he does say clearly your home is witnesses ought to be on there now the question again is generally speaking which religious group in the West is the most fanatic
Now when you go around door to door handed out them watch tower booklets and talking about how the world is going to end any minute now
Which when I was a little kid about a hundred years ago they were still doing the same thing and we're still all here
But they belong on there absolutely your hoax windows fanatic is I'm thinking fanatic as in malicious the word we didn't say malicious right
Oh
One we're in a hell is that we didn't say malicious no we didn't say that or even dangerous we didn't say I love that
But we said how about how much is that's him we said the most fanatic that was your own as witnesses they are committed and of course most of modaby
So there you go thanks UCF Kenny we'll get that on your Farrakis paying attention which I'm sure he has because he's really been right on top of it
You know it's really great thanks again to Albert who created that new moat thing that's on the orages.com
Would you better check out today for a few yucks it's a beautiful thing right above the kid who's pitching the tent
But it's really a wonderful now that we you know email stuff to Eric it's on there faster than you can say hard attack you know what
Well I could cover a whole lot of people
Factor than you could say spastic attack on the flow things like that
Or like when I email them all the bedtime stories in the evening and they're on there like even sometimes before they really moaning
Nice going Eric you're doing it baby we always knew we had it in the end you we just had to embarrass you into doing it
Because it's a it's a it's a work of love it's a labor of love 129 votes on this pool already
Gee I think we're making some progress here I think we're getting some of the people back who tuned Georgia I mean we're coming back
Yeah listen there's nobody here don't feel bad you beat the crap out of mo you had a big number in here in July
Of course I figured it out I was like on half of that but at any rate see August is your this is going to be interesting when comes about the 15th of September the August month comes up
If you can hold your own in August yeah don't forget I had that hold the first week of August completely off I was in Amsterdam right chasing around all kinds of good people
But at any rate also you're on the last week of August yeah
Yeah but it bounced out to try to come back here and put the pieces together after you've like dropped something on the floor it's not all that easy
I mean I'm on but like I everybody's waiting around tuning in his kneel back yet plus of course the people are like you they're all gone now because I'm back
That's not true get out of here you've got your own little core of a little swingers ass liquors heterosexual fetishists you know
Drug addict drug addicts that's right people are listening because they know that every now and then you speak in code you go out the address where you're going to be a petal in it tonight
Only talk to users not abusers I see speaking a heart attack on the floor 133 votes generally speaking which religious group in the US is the most you know what I've been on today is the fourth day
I come back to town have we had one woman call this show all week I don't think so see I've given up on at all because we have no women listen to the station
But I had a couple of factors from some ice ladies have I had one call because we're doing screenless forget about it no no seriously it's just it's amazing
I've decided we're going to talk about them not to them well that that's not very nice see another one of those heterosexuals this is once a used woman to pleasure yourself
No I used to think that's a you have no respect for women I used to have respect for women but you don't anymore then I got married
I see and that well I can understand that yeah, but you got two daughters now though that's right they have respect for one of them
The one you didn't try to stuck in the dumpster 133 votes on a poll so far I'll get to this what this is going to be great today
I don't know what it is maybe it's the fact that they found that rat in my attic of course where there's one right oh family there could be there could be mole
molelicious yeah you know what I'm saying in fact wouldn't surprise me to find one of them hair pieces lying around up in there they'll be back
what do you mean by that I've had like five different what do you mean they'll be back I'll be back you know there was more than one there was no nest or anything up there
They're not solitary creatures I see like the rats under the shed we pisoned that shed like five times already and they still keep coming back from mole
I'll be damned well I guess you're not using exactly the good kind of poison but you don't understand what they do is they like see when you have those I don't want to get into this whole thing about pest control because it's boring
but the drain pipes on the roof you know sure well they're open they're open and that's one of the ways that they get in right but what the these critical people do is they like they put like screening on them that they can't chew through or whatever
yeah right allegedly they can chew through tungsten really yeah so don't want to help I'm gonna spend that money to have them do that because otherwise they'll take over your house oh so they're like putting a screening on into all of that so and of course if there happen to be anybody still up in there what's there aren't
because as of yesterday he was the only one who was alone the lone stranger so he's dead and I was like okay but they said it was a big one a big rat and I said was he
malicious and they said yeah they said he's from the head start program on your early morning show born again Christians fanatic the most
117 out of 152 votes I don't want to I know we have some born again Christians out there in this audience I don't want you to feel bad but we don't like you and most of
America's scared crapless of you because we know you're crazy people and we know that you won't take no for an answer that's the most scary part just
like judge more in Alabama if he wants to believe whatever the hell he wants if he wants to go read the 10 commandments in Sunday school in church in
shul where would a hell he wants fine no problem that's what freedom religion is supposed to be not
voicing it not putting it in places where it's specifically prohibited by the constitution not voicing it on a
public in public pays places which are subsidized by taxpayer money very simple there's nothing
complicated about it at all it's very simple even a mugwump a moron could understand it oh he
understand you got all these people there oh and they're all and when I love about these mugwumps is they
they're not only leaning down and praying but they get they close their eyes and they get that real oh god
you know like like harder they pray and the more than the more they scrunch up their face the more god is going to listen to their
bull crap you know if you beat yourself with a chain that helps too that's really effective born again Christians 125 I told
you to try it delicious uh muslims 19 orthodox Jews 16 very good American progress I've told you
avoid they are who not for me what what I'm gonna tell you right now the orthodox Jews man wow what I think

uh that fast we had yesterday we had the right idea let's just get there a lot of there let them kill
each other and have a good time doing it caplex three Mormons to your hova's witnesses appear
and now you see how much it's going to cost us in a rack by the way oh a billion a week and no
that's just for what we're doing right now that's not just to get the electricity on and keep it on
just to get the water running again and do all of these basic things just to start creating some
phony jobs billions and billions and billions so the four hundred billion dollar deficit they
predicted for next year that small potatoes now it's going to be more like five hundred billion but
you keep forgetting something yeah that people are starving to death and people can't find a
guy named job no not that it's all worth it that's what that's right we're helping to create terror I

stolen so much from us saying i can't believe the stuff that they play in there where our
our that they play uh what uh yeah i know our stuff well see our bonuses are all intertwined with
each other so they need help oh that's obvious uncertain show is i don't want to mention not in
particular the hardest twelve inches in football generally not you know listen to that again listen

like Canada last time i checked chanada cat was not a third world country for the FDA to be
filing criminal charges and citing health concerns oh that's right all of us in Canada man we're
dying because the drugs are so dangerous what a crocker crap all the FDA is doing is hand in hand
with their buddies and the pharmaceutical companies trying to prevent them from losing any more
their profits so they can continue gouging the american public and you people out there can't get
a discount on your drugs because when you buy a zokor in the u.s. it's the same zorkor you buy in

uh the other day on your pole you took about the uh your favorite south florida first
First I got forgot he died
Glenn rinkered. Yeah, he was on there. Hey, yeah, I know I voted for the bird but Glenn rinker was up here in Orlando on Channel 6 for about three years
Yeah, yeah, he never cancer. He was he was pretty good guy Glenn rinker. He was okay. He was on Channel 10, right?
I don't know where he was on there, but he was up in Orlando on Channel 6 here for about three years
I'll be damn well, you know most people have moved to Orlando. They die
Yeah, that's true. Sooner or later
About the bird. Yes, I told you long before he was with you and
Over on the space coast want to first FM taught 40 stations. Mm-hmm out of cocoa is the BRK. Right. That's right. He was on rocket radio right he was like
Program director I guess
But
Go ahead don't go let him interrupt you. Okay. He's trying to get you from the grave
Be quiet bird. You're sure not pretty
I wish somebody out there maybe Boca Brian or somebody in the listening audience might have some tapes or something of when
He was with you. I've been listening. It's like 1990, but oh, we got a whole stack all over here long before then
Here's an idea. No, you could put those on a CD. Yeah, I put and you could
You'd buy it. No Rogers gives us the bird. You could write U.S
That's not too bad
But we'll have a committee meeting on it
Thanks, Dale. Okay, have a great day, pali
Okay, he was okay, even though you're giving me all kinds of looks Warren and Boca says I just read this on Yahoo
Amid serious strains in U.S. Saudi relations the Saudi ambassador Washington former president George Bush that senior
On Wednesday will meet Vice President Dick Cheney today
President Bondar bin Sultan had lunch with Bush father and close confidant of the current president and Kenna Monkport main where the family is had
Long day other time vacation home. Yoddy yoddy yoddy. Well, of course they're in business together, you know
Like Genko and the Don Corleone they're in bed together any olive oil business together. They're in bed exactly
Oh, and I'm so glad he mentioned something about the most wanted deck of cards of the war profiteers cards
Yeah, that's got the Bush and Cheney and them but I'm glad Warren mentioned it because I wrote that down
This is one of the things that happens, you know, it's a it's like a chicken in the egg question
I mean where the American people really that stupid to begin with or
Does the current group of lunatics that we have in here? Are they like making them? Are they dumbing down?
Which I think both oh both of you both. I mean, we're dumb to begin with but now it's dumber than dirt
For example, you notice everything now and of course again thanks to the media
We couldn't have all of these things spreading like wildfire like wildfires in Kelona, British Columbia
Unless we had of course the media to propagate this bull crap
I wrote down for them the actions of evil the evil doers
Deck of cards and the road map to peace
Everything is a cliche. Uh-huh. The deck of cards. I mean, it's like we're talking about some kind of a freaking parlor game or something here
Oh, we just caught the Ace of Spades and we just caused the Ten of Diamonds uh, I mean
It's like you're talking to a bunch of three-year-olds in a sandbox
Yeah
And of course when you look at the president with a deer in the headlights look and they ran the wrinkled furrowed brow and a look of confusion and contusion on his
Post you realize this is the level he can operate on he's a moron and that's a couple that's an insult to legitimate morons from coast to coast
He's an imbasue
And a very dangerous one he's got his finger on a button. He's spending billions and billions and billions
Oh, it was a great article, but I couldn't email it to Eric damn it. Where the hell did I find it?
Maybe it was on Buzzflash about the a pinak people and about this is their whole concept of what they're doing, you know
Oh taking all the money away from social programs and funneling it all to the wealthy and the big corporations
For example this thing about the air pollution
Forget about yeah, of course we realize there's no such thing as global warming
Which is what we just finished with 150 degrees in all over Europe liberal conspiracy right there's no such thing as a global warming
There's no such thing as a pollution in the uh
Road erosion in the ozone layer of course not so let's just let all a big business
They'll they'll regulate themselves. That's a way to do it. Sure. They're nice people
Right
Just like our good friends at the EPA who said ah listen no problem there in New York that thing at the twin towers was a very unfortunate thing
But the air is fit to breathe everybody's healthy and like that, you know
They're gagging on it
Have to be hast of course of these liars that we have in Washington. I'm gonna say it again
I don't there's nothing I can do I can't make any changes
I've just telling you the god damn truth if this was a country of people with an intellect larger than their god damn penis
You know I'm talking about the hardest 12 inches in football
Then there there'd be impeachment proceedings going on right now people would be foaming at the mouth
There are kids your kids. They're over there dying every day based on a pack of lies
based on a pack of total lies
Oh, but Elkider was connected with something now they actually hated each other like poison
Another coming out the news and there's that enriched uranium. Oh, yeah, and now they're trying to say well
They found traces of uranium. Yeah, right
You see the news reports now where our own generals are saying oh, we're making strange bedfellows of all of the people over there
Now the alkida
Of fragments are joining up with the what's left of the bath party right and they're forming a coalition where they weren't
Right, that's what I'm saying. That's why I keep saying that we're creating terrorism that were the threat didn't exist before
Iraq was of absolutely no threat to this country not a little bit of a threat
Not maybe someday a threat zero none and you in none of the above
No, it's all over baby for all your sweet kids
Oh
There won't be no dance
I
Unless you will is it take the chance I wouldn't try it. I think I'll pass still dance
Don't dance
Don't do the master tater or what you see too or I thought you're as gross as gonna bust you don't dance
Don't
We don't allow dancing here you will see
Maybe
I
Do
New love law.
The reason of Patriots are when the Super Bowl again is here for the second time in
three years is because Tom Brady's got the hardest 12 inches in football.
Come on, it's Tildoo and by the way, this thing in California, and I don't want to sound
conspiratorial, but this is just part of the same power grab.
It's kind of like what Tom DeLay is trying to do in Texas with a redistricting and create
all these districts with the who sort of Republicans can increase their majority in the house.
And just like the way they stole a presidential election in Florida.
And now by having some right wing nutcase with a lot of money, I initiate this recall
thing against Great Davidson California.
I mean, what more would they just love?
Just love to take over to the largest state in the country.
A power grab.
So you see in this country, they can't do it quite as obviously quite as overtly as
has been done in some other countries.
So they do it covertly.
Yeah, so that we can have right wing rule for the next 100 to 100 years.
It's called a dictatorship is what it's called underline the dick part.
So anyway, I was right for once in my life.
Cadbury Schweppes in Bourneville, Birmingham, England, West Midlands, UK.
Cadbury's as we know it today started from humble beginnings in Bull Street Birmingham,
not Birmingham, Alabama, not even Birmingham, Michigan, Birmingham, UK.
A shop was opened by John Cadbury in 1824.
It didn't start as a conventionary shop.
It sold tea and coffee and homemade drinking chocolate or cocoa, which you made for
customer and for customers.
And that goes on about the whole pay.
Thank you very much for sending the 800 pages of history of John Cadbury and his
sons and the whole family.
So I was just, Brit tonight.
Yeah, he did.
American chocolate.
I mean, I'm not not going to American companies make some good food products.
I can't think of any at the moment.
Like Ben and Jerry's, for example, make great ice cream.
They're out from Vermont.
There's American as it gets.
Good guys.
Good little jugubo boys.
But chocolate, forget about.
Do not be no more Hershey's or go to America.
Nestle's I know they're like all over the place.
I think Nestle's UK, I believe is like I'm think where they started.
I'm not really sure.
Somebody have to look up the histories of Nestle's.
Nestle's is nothing to write home about either although.
Nestle's does make smarties.
Nestle's makes smarties.
Yeah, but that's like which if you want to go to the parties, you go to Canada.
If you want to crappy ones, you buy them in Europe.
It's interesting.
You can get the same product in different parts of the world and it's not the same.
Now one thing I'll say for McDonald's and I can't say much.
But one thing I will say is they're continuing to poison the world.
Macdeff.
No, is that no matter where you go, it is exactly.
And I'm not saying they sell all the same products because like in Italy,
they have some pretty interesting desserts and they have to do something to lure people
because anybody who eats McDonald's in Italy has got to be a moron.
You know, it's all a great try to read as they got there.
Or an asshole tourist.
Oh, there's a big bear.
The bills get a big Mac.
Uh-huh.
Before we go get our spaghetti with meatballs.
But anyway, if you order a big Mac or you order like a McDonald's cheeseburger in Amsterdam
or in Berlin or in Westland or in whether it's Westland, Weston,
it's the same.
Same crap.
Same greasy crap.
By the way, Bacon's bad for your ass.
What?
You're supposed to eat it.
No.
Oh, I think it's supposed to smear it.
Clarence said he always smears a little pork.
Well, anyway, getting back to a whole bunch of faxes here now.
What's wrong with a little pork on your butt?
Isn't that what they call it the butt end?
Michelle says I'd like to suggest for the list.
Seventh day Adventists.
This is a small potatoes.
A small potato.
I've known she says I'm a former SDA.
Continue that they're very close to reading to the Orthodox using the whole fanatic
Schmidt as a child.
There was a whole list of things I couldn't do.
That's why I just played that no dancing, Michelle.
Like I couldn't go to the theater, no TV cut my hair, no dancing, drinking, no music.
I don't even pre-approved Christian music.
Christian music.
You know, that's depends on which family you're in.
How about Christian rock?
Even shaving was an issue.
You shouldn't shave your legs above your knees because only prostitutes do that.
Well, that's true.
And you'll castello.
So you can imagine underarm shaving was a major sin.
I could go on.
She says, but I'd bore you death to the crazy stories.
Maybe not, Michelle.
It says if you haven't checked out Nick Mama LaChi show, you can go to mtv.com on air.
Newly wedged Nick and Jessica.
They have episode previews you can watch in the last episode that bitch Jessica threatened
to shoot off Nick's subpoenas if you were to cheat on her.
I can't stand that girl.
I'd rather Nick be gay than I've ended up with that stupid bitch.
I'll go along with that, Michelle.
I love him dearly.
He's I know he's got that strange.
What does there he's hot?
You know, some people don't have the best face, but there's something about them.
You know, I can't put my finger on it.
Anyway, Michelle says, somebody else, I'll strike up the nerve to call you.
I always enjoy your show.
Thanks, Michelle.
You're the best we'd are.
I would break her arm, though.
As much as I like Michelle, I break her arm before I let her touch her.
No, I'm got first dibs.
Let's see.
Do you remember Saunders chocolate from Detroit?
If you want, I'll send you some.
See, here we go.
Can you believe this?
Can you believe this killing us hardly?
With our food, all these food pushers.
Someone sent boxes of candy, you know?
I'm glad you didn't show it to me.
I don't want it.
Past tense.
I don't want it.
I don't want to know about it.
I don't want to hear.
Did you see it?
Just like that bitch that used to bring me to the smarties of the hockey games at the
macarena here.
I don't want to I got my parking passes.
Thanks to my friends at the Panthers.
It came separate.
It came like a day later, either like UPS or whatever.
So I want to be ripping them for that.
So now I got my season tickets, my parking passes, my season tickets, my
schedule.
Now all we need is a team.
Oh, yeah, that would be good.
Greedy.
All we need are some like real players and a remote chance to make the playoffs.
What do you say?
No.
No chance.
No, Mo.
It's kind of sad.
And they don't even have like the big danger that Mr. Big whatever's name is.
Number eight.
So Saunders, I remember Saunders the name, but I don't think I ever had no.
Oh, see if we're going to get into this thing about chocolates.
I think back what I said about the American chocolates.
Ethel Amos.
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, in Vegas.
Did you ever go to the FLM shop in the start-up house?
No, no.
Oh, that's where they had one there too, didn't they?
They had them.
Oh, in the start-ups they have an Ethel Amos chocolate.
They have the stuff, the crunchy, like it's like almond brittle.
Oh, I don't get me started on that.
Rodgers almond brittle from Canada.
I didn't have some of that a couple of weeks ago.
I shouldn't be doing that.
Now, didn't you say that somebody sent you some or you got some the almond brittle by Rodgers?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Well, first of all, that should be illegal.
Around the sweet brittle, the nutty brittle.
And they blend in your mouth there.
What's about Ethel Amos though?
It's very, very expensive thank goodness.
But I can afford it.
And it was like orgasmic.
That was how biting my finger was.
Yeah, I didn't get real nervous thinking about this.
Like, five.
Oh, five, that's nothing.
I could probably...
I could have polished him off, but I resisted him.
Oh, Rodgers almond brittle.
Go online.
Rodgers, what is it?
RodgersTalklet.com.
See how you're doing.
Comin' to search.
They'll find it.
Let's see.
Lou says, check this out.
It's all absolutely true.
Here's a bunch of...
A whole bunch of pages from the...
Oh, Lou, why did you do this?
Lou, pages and pages.
Silly stuff about El President.
They're like, ah, Lou, what are you doing?
Lou!
Can't stand it!
Can't stand people that do that!
Oh, by the way, when you call Miguel about your CDs and cassettes and key chains and stuff,
leave your name and a phone number would be good.
If you just call Miguel and say, hi, sweetie, I'd like some crap.
You know, I might give you some crap, but you got it.
Even to get to crap, you got to leave a name and phone number.
Idiots.
Oh, boy.
Do we have to slow people out there?
What?
Even Troy was saying this morning because Troy went with Miguel to Brandy's yesterday on that van hit.
He said, oh, he said, are there some real interesting people in your audience?
Yeah.
See the good people?
They don't show up.
They're afraid, you know.
That is.
Seriously.
Well, look at the couples contest.
We had some damn interesting people on there.
Sure.
And then we also had some.
Anyway.
Other kind of, there's all kinds of interesting.
There's all kinds of interesting.
Anyway, if you want to call Miguel, 305-650-566, he is in right now as a matter of fact.
He is in, if you want.
Right after lunch, so he's going to have to serve us durin again and then in the two to three hours screw in.
So you might want to call him a real pronto.
305-650-566.
It's 1157-560.
I still haven't given the whole line of parole as sports today.
Clarence will be really pissed off.
We got the Adolfins at the Saints with 50 hours of pre-game starting at four.
Countdown to kickoff.
With lots and lots of spots.
The game don't start till eight kickoff.
But we got hours and hours of crap of analization.
Talking about Jay Feedler, who's pretty marginal at best.
And we also have the Heracones at Louisiana Tech.
Louisiana Tech!
That's going to be like 85-2Zip.
Playing a girl's school just like the Adolfins are for the opener, the Texans.
Hercane game starts at 430-Live from the Sandbar grill in the grove.
Coverage on Power 96 on FM with like a real signal.
And then we got the Marlins at the Pirates.
We got games up the old ass today on this station.
The Marlins at the Pirates who've lost 100 in a row.
Marlins on Drek at 631-5705.
That'll be on Waxi 790-AM.
So we got sports ass stuff coming all over the place.
Just oozing out of your radio.
You know, when you got up this morning, I took a deep breath.
What were your breathing, speaking of stuff, oozing all over the place?
If you're tired of the schmutz, the mold's for it.
Dust particles and all the other crap in your air.
You have a mold problem called 1-866-542-4995.
That's the number for a clean air restoration.
I met these guys. They know how to get your air clean.
If you have a respiratory problem, allergies call 1-866-542-4995 right now.
You've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on your home,
but nothing to ensure that the area of breathing is clean.
The air filter system on your air conditioning system is there to protect the AC coils.
It's not intended to filter the air that you're breathing.
Their HEPA-FILTERed air handling system removes almost all airborne particulate,

This is sports radio feisty.
You weigh out.
Oh, it beat it 12-1 hour on WQM.
You call that a penis?
Yes.
I want to give you a kiss.
Okay.
Start lighting the candles.
Absolutely.
There's no power today.
And we are getting tired of it.
New York, New York.
These electrical grids are way out of date.
Get someone to rewire it.
New York, New York.
I don't want to wake up in a city with no AC.
And find my food as old spoiled.
Can't watch TV.
Are these big blackout blues?
Ain't going away until they fix what's wrong with it.
In old New York.
It's a practice.
It can happen here.
It can happen.
Anywhere.
What will they do?
New York.
New York.
Jesus Christ.
From before already at 560 WQM.
This is just flying by today.
Thank the Lord for that.
It's pouring.
It's brutal out there.
I send my condolences to those of you who've got to be here like the rest of the summer and for maybe a long time after that.
This is hell.
You're in it.
Okay.
Magnum is thick about it.
This is hell.
Joe and Mark won't be in hell, although maybe someday we'd add Cho that they're doing.
Three to five this afternoon.
They will be at the singular wireless at 20335.
That's biscaded 20335.
Biscayne at 20335.
Biscayne Boulevard in Aventura.
And they'll have all of our good stuff.
They'll have the best in the LCDs.
2002-2003.
And of course the Mohawar-Davidid keychain.
And a limited supply of the 2001 CDs and the Jemandid Jemandidog keychains.
All the benefits, all the proceeds to benefit at a bad-and-pat rescue.
You can read all about a bad-and-pat rescue on our website.
And when you go to our website, neo-rangers.com, to vote on a poll or whatever else you want to do to around on it.
Be sure to take a look at the new Mohawar-Davidid flipping wig pictures, which are positively-
Now it's interesting, here's the facts, which you're nearly-
I had already thrown it in the Schmidt camp, but then I started thinking about it.
Now where is Farell going to be broadcasting from tomorrow?
Bahamas?
Yaman!
Right.
Uh, all I had to do was drink last night.
I really don't know what the number was.
I thought I heard him say,
BOT 3D MAN!
He said, of course, it was all, he gets juice for everything, gets everything for free.
And more power to him, I love Farell.
You know what I'm saying?
But listen to this facts from Kenny and Mimey Springs,
who's obviously got a serious asshole problem.
Dear Neil.
After listening to the WQM for many years,
now I finally come to the conclusion that the overwhelming number of Jews who work,
there is led to a culture of freeloading and mooching.
The addition of Farell has taken it to a new level.
Never before in the history of talk radio has been such a feeding frenzy of freeloaders and moochers calling in for free game tickets.
It's interesting because the people who call in don't work here.
And many of them are goyem.
And schwarzuz, and whatever they are.
It's what is even more amazing are some of the people who call in on a regular basis freeloading and mooching.
People who blatantly advertise that they're business owners, for example, and it mentions the someplace,
who obviously have enough coin to buy their own tickets.
But they would rather freeload and mooch from Farell, so they can feel like they are somebody,
namely, I socialize with Farell.
When I want to go to a game, I'll buy my tickets and take chances on who I'm going to sit near.
I don't want to know ahead of time that I'll be sitting with a cream of the crap professional Jews pick,
another assorted radio hole freeloaders.
Funny how it took a Gentile-slash goi to blow the roof off the place and expose it for what it really is.
So in other words, as much as we like Farell, it took Scott, given away a bunch of crap,
to expose what we've been talking about for 25 years that this is a bunch of freeloaders in his town,
who want something for nothing and an early bird.
Yeah.
In addition to which, since he is the Gentile goi, the token one that we got on the year,
isn't that plus the mad dog?
Isn't that a May Angel Rose? Isn't it, and the who wrote?
He wrote the big O.
Isn't it interesting, though, that he's perhaps can be a put us to shame?
Oh, yeah.
When it comes to freeload, and I'm not going to put that, don't get me wrong Kenny and Miami Springs,
you're not going to start anything between me and Scott, because we're pretty tight, okay?
But, I mean, I mean, he goes with the territory asshole,
it goes with being in this business, is being a freeloader, and we like it,
and you're just jealous, you're just a jealous little punk.
That's what it boils down to, sure.
And I hope you do buy your own tickets and sit far away from all of us.
Even George don't want to sit near we at the game.
348 votes on a poll, not too shabby, generally speaking,
which religious group of the US is the most fanatic as in,
BAAA, dangerous.
I'm going to save you, what you want to be saved or not.
Born again, Christians, 246 over 70%.
We are mortified, and of course, and this really comes to the forefront
with this whole Montgomery Alabama, with a banjo on our knee thing,
with all these mugwumps, with this tent commandments.
Well, the law says, we don't care what the law says, the law of God,
the Lord did this, and if we can't bless God, who's going to bless us?
And if God can't bless America, be out of your body.
Muslim 38, Orthodox Jews 30, look out for them.
Orthodox those far-bistened as they say in China.
Do you hope his witness is 24?
Catholic 6, Mormons 4.
Now, Charles in 4, Lauderdale Beach says,
I haven't taken hardly any calls today, but we're getting a lot of good taxes,
so you know. Right?
Right. And maybe there's a lady on one of these lines, but it's probably retired.
Here's line 6, hello.
Q-A-M.
Socialist Facts.
Yes, see, there you go.
How did I know?
It wasn't him, it was the other idiot.
No, whisperer.
No, whisperer. Socialist Facts.
Yeah, that's me.
That's my name, don't worry about asshole.
Here's Charles in 4, Lauderdale Beach, who says,
hey, Neil, great pool, but the audience today really is clueless with this pool.
I think there was a period should have been earlier in that sentence.
It says, I went to school in Utah and the Mormons are the correct answer.
It is the Mormons who are the most fanatic religious group.
This isn't even a contest here, it says.
It's Charles. Yeah.
I think even Mo, whose approval ratings are at a staggering 8%,
would agree that the Mormons are the correct answer.
Like I said earlier, when they move,
do they move, would agree with that?
Absolutely.
Why?
Where they wield power, they can be quite an item.
They're over at power?
But it must be pretty upset about all that music they're playing,
all that jungle music.
Actually, you're okay with that.
With what?
Music.
Well, that's something.
There are a lot to have dances that you can have rock and roll and dance in the room.
Right.
But only if Donnie and Marie are singing.
It says,
PS Thank Christ for so-and-so,
a little Boeanor Boy being fired,
and the Beast is a total aspect.
Excellent analization there from Chuck and Four Lauderdale.
He was inside.
The Mormons are the correct answer,
even though they're lagging badly.
Well, down here they don't make too much of a wave, you know?
If you're in that area, if you're in Utah,
you practically can't get a job of it.
They're right out there by me.
They're right out there by me, the later days,
they don't control the whole area.
No, but I'm saying there,
I just mentioned that in Passingham,
I'm not saying they control nothing.
They're one of a hundred churches on that one street there.
They do make a lot of money.
We've got God row out there by me.
Is that it?
They did those surveys.
Is that it?
What is it?
It's a hiatus.
I think it's time to take a hiatus from all this religious crap,
if you ask me.
They take a hiatus from a kid of brain, okay?
Start thinking.
Oh, well dogs don't go to heaven,
and cockroaches don't go to heaven,
and that dead rat that they attract in your attic,
then they go to heaven,
but man goes to heaven.
Right!
Who wrote it?
Man wrote it.
Now in the doggy Bible, it says,
only dogs go to heaven.
So tiny and windier up there having a good time up there,
probably,
crap it all over the clouds.
Yeah, especially tiny,
sneaking one here and there.
That's that sound we keep hearing.
Yeah, he's dropping a few tiny tots here and there.
And in the meantime,
the rest of us, wow,
we're just going straight into box.
I mean, it's so sad.
Just like Madeline O'Hare,
Rest in Pieces used to say,
religion without a hell isn't worth a damn.
That was one of my favorite lines she had so many,
but that's one of the best.
Religion without a hell isn't worth a damn.
Oh, and Bob hope he's up in heaven now.
He's in a good place now.
And a box in a ground rotting
and a worms are eating his body.
That sounds like a real good place to meet, not.
Not.
And it sure took them a long time
to get around to this whole tribute.
I mean, how many days ago did he die?
About 30 minutes.
He's been dead for like a month.
And now they're trying to resurrect this whole crap again.
Oh, and in fact,
and they just have the funeral?
Yeah.
Well, what kind of religion was he involved in?
They don't bury me until you're absolutely sure religion?
Yeah, and keep checking.
Maybe I'm still, I mean,
how could you really tell, you know,
if you had a pulse spoken with us?
So I'm trying to find a pulse in South Florida.
How can you really be sure?
Well, I'm sure.
The rate none.
Well, I'm really rolling today.
I have no idea why.
Well, it's because I'm so anxious to be getting out of here very soon.
12 minutes past noon at 5.60 W.M.

You can test drive any vehicle on a lot for 24 hours.
You can take it home, take it to work, take it up the old Hershey highway,
take it up the...
Unless you would say...
As Thurance would say, take it up the...
And of course Haled's also got a great selection of certified vehicle cars, trucks and SUVs.
That's right, if you work at QYM, there's an asterisk.
There's an exception here.
Speaking of taking up the old...
And if you have credit...
You should see who was at the door, who just opened the door, speaking of...
Correct them.
Anyway, and if your credit is pretty marginal, speaking of working at QYM, they'll still manage to go to the deal with Haled, plenty of XEMC.
That was good timing, my psychic powers once again.
134 or 131 South Dixie Highway, that's US-1 across from the falls open every day, seven days a week.
For more info call on the Neal Deal, hotline toll free, one purple date when you come down?
God, I gotta get out of here!
So I don't see you with this high-end act you're putting on.
That would've been so...
I know, amazing.
Called the Neal Deal hotline toll free at 1-885-34-42-11.
I'd like to finish this poppy 4-2, 1-885-34-42-11.
Of course, all Neal Deal, something to credit, provost your friends and now, at least they used to be our friends, 40-tails.
Haled Potty XEMC, they are professional grade.
Ride in local, here's sports video 560, you a-a-m.
And I have your attention, please.
And I have your attention, please.
Will the real-grant-grady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real-grant-grady please stand up?
We're gonna have a fun here.
You're lacking like you've never seen a white dwarf before.
Who is on the same floor with a three-sister separated by a latham dwarf?
And a bathroom with tile floor and so born at the store.
Sleeping a bump in, sitting a bump in, and too much to be stung in the herd.
Oh, great, you didn't just say that, the end-ware ain't enough.
Of course I did.
You idiot, you're just a kid.
Little Peter the Rage can't hit the high note to the song I changed.
Great-grady, y'all sick of me.
You all stupid new, would you rather have the poachage family?
Danny with his red hair, any cute?
Here's a little secret, the kid that plays guitar, it's new.
I also like to take keep-blood and assert my boo.
Sometimes I wanna jump, Marsha, and just go, but I can't, but she's my sis when I'm a girl.
So what, this family is sick, this family is sick.
No kidding, they are people with the slum, they admit.
My dad designs a house with three adults and six kids.
But only one bathroom for all of us to play.
And for Alice only has a bunch of room in which I live in.
Right next to the kitchen, but I guess I'm only bitching,
because my dad was been an ancient little Cindy with a lip.
Making my eyes stop shaking and twinging.
Why can't you just stop saying Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, like a vixen?
And Bobby gets to the dentist, so we think he could be fixed.
I'm about to fall for my heart and his Marsha knows.
I'm so mad, I'm let it go, I got the problem.
Starting great-grady is on the real radio, so the other breed is adjustable.
On to ladies, so what, the real great-grady please stand up.
Please stand up, please stand up.
Yes, I'm great-grady, yes, I'm the real ready,
so the other breed is adjustable.
On to ladies, so what, the real great-grady please stand up.
Please stand up, please stand up.
Oh yeah, mom says he's no plain boy and they hit the house.
Marcha, you look fine.
From 18 at 560 to over to 2M375 votes on a poll generally speaking, which religious group
in the US has is the most fanatic.
Born again Christians 267, 71.2% let's hear it for the born again.
Muslim is 38, Orthodox Jews 32.
To hope his witness is 28, Catholics only 7.
They've kind of calmed down since the Godfather came out and the Mormons only 4 out of 377.
Mormons here very much in the background.
We keep them in their place.
Here's the facts, angry facts from Ray and Helen Dale and proud of it.
If you were in Helen Dale, would you be proud of it?
No, you'd be embarrassed.
It says the Neil Rogers show has degraded into one old man, be raiding and hassling another old man.
Maybe it's time for Neil to retire.
The material must be pretty scarce when all we hear are mo bits all day long.
Have we played one mo bit today?
That's what I recall.
No, maybe some drop-ins.
You know, with drop-ins?
Which evidently, Ray does no difference between a drop-in.
What do you think Ray's problem is?
He's stupid.
Plus, he's in Helen Dale.
You know what I'm saying?
He's stupid.
Okay, Mo, just calm down.
Get with it, Ray.
And by the way, Coxelhoist in Helen Dale and go find a radio show you might enjoy.
Okay, because this ain't the one.
This ain't the one for people over the age of 100.
And give us Sunny Rosenberg a big kiss when you wake up tomorrow morning.
Here's the facts from Jay, who says,
just got back into town. I'm glad you are back too.
Oh, not for long, Jay.
Take a quick look.
So as I was listing and wondering, where is Bener Boyd?
Then you mentioned briefly while reading the letter that he was fired.
He was fired.
Absolutely correct.
What happened?
Can you share or was it a private thing? Love you, says Jay.
Well, I don't want to say it's a private thing because it's not so private since you already blurted it all over the air.
But I don't want to like rehash the whole thing because that would be throwing them out of the bus.
Now, they did something to think about.
Because he's really not all that big.
It would be hard to throw them out of the bus.
We need to throw them. He'll wind up there.
Well, it would have busked like a flat tire or something.
It would have just been in front of it.
Oh, well, he had a difficulty. He had the issues.
And then a good way to put it. He had issues.
And he had a difficult time like staying in the upright position in his chair in the other room.
He had a difficult time.
Or a time showing up on time or sometimes showing up at all.
He had problems, okay, without rehashing the whole thing.
And then he would be piling on.
You know what I'm saying?
I think the biggest problem is stupid.
Right.
Any responsible all of these things.
So he's just small potatoes. He's gone.
In addition to which, well, I don't want to, I don't want to, you know, embellish it.
Now it's seriously because the thing we were saying off the air about the website,
Eric is doing just fine.
And most of the creative stuff on there comes in from our listeners anyway like,
what was the guy's name?
Arnold Albert.
Arnold and Albert.
And Jonesy.
And Jonesy and all these guys, which we thank them again, they're great.
Let's see.
DA says, in the facts, hey, Neil, you're right.
It sucks being one of those stuck here this time of the year.
Oh, I still can't vote or do stuff with this computer as I told you.
Oh, this is that guy again.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's that Dennis guy.
Don't you remember from yesterday?
Why is everybody named Dennis?
So there should be some tech support, Dennis.
Yeah, get some tech support and quit bugging us to fix your computer, okay?
Get you some.
And then not only that, get some mental support too.
See, when I got his first facts, I thought, oh, okay, well.
And then when he called, ah, that opened up a whole new perspective for us.
People who want to make their problems, your price.
There's nothing I can do for you.
And just like that guy said before about a bunch of free loaders, I think he had a good point,
now that I reflect on it.
Go find a computer tech guy who can like straightening out and get you set up right.
That's all.
Spend a couple of bucks.
If this show is that valuable to you, the price is right down close to your dime, listen.
So at least get set up right in the first place.
Dennis, don't be such a cheap ass like Kenny said or whatever the guy's name was.
Now it says, I'm a subject of religious fanatics.
Did you get a chance to see frailty yet?
Yes, I did.
I think it'll be on cinemas this week or you can buy, ah, can get it at circuit city or best buy.
I already seen it in Toronto.
Got the video up there at the DVD.
It was, ah, okay.
Mm-hmm.
When you made it to Macy with the glasses that made him look Jewish.
What are you looking like that?
You don't even remember what movie this is.
Remember frailty.
With Matthew McConaughey?
Are we thinking of the same movie?
No.
Maybe that's not the right movie then.
What is frailty?
What is that about?
Frailty had Matthew McConaughey and Bill Hax.
Quit just saying the same name over and over again.
What was it about?
It was about two brothers whose father was a religious fanatic killer.
He killed people with a pipe.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, it was kind of lame. Now he's very good when it makes me good but I'll say it again. He was much better in Magnolia and I don't care what anybody says, including you or anybody else, Magnolia is a motion picture that is so brilliantly made. The acting is so spectacular. I can't even fire words to describe it. This is not for debate with me. OK? Just tell me my opinion. OK? That's like arguing with me about like Nestle's Turtle ice cream. If you don't like it, great. OK? Eat all the vanilla bean speck you want, OK?
I'm just on you don't plan to argue
Magnolia's spectacular okay
Tom Cruise sir
What's his name that died Jason robots Jason robots
You know somebody in and keep Julian more. That's a conspiracy. Oh
phenomenal William H. Macy they got to play the cop. What is his name? Oh?
I don't know he's in everything. No, you know his name. I know what his name is and I can't think of it boy
The old man is slipping and the other guy to play the the the the TV host right?
Don't know who he is either he reminds me how are David though?
He did remind me a little of how are David it? Okay, so now you need to and then when that frog came down
With William H. Macy fargo somebody I people have said fargo's not all that great. It's like low key, but it's good
Does that make any sense?
Like all the scene in the bar with William H. Macy and I realized it's a fact thing
But nevertheless the scene in the bar with him
And the guy from laughing which I can never think of his name anymore already Johnson not already John
No, you know what I'm talking about that thing is so incredible
That's hysterical and he looks at the bartender that he's got the hots for and he's like
He sees the bartender got braces on which it was kind of silly and then he's like he runs his hand over his teeth
And he's thinking to himself, you know
Which now of course he's really motivated to give himself the braces because if he just he can brace himself for a real
Squirt score exciting experience, you know as in right-em cowboy
But it just didn't work out by the end of that movie he needed more than braces. He needs a lot of dinner to work
He needed he needed a lot of bridge work

Gildy walking around a hall and for all and where it's like party time all the time now
When he's my work environment that comes to mind right
Hostel work environment, which is even much worse than that sexual harassment crap

The 2070-year-old pastor charged with rape and other sex crimes against girls in his congregation is testifying today in Gaston County
Superior Court
Prosecutor Tom Taylor said he was surprised that it was announced in court that Cory Dean Moses
Would testify in his own defense. How do you like that? They got Moses on the stand
Moses of the it's got an address in Charlotte
It charged with one kind of rape two counts of statutes to risk sex offense for counts of taking indecent liberties with minors
His trial began on Tuesday

Sergeant a s-money with the Gaston County police testified yesterday that Moses told her in December 2002
He might have rubbed his genitals against one of the girls several times in the church, but he never had sex with her
He was just wiping them off
Huh? I love I got to read that again. He said he might have rubbed his genitals against one of the girls several times at the church
He never had sex with her
She said Moses also told her that while teaching the other girl how to drive his infinity she sat partially on his lap
She added that Moses said he touched the girl with his genitals in the car in his house another time
But denied ever having sex with her he just touched her lightly with his genitals. He just like you know
By the way, I got a question for this audience is there any black male in America who is not now or at least in some time in his life
Never been a minister pastor something
Right
Right, I don't think so
Seriously, how many black men in America have never been some a man of the cloth
And they're all in the NBA
Is there a nail order place you can get your whatever it is that they get to be a minister a reverend? Yeah
Oh, that's right. We had it on this site. Of course there always has been anybody can be a reverend like Jesse Jackson for example
The Reverend Moses Calhoun, you know, everybody is a reverend a minister

Well, why don't you just say that?
I have before I'm gonna try to like do this macho thing. Well, oh look at this suit alleged is episcopal dices ignore an abuse
This just these isolated incidents just keep pouring in here
Ha
Too many of suit the episcopal icies of North Carolina Northern California allegedly were sexually abused by a
Marisville priest in the 1970s and that the church failed to be spawned when the abuse was reported
In their lawsuit James sharp and Robert Given say they were abused by the Reverend Donald J West
While they were teenage parishioners that changed John's episcopal church in Marisville
They are seeking unspecified damages in the suit file this week in Sacramento Superior Court
Sharp who lives in Uba city says he was 15 years old when the sex abuse began about 1972
Givens a Minnesota resident said he was 17 when abused in 78 the two didn't know each other then
In 1978 according to the suit suits Paris brought them out at a bishop john Thompson who did not report the allegations to police
West was passed to a manual episcopal church in grass valley in 83 and saying andrews a episcopal church in cornhole
according in 1989
In 1995 the Northern California dices now under bishop Jerry a lamb he's on the lamb held a tribe unit
And West was removed from the priesthood in February 1996 according to very bias knew the bishops assistant West died in
1996
Bias knew said that I see now has a zero tolerance policy towards sex abuse by its priest
Well, that's good. That's your benefit of the capital church is well
We're gonna try to clamp down, but you do get a couple of freebies three you get three free passes if you get caught
Oh three catches that that thing that I read before people ought to be foaming at the mouth about the because that's a local story
About the two priests with these stature limitations and the local archdiocese is well
We don't care about the civil case because you know
