easy on Bella
So I said I can
convince everybody that the town really sucks that they'll pack up and get out of here and then the town will be a lot better
Because all the miscreants in the
Dirt bags and crap heads. I'll get that all out of here and make way for some living and breathing people
A lot of come down here and have a good time and open it up a little bit and get all these repressive right wing old dying creaks out of here
And I said, I've been trying that for 17 years and it still has awards.
You notice why he's wearing a skirt up to our armpits and he's got those things strapped on towards him?
What is this, a new look now?
I guarantee you that there's some whips and chains and dungeons and dragons going on without carrying whatever's name is.
Cory Hayne or whatever's name is for boyfriend?
We have an open line at Dave, 751. Here we go again. We got an open line at Dave. We got an open line at the star line.
We got the over here. We got over there. Has anybody wanted to talk to us? That's this town. Adam is right, Janet. God.
It sucks.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Neil, how you doing there?
I'm doing great.
It sounds pretty good.
I want to say something. Never about a month ago you're talking about that.
That's good that you want to say something. I would hope that's why you call.
Yes, sir.
Given about a month ago you're talking about these women that are driving.
No, worse. Oh my God.
I am so, so, so, worse.
When I was driving myself home from the hospital last week I get behind some old bag, some disgusting, pathetic, brain dead bitch.
And he's going making the thing off 95 out of a turnpike there driving like two miles an hour in reverse.
And he's weaving in all the lanes at the same time and I thought I was going to kill myself there before I got home.
Well, I'm driving. Okay. And I'm at high Leah getting ready to get on.
I'll be driving or I'll be road and there's this girl.
So I won't say something else. Yeah.
Please not all the makeup looking in the river mirror. Right? Yeah.
He doesn't notice the light. Turn. I hawk a little bit. He takes off.
I see. He's on. He's going to weave and in it out every road.
He's not paying attention. Car gets another light car in front of a stop. He doesn't realize it lands on the brakes. Right?
Almost eats his rear end.
Next thing you almost ate his rear end. Yeah. It was with her car. All right.
He starts looking all over.
Why did I just, you know, I just had a feeling. I mean, I knew there was no doubt in my mind that before the end of the car he was either going to say that or he was going to say.
We have an open line and date. Well, I was sure he was going to do it.
Won't you?
Let's go to plantation. Hello.
Can't breathe when I'm job brushy. I love your past.
WS. Let's set up and take your clothes off.
Why baby? Why don't you see?
Why? Why can't you see?
I don't know. God.
That's enough.
1208 is my cranberry would say that's enough. And that what he says is that's one of the famous lines along with Uga Bougain.
And challenge, challenge, challenge.
We have two open lines. You're both in Broward again. Two open lines.
Loin in Broward at 5249463524WYOD. This is the worst.
This is just don't answer any more calls today. I'm doing streamless after I do these. I'm sure I can't take it.
I just cannot. This is the worst WYOD.
I'm calling for the plantation line.
From the plantation line?
The Broward line.
Yeah. How's it going now?
Great. Welcome back.
Why do you say that? I'm calling from the plantation.
Or is he busy now? He digested.
Another reason I'm calling him.
It's her next. Think you're radio down.
Give it a rest.
So the real thing about women drivers. Remember that radio was going in India now?
What's in it?
K.A.
Susan, thank you.
Yeah. What's next?
I have no idea.
And then they had some women wrestler on the other day from some wrestling team.
What the hell is that all about?
And they had some women hockey player on the other night from the hockey ward.
There was some bitch who plays hockey in Canada somewhere.
Oh my God. What's next?
Yeah. I really don't know.
God only knows.
Next to the women's topology.
They're making that base for women with Madonna.
Yeah.
Like Madonna can play baseball?
Once he's got enough arms to it here, I would say.
Probably more than Steve Stone.
I don't know.
Only I just want to say welcome back and wish you the best.
Thanks a lot, sir. See you.
WYOD.
Come on up to that.
You're new in the WYOD.
Do we need to do that to spice up the proceedings a little bit here today?
Okay. Do screen lists the rest of the day?
You're on hold.
Don't panic.
But if nobody answers, just George is busy at digesting.
Outback steakhouse is bringing us some of that great.
The best in the world.
Walk about soup tomorrow.
And if you eat enough of it, boy, you'll be walking about for hours.
Non-tonious.
Like a combination of onion soup and cheese soup.
And a little on the pepper side.
And boy, it is tremendous.
God, I could just jump into a huge bat of the walk about soup.
Now, this week for Father's Day, of course, they're going to be open starting at noon.
Or nearly all the outbacks are open for dinner only every night, seven nights a week.
But because it's Father's Day, the Sunday, they'll be open at noon all the way through the afternoon evening.
So take that over for a fantastic feast at an outback nearby you.
And check out those delicious tender steaks and great appetizers like the blue banana and the walk about soup.
And prime rib and chicken and ribs on the barbie and pasta and seafood and grilled fish.
And gigantic, fattening, disgusting desserts like the chocolate thunder from down under.
Something for the kids too, new kids activity books.
So what's that got the outback for Father's Day starting at 12 noon,
you'll find the outback steakhouse in Kendall in the town of country center.
On West Flagler Street in the Flagler Park Plaza on Southwest 89th place in Breyer Bay on Northeast 163rd Street in sunny isles on Pines Boulevard in beautiful Pembroke Pines.
All they used to be beautiful until they built cemetery village on Riverside Drive and Coral Springs on North Pine Island road in Jackowanda Square in prestigious plantation.
And on Southwest 18th Street in Boca, take that out for a great feast this Sunday to the outback.

Extra extra extra is monotone extra for my day.
Extra is my best.
The lowest price and chain of beansteam. The best is the food and the best.
Variety, quality and freshness. Low prices that only extra can offer.
Like our dynamite item on bonings that rose at $1.28 per pound.
Everyday low prices only an extra but if you find lower prices anywhere else who'll triple the difference in gas.
No, just so do the bakery.
The banding dollar and extra private.
Also, look for our hot prices on items like extra large blue bags at only $59.00.
No one has lower prices than extra and that's not guaranteed.
Look for more details and stores offer balance of $2.24.

This fall join us for another exciting season of dolphins in hurricanes.
But fall I've been away here on down for an export station.
You know little crack out real close to the tree they called this game.
Look a visitor said any smoke from a high school is so gay.
As the mind slowly drifted away from the crack and the sex of the day.
Through the fog and the heat you know we heard the promise to say.
Take another minute on the pipe field.
I'll see you here.
Take another minute on the pipe field.
I'll see you here.
Take another minute on the pipe field.
I'll see you here.
Take another minute on the pipe.
I'll see you here.
Take another minute on the pipe.
So 14 and W.Y.
It seems like only was 70, 80 hours ago today we sat down here.
Isn't today Friday?
I'm telling you.
You may not think so but I'm pretty sure it's Friday.
Miami.
How are you doing?
Glad to hear you feeling better.
You seem like you have a lot more energy now.
Right.
All of a sudden he's Batman and there's no Robin and it's just like a whole different story and they have hord and destroyed.
If I want to see Batman I'll turn on the satellite.
I can see it every afternoon about 10 different times.
Now I've got it now.
Batman was a fun thing.
Well it was corny but it was a little bit clearer than what they're trying to find out now.
I mean you have to remember what they're trying to find out.
What they're trying to base everything on now is the old comics that came back.
Came out originally where Batman wasn't this guy running around in tight-sect and stupid.
He was a...
Well Robin was the guy running around in tight.
Are they a pluses or not a set of files?
I think Goldberg had worked there.
Yeah he really knows this stuff though.
I thought the first movie was fair at best.
I wouldn't watch it.
Come on the tube and I've seen about two minutes of it about three different times and I just shut it right off because there's no resemblance at all to Batman that I know.
I'm just not interested in that.
And I read it as a comic book as a kid and it's still a movie has nothing to do with that.
It would probably be better really to have like sister, fociaro, whatever be catwoman.
Right, there you go.
Sister Soldier.
If you ever noticed though in the first one in this one there's no black people involved.
In what? No, well they're all purple.
No, I mean there's no African Americans and either one.
I thought that was kind of odd.
Is they trying to make Gotham City kind of realistic? Why would they not?
Well why worry have you ever been in Gotham City?
I don't think anybody's been in Gotham.
Well there you go. How many black people were in Superman?
That's true also. It's up for Richard Prior.
You know the black people are got caused to be okay. Leave them alone.
They don't need Superman and Batman. They got enough fantasies already.
Did he got sister Soldier? They got to live down okay?
Have a great day.
Okay.
Yeah.
God.
12-18 is of it. Just a comic book. He's like Dan Klail now with God Dan Murphy Brown okay?
All right so if you just had a stomachache it was just it was a false alarm Dan.
West Palm Beach.
Yeah, Neil.
Yeah.
I'm a new listener. I was just wondering who you're supposed to be.
Thank you so much. It is pretty good. It's pretty Dan Good sir.
All right. Listen. When I was shooting with Lana Breed fans, the question.
Yeah.
What makes y'all think of y'all's America's team?
What makes y'all think that y'all's America's team?
That's right.
Oh.
Seriously?
Well what do you ask your name for? I'm not a brave fan.
That's exactly what you're down in loop.
I'm not a brave fan. I can't stand loopin' Ellie. It makes me sick.
Well look look what the man did for the rest of the day.
I don't care what he did for anybody. He still makes me sick.
And the rest of the veteran right along in the braids have.
So?
Yeah so shoot man. The braids will have nothing.
They'll have nothing.
You better wake up and slip the lilac pad.
You better get with it. Okay. This week it is the moment of truth.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday and let's see who's standing and who's falling on Monday.
No problem.
You didn't have that big, small, brab dibble on the team.
We knocked everybody down. If you didn't have anyone have anything.
Yeah. The place will have nothing either.
I know.
And we'll just be won't wait.
Okay.

I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
I'm going to talk to you on Monday.
What?
Clothing optional in the old dining room.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you, I gave you all that time to get your act together
and work up some pretensive material.
It's definitely a good...
Yeah.
Ask Orlando.
Orlando always is clothing optional.
In the Neal Rogers dining room.
Right.
Oh, you're talking about...
Oh, and now you're bringing up that place again.
Don't do it.
Oh, this is a setup.
Are you sitting up there right now?
Is he anchored on your ponytail or something?
I know.
Can you put him back in a hole?
No, I can't.
We got a lot of people who want to get through here today
and I put you on hold and that's the best you can come up with
is to mention him again.
God.
No, Jeff, you're just...
You're beyond...
Over and above and beyond the call of duty.
And nobody can just handle the...
the incessant.
Did he bring any goods to guards, by the way?
Well, no, I don't want...
Well, you know I don't want one like that,
that elephant's repository.
No, no, like a little one.
That's not the kind of cigar I would ever smoke.
Even when I felt great.
You know what I'm talking about?
A little one, something that I can handle,
something that I'm more...
can identify with more closely.
And I'm not talking about those disgusting...
Well, yeah, I'll smoke one of those.
If you bring them later in.
I told you I've never smoked in cigars again tonight.
It's these calls.
It's these calls.
W-I-O-D.
Nail.
Yeah.
Good afternoon.
Well, boy, how's it going, sir?
How are you?
I'm a met fan, but...
I don't know, I really don't have any complaints.
I think I've been...
The long way to go, it's 162 game seasons, sir.
Don't let them stop their cleats in your face until it's all over.
I haven't seen the standings in seven days either, so...
Well, you're about eight games behind,
and the Cubs even are a game and a half ahead of you guys.
Oh, thank you.
Mitch Lewis brought me a nice slim cigar.
Looks like it's pre-smoked.
It's a long way to go, pal.
We got like almost 100 games to go.
Hey, can I make a request, Neil?
Of course.
I like the way you didn't beat around the bush and suck around first for two.
No, seriously, I don't like people that do that, that suck around,
and feel they want to ingratiate themselves.
Oh, by the way, I love you so much.
Would you please play?
I don't need that.
I'm just a realistic guy.
What is it?
You are a great guy anyway, Neil.
I am. You're right.
See now you're doing it.
Okay.
Can I request Bob Prince?
Can you request him?
For my father?
Well, he's got a bad headache, but...
Yeah, he's a pirate fan, so he's...
He's over at the parts going up the metro going down and...
He's a pirate fan?
Yeah, he is.
Not me.
I bet you haven't heard.
Well, he gave one.
You suppose you can grab one.
How about a dingo land?
Can you give it?
And he take it away.
He is one out of here now.
This would be some kind of pandemonium.
And why not?
Here's the one two-page premiere show.
And there's a ball, Hick Deep Direct Field.
Back close by, they ball on.
And he can't get his football.
Oh!
How's that?
Yeah, sure does bring back memory.
Sure does. Back when I was a pirate fan in a good old days,
when he actually had some guys in there who looked human.
Why used to watch him when I was a kid?
When the committee was in right...
Right.
Darjo and left, so Bob Skinner, right, Bill Verden.
Yes, it was Bob Prince and Noah King every night, so...
Right.
That was great.
And Jim Woods the Possum.
Absolutely.
Right.
Hey, thanks, Neil.
Have a great day.
Fuck you.
See ya.
What happened to that lighter that I was going to have in here briefly?
You know, it's really interesting when the food comes in,
you're sitting in there carrying on like some kind of a petal and child.
And that could have you didn't he?
And all I want is a stinking cheap like 23 said,
don't stand there and wait, I'm keeping it in here for a while.
You know these cheap cigars are hard to keep lit?
Hmm, they're like our audience, they're hard to keep alive.
Let's do the starline, shall we?
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Excuse my ignorance, but I've been wondering...
Why should you be any different?
I've been listening on and off to the show for the last week,
and I keep hearing about this blimp that got away.
I don't know anything about it.
Oh, I make blimp.
Was there a blimp that got away?
I don't know.
And it must have been while I was in a hospital.
Oh, okay.
Where was it?
I don't know.
I just keep hearing college calling.
You know, I'm going to have a WIOD blimp.
Adam let it.
But the IOD blimp that Adam let you away,
like that's a major story, like that's a news bullet,
and the IOD blimp got away and it wound up in Vegas,
and they thought it was Hank.
You didn't see it on CNN?
No, you're right.
Right.
So what kind of blimp will be?
Yeah, on Cox News Network, right.
What was this blimp for?
It's the WIOD blimp.
It's for a while.
It's like a little promotional thing
because we can't afford any real promotion.
Well, I make blimp.
Maybe I can help you out with the blimp.
No, we don't need any new blimp.
She don't need a new blimp.
We don't want no blimp.
How about a hot air balloon?
We got enough hot air to do.
Come on, I got to make a sales call.
They're going to fire my ass.
Yeah.
So who are you going to talk to?
There's nobody to talk to here.
They're all out.
Well, let me talk to one.
Huh?
All right, hold on.
Talk to him, like for a second, and then hang up on him.
12.45, or just hang up on him, period.
At WIOD, let's do a date, county.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes.
We've got a little problem.
What's the risk of this guy's problem with Batman?
I mean, there's a black guy in the first Batman.
There is?
Yeah, there's a guy who played in Star Wars, the big black guy.
The big-
The ability Williams.
That's right.
He was the commissioner in Batman.
Huh.
You know, these people, there's no black people here.
Well, suppose there wasn't any black guy in Batman.
Was there any Jewish guys in there?
You have to take their pants down.
Yes.
Also, for once a part of Batman America.
Oh, the Robin wasn't in it, huh?
Yes.
Once a part of Batman America, you've got to rent the long version that's unearned.
I have the long, I have the long-undered version, unexpercated at home.
And you understand the movie, do you not?
Mm-hmm.
I think.
I think.
Well, they've watched this film on TV.
Oh, we don't understand.
They've watched it all around.
Well, wait a minute.
Were there gunshots at the end before the garbage truck went running off?
Yes, it was.
I forgot that.
See, because it's been a long time since I watched it.
Yes, it was.
I didn't watch it on TV because I knew it was going to cut out a lot of things that it's brainwashed.
Oh, of course.
A lot of what's going on.
Well, anyway, I just wanted to share my little insights with you.
Have a great day, and I'm glad you're back.
Thank you.
And Brian Bloom is God.
1247 at WIOD.
He's in the battle of cigar.
It's like a noodle that miscavied.
It's a rac canudo?
Oh.
It's a minuto?
I'll start with that minuto crap.
We got enough problem with this place already.
So, by the way, speaking of minuto, how's Buddy Nevin's coming with that pedophile radio ring that we heard about last November?
What is this now?
Like, is it July almost?
I'll tell you, buddy.
Man, this must be some investigation.
Even Shylock Holmes and Batman and Robin and Hank are having trouble uncovering the fact that they're going to be in the battle.
They're going to be covering all the characters in this.
God, buddy.
What a job at the Sun Sentinel, where if there isn't a real story there, we'll make one up.
Okay, especially if it makes people in radio or TV or anybody else, we don't like look really bad.
Yeah.
That massive radio pedophile ring.
Because you know what they say at the Sun Sentinel, don't you?
I know what they say.
He was his word.
Not his pedophile.
Hey, Goldberg is your host for another Gold Merged Night Radio show tonight at 8.
It's the radio's biggest fan of the new IoT.
He's not just Hank Goldberg, he's a hip hop hot-a-mus.
And the WYOD Blimp.
1251 of WYOD.
Hello.
Deal.
Yes, sir.
Glad you're feeling better.
I'm feeling a great man.
I'm talking to Stan Major.
He has a question for you.
Yeah.
Who do you want playing second base for the cup?
What kind of person do you want?
That's that Palm Beach County humor.
WYOD.
Hello, Neil Rodd.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
You sound pretty good.
I do.
How are you being?
I've been pretty good.
Oh, yeah.
I heard you had been making fun of Mount Sinai recently.
I've been making fun of Mount Sinai.
No, I haven't been making fun of Mount Sinai.
Sir, I've been relating my personal two life experiences, sir.
And it was no fun.
Yeah, but I mean, if the hospital wasn't there, you'd be still passing that stone.
That's true.
Why you work there?
No, I don't work there.
This isn't Omar, is it?
Excuse me?
This isn't Omar from Mount Sinai, is it?
No, this is just a listener.
Well, what the hell do you know if you ever been in Mount Sinai?
I was born there.
You were born well, right?
That bears out what I've been saying.
God, I'm speechless.
I'm just literally like that.
Yeah, but you know, it wasn't like that.
So you were born there?
What did you have to do with that?
Like, you couldn't have been born someplace else?
No, but I mean, at the good hospital.
And suppose they would put it like a big dent in the middle of your head when you were born
and you walked around looking like a bonehead on your life.
You can go to, if you went to Jackson, you probably would have still been sitting there now.
Well, I'd be better off for it, wouldn't I?
At least they wouldn't have done anything to me yet.
I mean, do they do any rectal exams on you?
In fact, they had like a, a battery of proctologists in there, a search party.
Oh, well.
And they said, oh, yeah, you work at WIOD.
I said, how do you figure that out?
They said they all, all the same assholes work over there.
But you should go back over there next time you get sick.
Maybe they'll take better care of you.
Okay, thanks so much.
All right.
See you.
Who the hell are you kidding?
Okay.
He wasn't born at Mount Sinai.
He was hatched.
1253 at WIOD.
Dave County.
Welcome to 610 WIOD, your highly overrated station.
Hey, uh, you're joke of the airwaves.
Hey, I don't want to argue with you.
Where Meg Green is queen and the plant guy might be too for all we know.
What is it?
Hey, I don't want to argue with you about it.
I'm glad that you're back by the way.
You would know what argue with me about what?
Uh, this sister soldier thing was, uh, a name isn't soldier, sir.
It's soldier.
Whatever.
Soldier as in soldier boy.
Well, anyway, it was taken completely out of context.
And, you know, she said on the air yesterday wasn't taken out of context.
She is a disgusting and militant obmanacious.
Uh, just absolutely needs to be smashed in the face bitch is what she is.
Maybe this is something that I didn't hear, but I heard her saying something about she'd never used drugs when he had and talk about him cheating on his wife.
So what the hell is that have to do with anything?
What does that got to do with their telling black people to go out and kill a bunch of white people?
What's that got to do with any he puffed on a joint one time and that makes him a bad guy?
I bet she's puffed on worse things than that.
No, it doesn't make him a bad guy.
But, I just like, just like Jackie Mason said, whoever put a salami sandwich or a pastrami sandwich in their mouth, they didn't intend to eat it.
Well, so who the hell is he kidding?
I know you have your feelings about it.
I know that you've just read the quote that was taken out of context.
I didn't just read anything, sir.
I don't come on a year and just start mouthing off if I don't know what I'm talking about.
I saw the press conference and I saw her yesterday morning on CBS this morning, which made me want to toss my cookies.
She is nauseating and militant and disgusting.
And if Bill Clinton never does anything else besides, I tell Jesse Jackson were to shove it, he'll be okay in my book.
I am so sick and tired of everybody in the Democratic Party sucking around with Jesse Jackson because they were afraid he's going to control all a black vote
and they're not going to get in. They never get in anyway.
It's about time somebody told Jesse to take a hike with his big fat trouble making stirring the pot opportunistic, leasing the public mouth.
They don't need deep breaths, deep breaths.
Meal though. He did take it completely out of context.
And what she said originally wasn't like what it came out like.
Whatever you say.
I love sister soldier.
Well, you know, I'm nice to either without lemon.
I don't care when we're the other about it.
Well, then why do you keep talking to Trinic about it here, sir?
You just want to keep repeating and just ramming it down our ears.
No, why don't you like an ear infection just hearing this over and over and over again?
No, in fact, I wanted to talk about.
Who are already is what I say.
But he did take it out of context. I heard it.
Yeah, it's a fourth time. You said that.
Your point is made, sir. Your point is made.
You don't care about it, but I don't have any point.
Well, you're talking about how bad she was to have said.
I'm not talking about anything.
I never even mentioned her today.
Forget about her and the boats she came in on.
Score.
Okay.
Who the hell is she anyway?
I don't know.
Exactly. Okay. So forget about it.
Because it's something that was on.
It was something on television again.
Okay. That's the problem with this whole goddamn country, sir.
Is whatever is on television is like the buzz word of the moment.
And everybody starts buzzing about it.
And nobody ever heard of these people.
And probably were just as well or better off for not hearing of them.
Well, the only one that I have ever heard.
Who gives a crap about sister's soul job?
Well, the only reason that I have any interest in it at all is because I heard the original comment.
You're repeating yourself again, sir. It was taken out of context.
You said that 50,000 times.
Well, that's not what I was going to say, but okay.
Wait a minute. What is this?
Why too late?
No, are you the lighter lady?
Well, good. Give that one back to George.
And thank you so much. Thank you a million.
You're a great American. Thanks a pile.
The lighter lady just came in, sir.
Oh, how much?
That's okay.
Well, listen. So I see you've got to remind me that's about that anyway.
What is the point?
You've already made your point 50,000 times.
Why are you saying that?
Well, you answer me one question.
What do you answer me?
We've made the point about that.
You're trying to move on. Well, let me give you a hand.
1257 at WIO.
Oh, God almighty. What a pain in the ass.
How do you like to have him in your household, okay?
Well, wait a minute.
For the eighth, for the 18th time,
let me make a point here, okay?
Let me make a point.
Who, first of all, nobody gives a crap.
That's number one.
And then just to keep repeating it and repeating it and droning,
you're worse than my mother.
I'm in the middle of this massive allergic reaction.
That penicillin I'm breaking out in hives and I'm scratching.
And I'm practically in tears.
And she starts in, she gets on this kick like a Joan Crawford routine
with a hangers.
What happened to all those plastic hangers?
I gave you this expensive hangers.
I gave you 14 to 20 of those hangers.
You've got all those cheap wire hangers in your closet.
I said, good, call up Joan Crawford.
The two of you can cry over it.
Maniac.
I'm going through this agonizing, living hell.
I'm trying to scrape the skin off my fingers with a bath towel
because I'm itching and screaming and I got like hives.
And I've taken like 80,000 milligrams of this disgusting
grotesque penicillin for my pill doctor across the street.
And she's talking to China about what happened to all those expensive
plastic hangers I had in the goddamn clothes closet.
And what a disgrace because I got my clothes on all these cheap wire hangers.
That's what that guy reminded me of.
The definitive right there.
In fact, sir, let me suggest something.
Take a hanger right now and go into the closet and try it on for size.
Try that deal.
You know where you put the rope around your neck and you hang yourself
from the ceiling and see if it like heightens your sexual excitement.
And stick your fist right up your button.
See how the call is on Monday and let us know how it came out.
New is from around the planet with Rick and SUDs from two to six this afternoon
and free weed for the classroom.
We got sunny Hershey and Joseph.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
On draft talk at 605 tonight and Hank Goldberg live from the WIOD Blimp at
Caesar's Palace in Vegas tonight decided to fully field home championship fight.
Nobody does it like Hank Goldberg at night.
South Florida zooms traffic and weather.
Who's talk radio six 10 WIOD my every four water deal in the Palm Beach.
It's.
We're either here.
WIOD.
Hi, this is Ron McGill from Miami, Metro zoo and I listen to that Neil Rogers one at two hour.
Hell, let's even better than sex with the animals.
Yeah, got you.
Everyone is proud.
Everyone is proud.
All the guys are gay.
All the guys are gay.
Most are fruit and nuts.
All the fruits and nuts.
All the rest are flakes.
All the rest are flakes.
Earthquakes take the ground.
Earthquakes take the ground.
The mud flies every day.
The mud flies every day.
California's sliding up.
California's sliding up.
Interceptance is go bad.
They've went us to the beach.
Then when they're getting laid.
Wearing nothing but a snake.
But a snake.
A smile on their face.
A smile on their face.
They put more oil on their butt.
Oil on their butt.
Then in a several days.
California's sliding up.
California's sliding up.
California's sliding up.
Interceptance is go bad.
They've got.
Interceptance is go bad.
106 of WIOD.
There's something sterile in the environment here.
It's not the year either.
Any minute that stuff that botulism could break out again.
Or is that on the yes salads here on the table that I've been sitting here for about three hours now?
I want to make a stentorian pronouncement now.
And I know we'll never live up to it because I say this every few days.
And we always are full of crap.
Tomorrow outback is coming with that walk about soup which is about my favorite thing in the world.
Oh God, do I love that.
But after that for the remit.
What's it eight tomorrow the 19th?
The rest of the month of June there shall be no more food in here during 10 to 2.
Because remember I said before the food started this morning about how great I felt.
And that after the food I would be like a little less full of piss and vinegar.
And the oil and vinegar and all that other stuff.
And it's true.
You feel like draggy.
You start like you want to sleep and you feel tired and lethargic.
Being on the year is not the time to be shoveling food in your mouth.
So with all due appreciation to Villa deli and all the other food forces out there in radio land.
We're taking a hiatus for several days.
Tomorrow we got the soup from outback.
The walk about which is great and will not make you the lethargic.
It'll make you just jump up and down and scream for joy.
And that's about it.
And all you sales people out there in the back room go out and sell somebody and get out of our face.
W-I-O-D.
Hello.
Yes sir.
Yeah hold for Neil.
This is he.
He'll.
Yes.
Still God.
What do you mean you're holding for Neil?
What are you holding?
The phone is just ringing isn't it?
Oh yeah it was.
Yeah we're doing screenless this because George needs a long rest.
You shot me.
Good.
I wanted to give you a bitch story about another female driver.
Yeah.
Yesterday as I was coming off of I-75 getting on a palmetto.
You know I have got all the cars lined up there in rush hour.
Well this bitch decides to go up to the front of the line.
Don't you love those?
Cut and cut in on an 18 wheeler.
Only he didn't stop.
He rammed her right in the passenger side door.
Oh!
Outstanding.
It was the best.
See there is justice here once in a while if only by accident.
Yes and then yesterday later on after that I'm tailgating this car.
There's a bout room for her.
There's a roof.
There might not be a lot so funny just the way you said that like that's the way it's supposed to be you know.
Well that's all you can you know.
Wait.
All you can fit within a square mile of.
Exactly.
Anyway there's a bout room to fit a Ugo in between me and the car in front of me.
Yeah.
And this bitch with a Cadillac holds right in there.
I beat my horn.
I had to plan the brakes on.
And then she throws me the finger.
How do you like it?
Classy.
Hey you're classy.
Yeah.
That guy that little while ago.
I would have sandwiched her ass with whatever was in front of her and just turned her window up pancake.
I should have if I had been driving my Ugo she was she was mine.
Did me.
That guy that called a little while ago about sister soldier.
Yeah.
Your phone's cutting out I think it's a conspiracy.
I probably told Nicole you.
He believed her alone.
Right.
I'd like to call quickly before your.
Like I said I think the phone was dying for a good reason though.
It's you I think it was an Omen.
110.
10 after one.
The one hand the little hands on the one and the big hands up your butt.
Catch the latest news traffic and weather info each morning with Mike.
What's the most surprising thing in the morning information team just before the meal.
Resurrect.
So anybody got a dog.
Oh why not?
You have you have no shame at this stage of your life.
Why should you?
I bet you somebody in our audience has a small dog.
Cades that they like to give Cheryl.
For her dog that she's getting is that okay.
I'm trying for you with our vast audience out there of at least 30 or 40 people.
Most of our brain didn't know a dog if it bit him on his.
Yes.
But anyway if somebody's got a little dog cage call George up and he'll get the number and give it to Cheryl.
And we'll solve her problem there at least one of them anyway.
114 at W.I.O.D.
Wasn't that nice?
What's wrong with that?
The probably people got it put away in the garage somewhere that haven't used it in 20 years.
Clean it out first before you bring it over here by the way.
Okay don't bring her some filthy trashy dog cage.
Bring her something nice and new and shining and clean and antiseptic.
Anyway it's 115 at W.I.O.D.
And we're doing screenless till 2 o'clock today.
We got Rick and Scott.
Are they in town again today?
Is that two shows in a row?
God.
Man they're really a dangerous president just like the one we got up in Washington.
W.I.O.D.
So weak, weak, weak.
That was the worst one we've heard in years.
Terrible.
W.I.O.D.
Dale.
Yes sir.
You know what I'm talking about in Erie.
Oh please, Possum.
Well you know I used to think that you had the best job in radio.
Yeah.
And then I realized it's really Reneerie.
I mean you might not make as much money as you.
But how do you know that?
Nobody knows how much of it.
Well that's true.
He's pretty tight lip like most Possums okay.
Well let's look at what Reneerie does for his money.
Let's look at it typical out.
Oh that won't take long.
Well you got the 7 o'clock news.
No come out.
No come out.
The 7 o'clock news goes 10 after 12 after.
Right.
Erie comes on and says up.
Got to play a couple of spots.
Yeah.
Comes back on.
Worthy list.
Let's check Bob's over.
Worthy list.
Does the weather.
You're gonna weather in the sports and here's the voice of the kids.
I'm gonna hear you for the next 10 minutes.
Yep.
That's it.
Right.
Good four hours.
Doesn't say anything.
And here's the attack.
10 movies this week.
Well a Batman.
20 million dollars this week.
Yeah.
Hey.
What a great deal.
He comes in and he.
I mean you got to talk to him.
What are you not supposed to talk about this because they haven't discovered that yet.
And he'll get very upset if they ever find out.
Yeah because they could save a lot of money there.
But I don't know.
You talk about the easiest job in radio.
I wouldn't wish following the 9 to 10 hour on anybody.
Well I just thought that I just you know thinking about that.
Have you ever heard the voices on that thing?
What do we call it?
Were the people call in?
Oh the telephone.
The telephone.
Have you ever heard the voices on there?
It's like the same six people and five of them have been dead for 20 years.
Well I think the telephone question this morning was they wanted to know how many times in the show when Erie picked his note.
Right.
And a lot of interest in that one.
Nope but none of the audience could count that high.
Well he's got a great job and I don't know how long.
I'll get a grip on yourself.
Sir and have a great life.
Okay you're just a little too out of control for me.
117 at WIOD.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yes sir.
Hello to Neil.
Speaking.
Neil.
Yes.
You pick up the phone now.
I'm doing screenless today for a little while because George is on strike.
This is all right.
This is a little kid in coil springs that you hate.
Sir can I say something to you?
Why don't you find something to do besides try to call here and be a smart act?
If you would call, if you would call, if you would call,
would you shut up and listen?
What?
If you would call rarely like most intelligent people instead of like every camera.
Yeah right.
And engage in some kind of verbal dialogue.
Besides trying to be some kind of a smart act and show your butt to the whole world.
Is that what you want to do sir?
Why don't you just take your pants off?
117 at WIOD.
See what I mean?
He just, he's not capable of it.
Okay.
I guess when you're born that small it's just a cross that you have to bear for the rest of your life.
So to speak.
WIOD.
Neil, what side of your body hurts when you get that operation?
A big your pardon?
The side that you're a gallbladder zone like the right side?
Oh.
Well Hank was wrong that last time.
Wrong about one.
He was mentioning your remonies that make sure everybody punches you on the left side.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well he's out there for the fight.
A Neil?
Yeah.
I'll just go into Snapple this.
118 at WIOD.
See what I mean about just barely, barely making the needle move at all like on the Richter scale of life.
WIOD.
WIOD.
Mr. Radio's the best.
Was that Gary Sibel?
I would swear it sounded like him.
The opinions expressed in this program are not necessarily those who stand WIOD rich projects.
When you were a child your mother told you to clean your plate because there were people starving in India.
You always wondered what good it would do.
The fact is it makes those starving people feel a whole lot better to know that you're not letting food go to waste.
Food that they could eat.
The Clean Flate notification bureau can help.
Every time you clean your plate, the Clean Flate notification bureau will let a starving family know about it.
Just imagine the smiles on their grimy gong faces when they hear you beaten all your dinner.
Oh, get around everybody.
It's a letter from the Clean Flate notification bureau.
Oh, what did it say?
It's just little tibi grease, but in Kenno, I'll clean this plate every night plus week.
He keeps it up here.
Oh, he keeps it all heavy.
Look, they sent the Clean Flate.
I should make sure it's clean all the way.
Oh no, no, no, no.
This is Bernie the Flate.
You and the Clean Flate notification bureau can do a world of good, a third world of good.
So how's your friend micromember doing up there in Coral Springs?
123 at WIOD and let's do a Broward County.
Hello?
Hello?
There's somebody on there, you know?
Trust me.
Hello?
Yes.
Hello?
Yeah.
Okay, another punk.
They're out of school now.
Send him to camp, barbed wires, lots of microwave ovens, large radar ranges.
WIOD.
Nail.
Yeah.
Hi, how you doing?
Okay.
Did I call you last Thursday before you went in for your operation?
Yes, sir?
I had, I was someone going in for the effect of me.
Oh, well, I sure hope you had a better thing than I did.
Well, it was, it was still.
It was a different experience.
Yeah.
I did that.
I was the thing I was worried about most was when they go to give it an over cane.
And I tell you what, that first little prick will definitely get your attention.
I believe it.
If I can say that.
That's what they saying, Coral Springs.
Yeah, it was, I wouldn't want to do it again, but it's over and done with.
Well, I don't want to get to a personal, but where they administer the over cane.
Well, I mean, at the base, can we say?
At the base, yeah.
Right around that area.
The base of the base.
You got it.
And it brought me up out of the table.
I would think so.
But we made it through it.
I did all the horror stories I've heard about afterwards.
The next two days weren't really a little tender, but.
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
Love me tender, right?
There you go.
Well, that's good.
We both survived it.
I'm glad you made it through too.
Well, I was a little harrier, but what can I tell you?
Yeah.
And the operation too, right?
It's all in the distant past now.
You just look back and kind of laugh.
There you go.
And hold your side, real tight.
Well, the only of them, my biggest problem now is the mafiliate fans.
So the suffering continues.
It's different.
Hey, tonight's the big night.
Cubs and the fillies at the vet.
We got chilling on the mall.
We might have a chance.
The first one, flew picture for the cub.
Castillo.
Yeah.
Now, let me just tell you about Frankie Castillo.
He's either very good or very bad.
There's no happy medium with old Frank.
Yeah.
So we're.
Did that fill you?
Yeah.
So we'll see which one shows up.
7.35 PM tonight.
I'll be listening.
OK.
All right.
Bye.
1.25.
Already.
God.
This is moving along like lightning, isn't it?
It seems like what?
70, 80, 90 hours ago that we sat down here today.
And this basically almost empty building where there isn't nothing going on.
It is.
It's sterling here.
It's like a vacuum.
There's just nothing.
No excitement.
There's no vibration.
There's no anything.
There's no pulse.
It's like death.
You walk up and down the hallway.
And there's a couple of like salespeople who look like they're lost, wandering around.
And some of the people from the coast are like, ah, what's going on?
We still on the air?
What's the worst platewood?
Where's the playlist?
Although I again commend them.
I cannot believe that they played I in the sky this morning by the Alan Parsons project.
God.
The greatest record in the history of music.
I mean, undeniably beyond the shadow of a doubt because that's my opinion.
W-Y-O-D.
W-Y-O-D.
Neil.
Yeah.
I was in a hospital at the plantation.
For a plantation general?
Excuse me?
Plantation general?
No.
Humana?
No.
It was university.
University?
It was University Pavilion on University Drive.
Never heard of it.
Never heard of it?
I didn't know where University and what?
74th, something.
I'm from Dave Callies.
I don't know.
74th, something.
I think it was the address of the University Drive.
Well, whatever you say.
Well, anyway, I think I had a worst than you did.
I'm ready to see you back.
Everything is OK.
I have a request.
Well, what does that mean?
I mean, what did you just say?
You think you had it worse than I did and what?
What do you have?
I had it worse than I did.
Oh.
I basically got off easy.
OK, what is it?
I want to hear Sammy Smith-Carrity at yesterday.
OK.
Thank you.
Good luck to you.
Thank you.
Oh, man.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
We can't say sorry enough.
127 at WIOD and I'm telling you, man, what's going on in this town?
I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Himmler and Eva Brown on a bad day or sister soldier.
God.
Yes, today, Sammy Smith-Carrity went all the way.
Will that bum never know how to play?
I can't believe what happened yesterday.
Yesterday, the playoff didn't seem so far away.
Thanks to Sammy, now there is no way.
Oh, yesterday, so clearly, why you drive that ball and your face will go away.
Sammy, now I love you, Brian.
So shame.
By Sammy, pack that man a sandwich.
Salami on Rye with mayonnaise.
129 at WIOD and let's, how about line 8, WIOD?
Why have this discovered a gallbladder?
WIOD.
Now that they're free, they're even those banana.
They're still as we...
WIOD.
Hello.
WIOD.
Give it up, Neil.
WIOD.
WIOD.
Hello.
Yes.
Who's this, micromember?
WIOD.
Yes, Neil.
Yeah.
Oh, you're doing a different format today.
Yeah, we sure are.
Oh.
Like to mix it up a little bit, you know what I'm saying, sir?
Yeah, I was confused.
I was calling and calling and calling and calling.
Just let it ring.
Is that a keep doing it?
It's like weird.
Yeah, it is like weird.
Like.
Like.
Anyway, how you doing?
Uh, I like.
Yeah.
What do you think of all the things going on in the news today?
Like depressing, man.
That's the day the worst contention of Taco I we've spoken to in many, many years here today.
WIOD.
Yeah, Neil?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I wanted to talk to you about Rick's Census.
Why?
Oh, you, we saw him at a, you know, Rob's department store.
You know what?
At a Rob's.
Our OASS.
Rob?
Yeah.
And he was changing his shirt right in the middle of the store.
Yeah.
And this guy's, I mean, he's a total idiot.
130 at WIOD.
Let's go to a Dave County.
Hello?
Oh, you all.
WIOD.
Only air.
WIOD.
You know, Alan's ruined.
How you doing?
WIOD.
It's, hey, Neil, how's it going?
Pretty good.
All right.
Listen, first I'd like to leave all these celebrities we're hearing from today.
The greats and the air greats.
We had Elvis Jr. Jr., we just had Elvis Rubin Jr.
I hate it when that happens.
Yeah.
And listen, I'd like to say thanks to you and Rick and Suds.
You made me a top radio conference.
Do you like to remember Jr.?
Yeah.
Yeah, you guys are making money for the station.
In fact, two parts commentary.
One of them is under the soldier thing, whoever is later.
I think the Benjamin Hookson, people like Alex Darsen and Jesse, they got a lot of nerve
saying that people are struggling in the issues when they're given a lot of credit to this lady,
possibly with an eye for eight education.
It has talent field where anybody who can make a real cheap rhyme can make a million dollars.
So let's talk about minimalizing the issues.
What's wrong with making a cheap rhyme?
Just ejection been doing.
They're making a career that's for 30 years now.
Yeah, but you know, people, you're absolutely right about the TV thing.
If there weren't for the TV, then this woman wouldn't be causing anybody any problems.
I'd never heard of her and my life would be a lot better.
Thanks, Max.
Anyway, so that a good hospital story, boy, you might like this stuff.
It was up in West Palm, so that's to tell you something anyway.
My uncle, he's a pretty subtle guy.
He's about 55.
He's pretty tough, but he's still working.
And he had none of the job accident.
And he screwed up his knee and his back.
And he was hospitalized for a cute pain.
He couldn't move or anything.
So he told them, first off, hey, I'm allergic to Thailand all.
And I'm allergic to tape.
And they put it on his charge.
And they stick him in bed.
And they said, hey, you got some good pain there.
So what do you think?
And they taped a bunch of Thailand all the way there.
So it's just about.
They started pumping in with Thailand all three.
You know, good coating stuff in there.
And they taped the IVs with arm of course.
And so he had this spectacular allergic reaction for as well.
So in order to treat the allergic reaction, they stick him in the bathtub.
It's got like a side door, like an old model A roadster or something.
It's called about 100 gallons of water.
And he put oatmeal or some kind of crap in there to relieve the allergic reaction.
And he's sitting in there just starting to give him a little bit in this side door.
Blow is open on this thing, right?
So this poor 65-year-old man gets blown out on the water.
So out on the floor with 100 gallons of water.
And I was hooting though.
On the surface right up to the part where he hits the...
The landings there.
Yeah.
And that wasn't so soothing.
So then they said, oh yeah, well, we've been having a problem with that.
And the next day they're stuck him back in it and guess what happened?
It blew open again.
One more time.
It blew open again.
So, in the meantime, he's talking real nice lawsuit.
They keep opening with the tire over.
Massive lawsuit.
Massive lawsuit.
Just keep sanitary.
Okay, but now it has a good rain to it.
But we're not quite finished.
Yeah.
They put him in his table.
It's some kind of entire body traction, right?
And this thing rotates from side to side to keep the blood bodily fluids moving and stuff.
Like that.
And they didn't quite have a hang on how to put him in there because he's got this back problem, right?
But they sat them in at the feet.
They sat them in around the top of his head, but they didn't mobilize his back.
So this thing rotates from side to side.
And he's swinging back and forth like that.
So the head is all that's exactly in right?
Oh man, that would be good on paper and talent.
That would be great.
So it was lovely.
So he said screw you.
He made him give him his clothes.
He got up and left.
And now he's going to see their ass off.
Oh, it's amazing.
So I have a good day at Yale.
We have half.
So let's see.
134.
You know, that punk that's called before about how, how come I'm ripping my side out because he was born there?
I mean, what kind of logic is that when you stop and think about that, talk about pre-pubescent mentality?
How is it possible for there to be somebody dumb kids running around on a loose?
How is it possible?
Like I was born in strong memorial hospital and watching you in New York, okay?
And if somebody got butchered up there, when I say, oh, yeah, you shouldn't be knocking him.
I was born there after all.
So how does that mean?
You punk.
Get the latest news, traffic and weather info each morning with Mike Granari in the morning information team just before the New Reggie show.
I think the latest season is very crappy.
He had a stuff of kids with a hubby.
Now he's getting black from our 90GC.
I'm getting black from our 90GC.
I'm getting black from our 90GC.
I'm getting black from our 90GC.
I'm getting black from our 90GC.
Why is Dan Quayle started picking on me?
Every time he sees this, I just never wait.
He's got a fucking bird.
He's got a single leg.
Well, it's hard.
He's got a cow.
We're getting down on every side.
I'll be here when the house is going away.
We must have something better to do with VT.
Hi, Dan Quayle.
Get a light.
We're going to go on a little bit more on slime ball.
You're going to get a lighter.
You're going to get a lighter.
We're going to get a lighter.
We're going to get a lighter.
We're going to get a lighter.
It has a tiny little baking crème family over there.
There's a glimpse through there called Fat Jack the North Yew,
and it looks just like Enkelburg.
Oh, I did see that.
Oh, yeah, here it is.
That's like a candy sandwich.
You were doing it in 1986.
I recognize those kids anywhere, man.
But,...)
Now, you know, I spend all that 3 time in Vegas.
Absolutely, it is.
I rest my case.
That's probably the other woodmobrene right now.
Yeah, but maybe to refresh my memory didn't properly set up Sunday racing.
And that they did I think last year and year before they tried it for two seasons and I liked it a lot
I thought it was great, but they didn't like it and they dropped it.
Yeah, because I thought it was their one Sunday night, but I was in the argument with someone to say no, now they never
But if you're dead two years in a row, we did it and I was there every Sunday and I liked it a lot and
What can I tell you? They didn't like it.
I thought so, but just remember when you're ripping hands, he's obviously got friends in high places there
And you don't want to sleep with the fishes or whatever.
All right.
See you again.
Bye.
142 at WIOD and let's do, I don't know, do the screenless and I try to jump all around a picture that we get micro organ on a couple of times.
WIOD.
WIOD.
Yeah, currently doing the talk show.
What?
I'd be on talk show.
How old are you?
I'm 23.
Wooo!
Let's go to Dave County WIOD.
Yes, I want to know the time to be a Brent.
WIOD.
But me, oh, yeah, how you doing?
Pretty good.
I'm asking you, uh, that was you know, that was on edge of sound.
That was our buddy from Homestead.
I had blind too.
I couldn't hear because you got in the phone ring and I couldn't hear it so.
Believe me, you're very lucky.
Pretty bad, huh?
Uh, Neil, how's the, you know, the satellite?
You have the number for that?
What are you talking about?
So for the satellite company?
Do I have the number for it?
Yeah.
Oh, like, it's barely like hello or anything and already you want something?
Yes, I'm.
You barely like said hello?
How you been?
How's the operation?
Nah, too late now.
Too late now.
You just want something.
You want the number for which international is that it?
Is that it right?
And you're going to get a date?
Yeah, I'm thinking of getting a date.
Don't think about it.
Do it.
Yeah, definitely.
You will kiss the ground and send the love letters in the sand and uh, the sand.
I'm telling you.
And uh, the only thing that can keep you sane in this town.
Are you in date?
Yeah, I'm in date, yeah.
895.
895.
7661.
7661.
Okay, one more question.
Do you ever watch this old Dream On in HBO?
Never heard of it.
Never heard of it?
Dream On.
Yeah, Dream On.
It's a dream on.
It's pretty funny.
It's about what?
It's an adult comedy.
Uh, I'll take it out.
I like it.
Okay.
Okay, Neil, thanks.
Good luck with your date.
143 at WIOD, the Starline, he said, with great anticipation and hopes for the best and there's
nobody on there, which like I said, ain't too bad.
My comparison.
WIOD.
WIOD.
144.
See there, you did that one little moment there and you think, well, you know, just maybe.
Let it get them out of the system.
You know what I'm saying?
Like some old bad green snot.
It's like way up in your assigned system.
And it's just just hopeless because I mean, it's so small, it's like an ingrown hair nail.
An ingrown hair nail.
Which is a combination.
No, seriously.
That's like an ingrown hair.
A combination ingrown toenail and ingrown hair.
And boy, you get those two babies in there together, fighting to force their way out.
And you got some heavy duty pressure, depending on where it might be.
WIOD.
Okay.
WIOD on the Starline.
Hi, Neil.
Yes.
Hey, I'm so glad you're here that you're feeling better.
You had me in fit-tutoring your operation.
We were really concerned.
Yeah, you had me in fit-tutoring.
That's clever.
A little play on words there.
Oh, well, we were concerned.
We don't want to lose you.
Yeah, I can tell by the response I've been back to the audience who's just a mesmerized.
Well, they're all a bunch of, you know, what?
About the true listeners really care about you.
Yeah.
All those things.
All those things.
How's the deal?
You used to play out fit-tut, you know?
What is it?
You used to play a fit called a blue job.
And I've been dying.
A long gone.
A long gone.
Why?
Because they answered out.
Well, where do we get it?
You don't get it.
There's nothing to see as where do we get it.
It's gone.
They've pulled it out of here because they're a bunch of panties.
Oh, the center shift is a bunch of jobs.
Well, there you go, sir.
We got no more trousers, trout.
We got no more Memphis.
We got no more blue job.
We got no more green job.
I told my wife about a snow job.
That's what we got here.
That's about it.
We got a big snow job from the panties and talks broadcasting.
That's what we got.
Well, with all the money they had, they can afford to pay the fine.
Yeah, right.
You know, we should have...
Oh, that's the problem.
They did pay the fine.
That's the problem instead of standing up and fighting it like they have some principle
to stand on, where they're $5 billion.
I've got a car.
There's money.
Oh, John.
Did they take it out of your salary?
Of course not.
Oh, well, I couldn't have for small things.
Well, Neil, listen.
I just wanted to personally say...
What do you mean did they take it out of my salary?
What does that mean?
Well, where I work, if I threw up, they'll take it out of my salary.
No, I didn't...
I didn't screw up.
Everything that this station got fine for was approved by the middle-level management on this radio station.
Oh, you mean it's looking like a dinner?
Didn't come out...
I don't know who it came out of.
Siri, didn't come out of my height.
I'll tell you that.
Well, we all have to stop for a week's pause with it.
Yeah.
I'm sure you'll survive, okay?
Well, we will.
Now that you're back and healthy, why?
Okay, I'll say, have a great life.
I can grow up already.
$146.00 to WYOD.
What is that?
What do you want?
Why are you holding that?
Like you've got some like magic potion in your hands, like holding that cup of coffee, like a witch's brew behind some piece of boring coffee you've got again.
God, you hear that one spot he does?
Yeah, it starts out like somebody is just stuck their foot about 40 up his butt, like somebody goofs him.
You're regressing back into that 50-year-old.
Hey, that was all you.
Yeah.
Probably talking to Ron St. John a lot lately.
$147.00 at WYOD.
$147.00 at WYOD.
$147.00 at WYOD.
You win the Super Dade.
And Mr. Music or Mr. Radio.
What's his name, Mr. Radio?
What up?
What up?
Well, did you ever see that guy, Mr. Radio?
God.
Oh, man, Mr. Radio, you are like a rottling sack of walking crap is what you are, okay?
You are just pathetic.
God, I'd rather see Alombardo than Mr. Radio.
I'd rather be dead than see Alombardo again.
I'll probably have it pomp and I will have to be settled with his ugliness again up there tonight.
Wandering around desperately hoping that somebody speaks to him.
I love that gang up there on the fourth floor.
They're just all like wander around, find the olex.
I had the two over the three, four, five, and a lot of us.
Nobody cares.
Nobody cares.
Just sit in your own seat and tag your carrot up and just have a good time.
It's not running around trying desperately to find somebody to validate your pathetic existence, okay?
Now, 148 at WIOD and this weekend we're going to be at where we're going to be.
We're going to be at Brandsmark and the Saga Sino small from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday.
Get it right.
This Saturday keeps saying it over and over again this Saturday and they'll be demonstrating the Sony dated this man.
We'll have our Commodore Sous-CDs and those new t-shirts and some tickets to the Dolphins Preseason opener against the Cowboys
and tickets to the Hurricane Home opener against Florida A&M.
And speaking of the Sony dated this man, it is about as much fun as you can have in the palm of your hand legally.
I'll tell you that anywhere in Dayton, Broward, guaranteed.
And there's got all kinds of neat stuff that you pop in there like the dictionary of American flying.
And the Webster Crossword Puzzle dictionary and monarch notes in the International Wine Guide and the official airline guide.
And World Travel Translator and E-Burts Movie Home Companion.
And the timetable of Arson Entertainment is porting his baseball guide and registered and much more.
The Sony dated this man is an electronic book reader that's capable of displaying thousands of pages of text and graphics
stored on a removable disk you just pop them in and yank them out.
And they give you access to an entire library worth of information right on top of your desk or on your briefcase.
And of course it's the perfect gift for Father's Day graduation or back to school or back to school.
So check it out. This Saturday at Brands Mark from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Sony dated this man I'll see you at the Saga Rasp mill Saturday.

It's more reasonable by the naked yourself.
I was great.
I'm gonna be back for you.
Why did you get my hand worse?
So for a sex match with more respect is I throw my mama.
Do you see it yourself?
We're not so mama.
153 at WIOD.
Sivin' a mother.
Johnny Dorkley just in here briefly and boy are we depressed about that.
WIOD.
Oh yes. Can I be on the mirror?
No chance. WIOD.
Hello.
Oops.
Too late. WIOD.
Who?
WIOD.
Zero.
How you doing?
Okay.
Listen you're killing me down here in Southwest Gate.
Why is that?
I've been beaten to steering wheel and laughing so hard tears are running out of my eyes.
Really? Me too?
Listen I got an absolutely seamless request.
No chance.
No chance.
Well it's pretty late.
Well I understand but it will kill a little bit of time.
What is it?
Rayceroni.

153 at WIOD.
Starline.
Time.

Rayceroni.
See ya.
153 at WIOD.
Starline.
That is it.
For up close.
Oh and then we get the phone crashed out.
That was special.
That was the hour and a half of this screenless and you saw this is pretty good.
This is garbage.
And then finally we strike gold man.
That made the whole show.
Thank you so much sir.
That was like the time tunnel and confusion and phone crap and just like rolled it off into one big gigantic electronic ball.
And you're like sitting right inside of it.
That was it.
God.
Man the hairs inside the follicles inside my colon are like trembling now from that.
God that was good.
WIOD.
WIOD.
Neil.
Yes.
I have to tell you this.
I want to celebrate this with you.
24 years ago I had my gold bladder removed.
Yeah.
You know by who?
I know it's Vietnamese doctor using a Russian petition rocket.
155.
Well hey, at least it was cheap anyway.
And no you don't have to worry about the dangers of that very very nauseous anesthetic either.
WIOD.
You play the stock tendon promo.
Yeah right.
WIOD.
Hi.
Neil.
Yes man.
Yeah I just wondered if you knew the 4Fs that were associated with gold bladder disease.
The 4F?
Yes.
It's not that bad.
Is that fertile 48 and flat?
Do you have any of those?
Please don't take the effort.
I think that's pretty interesting.
Yeah that's cute.
Alrighty.
Not great but cute.
It's cute.
It's real though.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Bye bye.
Pretty weak.
156 of WIOD.
Who's that?
Or is that you?
Or do you pick it up?
It was what?
Oh cranked.
On the bat line.
Oh boy.
Bat riches.
Given that number out again.
Probably got another feeding ticket.
See I originally wasn't going to, I wasn't going to sit on him.
You know, but he keeps every kind of get stopped to give the cop the bat line.
He's going to get a big boy.
He's going to get a big boy.
Give it I'm saying.
There you go.
Bat riches boyfriends again.
WIOD.
Hi Neil.
Hi.
For the ticket was born in downtown.
I went in there 20 years ago.
Perfect and came up with a brain damage child.
How you love brain damage.
Yeah.
Number two, sit through your soldier was on, uh...
Speaking of brain damage.
So gone, you asked the right.
And he went, uh, he had food stamps, tap of the life.
And received a scholarship to go to college.
And now he's condemning the very system that gave her that chance.
I think that's pretty unfair.
He makes me an author.
Tell him.
He makes me want to go back in the hospital and they'll let them do anything they want to make.
I'm glad you're so well.
Thank you.
Or put her in there instead.
Well, that show was really something to see.
No, I'll see you later.
Thank you.
Okay.
Well, we got that straightened out.
Okay, for the punk who survived my sign, I had birthed.
Okay?
Mr. Hot Scott.
Mr. Expert.
Mr. Rocket Scientist.
WIOD.
WIOD.
Yeah, it's so cool, man.
WIOD.
Hey, how you doing?
Okay.
Well, you know what I want to do with the symposium.
WIOD.
Bring back the lightning round, man.
WIOD.
Hello, here are you.
Okay.
Good.
You know that's that gold blood operation?
Yeah.
You know, it's the second most frequent forms of surgery.
Yeah.
And I think, by the way, I forgot to mention the CBS, the eye on the news, whatever they're
calling that thing on CBS news.
I think it's the night they're having a feature on that.
Oh, really?
Because all these people are...
It's in a mail.
All these people in hospital.
Huh?
I get this news tape from Portland in hospital.
No, but seriously, people are bleeding to that stomach because there are surgeons performing
who are like beginners and are like experimenting on patients and they don't know how to do it yet.
Oh, no.
And they're having all kinds of exciting little things.
Yeah, it takes 6.6 days, hospital's day.
How long did you say?
6.6 days.
Yeah, this is sad.
I was there for about five days.
Oh, you worried about that?
I was expecting you to be over night for one day.
That's the big sales pitch.
Oh, yeah.
You come in for one night, rest up, and you go home the next day.
Yeah, there you go.
No, I'm listening.
I'm calling in six from your work from last Saturday until I'm sorry.
Your doose bag and Kevin, your bed wet and fancy.
Okay.
Good idea.
Okay, so I'm going to go to the next day.
What about these strange sounds we got there?
Those are the little farting sounds on the phone.
Well, anyway, we got that one call in the mobile.
It certainly made my entire day.
And now that I'm between that and getting my paycheck, I feel it was like a redeeming thing
even to come in here today.
Because certainly there are a lot of other people who didn't bother to.
This is like a ghost town in here.
It's like a skeleton crew.
It's like a...
It's just a certain...
I was just saying a certain atmosphere in here, but it's like a lack of atmosphere in this place.
Like there's just nothing going on.
Like we're just day walking.
I don't know how to describe it.
Like we're just going through the motions of life.
Like we're faking our way through.
Like we're on some horrendous drugtrip.
Like somebody has released all kinds of hallucinogenic drugs throughout the ventilation system.
Anyway, speaking of that, breathe deep now.
