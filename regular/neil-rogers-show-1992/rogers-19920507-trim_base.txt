Hello Tommy here's a couple like country and western
and he just was going nuts you couldn't control himself.
We have an open line in Broward 524 WIOD
and what in Palm Beach that's ringing as we speak WIOD the Palm Beach line.
Yeah yeah. What's going on? How you doing?
Man, you either. I just saw it ringing and George was in there checking out
Manny's butt. I cannot believe that.
What's up? What are you doing?
Nothing I was just calling to get out. What's going on?
Now listen for a while.
Come to get on hold.
Well I want to check out if I want to listen to you for a few minutes
before I go on the air you kind of start with me.
Why is that?
Have you want to go back on hold?
I have nothing to say I have no material.
Well thanks up to that I'm holding on.
Okay we have an open line in Broward.
Now that's interesting as we continue delving into the psychology of
goofballs that call talk shows on the radio.
I bet you there are a lot of people like that they just call it any get on hold
and try desperately to think of something.
Most of them obviously fail as you hear every day.
Am I right sir?
Pretty much.
Okay hold on.
Here's a mobile in Miami on our star line.
Line lurking in a watch out for Graveline Alex. Look out.
Okay your time is up sir.
My time is up.
It's time for you to stop thinking and start talking.
Okay last year I saw the braves in the cup twice in Atlanta.
Yes sir.
Hold the count of the house on the school up there.
And the first time it was the first time I ever went to a professional game
and I'm sitting in line with my girlfriend to get tickets.
Wait a minute.
Wait what is that?
What is this?
For who?
Who is that?
I got to sign a picture here for Dave Graveline while I'm trying to do a show.
And the hell with Dave Graveline.
Exactly.
Oh Manny and the Dave are doing something in the studio now.
Okay go ahead sir.
Anyway we are.
All right listen keep your pants on Manny.
Go ahead.
What's going on over there?
Yeah that's what I'm beginning to wonder.
Anyway we got great seats.
Some guy had an extra set of tickets and there's wife.
No guns allowed in a studio.
Put that six shooter away Manny.
Doug out seats now.
A bravesie cubs dug out.
First time ever.
Yeah the hawk hits two home runs.
Rhino hits one.
Yeah they beat a 15 to two.
Oh I remember that game very vividly.
It was classic.
It was my first game ever.
Yes sir I loved it.
Okay.
Yup.
Is that it?
Basically.
Okay.
All right now.
It was not too good.
Not too bad.
Yeah.
Yup.
I love you.
See you.
1242 at WIOD.
Palm Beach we have an open line.
655 9463 655 WIOD.
Graveline just pulled up his pant leg and during the break
for Manny to tell you what he has in there.
Let's go to a poppinow.
Hello.
Hill.
Yes sir.
I love you too.
Yeah.
I'm booked.
Is that it?
That's it.
Boy it's really something to have this many dates lined up.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm okay.
Okay.
I have a question.
Mm-hmm.
I'm from Detroit and I'm a major tiger fan.
And my boss unfortunately is a major red-sex fan.
And we have this running argument over which stadium is better.
And so we figured you can out the doubt.
You know there's no such thing as which stadium is better
both stadiums are great.
They're both a fairly smaller and it's um
you know got the green monster all that.
What's that echo coming from?
Hold on a second.
Okay.
Let's see when you're rid of that echo.
Is that better?
Yeah that's better.
No it's back.
Must be on your phone.
Must be.
Well anyway and the tiger stadium is great
because there's not a bad seat in the house.
It's uh the foul lines are very close to the field
and uh I used to go there a lot.
So they're both great.
Okay.
But they're both that's a lot of help.
But the mom knows.
There's no winning the argument.
There's not one of those arguments you can win.
It's like saying which color is better red or green.
I mean it's you know matter of taste.
It's addictive.
Well you know business always take on this right
and I always have to stand up for them you know.
Well tiger stadium if I was going to pick a ballpark
that's better in terms of being fair
the dimensions are better.
I mean the green monster in Fenway
makes it kind of a freaky ballpark.
So if you want to win the argument that way.
That was great.
Yeah.
He just puts you off in the radio.
Good.
Screw him.
Let's go back to bean town.
Well great.
Thanks a lot Neil.
Tell him he's a mass hole.
I definitely do that.
Okay.
And by the way I love you too.
See you.
Bye.
Okay.
Boy.
1244 George only wishes he had this many adoring people
out there just falling at his shoes.
Unfortunately they're not on.
Two open lines are both inbrowered 524 WIOD.
Got a thank you going on in the building here today.
Here's a mobile and four-letter.
Telegram from wherever.
In fact the telegram comes from New York but he's here.
So evidently a secretary sent the telegram.
Dear Neil I'm in Florida listening to your show as usual
and love it lost 59 pounds 50 more to go.
Would love to show off at the studio.
Give me a buzz et cetera and so on.
Whether it is Florida number.
Al we love you.
But don't hold your breath.
It's 11 past 10 at WIOD.
Also got a little more information yesterday.
The guy called I felt bad about yesterday because he was serious
wanting to know when we're going to do our trip in Chicago.
That we do every summer.
I don't know.
I really don't.
I'm not trying to give the guy a hard time.
I know nothing.
Because I work at 610 WIOD where a lot of energy is put
generally into the wrong areas.
So Cheryl I'm on the all I talk to Hank yesterday by the way.
Hank tells me that the scoop is out from the national
and others the Denver and Miami are going to get to major league baseball teams.
And if we don't by the way we can pick up Houston for 100 million no problem at all.
The sisters can buy the team then we can carry the games right.
And get off these horrible awful talk shows where we have to sit here and beg for people to call.
Hank and I can go out and he can buy the beer and I can do the baseball games.
But anyway Cheryl trapped me in the hallway out there yesterday at about 215
to tell me that the trip from to Chicago is on.
It will happen but it's still in the works.
And that a lot of us are praying that we can go and we want to.
Now I hope Mike DeCello from Midway Airlines is in town.
I was driving out here one day a couple of weeks ago.
I'm my way home and he was out there also just happened to be passing me on the 79th
Street Causeway waving and doing his usual little mousey thing he was doing.
You're a good guy Mike but we want to go to Chicago when it's convenient for us
and when we when we would like to go now when you would like to be there in shoes around us.
Okay.
We like seeing you once in a great while but basically we don't go to Chicago to see Mike DeCello.
Is that is that a bad way to put it without hurt his feelings?
We don't really care.
Because we want to go when it's convenient for us.
You know what I'm saying Mike?
So let's hurry up and get the thing put together and cut the crap.
Anyway it's 12 minutes past 10 at WIOD.
We've already got some calls on the board there this morning.
It'll be interesting to see if it's going to be like a regular Tuesday.
And what the hell is this obsession with Tanya Cruz man?
Did you hear that?
Somebody left me in my box the tape from yesterday's a Rick and Sud show.
Who is that?
Who is that?
Why don't you Cruz?
Wow.
Tanya Cruz is here.
Wow.
Tanya Cruz.
Go ahead, say that.
Tanya Cruz.
Oh, yeah.
You popped the RR right there.
What I'm making long story short turned out it wasn't Tanya Cruz because Tanya Cruz
happens to be black and this is some white chick that wandered in the door
putting on some kind of an imposter thing.
Well she's supposed to be one of those babes that they sent for your birthday.
You know one of those things they do because evidently she kept her clothes on
and they kicked her ass out when she found out it wasn't Tanya Cruz or Sky 3 or Sky King.
There's trouble in Japan.

At W.I.D. Mr. George tells me that Rick Sanchez was on with Bill Tanner this morning on mixed-up power 96.
Is he doing a radio show now?
Music show or a talk show?
He is definitely beyond a shadow without a frustrated talk host.
Maybe Bill Tanner is going to wind up like on right after B-Dell over there on the light bulb.
We found the losers because he desperately wants to do a talk show.
He don't want to do music.
He doesn't want to play all that filthy punky stuff.
Well you know what we didn't do yesterday at all?
Because I put it away and I can't find it.
Oh geez.
It's a good thing I started thinking about power 96 because that's what always makes you think about
dirty music immediately.
Okay, we'll just keep that handy.
Okay, let's give those numbers out and see what goes on.
Little TV history will be made at Rigglyfield Monday night next Monday the 13th when three generations

Miami.
Good morning Neil.
Yes sir.
Do you know Harry is very personally?
Do I know him personally?
Yes.
Does he know you?
Yes.
So does he know that you do these bits and all that huh?
Yeah.
Has he ever heard them?
I don't know.
Okay, last night on the news channel 70.
Well, is there some significance to that?
Well, you know, the guys about ready to croak.
I didn't know whether you had to pay.
Not about ready to croak.
He's 170 years old, sir.
Well, you know, doesn't look a day over 90.
Uh, last night Jim Barry spoke to Jerry A's.
Are you heard about that right?
No, sir.
Uh, you know what?
Well, I can't watch channel 7 news unless I'm really depressed.
Well, listen to this Neil.
Let me give you a news update update.
Jim Barry is going to be calling all five cities
for the next five days to speak with the local sportscaster
about, you know, the possibility of getting the team.
Last night he spoke to A's are at Pambufflo.
A's are comes on the news right away.
He says Miami's a lock in.
Don't even call anybody else.
Miami's got the team.
Well, he has a nose for sports.
I beg your pardon?
I said he has a nose for sports.
He has a nose for sports.
Yeah.
You got a lane at the late age drive.
There you go.
Neil, how much was your air trip to uh, your affair to Las Vegas?
Too much.
Because I just called an airline to find out what the round trip was to uh,
Atlanta from Miami.
Yeah.
You know, I could go to Brussels for what they're charging now to go to.
It was outrageous.
It was a scene.
It cost me more for the airfare than I lost in Vegas.
We did get Eastern back on back online.
There you go.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'd like to have you there.
Okay.
20 after 10 at WYOD.
All three deadlines are wide open and one just dropped off in
Broward, which means we got two calls on the board.
This is going to be just like yesterday, isn't it?
Well, I don't care.
It didn't make a bit of difference to me.
Did yesterday because I was really depressed about being back in town after Vegas.
Today, I'm like back online as he would say.
Then make a bit of difference to us.
Okay.
If you call fine, if you don't call, that's okay too.
If you're that vapid,
if you're that burrish,
if you're that boring,
if you're that anti-social,
let's talk about tanya cruise for four hours.
That seems to do it.
I think that's where we're missing out.
Don't you?
That's where we're missing out.
Yeah, you were.
It's a better fact.
We're going to be going probably for a long time.
Okay.
We'll give this one on tanya cruise.
On tanya cruise.
On tanya cruise.
Yeah.
That was a good one.
Oh, he's got the guy.
What?
This is not tanya cruise.
Who is this?
He's not tanya cruise.
Who is this?
So what's the deal here, Marvin?
Marvin, our producer, who's supposed to thoroughly clean everybody.
Oh, this is tanya cruise.
This is tanya cruise.
Well, it's tanya, Marvin, your our producer.
You have to have been an Iranian carrying a bomb.
How did you get that?
What's happening in town tanya cruise?
I have no idea what that's all about.
I've never seen her.
I bet you nobody in this audience has ever seen her either.
Okay.
I'm going to give the numbers one more time before the break.
751 WIOD.
All the data lines are wide open.
And one in brown is open.
524 WIOD.
Then during the break,
we'll decide whether to play the rack or come back.
Because today would be a good day to do it.
Be kind of like a little reward to our listing audience.
So they don't have to put up with these idiotic collars.
And when you're right, then you always second guess me.
Oh, what a mess down.
You call my hand before I even get my back down.
And when I always on the main,
you seem to get a bad way.
Oh, and you know the press me.
Oh, why am I in love with you?
When a kid shows,
he never thought,
he forced me on soul with your bitch.
When you're in love with your bitch,
when there's trouble,
I can count on you to leave me on the side of the road.
Because when I see you,
I fall in love with you.
So why am I in love?
Come with with us,

Okay
Okay, thanks so much
Hi
See what I mean, the town is dried up folks, it's history
They got nothing left to say they've said that's the problem
But you got people like Tanner on Power Do and Talk shows in the morning
There's only so much that people are got to say and they've said it
In fact, they've said it many, many times
Have you noticed that?
Many, many times over and over
Ponderous
Really Ponderous
This is the clicking line, listen, hello

Now I was noticing and this is not a shot of Rick and Suds
Because like I said, the twang are in the middle of the space shuttle landing
Was the greatest moment in the history of radio
Although the tiny cruise thing is getting a little ponderous
But I've noticed that they're kind of reverting the collars on Rick and Suds
Also to a butt like remember a year ago June were you here then?
No, you weren't here were you?
You were
When airvie call was like butt load back at you remember that?
And I said hey wait a minute this is you know a little fun
But it's there's got to be a little something more than that with these collars
And now it's like a double back flip up your nose butt loads
And it seems like it's basically that am I right?
Isn't that what like most of the collars got to say and that's about it?
Triple cherry fudge Hawaiian pancake butt load back at you
See ya
And that's what our audience is kind of like degenerated I mean it's just nothing left
They have nothing left to say
It's like anything else I mean it's like in a restaurant if they don't keep resupplying
Sooner or later they run out of food
Underwear
Sooner or later they all get like crusty you don't go out and get new ones
They all run out of you can't use them anymore unless you want to start slipping those mal-oderous musty
Flatiss events like the one on the plane I talked about yesterday
But seriously the audience in this town of course there's nobody here anyway
Even coming on 79th Street again today I noticed very did you have any encounter much traffic?
Nothing you could just fly through there about 90
So let's go out to sky one now at Miami International and check out United flight number 402
