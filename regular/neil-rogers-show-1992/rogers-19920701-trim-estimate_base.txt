Do we know how to get to that new audience or what?
1106 and WIOD. Broward, look at that. Broward is like in a coma.
The whole rest of the state is like flagellating and man there's squeezing it and jumping on it and Broward is like,

talking to me. That's what you were talking to me. That's what you were talking to me. Time like poisoning is going to tell you stories that will make you never listen to that station again. Anyway
Federal eh. Exactly Federal eh. I think there's so many people who need the weapons out there and you know that well they told people who need the weapons out there's so many people need the weapons out there's just 12 players.
Those twofreirors that I thought weren't any defensive guys or people driven by them. On their phones I thought I thought they were never going to be switched off, I was annoying.
but because frequently you know when you call new i just a home you get things
like
but because you are a pain in the ass that now this man i want to tell you something
bob was a radio
yenta is the best expression i can think of
and was just constantly i mean now i understand why having heard the stories
but just constantly calling and probing for information and what's going on
at q a m what's going on at uh... the light bulb what's going on
and just it just got to the point where uh... like you know in the eighth
sitting in the cub game with a base no i'm not
yes you are okay i made it up
west of my talk to you q a m with full
well i'm just i'm not
fill in the blank whatever the station might be okay
you were radio yenta you can fess up to what i think you i had to
uh...
oh you had my spin down but he wasn't taking your calls
he always took my call yeah he'll take anybody's calls believe me
so uh... anyway bob was in tamper with these gigantic numbers went to
the wl i think she called the last time i saw bob last it was art uh... one of
our trips it was two years ago
two summers ago at murphy's bleachers across from really field and bob came in
they opened up the pride open the door with a shoe horn
and got bob and i both in there which is quite an accomplishment and we
have chatted for a couple hours and now back in those days i thought you were
doing okay at all i thought you were happy
uh... no there was already hit severe trouble but you just didn't want to
say it because you need the job well i'm
you know it is now yes i do
when you're in a business you lie a lot
great deal i can just imagine i can imagine the reverberations over there on the
west coast all those old ladies who love bob last year
no no no i had young man i didn't have any old lady you had young men
well we'll probably talk about that when we come back
think up some good stories
all right hold on i don't go away you got a lot of time for us today right
as much as we have nothing but time and you already got people on their way
to talk to you
of course does open until they're going to say
all bob people you said to breath a fresh air to hear your voice you know
how these phony bastards are you know i really looking forward to it
hold on
okay twelve minutes after eleven of news talk radio six ten w i o d
eleven fifteen at w i o d that's her
you've got a near right
oh man bob yeah i'm on stole here
that was just an act of technical history on my part i punched the wrong
thing i put my finger in the wrong spot
anyway what was i about to say so let's go back to w ls in chicago where bob
was making all his big bucks and all the other big bucks and we allegedly and
making uh... uh... chicago stand on its rear and it was boring as crap right
but i don't like my show or i mean the station
what they were doing
i'm sorry what
there's anybody out there who wants to know why bob last year is no longer on
the year these first ten minutes to give you a great revelation you're
i'm saying like a guy who woke up one morning and lost the gift of gibb
but but but but yeah there
yeah there
but i don't like radio god what do you want
what
uh... i i i i talk to you want one hundred feet that i don't know i'm talking
to my radio god what it will take a call from panellist park ok this probably
is one of your big fan hello
a good morning yes sir a bob yeah good morning
it's now an often serity it's great to hear your voice
you left fla
dignorment died that station went to hell
and i can say it and now they're jay or broadcai i mean jay
or and uh... looks like they all be changing format again
why don't you come back to tampa bay bob
and then no one will hire me yeah sure they will
away from september that we plenty of openings at fla
or even maybe here at s u n there you go
and white white September at fla
i don't like a whole lot of them are after their after their chapter
seven eleven thirteen fourteen go through
with uh... there are their situation there
but it talk radio here in tampa
the was every all the listeners who were called can attest bob
has certainly gone down about uh... hundred fifty percent
since you left it's puke
i did it at the real bad
i have to eat some of you i have i still bring out the tapes of yours once in a
while with you in the old guy in the trail park and
this are a strange and then in the other guy
religious guy used to call you on fla all the time
jay cup and his wife with the i-bowl
and uh... it was a little is wonderful
but when you want to get a laugh remember what good talk radio was in this area
bring out once the law
and it's great talking to you and you sincerely are missed here in tampa bay
thank you so much sir have a great life
and the checks in the mail
okay
they love to meet the only love to be they did which i think says a lot about that
area so anyway wls uh... we kept going down the tubes and they have bush
being bang on in midday which so things speak for itself
like every other desperate station that can put on live local talent
like fla for example at once his tapes on tape delay no less
and post-funded s u n because they're bringing in stuff from out of the market
now are you serious yes
unreal that opi him he's like all well you know that syndicated stuff does
work in me while i got that the clown on the year on tape that fat right when
fascia's not see big well wait a second wait a second opi is a fine broadcaster
is a man of integrity of that report leader
you know prone to taking bubble
oh man i know there was a lot of that crap in on the ground in davenport
but you have must have been spent all your spare time shoveling it up
here's a lady in uh... clear water
our last year this is t day t j i you do it i'm just doing fun my god
it's so great to hear your voice i can't believe it i'm so excited
i think the least you can do is thank me for bringing bob on to that
i do thank you new you know i'm so excited i can't stand it
i don't understand what you're looking to know for i mean he doesn't do topics for
anything like that of you or he but i wish he would and that's why i'm just
dying to hear your topics again
it's so bad it is so bad that i can't
and it you know they can do actually ten hours
discussing the month of august and and you know what the uh...
the good things are about all good at the stupid things like that
absolutely disgusting on top of that it's so so so boring
i know the best thing about august is that most people go out of time vacation
they don't have to listen to the wf l
that's that's the whole thing but anyway
bob god we miss you
well i miss you too
please come back
get out the syrup all got it's getting so sweet and here i'm going to diabetics
calmer
anyway i'll tell you remember when you left town i remember this and i treasure this
because i was your very last caller i got on like the last minute before you left
June 26th three years ago
not that he's keeping track
three years ago i'll tell you it seems like ten
and you need to come back because
talk radio is not the same it is absolutely awful
and you were the best i'm sorry nia
i haven't listened to you long enough so i couldn't really tell
right you haven't listened long enough to hate me yet but you will in a couple of weeks
well that's alright i don't mind that but i just keep in mind that if a warrant for me
bob laceter would never have been on the year in tampa
would never have been on the year in chicago would never be sitting out there
desperate and suicidal in david port aowa
probably would have just gone on and had like a regular life
get all true
all he did mention your name quite often
right i'm not going to say what he said about you but he's
haha
anyway bob you know i just tuned in and where are you these days
i live in david port aowa it's been here since April 27th
are you on radio
no radio
no he's sitting on one during the call but he's not that's as close as he can get
oh my god you need to come back Bob please
well that's the purpose of our call to Bob today is to get a start a right in campaign
and wsu n where cox broadcasting pays the really big bucks
instead of those awful replays and the tapes and all out of the crap
let's have Bob on there about fifteen twenty hours a day
i'm going to call Danny remember Danny the doctor
i'm going to call him i'm going to let everyone know to tune in right this
minute do it do it we want everybody to call Bob while he's on here now to make
it feel that life is almost worth living
you're a mental you're a telephone number again because a lot of people don't
know it
and i had to search for it
well i've been searching for it for a long time
listen have a great day
thank you right say goodbye to Bob
bye Bob
oh no i'm not so big say goodbye
get lost god she a pin in the ass
but she was saying nice things about that's why she's a fan of you now listen
you don't want to have like a whole bunch of time here where people just call
and suck around do you
what's what you use to do all the time well that's the point
okay we have an open line i don't want people in fact i can't stand it
there's nothing more boring that's the worst thing with talk shows
is all these callers who want to ingratiate that i thought i taught you
that want to ingratiate themselves with a host
oh you're such a breath of fresh air
oh i agree with everything you said what the hell are you calling for
okay it's boring it is terminal man
okay Neil
uh... a lot of them okay
okay what am i going to do with him i keep trying to
jorge has control and i don't like that at all

i would have virtually no notice
whatsoever one had to go into your four hour shift at night
but you want to tell people why it is that uh... you didn't work there anymore

but anyway that's another story for another day
uh...

uh...
but uh... the station with six watts
yeah right with six watts per channel you dig

what is my favorite Bob?
we miss you down here and i'll tell you your Christmas story that you said
this used to do on the radio really touched me and uh... let's see you back on the air down here
like maybe we can do some sort of a reverse
simul cast with you over here on WS you went

when in doubt pump it out
that's it take it easy guys
thank you Bob see ya
Valrico don't let me forget to stick a pin in that George
eleven thirty three we have one of our
great dollars from Valrico
really where is that
somewhere around there
and you wonder why he left that area okay i know
but north uh... north
you're not fooling me you probably need to show remote from serosoters somewhere
here's uh... my amy beach for bob
yeah bob yeah
uh... my name is Kurt
i'm originally from Columbus Ohio
uh... have you ever been around that area?
not for a long time about thirty years but uh... when i was a young lad
yes i passed through Columbus
uh... because i used to hear voice
uh... this sounded much like yours and he always said uh... yeah boy
you know like in that sweet that
that was bob that was last year
that was the last time
i've never worked at a lot of
listen there are a lot of markets where bob never worked but that sound that uh...
you got it there it is
it just emnates from radios from transmitters from coast to coast
all right i was just curious about that
okay all right thanks have a great life are you to see it
boy open line in a starline if you have bell-soft mobility at star i od
he hears of saint tweed
now i know how you do it
i want to say how to bob
how you doing good uh...
are you considered coming back to this area?
i like considered it we thought about uh... when when things blew up in chicago
we did consider moving back to tapah and uh... i still made one of these days i enjoyed it
well nilshows good no but you know they need some
no wait a minute don't now listen don't suck around that heavily sir
don't use my show to say nilshows good but
if you're the grinders but don't do that because even he don't pull him up
that though on issue and they need one they do need a very good host on issue and
what does that mean
they think they need a very good host over and over and over and over and over and over
well no there's no question about that but you think that those cheap bastards
that cocks are going to spend money to bring in a like a live person if you knew how much
they're paying us to carry in fact i should have told bob this last night which he
would just puke all over himself next to nothing i couldn't buy my dogs dog food
with him i were giving them this for practically for free because they're basically
incompetent inept at a bunch of geeks
well they would if they put bob on there they'd see their ratings shoot up but they'd have a 50 share
if they put his fat ass on that state tonight and if they put the rest of my money having 80 share
the best of night i gotta go back to work nights
six to ten oh the best one i ever saw was bob did a live remote from the same
piece shuffleboard court oh my god yeah
and just after he got last year's Lincoln and he drove it over there
and uh he did his live remote from over there and the people wouldn't come out and talk to him
they just still here and look over at him and he was supposed to
they wouldn't let us on the proper yeah i had to go out and buy bullhorn
yeah and so there's this guy walking down the street and bob ran after this guy and took off
down the road and caught him down near the end of the road
he just kind of shrugged him off and kept going
out as the best live remote ever saw him alive
i totally forgot
it was the best one i ever saw well bob have a good one
take care have a great life you do okay
we uh we had called up the uh shuffleboard court in St. Petersburg and asked
if we'd come and do it remote they were really thrilled and they said yes and we put in phone lines
in a whole bit and then the day before they found out who i was
and they banned it from the property
you mean you were over there picking on the old farts
well yeah
where did you where did you learn that uh
where did i learn that
uh great wording
all right hold on now bob hold on right now
because i know you got a busy schedule but we're going to milk everything we can out of this
because when you see all the call that are pouring in from you here man it's going to like it's going to make you want to get on the first greyhound bus
1137 a news talk radio 610 W I O D
one i can ask you a stupid question George
is bob on
hello
how can he be on when you're in here sticking pins in your thing
what a geek he's standing this is the new thing George finally got turned out of the job
he likes sticking pins in it
he's looking for a sun city center and he's just a maniac you're there bob right
i'm here now standing through the miracle of modern
technology since your got his ass back into the control room and punched it up
uh we never got to the thing about so you got can in Chicago and WLS because uh
of what
uh i don't know
uh because i didn't fit in
you didn't fit in because you were a troublemaker and you wanted to do some real
whatever it was and they didn't like it because they don't want you to do anything
i didn't want to do anything anymore i just didn't fit in
didn't fit in okay and then
called uh... around in tampa had a desire to come back to the market where he was once king or prince or princess
and they said from jay core they said we'd love to have you back bob and uh
then you start talking money
well uh...
that was about a year and a half ago the last time i talked with them they suggested i get in touch with
uh wtk and it maybe for weekends yeah but when you talked money that was the end of the conversation right
uh... basically there a bankrupt inter-bunch of cheap bastards and forget it
well if you i think you i think you ought to talk to bob honey over wsu
when in talk money when you hear that dial tone on the other end of the phone real quick
well you'll be able to relate to it okay let's take that
i didn't ask for much of the all i was dying i was making fifty one cents a clock
you can say slime ball
how about having iod final cast sq1 was bob at night and go the other way
now you're talking yeah we have complete rundown i would take care of that because
it gives me an open after six o'clock at night the station sort of fade away
uh... uh... yeah right
so what do you think is just like for real if people start rattling cages are you serious
and it's hard to tell if you're going to weigh your kid in a way or not
or you're probably very relaxed out there right now with
good reed
rattle cages are wild because you're talking to the state of Florida right now i guess
nil told you between iod and sq1 they've taken over the world
well i'll be real quick what it's doing friend
i'll be really honest with you i have no particular great interest in going back
into talk if i can survive outside of it uh... this last night when pop called me at
home it was one of the most rational conversations i have ever had with
anybody in the business in my life he said i if i never do talk radio again
i'll be the happiest man on the face of the earth
i miss the money i miss the money but don't miss the uh... doesn't miss coming
in and talking to geeks and it's like when i talk you know i play uh... the
canadian lottery all the time i sent away about seven eight hundred bucks a year
and i get part of it back every year and every sunday morning i just
lither and bed waiting for the phone to ring from van cuver with the exciting news
okay i wouldn't be i used to say i'd come in and do one last show i wouldn't
even do that

bell-sock ability star i would be we're talking to the world famous bob
laceter who is a uh... voice in the wilderness here in soft lorraine and was
like a major monster star in tapas saying peat for two years on w f l a when the
station was good four years two years let me say it again for four years it seemed
like only two because it went by so fast for bob but for four years on w f l a
with enormous no no two years on w f l a in four years in uh... w l s

take the gig at uh... at lock is that offered me twelve grand a year let me say it
again you see if i wouldn't have to not that i want to take credit because i
was get blamed for other people's failures like the putrid joey rennelsers

the people's failures nobody ever gets gives me credit for putting them on the
map and if you hadn't taken my advice and been on uh...

boring me okay well listen have a great life that's that now relax that's
that kid that calls in every day six hundred times and you're getting emotional
about him he's a cranking you're getting emotional about
i've started my career at gps that guy that would call up in the middle of
guests and that kind of stuff and you talk with an indian accent and then he
starts to say you're boring i just i learned
and they wonder why you don't see what really cracks me up is because i knew this
is what was going to happen you know all by we're gonna take up a petition drive

hoping to make a few bucks and doesn't want to stress in the pressure in the grief

response to a pop

in other words he doesn't give a flying crap is what he's trying to say in a
very nice polite way sir that might be why you're not working

we'll have one more hours Bob Lassiter which quite frankly we almost never have guests on his show
but it's like it's like a breath of fresh air isn't it or it's like just a big deep gigantic breath
yeah right okay don't forget Rick and suds this afternoon who are doing in the wake of yesterday's
incredible first out of town pay phone challenge are doing uh some crap today

brown again brown it is like stinko this week you know to say they're all out of town five two four
nine four six three either that or Lassiter scared him away we're talking to the once very famous
Bob Lassiter who's now like shrinking into oblivion in davenport iowel but came back to a be uh
coddled by his fans to be lured and uh cajold and tinkled on right Bob do two open lines

was giving kneel and bird hell i believe and he was talking about nasty things in the in-your-end
of going on between kneeling the birds really yes i wanted bob bob knows i have much better
taste than that believe me but i just wanted i just wanted to confront i wanted to confront bob
with it and see what he had to say about he probably doesn't remember who is the bird that's

i didn't call in but oh one of the free loaders yeah i'm a free loader what can i say you know i
was laid off from a job and i've been free loading even more times that it dropped my knees and
literally baked for calls i know i know bob you know i just tuned in about 20 minutes ago and heard

of southern sincere crap but but i mean isn't it possible to have just a little verbal dialogue
without all this with the sucking around this heavy i mean the suction is so great that the
inversion layer is going to came to god damn walls in here no way you're not telling

taking a shower alone you know what i'm saying we won't talk about that how about something

week out up in Chicago living my nephew and i i turned Bob on and i said to my girlfriend that

Bob last year there was another problem too though in Chicago the audience didn't know how to play
along the audience in Tampa did oh there's no fear the call from well wait a minute are you
saying to me that the audience in Chicago was stiffer than the audience in Tampa oh god much
stiffer the call by god i mean all of these people that were talking about no wonder there are so
many cup fans they're too stupid to be upset now i understand what it's all about but all of the
all of these colors that were talking about from the old days in Tampa these weren't my contrivances
these were just mere mortals who made up characters and called in and and didn't do it too often
and it was great believe i'm here that i'm not sure they didn't do it too often believe me the
way they sound i can i can buy that so we knew about us coming from we like to play along i
could print as a show walking on the state fair with a bullhorn and yet you knew don't well
was tongue in cheek but i used to have the people used to calm up and and would take Bob
there's a new don't know i'm taking notes on some of them i i got to get i get to get out on some of

hey bob what a voice you have well thank you nothing like it since you left camp or we have really
gone downhill i've always said anybody with a voice that deep it must really hurt to sit down
uh... i can remember having a real hard time dieting because of him everybody used to bring him
this wonderful food he's okay oh you gotta be kidding where did he steal that i don't know but they
brought it to him and then he'd describe it over the air yeah make your mouth water it was
terrible every time i be doing real good on a diet i had to go get a piece of cheesecake yeah

change all of the world
twelve twenty nine know at the crystal of the roots that's really good stuff happens
every night open line out of town if you want to talk to good old bob last year one eight
hundred nine four four four w i o d
and to and broward what happened all year old i know what it is they hit me like poison
because that's all you had to i in z on the weekend i'll never forget as long as i
live in it really pissed me off i think of all the things that have ever happened this could
have been one of the all-time worst
it was on a saturday and as usual i had those gigantic numbers but that didn't mean they
wanted to talk to me especially the old parts who hated me like poison already
that was when i was doing i think i was doing mid days already and i was doing week a saturday
ten to two and you were doing two to six
whatever the hell it was and i had gotten through four hours of unusually i mean really begging and
pleading and they didn't want to play the game and they didn't want to call and they were cantank
and bob goes in a little production studio and he carts up this stupid contrived thing
oh my god the sky is falling the sky is falling oh my god what are we going to do and it was on
cart okay it was on a tape and he went through this like 90 second monologue on a tape and he didn't
say anything oh my just a real negative depressing psychotic the sky is well and i i was in the studio
and he played this at the beginning of a show after cbs news and those lines exploded like
Jesus himself had come back and offered everybody something you know like good tea pahleva
i couldn't believe it it was so depressing and disgusting and of course airv voice was older than
the next all your soul right Bob things are really bad
well we were that guy that uh used to drive over from naples uh or john mcq
mcq you know i can agree i can assure you that that radio drifting degenerate who's the uh king
of the flea markets over there in four mires now do you know what he does he's on something he's
on some yahu station in four mires which by the way we're booming in there as we speak we've had
some calls from over there and i know he listens because he got no life he's the guy used to bring
his wife remember he used to drive in on a weekend bring his wife used to sleep in the trunk of his
car in a parking lot i mean talk about deadbeats and he's he is a trades out time on the some
brokers time with some crappy station in four mires and does this thing from the flea market every
weekend he tapes all these ridiculous oh we're over at yellow number sixty two now now what do you
guys do for living on here what are you selling oh this is real interesting oh don't look at
know something about the business john what you know about the business i could stick up your
button have room for the chinese army left over okay he never had trouble getting calls from
broder no he didn't because he used to put all the computer cranks on here that was his whole show

did you claim to have had here's a lady in saint p hi nia yes now first time car these show great
they show your you know to win and you're not insecure having them on the show
well bob is a tremendous threat to me well you might have you see you don't understand the
only time you'll talk to me or permits me on the show is when i'm down and out right like when
i had you on at work these bleachers when you were at wls in chicago when you were up there in
a big city making a big box about half of what i made me know at the post of the wimps and w
s r a who put them on as a guest yeah i hate bob this is rose rose how are you good now

is it all i hate bob i'd love to have you back i'm going to call ws you in to get some
dumb guys on rick and serve to something you know good and he'll reruns at night but just
just put it on i honestly don't think a call to the station is going to do it what would you
have to do is get your friends together from from the church after you go down to the card game
no no go down to my john and chain yourself to the door like i call i call that seven watt
station told me to put you on and that if you want too much money or something yeah

s la only runs rush for two hours i'm sorry one to four oh i've got a side conversation
on tape tape delay and they try to con their audience and believing that it's live
okay tape delay so there's no way you can call a guy on tape
unbelievable right even if he did take calls which he really does because he's just a big
gigantic right wing hermongering lookalike obnoxious Nazi pig no question about it he has a
propaganda sounding big not to mention ponderous and monotonous too okay we already know the homeless
suck and women and gays and blacks and everybody else and Jews everybody else sucks who isn't a wealthy
right wing obnoxious cow like him so once we heard it the first hundred times what else is there
to hear absolutely now he's gonna have a TV show you know laughter i really thought that you

p-a-system and they're in dial him up on the phone okay but buffy he's checking his schedule
right now he's checking his calendar to see if he's booked up or not next next weekend okay we'll
be there i think it would be great you know bob used to do that commute from my army to um to
Tampa back and forth yeah on the weekend i think what would be great is if like bob commutes and
lives in david port during the weekend then comes down like this weekend's on nia cnbc
that would be good what a nice drive it through the countryside that would be good for a share and
i'll get him down here next weekend because that's one it is and i bet you the sisters are such
big sports they'd even trade out the gas like a shell card or something it's a deal okay
neck with time i told you he don't want to ever do it again now now next Saturday uh
normal high class 67 over the crown sterling hotels you'd be there he'll be there okay okay all right

people who basically are sitting around the resting on air laurels and don't have much of a life
i got for me now are you yes bob yes Neil it was great have a great life will be in touch

going to pay you a lot i mean a lot of money who the hell needs this crap god and uh for those of
you who are not interested in bob or what we did for the last two hours and quite frankly are pretty
pissed off about it now you can call in and we'll like have a good time the last hour
