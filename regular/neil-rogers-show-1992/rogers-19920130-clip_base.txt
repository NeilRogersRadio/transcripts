Council Norman Kent and we'll go over the details to a certain extent but
we wanted to begin the program today by having me alone just to well actually
just check it and see how you're doing because I'm a little concerned I hope
you're feeling all right today given the circumstance. Yeah I feel fine I just
the only reason I'm not there today is because I got a but it's an interesting
thing if you ever been in jail Jeff. I have never been in jail but many people
have but it's an interesting thing in the DCT I they were kind of a light
night so I didn't get home by 4 this morning after bonding out but after
only about two hours late there was really no way to come in and we showed
the day. Well that's understandable and I wanted to again point out because this
this is going to be a strange show you think President Bush has the toughest
job in America today I probably have the toughest job in America but beyond
that could do it better though I probably could but I think what we need to
say is that the reason you're not on the air today has nothing to do with
anything legal or anything like that it simply is that you didn't get out as
you just mentioned to for a minute wouldn't be proper to have you come in
given the circumstances and try to do a show. Right and I also want to thank you
know we stay in and day out I give them really rough time and they deserve it
in a lot of ways and the smaller stuff but in terms of the bigger picture use
accordingly Shay I mean the people at Cox are just incredible confident land
is the an even boy jury and I'm fighting my tongue with the leading when I say
that but they've been just tremendous in support even they understand what it's
all about very well I think and I'll be back tomorrow. Why?
After that and after that I don't want this to sound small see or or taken the
wrong way but you will always have my personal and professional support in
this matter and I think that I speak for lots of people and sound
important this month. Well I appreciate it Chuck but pirate still so.
Oh baby I know you're talking around Chuck it's just we're gonna be bad this
year but I'm not giving up I'm not throwing in the balcony. All right anything
else you have to say? No I just wish you good luck because obviously it's
gonna be an exciting four hours and I just want to send a message to all those
people in the media who feel compelled like our friends next door to come up here
they're certainly welcome the acres is beautiful there's a nice call to
the second the end of my street I will not be entering the door my dogs will be
barking ferociously and hysterically but I do have two nights for a
vet out there and they photograph very well. Great thanks Neil thanks for
calling see you tomorrow. All right Neil Rogers here's the statement that
Mike Disney has read to the press if you've been listening to WIOD news
through the morning you've heard this statement it's short but this is the
statement that's been released from Michael Disney last night Neil Rogers on
Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. talk show host on WIOD was arrested
charged with a first degree misdemeanor for in decent exposure. Neil Rogers has
denied all charges and is presently free on bond at this time the station has
no plans to suspend or terminate Neil however we will continue to monitor the
situation. Neil Rogers will not be on the air today but I might Disney hope that
he can return very soon. Neil Rogers has asked that we thank all of his loyal
listeners for their continued support as Neil just did. The further questions
ought to be directed to as attorney Norman Kim so that's the statement from
Michael Disney today. We do have a police report from the Miami Beach police
that I will be glad to read on the air today but I will do it slightly later in
the half hour because it's handwritten I have not read it verbatim yet and I
don't want to watch it up on the air so I will read it during a break and we will
read word for word our police report from Miami Beach over time. This will
be needless to say very interesting day at WIOD there are a lot of people there's
no question there's a lot of people in South Florida today who feel well. What
goes around comes around and for the guy who's always taken shots at other
people and their shortcomings and their poibles and their problems with the
police that it's only right and it's only justice that it happened to
Neil Rogers and that's I guess fine if you want to call today and talk about
that and say that we're gonna let you say I think that you know we all again
have to be within the bounds of the decor I'm here I don't want to be setting a new
record for the dump but it's right frankly but people will want to say that and
Neil's a public guy and he's used to that sort of thing and he's gotten more
heat calls and he mailed any one of us will ever have in our lifetime so I'm sure
he's some hip enough savvy enough and thick skinned enough to be able to
handle that sort of thing on the other hand and I don't say this simply
because I'm sitting here today I do not say this because I happen to work for
WIOD I'm not shilling for anybody today in saying that the last time I check
this was still is the United States of America and that you are innocent
until proven guilty that the crime that Neil has been accused of here is a
misdemeanor nothing polonious and Neil has again denied the charges and feels
that he will be fully vindicated this is one of those very touchy times when
you've got a situation where someone has been accused of something and it takes
a while for the process of courts and for the whole issue to be aired and Neil
will be under the gun and under the scope here for a while until he is allowed
to say what he has to say so let's remember that we're all innocent until proven guilty
I think that we try to practice that and let's try to remember today if you
would like to call with your support for Neil or your thoughts about this whole
larger issue that I think we can get into on this program today
Dr. Osar Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. talk show host on WIOD was arrested
and charged with a first degree misdemeanor for indecent exposure Neil Rogers
has denied all charges and is presently pre on bond at this time the station has
no plans to suspend or terminate Neil Rogers however we will continue to
monitor the situation Neil Rogers will not be on the air today but I hope he can
return very soon Neil has asked that we thank all his loyal listeners for their
continued support any further question should be directed to his attorney Norman
Kent

WIOD personality Neil Rogers was arrested last night after allegedly
exposing himself and an adult movie theater of Miami Beach WIOD's Robert Pencal reports
Officials say that Neil Rogers was arrested at the GAD theater after two
detectives saw him sitting on a back row bench exposing himself while
watching a heterosexual movie Miami Beach police spokesman Tom Hula-Hans as
Rogers was arrested outside the theater as he attempted to leave
it will transpired very quickly as he left his sat down the subject then
recognized his predicament apparently I tried to cover himself up and he
got out of the theater the officers followed him and where it was most logical
to stop him is where they identified themselves Hula-Hans as the arrest was
part of a routine patrol effort in that area Robert Pencal Newstalk Radio 610
WIOD nails arrest as creative speculation whether he'll remain on the air
WIOD general manager Mike Disney says he has no intention of suspending or
terminating Neil he adds that Neil Rogers commercial sponsors have been
calling showing their support for him we've had contact with many advertisers
so far this morning particularly advertisers that enjoy advertising in the
Neil Rogers program and we've had nothing but support in addition to numerous
phone calls from listeners that they're very upset about it and hoped at the
radio station and the company stand behind it and we do Disney says Neil will
return to his regular times lot tomorrow morning Chuck Meyer as you obviously
know is hosting Neil's program this morning and Chuck talk with Neil at the top
of the show yeah I feel I want to I want to say something I want to say
something and this is again a personal observation this morning I'm aware that
Norman Kent is off in Neil's attorney and I'm aware he does a talk show on
another station and I tuned in Norman thinking he might be on the air turns
out he's been ill for a few days and has been off well I'm circling the
Mr. Kane was on another station today is very first call as I'm driving is not
other than Rick Sanchez and I want to say something a public to publicly to
Rick and I've had him on this program recently and I purposely did not talk
about his drunk driving hassle because again I thought that had been hashed
over a million times I wanted to talk to him about other things but there I
must say and I don't think I'm being unfair to Rick Sanchez by paraphrasing what
he said in the way he said it was certainly in what he said today about
Neil because he felt that Neil had never given him a fair shake and that he had
insinuated in the community that somehow Neil never gave him a fair shake and
never gave him the benefit of innocence before guilt although I seem to
recall that Rick Sanchez copped the plea in his drunk driving case but beyond
that there was a certain sort of a self satisfaction that guys like Sanchez
and Kane are getting out of this today and I really wonder why well you know
what he caused what the bigger point is is if you're a public figure you could
be publicly targeted and and it's going to it could ruin a career and these guys
should know that more than anybody else so why rebel in the guy's current
problem for any other reason than what I know was which was ratings and
titillation and more talk because that particular station never has a
format unless they talk about Neil or this station which is pretty weak and
to have a guy like Sanchez on and Rick can come on over here and explain
himself the day if he wants to but Rick Sanchez getting on the air at another
radio station today going kiss, kiss, kiss about Neil Rogers was low and I felt
it I could feel it right through the radio it was low and it and I told Rick
Sanchez when he was on this program a few months ago that I really felt that
when he copped his plea it admitted what he did with his drunk driving case we
grew up a bit why take that back I don't think Rick's grown up at all well I
thought it was low one more point Chuck I'll let you go I think Neil be around a
lot longer this
