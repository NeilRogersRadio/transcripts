This is just to find your fate
It's a lie, I am not a Nazi
I just want my fate for slightly ill
And I hope it doesn't matter
My new girlfriend, her standards will be
With the head under her eyes
I thought of all the faiths that we've been through
And how I had guessed and she did too
I just tried her achievements
She could have the eye to know
And create a space between us
That could spend it and do
Maybe they'd been trying to decide
Because she farch doesn't matter
And my knees can't leave me
And my eyes start to wander
And I think it's about forgiveness
forgiveness
forgiveness
With every will
She keeps going and going
They're all waiting your life
Who will deny that they ever are farch?
You know they've got so much time
Well, then look you in the eye
Maybe I'll say you're wrong
Then the front of those bad sheets
I'll drop you a phone
Baby, I'm trying to decide
If she farch doesn't matter
When her back side comes
And the front stock is going to make you bad
forgiveness
forgiveness
Even if she gets bloody
Come on, baby
She's calling
Welcome to Space the Nation
153 at WIWD
We're having a little pseudo intellectual conversation
Over some rice and crap
Rice and bean
So how do you get your thing?
Don't talk because they get upset
When you're on the show
But did you get your thing straight
Not with your tent?
Okay, let's go to A
Ha ha ha ha ha
Pick me port in Hollywood wrong question
Hello
Hi there, how are you doing?
Okay
Glad to listen to you there
Today you make my day
Well, thank you so much sir
Pick report on the turnpike
Northbound
Your plane is up
Are you cereal?
Oh yeah
Well, that's good for me
Because I'm on my way right now
Okay, they're on the air
Right there
Just before the Hollywood exit
They're right in 64 miles an hour now
I'm going to put on my governor right on my thing
You need to go to their pumpkin
I'm going to stick him right on my hood
And go up to about 180
Of course, they're on the highway patrol cars
Anywhere else in the turnpike in front of our county
So if you break down you wait
But they were getting their feeding friends
Well, they're busy
Now they've got to get it all in
Before that thing goes into effect
It's not the truth
Thank you sir
They don't have a good day
Thank very much
See, that's the thing that Bill did
You hear that the other day
That he signed it in law
But all the stuff that passes now
Doesn't go in until he used to be October 1st
But I think now it's July 1st or sometime in July
So now they've got to make up for what time they're going to lose in the future
So they're going crazy
A homestead
Hey Neil, how you doing buddy?
Okay, Pally
I have one question, Neil
Yeah
Please tell me is it too early to say Sammy Smith sucks
Um, oh geez
Not always yet too early
But where the hell is that one where it says the Sammy still sucks
Where is that thing?
I'll find it for you sir
Just to make sure
Okay
And we know it without the instant replay
I appreciate it
Okay, have a great day
No, I was thinking about that this morning
I get this frightening feeling that I'm psychic
Because I had a dream this morning that I went to Vegas
And I didn't win two million dollars
And I think that's probably the right one
Um, where is the thing?
I can't find anything
Roger probably screws with all my cards
And he comes in
Oh, you got a crappy filing system
Uh, don't we have one?
That's a Sammy still sucks
Huh?
Well, we have this
Which uh,
Sammy sucks
Oh, yeah
But then we have the uh,
Sequel to that which I'll find eventually
Okay, here's Cooper City
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Pretty good
Listen, you hear about the Mu uh,
Cubs ticket thing
The ticket thing
Yeah, they got two programs
You buy one, you get one free
And if you buy two, you get the pitch that day
Yeah
Exactly, you're right
Listen, I found a new founder's spec for you
I got news for it's not a laughing matter
So there's a lot of truth in what you say
Oh, it's true, but listen, I found new founder's spec for you
Okay
Yes, when you actually went on the air and said that
98% of your people don't care about the harness track
And I think it took a lot of guts to admit that
Why is that?
Because you're always talking about it
No, see one thing I learned a long time ago
Is that if you go on the air
Like certain people in this business
I'm not going to mention names
Only care about like baseball cards
Okay
Including one who's a good friend of mine in my attorney
The audience out there
Can you imagine
Stop and think about this
Can you imagine what percentage of the public
Is interested in baseball cards
And then of that percent
Can you imagine how many might be listening to you at a given time
So you're talking about like a room at the holiday in
Like 50 people, okay
Out of potentially millions of people out there
You can't just draw on and on and on
About the things that only your interest is in
Or you're you're dead meat
And so if I just said here in time
I mean I could talk about racing all day
Because I love it, I love the track
But I try to keep it to a minimum
Because most people out there don't care about it
Listen, this morning you hit on something
When you put those two people together on the phone
Yeah
Next time and drag that a little bit
Just stick all the lines on one at one time
And let them all talk to each other
Exactly, the servant
There you go
Have a great life
Have a good ride
Oh, okay
Bye
Have a good ride home
Well, that sounded ominous
157 at WIOD
In fact, I have to take my vet into the up to Ed Morris
Not because there's any problem
I love my vet
God, I love the car is so phenomenal
But GM called me a few days ago
And they have like a little recall thing
Where they're like about a half
It doesn't
Little minor teeny things that they're changing
And so he's got all the parts
And they do it
And then they give you a car to drive for a day
And all that other stuff
Um, like the engine and uh
No, no, sir
I don't know what they are
Little minor
Don't go knocking my
And you know the interesting
phenomenon that I've noticed
Uh, no, seriously
The thing I noticed that's happens on your show now
All these punks that call in about the new Mazda
And it's
It's always comparing to the vet
So we're actually
Forgetting about the porses now
And all these other crappy cars
Finally, at least they're coming into the real world
And they're starting to compare
The new standard is
Has compared to the 92 vet
And you're finally getting it right
Because the 92 vet is the best damn
Car it's been made in a long time
Okay, and I'm sure that new Mazda
You're talking about is going to be a beautiful car
And but 31 grand
35 you can get a vet
And I got news for you
A vet is a much more stylish car
I don't care what anybody says
I know I don't agree with you at all
I didn't get that vet
Because I wanted to be the only one on the road
I got it because I liked it
But I did see two others that color I'm painting it
I still like I don't care what any of you say
I still like that pimple be over the yellow
And the uh pink it
I like it man, I love it
And I'm going to tell you he was
For about how much 10 grand
No for about 45 hundred
Really?
That like that?
Woo!
45 hundred big ones man
Let's see if my check will cover that
Huh?
Oh yeah, that covers it in then some
What?
You don't want to know how much I make that
That's
That's tacky as hell
I've worked long hard years to suck this kind of money out of these ass
All out of these nice people here
And I'm going to uh drain air and especially for this extra half hour
That I'm doing public service on the micro-neurysure
See I didn't realize that was also part of the deal in court
You don't know that
Not only do I do
No, I do fundraisers for the Camilla's house
I also do 30 minutes a day for the inframed radio broadcasters
Who can't handle it anymore, okay?
So I do like 30 minutes a day for the aged micro-neurieal
All right, because he can't keep it up from 9 to 10
He's having enough trouble from 9 15 to 9 30 with the mystery record in there man
Oh god and the show too
Well, listen have a great day and that's oh god
I feel so all of a sudden I feel I have a great day at the stadium have a great wedding
Congratulations
I wish you and your lovely bride the best
I hope your tent gets straightened out. I hope you get your political
I hope I hope she works on your politics because she seems like a really hip with it and not too much like a bra
I'm sorry

Tam's called what the young
the young behind the foolish be
happy and be still my sweet to
think and the Tam's also had a
hit what kind of fool do you think

Bill Deel and the Randells had
the big hit on what kind of fool
do you think I am that amazing
that just happens to be in a
wrap that's the one thing this
is under the Tam's in the book
but that's enough 1027 at W.I.O.D.
Miramar Hey Neil I got a problem
with your reporting on the
traffic ticket recordings there
by reporting on the traffic
as you do it the ticket clinic
whatever it is yeah I had two
speed tickets one in the 87188 and
I'll my certified copy of the state
of my driving record last seven
years I have no entries within the
past seven years now I checked on
this and they said the only ones
that we stay on your driving record
we rather than whether points are
accessed or not are DUI charge of
actions and attentional reckless
driving other than those three
anything else can be erased by
going traffic school I don't
believe it I'm telling I'm holding
my record right in my hand while
you may it may be on your right
you may have it in your hand in your
record too but I'm telling you that
I've talked to a lot of people
they all tell me the same thing
well then why would everybody
in the hot it must have just changed
and because I'm looking at the
copy of my ticket I got two
speed tickets one in 87188 and I'm
my last seven years my my
certified copy I think it real
quiet I got zero okay no I already
checked on this and they told me
the only ones judge even if a judge
gives you fine over points yeah
on like I said it charged
black and DUI and attentional
reckless driving those are the
only three things to stay on your
record for three years even with
without point they get to the
bottom of this here we're going to
get the Perry Mason out to check
it out for us all the traffic
probably inside come off with school
okay running stop signs speeding
with no more than 15 over just
people in blah blah like that
okay I said we'll check it out
thank you there okay bye you

little more exciting to me hey how's your
fluby Paul anyway it's a 25 to 11 at
610 W I O it's in a two-mid state
huh like Arizona I need out Alex
has handed me a phone message that came
in this morning I guess from Bob I'm
not going to mention the name I've
continental cable how about that I was
and I'm glad you brought me the message
because I forgot to mention that yesterday
again I did not receive a phone call a
letter a message a note under my door
or a skull and crossbones or anything
else from continental cable how about that
pretty interesting let's do Miami on a
starline hello Miami's gone on the
starline well that's their problem like
worth hey Neil how you doing okay
listen this uh MCC chairman L psychs
be stroking up by whatever private parts
you may have well don't say that especially
if they're turgent man don't even get into
that I don't think they could be turgent
I doubt it that in the Netherlands I think
that's the problem huh I just it's it's
driving me nuts the most ass and I the most
ridiculous the most outrageous bunch of
crap in other words instead of just
weeding out a lot of these licenses
of these marginal stations right and
just like closing them down and making
go darker to and something and because
they've just overdone it uh we're just
gonna let everybody else buy them up and
just have little monopolies everywhere
and the whole reason that pretty soon Ted
Turner's gonna own everything on cable
I'll guarantee you that you have like
700 stations on your cable and Ted
Turner all like 600 native exactly
and the justification for and the other
20 will be home shopping network the
justification for all this if you ask
them is because the the business is in
the dumper and it was this kind of
policy that put them in the dumper in
the first place right all this
deregulation during the 80s when they
right well the only thing you want to
regulate is if you say crap on here
that's all they want to regulate that's
right they don't have time to regulate
the business and because they're too
busy sitting listening to tapes
worrying if somebody said douchebag one
time too many on a year or if Howard
Stern said dickhead in New York they're
all bent out of shape about that
because they got to protect the morality
of the public and of little children
and everybody else the word police up
there are sitting worrying about what
the hell you said and I can't believe it
but I just saw ponytail walk
strut through the hallway there I can't
believe it well string his butt up to
guy at the same time and make a hell of
a quenella that's right from power number
three another priorities are completely
asked backwards and I have the capers
don't worry I think a business going to
like this though he would like he'd like
the in general manager of six radio
station oh great
Disney world yeah you got it
could be the Epcot center of radio just
stick him on space mountain man and

PD yeah there you go
the capital of obviously was really
going to make you Apple plastic at the
any of the convention in April next
month who are they going to honor who's
the keynote speaker who's the big
who probably I would think super
Dave no even worse Larry King
Ronald Wilson Reagan now fits right in
yeah the guy who killed him right the guy
who helped the gun to their head and
let them put the trigger themselves
that's right that's like Rick Riley
voting for Papu Cannon man because
he's a real liberal and wants freedom
and yeah that's Rick Riley
and oh man politically incorrect

kid which one the one that ran the car is all right how about his brother i mean he had a
feel sorry for that whole family we too what the whole family boy just totally dysfunctional
because of uh overbearing parents who wanted everybody to be perfect and live up to these
unrealistic standards just crazy it's not the way it is in the real world so much truth in that
movie but so much on target it rang a lot of bills for a lot of people i agree i thought it was
outstanding yeah why did that i call him say hello this morning well thank you so much for hanging
in there you're welcome yeah have a great day you too bye bye chilly peppers heat up a cure for runny
noses it says since it's going around everybody's got it oh and a quest to stop running noses
researchers have turned away spicy source red hot chili peppers the ingredient that
causes the peppers burning sensation a chemical called capsacin can desensitize nasal nerves
that cause running sneezing and congestion but just eating chili peppers won't do the trick
says alcus taagayas of Johns Hopkins as my analogy center the problem as he says you have to put
in the nose i'm playing with my nose exactly so that's a deal if you've got the crud like i do
and like everybody else seems to have it you're like all stuffed up and your nose is running and you
got the sinus crap get some of those red hot chili peppers man and stick them right up your nose
giving new meaning that old expression taken up the 945 and also by the way mic caters to one
the a thing on a micrity re show this morning mic hates you like poison and says you're a snore and
you keep winning all these prizes and you show up everywhere he goes and you're kind of like a
lizard bob and they just go away he can't stand you also a joe well mic don't have the balls to say
it so i'll do it for them dammit he can't stand that guy can't stand these freeloaders these snores
let's spread the goods around a little bit we got the driver showed on at pop it out tonight
kevin walice and Bruce ranger and the jord says the cuban guys are ugly and the cuban women are
mostly become fat and the grotesque but not the women in my family but not except for the women
in his family and he's just sucking around when he says that since the most cuban guys are ugly
i couldn't disagree more and if or landa were here he'd probably punch your ass out homestead
jaro's in here yeah what's up how you doing all right you still sick yeah i got the flu now
really well try some of those chili peppers up your nose can't hurt yeah it's just burn you up
wouldn't it yeah or maybe someplace else my you know just the burn that baby right out i just
call the cause somebody a douchebag yes sir my wife will hate you like poison does she really yeah what a
slut so money car you think douchebag okay all right thank you feel better feel something 947
a w i d so what do you think most cuban guys are ugly and jorge is there ugly and a hairy and they
have like one big eyebrow that goes like across the top of their forehead i think jorge quite
frankly is probably an ozhaan provocateur he's probably from uh peru or somewhere and putting on his
fake cuban act to get sympathy we have two open lions and dates 7 5 1 them all another thing i
wanted to talk about yesterday i forgot because we were so intensive and ripping rick riley
justifiably so by the way see how yesterday he got back into something he knows about
the here the first caller well there's 42 inches of pack powder out there in color righto that's
more like it rick stick with that skiing man it's right up your alley sally but the thing on 60
minutes on sunday about j leno i was so depressed after i saw that i mean i come in here and i'm not
tooting my own horn because there are a lot of guys rick and suds come in they do four hours every
day five days a week extemporaneous i mean it's all strictly off the top of your head and their
callers a lot of times come up with some funny stuff even by accident but i mean here's a guy
who's got all these writers like three four guys they sit around a table before clock in a morning
with all these three by five cards and he's recording all these one liners and listening to it back
and listening to the inflection and and i got news for you it ain't paying off j or jani or any
amie it's paying off in the paycheck in a wallet but in terms of being funny if that's the best
those guys can do with all those writers and spending all of that time and there's something damn
wrong going on today i'll tell you that maybe it's just that the comics today suck most of them
because back in the days of the uh sit-seasers show and he used to have Carl Reiner and uh
meld Brooks goes like that and he were funny i mean it was really funny stuff
oh you uh well i'm getting choked up about it 949 at wio d it's honor the ugly Cubans day
and i see i shouldn't start that because that's going to be perceived as an ethnic thing and Jorge
Mosque can also will come on and call Georgia redneck and we'll start a whole big deal here today
la licuerda amirello which means that Georgia's a redneck 953 at wio d here's the Miami hello
hi nil yes sir listen um may hear the only thing happen and the value of the yet today i want to
hear some sports you know about the marlins or uh basketball with the heat yeah you know who
they had on yet that in sports talk probably some football geek weird number one
ericson oh are you serious already nil it's the 18th of march it's the 18th skin is not in the
air i'm telling you oh man uh so i have to switch to uh q a m you know yeah i think i know all the
choice you know i just want to say something to my friend Tony yes sir Tony hold say he does have
worked again can i ask you a question by the way yeah are you Cuban yeah okay because George made
this uh George's Cuban himself i want you to understand that well he pretends to be and he said
the Cuban guys are ugly maybe he's ugly huh well yeah he's probably just talking about him so
he also said the Cuban women they're like a whole bunch and sleazy and look like uh Egyptians and
drag yeah well and jorge is married to a wasp a very tall attractive wasp so i think he's got
his own prejudices there that we're gonna have to work on people will find him like a real fat
Cuban babe on a side or something exactly teach him what it's all about okay have a great day
take care of your adios he just need the little change of pace George that's what i keep telling
Orlando 954 at wiod we have an open line in date where is my god damn soup man if you see this thing
about life when you need it you don't get it when you don't even want it it's all around you
you know what i'm saying i'm not not just a soup either but when you really are desperate for it
it's just uh it just ain't gonna be there you know what i'm telling you here's a lady in the
pound i'm 50 while i go i stand five four but um i'm about five three yeah are you married
huh no you're not married no and i'm a good looking person well what's the story you have a
boyfriend a couple a couple or three or four one for each day of the week uh now are they Cuban
you go with Cuban guys no i think you were men what they have worked in
oh no i like Jewish men you like Jewish men because they're circumcised and they got the
Cuban man that are circumcised only the only the only the wealthy Cuban men
yeah that's the problem right that's the problem only the only Cuban man that were um
wealthy were circumcised why did it cost a lot for the bris i don't have no idea
man it seems like a gold plated knife or something i don't get it you know but i thought that the
Cuban guys who were born how old are you 32 32 well Cuban guys who were born in this country
i from what i thought are mostly circumcised i hope he's according to my experience yeah but third
uh huh i don't i don't like human men why are they like ugly and fat and hairy
no because they play around ah there you go well see the the stereotype is that Cuban guys
get married to a Cuban woman who is going to have their children then they have like an
Anglo girlfriend on the side that's the stereotype oh whatever i'm going out with a boy
tonight yeah right baby yeah well yeah there's another story and they are going out with the
boys that's right yeah trust me when i tell you yeah well i think you made the right choice just
they foot loose and fancy free that's it and tell George next time you talk to him he's full of crap
yeah George he's full of crap okay anyway can i call somebody to do spang you go ahead
no i'm not going to miss who who is it i'll call Kirk i met you you met who i met you you met me
yes a piece of law oh great yeah you're gonna come up for a part i do a spang you're gonna be there
again on Tuesday March 31st you can come up again and uh give George a punch in the face
are you gonna be there again yeah March 31st no i'll calendar that in okay oh good have a good one
there you go bye bye i didn't miss poach you with all George i'm quoting you exactly what you said
you said Cuban guys are mostly ugly and a hairy they're like Ron Jeremy without the circumcision
that's exactly what you said have to start a whole ethnic thing here today oh by the way it's
interesting speaking of that the senator Alan Dixon of Illinois is going to be history didn't
even win his own party's primary got beat last night and a much much to do about the
the fact that he defected and turned turned coat and voted for that right wing slime ball
clearance long dong Thomas to the Supreme Court how do you like that so it's not just rubber
gates that's gonna bounce some of these assholes out of there but people have been watching even
though they're morons most of them they've been watching room or closely that some of these guys
built Clinton for president got my vote about ten times and my mother who says that she's not
going to van who fools around i got news for her okay she's voting on election day if i have to
drag her with a with a freight train with a tractor or else you beat that she's not voting for a
guy to be president of fools around i said well what about Kennedy and the ice now and rose
well nobody knew about that so in other words if you keep it a secret it's okay but as long as
she knows it then she's not gonna vote for it how do you like that what a pile of crap ma
you idiot let's go to a Daytona beach yeah yeah keep it before our big smell Phil oh would you stop
thank you is that why you're up there in Daytona try to get away from what great great great great
great well she been shut up shut up shut up what you're injured you're excited for your
an asshole but if we don't want to get into a big ethnic battle here now it's the
angle is in the Cuban's again we just got that all straight down like a human spell okay
and so do you 9.59 is WIO do you the Cuban spell too George how about Indians do Indians spell
i don't want to hear into a whole ethnic thing here then just minding my old business and George
made some inflammatory ethnic marcuses on people and i'm getting in the middle of it i don't i love
everybody okay well i do have all those pictures here uh what did he allow with the dennenberg and
sunny in the soup okay see dennenberg you are not only an asshole you're useless you're a little

pain that goes along with it for several months now and I've tried everything from sits baths to
suppositories and nothing is worked and amazingly enough the only thing that has worked has been
Neil Rogers just by listening to one show all the all the itching has stopped the pain has gone away
and the swelling is really dissipated and it's all because of the erudgers yeah 1214 we have an

1224 at WIOD as we continue doing our thing for you
Every day 932 right here in Yahoo City
So what's the story our Rickins had doing that thing tomorrow
We still own a
Oh God, is that embarrassing?
Are we doing that thing?
You know Tim from the stadium tomorrow?
We are doing it, do they know about it?
Oh, ha ha ha ha ha ha
Well at least somebody knows about it, that's a good start
Rickins had live from Joe Robbie Stadium tomorrow
We got a big weekend exhibition baseball at the stadium
Now we are sucking around heavy duty to try to get those Marlon games back
Here's a lady in Boca
A lady in Boca is gone?
No, she's here
Oh, geez, don't do that, God, I almost like flew off the chair
I was first time caller Ann, the first time listener
No, it's the first time listener?
Yes, I am
Where have you been all my life?
I don't know, I just hear Boca
Probably hanging out with Mr. Microphone and Sunrise
Exactly
But my friends have been telling me and I want to hear Clint Eastwood as the beaver
Really?
Yes
In other words, you want to see a little beaver intensive for you today?
Exactly
Well, you know, it's kind of a little tacky to call on a show that you never heard before
The very first day and make a request and stuff like that
But since you sound so charming
And how long have you been listening this morning or this afternoon or today or whatever?
About three hours
Three hours?
And what's the verdict?
You better say something really nice and suck around then I might play this stuff
I think this is incredible, I love it
Great!
In the show too, right?
Yeah
Okay, well go back to your radio and whip that baby up, okay?
Okay, thanks
Have a great day and by the way, happy forum
Thank you
Bye-bye
It's the all new, lead-to-beaver
Starring Bond Rebellion's lead
Hugh Beaumont
Tony Don
And Clint Eastwood as the beaver
You wanted to see me, Dad?
Yes, Beaver, sit down
I am, Dad
Keep in mind I'm six foot four
So what's the problem, Dad?
Beaver, I have never been more disappointed in you than I was today when you walked in the principal's office
Wearing that horrible sweatshirt
Oh, you mean my Beastie boy sweatshirt?
Right
And I just got...
This morning your mother and I both told you to take that sweatshirt off before you went to school
Now why did you deliberately disobey us?
Come on, Dad, it's the biggest concert of the year
Run DMC in the Beasties
And I already got my tickets
Oh, no, Beaver
Oh, yeah, Dad
All right, you can go
I thought I'd try to bring you home with DMC T-shirts
Club 27 at WI-D
Welcome to our little party, ma'am, whoever you are
It's so nice to have you with us and see how agreeable we are sometimes unless somebody calls up an axlachus psychotic bitch
By the way, the Dr. Susan Bloch show I want to mention this again
I don't know who left this but I'm pretty excited
Can we look into this, George?
Can we take our show on the road?
It says, a makes Dr. Susan Bloch makes love to Orlando on WQBQ Radio
Can we at least get some tapes of that? Some audio effects? Something
And she's doing her series of four safe sex shows with Orlando, I believe, or in Orlando
Well, that's bad
On the subjects of masturbation, phone sex, making out and heavy petting and condoms, not necessarily in that order
Okay, 1228, let's go to Hollywood on the Star Line
Hi, how you doing, Neil?
I'm doing it, man
Want to wish you a heartfelt, happy Purrums, to you in your part?
Yeah
I think you were talking about that, I think it might be Jerry Panacoli
The what? Jerry Panacoli and the Jerobo, yeah
It could be him, but anyway, I think it's a disgrace that's very...
It was kind of embarrassing when a Jerobo would run out on the field and get lost
and it would delay the game for hours at a time
Anyway, I think it's terrible that they remove that the instant replay
Mark my words, sir, Mark my words, they're going to be real sorry, real fast
Like in the first week of the season next year, they're going to be real sorry
They're going to be grabbed really right, a lot of bad calls last year
Yeah, so, anybody...
Even with the replay, there were a lot of bad calls, can you imagine now it's going to be on Nightmare
Terrible, anyway, I want to suck around on my first time listener, first time caller and I...
No, you're a young Neil
No, you're not
Yeah, have a nice life, boy, who you can...
12... what a sense of humor he's got
1229 at WIOD, let's go home now because I got my check and we had a good lunch
and the calls had been not too bad
and we had Mr. Microphone and we had that first time young lady and not too bad today, huh?
For a Thursday in a crappy town
Starlines open, Star I-O-D
Fort Lauderdale
Good afternoon, sir
Good afternoon to you, sir
I saw the needed bumper sticker mail
That said
You've seen the insignia for the Japanese orange sun
White background
Yes, sir
That just made no across, and I love it
Just made no?
Was it like on a Toyota or something?
No, it's on American car
Oh, okay
Anyway, sorry Pat Murray, in the great sense of humor, folks
Anyway
Oh, by the way, there was a thing in the...
Pat Buchanan had one of his stupid press conferences yesterday
and his wife was up there on the podium and they said, are you going to get rid of the Mercedes?
And she got up there, she said it's for sale, anybody want to make an offer? Ha-ha-ha, not
You know?
Really?
Anyway
Listen, if you scraped the swastik off the windshield, I'd maybe look at Subaru
Fashes, pigs
No doubt about it
Anyway, the reason I call, I think that the instant replay I think they should give each coach two or three champs to use of it
Their own discretion
Right
And the story, but how much revenue they're advertising and everything they're going to lose
No doubt, and I shorten the game
Once they find that out, man
No doubt
Although I was reading the thing in the satellite TV week yesterday that the NFL, because they made such a greedy, disgusting deal with the owners that they're like
Extending it and it's like almost they're giving it to the networks for nothing for a couple of years, you know what I'm saying?
Where are they talking about pay-per-view now?
Never going to have to forget it, never going to happen
Never will fly, believe me, that'll be the death knell of the game if they try that crap
That's the fact
But about 80% of those games that are on Monday night, they couldn't pay us to watch them
Anyway, if you can give me a little chill on my bones, I'm homesick, let's hear some dick curtain or some CKLW or something
Well, I think I'm having a relapse
Well, what the hell ever happened to dick curtain by the way, Kathy, paying any ass livingston call to you today
And said that when dick was down in the west coast a couple of weeks ago he was trying to call on the 800 number
And of course couldn't get through, which I find hard to believe
Because anybody can get through on our 800 line, but he's back up in Detroit making a lot of bucks
Okay, sure, have a good day
And you said about some fun with WKNRZ for time
There you go
I'll never happen to my CKLW, jingle
Oh, do you remember CKLW, mister?
You're living it
What?
Oh yeah, I do
Believe me I do
Oh, I don't like that
But Davey's likes it, it's nice and slow
CKLW, there it is
Yeah, okay, now we're doing it
Right on the Edselford Expressway, sir
Okay, thank you, sir
Have a great day
Bye-bye
See it, lose finder, Deli
Not
See it, skipper's table for, that used to be great
There was a Deli, not a Deli, a smorgasbord place
There were two of them one in Plymouth
And the other one on, I think seven mile road in Detroit they were called skipper's table, smorgasbord
And most smorgasbord places are like for old people
I don't want to mention any down here
They're like mostly out of business where they go in and they put their teeth in a glass
And it fizzes while they eat
And the spaghetti tastes like the corn and the mashed potatoes taste like the meatloaf
And you know, it's up
No, this was great, skipper's table
And you could go back like a hundred times and I had a friend salesman as a matter of fact
I shouldn't say that
A radio salesperson from Alby and Michigan
And before we go to the track at Hazel Park or Wolf Arena tonight
We go over to skipper's table and eat about 400 pounds worth of food for like $3.99
That was the best skipper's table man, they don't make them like that anymore
Plantation
Hey Neil
Yes sir
Malalook is aren't in bloom now
Oh
And if the thing you got gets into your test, you're gonna think you have bronchitis and pneumonia
It's wrapped up into water
What does that mean?
It means that you'll be coughing your brains out
What do you mean the thing I got? I got a head cold
Well, don't let it drop down
Don't let it, how about my cold?
I've got that too
Oh, no, it's like almost gone
All right
I think
You're trying to talk me back into it, aren't you?
Yeah
Misery loves company
Why not?
Okay, I'll work on it
See you
It's so godfather intensive today
Yes
The only thing I've seen that's bigger than you I see is the day I walked up behind Hankelberg at the track
Take it easy
Okay
Smart ass man, I'll tell you
Which one have I got out?
I don't even know which one of these I got out, I'm so damn godfather intensive I got them all out
Oh, number two, number two
I tell you when you're having a stressful traumatic awful day
There's just something so soothing about this music, you know
I know about you, but it sure does it for me
It just kind of calms me down
Like somebody is making me a musical offer that I can't refuse
Let's do a Miami, hello
Miami?
Buenos tardes?
Ostelewego?
Ostelevista?
Osteeras?
Let's do a leisure city
Hey, how you doing Neil?
I'm doing it
That's good
Hey, I first off I want to clarify you on that replay for...
Hey, Kate, hold it
Oh, I love it, go ahead
Not only did the douchebag get boat again
The Giants also vote against it
Not only them, but also the counterfeit bill
All the New York state teams voted against it, what the hell do they know?
Well, let's see, did the Giants get it again?
Sounds like they're trying to pull a fast one, yeah
But the Giants also, because the Giants and the Jets were like back to back on the list, I'm pretty sure
Yeah, triple play there
Screw them
Did you, have you seen any of this baby lollipop trial?
Baby lollipops, first of all, the name of the trial just, I mean, what the media does here, I just, I have a headache from thinking about it
Yeah, well, okay
Have you seen that girl who's pet the fine for the state of Libya?
Well, a girl, I guess, whatever, Olivia Gonzalez?
Yeah
You've seen the sideburns on her mansion, it looks like Elvis
No, she looks like Luke Perry on Beverly Hills 902-164-38
Are those babies real or is that Charles Alphieri sideburned?
Right
I mean, I don't know, do you tell her to butcher up there?
Only her proctologist knows for sure, sir
Yeah, I want to ask you about the Buchanan thing
Who?
You know, not fuck Buchanan
Buchanan, the guy who's trying to run president, he can't be president
Yeah, I'm right, I'm right Buchanan
He can't be president, really, can't he?
I mean, didn't they pass the law after Roosevelt was president, Franklin Roosevelt?
That no more president with the same last name?
Yeah
They had Teddy, and then, and we already had a president named Buchanan
Right
It's too bad because the Cubs were hoping to get Steve Wilson elected president
before they traded him the Dodgers and they just missed out
They just fully...
They're way to get rid of him, though
Yeah
Well, listen, have a great day, in fact, be a good way to get rid of Danny Jackson, too
But I guess that we got beat on that baby, too, have a great life, sir
Look at that, two open lines in day, that's a first in hours on this show, does that mean we're like coming screeching to a halt in the middle lunch hour?
We hope not
God, they just know how to stick it to you when you least expect to rate it
524, now what is it? I don't even know what the number is
751, I think it's setting into my lungs deep, George
Well, here I am again, your century village man, Chuck Zing
For I am again, this is Rick from Carpet and Tile X-Pope
Stay Master protects against most common food and beverage stains
Stay Master is certified and warrantied by DuPont
Paw 40, a WIOD, we got a mobile in Fort Lauderdale
Dale, how are you doing?
Okay
The longer I wait on this, the more I get mad at you, your cheap state management for not getting cellular one starline
Sir, what can I say?
What happened?
What you hear is what you get, what you see is what you get
I wish they are thrifty sir, they are like the Scottish, they are thrifty, like the frogs
Hey, we just want to note on that replay with stock, I can't believe they did that
Yes
All I got to say is, first one as well against the coach wise that complains on a call, got nothing to say
Exactly, in fact I think they ought to call it against them just out of spite, I mean like a real obvious one
Just to put some on
All they want is money, money, money, what the ought to do is have advertisers, sponsor like a replay minute
I don't like to put buy a Budweiser or something
Right, there you go
Fuck
Think I would have another Budbole and in between like 4500 times a game
That's right
Okay, I just want to throw that in
Okay, have a great life and a happy poem to you
Bye-bye, 1241 we have an open line at Broward 524
There's something I just have to hear one more time today
I gotta hear it, I have to confess because it's not even like from this show but it's gotta be in the top five in bubbling right now
So who would you vote for?
Why was any other guys bowling?
What other guy?
The Republican guy
Oh no, man
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry today, I didn't want to break it
Which one did you vote for?
I'm not gonna get into it, Chad
You'll freak out on me, okay?
Not...no way
Yeah
That uh...that hoody freak?
Which one be specific?
What's his name, man?
I'm not gonna argue, Paul
The guy from CNN?
Ted Turner, yes
Oh man, you voted for keep getting him?
I voted for Ted Turner
Dude, why?
You just send the police right into my pad
Why don't you give them my phone number and then it's red?
Ted, and let them come over and kill me
Man, you're gonna elect the thought police
Ted, this wasn't a presidential election, this is a primary, okay?
I didn't have a chance to vote for the other side
You mean the chance to vote for the other side, Rick?
What?
My pal Rick voted for a Nazi
I knew this would be...I didn't vote for a Nazi
Pro 42 at WIOD, I rest my case, here's a mobile and store it
Deal
Yeah
First time caller
Well, how I'll boot that, eh?
Come on
What? I know who this is
Huh?
I know who this is
I know, it's both been a while, I just...
Where were you last night up at Poppettopark when we needed your money?
I was at no shine to work last night
Yeah, I bet
I'm sorry
You were working it out
I'm afraid to go see you, man, since you went on that tirade on me the day after I saw you last time
You know, I'm kind of fearful of coming up and saying hello
You know, you are an asshole, is anybody ever told you that lately?
I didn't go on a tirade, all I said was how come it was that you and your very lovely girlfriend
Come over to the table after having your own very nice table, not too far away the entire evening
And seemingly perfectly happy there
And actually caching a few tickets through luck
And come over and like squat halfway down into the chairs at my table
And say, oh is it okay if we sit down as your ass is hitting the seat?
What was wrong with the other chairs were they like on fire?
She wanted to meet you
Well, that's fine
That's fine
And you know, she wanted to meet you
After an evening with you, it's though she probably wanted to meet anybody I would imagine
God
What night is the fan's horse racing this week Friday night?
Friday night, Friday night, don't ask me anything about that, I don't want to discuss it ever again
I mean, I'll be there, it's, what can I say?
Well, we might get a good price
Yeah, right, you'll have a big price all right
Yeah, even Bob Barker will be there, the price will be right
I'm just, I am so overwhelmed and I noticed that porcupine is conspicuous by his fat absence here today
With that stupid rule about two dollars across the board
See, you want me to tell you the real story?
Yeah
See, this summer for the summer meet, you know, like most of the guys are leaving
Like, pay the goes to the metal ends and walley goes back up where he goes A
And Kevin and Peter go back and Donnie Harbin to Detroit
I was going to ask you who our drivers are going to be by the way
Well, I think Hoagin is sticking around and Donnie Brainer will be like a top dog, you know
But anyway, Bruce Ranger is like right on the verge, you know, like one day he's going to stay the next day he's not
So they really just suck it up to Brucey to stick around because he's a real good driver
He's got, you know, he's a good horseman
And well, he's okay
And so this thing last night I think they must have, I just can't believe it, you know
I mean, like Bruce, hey, we love you and you won, he didn't win nothing, okay
Kevin is like God and he wins that 10th race like a champion
And you should have seen the photo for third, I'm telling you if Gary Lewis wouldn't have dropped his slip on the track
Just before I'm serious, he reached down to get it if he would have hit the worst one more time
Come on Gary, Wango your tango, maybe get your ass up there
And Brucey hangs on for third by like the slimmest of noses
And then, you know, it winds up with a stupid deal now
That porcupine came up with $2 across the board
What does that guy tend to do with driving his wheel?
I have nothing to do with anything
No, let's have a race off, let's do this right and stop sticking it to Kevin for crying out
I wonder what he ever do to us besides catch me a lot of tickets
Damn it
Feel like I got a dolphin question for you
I think they're prejudiced against our Michigan drivers at Pompoot O Park
And I'm going to take some serious damn action about it like Friday night
I am
I'm going to go out there and blow away all the other horses and let Kevin and Peter and Donnie win by 10 lights every race just out of spite
I'll be there Friday
And I'm going to get that Kelly Shepherd too for parking my horse 27 seconds the first quarter last night and then finishing 8
Oh 27 second first quarter
Kelly Shepherd man outside I don't even give me started
Okay, about good old Kelly the schlep
And he wonders why about half of those guys out there in a track were like to stick his ass in infield lake
Well Joe likes to do that too, Joe likes to park him out and got him in the first quarter
Joe is whipping him before they start the before the gate opens, Joe is whipping and slashing
Joe had a horse last night coque in the 12th race 2 to 5, okay
2 to 5 at the top of the stretch this horse stopped like he ran into a met truck, okay
Like he ran into a brick wall
Great one with China, go
Exactly that was Jolton Joe with coque I got your coque right over here
Yeah, the only round three quarters of a mile, Joe would win all the races
Yeah, he is whipping up Tonyo once Joe is through with a man they don't walk for a month
He loves to whip it and the horse is still
Yeah, that's what Dominic said
When you cut the crap out of love watching the full we've had a great day and the phones are dropping off here like flying
This is like Rick Riley talking about snow skiing, okay nobody cares
I've packed you a cabinet
Yeah, packed this
Neil I just remembered my dolphin season seconds
Yeah, and they sent me a notice saying that they're gonna put aside a day for season second holders to come out and upgrade their seats
Where you can actually go to the stadium and pick your seats if they're available
Yeah, have you been to that in the past as it worked going down there?
No, I don't pick my seat my nose a little bit. No, my seat
Have a great day, friend. Yeah, in honor of instant replay being killed. Yeah, can you play
Referee by Tom Petty by Joel
1247 here's such a pain in the ass. We have an open line in date
Seven we got three open lines now
We've been killing killing them all day long and he comes on here and starts a whole damn thing about
The pop it up park which I love but the audience 98% of them couldn't give one crap about and like the whole show is dead now thanks a lot Joel
Wait until you sit down at the table next time we got a little surprise for you. We got like an electric seat
Sally supplying the juice
All your orifice manager I got a headache from his call. I really do all your orifice managers out there
It is your orifice use bottled water like ours used to here at WIO and D
Well, if you do you're probably wasting space in time by stirring and schlepping those big bulky heavy a hernia inducing bottles and
Probably your bills are tough to decipher in a fluctuator flatulate for month to month
This is Paul song is oh it's 1251 and that's for the one two hour and I punched it up bad mistake
Anyways, they say in my backyard to my dogs in the morning in plantation don't void where prohibited anyway

Both were right now I wasn't plantation when I called I'm now in North Dade wow on my own dime. What a step in a wrong direction. Anyway. Yeah. First this is not
a proper thing. It's real simple. Why does it do like Sally did and just suck up dead and so to speak and you'll have no problem. I don't think Susan will be too happy about that. Well, you know, it
worked for Sally. I mean, what's coming year she's been there right? Second hang Goldberg. You ever listen to Hank? I don't think Bob's got the right
connection so to speak. Do you ever listen to Hank? Yeah. If I'm in the car at night, I always listen to Hank. Yeah. Are you going to what's
that really? All I asked you is if you're going to I wasn't like threatening you or something. I mean, I want you to keep in mind. The
Hank's been under the weather. He's got like a heart problem. He's been he's been in I am too. Nobody cares about that. He's been
in and out of the hospital. He's got like a breathing problem and I mean, he's like overweight. He's a hippo problem.
Come on. Well, I was on the loser. He's got to he's got to cut the crap. Well, that's part of my thing. Whenever you listen to him, he's always talking about the
raider cheerleaders and these fabulous bass that's for Todd that place the advertises. Yeah, what the hell is he kidding? He couldn't get one of those
tricks. Like he paid for it. So what's wrong with that? What are they going to do with a fat guy? What's wrong with that? So what's wrong with that? He's got the big
bucks. Why do you think he works like 80 hours today? He's got serious, but that's probably why his heart's ready to stop. He's
out here and to you. I know, but he's acting like all these babes are all over. Give me a break. They are and that's because they work by the
hour. What's wrong with that? I think you just jealous or go out and get a boyfriend 12 54 at W. I. Would do we have an open line in
Broward? Well, I'm telling you, I got the good stuff coming up now. That signals the end of this crud when a really good
stuff starts coming out from the bowels of your mucus glands. God. You're not going to believe this. Okay, nobody and you
won't care about it, but it's just ironic. Either I'm getting psychic or just I'm losing it. I'm watching my CBS
Morning Show this morning, CBS today or whatever to show it. And I'm sitting there. I know it's strange, but I'm
thinking about the mucus because I'm like almost over this cold. And I just for some reason I'm thinking about,
you know, that we used to talk on here about the really dark green is like it's been in the body the longest and then the
yellow, which is kind of gross. But that's the rumor. You know, that's the popular folklore that the darker the mucus, the
longer it's been in the body. And wouldn't you know, just as I'm thinking about this, they come out with a story about
not asthma. What's the thing they've got this new DNA ace this new stuff to break up the mucus
where people cough and choke and we had it on our news all morning.
Some kind of like a bronchial disorder and they're starting to talk about mucus.
And my mind was on mucus, which is really not something I think about too much. Here's a for Lauderdale.
Hi, Neil. Hi. How you doing? Okay. You're not. We were right. It's not on mucus is it? No, not at all. Excellent.
I want to wish you a happy poem. That's an organization. We're starting called mom, M-O-A, minds on mucus. Happy
home Natasha. Yeah. Do you like the real ones like I like with the poppy seeds in the outside that are big and fluffy and soft?
Or do you like those little hard triangular ones that are supposed to be for real? I like the ones the real ones.
The soft ones. Right. I only like certain things that are hard. Not home Natasha. Right. There you go. I want to talk to you about when you sponsor spicers.
Yeah. Did you ever try them? Yes. You like them? Yeah. I've got a whole bunch of them at home. What flavor?
Chocolate. I love the best. Yeah. I just tried the chocolate. I have to tell you this meal. They really sucks.
You don't like them? No. I like barbecue ones. It sucks the big weedy. Yeah. What about the other ones? I didn't try the other ones. Oh.
These are terrible. What do you like with one of those phony fake diet plans or something? No. You got to eat miracle berries first. Oh yeah. That can't hurt. Well, call a plant doctor. That'll work. Right. Okay. Have a good day, Neil.
In fact, maybe you can plant some in your home Natasha. Excuse me. I said have a great forum. You tell fine.
She's with one of those like teni crag or something. 1257 at WIOD. We have an open-line and broiled 524.
Out of town is quite a down considerably and quite frankly, I couldn't give a fly and crap less to be honest with you. Here's a cuntler edge. Hey, good afternoon, Neil. How you doing, sir?
I'm doing lousy. You say misery love. Love cuntler. Oh, it's going around, man. It's the crud. It's creeping.
I woke up with it yesterday. Yep. So how long do I have? I got to look at the mucus. Yeah, what it starts to wonder real heavy duty like dark green. Oh, this is real clear. Oh, no, that's just the beginning. Oh, man. How long you had it?
Let's see Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Just about a week. That's why it takes about a week to get rid of the cold. That's just about at the end. That's the tail end. Well, at least some home here. Take care of yourself. Yeah.
And you got a good weekend to get destroyed. It's always good getting the cold before the weekend. You get your whole weekend ruined.
I'm not going to be one of these people jumping on the old bandwagon about the instant replay thing. I'm glad it's out of there. Well, there we go. Find me a guy even
who knows what he's full of crap. I don't have to go to say that's right. Good for you. Every time every call is a crucial call. I mean, how can they say this call?
Every call is not a crucial call. That's not. No, it's not. If you can't, can I wait a minute? Wait a minute. Can I explain something to you in baseball.
Balls and strikes, you know, and stuff that goes on. Okay. Every pitch. There's another call. You know what I'm saying?
The every ball that's hit the umpire has to make a call in football. The mid or even though there are a lot of calls to be made. Let's face it.
Most plays in football. A, there's not a penalty and B, there's not a controversy about whether it's complete or incomplete or a football or not.
So it's compared to baseball where there are like hundreds and hundreds of pitches. Football's a piece of cake. There aren't that many.
Yeah, but when you know when you when you you know, stop a play for this or this, you stop the momentum of the drive and how many teams,
especially Buffalo, they in Cincinnati when they first started, but the reason for that is they didn't do it right.
They were supposed to allow only so many seconds and were some of those deals and went on for like a half an hour.
I'm getting and I'm getting sick and tired of you know how fat I got going back to the fridge every time.
So why can't they just tighten it up a little bit? Well, every time you make a rule in sports, you got to have rules to
govern that rule, right? And they're not doing it. And what did they do back in the old days? They paid the rep's off.
So you know, keep doing it here. What's the difference?
Oh, when it starts getting like purple, that's the time to call us again. Have a great day. Feel better.
Okay, well, he's under the weather that you know, answers his problem.
Not everybody's going to agree on this. We like one or two people who happen to be wrong. 751 WI would do.
We have an open line of day. We got Lisa Campbell. I'll bet Lisa here.
Okay, Lisa's she's misdependable and er, okay, she may not get it right. But Lisa's in there.
Lisa's got the one o'clock news. We got Rick and Suds today with what's her name is back again. Laura Corn with her corn ball crab.
