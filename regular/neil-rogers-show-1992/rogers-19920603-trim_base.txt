the game too it'll probably be hanging out outside trying to get in we can just beat the crap out
him to get even i think he's gone yeah but he'll be hanging out outside yeah uh another reason i'm
going up there i don't know if people are familiar with the chicago blues fest that runs a second
week in june it's one of the world's largest free blues festivals down in grand park then they

got activities they're all fun oh man that's just in the summertime that's like dine and go into
heaven when you go to jago i mean it's hot and it's humid and all of that but at least there's
