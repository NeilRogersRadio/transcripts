well but then he take see it's bad enough that he holds a grudge in the in the
interim has been running in and out of here pretending to be you know everybody's
best pal and laughing and i gtr all i can't
but then to take it out on somebody else
who's a great guy down there at floris and who've been nice to all the people

so he doesn't even know how to be a sourpuss well that's his story
twenty four past eleven at w i o d we want to remind you again that those
nearodgers squeeze bottles the refillable squeeze bottles are in trust me as we
speak right now at every one of the seven south Florida charhots and you're
going to love those delicious char cheeses and char burgers and hot dogs and
italian sausage and at virgin white chicken breast and
those great great onion rings i sure wish they'd get them at the hollywood
location but wherever you are near a char hot head for right now it'd be a great
time for a little early lunch and pick up the nearodgers squeeze bottle of
refillable coke or any kind of soda and then it's just a buck seventy two i think
and you bring it back between now and labor day as many times as you want for
half price refills eighty six cents you can't beat that with a stick great with
bill mullins brain you couldn't beat that okay so head for char hot today for an
inexpensive delicious meal i especially highly recommend that great Italian
sausage boy it is spicy and out of this world you'll find char hot in margate
Oakland Park Miami hollywood david tamarack and sunrise
twenty seven after eleven at w i o d it's good enough for Ernie it's good enough for
us the only thing i regret is i didn't wear any socks to work this morning okay

socks on each foot just for good measure
because you can never have too many you know how they disappear
hollywood hello hey Neil yeah how are you great good boy it's nice to be going away again

and here's an Alice rentel spy report even as we speak hello more than the hybrid how you doing
listen you know i don't know if you know but you know i guess around 9 30 in the morning old
Debbie comes rolling oh she could be unrolling in literally yeah like like a bowling ball
he sees it coming in this morning and he says to her he introduces her the most beautiful
top show host in the nation okay then he said to her you look great what's that he says
that she looks ready to the morning that she looks more beautiful in the morning that she does
it six o'clock at night yeah i believe that god yeah god make me so Neil i'll let you go and of course
if anybody if anybody's got great expertise in judging feminine polkitude it's definitely Alice
and Neil yeah i hope you'll why something for anything that we can put on a year
bill wise you're a dickhead that was good okay although i wouldn't give them that much credit it's
11 32 at wild look at that as soon as he mentioned Debbie Ellis couple of lines dropped off in
brow don't give her too much publicity now because we're having a hell of a time keeping up
524 wild in brow are two open lines in brow are they just immediately both
well right out and balka's open 278 946 3 boy this is so this is tough this is i forgot what this
was like remember some of those Mondays what it was like this it wasn't like this even those bad days
were better than this look at that the brow lines are just kind of like sitting there
and a vocal line they're just not enthusiastic anymore okay they just don't love us like they used to
do they i don't think they hate us like poison to be honest with you they
11 33 at wild one thing you're going to love are those great oh Tim was starting up again
11 37 at wild couldn't been anybody else because the other engineers don't hate me some of the
mildly dislike but it's only Tim anyway we have an open line and that's a little inside here
Sharon was telling us a little story about some stuff in the hallway yeah the only engineer who
won't speak to me who's that Tim oh he doesn't speak to you eat it while see your part of the show
exactly he is carrying on his guy again at rickhead words uh juvenile behavior anyway not
seriously you know i don't really care but when you work i've said this before when you work in
a building with people every day it just just the most simple the most superficial common sense is
that even if you what what it would nick is saying no are there people you don't speak to there are
why because you hate their guts right yes he didn't want he didn't want to say it emphatically
but he kind of like yeah i don't understand it i mean i first of all there aren't that many people
in the building i dislike i'm trying to think there's only two and one recently yeah we don't
want to mention Bill wise his name i'm trying to think if there's anybody else there nobody else in
building just like yeah do you now very you know just wonder and but even even at that well
no i will not speak to Bill wise but that that's more than dislike that's that that's just
common sense when he treats you like garbage and stiffs somebody else because of a problem he's
got with us but the engineering thing boy is just incredible i mean you just it just doesn't it
isn't done you know i mean just put on an act just be for yeah i'm not one of these people believes
in putting on an act in your life okay but where you work every day and you have to encounter the
same people every day it's just like i said the simplest most basic common decency but of course
some people don't have that no so he was out there in a hallway a hawk in a china with scott trying
to start trouble again like i'm starting the story again the story didn't have to do with scott his
name was mentioned only because he was involved in it because Bill wise mentioned it at the table
but boy i i think i like crayons or something out here they think it worked for key thighs
we're going to try it here now because since i've come back today's only wednesday i i have never seen
such juvenile behavior in all my life it's like they're all regressing into into an infantile state
like indiana it's eleven thirty nine at w i d we got a mobile phone in store let's get to the
important stuff and screw all these childish idiots hello hey nil yeah hey i'm just wondering in
in honor of the maylocks and w o l d i got a bunch of people that i got one to hear that um
wasted away again in allen bail do you well that he mean like a bunch like two
no i mean like uh two maybe maybe even two bunches maybe a couple of bunches i'll be damned uh
so this is really a request is that what you say no no i wouldn't i wouldn't put a request i
suggestion what's that a suggestion a suggestion mm-hmm while you sound like you're a howl to
that twenty one twenty one so you're under the age of a hundred you're in stew you're in
steward yeah what are you doing there work in driving working in computer's the pain in the ass
so you live there no i live down in four lot of all you live in four lot of that because i was
going to say if you said you live in steward i would immediately pull a card out of the machine
but since you live down here with us and suffer through the daily rigors of life in sunflower
there's no problem at all well thank you sir okay anybody in particular we're going to dedicate
this to we can do it kind of like they do on the mark denver show on wax yeah
panel wax the music for lovers yeah right dedicated to Donna Donna yeah well isn't that nice

but first we want to rave about the armadillo cafe what does she want how share all getting push
you again it's eleven fifty three at wio d i will say this and of course part of the reason is
because we had that accident in chicago but here we were surrounded by martial field lord and
tailor nemen marcus blooming dales across the street every department store that's ever been
invented and she didn't go shopping what oh come on isn't that incredible i know that's not
pop well we purposely kept her busy and obviously okay we have an open line in bulk up at two seven

things about me she showed up in the studio isn't that nice and uh... we'll come back and don't
forget Steve this afternoon with a show that's just too a dangerous for us to talk about
it's the one to two hour
coming to a theater near you two cops one young one oh one black one white one on the tape one on the
up and up one dead one alive two cops one kid one straight one eluther the other and a
piscopail one on a hike a lester all day one a semi-vegetarian one with an attitude
one mired in a moral dilemma two cops one of it one of the democrats one already one of
one one fang one fang one five put four six put one eight swap one of fashion one kind to his one
never calls two cops sorry that funny guy from tv and that character actor who's been around forever
and i can never remember his name two cops from the same kinds of people who brought you steak out
shake down ready running skate the weapon color family held one two three four yeah god street
so san francisco you get that picture two cops like every one you've ever known and his brother
two cops i remember a variety of titles in every other theater in town this summer people someone who
drives you right out of your skull that you just can't help a lot of them in spud you tell you know
two cops and they're
they left out Alice's favorite part of their one big and one small
didn't they i didn't hear it i'm sorry you missed that oh boy one oh seven
a w i o d the home of happiness and lots of juvenile behavior this is where it's at ladies and
gentlemen in fact maybe you'd like to send us a w i o d sandbox and we could put it out in the
hallway okay and every now and then some of the people in the building or guilty of juvenile behavior
kind of like tiptoe through it you know and bring their little pale and shovel their little spoon
sounds good anyway boy it's a big one to two hour we got all these lines lit up here you think
these people had something to talk about right so far very unlikely highly unlikely but
are you still there by the way is that me you yeah boi and beach oh you're in boi and beach now
i thought the guy from england was on air but since and you were last in line but since you were
kind enough to say boi and beach and not pretend to be the guy from england will get ready right away
i mean we'll put you on a good one no don't you feel better about that i mean you were wouldn't
isn't this better than waiting for seven other boring callers yeah i'm pretty far up about this
exactly i will show a little gratitude you see the w j n o and uh
w j n o what's that that's where uh jack coel and i guess dicks feral used to work oh that's
where dicks feral got fired from yeah what when did he get fired i guess just a couple of days ago
boy and people are really in the cups about it so this big yeah well i got all missing two
months i listen to jack coel in the afternoon and i was just wondering uh in fact all the
athletes in pombi to put their cups on to celebrate they were so excited i guess you're right i
you look so what did you think wait wait wait wait sir wait calm down a minute okay it's
we got plenty of time here you're not liking a race okay now uh what did you think of the dick feral
show on w j n o and not too much i didn't really listen to them that well neither did anybody else
that's why he got fired and steves trying to inflict him upon us here and boy that better not
happen i'll tell you that okay well i'm behind you on that one okay but how it's just the reason i'm
calling is um i was listening to you in the morning because i was tired of jack coel singing
yeah and uh you guys seem to have some music on there the morning these
they spawned about cheese cake and or the other one this one pussy pussy in the well or not
pussy in the well yeah i don't know let's let's use the entire title sure let's not start
thinking parts of it selectively okay i just wonder why you played those things that's what
frustrates me about jack coel and i was trying to find something new and refreshing and then i hear
about pussy in the well and uh the cheese cake but what are you talking about cheese cake yeah i don't
know that what the hell is that i don't know the cheese cake i think i'm gonna give Jimmy
Buffett strong with cheese cake in it no that was wasting away and howl on there oh cheese cake
and i put you i put you on first uh no i turned jack coel back on okay get out of here and don't
ever call his show again like me just just just just just just just just tell me what your
problem okay let's so we got an open line in pom be 655 wio that's really funny by the way what's
that oh it's classic it's growing on the eyes great first few times i didn't so that guy doesn't
like all the little songs uh let him try to get away from it
okay bye yeah we're going through everything for the not be if they go with it so shame for it one two
three five stir out at the oh okay okay now if that didn't do it if that didn't you're ready him
nothing ever you're right go away pal okay you're another one of those Palm Beach people who
thinks that there's really stuff going on up there and that god for sake in place this place is
bad enough okay this is a bush league the it's a tropical depression is what it is down here but
Palm Beach is like it's not even like little league it's like sand law okay it's like the littlest
of the little leagues as Alice would say the tiniest uh huh the smallest of the small so just
bug off and don't start calling here and tell us how to run the show okay anyway we have these
great dolphins gauge and don't forget a w-i-o-d it's not just a game it's an obsession i'm just
enthralled and you think we had a lot of dolphin promos now just wait a couple of weeks man to be
on like every other second every in the middle of phone calls we're going to be having Rick weaver
singing what do we do with that by the way oh oh yeah yeah this will get that guy upset you think
haha this is Rick weaver voice of the dolphins and today i'm also the voice of a generation
people flying to push down love that but anyway if you want to pick up your dolphin schedule
a sooner or later we're going to tell them where they are because they're all downstairs now waiting
to be distributed by the w-i-o-d account executives to sponsor so i wouldn't hold my breath
but uh the thing that i noticed right away is they've distorted it's not like it's like a tactic
not slanting Donna Mills you know or they shoot her through linoleum that's what in fact one
one show they shot her through cement it was incredible but anyway weaver and golver his side by
side and the pictures like all distorted on the schedule you know my right my exaggerating
by being honest the colors and this is not by accident okay we don't want you to see what they
look like it's the same reason that we're on radio and we try to lay low i mean these guys
the colors like smeared yeah it's like somebody smeared the whole picture before they put it on
here i didn't know rick weeper was award winning oh it says award winning broadcaster rick weeper
are you going to start ripping him now football season you can do it during the off year when he
like just comes in his paycheck is it football season it's getting pretty damn close but
now we're here from rick well i shouldn't be able to tell by the weather outside should exactly
it's only not too much yeah should have jogged about what you immediately go out and start
thinking of shoulder pads and stuff when it's like August yeah especially when you go to
south beach and see the husket with their 80 pounds of clothing crossing colons avenue anyway it's
one thirteen at wio do you think we're going to do just a little bit of a break in the good news is
here we got an eBS test this is a test this is why would you get that sense since you're
amplifier i got it it's tell you stop jack or up and it only cost me 999 999 what a deal for the
amplifier and a tuner i also got an anti-static record loss and two hla proud audio quadriple
three thousand speakers you can draw on all those rick come back only 999 i must be some sort of
nanda for not having gone down the stairs and stuff and got one already i got to find some money
got it had a player sometimes if you've got your head up your ass about stereos come to stereos
this is great i feel like bob savage did we have an op i hope not open line at just a joke bob
don't start getting hyper in intense okay you're just a very emotional guy we have an open
line in broward five two four w i d haven't spoken to Phil saltman in a while huh and they're
racing today they are racing we aren't picking up for a while we're just you can start picking
next week but i'm not here no i don't know i wait for you to come back and i even heard bill
calder on the show this morning say that he wasn't going out there this weekend because i'm not
going to be here isn't that great well it's just not the same when he i go out there together there's
a certain chemistry because i can cross out all the horses that he picks and i he picked cross out
all the ones that i pick and it's a big advantage you know well i'm sure he can be not some nice

bill calder and the dick feral one day of course that'll be difficult because almost nobody ever heard
a joke the problem yeah who knows what evil hurts i know well listen when we can get him on and
make green together on the same thing but i'm glad you're in here because i got melting pot
coming up right now and i heard i heard through the grapevine that you've been saying that the
melting pot are the imitators which i find fabulous i mean just incredibly interesting because the
guy who started your place which i don't want to mention on the air but the guy who started your
place used to be a waiter at the melting pot in tala hasi that's how he started with fondue as a
waiter and then as he worked there he decided hey look at this they're making all this money and
they're doing great why don't i just go start my own place and he started with the one and now he's
got a couple of ripoff places they're just cheap imitations of the melting pot oh but you
notice how he kind of glosses over there and if you're having trouble hearing steve he's a little
soft-focusing no he didn't just because mic open it's open it is isn't it okay
and he stole it and he ripped it off and he ripped it off what you that's your line okay you
can ask me anything no you know why because they tried it first before your guy put it on
him any they tried it and they just didn't feel that it was up to like the field too which is like
all knots in that place that you ever know it's like knots landing they tried it and they didn't
yes as my friend once and boy it was a real experience is dang clear what you say yes as a matter
of fact it was like knots landing without the landing if it still all washes anyway you'll want
the real good fondue if you got any taste you know steve is one of these guys it tries to be
generous to these folks and help them out but the melting pot started fondue in his town they made
it famous they make it better than anybody they got the secret recipes that Greg couldn't
steal right and believe me it's just phenomenal from the cheese appetizers the great chef salad
to the summer sizzler special where you get a little bit of everything there's no lobster
revealed because it's from hunger is fondue but they do have and no free dessert because nobody has
to give away freebies at the melting pot a combination of filet mignon shrimp teriyaki surloin
and breast of chicken all in one great entree the summer sizzler special and save room for those
great desserts and a good part of it is when you get the white amber red o' dessert no nuts
in the dessert you know because they don't melt the Nestle's chocolate bars with the nuts and
it'll like they do at certain other places no nuts in my fondue even Alice said that on a show
this one so you head for one of the three melting pot restaurants tonight or any night seven nights
week that's what he told the officer and he wrote him a second ticket south by me 98 35 sunset drive
north by me beach at 31 43 northeast 163rd and of course the notorious melting pot in
crawl springs just east of West sample road don't forget the Debbie Ella show I guess that's
over now is brought to you today by fiber one no that's the sandy patent news is mailbox and then
of course they have a little a keo pectade for the Alice Rantell show early in the morning in fact
that's the new slogan on a rantell show it's in the bag isn't he soft spoke in the
owl was talking about police officers penis size that's the rumor i don't uh
well he's just that you know if they have a small penis they're they're not you know they're
very sensitive about it and they're they're not in a good mood when they pull you over you know
yeah and and and particularly motorcycle cops he says particularly motorcycle cops man
well no he says he says he says you should ask but they ask you for your license you should ask them
yeah that would always that would be my first instinct is to answer that question you know
I swear I heard this this morning driving to work Steve I swear I was on the dog next person
I'll probably never forget where I was listening to this yeah and a rumor also has did you hear the
part because you told me he spoke to Jeff Charles yes he spoke to Jeff Charles we can hear this
and uh he's covered a whole new format provenance wrote island and uh Jeff you sure wasn't
province town that's what he originally called and Charlie Meadows Meadows.
Meadows. Yes and his name Meadows.
Meadows. Johnny Meadows. Anyway Jeff Charles says he's on three to six up there and he's
discovered this revolutionary new talk radio format no guests they just go on and just talk
and just have a good time you know I don't know where they hear Charles ever got the idea for that
but that's what he said and they were they were agreeing it the guests are terminal often they
have little to say. The list was agreeing. Oh absolutely says that's why they dumped the guest.
That's why he likes to be on the morning. The dream of consciousness. I'd be on the morning. Sidekicks.
No question about it make no mistake about it yeah I don't know where he got the idea.
And a sense of humor which he obviously has gone well the stuff about the cops if I was a steric
well anyway and I like those little uh too many calls that he makes because yesterday he called
me her Suarez and he called but who is some of the other big celebrities it's our Tungiri Williams
which is unusual very unusual so I'm like every other day that he's jury kind of like his butt
exactly calls out yeah that's a new format they might try to F.T.L.
Maybe F.T.L. could start like a new format called don't call us we'll call you and it could
just go through the phone book. Yeah it's something to think about. Exactly.
Well we're very issue oriented on this show and I want to say so what do you think of the Metro rail?
The Metro rail? It's just a joke. It's pretty dope. The Metro rail too is just a joke.
I want to say does man Cain? Who? This man Cain? Steve Cain are you gonna rip him now?
All I know is that man. Wait a minute why don't you unplug the mic again?
All I know is the man from whatever it sounds so stupid that he couldn't empty water from a
period of directions from the bottom. Wow. Wow. You know something he's just in heaven now. In fact
he wants you to call on his show so badly he said he would just love to have a little one on one
with you. No problem. I don't know if he's even up to my level I'm 17. Really?
Wait a minute he's typing a message here on the screen it's probably going to be hostile it says
she doesn't have the balls. Well I'm sure of that. To call in another word she says you don't
have the guts to call him one on one and face to face. What time to show?
Now wait a minute are you making all these comments about him you've heard his show haven't you?
I know from what I've heard from other people who listen to him. Yeah.
And from the bottom of my head. Well now I wouldn't see but that's not fair okay.
I mean if you're only hearing a second hand what? I'll listen to him today.
Ah see now try that. No now don't you realize you're hearing a second hand from other people
who listen and you're making all these accusations. I mean what you said probably is true.
Ah. No seriously that's a terrible thing to do it's a bad habit to get into is take it.
Now you just got through complimenting me for not going through all of BS and you know telling
it like it is you've got to make your judgments based on what you hear and what you feel.
Not what somebody some other jackass tells you right? Because your friends probably are
bozos too from time to time right? Definitely. Definitely. There you go. So you listen today you're
going to promise me. I promise. And I want you to call me tomorrow and then you give us your own
personal honest opinion and then you can call Steve tomorrow too if you're not you know paranoid.
Okay promise. I promise. Talk to you tomorrow. Okay. See now we got you new list new there. She's
17 great demographic. She sounds like you know she's bubbly and effervescent and she's going to listen
herself. See it just becomes fashionable to say those things that like Steve is some kind of a
monk head douchebag. If you say it and you mean it from personal experience then it has some
significance. But just to say it because it's the popular thing to say that's that's going along
with the crowd okay I just can't find it. Dear field. Yeah Neil. Yeah. Yeah how you doing? Okay.
Listen I was flying in from New York yesterday. Boy how do you press it? Well I guess how uplifting
to be flying in from Newark. Yeah right but I had to lay over in Atlanta. Mm hmm. And I was listening
to my radio while I was sitting around in the airport and some guy got into conversation with
some guy at the airport. He said he heard you was transferring up there. Any truth to that? No
there's no truth to it and I don't know whether this call is for real or whether this is one of those
provocative calls that somebody has set you up to make but we have a jackass who started rumors
in Atlanta yesterday that I was coming up there and that the world was going to come to it and I'm
this terrible person going to WSP. What are the chances you think of my going to work in Atlanta sir?
Yeah I didn't think it made much sense. No I didn't see you for a couple of years now. Yeah.
You know I can't get in the antenna big enough to pick up a station in Atlanta so I'd have to follow
you up there. There you go. Well I got news for it. They gave me a list of a hundred cities to go to
that would be one of the last five. Yeah I hear that. Okay. Okay thanks a lot. Have a great life sir.
Oh we're back to that again huh? 136 at WIOD we have an open line in Broward at 524 WIOD 524
946. He said when somebody says well I've heard rumors as this individual who was up there yesterday
did there were no rumors. He's the one that started that now. Okay just to be provocative and to be
a more harassment and just to create more problems and of course time and time again it just backfires
because he's not fooling anybody okay. But like I said if you wait long enough 40 or 50 years the
wheels of justice in this country will see that everything is straightened out have no fear.
Right now speaking of that speaking of the wheels of justice if your car is stolen you want to sit
around waiting for the insurance company to settle you want to sit around waiting forever to see
if they're ever going to find your car because 999 out of 100 they're not going to find it unless
you have that low jack in your car okay this is an incredible device we've seen it demonstrated
personally I think most of us here at the station about a chance to go with the folks from low jack
and they've taken us out and hidden one of the cars and then they show us how the thing actually
works and here's how it does work they hide that little tiny transmitter a radio transmitter in your
car truck and if your car is stolen all you do is call the police immediately and they automatically
activate that transmitter and they have a device that tracks it and they can just home in on it in a
matter of minutes the average time is about a half an hour they can find that car while it's still in
one piece while it's still worth getting back. So it's offload of being number one in auto theft in
the entire country it just makes sense to protect a big investment by having low jack in fact low
jack isn't expensive it's guaranteed an installation by bonded technicians can be done quickly at your
home or office and when you talk to them be sure and ask about that 25% discount on your comprehensive
insurance when you have low jack. Call them today for more information call their toll free number
1-800-30 I wouldn't think so yeah I wouldn't think so okay Neil you have a very nice day I think
touched all the bases sir and I just wish he would uh besides they contrived debate try to go toe
to toe with you those were the fun days right there's no match whatever you say yes sir have a great
life okay well there was a real butt kisser if I ever heard one 142 at WIOD by the way the rumor is we
were picking on Scott again about the noise and that's not true in spite of what our friend from
engineering told you in a hallway we hear about all these things he didn't say that to you Sharon was
making it up just tell Tim to get a life and go back and hang out with Rick Edwards would you
anyway boy look at these phones all of a sudden like in noon it's like everybody got off of
playing maybe they were coming from Newark okay with that other guy through Atlanta maybe
everything's straight not every I think everybody here had to get something out of their system
kind of like Bill Wise oh needs to get something out of his system okay in fact we have the
animal bag that just might do the job okay it's a Debbie yellow special it's a poor bagger okay
see you think that four baggers an old baseball expression for home run but four
baggers really from the Bill Wise School of cleansing internal cleansing and if anybody can use it man
now let's see there is is that Laura that I see because the window does things here that's Laura
now I've got all the stuff that I'm gonna have to record you doing that today doing that today as
soon as I get off and Mitch came in here and he said have no fear you can make it as warm as you want
no problem at all so I'll crank it up to about 90 go in there and sweat my way through some of
those spots because next week I know this comes as a shock but it's a long overdue for me I'm going
on vacation again I'm almost I'm almost in bear it but I got a news for it's not my fault that
it's also close together I was taking the first part in March as you remember at the end of March
and then a little Miss Muffet back in sales set up this thing I had to do and I couldn't go away
and she screwed up my whole vacation schedule but to be honest with you I like the way it worked out
a lot yeah because between the Chicago trip jammed in there in between and then these other
vacations it's like just you know it's I feel like I'm part of management on a permanent vacation
that much yeah in fact little did people know but you know that album by your oh Smith permanent
vacation was about people in management broadcast manage I knew that well I'm sure you did okay let's
why am I having such a good time all of a sudden I think it had to do with when Steve was in here
with a mic over I think that was the word it was it was it was it was yesterday when Arnold's brought
the food and suddenly our whole attitude chain yeah same thing happened today I mean a show today
was a lot better but it was not great better and then Steve came in and we got him I mean nailed
him with that you know hidden mic trick and all of a sudden I feel like life was almost worth living
again I couldn't believe it worked well no because he didn't notice it and when you do like I say
you don't use the overhead you're not sensitive to it and you just the oral blivious yeah
mech green new mech green new right away and that's frightening if mech new and Steve didn't I think
that that's true that says it all absolutely Miami hello congratulations on that extraordinary
good interview with Kane he never sounded better I think we have our first first whole question
answer we're here they listen about ball Kane wouldn't know but we talked to just Charles anytime
concerning that mech why don't you go back to Chicago and drop a few bucks I know you had a lot
of fun there oh I had a great time yeah oh and we enjoyed that so much knowing that you were there
having fun yeah in fact sitting there for four hours looking right across at the ballpark and
having Harry come in and then going over that was that that was the day of my life you better
believe it all right bye thanks okay bye wow it's like like the phone was on fire all of a
she was nice but boy like wow well she didn't want to overstay her welcome you know she knew
the voice was little old for this show but she's a very nice lady 146 at W I O D and the Toyota of
Hollywood on a 441 between Tapt and Sheridan would like to send special look at wishes to rabbi
uh what was his name I don't know who pick who was on the cane chose another one of his good friends
boy has he got a circle of friends that even even Hermann Gearing would be embarrassed by that proud
but anyway if you want a great deal on the quality use car right over on the west side of 441
across from the new car lot you will find literally acres and acres of great quality
reconditioned use cars now let's face it not every car that's traded in at Toyota of Hollywood is
going to be you know great they're going to get some lemons and what they do with those I'm sure
they get rid of those privately you know what I mean or they drive me to the bay or they do
something else because when they sell you a use car they want to make sure that it's been totally
reconditioned that it's in great running shape and will give you a good dependable transportation
at a price that you can afford so instead of taking somebody else's nightmares from those used
car lots and then finding that they're out of business when you go back to have it fixed
head for a great deal on a good use car at Toyota of Hollywood's used car lot and don't forget one
of the acres there is devoted to the buy here pay here a lot for those of your real sluppers who
haven't had any credit and never will have any either Toyota of Hollywood they're on 441
right between Tapt and Sheridan in Hollywood you tell them Neil Rogers sent you by
me you know 149 at WIOD Miami hello did I do the wrong thing there hello

and then we got the twins and the Yankees in the second game of that double header at
approximately 8 p.m. tonight okay you never you never know for sure when you're playing the

terrific good call sir that's a real short crank buck is out 13 of the hour dick fuck is yeah all
of a sudden boy we've been really doing far better than I ever expected we got a slow start because
I hung up on everybody in the beginning of the show because we had a lot of stuff to talk about
now speaking of that boy Steve has got another one of those shows I'm especially fascinated by
doctor lip-aw is that for somebody it's going to be a debate how could you debate somebody named
lip-aw is it doctor doctor lip-aw is it doctor junior well anyway Joella Kane no relation to Steve
who's written a book telling me about the bag of tricks that women use to catch them
clean them out now when she says clean them out that's like money she's talking about right she's
not related to the urine leave you should know money then toss them away and discard them and just
leave them lying there in the dirt hmm and debating her and another one of Steve's famous contrived
debates will be doctor Irene lip-aw who's a lip-aw of the old block and says she's revolted by
Joella's anti female outlook and things Joella should boil an oil with bill wise and bill mullen
together in stereo yeah says it right on the sheet and then speaking to that joell and
