I'm a Cub fan and a Bud man and I trust you R2.
Daily Daily Daily
No, I thought I could do it.
Well, pretty close.
It's 10.05.
Well, we only have three cart machines,
so we can only do a little bit, right?
We had a whole thing here.
We had a real radio station.
We could do everything.
But we don't.
Just like the cart rack that's overflowing onto the floor now,
but we sure don't want to mess up the aesthetics of this room.
Do we?
How about those dolphins?
I know excuses on the phone today.
Boy, they kicked some serious, serious ass yesterday.
So I saw a good part of that game in between watching the
Cubs lose again.
But of course, it didn't make any difference because the
Mets in that a bad shame those New York teams are having a
rough time.
Even the Giants barely had a pull out that game against the
Lions, but New York teams are having a rough go, you know?
Anyway,
I know anything about it.
Is your mic on?
I hope not.
It is.
Why have you got the mic sitting so far away today?
Is this a new?
Why are you like lurched over?
And if you saw the Emmys last night, then probably you won't
call it all, okay?
Because that was so bad.
God was it bad?
And you liked it.
I didn't say that.
I said I saw exactly what you said.
By the way, at a lot, we're going to do an entire hour and
honor of that homophobic, homophobic redneck, build
Chester who works over at QAM on the call to show.
You know, rumor has it that Chester combs his hair.
He starts over here.
Listen, and combs it straight across his head.
Okay.
One of those.
Yeah.
One of those Yahoo country cousin kicking douchebags.
Okay.
What a waste of space.
Anyway, the Emmys were just horrible.
Now, there was a movie on, I know you're not going to have seen
this one.
Remember, I tell you about all these weird movies that come on
viewers' choice?
Incredible.
Grandmother's house.
Never heard of it.
Oh, man.
Bizarre.
You find this.
Really strange.
Unbelievable.
Yeah, they have all these horror.
Can I say that?
Horror.
Was that with the W?
No, that was with the two ours in the middle.
All these horror movies on.
Oh, horror.
Incredible.
Yeah.
Anybody seen grandmother's house?
They haven't even seen any in the cruiser's part two.
You know, this crowd.
Boy, I can see that we're going to have some real response here today, man.
Some incredible response.
So the dolphins could easily be two and a half, but we'll settle for the one.
They kicked some, like I said, incredible, but yesterday.
And the cubs magic number is down to nine.
And then I'm going to be here this afternoon.
So this is the beginning of a long.
Look at that phone.
Nothing.
Zero.
No, don't start now.
Okay, there's one.
Don't even answer it, Marvin.
Just forget it.
Don't try to humor us.
Okay.
There goes another one.
No, don't try to humor us.
I can tell what kind of a Monday.
This is going to be like tinkling.
Mm-hmm.
Little tinkle here.
Yeah.
Little tinkle there.
I didn't say I like the Emmy.
Oh, it was.
I desperate.
Well, don't start.
Look.
Okay, we understand you don't care and screw it.
Yeah.
Now what I like is some of the awards.
I liked.
I like some of the first of all.
They don't shouldn't even bother having the show because there's only like three shows that got nominated for all the awards.
Well, it's true.
Well, come on.
Basically, it was the same.
There had to be a little bit more than that because they're like four or five people nominated for each thing.
And then the presenters, you know, they got such a big job.
These presenters.
Who is that first guy?
John Wesley Dushbag Kent?
Who the hell is he?
I don't know who you're talking about.
I did it in and out.
Who thought he was really funny and who's there like, you know, he would look like Bill Chesser.
Oh.
Who the hell was that?
I don't know who you're talking about.
John something Kent.
Kent.
Like in Larry Kent?
I don't know.
Or Norman, maybe.
Another giant in the industry.
And it was gruesome, man.
It was just awful.
It always is.
And the presenters, I started to say they tell them don't say anymore.
The winner is you must say the Emmy goes to, which is such a crockable owning.
I mean, let's face it.
There's one winner and the rest are losers, okay?
But they don't want to do that.
They don't want there to be any loser.
So we don't say that anymore in the Oscars of the Emmys.
Now we say the award goes to.
And in spite of the fact they must have coached them all five hundred times on doing that.
About half of them still say the winner rate.
Oh, excuse me.
The Emmy goes to, which only like is rubbing salt in the wounds, you know.
And then they had that I'll tell you who I don't understand at all.
I must be either I'm getting really old.
Or this country is a lot dumber than I think it is, okay?
We don't need to do a break till about 50, whenever we feel like.
Because the first spot there is a postpone.
It'll rained out till tomorrow.
Arsenio Hall.
Did you see him on there?
Now I'm sorry, but he doesn't make any sense at all to me.
He's not funny.
He looks like he just landed on a rocket ship from Mars.
What is his story?
Why is he hip?
Why is it hip to watch Arsenio?
What are all the upies in Arsenio Hall?
His show is garbage.
I have tried to watch it a couple of times.
There's nothing to watch.
I don't like it.
It's not funny. It's not entertaining.
He sits on the edge of that chair or couch, depending on what the set is.
But he's always like right on the edge.
He's going to get up and run to the john any second or something.
I don't understand what his deal is.
And he comes out and they give him this ovation.
Oh, yes. Mr. Hip, you know, and then he gave the award.
And it was for, I don't know, some actress, some comedian or somebody.
And come get it, baby.
Come get it, man.
I thought, boy, you tacky jackass.
Why can't you just say like everybody else?
He's always Mr. Cool.
I mean, everything he does is Mr. Cool.
Okay. He's about as cool as those hot Italian sausage sandwiches that we get from up the street.
The ones with the real extra spice and peppers that burn your guts out.
That's how cool he is.
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed that show.
It's 12 and is anybody seen Graham other's house?
I've never heard of that.
See, that's another thing.
I can't relate to this audience because they don't see any of these things.
They're busy watching Peter Pan.
Now, you really think they should have seen Graham other.
I bet that there's some people.
The viewers' choice are on cable.
In other words, you can get him as premium on continental cable.
And I'm probably on some of the other ones.
Pay for view.
Right. Pay for view.
So I guarantee you that there are people out there who could have seen it.
But not in this stiff audience, man.
You ask anything.
Have you seen...
No, what do you think of talk radio?
Did you like that?
They'll talk radio.
Now, this afternoon, I can't believe how the hell am I going to do eight hours here today?
How did I ever get something into this?
Because you're going to do the whole thing.
Well, that's too much.
Well, I'm not going to leave that Neanderthal in here alone.
So Steve could say, oh, Neal picked on you too much.
You're just a sweet guy who's a little confused.
Good point.
Yeah, good point.
But Steve, I've got a few things to say to him too about the way he handles these...
These pigs that he brings on his show.
It's disgusting.
He fawns over everybody.
The more obnoxious they are and the more abhorrent their views are, the more Steve gravitates toward them.
You know what I'm saying?
I think Steve may be hanging around with Bill Chesser.
Do you think that's possible?
Because I noticed Steve has started to comb his hair from one end of the year all the way across the top of his head to the other ear.
And it's getting pretty disgusting.
So Jason Polis, that's the Reverend Virgin, is going to be on this afternoon.
And boy, Jason, I'm ready for him.
Okay? Good.
I have a feeling I'm really ready for him in his BS.
So anyway, that's all we have for you today.
We hope you have a nice day.
I'll come back in two.
And I thought that since I've got all that extra work today, you just kind of do a show now.
Hang around the building and check around to see if things are okay.
Would that be all right?
It's all right with me.
Because it is going to be an explosive show this afternoon.
I can just tell you.
I can't believe it.
I just feel in my bones.
That's going to be explosive.
It's going to be an explosive show.
Well, see?
1014 at WIOD.
This is another one of those Mondays.
Now it's interesting.
Last week the dolphins lost that heartbreaker.
And the following day on Monday, the response was great.
Remember, we were shocked.
Now they blow to England out.
They never went into England.
They blow the whole...
I mean, just at one point it was 24 to nothing.
It was a laffer.
And look at that foam.
And there's three blinking lines there weekly.
They're blinking even weekly, aren't they?
I love that best and eel show on Saturday, boy.
I got to tell you, Nick just walked in the control room.
That was put together so well.
There was part of the cousin Brucie show.
Then there was...
All of a sudden out of nowhere, it goes into a show where you had come in that Friday on your vacation to defend yourself.
Then it comes back to another part of the cousin Brucie.
That show is...
It's called AOR all over the world.
I thought that had already been on.
He puts that thing together so well.
It's incredible.
It's frightening what he does with that tape.
It is.
I thought my defensive show had already run.
No, that was on...
Well, it could have.
It's possible.
Maybe it was so good it came back for an encore.
Maybe.
That best stuff.
That's almost as good as the Dick Ferrell show.
Now when does that start on WIOD?
October 2.
We have nothing to do with and we know nothing about October 2, which is coming up pretty close.
What is today's...
18th.
September the 18th.
I'd say that's about two weeks away.
Yeah, like today.
Like two weeks from today.
Two weeks from today is the Dick Ferrell show.
Boy, that ought to really be scintillating.
Now what is this scrolled?
Remember to use the cookie into the brakes.
The rejoiner out of the brakes.
What?
And to use the transitional cart at the end of the show.
Also, the noon best of Niel is a repeat from last week because someone used my tape.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh.
See, it is a repeat.
Yeah.
So if you missed the show on Saturday, we're going to be...
In fact, we have a Tom Jicca show that we're going to be playing again this week.
It's going to be great.
Where he talks about the ratings from eight months ago.
Very timely, right on target.
Boy, look at that phone, man.
Now we got two lines ringing.
Wait a minute.
Let me just see something.
Hello.
Hey, how's it going?
Sammy, Sammy, you did great yesterday, didn't you?
Yeah, he was good for a couple of plays till he got banged up a little bit.
Yeah.
King Niel, I think.
Yeah, yeah.
Is Niel?
Can I talk to Niel?
This is Niel, sir.
Oh, it does sound like...
I don't think Marvin would make some kind of constant comment like that, do you?
No, no, no.
It sounded like he was first, but I thought it might be Marvin.
No.
Oh, you're taking this live today, huh?
Well, I don't know.
I may not take anybody at all away.
It's going.
Oh, OK.
Another Monday.
Another excuse.
This town's got more excuses than the Pope.
Is it that true?
Well, I had a call up and say, Sammy, Sammy and Danny Danny.
OK.
Boy, oh boy.
Another...
I'm sorry.
...in the suit out there.
By the way, we had the callers in line.
Now Bill Chester unfortunately had another engagement so he couldn't join us.
But we had dinner at La Tavra.
And at a Saturday night, the meal, of course, is always was fantastic.
It was just tremendous.
Good.
Now there was something I was going to start.
Oh, there was one of our groupies and his girlfriend.
Well, they were both groupies.
And they were just great.
They were just wonderful.
Although he just...
I'm sure he's listening right now, so I'm not going to say anything.
He'd rambled on a little bit.
But he had had a couple of three, four bottles of wine, I guess.
Oh.
He said he was doing his Henry Barrow routine.
Mm-hmm.
But no, they were nice.
And the food was sensational.
And everything was fine.
But I wish Bill Chester could have joined us.
Because I would like everybody in the restaurant to have watched him comb his hair from...
From just above the ear, great across his head, all the way across to the other side.
Okay.
But I wonder what he's going to be doing in a couple of weeks anyway, that Bill Chester.
Well, anyway, it's 18 past 10 at WI...
What are you laughing about?
Oh, gee, I don't know.
Oh, and then call to speak of no shame.
You know who his guest is going to be Wednesday morning at 9 o'clock.
Well, there are rumblings about this.
Stanley J. Cohen.
Oh, that's true.
Now, most of you haven't got any idea who that is, and you have no idea how lucky you are.
That's the former...
Our former boss at WINZ.
That's right.
Neil, why are you always dumping on me, Neil?
Neil, why do you do this?
Neil, don't talk to me about engineering.
I don't know anything about engineering.
Don't talk to me about programming.
I don't know anything about programming.
And I said to him one day, I said, Stanley, what do you know about?
What do you know about?
He sat there and just looked at me, why are you dumping on me?
And he's having him on Wednesday.
See, I thought he was changing to a frog years ago.
That would be like us having Bill Wise on the show.
Are you somebody totally useless, inane, and hopeless?
God.
Yeah.
What a compelling.
I think a good parallel.
Yeah.
Anyway, the Virgin Reverend Jason Polass is going to be on.
And Steve showed this afternoon, I'm going to humor him by being here to expose him for the jackass that he really is.
And I'm not pulling any punches with his cuts.
It's not going to be one of these Steve Keentai interviews where everybody kisses everybody else's butt and laughs.
Oh, like it's a big joke.
Oh, wait off.
I knew you were only kidding.
You know, that kind of crap.
See, that's Steve's problem.
He's so much into that too many years in acting or something.
I think it's all just a big game and a big joke, you know.
Anyway, it's 10.19 at W.I.
I hope you're having a great Monday.
It's a great way to start off the week.
It's obvious it's going to be really desperate.
But that's okay because our friend Rich, the chronic packter, sent me a tape with all these run-et songs on it.
Did he?
And some Dion stuff.
And we can slap that baby right in the back deck in there for things to get slow.
That's right.
So just govern yourselves accordingly, friends.
It's 20 past 10 at W.I.O.D.
The boys take.
Wow.
This is in Fred Tasker's column in the heraldous morning.
It says, under the heading, Oy Vey.
Oy Vey.
Russia shot on nears.
So the Miami-Jewish Tribune, Linda Brockman called the White House to see if President George Bush might have a greeting that she could print.
By return mail, Barbara joins me in offering Hispanic Americans best wishes for a memorable celebrate.
I mean, you talk about a bird brain.
Oh, my.
Seriously, this man, he has got to be the biggest joke that we've ever had in a while.
He makes Jimmy Carter seem like Franklin Roosevelt, okay?
That's how bad this man is.
He doesn't have any clue what's going on.
Wow.
But, oh, gosh, Jimmy, is that flag boy?
I'm pretty pissed off about that flag.
It's 1024 at W.I.O.D.
I'm getting pretty ticked off about this phone, too.
I guess nobody saw the Emmys.
Certainly nobody saw grandmother's house on Vury's Choice.
Nobody in this audience has seen anything.
They've all been locked inside somewhere, probably at Arcadia over the weekend.
And I'm really sorry that we expected something from you today.
Like maybe some response.
Oh, man, this is pathetic.
We're not answering them until we start feeling that we've got a show going.
Well, there's six calls.
Let's not answer them at all.
Let's just do scrimless because that confuses them.
How come they caught on at wins?
Okay, well, they had an upper-crushed audience over there, right?
Isn't that what they used to say?
They were worried about their image.
Oh, so they had that real upper-crushed audience.
Broward.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How are you, Neil?
Great.
Did you hear what Tom C. Restead on the network broadcast of the Cup game?
I had to watch that entire thing.
So what did he say?
Well, it's...
Other than some of the things he repeated a hundred times.
Well, besides that, it seems like the reason that the Cubs are doing so well is that they were fortunate enough to go in and play these teams when they're not doing so well.
Oh, is that it?
Like when St. Louis won five in the row and then the Cubs played him.
Apparently the Cubs caught him at a down time.
Yeah.
And like when Montreal won all those games and they beat him three in a row.
Right, and Pittsburgh won five in a row and they came in and started beating them.
Well, they started being them, but they didn't want to beat up on them too bad.
That's true.
That was kind of funny that...
How about those fillies though, how that fat crock, you know, actually on a satellite for the first time yesterday I picked up the Cardinal Network, I found it.
And there was that fat John Crock hit a grand slam in the bottom of the 12th in that first game and it was just heartbreaking, you know what?
Well, it was fun.
Broke my heart.
It just broke my heart.
But when are these people going to start giving the Cubs credit?
They don't win because these teams...
No, that's not part of the game plan.
They give them no credit at all.
All season long, all they talked about is that the Mets are the team to beat and Montreal's the team to beat.
And then of course the Cardinals were the sleeper, they were the team to beat.
And nobody will give them any credit at all.
I guess when they beat the Giants and the playoffs championship series they'll catch the Giants at a bad time.
Well, let's take it one game at a time, you know what I'm saying?
Have a good day.
Okay.
Let's take it one pitch at a time, especially with Paul Kilgis pitching tonight.
Well, you know, Zimmer has got a great sense of humor.
He wants to give the Mets fans a little bit of a chance, a little excitement.
So he's pitching Kilgis and Steve Wilson.
27 after 10 at WIO Day, we have an open line in Boca.
Boy, it's a little warm in here, isn't it?
Is it?
Yeah.
It's a little bit on the warm side.
And I know I'm never going to get this...
What is he doing?
What is Marvin doing?
Is he going to come in here and fiddle with a thermostat?
About 67 would be good.
No, no, that's not bad.
You got a sweater on.
What the hell are you talking about?
He's got sleeves down to his elbows, down to his knees.
It's 1027 at WIO Day.
Now it's going to start cooling off.
I've got eight hours to do in here.
I can't afford to be sitting here for eight hours.
Boy, that's a thick and nicklurance.
I said, boy, I'll debate that Reverend Paulus.
And then all of a sudden he comes in the next day.
How about the 18th, which is today?
I thought it was going to be in a couple of weeks.
Talk about pressure.
I got four hours of that to put up with.
Then I got to race home and see the meds in the cubs tonight.
And at 730 with Kylgis pitching for the cubs.
Boy, that's a fate worse than death.
Date County.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, you're right.
Stupid.
American Gladiators.
Saturday morning of the night.
Oh, you watched it, huh?
Oh, my God.
Joe Seisman was bad enough before.
What a joke.
What was that show they used to have where the athletes would come on and do...
Or the movie stars would come on and do all those stupid...
Are the battles in network TV?
Yeah, the Battle of the Network Dooshbag.
Right.
That at times had its moments.
Like the day that Scott Bail came on in his bathing suit.
I mean, there were days...
No, that show on occasion had its moments.
But Gladiators, I forgot to watch it.
It was so impressive.
Wow, is it bad?
Who do you have there?
You had Nitro and who was the woman?
Glisseron.
Really?
Zap.
Zap?
Right, Zap.
She was not bad.
They had another woman called Lace.
No, no.
Well, wait a minute.
Was that the one Lace?
Zap.
Zap.
Zap.
How could I forget?
I thought she had a nice green chain, Zap.
Yeah, I would never forget.
Oh, listen, I don't want to even...
I don't want to dignify that.
Spectically put on again, okay?
If I did something like that, they'd be in here and Senator Aintno way...
They would be on the phone and Jack would be out there.
Jack Fruit would be in a hallway screaming and pointing.
But he comes in here and he puts on this disgusting display again, squeezing and teasing and
pleasing and begging and owed, just disgusting.
When you see a show like American Gladiators, you know that when Petty Chiaspy wrote Network,
he was definitely ahead of his time.
That's for sure.
Incredible.
Well, all you got to do is watch Channel 7 News to find that out.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Well, Sally sends her best.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
She was all over me.
Sally?
No.
Really?
Thanks, though.
Zap.
What a story that's going to make, huh?
That would be quite a story.
Too bad we don't have that Beach Boys record to play here with that.
Now, I asked Laura...
See, now, where...
I hesitate to ask this question about this copy.
Where am I going to put it when I'm finished using it?
Because I'm sure she'll have a real clever answer for that question.
But all I asked her for was a little file folder that she could make that would go back
and have been here.
So we'd have some idea of what we're doing since the salespeople aren't supposed to just be sticking
copy in people's mailbox and under the door and on the floor.
And she hands it back to Marvin, which was just another excuse to go in there and play fast and cozy with Marvin.
And had nothing to do with doing her job.
I don't understand this joint at all.
Do you?
It's amazing.
It is amazing.
And look at that phone.
That's amazing, too.
Well, it's too bad.
Well, now there's only five lines, and we don't play that game, okay?
When the audience doesn't want to play the game, we always can fall back on our machine.
I don't want the world to know.
Like I said.
I don't want my heart to show.
It's 1031 here at WIOD.
I don't even hear myself while in the overhead.
I'm going to crank it up.
Is that a little bit better?
You're there.
You're booming now.
I'm booming.
Like boom, boom.
Okay, let's take a call from Boca.
Hello.
Nice talking to you.
Well, I haven't figured out what that is yet.
Broward?
Perhaps.
Well, screw these calls.
What I got today, you notice how I brought in my own water today?
This is incredible.
And they had this at La Tafranetta.
This is what I started to mention before.
And I got the side track down that homophobic bill, Chester.
What?
You didn't say that about him.
Yes, I did.
You did?
You just weren't paying any attention.
I said that right at the beginning of the show.
I didn't get that.
That he's a hillbilly right wing Yahoo homophobic nut.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I didn't get homes his hair all the way from one side of his head straight across to the other side.
That's the popular rumor about Bill Chester at WQAM.
Oh, I didn't get the full story.
Boy, if you could only have his hair and Ed Kaplan's teeth, you'd really have it made outside of it.
Anyway, they had the little bottles because I was talking to them about my trip to Rome,
which I probably shouldn't have done.
I don't like sounding like some big maven of an international traveler now that I've had a couple of days in Rome
and a few days in Amsterdam.
Hot shot.
Yeah, Mr. Traveler.
Hot shot.
But anyway, I mentioned about the S. Pelagrino water.
I had in Italy in the big bottles.
And they said, oh, we have little bottles of that and they kept bringing us the water all through the meal.
And they said, you can get it.
There's a Doris meat market, I guess.
Doris Italian market or something like that by the case, or you can get it at pubics.
Somebody told us.
Somebody told us.
Okay, I don't want to get Disney all upset up there.
He's so emotional.
Somebody told us.
At Publix.
Yeah, at Publix.
And they do.
And I went yesterday to my Publix over there on Cleary Boulevard, that brand new beautiful, wonderful Publix,
where they love me to pieces, in spite of Jack Fruit.
And I got a whole bunch of S. Pelagrino water.
And it's got the little, little gags.
Like Donald Little Gags.
Like what?
I'm not changing these.
Like what?
Like Don Hohwoods.
Oh, tiny bubble.
Uh-huh.
Not Don No.
Uh-huh.
Don No is good little gas, too.
That's why he always acts so agitated because he's got to get out of there in a hurry.
Agitated.
He does, doesn't he?
He always acts like, oh, geez, I just got to get out of here.
Yeah, I got to go.
And this is so good.
Boy, now I probably shouldn't do this because now they'll say,
I'll sell out in all the Publix's of the S. Pelagrino water, but it is so far,
it's so much better.
I hate to say this because I like peria, but peria is for sueds, basically, isn't it?
Uh, tiny bubbles for me.
Giant killer bubbles.
Yeah.
You know?
In fact, you can see those killer bubbles inside your body start attacking each other.
Yeah.
And then you have your fist fights and just go crazy in there.
And your whole stomach starts churning like a vat.
Yeah.
Too much for my body.
But in the pelagrino water just got, in fact, in there, you can't even see them, right?
And we drank some at the remote.
Although I guess in peria, in a bottle, you can't see them either.
Mac is not the only one you can pour it.
It's the only one you can pour it.
They just go crazy.
Those giant killer bubbles come barreling out of there.
Come kick and ass, right?
But it's hip.
It would be like watching our Cineo hog drinking peria and having brea.
That's right.
Crackers and brea.
Absolutely.
Isn't that the hip thing to do?
Yeah.
If you're a real plastic pony idiot with no life, who wants to impress yourself because
you're such a loser and such a nerd, that's what you would do, especially watching our
Cineo hog.
If he don't look like he's related to Camberal Marshall, doesn't he?
And that's not a racist.
In other words, people just say, whoa, it's because he's black.
It's got nothing to do with what color is.
He could be purple, green.
He's just a freaky looking guy.
His head is as long as some people's bodies.
And his teeth make John L. Ways teeth look like little mini-chiclets.
That's how big his teeth are.
He is the freakyest looking.
And it would be okay if he was funny or entertaining or amusing or if he could sing or do anything.
But he can.
He's just hip.
Mr. Cool.
Call me Mr. Cool.
All they need is the Saturday Night Live band and Don Pardo on that show.
And they'll have it made every yuppie, yippy in America.
He'll be watching that show, right?
With a screaming saxophone and Paul Schafer's head.
They don't need Paul, just his head.
Maybe you could audition for that show.
No thanks.
It's 10.35 at WIOD.
We're off to a terrible, terrible, terrible start on that phone or a few lines blinking
here and there.
But they're, oh man, you people are just hopeless.
And they like this show allegedly.
That's alleged.
Okay.
We allegedly have this big audience and each gigantic numbers and all these people who
love the show, but boy, they don't, they're on Monday.
They don't care.
Don't confuse them on Monday.
They have to get their lives back together again after the exciting weekends that they
have in this town.
We don't know what they did.
They were probably out there in, uh, in Carroll City watching the big taffy pull over
the weekend.
I miss that.
Chocolate Dunk.
I miss that.
The chocolate dump.
It's 10.36 at WIOD and it's the.
What?
That's.
That's.
This has become a new routine here.
Are they trying to tell me something?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's like the old days.
That's the news.
You'll notice his mic comes on in the middle of a sentence now.
It's going to start getting less and less.
I guess.
Johnny Duh-Wayne, the dance car hider.
I'm just going to play a bunch of carts.
Good.
That's the new current affair.
I guess the club was going to play.
They changed.
Well, Rod, you left it for me and I would hate to go through the entire show without
playing it.
Yeah.
Boy, I'm getting gout in my mouth.
Well, just from the ambiance of the show and I'm from eating anything.
Although I will say we want to thank the bakery at Publix for those delicious little
humontosh or whatever they are again.
Boy, I love those.
After the first 70 or 80 of them, though, you start getting a little gouty in the foot.
I see.
Broward County, good morning.
Welcome to WIOD.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Uh, you sound a little snarky today.
A little snarky?
Snarky, you know.
On the edge or something?
Not at all.
Not in the least.
Well, I, uh, until until this call.
Pardon me?
Not until this call.
Well, uh, I, uh, those are words last night.
They kind of piss me off a little bit too because I mean, you know, you're sitting on
the edge of your seat.
You're sitting on the edge of your seat?
And all of a sudden it's outstanding makeup for a series.
First of all, let me say this.
If you're sitting on the edge of your seat for that show last night, that tells me
one thing that you live in South Florida, okay?
That you have a really boring existence.
That show was pathetic.
All right.
Then the other thing.
Now, wait a minute.
Who is that guy at the beginning, John Wesley Fletcher?
Who?
I don't know.
John Kent.
Lerocat.
Who?
John Lerocat, the guy from Nightcourt.
Oh, Lerocat.
Who the hell is he?
Oh, he's on that so much.
Oh, yeah.
He's the guy that's always Lerocat at the tight ass.
Oh, who the hell wants to see him?
What the hell has he got to do with television?
He's a big television.
Oh, he's not.
No, he's not.
Well, I know these new shows are just insipid and garbage.
New Nightcourt's not there.
Well, new compared to Sid Caesar.
I don't watch it.
It's too silly.
And then they dragged out that Bob Hope again with that silly wig he's wearing now.
Did you see that wig?
And Mr. Television.
Yeah.
And to give him a standing ovation and everybody's applauding.
And a man never said anything funny in his life except to catch me a check.
That's true.
Now, do you have a problem with Tracy Omen winning Best Makeup?
I mean, do you have a problem with that, sir?
I just don't think that's the best.
You know, she just barely edgeed out.
She's just starting edge of television.
She barely edgeed out Paul Schaefer.
I got to see him, you know, smoothing with the guys, you know, and the people that win.
And, you know, let's have a little broadcast make up.
Oh, and you know what was really tacky?
This is the most embarrassing thing I think on any award show I've ever seen.
But nails.
Huh?
When the people couldn't be there to it, like, Carole O'Connor.
Oh, yeah.
To accept the awards and they did those corny things that were supposed to be funny, but weren't.
That went that stayed too long.
Oh, man.
That was pathetic.
If you can't get your ass there, you shouldn't be able to get it.
Yeah, right.
Take the award away.
Carole O'Connor doesn't care anyway.
But another thing is for us, my ass a little bit, Neil.
Please.
I'm watching this like half time at the NFL.
I've plunged my brains out.
I got the mortgage on these games.
I'm trying to find scores.
And they go to a hurricane report.
Yeah.
What's wrong with their priorities?
Oh, isn't that clipping?
Oh, but I really don't need to know about that.
That's right.
Yeah, tell me a hurricane.
You got at least till Wednesday.
You could cash in all your bets before Wednesday.
And they go away.
And they sound.
Well, I'm hoping that my bookie gets born away.
But they go away.
And the broad says, they're just ready to go away.
And the hard edge reporter, he says, well, whatever
name is in the hurricane center, Roddy,
you think it'll strengthen any of your,
do you think it'll stay a fool?
And she says, I think it's going to stay a fool.
But I want to be perfectly frank with you.
A fool is nothing to play with.
Woo, is that reporting?
And then they go back in the games,
I don't know if I need to shoot myself or what?
Well, you could have called me up.
I have the satellite.
So I watched the little bit of almost every game
that was played yesterday.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
Can I have your number please?
No.
1042 at WIOD, we're doing a little screenless.
I think we did a real service for him
because he was distraught and squirrely.
Whatever he said I was at the beginning of his call, he was.
You know what he should do?
He should make a bet on whether the hurricane will become a fool.
Oh, no, no, and what day it's going to hit.
And what day it will hit.
Oh, can you imagine all the different things in Vegas?
Yeah, get into it, sir.
Sure.
Hank, I'll take your money.
Now, what is in that little container over there?
What is that?
Look like, I don't know what that is.
Oh, Tiny sent those over for you.
Well, wasn't that considerate?
Yeah, he said, here's something special for that word brain.
I don't know.
I guess these were already here.
And I had little cookies.
From when they were, they're little tiny, tiny cookies.
Should I see one first?
See how it falls together?
Tiny.
These are tiny cookies.
Pills are sugar cookies.
These are leftover from Mike.
I'm standing.
Oh, these are good.
I'm going to take a few of them.
Then you can have the rest.
Tiny cookies.
No, they're not tiny cookies.
Tiny cookies are on the floor.
It's 1044 WIOD.
We're doing screen lists.
I don't panic.
Just aren't they good?
Cute.
They're cute.
No, they're not cookies aren't cute.
They're little.
No, they're not.
It ought to be.
The powder was right about you.
He said something about you at dinner
that you would just, if I told you on the air,
you would just plot.
He is still talking about me to this day.
About what now?
Oh, a lot.
What a lot.
Hate your guts.
Almost as much as I hate Bill Chester.
Isn't that interesting?
Mm-hmm.
These are good, huh?
Too bad we can't save any for Reverend Poulthus.
Can I say I?
Thought, called her and I.
It's gone.
It's gone to everything now.
No, and you tried to kiss his ass.
I didn't do that.
He said it was shameless and embarrassing
and it didn't do a bit of good.
Well, then, it doesn't matter what I do in that case.
It really is, I read the truth.
1045 at WIOD.
It's bait the bird day.
It's Monday.
It must be because he was real nice to me to my face.
To your face.
Uh-huh.
But that's called her.
Oh.
To your face.
Uh-huh.
Very nice and ready once said,
No, it's all right.
I don't want you to bill up your cell.
Date County.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
WIOD.
Yes, it is.
Can I take the kneel?
You're speaking to him right now.
Oh, hi, kneel.
Isn't that shocking?
Um, I'm shocked.
Oh, that's what you're doing with cleanness.
Mm-hmm.
Hello, are you?
How are you?
How easy to forget, huh?
Um, I was at specs on Wednesday.
With my daughter, we had a really great time.
Great.
Um, fact you gave her a Roger Rabbit doll.
Oh, your daughter is just a wonderful young lady.
Yeah, and she just loves you, Nia.
She's a cute as a button.
Oh, I know.
Can I say that?
Wow.
I guess I can say that.
It doesn't mean anything.
You know, huh?
She's a triple field block.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She went home.
She called all her friends.
And she said, Nia, what just gave me a doll?
And she was just so excited.
Well, she shouldn't put it that way, because then her friends will think that Nia is playing
with dolls in the house, you know?
Yeah, we can.
Although I am regressing a little bit.
That may be next week.
We don't want Jack to hear that.
No, not Jack Fruit.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I don't know.
I may have a couple more of those cookies, by the way.
Yeah.
We'll be out your neck.
We'll be out your mouth.
There's going to be another one?
I guess so.
Well, I sure hope it's a little less chaotic than the last one.
You know, I keep telling them.
By the way, is our program director back from his busman's holiday?
I don't know.
Does anybody know or care?
I don't care.
Because when I came in this morning, his door was closed.
Probably not.
Probably not back.
He is back.
Oh, aren't we lucky?
Oh, I knew there was a good reason I had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I'm happy.
But I sure hope he learned something in that seminar he went to.
No?
Unlikely.
Yeah.
Unlikely.
Well, Johnny Dark is a doll.
He's a sweetheart.
Oh, gee.
Now, you just destroyed everything you said in the first part of the call.
Right.
Not a sweetheart.
He's a fat blob.
He's a big fat blob.
He's a big fat blob.
He just stuffs that food down his face like a something.
I didn't see you guys talking to him at all.
Yeah, we were.
You were?
Yeah.
You didn't see that at all.
Anybody that would eat on the ear.
Well, that's nice that you take.
I'm not sure I'm not a sweet too.
But he's a little shy.
A little shy.
He wasn't shy when that washer and when Gloucerman was in here on Friday.
Yes.
When the food came, what are you talking about?
You're a little shy.
Except when the food came.
I don't know what they'd be.
Bill Caulder said he was a little something too, but I don't think shy was the word.
Well, listen, have a great day.
And what's your daughter's name?
Lisa and I'm Jerry.
I'll say, we don't care about you, Jerry.
No, it's just a joke.
But say hi to Lisa.
I will.
I mean, the point is we're talking to you, but Lisa's probably in the school, right?
She's in school, yes.
Yeah.
She's going to call you on her first day off.
Great.
Okay.
Well, you tell her we said hi and take good care of Roger Rabbit.
Okay.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
1048 at WIOD or a little one?
Something.
Shying.
Okay, that's our poll question of today.
I have to fill in the blank.
The bird is a little blank.
I don't think that's necessary.
I really don't think that's it.
I kind of like that myself.
What?
It's not necessary.
Yeah.
I'm going to see if I can find a card.
Uh-oh.
Are any one word?
Hmm.
Hello.
Oh, yeah.
This is just like a hyphenated word.
The word is a little unbelievable.
That's just an example.
Now, that is true.
Well, that was kind, but I couldn't find another card.
Not the one they would pick, you know, I have a feeling.
Or how about this?
The bird is a little douchebag.
Hmm.
How's that?
Oh, let's see.
There must be something else in here.
With one or two words.
That was two words.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
I can't find anything with one or two words.
I did find something that's one of your favorite cards, so by the way.
And you can just buzz off.
And you can just buzz off.
Thank you.
I know what that was.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Too bad Todd's not here to give us the whole background on that.
And too bad it was uncured.
Well, I knew that.
Why do you want to hear the whole thing?
After the break we could play the whole thing for you.
It'll make you feel better than we have time.
It's 10 to 11 at WIOD on our marathon Monday.
Oh, I can't believe I'm going to stick around here at six o'clock.
How did I ever get sucked into that?
Cutting me with that reverend virgin cutting resist.
Although I don't think it's going to last till six because I think you'll walk out.
I'm not going to treat him with that kissy poo crap like Steve does, you know.
Anything could happen.
I think you'll walk out.
Hmm.
Anyway, it's time to tell you about Nutri system right now.
Okay, 10.52 at WIOD.
Danny, through his 200th career touchdown pass yesterday in that debacle and that
trashing of the Patriots up there knowingly.
I just mentioned that in passing.
Why are you eating the crumbs?
One moment, please.
Why?
Oh, is this on now?
Just cleaning up my mess.
Yeah, but you could brush it on the floor.
It is so disgusting sitting here watching you pick the little crumbs.
You've got more cookies in the thing there.
Oh.
Well, and those are...
I can't hear cookies.
I can't hear cookies.
I can't hear cookies.
You know that I turned on.
Coming to work this morning, I was sampling a little bit because Bill had...
Well, Mike, of course, was great as always.
And Bill had Bill Chester on there with him for a couple of minutes.
And I couldn't handle it.
I just kept picturing that hair that's combed from one end.
And I punched up Alice, actually, for a few minutes.
And he had some boring guests on the phone.
And you know what's happened to their signal again?
Uh-oh.
It comes and goes, but they had cleaned it up for a little while there.
And now...
Is it really?
It's so muddy, man.
It sounds like they're doing it from a mud hole.
I'm going to have to punch up and hear it.
I never think about it.
It is so muddy.
It's unintelligible, which may be a plus.
Anyway, it's 1053 at WIOD.
And our question today, the bird is a little blank.
Dave County, hello.
Yeah, hi, I'm on a mobile phone.
Yes, sir.
Neil.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
You know the problem with all these war shows are they all stuck to the other all follow the same format.
And what I want to know is why they don't broadcast the X-ray video war.
I mean, now there are some categories you can get your head into.
Yeah, that's going to be on Channel 10 this week.
Yeah, that'd be great.
And Bishop is going to be anchored.
That's all I wanted to add.
Okay, sir.
Thank you.
You asking you got it.
1054 at WIOD.
Broward County.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Well, the bird is a little typical for his species.
It's a little bit dirty.
All birds are kind of filthy, if you know what I mean.
But, you know, they're always leaving their droppings ever for else and picking up crumbs.
But anyway, I'm going to be able to finally call you.
I've been listening for years, but I never get a chance to call because contrary to popular belief, I do have a life.
Huh.
Well, what are you doing? What are you doing here then?
I've been laid up for a basketball now for seven days.
No, I don't mean that. I mean, what are you doing in this town if you have a life?
Well, I'm trying to support myself and a wife and a couple of kids.
Oh.
You know, find and stay alive, what else?
Huh.
But...
Quite a challenge.
Yes, it is. Tell you what.
Watching that game yesterday, the dolphins were great, but unfortunately, I had to turn off the...
Audio portion of the TV and put on WIOD because that TV broadcast was just...
Oh, a lot of people do that.
Yeah, who the hell was that guy doing the color yesterday?
Man, he was in coherent.
It was that.
Oh, and then on Saturday, they had...
I was unfortunately forced into watching a little bit of college football in some of those shows.
And there was Bino Cook.
Bino Cook.
Yeah, the first call is called...
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Bino Cook can't speak four words. Who the hell are these people, man? It's the age of illiteracy.
Well, when you consider...
I think they ought to have on the next Emmy show, they have an award for the most illiterate show.
When you consider that they have people on TV like Arsenio Hall.
Yeah.
I guess the only reason he sits on the edge of it... he must have hemorrhoids.
I evidently.
I know when I see a show, it's a pain in the ass.
And in my house, there's two shows that are forbidden.
The minute they come on, they get zapped off.
If I have to throw a shoe at the TV, one of them is wheeled fortune and the other one is Arsenio.
Oh, and how about the Joey Reynolds show?
Is that on? I've never heard of that.
Well, there are a lot of people who could say the same thing.
Well, I'd be on it in four minutes by the way on Channel 10. You better catch it while you can.
I saw his disgusting body on the news when he dunked that girl on the chocolate thing.
Yeah.
He's in here, schmutz-bag.
Oh, my God, a sea sick girl.
I haven't seen anything that bad since Sam Major.
That's his whole new thing now. He seems to want to get on TV and run around naked.
That's Joey's new deal.
Well, what can I tell you?
I'm Senator Aintnoways, pretty upset about it.
Yeah, I just have to say, I'm over here at the Coral Space Medical Center.
And the nurse is very nice.
Well, I'm here.
Well, I'm here at the registration of bunch of douchebags, but I guess that's normal.
Well, what are you getting out?
Hopefully Wednesday.
Oh, just, that's good. Just in time for the hurricane.
Yes, yes, I have to, I guess, go take care of that.
And, well, what else is new?
That's about it.
From one, from one, magic number is not even one.
I think that's one other.
That's right.
And the meantime, in case my wife is driving towards the office and listening to this,
I just want to thank her for coming in and giving me a shower every morning and call her a douchebag.
Okay, good luck, you, sir.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
1057 at WIOD, we're doing screenless today.
We actually have a little of flurry on the phone there.
Nothing too dramatic.
I think Roger was just fetching about what went on here over the weekend and there were
carts and headphones and stuff all over the building.
And stuff changes on the board too, because I've got that overhead cranked higher than I've ever had it before.
And it's just about where it should be.
I got it up to seven.
Every month.
So they come in here on the weekend and they fiddle around with everything.
Every Monday we go through this and they've no management.
There's no interest.
No, no.
Well, they don't have any interest because they're busy up front there with the same two topics
that we've mentioned so many times before evidently.
I don't know, because I stay away from them and all cost.
And of course, boy, Gary's in there trying to hire some more incompetent people that I don't like.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I wonder why they bothered having that meeting with me.
Because we've made it so clear.
I've told them so crystal clear.
I mean, what we've got, we've got people running the place now who are all from out of town.
They know nothing about the market.
Nothing.
They know nothing about who these people are.
And now they're starting to decimate the rest of the radio station.
And it's like I'm supposed to say, oh, geez boy, that guy, he is.
Oh, that Alex Bennett was so good.
It was incredible.
Did I say Alex Bennett?
Yeah.
You know, it must have been a Freudian slip.
It's 1058 at WIOD Palm Beach.
Alex Bennett?
Yeah.
Is this Alex Bennett?
Hello.
Yes, sir.
The bird is a little squirly.
That's a good one.
Yeah.
As in the squirly bird.
That's right.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Short and sweet on the Palm Beach line.
I even put them on hold.
I was so moved by his call, but there he goes.
Well, that's going to do it for this first hour.
I feel guilty about this hour, don't you?
Why?
Well, we didn't do anything wrong.
No.
It's them.
Oh, it's you.
Always.
It's you.
Anyway, we're going to get out of here for a, no, Dorothy McIntyre is doing the 11 o'clock news.
Henry got so emotional when he was doing that wine thing that I've rested for this morning.
That he just had to go out and see if it was as good as he said it was.
He has his own brand.
Is that what they said?
He has his own wine.
He's got his own van.
Okay.
That he just sits in it on the weekend.
Dorothy McIntyre is going to bring you that exciting 11 o'clock news.
I'm sure we're going to hear a lot about Hugo, man, till it's coming out of your ears.
And then we'll come back at 11 o'clock.
And don't forget this afternoon on the Steve Cain show.
I'm going to stick around, at least as long as the Reverend Virgin will stay here without
leaving.
And give him the facts of life.
On Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD.
From the fin of our days, 60s WNBB.
Okay, it's 11 o'clock, it's 6 o'clock, WIOD.
And we're back for our second hour.
It's a Monday feels just like Friday.
I feel like at two o'clock I'm ready to go home and crash for the weekend.
Friday?
Yeah.
We already had that.
No, no, it feels just like Friday to me.
You're not going to believe this, but Steve is vying to become the new Larry King because I just...
I'm not going to mention any names, okay, but I just happen to run into somebody I'm...
No names.
Never met the person before in my life.
Oh, no.
And he said that Steve owes me $5,000.
Don't be 50 dollars.
So Larry is like a piker by comparison.
What?
Yeah.
Good lord.
It doesn't just go back to that Bill Mullin memo about the $300 and some odd.
Remember?
No.
Bill Mullin memo?
Oh, you were gone?
I must have been gone.
You must have been gone.
Yeah.
Oh, it's scathing memo.
It was like the day after that orgasm show.
Oh.
I remember that show.
And there was a scathing memo, only part of which I could read on a year in which Mr. Mullin just said,
by the way, I want that $350,000.
I fronted you months ago.
Ah!
Back now.
What is going on?
It's going 50 dollars.
What is going on?
Anyway, it's $1107 at WIOD.
We're doing a little screenless.
I see during the news break that the lines all went out for a while.
Now they're starting up again.
These people don't have the same...
Where the hell did that come from?
I felt it in my...
You know, of all the things that is a clue.
The plastic, the beak, the magic beak from the spec...
Of all the things that could have brought from the remote that we left there.
That's the best.
You know, we left all kinds of things we forgot in all the chaos.
One thing.
Can I see that for a minute?
One thing made it back to the station.
Do you think if I wore this during my debate with Reverend Virgin this afternoon that it might...
It might throw him for a loop?
What a great idea.
As you could loop.
It's the bird beak.
Yeah.
Does it do anything?
Yeah, it says a lot.
When you got glasses, it's perfect.
But for you, of course, it's you.
Anyway, Bokin, Pong Beach, our ringin, we're doing screenless.
So until they start ringing...
Oh, wrote a little music.
Well, the fact good or what?
He's holding his hand.
He's talking about this girl.
Well, are we Dion intensive or what?
We sure are great at him to come by on Wednesday and Shmoos around with everybody.
It was great.
And we sold a lot of his stuff there, boy, on Wednesday.
We sold a ton, didn't we?
They cleaned out the shelf.
Did they collect them in?
Mm-hmm.
That's good.
So where's that brown paper bag with all the money, Dion?
Pong Beach just lit up here.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Are you dead?
Good.
Is that it?
Yeah, that was it.
Good Pong Beach call.
Are you doing?
Good.
That's Pong Beach call.
And that's it.
Well, he had nothing to say.
He just didn't want to feel guilty.
He didn't want all his fellow Pong Beach counties to have to feel like a bunch of morons who have nothing to say.
Broward County, hello.
Oh, no.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no.
Just the same.
Dave County.
Okay.
Let's go for a clean sweep.
Okay, let's get those brooms out.
Broward.
All right.
Dave.
Do you hear that?
In the background.
There's a nattering noise in the background.
Nail.
Nail.
What?
What?
That's it.
Okay.
A lot of short calls today.
You notice?
Volka.
I get nothing to say.
Okay.
All right.
Everybody who has this is good.
I like this.
This could be a new format.
Everybody who has absolutely nothing.
It's not a new format.
That's the usual one.
That's what I thought.
All right.
How about everybody who has less than nothing to say?
Get right on that phone.
Okay.
Less than nothing.
Palm Beach.
Do you have nothing to say?
Nail.
Yeah.
Is Joey on?
Oh, that explains it.
Oh, God.
That explains it.
No wonder they're trying to watch Joey and listen to the same time.
They want to be able to hear the show.
Right.
So they don't want to interrupt Joey's melodious tones by speaking.
Isn't that it?
What do you think?
Is he doing smeg green again today?
We should check.
No.
No.
No, we have to keep our eye glued on that radar.
Just in case Hugo likes to...
Tipping into that picture somewhere.
Hmm.
Do you think we have some appropriate...
Something we could play in the background in case Hugo does start approaching...
South Florida.
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, that's a good one.
Oh, that's a good one.
That's a good one.
I got to confess.
We borrowed those from Renieri.
Now you see the answers for Renieri's tremendous success over the years are right.
Right in that cart rack.
Okay, it's 12 minutes past 11 and W.I. of D.
Laura never did bring me my folder.
Are you somewhere in the building, Laura?
Well, maybe it was that rough weekend.
You know that she went.
Where did she say they went?
Marco Island with Scott.
Oh, God.
The old story.
Yeah.
This is the Scott that she was abandoning.
That was leaving the sinking ship and now all of a sudden it's all...
Yeah.
Kissy poo and back together again.
I've seen it over.
No wonder she didn't bring me that folder for sports channels.
You'll see the Metz and the Cubs at 7.30 tonight.
And if you don't have sports channel of Florida, what's going to happen is you're going to miss
the entire National Hockey League season.
Which is shameless, okay?
And the best part of it is we've been telling you for months the way to get sports channel of Florida is to call your local cable company
and demand it.
And it is working.
Now, Jones and her cable got it a few months ago thanks to this campaign.
And since we talked last about sports channel of Florida, telecable of Margate,
has just launched sports channel.
The people in Margate found out if you call and bitch and scream and complain like crazy, it does work.
So pick up that phone right now today and keep calling until they give you what you want.
You get all the great sporting events, including Gator football and all kinds of major league of baseball.
That remains in the season and the whole National Hockey League season.
And lots of other great sporting events that you won't find any place else.
You tell them you want sports channel of Florida and you want it.
Now, Marvin, you want it.
Now, that's not even Dion's not on here.
That's just the Belmont.
And that's not one of their good records.
Belmont's had a couple of good records.
Like, come on, little angel.
And I need someone.
Those were their two big hits.
But I guess they didn't want to put these on here because Dion would have got enough set.
Well, wouldn't he?
He doesn't want anybody to know that they had a couple of hits without him.
It's 1115 at WIOD.
This is the Steve Kane warm up show today.
We have the Reverend Jason Virgin coming on.
Reverend Poulthus.
Again.
And we're going to try to get for the 80th time this month.
And it's only the 18th of the month.
But I guarantee you that he, there's a good chance that he's going to get up and walk.
Because I'm going to really, I'm not pulling any punches with his douchebag.
Okay.
He's not just some sweet misguided individual.
Okay.
He's typical of the brainwashed right wing militant, hateful, dictatorial, intolerant douchebag.
Okay.
He's a born again idiot.
And if he can't handle, you know, if he thinks I'm going to sit here and do a goody two shoes routine,
it's going to be the shortest show in a history of mankind.
Steve can do baseball cards.
It's 1116 at WIOD.
If there's anybody in the audience that Steve owes money to, we certainly invite you to call in.
I could be here.
Some real interesting radio.
Dave County.
Hello.
Uncle Neil, how are you today?
Okay.
Listen, my name is Jack and I have a law practice in Carl Gables.
And I have a new client this morning.
Covering yourself accordingly, sir.
Yes, his name is Tiny.
And he says he's putting something from Woody Spells and he says he's covering yourself accordingly.
Okay.
Well, I'll cut him down as soon as I get home tonight.
And what do I do?
Okay, Jack.
I wonder if his last name was Fruit Bunny.
I think so.
As in Jack Fruit.
Okay, Dave, there's one line not flashing and Dave, there it goes.
Boy, doesn't that give you a feeling of power to see that?
Isn't that exciting?
Not really.
Mm-hmm.
Broward.
Oh, they're watching Joey.
Are you watching Joey?
Are we interrupting you, sir?
Ma'am?
It?
No.
Oh.
I ain't called by expiry port.
Yeah.
He said Friday night, Joe brought your name up and he said, uh, I heard Neil's been bashing me
in a Fitzgera week.
I forget about doing the breeders cup with me.
Oh, jeez.
Is that a threat?
Is that a little threat?
No, I want to tell you what Hank can do with the breeders cup and don't get me wrong because I love horse racing as you know.
I can go out there and sit in a press box with my real friends and Hank and stick the broadcast where the Mondo and Shine, okay?
Oh, just like that.
Typical, that's typical Hank.
If indeed he said that, you could be just making it up to the trouble.
But you don't sound like the kind of guy to me that would make that up.
I'm a mess fan.
Would I make anything up?
No.
At this point, you'd have to start though.
I think I'll work.
I give the cups all the credit in the world.
No, we're trying to give you a shot at these next two nights.
I mean, if you guys can't be killed, you're sorry, I'd give them the mess up for suckers, okay?
All right, Neil.
Take care, buddy.
How you doing?
Oh, fine.
All right, it sounds good.
Take care, buddy.
Thank you, sir.
Now, Joey's doing, Lord, look at that.
What is wrong with this, man?
Doesn't he want this show?
Doesn't he want to be working?
Did he enjoy being out of work that much?
First of all, last week we turned it on his first show,
and he's running around half naked doing, what was he doing?
What's that?
The best answer, the best answer, I think.
Now he's doing, who's that guy?
Now he's doing aerobics, and, oh, look at him with that puppet hanging out there.
Who are you kidding, Joey?
He thinks he's the Regis Filmin of local TV.
Uh-huh, that's right.
Oh, Joey, give us a break.
Well, you look at that, and a butt that looks like Arlene Ross,
and I'm on a bad day.
It's embarrassing.
Oh, God, look at those, look at the sneakers he's got on there,
up to his knees.
I can't believe it.
Wait a minute, wait till they show those sneakers.
Oh, no, and now his puppet is hanging out.
Get out of here.
Just have the other guy take his clothes off.
There you go.
Well, that guy's all hairy and everything, isn't he?
From the neck up, that guy's pretty good.
But boy's got to hear like a fur ball.
He's kind of like Ron Jeremy.
No, not that bad.
Look at that, Joey.
Just he.
Joey, look at, now look at those sneakers.
Look at that.
Look at that.
They come up to his armpits.
Oh, this guy did.
Oh, brother, talk about him and stick.
Of course, he never did have a show anyway.
So I was just trying to think of something else he could be doing.
That would be a little more entertaining.
Tough.
Yeah.
Like maybe staying home.
It would be a good idea.
Okay, it's 1119 at WIOD.
If you're in a place where you can't see Channel 10.
Maybe at WNWS can put the audio from this one and kill a half hour right there.
Maybe they'll just signle cast Channel 10 all day.
Wouldn't that be great?
It could be a exclusive format at WOLD.
Yeah, it could happen.
Boy.
And there's that poor young lady there way on the right.
She's like, they don't like her or something.
She must be ugly.
She got right here.
Because all I keep doing is showing Joey in this young guy here.
The one that's got a little bit too much hair or otherwise would be sensational.
Oh, sorry, Jack.
Well, no, he's pretty old.
Is he at least 25?
I would say 23.
Maybe 26.
Ancient.
Okay, here's the bokeh.
Hello.
Bill.
Yep.
How you doing?
Okay.
I was calling to see if you've ever seen Reverend Paul Wilson Jack in the same place before.
20 past 11 at WIOD.
It is something to think about.
Look at him, boy.
That Joey's got wrinkles on his wrinkles.
See, it says buffalo on his t-shirt.
Yeah, I think that's an omen.
Look how big his, do you see how fat his legs are?
Oh, Joey.
Please.
That would be like Hank Goldberg going on and doing calisthenics on the Channel 4 news.
Whoa.
Do you believe he really said that?
That if I've been knocking him, I can forget about the Breeders Cup broadcast.
Hmm.
He can stick that broadcast right in his bazooko.
Okay, I don't give a damn.
Hmm.
I couldn't care less.
I'll go on with Bob Savage on KAT.
I've already been invited.
Hmm.
There you go.
No, I'm not going to do it.
I'm not having anything to do with Hank.
He's just such a...
He can dish it out as that guy from Hallembe used to say, he can dish it out but he can't
take it.
Uh-huh.
Kind of like Don No.
Oh, look at there it is.
There's the simulcast news.
Look at that.
Isn't that great?
Oh, look at Little Laura came and she gave me my folder.
That was so nice because I didn't know where to stick it.
21 past 11.
I had some ideas, but I didn't want to say because it's a family show.
Look at that.
I witness news.
They should call it ear witness news on W.S.
News.
Isn't that cute ear witness news here and Bishop?
I've never tried that.
And you're driving your diesel truck home from work.
Listen to Anne.
And I do what the quality is like or have never heard that.
Well, if the quality can't be any better than what it is during the daytime.
Oh, boy.
By the way, we had some of Sandy's sugar cookies in here this morning.
They were sensational.
It gave my goose bumps just thinking about it coming back.
Coming back to it.
The sugar cookies might go in there.
Anyway, you want some.
All right, just a moment now.
How does that look?
Makes me really wonder what I look like with that on.
I got the beak.
I can't imagine.
Should I do the whole show with Reverend Poulis with a beak on it?
It's really something to think about, isn't it?
Although you can't breathe.
That's the only problem.
Well, minor problem.
Oh, boy.
What are they?
What are they cooking on there?
Is this Joey show with the chef now?
Rice.
Oh, great.
Oh, jeez.
Ooh.
That string on there is a little bit tight, you know what I'm saying?
Well, okay.
Let's take some calls here and quit screwing around.
We've got a very important show today.
Our topic for the date is the Steve O.U. Money.
And let's go to date county.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
You're going screenless.
Yes, sir.
Not exciting.
I've only said it about 40 times.
But don't feel bad.
Nobody else catches on either.
Oh, okay.
That was very slow audio.
Well, the thing is, I was watching TV and I turned on Joey.
I wasn't really listening to you.
I'm sorry.
But I was watching Joey and I got a great report.
It's funny.
Joey almost dropped that on TV.
Really?
He's doing these aerobics.
Well, I know he died on the sheet.
He's doing these aerobics.
He's got the body of Johnny Dark.
His waist is 10 inches bigger than his upper body.
I mean, he is...
I never, I never watch him because I was usually at work.
But he looks like he's about 85.
How old is he?
No one ever knows, huh?
84.
All right.
Well...
No, he did...
This thing he's doing with these trying to be Mr. Physical fitness.
Oh, you're watching it.
Oh, we turned it on.
And I lost my appetite.
I was going to ask Arnold to bring in Wayne to bring in some food today.
But I just got sick when I saw that.
Well, the cops did okay this weekend.
Yeah, they lost two out of three.
But they still knocked that magic number down.
That's all I count.
I want to back into what you understand.
I was listening to the meds game on the radio going out.
And it's like, oh, the meds are just about to turn it off.
You know, it was like, what did it end on Saturday night?
It was like 10 to 1.
10 to 1, that was it.
That was it?
That was the end of the game?
Yeah.
Well, for all you meds fans, they looked real good.
And yesterday they got beat one nothing, by the way.
I just mentioned that in passing.
Uh-huh.
All right.
All right.
Well, I'm out of material.
Since I haven't been listening to the show then, you know, I just want to tell you that report about Joey that he almost dropped that.
Well, it's funny because we must be on a psychic vibration because we turned it on and you turned it on.
So it goes to show you there's something there.
That must be it.
Okay. See you.
All right.
So 1127 at WIOD where he are doing screenless today.
Did we say that often enough?
Screenless.
I mean, just to get a ring on there and let a ring as long as you feel like.
And if you get tired, get lost.
What is he standing in the background?
He's standing right behind his guest.
You notice that?
I think that's a good shot, Joey.
Stand right behind all of your guests.
This guy's just doing like rice and more rice and more and more and more.
Is he going to put anything in it?
That's it.
They did put things in it.
Like what?
They put eggs and...
They put veggies and they put things in it.
Look great, didn't it?
No.
See, there's all this stuff in it.
What?
There's a couple of onions and a piece of Joey's hair.
Yeah.
That's about it.
Oh, fat.
Okay, well that's a great show, isn't it?
That's the most appetizing show.
If you didn't lose your appetite from watching Joey with his puppy hanging out doing aerobics,
this recipe will definitely do it.
Oh, God.
Dave County, I just did that line.
Are you there?
Hello.
You are there while I was afraid of that.
Yes.
Who is this?
Neil.
Neil?
Yeah.
Hey, I'm calling about this...
Archie him.
Yeah.
What do you think of Pat Sayjack?
Oh, the worst.
What do I want out of here?
Boring.
Yeah.
What I figured.
Yeah.
You're knocking on Archie, you know, I think it's pretty good.
For what?
What does he do?
Is he funny?
I think he is, if you...
It's just like your show.
I mean, the first time I heard it, I thought it was ridiculous, you know?
Yeah.
Well, it is.
You've got to watch Archie, you know, a little more often to get, you know,
get his little tricks, a little small, little teeth, or a big teeth out of you know?
Well, I will get...
I confess that we can't compete with his teeth.
There's no question about that.
Right.
Even John...
Even John L. White can't compete with our Cineos teeth.
Yeah, but you know, the guy's got a nice smile and a little goofy and a big laugh.
Well, good.
And we'll put Henry Barrow on here with his own show.
He's got a nice smile, he's a little kipsy.
Okay, I'll try it again.
All right.
Briefly.
Okay.
I don't think so.
I've watched him several times, that's just always that same...
I don't like it.
You know, he's got the crowd out.
He's on drugs, I think, the audience, they must be.
And he's just sitting on the edge of that chair like he's going to do a Mexican tap dance or something any second.
And he's bending...
He's almost on the floor as a matter of fact at times.
He's crouched, he's not only sitting on the edge of the chair, but he's hunched forward.
In other words, like his body is too big to sit up and get on camera with the guest.
If he sets straight up, his head would be missing from the shot.
You know what I mean?
And yesterday on the Emmys last night, he had this wide jacket on.
I mean, he's not a fat guy.
He's kind of skinny, but he had this wide, silly looking jacket on.
Often.
He does.
Does he?
Yes, I've seen that before.
Very strange.
Very strange, dude.
But he's hip man, he's in.
If you watch our Cineo man, you've got it made, right?
And a little perier.
And breathe.
Palm Beach.
Palm Beach.
Oh, don't say that Palm Beach hung up on us.
Well, that would be a surprise.
Was that a dressing and depressing and unusual and bizarre and unacceptable?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
How terrible.
It's enough to make me want to go back to music, isn't it?
Isn't it?
I think we've heard enough Dion.
With all due respect to our good friend Dion, let's not overdo it.
You know, I think we need to get him out of the machine.
Cool him out for a little while.
I feel very bad about that cap, Dion.
He autographed it.
In fact, it's just the same cap he's wearing on your, Frank.
Yes, it is.
That's that schmata that he wears on his head all the time.
Yes, and he gave us each our own autograph one and the tiny.
Chuted up with an a few minutes of my getting home.
Dion, please.
Yeah.
And I strapped him to that ceiling fan, turning it on high.
And then he was sweating when I took it out.
So I put him in a closed dryer for about a half an hour.
Woohoo.
Let's see.
Call me 50 dollars.
It's 131 to W.I.D.
Those were the cookies and don't say nothing bad about my baby.
We do have a line in Voka and Palm Beach not ringing on a screenless Monday.
It's a very week day and we don't understand quite why, but we're used to it.
There's a big article in here.
Our friends at Char Hot, by the way.
Yeah, still a little paper is that.
The Fort Laundry.
It's in the Miami Herald and the Broward.
What do they call these?
Business Monday.
Is it?
Yeah.
Business Monday.
Yeah, it's on page 1BB.
1BB.
Oh, yeah, it's on the front page.
Is that the front page?
First page you open.
No, it's the first page you open to, yeah.
Page.
And it's all about Char Hot.
It says Char Hot owners are doing it their way.
And of course they are doing great and their stuff.
You know what I'm really getting into big now?
Because you know I love the Italian sausage.
Is the hot dogs.
They have got great hot dogs.
And lately I've even been foregoing the Italian sausage.
And I get a couple of hot dogs.
But anyway, it's a whole story about the owners and about how they've grown slowly.
But they're making all this tons of money and their businesses up.
And it talks about, it says about their promotion.
And they're quoting the owner, Joe Camissa.
And he says we use direct mail, newspaper coupons, talk radio.
We do a lot of talk radio, Camissa said.
And that's it.
The Harold of course, no they don't do other talk shows.
They do this show.
That's the Harold.
And the Harold of course wouldn't put that in there.
Who wrote this article?
Gina Carroll.
Gina, I hope that you fall off a ladder today and you break your arm.
And it's painful and it's in a cast for seven months, okay?
Because you know damn well that he talked about the show, right?
Sure.
Of course he did.
Stinkers over at the Harold of just like that Bill Cosford.
It's the same kind of paranoid, parochial, little neurotic attitude that they've got over there at the Harold.
Right Gina?
Don't you agree?
Oh, is it a question?
Okay, 1133 at WID.
I just wanted you to say that.
So Calder could rip you tomorrow.
There is no question.
By the way, we want to say a special hide a Bill Chaser over there who is at present the newsman inside kick in the morning on the Bill Calder show.
So what is it?
EDR?
QAM.
But I underline that at present.
Yeah, I just mentioned that in passing because I think when Stanley Cohen comes in there on Wednesday and sees that Bill has combed his hair from one side of his ear all
away straight across his head, he'll say, gee, Bill, can't you do something better than that Bill?
I can't.
I still can't believe he's going to put Stanley Cohen on here.
Yeah, what's that all about?
I don't know.
Well, I think he wants to embarrass him.
All Stanley's got to do is say hello and that'll do it.
Hello, Bill.
Oh, man.
Although I will say this for Stanley as bad as he was and he knew nothing and he admitted it.
He was a brain surgeon compared to Tim Williams through a rocket scientist.
Okay.
Anyway, everybody ought to suggest to the Charlie Hut people.
I haven't seen it for a long time if they would get white hot.
And they could fly them in, you know, frozen by the cases.
We talked about rosters or swigals or pico.
And I'm telling you that would increase their business by a ton, white hots.
And they've got the perfect hot sauce to go along with it already.
Could be like the South Florida Don and Bob's.
But, you know, sooner or later they'll take mine.
It's like around here.
They won't listen to me about anything.
It's the same thing.
Even though I have this tremendous influence, they pay no attention, anything that I say.
Okay, Broward County.
Hello.
Okay, yes.
Oh, women.
Yeah, women, women, women.
Broward, hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Neil.
Yes.
I'm a longtime listener at the first time calling.
Well, that's terrific.
And I got the answer to what you were talking about.
Okay, the bird is...
The bird's a little butt kisser.
That's cute.
Yeah.
Maybe you ought to be with you on a meat.
For me, um, Reverend Verge is the evil kisser but...
Oh, I don't think the Reverend Wala Reverend might like that.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Well, I like to call a couple people at Beastbags.
Mm-hmm.
I can't hear you and Danny and Mark and everybody at the office.
Okay.
They're all at Beastbags.
Amen.
All righty.
Govern yourself accordingly, sir.
I will.
Okay.
All righty.
Bye-bye.
And don't forget what it says in the good book.
The good book.
The good book says, let's stone everybody to death and let's see everybody frying oil.
Let's get a bunch of locusts to come down and destroy your house.
And the good book.
The good book.
Don't you love that?
The good book.
Well, you're going to hear...
In other words, I hate your ass because the good book says, hate thy neighbor is thyself.
Doesn't that...
Isn't that what it says?
Well, you're going to hear about this this afternoon.
Hey, I got news for you.
He's going to get an earful like you never heard before.
You know, people that run around quoting Neanderthal, primitive Neanderthals,
from thousands of years ago, it's embarrassing.
I said to somebody over the weekend, I said, the reason the world is as screwed up today as it is,
is because we have all these people with all their different cults and religions running around,
quoting people who lived thousands of years ago, superstitious, idiotic,
moronic people who lived thousands of years ago, and it says it is written such and such.
I mean, don't you find that embarrassing?
It's pathetic.
But anyway, it's 21 till noon at W.I.D., I mean, in our lifetime,
didn't we see, like, in the deep side, then we see Mississippi burning?
That was only 25 years ago.
Same thing based on you.
Yeah.
Based on those wonderful good book, in fact, they used to use the scripture to justify the segregation.
That's right.
Absolutely good book says, good book says.
It's a right movie.
It reminds me of these rednecks, these Yahoo bigoted nasty rednecks
that go to church and all, y'all have a good day and I got a good Lord willing.
You know, stuff like that.
I want to mention witchner, a good Lord willing.
But when he used to say that, he still says that.
Oh, God.
Well, I don't listen to him.
But I mean, when he, oh, geez, when I worked over there, a good Lord willing.
If you could hear the stuff, he says off again.
I'm serious.
You would just pass out on the floor.
I mean, he gives the word bigotry a whole new meaning and shape and definition.
Oh, the good Lord willing.
Oh, I got my three fifty seven magnum on my Bible.
Okay, it's 20 till noon at WIOD.
Boka, hello.
Boka is gone.
Well, that's not unusual even when we do screen.
They're gone.
Dave County is gone.
Okay, giving a new meaning to the word screenless today.
It's called answerless.
Dave County is gone.
All right.
Broward is.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, what a disappointment.
Did that guy still cackling?
Yeah.
I can't stand it.
Oh, no.
I haven't tried to cry, Neil.
Maybe that would improve.
Well, now let me get this straight.
What your subway is.
Let me understand if I understand your subway.
Are you going to start right off the bat?
Are you going to start?
Are you going to start?
Yeah.
He started it.
That sounds like something a child would say in kindergarten.
He started it.
Well, fits with the conversation.
I think you can mature a adult like this caller.
Yes, that's a good point, Mr. Neil.
Now, let me ask you one question, Mr. caller.
Yes, Mr. Nurd.
Nurd, yeah.
Gee, it's funny.
This guy's on the same wavelength that I am.
Well, that is true.
We've known it for years, Neil.
Oh, don't just start.
Who is this?
This isn't Steve from Hollywood.
Oh, God, you're remarkable, Neil.
Oh, geez, we don't want to talk now.
I know that I'm not even going to waste my time.
I ain't any of you.
Oh, no kidding.
Call Calder, will you?
No, call us.
Really?
I can't get this thing open.
Oh.
Boy, this has been a hell of a-
Look at that.
There we go.
Is anybody out there, if you want to make a lot of money,
come up with a new way to package CDs.
Okay, these just don't work.
What are you worried about?
There was only Steve from Hollywood.
He's a real outwards.
He's a genius.
I found out.
Pain in the neck.
It's the real thing.
In the back of your mind.
Watch your whole face define.
Is the real thing.
It's the real thing.
Coconut is the way it should be.
Coconut color.
What do I want to see for you?
Is the real thing.
Coconut color.
Okay, that's enough.
By the way, it's already the 18th of September.
Shouldn't the suckers be coming very soon,
like in about three weeks?
What happened to that calendar?
You know, I gave that to you,
and that's the last we ever saw.
Wow, it's probably around somewhere.
I think my mic cord's a little short.
Here we go.
Ah!
Let's see, here's an asterisk.
Here's some of my Nutri-System Cream of Tomato Soup.
Here's some Q-sheets for discs that we don't have yet.
Any IOUs in there from Steve, anyway?
There's one right over there.
Yeah.
And there's a little note.
He's got a little picture of Hank here.
Now, Steve may not be right about too many things,
but he's right on target when it comes to Hank Goldberg.
You know my best friend?
He is a sour-puss, just a trouble-making.
All you got to do is cross-hank once,
and he will go to the ends of the earth to destroy you.
That's the kind of guy he is.
He's a vicious, backstabbing, no good, mung-hit.
He really is.
I am really surprised.
See, Hank was one of those people I used to get along with fine,
because I never saw him.
Right.
You know how that is.
That's right.
One of those distant friends out of sight, out of mind,
that kind of stuff.
Plus, he used to rip off all my material
and try to be the neorodgers of sports.
You know, that was his big, you know,
calling Miami a Bushley town,
which I had done years before.
But that was Hank's whole thing.
Now, the guy calls, well, I thought the guy was going to tell me
some little humorous anecdote, didn't you?
I hope.
And instead, his response is, well, if he's ripping me,
he can forget about that breeder's cup of broadcast,
like my livelihood and my career are hinging on whether I go on the air
with Mr. Tout.
Okay.
I don't need to be on the air with him, all right?
Mr. Tout and Mr. Pout.
They took his horse down.
It's, take him down.
Take him down.
I can't find it.
So somebody, one of our Hasidic friends will call in certainly
and give us the, what are you laughing about?
You think we don't have Hasidic listening to the show?
I believe we could pay us down to their puppet and their
Yarmulka, their Robbie Benson Memorial Yarmulka.
Well, we could call it the Robbie Benson is Jewish.
Of course.
And I have seen proof.
We could call George Bush.
Do you think Robbie Benson is ever going to change?
I mean, he's cute in all of that,
but he's cute to the point now of being disgusting,
because he's about 35 years old, isn't he?
Now, I used to make comments about him and used to just get so upset.
Well, I understand, but I mean, I thought he would start changing.
He still looks the same, doesn't he?
I've been saying this for years.
Well, yeah, well, you'd some food.
Not a lot, not a lot, because I'm already like just bursting
if the seams from that great public's home and touch.
Home and touch.
No, those aren't home and touch.
No, they're little Danish.
It's sort of like Gentile home and touch.
Bill Cossack is your home.
Yeah, Bill Chester would like him really.
Yeah, they have a little burning cross.
I need one.
Bill Chester would love these.
Okay.
Boy, oh boy.
I hope one day he goes to comb his hair
and his comb accidentally like digs into his bald head.
We're talking about Bill Chester, not Bill Coder.
And his comb like digs in and like bluds spurts out
and there's nothing in there.
You know what I mean?
It like opens up a cavity.
Boy, I got a great line for that.
But I'm not going to use it today, not on the air anyway.
Okay, let's go to what should we do?
I get lost when I do these screen lists,
because most people aren't there anyway.
Dade County's here, right?
Yeah, I have to tell you, I love when your best friend says,
if I was a bedding man, which I'm not,
as soon as I hear that line, that just confirms it.
You don't mean my best friend Hank?
Oh, oh.
He said that?
Yeah.
But I have to confirm.
Well, I got news for you.
He can forget about that reader's cup broadcast.
He can do it with Joe Zagaki and make it real exciting.
You know, he worked.
I like Joe.
He works right across the street from me.
The other day I was driving by there and I waved
when he flipped me off.
Oh, please.
Tom, I flipped this.
And he probably got some type of personal problem he doesn't want to talk about.
Listen, did you happen to catch that superhero?
I thought you wanted to think he sure ate.
He filled his fat face that day we had him in here a few months ago, boy.
I sure did was nice and friendly.
Well, you guys, well, he did was sit here and eat for four hours.
That's what friends are for.
No, it's not four months ago today.
Was it?
How do you know that?
Well, it was May 18th.
It was my birthday.
May 18th was four months ago.
June, July, August, September.
You're right.
It's a long, long time.
Four months ago today.
Wow.
What is this phone?
Hey, that yours or mine?
Yours.
Did you catch the superhero show this week?
What the hell is going on on the phone?
I think Hank has got a hold of your phone line.
Let me look his wisdom.
Why?
Let me see if he's hanging on the telephone, Paul.
What is that?
I don't know.
Daddy.
Are you sure it's on my line?
Yes.
Hey, come down.
Love that hill.
Anyway, how was that show Saturday morning?
What?
I didn't watch it.
We have already discussed that.
But if you would have been listening instead of worrying about where Hank is climbing.
That's called American Gladiators.
Yeah.
I don't know.
It's got that the Nitro and Glissorant.
But I thought it left an indelible impression on your heart.
And Zap.
What?
Nitro, he was pretty good.
Yeah.
And how was she going?
Great.
She was interesting.
Yeah.
That's the word.
She's never going to be the same after sitting on your lap.
You were seeing.
She carried me out of the studio, Phil.
But I heard you slip the other day and said you had a girlfriend now.
Who me?
No, no, no.
That wasn't a slip.
Oh, because you'd never mentioned her before.
Well, so.
Phil, listen.
Oh.
Too personal.
Yeah, we don't get into that.
I know, you'll never get to personal.
Oh, no, no.
No.
So you can't.
You can't tell us anything.
I can't.
I said, I won't.
Why would you like to know?
Yeah, what do you want to know, Phil?
Just curious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what curiosity did to the cat.
Well, it's too bad I can't be on that Readers Cup broadcast.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not messing around with Hank Goldberg.
He's just a sour-puss and a fat slob.
I mean, I'm a fat slob but I admit it, but he doesn't admit it.
I heard Ernie is going to be doing the breaders cup anyway.
You may want to have.
Ernie and Norm Kent.
Okay.
Good day.
Like that phone line.
It's 11 till noon at WIOD.
If you're so, if you're like I am and you're just sick and tired of all this nonsense, you know,
and you want to get away from it all and go out and have a great meal tonight, take Paul Harvey's girlfriend or somebody anybody you want to go with.
That's Paul Harvey Jr's girlfriend.
I want to emphasize that.
You don't have to write the letter Jack.
Okay, we're talking about Paul Harvey Jr.
Okay.
The melting pot in Southmont.
Okay, we have some exciting news.
Sookas is coming Saturday and Sunday October 14th and 15th, less than a month away.
Good lord.
It's Sookas.
All right.
Well, you do realize that the Sephardic in the, what is the other one?
Whatever they are.
What?
That's the, that's the what?
What did you say?
There are two kinds of Jews.
Real ones and Hank Olberg.
Ashkenazi.
Yeah, they live next door to me.
Anyway, Sookas is, but no, see, they're one group pronounces Hebrew letters.
Actually, this is very, this is touchy.
I remember Poulthus would get upset about this.
Yeah.
Letters that end with a, what is, could be an S or like a TH.
So some people would say Sookas.
I'm serious.
I'm serious.
Sookas and others would say Sookas.
I prefer, I like Sookas because I have enough problems already.
Okay.
Sookas, not Sookas.
I've kind of found that Sookas.
Well, no, it's like Shmata or Shmati.
It is.
Or Baba or Bubi.
All right.
Or Festival or Festival.
No.
No.
Russia, Russia Shana is on September 30th, which President Bush, by the way, wants to wish all our Cuban friends a happy Russia Shana.
And you know, I'm Kipper is on October 9th.
Big season.
Now, I wonder what kind of special music you play on Sookas.
When someone will try to put me down instead of watching congregation.
I tell him right away now listen here.
I said, take a picture.
I heard a lot show this summer.
Why did the nation always say it's dimmled?
Sookas, don't be rude.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Look at the guy.
But, Mot's fit.
We can't really start seeing more of this or just like that.
What are you talking about?
About Hank Goldberg.
Oh!
I will be through your shop!
Our fries are be jacked up on the South end service.
I'll be ready to pray.
I'll be steady now.
My girlfriend's at the office.
Her is a choir now.
She'll be singing away.
Be true to your show.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Be true to your show.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Brush my eyes for your own style.
Even if it's a Vatican, they don't have as many claim in one building as they do in here.
It's 1157 at WIOD, a little Suketh music there.
It's the Ashkenazis and the Galicianners.
I don't know what that means.
I'm not in that level of Judaism.
I don't get into that.
That's like some kind of a Brooklyn thing.
I don't know what that means.
Brooklyn.
Now the Sephardi more Sephardic pronunciations than I don't know why you're laughing.
Oh gee, I have no idea.
Then I have to do with this.
I think that the people who speak to Fardic go to the Metropolitan Community Synagogues.
I don't know what that means.
Suketh.
Suketh.
No, I'm serious.
There are words that end in T8, but like like here's a great one.
Shabbos.
Now like one group would say Shabbat.
Okay.
All right.
I've heard about it.
Yeah.
I would say Shabbos.
Mm-hmm.
Because it sounds more Jewish.
Now if you were at Homestead, you would probably say Saturday.
Now that's honorary Jews.
Now, oh, please.
It's too late.
It's too late.
Callers not going to bother that.
By the way, we wanted to say hi to a special honorary Jew at WQA and Bill Chester.
It's got that Jewish hairdo where he combs his hair straight across from one ear right across the top of his head to the other side.
And boy, it looks really macho.
Okay.
See, that's why he does it.
He wants to look as butch as possible because he doesn't want anybody to think he might be a little.
Oh, you know what I'm saying?
Have they fey in Brooklyn?
You know, I'm saying.
Anyway, Reverend Polis and I'll have plenty of chance to talk about that this afternoon as we really get down to the old nitty gritty today on the Steve Cain show.
As we find out what the Reverend Virgin's real problem is.
Okay.
Finally, is it possible that he's not getting on?
Is that possible?
Maybe that's his problem.
Anyway, who's going to do the news now?
Chuck, he's not in there.
Is that what you tried to tell me?
No problem at all.
We can fill as much time as you want.
As a matter of fact, we can put a CD in there.
He's got the latest on Hugo.
So obviously he's got some heavy duty.
He's working there on his way into the newsroom.
He's there.
He's got some very heavy meteorological crap to bring you now.
Yeah.
Farer you, I would just crawl under the table and hide and scream.
The sky is falling.
Now that's a really good way to do it.
When there's like the threat of a storm or a hurricane, a tropical depression, anything like that.
Just crawl under the table and listen to Hank Goldberg.
Okay, we'll come back at 1205 and then of course on the Steve Cain show.
I really, I real treat this afternoon.
Holden here?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I can see my breath.
It's not cool.
Yes, it is.
Pleasantly chilly.
I have to stay awake for eight hours in here today.
Okay.
I'm not complaining.
And it's not going to be easy, especially with Mr.
Boredom coming on Steve's show today.
It's 1208 at WIOD.
Well, I will say this.
It's our third hour.
This part of the show is flying by these first four.
It's kind of the warm up to the Jason Polish show.
The Reverend Virgin.
Isn't that going to be exciting?
Yes.
Maybe.
Now you, it'll be lively.
Yeah, I think it'll be lively.
All right, till he gets up and walks out.
He might.
Anyway, let's take a couple of calls.
We are doing screenless today.
I know it takes a battery of rocket scientists to explain that to this audience.
It just means that Marvin's too busy to answer the phone.
He's busy making his plans to take off on tissue boats,
so to say, and I love these people like a real religious.
Yes.
I'm serious a KAT that is no joke.
Every Jewish holiday, the entire staff, who's like a funeral parlor.
Well, even when there were people there was like a funeral parlor KAT,
but I mean, it was like cleared out.
It could be Symechastora.
And even the goyam didn't come to work on those days.
Everybody cleared out.
Siddlevind just stood in the doorway and the jenny reflecting and tipping his arm.
Look at everybody and everybody ran out.
Don't you remember guns?
Yeah, took every Jewish holiday.
Every holiday, including some that aren't even celebrating.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, 1209 at W.O.D.
What do we where guns are is now?
He's in Boston.
Is he doing at boring two man show?
Remember we read that article about what a monster he was in a business?
Yes, you do.
Or maybe you weren't here.
I don't think I was here.
Oh, I'd miss out.
Yeah, he's doing a two man show with who all by himself.
Anyone we know?
I don't know.
The other guy with some other was what was it in the trades or something?
Is that anything about it?
I had magazine.
Yeah.
Dave County.
Hello.
I'm calling the O'Rodges.
Well, Neil is speaking.
Is this Neil?
Yes.
Oh, well, how come I don't hear you on the radio?
Well, I don't know, but probably because we're on a seven-second delay.
If we start listening to that radio, we're all going to go...
It's a public and that's going to be...
Those are the two different...
Things.
Pronunciation of the words.
One is the public and one is I'm going to...
Right.
Well, I don't like Sukkoth to me.
Sukkoth is a holiday.
What?
Sukkoth is a holiday.
No, I know what it is, but I mean, I just don't like saying it to you.
I don't like the way it's said.
You like it.
Well, one is not canadien, one is suffurring.
So say it anywhere you are.
I say Sukkoth, is that okay?
You could say Sukkoth, that's the old way.
That's the old way.
That's the way my Bubby would say Sukkoth.
I'm sure that's canadien.
Well, she knew what she was talking about.
Now, the new way is the suffurring and they're saying Sukkoth.
Oh, well...
They're changing it because I don't know why.
The original is always the best.
That is the one.
Right.
Okay, now.
Happy Sukkoth.
Okay, you too.
So we have to say Sukkoth?
No.
No.
You don't have to.
You can say whatever the hell you want because this is America unless, of course, Senator Ainten
away doesn't like it.
Oh.
It's 11 past noon at WIOD.
We do have a line not flashing.
There it goes in Dade County.
Thank the Lord for that, boy.
Pass the plate and the ammunition and all of it.
Should we take our break a little bit early here now?
I know we did play...
What do we play the crying?
It's 1214 at WIOD.
If Scott's listening, Lynn...
Laura was just in the controller running her fingers through Marvin's here.
I have no idea what that's all about.
Anyway, we do have a couple of lines not flashing now.
I did remember something else I want to talk about.
I really comment on Steve's shows as you know.
But Friday he had our friend on the show.
He's an Ojoan Provaca tour.
I remember.
Mr. Bombastic.
I wonder if he's related to Dr. Bombastic.
Dr. Bombastic.
And that woman, and you know, I felt like such a schlep when I listened in the middle of the show.
Because when I left here, she was standing out on the hallway.
That's Shelley Benveniste.
Shell.
Shell.
And I said to her, give him hell.
And she looked at me and...
Ah!
Like, fooey.
Like, what...
I didn't realize she was another one of these...
Clones of Rabbi Kahana that Steve always has on.
If he doesn't have myra Kahana on himself, he's got one of his underlings, one of these JDL types,
one of these militant obnoxious...
And if I had to realize that, I would have said a plague on both your houses.
In fact, it was really incredible that anybody could make Dick fatherly come off looking good.
But she managed to do it.
She was so outrageous and so unreasonable.
And I just wanted to mention it because I didn't realize where she was from.
Well, she had...
I wonder, I think, is the word...
She had a look that I knew not to speak to her.
She had this self-important...
Who are you?
I'm here now.
I mean, you're really...
I mean, you're really...
Talk about making a mountain out of a molehiller.
It was really much into about nothing to be honest with you.
And she made such a stimulus over it.
It was just incredible.
Anyway, I thought I would mention that in passing because Dick fatherly, of course, we know
is a real benevolent, wonderful hatchet murderer.
It's 1216 at WIOD.
Broward County.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
How's the bird doing today?
Great.
Okay, I can see that blue bag.
I got an RKO's fireport.
Okay.
From Boston.
A couple weeks ago, do you know Jerry Williams?
Never heard of him.
He was on C-SPAN 1.
I have on television.
I know.
We only did about an hour on it on this show.
We talked about it for a whole hour.
When was that?
The day after I saw it.
It was totally impossible to watch.
It was boring, terrible.
It was a monster in the field.
I know Jerry very well.
He used to work with Jerry at WOLV and underlined the OLV.
Yeah, he is definitely a big man in the field.
Jerry gets any older.
He's going to make Methuselow look like a teenager.
No, Jerry is used to be great until he got boring.
He was on there with a couple other right wing who knows.
And it was very ponderous.
Yeah, when they were talking about what's his name?
Barney Frank.
Yeah, and it was like putting me to sleep.
Terminal.
It was very charming.
I like this call.
Oh, come on.
I was just trying to be nice.
No, I understand.
Don't feel bad just because you're two or three weeks behind.
Don't just feel bad.
Hey, hey, what do you expect from a guy who works in a truck all the time?
Exactly that same.
You don't have to pass in on the highway, do you?
Do you have any time?
You mean Ann Bishop?
Yeah, that's the one.
You're a salt feeder of life.
Yes, I guess so.
Well, you have a big tooth for us next time you pass your own high.
I really will.
Okay.
Bye.
Hi, probably 10 at WIOD.
Can you believe Jerry Williams was on C-SPAN?
Did not.
Did anybody see Graham mother's house?
Come on, I know somebody has seen it.
It's just another one of these.
I don't know where they get all these movies on viewers' choice.
They have all these bizarre, violent, ax murderer type horror movies.
And you just, they're fascinating.
I mean, they're not good.
In fact, the ending on this one just leaves you want to scream.
I mean, it's just crying.
I guess there'll be sequels to all of these, you know.
Like, Graham mother's house, part two.
And Graham daddy's house.
And oh, brother.
Did they really fast?
They fasten it, you do they really fast?
It's about these two kids.
They're father dies and they go off to live in grandpa and grandma's house.
And they think their mother is dead, but it turns out that she was in a mental asylum
and she has escaped and she's crazier than a bed bug.
And she's hacking everybody up with a thing with an axe.
And, well, I like those kind of things.
And the kid is crawling around on the roof trying to escape.
And it turns out Grandpa was really the father.
Oh, I mean, it's just shocking.
And of course, the sheriff goes in and the house and mommy acts as him up
and with a knife and scissors or something.
It's great.
Is it real good and bloody?
Yeah.
Just another one of those great family movies for everybody to watch together after dinner time.
Kind of like Walt Disney.
Or Mike Disney.
1219 and WIOD.
Bokeh, hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
What?
Bokeh, good call.
Palm Beach.
Okay.
This is a clear of those two in a hurry.
Yeah.
Broward.
Flowneel.
Yeah.
I'm Neil and Bird.
I want to see you guys were much hipper than our sinew in this legion of suits.
Yeah.
So is Barbara Bush.
What does that tell you?
That tells you how happy he is.
Got all of them BL and I'll tell you.
By the way, happy stickers to all our Hispanic friends.
I'm not.
Listen Neil, I'm leaving for Rochester tomorrow.
I'm going back home for one week.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Well, when you're getting there just in time before the first snowfall.
Maybe.
Oh, mine.
So what restaurants do you recommend up there?
I've pretty much lost touch.
Now I'm newly...
Only Donum Bob's.
It's all you need to know.
Just go up there and have four or five hundred white hearts and you'll be in good shape.
Oh, that sounds real good.
They have a real...
What, but why?
I finally read it myself and I've got enough sense to get out of here for a while.
Well, that's good.
They always can never hurt to get out of this God-forsaken toilet of a hole for a few days.
Oh, my.
You're right about that.
This is like the end of the world here.
Not very much is.
I can't wait to go back to Rochester.
And I feel like I'm an alien.
But you know, because I haven't been back in 16 years.
But then again, I'll get a sense of belonging.
Just go to the 12 corners right there on Monroe and Dointen Road.
It's all still there.
Oh, great.
All right, Neil, great show, man.
Take care.
Okay, call us from up there now.
All right.
Call us from right next...
In fact, there's a payphone outside of Don and Bob's.
I'm serious during lunch hour.
Call us from Don and Bob's.
I'll send you white hearts, too.
Okay.
All right, take care.
We got a white heart for you.
21 past noon at WIOD and the phone.
What is so funny?
I don't understand.
Anything that's going on around me.
I'm just surrounded by a bunch of bird brains.
Anyway, next time you go to the Beverly Hills Cafe.
All right, God is punishing you for your intempered behavior.
Look at that.
He's choking and getting intempered behavior.
And coughing and put that beak away.
Will you play?
All for that.
Yeah, he's punishing you for that beak.
Yeah.
Wait till we get those pictures, man.
We can retire.
We can sell those.
A dollar or a half.
We have to wait for us to put a package together.
Broward County, welcome to WIOD.
And he said...
Mm-hmm.
Okay, date County.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay.
Want to let you know what the bird is.
The bird is the greatest thing that happened to radios
and Neil Rogers went on the air.
Isn't this something, man?
Hey, Whitty.
He's serious.
How much did you get for this?
No.
And above all, I...
What was that?
He's very talented.
From what?
I don't know.
From what?
From why?
We've been on for two and a half hours.
Oh, it's Nick.
Yeah.
Nick comes in the monitors, don't I?
Benjamin Franklin's wife.
I want to read you a card I got today, okay, sir?
Go ahead.
Benjamin Franklin's wife was very concerned
over his obsession with thunderstorms.
You'll catch your death, she kept telling him.
One night, she decided to put her foot down,
come back into the house, she commanded.
I've got to find a way to prove that lightning
is not a bolt from heaven, but a scientific phenomenon,
he replied.
Her patient's exhausted, she answered,
go fly a kite, direct his history.
This isn't even for me.
This is for Roger.
I love the way that Nick keeps giving me Roger's mail.
He does.
For Roger.
He does?
Not Neil Roger, but just plain old Roger.
Okay, sir, thanks for...
Oh, no wait, I won't answer.
Well, that's okay, don't panic now.
My fingers not near the button.
Everything is calm, relaxed.
Okay, it looked like it was close.
Yes.
The face...
Where's that phone line again?
Listen to that.
Must be Hurricane Hugo.
I want to collect you know,
that the baseball card show promo on television
with UNC's cane,
somebody is spelling your name wrong.
Really?
They're spelling it with a D.
Right up there, big bowl letters on the big 50-inch screen, doesn't it?
Well, I won't show up then.
Well, I would let them know.
Here's another letter for Roger.
I already opened it.
Attention, Roger, birthday person.
This Nick, sir, I'm going to tell you,
brains were dangerous, he needed the safest man on the face of the year.
Okay, have a great life.
Get a new phone.
I just shouldn't even open that.
I'm just opening it, assuming it's mine,
and I only come here with a big smile on his face,
sanding the all-erogers mail.
He did it Friday.
You do me a big favor and put these back in Roger's box,
please, sir, till a food comes...
And put this someplace safe.
I don't know where.
Ah, yeah.
All right, that's for Roger, okay.
27th of the past noon at WIOD.
And the afternoon from 2 to 6, for some reason,
I'm going to be here debating the Reverend Pull.
I don't know what kind of a debate it's going to be,
because he's undebatable.
He is a shameless and outrageous and just a piece of walking mong.
I think is the best way to describe anybody.
And Steve is even a bigger piece of mong to keep bringing him on the air,
and then to say, oh, he's just a sweet guy.
He's just a nice, sweet guy.
He's a little bit misguided.
Yeah.
Like Hermann Gehring.
I had a great sense of humor at a party, but...
28 minutes after noon,
and let's take a call from Boca.
Hello.
Yeah.
We have seen some of us out here have heard of the crying chains.
Well, that's great.
They were both of their hits were hits down here.
Up on the roof.
Mr. Diling, dyingly sad.
They were big hits.
There were three hits.
Up on the roof.
Up on the roof.
Oh, great record.
They did it so much better than the drifters.
Oh, you never...
That wasn't a hit down here.
Well, it may not have been a hit anywhere, but it was a great record.
It was even better than it could be where I love, which was tremendous.
Yeah, that was...
So, you know, in South Florida, people who grew up down here know the crying chains.
So, magic should get on...
Exactly.
What the hell is wrong with that stupid bean brain over there?
What's his name at magic?
I don't know.
What's his name?
That pea brain, that friend of yours.
Well, there's several.
Yeah, that one that used to be 1194.
That's great.
That's great.
Oh, yeah, not so cool.
Yeah, but it's not great, but it's a, you know, on Saturday and they...
They had some good...
Thanks to the hell out of the music here, doesn't it?
Oh, yeah.
And then that AOR stage, you know, was a great record.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
They even play records you've heard before.
Oh.
Yeah.
So, you can play the crying chains here.
Well, thank you.
And if anybody out there has got up on the roof by the crying chains, I'll just go nuts if I can get a hold of that.
You'll just freak out when you hear that.
Yeah, definitely.
Okay.
All right.
Adios.
Claudius 29 at WIOD.
Maybe our good friend Rich Pacter, who's a chronic pain in the neck, who sent us something here today that I wasn't even worth talking about.
Maybe...
Oh, no, he sent me this cassette with all the Yeranets music.
Oh, man.
I'm so sorry that I said that, Rich Pacter.
That's right.
That's right.
I'm so sorry I said that.
Produced by Phil Specter.
Yeah.
And it's also got some Dion cuts and an icon Tina Turner thing on it.
And Bonnie and the Treasures, and he says, Bonnie and the Treasures was the name that he thinks the Ronets use later on.
Hmm.
I never heard that.
Well, hey, listen, when you're dealing with Phil Pacter, look at what's on here.
Bill, I like that.
I like that.
That's Bill Pacter.
Baby, I love you.
What did I say?
Bill Pacter.
That's a problem.
I like that.
I like Bill Pacter.
You can't get much more chronic than that.
You don't come any more chronic than Bill Pacter Jr.
A chapel of love.
I thought that was the Dixie Cups, wasn't it?
What?
What's that?
What's in it?
Well, I must be on there to Ronets.
Maybe.
I never heard about him.
Walking in the rain.
Do I love you?
The best part of breaking up?
Oh, God.
Is there some good stuff on here?
What I think.
Hmm.
Ray Charles is spinning.
And he's not even as grave yet.
He's still spinning.
Hmm.
I can hear music.
Now, don't we have that, uh, here music?
The Beach Boys?
Is that one of these here?
Is that just my, no, you've played it.
I've heard you play it.
I have.
Where I've died.
I've heard you play it.
You have like you have.
One moment, please.
Let's say, uh-huh.
Come go with me.
Hmm.
Fun, fun, fun.
I get around.
God.
This isn't the one.
I see other Beach Boys one that's in here.
Oh.
Uh, we do have two in here.
Don't we?
I think so.
Here's, um, sound effects.
Oh, good.
I like those.
Here's the charelles.
Hmm.
Well, where the hell is that other Beach Boys thing?
Is this it?
Uh, no, that's the Rascals.
There's Jan and Dean.
Maybe whoever stole it and took it home will bring it back in time for us to play it today.
Look under some of those IOU notes from Steve.
And see if there's no there.
Oh, yeah.
And there's another uh, kissy kissy note that Hank Goldberg left for me.
Hank, forget about that show.
I'm not going to be on it.
Okay.
You can have whoever you want of your choice.
But forget about me.
I'm not.
I'm not going to six day route.
You know, I'm getting a sick and tired of this crap.
They find every excuse for you to work a six day here.
That's not going to fly.
Well, maybe it's in here.
Do you think?
It could be.
What time is it?
Oh, we got a lot of time.
12 32.
12 32 in the big shitty.
That would you I O D.
Oh, look at that.
There's a whole bunch of stuff in here.
Uh huh.
I wouldn't even be surprised if C of love by Phil Phillips is on the list.
You know, it could be.
Oh, I wouldn't have to.
Great.
That would give us excuse to play two things.
I would feel so good.
Well, I have to pace myself today.
Exactly.
You do.
Here's the in crowd by Dolby Gray.
I like that.
And of course, it's all about our Cineo Hall's viewers.
Um.
C of love by Phil Phillips.
I don't think it's on here while wait a minute.
It could be the gentries and keep on dancing.
We could play that.
That's not the way he was starting it again.
I like that.
Bust up by the Hollies.
Mm hmm.
And then they have the uh,
Separnich version.
Bust up by the Hollies.
For those who want to break bread during the show.
Well, I know what you're laughing about.
You don't even know what that means.
Yes, I do.
Hollie, you know, no holly from Halivov.
I can't say it, but I know what it means.
What do you mean?
You can't say it.
Well, I'm Gentile from Lakeland.
How can I possibly call her so?
Um, how could I say that?
Where's that other beach boys?
I know it's in here.
Okay, trust me.
Could it be in here?
Oh, look at what's in there.
Woo.
Some of it's crawling around.
Be careful in there.
Some of it's moving.
Watch yourself in there.
No.
12.33 now.
Wait a minute.
C of love might be on here.
1961.
Will you hide now?
Well, you just shot up.
She's in here knowing itself, folks.
Crystal blue persuasion.
Oh, there's locomotion.
Remember I played that the other day?
And cousin Brucey stepped on it?
Mm, kind of.
By the way, I heard some of that on.
He wasn't as bad as I thought he was.
Oh, good.
No, he wasn't.
Oh, good.
Not exciting, but it wasn't that bad.
Mm-hmm.
I don't find it.
And that really frosted my butt.
I guess during the break, I'll have to dig around in there.
Because I know it's in here.
I know it didn't take it home.
And it's on that other beach boys.
One of one's got Hawaii on it.
Oh, yeah.
And some of those non-hits, but they were,
I can hear music.
Boy, that is so great.
It's disgusting.
It's so good.
And I don't know what I'm wasting my time.
Because there isn't one person in this audience who gives a flying leap about hearing it.
They don't.
They don't want to hear it.
We don't want to hear music.
We could turn on magic if we want to hear music.
We'll go right ahead.
OK.
Be my guest.
12.34.
I'm WIOD.
Citywide insurance agent.
Yeah.
You better open my mic.
If you want to take off the air because Neil is over in the cabinet.
Deeply immersed in CDs.
And no one plays the Justice Scusly.
The most disgusting, vulgar place.
No, it is.
They swipe everything in here.
Roger was telling you this morning.
He was going nuts.
He said.
He said.
He said.
Everything on the weekend comes out of here in a given year.
Why can't we have a key on this door?
Well, if they pay, if they would pay any attention to what goes on here day in and day out
and still these stupid meetings they have trying to sit around acting important.
This could be a real radio station someday.
Oh, it's just frustrating as hell.
You know what?
Yeah, you're right.
There is a key on there.
But you're never going to guess.
And I never would have found this if I wouldn't have gone back inside of here.
Huh, you're going to just fall on the floor.
You're going to just flip your wings.
If I can find what cut it is.
Let's say, oh, look at that.
You're going to go nuts when you hear.
Incredible.
Shocky.
A week we've been searching.
Oh, boy, you're going to shock.
You dig around enough.
You'll find something.
That's what they say at Lidko.
Not bad.
Of course, the question is, do we cut it off or do we let it go?
Do you refill for beer, me, beer?
Like a deal.
Well, I guess we cut it off.
Well, no, but I mean, he played half of it and then he stopped it, which was so tacky.
He has no clue.
You know, nothing about playing music or using cards or stuff.
No, he's strictly screaming and yelling and getting everybody excited.
Another thing Steve does lately that I've noticed, if you notice, he'll start the show and say, well, I'm really in a very bad mood today.
I'm really a psychotic today.
Audience doesn't care about that.
In fact, on his show they expect that.
Oh, isn't that true?
Yes.
Can't come on and start the show everyday with some excuse about how you're in a bad mood because the dog just did a number on the carpet or something.
Although speaking of that, it's 1239 at WIOD.
Today speaking of hopeless, there he is ladies and gentlemen, just from Louisville, or wherever the hell he was again, another busman's holiday.
He's keeping on those buses in one day and one of them is not going to come back.
Anyway, here's a call from the Broward. Hello.
Oh, I want.
Yes, sir.
You were having a contest before about the bird.
Yeah, but now the line is the question is the bird.
What was it again?
The bird is what?
The bird is a little stiff.
Really?
Well, he just got a big smile on his face and he said that's right. I think that's wishful thinking.
No, you're talking about my bird at the home.
He's very stiff now and at Brown in that blue bag somewhere.
Yeah, you having the sport for me?
Yeah, no, he's long gone.
His history.
I'm looking forward to the Steve Kane show like I haven't in a couple years.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I'm trying to give him all the help I can.
I think if you did a show every every other week or so with him, his ratings would,
well, I got news where that ball, but they would drop better.
That isn't going to happen, sir. Trust me.
Why not?
Because four hours is plenty.
Too much.
I think about a two and a half hours.
Why not?
What a question.
What if I gave you 50,000 week kicks?
No, about the 10 mark race rookie caught.
No, that won't do it.
I can see him for free.
I'll end like tonight.
Okay, sir.
Well, I was hoping I could eventually do it once in a while.
Don't forget Paul Kielgas is pitching tonight.
I was a met fan.
Why not really about a Miyake fan, but I used to watch the met on Tell-Mine every once
long now.
Since the beginning of the year, I've been rooting for the Cubs since May.
Have you really?
Really?
Well, it's never too late to become a Cubs fan.
Well, I'm looking forward to the series against San Francisco, but I think I'll get to see them.
Well, look, before we worry about San Francisco, let's really have the met and the fillies and the pirates and Montréal and St. Louis in that order.
Let's hope we don't see too many starts for Paul Kielgas in the next two weeks.
He was going to start every four days and I'd say the met have a chance.
Yeah.
Well, let's be glad there's only two weeks left.
Okay, who do you think they should pitch, Bird?
Hang up on the guy.
He just pushed the off.
He recommended Mark the Bird Fidrich.
Push off.
Have a great day, Hitu.
One, two, three.
Johnny Died.
Okay, 1242 at WIOD and let's go to Date County.
Hello.
Okay.
Well, I'm not going to wait.
I know there are people on those lines, but I'm not going to wait around.
In other words, we don't have time.
We've been doing this for almost three years now and I'm not going to retrain the audience in screenless.
I mean, if you don't know what it is and how to do it, then Reverend Polis will draw you a diagram at two o'clock.
And if anybody doesn't know what it is and how to do it, that's it.
Date County, hello.
Neil.
Yes.
How are you doing?
Okay.
How about them dolphins?
Hey, wasn't that great?
That was great.
They really kicked their butts into a oblivion.
Even the snowplough wouldn't have helped yesterday.
Listen, why do we play Kansas City twice this year?
Hey, don't knock it.
I don't know, but don't knock it.
It might be helpful.
It couldn't hurt.
And listen, can I call someone to do spades?
Sure, go ahead.
You can.
Burn your dish bag.
Okay, good call.
1243 at WIOD, that's the kind of call that we spend thousands of dollars trying to make
camping on this show.
And that's what they talk about at the water cooler.
What do you think they do talk about at the water cooler here?
Have you ever wondered about that?
Here?
Yeah.
Like when they're downstairs.
I came in this morning and I went into the cafeteria to get my little cup of water or whatever.
And Skip Harmon was standing out there looking out the window.
No, seriously, aimlessly like he's on the air.
Well, they must have been playing a long record, like hush by D-purple.
Let me think about what they talk about here.
Or Derek and the Domino's in Laila.
Do they play Laila?
Sure.
Well, thank God for that.
Yeah, in fact, I think Laila's on that first CD that Spikewise gave it.
Yeah.
The one that we burned over the weekend.
I think it was.
Okay, 1244 at WIOD and let's do a little call here from Bokeh.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Great.
That's good.
Storm and Norman Spireport.
He called you Friday night a mental midget.
Norm Cash?
Norm Kent.
Norman Kent.
Yeah.
Called me a mental midget?
Yeah, on his show.
That's great.
That's cute.
A lot of stuff, like you know.
Okay.
Should you expect me to believe that with all the money that Norm Kent is making off all of this,
you think he would call me a mental midget?
No, I'm not.
Off the air he would do that.
No, he said it.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, anybody that's in rotisserie baseball can't be all bad.
That's right.
Okay.
Boy, if you could see what your hair looks like, look at him.
Look at the bear.
Oh, he just ruined it.
What?
Your hair was flipped out like the mad professor.
Like Bill Chester?
I think, like Bill Chester.
In fact, if you'd start combing, it's great across.
That's what I'm working on.
You'd have the appearance of having a full head of hair.
Like that, the redneck Bill Chester over at WQIM.
Full everybody.
Yeah.
That great sidekick that stiff sidekick that Bill's had in the morning temporarily.
Dave County, hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Well, after I'd never get on this phone.
No, if you just keep plugging away.
Yeah, if it wasn't busy.
Yeah.
I wanted to talk to him about that guy that's going to Rochester.
Want to talk to who?
The guy's on the radio.
No, that's me.
That's us.
That's you guys.
If I like it, I got on you so fast.
Because we're doing scrimas.
Did you just call?
Yeah, I'm listening to the show now.
You're on.
I'm on the air.
Just keep listening.
And you'll hear it on side, second delay.
What?
I said, be still in my heart.
Well, you got that one guy that was on the radio just a few minutes ago.
He's going up to Rochester.
Yes, ma'am.
You tell him to button up warm because I just talked to my family and it's colder than Hades up there.
What did you say, the can of worms?
No, the guy can't.
It can't.
The guy that's going up to...
Don't you know the can of worms is what they call the intersection of all the expressways downtown.
The can of worms?
Yeah, I believe it.
And they just...
I believe it.
They're just about got lost on that thing.
I was there just a few weeks ago.
Up north?
Yeah, up north.
What about?
What I just said in Rochester.
In Rochester?
Well, I'm from Syracuse.
Well, that's not a big deal.
No, but it's cold up there.
It's very cold there and also in Onianta and Oswigo and all those...
Yeah, I got family and Oswigo too.
And Albany and Troy and St. Anthony.
That's the Troy.
That's the city, not the person, Jack.
I don't want to get Jack confused.
You know my name?
No.
No.
Incredible.
I know that's terrible.
Well, how often do you listen to this show?
Whenever I can remember to turn the radio on, it works.
Oh, okay.
Well, if you're at work, that explains it.
Now, you didn't see the movie Grandmother's House, did you?
No.
I didn't.
Well, okay.
If you get a chance, be sure to miss it.
Okay.
Well, just tell me what channel it's on.
I don't know whatever if it's in the show.
Okay.
So you put two people later, I guess.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you in Auburn.
No, I'll just take the Syracuse.
It's a little bit safer there.
Yeah, I believe that.
Okay.
See you at the GE plant.
Yeah.
Okay.
Definitely.
Say goodbye.
Bye.
See you at the 47.
Yeah, that's the cool.
You want to talk to the people who are on the air.
That's a great call.
You want to talk to the people who are on the air?
Maybe we can get a hold of them.
Okay.
We're doing screenless.
We're finally building a little bit of momentum, unfortunately.
And I think we got one more break to do here.
1247 at WIOD.
Here's 60.
From the Roger Herbert School.
Herbert School.
Can you believe he brought in a record?
They put it on the heart.
And they've balked him.
And they thought they could play it once on this station.
Never to be heard again.
Oh, with me.
Wow.
I know.
Oh, my God.
Phil Costan, isn't it?
Doing this?
Phil Costan.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
I want to tell you.
And then, they played half of it.
Or like two thirds of it, Steve had him fade it down and they balked the cart.
And it disappeared forever.
Do you read the book?
This is like R&M.
Yeah.
You just keep talking.
Talking right through the whole record, baby.
Talk through.
Anyway, it's 1251 at WIOD.
That's a great record.
And I will credit whoever made the movie.
I haven't seen the movie, obviously, because it's just out, right?
Is it out?
Yeah, it opened, tried.
Oh, it did or it is.
It is.
It opened, tried.
This passed from.
It.
Yes.
Yeah.
Let me be for asking such tough questions.
But, given credit for not using the honey drippers,
or the rip off.
I would have been great to do that.
Because it would have been more contemporary and all these punk monghids out there would have...
Oh, yeah, I know that record.
But they didn't do that.
They did more like a Benny King.
Mm-hmm.
What was the year on this?
Does this have the early 60s?
I'd say the summer of...
It says 1959.
Really?
Yeah.
That doesn't sound right.
I would say the summer of 61.
Mm-hmm.
Wouldn't you?
Yeah.
Something like that.
6061.
Johnny Darkle.
Yeah, Johnny Darkle called in on the Dark Line.
That's the lowdown on that.
Rowered County, hello.
Hey, now?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Great.
Oh, you know who we are, right?
Hi, I think so.
Well, that's good.
At last, ladies, she didn't know if she thought she was calling her man in McQueen.
Yeah?
Yeah, I get on pretty quick there.
Well, that's because I'm just punching around here.
You were lucky.
Yeah?
So if I were you, I'd go out and buy 100 lottery tickets right now.
Okay.
Okay.
Hello?
Yeah, we're here.
Yeah, I'm on the phone.
Yeah, you leave him alone.
He's on the phone, will you?
Yeah.
Who is that?
Jack.
Well, tell Jack, uh, go meet Jack through.
Okay, so how's it going?
Great.
You're having a wonderful, can't you tell?
Aren't you listening?
Yeah.
Well, listen, go see Jack and do you obviously have nothing to say?
I'm not going to keep playing that game.
12.
It was going great till that call.
12, 53, 7 to 1 at W I O D.
The Steve Kane show today.
It says today, we analyze.
Mm-hmm.
If I could read you what Nick has written here, it says today we analysis the deep dark inner working of the mind of blank.
Why?
Blank.
It's got a blank.
Yes.
Near Rogers and Jason Polis and Reverend Inferentices.
Uh huh.
reverend
and on sports talk we have the dolphin edition and to celebrate yesterday's
traumatic
gouging of the patriots that smashing
thrashing victory 24 to 10 up in wangland with rick and joe no hang tonight so you can kiss the ground for that
No, you know the more I think about that comment if he really said that of course you never know with these trouble making callers
But knowing Hank and what a monghen he is he probably did
Like like he's doing me a favor. He's letting me in you know what that reminds me of it's like the hurricane baseball
I don't want to start a big thing here because I don't really care one way or the other and
Sonny's a great guy sonny and I would never have a misunderstanding because we've known each other too long and sonny knows that I'm the best but
Are you paying any attention? I'm hearing every word about them line is it's like all these little
Us and Steve is right about the sports department. They are so paranoid and insecure
Oh, well, it's our department so you know
We were gonna let you in on that show, but since you're bad mouthing me you can forget about the breeder's couple
You can forget about it to Hank you can stick it okay?
I hope you're about 50,000 on a horse to show that finishes eighth in a seven horse race
What I mean like like they're doing me a favor to let me come in on Saturday
Like I need that like hemorrhoids right to come in and go over there when I go to the track
I don't like to be working. I like to be plunging. I like to have a good time and plunge
I don't like to be working over there. I hope Bob Savage is listening to that too. No, I don't I don't enjoy going over there
And have to go on some stupid show. I just like going over there and relaxing and reading my racing form and having a good time and
Listening to call her rip you a new ass and just having a good time
Okay, I

No, no, no, but I'm talking to early in the game was like 10 to seven or something like that
Yeah, we was really and then the bears got a touchdown
It was 17 to seven and I was flipping around watching other stuff
And I kept coming back and all of a sudden it was like 150 to nothing or something. What the hell went on there? You bad the bears
Take that they went crazy there in the end. Yeah
What are you gonna make another
Never again, why not how about date? How about in date? What yeah?
Like closer like to candle no, no, not date County. I don't have my passport. Why not? No speak at a esponial sir

Oh, we'll go anywhere last week. We were in date County. I recall sir
Back was in date County. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, but up in this game over I live in Kendall
Well, excuse me. Oh, why didn't you talk to the sales department if we just moved the whole station down to Kendall just to make you happy and come by and have lunch with us every day?
Yeah, why not?
When I get out or I'll tell you what you hang on Marvin. I'll give you a glens address. I have no
Living stuff by his house. He lives in Kendall. I don't think so. I can stuff by his house. No, I live in Kendall
And look at pictures of Phoebe and George Cates and I made the remote
Yeah, no attention to I do what do you mean? Yeah, right? Didn't you? Oh
Listen when to come to Miami-Dade? Oh

Nobody speaks English at Miami-Dade or FIU
We're gonna be doing a show on woofie radio. They just signed it was to a long-term contract
That's right. That was so real dumb. You remember when you played that thing? No that girl. No, I sure don't a couple months ago
Well, she said something about that some homosexual that homosexuals you their homosexual part didn't bother me
That was real
But that's a fan like Hank Goldberg. You can't they don't come any fatter than Hank Goldberg
Yeah, that's true. Okay, and I'm really upset that I'm gonna miss out on that readers cup broadcast because Hank is licking his wounds again
Because I've been picking on him. Steve was absolutely right about Hank
Hank is a vicious
Backstabbing douchebag who shills for the dolphins and who never is never seriously never said a correct thing on ear in his life
Well, but I do appreciate the horse he gave me a few months ago
Good luck with the wicked price good was the horse that got injured. What was that horse?
It was good Dixieland brass. Thank you Hank, but you're still among head
Go ahead sir good luck with the Reverend the Reverend when he leaves here
Sir he won't know whether to scream or each a key to banana. Okay believe me
All right, see you at Reverend
I'm not gonna treat him with kid gloves like Steve does because Steve likes to be close personal buddies with all of his guests
I'm gonna let him have it like he's never had it before if you pardon that expression
What is that?
urine therapy a urine therapy
For aids and cancer. Oh, yeah, I think nails also
If you have like hardening of the arteries is this the urine lake or if you have softening of the arteries margarine
That's a urine lady. Yeah, she's coming by for a little a cocktail later on after the show
Anyway, that's to pay money to do this you have to pay three dollars. That's her. That's the urine. Yes
Boy, I'll tell you that show is a real pisser woman
Anyway, we're gonna get out of here and make way for the news Chuck Myers racing around frantically looking for more hurricane warnings
These these news people are they smiling from here all in any kind of disaster plane crashes hurricanes
earthquake
Estilance
They put big memos on it. Well, say well, we need a lot more events like this
The really goose those ratings up so Chuck's gonna give you a real a bubble my sees here on that hurricane
And then we'll come back I think what it's all right and then of course we'll be debating the Reverend Jason Virgin Apolthus

Hear about the birds and the bees for the first time ever today
Oh
106 at W I O D and Wayne Arnold was just here with a little a lunch
And that's good that we had lunch a little late today because I got to stick around right this debacle
That's coming up. It's out what it is. It's what I won't be a debacle for me. I think so
It's gonna be explosive
Yeah, I
Think it might
It's gonna be what else is it gonna be well
Signing could be exciting what Steve Stone always says on it before the cup game. It's gonna be exciting and
I watched yesterday and it was not exciting
It was terminal hmm
Well, I hope the same thing doesn't happen today tonight. I hope the same I don't care about it here
I hope the same thing doesn't happen
tonight
Silly me. I was thinking about this show
The man found a way to lose six out of seven to wrickly field this year. I just mentioned that in passing so they haven't exactly
Set the world on fire and then of course yesterday it looked like they were just kind of going through the motions
Although Gary Carter was outstanding. We know he's gonna be around for a long time
We got to get Gary Carter around with Reverend Polis. He's another born again Christian who rips his fellow neighbors and teammates
If the bad they can't all hit 140 like Gary's sitting and
Throughout one runner in the season. I tell you one thing about Gary's consistency as one home run this year
And he's throwing out one runner right thanks. So he's consistent
Anyways, the big one to two hour and the phones are a mediocre
We have three lines not flashing on a screenless day which shows you how much these people care about us. They just don't care
at all
true
Now there's two you don't think the right rep or to get upset because I'm eating on the year now

Photography a lot of gag. No seriously
Like a video. Yeah for the time it was for the time it was very revolutionary that kind of a photography
Gimaxon, you know, I know I'm supposed to last every time Tracy element come on television

Well Francis the Mule you're right
Um or Francis. Oh, here you like the Ron. That's right. Mm hmm. Well, I was a runner. Do you know that they never had a number one song?
I'll be damned you know that the crystals only had one number one song is this Mr. trivia? Yes, it is
You know what the number one crystals. Yeah, it wasn't to do Ron Ron. No, it wasn't it was um
um
Oh is that other one give me a hint
Oh
How can I give you a hint I give the whole thing away. It was 1961
There was well here's the hint
No specter did not use the crystals
He used the group called the blossoms because he had contract problems and one of the girls was darling love
But it was not the crystal. Well, we're not going to start with darling love again. Are we?
You know, nobody cares about darling love
You ought to hang your head and shame a guy with as much knowledge as you to be hot gonna try to talk about darling love
No, seriously that was come on you can do better than darling love even Paul and Paula would be better than darling to love
I'll give you a great group that nobody talks about anymore
Ever and you'll never hear it on any station. I don't know. I'll be this baby. I love you by the Ronettes
I think it was okay
How about the mom of the wets nobody talks about please mr. Postman. Yeah, one of my all-time favorite records beachwood 45789
Which is our new calling number by
Well the wmc song is a good guy. Yes, he is mm-hmm. My baby must be a magician. No, I don't know that yeah
Yeah, remember that well, they I mean I know it, but not obscure. Yeah, very very okay. Can I give you a one more trivia?
Please they're not darling love
Okay, there were two songs that had this nutty phrase and it do a bang now
I bet you can get one so fine by the chiffons and what's the other?
The other one was called the do-lang-lang by I don't know how to how to wino do-lang
Do you have a group called a bell for that? Oh no, okay. Thank you. Do you miss the keeper the key? Yes, I do
You're the one and me one less well. He's in the same plantation bag with my bird so we ever get him out
One last thing because over there combing his hair with Bill Chester at QAM
John Madden says the Cubs are America's team you want me to tell you John Madden and I don't want you to take this
The wrong way because I like summer all in Madden, but yesterday Madden was maddening
He never shut up for a second he was it was like he was on a too many fruit loops or something for breakfast
He was a bad I thought he had dennenberg disease. He just never shut up for a minute
Even in fact they showed a picture did you see they showed
Some picture from some old team and the guys didn't have the helmets
Did you see that? No, they showed a photograph and he was circling and drawing excess on it in the stance that they were in and look at this and they're always
Here and the guys got three points. Oh, man. He's just carried away with himself, you know
Well
For the speech is a real nice guy
But I when I look at him and I look at some of the guys at the ABC Monday night's had I think the guy that's got the biggest shaft of
Love and there's been Keith Jackson because he's got to hear Keith Jackson is the most disgusting cornpone
That accent that comes and goes and the oh you got it sir
You've been listening to too many darling love records
Jackson is nauseating know you're wrong compared to anybody with that cornpone heavy and the accent just kind of comes and goes
Depending on how thick he wants to lay it on he's the biggest piece of a lot his face looks like porcupig if you stuck an apple
In Keith Jackson's face somebody would eat him, okay?
I'm telling you okay. I'm gonna sleep my wrist now. Okay
Keith Jackson
Why I wish we had that tape you remember at INZ we had that tape company doing that keep Jackson. Oh, right
Oh, that was that was so classic. I wish we had a cog give anything for a copy of that
I enjoy Keith Jackson imitators like boy fire god does yeah, oh I think it's really stuck job
Oh that heavy duty accent that just doesn't stop for one minute
And he just keeps getting worse and worse as the game goes on and all these cliches he's disgusting
He's another one of these like al michael's and the Keith Jackson and they used to have
Jim Kelly was on CBS now he's been demoted ESPN or something and Jim Simpson
I think on NBC was the first of this core of people that knew like a little bit about a whole bunch of sports
But didn't really know much of anything about any of you know what I mean?
Just a little bit they proving that a little bit of knowledge can be dangerous
And that's what he is he is sickening. It's like Brent Mausberger gonna
They're gonna put him on CBS on a game of the week on baseball
He doesn't even understand that would be like putting you on to do the baseball games. Oh, that would be fun exactly
Only Brent Mausberger isn't fun. He's painful. Oh, geez
They had him doing a college world series this past year and he called the last out. He was voiced never changed in flexion
It's not like it was on wold
Oh, wouldn't the world sure oh
Oh Brent go get a breathalyzer test or something will you?
131 at w-i-o-d and the time to tell you one last time about Toyota of Hollywood if you missed out this weekend
If you were just up to your elbows with the hurricanes and the dolphins
And the cubs and the mets and whatever else and you just didn't get a chance to get in there
You get your body in there now because they still do have a few 89's left at
And ridiculous prices. I keep looking at that 89 to sell and I have to think that they're on
medication over there
8,996 for the sticker price
With discount factory incentive and trade equity the price is a thousand
996 dollars. They're almost gonna give it to you. Okay. That's how desperate they are to clear out the remaining
Because they want every stinkin one of them off the lot not that there's anything bad about them
But they've got just hundreds and hundreds probably about 1500 to 2000 brand new 90s coming in
Virtually any day. So you get over there browse around. There'll never be any high pressure
But they certainly will be a brand new cars. It used car prices plenty of them for you to choose from if you get in during the next few days at
Toyota of Hollywood the southeast's number one
Toyota dealer you tell a neo-roger sent you by for the deal of a lifetime
You'll find them at 1841 North state road seven that's 441 just south of Sharon Street in Hollywood
Yeah, last week I bet 10 bucks on the lottery could win millions you know
Yeah, you and took 20 seconds to pick numbers wait until Saturday didn't win too bad read the card odds were 14 million to one against me
Not good odds. So this week I took my 10 bucks to highlight paid for the whole night made some bets walked out with 50 bucks more than when I walked in 50 bucks more
Yeah, use my head went for better odds had a good night out. I was a winner
Back many fans win every week at Miami Highlight go where the odds is good Miami Highlight
Or are we back
Well, we were just talking about I have a little dilemma and that is about the washing that new vet which desperately is needed by the way right as I speak here
And I am I hate to say this because Spencer's a great guy
But everybody has said to me don't do it don't do it
Don't let him remember that time I had those as a matter of fact
It's a funny coincidence because we don't get too many of them down here, but it's almost October
May and October are well when the love bugs are in Florida and we out west where I am there are a few
A few already so I've got a few like on the front
Okay
Oh boy
I
Isn't that great look at the facts we got it says I hate to think it but you should keep your distance from
VJ Polis. Oh, he believes you are a horny old goat. Oh, he's been talking to jack fruit
I think he's really just afraid to realize his true feelings after all what goeth around come at
Isn't that what it says in the scriptures
It says whatever you do don't tip off jathan
That the goat is a known satanic symbol. That's another stirrer for another day good lord
This is gonna be better than I thought yeah, it's afternoon. Mm-hmm a horny old goat. Well, he got part of that right
Anyway, it's 134 w.io.d. Broward County. Hello. Oh, yeah. Oh wait a minute. I never finished my story about who I'm gonna let wash the vet
But that's okay. Go ahead. It's a hopeless story anyway
Can I hold on for a lightening round?
At the Lima
Come on. I'm in the mind whoop. Yeah, that's obvious kind of like all of our employers here at w.io.d
What are you ever gonna do that again? Or is that definitely show forever? No, nothing is forever, but when I feel like it, okay
When I feel that the enough time has passed that all of the birds chronics that he invented
Have disappeared then we might bring it back again
You got to admit you got to admit it was getting ridiculous
You get the bread of occasion for a week and you can bring it back for for a couple times. Okay next week. Okay
Okay, see you
135 at w.io.d
And we haven't had the Johnny Dark call on the bat line today. Mm-hmm
Feel very bad about that. I feel like we're being shined after always play as jingle all the time
I did find the Phil Phillips though and see a love boy that was great didn't find the beach boys
Yeah, but which causes me a certain amount of const consternation, but this is great
What I can't believe how fast thank goodness for those these four hours went by today like lightning. Yes
True, we might play luke-cristy and lightning strikes or we might play
I
But I don't
That's what harrier ways little subdued after the last couple of games, but tonight it's a whole new ball game
As Paul Kildges goes to the mound
How can that be for real are we are we really just having little fun with the fans? We want to make it a little closer and then
Gooden's pitching tomorrow against Steve Wilson. Is that true or is that just a rumor?
Well, Viola's capable of losing the night. He's certainly very capable
And of course once you get into that great met's bullpen. That's what I like
I think we're gonna bring in Don Aussie in about the fifth inning
David County. Hello. Well hello there. Yes, sir. What's going on? Hey, it's the same old stuff. Yeah, same old place
But it sounds just as bad as ever same old belching and the same old talking
Well, we're looking forward to this afternoon. Neil. Are you yeah, you take care of him. Okay?
What do you mean by that? Well, you put him in his place. Oh
If you take care of him, I bet you he just got petrified when he heard that
You know for this this guy, you know, is giving everybody lectures about what they should do
He doesn't know how to get to first base much less to home plate. Okay, and this guy's giving everybody advice
Neil, have you heard the new Beach Boy album? No, see that Neil. I can't even find the old one
Neil do they have a new album now called still cruising really it sounds excellent
Four or five songs. They are just excellent one is Brian Wilson himself
Oh god, you'll be able to recognize it. It sounds similar to
The type of music he just released on his most recent album. What you probably thought was okay

There's going to be screenless. No, I've only said it about 700 times, but your hearing aid is going out at 10 30
You didn't say that in the morning. Okay, whatever you say. I'm asking you
Where do you mind listening something over here? What is that?
Where do you think?
We don't care about all those hot shots with their advertising agencies. Everybody in this town's got an advertising agency

Before two weeks from today and the debut of the dick blame cane for this feral show
On WIOD. Hey, don't I have nothing to do with it. Okay, I'm sure he's going to be really something else
I can't say what
He'll be something else all right, but federal law and the senator ain't no way wouldn't like us to say it on the air
but
Hey, they asked me. I said look please and they said okay. That's inches. No, they don't pay any attention no matter what I say
They do the opposite. They're kind of like you
They didn't they don't ask but I just said to them that conservatives in this town don't make it
You know that conservative talk hosts have never made it never have made it okay
Anytime the only one who made it was Alan Courtney and that's because his audience was too old and know what his philosophy was
Responsible conservative. Yeah, you want to hear responsible conservative folks
I'll even find the card to show you how responsible is guy do you remember he called us the other day
And I thought he would be at least a little bit civilized
And have some kind of common sense. No now this this guy at the JNO he had a point five in the line
There was his only book he had a point five so it has to get better can't get any worse the man has no talent no audience
Makes no sense and that's why we want him here at WIOD
Listen, you're not
But I'm gonna be very supportive okay because you know my audience no matter what I say they listen to me
Okay, you have a lot of influence with me. I have no I can't even get him to call you could break this man's career before he even started
Please it is that true. Let's give it a shot tomorrow
Made me well. I want to get a chance and I thought that that were true. I do four hours tomorrow on the show with
With Jason that you're not gonna be mean to him are you I'm gonna be honest
Okay, and if he can't he can't deal with it and he walks out that's his tough luck
Never wore well good. That's very gutsy and that
Braves all great of me a balsy guy right he's got can we afford his right corner and he's got
Bubba my season is corner okay, and if he starts quoting from the scripture that's gonna end
I'm gonna ask him. I'm gonna ask him not oh he can try but I have plenty
I'll address that right in the beginning okay if he wants to start quoting all these Neanderthals from
5,000 years ago who thought every time it rained it was an act of God more power to him
I was gonna discourage him from getting into that. I'll think you know
This should be interesting, but you don't mean because he's a nice guy. No, he's not a nice guy
He's a nice guy like Mussolini was a nice guy. He even got the train to run on time. He just misguided
Yeah, right. Mm-hmm. He's up. He's a right that was a hateful
He's a right wing hateful. Sal is what he is okay a right wing. Sal and of course a Sal
No, I didn't say putt. Sal was a female. Oh, no, I thought you said that before though
I think he's kind of like a Morpheus this guy. I mean him thinking he knows what he is
Well made by sure and I don't want to well. I don't want to find out. Well, I don't mean in that way

Send away to Arizona for all that right wing literature all the time in a california, you know out to orange county
Dave county hello
hi
Hi
I have a fire report on Jamie Lee Curtis for glad. Oh she was on last night. I saw
Oh no this I read in the magazine over the weekend uh huh in red book
And it says that she's been married for five years right to what
Huh to what
That she is married. I don't know. I heard she's marrying to a fig tree
I
Don't know it seems that he's she spotted him and uh
I guess in the rolling stone or something and said well that's a guy. I'm gonna marry and that's what happened
Uh-huh. I don't know who he is
Anyway, they have a two and a half year old daughter. Right. Wow. That's true. But she's adopted. Oh
And this um magazine article said that she won't state why you know
You can't have children. Huh, but anyway, I'm talking. Look at this
Yes, she was on last night. Who was on with her? I don't remember but I remember she had a floor link
But boy she looked uh talk about anorexic she looked like she's doing the Karen Carpenter syndrome all over again
She did bad the story says she had a lot of problems
You know being Tony Curtis. Well, you know, it's funny at last night now somebody had mentioned it a long time ago
And I'd forgotten it and then last night when I was looking at her it it read just funny
You should mention that now it rang up in my mind that she was Tony Curtis's daughter
And then I thought to myself well that answers all the questions
I've heard I mean I can't repeat them on the air
But I've heard stories about Tony Curtis that would make you just do summer assault you would just go nuts
Well, that's the kind of really a really bizarre guy
The story kind of went into you know very lightly
Lightly that's a problem he had had but yeah
And their relationship which wasn't the greatest
Mm-hmm
In fact when he played that role in the Boston strang there remember that uh-huh that was the most normal role that I think
Oh, but he was so good in Houdini was he yeah, okay
Whatever you say okay see you later
Yeah, I had forgotten that she was Tony Curtis's daughter
So it goes to show you that there are more than seven wonders of the world
Broward County hello. Yeah, just a couple things
Um
Sorry to hear that Hank was the money in the Dolphin's uh yesterday. Did he oh yeah, we had the same book
Hank if you're listening
Now you can't even get that bottom
It is it's part for his money
Pete Rose syndrome, you know
Well anyway, I maybe you can went it back by putting money on Viola tonight because I don't think you know kill kisses got a chance
Really I don't think it last piece of threatening hey if he gets by the first thing I'll be delirious
But Viola you know is a little shell shocked you know what I mean
Well, yeah, the metton score runs for him they don't score lately. They don't score runs for anybody
They scored one run in the last two games in Montreal
Well, you know lengthens a good picture. Well, yeah, but how come he lost like his last four decisions?
I think although he did pitch a good game. I saw a lot of it. No, uh
well
You did you read that Langston might sign with the cubs next year?
No, I didn't read it at all. Well, I'm just telling you yeah
He gave like five or six cities that he's willing to assign with why I don't I don't think he's gonna stay in Montreal
I think they're gonna rude the day they gave up all that money for him because you know, he's what is he 11 12 and 7 now
I think not that great, you know 12 and 7 isn't the setting the world on fire
Well, I mean they don't score runs for him either. If you look at what that's true. That's true
But then Viola's what two and five
Yeah, yeah, well
Uh, both Jackson will be a Yankee next year. That's some inside information. No, I think it's gonna be Keith Jackson
No, no, BoJack keep Jackson. He's gonna sign for 40 million dollars for 10 years
Okay, well that's George boys got a sense of humor doesn't he? Well, you don't think that BoJack is worth it
40 million no for 10 years. No, that's four million a year
Yeah, but by the time he gets into the sixth or seventh year of his country now let him they can get red
They can get Reggie Jackson back a lot cheaper
All right his dealership Jackson's dealership is going down to tubes and San Diego
In fact, I think it would be great knowing Steinbrenner with his sense of humor
He could get an all Jackson team he could get Michael Jackson
Great Jackson
Mayhalia Jackson he could get an all Jackson team would be fanning Michael Jackson you know the pitches. Yeah, I know
Well, I know the one that catches you look at us and have a great day and a good life. Okay, you do okay
I was really worked up to a friend. He wasn't because viola is gonna pitch. I don't
Don't get over enthusiastic sir
You met fans should learn that a long time ago. Don't get carried away
I keep hearing oh this is the time they're gonna do that the big surges coming the big surges coming
It's just it never happened and it isn't gonna come it's like hurricane Hugo all these news people got everybody worked up into a
Lather into a cold sweat. They're got everybody going nuts go out and tape up the windows and get those batteries
And it's just gonna look like what blow blow some of the condos down problem
Surely
Now that would be terrible wouldn't it
If it like if it wiped out the beach yeah, all the condos it would be well
We got a chance in a big comeback. So I'm gonna get out with Reverend Polis and we're gonna pray for Hugo
This afternoon
We don't want anybody to get hurt just the buildings right it's kind of like a neutron bomb
In reverse, wasn't the neutron bomb the one that killed the people left the building standing right
Yes, yes, well with this is hurricane Hugo is the opposite it's gonna not kill the people just not all the buildings down
And of course if anybody has to go to the hurricane shelter
I hope we can repeat the sites we saw during hurricane David
When all the people were going what's the matter don't you have any salami and Swiss on ride
They thought they were going to a country club or something instead of a civil defense. You'll remember that boy
