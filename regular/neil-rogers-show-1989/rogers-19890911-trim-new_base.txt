uh...
uh...
uh...
okay it's eleven o five at w i would be see all the possibilities that
it goes with anything that's
uh...
opulent jingles are kind of fit with anything we have an open line in
brown right now or really uh... very concerned about it
in fact we had a meeting
a staff meeting about it during the eleven o'clock news
at five to four w i would be the gentleman who eats corvettes with his
mustang is on the line right now
five and all
well mustang is a lot there's no question about it hot car and uh... i don't
i don't know though
perhaps probably
you probably stay away from the z r one though i would well yeah
anything that's out of the lembrick in the six
yeah exactly and i don't know the nineties pre-i can't really notice yet
because they've only had it for one day but it's uh... it's fans
all you'll get you'll get around to it you'll
you'll feel the
the the feel the power
see i start out when i you know i get to stop light i pull along when i get a
new car pull on side like a fero or something like that
but i think i'll maybe a chavette you know
on the contrary i lost to super not long ago did you
well i'll tell you what i'll meet you with my super will see what happens
well you know
i'm in the highway will start out slow then we'll work up to the bed
you know i still think for the well for the money i mean the vet is beautiful
car but you know the mustang is a fornably fast
i don't need to be the first one i got to be for how much
fourteen thousand dollars oh no that is that is uh...
lawyer right but i got to tell you because you know i have that for are that
incredibly expensive piece of uh... garbage very fast well it is very fast but
it's just uh... it's so damn expensive but but the one great thing about
for are is though the increase in value that that cars were thirty thousand
dollars more now than when i bought it
all right absolutely here
what i don't think they're not gonna make it more so the June of next year
yeah and so they say in five years that cars going to be worth a fortune and
all of that
but it's a beautiful but the plan to make is that of that
and not the zr one but just a regular corvette is is is really a bargain is
compared to like a lot of those uh... real expensive foreign cars you know
like for are is an important no no like you're saying early about the seventeen
inch treb you know you can't you can't lose a thought i think the uh...
the night of eighteen inch
i think i don't think i know you're right there bigger than even the other
ones you're right
they're incredible but you know when you uh... when you blow tire you got a
work uh...
you got to work hard to buy one yet
yet all i know
i thought are they about three hundred bucks
uh... i think don't you have the uh... the good year eighteen inch catered
back from that mistaken
how do you know that
well i'm in the cars yes
they're expensive they're like two ninety five yeah i guess about that now i
argue about five bucks okay when you get to three hundred uh... you just round
it off
forgive me
in fact as my fact that was my choice i was either going to put new tires on the
eighty eight that i had a fine new and i figured might as well buy the new one
well with so many miles of your idea
uh... about twenty nine thousand all that car was a cherry
i don't speak
absolutely
well listen i'll see out there in a highway so governor self-according to recognize
my most thing
what it's black invasion of the light
and have a what has a light rack
a light wreck
a light rack
or act that you said wreck
no rack
i've had a few cars that looked like that with the light wreck
okay listen take care of yourself
good day
see you
it's eleven oh nine at w i i would be i guess there's my first challenge boy just
to get a new car more excited this guy's already uh... wants to drag
or he was in drag one of the other
uh... for look at those phones today what the hell's going on man they're just
sizzling today

uh...
reaction after the dolphin law school was a good game i mean they didn't have the
lead to the last

we don't want to get into this too deeply if you know what i mean
i really don't want to get into the senator in a way i'll come right down and
grab me right off the air
the thing is he doesn't hold on to what he's got you know what i mean

you know why you see what time it is joe's on now
oh jesus and i understand he's got the smeg green um
follow up to that big show he had with smeg on friday
oh well she's everywhere isn't she then she is just like a legend in her own
mind that smeg she is phenomenal she knows nothing
about the finances or money or anything else but she looks good she really does
she's a very attractive lady who knows nothing
and that's the kind of show that we strive for here at wio d is to have a lot of
people on who either sound good look good or a combination of both and know
nothing at all speaking of that steve this afternoon
has got marvin oh this is such a morbid topic i hate to even promo it isn't in
morbid yes it is look at nick nick hey if steves do it and nick says it's got to be
okay what are you doing in here what are you here for so early are you kind of
like the go for now you just kind of run around and okay here comes a message
now because we got all everybody's got their own board op now
roger does renery show exclusively marvin is doing our show because he wanted to
get off at night oh you're doing sharen's job yeah that's right oh nick is doing
sharen's job so he kind of like checks the facts machine
and he puts out these in sip and little promo sheets well we know sharen is history did you
weren't listening when we said goodbye to her on friday no he wasn't paying any attention because
he figured well the salas they got to put up with this crap so i'm not paying any attention
and he was doing some business he was writing some business on the hotline yeah we were
sharing the best i really missed the boat so to speak the other day but i kind of i kind of
was shocked because she brought that motley crew in that she she ran off with it look like
from one of those pirate movies yes what was that awful movie with Christopher
Atkins not Phoebe Cates was Phoebe Cates in it paradise no that was with Willie Ames what was
no this is a Linda Blair Christopher Atkins some pirate movie they were on this ship and he was
running around naked as always and she kept spinning her head around and throwing a pea soup
on the ship that movie is what that crew looked like that she had in here man oh man did you
did you see her boyfriend captain hook oh my god he was all shm what see and he looked like
with a patch over his eye and with uh uh what do they call those phony hands you know
oh hook yeah there's a word that goes before that but we can't say it's 11 13
13
better req come on come on Johnny
oh
amazing don't mess with Johnny
what a card what a god oh god ladies and gentlemen we've discovered the magic heart
that's magic with a G yeah that's right hey whatever happened with waxy that everybody was
supposed to get fired and the sale of the station was supposed to go through and they're all
gonna auction off rickie's cap and they're all still there they sure are well what the hell
happened I guess the sale didn't go through I may be not probably senator in a way is checking
it out make sure that the he doesn't want rickie off the air he said if it's the last thing he does
by the way we want to welcome to w i o d boy giri's new assistant from lua villa you know the
incredible this guy that he brought in his name is joelle i just found that out two on the same
day isn't that a isn't that a bitch you go a whole lifetime you never meet one guy named joelle
and then all of a sudden two within an hour is that what you're gonna call him joelle that we're
gonna refer to him as boy giri and joelle we got a mobile on two hello hello Neil yes sir
yeah i'm the same one the same guy that called the other day about the dog situation
oh yeah you know your name isn't joelle is it no this is how we got three in one day we'd be in the
Guinness Book of Records easy your name is what oh that bill bill bill in a car phone bill on a mobile
yeah bill on a mobile phone i'm gonna mobile phone oh man now let me say uh Leo i heard all about your
new bright shining uh Corvette oh boy this is the talk of the town isn't i'm the first guy in
town i think with a 90 vet probably not but that's what they told me that more let me tell you
let me say something to you that bill colder gave us full details i know i heard him mention something
about yesterday or this morning and then some guy called in and was talking about my white
cattle act or something well no no i have a yellow cattle act you have a white vet let's put
there we go let's let's get it straight okay now i think the only thing i want to mention is that
i want to congratulate you of course and i want to thank up a collection
what help me pay for the car stereo system more as i kiadris one of the other yeah well i think the
last one is probably the right one i'm like i called my mother last night to uh brace her for the
shock because you know every Tuesday i go over there for dinner so tomorrow i'll be driving over
there in the new vet and i just wanted to brace her for the shock and of course she said well
you needed that like a whole other yeah oh boy well when i say i go out and buy a new underwear
she gets all hysterical you know all right couldn't you have so many old ones together
what you have a nice day okay bye now see ya it's 20 past 11 boy everybody's in such a good
mood today it's shocking isn't it i guess that dolphin loss brought them back to reality or something
although i i shouldn't say that because they played a hell of a game they really did far far
beyond anybody's wildest dreams and then only to blow it in the last two seconds for that's
that is so typical of Jim Kelly you know that's just right up his alley
i wish i wish Jim Kelly could play for the cowboys with jj and they could go oh in 16
wouldn't that be great that is really a shame though that the cowboys never even put a point
on the board they were really tossing their muscle around so to speak in the preseason and
showing everybody how great they were now all of a sudden when the game is really count jj gets
slaughtered 28 to nothing by the saints no less well i'd be embarrassed wouldn't you i'd be
humiliated and probably when they play the first home game in Dallas the fans are going to start
screaming we want landry you know stuff like that and goodbye jimmy probably have jimmy johnson
blue doll stuff like that 21 past 11 at wio d i guess we better take a little break here because
we got those trends coming in don't we this hour oh my god you're getting real nervous about that
wait a minute maybe we got to do a little dick feral promo i pledge allegiance to the flag
okay just a little bit at a time in fact i have a great idea remember how we used to play two
carts like alternately back and forth sure okay we can kind of get harry and dick feral's kids
together there that's appropriate oh god 21 past 11 at wio d we don't want to talk too loud
it's a Monday we don't want to wake up the natives but we do want to tell you about the melting
under one i don't care if i ever get back okay i'm harry they're out of control
once they get going we're just stopping these people 25 after 11 at wio d
for those trends are coming in 20 minutes a lot of pressure now who would you say is that of the
most pressure in this trend i better not ask them now Miami hello yeah how are you today great
busy you missed that guy's call he told you he was black and bay who light red and he'll be looking
for you the trooper oh that's what i got once he's got a supercharged five oh yeah okay with that
i didn't understand anything he was talking about he has a supercharged front end
no supercharged supercharged one say that say that for the king show okay we don't discuss those
kind of things are first and who do you think ladies is sleeping with the keepers job come on now
what kind of a statement is that i don't know have any ideas okay let's let you know
that's all those people that put the dolphins down they're playing the team that's going to be
in the super ball and they didn't i don't know why you say i don't agree with it i think buffalo
i mean don't give me wrong not taking anything away from the dolphins but i think buffalo is
overrated buffalo is not going to be in the super ball you know just because Larry king says so
doesn't make it so yeah i only wish not after yesterday i don't okay call me 50 dollars
okay 26 past 11 at w.i.d the lines are beginning to thin out now we have a couple of open lines
one in data one of Palm Beach it was only just make believe here at the beginning
just want to give us a false sense of security okay let's see if there's one more on here
that i think would be really good exercise for Johnny boy pressure down here is the name with the
most pressure
yeah this didn't step on now that was fair close to show you even Johnny's not perfect
coconut creek hello hello Neil how are you great yeah it's called up i want to complain a little bit
okay let's get right down to it this is what we're here for that's right this is south Florida it's my
right to come that's right if you want to say anything on this show sir listen uh you know
the heroes craft about that one arm band that i've been washing it and giving you problems now
oh now don't say that that's terrible i know it's terrible that's a problem
but wait a minute what do you mean the herald huh the herald is no no i'm gonna talk about the
herald too but i wasn't talking about it the herald band it up in Washington no i don't mean that don't
keep repeating that what that's grotesque i know i'm sitting here could you mean one arm band he
doesn't have one arm doesn't it's your done away yeah oh that's right that's a war injury
well don't say that about our great beloved senator in a way yeah you're right i'm sitting here
one my fingers almost chopped off i'm sitting home from work for a month now i'm gonna be a chronic
on your show now what do you do slice bread now i got caught in the air conditioner fan motor
oh yeah wow anyway god almighty thank god it was only your finger yeah can you imagine the
possibilities oh i'm gonna get a little too close i don't be saying those awful things because you
know jacks on the award processor right now sending letters off to our good friend senator our
good liberal democrat from hawaii senator in a way this one i thought it's such a masterful job
at the iran country hearings yeah so up and on is about you okay well wait a minute did you see
the peace what about channel seven no i didn't see it was on last night no it's not i think what nobody
saw it boy that's quite a commentary that almost nobody in the world has seen it we had one guy who
called it who saw it and nobody's watching channel seven news i guess i think that's quite a
quite a barometer the rich and i don't know i just rose in the wrong way so to speak oh boy don't
that's a line i'm not even gonna touch and my army herald two weeks ago last sunday they had a
thing on the in the tropics section you know the magazine section yeah my favorite yeah on the front
covers dav Barry he was holding a basketball up okay with middle finger okay on purpose yeah showing
you the benefit yeah what kind of a disgusting gesture is that all those little kids see that
Dave what are they gonna think of that that's right they might do something all those matter
fact most of those kids are giving Dave back the same gesture because they read his column okay
and they know how boring is Dave Barry is the epitome of this community okay he's pathetic he's
never said a funny thing in his life but it's some of the things i've read the only funny thing he
ever said was only fifty dollars well couple things i've read a magazine section i mean i can't
believe print it i mean in bookshareed so they think they use the vulgar vulgar vulgar vulgar
i think we need a senate investigation of everything i think we ought to have rampant censorship
and all the kids in school instead of the pledge of allegiance ought to be forced to sing dutch land
uberales what the hell are these people doing complaining about you when they can just turn your
damn radio off instead of listening to your well they don't have any they don't have anything better
to do and they don't like the fact that they think i troll for sex on the air it's incredible
thing sir if i'm trolling for sex on the air i'm probably the most unsuccessful radio broadcasters
in the history of america because i've forgotten even what it's like it's terrible i can't believe it's
terrible well i guess i'm missing a thing
hey just by the way i just thought joey showed us now he's doing aerobics just now with some guys
uh he was doing aerobics with some guy was what of named joel it looked like joel yeah poor joey boy
it's really something i'm glad that he's working but i don't think it's going to be for too long
long i'm gonna start being a chronic in your show now i'm gonna call you my name is luid
dey on becoming from coven a creek at least twice a week now
luid dey from coven a kruvalex what we need we need a new bunch of chronics not to replace some
of the old one that's right i'm gonna do nothing i'm crippled i got to call you up and bother you
no you're not crippled you had a little accident that's not going to last forever is it
no i'll be ill be for a couple of months i'll be laid up i'll be able to do much uh-huh
so when you call we can say it's luid the geek in coconut creek or you can call every alive
is that is that coconut creek yeah sure that's great luid the geek in coconut creek that's wrong
i said luid dey but you can call me luid the geek it's all right okay luid all right you're great
american that you're not gonna talk to me are you luid i'll talk one not not next time next time
all right okay luid thank you don't try to keep him on the line now
finally get rid of them there he said all those disgusting and temperate things about our
beloved senator in a way we don't even live in hawaii we can't vote for him although i would like
to live in hawaii but not not if he's going to turn out to be a nerd okay i thought he was a pretty
good guy but i guess he's a governing himself accordingly these days plus we never even saw the
peace anyway i wonder if Cheryl is listening up front did we ever get the peace from our friends
over next to our channel seven because we were going to work on that see if we couldn't find out
what it was about dick feral is on line eight ladies and gentlemen one of america's truly great talents
hey it's none of your bleeping business get off my phone and go to sleep i'm going to keep playing

rod knows what you mean when you say well listen now that i know you're a one-time
new york police officer we have to speak nicely about you because you might take down the
license plate number of my new vet well actually i don't know what it looks like so it doesn't
really matter well you know it's not really too hard to figure out listen we're going to have a
lot of problems because i'm an exposed man you're a what an exposed man oh great well i knew you had a
lot of problems that's gonna burn you today is he really he's really he's really been burning his
last three starts he's one and two with their and run average of almost six in his last three
starts he's been getting bombed well it seems to me seems to me the first time that the cubs met
life's been up in matriol Dawson at a three-round homer in the first inning and they beat him four to
three i could be wrong but i think that yeah that's right listen the song by the grassroots is not
called it welcome a million miles this i'd wait a million years oh oh my god i know it's gonna be
out of eight to eleven that eight to midnight we have another we have another nitpicker joining the
stand w-i-o-d we could use another nose picker but not another nitpicker well listen welcome to w-i-o-d
i think you sir and when you're gonna start October second October second well what's the day
today September the eleventh year that's getting pretty close course you know the trends are going
to be out any minute now yes and you better keep your fingers crossed not for what because you want
to be a great addition to the staff isn't it boy oh boy come here really care about ratings

that's all accounts and the good news for yours exactly well we're looking forward to it and i
certainly hope you clean up your act before you come over here it's already split polish clean like
your new vet great okay we'll see you by there he is dick feral remember his ice cream parlors
up in Detroit you never heard of ferals are we gonna have to go through this again
i forgot what kind of a goy-eisha cuff are you anyway that you never heard of ferals ice cream
parter everybody in the audience who knows ferals look at that every nobody knows ferals
you know he knows ferals Marvin uh once met somebody named feral i think he was joel
you don't know from ferals it's an ice cream parter i think they had one or they have one in day
land don't they are they used to what is it what is the one in um in westland oh well he don't
know from westland are you kidding me you know westland hey i used to live in highly a pal right block
away i'm good at highly do you know that i used to jack of go crazy when he hears this this is true
i used to live a block away from my emmy lakes high yeah now if he knew that and the amazing part of
it is i never drove through the parking lot i never trolled for anybody over there and um huh i guess
i missed out based on what jack is saying these days but no i lived there for a year 1977
so i'm very familiar with that with westland yeah that may you're not hmm i don't think they let me
in there and do they don't you have a passport it's eleven thirty five together with a page
glue kind of like from the w n w school by the way speaking of wld want to say especially
good morning to Dennis Collins this morning because we certainly know that Dennis is either
monitoring directly or indirectly still over the weekend fought a lot more communications between
our friend jack and um Dennis Collins no just uh seeming like a never ending back and forth
pattern now you talk about the general manager at the w n w s yeah yes are Dennis yeah isn't that
kind of bizarre i guess it's just a coincidence it's eleven thirty eight at w i o d for
lottery hello okay nice to talk into you candle a zeta spy report yeah good zeta
spy report this is amazing you mean and are they still on the air um well they've gone beyond
turning the corner i think now they have governed themselves accordingly um you may have heard
this one before though what about who is this yeah you know this is boy this is uh listen to that
boy i've got a call today oh man what i thought that he's auditioning for the nick feral show
not quite um by the way you're involved in those writings you're just uh
prominently and they're all over the place well that call all the time i should be yeah
oh yeah i'm sorry that's okay did you know that every monday is commercial free monday on zeta
yes oh god i didn't know if you guys had no that out of the way yeah the bird already kind of
herited the sound so to speak last week okay i didn't hear that because they can't sell the show
now they go with commercial free i thought they were already doing they were used to that ever since we
left they had commercial free two day Thursday Saturday i don't wait for the commercial free week
the week i you know i when you get a new car you set the buttons on your radio and i put a button
on there because used to be once in a while i got every fifth record i enjoyed so i had a button
on there and last night i punched them up and i don't know i don't understand what they're playing
anymore do you i don't know the traffic in the stones i took them off my radio i took them off
i don't know what they're playing i put love 94 back on i did oh my god you are trying to really
get i did look at this gloves 94 i did they need your help i know i know they're really need you
badly don't take it personally Greg but uh you know it can't hurt all right the trends will be
in soon and you can get the truth of cloud you'll probably have them on your computer right oh not me
any second not not me have a great day probably okay it's 11 40 at w-i-o-d wow this is really exciting
that was by the way jack that was justice sarcastic joke that he'd have him on a computer ready
was just a joke you don't have to call up our patronage all of oh god it's it if you could see
those notes sweet what we need to do is get some tv time because on radio it's not effective enough
get some tv time and show first of all we have a camera panning in on these stacks and stacks and
stacks of letters and notes and ramblings and uh oh it's just amazing i mean this is two years of
somebody's life involved in harassment and surveillance and uh being a general pain in the ass
what a way to go huh but of course the god that told him to do this that's right that's what
turkey modest said too del ray hello yeah hello nil yeah i was watching that abc program
and in a way also said wait a minute abc program and bc i'm sorry no the one was in no
used to be in bc now we're getting warmer all right what i want with sally fits whatever it was
okay uh obvious you're gonna have a good grasp of what it was in a way also said that the
he's gonna have the scc check into the uh licensing of wio due because it's coming up for
e-newrow yeah we already know that okay uh what did you wait wait a minute don't now just a minute
did he mention me by name yes he did senator in a way and uh the program itself had a picture of you
at your board with all your lights and the telephones and everything else so uh let's clarify
this again senator in a way said he's gonna get neo roger's off the earth it's
said that he's gonna try to get you off oh he's gonna check into it to find out
exactly because he has some papers of you yes and he's gonna check into that and have the scc check
into wio these wouldn't wouldn't you think before he'd make an intemperate and juvenile remark
like he's gonna try to get me off the air that they would conduct the investigation first rather than
to uh make such such an outrageous statement well let's uh let's put it this way he's still a roger
okay uh one other thing i wanted to bring out the video besides this yes uh i'm only down here
about almost a year and on uh wmca in new york there was a tortshow host uh barry jr would
be very gray no not very gray no sir very Epstein he's on well whatever his name is well this guy
was a maniac very good very many act uh one thing he said was that he wanted all the boys that
uh were circumcised to suit their parents for for disfiguring them hmm this guy screamed and yell
when i say screamed and yell he did and finally he got a whole of one guy that called in
and this guy really laced into this guy the guy only lasted on wmca 13 weeks they forced him to
make a public apology to this man that he lambed that on the on the on the well let me ask you the
guy that he lambed that year was he circumcised well whether he was maybe his nose was circumcised
now knows but the thing was that the guy was no fool and he told them he wrote a letter to them
and he put in the bid for wmca his license so he must have had quite a bit of money also yeah
now the thing is that the people that probably watched that uh news broadcast are probably smart enough
not to listen to you that's why you don't have too many people well what do you what does that say
about you sir okay well i'm glad you had 1144 at wio d we have an open line at least his honesty was
refreshing what correct not too intimidating but somewhat refreshing we have an open line in
dates 751 wio d and one in boca at 278 9463 278 wio d so evidently now that was an entirely different
version of the story from the one we heard from the earlier caller and here we've been on for
almost two hours and we've got two whole people who saw that on channel seven news so they
obviously are really having a tremendous impact in the market and like i said since the story
allegedly was about me it's unfortunate that we're so far from their studios that they couldn't
have come across the walkway and talked to me about it could they would have been a little bit too
tough candle hello hey hello yeah not much how about i'm sir they're doing it hey
some serious but some serious but yeah hey bird how about those cuts he isn't going to respond
hey me i don't know if i you know if it's kind of important but i heard that lady in wws what's her name
sandy yeah or debi Ellis they have a lot of ladies like w and w was some of them have got
one that was from ten to twelve or something oh Alice rantell no no the other one
debi Ellis right she almost said she was saying to be in the way at the end of her show and she
almost said w i o d really that's probably wishful thinking on debi's part we are we you know we
have a problem because i can just barely squeeze through the doorway debi would never get in the building
she'd have to do the show from the parking lot oh yeah yeah um well uh can i call somebody
do you yeah don't don't beat around the bush this is a listen no matter what senator in a way says
sir the first amendment is still alive and well this is america and we're not going to let some douchebag
from hulae come over and tell us what we can say on the radio okay that's right go ahead
yeah i want to call Alex and uh her the douchebag and uh and guy he's a douchebag there can be no
question about it hey Neil yeah i mean i don't want to have any harsh feelings nothing like that but
this is like kind of a chronic cough is it yeah who is this uh fabian well you were okay today all right
you just wouldn't have told us that at the end it would have been a lot better 1146 a w i o d we
do have an opening in date at 7519463 751 w i d i like that guy they called about that emcee telecast
who didn't know what network it was on what channel it was on who the people were but he sure
all knew about that nea rogers and how embarrassing it was to admit that he was listening to the show
see people intelligent enough to watch the news he has a good point wouldn't be listing the
so what was his excuse that's the 64 dollar question and when he calls us again like two years
from tischerbohg maybe he'll give us the answer 13 till new and boy those trends are going to be
out any second now i mean you like um god what under tremendous pressure you can just feel the
walls vibrating oh that must be gtr cranking it up again in there we'll come back we don't have
anything to do here right now we're just uh say a little long singing the song we'll be right back
renary here i know you've all heard about heavy metal music how is it affecting your children
what is it causing your teenagers to do tomorrow morning on the next inside edition of the
micrenary program which occurs from 5 30 to 10 o'clock we're going to get to the bottom of heavy
metal music we're bringing in a tuba player 5 30 tomorrow morning on new stock radio 6 10 w i o d
i don't need death and patty her together again they're making a new movie or they're in a movie
together called crybaby it's john water's new movie it's johnny depth will be the star
be out probably i something about him you know he um because i remember very vividly the day we
did that show with him in the studio there he's he's one of those people who looks um entirely he's
like a chameleon you know i mean in other words on like monday he can look one way you know what i'm
picture yeah he you're in down to his puppet he doesn't look like himself in that picture with patty
her no that's what i'm talking about it looks like about 20 different people yeah but anyway you folks
don't care about that it's 10 before noon at w i o d we're just sitting here breathlessly awaiting
the arrival of those trends who's gonna bring these now the charities in here and your land has
gone to who's probably nick that's right and are you going to believe the numbers that nick brings
in here that's the question okay he's probably going to doctor the numbers before he brings him
to the studio pompano good morning now yes sir boy does this is a big day big day for cubs fan
big day for Montreal a big day for Montreal this is their season it is yeah the three they have
six left three Chicago and three in Montreal i know that and uh you know this could be a this
could be something you're gonna you're just gonna hate why is that you imagine a Montreal Toronto world
no i really can't in the way the expos are playing they've lost 13 eight of their last 13 and 23
of their last 36 well they're really doing it well they're doing it if they continue doing it in
about a week you can forget about you know oh canada yeah is uh is uh them are back on this three day
rotation no that no that's why he pitched Wilson yesterday and he struck out 10 men and five
and he's pitched a great game well we get a chance then there you go let's go get him who
Montreal Montreal yeah well good luck to you sir that Langston is pitching today boy he's really hot
okay Neil good luck to you sir you'll need it Montreal fans he must be an Alice Rantellisner huh
because you know Alice is a big that's right very very monster expos. He must be nuts yeah he must
be on the right on the edge especially when these trends come up boy there is somebody now now we
have the new lineup Dennis Collins new revised and the refurbished lineup over there they shuffle those
cards and I think this trend will go a long way to showing us what that's going to be all about can't
wait hmm that'd be exciting and uh Greg and Donald of course is sitting out there in separate rooms
waiting breathlessly yeah who else is like hanging on a thread of course callers hoping for a little
upswing here this would be a first indication perhaps of something Irene Richard Irene Richard is
out there just shaking in her nose now if she has a bad trend you're not going to knock her are you
not me make some kind of vicious assault on Irene Richard if she has like a really bomb of a trend
you're not going to do that what you got me confused with some other guy yeah you would never do now
okay there's an open-line and brow now if you move very very fast because they've been just
coming out of here like crazy they haven't they like termites coming out of the woodwork 524
wiod and let's go to Miami hello hi Neil how you doing okay um I saw that channel seven reporter
about you okay now let's now this is the third one so this is kind of like the tie breaking vote
on what it was all about okay now was it an ABC report no it was channel seven oh Jane
Acre with the reporter for it and um what they were basically they talk Jane who Jane Acre
Acre well however they pronounce that's correct Jane Acre well anyway that isn't correct
that's not how she's pronouncing her name Acre yeah I think so yeah it is yeah oh well anyway
what a Yahoo way to pronounce your name man anyway what they they interview my Disney
for a while speaking of Yahoo yeah really and um they show a pick they show a tape of you eating oh yeah
well that figures that figure and um shrimp no doubt that could have been anytime exactly um Zeta
yes oh they showed that tape they showed that Zeta tape well it's too far for them to come over here
and take new uh file footage you know it's much too far so they just rely on the old stuff yeah
obviously oh that's about it I'd like to call no no wait a minute that's not about it you didn't
tell me anything all they were talking about was the uh the uh challenge the to the FTC license
right right and what did Senator in a way say um they didn't actually show him talking they showed
a tape of them but not speaking directly about you as far back in remember uh-huh well it's
certainly conflicts with that old fart that called it a little while ago who I think was making it
up as he went along weren't you from Delray what the hell is he now yeah well that's it okay well
it's fascinating we've had three calls on that news clip and every one of them is a totally
different story yeah isn't this great now all this guy wants to do his call his friend a douchebag
okay go ahead all right I'd like to call Bob LeBaron and boy no wait a minute wait a minute now
you laughed over his uh thing there come on who is it Bob LeBaron and Boyton Beach uh real
nearly a douchebag okay and by the way Jack governed this accordingly okay good cause okay by
the way he'll be right over to take down your number it's eleven fifty five at w i o d another
open line now and date on the heels of that sensational call oh I know what I wanted to tell you
Friday guess what they had on c-span you know every now and then they show a talk show on c-span
they they go in and they tape a whole show and they just go into studio and you see a radio show
with the commercials and everything they had the jury William show from w r k o in Boston it was so
ponderous that it was comatose it was incredibly boring um shocking talking about heavy
we're talking about barney frank were they yeah and they had the three people on there who um
were dressed in drag and uh no seriously they talked about that and then they got in to say he had
an open hour and the calls went on much too long first of all yeah and the spots the live spots
he was doing like we're so geriatric it was sounded like w o l d i mean he had a lot of them
and I and don't get me wrong I think Jerry's terrific but it's just he's doing that same old
stick boring you know and then he was promoting the fact that next the sometime next year they're
going to have the second annual c-span was kind of enough together the first one they're going to
have the second annual talk show host convention and he's the president of this group of self-important
talk show host right also be there oh Alice and Mike segal he mentioned Mike segal's name is
it buddy you know his underlings it was it was really boring dick feral probably be there
now are you going to pick on dick girl i will grant you i must say that he's called that we had
a little while ago is really ponderous and very puzzling yes wasn't it for a guy that's coming to work
here and looks and wants us to say nice things about him i thought it was really a disgusting call
it was like a troublemaker yeah exactly but that's his nature he's a troublemaker and a provocateur and
and of course the thinking is here that he's going to come in at night and stir everybody up
and get a lot of listeners and the certainly good luck to him because boy Gary and his sibling
a little little loella what a joella joel we're the ones who evidently came up with this masterful
stroke and it the no doubt will be tremendous okay let's take a call from pepper pine cello
hey don't miss the Roger okay to me you got the first time caller and you got the
greatest shield in the history of broadcast there i'm just the ability i listen to you every
morning well bless you sir and uh a friend of mine told me he was having trouble with
the server system i got one and uh i could you know this great you know i wouldn't have a cable
for anything in the world well you're absolutely right i would and i've got mine all straight
in that night i wouldn't i don't disagree with you at all you get everything that's ever been
invented and the cable companies are just a stick it to you they give you whatever the hell they want
and uh it's wrong right in fact the senator in a way wants to get involved in something useful
why doesn't he go after the cable company that's the true instead of running around telling
everybody he he might get neo roger's off the air just uh no he shake up to me on back he's
fair yeah you know thanks a lot mister okay sir have a great day okay bye bye two minutes till new to
w.i.o.d the time is getting closer and i see they said eleven forty five but i guess that's when
they started feeding them on the computers perhaps probably or not as the case maybe but during
the new news we'll go back there and check it out and see who's being naughty and nice and maybe
they're holding stuff back on us now a spike wise in the building doing now probably if it's trend day
because if it's trend day and there's stuff in there we can count on him to come rushing in here
especially if gtr goes up even even marginally okay even just no seriously he'll come racing in here
and keep mentioning ninety seven gtr over and over again to the point of being juvenile and embarrassing
that's our bill yeah well he liked that the Beatles record act naturally that was his favorite and
he certainly does it all times okay well that's gonna just about do it and i can't believe we've
uh... excuse me killed two hours and here we are at the halfway mark for this is great it's
kind of like all downhill from here on in steve this afternoon with that uh... incredible show
marvin winestein with parents of murdered children and then on sports talk uh... speaking of crime
we have uh... the dolphin edition with rick weaver talking about uh... how just letting that slip
away from us in the last seconds yesterday be a lot of gnashing a teeth and speaking of gnashing
chuck my outstanding by with a new and wio d news and we'll come back as it gets closer and closer
to the moment of truth for broadcasters all over this god for sink and town
kick an ass with fifty thousand callers ladies and gentlemen this is the lightning row on the
new rudder show okay well it's twelve oh six uh... uh... i i don't know what wion z jingle i don't
want to hear that you know it's ponderous and it's embarrassing well we're up to a four eight
again on uh... wio d from a four four and it still includes that bogus motha june uh... so when
the summer book comes out christ we do have the alix benefit on the uh... which remains to be a
scene they have four asterisk but they're gonna but seriously uh... twelve plus w i do my back
up to a four eight and i have a feeling that w snooze and wion z probably are down there in the uh...
in the upper twos or low three upper twos is my prediction uh... two eight two nine right around
in there twelve plus with ancient demographics so now we're just waiting all the hot shots bill wise
is out there and disney is standing around like he understands the number and uh... boy gary has got
real he's got double suspended on the uh... while he was nervous the trends were coming in the
figure of the first pair snapped he better have a backup and uh... his by his partner in crime
joelle was back there i i haven't even seen joelle does anybody know who that is
yeah i met him sure oh yeah guy uh...
yeah curts he's curts that's what the key is and so i see uh... like uh... the guy that called
in before okay it's twelve oh seven of the dot dot almost nothing i don't know what happened but
i think that everybody's just on pins and needles now for these numbers probably and well
that's a good sign the station overall twelve plus one up from a four four in the last
trend to a four eight now this is june july in august ok for the arbitrage trends the arbitrage
and uh... all june is not a valid part of the summer book but they go three months at a time it's a
rolling number and of course there are a lot of people in the business rolling in the aisles
right now okay waiting for those numbers to come in and the people at eleven ninety four are just uh...
oh god they're just forming a team of the got their fingers crossed their knees cross you bet
and of course in irine's case that's probably a good idea at all time and uh...
who else well this is exciting motivation station the motivation stations hoping that they're
gonna make it again that they're gonna show up just a little not a lot just a little bit
and of course a woofie radio is really nervous over there at f.i.u they're praying that they
their number is a real big one the u.m. and v.u.n. is a very tense
so anyway this this happens once a month it's kind of like uh... something else like every month
we go through this in this business and of course it's just uh... more pressure than anybody should
have to deal with see those of you pians out there in the audience that have these meany old
meaningless jobs you know people have their subred hot dog stand or whatever you do
and you figure you're not making the big bucks but you don't you don't have to go through this
every month okay okay okay if you have your own subred hot dog stand probably nobody's
even coming by taking down your license plate number so there are a lot of things to be said
for being self-employed okay we've got five stinking lousy calls on that board it's embarrassing
as hell i'd be embarrassed for example of senator in a way came in the studio right now
i would be so depressed as well air six but two of them date aren't lit up
seven five one
wio d i'm really curious to see how many different versions we can get about that story on
channel seven news last one's there he has to read we've had three calls each one of them is as
different and the unique and it was an abc report was uh...
uh...
channel seven
well that guys a little confused you probably didn't have his metamusal yet today
well i shouldn't say metamusal jackal get very upset really you should see all the letters he wrote to
metamusal and i made that joke about leasing metamusal oh jesus
i'll be serious matter and the people's lives are at stake at all
you know this guy's got a sense of humor that is so incredible it's almost uh...
all here's a
and here's boy gerry right behind him i'd look behind if i were you right now i'd be
very cautious
top twenty uh... what music
top twenty ahead son gtr
here we go this is six a.m.
and at night
the june july august trend life what does that give you an idea what this market
is all about life is number one with an eight point six
how the mighty have fallen hot i'm telling you hot's going to slide
because people are going to start realizing that that music their plane is garbage
yeah have you listened to it i don't listen to it i don't understand what that
music i can't get it
i went down to an eight one power of five to magic oh my god how the mighty of
all i know i don't i don't i hate to say this but i don't believe this
okay it's bad sampling again because
listening habits don't change that dramatic one month the station doesn't go
from nine to like hot to an eight one especially in the summer when all the
kids are out of school unless the sampling yeah is screwed up of course if we do
real well in this i like it uh...
but anyway so hot was second with an eight one power had a five to that's
up slightly so they're closing that gap that's there what i bet you will hear from
built-in today
cubie no-speak at english they had a four nine i would be a four eight so we
were number five
uh... overall of the english speaking station well of course number one a
m by far english
uh... cm qf m another a no-speak at english had a four five magic went down
from a five three to a four two
bad sampling well i killed johnson's gonna be
now i like this next page i got because it doesn't have any call letters on it
okay
well you don't need that do you think it's a great copy it has no call it
or is jade's i mean i'll start the printing alright now we had an akubia
fm and i got it's gonna take a moment for me to write these down so you people
listening just uh... whistle dixie or dot uh... and spike wise has come rushing
racing in here
oh it's just uh... sorry well when you can something you when you have something
important then you have a
like i said when you have
uh...
who's up
really where
new rio's that's up
or you've got it there and you're holding it back
oh my god look at that life in midday had a well look at that we passed magic
and uh... i don't understand life had a nine nine
well they do ten sometimes it's embarrassing and i would be we admit that we
had a six eight
now that's still with that awful month of june in there now what's gonna happen
when june disappears of course we do have the alix Bennett factor
in the last month of the summer book now that could be a real blowed
and hot had six and so we had a nice increase there from a six to a six eight
would be hot
uh... yeah they're not in hop three or you know they were third i'm sorry but they
dropped all the way around i told you they would drop it i think they'll continue
for life be this and i think you know right now i don't know if it's
elevator music and nobody pays any attention to it that is a lot of
okay it's thirteen past noon a w i d a bitch adenis colin's is very very excited
about the fact that those life numbers are just way up there dancing on the ceiling
okay and if you're a potential advertiser by the way you spend any money on
background elevator music i just want to caution you because nobody listens to
it and nobody but unless you believe in subliminal advertising i'd save the
money
twelve thirteen and corporate in the north mind me beach
says we have a lot of niles over here and um...
on the thirteenth of this month that's Wednesday isn't it yeah
in north mind me beach from noon to midnight the chameleous house truck will be
there at nineteen ninety nine northeast to hundred sixty fourth street
brother harry summerville a house director of chameleous house will be with us
nine p m to eleven p m it says we're not soliciting cash donations goods only
food clothing toiletries medical supplies linens
so that's coming up Wednesday from nine to eleven p m
and that's at one ninety nine nineteen ninety nine northeast to hundred
sixty fourth street in north mind me beach at the hall over shark and tarpen h st
so if you've got the foodstuffs and medical supplies and linens and so on
govern yourselves accordingly and please help out the chameleous house okay anyway
with the trends are coming in here we uh...
well i'm glad we got that in here early okay we did very very nicely
let's kiss the ground thank the audience for whatever it is we thank them for
it for their well for their stupidity like the guy said before you know that guy
who was watching the ABC report
also this is really shocking it almost does deserving of a jingle
i have a note from Alex Bennett uh-huh shocking
out of san francisco in fact that the letter is so light that it kind of like
the door dear neal just want to say what a pleasure it was to take over in your
absence hope i didn't or rearrange the furniture dirty up the place too much
you're a rare thing in this small thinking business in my amy's very lucky to
have you and have a station that supports your madness
again thanks for the opportunity but not too much i don't want you to blast me
on the year for kissing your ass Alex Bennett isn't that cute i always like
Alex a lot you know he was right i heard that when he was here it was really
almost indescribable anyway it's twelve seventeen at w i o d and um
jeez i can't believe these trends here i tempted to take some calls because
every line is lit so we take a couple of calls while we're waiting for more
i wanted to think about the trends for a second a six eight
this one to now are you going to start going on the air saying we did a six eight
and we did it because calder ripped you for that too you said why
why did we have this and we had that for taking credit
am i taking credit because i happened because you were here it would probably be
an eight eight i see i just said that just to make calder happy because he hates
your guts margate hello i think you're the first one
it's amazing well you know the women are so shocked from that dolphin game yesterday
uh there was a black sunday yeah the next last the Yankees last
yeah a bad day for New Yorkers render lost how about those jets huh
well the only bright spot was the ballast game

and here's nick right behind him we got like a parade of people coming in here today
i could i ask you just one question quickly
and by the way to the arney i did not lose the Craig B. G. O. cards you can be sure they have a
special place in my heart yes ma'am you used to talk about uh southwestern restaurant
in brouillard county uh southwestern food and i've been trying for weeks that we remember the name
of armadillo cafe in davie yes yes we even know
bill wise looks real real oh god he looks suicidal uh oh
gtr must have taken a death you know you would you know my waiting one second day

uh oh where the hell are they uh oh now come on spike
where you must know uh oh they went from a three three to a three in 12 plus three oh
go ahead ma'am i don't want to give these on your spike i'll get he just suicide uh uh uh
that bill wise you know our good buddy bill look at this renear in the morning 5-8 to a 5-7 so he
stayed there just about the same yeah what else you care about this ma'am right no no no no no no no no
i thought you were talking to grab no well i don't want to ignore you and he rude i'm trying to
get you involved in the conversation it's obvious you don't care about these ratings right now magic
in the name of the magic in the morning drop from a five one to a three nine every yeah hot
went from an eight seven to a seven nine you're still number one in the morning though
hmm now wonder about that the kernels army before the kernel bailed out i wonder if the bottom and
go back he had a one seven in the morning that's up from a one five but still pretty desperate
zeta oh my god just when he was catching on he went from a one five to a one eight and they let
him go he was sizzling he was smoking man and just as they were starting to take off like a rocket
they knocked that show off the year you know we had those books um they they they asked us to really
you had diaries um boy god god bless you yes we did uh i don't listen when you're not there
well i'm not going to come in um i um if you're not there to me the
you know what i've slipped that was life had a nine nine uh i hope you had a six eight let's see
our king went up about twenty thousand we did pretty damn good okay so senator in a way before
you take me off the air maybe ought to take a look at the book all right uh that wouldn't
influence him at all yeah he's got that tape from jack and he's got his mind all made up
uh hot 105 six seven down from a seven three uh uh CMQ of four nine QBA of four nine joy
four six to a four seven magic midday from a five six to a four six magic seemed to be uh just
have hit their peak and uh power from a three eight to a four four w snooze look at this woo
uh oh uh oh uh oh look at this this must be the effect of um debbie Ellis they went from a three
one to a three eight woo in midday that debbie i told you big in this business
she is a giant wild and a hundred from a three four to a three six followed by kiss oh i know
what we need to see we need to see the morning numbers for call her we already saw them
renewers about to logistic minute here reneary had a five seven this is twelve plus
oh i've got my fingers and legs crossed for bill are they on here do they make it oh now come on
that would be ridiculous they're not on this sheet well i want um oh it only goes down to a one
one i want uh spike wise to give me the q a m numbers he remember he did that last time
because they didn't make the one one while he didn't expect they jotted with a point four so maybe
if they went up to a point seven or point eight that would be like almost that would be double
oh boy i can't say anything because i don't take it as a rip no matter what i say
don't talk about called her show he hates you like poison already uh midday where were we we
had that big debbie Ellis no she did the increase that dramatically yeah three eight now when did
they make that change and when did they make the challenge oh now i'd like to look oh no he

me steves number oh here it is okay wait a minute i'm holding my breath well three seven to a three
six okay and at night w i d from a three one to a four four so i guess that means fair rolls not
coming huh okay dick if you're listening because he must be listening because he called a little
boy gary just let me an odyssey he changed his mind don't buy a house i need another soda do you
think that Cheryl is listening up there in the she's got that executive stash up there in front of him
looking Marvin he's smiling like i'm not gonna go running and she was soda right and Nick would go
get me a soda but not Marvin Marvin's still thinking about Chicago by the way wonder if jack has

bragging about their big sports you over there and how they're gonna kick ass again sports talk
q a m from a two one to a two two so they went up just a hair you got a two but our a night time

page from a two six all the way up to a three two okay now here's your girlfriend Irene in the
afternoon now on the first page but on the second page from a two four to a three all right so

control i don't i must confess to you i don't find a number maybe there isn't one um is he still on
the air well he's still on the air but it's not on here he didn't make the cut off the cutoff
point is a one two uh Ernie didn't make a one two at night i'll bet Ernie'll never find screws in his
tires i would imagine thank you so much marvin as he wasn't that difficult that's terrific what
was i just saying before marvin so rudely interrupted with that soda uh oh about Ernie you
know he didn't make it i wish spike wise would give me the q a m numbers so that i can have build
callers uh number i hope it went up to like a point eight which would be double just for bill
you know he deserves it does any i'm gonna see we're all afraid to say anything because he's a
subripping okay anything he does deserve it okay listen is that it anyway no we never got
our ernie we never thought at all i just told you he didn't make it it's not on here but that
means he just did not have any rating it means it was under a one two um we need to q a m break out
anyway no morning i want to see if calder had anything in the morning though he can even
pull q a m out of there he did it for me last time it's under twenty-fifth yeah it's didn't
didn't make the cut hefty l didn't either boy kerry's laughing i don't understand why don't laugh at
these people this is their livelihood now okay here's twenty five to fifty four w i d from a
three eight back up to a four two so it looks like that one oh when june disappears we should be in
great shape except for the Alex Bennett factor now i want you to give me your appraisal all
i think didn't you already do it no about Alex Bennett go ahead my appraisal yes
that was it that was excellent too excellent he sounded like can you say that again sir

joey renalds with an animal bottle he sounded like joel renalds something like that he wasn't
that no he's nice but he was you know well i'm going to tell you it's pay it took me a solid week to
get the audience back i guarantee you that my hand to the sky i wouldn't even call
listen how the dodges do and i hate to ask i forget don't it's not worth taking any time from
the show for okay they're they're buried in oblivion poor Tommy he'll be all right
yeah at least you keep in the way don't
well it's obvious you have nothing to contribute today so no no it's been a real pleasure one last
thing you know when we got it out of the way glen's talking about how nice he is at all these uh
when he makes these guests appearance oh he's not i have to tell you he was really rude at toyota
oh god what are you talking i know i already know that let me tell you the story

is he the doorclad he is she the doorclad he had nice is no she's not you turn your back
me oh god
have a great day good day i can't believe he did well i think the truth is finally coming out
about you and your intempered behavior so you behavior so you better govern yourself accordingly
is all i can say Wednesday it's be a good time to start on a whole new turnover a new leaf
you
twelve thirty five at w i can see that he's really moved and uh see there's some people that just don't
get the message some people who refuse to get the message until it's too late you know what i mean
look what happened to uh don agony twenty five till one at w i o d and we'll be right back
six
ten
twelve

your

okay twelve thirty eight at w i o d
is there anybody else you want to know before we proceed with the calls i can't think of it
the audience hates this they don't care about any i mean they not like to know that we did well but they
don't uh this is strictly for people in the business who want close enough to management to
get the information right numbers with decimal points are favorite
numbers with decimal points
Jeff Gonson we want to congratulate one from a one nine to a two one and twelve plus so just
before they blew everybody out over there they were doing their biggest number ever turn the corner
they had just turned the corner and they blew everybody out can you believe that
that's why talk about bad driving skills they just don't know what the hell's going on
w i n z in midday twelve plus one from a one eight to a two one so tim Williams congratulations
you and Dennis can rest easy make no mistake about it they are doing it in both places okay
i can't wait till we get the demographics like twenty five to fifty four and see the great numbers
they had on those two stations and in the afternoon believe it or not but sandy i guess they got
everybody in the right day Dennis really didn't he put people in the right day parts make no
mistake about it because in the afternoon w n w s from a two seven to a three five with sandy
they got them and oh boy and of course don't forget they've also got that channel 10 cymbal
nest that must be a big number that must be a heavyweight number okay so congratulations Dennis
maybe you don't have to drive me out of the market after all you guys are really kicking some
serious ass and life went through the roof so you better call jack and tell them to just
to cover it himself accordingly okay from the car probably be a good place to call from
twenty one till one at w i o d daniel hello hey niel hi i'm one of the people who saw that channel seven
reported all right now your number four so far we've had three distinctly different versions
well uh you know it basically just showed you in the very beginning like they said that
old picture of you and i was eating right all over and stuff but you know what got me about the
whole report is that here they give talk about that guy and how he's been trying to get you off
you don't mean jack do you oh my goodness i mean i won't even you know
uses name but uh they never gave you a chance i mean what happened to fair journalism here
well they don't know anything about that well they didn't speak to disney and of course i
guess that was their idea of giving uh equal time because you know if somebody's going to have
all these allegations towards you you'd think they'd at least talk well they are pretty far away
you know yeah and as far as that senator goes he kind of like in a way to go he's going to look
into all of this uh well let me let me ask you all right let me ask you did he specifically
mention me by name and say if it's i don't think he really used Neil Rogers i think he said
we he's going to listen to them like your tapes and uh oh i see if they're you know if he'd have to
do anything about getting it off here because he thinks the shock radio is getting too far blah blah
right well i'll tell you i know the tapes that were sent there and there was a lot of stuff taking
out of context and a lot of material that we haven't played on here at all times the thing yeah
it was very nicely edited by jack but uh you know that that's not the way they do things in
Washington you know i can't believe that if somebody like that can really really go around
devoting their life to this and absolutely every waking moment of every single day this is the
only life that the man has is just harassing 37 30 37 oh my god no he isn't retired his wife is an
attorney and she works and brings home a paycheck and this is the way he um i just can't believe
that somebody would go that far to you know like what you're saying about life and
space and everything i mean give me a break yeah you know whatever happened to the right to privacy
well maybe he read too many Sherlock Holmes stories something like that you know it may work in your
favor like married with children used to be really you know not very well i always liked it but
the ratings were never that good yeah like this show when a woman made that big think about it the
ratings went up great yeah like this show we never had much in a way of ratings right well and in
about you know really about neo rod are you cereal and then i saw it in the paper i go cheese
somebody who would wear a foul and dale that sounds like my kind of show that's great because i
know that the sunshine magazine over at the sun sent us going to do it they got a woman is going
to do an incredible hatchet job on the show it's coming up real soon so i'm sure that'll probably
increase the queue by 20,000 people at least yeah but you know i love your show and they better not
take it out here because it really is about the only thing to listen to well you can say that again
now Florida okay and you all have a good day okay see you 1242 at w.i.d now we have four different
stories on the channel seven report and it is nice to know that there are that many people watching
channel seven news there's an open line in brown word 524 w.i.d if you'd like to know how your
favorite station did in the trends i'm sure a lot of people in the audience that are just
shaking and quaking out there they stop coming in though did i miss something we got to 25 to 54
and he stopped bringing him in we've only got the uh... hold day the whole week 25 to 54 we don't have
the date parts why do they stop coming in is there some reason for that i want to see those 18 to
34s myself bill wise will be just apapakku you won't get those i don't think we'll get them we have
to go back there and raise uh... what have to do i also didn't get the q a m numbers either
you know what's anything about those
if it'll be taken out of context and the twisted around the west of the round by say you used
to that aren't we you know you know it probably senator in a way i'll get a copy of the
uh... comments my m e b hello hello uh... this is a fifth report on the channel seven
okay well listen we can get up to about twenty we can have twenty separate reports well
as what he said they uh... showed him sitting at his desk he said simply said he seemed to be
quite under term smiling slightly and he said go mind your own business well we don't use any
of those sevens for good words i'll remember that well he's not on the air i've heard him you
say he's a
uh... you've been eating being shown eating there's no ender they showed you two three times momentarily
and uh... you're pretty good there was no indication uh... that you're eating there was no
food you're not showing there's no food is incredible because we've had two different reports on
that
well let's take a poll eating or not eating folks
well you may i don't know what position you take where you sit down and lean over your microphone
if you just that's probably what you want to be doing lately i've been uh... like
jim baker i've been doing the show in the fetal position to curl up under the table
okay now what about senator in a way what the kind of smart-ass stuff that he had to say
well they show it in a way uh... and now uh... somebody said before that he didn't speak that uh... that uh...
they just talked about it
either jane aether reported or he said here's what was said
jane aether yeah jane aether that's the way it's an outspoken
he's not a name a k i e but you pronounce it aether
well i always called her jane aether
well somebody else uh... some of the others did too but it is a great
choose to be on that show green acrease
okay now what did the senator in a way have to do let's get right down to it
he was looking at a paper and from and uh... he said just what he said at the
uh... and i thought they said i'm shocked that's the words you do you know the
original jane aether said he said that i he said it then he said
i will send for the tape
well that but that's a long time ago that's about two months ago see so that's
footage that they took uh... they piece together a thing from uh... weeks apart
see that goes way back in the beginning
well see that wasn't that indicated yeah that's all i have
well that's the way they do it on tv you know they just take a bunch of stuff and
they uh... you know
snited all up and they slap it together and that's it
well he shocked the idea yes well uh... uh... no one is one of the thing i want to say
that's about that report uh... of uh... of uh...
high-chains uh... being performed by the union uh...
football players that they're taunting and so on and so forth
a lot of things are really provoked that there was a story the day before
coming out of uh... uh... a little bit that uh... that
that there was going to be a big upset there was one uh... when uh... uh...
was close to football play and we did the detail about it and that probably
the whole thing and that's the reason for the spawning up the score
uh... in the first five or six minutes of the game it looked like an upset
with about to occur uh... and i think that only had completed one pass
the nine tries yeah and uh... and they and the other team uh... i was
conscious for us it was three that i saw that part i was at the track they had to
well there's a uh... uh... the idea was uh... uh...
so get her to get get a confidence up and so he uh...
uh... when he started running uh... uh... the coach left them in there long enough
so that he he had a firm uh...
a firm grip on things do we say that firm grip on things
right and uh... we don't want to sit center in a way i'll get upset about it
well as a don't lose any sleep over to just a game right
uh... some other time i like to call in and uh...
and uh...
give you the origin of the word
simmiss
well it fits funny you should mention that because the next time channel seven
comes in i'm going to be eating carrots simmiss on the air so it's going to be great
i'll tell you what that is right now
no no next time next time don't don't use all don't use all your good material
in one call sir
have a great day
okay
like about a year from tissue book he could call back in and tell us about simmiss
what is that the stuff you got over there
somebody facts me an article from the wall street journal
about the problems uh... the pat say jack show is having oh yeah
big problem on your mental problem they are like no viewers yes that's exactly
right that's the problem that's a matter of fact so what are they going to put
on there
reels of green acreage
there uh... yeah
it's a matter of fact
didn't she send me the plant
or is that somebody else who sent me the plant
and i called it a acre
and you didn't even correct it you didn't i would have did you really yeah
i don't know what her name is she just says she was okay she does a good job
yes plant died but uh... it's a twelve minutes before what a w i don't know she's
very nice and not and what's your name's very nice too not a lot of talent but
she's very nice what's her name
yeah
anyway let's tell you about
that's what you have
uh...
yeah i don't
you don't know but you're really not committed or you don't want to say anything
very very much about called her
the track no the talk was the the show

oh yeah
jolly galley was a rookie in r&d excellent when it came to brainstorming
but not real strong in the practical application department
i remember one time flying midway airlines to the home office and jolly was
captivated by the low fears by his off the copper
arithmetic the company had saved a bundle by year end
enough to put in a health club build a new r&d wing and
fly everyone to st. croix for the annual meeting
his logic was a little sketchy it somehow he made it all sound possible
last i heard he'd turned his twenty seven's million at age twenty seven
maybe there was something in his logic after all
or maybe he still flies midway midway airlines our spirits a daily part of
business lives happy not only to save you money
but time and effort as well
oh
midway our spirit will lift you
sounds like an alibi to me also to be twelve fifty one at wio d we're still
looking for ernie sochin on this
he didn't make the
what you're looking for they don't have ratings on when you're
now i know not a word
okay let's continue with the calls here we have an open line in dade
county seven five what look at that there it goes boy but you don't get
calls like that on ftl
and even pomegranate look at that fall man air every line is just blazing here
and it's a monday after it is off and lost and the
and the ratings are out and they were great for us and they're still calling
now i think i think it's marvin it must be because everything else is the same
the fact that we got nick out of there well i don't want to put it in those
terms the fact that nick is busy with other duties during these hours
nice diplomatic way of putting it i think the audience has just changed their
whole attitude now that he's not me i'm not the one who's intimidating it was
nick the one who was intimidated that's why there were times a lot of people
were terrified to call right exactly
anyway uh... i want to thank my friends over channel seven for doing that
through we've had five different reports on that story so far each one of them
has been entirely different and uh... do you have any idea what it really was
all about would you like to wander over there to a client no
are you out of your mind i got the exposed length and against what it's with me
what what is my problem i got my brand new vet convertible sitting out there
it's starting itself it's already to go to my house to watch that game
well for your talk about how about you wander over there you have nothing else to
do how do you know that great good idea maybe they got some food over there
okay eight minute in fact if they do bring some back so he's going to check
well we should have beg for some food today you notice nothing came in
no food and it's too late now there's no way that uh... we're not eating now

Atlanta last weekend and i'll tell you i got Andre Dawson's
signature and yeah he had two homeruns at the in a game they lost yeah
yeah eight to five but anyways i was hoping if you guys wanted to finance
uh... me going to any of the games
i'll get his autograph well i'll tell you i don't want to finance anything for
you but i do have some old tickets from the cubs meds games
on that sunday the last day were there we had about six extra tickets and i
didn't want to scalp them because i've knew that jack would probably have some
people are in the street waiting to arrest us
so i have six souvenir tickets from the last cubs meds game that's the one that
the mark race hit the home run mark rate yeah i got all i got his autograph they are
so nice yeah well mark race is so nice there's no question about it
but they're energetic they're young
well that's terrific and that more greg maddox is young and energetic too i
hope he's very energetic this afternoon for about seven and a half but let me tell
i will have to say that they did not look good in Atlanta yeah well no we had to
get that out of our system better to do it then than the way till the last two
weeks you know we had to get that little thing out of our system yes and they did
yeah we had a great time also i wanted to tell you that uh
that you were talking about uh meta musal
not a musal yeah okay very big in this town okay i'll have to stop it
but i will have to tell you last week there was an announcer i think it must have been on a
Saturday on wrd i should say that and um that wasn't smeg green was it well he was announcing
this girl that was going to talk about that was going to take pictures at a fight
and what he came out and said that he he was the girl was going to take pictures at the far
oh that was um and jane tomas that was in the newsroom yeah i have to tell you my daughter
twisted around yeah my daughter enjoyed that that would take quite a camera wouldn't it
yeah and i have to tell you only because you're a cubs fan do i listen to you
well that's great i well i have a salon and i try to keep you on all the time
but sometimes my ladies they get a little upset when you know you talk about the green
flam and all that yeah well tell them to take a little of that menu to change their hold this
position i will listen have a great day and we'll try to see if maddox can do it today
yeah and win the game too okay thank you a lot 1255 at wiod and boy it's really great what are you
reading the newspaper i don't understand them landers leave me alone oh excuse guys are uh yeah
oh you finished oh i was reading about the uh teens having so you're starting this again you
were reading about teens having sex that was all i was just totally into the sandlanders world
who wrote the letter jack somebody in orga boca boca
uh
are you do you believe that all are a little bit disappeared because of your
intemperty and like your attitude right uh quarrel gables hello
hey don't know okay this story on channel seven is in this the uh great journalism that
lost them a affiliation with one the big three networks no no they didn't lose the affiliation
because of the uh journalism they lost it because uh west and because general electric
bought the channel four which owns nbc oh that what it is yeah they didn't lose it because of their
crappy journalism i mean that just happens to be a a constant oh okay and also about the center
there you know every time they go after someone that's of impotence it usually cover up some scandal
yeah and he has been uh seen with uh Jessica Hahn look alike yeah having dinner with Barney frank
good big yeah i wouldn't be surprised so hold your gun okay i'll be there with you see you thank you
everybody 1256 a w i d a lot of tension building on this show today we have an open line in day one
hat now why did these numbers did you remember how frantic they were coming in here and all of
us said we got to the 25 to 54s and we got the whole day the whole week but we don't have the
day parts the 18 to 34s most certainly have not uh cast a shadow on this door we've only got one
hour to go we don't have a lot of time to waste here you're gonna have to go price some of those
yeah during the one o'clock news i'm gonna have to kind of uh you want to start her back there and see
what the hell is the slowdown anyway you're gonna get to see what is going on here you well i guess
spike is uh he was not happy uh not a happy camper when he walked out here the last time boy he
looked at those GTR numbers and his head started spinning around and then it looked like Linda Blair
Bob McKay from QAM is he on where is he he called oh why didn't he speak to us on the
year calder oh well thank god i'm getting this from somewhere calder went from a point four we know
it was a point four right point one now two a point six well that's good in one month he was only
there he's only been there for two months all a cum from a 40 from 4800 to 12,100 well that's almost
triple in no time at all so how do you like that see if he breaks a one over there which he will
and probably the next you know in the summer book there'll be ecstatic that's starting with nothing
that's all i wanted to know well that's great congratulations bill thank thank the lord
praise the lord and past the ammunition okay we've got the big one two hour coming up and in the
meantime we have three open lines to attend to their one and date 751 w i o d one and brownered five
two four w i o d and one and pompeats see i made a very bad mistake i made that comment about how great
the audience had been today that even with a good trend here and with a dolphin loss and with it
being a Monday and they had come just been incredibly involved in the show and enthusiastic and some
of me even had something to say which this show is very very rare and now all of a sudden i have a
feeling they're going to slack off one thing i should have learned a long time ago you never ever
compliment the audience because then they rest on their laurels okay they sit back and they rest
on their laurels okay we do want to remind you that that incredible channel seven news is coming up
later on with the Sally and that whole crew don't we don't we want to give them a little plot since
they've been so kind to me and uh where's that thing with steveshow on it again oh here i keep
trying to hide it because it's so morbid um-hmm Marvin Weinstein is the guest on the cane show
parents of murdered children and then on sports talk Rick Weaver will tell you why the dolphins were
robbed in yesterday's heartbreaking loss to the bills followed by oh bush spring bang who's got
just a few appearances remaining until baseball season ends until the start of the dick feral show
that dick feral he i'm gonna do it seriously he is so good that it defies description in other words
there is nothing i can say to you to make you understand just how talented this man is so
so i even bought it right and we'll come back after Chuck Meyer in the one o'clock news here on
610 wiod
news talk radio 610 wiod presents neo roger to get in touch and talk call 751 wiod in day
524 wiod in broder or 655 and 278 wiod in the phone beaches other areas make all collapse the opinions
expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station now here's neo
rogers on news talk radio 610 wiod it's so run to two hour it's a little loose there but uh
right in the middle of a sentence you wow we don't have time for the show we got so much important
stuff going on inside okay yeah well anyway 18 to 34 now spike wise i got to admit even
though he is among head he just uh he did hand me all of this stuff he was a real gentleman about
it he looked really depressed well look at this 18 to 34 midday now i don't want anybody to get
nervous but wgtr went from an 8 4 to a 7.8 we went from a 6 1 to a 6 7 now 7.8 and 6 7 are not
that far apart am i right a point of part this is 18 to 34 which we're not even some those
people aren't even supposed to listen to a m when we came here it was what point three point three
zero point three or something like that i think it was a point now we've got a 6.7 i will tell
you gloves 94 had a great 18 to 34 midday they went from a 5 1 to a 7 2 that is great
so they jumped right into the free there which is incredible now let's get to these 25 to 54s
because all of you in the audience know that 20 if you're not 25 to 54 in the radio and
television world nobody cares about you okay it's like you're a non person right and in the
morning rnary had the four let me see four one from a four three so about flat
what else do we want to see in the morning now this is the Alice Rantel factor at work it is
shocking collins must be going nuts they went from a 0.7 0.7 in the morning to a 1 in 25 to 54
last 25 in the only ranked 25 in these they're still last but they're at a point one so they're
moving in on w x dj no one the cat 1.0 did a one yeah and the mbm they're closing it on those
those stations here now what happened here in midday 25 to 54 let's take a peek here i promise
i won't bore you with too much more this magic from a 9.5 down to a 7.8 how the money are dropping
well i was a fluke anyway had i od we went from a 6.3 to a 7.4 and 25 to 54 and of course that
why are you snickering a hot car 7.8 to a 7.2 love from a 3.5 to a 4.7 love had a real nice trend
here okay so it's good that we made up with them just in time just in time hey Greg how you
do a bit yeah uh 25 to 54 in the afternoon now let's take a look at mr. Kane from a 3.5 to a
i don't know what but it's all up see now wait a minute let's check out wld here in midday 25
Debbie might have put a real uh rink let's see i and z 0.7 to a 0.9 oh oh Debbie Ellis she had that
bigger number in midday but it wasn't it was old because 25 to 54 they went from a 1.5 to a 1.3
so evidently Debbie has added the geratol and metamusel set to that after the midday
afternoons let's see if sandy has brought her usual sparkling touch with the younger demos yes
she has from a 1.8 to a 1.5 25 to 54 so uh Dennis it isn't just what it appears to be you continue
selling that it's a great combo that life and wld old older and oldest man let's talk about those
nursing homes and those aclf so good remember though oh yes those adult congregate acd s adult
congregate dying facilities it's just shocking isn't it oh i love that Debbie Ellis so they don't
come any bigger than her so the worm is turning ladies and gentlemen we had that depressing
month and a month of june and i guess jack probably thought well they're going to be off the air
anyway you know their audience is just vanishing but
well i like i like the pitch on that don't you it's like somebody goose the singers they're right at the
variant can we say that i don't want to get senator in a way all upset it's 10 minutes past one at
wio didn't now he's got a good sense of humor doesn't he it just that he doesn't show it on the
outside kind of like stern and grim um howard stern and bob grim charlie grim used to manage the
cubs okay 10 past one let's tell you about speaking of the cubs how about don Zimmer loosen that
weight on neutral system you can see it because when a cub pitcher is pitching bed he races out there
now he doesn't have to waddle like he used to he's lost about 25 pounds at least uh our very own
sunny her she he looks tremendous different different different absolutely different
