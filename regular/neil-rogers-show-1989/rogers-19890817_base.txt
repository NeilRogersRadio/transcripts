well it was just
you got to meter

but i got to
to hug her and i got to
oh see the good news is the people that were on hold
got to hear the whole story
without all of it
right
yeah so those eight people right here

yeah
i was on a
i was on a cloud
when this happened
this had been an incredible day
i had had a really good day at the track before
i went to power and i said
oh yeah big day i remember that
yeah i had a really good day with that
which i went to the track
and then this happened
and i go in there to
for some totally other thing
and i get through the line
and i get through the line
and i got to meet vanity
and i got to touch her and talk to her
and you're like
what is this toucher?
what is that mean?
i got to put my hands on her
under arms and her shoulders
and so i was cool
i was cool
i was cool i didn't lose it
i get accused of all of this
trolling and all of this crap
which is a bunch of psychotic garbage
and every time some young twinkie comes in here
or you meet them in a hallway somewhere
you're all over them
like stink on them
well but this was vanity
i mean this was vanity
and it was humble
it doesn't make any difference
whether it's vanity
how about that bathing suit girl
whose boyfriend was standing in a control room
while you were fondling her?
very similar
yeah
i wonder if you guys are going to play this
from our wren
and talk to her
you want to find out?
ha ha ha
what is this?
hmmm
trust me
you want to find out?
what is this?
I can't get any.
Oh, and guess what's starting tomorrow?
Tomorrow's the party.
No, for once, for as little as I know about movies, and I'm always forgetting the names
of movies and the people.
And I just don't have a mind for it, okay?
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, and I predicted this after the first one was out and everybody laughed at me.
I said, there's going to be a sequel to this movie.
And everybody thought I was nuts.
Eddie and the cruisers, part two.
Eddie lives.
Yeah.
Yeah, subtitled.
Eddie lives.
With Michael Paray.
Yes.
Who if he would keep his mouth shut, looks great.
But once he starts talking, he's like, he's like a goofball, isn't he?
If he would just shut up, man, he looks great.
But just don't speak.
And don't sing, because he doesn't really sing in there anyway.
It's that, it's that real ugly slime ball.
I'd say, what's that group that sings all the music in that movie?
Oh, you know who I'm talking about.
Yeah, of course.
Oh, I can't think of his name.
He's a real thin and ugly and, yeah, beaver cleaver is something.
Beaver Brown.
Yeah, beaver Brown.
Beaver Brown.
Bands or trowel.
Beaver.
What is it?
What is it?
You look at that.
Brown, beaver Brown, band.
Yeah, but what's the lead singer?
What is his name?
Oh, he is so mea, man.
Come on.
You can do it.
Isn't there an ad in there?
It's right there.
No, you did.
It's a big ad.
How could you miss it with Michael Paray standing there?
John Cafferty in the paper.
John Cafferty in the beaver Brown band.
That's it.
He is so, I mean, he gives no meaning to the word ugly, okay?
And Michael Paray is lip-syncing all the music in that first movie and you think that he's
singing.
Of course, you know he's not, because he couldn't sing as well as a paper sack probably,
right?
And then you see the video and it's John Cafferty singing and you think, jeez, come on
already.
Cut me a break, as Stan would say.
Wouldn't they?
Yeah.
You remember Stan.
He's down here.
Okay, here's a call from a Coral Gable, hello.
Oh, jeez.
They got Batman fever out there in this audience.
They're probably putting a Batman logo on their driver's license as we speak.
Nobody would do that.
Well, nobody.
Miami, hello.
Are you good?
Okay.
This town needs to get a ball.
Yeah, okay.
And I think you would be a good start.
It sounded like it's a fact that sounded like he was giving himself one with a receiver,
didn't it?
Why?
I'd get it out of there, pal.
You never know what kind of nasty diseases you can get on that receiver.
Palm Beach is gone.
Boy, what happened all of a sudden?
I played like five notes of the beat.
Well, I'm going to play the whole thing then, screw them.
Okay, it's one of my favorite records.
I'm scared.
I'm scared, but we worked at Zeta for a year.
So we learned that it doesn't have to be recognizable to be great.
Okay.
All the obscure cuts all the time with Tom Robinson on Zeta for.
How you doing, Tom?
I don't want to play that.
Okay, 22.
Well, I'm going to take it home and listen to it in the car.
I do like that album.
It's a great, if you like to beat boys, a spirit of America's the name of the album.
It's got all these great dance dance and breakaway and hush-a-bye and little Honda.
And 409.
And of course, one that I would have just died for.
Do you want to go?
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
I should be there right now.
Right, either now?
Lastly, I guess.
I would have been there last week.
What a bunch of crap.
And then of course, our favorite for Boy Gary.
What I'd go for.
Okay.
He is such a jerk.
It's pathetic.
I've had a lot of idiotic conversations with a lot of so-called management people in
his business.
But I go in there yesterday.
Would legitimate beefs and problems that need to be attended to that you think he would
be concerned about?
Oh, I can't do it.
I just can't do anybody.
I can't wait to do it.
Just to go away, leave me alone.
Let me sit here.
It looked like an idiot.
Which is what he does best, man.
He really.
God, he is helpless and hopeless.
And when he brings his clone in from Louisville, man, is that going to be, talk about the blind
leading the blind?
That will be great.
Miami, hello.
It's a sex-stomach lady, homely blind death.
And that invitation you give off to Ruth Eve?
Yeah, okay.
Miami, hello.
Hi.
She's the same one I called before.
Yes.
I'm here.
How are you?
Okay.
I wanted to tell you where the green stuff comes from.
Oh, gee.
Now we're getting into the heavy-girded.
Where it comes from?
Yeah, it's produced by the mucus glands.
Oh, what are the other ones they got up?
That would be a very good thing.
Wouldn't that be a great thing for a rock group, the mucus glands, right up?
Mucocity.
Yeah.
The mucus glands, and they could be like the California raisins.
They could be like these little globs of green mucus with little legs dancing.
Can you see that animated rock group?
Oh, I can see it.
The music glands.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay.
I wonder why we would be discussing ucocity and Steve on the same show.
Well, there are a lot of people between two and six who have that heavy green stuff come
just automatically flowing out of their system.
Mm-hmm.
I have one asked.
When you see him again.
You haven't been hanging out with Henry today, have you?
Because you sound like you and Henry have been having a little party today with grandma
Boone maybe.
No, I've been having a party here alone.
Okay.
Well, yeah, that's obvious.
I'm just listening to you.
Yeah.
Okay.
The next time you see Steve, look real close.
No, I don't want to look real close.
Oh, give it a try.
No thanks.
Not for me.
Okay, bottoms up.
143 at W.I.D.
A little note here from Nick.
This could be something really exciting.
It says, please have Dave Caprita call me.
I don't have Caprita.
I don't know how to get a hold of Caprita.
What?
Caprita is going to call me.
Okay.
Well, isn't this great?
Just call me Mr. Message.
Okay.
I should start charging by the love of that going on.
I have Caprita call his guy.
Okay, I'll keep the thing nailed to my knees.
So in case he calls at the house, I'll have it handy.
Miami.
Hello.
Yep.
Waiting to talk to Neil.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Waiting to talk to Neil.
Okay.
Hello.
Okay.
Neil, how you do?
So you hadn't realized that?
Hey, I'd have kept going right till 2 o'clock.
Hey, let me tell you something.
Yeah.
I can't believe this is like 13 seconds.
Well, he put you right on.
Well, I think we had the number one from the last time up there.
It was probably a mistake.
You want to go back on hold?
No, no, no.
In fact, let me tell you what I call.
I'm the call who called in yesterday about maybe we don't want this to go on the air.
About people off.
What do you mean by that?
Okay.
When I asked about the pack.
Well, I don't want to go through that again.
Okay, 144 at WID.
There's a guy just won't give up.
You know what?
Yeah.
I'm not going to go through all that again.
Port Lauderdale.
Hello.
Yeah, Neil.
About all this flam.
You know what's green and shoots a gun?
Okay.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hi.
Neil.
Yeah.
Did you see your Steve Kane show last night?
No, I don't listen to Steve show.
It's a little bit too racy for me.
Did you hear Steve Kane show last night?
Let me say it again.
No.
It had the publisher of screw magazine on what a douchebag.
Yeah.
Who the publisher or Steve?
No.
How old are you?
12.
12.
Would you probably subscribe to it, right?
Right?
No.
Okay.
Well, listen, have a wonderful life now.
Hold on.
You want to make it to 13?
Well, you call my dog's last, be a douchebag.
Your dog is called Flash.
Get out of here, pal.
Now we got a young purple runner.
Get out.
145 at W.I.D.
Boy, Steve is just, oh man, he is psychotic.
Look at that.
His hair is like all rumpel, like rumpel still skinned.
And he's just going to let his hair down today.
Phil says, let it ride starts tomorrow.
The movie filmed at Haya Leah.
Yeah.
Let it ride.
Yes.
I'll tell Phil, we don't care.
Okay?
No, it's just a joke, Phil.
Is it start to my Richard Dreyfus movie?
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
I know which one that is.
Well, anyway, the big story is Eddie and the Cruises.
What is it called?
Eddie lives.
Eddie and the Cruises 2.
Eddie lives.
Yeah.
And I predicted that.
That's about the only thing I've had right in the last five years.
But as soon as I saw that movie the first time, I said, this begs for a sequel because at the
end there where he looked in the, he was watching the movie screen, you know?
Oh, yeah.
You know, this is the one.
And Capri isn't the so in Capri took a few days.
Yeah, Capri isn't it.
Let it ride.
And Terry Gars and.
Yeah.
And maybe that's why this guy wants to talk to Capri to Mr. Message there.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, 146 at WIOD.
A final reminder that these are the final days and weeks.
I guess I went into the 90s.
Come out.
Does anybody know?
They keep coming out earlier.
Huh?
Real soon.
Earlier every year.
In fact, I'd like to know.
This has nothing to do with Toyota Hollywood.
But I'd like to know when the 90 vets are coming out because I'm going to trade my 88 in
for the new 1990.
Yeah.
Good.
I don't need to trade my super in because my super is like almost brand new.
But anyway, speaking of super, you can get a brand new 89 super with leather interior power
seats.
A spiffy out just an outstanding automobile.
19,800 right now at Toyota of Hollywood and take it from me.
The super gives you the best of both worlds.
It's got a sports car look and a limousine ride.
I mean, it is sensational.
It rides as smooth as glass.
It handles fantastic.
And it looks to do.
I have to tell you a sharp as a rocket.
Okay.
And 89 Corolla Ford or 89 90 and 89 Toyota to sell 6790.
The bottom line is those 90s are going to be out any day and to make room for the 90s,
they have to get rid of all those.
And they got a lot of men over 1500 brand new 89s that are still hanging around on the
lot.
So you're going to get a spectacular deal the best of the year on the 89 Toyota.
So if you're a smart shopper and get in there right away at Toyota of Hollywood number
one in volume, number one in service and number one in customer satisfaction.
Toyota of Hollywood is located on 441 between Taft and Sheridan streets in Hollywood.
But aside from that, Joe, Joe has got mixed Williams on sports talk tonight for all you
cup fans.
And I was just talking to Joe during the break and it made me remember, you know,
not only is Andre Dawson hitting again now, but last night he made a catch in right
field.
It was one of those where, you know, the guy goes back to the fence, leaps up, reaches
with his glove over the top of the fence and takes a home run away from Luis Kenyones.
And it was just incredible.
So Andre, the hawk is back.
OK, don't want to get the meds fans nervous.
And Joe tells me that the pod race scored four runs in the first inning against the meds
today, which is a bad break for the meds fans.
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.
I guess David Cohn must be pitching today.
Huh?
Just it's just a guess.
Should I look in a paper?
Have you done it?
We're not going to throw it up.
Yeah, I got it.
Right?
You must have it.
You're always on top of the things, aren't you?
Oh, yeah, I'm always.
You keep a very close track.
I'm always hoarding the sports.
You know, let it out.
But I know you're keeping very close tabs on those meds.
Let's see.
Let's see.
Oh, Viola.
Oh, my God.
What a bad break to pod race scored four against Viola in the first inning.
What a bad break for those meds, huh?
Geez.
I guess, I'm clear.
We'll have to pitch a good game tonight.
OK, it's 151 at WIOD.
Davey.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
I got a little report from the beach last night.
OK.
We've boarded last night when I was five.
Look at the eclipse grid and see it.
Uh-huh.
Side to drive out to the beach where may you get a better view.
And just see what's going on.
And I guess it wasn't anyone who had that idea.
Boy, it was kind of crowded.
Families were there and couples were there.
Do you mean they weren't arresting them?
Wait a minute.
Oh.
People were in beach from the Frisbee.
Hey, this is great.
I guess somebody called for our go-kouncils.
And today we can't have that.
We don't want any fun out there on the beach.
OK, let's cut that crap on.
Cars and a little meter maze with the lights going.
You know, because you can't park at the beach at the time of the front.
Don't people move the cars?
Give them not tickets?
It was unbelievable.
Great.
Absolutely unbelievable.
Well, listen, you know, we're going to have to make room for the walkers
and the wheelchairs out there.
We don't have room for all this other stuff.
We have to make, you know, clear it out.
I just can't believe that the people who live in Fort Rutter do
should have some control over the cow.
They don't care.
No, they don't care.
See, you have basically, you've got all these little segmented groups.
The only people that make any noise are the old farts, you know,
with the condos and a lot of money and they still have the first dime they ever made.
And they're the ones that make all the noise and manipulate the politicians.
And the rest of the people are oblivious.
They don't give a crap about anything and they don't vote and they don't get involved.
They don't care.
So like, basically, you've got this one group of old farts that are running the whole town.
You know, it's basically like the whole area down here.
It's free for Miami North.
That's correct.
It's like a disease that's spreading up the East Coast.
It started on South Beach and before you know it,
it'll be all the way to Punta Gorda.
Okay, just had that little bit of a good trick.
Okay, have a good life.
Punta Gorda is not even on this coast, it's on the west coast.
Well, listen, it kind of like spread across.
Right across the Everglades and right through Lake Lucerne and the Mickey Mouse World Man.
Look out.
Pretty soon Mickey's going to be walking around with a beard and a cane.
Wouldn't that be something?
Hey, listen, I just got it.
The hell with Walt Disney, okay?
We can have geriatric Disney Land here.
Can't you see it?
And instead of like ice cream and sodas, they can sell prune juice at the concession stands
and metamusel and polydent.
And they can have like geriatric cartoon characters.
Like Donald Duck can have a beard down to his tail feather and he can be walking around with a walker.
And it wouldn't have to be great.
Watson Island.
Yeah.
And instead of these big dangerous roller coasters and space,
they can have like little buses that say win more village on the side and go over a couple of speed bumps.
Oh my god, this could be fantastic and they could pick all the old farts up at the condo
and as they come onto the bus, they can give them like hand them a little soft pack.
We ought to talk to Jeff about this, okay?
But instead of a sandwich inside, there could be a little container of polydent with a glass.
Huh?
And some metamusel and maybe some fiber one.
We ought to talk to a dentist Collins and see if they can't run a big promotion on this.
Matt, it could bring them back to life.
Coral Springs, hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Is this Neil?
I think so.
Oh, good.
Are you ready for geriatric, geriatric Disney World, sir?
A little over my age group.
Yeah, we're even the old people can't have fun.
That would be perfect for this time.
And you're in Coral Springs, which is the epitome of not having fun, right?
I don't like that.
Even caught, in fact, this call could be illegal in Coral Springs.
Just might be.
You were talking about who should be on with the bird when he's got to do the show without you.
Yeah, and I'd like to make a sympathy vote for Eric Estrada.
He needs the work.
Eric Estrada.
Chips.
Oh, man.
From chips.
Yeah, it's the weirdest, huh?
He needs the work, yeah.
I'm sure he does, boy.
Did you ever, you didn't hear about the book that his ex-wife wrote about him, did you?
No.
Good.
But the way they married for about 10 minutes, he said it was a marriage of convenience or something
like that.
Oh, it was pretty nasty stuff.
Now, we don't want Eric Estrada on the show.
Why, you like some kind of an Eric Estrada freak?
No, it's just a little sympathy vote.
Now, come on.
You can admit it to us.
You sit up there with like a blow-up doll of Eric Estrada and kind of like on your lap.
Huh?
No.
Pictures on a wall, maybe?
No.
I just watched chips the case, boy.
He just watched chips like over and over again, right?
Okay, well, Steve has got a guy on next week who maybe can help you, okay?
Have a great day.
You do.
Okay, boy.
I think we got a real problem developing there in oral springs.
We better get Batman on the case for that one, okay?
Ships.
Yeah.
Batman better write a letter to that young man and tell him he's on the road to hell in a hand basket.
Boy, even I couldn't handle that Eric Estrada.
No kidding.
Anyway, let's go to a beautiful Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey, guys.
How you doing?
I didn't think I was going to get on.
Well, we wanted to make sure that you got on before we ran out of here.
I think you will.
I've got a WPBR aspiring for it.
Now we're talking heavy duty.
You haven't talked about it, but you may not know about it.
Have you heard about our latest weekend talk show host?
No.
Jim Skyler.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, listen to that amazing boy.
He talked about desperate and needing work.
Five to seven on Sunday.
Really?
Yeah.
PM, I assume.
You know what he does?
No.
Basically what you do.
Oh, he's doing his ripping off this show.
Yeah.
Well, that's okay.
He did a lot of clever reading stuff so he can probably play it himself, you know?
I heard him.
I think it was his second show.
And he does a little intro.
And then he says, let's go to the phone.
Yeah.
Go, Cara.
First caller is Lee from Boca.
Hello, Lee.
Absolutely.
No.
Are you serious?
I didn't want to get that one.
That's good.
Well, this is a great report.
I'm sure glad you got on before the end of the show.
I think that might identify somebody.
Might open up some ears and eyes for this.
I just want to know what you guys know about.
