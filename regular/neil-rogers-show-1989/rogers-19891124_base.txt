I'd like to hold for Donnie.
Yeah, I bet.
Told you to hold this.
Interesting hour.
Whoops, Miami.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
My name is Laurie, and I like to know, can I please hold on for Donnie please?
Of course, Laurie.
Oh, thank you.
I have been calling you since.
Now, don't start hyperventilating on me, okay?
I'm trying not to.
Hmm.
But I've been holding on.
I've been waiting to talk to him.
You're just foaming at the mouth, right?
No, actually, I'm just saying I'm going to press out in tears in a minute.
Oh, no, don't get emotional, okay?
Let's try not to make fools out of ourselves, all right?
Oh, I'll try not to.
Okay, Laurie, hold on.
Okay, thank you.
Wow.
The emotional level in here is rising to a fever pitch, okay?
She's a mess.
She is a wreck.
I don't know who's more excited.
Her or Johnny Dark at the prospect of pizza love showing up.
Hey, came in here during the day.
Where's the child?
Where's the child?
Oh, boy, he is incredible, isn't he?
I didn't want to get into it.
Oh, I don't.
Plantation.
Good one.
1217 at WIOD doing a good job of screening.
He's called Ladies Only, okay?
Ladies, ladies.
Do we have to draw you a diagram, Nick?
Too many of those shows with Reverend Polar, so I think it's worth to do it.
Now, he doesn't know a lady from his armpit.
God, maybe George will have to answer the phones.
He's got this straightened out.
That's embarrassing, isn't it?
1217 at WIOD.
7519463 and date.
524WID in Broward.
See, they're all flashing, but he's going through this traumatic.
Are you a lady?
Yes, I am.
Well, you are.
Thank God.
Did you hear that last one?
Yeah, that was no lady.
Yeah.
Now, are you waiting for Donnie Osmond?
Yes, I am, but I like talking to you too.
Oh, okay.
Today?
Oh, you mean another time?
Well, any time.
Okay.
Hold on.
Okay.
She didn't want to talk to me.
You don't have to lie and make us feel better.
You don't have to do that.
We'll survive.
Hello.
Hi, how are you?
Great.
Are you really going to have Osmond on?
What do you think?
Well, I don't know.
I just turned you on my boyfriend's home from work today.
And we listen to you every day.
Now, why did you call me?
I was going to call him Osmond.
Donnie Osmond.
Yeah.
You don't have to be embarrassed to say that.
I mean, I know it sounds a little prepubescent and everything, but you can say that.
I know.
And you want to talk to him?
Yeah, I'd love to.
Hold on.
I think.
A little nervous about that.
When you know what I'm saying, yes.
A little nervous.
She thinks we're having, what's the name from C-B-S?
Oh, Charles Osgood.
Charles Osgood.
No, she does.
She really does.
She don't have Donnie Osmond from Flipper.
And Luke Alpin, by the way, might be stopping by, OK?
Anyway, George is here to take pictures.
Channel 7 is coming by.
Johnny Dark is here to eat pizza lot to probably be here any minute.
Just really something.
It's not like what usually happens on the show, is it?
Mm-hmm.
Or they just ignore the cramp out of us.
OK, Broward Air.
Boka, he's at the door, ladies and gentlemen.
He's at the door.
There goes Nick.
Nick is on his way to get him.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, boy.
W-I-O-D.
Hi.
You know, Roger's there?
Yes, do you want to speak to Donnie Osmond?
Yes, I would.
You know we'd want to speak to Neil, do you?
No, I don't blame you.
Hold on.
Hold on.
W-I-O-D.
Hello.
Goodbye.
OK, so we got the Dayton Broward lines all set up there,
and all those ladies out there.
Now, the one on two, I'm not the one with Charles Osgood.
Yeah.
Just, uh, yeah.
You want to check her again?
You're still there, right?
Hi.
Hold on.
Now, panic now.
Palm Beach.
OK, good one.
Lee Fowler wanted to talk to him.
Great, but his spot just ran out, and he couldn't hold on any longer.
Sorry about that, Lee.
You'll have to make do with the guy.
What's that?
He had a great show today, boy.
I didn't see it.
Forget what it was.
Oh, it was incredible.
Let me look at that.
Something about how to make your flowers grow.
Did you have a pretty hand?
No, I think he had Steve Pitsakano or whatever that guy's name was.
I think I was talking about yesterday.
Yeah.
That was growing those funny flowers in his backyard or something.
Boka.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, you keep hanging up on me.
I know.
Too bang.
Palm Beach.
Mike Miller, please.
OK, hold on.
OK, 20 extra milk.
Wow, we're getting somewhere.
At WIOD.
Let's begin the break, because I see the whole entourage is coming in here.
This is pretty exciting.
Look at this.
There are just thousands.
Thousands of people flocking in here, but we haven't had this much excitement since Mike Disney came in.
Right?
I think that was the last day.
It was shocking.
Johnny is there.
Nick is really a family doing a little bit of work now.
This is so exciting.
I could just pass out on the floor.
And there he is, ladies and gentlemen, the star of stage and screen.
How you knew?
I think so.
Last time I checked.
Great, Johnny.
It's wonderful to see you.
I've got a lot of desperate drooling ladies on the phone waiting.
The bird.
You can tell why I can't you.
For the bird.
Johnny's in there.
Johnny's in there.
Johnny's, he just hangs around.
He just hangs out and eats.
All right.
You can relate to that.
Look at that shirt that he's wearing.
Is that incredible or what?
Isn't incredible.
I don't know.
It looks haloshes.
Anyway, haloshes a little joke.
Seeing he's got a little bit more.
The time he leaves, halosh, I'm going to be Jewish.
Did you have eye-cows were Jewish?
Yes.
It's one of the best kept secrets in America.
And these people from Channel 7 who are on work release, by the way, they only work on haloshes a week into when they let them out.
It's incredible.
Hey, I want to say one thing.
I'm listening to you.
You're not going to whisper in my ear.
And I was going to whisper in my ear.
I'm not going to whisper in my ear.
I'm just trying to do something else in your ear.
Really?
What is that?
One thing you said on the ear, you said, ladies only.
Why are you avoiding questions from the men?
Oh, you never heard of it.
Hey, we're talking to anybody you want to talk to.
I don't care if you were in for a lot of grief.
Doesn't buy me.
Why do you want to talk to the guys?
Anything they want to talk about.
Really?
Sure.
Is Marie's real name, Olive?
It is.
Say, we got that out of the way immediately.
Some fake are called in yesterday.
He said her name was Olive.
I probably said meat now for announcing that.
No.
Well, you and she aren't too tight anymore anyway, right?
No, despite what everybody thinks we are.
We may get along great.
We do, right?
But the only problem is we don't see each other that much.
Yeah.
She's so busy doing her thing.
And that's only by accident.
What?
That you work on the East Coast when she's on a West and vice-person.
No.
As a matter of fact, this tour is taking these two love the same venues.
Really?
Yeah.
And are you like hanging out together?
No.
It's the last time.
I like his refreshing honesty.
You know, that's the amazing.
Even when it hurts, it's incredible.
Can I do a little break?
No.
I mean, it's your show.
We got all these ladies.
Well, you don't want to talk to a bunch of dumb guys.
What are you saying guys are dumb?
Well, on this show they are.
Yeah, trust him.
No.
I want to prove that very wrong, guys.
You call and...
Okay.
Anybody who wants to call and make an ass out of yourself is...
Okay.
Okay.
23 afternoon Donny Osmond's in the building.
Look at this, Ollie.
They don't come in.
Now, I want to tell you, you saw Channel 7 is right next door over here.
Yes.
They never come in here.
We could be arrested for murder or a show.
We could do anything in the world.
They wouldn't come over here.
It's too far.
It's too far.
We'd be on a front page of the herald.
They didn't do it far for Channel 7.
But Donny Osmond comes in and air here snapping and shooting and smiling and pukeing and
licking.
I'm just embarrassed.
Anyway, come in.
What a surprise.
And look at that.
She's got an album.
She looks really desperate today.
Okay.
Laura, come right on in here.
Laura wants to give you a big hug and a kiss.
You don't mind that, too.
His wife's not to praise you about it.
That's okay.
By the way, notice how big that wedding ring is that he's wearing.
It's like a message.
Now, I'm talking about the ring.
Anyway, here's...
Here's...
Oh, here's...
Yeah, you're right.
Did you hear what he just said?
Hi, Laura.
She said she doesn't care.
Look at her.
I was...
It's all made up to her.
You look just like Tammy Fade today.
I think that's bad.
Well, close.
The mascara's running down her pupick.
It's incredible.
Down her way?
Down her thing.
Now, what are you going to sign her album?
This is great.
Forget the call.
I've got a few people on it.
But this is like history and a making.
Laura, you're right.
Laura, you're right.
Okay.
Historical and he's got the pen and he just...
Look at what he did with it.
It's incredible.
Look at her.
She...
Now, don't say when you were...
See, that's what he's trying to break away from.
He wants to be...
No, he doesn't.
I want to get that up.
He wants to be a 15 years old again.
No.
Yes.
Despite what a lot of people think,
I am not embarrassed about my past.
I have to admit, though, I...
It's a funny way that he put it, isn't it?
Yeah.
But I have to...
I have to admit that there wasn't a period of my...
In my life that I just...
Just regarded everything I did.
Because it was the very thing that was bringing me down on the gutter with my career.
You know, the denny ass and the goody-touchy things, you know.
But that's what she loves.
That's why I don't deny it anymore.
Because it was a big part of a lot of people's lives.
It got me to this point where I am now.
Although she said she would leave with you today at the end of the show.
We'll talk about that.
She'll make her sacrifice.
You got one?
Scott is with you?
Oh, her boyfriend's here supervising.
Okay.
Boy is he ever.
But you dump him in two seconds, right?
Yeah.
Don't put her in that position.
She said, get lost, Scott.
She doesn't need a ride home.
Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Interrogate.
No, but I don't want to make fun of the past anymore.
I don't want to deny it.
I don't want to put it down.
Because, hey, there were some good songs in the 70s.
For the time, I mean, they certainly wouldn't hold up now.
But I'm sure a lot of people would do it tonight.
That, for instance.
Yeah.
See, we got it all here.
We're already four.
On Dick Clark has a list of the best summer songs ever written.
And I think that's number 16 on his charts.
Did he say that to us when he called that day?
Somebody noticed?
He was pushing the hell out of that record.
Well, I get royalties on all that old stuff.
Okay.
We know how you guys work.
You're not playing again.
We get a full-course payback.
We can't play it.
You know, it's BMI and ask after it.
We're not asking in on it.
You bet you.
But, you know, somebody called a little while ago.
What is that?
Oh, it's Jays.
I get so panicky when those beepers go off.
Listen to that.
Tea, please.
Must be Joey Reynolds.
Anyway, somebody made an interesting point about it.
Who is this ugly Joey Reynolds guy?
Oh, geez.
He ugly?
I don't know him.
But everybody's calling him.
You don't know him?
You don't know Joey Reynolds?
I don't mind.
He's got a midday job.
Well, it's pretty weak.
He used to be the monster.
Like, when I was a kid growing up about 80 years ago in Buffalo,
he was on a radio.
He was a giant in the industry.
Maybe I know his face, but I know.
And I know.
You don't want to know his face, okay?
But anyway, somebody made the point that Michael Jackson started out like his little
Pipsqueak in the Jackson Five and all those pre-pubescent records.
And his career has gone steadily, although you haven't had any plastic surgery,
which may be part of it.
But it's gone along without any interruption.
And he's got, I don't know.
Does he have the same following or a different following?
No.
Michael took a different route.
Who's to say what happened?
I mean, I don't really know.
I think television had a lot to do with it.
But as big as it was for Donnie Osmond, and Rodonium Ries, I should say,
it kills a record career.
And there's something about television that is almost very plastic.
And it's fake.
He did see Joey show.
You see that?
Particularly variety, you know.
Okay.
Variety, it worked for the time.
Well, there is no more for us.
It doesn't work nowadays because it is very plastic.
And people are not so naive anymore.
And they know what goes on behind the scenes, what goes on behind the camera.
And you can't fake them out anymore.
So it's not so goody, goody, and everything is so perfect.
Because we're not living in a perfect world.
You know, nobody's that goody, goody.
And that's a lot.
Well, even when you were doing those shows, you weren't that goody, goody.
Yeah, exactly.
Right?
The show had a certain format that had to stay that way.
Because we were getting the ratings, and we were locked into a format, Neil,
that gave us that very good clean cut wholesome image.
Now, mind you, I wasn't in the drugs or that whole type of scene.
So if you want to call that goody, goody, then I'm goody, goody, goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody, I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I'm a goody, I'm a goody.
I don't know, but Donnie, I was going to seem to have this boy in a bubble.
A type of image for so long that he could do no wrong.
He's so perfect and going to give boy next door.
Well, have you got any video cassettes like Rob Lone?
Now, that could do a lot.
No.
I'm not proud of the fact that I don't have any Rob Lone cassettes.
I don't think he helps them, yeah.
I don't know.
I'm going to disagree with you on that one.
You think you could do.
You bet you.
And that's a sad scenario on society nowadays is because,
we'll look at Vanessa Williams.
Okay, there's another good example.
How controversy helps.
It's a matter of fact, Patrick Leonard.
I believe that's his name.
He produced Madonna's material.
He came up with a quote, got back to me through a friend of mine.
My music director is a matter of fact.
He said, controversy sales.
If you can be controversial nowadays, people will buy your material.
You'll get press.
And the more press you get, the more popular you'll be.
I don't think about that on this show, maybe.
Well, it's true.
When you think about it, the more controversial you can be.
That's why these guys call up and they say what they say.
Because it causes talk.
It causes excitement.
What guys?
Well, you know, like a couple of the phone calls ago that you got.
Oh, you mean the ones calling here today?
Yeah.
Oh, we get that every day.
They just, they just have a little problem.
Yeah.
That's true.
A little problem.
Very little problem.
No, I don't think so.
But we'll find out.
Okay, 1234 at WIOD.
When we get back, because, now I don't know how long you're going to stay.
I'll stay when I'm done until I'm done, I should say.
And then like, oh, and pizza lofts here.
So food is, we got pizza.
Yeah, we got anything you want.
I want to say, I mean, Laura's going to feed you.
If you're going to hand feed you, okay, it's going to be just obscene.
Look at this.
And you notice now, Jeff usually comes in alone.
But today he's got a lot of land.
Isn't that incredible?
Yeah, he's got, how you doing?
Calculate some pizza loft, bring it in.
What's in that box?
What's in that box?
T-shirts and all kinds of hazeriah.
Look at that.
Isn't that incredible?
And he must have heard that at every parent's, right?
Great.
Okay, so you're going to dish the food out.
I'll do a little break here while you're getting the food ready.
So now we figure that a way to make him stay.
If you're looking for a great night of entertainment for your family,
call 38 at WIOD.
Okay, are we done?
The TV people don't see TV people.
Once they're doing stuff, the radio people are like,
P.O.
Okay, they're just in radio.
You know, we're in the TV folks.
Anyway, Donnie is stuff-
Eating it is excellent.
Pizza loft is brought all the great stuff.
And we do eat on the air, okay, which is bad radio.
But we don't really give it to him, right?
What is that?
Are you giving him a GTR T-shirt?
Great.
All right.
Great.
My thing, you'll be able to be dressed for a long time when you leave here,
man, you're leaving with all the good T-shirts from Pizza loft and GTR,
little pizza there.
What is that, Calzone?
Calzone?
Geez, just incredible.
It's the works.
Okay, so how's he up and doing?
It's doing great.
We're almost gold.
Great.
We're hoping that by time Christmas rolls around or the New Year rolls around.
Well, we're going to put you right over the edge.
The whole three day.
The whole three day.
And if people appreciate it.
If our people next door, GTR had any brains, they'd be playing it too.
But their numbers are dropping like a rock, and that's part of the reason, you know.
That's true.
I'm sure they appreciate you saying that.
Well, no, listen, this is the honest show.
Okay, it hurts.
And they're Scott and they're laughing.
He knows it's true.
He knows they're searching for an audience desperately.
But once they start playing a good stuff,
they didn't even play the Roy Orbison record, right?
Which was number one AOR record in the country.
We were playing and we don't even play music on this show.
It seems as though people are very careful as to what they do.
Yeah, I mean, a lot of people are sheep in the business.
They always try to follow the trends and see what's going on rather than sticking their necks out and saying,
I like this.
Let's go for this.
And using their ears instead of statistics.
Yeah.
Well, they're using some part of their body over there.
I don't think it's their ears.
But anyway, I want to get a lot of these calls on.
And I want you to think that it's just we want all these young ladies to call it and gush over you.
But this is like for them, it's their whole life.
You do understand that.
It's like, he's like, I'm serious.
I don't know what you're laughing about.
It's true like they're just foaming at them.
I like her. Look at her.
She's really usually looks very nice.
Today she looks, she's got enough makeup on to it.
Seriously, I don't understand you.
Give her a break.
No, she is.
She's attractive.
She's wonderful.
She's bubbly.
But today she looks like Alice ghostly.
She's got enough because you want to impress him.
Isn't that true?
She looks nice to me.
Well, there you go.
So she did impress you.
No, but you see what I mean?
You came in like him.
He doesn't, he's got that crappy shirt on.
He doesn't come here to impress you.
He does.
He said it straight.
Yeah.
It looks like he got that a came art.
Okay.
You saw Rainman.
This was a very expensive shirt.
Rainman.
You sure it's my new deal.
And you saw, you heard what Raymond said.
He said, came art sucks.
Okay.
Well, that's right.
Now, he goes and buys it.
Like probably he wasn't.
This is not a came art shirt.
Oh, it's not a came art shirt.
Where did you get it?
It's called.
Don't tell me absurd.
No, is it?
Get it a target.
Yeah.
No, I can't imagine.
He was shot with 10 pages.
At the mall in Detroit, where are Detroit?
Southland.
Westland.
No, it was Eastland.
No, I can't imagine.
Okay, it started with an L.
You were just in Detroit?
Yeah, last night.
Because I was in this one.
I went to Michigan for 12 years.
Not that you care about that.
I went to a Lions game.
Yes, really?
Did you rent the game yesterday?
The ones with the Browns?
Great game.
13 to 10.
You believe that in a section at the very end?
I thought it was a good idea.
I thought he scored on it playing.
We were dead.
He did.
He did.
He didn't count.
Oh, it didn't count?
No.
Because it was already 13 to 10 and that was the final score.
What do they call it back?
Does anybody know?
They didn't count the touchdowns.
Look at the looks I'm getting like.
We don't know.
We don't know nothing about football.
That must be your crowd.
Well, you have the phone calls.
Oh, well.
That was a good idea.
Sorry.
The way the Lions won, which is very rare, by the way.
Okay, who's that on the bat line?
Is that another inside call?
Or is he doing another deal with Joey?
I think you've had a lady holding for an hour and 15 minutes.
Okay, let's get her right on.
Okay, are you anxious to speak to her?
Well, for a lady's been holding an hour.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, this is your big chance.
Okay.
Who is this?
This is Denise.
Hi, Denise.
How you doing?
A fine thing.
How are you?
Great.
Where are you going from?
I'm calling from North Miami.
North Miami.
You've been holding for how long?
I guess about an hour and 15 minutes, an hour and 20 minutes.
Showing you, Neil.
Denise, is it?
Yes, please.
What have you been holding?
And Sister Joke, Denise.
Don't answer the question.
I've been with the Anavir now for about 15, 16 years though.
And this is the first time I get to talk to you.
I think I'll pull up your concerts, but I've never been fortunate enough to meet you though.
Well, it's nice to talk to you, Lisa, with the phone.
Yeah.
You lived in Florida all your life?
No, I'm originally from New York.
I went to school in California and...
What part of California?
Malibu.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, it was really nice over there.
But anyway, did you have a nice Thanksgiving yesterday?
I did.
As I was telling Neil and Glenn, I went to a Lions game in Detroit and had a little turkey dinner in the whole bit.
It was kind of fun with my wife and my little boy.
What about your other boy?
They're back in Los Angeles.
I flew them out earlier on the tour separately.
And they joined me and watched what I do.
Is that your little boy in there?
Yeah, I say your little boy?
Are you serious?
He looks just like Jimmy.
Really?
How old is he, Donnie?
Four.
Four?
Yeah.
Doesn't he look a little like Jimmy?
Little.
Yeah, he does.
Not Jimmy Osman, Jimmy Carter.
He's eating pizza.
Wouldn't that be something his son will grow up to be president someday?
Then he won't have to worry about all this crap.
He's like, go ahead, Donnie.
I'm sorry.
I'm taking up your time with all this bad material.
That's okay.
How old are your boys now?
Well, I tell you.
I'm not going to talk about that too much because that's my private life.
And I try to keep that as private as possible.
So, they're just normal kids.
In other words, in his normal life.
In his business, Denise.
That's okay.
I like he's paying no attention to this.
He's just eating pizza.
I like that.
You bet.
Normal lifestyle.
Let me ask you about your tour.
Then, how much longer do you have with your tour?
About another month, three weeks or so, something like that.
We end up in Los Angeles.
We're going to hit New York here next week and then work our way west until we hit Los Angeles.
And that's the last show.
Are you planning another album soon?
Well, I'm going to jump into that in January.
I don't know exactly when I want to release it because I'm going to take my time.
See, I'm in a critical position in my career right now because this next album, if it's anywhere near a very poppy, formulated album, my career is over.
Because I've gotten the attention of the industry now with this album.
It was an interesting story to be told with what everybody's referring to as a comeback.
I'd like to refer to it as a resurgence more.
But I'm going to make sure that the quality of this next album is good, straight rock and roll.
Real strong material.
I'm not going to tour a lot next year.
I'm going to just stay in the studio and really work hard on the album because I think too many bands make the mistake of touring too much.
And then the second album is doing, they'll say, well, let's go in the studio and hurry and rush this album out.
And it suffers.
So I'm going to take my time with it.
Are you planning to write any of the material for the next album?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah.
Great.
In fact, I've started.
Okay.
Yeah.
What about TV?
Do you plan to do any of that?
Nope.
No, not again.
No, I'm not.
I have had my go with television.
You want to see a television?
Yeah, he hates TV.
All the videos, videos, all the videos, yeah.
Yeah.
Special appearances here and there, but not a series.
Okay.
How about acting?
Do you plan to do any of that as far as, like, maybe movies?
Well, here again, you know, if I'm going to do that, I'm going to make sure that it's good.
I'm going to do it.
