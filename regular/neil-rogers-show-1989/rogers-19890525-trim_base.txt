I'm a cup man. I know bud man. I trust you are too.
Hey, way back. Might be out of here.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. He's giving again.
Oh, my God. Look, David's eyes. Holy cow.
Yeah, what is it? Is it on the tape? I like this. He saves time.
I never noticed that there's two things at once.
Well, it's not as good as that sports actuality that Joe played on the 10 of sports.
Sir. That was really good. I don't get hysterical, Joe. It's just a ball game.
Okay, 1006 at WIOD. It's a Thursday. And I'm curious is today like
um, payday for everybody. Boy, you're low down in your
chair. I told you that. I told you this chip is on the floor. God,
you're so low. Yeah. Well, I'm going to bring me back down to Earth.
The numbers came out. We went up again a little bit. They just try to bring me back to Earth.
I don't know if you're going to get paid today. And I heard some rumblings about it over here.
Because nobody's going to be here tomorrow. Are they?
Of course not. I'm not coming in if we have a whole bunch of people tomorrow.
Now today we got natural eats is bringing food and the course fat
riches here every Thursday. So just by coincidence, he happens to be here.
That's good. I'm curious what this is. Hi, ladies and gentlemen. I'm ready to broadcast.
I love myself.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
It's the kernel.
Isn't it?
Ricky Tiki.
Looking for a pillow.
I wonder he's related to the Boka puke at all.
What happened to the thing we got yesterday that new card?
The thing. Boy, that better be in here. I'm going to be crazy.
Oh, you're trying to find something in here, man. Looking like looking for a haystack in a needle.
The one from Mitch? Yeah.
What's it called? It's called just exactly what it says.
Now that card better be in here and it better be here quick.
Nice reading, by the way, from Mitch. The greatest.
You could tell there was a lot behind it. Oh, boy. Here we go.
Very sincere. Here we go. I haven't even started the show yet.
Oh, here it is. Thank God. Boy, my heart is just bitter-patter.
Is it real? It would.
Sales, people are rassholes.
Okay, it's 10-8-11. What does it goes without saying?
Okay, now we've got a couple of things here. First of all, our horses are still running from yesterday.
Oh, God.
And you know, you can't win them all. We're going through a cold streak now.
Oh, kind of like the Yankees.
Cherokee Ninja in the first race today.
In the first race. Not that it's...
In the first race. In Zalaz, it's 8-5 in the morning line.
Okay. Okay.
So I'm not taking any chances.
That's my pick. I gave you a chance at aristocratic cross today and you passed it up.
I don't want to go with the... You bypassed a lock.
Yeah, that's correct.
And you pick touch and feet in the feature in the ninth race with Jose Rivera.
I like it.
Or is that Jungle Jim Rivera? It's one of the other.
A Jungle Jim.
Yeah, Jungle Jim.
Also, here's a little blurb from the paper, a scuffle with political prisoner.
Roberto Martin Perez has cost Spanish language radio commentator Felipe Rivera, his job.
What?
Another one of Steve's buddies.
Felipe?
What do you want, sir?
Yeah.
I got a horse for you.
Yeah.
Silky Roman in the fifth.
I love Silky Roman.
A horse is 12-1 in the morning line.
These tips, these hot tips.
Okay.
Thank you. Good luck to you.
Good news, be yours.
Silky Roman with a Roberto Castillo.
12-1. Is anybody pick it?
No.
How about that?
The fact that Balmer Vision is Steve is best bet of the day.
We're not picking any more horses out of the sun, Central.
To let get somebody making the graded line, a little who's got some clue what's going on over there.
That's why we get screwed half the time.
We pick out of the sun, Central.
They got horses like four to one and five to one.
And Phil looks in a program.
They're like 800 to one and a half.
That's true. It's true.
Anyway, Roberto, a commentator on radio suave, was fired after advertisers and listeners complained about his run-in with Martin Perez.
Yeah, he's a wonderful guy.
That Philippe Rivera, wasn't it?
It said he also had a talk show from five to seven PM called the firing a flagrant attack on freedom of speech.
Now, he's a great one to be talking about freedom of speech.
Okay.
One of the worst douchebags in the history of this town.
How he's ever been allowed to be on the air beats a hell out of me, but I'm sure Steve will have him on real soon.
Oh, you will.
Oh, guaranteed.
Steve loves him.
Steve loves every douchebag that ever came down to Pike. He's obsessed with.
Steve has open phones today, which is good because I mean, at least we get through one more day without a rabbi.
How is my or Kahanah yesterday?
I can't handle the rabbi.
Was he still hawking a trinic?
I didn't hear what.
I can't handle the rabbi.
Was he hawking a trinic about the Arabs and a Jews again?
I can't do it.
Because I get the feeling when I listen to him that like the Arabs and Jews don't like each other too well.
Don't you get that feeling?
Which is quite a revelation. That's something really brand new.
Anyway, it's 10 minutes past 10 at WIOD.
I mean, we may or may not be getting paid today.
I just mentioned that in passing because if I'm getting paid, then it's going to require at least three or four people to drag the check-ups to it.
But we'll see.
Because I just think tomorrow is going to be skeleton crew.
Yeah.
And then Monday, of course, nobody will be here.
But Mr. Arnold's coming by with those royal castle burgers on Monday.
Amazing.
And Todd will be here on Monday.
So I know you're happy about that.
Anyway, I don't know what your problem is.
Really, I think we need to examine this.
Look at that. Every line on the board is lit.
Problem about what?
Every line on the board is lit. What the hell did we do?
Is there something going on?
Man, the traffic this morning was brutal.
And you know what it was?
It was jammed up on 95.
And then I get to like, Halondale Beach Boulevard.
It's somewhere around there.
And there were a couple of those.
What do they call those orange pickers?
Those big things where the guys are up in the sky and they're doing something with the lines.
And once you get by there, there was no traffic at all.
Now they weren't in the road.
They were like, I'm a side of the road.
But that had traffic.
Just looking, gawking at those idiots had traffic backed up about five miles.
You people out there who think you're a driver, man.
You couldn't drive your finger up your nostril.
Or wherever.
They have no clue how to drive in this town.
The slightest little distraction, man.
And you got about a five mile traffic jam.
Apparently these people's lines are so empty.
They're so little going on in their lives that there's the least little thing happens on the road.
It's enough to make me a Jew.
My son.
Major in their life.
Anyway, 12 minutes.
You got to be kidding me.
Dwight Lauderdale.
Huh.
Okay, well, it's a good thing she didn't name a man Bishop.
Anyway, that's just a little thing in the herald.
It's not worth repeating, but of course Sharon is scouring the papers trying to find something for Steve to talk.
It's 10-15 at W.I.O.D.
Sonny is up in Gainesville, by the way.
So even though you're not going to hear the hurricane game, we'll be getting reports throughout the show.
The game starts 11-30.
And we'll keep on the edge of our seats.
Oh, Rufus, what do you want, Rufus?
Hey, Rufus.
How are you doing, Neil?
No, this is Neil Rufus.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to get a hold of you for three, four days.
What do you want?
Tell you the copies are doing great.
Yeah, I know that already.
I see all the games, Rufus.
Everybody.
How about that Greg Maddick's Rufus?
Yeah, yeah.
He's okay in my book.
You like him.
Yeah, a lot.
Okay.
You good picture, too.
Yeah.
Big weekend up here.
And one major problem.
Big weekend is we're going to have the Cherry Pine Cat Fish Festival Saturday.
Great.
Okay.
Big problem.
You remember I told you, Colt Lisa V. Roy, took that girl out there, revealed to fish fishing?
Yeah.
Well, V. Roy won $1,000 on a scratch off ticket and an artery.
What was he scratching, Rufus?
I don't know, but he had a show bet.
Also, I'm Sonny Sallie.
A show bet, yeah, that's good.
He made somebody.
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
And on the other hand, he took the Isabelle.
That was that woman that came up to build the fish fishing and ran off water.
Yeah.
And now his wife just came home last night.
And we don't know her years, could you please tell him because he listens to you all the
time, tell V. Roy to come to hell, huh?
Yeah, okay.
Come on, Nia.
Whatever you say, Rufus.
Please, Nia.
Whatever you say.
Have a great life.
Okay.
It's 1017 at WIOD.
Boy, I was feeling so good, too, right up until that moment.
Okay, we have an open line and date one in Palm Beach.
I haven't given the numbers out yet, so I don't know what I'm hucking open lines.
Now, what is this problem that you've got that any problem?
Are you sure that's the right one?
Well, I think it's definitely the right word.
It's this hysteria.
Histeria.
Got these news interns that come in here and they don't sit on my lap.
They don't even come over this half of the table.
They don't come on this side of the table.
And yet you have this hysteria, this obsession, this obsession, a hatred.
No.
I deny it.
I have, I don't paranoia.
No.
Insecurity.
Hostility.
I haven't said one word to them of any time.
I have no boys running around the newsroom interns.
I don't even notice.
Wait a minute.
Are they boys?
Kids.
Holiday kids.
She's not a boy.
I'm talking about male interns running around the newsroom.
How about the female interns?
I haven't seen any.
Well, there are two.
I haven't seen them.
I think the newsroom is terribly unbalanced because it's all-
I think you're unbalanced, okay?
About what?
About this subject.
Okay, here's, now he's ripping Dorothy because she has good taste, okay?
I didn't say anything about her.
Is an April and Gail enough for you to squeeze and fondle and molest?
And then Sharon, who comes in here and scratches your back and-
I don't talk about him endlessly.
Does anybody notice that?
What I want to say is-
You know what?
I don't talk about him endlessly.
I'm not upset.
Endlessly?
What I want to say about the male?
What do you mean just now?
Boy, is he getting defensive or what?
Interns in this building.
And then I have no opinion one way or the other.
What does that mean?
You have nothing.
They have not struck me at all.
One way they haven't struck you.
Well, one of them is going to strike you when he comes in today.
Ross will probably beat you over the head if you don't stop.
Stop.
What?
They haven't struck you.
They're just-
I have no opinion.
Well, I do.
One way or the other.
Well, we're not talking about you.
Are we?
Yes, we are.
We talk about you.
I thought you were asking me.
Not at all.
Good.
Because I have no opinion.
It's 1019 at WIOD and he has no opinion, folks.
Sports talk tonight.
Correct.
Goldberg with Kenny No of Calder.
By the way, Calder opens on Monday.
Wonder what happened to my Calder passes?
A 28th at opens.
That's right.
No.
In 29.
29th.
I don't want to nitpick.
But Sunday's the 28th is last day at Hylia.
Okay.
With free admission at Hylia.
So all the-
We out there on Sunday.
And then Calder opens on Monday with a big memorial day card.
I would assume.
Right?
Great.
I like Calder.
I do.
I really like Calder.
I do.
I love going to Calder.
What's funny about that?
I don't know.
It's just the way you said it.
There was just something about it like-
I don't know.
I do.
I do remember that wonderful breakfast we had a Calder with Gary Lawrence.
That wasn't at Calder.
That was at the Holiday Inn Calder.
That wasn't the-
Well, overlooking the track.
But that wasn't being in the track.
Yeah.
That was our ratings breakfast.
Yeah.
Our power breakfast for the rating.
That's what it was.
And boy, that was quite a reward.
It's sitting there at 10 o'clock in the morning.
30 in the morning.
Watching the horses, the remaining horses work out.
And listening to Gary BS.
You know.
It was great.
Well, they're really getting theirs over there.
I'll tell you that.
In fact, there's a big article here.
A minority hiring gets scrutiny at 102 Florida radio stations.
Hmm.
And it says the FCC is investigating the hiring practices
of 102 Florida radio stations as a result of allegations
by black civil rights groups of an adequate minority recruitment.
And it has a list of the South Florida stations
among the 52 in the state, which are in the-
in the list.
That's okay.
You can get choked up.
And among the list are W-I-N-Z-W-N-W-S-N-W-Z-T-A.
Wow.
Fast and interesting.
Gary Lawrence.
Yeah.
Hmm.
21 past 10 at W-I-O-D.
We have an open line in Palm Beach.
Also have a wonderful memo here from Bill Mullin.
And I want to thank him so much.
He signs it all the best.
And I couldn't come up with words to describe my feelings about that.
Sales people at rest.
Ha ha ha ha.
21 after the hour,
a char-hut opens the doors in nine minutes.
And speaking of Bill Mullin, I want to-
I just want to get this straightened out.
And I was going to want any confusion.
The hotdog specials at the char-hut at the-
Now where is it?
County line.
Really?
County line store only.
Okay. Thank you so much.
Well, I'm confused because Mullin is-
Well, you have so many slips of paper.
I got two or three more in here.
After 4 p.m. on weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday
at the County line location only, hotdogs 50 cents till the end of the month.
You got another week to go in there and really pick out.
But again, after 4 p.m. weekdays,
all day on Saturday and Sunday.
And of course, at all seven South Florida char-hut locations,
you'll discover-
there's the only fast food place where they use Kaiser rolls with a poppy seeds.
Or you can get the regular roll if you're some kind of a slumper.
And they grind that chuck fresh every day using only the very finest ground chuck.
They grind their pork butts every day.
You might say they work their butts off every day to bring you that great Italian sausage.
And at 25 at WI would do we got a Mr. Food Spire Report.
Neil.
How you doing, buddy?
Kay, pal?
Listen, I heard you talking about Mr. Food,
so I figured I'd give you a little Spire Report on the guy.
I used to work at a certain country club in Boca.
The guy used to come in and play a little golf in the afternoon
and then the old mob to bar for the freer deres in the afternoon.
I used to watch this guy, you know, he'd come in maybe two or three times a month.
And I figured, you know, Mr. Food, Mr. Connoisseur,
you know, cook this, cook that.
He would never break down and spend a buck in water, something off the mat.
He always had to be there for the freer deres.
And as soon as they were gone, he was gone too.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, okay.
Well, I thought maybe there was more, but that's a good start.
When he looks like Mr. Schmutz, I think, should be his new name.
That's what he looks like, man.
That was a real idiot.
He's got hair growing off the outside of his nostrils, that guy.
That's how bad he looks.
Seriously.
Mr. Apapitya.
How you doing over there, Bird?
Okay.
All right, man.
See ya.
That's about it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Quite a spy report.
Yeah, 1026 at WID.
Well, there was no roofage from wherever that was.
Boy.
I guess Atlanta.
No.
No, he's not a saintly.
Behoek.
Or somewhere up there.
Open line is in Boca, 278 WID.
And of course, Palm Beach, we're saving for the people out of town.
If you're listening like in San Francisco or in Phoenix or in Albuquerque,
line 8 is open and available right now or into Bahamas.
Everybody keeps telling me that everywhere they go into Bahamas,
they've got us on, like in the stories on a radio.
So we want to wish you a real happy ripoff day to all our friends in Bahamas, okay?
Because we know they love ripping off American dollars.
And good luck to you, okay?
As long as they're too stupid in this state to have gambling,
you folks are going to continue doing very well.
Sure.
And we don't hold it against you.
If we were in your shoes, we'd rip off the dumb Americans too, okay?
Hot 105.
This is from the dining and entertainer.
Oh, this is the Thursday paper.
Oh.
This is the Thursday paper.
Oh, don't you remember we got the one last week?
Yeah.
This is the book.
We just got a new trend, but this is the book.
Palm Beach.
Wow.
Dining and entertainment.
The Thursday...
What is the Thursday paper?
What does that mean?
What...
Don't you find that a strange name for a paper?
Yeah.
The Thursday paper, although it does come out on Thursday, so I guess it's okay.
Wow.
The top 40, this is Robin Plitt again.
Again.
Not Robin Platt, the jockey, but Robin Plitt.
The top 40 radio format proved to be a hot commodity in South Florida.
WHQT proved to be the hot property.
The Miami Bay Station, which bills itself as Hot 105,
received a lion's share of listeners.
Look at this.
They've even got a whole list of all the stations here from the book,
which is only a month old.
That's pretty came out today, May 25th.
So they're right on top of things, okay?
Then it has a paragraph where it says,
Power of Speech.
WIOD continues to improve its audience share after requiring controversial tacos
near Rogers last fall.
Rogers, Micronirion, Steve Kane, form a popular lineup that blended
with the station's evening sports programming to generate a 5-1 share.
WSNews placed more than a full point behind with a 3-2 share,
while all news WIOD was a close third with a 3-1, close to what?
Close to WOLD, not close to what?
WJNO, well, they're a 9-minute segment of CBS Radio's The World Tonight.
At 6 p.m., program director John Focano said the move was an experiment that has run its course.
And if you mention any other station in this article, I'm going to retract my hand.
Well, he is such a fishback.
Okay, such a paranoid doucheback.
I will only show up if no other station's invited.
Yeah, right?
Wow.
The big JNO, okay.
Here's a multiple collar on four. Hello.
Hi, how you doing?
Okay.
We're sitting here listening to your show, enjoying it as we always do.
We all love it.
We work for a government agency,
so you're the only sanity that we have during the day.
Government agency, boy, we're being monitored by the government ladies and gentlemen look out.
But, uh, no, you know, we enjoy listening to your show.
Well, that's great.
And, uh, we haven't heard to talk about the video we were treated to the other day,
with Rob Lowe, that we all got to enjoy during our dinner time.
I didn't see it.
You haven't heard us talk about the Rob Lowe thing?
Yeah.
We've talked about it till we were blue in the face.
I mean, too much.
Didn't have, okay.
Okay, we must have been working during that time.
Devonette, well, that's good.
It's glad to know that on government money, you're taking a little bit of the time to do some work.
But, uh, no, we, uh, we enjoy your show.
And, uh, we got a couple of other people here that want to talk to you.
Okay, well, that's great.
Okay, hold on.
You bet.
Great.
Wow.
I think there'll be a surprise.
I hope not.
I hope it.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yeah, we just wanted to say that we think the bird is an excellent addition to your show.
Great.
And we think he does a fantastic job along with you.
And if it wasn't for your show, we'd all be going nuts by this Friday and the day.
Right.
Hmm.
Okay.
All right.
Have a great life, pal.
Hey, you, too.
Okay.
Bye.
Oh, man, that's the government for you right there, ladies and gentlemen.
What a call.
Summed up.
What a call.
Well, that's your crowd.
That's your fan club right there.
I get the chance of that.
I'll give you a big compliment there.
Oh, now we got veggie on the vocal line.
Don't you understand we don't want to talk to you anymore?
Wait, I don't understand.
Oh, no.
1031 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Broward at 524-9463.
You should have let him finish that one word.
What was it?
I don't understand.
Yeah, understand.
524-9463.
We're going to be here at WIOD in Broward in Palm Beach.
Forget it.
Forget it.
I thought we were really going to be smoking today in Palm Beach because we started out and
every line was lit.
We didn't even give the numbers out.
And I thought they had something to say.
And if you noticed, I'm wrong.
Nothing.
And they have nothing to say.
In fact, these are some of the most terminal people.
It almost makes you want to punch up Boko again.
Hello.
Neil.
1031.
I don't give up, bitch.
Welcome back to you every now and then.
Well, he usually does hang up.
That's one of the reasons he pisses me off.
Something fears is we try to get him on in spite of his chronicness.
And he just hangs up.
If you don't get to him right away, it goes off in salt and drops the phone on the floor
or some stupid thing like that, right?
OK.
At least he's starting to get honest.
OK, I like that.
That's a good, fresh approach.
Honesty may save you.
I wouldn't count on it, but it might save you.
It's 1032 at WIOD.
And by the way, Fernando, I'm sure, is driving up right now with a food from Natural
Leads, which is just tremendous.
And it's not that we don't like you, Fernando, but just drop it under the door.
You're a wonderful guy, but don't, please.
Don't come in here for another four hours, smoothing around and just being...
Well, he's got work to do.
He can't stay there.
Exactly.
He's got a lot of stuff to do.
So we understand if you can only leave it at the front desk.
And we remember what you look like, which is one of the reasons we don't want you in here.
1032 at WIOD.
Well, he can't all look like Ross and Todd, in spite of the fact that you hate them.
Don't say that.
And Jared, what do women really want to admit?
You know that Maya Kahana kidnapped Jared yesterday and took him to Israel?
Not.
He saw him wearing that high around his neck.
What do women really want in men?
Not the sensitive carrying Alan Alda types that were invoked in a year back.
And I said, Maya, we got enough goyem here already.
You can't take the Jews out of the building.
Nowadays, gals are looking for handsome, rich guys in the mold of Donald Trump, according
to the latest pull by Man Watcher.
More than one went off at 40 to one at Hylia.
So Steve's listeners was, as usual, were full of it.
So he had to give Hank another 20.
Good.
So it's 120 that he peed away.
You might as well have burned it.
I'm sorry, go ahead.
Today's ambitious women want the superficial things.
Good looks and this success quota, according to Man Watcher's name.
They must have interviewed Laura for this, okay?
Because she's given up all that other stuff.
Now here are their faggers.
That's what it is.
It looks he don't have.
Right.
Exactly.
Here are the top vote getters.
Mel Gibson.
For what?
Man Watcher's Inc.
Oh, come on.
Now will you stop it?
Are we going to go through the same old list again of all these schmutzzy guys?
The probably Patrick Swazies on Epic Swazies on Epic Swazies.
No, no.
Swazies didn't make it.
How about John Cameron Swazies?
No.
John F. Kennedy Jr.
Man.
Lou Gossett Jr.
You know if he wasn't John F. Kennedy Jr. that wasn't his name.
Nobody would pay any attention to him, okay?
Lou Gossett Jr.
Yeah.
Why is that?
Because he was in that movie with Jason Getrich.
Obviously.
And Donald Trump.
Oh, give me a break.
Will you?
Looks money power.
They say.
And Paul Newman.
Also making the list.
A most watched man.
Oh, put on your seatbelt.
Alan Thick.
Oh, God.
Get serious.
Brett Pack actor Andrew McCarthy, who I hung out with in Atlanta years ago.
Yeah, you hung out with him and Rob Lowe.
Tony Danza.
Yeah, it was.
Yeah, it was.
I thought it was.
Tony Curtis.
Yeah.
And Kenny Rogers.
I wasn't at Jamie Lee Curtis's.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, now I'm beginning to put all of that together about her problems, okay?
The fact that you had a paste those on.
And that she seems so butch all the time.
Tony Curtis is her father.
What do you think about that, Veg?
A wonderful.
1035 at WIOD.
And I want to mention, of course, that a lot of evidence.
You know one of the great Italian restaurants anywhere in the world.
It's not just South Florida's finest Italian restaurant.
It's so good.
I don't think you can beat it anywhere.
And they bake everything fresh on the premises.
All their great pastas are all homemade.
That angel hair pasta with whatever you like on it.
You can get it with baby cow or with seafood or with just about anything.
Or you can just get it like with sauce, you know?
And all kinds of great wheel dishes and poultry.
The very finest Italian cuisine.
I do want to mention at La Teverena, it will be closed this Saturday and Sunday
because Chef Romano and his lovely wife Carol will be attending the graduation of their daughter from college.
Well, congratulations.
Of course.
And of course, they're normally closed Mondays and Tuesdays anyway.
So they're going to take like a little busman's holiday for this and it's well deserved.
They'll reopen on Wednesday to serve you with La Teverena.
As a matter of fact, I'm just thinking about it and I think next week, one night,
I'm going to La Teverena for dinner.
I just, yeah, it's been a long time.
That's it has.
And now that I'm just kind of floating and my weight is just hovering about the same.
So for the very finest Italian cuisine, you head for La Teverena.
To be sure make reservations, 722-1831, you'll find them on McNabb Road,
just east of Pine Island, just north of commercial, 8455 West McNabb and Tamarack.
Like La Tavranetta.
Well, like I said, no, I don't think he's a Paheza Puts.
Because I, you know, I said something to him about this the other day again and they won't play it on GTR.
Okay.
Now, they wouldn't play the Roy Orbison record, which was number one AOR, not just number one like Billboard,
but number one AOR, an album rock in the country.
They wouldn't play it on GTR.
They won't play the Dion, which even YNF in Tampa is playing.
See, that's the problem with this market. There is no real AOR station.
What you've got are stations, you've got three stations pertaining to BOR that don't want to be.
In other words, they want to be safe.
All right, Miami Stable.
I say it at which plays all the same six groups that Rose Folger likes over and over and over again,
the stones and the Beatles, you know.
And for example, like Billy Joel, I hate Billy Joel.
I know I've told a story before, but I said to Rose when we were over there,
I said, how can you be an AOR station and not play Billy Joel?
He doesn't like him.
He doesn't like him.
Okay, so he's not going to play Billy Joel.
He evidently doesn't like Dion, and of course it's she.
God don't know what they're playing.
And here's GTR over here next door, and they don't have any balls over there.
Okay, they play the same safe stuff, you know, the same groups over and over again,
including groups that I like, but I don't want to hear four in their all day, okay?
Right?
Do you?
No, it's the tested safe.
Yeah, tried and true safe.
So there's no station in this market where you'll really get a chance.
It's really some commentary that this, which is a hot album already, by the way,
and getting a lot of play on AOR stations, the only place you'll hear it in this market
is on this show on an AM station.
I wasn't at, and this isn't even a music show.
What do you think of that?
Unbelievable.
Thank you.
Shocking.
So just for the record, spike wise, you're a putz, and when you keep looking at those trends,
you keep seeing that little yo-yo up and down and down and then up a little bit.
See, they get a fluke once every three or four months, and then they go up and they get all excited.
Then they come back to where they really belong.
They should be dominating, because they just like, you know, five minutes away
at any given moment from being off the air.
Okay.
She is like, they made a little bit of a comeback here.
Somebody gave him some oxygen, I think, by default.
Mm-hmm.
But the guy only knows what the hell they're doing.
So they ought to be running away with it. They ought to dominate.
Okay?
And they don't.
Because their music sucks.
Focus groups.
Incredible.
Unbelievable.
I wish I had in the bank.
Yeah.
The money, the stations like these, these two here in this building, waste.
Ah, on focus groups and all these other phony baloney studies.
You can't program music on focus groups, okay?
And over at Zeta, did you notice they used to do that all the time?
All stations.
Yeah, down here.
Same thing.
And you keep, it doesn't work.
I mean, if it works, how can you be doing a one share
and you keep doing the same thing month after month with focus groups?
Oh yeah, they react real positive.
It's like, you know, in commercials, they react.
They get these people in a room and they hook them up to like,
they're like light detectors.
They detect all their emotions.
And what they sweat or puke or anything even close to that.
And then they get the reaction of it because they're spending a lot of money to make those commercials
and they want to know how the public is going to react.
Well, it's the same thing with the focus groups on this music, you know.
And they get like 14 drunks that they got down it.
You told them somewhere and they bring them in a room and they sit them down.
And they put the music on and half of them are stoned out of their mind.
They can't understand what the music is anyway.
Oh yeah, man, that's real great.
Okay, give it like five stars on a sheet.
And that's how they determine what music they're going to play.
There are a bunch of jackasses, okay?
There are a bunch of idiots.
The first thing is what kind of a person would participate.
You know, it's obviously the kind of person that does nothing else to do.
Wait a minute, I gotta find a one part.
Okay, here it comes. You ready?
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
1046 at WIOD, pardon us for getting hysterical and excited, but it's so damn frustrating.
You try to talk sense to people in this business in this market.
And they don't have any sense. They won't listen to you. They know it all, okay?
If they know so much, how come they're rating suck?
You want to answer that question for me?
No.
Like Rose Folger, who wouldn't know a hit record if it bit him on the lip?
What he knows about music, you can put in this can over here of Diet Cherry 7 up
and have room for the entire Chinese army leftover in drag.
Okay?
It's 1047 at WIOD, the music of your life.
Research is ruining this country. I've said this before.
Exactly. I've said this for years.
Whatever happened to gut instinct.
Yeah.
When Gary Lawrence, I don't want to pick on him because he, you know, he was okay to me.
Although he was a cheap bastard, but he was a pretty good guy.
But I'd go into an argue with him and the bottom line was he couldn't, in fact,
nobody that was ever in that chair in that building or in this, in this building,
now I'm got any idea.
But can't you turn on the radio and listen to something with your own ear and decide if it sounds good?
Not, not if you're in programming or if you're one of the executives.
They got to bring in all these experts and they got to conduct studies and they got to have maggots studies
and pay $40,000 and he comes out with a big black book and he says,
the audience wants to hear the weather, the news, and the traffic.
They got to spend $40,000 to find out that the audience wants to hear the news,
weather, and traffic in the morning.
Okay? That's the kind of morons we have programming these radio stations, folks,
which is why you have so much boring crap on your radio.
It's enough to make me sick.
Would you agree?
Their jackass is an idiot.
Exactly. He is redeeming himself with it.
Very important what? Very important you deliver it tonight.
That's great.
When you just relax Fernando, he's so hyper.
Food from natural eats just arrived, ladies and gentlemen, and of course fat rich is digging into the bag with his very hands like an animal.
I've never seen anything sort of disgusting in my life.
So you're delivering at night now from natural eats from what?
What time? Five to nine?
Look at that. Or five to eight?
Depending on whether Fernando's got something else going on.
We'll see how it goes. Well, isn't that interesting?
Okay, let's just get the food open and cut the crap.
10.51 at WIOD. I'm sorry you couldn't be here, Vetch,
didn't share our lunch with us.
I would love to be there.
Hold on one second.
Listen, we got to collect call from Jupiter.
Now you'll hold for that, won't you?
I'll hold.
I'll tell you one thing, boy, he really must be desperate because ordinarily he would hung up a half hour ago.
Good morning, Neil.
Hi, this is Doc from Jupiter.
Long time, Mr. Frickle.
Who is it? Doc from Jupiter.
Doc? Doc, the OC.
Doc? Yeah.
Doc? We got any napkins in here, by the way.
Don't mind us, Doc. We're eating.
Bad radio, Neil. I know.
I was flipping through the channels last night on the TV
and I caught Morton Downey's act last night.
He said in all time, low.
He's desperate.
They had...
I heard that he's doing a video with Rob Low.
He had on dwarf tossing.
dwarf tossing? Yeah, dwarf tossing.
Were they tossing him on the show?
No, no, no, they had a big mat.
A big mat? A big mat?
You know, like wrestling mat?
Oh, I see, yeah.
And did they toss work?
Because I would have paid to see that.
No, dwarf, majors.
It's a new thing going on around in the country.
I guess it bars.
And so they had...
Was Bob Mayor on the show?
Oh, no, no.
They had a bunch of dwarfs there that were against it
because it was breaking bones and things like that.
And then he had these big, you know, like football players throwing them for distance.
And I just thought you'd like to hear about that
since you bring up Morton Downey once in a while.
Yeah, he's really...
He needs a publicity, believe me, boy. He's on his last legs.
Have it down, Lee.
I told you, he had...
Didn't I say when we first came over here in another six months or so?
Yeah, I remember that because I started listening to you when he came to IOD.
And since we came over here, he's been moved from a primetime at night
into the one o'clock in the afternoon on 39 here.
Plus, he's been dropped out of several stations.
Yeah, I watch him on...
or what channel is it?
WLR, like midnight.
Mm-hmm.
And, yeah, I just thought he'd be interested in that to work with him.
Well, I don't want you to feel too bad because Morton made 40 million last year.
Okay, so he probably won't miss any meals.
He even made enough to get the warts removed.
Yeah, that's a few bucks more than I made.
Yeah.
All right, and the arm out of...
Material.
Okay, well, it was a great call, sir.
I'd let anybody tell you otherwise.
Okay, he's almost as good as Steve's picking the freakness.
See your bird.
Okay.
All right.
Now, see, that was worth waiting for, wasn't it?
Oh, yeah, right.
Now, what do you want?
All right, listen.
Why do you've been shining me?
What the hell does that mean?
Every time a Roger puts you on hold, you hang up if we don't put you on in 30 seconds.
So, no, no, really.
And tie up our very valuable vocal line.
What is that?
Soup?
Well, you guys went crazy with it.
This is good.
Hey, Glen.
Yeah?
Thanks, Jeannie.
Listen, I wanted to wish you happy, belated birthday.
Thanks, Feds.
I hope everything was great for you.
I heard that day.
I heard the radio, whether it came in speaking, I heard, you know, how you guys had a good
time on the station there.
Yeah, it does sound like we had a good time.
Good time on what?
Here on the station.
When?
With the stripper, though.
Last Thursday.
Well, last Thursday, yeah, that was quite a show last Thursday.
That was amazing.
That was because Hank was here.
Eating.
Saying nothing, just eating.
Well, he's had a few little vicious comments.
Yeah, he had a few shots.
Wow, look at that.
Hey, listen, can I give you an update?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, you remember how I'm famous for the strikers, right?
Whatever you say.
Did you hear about the Fourth Law Deal strikers had the suck this year?
No.
We don't care.
Don't go on your stamp.
Seeing how you're regretting again.
And they're regretting, okay, I won't talk about that.
Nobody cares about soccer here, okay?
Well, Glen does.
No, he doesn't.
He doesn't know a soccer ball from a ping pong ball.
Soccer.
Yeah.
What do you like soccer, though, you like soccer?
Yeah, it's almost as big down here as hockey.
I put them right beside each other down in Florida.
By the way, game six in the NHL finals tonight on the sports channel Florida.
I'm nuts about that.
Well, listen, it's been real exciting.
Yeah, no.
Listen, I like that new song that you played.
I gotta get to you.
That's a really good song.
See ya.
It's great.
Okay, see ya.
Yeah, bye.
Well, listen, we got rid of him, boy.
Open line in Broward 524WYOD.
Bokered 278-9463 in Palm Beach.
No, no hope.
What are you doing now?
You're getting a little carried away.
What is that?
What do you mean from me?
Man's a maniac.
No, don't give that to me.
I can't have a sandwich in baked zedian soup.
And the man's nuts.
I don't underestimate myself.
You're crazy.
Let some of the news people eat some of this stuff, okay?
Like that big salad.
Soup.
What kind of soup we got today?
Ooh, I love mushroom barley.
That's my favorite soup.
How did you know that?
Just because we took shots at Fernando last week,
he brought some good stuff.
Now, isn't that baked zedian grade?
Great.
And he was smart enough to bring two of them.
Yeah.
Here's a mobile on the vocal line.
But this is a great call.
It's going to be a terrific call.
Yeah.
You've been number intense for the last couple of days.
I've been hitting a little bits and pieces here.
What are Todd's numbers?
Who?
Todd.
Todd.
Yeah, your new little...
Oh, you mean Todd in the newsroom?
Yeah.
I'd say about a 13 and a half on a scale of six.
Oh!
Is that any move to my car?
Okay.
Thank you.
Is that desperate, sir?
Well, not actually.
Well, Ross will be in today.
Ross is about an 18 and two thirds.
I'd have to, I'd have to think about that.
As a matter of fact, Laura is hanging out in the newsroom today.
Nobody has seen Laura except for a couple of seconds.
She's waiting for Ross to come in.
Yeah, but is she smiling?
From ear to ear.
There you go.
That tells it all.
Okay.
Thanks, Neil.
1057 at W.I.D.
Now, what were you saying about the zedian?
I was saying I like about it.
It's got zucchini like...
Yeah, it's so great.
I didn't get any of this last time.
Boy did I miss that.
Yeah.
I think we may wind up eating all the food.
And of course, Richie is on a little quiet way over there.
Yeah, Richie is here.
So...
Oh, he's going nuts.
He's going to be mellow today here.
I have a feeling.
Yeah, and I like last week was kind of frantic.
Oh, God.
Wow.
Uh-oh.
What do you want, Henry?
Henry never reads.
Henry's, um, unless it's liquid Henry would talk to.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Do you sell wine?
Oh, he'll be down to see you for an under.
Oh, my God.
Look at the size of the mushrooms in this mushroom barley soup.
Makes me feel inadequate somehow.
1058.
And WIOD, the bulk and poverty lines are both dead.
We don't really care though, do we?
As a dornig.
Damn right.
Miami, hello.
Yeah, Neil.
Yeah, good morning.
How you doing, bud?
Great.
All right, listen, I got a WZTA Spirey Fort.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
How about those numbers, huh?
Yeah, how about that one five in the morning?
Is my favorite.
Listen, I was traveling down the county line road going south.
And what did I see up on the road?
Thanks for, Andy.
What's that?
Sure, some sodas would be great.
Go ahead, sir.
And what did I happen to see up on those highway billboards, fine?
It said 94.9.
Thanks for, Andy.
Watch this space.
Watch, yeah.
Yeah.
You know what that means, don't you?
It means there's some kind of a change coming.
It means I 95.
Mm-hmm.
Great, huh?
Could be.
All right.
Or could be W-O-F-F.
No, I doubt it.
I doubt it.
It'll be good to get on any five back, though, I'm sorry.
Yeah, sure would.
We get to roll the squirrel back over there.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hi, 95.
Maybe we'd have to give Johnny Dolan up, too.
We'd have to make kind of a trade.
Oh, no.
Okay, thanks for the report, pal.
All right, bud.
You're a great American.
It's 10.59.
You know what that means.
That means Henry is slinking into the newsroom as we speak.
And look at that.
Rich is just having a 7,000 calorie salad over there.
Just kind of minding his own business.
And then we'll come back after Henry with the 11 o'clock news.
At 11.05, Steve's got open phones today.
Well, you got the sun he's going to be calling in with reports
on a hurricane's game.
All kinds of stuff here today.
And even Yankee baseball at 7.30 tonight.
Okay, I got one other question.
Yeah.
Is Robin the Doric lady?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
That's why we don't hear from her anymore.
Okay.
In fact, we had a fake Robin on yesterday.
Yeah.
I'm kind of red.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Okay, sir.
Well, I'm glad we were able to answer all the pressing problems
here.
Are you going to be all right now?
Oh, yeah.
Are you sure?
See ya.
Don't encourage him.
We'll let him go.
