in one night the black gospel show personality told you of their arrival and you
were then escorted from the station by the police
uh... if that isn't the most incredible story
i've heard first of all we didn't have any black gospel show personality uh... at
wlac well i was there they had had that before i guess
and uh... nobody came to the station and when i was leaving because i was
going to fill out the exact whole dick casper i said this place is ridiculous
calmer quit after two weeks of their own a whole month
and after three weeks i was going to wdb in filanalfi and all my furniture
went to the
and i was ready to go and we're going to start on a monday
and the casper talk me
in the coming back to w's news instead is only he can do
and ruin my whole life dick i hope you know that and uh... so i did my last
show and as i was leaving i had moved out of my apartment i was saying the
last night in a motel which was right across from the station okay
and i'm walking
it's like half a block you know just right across the street i'm walking from
the station to my motel
and there's a police car pulls up i told us to remain the time of course jackfruit
got a confused i guess maybe his tape got twisted and uh...
i thought oh boy what is this all about they said you know where you can find
the guy named neo rajas and i thought boy this is the end of my life as you know
nash really tend to be a little clandestine
and i said well i'm neo rajas and he said well we just want to thank you for we
really enjoyed the show the month you were here and you
we grew up here and we were really uh... bigoted racist kind of people and we
just uh...
we feel that you've opened our eyes to a lot of things that we never heard
before we've never been exposed to different kind of thinking we want to thank
you for your show is great and i was it a last like a minute you know which is
a really uh... nice experience you know
and that was it and he managed now so you've heard the real story now you think
back to this uh... that's that tell you everything you need to know about jackfruit
oh man incredible and of course that it goes i don't even know if these are worth
i think they might be about
drooling over alan drasner saliva

Las Vegas has a great body

she wasn't catching the head you know what really turned you on and everything so
it i thought it was kind of funny just reminiscent on the old stuff
