Paradise and that's why I you know people say well if you don't like it
Why don't you get out of here? I do I love the climate okay?
But it's frustrating to live in a community that's got the potential to be everything this one does and see it be such a horse and buggy town
How can it's almost it's almost the year 2000 how is it possible?
For a community I'm talking about Daybroward Palm Beach
Four million people okay one of the large markets in the country made your market
How is it possible for this to still be a seasonal town when you tell me that how is it possible?
No answer
There is no answer no there's no answer because again the politicians won't respond to it because none of them got the balls to say this is crazy
What they do is they help to perpetuate it they help to make it worse they cater to it
I'll tell you I'll tell you what would solve a lot of our problems
Let's let's we ought to have a 10-year period in which no politician can run again and become a and no incumbent can run for reelection
Then you'd see some changes
Instead of these little empire builders and the very shrivers who suddenly have a political awakening and change party because they find that there were a lot of cubans in their
You know in Dave County and they need their votes so a lot of a sudden they become good little Republicans the same people who were endorsing Ted Kennedy in
1980 now are good Republicans and
Instead of being empire builders and worrying about their six thousand dollar a year jobs that they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of other people's money or in some cases millions of dollars in the mayor elections
You have to really wonder about that don't you why somebody would spend say a million dollars to get a job that pays six thousand a year
You know that's yeah a real ponderous question in all levels of politics. Yeah exactly
millions of dollars of other people's might to get a job that pays a 60,000 80,000
6,000 even a president only makes 200,000. It's right
some pay a dollar a year
Some jobs
God yeah, you have to really wonder it's an ego trip. It's a power base
It's an open door to every kind of scam and every kind of rip up how many people are Lyndon Johnson
He came at office. He was basically a schlepper when he died
He left millions of your radio stations. I mean you name it
multi-millionaire
And I thought all during that time he was supposed to be the president
Of course, we would have been a lot better off if he wouldn't have been but that's another story
He was busy sending American kids to be killed for five years. You know, he was too busy
Hmm. I mean this uh, it's just astonishing what this country is becoming and nobody cares
Just give us uh, just give us more down in junior and give us heraldal and give us Sally Jesse and give us uh
Glow wrestling, you know, I mean it's got to stop somewhere for crying out loud
There's got to be some things that that count for something
don't there
I mean life isn't just one big escape. There's got to be some kind of meaning or substance to your life
But not in this community man. Hey, we're used to it. We don't give a damn
Just keep out those foreigners man and anybody speaks of four language here screw them, you know, but I mean that's that's a terrific solution to the problem
It's
It's unbelievable really is
And now all of a sudden you in fact was that in a herald that you open all those pages? Yeah, the herald
Well, but first of all let's take a look. Okay, this is the middle. This is two that is right in the middle of superbowl week
Okay, and of course we know because you we are your superbowl superhost station in case time look up
Front page front page full color pictures. How often do they have full color pictures of Miami on the front page?
Okay, I like that
Police chase sparks violence
Overtown melee erupts after motorcyclist dies
Isn't it interesting?
Arthur McDuffy was on a motorcyclist isn't that coincidence? I guess now it just to go incidents
But I mean I don't I only mentioned it in passing as we have no details whatsoever of what really transpired
Whether this guy was about to hit the cop who wound up shooting or what what went on there something obviously happened that triggered the shooting
And then you open it up and after you get through the Jordan Martian bird-earns ads page 13
That's the incredible pages 12 and 13 and isn't it ironic? Here's a big thing about Jackson rips Reagan at Martin Luther King writes
Martin Luther King is turning over in his grave, okay
Here we go 1313 a big big pictures
Mm-hmm
Fire smolder police cars bodies rocks gunfire
Disturbency rups after police chase six schools closed today
Why the black community was tense
And all the recollections of the Liberty City riots back in here again, too. Mm-hmm
Oh and listen listen to some of the comments community leaders all those are good. Yeah
Dorothy Weaver former president of the Miami Chamber of Commerce. You know how much I love those chamber of commerce types
They'll tell you the truth anytime boy. They'll really let you know what's going on
Dorothy says obviously
It's a very unfortunate thing for the image of the community because single events tend to get a tremendous amount of media attention
Single events is though
This is some kind of an isolated event that doesn't occur here very often
We don't really have rampant drug problems in this community
We don't really have corrupt police
We don't really have a terrible tension between the police and the black community and other segments of the community
We don't really have refugees pouring in on buses. We don't really have people living on the streets
It's just a single event that the media gets excited about right Dorothy brilliant
Carrie Meek state senator says as I wrote today in a Martin Luther King parade young black people were shouting in me about how they saw
Nicaraguan's being hired for five dollars an hour and they were yelling. Why can't you get me a job?
You know the attitudes see that's another another reason another big reason
Why the so-called black community in South Florida so much different from black communities in Atlanta or in St. Louis or in Detroit or in Boston or in most of the country
Because we got a real bad bad bad attitude that exists in much of the black community
Here in South Florida. I'm not saying that these people haven't been suppressed because they have something fierce in this community
But after a while you can't keep pointing the finger at other people and blaming somebody else for bad attitudes
Walking around with a ghetto blaster on your shoulder with a jivest attitude isn't the solution to the problem in the black community, okay
And standing by and watching drug dealing going on rapidly in overtown and liberty city on every street corner
And I've been talking about this for the last seven years and it's still just as bad as it ever was
That isn't the solution to the problem either and just sitting by idly and keeping your mouth shut because you're afraid
Reggie Williams bangles linebacker member of the Cincinnati City Council who obviously is
A great American sociologist says it concerns me that it happened on the celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday
It points out that we still need to work more together. Oh, there's a very profound statement by Reggie Williams
I wonder why they didn't ask Reggie Jackson or Michael Jackson
Oh and Sergio Pereira the former county manager and his infinite wisdom a brilliant man
We'll sell you a suit any day of the week
Sergio says
A lot of us got involved and put a lot of effort in the Super Bowl because we felt it was a great opportunity
To revive the image of South Florida and Miami now this hopefully it'll just it listen to this line
This is the greatest line in the history of Miami
This is even better than what that idiot Maurice for a set a few years ago about hey, you know
It may not be great
But we don't have to worry about the recession because we got the drug economy going on here
Everybody's got suitcases full of money. This is even better than that
Sergio says hopefully it'll be reported just as a crime incident
And this is on the page and right next to the right next to his quote is a picture of the burning channel six staff car
And
Above it here are the police and on the opposite page here all the smoke and the
fire smoldering and
Parts of overtown burning yeah just as a another little incident. Okay, just a little cry
See what I mean. This is what goes on in this community. Let's just cover it up
Let's just pretend it's oh, it's just an isolated thing. It's tragic. It's unfortunate
It's not really part of this community. We're a world-class city. God. We got the metro rail. It cost a billion dollars
Nobody's on it, but it cost a billion dollars. We got that new train. We got
i95 is you know tied up for the next 20 years. It's horrendous
There's still lifting the bridge with a with a crane down here. I got the bridge before I came to work this morning
You know everything was fine. I get here and there's there's still raising it with a crane. How many years will that go on?
This is a horse and buggy time and the technology you can't complain about the technology in Florida because there isn't any okay
Have you experienced a thing of people who live in Broward or Palm Beach or say Broward and they think well
It's oh, they're oblivious. Yeah, oh, it's only in Miami. Oh, it's down there. It's down there. Oh sure
Have you had the experience that I have a friends of mine in Fort Lauderdale who come up to me and say
Gee, there must have been a bunch of people from Miami because we know for Lauderdale in great shape
Yeah, we know the amnesty we know the traffic is terrific in Fort Lauderdale
And we know that there are a lot of young people there and that the beach is thriving and tourism is going wild in Fort Lauderdale
And another great thing about the week this caps it all off. We talked about it last Friday a big article in the paper
About the hotel rates but all these little hotels ripping the daylights out of the public for the Super Bowl week
Okay, raising gouging the prices and of course this is the season when they already have their highest rates
Between December and April already but they've jacked those up again because they know there's a you know only so many rooms at the end
So they'll get whatever the traffic will bear
Miami nice
Oh, yeah, Miami nice all these simplistic stupid moronic campaigns all these yo-yo chamber of commerce types you people make me want a puke, okay
You're you're not a solution to the problem you people are a big part of the goddamn problem
Because you'll want to keep sweeping everything under the carpet and you think by coming up with some cute cliche or some stupid poster
You think that's going to change the toilet that we're living in here
Just go on a plane trip somewhere and tell somebody you're from Miami and they look at you like oh my god and you're still alive
Exactly upstate to that happens. Yeah, just tell anybody you're from Miami and they just
They cannot believe that you still have all your limbs that are in one piece. That's a fact
But oh, it's just the image. It's just the perception. It's not the reality. No, this this stuff here was not the reality
And all those kids that got their brains gouged out with bottles. That was not reality. That was just the perception
I tell you the one thing that's lacking in this town more than anything else very simple word balls
10.51 at W.I.O.D. I want to
Oh, excuse me. Yeah, that car's a little muddy Roger, but that's you know scots under a lot of pressure in there
It is super bowl week and we are after all these super bowl super hostation. It's 10.55 at W.I.O.D.
And I could ramble on here the entire four hours there really could it one of those rare days
It's kind of like a throwback to the old days, but um, well you finally got your act together
I got my act together and I'm doing serious heavy
Topical talk today, but I mean, you know life is more than just fun and games
You have to be a multi-dimensional person and a problem with some people is they're either much too serious all the time
Or they never take anything seriously life is like you know whole like the movie last night
I think
What constitutes bra I shouldn't generalize, but very often what constitutes a good movie is a movie that can make you laugh and cry like
Rainman like rain man and like towards song trilogy
That runs the gamut sure human emotion as opposed to something now I grant you some like muddy python
You're not doing a lot of crying during their movies, but they're funny as hell, you know
And here comes a message from Tom jicca. Oh
Instant reaction. Oh, yeah, by the way Tom. We are these super bowl super hoax
By the way, Cheryl is the book do we have the whole book? Oh?
Can we see it just got it this one that'll help that'll help relieve us from all this other grief that's going on
Okay, we can look at the book of the peace on talk radio will be in tomorrow's paper
Thank you so much Tom and thank you so much for reminding everybody that w. I. O. D. Indeed is the Super Bowl
I mean, you know Tom is right. It's much you do about nothing and I agree with that and
That being the case why did it merit this entire outrageous column right?
And our Laura's given us stuff here. What is this?
well
Why are you giving that to me? I don't understand. I just we just see there's a problem Laura
There's a little problem Laura bring Laura in there. Okay. No, it's your gitter because it's a little problem
She wants an air check at 1110. We already did the spot. We moved it around a little bit here and for her
Laura it's just
And it says please let's not miss them
Highlighted in yellow
Well, we're gonna miss it because we already just did it but
That's okay. Don't panic. Don't have an nervous break. I want those little things reluctantly
One of those little noodickey things in life Roger is dragging her in now she won't come in. No. She's afraid we'll talk dragging her in
By her hair
What is he doing? Well, anyway, we don't want to get side tracked
1058 at W.I.O.D. and I'm sure that when we come back following the news break
We're gonna have some really poignant and meaningful calls from the
Brilliant folks in this very concerned community in which we live right
Oh, you know, you notice it's exactly the same as oh in fact
They're one line went out already in Broward. We had all the day in Broward lines going because usually as we sit down
Even when the show starts we got four or five calls before we get gone and
Bokeh and Palm Beach. Thank you so much, Cheryl. You're just you're looking so much better today
You really are you look like you're really fresh good yesterday
Here's the book here's the whole book and we're coming up on the news
Which means we'll get a chance to go through it hour by hour and really peruse it. Oh
We have tos our rounds see all the real intricate we can look at the mornings on Zeta hour by hour and see how well they did
Should we look at that just before you come true? I realize this is kind of a flip after everything
I've been talking about but like I said life is not you have to maintain an even keel
You just can't go off the deep end one of these fractions here
So it okay if I laugh when you read those Zeta numbers
Oh
I like that big five to six hour they have it in the morning at Zeta they got a point seven
One thing I always liked we had a huge lead in man
Especially when old moon was on air boy the moon man. Well, it's not like antique time
But no that is true
Why don't forget the best in the elever Saturday from 10 to 2 immediately following antique time on your super bowl super host antique station
W I O D
Okay, Henry Barrow speaking of antiques Henry a standing bot. He's got the 11 o'clock just a little joke
Henry don't get all up tight now. It will overcome all these things. Okay, we shall overcome a Henry standing by
He's been sipping on the bubbly little bit this morning
So if he sounds a little giddy you'll have to understand and pardon him
He said a long rough life and been here much too long and then we'll come back without number two at 11 o' 5 and check it out
With all the brilliant comments from the concerned citizens of south Florida
I O D it's 11 o' 5 at w i o d. That's some interesting things in the book
But we don't want to get into that because I've lifted a whole hour. Well, it would be unfair
Wouldn't that would be? Can we look at this a couple as Nixon said it would be wrong
Just a couple of selected numbers the amazing part of it is we were only here five of the 12 weeks in a fall book
And we'd still be sandy in every hour. Oh sandy
Yeah, not amazing. I miss sandy
Do you know how much you do
We had uh, I can't believe this the 11 o'clock at the big 11 o'clock hour that this hour this hour we got a five one
Yeah, that's the big hour. Yeah, four seven four nine five one four six
When you're these biggest hours the six o'clock hour
Wow, eight five six o'clock
Huh
The nine o'clock hour is not the big hour
Just the opposite you know that big nine o'clock hour. That's kind of like your super bowl super raced
I mean, it's good
The least of all the others okay
Anyway, it's 11 o' 6. I guess we ought to take some of these calls right let some of these people
Irraculate is that we're gonna do light light house point hello Neil Rogers. Yeah. I'm going from playground magazine to remind you it's time for any
Huh
Hoppano hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah, just the end bow last night
What the end bow last night what are you talking about um the news no? Well, she was she was pretty pissed
She had they she was grittin her teeth. They're a little bit about this overtown thing. Mm-hmm. Anyway, I just want to told you to tell you that um
Last night my wife beat my black lampador so I tortured her car. Yeah
and then I turn towards myself that'll solve well I would be a good idea I think for you okay
I don't know why I'm taking any calls okay yeah there that first call was
that's yeah and there they go all gone those were just
clear the whole board I'm not gonna waste my time like I said
are that's if that's the best you can do yeah I'm not gonna what you know waste the energy and people say oh he's wasting
his talents and he isn't talking about the serious subject and burning the goddamn city down we got
that got only knows how many hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who are allegedly gonna pour into this town and that's what we got here okay
don't please don't waste my time not even answer him okay screw him we'll talk about the book a little bit here
great because now just you just can't do it there just no point I mean basically have a bunch of mindless automatons out there
and there no point in trying to you know make something out of you you can't make chop liver out of chicken
yeah mm-hmm dropping yeah very nice okay that was a very you know mild way exactly I would like to put it in a different way
but now don't start sucking around now so you know they're all going except of course for those two Palm Beach lines
they could be burning the whole party down and as long as it didn't cross the Palm Beach board they're not
interested okay don't confuse them they don't want to know from all of this they're a nice and a Gentile up there
and they got everything you know under control and they're getting their sheets ready for the big weekend rally up there in
Lantana so everything is under control I imagine this was big news for Palm Beach listeners that something happened in Miami
imagine this was a big shocker to them this yeah I'm sure it was anything would be a shocker to those people most of
our brain debt because they've listened to the John Levitt show for about 10 minutes anyway let's see 18 to 34 now
that's an interesting demographic isn't it I don't know why I keep looking at these really because these aren't
our numbers can we do some I like those but to give you an idea we were only here for five weeks
right mornings we had a 22 this is an 18 to 34 persons midday a 4-0
hmm afternoon's a 2-4 nights a 1-1 hmm and on a weekend a 3-7 hmm oh it must be that antique show
haha we're the landing garden now or how about many team to 34 that ought to be pretty interesting shouldn't
I'm just looking at those areas where I think we probably did pretty well okay I could be wrong which would be very embarrassing
and 18 to 34 WIOD in the morning of 3-3 midday a 6-2 afternoon of 4-2 nights a 1-7 weekends a 6-2
that's a dolphins hmm that's good okay and by the way speaking of the dolphins even though they didn't make
the playoffs this year and obviously will not be in the game we are your super bowl super hostation
and we're going to crank that promo up several times this hour all the long one just to get Tom jicca
p-o'd okay yeah just to get him really upset haha
well those Zeta numbers they are really doing it aren't they well can you give me some hour by
hours Zeta's oh I thought we already did that well I'm gonna relish I want to sort of anything
would be better than talking to these idiot yeah you know that I sort of want to you know kind of
okay let's you WZTA right it's 5 to 6 am a point seven now keep in mind we were there for
almost half this yeah well that's right six weeks uh-huh half got a six o'clock hour two oh
two six three one three five oh so the big nine to ten hour is actually the over there was
hmm hmm um pause of course it loses more than half the audience immediately takes a wicked dive
with a one six a one five a one four and a one seven well he's kind of consistent and then my
client who had a giant book on which we congratulate him a one five a one eight a one eight and a two
two which he is now wearing and their nighttime numbers from seven to midnight this is what makes
it a great radio station these nighttime numbers a one seven a one two a one point oh a point six
oh point five and then the big midnight to one hour a point five oh boy you know how many people
that translates to it midnight average quarter hour seriously no six hundred oh they could they
could easy I mean we worked there for a long time make it easy you take that parking lot and get a
bunch of people and campers and trailers to come in and save the juice turn the uh power off on
the transmitter give it a rest we could get that easy that in this parking lot over here no problem
we can take a megaphone out there would leave foul or in the you're out here get more than six hundred
how many million people are in that uh coverage you're in for four million people six hundred people
and those are six hundred they got broken radios they got old crystal sets they can't they can't
change a dial okay it's twelve minutes past eleven at w i o d let's take a little break and when we
come back we'll decide what we're going to do okay a little while yeah rogers got such a
fancy here doesn't it like Charlie Babity made little joke let's cute I feel like Raymond Babity at
the moment to be honest with eleven fifteen at w i o d and uh we don't know whether the screen
read a banana at this point you think we ought to take some calls I don't know I'm
but genuine this this program bears out exactly what I say okay um about the only people you would
get in calling about anything to say about anything I discussed in that first hour would be the same old
crotchety old talk show crowd you know the ones I'm talking about how I agree with you and they
are around up everybody who doesn't want to work or speak english and send a Siberian and that's
basically what we got so let's just go back to being a bunch of morons and being oblivious okay
because I guess every once in a while I laps and I lose my sense of perspective on a whole thing
you know I just I laps into this phony reality and when you live in this town you should not have
anything to do with reality she just continue being a moron and being oblivious to everything
that's going on around you and you'll be okay right that's right but it is super bowl week ladies
and gentlemen we want to continue adding to the hype and remind you that this is w i o d you're a
super bowl super hostation now here is uh some here are some segments of the last eighteen super bowls
in a row okay that could kill the rest of the show couldn't now you're looking at that book
in this big 11 new now I ran into skip herman out in the hall there and he was talking about how
the kernel is off this week he's taking some time off you know what do you mean he's taking some
time off he just was on vacation for a week Christmas week he wasn't there isn't this now you
worry the uh seventeen that's right now he's been over there less time than you and I have been here
because he was here the first couple of weeks we were here so he's been over there about seven eight
weeks I guess we've been hot ten weeks yeah yeah and he's on a second week vacation and now he
had to get some numbers back he had a week off at christmas and now he's off again for what
I guess cuz he's looking for a job I don't know fascinating fascinating I don't know what about
rose what is rose doing over there is he making any projections what's that oh I don't know
whatever you want to do Roger what do you want to do Roger wants to know should I answer the phone
whatever you want to do I don't I really don't personally I don't give a damn okay see if Ed's
on there are cable ones we'll talk we'll talk to Ed believe me that's all I need to know you want
yeah good in the office there go call him I'm sure Ed will give you a real good perspective on
what's going on yeah see that's what we need well I sure wish I had a nice cigar here you know
today yeah need to brought some good cigars to Ben Spencer not here today he'd go give me some yeah well
you were chain smoke in those cigars I was well you know me once I get emotional I start chain
smoking cigars or pipes or something Mike stands okay let me see if we can make that Palm Beach
line ring that would be exciting the other ones are all starting to do something now but that
Palm Beach line eight so nice just can't get into well I do want to say WJNO I think we should
be fair give credit where credit is due for the first time in history now that they got that
repeater and brown they actually showed up in the dead brown book and they devastating did they
beat they made your impact for example they just relax now for example in midday they had a point
three an afternoon drive that a point four and this is before Lee follow up and they so God only
knows what's going to happen over there now amazing least number in the date brown book is about
the same as when he was in this market about a point four so one thing about Lee he may not be
good but he is consistent okay oh look at that Palm Beach hello yes yes it's WIOD yeah
I speak to him speaking oh this is yeah yeah it's Palm Bay calling oh yeah well listen have a nice
life pal that's it idiot from yesterday how come he didn't go off when I punched it off I haven't
called for a long time wait a minute I'm punching this guy off he wants to talk three times before
disappeared what do you mean called for lunch didn't you just call the other day I don't know I
I honestly think it was yesterday wasn't I don't know it was either Friday or yesterday I'm almost
sure it was yesterday and called for a long time you're a moron sir we don't want to talk to you
you're an idiot yeah palm don't you understand how you actually get out of bed and get dressed in
the morning is one of the great mysteries of all time okay we got an open line in brown word five
two four WIOD we just will not ask for a Palm Beach okay what does your t-shirt say Glenn what's
your t-shirt say big bang the big bang okay thanks oh yeah another one of those evolutionists over
there okay it's my team past eleven WIOD kind of smiled and looked in here like what is
what does that mean you know those people at GTR they're little they're a little confused they
are animals that's correct Miami hello hello yeah yeah look today I want to ask you a couple
oh yeah why isn't that one the two white officers were shot by the black men we didn't write in
our community well I don't the recall white people rioting in the south Florida I couldn't be
wrong I've lived here for almost 15 years I do not recall I you know maybe I've had a memory
lapse I don't recall it happening what if in addition in addition to which what difference does
it see the problem with this is right away every time we have an incident like the Mercado beating
the Hispanic police officers association is marching and protesting they don't even know all the
details yet but the major concern in this town is was the officer white was the Hispanic was the
black was the victim why all this other crap and so the hell with justice or with the details just
let's worry about you know who is which color in which race you know that's what it's all about
um mirror mar hello hello yeah yeah I just I'm just going to accept every time I
what you were talking about all day we nobody cares you know what we grew up in the 60s everybody
been listening to the calls I mean why even bother talk of these people they don't care I know but
it's I just these clouds the whole society everything nobody cares everybody grew up in the 60s and we
cared about civil rights we cared about well I'm 60s a bunch of charts ancient history sir Ronald
Reagan has done a brilliant job in eight years of teaching america not to care about anything not
to be concerned about human life about the environment well you should be concerned about unborn
human life that he's very concerned about but anything else so don't worry about that just be
in a materialism and what's in it for me and selfishness and that's what america they they like
that message a lot and it like anybody else who parrots it so that's become very popular but where
did where did all these people that were concerned where where they got they've sold they've sold
out pal and and and and you talk about Reagan they have too much wicked weeds are it affected
their brain and now they are mentally impotent and probably most of them physically the same and
they're useless all right that I understand now but did you happen to see 60 minutes on Sunday with
the interview with Nancy and Ronnie oh no I wouldn't watch that boring I'm going to tell you they
ask Nancy Reagan some questions and she just sat there looking yeah well she's been dead for seven
years but nobody told her yeah we got enough excitement of our own without them and not only that
but we don't have enough metamusil to go around as it is okay you have a great day pal don't worry
about it it's going to get a lot worse 22 past 11 and WIO day there's an open line in
Broward if you move real fast now we're getting some assimilating response to the crises of our
time is 524 9463 in Broward and of course that oblivious line Palm Beach where you can get in
from Palm Bay even or Jupiter or Uranus 655 WIOD why did they waste that money on that line I'm
going to that's going to be my next crusade I can't solve all these other problems but maybe we
can get that Palm Beach line taken out that's like burning the money it's like buying a lottery ticket
hey listen Toyota of Hollywood is the WIOD look at that Henry's got that the big dom bottle in
there with little ball peen hammer ladies and gentlemen he's hitting the bottle again yeah
he thinks it's Maxwell House coffee and they're good to the last drop you know he's got it
the straight up in the air and the bottle too okay it's 27 past the only wish Henry you only wish
yeah that made him happy and wishful thinking on your part 27 past 11 is wife laugh when I
said that where we going next we got a mobile in bokeh hello yeah Neil yeah I just wanted to say
you know maybe if everybody quit rebuilding their cities after they burned it down maybe they
stopped doing it yeah brilliant thoughts sir thank you so much for your great contribution from
bokeh yeah okay Miami hello are you Neil how you doing great this is one of your closet Cuban
listeners yeah I'll tell you I just want to tell it and tinkle on you and say that you guys doing
a great job you and Gwen you should have watched that 60 minutes I know you don't like to see it
Ronald Reagan made some some brilliant comments as usual yeah that you'd have been really proud of
um last night as I was watching TV and all the riots and everything came on I thought oh no
not again yeah and I you know for a second I thought well maybe a 20s crime show that's a replay
from the 80 riots and reality hit me and I thought this is great it's perfect here we are with
the Super Bowl the world's eyes are on us and what do we do yeah we really know how to put our best
foot forward don't we there were the Miami nice project has obviously worked out very well
no question about it that's going to turn it around for us in fact as they say at one radio station
we've turned the corner well if we turn the corner like Zeta did I think yeah I think there's a great
similarity I you know now that you mentioned it now the fact I'm going to look up the numbers for
the Miami nice campaign in this arbitron book and see if they showed up probably as low as Zeta
yeah right right next to it and and Florida this morning on television on good morning America
goes and says old and I think you mentioned this yeah we're we're building all these great buildings
and in overtown yeah we're all over housing yeah and I'm thinking well that's great that's really
going to do with the heck of a lot of good and I can just see I'm surprised my mother-in-law she lives
out in North Carolina she didn't call and and ask how we were and where we endanger I mean as it is
they think we lived in a we live in an armed camp down here and then wow we certainly wouldn't
want to say that even if it's true you know even if everybody you look six-year-old kids
have got holsters and real you know used to be little kids had toy guns now they got real ones you
know well after they get to be teenagers they got oozees in the house well with the NRA in this
state you know the whole thing about everybody should have a gun never mind that all these kids
are dying and all these people are killing well don't confuse them with the facts they don't they
don't like that yeah really well listen Neil just a tinkle and you guys are doing a great job
good luck in the next few months and take care yourself okay thanks bye-bye it's 11 30 at WIOD there's
an opening in date if you move real fast now before the next brush fire breaks out 751 9463 751
WIOD in the land of the free and the home of the grave okay I you know what's a point I don't
know why I went through that first hour it's absolutely pointless it's like a throwback to the old
days and there's nothing that you can say in this town why why haven't I learned that lesson see
it's not my nature just to kind of give up no no but I slowly but surely I was conditioned to
doing that and just accepting the fact that this is basically a toilet with nice climate you know
but the other than that you know this isn't another tape is it got to today I'm not
congratulating you know we got two more tapes today yeah brand new anybody need here's a nice max
L 94 good chase excellent probably about 795 at least huh okay what is this good stuff here
this is from Bob a longtime fan the male is coming in a little trickle today what in God's name oh
it's the whole thing about the Brian Wilson album oh thanks a lot Bob now I remember vividly during
it wasn't the first one the how many riots did we have back in 80 81 82 two or three nights we had
two or three different incidences right well yeah but we had one gigantic Titanic but it wasn't that one
but I remember on a Saturday yeah no not that one but I remember vividly listening to you on
W.I.N.Z when you are at night and one of the nights oh that was no you're thinking of after the
Alvarez Verdict yeah and I'll never forget that because I was on doing my show and I had I don't
want to say the guys name but a real bigot one of these anti bilingual type people who I as time
went on I realized what an incredible bigot this guy was and the during a commercial break the
verdict had just come in not guilty verdict yeah and this guy went nuts and he's screaming and
he's like oh they're gonna burn the town you know and I said would you just try to maintain
just become okay and the news people now they were there because they knew that the jury was on
they were hanging around and Jeff Bray was there mr. Kamkuhl and collected who just went bonkers I
mean he just was you know in the whole news department they were ready to go nuts and I said to them
I said look don't be a part of a problem don't get everybody crazy I said if you just presented
calmly and do a minimum on this and don't overdo it we may get through this thing without a big
problem and as it turned out we did there were there were some minor disturbances but nothing
spectacular thank God you know at that time but boy they were just ready to dive into it and
everybody crazy I did afternoon news at that time I love 94 and I had been called in from vacation
believe it or not if I don't tell you how bad it was it was even worse than the hurricane yeah
you remember when we were on Zeta when we first went over there on the 12th of October and there
was that hurricane Floyd yeah and they were just on the AMA go nuts and oh the world is ending by
but the run for cover hide under a banana plant you know that kind of stuff everybody and we were
doing the opposite but it looks like it probably not even going to hit her just relax and we'll
keep you posted and just be prepared and go out and give her batteries in the doof water and
everything was fine you know and they want to look at like jackasses again that's right but in
this particular case it just you know there will be those who will blame the media and say oh yeah
they overdid it and they use the word right you notice how everybody is so tentative oh they're
using the word disturbance they don't want to use the word right and of course the question is
at what point do we differentiate between the disturbance and a riot how many people need to
participate how aberrant is the behavior have to be before we officially call it a riot and not
only that what difference does it make what we call it awesome they revive those revise those
figures I think they're now it's got to be at least a thousand people it's only six seven hundred
then it's just a disturbance so correct it's a little minor thing it used to be lower but they
raised the numbers and how many people have to get their brains gouge dot before it's a full
fledged riot it's like six yeah at least six it used to be four it's only four or five it's not too
much but I mean even now in it's like let's see twelve six but eighteen hours later after this
incident even now we have very sketchy information we still have a lot to be determined and yet
immediately there's all this you know well the police officers were wide and the guy was on a
motorcycle and he was black and you know it was on Martin Luther King's birthday well that's the point
my god on on that day of all days for us to be having race riots or disturbances and overtown
it's incredible unbelievable no absolutely unconscionable okay but hey listen you folks just go
ahead keep burning your half the neighborhoods down man and burn down those businesses it's
terrific that's the way to make progress in america just keep burning down your neighborhood
that'll do it for you every time
I want to have some real big investment in overtown now huh I just don't know why more people
don't do it might even get a poe folks over there before you know oh boy no oh there's like I
said every street corner overtown liberty city virtue virtually I'll I'll do my little disclaimer
virtually every street corner morning noon and night out in broad daylight you watch the people
peddling dope yeah it's like a smorgas board anything you want man it's out there and hey everybody's
oblivious man it's that's america right and don't blame us because we're not the suppliers we're just
uh you know we just got to make a living what kind of crap is that anyway I don't what am I
getting started for again I didn't hour on it you heard the first two callers in response
so what what's the point okay we're dealing basically with an america full of morons who are
you know primarily tuned in to um heraldo and the sali jessey and wort downy and escape
and cabbage patch dolls etc is the henry with us or is it april or we don't know oh we don't have one
this hour that's right see that see my mind is just running away with me henry is busy he's um
you've heard of rock and bottle throwing henry doesn't have any rocks in here but the bottle uh
that's another story okay eleven thirty five at w i o d we'll be right back
d and now you know the rest of the story it's eleven thirty eight at w i o d we're having a wonderful day
here everybody's in a good mood they're oblivious uh anybody won't get anybody upset right because
it's super bowl week everybody's getting their bed their illegal bet's done on a game
so you don't want to think about the american people they mentally they've been very well conditioned
to tune out yeah anything that they can't answer or that they don't like they just kind of like
tune it out in their brain it doesn't register you're not looking at the entries of gallstream again
uh hum okay here we go but i'm also looking at this ad seventy year old stuns lost vegas experts
his super bowl predictions you know but uh you have to um have to pick one real quick oh i got it
already picked what are you already underlined circle their last one in red the last race yeah
windy affair with water gerry he always picks a horse that's on top uh these are already handicapped
so in other words they're um the chalk is on top but just all the matters is if it comes in
that's all i care about okay well let me pick something that's going to be a little bit uh pay
a little bit better okay well i don't you know go that way so to speak yeah
i'm looking for something that uh really is going to oh gee now here's one i have no faith in
it but i can't pass it up because we've i've given this out before it never does anything it's 12
to one in the morning line in the second race number six with bobby brain ladies and gentlemen
willy be there willy be there yeah excellent excellent that's good for me
asking that question at the finish line willy be there and the answer is probably not but uh i
know but nobody picks it of course in the consensus uh anywhere and the 12 to one it's picked
away way down so there's our long shots special of the day in the second race it could be a giant
double for you ladies and gentlemen you pick it to win it up to get bus fare out of this god for
taking town willy be there in the second at Gulfstream today trust me when i tell you don't
don't lay too heavy okay it's 11 and 40 and let's go to corral springs hello hi Neil yeah how you
i'll be damn telling and i was really surprised you're a really nice guy i thought you'd be
bashing me you know man i walked up about one oh i don't know but no it just uh you know
i thought maybe you'd be in one of your moods you know are you good you want to what moods
one of those moods where you decide to just bash everybody you know that's only on it's just a
radio show we tried to explain that over and over it's just a joke it's like it's like when
you tell people you don't steal the silverware at the restaurant after you tell them at the first
fifty times it should begin to register that is good like i said now why should you be different
no seriously why should you be different and most people in america things just don't register
i mean when you want to just tune them out there's a little automatic device in your brain that
just the siphons the out the unpleasant and the uh man out the unacceptable and you just don't
hear it right i understand that's how i am oh i understand listen i've got a question for glenn
okay how you doing glenn but you're you're doing a great job thanks go ahead
don't let these old people in my amy buggy oh no i don't i love your laughing it's great
and i laugh right along with you by the way i just wonder if you remember uh way back and you're
on love 94 uh used to do it used to do a bunch of bits uh but david capri i think it was correct
and uh something about the dooby brothers how they was had mike mcdonald in the back
oh boy now that little hungry now you know it sounds it vaguely familiar remember that
did you bring a sandwich today yeah you want part of it i don't want to take part of your
sandwich that would be terrible well sort of like uh see because i go to my mother
lunch i'll leave us in i'm not trying to step on your material just that the
the mornin just handed me the playboy book of lingerie sir i'm sorry i'm distracted
we see that god almighty i can handle this a little more effectively well you know
check that over first uh i can't really cover is definitely not oriental sir trying to correct
now can you give me any more hints on it i it sounds vaguely familiar well it's uh you guys
used to say that just about every song i think it was the Beatles enough ad company it didn't matter
who it was right now for all you horny guys out there i want to strongly recommend playboy's book
of lawn here anyway what a january february 89 issue it's 4.95 5.95 in canada by the way so most
of them will not be sold in canada on sale next week this week i am going to tell you something
seriously as one who can look at this very objectively the boobs in on these young ladies in
this magazine are as big as watermelons okay oh my god i'm serious oh my god holy Toledo and
right they better look out in the pickle patches because there are going to be a lot of guys
getting straight to the old pickle patch after they see the seeds kids today and are they
oriental no i don't see any oriental i see a couple of blondes and on page 91 i don't know
any blonde orientals do now i'm just waiting you know for you to send you to oriental 90 and 91
there is uh well these are two different things to young blonde ladies with enormous breasts i mean
oh yeah the centerful ladies and gentlemen i mean we don't have to mucky wrong with all this
nonsense we've been getting into let's get to the meat of the matter okay the centerful
look at that oriental oriental with enormous i mean jai
i am serious she has each breast is the size of mousy toms puppet okay that's how big they are
it's impossible can't be done i'm serious she's the centerful two big pages oriental can't be done
yeah i'm happy it really has very strange taste he hates bett middler how can you hate well i'm
asking a wrong guy nick hates everybody but at least he's consistent he's consistent about it you
but bett middler is a pan is she she's tremendous she's funny as hell as he hates her oh yeah she's
phenomenal because the reason i thought of that is i saw the preview before our torch song trilogy and
one of the previews was that new movie she's in the old beaches yeah and it looks like it's really
gonna be great yeah you saw it yeah it's tremendous yeah funny don't you love the way ranger makes
all these like hand signals i like that i like that i like it was he trying to say that the movie
is number one or was that a little okay it's eleven forty six and wio do i'm gonna let you look at
this during the new news break i cannot oh yeah the rose that was bett middler even even the nick
like the road excellent film so steve needs to go to sandie go to that deconing place you know
where they go into your brain and they put all the pieces back together again because he just
i don't understand his taste very strange and he and after the show yesterday he said to me
oh don't discourage people from going to see talk radio let him go see and make up their own
mind which i think somewhere along the line i said that yeah but i was doing it more in the sense
in fact the uh... fox movies five and a half bucks at night how about that they're up to five and a
half five and a half bucks and they're little i mean they're not great movie theaters they're new
yeah five and a half bucks a lot that's a lot there's six bucks in new york city really and night
i mean see what i don't understand is when you can go at three and a half to noon and a lot of
us for three bucks why is the same flick worth almost double it's always been that way
is it like a hotel rooms in town during super bowl week by the way and don't forget this is your
super bowl super hostation w i o d mr jika cry day metaphorical comparison you didn't see
tom jika's column in the sunscentless morning nick miss all you like it and uh he just rips the
crap at entire column w i o d acts as though wishing makes it so suggesting that it is a hoax that
were perpetrating on the public we are pretending to be the super bowl of station and we're going to
carry the game he doesn't understand that we paid for the rights i've got only knows why to be the
super bowl super hostation because it's much into about nothing but uh... he didn't understand that
and secondly any idiot knows that cbs radio has the rights to the game and we are not a cbs
affiliate that's why w i n z has it because they did their fm affiliate their simul casting
which makes about as much sense is selling lots of balls in southeorevia i mean it just it makes no
sense at all but he doesn't he somehow doesn't say that in there okay and also i think zeta is
perpetrating a hoax by saying they're going to have the game in stereo i don't think it's in stereo
do you it's off cbs radio satin stereo you're right now cbs television uh... would could be in
stereo but i see this radio course not ed they're just going to have it on both channels and tell
everybody it's stereo and that's not is that perpetrating it's in stereo yeah on the promos yeah
well have the game so another jack buckle be in one channel and hang strangle be in the
night i don't think they will be i honestly don't know maybe we're trying to think of something
nasty to say about about happen like both of them so i'm not going to do that i was going to say
like maybe one of them could be in the english channel like maybe if jimmy the geek we're still on cbs
that's jimmy it's eleven forty eight at w i o d i think we'll take our last
this is the neo-rodger cell
oh
any questions oh i got a lot of questions all right but unfortunately nobody in this town's got
the answers it's eleven fifty three at w i o d and um you threw those pictures for the time being
beautiful yeah women credible beautiful yeah you guys out there that need some material
you know i'm talking about yeah the uh playboy lines you're raised those of you who uh like those
erotic pictures i mean there's nothing uh beautiful they're like playboy centerful
oh yeah aren't they but they are yeah that's what they are they're all are yeah
basically yeah they give their names and they're all like playboy playmate if you move that thing
out of the way i could see the name on the side of the magazine playboys um what is it book of
line yeah trust me okay wouldn't steer you wrong all right let's go to uh for lottery hello
yeah nil yeah your first hour was not a waste of show because there are some people up here in broad
to do care yeah not many that's why we got out of date right no you know these politicians that are
in office would like to downplay everything do you already in their in office because these rectal
remnants from prostate's past decide to elect them in the office like mayor Cox yeah well he's a
some of us up here do realize you do spell your last name wrong uh and uh we really do get the
general idea yeah well i'll tell you one thing you sure gave that city a gigantic screwing so
there must be something uh symbolic about that i mean a wonderful day pal 1154 at wio d there's
an open line in brown or at five two four nine four six three five two four wio d your super bowl
super host super silliest station candle hello
nil how you doing great uh this is man yeah manny um only from candle i bet
excuse me i say manny from candle right while the reason i know it is because you said it was manny
and then it said you were calling from candle pretty good deductive powers i even sure
lot coms would be embarrassed um i don't want to bring the show back down to what you had in the
first hour because you sound like you're having a better time but uh i find it a bit ironic i was
watching um that program with sandy duncan the hogan yeah and uh it was about the two younger kids
their father told them that they couldn't go out and they disobeyed their father to go to a martin
mr king rally and um i just find a role ironic on the birthday of this man that everything that he
was against all this violence yeah yeah which is happening our community yeah how many times in the
last two days did we see little snippets of martin luke a king and and and crediting their comments
the other day um you know kept repeating that over and over again about his main message was non
violence you know a progress through non violence and getting involved in the system and changing
things and so on and so forth and right away we have an episode and the immediate knee jerk response
is the same old crap that happens in this town every time some uh tragic incident comes along we
don't even know the details but boy let's uh get all p o'd again and get all whipped up into a frenzy
and start burning people and burning cars and the go nuts again i really saw the problems man
that does it absolutely that the total opposite of where he stood for all this violence and that's
right and not not changed through peace and um you know it's really sad to see this especially in our
community where things have been at least looking a little bit it would be like having a gigantic
for all the environmentalists having a federal holiday in honor of some great environmentalist
somewhere and having an environmental group going setting their redwoods on firing california you
know exactly it's the same exact thing and now i want to just let everything you spoke about your first
hour um i don't know who the hell this community thinks they're flowing saying that that we're good
that we can accept these people into our community without a doubt and this kid this is not a
prejudicial comment there will be a some some kind of rise in crime because these people are going to be
probably a majority of them living in the streets and they're going to have to get money for food somehow
for the world have to be some crime whether it's just uh well see we don't we have short memories
most of the politicians here didn't want to admit what a nightmare mario was in the first place
and now um you know now now that we're on the verge of having perhaps another one they still don't
want to admit you know what went on and what can happen again i mean can you can you just imagine
a repetition of what happened eight years ago on top of everything else eight and a half years later
we're still flowing the facts from mario you know and they're just and they don't know what the
hell they're going to do yeah you know they don't know what to do about it well we have brilliant
courageous powerful leadership in his time man there is impotent is there outgoing president just
keep that in mind man no we're that we have a bunch of mons running the city that's what we have
you got it uh mine no comedy today you all have a good day you too alright yeah and uh you can get
hysterical about it like i sometimes do and i did during the first hour but it doesn't change
anything and the people in this community uh don't get angry enough to make any change it well
once in a great while like for no particular reason or at least no specific reason they got rid of
a couple of incumbents on metro the last time they got mevally philips out and uh they got rid of uh
who uh clearly wants it i think so was it i don't even remember anything i mean i used to know all
the commissioners you know metro in the city of mimey i don't even know half of the names anymore
because most of the people that they uh vote in are a bunch of bozos anyway who have no qualifications
and no ideas and uh that's part of the problem is that people of any quality don't run for public
office in this community because they never get elected anyway most of the people who get elected
are based on you know some ethnic thing you know if they're running on the beach if they're
Jewish they get elected if they're running uh you know in date county if they're Hispanic uh
they'll get elected if they're running in the city of mimey anyway etc and it just uh you know
just basically an ethnically polarized community and nothing has really changed and uh just takes
another one of these little episodes to remind us of what this is all about but life is beautiful
and the climate is great it's going to be about 80 today so remember our secret word for today
is oblivious that's it if you can be oblivious man this is paradise you're just ignore all of these
things and the fact that this is a god forsaken douchebag hicktown bushly place and uh you just
put that aside and you believe all the hoopla and the hype that they write in the papers about hey
it's great it's a world-class city we got those big buildings the metro rails lovely and uh
it's setter and so on and you're going to be as happy as a pig and slump okay you're going to love
and we're pretty damn happy okay so as they say okay we don't want to have that plan over the musical
bed there it'll clash but that's what they say yeah okay uh april war them as standing by with
that new and wio d news and a lot of you guys probably be looking at some of those pictures too
while you're listening to newscast we'll come back in 1205 steve at two on six ten wio d
alright don't start cackling now he's not even through with the intro and you're already
starting okay we can't talk over that then and we can do anything we want because we are you're
a super bowl super host super silliest wio d at six minutes past noon i don't know what steve's
doing today because they don't have a thing open is what i saw it's open with the calorie was
nothing on it's today the uh seventeen the last time i checked yeah it's open as far as i know
okay six minutes past noon at wio d let's go to Miami hello hey nil how you doing okay
hey grand how's it going okay um i thought the biggest ironic thing of first of all like
Xavier forest uh glossing over everything not going to the real heart of the problem first of all
big surprise yeah um about the only thing i can say for me did have the guts to go right in there
even the police wouldn't call on my those reading the story but uh you know that that little
grandstand act doesn't get the job done you know it doesn't change anything if for for eight did
it nineteen eighty and what changed yeah um next i i saw thing last night on channel ten it was
extremely ironic because i missed the last minute half of it because and i had never seen it before
it was it was an encore presentation and honor of martin who took the king it was called i have
the beholder um absolutely fascinating television show i don't know if either of one of you
thought it was couple i saw a couple minutes have it it was fascinating it it took white people
and black people put them in a group and all of the people who had blue eyes had to wear a collar
they were told that they were not smart they were it was just it was really fascinating and one
lady she couldn't take it as she was in there for like an hour she had to leave she did come
back later on when they had the round table discussion about it um it it was really fascinating
and it just it told people what you know i showed white people exactly what it's like to grow black
i had you know i'm a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant and uh you know i it just it really totally
fascinated me i've always considered myself uh you know i come from the south i'm not i'm the
i try not to be prejudiced it's not it's hard when you grow up in a family where you hear certain
words not to pick them up yourself and not to pick up certain prejudices you try to think
differently than some people that came from another generation uh because you do see the positive
things that have happened in the last uh you know 10 or 15 years of well no in the last eight years
our illustrious outgoing president had done more to unify what happened in the last 20 years
that uh you know all his predecessors put together all right and that's one of the reasons that he's
so popular in white America but but you know we're talking apples and oranges there two different
things and i on the one hand we're talking about injustice but on the other hand we're talking about
the response part and an intelligent way to respond to it is not through burning down your own
community well rioting and carrying on like barbarians that is not the answer yeah i really do
think that you have to look at it in this fact i really do think that it was a minority of people
that are living that you gotta realize the great numbers of people that live in a square block
but let me say that let me say this to you okay yeah uh in my neighborhood if if hundreds of
people literally hundreds were out throwing bottles and rocks and setting buildings on fire
i wouldn't really be concerned whether it was a minority or a majority it would still be a riot
it would still put me in jeopardy and it would still place an enormous blemish on a community that i
live in so all of these statistical copouts are meaningless if it's only a half a dozen people
or something or a handful of kids then we're talking a different story but it wasn't it was hundreds
of people well you know one thing that was uh that was brought out last night on the television
was uh one of the reporters said that uh i think it was one of the cbs reporters that actually got
uh in a sort of like beat up or whatever it was the candy for um he said that um he thought it was
he said when you take these kids that were like 12 14 years old that it threw on the right
they were smiling when they were doing it yeah and this is what you're talking there
there is no supervision and and this is the thing that we as citizens who are more fortunate really
do have to go in there and it it sounds pathorizing and but if these kids don't have uh you know
guidance they've got to get it from somebody well the whole value system is still sucks in the
black community in this town anyway as far as i'm concerned and i'm not so sure that you know at
the national level it's all that much better uh over all the hoop hoopla about the superball you
know there's this big uh to do about the icky wood shuffle if you see that thing and every time i
watch that to me it is so racially demeaning it's like a step-in-fetched routine that he does
and the fact that black athletes many of them behave in this way so that the young black kids can
emulate the behavior is pathetic because the rest of white america looks at it and and you know
it's the whole thing is just a piece of racism that's all it that's all it helps perpetuate
i agree you know when they have him it is it's it's embarrassing it is it's embarrassing it's
demoralizing it will be like a you know a bunch of homosexuals running around limperisted
acting as camp as they could in public or or or in a in a football game for example and there are
gay football players that make coming as a great shock to some of our macho listeners but it
would be like the same thing after they score a touchdown of doing a little uh you know uh
prancing around and mincing and flipping their wrist and putting a skirt on or something i mean
you know to perpetuate of grotesque stereotypes is not the way to break down prejudice um i agree
it can i change the subject just in about 30 seconds hi just tiny bit for both of you guys here in
south mind we've got something for each of you and it sort of relates to what you just brought up
there right now uh if you've grown uh if you ever been to the sun moon it's it uh it's on the
highway sun moon on pixie high north of the Riviera uh yes i have i've been yes i have excellent
yeah i'm sorry there is there is a young lady in there oh jenna jenna visa hmm jenna visa uh huh it
might be worth i know that you don't live that all that far away right it might be worth your your
while in checking it out okay ten and and and and and niel yep uh right across the street from
there there's a place called lb zedery yeah there is a guy named Richard yeah who's just he just
coming the last couple weeks i know you're just a a watcher look where i mean there's a guy named
Richard what am i supposed to drive down there to look at him well i there i you know he's he's

incredibly good looking people i know that's uh uh even in my neighborhood twelve thirteen w i o d
twelve fifteen on your super uh whatever station and i want to tell you about a super
place for you to have lunch right now that is char-hut when you go in there they're not going to be
quorth hello hi niel hi um i didn't really know what was going on until i was running my errands
this morning is what happened in my amy and i finally got to the bank and uh i read the palm
beach post and it's i was reading the article and of course on the pall diet and uh there was a
quote by somebody by the name of david ravira and he made a quote saying that it was just
sporadic rock and bottle throwing and then right under that there was a picture of bush with
that in the soic smile on his face saying martin booter king's dream is our mission oh yeah
and i have a cute yeah no question that the ragan bush people are very heavily in due of civil
rights i mean ragan all ragan did was try to abolish the voting rights act and destroy the civil
rights commission other than that uh you know don't confuse and and made that brilliant comment
about martin luther king and communism the other day so uh no question that they're wonderful
civil libertarian i know well um to go on when i moved to florida in nineteen seventy i decided to
do something uh political uh active and i joined joined the mcdovering campaign and they
delegated a portion of port lauderdale to uh canvas which was bell harbour and not only did i
have a mcdovering sticker and my bump on my bumper i uh had to go up to doors and knock and
you know say uh would you please vote for this man i had doors slammed on me i had rocks thrown at me
and uh i ran in in bal harbour bal harbour fort lauderdale you know and then i ran into one guy who's
from the civil liberty union who is uh you know he was good and he was nice and he uh you know
macabre masonry but still it was it was just uh you know well history shows very clearly in
retrospective would have been a big improvement over rich and ill house that's uh don't confuse
the public with these things you know uh the public the plan especially now fifteen sixteen
years later it's much worse than it was then people react only to like the whole campaign i mean
you know with all these simplistic uh labels and the name calling and all of that that's all the
american public and relate to don't confuse them with the issues ready discussion of anything of
any depth all they can relate to are a lot of you know who's the most wimpish and who's the uh
card caring member of the acl you most americans don't even know what the acl you what the letters
stand for much much less anything about it you know i was really i mean your first out this is
the first time i've ever called and i really feel very strongly about what you said in your first
hour well but the the sad part of it is i feel really strongly about it too but the sad part
in one of the reasons i've given up discussing these things in his community is that it's a total
waste of time you just can't wear yourself out try to make people care about things that they don't
care about they do not care they refuse to care yeah i'm a catering Palm Beach and i really
i have to deal with uh you know uh the kind of mentality that we're always talking about and um i
just i feel very strongly about your viewpoints and your opinions about i mean wouldn't wouldn't
it be nice if the whole soft lorita area were like i'm not saying like another area in terms of
imitating somebody but in other words the demographic like like a good cross section where we had
mostly living and breathing people as opposed to mostly uh people who are you know i have one foot
in the grave and illegal aliens and people looking for a green card and uh yeah yeah this this
area they're just something totally screwed up and what's going on here this hasn't evolved like a
real place i know i know i know i have in my business i have to depend on people coming down here
for the season and then i have to put up with you know the golf games there's all the ball the
ball and they don't you know they don't want to pay you the money and it's the incredible environment
yeah i'm saying i like the climate so i'm here
yep me too okay did you say you wanted to hear the golf game no get out of here have a nice day
also yeah um i have been for San Francisco through it all but now i find out where i might not be
able to play no he's gonna play you think it's the it's the they they made the comment with you
shut up they made it made the comment yesterday which i think epitomizes america's attitude about
sports that nobody misses the super bowl and no matter how badly he's injured they will
physically drag him onto the field if they have to be so so the foot back on yeah that's right
at least for three hours anyway have a nice super bowl host weekend oh yeah we feel well
have a nice day 21 past noon at wwwd you're a super super silly a silly a situation
by the way if you don't know what we're talking about tom jicca our good friend is in the lifestyle
section of the sun sent them they just approved that we don't have this insetuous relationship
just rips the crap out of the station an entire column with a full color tom jicca picture
the first and it says wwd acts as though wishing makes it so and suggests that somehow we are
conducting a fraudulent campaign on the station to con you people into believing that we're carrying
the super bowl we are not carrying the super bowl nobody listens to the super bowl on radio to
begin with okay except for a few degenerates in truck somewhere and even says that later in the
article so why would we want to pretend that we are carrying the super bowl we would like to have it
i'm not sure why because nobody listens to it but we like to have it for the prestige and i guess
and because some of the people here are just obsessed with sports i mean to the point of just
lunacy obsessed with sport beyond it and i love sports don't get me wrong but it's just a game okay
it's not the beginning and end of the world well when i heard they were going to be carrying curling
this one we are we're going to be carrying a lot of curling a little bit indoor soccer arena footfall
little much and for all you british fans we got some what do they call another thing cricket
cricket come up this spring 22 past 12 at w i o d for lottery hello hello i've been a captive
audience of yours because my boss makes us listen to this show every day well what a boss so but
you know but he told me not to not to associate and uh himself with myself when i make these comments
okay well just say we'll just say he's a douchebag and leave it at that okay so he's a douche novel
oh there's a great line by the way and uh in that movie a tortsong trilogy and the uh kid that he adopts
harry first he adopts this kid and he comes home from school beat up and he says why did they beat you
up and he said because i called somebody a douchebag oh and there was no response from the audience
this place was packed and i guarantee if i would have stood up in the middle of that
theater last night and said hey i'm the eruders and i think all you people in sunrise are douchebag
they were sent oh yeah neo who thank god well the first comment i wanted to make was the subject
that you started in your first hour and that had to do with the disturbance of Miami yeah the disturbance
yeah yeah last night Susan Lickman had fought roy on and they asked him and i believe he was an
activist during the sixties right but now he's a member of the southern christian leadership
yeah oh yeah to uh offer some words to maybe while some of the trouble that was occurring down there
he refused to to try to to call anybody down that's perpetuating well i don't think that too many
of the people are out in the streets throwing rocks and bottles had their portable sunny tvs
with them at that point so i don't think you're ready to prevent anybody else or maybe go out
well i think Susan's living in a dream world okay that again is the case of the media trying to make
the news instead of reporting it which i okay then getting off of that and getting into something
else a couple of weeks ago a caller it said why do they have closed captioning on the southern bell
tv ads well the deaf do communicate via telecommunications devices for the deaf and so they do watch tv
and they do communicate over the telephone lines so it is it is a marketable audience
you know they don't stone uh send letters back and forth well we learned something every day
okay um another thing is uh we're talking
24 past noon at wio.d we have an open line in brow oops yeah oops to you to my friend
the 524 wio.d another one of our intellectual cars who obviously have seen too much pwe's
big top okay let me tell you about gals dream we got a really the mail is in trickles to the
this is trickle baby you know yes trickle twos federal holidays so the mail men are trickling
today and uh we just opened a letter and we had a tape in it and i thought here we go again uh it's
got well it's a tape with a comedy bit on it yeah it's called don't get sand in it i wonder what
that's about mine and uh a five hundred dollar check for committal's house i want to thank robert
in Miami he knows who it is we appreciate it very much you're a great human being and one of these
days when i get in that the room over next door see today have to go to my mother so it's another day
right and then tomorrow i've got a client to see and free up in the soap it just uh i held life you
know did you say he got lucky in the lottery you got lucky in the lotto and he sent us um oh look at
this here's another letter from orlando and it's same typewriter isn't that great isn't that
amazing that how they share the same typewriter in the same stationery from
zero and uh fort period and Sebastian and orlando and this is from the reverend again remember reverend
you're lost you know wrote to us the other day with the churches bell free oh yes during our
morning worship services we sometimes listen to you and pray for you oh yeah sure
p.s i don't want to give the name of my church because we shun publicity is the work of the devil
well that's good i only wish that some of those tv evangelists would feel the same way don't you
well thank you reverend hero you're a wonderful human being and continue your good work okay
1231 at w.i.o.d let's go to dania hello hello how are you doing today good hi um there are people in
dania who care really yes you mean there aren't just antiques in dania is that what you're trying to say
uh there are some antiques but there are also genuine people who are ready to read antique time at
nine o'clock this Saturday morning exclusively yeah right um why why do they on the news
refrain from calling it a riot well because uh there are a bunch of cowards i mean you know and of
course there's a lot of pressure on them now during the super bowl week especially there's
enormous pressure from the chamber of commerce types and a politician so don't say we're having
riots in Miami they'll be the kiss of that just just let's minimize it we just had a little
disturbance and uh you know let's go on with our life and have a big party and make everybody happy
you know okay and do the um icky wood shuffle you know well i wasn't here in eighty when there's
when the first one broke out well i will say this uh what happened here last night peeled and
duin significance thank goodness uh compared to what happened here eight years ago i mean that was
beyond description okay one of the most barbaric events in the history of this country eight years
ago and for the color who uh watch that thing about having to wear a collar was blue eyed light
crap yeah uh that is a lot of crap oh pretty good thing all all the tv talks you did that when it
was fashionable a few months ago and they brought the people on and then they admitted you know
two thirds of the way through was a hoax and they just made it up to make these people to show
you what prejudices all about i mean if people are that insecure and they have that you know
is sooner or later you have to start stop feeling sorry for people people have got to stop
being insecure if they if they don't like themselves that's their problem okay i mean i certainly
know that because i fit in several categories i can think of immediately that are too popular in
american society i don't care i don't live for other people all right and if people have a problem
that's their problem i'm not going to let it be mine and i'm not going to let it destroy my
existence right and there's no way that you can tell what discrimination is by living it for a
couple hours anyway that is correct i mean when you live your whole life then you know what it is
yep okay i don't know that i'm out of the interior listen that makes two of us have a great day
1233 at wild someone sent us the radio listings from the Palm Beach post tv book you know and this
is of course the one that has me doing Zeta connection in April's corner with April were them on
a p o m and listen to this leaf hour show three to six p m w j n o a topical talk program featuring
guests and discussions of current events with host leaf hour this week's schedule includes Tuesday

station and offer chai a practic hotline you know for you chai a practic hotline on ws br
well i can't wait for that okay i was just looking at some but we get some cramping
really weird stuff i mean i it's not good and it's not bad it just doesn't make any sense but
that's america ladies and gentlemen 1234 wild and if you're in the mood for delicious
high food right now you get in that car if you're up and browned and head for sia you know how
emotional those people 1239 21 till one at wild the neo-rodger show steve will be along he's got
open phones this afternoon from two until six apparently we think yeah well you know it's kind
of difficult they they're doing some stuff here in our mailboxes are no longer where they
used to be are all everybody stuff is on the floor yeah so it really looks great you go out in
the hallway here and uh there's just a bunch of cassettes and crap and mung and stuff on the floor
anyway we got incredible mail here today some really bizarre stuff here's one from a free port
and it's seized dear mr. roger just to know to let you know that on the island of grand
bahamas you have a large listing audience i and my fellow workers at the airport in free
free port freeway enjoy listening to you and mr. bird uh-huh your show is a refreshing break from
the local government controlled station radio zns which is comprised of 50 percent propaganda 40
percent religion and 10 percent crap nice blend oh like well that's better than a lot of stations
in this year uh-huh you're about 90 percent crap wild comes in extremely clear up until about
7 30 p.m. uh-huh i think what he probably means up until pattern changes what he's trying to say
which five thirty pages from month order is well in a couple of months it'll be seven that's right
i along with others realize that you're not particularly fond of the bahamas however much of what
you find unfavorable is true we do have problems here huh boy now here is an honest man they're
incredible almost it's almost unprecedented isn't it yeah however your show does raise the
consciousness of many here even though that is not the show's purpose that is true
it purposes for us to make money keep up the good work and keep mr. bird cackling we love him too
i'm unable to call because the long distance charges are unbelievable
and clearly melvin in free port thank you melvin great letter you're great uh
well i don't need not a great american i don't think but he's a great
western hemisphere type person right yeah something like that okay it's 1240-119-1
in our next call is in for later dale hello hi speaking about palm beach and there's
stupidity i was reading an article in the heraldan section three beads this temple condo
residents viewed over serripeite over what over serripe oh yeah i guess you've heard about that
no i kind of missed on that one they built they built this temple right next to the
century village there well that's your the total molestin and they wanted to hook into their
serripeite so they got permission to do it and now the condo association is suing them
and they've lost two cases and now they're going on to the florida supreme court
because they use 75 feet of their property in sentry village this is for their own temple
well shame on them god is going to punish them i was thinking that they've wasted so much money
and so much energy if they could have only channeled it into something that worked well like maybe
helping the depressed you know well god forbid that people should do anything productive you know
much more fun uh getting into their little you know condo associations and having verbal
fistfights or or having real fistfights over parking spaces important things like that
but i'm gonna they have so much money that they could be helping people with and they're smart i
mean they must i'm sure that they're fairly smart even though they're petty what makes you say that
why when you think that people do our smart behavior like that yeah i do no no i can do a sit-around
and think of things that they can be done well if they were if they were smart they wouldn't
have they would have something else to do besides sit-around believe me but have a nice life
it's 1242 by the way um she mentioned something about that temple so this ties in a little bit the
first films of the fifth annual Jewish film festival are being shown at the university of mimey's
bulmont cinema and i think you're going to really be impressed by the names of these films
now i'm not i'm not making a sub-radio gave this to me right off the wire okay
uh-huh university of mimey shows gefilta fish Jewish life in bialostock and jewish king lear
february 28 every two weeks through february 28 so it's on now okay good heavens now probably
somebody will get confused and they'll they'll think that i said they were serving gefilta fish
they are not serving it they're showing it as a movie it's probably like a fish called wanda
that's what i'll leave me on that's exactly uh-mimey hello yes i kneel yeah how are you today okay
good no i tuned in about an hour ago just to hear the news about the riot and to see exactly what
the end results were and as i started to listen to your callers and to your show i got well
pretty upset because in my opinion this community deserves riots and the reason i say that is we
build such fantastical rena's on the edge of overtown we build a great uh-material rail system right
through the heart of the ghetto and i have to go through the overtown questions you talk real
system that you talk real system that you're talking about cost they're federal going to
about cost they're federal going to about cost they're federal government a billion dollars to build
it would seem to me that is as much of a boondoggle as it is that it would be you know helpful to
those people who have jobs downtown or in the areas that are served by it uh-you know i don't see
it as a tremendous blight like some other things that they build and as far as building the arena
on the edge of overtown that was a very chancy thing that they did and luckily you know they
they heat with all their problems and losses of add a tremendous uh-fan support and attendance
so i don't what do you try to say what should they build should they build some slum housing
down there what what they should they be building well when you say it was a chancy thing to build
it my god they got a cheap piece of property that they could just walk in for dirt cheap and build a
blood type million dollar arenas which you we can watch a basket i don't i don't hear anybody
complaining about the fact that they built cobalt arena in downtown Detroit i don't i don't hear
people by thinking about that is that we in this community here are so constantly bothered by our
third world immigrants that we haven't taken the time to look at what the local community is
doing down here in an overtown especially yeah i heard you mentioned a little a lot of
on every street corner are our drug places that is yours that's right that's absolutely correct
i know it's correct you have a police department some stations are in overtown
how many times this community gonna have to watch a white police but shoot and unarmed at black
oh sure you know again you don't know any of the any of the details i don't want to talk to you
sir you don't know any of the details of this story right away you want to fan the flames of
all of this and tell us that we deserve riots and i'm going to tell you again for the umpteenth
time there are a lot you know the overwhelming majority of poor people in america are white okay
simply because it's a numbers game 89% of the population of this country is white or or
enormous pockets of white poverty all right it's not an answer to the problem it's not socially
acceptable to be burning down communities to be setting cars on fire to be putting innocent people's
lives in jeopardy you happen to be bystanders who have nothing to do with your grievance that's not
acceptable and when some jackass like you calls on a talk show and tries to legitimize it and suggest
that somehow this is a socially acceptable kind of behavior that we deserve because somebody built
an arena on the edge of over time that i would say to you sir that you're an asshole okay
it's 1246 at w.w.w.a. you're a super bowl super host super sillious station you believe that we deserve
riots i'm still in shock yeah just like all those kids have got killed in liberty city in
1988 deserving of kill because they were in a wrong place at the wrong time and there were a bunch
of angry people okay they were angry because we had another grievous miscarriage of justice no question
about an Arthur Mcduffee was murdered by police out of control okay murdered brutally
savagely and they all got off scot free and it was a grotesque miscarriage of justice
just like the ruling by the judge it was in in Houston or Dallas about the the murderer of the
two homosexuals Dallas Dallas yeah i don't see anybody rioting in the street i didn't see them
rioting oh wow i take that back there was rioting in san francisco and that's just as unacceptable
they were rioting and burning and carrying on like barbarians when dan white was given a slap on
the wrist and and that was just as grotesque and just to it doesn't make any difference who's doing
the rioting it's not a in a supposedly and i underlined the word supposedly civilized society
not acceptable but the problem is we're not civilized we're a bunch of barbarians who accept
violence is a routine part of life it's all around us we revel in it most people in this country won't
even go to a movie unless it's got at least you know half an hour of good violence and gore in it
they don't want to be bothered with it i mean if it's socially relevant or somehow might touch you
or inspire you or do something meaningful for forget that they want good violence they want blood
and guts and gore and decapitation and body parts because we've been conditioned to it and we
accepted like it's normal part of life it's not it's sick why do you think there's this big thing
with professional wrestling again so on you know on the one hand we like to decry a lot of things oh
it's terrible it's her right it and on the other hand we love it this is a country that can't make
up its mind well i was watching a few minutes of channel seven should try to 13th part three last
Friday we had teenagers with uh... axes in their head i'm blood burning down there no problem at all
guaranteed box office man yeah and it guarantee yeah and i'm not saying i haven't enjoyed some of
those occasionally but i mean when you have parts two through three thousand just for the purpose
of showing gratuitous violence then we got a problem somewhere everybody's all upset all about
sex we don't want to see body parts that i'm saying that's terrible okay got only you know for
bid we should see a naked person or a body genital on television because that's so dirty i mean
this is part of the pure puritanical backwardness of american society like a bunch in the inner
thoughts like the pilgrims and worse at least they had an excuse what's our excuse today we don't
have an excuse that is socially unacceptable okay but on the same tv show man if we have eight
thousand body parts and just not those particular body parts flying in every direction and blood
and guts and people shoot each other and just ripping each other's brains out and guts that's great
that's good entertainment well that's why there's some awesome family fun for uh... you know the whole
family why is this series so successful why have they made six or seven damn right because the
public sucks it up that's exactly they would don't blame the movie makers you know you know they're
strictly in it to make money or it's a business so don't go blaming the messenger blame yourself
because that it's like this thing the other day about the kids in the uniforms and i hear all these
whining limperist did the parents oh jeez well you know what our kids are close hogs well then
instilled different values in them stop waiting for somebody else to do something okay and the problem
is that you people are instilling the same warp twisted values that you've got this materialistic crap
you know i got all those uh... real nice cars and everything but you know something if i didn't
have them life would go on i mean they're nice and i can afford them and that's fine but that's not
the most important that's not what my life is all about materialism is garbage okay and unfortunately
we're going to have another eight years now probably the same kind of materialistic crap coming
from washington right from the top grab all you can get go with the gusto all of that crap
and the hell with everybody else so no question there all the world is insane or no question about
that and we certainly have grotesque injustices in his country but the answer again is not
the kind of thing that we saw last night this knee jerk reaction
and was the victim black was he white was he this was he that that's that's not the point
the point is if there's an injustice let's work to correct it
let's not go out and try to attack innocent bystanders because we're angry
twelve fifty one at w i would be if you've ever been turned i know that the lord even loves new
Rogers twelve fifty four w i would be if you think we're overreacting about the national implications
and about you know all we we've had so many nails in a coffin of this town already that i don't
know if there's room for anymore but the final ones have been a pounded in the here's us a
today which is red coast to coast okay around the world around the world front page today full color
picture of a police officers with the fires burning in the background and the headlines is
violence rattles Miami super bowl city struggles with twin crises and under our two articles
Miami cops mobilize to keep order about the disturbance last night and then the other one
bordering on refugees saturation cover story it says this city preparing for the national
scrutiny surrounding super bowl week is trying to put its best foot forward but it's been difficult
each day since december two hundred nicker rags when refugees have arrived in a heart-rend
heart rendering it says search for a new home heart rendering wonder who wrote this
but anyway so we really are doing it boy we are really doing it
see very very simple solution to the problem about refugees or illegal aliens or whatever they are
i mean these people have been processed they just they're just here yeah okay that's correct
very simple solution and that is to you know how to flee to buses
and to take them back where they came from take them back to brownsville or wherever they
cross the border and say hey this is your problem
and spread the word around that the the end is not open here there's lots there's lots of land
in between okay in between Texas and Florida i know it comes as a great shock but there's Arkansas
Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia and all these other places okay this community
just doesn't have like an endless supply of resources for refugees are they my imagination are
they obsessed with Miami this is the answer because this has been they've been catered to here
this has been the area that has you know not resisted this has been allowed to go on and on
and on we have large speaking a Spanish speaking population and you know the word is out that hey
this is a haven for you know Spanish speaking refugees so everybody come on down
and the politicians here don't have the balls to say hey we're not going to allow this
we'll just we'll just put a fence up at the border we'll do something but this just can't go on
a federal government can't keep inflicting this upon and of course not only did they inflict it
upon us but they don't pay for it they don't pick up the bill for it not a penny not a penny
you know here we are sitting raising money for the Camilo size which is a very worthy thing
that we do and I'm you know we raised almost 40 grand for but that's a drop in the bucket
these are Americans who are out there on the streets and some maniac somewhere is of the opinion
or a group of them that hey we can just we can just let everybody in the world come pouring in
here and don't worry about the consequences and we take care of everybody you see this evolution
area process in swarms of refugees during a period of industrial growth yeah understand but
we're not we don't have industrial growth now the Japanese have taken all the way from us plus
they're buying up the whole damn country okay we don't have that we're the biggest detonation in
the world where the jobs going to come from you know people don't understand the implications of
this and the pope you know who's busy smoking dope or whatever you know he don't understand the
implications of this when people continue reproducing like rabbits and there are no jobs for
these people and over 50% of the population in Mexico and a lot of these other Latin American
countries is under the age of 15 where in God's name are these people going to work who's going to
feed them so to hell with family planning or things of that all may and those are all coming to
start they naturally there's a family planning people plan parenthood and all those other horrendous
subversive organizations and God forbid birth control the more the mayor because hey send him to
Miami they'll take care of him so we get it again man we get we get more abuse in this community we
get the dumped on and the dump on ourselves it's like a it's like this community has got a death wish
you know you look at other places and i don't want to beat a dead horse but you know i talk
about going to Hawaii and how damn hard it is to get there and it takes forever and they're flourishing
man they're doing they just got more money than they know what to do with and the same with Vegas
and when you know unless you're coming from California on a freeway it takes forever to get to
Vegas for most of the populated parts of this country and they're doing a giant business
conventions and tourists and millions and billions of dollars they're taking they're exploiting
their natural advantages are we doing that no we're just busy destroying ourselves here and having
a hell of a good time doing it it is unbelievable okay April is standing by with the one o'clock

and no i wanted to talk a little bit about the thing that went on last night in the overtown
i've listened to you so many times you know and i've continued to listen to you because i enjoy
you so much but you know something new what what kicks me off is that you have a lot of young
you know i don't want to make this a black issue or color issue at all but you have a lot of
black men that come up you have some of them 15 years old they choose to put a
beep on their pocket and then they choose to go sell drugs instead of writing an essay or trying
to get a grade that improves or whatever getting a diploma in school now this is something that
hurts our neighborhood so bad yes so why is it why is it tolerator why does it go on all the time
this is this is something that that has happened and it continues to happen because we have a lot of
people that are afraid to stand up and want to say hey we would not have this anymore see see a lot of
the you know there's tremendous racism in the country i would never deny that but we got a lot of
separate issues here and to muddy them all together and lump them all together is unfair and it
doesn't do anything to you know give me any perspective on it the attitudes that exist in much of
our black community are screwed up yes they are absolutely screwed up for example the young black
women a teenager is 14 15 16 year old girls who get pregnant and then insist on having the
children because to them having a baby is this big thing i mean you know i've seen lots of programs
about this and i'm appalled by it you know 15 year olds are not parents okay you're right and
then you know we have all of these homes we keep hearing about all the homes where the the father
has left and here's the mother with all these little babies and everything what what kind of family
structure is that okay that's insanity it's craziness so you know we can keep screaming
about the you know about the the white people and how bad they are and the white cops and
about prejudice and racists that's a whole separate issue yeah you know i'm not going to get on
here like daphy mccalam used to and say all these cornball things about how black people have to
lift them up themselves up by the boots and grabs i mean that's just a condescending bunch of crap
but nonetheless if you want to get somewhere in this life man you got to change your own priorities
in your own attitude and just being a jive ass moron doesn't get the job done exactly
nil okay safe when since myself i work every day nil i have a wife i have a son we're we're
expecting another child i recently bought a house now i don't want to make myself sound like
i'm better than anybody but nil i am trying to help myself yeah and i have received help from other
people because they recognize the fact that i'm trying to help myself and i for the life of me i
can't understand why this isn't i mean other people can't seem to oh you know that i talk with
and i tell them about this i preach a very positive note to them when i do talk with them and i
try not you know like i say i try to pass on the positive note and i wish that they would heed it
and take with you know and take it into their lives but you know it just it just returns me to see
that when something happens you know you got a lot of bad people just waiting around for something
to happen a shooting death of a a controversy shooting death or whatever of a but that we still
that we still don't know very much about even now here it is it's ten after one and a half
yesterday five forty five and we still don't know all that much about it exactly and this is
what they're waiting for something like this to happen so they can come out and and and really
you know and let out all this anger and stuff or something that they didn't take the uh you know
they didn't apply themself to conducting what i should say uh uh uh proper life i should say
i mean nil it's not that hard if you want to get the things that you have to get at there's a
hard it's hard to get those things because you got to put some hard you got to put in some effort
see it takes no effort to walk around with a chip on your shoulder and be a jivast moron in a douche
bag and you know it just be a useless human being taking up space that a worthwhile person could be
taken up the skin color doesn't make any difference you know i've lived long enough that i know
in every group as corny as it sounds in every group there are the good the bad the indifferent
the in between and you know it doesn't make any difference whether they're black white or Hispanic
or angler or jews or christian whatever they are people are people okay that's a bottom line
and and just and just to constantly walk around with a chip on your shoulder like the world owes you
something i got news for your man those people can wait forever and they're never going to get
what they think somebody owes them it just isn't going to happen exactly and what another thing
the the black businesses that are in the neighborhood they have to take this garbage yeah this
is just absolute garbage you know their places have to be looted and you know and rated and all
of this stuff it's because guys selling drugs outside of your house and all of this outside of
the business or whatever this is what makes the whole neighborhood declined the neighborhood just
declines and decline and decline and and and you got i mean it's an awful frustrating situation
that you just can't really it's so many things that you have to get into and just and talk about
but it's it's just frustrating you know well i appreciate your you know you made a lot of
sense and i appreciate it okay you take in the you too okay so live and after one at wio do you
got a lot of lines open i guess he was a little bit too serious too heavy for most of this audience
but what he said made a lot of sense and was refreshingly honest yeah and if you had told me that
we would be discussing this in mid-January 1989 i would have just said no way we're going to
be discussing another disturbance in Miami that's it's impossible it's it's it's it's it's not a
disturbance it's part of the ongoing pattern of life in this town embarrassed and one of the things
that crossed my mind last night when i heard on the radio going home after i saw that movie and i
turn on the radio and i hear this and one of the first things that comes to mind is uh well how
about going to work tomorrow morning you know is there we're going to have that kind of a situation
and of course luckily it didn't get that out of hand but we have had that had to go and six
schools closed in that area today i mean just how much more of this are we going to tolerate before
the powers that be in this community say enough is enough and you know big part of the problem is
in this country we you know everybody's angry about crime okay outraged and we got all these
crime shows and uh you know the FBI shows and find this criminal and everybody's PO and vigilante
justice but nobody wants it to build any jails you know in their neighborhood or anywhere you know
within five thousand miles of where they live now unless you build prisons and put the
aberrant people away we're going to continue living in a slaughterhouse and i'll air be one of these
douchebags who's out there and i don't care how young they are or how petty it is
every one of these idiots it's out there peddling drugs ought to be in jail
it reminds me of these things where we read about the people who you know get their license to spend
at fifteen times and twenty times and you know wind up killing people and all these things that
they do in you ask how in god's name did they ever get the license back well one of the things
when forty eight hours does show on Miami a few months ago you remember that it ran on the
thursday night and one of the things the main thing i learned from that show when they went to the
courts in Miami you have to be convicted of selling drugs like five times not great before you're
going to go to jail terrific is that incredible that's a fact that's an absolute fact so how many
you know lives that they give you the opportunity to screw up before they're going to put you away
a whole bunch of mobbiusly you can screw up a whole bunch of people five times maybe even kill
a few through you know which isn't direct indirect way of murder we have an open line in
brown word five two four w i o d it's one thirteen i want to ten you'll be one seventeen at w i
would do you get a mobile in brown or hello hello hello yeah i think so i mean my name is i've
and i'm the first time caller i'm calling for my car somewhere in carol city first i think
is a great show i just moved down here from new york in uh... in july and i think it's one of the best
talk shows uh...
are there yeah i'm still here i have one of the things i want to talk about besides a situation
and over town uh... you have a situation with john tops and a george town walking out and trying
to dispute uh... these roles is proposition forty two where all they're asking these athletes to
get financial aid to get into college there's a seven hundred on your SAT scores yeah which is
basically they give you four hundred for sitting down yeah
to get a seven hundred you have to i want to i want to tell you something i have an i'm so
disgusted with collegiate athletics i'm not maybe they ought to ban all collegiate athletics for
about ten years and go back to the original purpose of uh... colleges and universities and that is
higher education that's what it's supposed to be all about not building dynasties football dynasties
and basketball dynasties what the hell is that got to do with college okay what are they all those
jox all those morons out there why don't they let him go out and play semi-probal and you know
call it what it is and pay them some bucks and you know make some kind of a like a minor league like
we used to have so many of them baseball you know before most of them disappeared what why don't they
do that and they're waiting all these scholarships and all these space that that real people want to
learn something in education uh... you know could be taken up that space if they can't meet the
requirements to get into school they shouldn't no matter how good they are that is correct
it's just a waste of everybody no matter how good an athlete they are if they're taking basket
weaving one oh two and physical ed one oh three then they have no business being in there okay exactly
thank you for the time i appreciate it and i will keep on listening okay good talking to you
goodbye one nineteen and wild we have an opening in brown bar getting really serious today aren't we
really heavy duty today boy finally got your act that lady up there who wants me to get my
together it's together baby okay at least for one day we are so serious today that it's getting
almost ponderous all right well who would have thought this day would be this way i mean yesterday
who would have dreamed that it would be this how long have you lived here yeah you're right you
haven't lived here long enough to know that at any moment's notice that this town can be a burning
inferno or just some kind of a total nut house i should get theory it's okay i should know you're right
i'm getting used to it we have an open line in bokeh which of course is part of the course they
could be burning it higher county down up there in combination two seven eight nine four six three
in bokeh raton two seven eight wild and let's go to Miami hello hello nil yeah long time Steve
listener and when you made the switch you know over to out the i just started picking up and liking
you're still right away and i like bird also great and i'll try not to uh... tinkle
and i'll try not to be so serious right okay let's let's keep it light as they say right i like
to keep it light last night as the um the wife and i were watching the news on channel seven
and at first they weren't saying what really happened right so i said to my wife i said you know
what let's hurry up and catch and bow because i know and without a new friend but um
more than anything on top of that to the um the people who who live in overtown um
and and whatever way is so unfortunate that like what you're saying they can't understand things
like the mime arena and metro rail all of the positive things the omnie that the Anglo community
has provided them in terms of getting a job and not going to let these people come in you know
he's ragan ragan's cousins and all he's going to do is slip in and take all of these jobs because
again of they prefer to side with the people who would just say oh wait let's just burn
something and not think about it yeah yeah that really solves the problem you know burned out a
bunch of your own businesses like you did back in 80 and then of course you have nowhere to go to
work you know and you put your own neighbors out of work that really accomplishes a lot and they
still haven't recovered from nineteen eight that is correct you know and um it's it's said that
is that way but in all honesty i'm really not upset because i feel better than i listen to
wld and i can understand that there are two sides there reissue and in more than it being two
sides there's a side that we can all share in you know and i'm glad that you also i'm glad that
you put pressure on that Steve came because i got a little tired of the um the Jewish debates and um
no i'll put a lot of pressure on steve man if that we told him that it brings another rabbi in here
and we're going to have another circumcision right on the spot maybe you could talk about
something else today hopefully i think you guys are pretty great okay great have a great have a great
life bye bye and now you know the rest of the story 122 at wild we have an open light in date if
you move like lightning just like a beehive of activity is in your pants at the 7519463 while
you're doing six the wild our next call is from oh you're going to pass out on the floor when you
hear this uh oh you are going to do cartwheels on a ceiling is it time for me to go to the programming
office lakeland hello nil yeah help i'm having an a radio emergency up here are you really yeah i
moved up here while we're having a radio emergency here i thought for a minute there we had a call
from lakeland well i i am calling from lakeland where you're like at the pay phone at abc liqueurs
no i'm calling from my office i just moved my company up here i know when you look out the window
can you see dog in the suds that's a question no i'm i look out my window and i see a union 76
station oh that's good well you must be able to look out and see the poke county jail too there right
yeah but the the radio up here is really really lame i've been listening to last
year now for a couple of days yeah that gives me a lame yeah yeah i mean he's got a new little
uh new line that he's using now and everybody is get off my phone you jerk that's where he got
used up all of my material now he's going to use these as by way of bob grand yeah well he got caught
using unbelievable so now he's using unreal unbelievable yeah i was wondering too i i think that a lot
of the you know like jn o gets all the radio de jacks or rejects but uh i think i think that the
television over here too and we got frank roberton and tampa and rinker up in our land oh yeah
you know that glenn glenn rinker sits on a ten foot stool to do that newscast it's amazing
he's only about two feet tall it's pretty uh interesting but the radio it really i caught part of
your show yesterday and lake whales you were coming in i guess a little bit of a skiffy
they were gonna have a florida network they were gonna have bob mayor and glenn rinker on to get
the news and breets but uh they change their mind and the radio is really lame they got a local state
well what do you expect up there it's in lakeland sir it's in yahoville it's the end of the world
yeah but i thought that the two even even in upstate in the york that i rave about the radio up
there sucks i mean the world really oh terro what a shock we have a radio swap shop here on weekends
it's really interesting well listen maybe larry can't get go to work up there you can find room for
them sometimes i can pick you up though um you know it's like a breath of fretting in lakeland
i think it's right on the head out of here or your nuts yeah every once in a while there's a
station there's a yaho's station w su n on six twenty it believes over here i know it's the
hillbilly station yeah but occasionally i can catch a skipper like around frost proof for lake whales
in the south end of pote county oh yeah oh frost proof we're big in frost proof yeah we can pick
up there every once in a while this is the only frost proof show in america so i have an outrageous
restaurant for you if you'd like me to give it to you so i'll go uh memorial boulevard oh yeah
that's for the crystal one of that the name of the restaurant now that's the street right across
from steak and shake yeah it's a restaurant called cdb oh yeah it's Italian it's Italian it's
i've been wanting to try that i've been uh well me now first week up here i was predominantly
hanging around steak and shake yeah that's understandable what you were hanging around stegging shake
yeah yeah not eating anything just kind of hanging around uh well it's like the local hangout
thank you spend too much time in my emmy sir loitering is prohibited in lakeland and punishable by dead
that's true because that you know at nighttime you should like after eight o'clock when they roll
up the sidewalks yeah and there's like free police every you know citizen
growing about the bar if you want good thing up there they have like it it's not really written anywhere
but it's just understood it's like a curfew after eight p.m. and anybody that's out on the streets
where he shot on site they don't they don't discriminate up there in lakeland man they just go around
and anybody you know it just happens to be out that bing here gone that's why the populations never
grown too much up there well they had a they had a shake up in the city council here i understand
and they got some new blood in here and they uh they got rid of the pop cocks that was in control
for a while here they're looking forward to a lot of growth in the area oh yeah
like the mosque that grows on the wires and yeah or kind of like a giant tumor on your on your
lip yeah okay well listen it's been a real education yeah i just thought i'd give you a little bit
of a last-minute report uh it's really uh ponderous now you know the uh all day on that station
over there wfla they've been uh you know discussing what happened in my emmy last night uh well guess
what we've been discussing yeah the same thing that is correct i've been listening for about 40 minutes
see i mean even though this is a an entertainment show we are totally uh like ostriches with our
head in the sand every once in a while we pull our head out just to see what's going on i want to think
about getting maybe a phone line installed from my office to your uh stations like in the house
like those old guys in sensory village every once every six months they pull their head out to see
what's going on and they look down and not much and they put it back where it belongs yeah well listen
it's right here and from you yeah well um you know i whenever i get down in the south floor i hope i
you know can listen to you have a uh missha okay say hi to all my pals at abc liquors okay
okay well okay you later and the harry burrow sends his best to okay a lot of pals at abc liquors
what day boy henry man i'm telling you got a little watch out for him wow he had a bottle of
dom that that guy brought in this morning and i got news for you boy talk about happy talk news
i mean we got refugees we got riots we got dead people shootings and drugs and everything
he offers me a drink it was not i know that's serious i'm scared
a bit of that bubbly boy i said henry is on your super silly a super bowl super host uh super
bomb station okay it's one thirty two we have an open line in palm beach you're gonna have to
really move fast to get that because they go like hot kitchen palm beach six five five nine four six
three Miami hello hello Neil how are you in hello glam yeah um calling from Miami i call
in the Palm Beach line uh real briefly first of all i hope that guy from raceland does not
put a direct line into you because he would become chronic i can tell yeah you can
you can just get that feeling that he's gonna be so desperate up there that any any touch
with although i don't know why he's calling Miami to be in touch with reality because this isn't that
really you got that right my friend anyway first of all i want you to know that you're right on
i know that you're not doing issues much but how can you avoid it once in a while now
unless you're a total uh dodo bird i mean you just you can't avoid it you can't there's nowhere to
escape it's all around us here man where you'd like we're like drowning in a sea of manure here
really it's pretty mongi listen i wanted to just bring up a point about yesterday show and i
don't mean to uh i just wanted another point if you because you know we all remember when this
movie came out and by the way i'm uh with my office people classifiers and obnoxious agnostic
and uh when the last temptation movie came out you know all the controversy that's around it
it yeah and basically uh people that want went to see it just for the sake of the art
right people might go to see twelve radio for the sake of just seeing a movie not to see the
bible on twelve radio we often was just the story is Jesus Christ something that is off limits
yeah or not and we all decided well probably it's something that in our opinion was not off
limits that you can go ahead and it's probably fantasy in the beginning anyway so what the hell
yeah well twelve radio again is just uh if we just treat it it's not a thing sir it is garbage
it's garbage it's bad is any movie you would ever want to be it's boring it's terminal it's tedious
it is monotonous it's one dimensional it is just the acting is tragic it's horrible it's bad
yeah yeah anyway just just because we see it all right now listen are you sir are you calling
an our dime or yours this is my time because i got to do a break will you hold on go right ahead
kneel you're the greatest i'll call you again when i have a shot okay bye so in other words his
dime but he's not gonna okay one thirty four w i do want to tell you the time evidently was
hard up for column any figure he would represent all right back one thirty uh comes a good friend
it says every now and then time is better to do a gratuitous thing where and now that he's not
working for cops anymore now he can really go crazy see because when he was at the mimey news he had
you know although even then i will say this he had the balls to rip the hell out of the company
and the deservedly so most of the time but uh this is you know you're gonna talk about this
this i didn't even see this you hadn't seen it see you got to start getting with it you guys
are getting up early you got to hear this show from the beginning you got to review last night's
tapes of sports dogs so you can rip into joe you gotta get with what you don't like me
what you do you know i have an eight o'clock listen to this had an eight o'clock business appointment
in term beria had breakfast with a client and got food poisoning and have been in bed ever since
that should be an omen now have you seen tortsonged trilogy no but here it's great excellent
from here it's great i'm been trying to get over that to see it i'll probably see it over the weekend
yeah go up to uh sunrise to the fox theater get every 900 year old bag in the world i know yeah
just a soul blue hair i saw the uh layer of the white worm up at the fox did you yes either white
worm probably the last night is better but anyway so you can read times the column there and
i hear the entire book here the uh book here's the fifty four what sports tell you want to see
what they were well this is a gaki man you started to get a real ask you a question about this
column joe now now tom sort of um white kind of says we're kind of perpetrating a hoax on the public
you know with this idea you know we're not kind of perpetrating a hoax where we are at whatever
never said we're carrying the game well my question is they run a promised we're carrying it we
hinted we were carrying it for what did we say we're super bowl what super hoax where you're super
bowl super hose super silliest station yeah well my question is means nothing okay i don't know
why they pay for the rights to do that okay say to runs his problem they didn't who told us that
somebody lied to us i think Roger told us that but what you're saying is old it's just what Tom
saying in his column oh no i said there's a lot of truth in what he writes but he compares it to
the channel for don't worry be happy there's no comparison i mean i grant you that promo that we
play the one that goes on for 60 seconds it has like at least a quarter of football in there you
know i mean it's love it's great hearing Rick waiver but it's like a whole quarter of football you
know i mean a 60 second promo is too long it's too long and it's on too often but it's not in the
same league is don't worry be uh moronic no that's true yeah that's true but you know what they say
it doesn't matter what you say as long as you spell my name right yeah so i know what they say what
go through round coming through round that's okay w a m what demographics they don't have any
audience i don't know what you're talking about their numbers at night hour by hour wait till
you hear these numbers q a m one thing if you can't be good be consistent i want you to listen
to the i'll give you though all the numbers from five a m till one a m okay one point four point four
so between eight p m and eleven p and they're doing this humongous number with nobody i mean
twenty five to fifty four they got uh no they got eighteen hundred people now a w i o d in the same
time would it be embarrassing if we had no now we got not we know that isn't the case we know we're
just um massive at least ten uh where are they okay sure like um uh six to eight we got a four
four and a three you know it's two hours twelve plus twenty five to fifty four you've got
uh look at this man ten thousand five hundred and sixty six hundred and they're talking like
fifty and i could bring both you know they could rent the holiday in so i wouldn't worry about it okay
now you did hear about that new talk show that's coming on at six thos in japan okay it's one forty
one forty two i'll ask you my question another day what was your question but all the one i tried
to ask about eight times you mean that one but when i tried over and over and over to ask that
question no if i we got a new and seriously we got a new gambling show from six day would Larry
king is going to be the host and he's going to be paying for all his bets with checks it's going
to be tremendous okay it's uh eighteen till two at w i o d and let's take one hand uh my m a yellow
hello nil yeah uh my name is don yeah don hello bird how are you um i'm a long time listener first
time collar and i listened to your first hour today and i thought it was probably one of the most
honest hours that i've ever heard well as town needs some more honesty we need fewer uh politicians
who are pandering the various ethnic groups we need fewer a chamber of commerce people who are
trying to you know put a sugar coated into something around this community and cover up the problems
we really have here we need honesty and we don't have it in this town well you know i'm so glad to hear
you say that because i'm in the ladies room working and uh just briefly i just want to give you a
rundown i've been down here since 1976 uh in 1976 and Miami Beach i had twenty one accounts today i
have two yeah part of that is from the Haitians coming in back in nineteen eighty eighty one
and the two accounts i have there uh as far as credit they're almost gone as far as port
waterdale which you were landbaths you were absolutely right yeah i've gone from 12 accounts down to three
and yet i go i'll tell you one thing if i were you if you want to really invest in the future if
you're going to do business on the beach and in four-later day all instead of swimwear i would think
maybe depend undergarments would be a much you know i think you're right but then i turn around i
look at Daytona Beach where they have really tried to get some of the customers in there and i've
gone from four accounts up to fourteen accounts yeah and i wonder if that's fine we're trying to drive
everybody out of here and it's just driving me nuts and nobody gets involved and uh now we've got
the nick rogwins coming in and i have nothing against nick rogwins but i turn around and i say he
doesn't make any difference sorry it doesn't make any difference who they are or where they're
coming from it just got into the point of ridiculous this community has got a limited capacity
and we just can't continue taking unlimited numbers of refugees and expecting uh somehow to find
a housing and clothing and jobs it's just again can't go on forever can't go on forever can't go on
forever and in sp- and in spite of that most of the politicians just give little lip service while
we're sending a telegram to the president we're going to do this right and they don't do anything okay
why turn around i look at some of these people who have gone out of business and i say why don't they
get involved i mean those with people who have been affected dramatically i've been affected
exactly and i tried to stay a little bit involved but the politicians down here obviously don't
get it down i remember governor bob was down there in the keys welcoming the mariel refugees as
they got off the boats bringing the criminals and the uh mental defectives out of the institutions
that castra would put in the boats with them and you know practically leading them arm in arm hand
and hand up the highway uh the south florida well i know i know what you're saying and
i'll just say this very very briefly is that you know having been the business as long as i
have used to be that maybe 75% of our business has done in south florida being Miami Miami Beach
on up the coast today it's all being done on the west coast yeah and uh it's a very frustrating thing
and you know i don't want to blame it at point but well i don't listen i don't know what they're
thinking about okay because you know as well as i do you obviously been here for a period of time
and you remember the days when this town was alive and and you you've seen the the closing of
major restaurants and you've seen like the castaways and all these other formerly great hotels that are
now uh either raised to the ground or sitting there being trying to be sold as condos for $25,000
or anything they can get i mean this town is going to hell on a hand basket nobody wants to
admit it uh that that uh astonishing sunday a few years ago when a hero woke up and got an
inspiration and on a sunday there that big front page story about all these restaurants that have
closed up in the beaches of toilet and all and then of course we hear nothing more for another 10
years nobody wants to talk about what's really happening to this town this town's got the potential
to put Vegas in Atlantic City and Hawaii it's got to put them all to sleep if we really wanted to
to exploit it and take advantage of it and instead we turned the keys of the city over to a bunch of
the andrthal redneck yahos like bob cocks and like Xavier Suarez and Steve Clark and we just let
them turn this place into a toilet well you're absolutely right and thank god you're saying something
about it over the over the radio but uh well i'm trying to get as far as much as i possibly can and
you know i'm just going nuts right now myself uh as to what's happening down here and i just hope
a lot of other people uh listen to you well just keep people on thing in mind my friend it's not
going to get any better okay i'm just going to hold it and just know i hope that it's it is true
i'm being honest with you it's not going to get any better well i'm i know you've done everything
you possibly can i've got to keep my my optimism saying that somehow a lot of people are going to get
involved in so okay all right a lot of people are getting involved it'll get a lot better okay okay
okay i told i told it's not going to happen but i'd make you happy well i'm gonna make you happy
i hope it works okay okay 147 at wiod i mean you know there those you can tell the truth or you can
tell people what they want to hear and uh he's a good guy but obviously he you can't he can't
come to grasp with reality and it is difficult to cope with the fact that you live in the midst of
so many people just don't uh they just don't care they're not interested don't you understand they
do not care you can beat him over the head with a baseball bat and they still aren't going to care
you know hold a 357 magnum to their brain they are still not going to care okay just the nature of
the people in this area they are takers they're not givers their people are waiting to die their
people are waiting to go back to wherever they came from uh it's a mess i'm reminded that when we
had the uh tense under the uh overpass that is correct i 95 you know that's sort of the same thing
that's why they called it tense city sort of the same thing today they're just in a different location
that's correct gosh but you know what they say what goes around okay it's 148 12 till two and we'll
be right back 152 at w.w.w.w. don't forget steve has open phones today am i right about that we can
confirm it oh it's uh touch and go in other words if spike doesn't fight out about it all right let's
go to a mirror mar hello oh yeah yeah i was wondering about one thing about the steel yes i can't hear
you sir you're like off in the in the distant past yeah yeah okay i was wondering about the
steel yesterday what do you think about the way the police reacted to it just letting it go on
saying that they weren't responsible for what was going on and they were without trying to stop it
what did you want them to do are you the little force that's what they're there for to protect people
well how much all of our much it takes yeah however much it takes you all you want them to shoot a
bunch more people if it got to that yes but i think if they showed a little more
that's another way to get people through rocks and bottles we have to start shooting them is that
what you're saying i'm saying they should do more than run away okay sir have a wonderful life
and i can easily see why you live in mirror mar is one of the three at wio day look at those
boards almost like bland i know we've only got about six or seven minutes but they're three
stinking calls left on here so it's obvious that we really inspired the audience to greater heights
and really uh really got the message across today right i mean not that we're going to get more than
we won't even get to three on but it's just amazing to me um Miami hello Neil how you doing okay first
time call a great show uh i've got a way if there's disturbance that breaks out tonight to quell it
we mobilize all the hookers shove them into the area they'll be so busy making love that nobody
will worry about burning a okay sir you're a great american and uh call us again in about three years
okay boy i'll tell you we're getting why do i why do i get the after the last break we should
never take another call okay i mean when things have been going relatively well and we had a few
rational people why should we ever take another call after the last you know the last four or five
minutes we should just do our closing epilogue then there's some little things on it is yeah yeah
of course it is and this would be the epilogue period and there's a couple things i wanted to hear
anyway yeah no i don't mean no no i'm not talking about songs come on now this is the epilogue though
if you want to call it that we could read from as opposed to the epidermis or the epis hour yeah oh
god well you know there what is there left to say i mean i've said it all and over and over and
i said it many times before over the last thirteen long god for second years in this town and i
passes and i i'm you know i do not delude myself into believing that i'm going to change anything because
i'm not i mean tangible things like we raised at forty thousand or close to it for camel
massage was great um it was rewarding because you know it was being used well and uh all of that
but so you can do something tangible on that order but as far as making any dramatic change in a
town like this where nobody cares you can't do it if this was a town where the people were really
involved and they were highly motivated and they were civic minded and they were activist instead of
being actively apathetic then you can do almost anything you like you know when jerry williams did
the thing in Boston with the seat belts active people but this isn't Boston this is like a place
where you don't live here you vegetate you just they hook up a machine to you and they register if
there's just a little you know like that you know the life machine where it's just beeping
oh yeah all of the calls coming in our morons so it's not worth it no i'm not taking any of these
idiots like i said last after the last break from now on we'll just handle it on our own so to speak
unless there's some brilliant call waiting right see it's just like you know yesterday i was talking
to stand about that story i saw on CNN from iceland about the plastic bags and the paper bags
that got to people in iceland foaming at the mouth they were just going that's what it would take
here if they put a tax on your plastic bag the rest of the world looks at our society with all the
violence and the shooting and the obsession with guns and all this and they think we're crazy
they think we're absolutely nuts and in in London for example if somebody gets killed with a gun
it's big it's a big story yeah and they still don't understand why most of the police there are
some that do but most of the police they're still don't carry guns don't they have something like
20 people killed a year or something i mean the number is is ridiculous it's almost not in the whole
country yeah we kill more people in a good month in date county than they kill in a whole year in
England okay yeah and uh and yet you people are conditioned into believing that this is the way
things are supposed to be and i hate to sound like i'm paraphrasing that powered be a thing in
network but that movie was loaded with truth about american society and their obsession with
television and their mindlessness and and look how much worse it's gotten since that movie came out
that was 13 years ago and now almost every other tv show is another one of these inside
story edition you know whatever the hell of names are they're all the same thing they're all tabloid
sensationalism yellow journalism because that's what the public is knee deep into man they're up
up to their ears in it that's all they want because it's tremendous escape
and i realized that a lot of things in the real world are very unpleasant but you can't escape
forever you can't you can't just put blinders on like a horse and never look around and see the
reality of the world that you're living in i mean are you see the problem in this country is we're
so juvenile we're so childish that we can't live up to coping with reality it's like these people
that are so insecure like that story about the thing you know with the blue eyes and all you know
prejudice who the hell cares you can't live your lives for what other people think you got to
stop worrying about that okay and that's the problem and we got about nine 99 and 910s percent
of the people in this country are conformists yeah they just want to do what everybody else does
how many times have i said like when fashion okay if if the women tomorrow started walking around
with burlap sacks on if some maniac designer said hey this is a new fashion i guarantee that
there'd be a fifty million women the next day who'd be out there shopping for burlap sacks
why do you people want to be reproductions yeah you want to be cloned why do you want to be
reproduced i want to be stamped like a cookie cutter just like the thing about the kids in school
with the uniform so they can all look exactly alike and be good little obedient clones of each
other that's not what life is all about life is about a little bit of individual individual thinking
and behavior be your own person anyway i think we really solved all the problems in the world today
and now tomorrow we're going to solve the problems of the medical profession in the legal
environment call up Mike segal get him on the phone okay tell him we got it like yeah finally
get your act together yeah great tomorrow we're going to go back to the doing his show okay no more
