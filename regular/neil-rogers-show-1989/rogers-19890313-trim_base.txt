by hot 105 there were one of the uh... stations that was involved in the
promotion per kayocho and steve said well i guess you're not going to be there
right
and the ten is a well i were not going to let the uh...
we're not going to let the little havana kawani and the ruin our thing we've
already planned for this and we've got a big uh... promotional investment about
about
i'll be there
yeah
he hung up on a me ripped him which was great i loved it
because you know the desire to pander to certain ethnic elements in a
community by certain radio stations one of which they are power
uh... i find embarrassing you know i mean you have to have some principal
somewhere
but by the way speaking of tv guess who came out yesterday and what a great
guy to and he's really getting the chef proof that this business is subhuman
bob weaver
oh my
came by to a lot of hollywood yesterday we've had a little chat he's just a
super guy one of my favorite people in this town you know
every time there's a telethon every time there's a charitable thing or an
auction weaver is there being the auctioneer or doing you know his bet he's
on so much for this town
for so many years when i first came down here
i mean to visit
he was here
i mean forever
and over a channel for the really give them the chef he said he's got to get up
but a quarter to three in the morning
to do that morning weather oh my
ordered a three in the morning
and of course you know how much he loves the dog track as he used to own a bunch
of racing dogs and he's really into that loves it
and that he can't get out there anyway i don't want to you know create a
thing but uh... it's really a shame because it's new guy that they've got
with a weather map on his face
uh... you know it's attempting to be a comedian and he's not he's really
horrendous and weaver has been here forever you think that after you pay
your dues
especially with the same place i realize that station changed ownership a
couple of times but even so he's been over there forever
and you think after you pay your dues
that they would show some appreciation you could have a little bit of
confidence that you can work out to your retirement and not be jerked around
you know
but they've done a real number on them over there but he's just a super guy and
i wanted to mention that was nice to see him
yeah
believe he came out so anyway tanner made a real fool out of himself on with
steve on friday and uh... kind of embarrassing but doesn't surprise me
what else
do there a whole bunch of things oh yeah there was a river phoenix movie on
yesterday on the movie channel
jimmy reared in
yeah a night in the life i didn't know what the name of it was that's a great
movie i saw it's a funny movie it is a good movie there's more to it
then most teen movies yeah
very funny movie as it is i saw not only mentioned that he's almost naked in
much of the movie and uh... even though he's getting a little bit better he
still looks i don't know there's something about that face
but from the neck down he was okay to me but uh... it was a funny moving
yeah i liked it and probably a lot of our river phoenix freaks out there
who haven't seen it will just be sitting on the edge of their seats
and
that our average is pouring through man this is going to be hell of a day i can
already feel it
these mondays now last monday was like the kiss of death of my but i can
well now we already got a few more calls and we had all last monday there's
like four lights lighting up
i'm not concerned about the phone i'm just concerned about uh... everything
else
because i could go through a major song of the answer about yesterday about
disorganization
uh... okay
i want to do a major attack on our sales department
but i do want to say that it's like um...
i mean they're great that we've got
so much business that we you know they don't know what to do with it they got
money coming in that they haven't even spent yet
which was kind of embarrassing as we had these unbelievable t-shirts
that kind of like maxed the bumper stickers and yesterday at that
appearance and they were put out on the table and somebody said to me were
charged in ten bucks a piece for them
i said well if that's the case i don't want anything to do with it okay because i
don't know anything about that
i'm not here to sell things we're here to promote and to give stuff away and sell
cars which they had a big day yesterday again
out including stew and boka by the way congratulate him and his wife they came
all the way down from boka and they drove away in a beautiful toyota
camera it was a sharp car
with burgundy white with burgundy interior god was a beautiful camera
um... but anyway so we want to give away a quantity not all that many i don't
know we have maybe fifteen or twenty of them
t-shirts
mhm good
including our friend joe with five ease
uh... who desperately wants one of your old
one of those business cards that's got the two ends he feels that that you know
it's kind of his thing that he created that if i had yeah if i had been there
would have given him one you still have some yeah i've actually he's gonna come
in wednesday not don't panic now he's not coming in our show he's bringing
Steve a poster of some weird one then yeah uh... he's coming in with me
given a couple of those out people are just amazed you know
anyway ten fourteen and w i do have a lot of other kind of things to catch up
on here uh... including our sales department i don't want to beat up on them
too bad because like i said they've been a great job that they are so incoherent
and so uh... spacey man haven't got any idea what planet they're on in fact that
we should have put our sales department in the space shuttle
because wherever it winds up in outer space they would fit out now
they would fit in immediately he knows what you're talking about me i might
can relate to it he uh... he's gone through the same well a lot longer than we have
traumatic tribulations with our sales department executives yeah
who i think i've been hanging around with Henry too long or something
yeah one way ticket out of shuttle that sounds good to be
what kind of leave them out there on the substation anyways speaking of
sub how about heading for charade they don't have any subs over the
what do you mean i'm on your own i'm on sharens in here talking about some
important heavy-duty stuff in the uran we don't have time to be on
we gotta get all this mistreatened out from this uh... disorganized bunch of
do you see i don't want to get into a bit well i do i do want to get into a big
thing because i said it before you know what they say about too many chefs spoil the
broth and we got four thousand people running around your ball got titles okay
we've got like upper level middle upper upper lower i mean
every kind of management that's ever been invented everybody works here's got a
title okay except us all the way do have business car at least i got business
car jayers are coming back again with four ends on the next but anyway it's
like just chaos i mean it just so much disorganization the right hand doesn't
know what left hand is doing and the last thing i said when i left here
friday are we gonna have all the stuff in the truck in the i would be
thing you know let's be sure because otherwise i'll take stuff with me you know
and it just um
a lot of confusion confusion and contusions
at these things and again a lot of it goes back to our space could it sales
people may not are just so hyper they need some doggy downers up there
and that into the building they really do they need some something or maybe
some of need to something because they're just so out of control they are that's
the operative word they are out of control anyway the rf is just
puking through those speakers on the ceiling again
and it's just another great monday here at wio d we're delighted you could be a
part of it okay steve today this afternoon has got and by the way i hope that
box that i brought steve yesterday the dog crate works out well with his
little his new happy i just wanted to say that on the air so everybody knows
what a swell guy and by bringing steve that crate and uh the holocaust holocaust
revisionist david mccaldon who was so extreme that the institute for
historical review which he founded kicked him out
hmm and the other guest in this contrab controversy will be mark harman
now isn't that interesting mark harman but that's with an i
jewish activist concerned about the increase in neo nazism in the us so they're
going to be going at it and uh... painting each other's foreheads with various
symbols david will be paying or mark will be painting a david said with a jewish
star and the david will be painting swastik is on the walls it ought to be a really
exciting four hours on the can show and then speaking of excitement of course
this evening at six oh five well it's too far over there for me to reach
uh... uh...
we have the car
well it's so far to reach all of
she's you think it'll be worth it well we'll find out at six oh five it sports
talk with our favorite sports jok
that's a matter of exciting and josey that it's what it is
it'll be as exciting as ever okay
so i guess we better not dwell on the other stuff because it might create some
unpleasant feeling in the building we certainly wouldn't want to offend anybody
especially our account executive
uh...
oh no because there really is sharp as a maca ball
and of course then who was uh... handling the toyota can't let know is out
there yesterday to get everybody crazy she's a wonderful human being but
uh... jay i said to work we had been there about an hour and i said this is great
this is a lot better than the first one we did out there you know and i know i
wasn't counting the people but i just looking at the
nature of the people who are showing up in other words there were people of
all ages but there seem to be like more young family type people and young
people and just living and breeding people
and it just seemed it was for me it was a lot more pleasant she's are you kidding
there's only half the people they've only sold freestinking cars about you know
whatever sales and as it turned out by the end of the day they had a super day
especially on a sunday which it was a beautiful day yesterday and people
actually go and do things family type things on sunday
but they did have a great day and she admitted that you were witness in here this
morning but in you know as the thing is going on she's giving you odd
you know about you know i was telling like what am i supposed to do and of course
we get out there we had no idea what time the
cut-ins on the log who you know the log was another story
and it just uh... it's incredible this this business it's like an ongoing i'm
almost speechless at this point i'm just starting to stutter
maybe it was from that the river phoenix movie i'm not sure and speaking of
mark harman i want to thank you first of all happy anniversary a little belated
stan and lori mager on friday celebrated their first anniversary so we wish them
the best right and stand uh... last evening brought over the
bandy the two part
what is it the limit stranger yeah which i watched again last night and after
having seen the movie i discovered two things
a i appreciated the movie that much more and be i realized how the movie really
sucked okay was really very very uh... superficial it's very superficial
and the last part which to us in florida
is more significant i mean granted he evidently killed hundreds of girls all
over the country
but the kai omega murders and the girl up in lakeland i keep forgetting her name
city in lake city what is her name i don't remember boy that
well anyway the twelve year old girl um
that was like they were running out of time
in the end of the second part of the movie so they just like
i mean everything was like on not slanting you know how not slanting is
directed we talked about that before about how they go from one scene to another
thing a real fan and that's intentional on not slanting that's just part of the
way the show is done but that's how this movie was done the um
bundy thing it was really really sucked
because they just kind of gave a lick in a smear
with this other stuff and about how he was caught in the van he had this van with
a stolen license plate and uh... and the judge coward came off like a real
yahu and there was just uh... he but he was making his
pleat closing remarks there defending himself
and the coward you know well i sent him to die in current of electrician
kimberley and leach at said right kimberley uh... so anyway twenty three past
ten of w i d this is just i'm just rambling at this point okay because i've
been such a state of shock from coming in and just like um
it's monday all right there no question about it we have a special card for
monday i want to close up for some
