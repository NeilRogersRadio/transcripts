Bill Tanner from Power.
Anyway, oh, we never ordered lunch.
Well, they're just going to bring a bunch of stuff by.
We don't want to get picky, okay?
Because at this point, we're getting really depressed.
We had a down button for the first time in ages
from a 7-3 to a 6-3.
I remember the last down book.
That's where ever been a down book?
Oh, yeah.
We went from that 9-2-5.
Oh, that's right.
You don't go up forever.
You've got to add a little bit.
But I'm looking at the WIOG-12-plus last spring,
stationed at a 3-2, and this year we got a 4-7.
So that's not chopped liver.
Oh, no, no.
Still pretty good.
But anyway, June, we got screwed in there badly
in the diaries evidently.
Either that or we're just doing a lot of things wrong.
We're going to have to have a lot of seminars and start
to re-examine, do a lot of heavy topics
and bring a lot of ministers and do stuff like that.
And here's your lander with more, even more number.
Thank you.
Here's midday again.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
He didn't make it up 07-3 to a 6-3.
Our CUNE dropped 37,000 people.
See, I don't buy that.
I think this is a June is a statistical thing.
You know what I'm saying?
Because life, look at life, 8-4 to a 10-6 in midday.
Crazy.
Incredible.
Magic from a 4-9 to a 5-5.
Now, let's see.
How did this, this is 12-plus.
How did GTR do midday?
4-1 to a 3-7.
We'll see a 4-4 to a 3-6 while a 100-3-2 to a 3-7.
Love 94-3-5 to a 2-9.
How did you delve into it in the morning?
By the way, on Love 94-12-plus.
3-0 to a 1-2-4.
Yikes.
Love to a 3-2-2-5.
Sandy went from a 3-2 to a 2-5.
Winds went from a 2-2 to a 1-8.
Hmm.
Zeta stayed flat with a 1-7.
Edgar can flat.
Consistent as the rocket you brought it.
Always.
Oh.
Let's see.
W. The motivation station showed up in midday with a 0.5.
What did QIM do in the morning in 12-plus?
We got to get that number.
We got to find that number.
They're at 0.6.
For Dick fatherly and whoever else was on part of that thing.
It's 10-49, 11-4-11 here at WI-O-D-Boy.
Really depressing.
We're going to have a morbid day.
I should have known the way they started it down.
It was going to be really, really.
It was a pall over the bill.
A morbid and depressing dropping a full point like that.
Boy, that's really desperate.
When Erie stayed about the same, he went from what I say is 6-5-9.
So he's right there, always, Mr. Consistency.
And no.
No, no, no, Gonser.
Yeah.
Who is?
That's a big word.
10-4-11 at WI-O-D and we want to talk now about.
Phyam's dog.
Okay.
Well, it's that time of the show when we start eating again.
That's another thing.
Too much of that eating on here.
No, wrongly.
Bad radio.
Let's get back to the business of more of those draft shows.
That's where it's at.
We could do the soccer draft in these hours.
We'd have like a 92-share.
Hmm.
Where's the good sound?
That's the sound of it.
We got stuffed shells, meatballs.
What is it?
Is that the cheesecake that I was talking about?
Yeah.
I'm going to talk about that wine that you're drinking.
Wait, we have this.
We had this last week.
This is incredible.
That's the heat-park front piece.
Oh, that's incredible.
That's incredible.
And Sharon keeps coming in with these insipid facts.
Oh, yeah.
It says, though, we were sorry to see that you took a slight hit in the book.
WGTR took a bigger one in another venue.
It seems that they have been dropped from radio and records as a reporter.
Right.
It says, apparently, slight press election for old music caused R&R to reassess his status.
And GTR has now considered a classic AOR.
It is.
What a bitter pill it says.
Love and Kiss and the Phantom.
Phantom informer.
Who has given us a good information, by the way.
Give us the real lowdown on Zeta when we were going on.
Bad information.
Yeah, that thing wise didn't mention that.
I haven't noticed Dennis Rees called back to apologize for all the bad information he gave us.
Oh, I remember that.
I mean five.
Well, you was like in Twilight's show.
Oh, shit.
Well, look at this guy.
He just got everything all the way down here with real plates and real, who are not used to this?
The tentals from Pizza Law.
Yeah, we were all kinds of sodas.
Yeah, I noticed.
Trust me.
Okay, it's 11.38.
And we got a mobile and Broward that I'm sure is long gone.
Hello.
Same old, same old belch and...
Yep.
That's what happens.
Bad radio.
I know.
It'll do it every time.
It's a shame because I fit into that demographic.
It's 1,500 to 5.
I'm right there.
Now, we're aiming for a little older demographic.
We want the WOLD audience.
95 plus.
I'll tell you that.
I think it's going to change.
They're going to go even higher than that.
Yeah.
Yeah, they got a special category.
They're going to put an arbitrage for Muthuzla.
Neil, you're crazy.
I can't imagine why everybody is not listening to this.
You know, if you want to brighten up your day,
you can put a smile on your face and forget the troubles of the world.
Yeah.
This is the stage.
This is it.
Oh, I know.
Well, don't worry about that.
You know, if it was the whole three trends,
I'd have been a little bit nervous.
But when it's one month, we don't worry about it.
Well, it's vacation time.
Yeah.
There's nobody here in case you have a notice.
Well, that's true.
Okay.
Have a good one.
Thank you.
5.
21 till noon at WLD.
Here's 18 to 34 midday.
Now, how come we're getting this now
and spike-wise headed an hour ago?
Remember?
Oh, yeah.
Hot had a 13.
They were flat.
GTR down sharply from a 10-8 to a 9.
The hour is 6-5 to a 7-4.
We went from a 6-1 to a 7-1.
So we went up a point in 18 to 34s in the last book.
Are you following me or are you just going to stuck your face?
Are you paying any attention?
I hear every number with the decimal point that you're going to find.
Oh, you don't.
Yes, I do.
We went up a point.
That's great.
Midday, love 94 from a 6-2 to a 4-8.
18 to 34.
Well, that's not a jam.
Zeta 4-2 to a 4.
That's 18 to 34.
How did she do it?
In midday, he asked.
Not on the second page.
Oh, they've got to be, aren't they?
They're not on...
Oh, they're there.
They're all listening to this.
Listen to this fight wise.
Uh-oh.
Ten a.m. to 3 p.m. 18 to 34.
She went from a 2-7 to a 5-7.
Good lord.
Whoa.
I wonder what they did in the morning before I heard him in the McQueen better watch it.
In those bonded 18 to 34s where they had like a deathmell.
Deathwish in the morning.
Here it is 18 to 34 GTR from a 12 to a 10.
And she from a 3 to a 4-5.
They're creeping.
Creeping ever so slowly.
Kind of like wins.
Who did make it, by the way, I know.
Probably everybody in the audience, that's what they really tuned in for today.
25 to 54 middays.
W-I-N-Z did make it.
They did make the last trend.
It shows you never depend on those trends.
They...
Oh, that's men.
That's not even the right sheet.
They had a pointy.
All right.
Isn't that good?
Great.
I'm...
I'm weird.
I just want to verify.
Just one moment please.
Much more than I expect.
QAM at a point seven on the bottom.
A motivation station at a point seven and RAC had a point seven.
W-I-N-Z beat them all with a point eight.
Isn't that good?
A point eight.
25 to 54s in midday.
We can't make puns for many.
So I don't feel so bad.
We still had a good number.
Of course, they're going to be in the upper office.
I'm telling you.
Same old party operation.
Same old party.
Same old party.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Look at that.
Well, you went crazy.
Okay.
Thanks for being here.
Oh yeah.
Of course, that could.
Anyway, it's 11-42.
At least one thing we can always eat.
Yeah.
You always said that.
No matter what we're talking about,
we're always going to be able to eat.
So we won't starve.
Long's we got a job.
For those meatballs and prebi-
Look at all that pizza.
How come the people aren't coming in to eat?
There's only three pizzas here.
Yeah, there's three pizzas.
I want one slice of that pepperoni.
It looks great.
And that's it.
And we got all these mushrooms here too.
Which I don't know why we're letting them sit there
and kind of go to waste.
No, you know.
Kind of foolish, isn't it?
Anyway, we'll get to you when we're good and ready.
Both the bokeh and the pomegranate are open,
which I guess is kind of a, um,
ties right in.
Yeah.
With everything else that's going on here today, doesn't it?
Why don't you take a pizza, Andy?
Yeah, why don't you take one of the fries?
We're going to be great.
Like, take a pizza.
Oh, it's like, take two of them.
Leave that one there, because I like the looks of that one.
Just take these two.
Go nuts.
And go crazy with them.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
And then you can just take a look at the food.
Okay, let's look at that.
The Palm Beach lines are going.
And everybody's having a nice day.
And everybody's having a nice day.
Everybody get out of here.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
I feel.
Yeah.
I think I know where you had to drop on your radio.
Okay, let's analyze this now, Sir.
We have to leave our rear wheel.
We have to leave our rear wheel.
We have to leave our rear wheel.
We have to leave our rear wheel.
He could have been the one that knocked you all down.
Yeah.
No?
Probably.
Probably.
Whatever you say sir. Let me ask another question. If you eat that's bad radio, right?
Mm-hmm. How about if they eat you?
I don't know radio. That's even worse. That's even worse?
Then you get a memo, right? Yeah. Okay. Well I want to call somebody
bill the electrician that may or the douchebag. Mm-hmm. And that's about it.
Okay sir. All right. See ya.
Sixteen-tailed noon at WIOD. What did you just do?
Oh well thank you so much. Isn't that cute? Or scratching stuff off and chasing
changing stuff around and it's just bizarre. Anyway we got like four three four
stick and calls on the board. I don't know what's happening with the phone. It's
going nuts and nuts. The same time that everybody came in and disrupted the show.
Mm-hmm. And I'm just lost. Me too. But you know something I'm eating here and I don't
really give a plan. I'm having a great time. Food is wonderful. I couldn't give a damn
less. Oh here have some of these mushrooms. Because I know you're like those before they
all come in and start going crazy here. Yeah. Anyway it's quarter to
noon at WIOD. Steve today's got open phones. Thank God for that. Hank Goldberg on
sports talk tonight. Hank is going to be eating during sports talk. We got the
Yankees in a white sauce today to talk and then of course after the ball game we
got what's the question which I can't wait. How did we do it tonight? We went up at
night. Yeah. Well there you go. I don't know I got too many sheets here. I got just
tons and tons of stuff. They went from a two seven to a four two or something
like that at night and twelve plus. Isn't that great? We're really doing it seven
a midnight. Boy in a weekend. This station I told you we need bumper stickers that say
the weekends are deadly at WIOD. We had one five on the weekend. The whole station
that's Saturday and Sunday at one five. That's like almost Zato like. In fact I bet
today beat us. Would that be in fair or less? No I bet today. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. I mean
when you got a one five anywhere you know everybody in the world here it is weekend twelve
plus. Hot hot like number one in almost every category everywhere. Winds had a three
on a weekend. I. O. D. Oh I'm sorry it was a two three. I apologize wasn't that bad.
No Azeta had a two. I told you not to over read WS news had a two two but it is Zato
like. Which Debbie Ellis is going to be wearing during her show which he moves to mid
days going to be wearing that two two. Well we do have some big competition coming
on. We got a call from Maryland. Hello. Hello. What are you doing? All right. How are you?
Oh we're great. How was your vacation? Terrific. I'm going back tomorrow. Where did you
go anyhow? I know you're in Europe. What's the Amsterdam and Rome? Wow. Yeah. See
that. Hey, it is and I talked to bird last week. I just moved out of the sewer area.
I feared a house tomorrow. Really? Yeah. Well how do you present? Oh yeah this three out
of the good call from this guy. He's okay. Yeah. You remember I told you it was a good
call remember? That's right. Yeah. We were shocked and out of town called it actually
the guy had something to say. Yeah. I'm finding my way around this place that's a band
turned me under that radio station. That's pretty good. Nothing like you guys. To what
station? B. A. M. Oh yeah. Stand was here. Alan Brown right? Oh yeah. Fair. You know
I know of him. Yeah. Anyhow. We. We. We. And then literally I went down to the
separately that he told me to go to and that's by faith. Was it good? Yeah. Yeah. What
happened? And this is uh. Yeah. Very. Baltimore? Yeah. Can't stand it. But then
the radio was a hot. Yeah. That's true. By the way Ed Kaplan on Q. A. M. What's that?
Ed Kaplan on WQ. A. M. on Friday morning on his tape thing that he plays on callershow
said that because the orals had lost the night before and he said well any day now the
orals will be out of first place. They're now seven and a half games ahead. Okay. So
Ed you're a nice guy but you know nothing. This is a little message for Ed Kaplan. Okay.
Okay. I'll let him know. Anyhow. Hey bird. Have you heard from him?
Hitch. Hitch. The guy I was saying about Ed's and his car. He's going to have you over
there to Ocasilvich. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I think so. Great person. I'd like to say hi
to him and call him and send my juice bag. Okay. I'll have a wonderful life. Okay guys. Good
and good luck you up there because you're going to need it. I'm going to he potentials reality by calling
you out once a week. Okay. No problem. All right guys. See ya. Bye. Oh. What a call. 11
till June. That's your idea of a great call. That will he's got a big call. He's a
just family. He was good. He wasn't great today at all. He was good with how did
it stand to in his book. Anyway, it's time to talk about pizza law right now. It couldn't be
a better time because we're sitting here with our mouth full of pizza law stuff. Yeah. Like he's
great meatballs with a stuffed shells and fantastic pepperoni pizza over there which I'm going to dig
into as soon as we get into the rest of the break and the mushrooms with cheese which are great.
The big mushrooms. One lasagna and they've got fantastic spaghetti and that great pugazza pizza
that layered pizza with a real spicy sauce and the thin onions and all like good stuff inside of
it like a triple decker and Sicilian pan pizza and calzones and the you name it they got it along
with all kinds of unique and different toppings some of which will scare the daylights out of you.
Okay. They really do a great job. Everything is fresh. It's delicious and the price is right. They
even deliver and when they deliver to you if you're a real slipper you can even use your credit
cars and the pay for it. How do you like that? Pizza law they're upstairs at 69th Avenue in West
Flaglissery just east of the Palmetto and we thank Jeff and the gang over there for putting together
an incredible spread today. The staff is just going to... Did you have any dessert by the way yet?
Yeah. Oh you got your... Oh we got ours over here. I started panic a little bit because I know
did you get me or a diminishing rapid. Oh yeah. Credible cheesecake. They're death-wrought by.
Anyway you stop by for a great lunch or dinner anytime to the pizza law.
You know what they do is they put it in a bottle and they put it in this game bay and we got an
advantage because we're right on the water back here. So your land that goes back in with a fish net
and gets scooped it out of the bay. He's got real bitter death. Okay well that's it. Okay.
Bye. See ya. What a call huh. Miami hello. Hey you hung up on me. What do you mean by that?
I did what? I didn't hang up on anybody. Well we're sorry. I'll never do it again.
No. Yeah. Is this heal? Yeah. Is it heal? Oh it's not? What's happening here? This is
going down but you're listening go up because I listen to you all the time and I can't
like you know everybody because I'm a hero. Great hero. What is it? What kind of a piece
are you having over there to have new? It's called a high mionkle pizza. Well we've had a
piece of style pizza just a regular style. It's from W.I.N.V. Oh you don't want to be eating
any of that now. You get to be careful. You got to get yourself to make you are. In fact
the auntie there's a little bitter pill on his slice. And you know what I did here that Bill
can't have calling you with their numbers now. How they have to get their numbers before you got
their numbers. Because he's the guy that makes them up. I got shocked when I heard that. I want to know.
Yeah. Anyway he's been a long time since I see you at from you know when he used to work over
there that other radio stations of the I and Z you still look the same. Yeah. All right then
why don't you fat enough to tell you no matter what anybody tell you about you going down.
Let me tell you they all wrong. You're going up. I'm listening to you right now. Okay.
Lee right. Okay. Peace to everybody. Listen and you're right. Just get down. You're
walking at loose now. Whoa man. I told you that station was just for people on drugs.
No certainly you got to be on drugs to your hot 105. Yeah. That's it. That's it.
And it's like between them and life. It's like the two extremes of the spectrum. Yeah.
It's for people who are just beyond the cradle on the one hand and people who are
have got a foot and a half in the grave on the other hand. It's true. But anyway we're just going to
boycott this whole book. Really right. We're going to make up a lot of excuses and a lot of
alibi. We did pretty damn good. Okay. They should kiss the ground or doing a six free here in midday.
Oh yeah. Well it's no point. No.
Paul I'll beat that. Yeah. I think those bumper stickers are probably what got us over the top.
Don't you? They are beautiful. We got a promotion department here that Albert Einstein would
be. We know how to promote the department. Don't we? No.
Those t-shirts I like to like everything is like plain white and blue you know what I'm saying?
Like real boring looking. It's real dynamic. It's kind of like a reflection of our general
managers and a real dynamic like a dead toad. Anyway it's 1157 a WIOD here's plantation. Hello.
Yeah. Neil how you doing? Welcome back. Yeah. I didn't get to you before you left.
The day that you were at the Hollywood Toyota. I had an I'm a lot in plantation too and I had to pass
by where Y100 was and there wasn't two people there. No not Y100. Yeah. Y100. No Zeta.
No but Y100 also were out there. Oh they also had one where? I don't know. They were at the
Dodge Place on University. The Dodge Place. The Dodge Place.
Between Sterling and the
between Sterling and the
between the Hard Place. Between Griffin and Sterling on the
on the University. Nobody there. And there was nobody there and that was in five minutes later
I was over there as to you. Well maybe if Super Dave would have been here they would have had a
big crowd. I have no life. Yeah not anymore. I'll tell you that's that's still in the morning
on Y100 is Firmable. I already hit he could listen to it. Well they got a lot of them. I'll tell you
that they're just going through the roof. They went from a from whatever the holiday went. I don't
know. What did they do in 18 to 34? They just estimated they went from a 7-6 to a 6-1.
Well your old pads would be the one for you. Yeah evidently that must be where their whole
audience is is in pre-pube-best and pig maze I guess they must have all of them. That's mental
pig maze. Exactly. Well everybody's out of town anyway I'm vacation you know it's the
biggest vacation. Now we got a real screwing I'm going to say it right now because I've always said
this over the years it's it's almost like picking them out of a head if you do well over a long
period of time and you obviously got something going but in any given bookman these these samples
are so incredible that it just almost makes you speechless. That's a bad radio. Henry's having a good time.
Well Raven's party. Yeah see Henry celebrates upbooks he celebrates
and he celebrates flatbooks too. And he's getting ready to celebrate the dolphin book this fall
two now so. Well listen have a great day. Yeah have a good one. See ya.
Fallet. Well listen that's so going to do it. Who we got the Chuck uh yeah Myers.
Myers going to have the news of noon and then we'll come back in 12.05. Steve has open phones
this afternoon and you can call it and grill him and ask him for his allies and why he went
down from a 470 or 411 and the 25 to 54 as well we just got screwed right isn't that the company
best in history. What does it call out it's um he parked crunching. God is that good.
What a good way to go out you know. Okay here we got some 18 to 49 man we got everything here
why even bother getting the book we got everything that's ever been invented we got men 18 to 34
a lot of you can see this yet look at this. Men 18 to 34 midday we went from a 970 to an 113.
Oh so our audience is just getting younger that's a good excuse we're just getting younger
pretty soon we're going to put that stick in Y 100 off the mat right. So you get all those 10
year old pinheads hot hot finally went down in something they went down near midday men 18 to 34
11 9 to 11 3 and GTR from a 15 6 to a 13 1 but still number one in many 18 to 34 midday how do
him and McQueen do in the morning wash your hope they took a bath took a dive you know.
Don't you feel the same way. I'm not saying anything. I don't think I have it.
I can't imagine she's been coming in here back in fourth and back in boomers for hours and I
can't believe I wouldn't have one thing. Here's the men 18 to 34 6 to 10 am hot had a 15.9 it's
up over four point and GTR went from a 17.2 to a 14.9 a drop of over two point in that very very
important man 18 to 34 demographic in the morning. If I were hermene McQueen I'd start looking
there's an opening in Tampa. 1209 at WIOD and I've been putting this off as long as I could but
sooner or later. I knew hi bird. I have no life. I thought that fit right into this call. It's
Robin ladies and gentlemen. Glad to hear that you're back me old. Yeah bet. Yeah really I'm
glad to hear hi bird. Hi Robin. How you doing? Great. Good. Well we've been better.
Well hey listen you guys are number one you know your number one. No we're not number one. We're
not number one. We're like 82 hours something. I don't know. Go fix. You can't Robin.
You can't say that. Yeah you can say it in your house.
Oh my boy. She's there. I had a dump there. She never fails to disappoint me. What a sicko huh?
Boy you sure it's really is great coming back inheriting all of these
McGaggies that you put together. 18 to 49 here we go in the morning six to 10 am Mike
Rinerie head from a 4.7 to a 4.8. So we finally found somewhere where something and somebody
on his station went up a little bit. Yeah. Look at that probation for oh she said it doesn't have
anything to do with the newsroom. It's an outside matter. I see. Okay those two getting pretty
chummy in there aren't they Miami? Hello. Yeah. Welcome back. Thank you so much.
Bird did a great job in your absence. No question about it. Nice changes pace. Yeah.
You have a nice trip. Great. How glad. Well that's good. Happy to be back. Yeah up until this call
I was ecstatic. I've been told this call. First of all I see. Well I mean at
tone in your voice there's like a certain level of sarcasm there isn't there. No no I have to
be not ecstatic. A little sarcasm in this call sir. No not at all. I sustained some permanent hearing
loss when Steve got on the phone. Oh he talks very loud. Yeah. He does. He hangs out with
Lee Fowler a lot. Kind of rubs off so to speak. I don't want our guest downstairs to get the wrong
idea Roy Masters when I said it kind of rubs off. He gets real nervous when he uses an expression
like that. So what's up sir. I just have a feeling that bubbling under the surface of this
call or something that doesn't know. No absolutely not. No. No I was just caught off guard
snapping. Oh. Was the. Are you want to go back on hold? No. Oh. As a matter of fact there is a point
of information. How do you get on the lightning round without being kept on hold? You just call
in and if you get a ring you'll get on. Okay. Very. Can you say hello? Hello and hang up on it.
Oh very. You're repeated to Dion. Were you back in town Saturday? Yeah. You were. Did you
relisten to the Dion show? No. No. When I'm on vacation I don't I don't get involved with this place.
It was a great show. Yeah. Too bad they didn't play the tapes in the right order. Yeah but I've
never listened to a single radio program twice and it was actually worth. Yeah Dion is great.
Now that was a great show. No mistake. It was a great show. What about the cops?
Like you said. I think your right by hearing has been affected since Steve was in here.
Yeah up until this call. It looks in there only three and a half games out there going through a
little problem you know it's called Lacka Runs. They're tied with a knife. Yeah. There you go.
Montreal is going to take the good. Can I read you this thing out of this? Yeah. Well listen have a great day.
Take care. Okay son. What was his story? Man use a live squirrel as windshield wimper. You get the
feeling of something under that well what's wrong with that? He was using the tail. I can't
visualize that what it was. Yeah. The fur was flying when eagle light police arrested a motorist
for an unusual offense driving down the street with a live squirrel tied to his windshield wimper.
What's wrong with that? Ashford, Massachusetts they charged 49 year old John Griffith with
unlawful possession of a bushy tailed rodent. He just he was described as a loner who lives at
a local campsite. He was irate and combative when officers pulled him over. He told the cops
that the squirrel always accompanied him because he was his friend. Yeah. Police report that the
squirrel who was tied to the wiper by an island. He was probably enjoying it. Was frightened but not
hurt by the unusual auto trip. I gotta remember that. He said it was nothing compared to how when
he puts him into watch the laundry and the dryer. One 19 at WIOD let's take a call from these calls
today. I'm going to be honest with you boy. This has been real real eye opener for me all the way
with his Monday. And we never gave the numbers out and they're all filled up which is a big deal I
guess in his business. My Emmy. Hello. Hi. Hi. You're Neil. Yeah. How you doing? Joy.
Hey. It's been a boring two week through the algebra. I'm going to throw you a good job. It's not the same.
I know. Hey, I have a first request and then I want you to come from a rumor for me.
Requester you can play a young Neil or freeway in spiket today. No. Okay. Catch you later on that man.
Somebody said that Neil is black. Is that true? Who? Another Neely. He says I swear to God,
Neil is black. I said no. He's not. Yeah. Neil is black. He doesn't sound black. Why are you talking to me
and you're talking like you you're talking in the first person and now you're switching in the third
person. Is there a special reason for that? No, because a good friend of mine told me that Neil is black.
I heard the same thing. Yeah. Not in the up sorry Nick. Oh, Nick. Yeah. What?
You're right about these calls. Wow. Oh, right. I should have kept telling my story about the plane trip
back and about the Lebanese woman with the baby and the diaper. I should have continued on that story.
These calls just stopped. 21 past one at WIOD. Lauder Hill. Hello. Hello. Yes.
Hi Neil. I'm so glad you're back. I can't stop laughing. Really? I can't stop crying.
You're absolutely wonderful. You know, those days especially at Amsterdam, I'd be sitting in my hotel room
and I'd look out the window and it would be bitter cold and raining. Amsterdam is nice when the sun is
shining and gets up to about 72. It never really gets hot there. But when it's raining, it gets real
dark like up north. You know, when it rains and it gets cloudy all day and gray and it's bitter and
I'd sit in that hotel room and I'd look outside. I think even though I can't go out walking or doing
anything, it's just so nice being here and just being free. It's like a bird. You know what?
If I can use that expression. Like total escape. And I would sit back down and turn on the TV and
there would be Larry King and then I'd think, well, maybe I'm not so free after all. Well, now
you're back to reality. Yeah. Part of your wake up. I just wanted to say that bird did an excellent job
while you were gone. Well, we're going to take a four hour pull on it tomorrow.
The last time you were gone, he wasn't so great. But this time I don't think he was as nervous and
he was nervous. Yeah, last time I went, he was terrible. You were a sister. Sorry,
bird. I love you, but sorry. Anyway, that you were so bad that the only day that wasn't good
with that bathing suit contest was Stan. I can't believe you did that. I really can't because when
Stan, when Stan did that on INZ, I ripped him for days. It was so bad and embarrassing. But you
guys get away with murder. It was. And I have one thing to say about Steve. This is an arrest.
This is an arrest. I just have one thing to say about Steve. You know, he said how you read your
audience into Stan wrong. I would never take credit if that were you. Stan's audience was really
bad. Those were not nearly people. Well, he had there was something there was some crossover,
but no question Stan did have his own special group. I mean, floor mat. I mean, you know,
he had those people that just, you know, he didn't he never had a show. He never had a show.
He really did. I'm sorry. Well, at least he's consistent because he don't have a show now.
He is. So, you know, there's something to be said for consistency. I have to tell you
something when he was on that day, I had turned it on about, I don't know, 11 o'clock, 11
30 in the morning. I got in the car and I turned it on. And for a minute, I thought it was you.
It was just it was just the way it came on and the way happened to be listening to it. Yeah,
Stan, I sound a lot of like. I know Neil's not back because of the new day and he
rolled back to like three. And when he started with that business and all of a sudden, I heard
that about Ricky Tickies, you know, lingerie and bathing suit and I know Ricky. Ricky Tickies,
lingerie. Well, there must be something going on. I don't know about. I knew about the cat,
but I didn't know about the lingerie. Well, anyway, it's been fun. Okay, listen, have a great day
and I'll say hi to Stan for you. No, thank you. Okay. Wow. Boy, they're just ripping the crap out
of everybody today, aren't they? 24 past one at WIOD. I think we're going to do a little break here
and we got the boy, we got the lighting run. This is basically overall, this is great. So,
all right, and you go on vacation, which is going to really be something. Yeah. Now, you're just,
you're just not going to show up Friday, right? You're not going to tell anybody about that.
That's correct. That's, that's the best way. Because you had a little run-in with Boy Geary who
said that you can't take that extra day. I know. And you said you're just going to go ahead and
take it anyway and you said, well, just don't tell anybody. Yeah. That's what he said. I said,
so we're not going to tell anybody about it. He just won't show up on Friday. He won't be here. Okay,
but whatever you do, don't tell anybody and we'll just pretend, you know, it's one of the, like,
he's sick. So I'll make up a story like you're under the weather. How do you guys do it? Oh,
you guys take that extra day. How do you guys do it? Because we're talent. Oh, oh, we'll see.
They didn't tell me that. 25 at WIOD and we'll be right back. Good morning. I'm Henry Barrow in the
six. I have to do whatever you want. I have a great time. Excellent. We talk about the CUB. Yeah.
I won't think anything just like you. I won't think about the stage. Yeah. I'm specifically going
to go where I can't hear it. Excellent. And you guys, you can do anything. By the way, I just want
to mention the WIOD newsletter. I'm going to throw that out. Wow. Oh, geez. There's a new newsletter
out while I was on vacation. Here it is. And wouldn't you know, we barely get any mention. It does
mention you were going to be filling in for me. Yeah. You only mentioned this. I didn't get one.
And see, I don't even get a clot. Listen to this. The 610 WIOD sports crew presented another great
show for our audience on the recent NBA draft. It's Eric come a row.
Sonny Hersh and Jim Manage provided pick by pick coverage. I wonder if they mean this.
And the hang goldberg got the crowd reaction and official comments from the heat draft party at
the mighty arena while Tony Yip, Marvin Raw man and Eric Martinez provided the
produced the program. Keep it all. I can't even read this. I'm so tongue tied. It's so exciting.
Keeping it all sounding great was Steve Ziegler because I'm in the second page. Yeah. Oh yeah.
The radio at its finest. It does mention my name. That's a first. I don't forget the
British cricket draft is coming up on Sunday and we're going to have Rick Weaver in Scotland.
Man, I tried watching cricket for like five minutes on the BBC over there. How can they,
how can you watch it? It is so ridiculous. One thing I've decided about the British. The reason
they always they lose every war and we have to bail them out or they lost the revolution.
Because they're silly. They're like silly people. Very silly. In fact, in Amsterdam,
you know, they're people from all over the world there. It's incredible. And the only people
that were really rowdy and loud and obnoxious, everywhere you went were the British kids.
Really? Drunk, loud, obnoxious, disgusting. All of them. I mean, they were just disgusting.
Out in the streets and restaurants everywhere you went, they were the only ones who just
out of control. And when you stop at thing, I bet you that Roy Masters would probably have
some comments on this. So seriously, in a country where they worship a queen, I'm telling you,
there's just it's just a little peculiar, okay? And all the, well, I won't say it all, but most
of the British men are like, fake, like, fay Wayne or fay Dunnoway. They're all a little
fay. In fact, even the Dutch guys on the plane coming back, there was this Dutch family,
husband and wife and two, the two, naughty little girls I was talking about. And the life was so
butch man, she looked like she could put you through the four with her foot. And a husband
looked just like, what's the queen's husband? What is his name? Prince Philip. Prince Philip.
Is that his name? He looked just like him. And at same kind of very wimpy, ineffectual, you know what I mean?
They've always been that way, don't you think? Yeah. Always been that way. Very strange.
If you look at all British movies, 30s, 40s, they're all the same. You know, they are.
I lost an old movie. So maybe Roy Masters can kind of penalize that for us on the King's show.
Okay, it's 132 at WIOD. Let's go to senior. Hello. Get off the quick. Let's go to a plantation. Hello.
Neil. Yeah. What? Hold on. Let's try Boka. Hello.
Okay. Good. I forgot about this beginning of that desperate time of the show. It is that time.
Miami. Hello. Hello. Neil. Are you holding? Yes. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Hi Neil. I just want to say
welcome back. Got you a little confused there. Yeah. That's all right. We're confused too.
I just want to say welcome back and tell you that the bird did a good job. He was pretty good.
Well, we're taking a five-part poll on it starting tomorrow. Well, this guy is incredible though.
He's a little, he just freaks for Boka George. You know. He just has us, how does and,
yeah, and easy circumstances here. You know, we kind of shaky gave us a heart attack,
sort of speed. Really? Yeah, but the guy is, he's all right, but I don't know about him. He was not nervous
when he was talking this time. He was a little, you know. I don't know. I don't see like I'm
right. I should be, you know, like, you know. Yeah. Anyway, look, he, I don't know what he did with
your cards, but at one time he was, he was really quite crazy with those things. He was playing him
back and forth. He was complaining a little bit because obviously you have him in some sort of water.
Well, he was fine. He's got him all in alphabetical order now. It's really great. I can't find a thing.
But no, the show was, it was great. He did a good job, except for that time we had all those
half-naked women and of course, half-naked women. Well, that's what he said. Well, that's good.
Next week we're going to have a bunch of hot naked guys in here. It's going to be great.
All right. I have a couple of friends that be interested in me. I'm sure you do.
Okay, Neil. Have a good day. Okay. See you.
134 W.I.N.C. We're getting ready now. Are you holding?
Okay. See, I'm getting psyched now. I know which ones are holding for the lighting round.
And that lady was holding most of them. Bokka is open. So let's do a little break and then when we
come back, it'll almost be that time, right? In fact, it'll probably be that time because it's the
shell spot. You know how long this is. It seems that after two years of telling everybody,
I don't want to read this copy. This is that same awful copy. And the essence of it is that a lot
of people think that it shows that you give your paper plates and plastic forks and spoons like we
in here with everything. Yeah, because it's so inexpensive. Do you remember somebody came in one
day and they brought us China? Oh, we didn't know how to act. I don't remember, but we didn't know
how we didn't know what to do. That was incredible. I mean, we're not complaining because you know,
we don't have people there to wash the dishes. All of we got, how about your land?
He's got a lot of time. She's got a lot of time. I'm sure she's got plenty of experience.
She could go down there kind of like during the noon hours. She could wash the dishes and we could
have real silver and plates and stuff. Sure should be thrilled. Of course she would.
Firstly, if it had WIOD, like embroidered on the thinner, anyway, shells uses real silverware.
She took away abortion and homosexual this and homosexual land.
Be pretty slim-picking wouldn't it? 23 till 2 at WIOD and
let's see, West Palm, you're holding for lightning round? No. Oh, you're holding for us.
You're first. Great. How you doing? What a call. Yeah. Nice talking to you.
I had a radio option last week. I was listening to wind and I heard the one, huh?
Yeah, I was one. I heard the sportscaster, this was Ron Harrison with saying,
was talking about how Ron Gittery had been in doored 15-manageral changes with the near Yankees.
He said, both kind of like being in a radio business, maybe a good station even will,
and any kind of pregnant positive moved on. Like to hear a short term like that.
Yeah. Well, he was trying to come over here a long time ago and just didn't work out.
Well, he did a great job well. I'm going to take back and kneel and grab the hand of his ass.
Thank you. Take care. See you. Bye-bye. Now, who's this on the bat line? Is that for us?
Is he talking to somebody on the air? What?
He's still talking to him. That exciting. There's somebody on the bat line.
Nobody called him with the name of that movie. And you know why? Because most people don't have
viewers' choice so they don't they don't know what I'm talking about. Well, you give so many clues.
But when you do, you know, you always tune in the middle.
Anybody who saw it. No, I've seen it twice. Anybody who saw it with no one I'm talking about.
Oh, okay. It's about this young guy and his girlfriend. And she's plotting.
In fact, he gets involved with this. I don't know if it's her mother or this older woman. And he's
involved with both of them. And both of them are plotting with this woman's husband to kill him
and collect his insurance money and pretend that it's the husband who dies.
Oh, I see. And it's all out in the snow. They're out in a shed somewhere in a shack. I don't know.
And it's incredible. It's bizarre. It seems like all the movies that I see on these pay-per-view
channels are all really strange, weird. What was that one I was telling you about before I went
away? He's put me in a darkness. Another bizarre movie. Miami, hello.
Hey, Neil. Yeah. I was in the panhandle all last weekend. We had a rock station up in
Bainby, Georgia and a rock station mobile. All of them are playing the crap out of that neon out.
Great. Got to get these ones like one mobile. They're doing like power rotation or whatever you
call it. Here at least once an hour. Good. And I was listening. I got back Saturday morning. I
put your, you know, the best needle out. And I heard the second and the fourth hours
were the same tape. I couldn't believe it. They finally got D on. He was on the first hour and he
came back in the third. Wait a minute. The second and the fourth hour were the same tape. Oh,
same thing. Good thing. We got running the board on a weekend here, man. It's like a disaster.
I don't know. He was, I don't want to get anybody in trouble. But wouldn't it be nice if they
gave these people a little training? Yeah, it was sure helpful. I was driving through Milton.
I think I saw Cap Dave stand on the corner with his side. With his thumb out, yeah.
Well, you're science. The only proof. I still love those new billboards. There's with the,
you know, the call letters on the tombstone. That's my favorite. I should tell you something.
Yeah. Okay. You can hold for light. Sure. No problem. Okay.
140 at WIOD for Lauderdale. Hello. I'm holding. You're holding? Yes, sir. Okay. So it's
squeezed too tight now. Would you mind tapping for me? Let's go to Miramar. Hello. Hello. Yeah.
Also, you know that movie you were talking about? Yeah. I think I'm not sure about it. Isn't it
called the No People or something? No. No. I'll think of one. It just came out. It came out a couple
months ago. I don't know. It's called Ice People. No. Can I hold for light, Ram? Sure. Okay.
You're going to be okay? Yeah. All right. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yeah.
Hi. Welcome back. Thank you. Hi, Bird. That was a good week you had there. I enjoyed it. Why is
it such a bad connection? I don't know. Neil, because I'm calling long distance. Listen. Where are you?
I'm a really enbrouwer. I'm a first time call. Oh, a brow. Well, I'd explain to you. Well, now,
you're a brow or two. You live there. But I'm listening. Neil, I had a human interest story written to
me on Father's Day and mentioned beyond in there. Theon picked up the article and he called me. And we
discussed the show that he was on your show. And we discussed how he just couldn't believe on an AM
show that you know, I have to be in on that show that, you know, visiting with you guys and doing
an AM show, talking about the record three, four days later. It's people from Amrister Records.
I'm not mistaken. Arista. Arista. Amrister. Yeah. Right. Okay. He couldn't believe it. That's what's
happening down there. Theon and plantation and Boca and South. They boom. Things are taken off. Yeah.
Just boy, I got to tell Neil when I get a chance that that show was just unbelievable. The record
is just when skyrocketing. Great. And eventually probably will get to you. No, he did tell us that. Yeah,
he can't buy toilet of Hollywood and told us. Oh, did he really? Yeah. Because I had a conversation
with him. He's nice and sky evolve. Yes, he is. Yeah. They had an article about me. Well,
as as a Father's Day, I guess they made me father of the year down here. Great. And and theon
picked up on it and and he just the nicest guy just called me and spoke to me for 25 minutes and
I thought I just passed it out to you. We just got a lot of time on his hands. Are they
Father? I said he's the hell of a guy. He sure was. He was on Letterman. Yeah. Yeah. He's been
everywhere. He's back down to 22nd. I think Bird mentioned it on the 23rd. The 22nd, 23rd and 26. They
want to have a half an hour on VH1 of Deon. All right. I didn't know that. Oh, they're going to run
a continuous loop. Maybe a re four hours or so. Yeah, he's making a big comeback. It's good to see.
Oh, he looks great to his fantastic and one hell of a good human being. Okay, listen, have a great day.
Thank you much. See you. Bye bye. 143 at WIOD and I want to try to clarify this mess again. Yeah.
At Charhut, well, yeah, the food at Charhut, you already know his fantastic. In fact, we had
unsolicited call early in the show. Somebody called just to thank me for turning them on to Charhut.
In fact, when I was over there in Amsterdam eating at those unmentionable places, I was saying,
yeah, I wish there was a Charhut here, but you know, they haven't made it quite that far yet,
but eventually they might because Charhut is growing like crazy. They want to, okay, I think we got
a little bit more compression going here with a lumpy hill myself and gravelers. I got five. Hey,
75 degrees in the magic city. Hey, we're broadcasting live. Hold on a second. Let me stop out of
75 degrees in the magic city. Hills over great storm. Oh, I'm already on down. Come on down with it.
We're going to get down to that. We're going to get down to that. We're going to get to that.
Groovy. It's the right time. What the hell am I talking about?
That's the one with a question mark on it. Oh, is it? Yeah. Now, do you know, did it happen
while you were gone or before, before a stencil's not no longer with us? Did that happen while you
were gone? Also, Steve's pencil was fired. He was fired. It's been for what? I don't know.
I all I was told is he's no longer with us. This happened. Well, what was he on probation for?
They didn't say that. This was a while ago. This happened.
Steve's pencil was fired and gone for probably two weeks. He's a good guy. He was a good guy.
He was one of the only handful of good people over next door. I agree. Are you serious?
Yeah. Yeah. I know. Oh, business. Okay. It's 147 at WIOD. It's at time that I've been just waiting
two weeks for a boy. How did that survive two weeks without me? Dose of this every day.
Dave County. Polking Niel was very close. Boca. Hey, bird. Have it. Some orange slice.
Broward. This is Lee, baby. Since I need a job. Nobody knows what that means.
Palm Beach. That means you're Pecker, bird. Dave. That's not a stretch mark on my bow.
How did you do without this every day? How did you make it? Broward.
I love her my fan. Yeah, I like that one. He can't live without me. He's here themselves real quick.
Palm Beach. See the movie sensation of the summer. Steve,
one pumpkin and then Joe Johnson and the war. The running. It is showing you.
Boca. Hi, this is Michael Jackson. I can't slide under the doors well when I'm concentrated.
Dave.
Broward. Hi, Niel. Debbie L. Throwgan. How are you?
Dave County. Hello. We're smart. I know the magic.
Dave. Remember if you can't stand a draft, shut the damn door. Boca.
Yeah, please don't remind me Palm Beach.
Killers got the horse, sliced birds. Broward. Niel, still have a U.S.D. in one emoji.
Oh, that's the interesting thing. I didn't see any condominiums over there.
No kidding. I didn't see any huge groups of old people. Broward.
It was amazing. Factor shock. Dave County. Hello.
Niel, you're a stick little glue sitting there. Broward.
I think it's not a frog in your throat. If you didn't... Dave.
Get out.
Broward. In the dictionary, under salivating a portion of picture of steep pain.
Boca. Oh God, play more music. I can't stand a listen, you Glenn.
That's your buddy. Your pal. Dave, hello.
Thank God the queen's back.
Broward. Allie, Allie, the Hollywood guard, your douchebag.
Dave. You'll need to give me a hand with your footcloth.
Broward. Okay, good one. Bomby.
No mad, your douchebag. Boca.
Get it quick. What's behind you?
Broward. Niel, you're a dog.
This is a good one. I heard an incredible story. It has yet to be
substantiated about the dork lady. What?
And if there were some people inside the building, some of the bureaucrats
who wanted her to do an air check.
Is this true? Do I have to?
For the possibility of doing a weekend show, I'll talk to you about it later.
I don't want to talk about it on the air.
It's nothing to a barrison. It's nothing to a barrison.
It's too embarrassing. It's little if nothing to it.
Dave, hello. Where did you do that?
Is Olivier dead or just acting?
Broward.
How is this going?
Car guy.
Broward.
That's it.
I'm going to get out of here.
That was it.
Palm Beach.
Niel, what do you call a fountain or a gay bar?
Boka.
Louis Oliver. Get to work.
Dave.
Hey, the cops are up.
Cups are up.
It sounded like Harry with the sore throat.
And then for he was so incoherited yesterday, he didn't at the end of the
at the end of the game.
He messed up and he was laughing and he forgot Dwayne's stats name.
He didn't know what planet he was on.
Dwayne's, I think I, Dwayne's stop.
I think the pressure started to get to Harry.
Dave County, hello.
The third on I, 95.
Weathe.
Broward.
Now you've had a taste and I mean taste of five bags.
Boka.
Welcome back from vacation, Niel.
Ellis Rubin Howard.
Palm Beach.
Dwayne Stump says that door was here at 36D.
Dave.
I just want to be walked.
He's up so long.
Broward.
Mommy, my hug is on her again.
I got little cuckoo.
This is quite a liking, right?
My plane, I think.
Quite a liking.
Broward.
Gary, I've fallen and I can't get out.

Dave County, hello.
Oh, yeah, bro.
Broward.
Can I hold for the door?
I'm Kent Allen, man.
The norm, Kent Joel, ladies and gentlemen,
setting new lows in the history of talk radio on WFT.
Now you've got to have a good radio and be just in the right spot.
Yeah, I can't.
I can't do it.
In fact, if you sit like right in the middle of the construction on 95,
like in the median there, there's a spot, I think right there.
Tower.
On Oakland, you can get just in the right spot.
There you can listen to it almost uninterrupted for four hours.
Even at night.
And the good thing is if you got a phone in the car,
you can call me in the ear.
You can get a call.
Yeah.
Oh, is he going to be here?
He is going to be so sorry to you, Ben.
You have no idea.
Dave County, hello.
I got a call from the first of when you're here.
That was kind of cute.
153.
They're kind of tidying with what I said about FTL, didn't it?
Didn't it?
Yeah.
Oh, I'm telling you, this is in the book is coming out on Wednesday.
That'll be great, Sean.
But nobody ever came in and told us what time the numbers are coming.
It's Thursday, yeah.
Right?
Didn't it?
Don't you see?
Come out in the afternoon.
I'm not always.
I have no idea.
I don't find out.
Booker, hello.
Yeah, Michael Jackson.
And I can't beat it as well when I'm caught.
BEEP.
Palm Beach.
The Metzuck.
Good call.
Dave County, hello.
I'm moving around factors well when he's got him medication.
BEEP.
Proud.
Into the far, I was thinking of that.
Thank you very much.
Into the far.
Did you see it?
No, not yet.
It's bizarre.
I heard you were strange.
OK, thanks.
You're up.
Into the far.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
Is that a strange move?
Never heard.
Interesting move.
You'd like it.
A lot of sex.
OK, proud.
Hello.
Hey, birdie, my boyfriend's back.

Broward.
Seen paid a direct $1,000.
Yes, folks.
Dave.
So unholy for a nary, is he?
Broward.
How's that?
Boca.
Where did they get all of Dave?
Dave.
One and all.
Broward.
Yes, we're on the other side.
Look back, he's now in the days.
Dave.
Yes, this is bamboo, a bamboo boyfriend.
If I can't get anybody.
He's going to come to get you.
I'm telling you, you got big problems in store.
You're a big, big brother.
Broward.
Broward.
Over.
So Steve's done so, Godfather.
Who's doing midday?
In wild until they get there.
You know, they're permanent.
He's not the permanent.
Until they get their stuff together.
That's what I mean.
In wild, what?
In wild until they get there.
Yes.
Have you heard their music?
Dave, hello.
Line round.
Yeah.
It's your was.
Boca.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Hello.
These people are sharp as a bat of lots of good.
They're great to be back.
Dave Chowdy.
Hello.
Okay, well, another one of those little pauses that we've
come to know on this show.
I hate to break the news to you, pal.
But some of those I understand, okay?
Oh.
Real well.
Just like you do.
What do we, how about Boca?
He said slowly.
How about Boca?
Well.
Yeah.
We were safe on that one.
No problems at all in Palm Beach.
Do my talk about slow.
Do my favorite.
Dave Chowdy.
The New York Street.
Broward.
Get back to the...
Bomb Beach.
Talk with Cistery Baysell with Norm Kent on STL.
Got it.
I think that's what he's going to be doing.
Nate Chowdy.
Hello.
Very good to say.
Broward.
Yes, he's being for Boca's radio.
Broward.
I love you, Ocean Man.
Boca.
Survey's bad.
Dave.
I just like sometimes to see how it all goes.
A little with it.
Nate Chowdy.
Hello.
Broward.
Broward.
Broward.
Broward.
Broward.
How are you?
How are you?
I'm good.
Broward.
Steve Sands, we miss you.
Get rid of him.
Broward.
Dave.
I'm coming, beanie boy.
Dave.
Broward.
I got some shine on a cloudy day.
You know what, Steve?
Michael's Jr.
Wasn't it?
Dave Chowdy.
Hello.
Who pulled from Kiwri?
Tom Beach.
Yeah, take your hat from another field.
Dave.
Dave.
Broward.
Broward.

Broward.
Broward.
Broward.
I'm playing against parties over.
I don't know that could be.
You know.
And last but not least in Boca.
Oh, I'm thinking.
Great last but not least.
Okay, that's going to do it.
It's wonderful being back.
And if you believe that, you know, you'll buy almost anything.
Stay tuned now.
Steve has got another one of these contrived debates.
And the question is, how long will Roy Masters let Bob Puts
leave his hand on his knee?
That's going to be well worth listening in for.
Don't forget the sunny on sports talk, Yankee and White Sox today to clock.
And we'll see you again.
I know it's, it's frightening for me to think about it.
We'll see you again tomorrow morning at 10 here on 610-WYOD.
