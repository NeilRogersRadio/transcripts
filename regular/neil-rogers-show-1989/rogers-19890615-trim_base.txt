The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.
Now, here's Neil Rogers on News Talk Radio 610 WIOD.
I'm a cut fan and a butt man, but I trust you are too.
Here's Gaspett.
There's a long ride to settle here.
Why, but it might be!
It is!
A car ride!
A grand plan!
A grand plan!
Holy cow!
A guest for win!
Listen over car!
I wonder how the Metz fans slept last night.
Kind of, 610 WIOD.
I'm not going to rub it in.
We don't have to have a big time about it because we have two anti-sports people in the studio today.
And you're really serally.
We have Johnny Dark with a different shirt on today.
I wouldn't say it's a new shirt because it's badly wrinkled, but it is a different shirt.
That's something.
That's a step in the right direction.
Anyway, here we are again.
We've got a lunch coming from Wings Plus today, which is why Johnny is here, of course.
And I see that Andy and Todd are both still in the building at the moment,
which means they might actually come in and have a little lunch.
Probably the big shots are about a town again or something, because they don't like that.
They don't want these interns smoothing around in here.
They want them out there working their butts off, okay?
Oh.
Also, we have racing at Calder again today after the weekly two dark days on Monday and Tuesday.
Phil will be pleased to know that we are not picking in the first two races,
so we don't have to be at Arrest again.
Wow, you got to get the lay of the land.
Sixth race I'm going with another Jewish horse, Matt's Stick with Gonzalez.
Why is it Mike Ries all these Jewish horses?
Hmm.
Wonder what's going on there.
And then in the ninth race, in the featured Delray Prep, Mr. Bird is picking Atlanta National,
written by Steve Gaffley on.
Hmm. Tough.
Yeah.
Can I get some lighter or some matches, do you think?
I don't want Roger to have to come in here, because he's overworked already.
But it's really difficult.
I don't want to get Steve upset, because he's very anti-smoking, unless he's smoking a cigar.
Then he doesn't mind it at all.
I do want to say this.
I didn't hear much of that show yesterday, the juniors, but when I was driving to my mother's for dinner,
I heard this goofball call in, and Steve called him a subhuman douchebag.
Wow.
Yeah, look at that Henry.
Hmm.
Well, I tried to listen to that show over and over yesterday.
Henry, I just serviced my cigar.
I beg your pardon?
No, that's an interesting way of putting it.
What did you say?
Why I had trouble.
I tried to listen to that show many times.
Now you're not going to rip Steve.
No, nothing to do with Steve.
All I did was say he said subhuman douchebag, and I almost drove off the road.
But I had trouble with the show.
That's all I'm saying.
You had trouble with the show?
I had trouble with it.
Well, obviously he did too.
Yeah.
So I was desperate, you know?
Well, his Chinese thing, kind of peedered out.
So I punched over to Alice.
Guess what he was doing yesterday.
You know the rumor has it that Marco Polo was hung like a butterfly?
Okay, Alice was doing what?
Drinking urine.
Again?
And not again.
And these old fossils were calling up?
Oh, Alice, it's wonderful.
You should drink your urine.
Trust me, it'll help you.
Oh my God.
I wish we had TV.
There's a thing out of USA today that Roger gave me here.
It says New Jersey may sign up for elderly crossing.
What?
And it's got a new traffic symbol, and they're trying to work it out.
There, senior citizens are very upset about this.
Because it shows two dottering old figures with canes
schlepping across the street.
Now what I like is that creating a new sign
could take anywhere from two to five years.
Don't you like the way the government spends our money?
Could take two to five years?
What they might want to do is have like a figure of clawed line in his casket.
What the?
Yeah.
It's kind of a warning that this could happen to you, you know?
And it could say, howlundale beach boulevard on the street sign?
Something creative like that.
Anyway, it's nine minutes past 10 at WIOD.
I wonder if our lady friend from Cooper City, listen to the good news is we have it.
I got the cart right in my hand, but I'm not going to play it.
Unless she's listening.
Okay. Good idea.
Yeah.
Build deal and the rondelles.
And you said to Spike, why is this morning, take a look at this.
He looked at the label and he said, what's that?
No idea.
That man knows his music.
I don't want to go out on a limb.
Okay.
Like picking northern wolf in a precness.
Yeah.
I don't want to go out on a limb, but I'd say he almost knows his music as well as Rose Folger.
Wow.
I know.
I know that's pretty revolutionary statement, but I would say it's pretty damn close.
Okay.
God.
Anyway, that Broward number is 524 WIOD.
And if that young lady from Cooper City who called yesterday is listening.
I don't want to play it unless she's listening.
She's probably in a car somewhere right now frantic.
But they'll wait a little while.
Okay.
And if she's listening, I want to make sure she gets to hear it because she was nice, wasn't she?
Very.
I bet you that's her right now.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, I know what I did wrong.
I didn't do these yet.
Oh, boy.
This is the best.
Hello.
Yeah, like Park with Niels morning.
Well, that's the young lady from Cooper City.
Hold on, pal.
Don't go away now.
What a bummer.
She on there.
Hello.
Hello.
I'll be darned.
I turned it on just in time.
Boy, that's loyalty, isn't it?
Sure is.
You are incredible.
Well, I'm sorry that yesterday we led you down the path the whole show and in some color to Steve ripped me yesterday for spending all that time wasting all this time searching for records.
I mean, you took the long, I mean, that you took that time to look for it.
Well, I'll be honest with you.
I was desperate, you know, because he really wanted to hear it and I knew it.
And I still can't find it.
That's the amazing part.
I mean, I got the song, thanks to Johnny Dolan, but I can't find my CD.
So evidently, somebody ripped it off.
Oh, no.
So somebody else, somebody else must like Bill Deel and the Randall's too.
I can't tell.
Well, I'm going to play it right after the break.
I can do a little break and it will play it.
I'm just tickled to death at your listening.
If nobody else is listening, the fact that you are makes it worthwhile.
Oh, okay. Thanks, Neil.
Have a great day.
Isn't that nice?
Amazing.
It was, because she's nice.
And there are so few people in this town who are nice that it's shocking.
His reneary would say it's shocking.
Anyway, it's 12 minutes past 10 at WIOD.
Do you believe he's having clockers Sydney back on again Friday before the Belmont?
See, one thing about Mike is he just cannot say no.
You know, he knows in his mind.
He knows that some of these collieries really need to be put on the bus
with boy Gary, Louisville or anywhere.
But he just, he just is too softhearted and he can't say no.
He do hear him whimpering in the background though, but...
Clockers.
Out the clockers Sydney is going to be picking.
If he does his well in the Belmont as he did with the pre-knist,
I would run to the bank right now, make a huge withdrawal, okay?
Anyway, and of course after the race, you'll be making a gigantic deposit.
I don't want to say where.
Kind of like my dogs.
Tell star 34, now that was worth waiting for, wasn't it?
Oh yeah, real worth waiting for.
Okay.
He's got a box out of counter and of course, so does Claude Pepper.
I think, I think Claude has a box under a cauldron.
Well, something like that.
Anyway, to continue what I was saying, sports talk last night.
Little sports talk, spy report.
When the UM game was continually delayed because of the long college race,
long game before it, Hank got bored of talking sports and started reading the rack.
Hank Goldberg was talking tonight about how much he likes you, by the way.
Oh, Hank's one of my favorite people.
Yeah. I wanted to ask you.
They don't come any better than Hank Goldberg.
Go ahead, sir.
Yeah, he was reading the card rack to a caller.
He thought he was reading yours and he was reading...
What's his name?
Rodgers.
Yeah.
Now, I was reading all this stuff from before you.
And then he started reading through your card rack and played Vatican Rack.
Did he?
Yeah, he did.
Well, that's great.
That was good for sports talk.
Yeah.
Well, even the Pope is a sports fan, you know?
No.
I guess he would be, wouldn't he?
Sure.
One more point for you.
If he changed his words around and hurled those names, he'd get real dog.
Okay.
Have a great day, pal.
I see what you mean about this being a really good show today.
Very education.
Barnburn.
We have a lot of barnburn.
1035.
We have two open lines in Dade County.
I don't understand that.
It must be some kind of another one of those foreign festivals.
751-9463-751-W-I-O-D.
And no matter what language you speak, you're going to love the delicious food at Charhut because
it's fresh.
It's made with the best ingredients.
They use only prime ground chuck and they grind that chuck every stinking day, man.
They don't bring you stuff that's been frozen or sitting around.
It's as fresh as can be just like their sausage.
They grind those pork butts fresh every day.
And they even take the bone and skin off their chicken every day.
And then they grill it for your fresh the way you want it with all the toppings that you love.
And they even offer you Kaiser rolls for your sandwich.
So when you get it like an Italian sausage there with all the things I like on it, it's an entire meal.
Not just like a little tease to your appetite.
Okay.
So instead of the fast food junk food joints, you had for the great place, Charhut.
There are seven in South Florida.
And don't forget the official Neil Rogers Charhut Refilable Squeeze bottle will be available
starting July 1st, okay, in spite of what any rumours you may have heard.
There are seven Charhuts and they're open right now for early lunch in Fort Lauderdale,
Sunrise, Tamarack, Davy, Hollywood, Miami, and the newest Charhut at 306 North State Road 7 in Marguerite.
Okay.
We got an open line in date at 751WID.
Now what were you about to say, Night Tam Radio?
What is that?
We got another mobile.
Okay.
We'll look at it.
We'll get back to Johnny Garth, the analysis of the market in a second, but we got a mobile
on it.
Well, we got to get to these people are spending a lot of money to speak to us, right,
sir?
You got it, now.
Okay.
Hey, I caught that little piece last night too.
Did you?
You caught a little piece last night.
Well, congratulations, sir.
It's about time.
Yeah.
Hey, I caught the burden back on there.
Not to get personal burden, but I can help.
They save you massage your head.
It will grow back.
They do say that.
Hey, he's right.
Constant massage.
You got him massage it.
It will grow back.
You got him massage it.
It will grow back.
How about your head?
Well, that's a different story.
I see.
Covering yourself.
Okay.
One more spy report on the colonel this morning.
Yeah.
Did you hear him give his birthday call?
I didn't hear any of it this morning.
I missed out.
Eight o'clock in the morning calling Terry Merrimon at home to wish her happy birthday.
Oh, yeah.
She's got sucked in on that show, boy.
That's going to hurt her credibility is zero at this point.
Well, he was being all excited about calling her when she was in bed.
You know what, we're going to play.
Let's see if there's some interesting stuff on here or not as a case, maybe.
She loves by the ocean.
Presumbling of beach white whales.
She puts on a lotion with them off and a giant pale.
A cringes she asked me.
Do I look alright?
Do we truthful?
You got to myself you like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd give that about a six and a half.
That was good.
Okay, this could be interesting.
You found someone who loves you, true.
That's not all that hurt my pride.
You said my house is like a sewer.
So we're front and so we're side.
You say I'm living like a caveman.
That through steady sheets are fried.
If you stay I'll take a shape man.
Be sure the toilet seat is down.
Give me a break.
Give me one more chance girl.
I'll use there for you.
Try my nostril help for you.
When you breathe change my underwear for you.
I'll use there for you.
I'll bring stars to you.
Sit and talk for hours with you.
But a week takes showers for you.
I'll use there for you.
This sure man.
She needs therapy.
She really does.
Okay, so we got the straight poop now.
Again?
On a cane show.
Yeah.
The saga.
China's bloody revolution will be the topic today.
Colonel John Larson should lick.
We'll be one of the ginseng.
Yim Tom.
Huh?
Yim Tom.
She's a Chinese American student.
Oh, he loves sweet and sour pork.
And David daily, all of her North's former roommate.
So boy, you put that group together.
Wow.
Now that's a show.
Yeah.
So it says Yim Tom should lick David daily.
1242 at W.Y.
What happened to this thing here?
It just died.
Oh, I see.
I probably am on the wrong cut.
You think that makes a difference?
Phil Vester Stallone's back.
And this time he's headed for number one with a book.
Oh.
It's Sly and the family's the Lord.
I want to thank you for letting me break your face again.
I'm coming to get you.
Sly and the family's the Lord.
Your gut will wrench as all the Zookabread warbles his way through this day loose of direct hits.
There is the Y1 who wants to kill the Red one who wants to waste the yellow one.
Oh.
Kill every day scumbags.
And I want to hot gun in the summer time.
Nothing like a hot gun in the summer time.
I'm going to get you.
Sly and the family's the Lord.
A bit of a wear for semi-automatic weapons, you're sold.
Hmm.
Not bad.
That was cute.
Cute?
Well, that's not the worst.
Don't play ball.
Play the odds with the V-Rose talking baseball cards.
Let's go back to the game and make a sound big box.
We don't care who loses their wins as long as we make the spread again.
Rose talking baseball card.
It's fun.
It's profitable.
It's educational.
It's illegal.
The P-Rose talking baseball card will have the fans calling foul.
Only 1495 or 5 to 3 or 8 to 6.
Get yours.
Wherever racing forms are sold.
Time to talk about wins plus.
Now, what is this from Sweden?
Are you doing the EO?
Okay.
Well, it's me, Godfather, Jr.
I got it.
Didn't I try to...
Did I tell you to get a life?
Yeah, you told me it's three times to get a life, but I...
I don't know.
I just give you phone call and see if you give me no chance.
Okay.
This is your last chance, pal.
Yeah, all I'm coming home tomorrow, so...
Are you really?
Yeah.
I'm flying in the morning.
Great.
So, how's all our Swedish friends doing over there?
They're doing good.
The weather's a little grey, but...
Hmm.
You know, the things are on the front, not on the up and up.
Well, there's a lot of folks who are a little grey here, too, so I guess it'll all even out when you get back.
Yeah.
Sounds good.
Mm-hmm.
Would you have any last minute questions about Sweden before I leave?
No.
No, okay.
Can you put me on hold for the rest of the show?
Sure, no problem.
Where are you?
What line are you on?
Line 5.
Line 5.
You might even get on the lightning round.
Hold on.
You're calling collective course.
Of course.
Okay, hold on.
Okay, 1257.
That ought to run up the bill real good.
Hey, boy.
You're going to be all right now.
I see you.
I'm a little...
Do you take the mail out?
Yes.
Watered the flowers and everything's fine now.
I ran into someone in the hall when I was walking...
Not Rick Weaver.
No.
Rick Shaw?
Well, you get serious.
And he said to me that he's going to come in here for cross plugs.
And he, as soon as he finishes Xeroxing, he'll be in here to do some cross plugs.
Oh, speaking of Rick Shaw.
Just where are we?
I just wanted to warn you about that.
Just a minute now.
I got to do this right.
So you're not surprised.
I'm trying to think of what part of the record.
I think it's like three...
Well, I can...
We'll do this one.
Hey, you want me to do this on the same page you show.
Three, I'd say three, three, forty five.
I guess.
Listen to this.
This is going to be to the audience.
Yeah, it is.
Good video.
He's a good song, he's a great song.
Best Call of the Yelp.
Well, I'm right between this and written on a subway wall.
Are both so great.
And of course, somebody next door couldn't be the same person you're referring to.
Who will not play the Dion cuts on GTR,
which he'd make it a bad mistake.
He's making a bad mistake.
The guy who takes it.
Yeah, Mr. I live dangerously.
You know, really heavy duty dangerous stuff like the Beatles.
You know, here it is.
Rick Shaw and dogs, then.
Well, when I hear that, I just go...
I flip my camera.
Crazy.
Anyway, I sure wish we had time to take some of these very important calls,
but we got to do, I mean, he spent all his time dubbing.
And we got a little digest you do now, don't we?
Right, I like this better, actually, to do this.
What's that?
What you're going to do?
Oh, to let it digest and settle down on everybody in the audience, calm down.
It was a very tumultuous lunch today, wasn't it?
It's after a while.
Yeah, it was pretty, we got people in here that I never saw in the building that's true.
People, I'd never ever leave my house.
We had a line from here all the way to the causeware.
It was incredible.
And even Cheryl came by twice, not once, but twice.
What does that tell you?
I'm proud of her, boy, she's got to start getting with it, you know.
But I won't rest until we have Boy Geary come in one day and have food in here.
Wouldn't that be something?
I wait every day, every day, I look for her.
Just have a little tidbit of something, you know, it's got a breakdown.
You've got to admit that he was dead wrong and even though it's bad radio, it's great lunch.
Yeah, you know, every day I make a lot of tough decisions in life.
And one of those is whether you're more concerned about bad radio or good luck.
For me, it's not even a contest.
The water to two hours.
Okay, ladies, gentlemen, Mr. Puts himself is coming to the studio now.
Here's the guy who takes the chances.
Yeah.
Yeah, Mr. Excuse me for not having the guts to take a chance.
Ozzy Oz born my ass.
Get outta here, will ya?
GTR, crank it down.
Crank it down.
Who saw the PD, your fan?
I love that, Dean.
This is Kevin Spar.
This is a good song.
Really, thank you.
The only station in the market that has the balls to play a tremendous song, even if it's not on the...
Computer list from the focus group and a consultant and a maggot study and a 75 kids up the street, you know.
We're gonna have people twist things around in their minds.
He fired Neil Run.
No.
No.
If that's the case, how come I have a letter of release from them from my contract that I had a scream and holler to get to let me out of the contract so I could come over here for almost double the money?
How come that is?
I was my mommy and daddy on the radio station.
I'll come to him, Williams has the job over there, okay?
He worked hard to get.
As Archie Bunker would say, maybe because it's all in the family, you know what I'm saying?
You douchebag, you slime ball.
What an idiot.
Yes.
You fired.
See, even if he had, that would be one thing.
But he didn't.
Oh.
Because that would have been too embarrassing.
They didn't even fire Stan Major.
They paid him off.
They didn't fire him.
If you fire somebody, they're just gone.
If you pay somebody, they'd buy out their contract.
That's a little bit different.
But with us, we just said goodbye.
In fact, I remember the day I said to Borg, I'm leaving.
And he said, oh.
I said, yeah.
He said, I'll pack you sandwiches.
Oh, it's that?
No, no.
He put on a little actor in the beginning.
It is.
It is.
It hears in his eyes.
Oh boy, I could tell stories about that joint man from now till for a month, all till after Shavuas.
A bitter pill.
Yeah.
A bitter pill to swallow.
He was doing sleaze radio.
I got news for that show on Zeta was about as sleazy as chocolate milk.
Okay.
That's how sleazy it was.
They took every spink and thing away from us that we ever dreamed of doing.
Oh, we don't want anything creative if you're thinking of that.
Forget it.
We just want a real safe show.
And we'd rather be number three, the number one.
They took everything away.
So how could we have been doing a sleazy show?
Okay.
And isn't it interesting how they got a segment now with their wonderful upright guys in the morning of things that sound dirty but aren't?
And they do everything as filthy as they can possibly get away with on here.
That's okay if they do it.
That's a good show for the entire family.
Yeah.
I can't even say some of the things.
Oh, yeah.
Filthy is crappy.
Even her minimum being our embarrassed and that's almost impossible.
Okay.
But it's okay if they're doing it.
But we were doing it.
It was a sleazy show.
And they were doing it.
New York Times.
Is that what it means to your times?
Has a 1.5?
I guess.
I guess.
The bottom line is what you said earlier.
They didn't have the balls.
Yeah.
That's correct.
Oh, it is correct.
That's why they got rid of all their talk.
They didn't have the stomach for it.
Yeah.
Because they're a little mom and pop company out of Portland, Maine, who don't have any clue what this market is all about.
They even failed in little markets.
Okay.
They had a solar station like in Davenport, Iowa.
Wasn't it?
Davenport.
What's up, my friend?
And Oklahoma City and the Cocoal Beach, I mean, no matter where they had a station and they failed.
Can I do my statement about Tim Williams, real quick?
We, when we were at CTA, don't take more than 20 or 30 months.
I won't take long.
We were at CTA.
What?
What a scary Lawrence was the general manager.
We were brutal.
We ripped him to shreds every day.
Now, I think everything we said about him was basically valid.
However, compared to Tim Williams, he was a brain surgeri Lawrence's genius.
That's all I want to say.
That's it.
Yeah.
That's my statement.
And at least Gary was a good guy.
Yes, he was.
As opposed to Tim who walked around in that position, like he had a load in his pants all the time.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'm talking about the hall with that kind of strange...
Oh, man, I'm telling you that.
That story there, that is the most incredible, unbelievable.
And I bet you he believes in him.
Yeah.
I bet you he's twisted around in his own mind.
Big lie.
Yeah.
Well, let's see.
We're sitting here with about an eight share in a sold out show and they're sitting over there with a one five in the morning and a one six on the station and an AM with a two with demographics that are so old that it's...
But they're thrilled.
And they're thrilled.
They got glad that you have your New York Times image, okay, and that you're starving to death over there, okay?
Because you couldn't, nobody could deserve it any better.
Look at that. He's so worked up about it.
He's gonna go check the mail again.
He is.
I'm telling you, that just knocked him for a loot.
23 after 1 at W.I.D., time to talk about one of Johnny's favorite restaurants,
Cappers Alley in Plantation, where you are gonna find a delightful...
Which is saying a lot.
Anyway, it's 134 and don't forget on the Steve Cain Show today, it's Yim Tom should lick a derivative.
That's the Yim Tom should lick David Daly, that's the list of the...
Sharon Gabe.
Well, that's gonna be like a Chinese orgy here today.
I know that's gonna start a new revolution.
And Steve's gonna be previewing that great new flick called, I like fat Chinese chips.
Whatever.
Yeah, that's it.
Anyway, let me one more time remind you then, Saturday, June 24th,
and by the way, the guy yesterday was a subhuman douchebag that you were referring to.
I almost drove off the road when you said that.
But is that the one with the eyes?
The tall guy, oh, he...
Very...
Oh, drives you nuts and he never goes away, just hangs over the table.
Him and his friend from playoffs, the round to Mr. S stands for something we can't say on it.
Mr. Mung.
Oh, geez.
Anyway, Saturday, the 24th, we will be there without those guys or the guy with the dog.
If they do show up, we're gonna have a special van to cart them away.
The same van that carts away, they're broken down courses at the track,
it's gonna be cart them away.
But anyway, we invite you to come out that day because we're gonna have a lot...
They tell us they're gonna be prizes.
I mean, you know, God only knows when you're dealing with Lynn and sales.
But she says they're gonna be fantastic prizes and of course we'll have the bumper stickers and pictures
and I guarantee you tons of food there that day.
Oh, prizes.
I'm gonna surprise you.
Prices and sur prizes.
Yeah.
They say it in a business, so we'll insate it up.
And...
And of course while you're there, we want a lot of you to check out the great deals
because during the summertime, man, with the summertime blues, you're gonna find savings
like never before on those beautiful 89 Toyota's.
So kind of like make a special date on a calendar right now.
Okay, because we know that Lynn would never change the date on us again at this late date.
Saturday, June 24th at Toyota of Hollywood on 441 between Tapt and Sheridan streets in Hollywood.
Right up the street from Char Hut and right across from Dissalvoes.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
What's happening? It's Todd Palm Beach.
Right up the street from Char Hut and right across from Dissalvoes.
Hey, Neil.
Is that your name, Tom Palm Beach?
No, no, no.
Are you related to Tom Palm Pino, sir?
Hey, I feel like a radio person off he was Tom Palm Beach.
No, no, no.
Why a waterdale?
It's not in Palm Beach.
Uh-huh.
Hey, I got a really homestead.
There you go.
Yeah, I got a little uh, little phone for you.
Got a little something, huh?
Can you handle it?
That's the word that...
Can I handle it? Well, if it's a little something, probably.
Here you go. You won't...
Okay, 139 in WIO wrong.
Yeah, he was wrong.
You did.
You don't need any, you know.
Corus lines out here in front of the causeway.
We've already got enough other action going on.
And of course, on the Steve Cain Show this afternoon,
Yim Tom should look David Daly.
And Hank Goldberg with Sports Talk at 605.
And at 730 we got the Orioles and the Yankees.
Yankees actually won a game last night, which was pretty damn exciting.
And then on the Larry Cain Show tonight, Kevin Mitchell in 22 is it now?
22 home runs.
Keep in mind the season is just about a third over.
And this guy is going at a rake.
He would hit 66 home runs and driving about 180 runs
at the rake he's going right now.
The guy's unconscious, okay?
The year I think the 100 of his rookie cards is 66.
Now you don't have him in a rotisserie league, though, do you?
I don't play that.
Oh, man, this rotisserie based ball.
I'm telling you, every time I speak to Norm Kent,
he's like right on the edge of his seat and he's worried that this one just got injured
and his rotisserie league is falling apart
and the Webster's back in a lineup.
Oh, it's incredible.
He's in conference on rotisserie baseball.
He's trying to trade the Frishan Dunston, now that he's sitting.
Yeah, he's out of his mind.
The man is a great attorney, but he's living his second childhood in baseball.
That's all I can tell you.
Miami, hello.
Hey, what's going on, pal?
Hey, what's going on, pal?
Well, much like I did.
It sounds like a real, something like a bomb of a taxi cab.
Yeah.
It's scraping the bottom of the barrel.
Oh, hey.
I just heard Alice, and she just put me into a slight coma.
Alice?
Yeah.
It's a little early for Alice, isn't it?
Well, yesterday she put me into a slight coma.
Oh, yesterday he was drinking at...
Hey, Neil.
Can I hold on for the lightning round?
I knew you sounded like the guy who I was looking for.
You know who this is, right?
Yeah, you know who it is.
Just put him on.
Just put him on.
It's...
No, it's not who I think it is.
Is it?
It is?
Oh, sure.
I'm going to give this a day.
I'm going to hold him for the lightning round.
Okay, if he should get disconnected, don't play me.
It'll be an act of God.
Oh, man.
Is he something?
He's like...
Who's the other one like Vic?
One of those people you cannot insult.
You know, he just keeps coming back and coming back for more.
Mm-hmm.
It reminds me of that guy with a blue car.
Bob, something he used to come into morning and win those prizes.
Oh, you from Sunrise?
Sunrise?
Sunrise from Sunrise.
Oh, boy.
He even shows up on a remote.
Does he?
Oh, man.
So he cannot get rid of him.
He's just so creepy and so...
He just boogie.
Yeah, spooky.
He's here to the classics for now.
And one of Bill Wise's favorites.
One of his picks for the week.
Miami, hello.
You want to hold, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, I could tell by the sound of his...
How many?
How many?
I don't know.
We need to keep track.
Two, four, six.
Six on eight lines.
And one of them's blank.
Six are on hold?
Six out of the seven.
It leaves West Palm Beach.
Do you want to hold, sir?
Yeah, yeah, please.
Okay.
Well, I guess that kind of backs us into a quarter now.
No, no, no, that's fine.
That's all right.
Well, it's just about time.
There I know it is.
It times out pretty well.
I will say this.
Boca's not done, Erica.
Just as I said it, it started to flash.
Hello.
Yeah, I can hold flash.
Sure.
Okay, now we're all set to go.
We'll do our last break.
And then we'll come back and have a good, exhausting lightning round.
And then we can say...
Right.
Wow, what a show today.
I was right.
And the lunch from Wings' plus today, I am going to tell ya.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Boy.
I still can't get over to it.
It was like something that happened, but then you have to wonder whether you dreamed it
or it really happened.
That's how good it was.
48.
Sharon came in again and she made a disgusting comment about Ross's lips again, which I cannot believe.
And...
Oh, was it Batman and Robin and his lips?
You have a session with lips.
Yeah.
Any guys out there, you know.
Really like Steve Tyler lips.
Sharon is ready to meet you in a hallway.
Mick Jagger would be good.
No, not good enough.
Anyway, Johnny Dark, before we go to the lightning round, has got another incredible story.
I want to tell us on a year.
What a man.
Well, we're going to tell it a few, don't.
Why would you want to tell that story?
Oh, he wants to get hired over there.
No, we can't.
You're not going to work for them.
No, he doesn't want to.
Anyway, he was over there visiting our good dear friend, Jeff Gonser, picking up his acid
casualty t-shirt that he won in the immortal show.
Since John could get right through since he was only two or three people dialing in.
And he was enchanted with Jeff, who of course is so amiable that it's usually disgusting.
And Rose Folger came into the control room and said, well, it's nice seeing you, John.
Goodbye, you're going to have to leave now.
Kick his ass out of the building.
Do you think there's a little paranoia there?
Yeah, very.
Just a little bit of paranoia over in Carroll City.
You bet, Jack.
Sure sounds like it to me.
What the hell did he ever do to them?
I mean, just because he repeats everything to us that he finds on his ass.
That's beside the point of if you've got nothing to hide, you know, isn't that what Alexander Hague would say?
Absolutly.
And it means if you have nothing to hide, then just open up the doors to the closet.
Let's see what's going on there, okay?
Right.
Exactly.
Because since I was fired by Tim Williams, my life has really turned upside down.
I just cannot believe that the man would have the hutspa to say that,
especially a guy with young children like that, it's 10 till 2 at WIOD.
And we're ready to go now to this part of the show that most of us are pretty damn embarrassed by.
Dave County, hello.
Oh, Neil.
Neil.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Palm Beach.
Yeah, quad-pepper, second-dating brown, things are just fine.
Never felt better.
Broward, hello.
Dave County, hello.
They're back even, man.
Dave County, hello.
I'm coming to paint over here.
That's a nice, nice.
That's a nice voice sounded pretty familiar to me.
Okay, hello.
Of course, they don't make love as well when I'm constipated.
They go together, see?
Broward, hello.
Nick, you're a pen-foam-net geek.
Now, remember, the Nick Lawrence fan club.
Dave County, hello.
Ever since Bill Calder moved to New Orleans, has become a case young provocateur.
The bat-lock.
We're a bat-head.
By the way, bring our carts back when you're finished in the newsroom.
He's inside house called Broward, hello.
There was a note lady who lived in the shoes.
Dave County, hello.
Hello.
Broward.
Palm Beach.
Hello.
I'm like a respect to the same family.
Bokeh.
See, every time I'm this...
Dave County, hello.
This is good.
Just buzzers, okay?
There's a new way to do it.
A Broward, hello.
Bunch.
Boy, are they sharp?
A powerful day, huh?
A little slow.
Just a little slow.
Well, I think that heavy news we got this hour.
I think they're just under the weather, under the table.
The bat-line.
Is Emily Aiken?
Dave County, hello.
I'm Neil, pull my finger.
Palm Beach.
Bird, you've got the personality.
Only a necrophilia could love.
Okay, so I did like the hunchback and odor date.
Did it?
152 at WIOD.
There's one...
There they go.
Flash it again.
This is good.
You get to hear all the ones heard.
Don't.
You don't get to hear these on the air.
What a loser.
Perfect.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Okay, sure.
You ought to be boiled in oil.
Okay, you jackass.
You idiot.
Broward, hello.
I am not a happy best fan.
Just wait a couple hours.
Do you think it's bad now?
Palm Beach, hello.
Never did William.
Slow as usual.
Just kind of dragging along.
Dave, a broward.
Whatever.
Dave Kaine, you're a dork.
Twist on the dork lady there.
I don't like the new...
I don't like her changing now.
I like the way it was.
I don't like change.
Something that was dork lady, Junior Rat.
Was it dork lady Junior?
I wonder if you want a dinner yesterday.
On the show that they're talking about all over town.
That show yesterday.
Boy, you ain't hear what they say.
We can't put it on the air now.
Palm Beach.
They needle.
You show me ears.
I'll show you mine.
No big thing there.
Dave County, hello.
Jeff the Sebastian Salon A.
Broward, hello.
Bill is in the douchebag.
Dave County, hello.
My name is Al Randell.
But my friends call me freeway.
Boca, hello.
And...
And William Zika, hello.
Excellent question.
Dave County, hello.
I flew in and I can't get off.
Backline.
Get lead over here.
I wish.
Yeah.
Likely story.
Boca, hello.
Hello.
And Maria.
Are you there?
A little traffic call there on the...
Oh, hello.
She's right on top of things.
And she ever gets off.
We'll get that traffic on.
Dave County, hello.
Bill, you know, William's fire gas.
Broward, hello.
Who's on four longer?
Part couple of the who?
It's pretty tight.
Pretty tight.
Palm Beach.
The mad fuck.
Alright, finally a color with some sense.
That line.
You make me pure.
Dave County, hello.
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle.
Broward, hello.
Broward, hello.
Dave County, hello.
I'm having jet pay.
Palm Beach.
I'm in line at the Raskoo Hill and we're doing it.
Dave County, hello.
Jailspeople are assholes.
Okay, boy, that's a constant truth.
Boca, hello.
Jail, love you, have a seat, E-Bard and visit Brighton the same place.
That line, hello.
Well, isn't that Spanish?
Yeah, that's a good one.
Dave County, hello.
The best of Steve Kane is the perfect oxymoron.
Broward, hello.
Boy, they are early on top of things today.
Palm Beach.
Pointing beach on the needle.
Great.
Nice guy.
Broward, hello.
Dave County, hello.
I need the store, Quainty.
Yeah, I understand.
Boca, hello.
It is blocked, I pray.
How many free-foot-fire houses my body, huh?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Travel around the world six times now, I think.
Oh, why?
Dave County, hello.
Yeah, there's Hank Goldberg, real Neil Rogers at night.
See, at least the one thing with club, they did not have his casket.
Half-hour helicopter, like, I could tell that.
At least we had a little class.
Broward, hello.
I was going to tell each one.
Ha.
Badline.
Wow, Eric Cumberrow.
Dave County, hello.
And two weeks later, here comes Norman Woods.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, excellent.
Okay, Dave County, hello.
Man, that's really the truth.
What was it?
The what?
Something something something.
I think I did.
Dave County, hello.
Danny, cup up your arm, bitch, before we all die.
Palm Beach.
The Metz, the Metz, the Metz, the Metz, the Metz.
Badline.
Okay, good one.
Somebody inside the building dropped the phone and the soap at the same time.
Dave County, hello.
Dave County will make me one of two.
Volka.
Mike Frunch, itches.
Dave County, hello.
It's slowing down and I can't get it up.
What up, old man?
Dave County, hello.
Followed half of the crew, but we couldn't see.
You could hear that.
You wanted me to let that go?
Yeah, we wanted that.
There it is.
Maybe on your show.
How you know why he's not into business?
But it was so true.
Hey, well, there's no problem.
Sometimes just because something's true doesn't mean we put it on the air.
A badline.
Okay.
There we go.
That's inside the building.
Too bad we don't have some work for them to do anything.
And then, Broward, hello.
I'm toast to Al Renteel.
Dave, I am for yesterday.
Yeah, perfect.
It was slow on.
Dave County, hello.
Mray and Frunch.
Now, see we know what that one good.
Yeah.
See that one.
That was more right online.
The other one was a little more right around.
Dave County, hello.
There it is.
That line.
This is Mary and Corbin.
I want you to come in my box.
Oh.
How you get an idea of what goes on here that doesn't go on the air?
What a meeting.
Anyway, it's 158 at WI.
That was a double entendre, wasn't it?
Yes.
It certainly was.
And when you get your own show,
all of the ones that we dump on this show,
you put on your show.
You can go over there and do what Harold City,
because they want to be really ethical and wear that top of things.
Dave County, hello.
I am a douchebag.
Broward, hello.
You make your party use a condom?
Palm Beach.
Thank God he's over.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was thinking the same thing.
Dave County, hello.
Broward, hello.
We've been Johnny Scott Intensive.
True.
Palm Beach.
That's Dave's a bitch bag.
Dave County, hello.
Happy day to you too.
Dave County, hello.
Come on, get with it.
Too late.
A bat line.
Boy, isn't it amazing how many people inside the building,
I think, are calling a Broward, hello.
Hello, Harold, kind of like that.
I'm trying to get some work out of you.
And of course in Bokka,
just keep this way for you.
Okay, well that's going to do it here for a reasonable Wednesday.
And you know, things were okay.
Now on the Steve Keynes show,
Yim Tom should lick David Daly.
That's the list of games.
We're reading it right off the page.
And then we got sports talk with Hank Pardon me for using
Neils Material Goldberg from 6 to 7 30.
That at 7 30, Yankee Baseball with the Orioles.
And of course, Larry King tonight is going to breed on
Sammy Davis eyeball, and it's going to cause us
during the even Murray Puppet Group.
Have a great day.
I'm going to rush home and watch the Cubs win again.
We'll see you tomorrow morning at 10 here on 610 WIOD.
And then he comes in here and the Rips are sponsored.
Our dear friends at Wings Plus.
Please, now listen, I don't want any of this to go wasted today,
because boy, when we start throwing stuff out,
people are starving.
We have nothing else yet.
Huh?
We haven't seen it yet.
No, but I'm just telling you.
We've had days when there's been some stuff that kind of
lingered, you know what I'm saying?
Well, these are good and hot today, too.
You like it hot?
Yeah, right.
Oh, yeah, he's from Plant City.
He loves it hot.
Anywhere there's some chili here, too, which I think I might have a little bit of.
Do we have any utensils?
I'll have a little piece of that sandwich, too.
Look at that.
Boy, we got it all.
They went crazy today.
There's a forks.
And the spoon, what is this?
Oh, my God.
Look at this one today.
Have you ever in your life seen a steak and cheese with onion like that?
Yeah, I'm half a half of that.
Who wants the other half?
You want it?
What do you know?
I'm going to eat Wings today.
Just Wings?
I think so.
Who wants the other half of this incredible sub?
Okay, Cheryl.
Cheryl's got this.
Where's it played for Cheryl?
I feel like we're in an auction or something here, isn't this incredible?
This is something great today, and it's also kosher with us.
We're going to have a steak and cheese.
Anyway, it's 11.57.
This is the part of the show when we kind of shine the audience.
You just find something to do out there, okay?
Appreciate it very much, and there are a laugh, a scream.
Yeah, underground jingles, I think.
Something like that.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Anyway, the sub today, the steak, cheese onion, and out of the tomato,
and the other cheese.
Just like that.
That was it.
Marlin.
It is great.
Yeah, that was Marlin Brando, gripping on the radio.
You heard it first.
Next, it'll be on Murray Pupik, but you heard it first here.
Mmm.
Oh, boy.
Mmm.
You were right about today.
This is going to be a...
Yeah.
This is not just a lunch.
I was saying that during the news break.
We get fed here every day, but we don't get fed just a good lunch.
We get fed a gourmet spread every day.
Every single day, it's something sensational.
Time for a crime, James' record.
We could play it.
We got our little 45 spindle on the turntable in there.
Can we play 45s in there, Nick?
Yeah.
We can.
Yes.
Now, that's unusual, because most radio stations, they steal the spindles every day.
They do.
Production studio at Zeta used to drive me nuts.
You'd have to run all around the building to try to find a spindle.
I wish you could be here.
I want to meet you.
No, remember.
It could be worn long.
Remember you were in it, Zeta.
God.
It's great.
It's the best record they ever made.
Next up on the roof.
Remember you were in it, Zeta, one time when Neil was on vacation, John.
And you had to like center the records, because there was no spindle on the 45s.
You just like centered them with his fingers.
That was incredible.
That's great job of that.
Anyway, I got to do a little break while they're queuing up our exclusive cry in James' record.
That did?
No.
There's more coming.
Is there any way you could play May-I?
I might show up, she's listening.
We don't have May-I.
We usually have a trouble finding the other one.
Oh, yeah.
If we had it, we'd play it, maybe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And the Johnny Dark said it'll bring you next time he's got it.
We got it.
Right.
Yeah, I'm one of those rare individuals like you with this record.
That's for sure.
But I really have to acknowledge it with those oldies.
Yeah.
Well, I'd call Ricky Tickey and maybe he'll put you on a ear.
I'll listen if you hear your own show over there.
Listen, if you ever want to take my number, I'd be sure to help your radio station out.
If you ever wanted to play more music.
No thanks.
22 pass to the WIOD.
We have an opening in Broward where I just hung up.
524 WIOD.
Boy, he was right on the verge of your friend there that was, you know,
a schmorying in on the show one.
You know, sitting in, you know.
You hit that button.
No, we didn't want your number.
We were very pleased to talk to you and have a nice life.
And you really hit that off.
Play with your records, pal.
Bang.
Anyway, we would have played Cron James.
Is he dubbing it?
No.
No.
Boy, you know, we feed you like this.
You think you can just sit around here and, uh, dilly dally?
Man.
So we would have played, um, it could be wordloved by the Cron James earlier.
We're going to have to wait a few minutes.
Dubb it.
Because we got to dub it on the cart.
Cause as John said, our record player is broke.
How can it be broken?
That's weird.
Our turntable is under the weather.
Ah.
Can't pull these out.
I understand that.
Yeah, either.
Is this a radio station or what?
Turntable doesn't work.
Hmm.
Amazing.
Speaking of sick, here's Chuckie.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay.
Uh, who the hell's Johnny Dog?
Is he the guy that was on that WKRP instance in Eddie?
Mm-hmm.
And now he's on that, uh, head of the class or something like that?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Back of the class.
Yeah, I thought so.
Anyway, Neil, the Meds suck.
What is that?
The Meds suck.
I'm trying to have to admit it.
Mm-hmm.
But I have won some money on Chicago, so I'm, uh, not the best.
Well, good.
Good luck to you.
Yeah.
Anyway, can you, that's all.
I'm on a mature, can you put on some of Eddie's wound?
That's it?
Turn up, brother.
Whoa.
Wow.
Look at that.
Two lines in Broward just went out when we put Chuckie on hold.
Five, two, four, W-I-O-D.
Boy, this, um, these wings with a, uh, blue cheek.
These, this is, uh, man.
Mm-hmm.
You've never, I swear to God, never takes anything like this in my life.
I mean, you know.
Mm-hmm.
I really apologize to those people who are out there listening, getting real hungry.
Yeah.
I don't mean it, but I apologize.
Boy, that is something else.
Mm-hmm.
Boy, till they start eating on WLRN.
Don't they already do that?
Oh no.
Yeah, but they eat with fork and knives, though.
Very refined, okay.
And of course, only very British things, you know, because it's a pubic radio.
Uh, Riviera B, chill out.
Yes.
All right.
Let me try it again.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
Listen.
I then listen to you guys eat and both start on the phone for the last 45 minutes.
I wanted you to play rock lobster for me.
Rock lobster.
Yeah, by the B-52.
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, this is sure the show, the place I can reach all of that time.
Right under the table.
That is?
It's a good song.
Yeah.
Okay, no problem.
We'll get right on board.
Okay, now we're down to four calls.
Boy, look at that.
Well, I think they're all getting hungry and going out for lunch.
Maybe.
She should have.
Yeah, with these calls, it's really okay, you know.
We don't care.
Mm-hmm.
Boy.
This blue cheese and the, um, and these are the hot wings, too.
They brought medium garlic wings and the, um, these hotter extra hot, just hot.
Mm.
Could be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.
Now, do you want to think about that?
Yes.
Before you say that.
I've been known to exactly.
You're belly.
Lately?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, okay.
All right.
I'll buy that.
Mm-hmm.
I'll buy that one.
1226 at WIOD.
And we have an open line in Howard.
5249463524WIOD.
And also one in Palm Beach.
At 655WIOD.
Boy, this is the, I haven't gotten any on me, I don't think.
Sure.
But this is the sloppyest job I'm eating, I've ever done.
But it's just, you don't care.
When I didn't get any of those mushrooms, are they all gone?
I didn't either, and I don't know.
They're all gone?
Probably.
Somebody took all the stinkin' mushrooms?
They really cleaned us out.
The beer battered mushrooms with the horseradish shosh.
I didn't get any.
They're all gone.
We were cleaned out.
Oh, now let's not get carried away here, folks.
I think Mitch took all those mushrooms.
Mm-hmm.
I never saw it.
I never saw it.
I never saw the box.
Never even came close.
There was a whole load of them.
Oh yeah.
But I think they disappeared.
Oh, are we, we're way behind on a break here.
Aren't we, my God?
What's going on?
You're distracted.
27 past noon.
We're like three minutes past on a break.
And I'm supposed to tell you that fuck.
