All the old ladies are getting excited now.
Where is it?
Bring a build caller.
Oh my God!
It's the real build caller!
Come on, don't hover in the background!
Come on!
Come on now!
Playing hard to get.
Open that gate up for build caller now.
Let that man through.
This mic is sitting at a tough life.
He's never cashed a ticket in his life.
Put him here.
Yeah, but the chair point right here.
You're busy eating anyway.
Right here next to me.
No, I'm going to sit in the middle and referee.
This could be.
You want me to sit right here by a rough part of the show now.
What are you pointing your finger at?
Right here.
Over here.
No, don't give him.
You just sit down over here.
I'll sit in the middle and kind of referee.
No, no, I want him by me.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
No, you have an advantage.
He can't hear you over there.
It's called her.
What a pleasant surprise to see you.
Star of WQAM in the morning from 5'30 to 10.
We don't want to sit.
We're going to get all upset.
But he's got plenty of audience to share.
That's what he said to me.
I'm sorry I didn't hear what you said.
I said lester is really a great guy, isn't he?
Oh, this is great.
Can you hear it?
These are better than ours.
Hello, test.
How you doing?
You look fat.
You've lost a little weight.
Did you know that's nutrition?
By the way, do we want to talk about that great meal we had over the weekend?
Don't do it.
Don't do it.
I won't do it.
No, we know it actually.
It was standby.
It was stands bra.
I'm not going to tell the story, but it was stands berthay.
We all went out and had a great meal.
Don't try it.
Please.
I'm going to destroy my mind.
First day, we had a tremendous meal.
I mentioned it several times.
Did you?
Yes, you tell me.
No, I did not tell all the things.
No, I didn't know.
Great.
Marvin is more his Marvin.
He's got a great crowd meal.
I'm proud of you because I know you were up in the hospital.
Marvin, you're still looking for him in Chicago.
I don't know.
He was here a minute ago, but then he heard you were coming in.
Is this Johnny Dark?
You never met Johnny Dark?
No, I was.
Don Cox was here.
I know a lot of people who I'm sorry.
I say Don Cox was here before.
And this is the rat.
And this is the bird over here.
The rat.
I've never met him.
That's correct.
You never met the bird?
No.
And you don't know me.
You don't know me?
I don't want to get into it on here.
Yes.
What do you think you're here for?
I'm here to buy some CDs.
Oh, I'm sure.
No, you're here to confront me face to face and tell me the charges.
He's here to get some more rice.
He's here to get some more rice.
Stevens records.
Okay, now don't get hostile.
I want to hear what I've done to you, Mr. Calder.
Okay, we're going to take a little break now.
Oh, boo.
And when we come back, Bill Calder will answer the question.
Is the rat sink, does it sink or does it float?
That's the question.
Uh-huh.
Remember the sink and float, lady?
Well, look at that.
His mic is off, too, now.
Now, we didn't tell you this.
Is this off?
Oh, there he is.
This is advantage.
We will have Calder's mic on.
Yours will be off.
But he's only been back in town a short time.
He needs a little edge.
Anyway, would you like me to sign one of those things?
No thanks.
Okay, tell me.
Hey, can I do the spot?
Certainly.
The surly bird gets the worm, right?
I tell you about Toyota Hollywood.
Would you like to read some of these prices here?
Shoppers.
I'm not doing it.
If you want to read the prices, anyway, a brand new 89
Celica that was 50,000 56 sticker price.
You can get it for 8328 right now at Toyota Hollywood.
That's like half price.
That would give you a half dozen.
Even Bill Tesser could figure that out.
An 89 Corolla that stickers for $11,493.
$6,293.
A brand new 89 to sell.
A sticker price, $10,673.
Almost exactly 50% off.
You can buy it right now with discount and credit.
What a 5,373 bucks.
Seriously, there are just a few days left till the 90s are going to come in.
They are just brooming out the remaining 89.
So get yourself over for the deal of a lifetime to Toyota of Hollywood.
On $441 between tapped and Sheridan streets in Hollywood.
And we'll be back with a battle of the bands from SPACs after this.
Chuck Meyer here.
How do you spend your...
Oh, I got a mouthful of food.
And the callers here, he and the bird are going to have it out in public now.
It's going to be great with a live audience.
Finally.
Finally.
I'm going to come up with a mix of rounds, three falls.
If they turn my mic on.
Oh, there it is.
It's on.
Quit your belly.
Can you, can you?
Go ahead, rip into hell.
No, I have nothing to say.
I've said everything I have to say.
There's a fan of yours.
What is it?
He just plays a big fan here.
Listen.
When you came in, man, you get surly with me.
I'm a shopper here.
I'm not here to see you.
You know, ladies went nuts when you came in here.
Man, it was incredible.
What is this?
Oh, look at that.
You want some shells?
No, thanks.
You're not going to eat?
No, I didn't come here to eat.
Look at that beautiful fruit.
You know why I came here?
I'll be honest with you.
I came here to say hello.
You are so full of crap that it's just frightening, you know?
It's frightening.
No, I did.
Well, he would like to say hello.
He'd like to mend his fence.
What is it like to know less than any question?
Okay, I want to know more.
Oh, I know you're dying to get this over with.
Yes, I am.
I know.
I know.
Because I have no complaint with you, Mr. Calder.
I like you.
I shouldn't have.
I know.
Bill, I listened to you back on the great entertainer.
I enjoyed it.
Well, look back into his fence like saying you remember when I was in the cupboard wagon,
Bill.
I've always enjoyed your show on the air, Bill.
I've never ripped you on or on the air.
I never hate your guts.
Why do you hate me?
I'm going to be honest.
I'm going to tell you what an old one.
I like this.
From the very...
You know what?
When his nostrils start flaring like that?
No, I'm going to be honest with him.
I'm going to be honest with him because I think he deserves an answer.
For the very beginning, when Neil said he was going to have a sidekick, yes, I told him,
I thought it was a great idea.
But for God's sakes, don't get a Gentile.
I did.
I said, get a Jewish guy.
Excellent point.
So this is my big crime.
Your Gentile.
Society.
No, I didn't take exception to a few things you said because I'm not the type to take cheap shots at people.
I have never ripped you.
Any comment I've made about you?
No, I'll tell you that.
We're running out of time and we're getting close to the news.
Let me just say, in closing, that a couple of times I felt you jumped in and you were much too quick to rip.
Don't use that rip.
Well, not rip.
No, but to suddenly take a shot at me.
To do what?
To suddenly take a shot.
Number one, Neil was giving me hell about some callers as he's privy to do that because...
You don't point my call to your show this morning?
See, I'm not what I meant.
And then you jumped right in and said, yeah, an Lester called to me like this like Bill, I did say it.
That's right.
I did not intend it as a second negative.
Secondly, when he couldn't find my ratings, which are hard to find, I agree.
You said, well, I'm not going to say anything because you'll think I'm attacking him or something to that effect.
After all, I'm not going to say anything, but I know why you can't find his ratings because he doesn't have any.
You are too sensitive.
You are ridiculous.
Glenn, let me ask you a question.
Glenn, listen to me.
Listen to yourself right now and then tell me I'm sensitive.
I'm laughing.
I'm having a great time.
I'm sensitive to you worse than me, which I never thought I would encounter in my entire life here.
I'm here to have a good time.
I'm Bill...
Bill...
Bill Cussford and I are here to provide some CDs, to buy some soundtracks.
I can't hear you.
No, sir...
I heard the big charts.
I know what my crime is now.
I'm a Goisha Cup.
You've got me.
You've got me...
Well, I'm back through the wall.
No, but you have that Gentile humor.
It's not...
You heard it.
It's you heard it.
It's right.
It's not ripping me to you.
But it's a Gentile humor.
See, Jews can attack me.
And I see.
Now this answer is my other question.
He's beaten on me for about 14 years.
It's true.
And it was all true, that's right.
Exactly.
I remember the first time when he came to me for a job.
It's true.
I asked him.
The first thing I asked him was not worried worked or do you have a tape or anything?
I said, are you Jewish?
Bill.
Let me tell you something.
It's all serious.
I'm in the West Bill.
My girlfriend is Jewish.
People...
My landlords are Jewish.
I work with someone who's Jewish.
I'm an honorary Jew.
And he lives in Kendall.
Yes.
Yeah, for your question.
I'm going to tell you something.
I'm going to tell you something.
I have a lot of friends who are Jewish.
I know Neil Rogers and he's Jewish.
And I'm going to tell you something.
Your no Jewish.
He's got my vote.
Now I'm going to leave.
Have we settled this?
Have we?
I think so.
I think so.
I think he puts you to rest.
Did you hear?
So how could I come back from that?
The last thing I did today was I had a little...
We have a little breast pot in the studio.
A pot, yes.
Did you grease it up a little bit?
I grease it up.
And through an arat.
No, I'm only kidding.
But you have to remember Glenn.
What was that mystery sound by the way?
Glenn, you've taken a lot of kidding since you've been on the show.
Because you don't do anything like that.
You know what I mean?
And you have to learn to take a joke.
This is all a joke.
I've never even known you.
That's what I thought.
So how come I don't even like you and I don't even know you?
Grito.
It's all in the spirit.
You should have learned this from Neil.
Exactly.
Neil has learned nothing.
There's...
Okay.
Okay.
Are we friends again?
Are we?
No.
No.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, I think we have cleared that up.
We're real clear for you.
And we're almost at the end of the hour.
Now, when is the food coming?
I've got to go get some CDs.
It's been great.
You see it?
You see it?
Get some raised Stevens, man.
You're not playing it up here.
You see it?
And we got some.
Don't you want to eat anything?
Come on.
I don't act like that.
You're so...
Come on.
Be fat like me.
Be fat like me.
Okay.
Okay.
Have a wonderful life and I'll see you at the track.
Anyway, we've got some stuffed shells.
I think I may just have a little touch of that.
Pastrami, little pizza.
Some of the ravioli.
Everything is delicious.
And we want to thank everybody who brought the food by Steve
from Steve's Pizza.
Right?
TV's pizza.
Now, you all straighten out with him.
Is that all clear to him?
I'm going to talk to him during the break.
And then we'll find out.
I'll go get some food.
I'll report back to you.
Oh, he says he wants to talk to you during the break.
Off the air.
Off the air.
Yeah.
I'll report back.
Okay, Chuck Meyer is standing by and he's got the new NYOD news.
We'll come back in 12-5.
Does anybody know what Steve is doing today?
Does anybody care?
Does anybody care?
And they all said thumbs down.
Abortion.
Okay, they said Steve would be doing another abortion today, too.
And we'll come back live from the brand new specs in North Miami in 12-05.
Yeah.
You have a good way to do it.
And, uh, I can't believe you can do it.
So, you've got to put you in your cage real good.
Oh, did he?
Kind of stirred that pot when he was here a little bit, didn't he?
Exactly.
Okay, I'll see it to recent.
It's great to see you.
Unbelievable.
We remember the story some of us.
Okay, anyway, what are we doing?
Are we doing all- I will.
I promise I swear to a Madeline O'Hare.
Okay, my hand on the...
Okay, now listen, Dion is going to be here any second of it.
He can get through this wild crowd.
He's going to be here at noon.
Okay, take care of yourself.
I guess he's going to bring his guitar, right?
He's going to possibly bring his guitar or not.
Or not, he's a case maybe.
And it's going to be great.
And I got a little of my gas here in the water.
And everything is under control.
This has been just more...
See, when you come out, it really brings out the...
See, brings out the words.
Yeah, it brings out my...
I'm going to have just a little...
I don't want to go overboard.
But the people from post-abilities we want to thank for bringing all of it.
Yeah, they all bond really good.
If I didn't taste the shells, they would be crushed.
Wouldn't they?
Yeah.
Devils, why do you get a little plate?
Well, I don't want a whole thing.
Okay, let's give the numbers out.
Just in case there are people who still want to call and in case we can hear any of the callers, which is unlikely.
We have a full board of calls.
See, we don't have to beg for calls when we do this either because for some reason when they're in...
We're in the studio, they hate us.
But when we're out and about, they just go nuts.
And of course, Rogers on the board of days, so we know that we'll actually...
...get one or two legitimate calls before the end of the show.
And that's all I'm having just a little taste of.
There's anybody who wants this...
What are we going to do with this?
Well, you should take it back there to...
John, aren't they eating back there?
Yeah.
Or over here, they got a table.
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
No, but just don't... what's up the floor? That's all I...
Oh, don't drop the cheese.
Oh, God, they got this beautiful new place here.
And these people are going to pick out and put stuff to join.
And they'll never...
Oh, cheese!
What are you, sir?
You okay?
Yeah, with his fingers he's eating stuffed shells.
Oh, go ahead, please.
You can't do too much damage with that.
We got Jerry Vale here.
He's going to sing a medley of his hit.
Does he look like Jerry Vale?
Yeah.
Huh?
Yes.
Of course these people don't even know Jerry Vale.
Look, you know Jerry Vale?
Does he look just like him?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Who's this for?
Who want... oh, for you, you don't look like you need it, sir.
Yeah, right.
You haven't done enough sharing from what it looks like.
Okay, it's 12 away to W.I.O.D.
Let's punch up a call and see if there's any chance
that we can hear them.
Okay.
First, first look at this guy on this man's...
Oh, jeez!
Dr. Vinny B.
It says on this man's body, Dr. Vinny B.
Get a seat.
Oh, go.
I don't believe it.
Oh, look at this.
We love the pictures.
Yeah, there's a few stiffs lying in a street waiting for you
on a way across.
Oh, I bet.
Okay, and have a couple of that little sandwich before your surgery.
It'll help your eyesight.
It'll get your blood sugar back up.
Dr. Vinny B.
Isn't he a piece of art?
What a day.
Man, the celebrity.
How'd you like to be sitting in his waiting room, huh?
Boy, he is.
The celebrity's here today.
It's just...
I can't control the...
I wouldn't be surprised if Don Agony showed up, you know?
Noodles.
It happened.
We're still waiting for Irene, right?
Yeah, waiting for Irene.
Waiting for Irene.
Anybody from Love 94 has been there.
And Keith Allen might show up.
He's there to be a good challenger,
wouldn't it since they've been calling in a ledging
that they want to make up to?
We're very close to where he lives.
I bet you this crowd would go nuts if Keith Allen came in and kissed him
made up with you right in the middle of the bag.
Now, Bill called or face me face to face,
and we had it out on the air, and I found out my crime.
And I wouldn't be surprised if Joey stops by, too,
to plug that sick TV show in his...
I have no argument with Joey, though.
Speaking of kissing and making him...
Was this Meg on again today?
Boy.
Like I said, I wouldn't give it like, yeah, what a show.
That's right.
We got to talk about...
No, we don't have to talk about anything in this break.
We just have to do a little break, and we'll come back where it's
specs the brand new one on Biscayne Boulevard
between 124th and 125th right,
next to Wendy's, and just have a block away from that Kenny's Deli,
where they sent him to delicious pastrami,
what are you laughing about?
Go ahead, Shadelli.
Bill called or...
No, he wouldn't know pastrami for all of us, Skye, okay?
We'll come right back from specs.
