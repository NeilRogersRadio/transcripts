make us nauseous poppano hello honey oh yeah hi hi don't grant okay i just come um but ask
when about uh his trip to Las Vegas yeah um did you when when you're out there did you help make it
out of the casinos and get away from Las Vegas a little bit no oh no i never left the truck why would
you why would he want to do that you why i never left the traffic came oh no get slowed wait a
minute you didn't go up the strip oh no i did that downtown oh yeah but uh but what do you mean you
never left the traffic that's the way i felt you know they had everything i needed when he actually
gets slow you need to get away i i i i used to live there uh aren't you there's a few really nice places
outside of the town to go away like can blow up steam and kind of regroup blow off steam yeah
yeah you really ought to try to get up into the mount Charleston resort area yeah and um and do what
uh just take a look around it's gorgeous this incredible country it is oh and uh the uh red rock
canyon that's probably the closest to town it's a really easy drive yeah well next time i go to
Vegas i'm certainly going to check out the red rock canyon and all those other great uh you know
how the hell wants to be in a casinos and gambling and losing your money and having a good time
and having all those great meals and checking out all the entertainment that any idiot can do that
well like i heard my fill of that uh but uh like i said there's you know there's more
to to solar Nevada than meets the i yeah basically when you drive up to reno and you see all those
missiles hidden underground instead there's more than meets the i we've got to go to Tucson
Arizona everywhere yeah can drive around and say what is this well it's a Miniman
Psello excuse me but well that's why they're turning it into a big retirement town okay
well we're starting to get worried there i think there's something symbolic about that
getting worried there because the town is starting to grow up around the silos
yeah we're going to have them in their backyard too pretty well as a matter of fact i noticed in
sunrise they're starting with some of those Miniman silos too maybe there's something to it
and maybe they're going to target them for how and yeah yeah okay well uh next time you're out
in Vegas so think about it yeah and i'd like i'll check back with you and see what you think okay
thank you so much yeah i'm thinking about it a 118 at wiod briefly we have an open line in
Palm Beach now where they have lots of silos six there's a silo under every house in west Palm Beach
six five five wiod except of course on Palm Beach proper because those people got all the big
money over there at Palm Beach they never let them cross the island though you know that's what a
bunch of pseudo intellectual sloppy douchebag uptight paranoid spoiled pampered pusses on Palm Beach
you know with all their stinking filthy money and they won't they don't even want to talk to
Donald Trump they will let him that's how stuck up they are okay i'll let him in that's new money
oh they don't like new money as opposed to all of money yes it's true you don't think the fact that
they don't want him to speak to him because when he went into sd louder's house the first time on Palm Beach
i want to make it back a little bit you breath as they're there and from there i'd like went down
hill for Donald Trump okay it was well down hill okay 119 that card comes in handy for a lot of
things doesn't it you like that card i love it my Emmy hello hello yeah yes sir afternoon
