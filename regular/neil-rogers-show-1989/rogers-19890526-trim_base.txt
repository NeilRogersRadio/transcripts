growth they keep giving him work to do i don't know what's going on good well
they're not gonna do anything like him to some
boy this is good bone it's great
and this is unusual boon must be in a really generous mood today because
usually he don't come in and sit down here and waste all his time
putting all these plates together for everybody

oh he does i'm in shock
incredible yeah even boon knows this guy okay we want we've got to have a
chronic party at boon's place we've got to do one Friday that's a good idea

bury upstein there we could get veggie from boka there you go everybody except the guy in his
dog oh no he's he's cooling out okay good friend all right i just wanted to say hi and say hi

moment to see if i can find it here it is we got to have a little special introduction for Henry
and the eleven o'clock oh great he knows just a second now this is worth waiting one moment please

you good music huh okay not too bad we've seen worse yeah no we had considering the tremendous
business that we did in here it was fairly yeah orderly yeah it was excuse me we've seen
what was terrible i would disgusting anyway it's eleven o'clock six at w-i-o-d look at that they're
even cleaning the table up here and it's uh what a job you guys did today incredible
and of course Todd was not in here today i'm getting you know it gets old you know i'm saying
these guys that want to be out there working when they're supposed to be in here reading lunch
so if he comes in here fetching that he didn't get fed i don't want to hear about it okay
what he wants to be on the air norm can't i thought he'd be playing baseball by now
listen i i found some time in between my rotisserie league and baseball game you really want to
admit this on the air to advise you that the city council of plantation not has approved your
satellite dish they approved it and you'll be able to watch yourself all the way into cub heaven
really well laugh now and cry later the cubs are in better shape than the dodgers norm at so on
cantonia yes and they seem to me that we beat her schizer twice or did i dream nap i met i met
somebody on the elevator of my building the other day who was just dancing in the elevator because
he said the cubs are in first place and it's almost June 1st a game and a half by the way the
mets lost yesterday just mentioned that in passing a game and a half well he said that it's a thrill
for the cubs to be in first place because he knows it won't laugh while he's full of it okay
well i i think as long as we got michael jimson shan dunston were in great shape well of course
who would dare go to the plate knowing michael jimson i mean that's correct you have to wear a
batting helmet that's right but i don't even hear he even hear he wears a helmet when michael jimson
comes in by the all-stop break the mets will be comfortably in sconces first place the cubs
will be looking up you will be lamenting the fact that you have to deal with another
wriggly summer in the second division isn't it a shame that norm called in and humiliated and
disgraced himself up here like this today i bet you're going to be getting a lot of letters about
this call i wouldn't have it any other way okay govern yourself accordingly
take care see you later okay it's 1108 at wiod the city of plantation has approved my dish
everything is wonderful and kosher and i think norm and i think uh chuck over a tell star has
been a real battle but once they saw what it was there's no problem i mean it's like uh you know
what's the way reluctant approval no no no so we had Paul harby jr before the news norm can't
after the news and this and we had berry abstin oh one in the first hour don't forget about berry
okay heavens boy this satay is so good yeah everything is great that's i think he puts
some like you know we got some cashew chicken today it's like peanut butter oil something i don't
know what's Henry looking for what is that what is that i don't want to say what it looks
oh that your wife made really what's it got a little kaluah in it too no konyak oh konyak yeah i
should have known well thank her so much and if i'm not here monday you folks will know the reason why
okay it's nine minutes past eleven at w-i-d Henry's in here now look at that all the only things
there left are all liquid isn't that great that's why he's got a big smile on his face here's a
mobile and brown or hello Neil how are you great i just had to tell you this little bit of information
about the cubs we spent a couple of days in Chicago this weekend of course the cubs are at a town but
listening to you over the past couple of months i've come to uh when i when i talk to people i will
give them slogans like the cubs suck and so on and so forth and i made that
mortal mistake of saying that to somebody in Chicago this week and almost got myself killed
yeah they are absolutely going crazy up there the town is nuts over the cubs i'm there for you
the cubs suck they sure do just want to let you know that okay get you later thanks a lot how do
you like that they're all excited up there are they're not great the bulls the cubs black cubs had a
big year i'm excited i never liked you cubs anyway it's a 10 minutes past 11 at w i o d we have an
open line in brown or five two four w i o d this is going to be like yesterday remember we ate early
good we put it behind it and then we had good yeah and then we could have do a show like a real show
yeah and the guys in the newsroom and all these other people showed up because it was payday they did
their excellent job that's why there was so basically they were in here real guy and then they zipped
out they got their food everybody was on it but only talked about a very low decibel tone yeah
and the boom was shoveling that food out there like grant of Richmond it was great really we like
yeah we like that right like it didn't do it early get it out of the way then we do a radio show
we kind of sit back yeah that's good and just to try to digest it all yes oh boy this was great
even Harry Bruttle dessert from home hmm and we got those custard yeah why do i feel like i'm
eating so much more than i usually do when boom come i feel like i'm eating a lot
fighter now whatever you say boom no wonder he brought you that pornographic magazine
what a wonderful birthday present boom that was really talk about unique and different
yeah right away especially that blonde Chinese woman oh man that was interesting
never saw anything like it's 11 past 11 to w i o d toyota of hollywood is making deals as i've
been telling you that are just could be the chance of a lifetime and if you think i'm exaggerating
just to get you in there you're wrong because card dealers as you know are trying like crazy
everything under the sun to get people to come on in right now and buy because things are a little
on the slow side it's a little bit of the um doldrum days you know what i'm saying the dog days
but toyota hollywood as you know always has the lowest prices and now they've got gigantic factory
rebates on top of which they're slashing even extra chunks off the prices on a sticker of
virtually every car in a lot so if you're in the market to buy or trade or if you thought you were
going to do it in a couple of months maybe give a second thought to go in and look in around
right now because you're never going to get a better deal than the ones that are waiting for you
right now at toyota of hollywood don't forget you got just a few days left to take advantage
of the mage service department special oil change filter 25 point safety check
on everything from breaks tires hoses etc all of that only nine dollars and 95 cents when you
mention neo-rodgers and wio d at toyota of hollywood on 441 between tafton charidan streets in hollywood
it's 137 at wio d steve is doing his ill advised blockbuster video debate this afternoon which i
i just uh i think he's wrong now i really do i think he's dead wrong they got every other movie
that's ever been invented and they got one that almost nobody wants to see and he's got all
these poor suckers out there these sickle fans who are cutting up their cards and sending them in
and he can get all the filth that he wants from what he's other places in fact i heard
through the grapevine and nick had another bag in there yeah the bag man they call him yellow bag
so i don't but anyway it's the blockbuster photo there it is look at that another red and yellow bag
oh man but anyway the reverend right uh the right reverend whatever the hell is name is
john cox is going to be here to uh explain why they don't carry the last temptation of christ video
and create a whole um simmiss about that red that'd be exciting reverend cox not don cox reverend cox maybe
he's related i would have to ask don't start talking about don cox cause he'll call in again man he
is so boring when he calls in on his show he's a wonderful guy but he is so boring god look at that
we just as you mentioned his name the collar and go drop right off the line two seven eight w i
and d and bokeh here's the filled Beckman in hollywood another former radio superstar that's it and i
want to say one thing i really enjoy that rickshaw air check that you play the latest one with
there isn't that great talking up the dream lover that's yeah i think i may have to i may have to
get that out here yeah that's my favorite word is is that from 1959 or or is it newer than that or do
well i really don't know but we'll have to check the date on it okay probably early
i had a bite of double of something for you from last hour i guess now i would think it
probably was from when dream lover was out which is about 61 i would say 1959 believe it or not
was it yeah 30 years ago wow okay about the circle you know you mentioned that they were managed by
brine Epstein they were also were the opening act for the Beatles in their last tour i got to really
they and bobby have in the run et's all open for the Beatles and it cost you four dollars and
fifty cents for a ticket oh by the way speaking of the run et's if anybody at our friends and
specs or anybody has got any run net yet there's a reason why this guy named alan Klein who is the
manager of uh who was the manager of abco industries that tied up the Beatles stuff for so long
messed up the rolling stone stuff for so long is now involved with the Phil Spector stuff are
you that's why i can't find it it was within a month of release and he got involved in it and
put the whole thing on hold isn't it incredible i mean that rhino has i've been scouring looking for
a Phil Spector CD but all those great Phil Spector fill it off your groups you know the run et's
and all the others that i can't find any rhino had like an eight or nine set of CDs retro
respective of Phil Spector's career was was almost to the printing plant the pressing plant and
they've got got held up well i don't know how long that's going to take shocking i don't know
if anybody would know yeah i don't know the thing about pop sickles and icicles i don't know if it
has the art or the writers created on there but david gates of bread wrote that song are you cereal
just for success wow for you are just full of it and one more little handy telephone tip for
those uh... soot that have that uh... call waiting it before they call it you they dial star seven oh
they wouldn't get that poppin and click on all the time which sounds like you can yeah yeah that's
right and that's it while you're sure uh... just a fountain of information today well i always
enjoy your show and i'm glad i go by the way all right well one more thing the tossing and turn and
you were talking about yeah you want to hear the original master tape version of it with a
longer intro and mind blowing stereo look for the baby boomer disc sock hop in sixties you will
really like that that one right that one let me ask you question who else in the world could have
had that in the machine uh... and played it as you were describing it okay that's also got the
yeah it's but it's it's it's shocking it is it's not that anybody that's walking around with
this much information in their minds about trivia and music could be dangerous well i like to think
that okay keep up the good work thanks a lot Phil be up bye too bad he couldn't use any of that when
he was on shoot well the audience and she was too stoned to understand it

you Rick yeah saved you from a disaster yeah I'm leaving you tomorrow you gotta play a whole
thing for a bill backman and point do you remember he asked he said it's his favorite oh that whole

afternoon I got to get home and see the Cubs game who's pitching for the Cubs today by the way

think bolecki would be my guess the MCS I've become a lot more tolerant well you have to you don't
have any choice let's see uh additionally uh mailer and killgis oh jays that big fat Rick
mailer who we couldn't hit at all on Sunday and Paul killgis who's like oh so like I said we'll
just take our time and if I get home fine and if not that's okay too good is there anything else

so April gets ready with the news in there
and that's going to be it for the 11 o'clock hour god it seems like we've been here for at least
15 or 20 hours this is giving new meaning to the word ponderous for this has been just incredible it's
been awesome but it's been ponderous yeah April does have the sensuous exclusive 12 o'clock WIOD
news we'll come back at 12 o'clock five Steve with his big blockbuster show at 2 this afternoon
more than you ever dreamed you would know about the circle high ladies and gentlemen I
ready to broadcast I love myself now I'm gonna tell you we owe a tremendous
debt of gratitude to Steve Stancell over it GTR because what 97 what is that he won
put it on the screen I can't read Laura's lips Laura she's got something to say about everybody
who breathes in the building he broke his nose who's Stancell how do you do that he broke his
nose playing bachiball by softball yeah well that's a GTR softball team oh and if you saw those
trends it came out they didn't only lose in softball anyway no but he did that cart and it's it
just fits in with everything I mean there isn't a record there might be one record can I play it
yeah it could be this could be tough I was gonna say there isn't a record that's been made
that that particular part will not do the fuck up yet well this could be it really
or these are ones that have the different cuts no I thank God they put the same cuts on the front
the numbers on the front weird as they had on the back why would they do that and it's amazing
because it's the same it's the billboard series but with some of them they got carried away and they
did different numbers because they want to do a scotch shwar it's hit him playing softball isn't
that something Laura's Scott hit Steve Stancell playing softball because Steve made some
in temperate remark about Laura and her very tiny eyes or something like that so it says there's
one less shooter well I would say that Steve Stancell is not a bad looking guy in fact he's probably
the only guy over a GTR looks human isn't he's not he's pretty good looking guy right yeah
Laura's he's okay by me in fact she says now and Glenn Wilson Glenn Wilson oh Glenn Wild
well that's a Glenn Drowbot yeah well Glenn's um
schmutzie looking at me he's not a he's a pack oh he's very cute
Laura says Glenn Wild is very cute do you think he's very cute never thought of it no I never
thought it was cute I think that Ross is cute okay and Todd would be a lot cuter if he'd come
in and stop doing all those jobs on the outside yeah
not bad he did it not bad he did it okay it's 1221 and WIOD we do have it open line and
brown or it's 524 WIOD I guess we're getting the second race today with Phil Saltsman
oh Calil Lady with Rodriguez is my pick out of desperation I don't have any idea the heralds
not there anymore the sports sharing sharing came in and messed with our all when I have it here
to you got Willie's folly in the ninth race with Velliente a little girl she left me this
let me leave us the sports okay let me take a look and see just how bad my pick is
oh Calil Lady's also 6 to 1 in a herald morning line but they got just beware with Kesti it was
the best bet of the day and nobody picks oh Calil Lady well of the name like that I think because
that's horse country up there you know yes that's true so we just a stab in a dark we'll give Phil
another excuse to call in today because he's desperate desperate desperate desperate to be
heard by somebody other than the 4,500 people of Haya Lea Miami hello hello hello yeah yeah
