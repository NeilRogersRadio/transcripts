by the city
uh... at the
behest an urging of a particular individual who's mentioned uh... all through
the articles okay
i'm not going to dignify by mentioning his name
and i do want to make very clear since i'm sure that he's monitoring right as we
speak
that that's the only reason that he's not being mentioned on this program today
because this very clearly is a legitimate
new story okay
but i wouldn't to dignify his ego by mentioning it
but anyway the hellendale city commission is at it again in two years ago
and of course i guess we got a lot of new listeners and people were not
involved with us during the sweet and low days
uh... we went through this whole same business with hellendale couple years
ago and the problem the thing that really
got to them the most was the fact that it was true
that's what bothered them
and i listen to a lot of the calls that got so many things that i want to talk
about to clarify because i listen to a lot of these old far to called in
steve yesterday there must have been five or six of them
all yes we got to get him off the air he offends people i got news for you
uh... any top show host in america worth his weight in salt offends some
people okay in fact there's some of them will offend a lot of people
that's not a criterion for someone being on the air or not being on the air
uh... there are people in this town past and present
extreme right wingers
who have who
constantly make these grotesque there's a war to get calm is
about liberals for example
and i mean the worst kind of generalizations and go on and on and spew the worst
hate and i find it offensive
but that doesn't mean i think they ought to be off the air okay see that's the
difference
so because something is offensive
uh... there's a real remedy to that and that is you don't have to listen to
it i'm sure there are a lot of black people who think that the jeffersons is
offensive because
george jefferson basically in that show is a
fairly well to do pretty well to do step in fetching that's all he is he's
one of the worst area types i happen to find a show funny okay
uh... i have to like the show but i'd know at the same time that i'm sure that
it offends some people
that's life okay that's this is the kind of thing that happens
when you have the free market place in exchange of ideas like we do in this
country
that's the whole basis of what this country's all about
and what really shocks me is when i hear some of these elderly there's one guy
called in using a couple of years expressions the other day just like mayor
Rosenberg over there in halloween dale
who supposed to be this liberal democrat
and of course two years ago called me the flaming fegal i recall that wonderful
uh... bigoted remark of his
you know you see these people have only have short memories
and for someone who supposed to be a liberal jude to be spewing that kind of
bigotry and have that kind of narrow mindedness really is is frightening
i guess very very short memories
but anyway so you know there are elderly people who are offended by the fact that
we tell the truth on the show and you know how many disclaimers do i do on the
show
comment and so many disclaimers to the point of nausea about saying hey you don't
have to be chronologically old to be an old fart mentally in fact just yesterday
by coincidence we had some young wacko some pinhead and i said there's living
proof that age doesn't you know determined whether you're an old fart it's a
mental state of mind you can be twenty and be an old fart you can be ninety five
like this eighty one year old lady who called before and like some of the
elderly people who called steve yesterday who love what we do on these shows
okay because they got a sense of humor and also because they know that there's
a lot of truth in what we say of course about a lot of this horrendous behavior
that goes on in this town and really and i'm going to tell you one thing right
up front at the beginning of the show you will never ever hear me retract or
apologize for any comments i've said about this so-called senior citizen syndrome
and i also heard some of these pseudo intellectual callers there were two or
three of them calling yesterday and they just
sees upon us these are people who hate my guts anyway and they see upon this
kind of opportunity to jump on the bandwagon and oh yes about how i'm aligned
these people and how i make them feel bad and how i encourage young people to go
out and call them douchebags etc and so on i got news for you long before neo
Rogers ever came to this community there was a gent there was a
age gap here that was so incredible that it was mind boggling and long after i'm
dead and buried unfortunately i probably still be here long before i came here we had
the early bird specials and the adult only communities and all this whole condom
mentality so don't put the onus on me all i've done is tell you the truth okay
describe it and describe what it's done to the image of this community which is a
nightmare when i first came to k a t i remember i lived on the beach and i
can remember driving on ocean drive in colons avidouncing all those elderly
people sitting in those chairs staring at the sidewalk waiting to die
which is when i first came up with a term outdoor funeral parlor
i didn't invent it i just told it to you so here's another case where the city of
hallendale doesn't like the message because it hits too close to home so let's go
after the messenger let's attack neo Rogers again because after all we're p-oed
he made us look stupid two years ago and some convoluted logic they assume mr
Rosenberg who tries to run that commission over there like a little dictator
mr Rosenberg thinks that something outcome is going to be different
i mean sunny baby you're in for a big surprise because it ain't no different now than it was before
but i'm glad to see that they have no crime in hallendale that they have no more j walking problem
that they have no drug problem that they have no poor people living west of the railroad tracks
that they don't have any problems over there and that they have the luxury of giving an individual
40 to 45 minutes of time to play tape recordings taken out of context and edited by the
individual to come to a particular point okay that would make sunny happy and give them all the
ammunition to come up with this resolution unbelievable there's a lot of time a lot of important
business going on over there at hallendale okay it's 10 13 at wio d
there two Miami cops with a hot two beats they're on the streets fighting cry
they pop that they can't face there in hallendale vice we get a problem the gray
gang is a total of trics we can't it isn't that the group of senior citizens to win around trying to
get the early bird special after seven yeah they're back in town let's go get them
yeah
stop it nothing to clean up this tree hey lady you can't cross here you'll have to cross in the
light and they're determined to clean up this muclein business all right to steer you're under a red
oh so now you're arresting my wife watch the charge session to powder open that first time
let's see that white stuff yeah just a thought she's got over a hundred bags in here
over what sweet love that restaurant you just came out of let's make a man
here they're gonna get Miami cops on a hot movie in hallendale vice
preparing this fall on mbz get him off the air get him off the air now he's attacking us
I wonder if sunny Rosenberg has any sweet and low in his house okay just curious about that
sunny you know what we ought to do we ought to call of people at sweet and low remember a couple of
years ago and this thing was in high gear and it made papers all over the world as a matter
of fact including the Philippines and China which we mentioned yesterday the people in New York at
the sweet and low company got wind of it and they they put together thousands of packages of sweet
and low and on one side it said stolen from the home of Neil Rogers which I thought was sensational
maybe we ought to have him print some up that say stolen from the home of sunny Rosenberg now there's
a nice yeah so then sunny could at least feel honored and recognized when these people you know
stuff the sweet and low in their bags it'll be like a little campaign blush for sunny over
their in hallendale okay maybe that might get him off our back anyway I just want to make a
few comments about this individual who and I notice in his article which is hysterical talk about
the pod calling the kettle black the individual who spurred this yesterday claims that I've harassed
him on the air for the past 18 months I've harassed him on the air you're following that I'm
a sort of a classic in my I didn't hear that now do you think maybe that's a misprint they got
that back work all must be because for the past it's 19 months now I've been subjected to a
campaign of harassment the likes of which you could never imagine Steve talked about it yesterday
in a sense and repeating the whole thing sponsors being called and not not just so you've got to
write out there if you don't like any show you got to write to write a letter and say to Joe
Blows clothing store hey I don't like Neil Rogers and I'm not going to I'm not going to buy any
clothing in your store as long as you advertise on a show because I don't like it you got a
right to do that you don't have a right to call people call them at home at call them at home
at call them at home at weird hours and abuse them and things of that nature you just don't have a
right to do that nobody has a right to do that just as nobody has a right to tell us what we can say
and what we can do on the air except the government you know the commission has got the ability to make
certain restrictions which we understand and are well aware of other than that there's nobody
out there who's got the right to dictate what can be on the air and what can't be because that's
fascism like I said the other day that's like the Joseph Gerberal School of Broadcasting or anybody
out there can say well you know I don't like this and I don't like that and here's a list of
of things a menu of what you can say and what you can't say because I don't like this side of the
menu I don't like yeah me I don't like I'm the center if we were going to allow that to happen
or anybody in a broadcasting industry allowed it to happen you know what you'd hear all day
the sounds of silence because there wouldn't be other than maybe a few pronouns there wouldn't be
anything we could say that somebody somewhere wouldn't object to okay now let me ask you this
no wait a minute I don't like that the questions okay oh I don't have a question so cut it out
now let's take you off the year immediately no questions well let me give an example okay no I
don't like examples let's say somebody hated David Letterman yeah despise I bet you there are
those people sure thought he was not gonna get him off the ear that said he's ruining the the
language of our young people strangled a peacock myself terrible influence on young people he's
influencing the way they talk and that that's getting pretty uh surly lately and then you find out
that the guy tapes every single David Letterman and watches it later what would you think of that
I would think he had an obsession yeah with David Letterman obsession what a life you know what I
mean what a life he would have and just complains about him constantly in fact it is interesting that
there have been those very responsible individuals who have investigated and discovered that there
are some people some individuals maybe singular who have an obsession with a show yeah tape
everyone shocking you listen to it later and like Steve always says I love that line he uses about
people with rich full line but when you sweep it all away and I just I want the public to understand
one thing and especially and I know we have a large gay audience okay this whole campaign it's
going on for 19 months you take away all the window dressing about lyrics and songs and about the
old people in haelandale because at zeta even when we took all the songs away okay and we were so
we were so antiseptic over there man it was incredible we all had to wear white suits to come in
that's how antiseptic we were even when we took it all away the harassment never stopped every reason
being that what this is really all about is homophobia and of course most of these hate letters that
have been sent out these malicious hateful letters that have been sent out to anybody you can imagine
including people who have nothing to do with this program the line is almost always in there
somewhere about neo-rodgers trolling for sex from teenage boys on the radio so again just like many
of the comments about the senior citizens and I say many here are things that are taken out of context
and twisted around when they're said an obvious humor and satire you'd have to be a moron not to
understand that but for malicious or other purposes twisted around is if they're out here he goes
he's trolling for boys on the air okay and you'll recall many of you the Adam Walsh Foundation
letter yeah what was his name again I don't know name slips my mind uh that we read on the year here
a few weeks ago hmm which again was spurred by the same individual taking things out of context from
recordings of this show and sending them out to third parties anyway it's 22 past 10 at WIOND I
got a lot to say especially about howland ale and the city commission over there because the other
part the other part of this business going to take care of itself and a steve said yesterday
a norman kent who is one of the finest attorneys I have ever met um has been employed by steve and
myself to deal with illegal aspects of the harassment and the other things that have gone on and they
are going to stop believe you me they're going to stop good because I don't know I've been in a
business almost 30 years and I don't know anybody in the country who's been subjected to the kind
of abusive campaign it's been going on against me and now for the last three months against steve
uh by the same individual and it's going to stop believe me because freedom of speech is one thing
it's amazing how people always talking about their own freedom of speech yet they're not concerned
with yours or mine or steves or anybody else's and of course they include in freedom of speech the
right to harass and intimidate and threaten that in their own warped minds is freedom of speech
it's 23 past 10 at wio di 1026 at wio di by the way yesterday as usual there's some interesting
lies that get told along the way for example when I gave out the number of the
howland ale city commission and urged people to call and protest this ridiculous resolution which
this is the second time in uh two and a half years that they've done this uh and I was very very
cautious in urging you and be seeking you you know know her asking calls or threatening calls
just to do it responsibly which is what I always say by the way and uh short time later we got a
message a frantic message from mr. intendola saying that there were callers were tying up not only
the switchboard but the emergency lines and fire and rescue and later on on steve show we have
we have the emis we have the true story yeah that the 9-1-1 numbers go through hollywood they have
nothing to do with the howland ale switchboard that was just an absolute fabrication and every single
time we do this and say you know act responsibly and let the public officials these elected officials
who are on the public payroll know what you think about their actions it's always the same excuse
all the harassing us they're tying up the emergency line blah blah blah blah all this other garbage
and all of this is just another cowardly attempt in other words you know that guy in howland ale
it used to call and sing he can dish it out but he can't take it well that's the case with sonny
Rosenberg and a bunch of cowards over there in the city of howland ale they can dish it out but they
can't take it so when somebody tells the truth over what a bunch of jellyfish they are over there
they can't handle it you see mr. Rosenberg you're not going to dictate my free speech on the air okay
and i'm shocked although i shouldn't be shocked because this is the guy that called me the flaming
phagola a couple of years ago on the air and when we did our thing at the diplomat mall where 99%
of the people who showed up were supportive of me and laughed at mr. intendola and mr. Rosenberg
and the beginning he wouldn't even shake my hand like he was going to catch some kind of disease
by shaking my hand this great wonderful liberal from howland ale you ought to be ashamed of yourself
you know before hitler took the Jews he took the homosexuals and the gypsies okay that's who we
took off to to kill in the concentration camps mr. liberal Rosenberg
and your bigotry is legendary now over the last two years it's unbelievable
that flaming phagola whose handy wouldn't shake and then at the end of the show when he saw that the
overwhelming majority of the people in the mall were supportive of me he comes over and shakes my
hand and he's laughing like it's a big joke who the hell are you kidding sonny who are you kidding
and bigotry like i said is what this whole hate campaign against me has been for the last 19
months all this other stuff is window dressing that's all it is here's another message an older
listener offended that these listeners have been termed morons by mr. Rosenberg insulted by the
city of howland ale so his feelings have been hurt mhm i thought we couldn't do that
i mean i listened to some of those sueds a couple of those guys that called in yesterday who
obviously hate me with a passion are just seizing this opportunity to jump on the bandwagon and
try to legitimize it and oh yes he uh you know he hurts the feelings of the elderly and he just
i've given more disclaimers about what we're talking about and believe me it's true that's why it
hits such a nerve i remember when i started the thing with sweet and low and howland ale two years
ago i expected to do one show on it six months later i couldn't shut off the faucet that's all
people wanted to talk about woman in the new york times magazine in the sunday magazine wrote a big
piece on it you remember that sure about the stolen roles who may be running again this weekend a
Gulfstream by the way but um which is in howland ale by the way in which we mentioned constantly
another thing it's interesting i'm wondering if they're going to get try to get gulstream park
and the dawn family to condemn the orages because i got a real surprise for them okay dug down and i
happen to be good friends gulstream park and i happen to have a very strong relationship that
includes Roy slaying off and jotan and bob and bob savage a lot of other people over there
and i'm going to be there sunday doing my thing for the community alliance against aids and
wonder what mr. Rosenberg thinks about that hey oh and i hope a lot of people show up maybe this
will spur a lot of of my listeners to show up on sunday and make contributions yeah just as kind
of even if it's not from the heart for the cause just as kind of a protest to mr. Rosenberg in
this group of neanderthals in howland ale um but you know how many people have called us up and
said they went to gulstream they had never been to a horse race before we don't have to we don't
have to justify it just as i've always said unfortunate that gulstream geographically happens to
be located in howland ale and nothing they can do about that they can't move it you know it's very
close to the daybroward line there and i'm sure that a lot of people would be happier if it were
just a little south you know but there's nothing they can do about that and it's not the city of
howland ale it's this just handful of fakers on the city commission and it's interesting when mr
rinton dola was on and i wish i would have had the opportunity i was with some clients yesterday
for fifteen twenty minutes but i wish i would have been able to be in here with steve when he was on
the phone yeah because mr rinton dola always claims ignorance which in his case i think is
probably appropriate oh he didn't know anything about it he's got anything to do with bap bap bap
bap bap and all this other stuff okay never i thought he was the city manager he never votes on
anything yeah he never has anything he's busy with that band over there you know doing and doing
him hillbilly songs he's real busy taking care of business over in howland ale you know it's really
it's embarrassing because you people you fakers over there in howland ale i'm not talking about the
population i'm talking about the powers that be because i'm sure they're all listening right now
you may jackasses out of yourselves two years ago with this i mean absolute fools out of yourself
now i want to point out to the audience that this reading yesterday was it was this was the reading
for the first time in this resolution drafted by mr can that's not steve can the attorney for
the city of howland ale at mr rozenberg's request it will be read again and voted on by the city
commission on february twenty first that's two weeks from yesterday now that meeting takes place at
noon i guarantee that this program will be there this show will be there in howland ale two weeks
from yesterday the twenty first of february and you know something it's got to be an open meeting
all sure open to the public yeah and you know who else will be there i bet you a lot of people who
enjoy this program will be there yeah so it's not going to can't be one of these closed door
situations like they did yesterday where they invite somebody who's had an accident with the show
for nineteen months and been trying to destroy my career and three different radio stations that i've
worked on and they do it in silence and secrecy and then of course all of a sudden the media
are just happened to be there by the way jim gasser called said he did not write that letter from
that we read yesterday by valet parking so there's another interesting situation
hmm we've had a lot of mysterious letters like that have only with the pictures of names of
people who haven't been invented yet and with people who didn't write the letters etc huh yeah
he's going to be calling in before the end of the show it's in the note great anyway it's
suggesting credible just amazing how this town you know i've all had said this is the biggest bush
league town big hicktown and this is living proof of it i mean this show is so tame
compared i'll give you an example just compared to what we did two years ago and i and z
so tame that it's not even in the same ballpark and certainly compared to many of the fm
morning shows in this market and all over the country this show is like uh
allyson wonderland by comparison it's so tame so if it's not some recorded material that we're
playing that you know is a satire or a song parody it's uh talking about senior citizens
and joking about the doing something in a metamuse or whatever it is things that are said in
obvious comic satire that are taken by people and purposely twisted and manipulated around to try
to make it appear that were really just awful folks who shouldn't be on the air because they just
don't want that awful faggot on the air making all of that money it just sticks in their crumb and
they can't stand it they just can't handle it it reminds me of the Anita Bryant days
hmm we don't hate the center we hate the sin we love the center just don't say it get get back
like a good boy in your closet and don't say anything and we'll leave you alone get back in
cow or in your closet and look what happened to Anita yeah what go the round come the round
pass me the orange juice okay yeah ten thirty five and w i o d i want to tell you about h more
with neal roger on news talk radio six ten w i o d okay ten thirty nine at w i o d i put
i put the number on the screen roger roger just disappeared oh yeah it's on the screen see
i'm way ahead of you anyway we have a celebrity caller that we might be talking to momentarily if
he is there that's exciting okay a lot of people been asking about him the last few days great anyway
where was i before i was so really interrupted myself um you know i don't know really what more
there is for me to say other than the fact that certainly the harassment campaign letters to
everybody you can imagine from tim robby and sam jankovich and the university of mime hurricane
and everything else about you know we would some of the wildest accusations and i can assure you in
fact i have it right in my hand now a packet of letters and material for my attorney that are the
beginning of the process that's going to bring all of this foolishness to a screeching halt and
for the last two years i've been told by corporate attorneys and all kind of other attorneys well
ignore it don't dignified let it go away it doesn't go away and the irony of the whole thing
is that back during the election for date state attorney back last november and prior to it
all of these complaints were made against me and he's this and he does that and all this wild
weird stuff and janet reno in compliance with law because he couldn't have a conflict of entry
she sent it all to the governor's office and i was investigated by a special prosecutor appointed
by the governor and the fbi and the secret service everybody except the cia that you know i
i'm probably the most investigated talk show host in america and amazingly enough the special
prosecutors report part of which steve red on the air yesterday in which i have here uh not only
clears me and said there's absolutely nothing there but it says that the individual who made all
the accusations the same individual who spurred this halendale thing yesterday and has been conducting
this eight campaign has an obsessive hatred toward me and the show that was one of the many
conclusions and also talks about his abhorrent behavior in regard to that debate with janet reno
and that i'm not just letter that he handed janet reno which he read on the air yesterday with
the three boxes and just on and on and on so isn't it ironic that while i was the one being
investigated that this special investigator special prosecutor turns around and says hey
that rogers didn't do anything wrong and there's nothing wrong with the show but that this particular
individual making the allegations is the one got a lot of problems with and has an obsessive hatred
of this program of neo rogers and the public has a right to know and it's long overdue what they do
with all the microphones in here steve is here but um oh here comes roger now while i got a lot
you know mike has all those guests in the morning yeah you know they have that that cooking his mom
said it would be back in a half hour our celebrity caller here will be back and we'll give him a
call in the year that'll be exciting the one of a recent local radio personality who always
is good on a phone yeah not always that great on the air but good on a phone good for like from the
leaf outer i shouldn't say that that would be a plan huh okay roger just uh give me a confused look
like uh huh anyway uh there's Steve and Steve is sitting reading uh trying to control himself and
be common it's a very good dinner by the way last night i'm not sure uh if the people in
the newtros system are listening okay it's just this is not going to be the week okay lindon
Susan you're wonderful folks i'm not the great part of it is i really panicked this morning when i
got on the scale because i thought oh brother you know that i ate quite a bit last night and i didn't
gain anything okay which made me very happy i'm still right there where i was at the laniap
cage in house i can't mention that can i since it's one of your sponsors you can't of course and
also some of the uh help there were very interesting as well but anyway we don't want to give
that because it'll sound like i'm trolling for sex boys on here although they were all of legal
age i noticed i was very i'm very careful in fact now even before i look at somebody i make sure i
ask in fact i just like with my back to them i say are you over 18 if it's yes i turn about
i look at them if they say no i just keep you know moving in the other direction because looking is
also illegal you do understand that don't you really i so anyway i can't believe the uh i've been
shocked yeah about these statements that were made yesterday i love this what are you you are a what a
where it's here the one about Hitler the man is a Hitler with an on without an army
a self-hating homosexual self-hating you i mean nothing actionable there right and soon i'll be a
self-hating senior citizen soon i'll be a self-hating senior citizen i mean no defamation there no
how about this one Steve how about this one out of the sun sent no
who claims that rogers has harassed him on the air for the past eight yeah i've been harassing him
and calling his sponsors how about that how about his friends by the way that's funny that's not
about the campaign part about the campaign of harassment is that people who are friends of mine have
also received harassing and threatening calls and fat rich who comes in every Thursday and has
helped us in so many ways and sent out all of those tapes you know those awful tapes which this
individual also said we're obscene and pornographic and threatened fat rich because he sent him out
to the mail the postal service was going to investigate we only raised forty thousand dollars for
the commillo's house you know my favorite causes in the world and yet this individual tried to
attack that no matter what it is that i do uh... there is an attack made okay to try to twist and
distort and threaten and harass even fat rich who never would hurt a fly one of the nicest people
you'd ever meet in your life has received numerous harassing phone calls and threats and the goes out
to his car here and finds the car plastered with the letters and messages and the so on and so forth
which also will stop immediately by the thing i that i had to let over dinner what norm said that since
the show yesterday his office has been buried in calls of people who have been harassed and who have
been put upon who want to uh... yeah you know go on the record with it yeah uh... well i think
porn arms going to have to abandon the rest of his practice problem i want to hold him when i left
and he can have to give up the rest of that's really very willing to do oh yes more than
uh... and i think it's a bit of a pursuit this because it's obviously a grotesque injustice
and it's a really a sick campaign that's been going on for last couple years as i said a couple of
times you know you can mask it as anything else nobody is full on me they might be full in some other
people in the media temporarily because they've been able to legal manipulation they've been able
to keep this thing quiet up until now but there can be no question that this is a legitimate news
story is in the three different stories in this morning's newspapers in the herald and sun sentinel
and i'm sure it's gonna go far beyond that and then you never know there just might be some
imminent press conferences coming up in the very near future i can't imagine with him uh...
where there might be a lot more information disseminated to the people in the media so they really
understand what's been going on well this falls into what steve what you said yesterday on the air
that they do this kind of work these kind of people in the dark yeah they don't like it in the light
of day or when the light of them they like to be able to do it and uh... we aren't supposed to
mention them or make reference to them or do this or do that but in the meantime i think it's
getting a thousand thousand of letters get up in a public meeting and all you are self hating you
uh... and Hitler yeah but we can't do anything well yeah i love that word grotesque by the way
it's a fact that uh... it and i think the reason enormous of stuff but this is because it is a
seizure where grotesque manipulation and distortion and abuse of the legal system yes
that i think why he yeah see the average individual when they send a letter out and they say well
steve said this or neal did that person will look at it and that's a well good luck you know that's
joe shmo down the street when somebody sends a letter out on their legal letterhead uh... that adds
a tremendous amount of credibility of course course and uh... yeah and uh... what will be at if you
want to retain me uh... you know i'll get money for you which is a clear violation of the legal
code of ethics in which the florida bar i'm sure is not too excited about as we speak but that's
another story for another day so uh... may be i'm you know i think probably the fact that uh...
sunny rosinberg and crew in halem they'll decided to do this uh... you know what they say in every dark
cloud you'll find little silver line i think they probably in the long run will have done a tremendous
service unwittingly not by intent well i think the uh... from our conversations with normalist that i think the
this was a turning point uh... it was a misstep on the uh... part of the gentleman
well i'll be honest because now it is enabled us to discuss this as a new story we do it is
and to let the public know about what's been going on which they have a right to know because the
reason i have a right to know i have a point i try to make yesterday which i think is a very important
point is that while it would appear that this all this harassment is leveled against you and i
and in an effort to cost us our jobs or whatever it is really aimed at the public because
no question about this individual has a way you'll be going this idea this fascistic idea that any
group of individuals or couple of people can sit down and arbitrarily determine what community
standards are in a community of four million people well even more specifically that this individual
has his way you'll be out of my army i'll be out of my army he'll be happy and our audiences are
going to be the ones that are going to have to do the suffering so this is really
in an indirect way and maybe not even so indirect
directed at them and taking away the right to listen to the shows they want to listen to absolutely
that's absolutely true and of course if the born again right wingers had their way we'd have
twenty four hours of jim and tami fe baker and paul and jam crotch and i don't know about jimmy swaggered
anymore he might not he might not make the history but he has changed he is you know yeah he is
repented so it sounds like i think he's feeling the change it sounds like some people may come to our
aid it sounds like uh... said it's not about paul it's been called that it's the answer to people who
wanted to know the everything thing is that uh... there are lots of scullotons in the closet everywhere
and people who conduct these kinds of witch hunts and campaigns generally have a history of doing
similar types of activity with folks that they don't favor who don't agree with them and among the
many people who have fallen into this favor including yourself because you were mr. good guy until
you were doing court and they for me and then as soon as you say something that doesn't fall in line
with this individual's uh... all of a sudden i have a horrible plan then you have a terrible show
and you're a troublemaker and you're a racist and uh... and a liar of course and everything else
under the sun and uh... i have a feeling that there may be others who will come forward to have
experienced the same kind of witch hunts and the same kind of abuse uh... there is something interesting
and i want to be because norm and as i mentioned before it probably the sharpest attorney i've ever
encountered in my life he's just a tremendous guy and really knows his stuff well we're old buddies
you know we go way back norm and i do you stand for lunch with a jade do you think norm and i used to
go to college together that they you he really don't remember me but i think anyway here is this is
the preamble of chapter four of the legal code just cool it for a minute Spencer right on time we're
doing important business in here what shut up Spencer chapter four of the preamble and the legal
of ethics it says conforming to the requirements of the law in the lawyers business and personal affairs
a lawyer should use the laws procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate
others right right don't you think that's very clear right there i think very clear to me i think
that's uh... really good i think some people should govern themselves accordingly uh...
a spencer uh... uh... uh... where the heck have you been spencer come on i got some money for now did
you wash my car spencer or did you uh... boy look at us he's got rangers keys is
long and got a deal going in there he's not he isn't interested i've even got a ten here
Spencer i got the right change in everything and he still hasn't come in here as he
i think you know the strapped the spencer
there you have now there he comes
here's a lot of spencer i got your uh... ten bucks there for that'll probably take that to
go stream and make it into five thousand
i thought you i'm gonna give you half not all good that sounds better than you got two hours
still post-time uh...
by the way our horses yesterday finished eleven thand seven days that's not
back a seven eleven are two lucky numbers
so maybe want to take that ten over to seven eleven
it might be like it because you said yeah
and you do my car yet or you waiting for my money it's done for that's great here's a
guy even get even gives me credit
for about a half an hour yeah
and of course if i wouldn't have been here when spencer came in he would have
gone out there and thrown dirt on the car to get a dirty again
i know i know okay spencer thanks a lot and get out of here already
yeah i'm your friend spencer as long as i got those ten spots for you i'm your buddy
he gives me credit does he i watch him okay he moves around a lot okay spencer have a great life
ten fifty one a w i o d and speaking of gallstream we invite you to join me for a day at the
races b o d ten fifty five a w i o d okay and when we get back after the newsbreak we'll start
taking a call because lines are basically full now but i you know i want to make it clear to you
and i've said this a million times if you don't like what i do if you don't like what steve does
turn it off and steve had a great suggestion yesterday for the blue hairs in his town there is a
station that it all there are two stations really that exist both of them on by the same company
w lifeless and w o l d and they're both basically for a geriatric audience well life is not only
for geriatrics but also elevator music for people sitting in a doctor's office who have nothing
else to do and are paying much attention and w o l d is basically here the old line talk you know
couple of these old parts of called steve yesterday when you got a tremendous responsibility to us
we don't have any responsibility to any particular group we have a responsibility to be entertaining
and amusing and enjoyable and listenable to a large segment of the audience there are 40 signals
in this market and there isn't anybody in the world that's going to please everybody and in a
major metropolitan community one of the tremendous advantages you've got is the diverse choice
of signals on radio and in television so if you don't like program a if you find program a
objectionable and offensive very simple turn it off if we were sitting here making slanderous
remarks or doing things that were completely unacceptable outrageous that's a different story i
heard the one guy said well if you know you were maligning blacks every day and making racist
comments but we aren't and when i talk about senior citizens again and i already did this hour and
going to do it for the last time now okay on this radio station i do that disclaimer about the
fact we're not talking about all senior citizens and you don't have to be any particular age to
have the old fart mentality you can be 20 i have a question how about if we get on the air is that
my con is my mark on okay how about if we get on the air and call people uh and name them and
call them self hating Jews and self hating homosexuals do you think that would be actionable could be
maybe maybe defamation it might be it could be as Harry Kerry would say but anyway i want to
i want to get back to this point again to make you people understand that you don't control and
you're not going to control what any of us say on the air uh if you want to live with Joseph
Gerbelsen company and that kind of a fascistic or communist state then you can exercise that kind
of control and you know again all you got to do is stop and think about the really repugnant right
wingers on the air in this community we've got a whole bunch of them and always have over the
another repugnant to me some of you may find them wonderful they're very offensive to me they're
very repugnant a lot of the comments they make about liberals about Jews about homosexuals are
tremendously offensive to me i have never suggested that any of these people be taken off the air
that the public engaging campaigns to deprive them of a livelihood i can say that i find them
offensive i can take issue with their positions i can try to expose them for their bigotry and a
hatred that they spread that's fine but to try to deprive them of their first amendment rights
is outrageous and unacceptable give it to him Spencer stick it to him baby look at Spencer man he's
oblivious he's got the car keys in the money he couldn't give a damn less about this stuff uh
no i can think back when i was on k18 and i think back to the witch hunts in 1977 the Anita
Bryant days and there were people in this community like Shirley Spellerberg and Mike Thompson
and Alan Courtney who who who who airs some of the most grotesque there's that word again
some of the most understandable disgusting vile generalizations and stereotypes and and
mr. Thompson mic Thompson continues to do that by the way on a very routine basis yeah that's right
everything and yet i don't recall Steve or myself ever coming on the air saying gee the guy
would be taken off the air he should be deprived and opportunity to express his viewpoint so that's
what you have to grow up and accept and that's what the born again fanatics just can't deal with
quite to the contrary with mites and why i've had a lot of different differences within the past
i think it's important for people like mike and for that viewpoint to be on the air i mean how
dull it would be if everybody was uh and also so that we understand where some people are coming
from anyway that's it for the star the phones are full we'll get to you when we come back because
i see that there are a lot of people out there at least eight who want to say something
but the Henry Barrow's on a floor again and that newest newsroom and he's going to lay on the
hottest wio d news we'll come back at 1105 Steve this afternoon from two to six
cw i o d and broard or six five five and two seven eight wio d and the fall beaches
other areas make all collect the opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not
necessarily those of the station now here's neo rogers on new stock radio six ten w i o d
available it's 1105 at wio d at this awful terrible nasty show where we're so mean i mean you know
sunny rosen bergen intendolan and halendale city commissioner remind me of a bunch of school kids
okay like a bunch of little children he's picking on us and oh that's terrible and we got to get
him off the air we don't like him yeah i look at this headline and i really have to chuckle talk
host and halendale renew their bitter feud like like halendale is the centerpiece of my life okay
halendale is like a tiny tiny pimple on the asset progress okay that's halendale
i mean halendale is nothing i'm sure that people all over the world when they think about south
florida they immediately say oh yeah i'm going to go down to halendale for a couple of weeks
and that what you always think of when somebody asks you where you live like if you're on a plane
traveling somewhere and somebody says where you from he said well i'm from like around halendale
no no if you lived in no no don't you think they say port lauderdale or south florida no people ask
on you think they actually in fact i would like even if you lived in den you you'd probably say well
i live in halendale it's so much it's so much better known right next to halendale and believe me
before i'm through i'm going to make sure that it's well known again just like we did two years ago
they want to be on the map they want to be the city of choice actually what it is is the city of
hate i noticed and i'm not talking about all the people who live there because they're obviously
are some very nice people who live there are some but you know the powers that be you control it
and control the image of that city are going to make it into the city of hate again as they did
two years ago with this myopic narrow-minded unconstitutional outrageous disgusting resolution
and uh... just amazing to see a city body like that go after one individual which isn't
essence what they're doing we're going to get even with him boy
well forget now on the two day the twenty first of february is going to be that city commission's
uh... meeting when they're going to vote on this resolution at noon yeah great and we're going
to be there all right you're on the air or we'll have somebody else doing a show here we'll do
something but we'll be there uh... depend on it it's a lot of it a lot of the four-letter
good morning nail good morning yes you get it right on the head that this whole town is homophobic
i mean that is no i don't think the whole town is homophobic there are just a certain groups
and certain individuals who are extremely extraordinarily homophobic and you always have to
wonder about people who are so fanatical in their homophobic you have to wonder just what it is
that they're worried about or what it is that they're hiding well i mean you're talking to an
actual living breathing twenty five-year-old gay man and oh my god well stay out of hallendale pound
that's god forbid if you get anywhere near somebody if you look at them yeah they instantly look
back at you faggot faggot yeah oh well there's no question that we have a ton of that here this is
the deep south and uh... you'll find it all over the country but we have a tremendous amount of
here as we discovered you know eleven twelve years ago with the india brine witch hunts and she
she hit a raw nerve and a lot of people yeah yeah but you know the fact that this program has been
so successful for the last ten years now on different stations at a different time periods and
i've had so much success in the market indicates that the majority of people are interested in being
entertained and they're really not all that concerned about what people are doing in the privacy of
their homes or in their bedrooms and they do understand the difference between things that are
said on the year and obvious humor and so called trolling for sex on the air the interesting comment
about trolling for sex on the air is that i happen to know having been in this business for almost
thirty years that on music stations used to be one a m was music primarily and i want fm music
stations there are a lot of guys both straight and gay who do troll for partners on the air in fact
once upon a time not all that long ago i worked at a radio station where i can think of at least two
different people who were air personalities had sex with individuals while they were on the air
but i guess so long as it's straight then it doesn't make any difference that's okay sure all you
have to do is listen to that fabulous new station on fm and you hear them practically drooling
every time a woman call yeah and of course there are a lot of these guys that get like little numbers
off here which hey big deal i did a dating show for two years on a year at w snooze and we married
off thirty seven couples during two years and we had gay people and straight people and bisexual
people anybody that wanted to give their number out and meet other people as long as they were adults
it's a free country okay that's the bottom line yeah and we're not going to allow any group of
homophobic fanatics to tell me how to live or what to do or who's in my house or you know it's just
unacceptable and it's not going to continue yeah i i just don't understand a meal i mean
i work my profession i clean houses for ninety percent of my customers are old Jewish ladies
they adore me they adore my friends i tell them i'm listening with my red head said every time
i'm cleaning their houses to you and they say what are you laughing at my tell them Neil Rogers
and they go oh he's so rude but he's so good mm-hmm what are all these old parts in hell and
ill what what happens you cross the borderline to broward and they just instantly turned
yeah as soon as you cross the date broward line immediately there's a grain factor and that was
not getting i say grain factor that that takes effect but the thing is i don't understand okay
i've missed whatever the comment is about this hell and they'll counsel what do they think they're
gonna do pull the plug on you well that's what they would like it's never gonna happen but that's
what they would like and they're going about it in a very very um sub rows away and uh... i'm
glad that it made the media that we can talk about it here it's a legitimate news story and that
the public can understand that they're added again over there they tried the same thing two years ago
and the only thing that accomplished was let everybody know what a bunch of fools they are over there
in the uh... in the government of howl and they'll well they've got a crime problem they've got a
serious jay walking problem they got a horrendous traffic problem they've got problems with people
who live west of the tracks over there who happen to be not living in such great wealth and comfort
they've got all kinds of social problems like any other community has they've got a drug problem i'm
sure and yet they have the time to allow a fanatic to come in and spend forty to forty five minutes
attacking me and taking things out of context playing excerpts all geared to bring them to a
particular conclusion which they willingly did well it's you know the thing is that you speak the truth
and they want to live they want to live in their fantasy world that there's no poverty there's no
okay well listen i got to move on but have a great day in the taledol of mailed her butt the wall
okay uh... uh... but it's after eleven at w i o d eleven fifteen at w i o d now one thing that i want
to ask you know i think uh... probably we should have done this a long time ago
okay but there are a lot of people out there and if the making difference whether you're a plumber
whether you're a garbage collector a housewife or a doctor or a lawyer but we have a tremendous
variety of people who listen to these shows and enjoy them enormously and get derived tremendous
pleasure from them and uh... if you fall into that category you listen to the show and
Steve show a mic show in the morning uh... we'd like to have your right letters to us here at w i o d
they don't have to be books or volumes but just nice to get a note as a cross section
uh... to develop a file of these letters because there can be no question
looking into ratings that we have thousands and thousands of people out there who do derive tremendous
entertainment pleasure from these programs and uh... appointed at yesterday i'm not sure if you
want a cross-section of you know the the the fcc talks about community standards
uh... to do is listen to my voices and quite with me and i'm up a little early
uh...
all you have to do is listen to that show yesterday you know me i put
disagreeing calls to the front and it was all i could do to find four calls in the
course of the hours
uh... to even take issue well you know lately we've been getting a lot of notes and
a lot of letters from people in their eighties and late seventies say
uh... we enjoy the show
and we do understand the humor we you know we know the group of seniors that you're
talking about in that behavior we find it just as repulsive as you do
i mean it's a fact i mean this community is tremendously handicapped because of the so-called
senior citizen mentality and that doesn't mean we're generalizing or saying that everybody
over particular ages a bad person or acts in a horrendous way
but there are far too many of them who do who want this town to be an outdoor funeral
and who want everything to be geared toward them i remember the two times that i tried
frantically to work on a casino gambling issue because i think that if we had casino gambling in
this town man we you couldn't hold us back we'd be the number one tourist place in the world i
think if we had casinos and who are the people primarily who are opposing opposing it
uh... we know one it too much traffic and interfere with our lives and order for it to my
and the property value of the way up in our taxes on our condos all these selfish reasons in
other words to hell with a community or the hell of people are one jobs or the hell of people
who like to make this a thriving economic area so we don't have to have drugs is our number one
industry to hell with that just leave us alone leave it let us have our condos in our adult
communities and you talked about you know the thing with the with the little nine-year-old girl
and a bit show you did on the pets and almost every time it's the same group of angry
unhappy miserable old people who want everybody else to share their misery i love that call
i don't know if you're listening when this older lady called in yesterday senior says in eighty two
something like that and she said she was a regular listener to your show and she you know she'd
loved it and when she started listening to some of the things that you were saying about a certain
segment of the older people when you heard of yourself she examined her sub she's i realized
that some of those characteristics within within me and i decided i didn't want to be like that
and i changed it was an incredible call yeah and i mean not that we're here to change people's
lives or to you know do a public service we're an entertainment show but it's interesting how
people can grow and change to listening to you had no part of calling yesterday three or four
but you had one in particular was talking about the language that we use yes a bimbo i didn't know
that bimbo was sitting down bimbo douchebag and old parts and he was very exercise about that he
asked you if you went to a function somewhere and you met the lawyer or somebody in a suit would
you use that language you said no if i was introduced to a lawyer at a function and introducing my wife
would i use the term old fart yeah and uh... you know amazingly enough even bob gilbertson who's
one of the headhunchos at guy gannett which owns w i n z and zeta during one of the many conversations
i had with him about things that we did on the air and language that we used i used that term old
fart i said would that be objectionable you and bob keep in mind is a very straight-laced
conservative portland main mentality he had no problem with that whatsoever he thought it was
very very inane and meaningless and he wouldn't have no problem with it at all but the point is to
this particular individual and a lot of these people are living there ivory towers who never get out of
town never get out of the neighborhood that they're in a living there condos their super market is right
next door their drugstore is next door they have there they play their shuffle board right on the
premises the clubhouse if they could go to some of the other markets in this country like new york
where many of them are from a listen to the language that how it's during or scotch and or some of
the other people use on the air they'd say wait a minute what's this all about and they would
realize that we're like Lionel play world you know compared any of these other places knows
this team one guy asked me if the if the people in real life you know my friends and oh you were
like that i mean my god if i hear you the kind of language which ties in with you guy that called
her at the end of the show the from nova university you said that he and his friends sit around
and talk about our shows and one of the things that they've discovered is that they've tamed
downer language and they use fewer of the four letter words and now they've substitute a douchebag
and mung brain and some of the expressions that they listen to on these programs but you know so
so we obviously are polluting the minds of the youth of sound florida in credible but i don't
yet i think what we shouldn't lose sight of is the fact that what's really at the heart of this is
you know an individual's personal vendetta and that's really what it's all about a homophobic
personal vendetta and as i said before the idea that here is this out of the closet person who's
been out of the closet now for over twelve years in his market and been knock on wood very very
successful on five different radio stations and making just tons of money can't handle that just
can't handle that fact in other words if you go back in a closet like anita said and you shut up
about it and you don't you know you you live in cow in fear and everything that's okay but if you
actually talk about it and and you know you just go on as another human being who happens to be
whatever you are that's unacceptable to these people well it's i'm sure that was at the root of it
but i think it's important to understand that the maliciousness is not limited to
to know that that that's the heart of it but all of the other malicious and then it's then around
then it comes in my involvement is really interesting because it shows it has nothing to do with the
homosexual aspect of it it's anybody or anybody who doesn't agree this individual doesn't
why anybody who doesn't agree anybody who interferes on the path of this witch hunt right example tom jica
who is a good friend of mine and who's an excellent writer for tv and radio and has been for years
in a market at the news now at the sun sentinel tom jica had a week that and i'm sure he'd be delighted
to talk about it now that this is a legitimate news story threats intimidation threats over at the
the Miami news Howard Kleinberg and Dave Kraslow and just another wild witch hunt campaign all
sorts of wild phone calls calling him names on the phone because he didn't happen to agree with
this particular individuals point of view you see i hate to break the news to you and i know the
individual is monitoring and taping and uh... frantic right at this moment the world doesn't revolve
around your brain thank god in other words he he's everything the world according to him okay and
the world doesn't operate that way that's just i think back to that day in court when you came
and testified you were not there for the latter session this is also a public news story was in
the newspapers about my attempt to get an injunction and during the afternoon session for the little
time that the judge gave us uh... mic Thompson was called in testify against me and against you and
of course to a tell the world that uh... uh... you're a liar and you have a bad reputation as being a
liar etc and so on and and i think back to all of that and i'm listening to these two individuals
give their rundown on community standards and what is appropriate to be on the air and what isn't
and i realized that they feel that they're in a position to tell us what it is we can do on the air
i didn't know that they were the government now maybe i'm wrong but i didn't know that they were
the beginning and end of what it is that we can do on the air so i guess from now i will have to
check with them ahead of time prior restraint find out you know ahead of time what's kosher and what's
not but the interesting thing about the using the legal system because this is you know this is my
pet peeve using the legal system to harass people as you said there this individual listen to my
show for years never had a problem never had a problem never contacted a sponsor used to call me
at home my buddy my friend always you know you know yadding about you and stuff and what he was
going to do to you and how he's going to get you out of the market and then when under oath i
testified and then you became the back of the enemy you know that i got to stamp you out yeah now
i'm right in there with you and everyone am i spot well it's interesting how i love to find out
i'm sure we will probably in the not to distant future in a courtroom why at uh you know for three
years none of my sponsors were contacted and then all of a sudden at a certain point every sponsor
and ever again but isn't the same kind of thing that allegedly the objection was mostly a lot of
this recorded material and homosexual humor and so on that i did an i and z and then we went to
zeta and eliminated all of the recorded material the songs and the bits and everything and eliminated
almost all of that kind of humor and sexual anything i mean no sexual references at all and you know
something the harassment never stopped for one day the witch hunt never let up for a moment so
even after we took away all the material that allegedly was the objection the fact is the
the real objection is that here i am on the air and i'm going to do whatever i can to get neo-rodgers
off the air under any circumstances as he told me on several occasions and private conversation
but you know the old thing don't take it personal will the bottom line is it's personal take it
personal what's exactly what it is it's eleven twenty four at w i on d the silver anniversary

I heard the gunshot and turned around and I saw works for self-flow this children are cut up in a
deadly game they're playing with guns figuring senseless deaths tonight susan dot radio six tab
w-i-o-d eleven twenty seven at w-i-o-d but we only taken one call yeah well we're getting carried away
four-letter deal hello hi i'm here on vacation from trino and a relative of mine suggested i turn
tune into the station yesterday and i listened to it and i just it seems to me that these people in
holland they'll just need a new nose to pick and my parents are from a really senior part of trino
and i've never seen a bunch of root of noxious people when i've come here i'm gone into super
mercancy the way they carry on that is correct and these are the same people that probably wonder
where all the anti-stamensism comes from well let me let me say this to you they're not
me may i hasten to point out that not all senior citizens are jewish there certainly is an
element there are jewish senior citizens who fall into the stereotype but i i caution you that
when you start making anti-semitic remarks that it doesn't it's not very becoming no i know i'm
I'm just saying this is i'm in an area right now where it's probably ninety nine percent jewish
and the way they carry on is supermarkets fighting with each other i've just never seen that before
it just seems really strange okay i appreciate your call but again i read something there but you
know i have to be very cautious because then we went through that two years ago the same thing where
people start twisting into it's only uh old jewish people jewish women in particular will
behave a certain way and obviously it is not uh we have an open line in brown word five two four
nine four six three five two four w i o d del ray hello nil yeah then the phone i've been waiting on
the phone for an hour you know something you're worth it okay hey uh did any well we'll find
out a few worth it sir all right i'll give it a try uh did any of this crap rolled on hill and
splash on stand what do you mean by that well did stand major did his uh sponsors catch any
this arrest oh absolutely absolutely in fact the stand is a uh glannon stand and i were forced
pressured into signing a letter in which we agreed not to mention this individual's name on the
ear with the exception of a legitimate news stories which obviously this uh latest thing is but
there no question stand in fact stand show was being monitored and taped on a daily basis just like
mine because stand after all is a friend of mine and anybody who is a friend of mine is an enemy
of this individual whether it's fat rich whether it's tom jick or whether it's Glenn whether it's
Stan whether it's Steve and uh all of these people have fallen in the path and as you say the
wrath has rolled down on their heads that's too bad hey Neil no changes okay okay we have an
open line in uh bokeh 278 w i d 278 9 4 6 3 it's 11 30 and let's go to margate hello hi good morning
Neil and Glenn and steve are you still here steve is a wandering in the hallway okay um i know
Steve my name is Lisa i'm in margate and i've been listening to you uncle Neil on and off now for
about ten years and you know back when you used to do serious shows which i really enjoyed much
more to tell you the truth but you know as a broadcasting student i'm just i want to help defend
your and mine and everybody else's first amendment rights in and any way i can and if you want
you know letters to cox broadcasting is that who you would like to let us yeah or two or two or
to me and steve yeah or two of the uh station or to me steve whoever you want to send it to i'd
like to see copies of all of them when they come in but it would be nice because i know we've got
a tremendous cross sex many thousands of people out there and uh unlike what mr. Rosenberg says
they are not mostly morons you know i joke about the pinheads and morons but the fact is that we
got a lot of very bright people in all walks of life who listen to these shows get tremendous
pleasure and entertainment people who are out there on the road traveling salesmen people in their
cars for other reasons uh lawyers doctors you name it they're listening to these shows get in
and understand where we're coming from and are not offended by there's nothing to be offended by
now there is a it can we write like to the fcc or to the judge your turn no no be better to write to
us here just right to to cox broadcasting incorporated it is w i o d w i o d all right and also i
just like to point out that you know i i'm taking this kind of personally because i have a uh narrow
minded religious fanatic in my neighborhood who is trying to stop my right to buy penthouse and
adult films yeah isn't that great you see these these people uh they they live in this very uh
fascistic kind of world in which they can pick and choose they can censor they can determine
what everybody else can do what they can read what they can think what they can say on the radio
what they can listen to uh and the rest of us are not going to tolerate it which it's just not
acceptable all right well it's the first time i've ever called you Neil well i appreciate it
okay and uh you know you let us know what we can do and if we can show up at the uh city commission
meeting of February 21st we you know great i'll let you know more let you know more about that as we
get closer to it but i guarantee you we're going to be a lot of us there trust me okay we'll do
we have a good one bye 11 32 at w i o d it really is you know i am embarrassed more than anything
else for sunny rosin bergen at a bunch of clowns over there in hell and they are i'm mortified
and humiliated for them because to get conned into this which is what i mean willing
co-conspirators and i'm sure they were given a lot of material up front and then egged into this
and then sunny of course sing the opportunity to have a little vendetta and of course just recently
he wrote that letter south Miami magazine how could they possibly write me as one of the 10 best
jobs in south florida because i'm a this and i'm a that etc and so on and uh so he invites this
character to come and speak for 40 45 minutes and lead this witch hunt and distortion and take things
out of context and twist my intent uh it's embarrassing sunny i mean you're acting like a five
year old child and the fact that two years ago i made a monkey out of you then i got news for you
we got more people listening now and more support from sponsors and and this company by the way
cox broadcasting supports me and supports steve cane 10 billion percent okay unlike some of the
people i worked for in the past who were a bunch of nervous nellies and who every other day would
tell you different story we have the complete support of this corporation which is only worth
i don't know how many billion dollars but these are people of substance and people of intelligence
and people of character and they're not just going to turn over and play dead for a small group
of fanatics who want to turn our lives into a nightmare who want to harass our sponsors and interfere
in our business including sunny rosinburg so sunny i would suggest that you and your merry bunch of
wild men over there in halendale take care of the important things you don't like the outhouse gang
and all the other really big stuff that you have going on it's put halendale on the map
maybe we even ought to get the sweet and low police reinforced over there too while you're at it
it's 1134 at wio d we'll be right back d 1137 at wio d by the way the people who write these stories
for the local newspapers i mean they get these stringers and these other people have no idea what
they're writing about and they do such a sloppy job there's so many mistakes in the two stories by
light a longa who light a leader whatever that is a wideeat long-danced leader because i spoke to her
and don vanana junior at the herald for example don vanana says in the first in the second paragraph
wio d talk show host nea roger's trashed his favorite stomping grounds the city of halendale on tuesday
urging his listeners to call city hall and jam the switchboard hundreds of people did
nobody ever said anything about jamming the switchboard okay i mean if that's what happens
if enough people call that's a byproduct of people being outraged but uh... it's always interesting
how they like to characterize and they do these little in the heralds famous for this they do
little editorial comment along with a new story instead of just reporting the facts they throw
in these cute little editorial comments for example this three hundred million dollar lawsuit that
the individual has filed a federal court against me there isn't any lawsuit against me it's against
another company that i worked for before
not against me and that's here in the new story
unbelievable
and in light a longa or leader whatever name is uh... she's also got some well i need one to go
into the one about uh... this company in the uh...
i'm telling your folks the people who give you the news they're really on top of things okay it's eleven
thirty nine at wio d south may any hello
we're here at the supermarket right in kindle apparently a woman in our thirteen was trying to
purchase with cheese when she was brought by a group of doctor dot and supporters who feel the
ten-bundes use of which he's made up a
uh...
there's also a group of anti doctor dot and i can't
feel that listening to doctor dot and may cause people to compulsively be friend and videotape
other serial killers uh...
during one ten small and the woman shopping cart was going directly toward a mind the police officer
but thanks to new police guidelines he merely stepped out of the way
this has been a live report okay good job excellent uh... open line indeed where our uh...
wio d spy just called in seven five one wio d let's go to my amy hello
hello manil yeah good morning nil yes sir this is raja i just want to tell you that you hit
the nail on the head before these juvenile delinquents up in uh... how long they'll
the whole problem is they're just simply jealous of the program that you do have
i've listened to you for years and you was deep can't repair evases
i just wanted to tell you that okay thank you raja thank you it's eleven forty twenty
before they look at all the deadline just went out of once when raja disappeared
seven five one wio d seven five one nine four six three point and beach hello
hello nil uh... i've been listening to iod for about three years now and uh...
my radio and my truck i've even got a sprued so nobody can change channel for me
but uh... whatever one of the uh...
thing that's going on here with this thing here people people listen to you show
but they don't hear it
they uh... they take one word out of context and make something personal out of
well you know the interesting part of it is the overwhelming majority of people
who listen do here and do understand the humor and do understand how it's intended
because amazingly enough other than the city of halloween deal which is had a
vendetta against me for two years because of you know the light that i put them in
a couple of years ago by telling the truth
other than them and this other one individual
there is there's nothing there is nothing there in other words we don't have
any mountain of complaints or no who miss understand the humor or get been out of
shape uh... it just doesn't exist which is astonishing when you consider how
widely listened to this program is
they're just nothing there
no that's not it's it's wide open and open and you need to take it in context of
what it really is yeah
and it's uh... it's uh... you know it's stimulate the many things not just uh... one train the
thought
and uh...
i don't know it's
i had a lot more one to say but uh... it's just ticket
it gets upsetting okay well i appreciate your comment
thanks eleven forty one of the w i o d an open line in palm beat six five five could
you turn that down couple of degrees to
it is just boiling in here
six five five nine four six three six five five w i o d
do you think we could get uh... scatica's a rejoiner that says that when you
talk about
the old people it's not necessarily chronological it's we could get j michael's
to get a thing it's it's just a joe it's just a joe
that would want to steal jail jay's lines it would be the doctor vatster recorded
for us there's an idea
plantation hello
yet no plan how you don't okay
forty-nine year old straight-guy listed you a long time
i don't always agree with everything you say but
i'm entertained by what you do because i understand the humor in it
and when steve has one of his contrived debates of the story subject that i
happen to have a passing interest in that's why i got to the off-button
that's correct question button yep and i can change another station
really shocking yeah are you sure is that revolutionary it is i never heard of
such an unorthodox sir
well maybe i better patent that is in my car radio like i got two fm band
things that's like twelve eighteen different channels so i can punch up and
mine is always like in one place i can't get it moved
well i think you made me go over to sound advice and have a guy's look at it okay
yeah they're specialists in frozen dials yeah
look i understand the humor i support
you're right to do what you do and i don't necessarily like i said before i
don't necessarily agree with everything you say but that's not the point
the humor and the the entertainment is what it's all about
i don't think anybody should have the right to stop that that is correct they
don't have the right to stop it as they're going to find out okay you have a
good one you do eleven forty three at w i o d an open line and
brown word five two four nine four six three five two four w i o d we got a
mobile in pambi chello hello nil yeah my lips are blue what can you tell me
oh with the doctor's ear for you any minute it'll be right in thank you darling
be on your terrific don't let them get you okay take care watch those lips now
watch what you do with them my phone being as blue okay that's great
yes see this is what really gets to these old farts man is the see it hit a raw nerve if there
weren't any truth to it right then nobody would have ever cared you wouldn't have made the
newspapers all around the world but because there was so much truth in it because it hit such a
universal nerve in this town where we've been plagued by this so-called senior citizen mentality
for so many decades people just went wild yeah because they said hey finally somebody's got the
guts to expose this thing that we were all strangled by here so true so true he's an
nasty guy he used to be such a genius and such a bright boy but he's an nasty guy now
unbelievable my mother was I was at my mother's for lunch yesterday after all this frantic stuff
that went on here and I walk in the door and within two minutes her phone rang and she said hello
and it was like five seconds and she hung it up and I thought what the heck was this and she tells
me a story about an elderly lady friend of hers with whom she had a disagreement and my mother
was definitely in a write-on I was an incredible story a year ago or so and every now and then this
woman calls her up and gives her the raspberry a year ago and I said to her I said to her that is
exactly the kind of thing I talk about this juvenile behavior going back to your second childhood okay
an argument about something where the woman was totally in the wrong by the way but even assuming
she was right a year ago and the best she can do is every now and then call on the phone and hang on
that's a new meaning to the word old part yeah oh boy well oh here it comes all right I didn't
hear the call myself now perhaps when she calls and hangs up she says I didn't really
hear it myself okay we'll have to check it I will do a little investigative reporting on that
1145 at WIO did we got a mobile in Broward hello
Neil good morning yes sir two quick points first of all I just want to say that I'm real proud
you guys I think you guys are doing the right thing by saying what's on your mind even though
sometimes I and probably a lot of other listeners don't particularly agree in this case let me
say I really agree with what you're saying the second point I have is I have to have been a lot
of an error on Sunday night with my my family and a couple of friends you are so right about
sensational yeah one of the very bad absolutely outstanding I would even got me crazy in the
beginning was when I walked in I looked at the right and there's a picture of Neil Rogers I didn't
know you're such a good looking guy Neil oh yeah have a good one you must have been looking at
Stan always you okay later thanks I 1146 at WIO D I don't think that that was my type we have
an open line in Broward 524 9463 524 WIO D in Boko which of course is oblivious they don't
even know what we're talking about a 278 9463 now don't expect Palm Beach to come out
this is not probably in with John Levin 9. Oh, Pompano hello hi Neil hi what is the address
for WIO D just a Miami 33141 you don't need that street address or any big song in
advance is WIO D Miami 33141 wonderful and it's the same that they don't have
Yupi citizen specials I mean what about all of the upies out here everything's cater to
these senior citizens yeah what about all the young families with their two and three kids who
are trying to make it and squeeze out of living you know or people are sending two three kids to
college and trying to you know make enough money to make ends meet how come they don't get a
$2 movie or 99 cents special movie we can't afford to go out you know eat all the time and
have these movies everything cater to these things yeah and the sad part of it is a lot of those
people have got more money than God and living their six seven hundred thousand dollar condos
and spend every day going out to see what the CD rate is today you know that's their big past time
and boy don't don't take away their little discount man because that's what it's all about
yeah why does somebody have a drive to help out some of us younger people that our salaries just
face stagnant we get nothing ahead we're paying all these passes and what the hell they think
what happened if all of us young people moved the heck out of here maybe maybe some smart maybe
listen maybe some smart business people will start a younger citizen special and if you're under
65 they'll give you a discount yeah right you bet and it's too bad that those people on how they'll
don't have enough business to keep them busy where they have to disrupt our right to listen to your
show which keeps my day going and here we have to discuss this df when we could be entertained yeah
we could be having a good time you're right a good time and here we are listening to this crap
okay i'm with you thanks a lot thank you hey i got a conjure i got a question yes on this next
city commission meeting in hell and ill want to get ready but do we get to attend we're going to do
the show from there really they don't know that yet the norm didn't she her norm suggests that's
true i didn't know we're gonna go through it if we'll they know it now i mean there's just no way
they can keep us out these these are open public rare see yesterday's thing was one of these where
we had a first reading okay this resolution but then they have to have a second reading and have
discussion about it and then they will vote on it on february 21st and of course when that takes place
we're allowed to have discussion and i'd be delighted to have discussion with these people up
there because um you know that they didn't even tell us in advance that this is going to take place
they put it on the agenda and then they go and they make they allow somebody to make a 40 minute
attack against you without any possibility of being represented or defending yourself but that's
but that's see that is typical of the whole thing that's going on i had no idea of the campaign of
harassment against people i know and guess and stuff until my you know norm and went into the
file on this thing yeah and the the hate campaign against me is being this audience had any idea you
said yesterday and it's true if they had any idea the nature and number of letters on legal letter
head by the way to add some cloud to them that have been sent out to just about anybody you can
imagine there's a very nice lady who listens to this program a big fan of mine who happens to work
at a church in the community okay who called me one day and mentioned the church that she works at
well i was her first mistake because once she mentioned the name of the church and her name on the
air that she was on the list that she was on the list because she likes to show up so she and her
pastor received numerous harassing and threatening phone calls from the same individual we've been
talking about who did his thing in haldel yesterday and i just want the audience try to understand
the magnitude of this where a private individual who did likes to show is called and threatened and
her job is threatened and going to get her in trouble in a pastor in trouble because she likes to
show that's just like something out of the Joseph Gerberal school of broad kids it was that the
one where the individual threatened to turn her into the pope or something evidently i don't know
or turn her into a pope or something of that sort i don't know but she's not and to her credit and
she's a lovely person she ain't taking it sitting down and there's a whole list of people out there
who have been similarly harassed who also are not going to take it sitting down you know free
speeches one thing but interfering in people's lives and right to do business and their privacy and
making threats that's got nothing to do with freedom of speech or all illegal acts harassment is
another thing intimidation is another thing misuse of the legal profession is the other thing
a whole long list baby yeah eleven fifty one at w i o d char how does open now ready to do their
the eleven fifty five at w i d we got a mobile and broard hello hello no uh-huh it's
so i'm here with my friends and i'm going to take a selfie to capateria okay we want to say hello
to carol fellsman how is your effort then we want to say hello to carol fellsman oh my my
powder is a huge powder deal i don't use this the sticky stuff okay take a powder pound we have an
open line and broard five two four w i o d we got a pay phone and broard hello no yeah
third time color okay how you doing okay fine thanks hey uh oh you guys are great i know you know
this is a thawndale thing you know you can't tell these people if you don't like it you got to
you know turn it off you know how long they all didn't get the message two years ago i just
we didn't give enough publicity you got into papers all around the world from the Philippines to
try it at the united kingdom i mean you name it you got a particular layman from you know explain
you get a client in a piece of paper yeah and i think it's put in something that they'll
understand the language they'll understand yeah crayons in piece of paper may fit right in because
this particular individual we're talking about who spurred all of this yesterday very often sends
the notes in crayon man and red and uh you know so so maybe that's something they can understand
if they don't like to show you can't tell me it's like make the comparison if you don't like the
sweet and low don't take it take regular sugar oh that's a good idea no if you don't like this
particular place is early bird special you don't have to go back and eat it oh well that's
kind of revolution that is shocking yeah no they don't understand this radio business first of
all their fingers are all mangled from you know they're all excited i tried this condition they're on
the dance well i don't know where they've had some of those fingers you know could be something else
i'm not sure yeah hopefully in hallowedale of the city commission they move around the top
of the city uh do you see the news is falling on tv no uh yeah they had an ad for the uh
the senior hall show and advertisement and uh they had a little trip from her all they'll be in

going to the dentist because they are afraid of the drill i couldn't care if i find a time i get
through with issue i'm ready for the drill okay but the drive the traffic over there and then they
they're building where they drive around looking for a parking spot and they stop if somebody
if somebody comes out of the building they stop and they block off traffic assuming that they're
going to go to their car and open up a spot you know and people are hawking their horns and
swearing at each other it is going crazy over there so anyway one of the nurses who works for
my dentist tells me always these horror stories about trying to get from one side of hellandale i'm
not talking about my foot by car like like over to the diplomat mall on the other side of the street
you can't be done it takes like 45 minutes yeah to get across that street could be better for walk
problem yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i'll she got to do is get a cane or a walker and go out in the
middle of the street and hold it up and stop traffic and that generally is the way across the street
in hellandale but boy see this is one of those cases where we hit a raw nerve because of the truth
in hellandale that's the problem a raw nerve right sunny uh-huh a raw nerve

yes sir i'm calling from south my amy to gateway to hellendale and uh i'll be nice to me sir i live
down there too now come on okay well that was the nicest thing anybody's called you at the
lot that was wrong with that well you don't live in the city of south my amy yes i do you do
serious pleasant living though that's great yeah another taxpayer that's right uh by the way we
understand that the ojis city commission is having an emergency meeting to discuss whether this
program should be allowed to continue in light of these scurrilous comments i've made about ojis
over the year well i suggest that to get on the agenda for the february 21st meeting it's probably
required that you uh either call or write to get scheduled first yeah well i'll leave that up to
Norman can i'm sure Norman knows just exactly uh storm and norm will take care of all of that
okay because the commission in order to accommodate the you uh uh you know they should accommodate
everyone since mr t is not a resident of rauin they gave him three quarters of an hour yeah that's
kind of interesting that uh kind of a carpet bagger from another county and i mean a distant part
the southern part of another county uh would come and speak to a commission in brown county rather
unusual isn't it well a whole proceeding was bizarre at best well you know this this this guy must
to t he reminds me of a guy you go to the movies uh comes out and goes to the box office and says
he didn't like the film and he wants everybody's money back excellent excellent in fact mr t
i like that yeah well we have mr x why not mr mr x and mr t and mr z we got them all man we got
all the letters covered uh you don't suggest that we previously call mr t's law office no i
certainly do not quite the opposite i suggest that you uh leave him alone okay but uh i make that
very emphatic let's let's deal with uh where it's going to have an impact okay there's an old saying
where where there's no sense there's no feeling okay so don't even waste your time okay well well
well we'll see mr t with his chains on hopefully he'll be at the meeting at the 21st because i'm
sure a lot of your listeners will be there i'm okay i'll try to make it okay depend on it
thankful i'm also will be giving out bumper stickers this sunday and trade winds park and coconut
creek of benefit for the browered humane society and uh maybe i'll even take some along to gals
stream park on sunday yeah and you're like that uh by the way that's uh trade winds park in coconut
creek sample road in the floor to turn pike this sunday browered's best friends classic and antique
car show excellent okay 20 past noon at wio do we have an open line in date if he move it up too late
they didn't move quickly enough damn darn maybe it's the hellendale digest call again to get the
story behind the story the ellen Courtney program

in a nutshell that's it that sums it all up yeah oh yeah there's something to paper
wow and was there really some guy there yesterday wow i didn't embellish oh that's where to
god okay well let's move on to four-letter hello hello yes sir yeah my name is ron on

the concept tape of some of your material they played that song you know how andale
wasting away and how and away oh yeah very provocative song yeah okay now they had the camera
on him as he was playing it and then when one one part came you heard like a snicker and they
moved the video tape up real quick and here's one of the men on the commission panel laughing
with his hand in front of the space and then when he put the camera with my hand
now listen if you got that tape yeah sure do we need that tape desperately okay okay and we'll
be more than happy to give it back to you so we can make a copy but if you can arrange to get it

okay sure take hold on incredible so we'll actually be able to view this that's exactly what we're
looking for now we wanted to pay this a penny of the minutes so yeah yeah that's great
well this is tremendous but i mean seeing it of course we'll have all that much more impact
sure especially the scene with the one commissioner just in hysteria over that song yeah we know
how are you guys kidding over there huh oh i talk about having a little post-pubescent fun that's
what they're doing over there now can we take parts of this tape out of context and like edit them
together yeah yeah in fact we can show sunny speaking and then we'll put the part where the other
commissioners laughing hysterical cut after and it'll fit in real great 23 afternoon at wio d
think about like 1227 at wio d and uh yeah we're just talking during a break about the fact that
these elected officials in hell and they are going to have to face the public again soon i'm not
sure when somebody will call it and tell us when sunny in his crew of a commissioners are up for
reelection and maybe i'll move to hell and there and one for mayor don't go now don't go crazy come on
don't go that don't have a real just get like a temporary residence well i have an ant who lives
in hell and they'll write on a one a in a beautiful condo maybe i'll move in with her or maybe i'll
just move her out and i'll move in there it's a really great place right in the ocean and i can
say hi to sunny every morning when i'm walking the dogs 27 past noon at wio d and let's go to
chucky and my amy how you doing chucky how you doing now okay listen man don't let these people
get to you i know it's not but uh not getting to me i'll tell you that if i was able to survive 19
months of abuse really and now we're finally thanks to our antagonist when a position where we can
really bring it all out in the opening because it's a major news story uh you know i'm i think
it's great yeah well let me tell you my grandparents and all lived in hell and they'll and i say lived
they moved out because they said all those vehicles cagali trozos which is old blue hairs
yeah uh they just couldn't stand they say so chucky they just couldn't stand anymore so now they're
living next to me and tendle oh yeah so that's an improvement that's a step in the right direction
yeah they have to deal with the traffic now they can move to homestead and really have it made you
know yeah out there with the uh raccoons in homestead yeah listen when is this meeting going to be
there and you know i want to i want to go Tuesday February 21st in halandale and we'll get we're
going to get all the details that's two weeks from yesterday so we got plenty of time to put it
together we just had an offer from our friend joe from tassie with us we're the caterer
our affair that we will have over there uh you know provide some sweet and low and some great food
well what a turnout we would have huh that's good i have to get off my diet just for one day
something special for sunny too over there you know we'll have joe put a little something special
together the waffles or something yeah yeah all right neo well listen i'd like to call my boy tata
douchebag anyway okay chucky all right neo hang in there pat yeah maybe some ex-lice flavored
halivar or something like that would be good for the commissioners over there um um um
29 past noon at wio d we have an open-line in date 751 9463 751 wio day it's just amazing that
we're back to this auto for gins like is witchner would say it's like desi rules isn't it i was thinking
the same thing so everyone should pick up a herald or a son sentinel day and there's whole stories
in there of course you don't we have been remiss in doing something today and not so
we didn't give the number for the halendale city commission and again we don't want anybody to be
abusive or to harass anybody but no question about it because the call on steve show yesterday
made it very clear that no emergency calls go through that number of that switchboard they're all
routed through hollywood so don't let anybody give you song and a dance but certainly since the city
commission has injected itself into a situation that evolves the radio station is not even in the same
county and in an issue that is not in any way related to the city halendale then obviously we have a
right to protest since it affects your right all of you in south Florida within the sound of our
signal to listen to the programs so you should give them a call and let them know that at 458 30 251
458 3251 is a number for the halendale city commission and you might want to get some information
about that meeting on fibrillars to find out the time and all the exact info you can pass it
onto us we'll have our wio d spies doing a little work for us while we're sitting in here having
lunch in a few minutes right yeah okay here's a pay phone in my emmy hello hello Neil
yes sir how you doing great yeah okay well she's here picked the right guy I'll tell you that
1231 and wio d we have an open line see I got my line on the air he didn't get out which is great
yeah we have an open line in bokeh at 278 even I like that one yeah me now 2789 463 278 wio d boy
he's a guy you know he called you a couple of days ago and I was on the floor because you gave him
it was a I don't remember what the response but when he said he wanted to buy a dildo for his girlfriend
and how big should it be or something like that and you had a classic response with you I don't
remember but it was just I was on the floor it was tremendous same guy yeah so he's obviously in
that general area he's got some problems I think it was something that he should get a lodge
would to compensate for the pea size yeah something like that it was a classic four-lotter
day hello how are you doing fine I'm trying to laugh really oh you got to hear you got to hear
the whole call you have a little more spice out of that yeah yeah you're lucky today's your lucky day
yeah I guess so I'm your guiding light fan yeah but have you seen it lately you're not going to
believe it no I've been avoiding it is my impossible because I'm so confused with Serena and
what's her sonny I don't know who yeah well see I have to watch it for you I mean I just have to
keep up on the stuff so I'm forcing myself to watch it I feel like when I watch at you I feel
like Raymond in rain man I keep asking who's on first because I can't keep up with it well as you
you have you seen the latest with Fletcher and Alexandra no better becoming a couple now oh no
no they were kissing the other day some believable and the thing with sonny's now coming out and
she's trapped with Riva in a burning house well and it's real getting done by think they're
bringing back Roger remember him from a long time ago yeah oh sure he died years ago yeah well
but that never stopped him from bringing anybody back before I think they're bringing him back
because they're showing in fact they ought to go into hell and they'll get some new characters
because there are a lot of people walking around there who died years ago they could bring them
on the show speaking of psychotic um sonny and uh solita that that whole thing that's coming out
with with them I think is I hope her exit I hope yeah that would be great the show I think I
would I would pay a lot of money for that yeah but um this thing with how and out I'm really I'm
really upset that that they're doing this well a lot of people in the audience ought to be upset
because it affects your right to make your own free choices and are trying to hassle me and get
me off the air just like the Catholic church is done twice and just like this other individual
doesn't a never-ending vendetta well because they just don't they can't handle the truth they have
no sense of humor they can't handle the truth no no and they want this just to be their town where
you can only say what they approve of it like I said it's like something out of Nazi Germany I
know I didn't even know you were allowed through there without a border path yeah but I think it's
I think it's really terrible that they're trying this again I mean you've had this for so long you
had these people that have been against you and and working up to yeah and guess what guess guess
what I'm still here I know I know I'm still top rated we're making more money than ever before
and life goes on I just wanted the best things of all is that you have just taken this at adversity
and just run with it I mean they're giving you such great publicity by doing them oh yeah
and they did it two years ago they did two years ago and they never learned their lesson so more
power to them yeah well just keep hanging in there and just keep doing what you're doing because
I am one of your biggest fans and I have been for many years and I just think you're great
I think you should have a talk show on TV thanks a lot bye bye yeah I should have a talk show on
Helen Dale cable TV yeah well there must have been what she meant I wasn't talking about her I was
thinking out loud you know so I could talk directly to my fans in Helen Dale
there's somebody sent me an article here this is from model magazine with an article about Jason
Gedrick oh boy wow anyway it's a time to tell you that the Valentine's Day is going to mean an extra
thanks boy that's good Carmine you're the you're just a miracle man is what you are yeah he makes
life worth living in this part of town in North Bay Village hmm yeah we might have a
crumber two for Nick left in here too there's enough food for a hundred people here just take your
choice okay here's a Broward call here hello hi Neil yeah as you were given the number to the city
of houndal I was calling and I got right through and the lady answered that the switchboard and as I
was mentioning Neil Rogers she said hold on let me get you that department and she connected me to
the city clerk who said that I asked her what exactly time the meeting starts on the 21st and
well they usually start at 10 the morning will run to wait just in time for the start of our
show I'd and they can run up until five or five thirty and I said well is it set then for February
21st and she said no the agenda hasn't been set yet I said oh well something was in a paper
concerning this and it seems like it was already set for the 21st as she suggested me to call back
and after the city manager's desk so you might want to give that number again because I didn't get
okay the number is 458 458 3251 3251 okay I'm going to call back then the city manager's desk and
and find out exactly because no need guys they're going to turn around and cancel it and you know
just you know you know something give you the right one they can keep doing that as long as they want
and we'll be there okay every day until they decide to have the meeting I mean they're only
going to do it on a Tuesday because that's when they have their meetings I see and they can do it
every Tuesday from now till health freezes over I see or they can drop the whole silly thing and
apologize for it and go on with the important business like they should be doing exactly and stop
trying to mess around with my life exactly also these commissioner meetings are televised on
self-care cable for those people who live in hell that's correct so they can watch it excellent well
from now on we'll have people a busily taping while they're on yeah and I just want to say one
thing to my lazy brother Randy he's at home he's he's not even working here and I just got to say
hello to him okay so long there is he a dish bag sir no he's just a lazy bum okay okay
later thanks 1243 a w i o d another one of our spies there a little info we have an open line
in brown word 524 9463 524 w i o d forces could huh I'm having a great what is that is that a calzone uh-huh
it's really delicious hmm never had one of four is oh everything they got is just
tremendous best in the I tell you one thing we should get treated well you know what we sure do
between pizza loft we're talking about the people who bring photo over here in Joe from tap street
and considering your phone from siam's dog you're such a bad guy yeah i can't understand it
and the stuff from the armadillo cafe oh god i just think about that and i go nuts
just i don't want to leave anybody out but there just have been so many of them
and a old friend red who used to bring all those great pizzas by in the other joint oh yeah
west pond beach hello hello yeah yeah this is rath from west pond beach i'm on vacation i'm not
sure yourself very much you know i agree completely with the pre-speed a few but an hour ago you had
a gal on it was you know going in heavily into the Jewish people or something in the supermarkets
and you know and dieting everyone which i didn't think was right and you questioned you against it
yeah that's right but only this a couple of weeks ago you made what i thought was kind of a sweeping
generalization when you said well you were doing a commentary some pre-smallest of a couple boys
and you said well you haven't met a priest that doesn't malice oh no i didn't say that at all
sir sir sir you want to have a conversation because i don't like when people put words in my mouth
well you have to joke i don't sure sure it's a joke that i used on a year i've used it for years i
says if anybody ever met a straight priest called and that's a joke now if you don't know the
difference between a joke and an obvious ethnic slur well and maybe we need to give you some
instruction your authoritarian to people they take it as a sweeping indictment of the whole
priesthood no sir they don't because people listen to the show know that it's a
a comedy and entertainment show okay yeah okay you want to be offended by it more power to you okay
okay good enough okay bye 1245 at wild we have it open line in palm beach 655 wild there's a
perfect example of what i've talked about people and hear what they want to hear oh yeah okay
that's for sure you notice he started out by putting words in my mouth just like somebody else we
all know and love around here putting words in my mouth twisting and manipulating my intent a
alleging that i said that you know all priests are child molestos
incredible and then by the end of okay all right because you got nothing to back it up with because
he knows he's wrong and he knows that isn't what i said and isn't what i intended
for a lot of deal hello yeah yeah what you want to speak to us you're just going to play games
what's up my amy hello hi i've been waiting for so long the phone spoke to my amy well we had a lot of
intelligence you had to be like these last two callers this is marna okay marna how you doing okay
i haven't spoken to you in such a long time well i'll be darn marna and i can't believe that someone
just mentioned about the i 95 yeah it's your favorite this is marna from steves isn't it all right
i'll be damn i'll be dying we never need to decide that my name someone just came in the other
dance remember that you know i always speak with you i'm making your name and i think here i am
well governed yourself accordingly marna used to send us over wonderful pizzas at i and z boy
does for the days i know that i haven't heard from you i knew you were on a diet and uh and i
i didn't know how you made out i went up north for a while and well i lost 31 pounds so far
marna i'm still still doing fine i mean him both of them i'm doing great good okay have a good one
deal you tumor it's good in there by by 1247 at w i o d we have an open line indeed no we don't it's
ringing already the open line is in palm beach of course six five five nine four six three six five
five w i o d you know one of the guys one of these pseudo intellectuals are called steve yesterday
and these are the guys you don't have the guts to call you know speak to me face to face because they
know that i'm not going to sit and take their abuse but he's saying well neal deserves this because
you know he's done this he's done that let me tell you something okay no matter how much you
dislike anybody on the air no matter how much you disagree with what they say no matter how much
you despise them personally or what you think of them personally the bottom line is nobody deserves
to be harassed to be threatened to have all of their colleagues and friends harassed
and irritated and threatened nobody you know nobody in this country should have to live like that
and that's been going on for 19 months now so again in your own minds even those who despise me with
a passion or dislike the sure whatever they're coming from going to have to separate your personal
dislike from what we ought to be able to do in a free country okay and that's unfortunately what
they can't do in halemdale they hate me with a passion i made him look like a bunch of fools two
years ago which believe he was not difficult at all was easy pickings and now it's like well here's
our chance for a vendetta we're going to get even let's pass another resolution let's interfere
with the station and with neal you know and if you think we're just going to keep sitting back and
taking it lying down you're wrong you're wrong and that also goes for the instigator involved in all
this too who thinks that he can continue operating in the dark without any spotlight shining on what
he's doing without anybody exposing this malicious hate campaign that's been going on it's all over
pal the parties over and the warm has turned and now that all the investigations of me and the
attacks against me now let's turn it around a little bit and find out where this individual's
coming from and what he's all about okay right what's this all about what are the real motivation
so the other people who are directly or indirectly involved in this oh yeah now let's start
looking you know from the other viewpoint 1249 it's 11 to 1 at w i o d and the sports channel has
got it all man i'll give you an example of the kind of great eventual mis if you don't have the sports
channel on your cable tonight it's 12 53 at w i o d right in the middle of lunch in case you wondered
and they're doing some exciting things over here in the room next door so if it sounds like the
whole world is vibrating you'll understand they're just doing a little little technical work there
remodeling reshuffling fort lauderdale hello uncle nale yeah i have a great hairlandale story for
you i think you'll enjoy okay my mom used to own a travel agency down on howlndale beachable
fort right near Gulfstream so in our office she used to have a water cooler that she used to have a
coffee pot there so you know these people from howlndale once in a while you know they'd look in the
window they'd see the water cooler in the coffee pot and you know they come in and they take their
coffee their water whatever and my mom you know she's kind of easy going she never said anything
and you know there's maybe like two three people a day that she used to keep a box of
um nondairy creamer a box of sugar and a box of sweet and low uh oh that she couldn't
understand why she was going through a box of sweet and low every week so what had happened
i guess they started telling their friends about it oh yeah more and more people
so one day i was in there and i had a drop start walking to my mom and his old man walks in
he was probably about 140 he comes shuffling in the door and he has an empty one gallon milk container
so i'm looking at him and i say to myself i can't believe what i'm seeing what this guy is going
to do you walk over to the water cooler it starts showing up this empty milk gallon and i walk
over to him i said excuse me sir but this is not a public water fountain the guy totally ignores
me he keeps pulling up the water i grab him by the arm i calmly escort him out the door i grab the
water container from him and i throw it halfway down how and they'll be full of it the guy gets
all excited he calls the police oh god police company office i told the cops story the cops
left he walked it off and he left and that's a typical howl in there for you that's it in the
nutshell you got it i just thought i shared out with you and i think you're the best so hang in there
and don't worry about nothing okay we're not worried believe we're having a great lunch
hang in there and there see you later all right thanks all right okay of course because we are
having lunch it means uh little music can't hurt right so the savage beast uh uh
including sunny and rj and all our good friends over in the city of choice
coming up cheese cake
it's making that music
all of the old folks off at the mall
they're checking the seats
no they never say please
just waiting for the early bus special to come
wasting away again and good old happy
searching for the false teeth they left in a glass
and how did they claim that there's a talk host to blame but they know
is there on their phone
okay
just as hard as they came
and one's where I's heated
They get overheated
I start stuffing the roses we're lovin' at best
Wasting away of getting good old high
Looking for that long lost power of you
And how did it say that it's for all of the proves a date?
But for some, and then I'm mind the blues
Your folks don't know the reason
Why nothing is pleasing?
The muscles ache and the teeth just don't fit
But what doesn't matter?
When they call up kneeling chatter
I hate you kneeling, never listen to your shudder
Wasting away again and good old high
Just to find the metal musulet I'm ready
And how did it claim that it's for all of the hopes to play?
But kneel no
They can't wait for his shudder
And how did it claim that it's for all of the hopes to play?
But kneel no
They just can't wait for his shudder
What timing, boy? I'll tell you that's the end of the hour

Oh no, oh my god
You remember when Channel 51 had the adult movie?
Yeah on TV
On TV, that's right
I didn't even get it
We had petitioners, these groups, little groups of old people
Coming around with the petition
To try to get to...
I mean, I want to tell you something about those people
Those are the same ones who used to sit in front of the set
And tilt their head sideways so they could see between...
So they could see between the swiggly line, okay?
Believe me
They came to my house with the petition
I didn't have it, right?
And they, you know, what you saw in this petition
That's it for what?
They're showing adult movies
Oh yeah
As well, you know, I don't get it, well what I saw
But they wanted me to sign a petition
For something I didn't get, so somebody did my wanted
Couldn't get it
Incredible, I couldn't believe it
Yeah, that's something you had to pay for
Yeah!
Specifically, you had to pay for it
Well, don't confuse them with the facts, okay?
There's nothing better to do than to try to make everybody else's miserable as they are
Well listen, I wish you guys the best and I'm 39 years old and I guess I'm in your demographics
But I love your show, listen to you every day and I'm home sick today and I'm still resting
Okay, we appreciate you better
Okay, better, thanks a lot
108 at WIOD in open line in Lantana, 655 WIOD
Get that off of there, it's disgusting
Turned up a little louder, girl, Trude
Are you people listening again?
Boy, you can't turn it off
Yeah, I know, they can't turn it off
And just like I said, it reminds me of the women at what was that MacArthur beach up in Palm Beach when I was there
And they had the big two, because they used to be the nude beach
And there were these big talk condos like about a half a mile up the beach
And the old women there started a big stimulus about the nude beach and they finally got it illegal to be nude there
Because they used to stand on their chairs with their binoculars
Look at that, it's disgusting, look what they're doing out there
That's them
And every once in a while they'd fall off the chair
And then they would want to sue MacArthur for the all kinds of insanity
That's it
Okay, here is Fort Lauderdale, hello
Hi Neil
Hi
Got a hell of a deal update for you
Okay
It's going on the agenda on Thursday, February 16th
And you can pick up a copy at the City Clerk's Office
You mean they meet on Thursdays also?
Well, that's when it's going on the agenda
That's when they make up the agenda for the first day
And you can get a copy of it if you want
Well, that'll give us five full days to make plans
And for some of the reasons they want to know what your name is we're calling too, but of course I can give it to them
Really?
I don't just tell them what you're supposed to be
Well, I don't be half what I'm supposed to be
Yeah
But pay this is better than the soap opera stuff
That is correct
Great
Thanks for the info
We'll be there
Okay
Thank you
Nine minutes after one at WI-O, they probably have to bring my bodyguard there too
Mm-hmm
Depend on it
Oh yeah, I'm just reading a little note
I mentioned before if you want to write letters of support and you're just fed up with all this crap
And this attempt to harass and suppress and censor
Then write to a Mike Disney our general manager expressing your support
Because you know, I see you have a file of living and breathing people
And just send to a Mike Disney general manager WI-O-D
Miami 33141
That's Mike Disney as in Walt, you know same kind of clown
WI-O-D, Miami 33141
There's some spaghetti in there by the way
Where is the case of
I just brought by, he just happened to be in the neighborhood when he heard that
Flora's brought 400 pounds of food
And there's a calzone in there I think
I had one of those, I'm so incredible
Oh, there was sauce here for the calzone, you didn't even open it
Not necessary
Mm-hmm
And there's some canolies
Oh boy
Richard Castellano just left, he said don't forget the canola
Here's a mobile and point and beach, hello
I think, are they going?
No, no, this is a point and beach at a pay phone
Oh, it says in a car, well, yeah you're nitpicking
A car, a pay phone, portable phone
Yeah, I'm a truck driver and I run around all the way up to Jupiter every day from 4 Lauderdale
Uh-huh
And I gotta tell you, I listen to you every day, Neil
And I can't believe what these old parts are trying to do over in Howlanddale
I really think it's a pity that they don't have better things to do with their time
And to pick on a radio talk show host who most of South Florida really enjoy
Yeah, pretty childish, isn't it?
Yes, it is, and I also would like to say, you know, I'm a 27-year-old heterosexual male
And I identify with you completely, I have no problems with any of these allegations that they make against you
And by the way, it's really none of their business, what you do with your life
Exactly, exactly, you know, just like somebody sent me a picture in Jason Gedrick here in his article about hot properties
And I gotta tell you, this picture is fine in my book, okay?
And if there's anybody out there who doesn't like that and thinks that all gay people are gonna cower in a closet
and be submissive and continue taking abuse for my handful of fanatics, they're wrong, baby, because it ain't gonna happen
Yeah, you're right, and I'd like to have one other thing also
This morning when I was driving my car to work, I have FM and my car, I don't have the truck, but I have FM and the car
And apparently they don't really miss you a lot because they're playing a lot of your stuff and they're using a lot of your phrases
Well, I have one thing to say to them, okay? Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready
Have a great day, I appreciate it
Well, I just wanted to call and give you my support and tell you that I want, behind you, 100%
and I'm sure most of South Florida is
Thanks for meeting
Bye
Probably it's after one at WI-O-D, and of course it figures that most of the people who are listening now
love the show and enjoy the show and Steve and what we do on the station most
Which is one? One?
And there are a few massacres out there who hate it, but they realize that without the show they'd have totally empty lives, they have nothing to do
And just a very small handful, that's the real shame here and the real crime is that we've got a handful of fanatics
And I mean just a tiny handful of people who want a deprived view of your choice of what you want to listen to, who want to dictate to us, what we can do, what we can say, what we can talk about, where we can work, and it's a lot of crap
It's fashions and it's worst, okay?
Moving right along, I bet you they love this sponsor too, there's still time to win your Valentine's Heart and Soul and more, stop into Patties Place only sexy things for your someone special
And Pattie by the way, who's the Steel Rogers on News Talk Radio 610 WIOD
115 right on the nose at WIOD, Steve will be along to the 6th, I assume with open phones today
Yeah, yeah, good guess
Let's go to Miami, hello
Hello Mr. Rogers, this is Patrick J. Lions with the CIF organization
We're recommending that until this prices is resolved, the City of Hellendale be placed under Marshall Law with a 10 am to 2 pm curfew and media blackout
Good thinking, pal
Thank you
You got our support, our serious, serious support
We have an open line in date 751 WIOD and Palm Beach
Hey Palm Beach is blank, how do you like that? Is that a shocker to you?
Like I said, they could be dropping neutron bombs in the middle of Lake Worth and Palm Beach would still be open
655 WIOD, 6559463, Miami, hello
Hello, how are you?
Okay
Hey, let me tell you, ever since yesterday I've just really really been flabbergasted by what's happened
I think the word is apoplectic
Well, alright, apoplectic, alright, I'll drink to that
I'm not surprised there's nobody in Palm Beach today by the way
Also I wouldn't be surprised if there was nobody in Hellendale today
I want you to know I'm going to the meeting on the Tuesday if you need a bodyguard I'm available
I weigh about 300 pounds
Okay
And also I think that maybe the people in Hellendale what they should do is go with the media blackouts
From 10 to 2 what they should do is contact WGN Chicago and get Wally Phillips to broadcast to them
Yeah, there you go
That'll be right up there, Ali
Yeah, I don't know what would happen if Steve Dall and Gary Meyer ever come here
No, I forget, don't even mention those names
I mean, you are Wilbur Whitebreak compared to them when they were back
That is correct
And that's why this whole thing about community standards and about all the stuff that I allegedly do on the air
This show is like white milk, okay, or vanilla pudding compared to Howard Stern, Steve Dall, and dozens of other contemporary broadcasters
All over this country in major markets and you know the bottom line is this a bushly town
That's why we have to go through this most any other place in the country
If I did this material on the air there wouldn't be a whisper or a peep from anybody
Truly, you know the funny thing is that I get very angry sometimes at your agendas or the way you will act on the show
But that doesn't stop me from listening to you, you are entertaining and that's why I listen
Okay, I appreciate it
Just remember, take no prisoners
Okay, all right
17117 at WIOD and we have an opening in date if you move real fast now 751-9463
And that's flashing, Boka 278 WIOD 278-9463
Maybe even Veggie will call in
Come on, be careful
No, just a joke, he called before with a message and I just freaked out
Make that call to say that yesterday he didn't call to be on the air he wanted a bumper sticker
Well, we're not giving out the bumper stickers yet Veg
And I'm sure that even though you want us to you know change your whole agenda for your personal convenience
But we're ready to figure out a way to do it, we'll let you know
Don't joke about that, maybe he'll call
Don't even joke, you can't joke with that
Oh boy, excuse me for that sneeze on the air
Oh, what?
18118 at WIOD and we got a mobile in Miami, hello
Hey, Daniel
Okay, hey, that was good sneeze
You're a lot better now, yeah
Yeah, that was a good combination sneeze
Listen, I think that on that meeting you should bring a brother Paul and all the homeless people that benefited from their $40,000 and see what they had to say again
Well, this particular individual who's harassing me in this station even attempted to intimidate fat rich because he sent the tapes out
Now here, keep in mind, here we raised almost $40,000 for the homeless
They bought a van to transport these people to Jackson, get a medical treatment
And it was just one of the most positive things I think I've ever been involved in in my life
And the guy is trying to twist and manipulate and distort that whole effort too
Absolutely, that gave you an idea of just what lengths this individual goes to to try to create problems for me and anybody I know
Anybody who disagrees with his warped view of the world
Absolutely, here's the one who's doing some good for the community
You're not helping out Texas for goodness sake, you're doing some good for the community
That's right
And he wants to put an end to it
I got a good blue here for you
About four months ago was in Atlanta, was in a shop in center called the Lennox Square, I think it is
I can't remember the name of it
And I'm walking into the mall and I see this one lady, an older lady in an old Cadillac waiting for a parking space
Well, before she can pull in, here comes this young kid and a nice little little see-out and pulls right in
He gets out of the car, she gets down and says, hey, I was waiting for that space and he goes, well I'm young and fast
So there you go, she gets back into the car, plows into his car
Chums over and says, well I'm old and rich so go call the cops
And I said, that's the epitome of all these old people
You remember it was Meg Green, it was her daughter, remember that?
She told us that story about her daughter having her car keyed by this old fart because she took a spot that she didn't even see him there
And she went to the spot and he claimed he had been there first and started a big stink
And he keyed the car when she went inside
Oh boy
At Christmas time, with Jesus
At Christmas, really, just your good cheer and stop Florida spirit
Well hang in there, near, I'm right behind you
Okay, thanks all
Start to speak
Yeah, we got it
Bye-bye, bye-bye, we have a 20 at WIOD, we have an opening date so to speak at 751-9463
Let's take that bokeh call, this could be interesting, a Howard listener, hello
And Neil
Hi, I recently moved down from New York and you were talking about Howard's show in New York, the people down here would have a stroke
Let me tell you something, I've always said this, Howard and I think Howard's hysterically funny on his good days
There's some days he's a little ponderous but he can be tremendously funny
But Howard wouldn't last five minutes in his heart because it was such a parochial bush league town
And they'd be screaming and carrying on a mat, you know
They would run him out, they would run him out on a rail
He would do lesbian, dilate one time and it would be all over
Absolutely, they would have sent his video down here, run his video on cable
Yeah, there you go, into Halondale on that
I was silker cable in Halondale
Absolutely, well keep it up, Matt
Thanks a lot
Right
121 at WIOD on your tame station, 610 WIOD
That's your tame station as opposed to the other talk station which we call your lame station
Anyway, we have it open line in Boka 278-9463-278-WIOD
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Don't you understand that everybody who comes in and participates, what are you looking for?
Food
So something you lost
So something you lost
News copy, isn't that incredible?
There are a lot of ladies who come in here looking for something they lost like their virginity
But they never found it again
Huh, I don't think he left it in here
Now it's not in here April, oh excuse me
Ah, 22 past 1 at WIOD
And I want to tell you about a great place for a great deal on a great car
A lot of greats in there, right? I said it in VIOD
Hello, I'm Saul
And I'm Harry
Here to tell you about a special place
Just a short little drive
From New York is the Pocano
Let's go
That's where I want to go to get away from it all
There was that in the Pocano
It can feel empty
I love that stuff
Play shuffleboard if you wish
I got a nine, go for Saturday brunch
Or buy the food on top of your dinner
I hope it's kosher in the Pocano
Skytop and Barquill
Camel back in Warchill
Mannelly and Johnny
They're even making Rooney
I know
Let's rock and let's go
Oh, relax the pumpkin in the Pocano
We'll have some lunch and then we'll see our show
Restown in Orlando
In the Pocano
Get a hot shake, huh?
You for the champagne
Sit by the pool and act like a club
Let's get the chicks who get me in a skull
Over by the exercise bar
Hey, cue the overhate in the Pocano
Skytop and Barquill
Camel back in Warchill
Mannelly and Johnny
Don't forget making Rooney
Play rock and let's go
Oh, relax the pumpkin in the Pocano
We'll have some lunch and then we'll see our show
Restown in Orlando
In the Pocano
Let's go if I get the chicks
I know I got my teeth in the little bag
With the water in the evidence
All right, try to calm down everybody
127 at W. I.D.
Like a bunch of little children in here fighting over a lunch
Okay, there's enough for everybody, okay?
Yeah
In fact, the riches drinking the sauce
Look at that, they brought like a galima sauce
Riches drinking and writing out the container
Susan and Linda, you're wonderful folks
But not this week, okay?
This is not going to be the magic week, all right?
It just isn't, just one of those things
Okay, let's go back to the cause
We do have an open line in Bokeh
If you move real fast now
Like kind of like they do in Hallendale at the Digest
278-9463
278-WI-O-D, Hollywood, hello
Hello, Neil
It's kind of hard to follow if I'll fall in Harry, you know?
I know
I'm not sure you're going to reverse
I don't know if you saw it, I know you don't get the herald
But in Sunday's herald, Rosenberg?
Sonna
Yeah, wrote a letter to the herald
Praising the Hollywood City Commission
And their Gestapo code enforcement
For going out to 441
Because somebody had more than two American flags
Turns out that's violation of city ordinance
Oh yeah, that's another one of those really important things
That people like Sonny Rosenberg get involved in
And you know, that's the sad part
When you got a bunch of these condo-commando types
And they're in positions like mayor and city commissioner
All you get is the same kind of thing
You get in the condos
You know, they're worrying about all the nitpicky things
And the big things, the real problems
Are way beyond their scope to deal with
So that's what they care to, they care to the old people
Living in condos
That, you know, they get more votes per square mile than the people
That are actually living in breathing
That's right
Rosenberg actually said he, actually said in his letter to the herald
That he went from county line all the way up to 4 lottery
On county at the amount of places that had more than two American flags
Oh yeah, I'm glad that he's got a rich full-life officer
And spends his time, no wonder he and our good friend
You know, have so much in common
They've got rich full-lives
And have got so much spirit time to do all these very important investigations
Thing is, if he got over 10, I wonder if he took out the shoes to count
Ha, ha, ha, ha, good point
Yeah, excellent question, we'll have to check it out
This is true
Okay, Neil, hey, good luck, man
Thanks a lot
By 129 at WIOD, we have an opening in Broward
524-9463-524-WIOD
We could be really having a good time today
I guess we're having a reasonably good time out of the circumstances
But this is, it's ponderous, man
What are they ever going to learn that it's just a tremendous waste of time
And a lot of money and a lot of hassle
And it just ain't going to happen because I'm not going anywhere, okay?
It just isn't going to happen, sunny and others
So you're going to have to reach over, I know it takes a lot of energy and turn the dial
Oh, no
You can be sure that those geriatric old Farts in Halendale on the City Commission
They're all listening right now, and they're all just sucking it right up
That's right
Boca, hello
Yeah, Neil
Yeah
That's just one of your geriatric lessons calling for boca
Bad accent, pal
At this time, yeah, I just wanted to say that I think that you own, you know, this frozen bomb
It's running a little, little something, you know, because you're thinking, you have your arbitrage and rating
Yeah
This is a big rating promotion
No, yeah, evidently listen, more power to them
It is a pretty bad accent, this is a tab, I just want to call it a say, hello
Hey
What's happening
What a terrible accent for a radio pro like Tanner, by the way, there's some pretty filthy stuff you're doing too, pal
We're going to do something about it
Cut the crant, Tanner, you're next
This is a bad big head that says filth and puts a frequency
Adenia City Commission is meeting about you
They heard about your antica attack the other day and they're pretty p-oat about it, pal
How come we haven't heard from you in a dog sage pill?
Well, you know, I have to drive the car up there, you know, it only has FM radio, somebody said AM radio
Now, I'm about to be working better, I'm suspecting myself to taxi or abuse today, you know
And I'm not listening and you guys raise the calories, I saw that article in the paper, how ridiculous
Yeah, it's not incredible, they got nothing better to do over there, they're going to try to get me off the air in Halendale
They should live so long, you pardon the expression
What if the ancient news could raise up something to code direction over at Halendale?
Yeah, we're going to try to work it and create a null in our signal so that we like, there's a big lobe
I don't know if I can say that or not, but like a big lobe right around Halendale and we can avoid it at all costs
I think you should do a promotion like, you know, maybe give away a sweet one with your name on the back of it, your picture
Yeah, there you go, what a guy
You guys carry on, you'll find a listen too
Okay, clean up your act, Bill
I won't
Bye, Bill Tanner
Amazing
What?
Oh, great to hear from him
131 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward, if you move real fast
524-946-3
524-WIOD, look at this Johnny Dolan's water, it's right here
All the radio superstars are showing up at the same time, God can we handle the pressure he has?
I don't know, I don't know, man, it's one thing to hear from Tanner, but when Johnny D walks in the studio
Would you like something to eat, Johnny?
Oh God, don't ask him if he wants some need, looks like he's having Rosemary's baby or something for a froward
Just to cut the crap, leave him alone
Stop spreading all this stuff around, besides, no, please put your clothes back on
Okay, let me just look at my picture, Jason Gedrick, leave me alone in peace
Anyway, if anybody wants to know where we get a lot of that really sub-rosa material, Johnny D
That's right, that's right
Look right at him, man, there he is, he probably stole it all from I, 95
That was exciting yesterday when a guy called in and played that tape of Rosemary's squirrel on the show, that was good
That was incredible, yeah
I wasn't really role, it was a poor man, a real junior
It was a squirrel junior, yeah, that was really good
Anyway, it's 132 at WIOD, the Boca Line continues to be a vacant just like the community up there, 278
That'll be next to Boca City Commission's gonna go after our ass next, man
Who there?
They're gonna nail us in Boca
You betcha
Because they're pretty sick and tired of us picking on Boca, 278
Everyone's freezing in the station
9463, are you freezing?
No, very comfortable
I'm not better, you know, their blood pressure is all pumped up there
It's just not working anyway, if you've ever been turned down for a load, 137 at WIOD
Everybody ready to collapse now, it looks like lunch is pretty well cleaned out
Yeah, pretty well too
Okay, let's take a few of these calls here before we mosey along to the news at two, which is only what, 22 minutes away
I thought I'm in a hurry right now
Four Latterdale, hello
Hey, Neil, how's it going?
Great
Ann Bird, too
All right, so listen, it's been a great show
Yeah
And I guess I pick a bad time to go on vacation
Oh no, we're here
Oh yeah, you're gonna have to rearrange your plan
Yeah, there'll be so much excitement going on next couple of weeks
I know, it's screwed me up because I was gonna leave for Saturday
No, no, no, you'll get your priorities straight
Yesterday before the show, we'd have to be there
Now that the closet doors are all wide open, man, there gonna be a lot of excitement going on around here
Oh boy, well, I gotta go on this vacation, there's just no way out of it
Okay, well, Colin, where are you going?
We're gonna go up to the mountains, up in the Smoky Mountain
Oh yeah, well there'll be phones around up there
Okay, well, Colin's collect, Colin's collect
I gotta tell you a story though, real quick
Blue hair story
Yeah
You know that, I don't know if you wanna admit that he's been through hell and deal before, right?
Non-occasion, yeah
Since they put up that fence
And decorated with like...
Oh, no, on the Boulevard, yeah
Yeah, on the median
And you know how it's like a rickety rack fence
Yeah
And they decorated with some trees and stuff, I swear to God
About two weeks ago, I was driving through there
And there was an old blue hair guy with a cane
Bent down between the two in the middle
Climbing through going to Albertsons
Oh geez
Well, I don't know if it's Albertsons, but he was crossing the street
Yeah
And I just roared, I beeped my horn, gave my thumbs up
You know
But I had to call it in and...
Well, you know, that's sunny, he's got such a sense of humor
Yeah, that's incredible
I think it was sunny
Yeah
Now that you mentioned it, well listen, it was great, I'm out of material
I'm gonna vacation, I'm gonna miss all this
Well, you call us collective, there will stick a little pin on the map or wherever
Well, we have to find a new stand to pick up the papers, you know
We're good luck to
Yeah, pick up the Helen Dale Digest up there
It goes nationwide
It comes out on Thursday, right?
Every week, good luck to you, have a good time
Okay, take care
21-2 at WIOD, we have an open line in Broward
524-9463
I have something, I just discovered that was sent to me by our good friend, our Pactor
And really, this is from the New York Times
You don't mean chronic Pactor, do you?
That's right, February 2nd, 89th of the New York Times, date lines, Spokane, Washington
Billy Tipton, a jazz musician, lived life as a man
Appearing to have a wife, adopting three sons, but a secret was disclosed when he died
He was a woman
One of the musician's sons, John Clark, said he had not learned the truth until
January 25th, four days after Billy Tipton died at age 74
Now, they said he was a saxophone, a piano player, and he performed with the Jack T.
with Jack T. Garden, Russ Carlyle and Scott Cameron Bans
Then he formed a Billy Tipton trio in the 50s, played nightclubs throughout the West
Dico Nioh who played drums with the trio for 10 years recalled that some listeners would joke that Billy
with a baby face and a high singing voice looked too feminine to be a man
New York Times kid
140 at WIOD, man, I tell you, you won't pick up this news on WIOLD, I guarantee you that, okay?
Stayed stations, and all you old farts who just love this show, you know, you just don't get this kind of good information
Like that old douchebag that called up Steve yesterday and he said, well, you people should be educating us, you have to inform us
We don't have to do anything, sure, we do whatever the hell we want and if people like it fine, if they don't like it, go away
And obviously you like it because you're hanging on every word right now, okay? Who the hell are you kidding?
So loosen up the hold on it in a bag and have a good life, okay?
Okay, let's see what we have here, okay? This is a nice letter on the facts flooding in here today.
That's great. Thanks, Rich, for that story, that was great.
Okay, let's move right along here, we got a mobile and Broward, hello?
Hey, Neil, how are you?
Great. I just want to tell you I support you 100%. I lost track of you when you switched stations a little while ago, and I'm glad I found you again.
You lost track?
Why for me?
How did you lose track?
Well, I didn't know what you moved to, that's all, so I started switching around a dial and I never was dial a D before and I picked you up again, I'm happy as a frog.
Great.
So I just wanted to give you a little bit of advice, okay?
In that, if this state needed an animal, it would certainly get it in the grand canyon of Helen Dale.
That is correct, that's where they would stick the ato, you better believe it.
Just good luck to you and keep it up, okay?
Whatever you need, I think the people who are here were smart enough.
Just remember what, just remember when you came back from Denver, it was 21 below zero.
Just remember one thing, you don't say keep it up in Helen Dale, okay?
Just keep that in mind.
Let their heads flow all here, okay?
Thanks a lot.
142 at WIOD and we'll move along.
Why do I keep saying it lately?
I keep saying that over and over again, it's annoying, it's ponderous.
I noticed.
Well, I'm beginning to notice and I'm getting sick and tired of it.
We'll be right along.
My Hammy, hello.
Hi Neil.
How are you?
Hi Bird, this is Mercy from Kendall.
Well, Mercy, Mercy.
Hi there.
My son was waiting to speak to you but he had to go to school and he left me in charge of the phone here.
How old is your son?
72?
He's all enough.
Okay.
I'm holding off.
Uh oh.
Anyway.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
Well, I just meant that if I gave you a sage, I would give away mine.
Oh, okay.
All right.
So anyway, I thought I'd give you a call to let you know that we all back you up.
150%.
Great.
That's good enough for me.
Even 140% would be pretty good.
Also, I wonder, I'm sorry enough to run the next week.
Yeah.
I don't want to give you a call.
How's that?
Yeah, please.
Can I do that?
Oh, by all means.
In fact, if you get to meet the queen, be sure and call us and let us know how things are.
You know, or if you just run into any queen over there, give us a call.
Yeah, boy George.
Yeah.
I will give you a call.
I promise.
Well, of course.
You can have a third day of Friday next week.
Excellent.
Have a good time.
And good luck.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
143 at WIOD.
Aura, this show is so international.
I wonder, for example, if the Vale Colorado City Commission is holding a meeting either of
the...
Get me off the air because there's so many calls from Vale.
I don't think there's any question.
Of course they are.
And I can understand that the federal government...
I don't know what they called it over there, but the board of something...
Are they in East End Bull?
Just having a nervous breakdown about this show.
I got a card from her to today, by the way.
Lady you call the other day?
Miami.
Hello.
Yeah.
I'm Neil.
Yeah.
How are you?
How are you doing?
OK.
Yeah, I was glad.
Just great.
Boy, this is a great call.
My girlfriend smokes camel food.
Yeah, I know.
And that's the same guy with the dildo problem from before.
Is it a Hollywood hello, yeah?
Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Great.
This is so unbelievable.
I can't believe what's going on.
I know.
It's almost like we woke up and found we were in Nazi Germany
or something.
Well, yeah, very close to it.
That's kind of what I was thinking when I read this in the paper.
That's a good picture of you in the paper, by the way.
In a hero, yeah.
Yeah, must be an accident.
Is it recent?
Well, let me take a look at it.
Yeah, I think so.
Because you definitely lost one.
No, it's not recent.
It's an old picture because I'm wearing those stupid headphones.
It's a very ancient picture.
Yeah, I think it can forget the crate for housebreak in the dog.
Just cross the city line of Howlandale.
The dog should dump right there.
I think that's it.
I think we're going to invite all of people from plantation
to take a morning trip to Howlandale every morning.
We're just saving up and well, never mind.
Yeah, there you go.
I had a quick blue hair for you that I think
that they're going a little nuts with the green stamps.
There's like a run on public through the green stamps.
Yeah, yeah, so to speak.
I was about to check out and I had a very big order
and I get a lot of green stamps.
And I do save them.
I am saving up for you to buy a car with my green stamps.
Oh, yeah.
And this way, must have been working the aisles or whatever,
the check out.
And she asked me, pardon me, are you going to be using those?
And I had a lot and I tore them in half and I gave her half
and I kept half.
And she's still standing there and she says, what about the rest?
And I said, why?
She goes, are you going to be using those?
And I said, well, yeah, I'm making a quilt out of a my, you know, what can I say?
I couldn't even see what's there because I didn't give her all my green stamps.
Now listen, you should have told her that you just needed one more book
for your gold lame anima bag and she would have understood.
She could have related to that.
I was so thin anyway, well, maybe we can get freeway and figure to show up on the 21st.
And that good idea.
Yeah, so I could tell her now.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
Turn to about.
Red house doubt.
Listen.
Stand for dawn.
Hello, what is warm?
I'll say you are coming your often.
Pardon me?
Have you been here before?
No, first time.
What's your name?
Freeway.
Freeway, that's not it.
One spigot.
We have to meet you.
Bigot's right in here.
You were here to get a queen or what?
Oh, I don't know.
You were work around here?
I'm a waiter, but actually I'm an actor, you know.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know.
What's the top of it?
You probably need to rely on it.
Oh, how say?
But you know, with everything that's in the news and all it's to pay, you can start relaxing right now, freeway.
I brought something.
Ooh, she, huh?
Freeway, not just any she either.
Look, wow, gold lame.
Pretty geek condom, huh?
But here's the most important part, freeway, in the ProTech label.
ProTech, huh?
I don't think Doris brought the City Council of San Francisco.
Absolutely.
You know the ProTech slogan does.
I sure do.
Certified safe by the City by the Bay.
Well, what do you say?
Darn, look at that.
I dropped this soap again.
I'll get it.
You bet your life he will.
And with confidence.
Because freeway and spick it have condoms.
Don't let worry, spoil those chance meetings in public showers.
Always carry ProTech.
ProTech, CROC, DPP, TMI, FreeSNB, CROC, DPP, DPP, Dendab with no apologies.
ProTech, CROC, Dendab with no apologies.
Don't doubt, know what it's all about.
The ProTech, CROC, so they won't send you a free ProTech condoms.
I division of Black, Black, Housing, Dundas and Goldimages.
DPP situation, safe since 1887.
What a 48 at WIOW.
Do we have a celebrity caller on the bat line?
Hello.
Hello, is this Neil?
Yes it is.
Neil, this is Jim Gasser.
Yeah, Jim.
I understand there was someone had sent a letter in reference and used my name.
Your name and address, no less, yeah.
My address as well?
Yeah.
What did I, I didn't hear the show yesterday.
I was at work on that one.
Well, they alleged in a letter whoever wrote it that I stiffed some valley parking guy somewhere
and that I parked in Fort Lauderdale.
Right.
That they had run a whole bunch of valley parking things at some of the better restaurants in town
and what a cheap skate I am and how I parked my own car and I stiffed.
Which really offended me because I'm probably one of the most generous tippers anywhere.
And only a couple of times I can think of I've avoided valley parking because I didn't want people driving a particular car, you know.
Is this recent?
Is this happened?
Allegedly according to them.
And I don't, it couldn't possibly have happened because I haven't been eating in restaurants for three months that I've been on this diet.
Well, I've been out of that.
It was, what is true now I used to run parking concessions for a long time.
Yeah, it's been an interesting.
I've been out of it for five years.
Yeah, well somebody must have known that.
Somebody you know and love and used your name and you know.
Could you send a copy of that letter to me so I could follow up on that?
I don't, I threw it in a waste basket.
I don't have it.
There isn't any, you don't know where it came from or what restaurant it could have possibly been.
No, no, I have no idea because it just, you know, it just had your name and address in the return address and it was just signed with your name.
So there would be nothing even if I did have it.
I don't think there's much you could do with it.
Do you recall the address that they used?
No.
It was on, I don't want to give the exact address on the air but it was called, the Alt Ocean Mile.
Right, that's where I lived.
Yeah.
Over on the air now.
Yeah, we are.
Oh yeah.
Oh, okay.
I didn't know, I thought this was not up.
Because I had a call on the, on my machine, when I got picked up my messages.
For me?
Well from you and from someone else in the station then some woman called, they've won a clock, 105.
And of course, we were swearing on the tape.
Oh, that's great.
Which now when I had heard someone else mention to me that my name was on there and my name is, you know, I'm in the real estate business.
Yeah.
I am not in the parking business at all.
Right.
And my name is important to me as far as the record.
Well, I'm sure of that and we apologize for any inconvenience but again, somebody used your, you know, I had no way of knowing that.
And very often when somebody writes us a letter and it appears to have a legitimate name and address, we read it on the air because once they write it to you it's open to the public.
Oh, I'm sure I can appreciate that but don't you have a research department at that verifice and make sure?
A research department?
Or just somebody to verify that the letter is for real, not a hoaxes.
No, well, we did call you.
We did call you. That's why I wanted to discuss it with you and left the message because you weren't there.
So we were trying to verify but it would nobody there.
Right. Well, you need to, I mean, I can give you the office number.
Like I said, I'm really...
No, no, don't give any numbers out because we're on a year and there's no, please don't give out any numbers.
It just that somebody, I wouldn't get too hysterical about it.
I mean, you've cleared the air. You've made it obvious that you didn't write the letter and I wouldn't make more out of it than somebody who's trying to do a prank on you.
Okay. Okay.
Well, as long as I... Like you said, I have cleared the year on that because I was not too happy when someone called and left the message and said,
this is not thinking, well, who could have done anything like this?
Yeah. Well, some not out there, obviously.
You know, we got a bunch of... Each one of us has got somebody out there, you know what I'm saying?
Well, I can... I appreciate that.
Okay, Jim.
Well, thank you very much.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Well, it's over done with now just as long as we have it cleared up.
Okay.
Thanks for the call.
Thank you, Neil. Bye.
Bye.
Bye, Pete Darn.
151 at WIOD.
I want to tell you about char-hud right now where you're going to have it.
You're like a reflex reaction and a routine way of disarming somebody.
You know, well, if you hate it so much, if you hate Neil and you can't stand it, whatever it is,
you hate Steve, you can't why do you listen?
But there's really... We're not really doing service to the question when we dismiss it as a cute comeback
and a piece of repartee.
There is a real question here.
Because as you follow the development of this and you'll probably...
I don't know for whatever reasons the people who hate Neil are less inclined to call on his show,
maybe they don't know where they can't stand the heat or whatever.
And I am willing to deal with these people at length.
But it is obvious there are great many people out there, elderly, young or whatever,
that hate Neil's guts, but you can tell when they call in, they listen.
They don't miss a minute of it.
And what I want to ask you is, you know, we talk about the free marketplace.
We talk about the idea that the... If you... The true censorship in this business,
you've got to get that back.
Like, I don't want... Is that a vacuum running out there in the hallway?
Or I mean, what is going on out there?
I feel like I'm in the middle of a cleaning day at the mall or something.
Surely there's another time they can do that, like during sports talk.
Is there any way we can handle that?
I mean, if I've got to live with it, I'll live with it.
I mean, I'm not going to walk off the air, but maybe anything we can do about it?
Yes. Okay, good.
Because it interferes with my train of thought.
Where was I? See what I mean?
What was I saying? I don't even remember what I was saying.
Do you remember what I was saying? What was I saying?
Nick's going to bring me back to my... Before that stupid vacuum cleaner went on.
Oh, why do you listen? Right.
I knew there was something like that.
The free marketplace... This is a commercial radio station.
This station is in business to make money.
This station makes its money by hiring people.
Hopefully we'll give it ratings.
That's why they hired Neil Rogers.
That's why they hired Micronary. That's why they hire Steve Cainz.
That's why they hire a sports talk.
That's the name of the game as we say in broadcasting.
And the one thing that will get rid of Neil or get rid of Steve or get rid of Rineria,
get rid of any show eventually over a period of time,
is when people don't listen to you.
If you are boring, if you are tired, if you...
You know what I mean? And that's the name of the game.
So if you don't like Neil, don't listen.
Don't write him down in the book.
If you don't like me, don't listen, don't write him down.
And if enough people are like that,
if we no longer represent the community standards,
if we no longer interest you or entertain you,
they'll get rid of us.
Believe me, they're not going to pay us this kind of bucks if no one's listening.
But the strange thing is people don't do that.
People will listen in. They hate Neil.
They hate Steve.
And instead of just switching, I said yes to them.
I'm going to do it again.
In fact, I think I'm going to do this climate for a week.
If you're into...
What was the word that Guy used yesterday?
He wanted to be educated.
What was the word?
Something like educate.
Enlightened. Right, that's it. The Enlightened man.
He's not going to be enlightened.
Let me see, Jess, get a pencil and pay.
If you want to be enlightened, there was a station in this market,
W-O-L-D, my former station.
Okay.
It said, where's it on the dial 790 or something like that?
And you will get enlightened for as long as you can stay awake.
You'll be enlightened, all right?
They have Sandy paid in the morning.
They have Al Ranteau on.
As we speak, Al is droning on about some...
Probably the Contras or some boring thing are probably talking about the pay raise,
three days after it's over, whatever, you know.
And they will enlighten you.
They will enlighten you.
I'm not here to enlighten you.
Neil is not here to enlighten you.
And Mr. Rineria is not here to enlighten you.
We are here to make your drive home, mic in the morning,
make your drive to work, kneel in the afternoon to entertain you while you're at work.
I'm here in the afternoon to entertain you as you're coming home for work.
That's the name of the game and we do a pretty good job of it.
And you have to begin to wonder why somebody who hates this show or who hates Neil show.
Notice I leave my camera because nobody hates Mike.
Why they just don't hit the button?
Why they just don't go on and listen to another program?
But they don't do that.
They listen and they listen and they listen.
And one of the things I want to explore today and I don't want to do it in this kind of, you know,
this kind of coup de gras sense that we always do, you know, I hate Neil, why do you listen bang?
You know, it's like the moment of truth in both fighting when you drive the sword into the heart.
I don't want to do it in that.
This is a real question.
I want to deal with this.
I want to hear from people who hate Neil.
I want to hear from people who hate me.
And I want to know why you listen.
I'm not going to attack you for it and I'm not going to nail you to the wall with it.
And I'm not going to say, I got you.
I'm not going to do that.
I genuinely want to know.
And especially if you hate me, I want to know.
I mean, I'm not going to sit here all day and listen to people, you know, fetch a bad meal.
But I loved here.
If you hate me, why do you listen?
And give it some thought.
I would bet you most of the people out there that hate me that hate me that don't have never even thought about that.
You know, you hate us.
But you never really thought why you keep on listening.
And if in the remaining three and a half hours of this program,
we can get some coherent answers to that.
I think it's going to be very enlightening.
Very enlightening.
No point giving out the numbers because all the lines are full and doubtless will remain so.
But let's right now go to Nassau.
Okay, let's go to Nassau, you're on WIOD.
Thank you, Mr. Cano.
Hey, how you doing?
I love you, love Neil.
Love everybody on the whole WIOD program.
I find it interesting living here in the Bahamas and the United States being such a great country and big and prosperous and high-tech that they still have people like that living in Hellendale.
I thought of something sort of cute to say.
I mean, we live in a Bermuda triangle, but Rod Serling would say that people in Hellendale live in the Twilight Zone.
Well, there are a couple things that have to be made clear here.
Number one, there are a lot of nice people in Hellendale, just like there are a lot of nice old people.
I would say probably the vast majority of senior citizens, the vast majority of people that live in Hellendale are very decent, nice and fine people.
Most of them probably love these shows.
And we have to resist the temptation in our mind to do this stereotyping like this is all of Hellendale.
I got calls from people in Hellendale yesterday that voice tremendous support for this station and for Neil and for myself and tremendous antagonism towards their commission there that is involved in this frivolous exercise.
That's number one.
Number two, Hellendale is only the...
The Hellendale situation is the pimple on the fanny of the underlying problem here.
The underlying problem is an individual who is determined to take the radio shows that you love away from you.
That's what we're dealing with here.
Hellendale is only a tool in this thing.
I must say a tool that this gentleman unfortunately used because in permitting it to become a full blown news story now we can deal with it in the open which is where it has to be done with this thing.
The solution to this problem is light and that's what we're going to shed on this.
And I'm not... you'll notice I'm not in my usual worked up rage over this.
This is too serious to become involved. I'm way beyond anger at this. This is a major thing and it affects everybody in our listening audience.
And I can only say that if you or anybody else out there who feel as you do about the station I would suggest that you write and voice your support on just a couple of lines we'll do to our general manager Mike Disney here at WIOD and Nicole.
Hold on, I got the zip right here in front of me.
One second. Are you interested? Do you have a pencil?
I already wrote.
Okay, that's good. For those who have a 3-3-1-4-1 WIOD Miami Florida 3-3-1-4-1 and we would appreciate your support.
I really thank you for your call.
Give my loves everyone down in the Nassau.
Come on down.
Okay, take care man. Bye-bye.
Let's go to... oh, we got to take a break.
Okay, alright. Don't get... geez, Nick is one.
Do you have a bad night last night?
We're going to take a short break for news update after which we'll be back.
You're listening to the Steve Cain Show on 610 WIOD.
