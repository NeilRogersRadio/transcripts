The time-breaking poses. It's 12-0-8 at WIOD. Let's try Bokka on the Palm Beach line.
Oh, there is somebody there. Yes.
Hi. How you doing?
Hello?
Yeah, how are you?
Hi, I just wanted to say I enjoy your show.
I want to also put in my two senses about the news media.
I feel that they create a lot of our problems that we have today
because they are so insensitive and the act like Barbie dolls.
They can possibly know what tragedy is to an individual.
Uh-huh.
And why I'm on is gone. I want to also say who is laughing?
This is laughing. You know, reminds me of a weasel.
Yeah, what we have.
I'll play him down. You know how you listen to someone and you try to
pick you what they look like.
But the last just drives me crazy.
Well, that's the WIOD weasel as a matter of fact.
Uh-huh. Is it real?
Yeah.
Okay. This thing came myself, Harrison, talk to you for a moment.
Oh, sure. No problem.
Okay. Thank you. I enjoy the show.
Thank you.
For that.
Yes. He knows a lot about it. That's for sure.
Any meal?
Yeah.
A couple of something.
Um, listen to you guys for a long time.
You guys are hilarious.
Yes, we are. We're a panic.
Really?
Would you explain to the other lady?
No, no, no.
Not go ahead. Don't.
Everything you got to make a big sentence.
She just hates your guts. Go ahead, sir.
God, what was Bernie going to say?
He wants to start a big argument with being in a way that he doesn't know.
I want to say I don't want to argue.
I just wanted to ask this nice man if he would explain to her who I am.
The weasel. That's it.
Well, you're a good sidekick, but you're awfully soft skinned.
I don't know how I asked him to.
Two still things.
I was.
I didn't try to keep you.
I mean, you were just going to ask.
Just shut up and let this guy go on.
You don't have a lot of time here.
We've got important stuff to do.
Oh, good.
I think the Clarks network had saved himself six digits by just getting an endless loop of words
to laugh and eating the orange areas on.
See, you had to start with this guy.
You didn't know when you were well off.
No, but Glenn, you're a great guy.
You really are.
I've been to a lot of your remotes.
It's the most recent where I went to was down at specs.
Uh-huh.
That's great.
It was. It was a great, it was a great remote.
And I was down on the friend of mine who I'm going to call a douchebag in a second.
But one thing I couldn't believe was how tight you guys are with the food.
Well, we'll type with the food.
I mean, Matt Rich had to be surgically removed from the ice cream.
Yeah.
Fuck them.
Hell.
It's damn near kill them.
I like that that Rich got ripped too.
Yeah.
And if he thinks he lost 70 pounds, tell him I found him.
Okay, well listen, and closing.
No, one more thing.
Um, following closing.
If I have to close now, we call Jen and Beave and Adam and Mike douchebags.
And we really love you guys.
But don't be so sensitive.
Be, huh?
Be.
Yeah, okay.
We get the message.
Have a great day.
It's the best deeper salesman in South America.
Have a great day.
Yeah.
So 11 after noon at WIID, I have a fax here with a map of broward parts of Broward County
here for Lauderdale.
And it says this is a street in for Lauderdale.
They have marked off there right on the ocean on for Lauderdale Beach.
Beach front homes.
There's only one in for Lauderdale.
No blue hair is mostly rich bags.
Wow, I better check it out.
Huh?
Okay, let's do a little business here.
Some very important business because we wanted to talk about it.
