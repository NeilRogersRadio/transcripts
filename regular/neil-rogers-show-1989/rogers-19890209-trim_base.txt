It's 1005 at WIOD. Good morning. We're really excited to be here. Fat
riches in the building which means there's food here. And we're going to have a
heck of a day today. Trust me when I tell you. Well no I think we can go back to
doing a radio show today. Although I do have some additional comments that I
want to make about what we've been discussing last couple of days but then we'll
get back to doing a radio show which is about time. Anyway we're really hot at
Gulf Stream. The birdie afternoon gave you in the sixth race hot pillow which is
still running over. And fifth cold in a seven horse race and I gave you a
plate queen in the ninth race came in fifth and an eight horse race so not too
hot. No we're cold. Okay here's my special picket Gulf Stream today. Go out and
plunge your brains out on green performer. You thought I was going to pick
Joe. I shocked you green performer with dose ray moose in the eighth race six to
one in the morning line. That's got a the two horse. It's got a shot. Yeah in
fact look at this Dave Joseph picks it on top. Yeah I'll be damned. I don't
hear any no I'm giving up. Yeah today anyway I'm humiliated and embarrassed and
and auditing. Yeah and should exactly. Okay anyway one of the things we want to
do and we did this yesterday and Steve had a magnificent job of doing it all
afternoon is have you folks in light of the virulent hate campaign against
Steve and myself in this station have those of you who enjoy the programming
here if you want to see it continue. Right letters and notes to Mike Disney
our general manager just sent him along to a Mike Disney WYOD Miami 33141 and
because we have that great facts machine in there. Oh yeah you know if you're a
business person or somebody else it's got a facts machine who wants to send
a similar kind of a note rather than waste the postage and take that much time.
Here's a WYOD. WYOD 757 7516 and you can just send your message of support on
the facts machine 757 7516. Boy there's there's enough sevens in that number
that we could have Larry can't come in special to give the number on here
right? 757 7516 our first call out of town again it collect from Washington
DC good morning mr. President how you doing? Good morning Nell good morning
now Glenn how you doing this morning. Is this the grease man? No I have no grease.
Uh huh. Well I do have this some information that was printed in Washington
Times. Really well if it's in a Washington Times you know it must be true. How's
Reverend Mondoan by the way? Listen this is good for talk radio though. Okay
the header is this is put the new news analysis the header is furious public
rallied on cries from talk radio really? Uh floating quickly from the article
the Rev. Well this must be about the congressional pay raise yes it is.
Okay the revolutionary heroes of this rebellion were radio talk show host and
this jockey's around the country. Uh it does mention unfortunately uh Lee Fowler.
Pardon? Lee Fowler. No Sandy Payton. Oh wow. Oh my god.
This is uh W.S. News. Sandy Payton said she had been a Miami talk show host
twenty years and of any issue we've discussed I've never seen someone's outrage.
Yeah. Then it goes. I was saying that I think it's a lot of these people.
Yeah sure cookies but you know the article basically can't find out.
I want to tell you something pal first the congressional pay raise next the outrageous
prices on the early bird okay that's coming next and if there's anybody who
could do it it's Sandy. Well Sandy is top boy it does mention the whole
history here but what it does say is that while the newspapers stirred up little
or no controversy about it uh according right from the article radio host talk to
real people watching and journalists talk to each other. Right well we're like
the folks of a W.P.B.R. in Palm Beach we're here to make a difference okay.
Well I know that's not you know the way that you do the show down there but it's
just basically it's something good about talk radio. That is correct. Well on
occasion we've been knowing to make a difference you know. That is true.
Not like Sandy but well I'm sorry that it didn't mention you. No that's all right.
No news. I got enough I got enough paper coverage here as it is. Yeah I've been
even made the hellendale digest today. She is. Good that's great I'm coming back to my
Emmy today so I'll be interested in seeing that my girlfriend was supposed to
record some of your show for me while I was up here. I've got to go I just wanted
to leave you with just one thing I want to say good morning to Frankie and Sean
your douchebag and Neil here's the greatest. Okay thanks a lot and say hi to
president Bush league for us. I was going to mention you to him before I leave.
Okay Tom would hope he's feeling better. He has been under the weather but then I
get with a faulty tower issue. Yeah well tell him we like John. Okay. All right thank you.
Thanks a lot. Good morning. Great call from Washington DC. I got news for you man.
Very few local talk shows anywhere in the country start out with calls from our
nation's capital right and probably most of them pretty happy about it. Anyway we
made the hellendale digest today which is more about the freedom of speech becomes an
issue for Rogers and Kane hellendale in the middle of legal battle and all the
stuff we've been talking about the last couple of days. I think the most
interesting and the person who wrote it Karen Conway is going to call me because
she didn't have a chance to talk to me before writing this so all of the
quotes of course come from our dear attorney friend from a sunny Rosenberg
and from Mr. Intendola the city manager in hellendale now his comments I think are the most
interesting and I think it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that this whole hellendale segment
of the witch hunt campaign is a sunny Rosenberg orchestrated chapter okay. Mr. Intendola said
increased controversy only increases shock radio's ratings when the city of hellendale went head
to head with Rogers about two years ago Rogers had the third rated show in Tendola said which is
not true we were number one but he says we gave him his number one ratings the city's crusade
against Rogers show eventually died a natural death because of a lack of support in Tendola said
even some of those people who say it's nasty think it's funny and advertisers told us to go for a walk
yeah yeah how do you like that you go walk the dog and also our attorney friend said that he's
contacted station advertisers which include Gulfstream Park and Hellendale and describe the content
of Rogers show and they have continued to advertise well no kidding no kidding no kidding
attempts to garner the support of the Broward County school system but a breath and other
local religious ethnic and youth groups have also failed he said nobody has the guts to do anything
about this type of programming he said well the bottom line is most people have a sense of humor
and they understand it and even if they don't like it they just turn it off and don't listen in
that case which most rational people do and the idea that we're harming anybody with this kind of
programming of course is just a desperate attempt to create havoc and chaos and problems for me
and any station that I work on you know first it was w-i-n-z and then it was zeta and now just by
coincidence it's w-i-o-k just a coincidence huh although I thought you once said there are no
coincidences how about that all right let me do a little break here then we'll come back up
a few more comments I want to make about that and then we'll get into and we may have a big
celebrity guest coming by today hopefully this is exciting that let me give you a little sneak preview
okay that's as much as all that's all that's a problem it's after 10 Toyota
I mean don't fight over the paper here let's just try to relax we've got a lot of copies of the
paper what is that who is that that's uh el McPherson in sports illustrated which I've been
looking for a copy this around here but the sports department gets that magazine for some weird
reason you know oh I get it I subscribe to SI do you like I want of those great little phones
you know the ones that don't work now we also have that tape
the greatest blue volume two which is really not all that great yeah anyway getting back to some of
the information that we're passing along since this is now a public news story and since the
published news stories mentioned that these harassment campaign have been going on for the last
19 months obviously the chronology of same is a legitimate news story that we can discuss
when we were at Zeta there was a period of time when with great regularity we'd be getting either
phone calls or messages or something would pop up in the newspaper remember the one Greg
Buldell was going to sue me you remember that oh vividly and we kept wondering what the hell is this
all about there was even a thing with Bill Tanner's who called us yesterday on here as a good friend
of ours uh his attorney calling the radio station and threatening this and at and the bottom line
comes to find out that the same attorney individual had been making phone calls or writing letters to
these individuals in fact Greg and I discussed this when I had that phone call with him about a
month ago or two months and you know taking things out of context and twisting and manipulating and
so I'm so I mean I'm urging people again soliciting business and urging people to sue me and you
know so for those who are regular listeners and go back with his soap opera that's been ongoing for
19 months now and you wondered what all of that stuff was about including Denise White our next
tour neighbor here at channel seven you'll recall when they did that piece she and the Steve whatever
his name is Dawson tea huh you know when they did that piece on morning shows and they defamed me
into that awful stuff and I made some you know jokes about that uh the same thing again you know
received phone calls from the same individual so those of you who think that this is some kind of
an isolated campaign or that you know there's some real merit here all it's been has been a
scatter buckshot attempt to contact everybody and anybody possible to make as much problem for
any of Rogers and basically get him off the air you know get me fired get me out of the market
just through my career my life harass my friends like fat rich who's sitting here who's got a
whole series of things that have been sent to him plastered on his car a phone calls at seven o'clock
in the morning etc and it's been one of the ugliest and nastiest harassment campaigns Steve had a
guy called in yesterday whose name and number we've got by the way who is a sponsor on this station
who related to kind of harassment that he's had from this individual and even when he was
advertising not on this show but on the rest of the station yeah that wasn't okay according to
this individual if he didn't stop advertising he was going to let everybody know what he was doing
and bapapah and this and that and again this goes so far beyond the bounds of any individuals free
speech to interfere with other people's business uh that it really is just shocking I think is the
word that somebody we know might say shocking that's really yeah and I heard you know Steve had a
lot of great calls yesterday he also had some of the blue hairs calling again and uh you know
taking issue with what I say well that's fine if you don't like what I say you don't have to listen
to the show nobody out there is going to be injured or harmed because of this program you can go
to the bank on that all right and uh you know if you're thin skin and the fact is that every one of
these people called in listened to the show even though they denied it in many cases they were
quoting chapter in verse Rodgers got a note on here he said he talked to one of Mike sponsors
this morning that was harassed during this as well one of her neary sponsors how do you like that
no Mike is about his non-controversial and one of the nicest guys you'd ever want to know and
certainly not involved in any of this other business that allegedly is going on and even his
sponsors could have been hurried what does that tell you no I think you folks out there it's about
time that you knew just how widespread and how disgusting this thing was and again we really hope
that you'll take the time because we know that we're reaching Steve said tens of thousands it's
hundreds of thousands of people yeah uh every week on these programs and uh you know all of us
here at W.I.M.D. have got invested interest including the station management and seeing that uh
we are protected and that we have a lot of support from you folks out there who enjoy what we do if
you don't enjoy it good luck to you as we said yesterday lots of other places you can go go
listen to Sandy she's even made it in Washington now in the Washington time so she's probably doing
one hell of a job over there at WOLD so you have plenty of alternatives okay but those of you who
do enjoy it drop us a letter Mike Disney W.I.O.D Miami 33141 or if you have a fax machine you can send
it along a note letter whatever you want on the fax machine 757 751 says okay also want to
mention if you're looking for those great new uh unbelievable neo-ronders bumper stickers you can
get them this Sunday a trade winds park in coconut creek a classic and antique car show to benefit
the broward humane society look for the W.I.O.D. roving radio and Sharon who will be handing out the
stickers and other goodies and Meg green will even be there they're a little bonus she'll be there
from 10 to 1 this Sunday 9 to 5 sample road on the Florida turnpike for the trade winds park thing
the classic and antique car show okay yeah first thing all right I guess that the gets us caught up
will do another little piece of business then we'll take some calls from our good friends out
there in radio land we have so many of them obviously don't we yeah a little note from Joe at
taft street who's doing just great little thing here from Gulfstream Park yeah it's interesting yeah
see one thing I'd like to explain is people don't advertise on these radio programs or any other
ones just because they like us they advertise because they get tremendous results that's what
advertising is all about that's and even if you disagree see what I used to do topical talk and
had a lot of very strong opinions about organized religion and lots of other topics the one thing
that was consistent is that even people who disagree with my philosophy found that they got
tremendous results because you're not selling your philosophy you're selling the fact that you're
reaching a tremendous number of people you've got great credibility and the people will patronize
your sponsors and they do so for our attorney friend who just can't understand how they continue
to advertise in spite of his harassment campaign and bombardment of of eight against these shows the
fact of the matter is that these people know they're getting banged for the book okay they're
getting response all they care about and that's what it's all about okay 751 WIOD and
day 524 WIOD in Broward 278 9463 in Boka and I got a kick out of the one caller called him yesterday
that said I had defamed Boka even as as of yesterday which I did and I'll say it again you watch
how long it takes that Boka line of matter like they sleep the walking dead in Boka and in Palm Beach
which is a stage beyond that 655 WIOD a Valentine's Day is coming down WIOD 1025 at happiness radio
and our only open line is in Palm Beach 655 WIOD we love so much for somebody to call on the Palm Beach
line especially preferably somebody who doesn't live in Palm Beach okay chicken collage collect
if you're calling from any place else and can't get through on the board if you're that desperate
on the Palm Beach line 655 WIOD we'll start in Miami this morning hello hi Neil hi how are you
just great listen I've been trying to call you for a couple of days regarding just silly guy
remember when you had an appearance when you was with beta and you was at the South
State shopping oh I sure do and he showed up for harassment purposes yeah right my husband I
brought you a tape the Dave County Commission me oh yeah and I still have it and I appreciated
that very much I still have that now that tape is only part of the meeting we saw a repeat of that
same meeting later and we taped the first part of it and they met more or less told the guy he's not
well you know this is the amazing part of it he continues just going around contacting anybody
and everybody and of course the reason he made the contact with sunny Rosenberg in halandale was
because he realized here's a guy who already hates my guts and has a personal axe to grind so he's
going to find a sympathetic ear but the thing that frustrates him is that whether it's advertisers
whether it's the people at the University of Miami whether it's the Metro Commission I mean the
guy has shown his true colors he's shown what this is all about and his credibility on a scale of
zero is minus infinity right and you know I've been thinking there's something that keeps sticking
in the back of my mind you know Jim and Tammy Baker and in the swagger they were damning everyone out
yeah they were doing the same thing yeah well I'm not going to make any accusations I don't I don't
know anything about the man's personal life nor do I care because that's his business but I will
I will say on a general level and I've said this before people who protest as such a hysterical
degree very often have got something that there's something there something there you know it
makes you wonder yeah but if you would like that tape the complete oh I'd love it yeah okay I'll
get my husband there make you a copy excellent thank you appreciate it very much okay bye bye 1028 at
WIOD and open line and date 751 9463 did we ever get the video taped as anybody know of the
halandale commission meeting I've heard anything about they were going to bring it by yesterday I
guess Nick would probably know here's a mobile in Palm Beach hello hey Neil good morning this is
Lee uh I'm on a mobile on a soygrass this is Lee in Palm Beach no no I'm not in Palm Beach I'm on
the soygrass right now but you said you wanted somebody on the Palm Beach line that didn't live in Palm Beach
right I don't but uh by the way can I say something in in a wake of that okay congratulations
hey listen I've been listening to you show the last couple of days and this thing with Holland
out it is unbelievable yeah I never learned your lesson do they it's incredible I just can't believe
that people react like this uh I enjoy your show and the days that I don't you know I listen to it
anyway I just you know I just I enjoy what you do it's just strictly entertainment and uh that's
all there is to it and these people if they just want to find excuses they complain about anything
and everything well let me let me put it this way in a general level anybody who would take the
satirical or comedy things that we say on this on this show they're obviously meant as comedy
and try to twist them and manipulate them and make them intended to be serious has got to anyone
who would do that would have to have sinister motives for doing you know what I'm saying yeah really
I just it's incredible but you guys just keep doing what you're doing and birds you keep
cackling back there and hanging there eat your food I get hungry every time I listen to you guys
and just keep going okay thanks a lot bye bye see that Palm Beach line is very useful not to
Palm Beach but for other people who can't get out of the day in Broward lines man it is a
bananza even Lauren Green would be impressed okay for all the out of town calls come from a
don't yeah most of them yeah 10 30 at W I O D and let's go to beautiful Miami hello
yeah how you doing great look I want to tell you that we all are supporting and Steve
it is stupid to think that you know only be here you know listen to you we are architecting Miami
there you know I guess people do not realize it kind of following you have we are you know
we are ready to support you and do anything that is to be done excellent when you write us one
of those letters okay but we you but we already discussed that if we need to stand by you with the
two by four we'll do that okay well I'll keep my eye out for you that's right okay you take it
is okay okay I'm hanging there nothing gonna have we're hanging all right thanks a lot bye bye okay 10 30
at W I O D I guess we already said we're hanging so we don't have to ask anybody ask that question
the rest of the show there's an opening and look at that man they're really they're moist today out
there well they're really ready plantation hello good morning yes sir when is this well I'm
still a way out now anyway meal I have a question didn't this individual start this mess
way back about oh maybe two years ago when he was doing harassing phone calls to you at
not just I and Z yeah it started I and Z in the summer of 87 the harassing calls were not only to
me but they were to the switchboard the newsroom I mean just a just a succession of wild
a threatening screaming hysterical phone calls and it's just never stopped I mean that was just
the beginning of it and it's never stopped and again that all started taking something out of
context I was talking about my trip to Hawaii and I was trolling according to him on the air what I
was doing was looking for a traveling companion my best friend had just died the short time before
and I was looking to find somebody to go on a trip with me and I said probably you know
be good idea say first of all a person that have to be over 18 and secondly be nice to have
somebody who was gay because we'd have common interest and God only knows what might develop
and immediately he twisted that into something about trolling for sex from my boys on the air which
of course anybody over the age of 18 is an adult but don't confuse this person with that okay well
yeah I remember him calling this I can calling you on the air yeah I remember the call like it was
yesterday yeah I'm I've been listening to since I came down here about five years now and I'll
tell you this I sent my letter this morning to mr. Disney great everybody I've talked to
supports you and Steve and IOD up down sideways and any other way you want to support
we feel that this is an abysment of our rights we have we decide what we want to listen to not
anybody else exactly well Steve put it very well when he said it's not just a campaign against us
individually or against one radio station or now a three station but it's a campaign against the
public's right to make their own free choices as to what they find entertaining and what they want
to listen to yeah well if I find that you're not entertaining I do my own censorship and turn you off
wow yeah I'm pretty revolutionary yeah yeah you never heard of the same thing with Steve I mean I
won't go to the WOLD because that just you know they put me to sleep yeah that's also turn on
on elevator music or something sure but that's what we do and that's my right to do it and that
works huh yeah you know I just want to interrupt you for a second when you talked about the harassing
phone calls year and a half ago do you remember the time he put his personal call on fat oh yeah
we're reporting to our business to our which we're going to say violation of the law
yeah I remember he's in a row also came to my house and stuck a letter an unstanped letter in my
mailbox which is a violation of federal postal law and you know it constantly accusing me of
criminal activity and solicitation on the air and being breaking the law but in the meantime he
goes ahead and does these illegal things consistently all throughout this campaign and we're supposed
to look the other way I also remember that he said he started getting all sorts of phone calls
that his business office concerning you know from people who were outraged at him for doing things
to you well let me say that we've never we have never encouraged anyone to do that I know that
you know we in fact quite the contrary we discourage all our listeners to refrain from contacting
this individual anyway because first it's inappropriate and secondly it would be of no effect
anyway and thirdly if they do want to do something positive then they you know ought to write the
letters to our management and you know and patronize our sponsors and do the things that help well
I tell you this I've written written the letters and any restarts you ever recommend I've gone to
so I have no problem with you guys and like I said I'll exercise my own form of sense is here
but I don't when I'm not entertained excellent thanks a lot thanks a lot bye 1034 WIOD we have an
I'm pretty outrageous 1041 at WIOD 19 to 11 and let's we got a mobile and brownered hello
good morning yes sir you know I just wanted to let you know that I can understand your frustration
and the abuse that you must feel however I don't know when you're giving some thought to the fact
that you should or hopefully you will get some comfort out of the service you're giving to your
community let me explain my wife she she doesn't think much of your program I've met her side
that they she'd like to see you off the air under any condition any way that she can't she doesn't
she has you belong there really really nevertheless as a result of this going on he's going on she
now realizes that she really she may have her feeling about you but she's really in position
itself upon the community of individuals yeah and now she feels very strongly that they can't do
this do you have a right to be there and I thought it would be you know there's been a complete
I don't know how part let's agree maybe occurring to other people no well that is excellent I
made that point two days ago that even the people who hate this show or hate me personally yeah can
you hear me yeah I got you now my mobile okay I was I was saying a couple of days ago I made the
point that even those people who hate this show I think will come to the realization that when you
start allowing individuals or groups of individuals in a community to censor and to try to get on
the air only what they approve of but then you know that's that's the first road to fascism you can
allow I think you're right Neil I think that this now is this awareness now is good for our community
I really do I think it's good it would be just a word and we need this we need to jump in the back
once in a while yeah I appreciate a good point thank you thanks a lot now in fact that we probably
owe a little thanks to sunny Rosenberg again over there in halemdale because unwittingly what he's
done by making this a news story and now there've been like five newspaper articles about the entire
story or least most of it yeah in the last couple of days and now it's fair game for comment here
prior to this because of certain legal machinations that went on we were you know there were
some dubious circumstances and we were restrained from talking about it on the air but now because it is
a legitimate news story you know we can really go into it and let the public know what's been going on
that's the thing that frustrated me the most over the past 19 months is that the group of people who
are the greatest supporters which are your listeners you couldn't talk to we couldn't discuss it
on a year and that's you know that was part of the game plan of this individual was to keep
muscling us and then to be able to go out you know without the spotlight shining on him and do all
of these things in in the dark so to speak and making all of these phone calls and harassing and
threatening sponsors and threatening friends of mine and making you know nuisance phone calls and now
it's you know it's going to stop it may not stop today or tomorrow but it's going to stop
because a lot of this activity is blatantly illegal it is certainly unethical as far as
illegal conduct is concerned and it's going to stop the party is over okay 1044 at WIOD Tamarack hello
hi good morning you know hi good morning bird hi how are you doing good good first of all I want to
say how funny it is yesterday when I the calls did you hear on Steve's show yeah I heard the whole show
uh-huh it's very funny how these people who find that the songs and the bits are disgusting how they
you know they call Steve and tell him but they you know they won't call your show yeah now we
didn't have a single negative call and we certainly didn't screen them out we just took him as
they came in yesterday we did not have a single negative call about this show or this radio station
on a program yesterday right and did you hear the particular call when the woman called in and
says that you know her daughter heard the song walk with an erection and she finds that that's very
harmful oh yeah and it was her daughter was 13 years old and when Steve asked her if she heard
anything that well now she didn't say harmful because Steve said was there any harm to her daughter
because she heard it she said well not really right and he said did she hear anything that she
wouldn't hear in school and she said well no not really and you know that was the end of the phone
call right that's what's funny these two boxes like they've never heard these things in their whole life
well it's really sad i feel sorry for people who are so miserable or have such minimal sense of
humor that are so uptight about words or about comedy or you know pretend not to understand it and
i do say pretend because that's what they're doing they're pretending they don't understand that it's
satire and comedy they know better right well i wish we both you and Steve the best of luck and i
hope everything goes okay okay thanks all right thank you ten forty six at wio d an open line
in brown word five two four nine four six three we have ladies and gentlemen another

half ago yeah thank you some facts did you ever get them uh what were they they were san Francisco

stealing them jose a gaki has a sense that you were second to none well i'm joe man he's a bundle of
life so i've discovered that since coming out he's a panic right i was supposed to come back to that
area so i backed it up one day well i'll tell you if you backed it up one day you're going to come

food intensive knockers riches doing so well although he does have he looks like he just walled a rabbit
but uh... joa taftry rotisserie is a great friend of ours and uh... him be a great friend of yours too
when you start shopping there and register to win an eighty nine ponny act grand pre and other
prices from w i o d your derail rider open station now more with meal rogers on news talk radio six
ten w i o d i'm my captain it's a ten fifty one at w i o d now that that was that shocking good
heavens
good i see you pinching yourself you couldn't believe your ear
good
well shocking yes i saw that with a pinstripe suit walking on a haul earlier i wasn't sure exactly who it was
that was how okay we got a while you're recovering here's a mobile and brown or hello
in ill yeah i don't have much to say just got one uh... point but uh... in reverse to the lady that uh...
was complaining about her daughter hearing the song walk with an erection yeah i think there's a
a lot more said and and
before it and all-rated movies and
your show even barely even touches on and i think that's ridiculous and i bet she left her
daughter go to all-rated movies well not only that but i'm sure her daughter probably was you know
before school in the morning or whatever listens to fm shows uh... you know
where the use all kinds of sexual material and play um... all kinds of racy thing which is fine you
know that goes on all over the country and it's for its humor it's entertainment okay and the
people are so uptight about that you really have to wonder well and plus two the i think the violence
that that is in the movies is much more damaging than any uh... words or any humor that you have
on the show absolutely ridiculous amen so hang in there and you got a lot of people that like it so
we're hanging thanks a lot okay see you ten fifty three a w i'd be speaking of that the steve has
a really interesting topic today and it's about time uh... did pornography really turn bundy into a
mass murderer and of course that's the thing that uh... the born again the right wingers and i
attempting to do is use that ridiculous interview that contrived interview with bundy and say well here
we go this is an excuse for us to start censoring and you got to take playboy out of the convenience store again
and all this kind of stuff they've been doing for years and steves guest will be su the censor
that's her name su
uh...
red shots who needs no introduction and attorney Norman Kent so that's gonna be one barn burner of a show okay
and it ties in with a lot of stuff we've been talking about the last three days because it has to do
with freedom of speech and expression the first amendment
et cetera and so on north mind me be chill out
i mean on the
uh...
i've been a long time with her but the first time i've ever called
good but i thought maybe you should know that
i think it might be the same guy
that's been harassing you that i heard call a couple weeks back when we're back up all was on one of the
other stations
and
volunteer
some more tapes to send her
this and uh...
oh no question about it no question about anybody
seat no matter what i talk about no matter who i mentioned even the alpo dog food thing i did in the fm
which i was exonerating absolutely
uh... backed up in by all the veterinarians in the area but no matter what it is i say a letter immediately goes out
and uh... these comments were made by the oragers and their inflammatory out of sua man sua man
just to try to create a barrage of lawsuits none of which by the way have ever developed because there's nothing there
and just to try to create problem between me and management make make so much of a
a
chaotic situation that i would lose my job that's that's the game plan behind all of us
i agree with you but uh...
she uh...
it was on fandie show by the way and fandie
ask
rebeck you know what what's this all about and uh... she says that uh...
she was getting all this information and
you know and setting it
to her lawyer to see about a libel
all you know
so i just thought you know we haven't heard a word about that now is not
that we have a word and we want to be a three week back
obviously this is what happens in the beginning the letters in a phone calls are so
inflammatory just like the thing that happened with Greg but you know if you take
anything out of context and twisted and it person doesn't know what really happened
anybody could say to you well i'm going to sue somebody that's outrageous and then when they find out what
really was said like you know the humorous stuff that we've done with rebeck a
paul and that's all it's been
then you know it all fritters away because there's nothing there's
well i just thought you should know me because i don't think this is right
i think this man has gone over the edge and it's more than just harassment you know
it could get very nasty well it's going to stop believe me well i just wanted to
know thanks a lot all right you're welcome but i okay here's a caller who's got a
tape of the halem day meeting hello
yeah nearly rata talk to you
yesterday yeah i'm going to make that video tape up for you
excellent yeah i'm working during the day so it's going to be hard but i'm going to bring it
down to you tomorrow great okay we appreciate it could you do me a favor yeah could you
call here a Gary a douche bag well for you will do it Gary or a douche bag and that's only
because this caller is such a great american all right i'll bring it to you tomorrow i promise
thanks a lot thanks bye ten fifty six at wiod and open line in date and in brown
at seven five one nine four six three in date county seven five one wiod hollywood hello
good morning now hi this is also nilo and hollywood i was over halem day yesterday i was getting all
my hairs cut and next to me all your hairs come my hairs cut incredible and next me there
was there was this old typical halem day off art and he starts to open up his mouth
is everybody around here heard about this guy Neil Rogers and what he's saying and doing
and he starts going on and on he's nothing but an old bag it and when all these dirty things
and a radio and complaining about our nice canadian neighbors and everything yeah i think middle
age fact is much more not old yet okay especially by halem day old standards and i just had enough
of them and i turned around to them and i said sir you understand that this is nothing but a radio
show i mean it's just comedy that is all it is he says you know i think you're just like him oh
yeah i said oh really yeah and uh
this guy just kept on and on well you know it's interesting that tom jicke at the mime news is a good
friend and who's been married for many many years and as a family and as straight as an arrow when
tom was involved in getting abuse from this individual also had one of a series of harassing calls
and when tom didn't agree with what the caller was saying uh the comment to tom as well you
must be a homosexual too because you agree with him so you see if you agree then somehow you're
painted by the same brush and you know subject to the same kind of attack right so i said to him
i said well if you feel this way why don't you call him and you know why don't you call Neil
no guts oh i wouldn't do that yeah but every day though he keeps up the same thing and the
same thing i says oh you listen to him oh you can't turn it off can you that's right you just can't
every day we keep up this isn't that fascinating just like a few of those caller Steve had yesterday
and there were really that many of them but the few who did call uh is you listen to the call and
Steve draw drew them out you discover they can quote chapter inverse of anything and everything we
say on the show because like you say they can't shut it off well my letters in the mail and
let's just kick ass and take names we're doing it thanks a lot okay bye are you people listening to
this show again yeah those of you who hate the show and sit around and mutter and bitch and complain
about it you got thirty nine at least other alternatives on a radio not to mention the TV set you
know and you got Sally and Haraldo and Bob Barker and uh god only knows what else and there's still
subjecting themselves to this awful terrible stuff that is so outrageous and so nasty and so whatever
i got news for you man i've been in the business almost 30 years i've traveled all over this
country i've heard FM morning shows i've heard stern in york and a grease man and steven chicago
and this show is so tame compared to dozens and dozens of other radio programs and made your
markets that this is like playways p how or peewees play house with that little slip of the tongue
it's like peewees play house by comparison okay so grow up and get real will you now the word of the day
just like peewe we have to have our word okay here's the word of the day i'm my captain okay and uh
Henry Barrow standing by betcha that brings back a lot of great memories for Henry now it's like
the another sip later this afternoon just to make up for that when we got the 11 o'clock wio d news we'll

sensor Fred shots and Norman Elliott Kent

Henry get off the floor when you're pleased it's 11.05 at wio d now to show you that even in the

individual were discussing this attorney one of the letters he sent i don't remember whether it
was to our corporate attorney or you know there's so many and there's so many different people
one of the letters went through these bitter complaints about the fact that this outrageous
behavior is going on with Henry Barrow drinking on the air and sexual harassment on the job of April
him referring to my you know i mean you talk about somebody with no sense of humor or
or pretending to have no sense of humor unbelievable little stretch yeah just a little

a facts machine whatever uh this could be a little more important okay then whatever super silly

hundred are they now i'm thinking of getting one of those are they kind of fun aren't they
yeah they are fun i'd fax things on ours yeah because it makes you feel important i
find that people with facts machines it's like it's kind of like people like get those phony and
tennis and put them on the back of their car you know so you think they got a car phone
oh it's a great thing it really is yeah it's excellent yeah okay moving along there we go i said
that again where do i come up with this stuff moving along how about moving right along moving
right along by the way joey is supposed to stop by today and that he maybe he could be listening
right as we speak so we better try to do a good show but uh joey renolds called and wants to come
by and plug his appearance in the more downy junior show which is one of the craziest commercial things
i've ever heard my life but uh we like joey a lot yeah in fact we wish the joey were doing mid days
on she right now but uh so if he's listening we certainly invite him to share and left a message
on his answering machine we hope he comes by sometime today what day is that on is that on tonight
i don't know let me see yeah check work down because if it's on tonight then he definitely needs to
come by i don't think it's north my emmy hello yes sir how are you hi glam hi tonight media people
who would cancel tabloid tv program really i don't know if that's joey or not huh sounds like
censorship to me go ahead pal i'm sorry oh i wanted to talk to Glenn for a minute go ahead
right you're in your company what you were in the army yes sir and i was in the Marines remember when
we used to have to swear to protect the constitution at the enemies within and with our
10 minutes after 11 of wiod we have an open line in date 751 9463 i didn't let that go i know it
was a valid question but we couldn't put it in the air no not for the year uh let's see and
somebody expired in boca i think just one that guy said that the guy passed out in boca 278 9463 278
wiod you're letting the delay build back up yeah now i'm gonna do my break i'm not a fool you know i
wasn't born yesterday uh as a matter of fact let's see it's 10 after 11 i mean char hot all seven
softload of locations are open right now linda and susan will be here later from neutral system i
don't want to get them upset because i didn't gain any of my way back however is that for me is
that the name oh that's something else what is it oh it is for me share all is so confused because
she ate yesterday and it's been the first time in weeks that she's had anything to eat and she's
a little little groggy from the after effect but anyway speaking of eating uh you know lindens
who's not guess will be pleased that i didn't gain any way back and i must confess a couple of times
during the past two weeks i've we've sneaked over to char hot and uh had a great Italian sauce oh
d we're here at fort ladder days place ditches and award winning man to invest in burnt and walls
but we secretly replaced their gourmet sweet and sour sauce with new and improved butler
and doxas let's listen to
well there you have it there ain't no
sauce around but licking duck sauce available now at pigly wiggly why lick the best when you can
lick the nest that's looking duck so it's 11 14 at w i o d and when i mentioned joys name a
couple of lines dropped off we have an open line in bulka 278 9463 278 w i o d as we continue to
shocking the listening audience right especially those who are listening who hate every moment of it
oh god there was one woman yesterday it was one of the classic calls she said she's too she
sets her radio if you ever heard that expression before she sets her radio she listens to mike
in a morning she sets it on six ten hates me and once in a while by accident picks up steed because
she has her radio set i think that was the same one with a daughter the thirteen year old daughter
so they must have all the radios in the house and in the car set on six ten and they can't move
them so i'm sure we have people in the audience would be more happy to volunteer if she wants to
call back off the air and nick will take her name and address and we can send somebody over there to
unsat her dialed an engineer yeah well said what i've sent a michael over there because he's an
expert and he will uh... move the infact we probably arrange every day at certain times we can
send somebody over there a career to change the dial so she doesn't have to be subjected to a lot
of stuff that she just can't stand north mime beach hello i just want to let that woman know by
the way i get one of these revolutionary stereo it's got a vfo on it you can actually change the
stations no no come on they got something like that now yes knowledge he's just burning them up
incredible and it's an innocent would be shocked when they i'm telling you good to talk to you by the way
great show is always wanted to make a couple of points that by may first of all i'd like to know
what makes uh... may or sunny and the city manager i a total of think that they can't accomplish what
the fcc tried to accomplish on you when you're on the i and v a m a couple of years ago well first
all the fcc didn't try to accomplish anything they were sent a just tons of the same kind of stuff
that they've been getting now and uh... they even monitored the show if i can use that word and
sent somebody down here to the local fcc office for several days they monitored and their
comment was they didn't find a damn thing wrong with it there is absolutely nothing in those files
i thought i thought it was kind of the same thing because if i remember correctly i may be wrong
but if i remember correctly a lot of this is pretty much the same thing they were getting
complaints and they came down and if the fifth can't do it what makes you think a couple of pion
from a local city can accomplish exactly well it just don't understand what's sunny it's an ego
thing and here's a chance in his own foolish eagle maniacal way to strut his stuff again and show all
a case over there what a hot shot he is he's gonna get that nil rod you said all he does you know
this the second time they've done it in two years they just make fools out of the cell
where i got news for sunny i it make them as a shot to him but i can still go into my video store
and uh... rent or purchase things that i wouldn't want to show to my two-year-old son
i can still go and turn on even during at daytime prime time television fine topics that i wouldn't
want to show to my two-year-old son i don't notice any personal vendetta is going out against that
sort of thing as a matter of fact if you walk the street to howl and they'll at the right time you
might find some things you don't want to find their
really that doesn't seem to be a problem and i'd really love to know why
just a quick point i'd like to make also i'm a manager of a small service business in the city of
howl and dill and just just for your reference and just for uh... i'm not going to play the name because
it's not a plug but anybody walks in today that is under the age of sixty five and doesn't live in
howl and they'll ten percent discount okay good idea good for you guys appreciate it thanks a lot
but i can be the start of a revolution now the under sixty five this dot good lord
would that be great hmm hmm and then we can have like late bird specials for people who eat after six p.m.
who are under the age of two hundred and don't have blue hair and are wearing a cap okay that would be great
okay both of Palm Beach lines went on i think mentioning joy probably put us in great
jeopardy here even art Fleming would be embarrassed by this uh two seven eight nine four six three
and bokeh six five five w i o d and beautiful prestigious Palm Beach which you can call collect
from anywhere else because it's always open for lotterdale hello hello hi hi nil you find
out who your friends are when you're in trouble right i yes incidentally last week i'm an
informe the last week i put a i always have larry keen on and i'm one of those people that leave
w i o t on constantly so where somebody called in and reported your bio
language and poor larry knew from nothing and this fellow said why are you connected with say
a station that permits a thing like that and he says sir i've no idea what you're talking about
you went on to the next one hmm at any rate i wonder who that could have been three guesses
at any rate we love you well you know it sounds like the fact that you listen to i o d constantly
and every change radio it sounds like a conscious decision on your part not a word you doubt
people you have one yeah in other words you doubt it's in stuck though or for it's not stuck
yeah well good and incidentally i'm 68 and i just mailed my letter to mr. Disney i've recently moved
down after my husband's demise and believe in me you perk up the day things are quite done
after new year you can say that again there even doll after canadaigua
i don't know but truthfully and this is the highlight of the day you and well a lot of people say
that i think that's quite a commentary on what i found this is but it is true in fact there are a lot
of people who are bedridden you'd be amazed some of the letters that i've gotten over the years
people are bedridden and people who just can't get out of the house and this gives them a few laughs
and chuckle and it's fallen fun i've made it that in my note it's fallen fun who takes these things
serious well only people who want to for very sinister purposes and i think it's such a waste of
you bet and i liked what Steve said about uh bob grand when he was painting i had painted
here recently and they listened to your program and he said to me this is a very dull job and
i hear something like that he says i can't go on with this yeah and he's been doing it for some 30
years he's well like steve said sometimes living here's like watching paint dry you know
okay you have a good one and thanks a lot 20 past 11 at wiod we have an open line in beautiful
broard county at five two four nine four six three five two four wiod yes i wanted to know if i
could um repeat the quote that i gave the uh myami review which is a legal newspaper at printed my
quote about this individual about a about a year year and a half ago can i say it on the air without
you don't know what it was i don't remember well i don't think you'll dump it but they did print it
exactly what i said as the other papers did not i said they asked me about this individual
you may want to hold your hand by the button but they printed it in the myami review
you dumped it yes okay but certainly true 21 21 past 11 at wiod while it's subjective you know
well the people on the phone got to hear it in fact there was a proctologist who said the same thing
we have an open line in broard six five five wiod six five five nine four six three
oh god and then there was another one of these old prunes on there yesterday with steve talking
about the language and he used that word that you just mentioned um which i didn't dump it because
of the word but just you know just for old time seconds sure but um it's been a long time
and a guy he made a very after all the conversation back and forth then a guy wasn't screaming
or anything he was i think too comatose to do that but he made a very profound point he said steve
you know i'd much rather be called an idiot than an asshole and i you know i thought about that
i thought gee that's really profound thinking you know i thought about it for hours after the
guy said and i thought that those are words to live by and i was thinking you know i feel the same way
so maybe i am getting old you know anyway look at this mike spindle a great broadcasting star of
the past well yeah the past and hopefully the the way past i've given up the business
well actually with the aggravation you guys have gone through well you can relate to it you
still have a lot of fun on sunday well no it's not only that but uh you know it's for anybody who
has been in the broadcast media uh the the chilling effect the reason i called his first of all
to voice my support and to say that you know anything that i can do uh uh i've already written my
letter and it's gone out along with a cassette no more forgetting no i could buy just by the way you
did get your cassette didn't you oh thank god thank goodness okay after you had totally embarrassed
and you milleted me on the air but that was the price of getting the cassette the reason that i
called is first of all to voice the support but also a very that uh unusual thing you had it on the
news yesterday and it was in the herald this morning about florida has one of our nation's highest
instances of censorship in public school yeah i saw that and you know that was running on your
news at the bottom of the hour at the top of the hour and you just listening to that in schools and
you know that the atmosphere that uh permeates south florida and permeates the state is something that
you and in your own way and in in the humorous way and a steve in his way is trying to basically combat
well you know it is unfortunate that we live in a neanderthal state but keep in mind a lot of that
stuff goes on up in the central and northern part of the state where they have these neanderthal
backwater kind of redneck yahoo's who are running the school systems and of course there are those
people here who try to do the same thing but um you know the amazing part of it is that over the last
several months thanks to our good friend you know this program and yours truly we've been investigated
by just about every agency except the cia and they find nothing wrong with a program nothing
inappropriate about anything that we're doing and the only problem they have is with a person
who's instigated the investigations yeah it it's bizarre you know i i look at it two different ways
the way that i look at it is uh your frustration shows through and uh it was a time for you more
or less to air what went on now that it becomes a legitimate news story but uh isn't it in a way
something that uh this character has been kind of looking for also the the you know the the
mention or the not mention of his name but the uh he's probably just getting off on the mention of
you know i don't know i don't think so a lot of people believe that but i you know he's he's been
reveling in the fact that he's been able to do all this without us being able to talk about it and
do it in the dark without you know people exposing what's been going on and now that people are
getting wind of it including the sponsors and they realize that they're not isolated or alone uh
you know they're prepared to respond believe me it's the greatest thing that could have happened
we thank sonny Rosenberg profusely absolutely i think the city of allen dale should hang its head
because it was used in this situation yeah but the the only other thing i want to say is for
anybody out there that wants the supporter continues to support your station yourself and Steve is
just a patronize responses at the bottom line you bet listen best of luck to all of you thanks a lot
Mike take care 25 past 11 that's Mike's been del and let me tell you about neutral system right now
linden susan will be here a little bit later oh d was you were sure nice to see spike for a second
or two it's 29 past 11 at w i o d let's take the mobile and then we'll get into this other
incredible story yes it is incredible mobile and broard hello yeah yeah man i've been out of town
for about a week now and i just tune in today what's going on what's what's he trying to do now
what's he trying to do now well the same thing he's been trying to do for 19 months and that is
get me off the air and he's been you know harassing our sponsors and harassing anybody's you know
i know and now he got the city of allen dale the other day to pass a resolution condemning the
program and all of this other baloney all right so now that it's a legitimate new story and it's
been written up in the newspapers we can talk about it and it's out of the closet so to speak
oh yeah yeah i've been listening to you ever since uh
uh cologne got in here and w i n z and uh i've been enjoying your show i've got nothing yet
great and all right well i just want to see what that was about well i wouldn't lose any sleep i mean
every we're going to be here but uh just one of those things in life you know there's always
got to be one yeah in every crowd okay listen you have a good one i just want to tell them to
oh that's going to be almost as big as ponderous that expression govern yourself accordingly
every one of his threatening letters at the end it always says govern yourself accordingly
which is just amusing itself anyway now wait a minute he can't go out of here you can't leave now
where the hell are you going no no no no forget about the phone call you you started the problem now
let's get into this this we're changing gears momentarily for just a bit but fat rich who tends to
be a radio yanta anyway yes uh told someone in the room it's not me so there's only one other person
in the room moments ago that captain Dave and this is like third hand somebody else told fat rich
who is telling the bird that captain Dave over at zeta made a scurrilous attack against the bird
on the air over their weaker soga which shocking that anybody would have heard it because nobody's
listening about that's what's amazing that is shocking but uh i find it very hard to believe because
capita calls me frequently and uh i don't he certainly never indicated to me any man amosity there
and davin i worked together years ago at love 94 and i thought we were friends and we worked together at
zeta and i never ever had any run in with Dave ever and if he went on the air and said things
about i'd like to hear from him yeah about allegedly he said he's the worst cackler the worst
something and anyway i have his home phone number or is there everything in my hand maybe we'll
call him on the air and get this straight now because i don't we shouldn't have any problems with
captain Dave i mean there are plenty of other people in that building that were not too fond of
sure i mean to someone else i could anybody in management over there but they're plenty of people
who are just subhuman douchebags over there but he's not one of me at least at the moment i thought
pretty good guy yeah it turns out that the story is true of course he will also be a that's right subhuman
douchebag but he never i'm there you know the year we worked on zeta with Dave nothing ever ever
how i never had the end you know for three people working together in a totally spontaneous thing
not even coming every there was never even the slightest problem well he's not among us i mean
there were other problems that i know on many of which were connected to what we're discussing
these last couple of days and of course there were those occasional problems with the
uh... moody program director who would come in the morning and then march into the control room while
we were on the air and give us dirty frowning hostile looks that happened on two or three occasions
which i found um... totally bushly and unacceptable and in fact he was in there constantly when i
could never figure that out you he loved it i don't know i don't know and he would like talk out
loud in the background while the show is going on i just i don't understand him at all at rose
but of course when you know guy named rose that uh... you got to have some questions about that
to begin with i don't know too many guys named rose you i know pete rose but not too many guys
named rose not about uh... here's a call from steward hello hello nil first time color when is
this isn't uh... i just got a crazy howl down story for you let me start by saying this i got
transferred down to this great town afforded out from jackson bill which in your words is a very
turmoil society up there
but i listen to the grease man was going to college up there so you are a virgin angel in my book
well let's let's let's just say angel let's leave the virgin part out of it's all right that
sounds great got a great howl and they'll story for you i was a little bit of computers and i had
appointment with the city of howl and i've been down here about two weeks just bought a brand new
nineteen eighty eight core that was really happy with it yeah all the color what color is it
it's dog gray who
but anyways i drove on friday's because howl and they'll was part of my territory
because of the crazy people down in a way they drive away the carry on so anyways make a long story
short i was stopped in front of diplomat mall the red light that i would across walk is and i'm
looking down on my paperwork preparing for this big meeting with the big city howl and they'll
and all of a sudden i hear this tremendous banging on my car and rattling and i look up
and here's these two old guys with keys in their hand banging on the hood of my car
so so obviously i get very upset i'm pulling the diplomat mall i get out of my car and i go up
to these two guys and i say what in the world are you doing have you lost your mind i said i
just spent thirty five thousand dollars i would go north oh yeah and so the guy looks at me and he

six three but there it goes man they're just sizzling today let me tell you they're just
foaming at the mouth uh where we go in two four lotterdale hello yeah like it's fucking new
speaking yeah yeah oh oh oh he confused me shocking hey i listened to that show the one that uh
somebody called and said something about this data show yeah uh but it wasn't uh camp day
who was it it was uh brad no well he was contributed but it was uh the kernel the private
whatever the kernel ah well here's a little explanation on the story now here's a gentleman who
is a w i o d spy yeah who heard the aforementioned uh business over there so it was the kernel
ripping the bird yeah because i guess the bird sits on about uh he mentions on about talent
or lack of uh something like that yeah uh what i did was i i heard a new idea i didn't know
you were there yeah i just came back all right i'm sorry uh what i did was i uh guess what he's
eaten for lunch he's got a b l t i uh i said that the show was the closest thing to unlistable i
had ever heard of my life which is correct which is correct and he really took offense to that
well that's a good explanation yeah because i was looking around at dials and i you know
dating never saw him but they're talking and he remember that sound effect the one i don't hear too
much and you guys go to the park you know that one yeah yeah it was kind of like this one yeah
well it's the bird you know they're the cat the cackel the one you guys use all the time and uh
but did he name me by name oh yeah yeah i had to call you the the world's luckiest human
really oh yeah it was pretty uh it was pretty intensive well when the when the next trend comes out
on the 24th of February he may be the the kernel maybe one of the world's unlucky to be working on
that particular radio station because they're going to have to get a magnifying glass to read the numbers
really so what he was saying was i had to talent and stuff like that yeah you were the world's luckiest
human and i would yeah that was basically it but they kept on on and on yeah well that's what it
was that's what i said and he was sort of like you know i want to tell you a little story okay and
i have never really gone through this before because i don't feel that we need to prove anything
because you know the the track record speaks for itself but back during the summer of 87 when we
were on i and z doing midday we we eventually got to see we had a nine cheer in the spring book
and then we got to see the breakdown of some of the uh numbers day by day and on the day before
i went on vacation on a friday we had average quarter hour listeners of 111,000 in the summer which
i don't think any station in this market has ever had an average quarter hour like that thank you
Sharon and uh the monday following that when i wasn't there Glenn was doing a show alone with
nobody else he had 93 or 94,000 people listening on that day without me okay right so anybody wants
to put him down and go into a song of dance is only doing it because of jealousy and because of
their own lack of ability to generate an audience yeah and it is a fact sir it isn't black and white
that the record ratings we got back then the nine and the seven five was when i was on the show
i agree you know uh the big ratings were when i was there i thought i'd do a little pink one
on you i appreciate it okay thanks a lot thanks for waiting in that uh you know of course i'm
behind all this i've been busing you guys you know a m and uh the other a m and uh
hey bergity to get job in those movies the other day i was impressed i thought i was listening to
text 30 uh now let's not go crazy and now you're really getting there remember pal what come
through round see you later right eleven forty seven at w i a day we have an open line in
brown word five two four nine four six three so you see i feel bad yeah you feel better because it
wasn't kept in day if it was uh the kernel with some help from bread the buck kissing uh kernel or
whatever it was for a little loop because it was ridiculous yeah i didn't make any sounds but you
know rich rich is very emotional guy and gets all carried away anyway after we do this break we have
thanks to our good friend mark mostly from power 96 we have halendale vice two which will be debuting

just can't believe this guy's actually got the hoots but to do this and the time and the time to do
and the time to do it oh i know the worst what a life huh talk about a rich full life man this guy
must have nothing better to do than go around and try to persecute people well it's a hobby you know
like baseball card collecting or stamp collecting i guess must be a hobby yeah i guess i mean if he's
got nothing better to do i mean what does he think he's gonna accomplish well create a lot of grief

first time caught i was trying to video stores and i've been paying attention to what's been
happening the last few days something very important to say about it when these types of
things happen uh censorship it is uh i look at these people as reactionaries yep you know uh
when we rent videos like what they see they can turn it off right uh when you listen to your car
radio of all things in the radio in your house if you don't like the material turn it off right
20 seconds okay um when this happens government uh uh it's almost communism you bet fascism
it's fascism exactly that putting when a city of hellendale wants to censor what's on a radio
in the greater community that's fascism that's the next step the other one she gets out of line i
tell a new now that does it stop okay on the steve came show the other day woman called in she
you know i listened to nail and i noticed i was developing things like that and then i stopped i didn't

wasting away i can't get all out of here
just the thoughts of metal musul and a radio
and how now they claim that it's a talk host to play but they know
they can't wait for her show

they just can't wait for her show

give us a bit of moral support seven of five seven seven five one six we're getting tons of
stuff on a facts machine and that's great and look at all this fruit wow now those seedless
oh they are seedless red ones today okay now who sent these Larry our friend Larry
it in notes from larry thanks a lot larry oh they do have seeds in them
well i'm sure glad rich got the seeds before either you're getting a look a little cd too by the way
okay now those of you got a phone just cool it for one second okay but we got kind of
distracted there because they had a phone call which was you know not all of exciting
but uh you know the way these things are right you really wasn't all exciting but it was okay
pompadow harness is coming into a big weekend and it's all part of the silver anniversary
celebration at pompadow park this Friday night pompadow is presenting an exciting exhibition
that'll please everybody in a family of all ages especially those kids the world famous cool
muffled d 1214 we want to thank larry for the fruit and everybody's just going nuts over the
fruit here at w i only that ought to provoke another letter huh oh yeah okay let's go to
pompadow hello hello Neil yes sir yeah first of all i thought from my support second of all i like
to pay why i would fact you something on the machine it's really easy to get through if anybody's
wondering how hard it's going to be great 757 7516 um i know i'm still not anything to do with the
uh how and they'll people but i like to know what happened to uh over jr he calls his once in a
while once in a while he jm yeah well he's not in uh he's not in your support group or oh yeah
yeah i'd like to hear from him if he's out there okay i'm sure he is man i bet you you ask for him
it's like asking for fall harby junior to call it just a matter of moments i understand i know
think it even okay thanks well 1215 and wild we have a request now we're getting requests for
callers now do you like that we cut out requesting for songs now we're getting requests for callers
if vegi and bokeh's calling in come on be careful now with it you gotta be careful with that air i can't
stay mad at the vege can you he just he just wanted a bumper sticker that's all he just wanted us to
arrange our lives uh for his convenience he's just a big fan you don't want to hurt his feelings do
he's a nealy yeah yeah so to speak anyway joey is on his way i don't know whether joey's walking
what do you have to sell his car come on joey get serious will you but uh oh you did send him a
bumper sticker already so if the vege calls that that can't be the excuse anymore i got a great idea
i think we just ought to do this spontaneously okay because it sounds like it makes sense to me
if people will send letters of support to me oh we will send them one of those new
unbelievable new Rogers wio debumper stickers how's that sound that's a good way to get a lot of
people off there but because most people want something you know we won't send him any tapes
a bumper sticker sure and we'll have rich mail them and in very tiny Hebrew letters in the back
i'm gonna write some really racy stuff okay so that's a good idea just send your letters and
request for the bumper stickers the near Rogers wio d mi m e three three one four one they read
they don't look too bad it look good as a matter of fact it's great isn't that a good idea and
sharing of course can fill all the requests and there's more stuff what is this oh this is uh oh
you know i understand that don't panic do not panic but do remember that god loves you okay
uh let's go to a mobile in Palm Beach hello Neil yes sir yeah it's what it calls the high to you

out what his numbers are check his account balance get his money out i wanted to kill him Neil

hey nil yeah what's up um i want to speak to glim from the guy ask you a question yeah what's
happening uh not a heck of a whole lot okay anyway um i heard something like some about some
I tried to like rag on going all and try to put them down and i just wanted a compliment going on
something i heard uh two weeks ago we had the riots down in Miami um a caller called up from
California he was here for the super bowl oh yeah remember that sure vividly yeah and come on
you're here normally a laid back kind of guy it's right i rarely ever will say something i
save that for when i really mean it yeah but that was just grime because you just kind of like
exploded and that was incredible yeah because i mean you were writing an assessment of him he was in
asshole and uh i was really impressed good both thanks a lot yeah i gneal yeah um i'm a friend of

take it easy bye 20 minutes past noon at wio day we have an open line in brow word five two four
nine four six three five two four wio d here's a call from haldale good afternoon nailing
blin yes i am a long time listener and a first time caller well i hope this call isn't being traced by
sunny no it's not anyway congratulations on your great three publicity in the haldale die
jesse i normally pick it up at the weekend but i couldn't wait to get it today to see what they
had written about you um anyway i just wanted to share a story with you i picked up my 10-year-old
daughter yesterday from school and of course she always misses you but she likes listening to
on sess day morning and she has Steve paint talking about you and she said mommy what's happened
to nail rogers so i told her very very briefly and her answer was what all we have to do is turn the
dial now this is from a 10-year-old kid and so it makes you wonder you know what the old people
are all about i mean i've lived in halandell for seven years or i should say i have survived in
halandell for seven years and uh it's pretty sad in a way you know i'm hoping to learn a very very
dear lesson for the future anyway another thing i wanted to mention to you i would be interested
to know whether mr. Thompson's law firm is behind him in all this uh or whether he he practices on
his own on his own yeah oh he does well that's out and also it's amazing because um the florida bar
has been receiving over the last few months a lot of adverse publicity um in their dealings with
clients etc etc and i'm surprised that he wants to bring even more attention to um colleagues and
whoever you know in the florida bar it doesn't say an awful lot for the dogs bringing a lot of
attention to themself and he really ought to govern himself accordingly you know what i'm saying
well i mean it's very very interesting because the law is very different from england where i come
from and um it will be very interesting to see what happens but i'm totally on your side and says
my ten-year-old daughter and i have just about ten minutes ago meld a pro-neil letter excellent
we appreciate it and i wish you lots and lots of luck thanks a lot for i'll say hi to sonny for us
i will do okay bye bye 23 minutes past noon at wiod we have an open line in in hale and
day all at five two four nine four six three five two four ancient in hale and and um
much she was very nice there are a lot of nice people in hale and day only send them our sympathy for
having to live there yeah anyway joley is on the way isn't he that's what we hear that's the
popular hearing this one of these minutes man he just may show up okay right now maybe joley
stopped off at char-hut for a great life top 26 at wiod and let's go to myami hello hello yes sir
are you familiar with the uh Halloween hale outhouse caper i sure am uh well in retrospect perhaps
you shouldn't be so hard on these people from hale and day all forgetting caught up by those
guide pumps and i mean that kind of mentality caper in around sixty seven-year-old guy
slipping in an outhouse in the middle of the night yeah that should tell you how you're something
okay well said sir thank you very much okay you're welcome 26 past noon at wiod
boy those grapes are delicious yeah i'm gonna old choked up we have an open line in day seven five
one air goes uh bokeh hello uh good afternoon nail yes sir hey listen i got a solution to uh that
fool and how and nails problem your problem and my own problem yeah uh a few uh maybe it's been a
couple years back i think you made an offer that if somebody gave you like a million bucks you'd
get out of the market yeah okay well you're worth much more than a million dollars by now i'm
making a lot more now since up to two million him okay we're here's there's a big problem to this
actually there's two problems why don't you make them that offer again maybe say uh buy out your
contract and come up with a couple of million bucks yeah the problem is it's how's he gonna raise
two million bucks and how and Dale well maybe we could sell a discount packs of sweet and low that
might do it well i see i'm uh thinking you know whatever it takes to get the job done and uh you know
when you move out of the market you have to tell me where you're going so i can move there myself
yeah well i'd probably keep it a big secret because you never know who else might move along with me
you know no no no no you got to tell everybody where you're moving to because so we can just follow
you there okay well make a long story short i'm not going anywhere okay uh well for two million
bucks no uh maybe well dark on cuz he doesn't have to see i'd have to see the cash first okay when
you see it in the front of you then you know it adds a different dimension yeah the child the old
saying talk is cheap right the chances are real slim that they could raise two million bucks in
a ton like that yeah and then uh the second problem was i want to share or two okay and then now
well good luck you sir it's been a great call but it's getting really ponderous 1228 at WIOD we
have an open line in bokeh 278 9463 278 WIOD and let's go to Miami hello hello Neil yes
hello Neil hello Glenn hi hey uh i hear you from time to time you keep telling people if they don't
like your program that she's just simply trying it all that is correct they have other old
alternatives but the real truth of the matter is this Neil that there are no other WIOD programs
you are mr radio well if that's the case then uh you know that's the bottom line sir that's right
your radio then they got nothing to complain about that's right nissidently you did mention
yesterday you wanted to send a box of halva with some x-lacks up the sunny i don't
mention you i remember you saying that well let me put it to you this way it couldn't hurt no but

on because i have a soft heart and the mobile people always you know make everybody else wait a
lifetime Miami hello oh no yeah yeah i got a blue hair observation for you yes sir yeah we're
gonna grocery store and you'd be amazed at how many people are actually shopping for the first
time in their life because to me they come in there they're lost i mean but so many people buy
milk for the first time in their life to stand there for five minutes and just wonder what this
well it's a very complex thing to do you know i don't end grocery shopping yeah i mean it's like the
first time everybody in their life because every time asking where is it at where's the milk at
where's the milk at every if you know it's the same thing over and over and over again yeah and then
of course they go into the meat department and squeeze the meat which always just wine drags me nuts
right and then when they get up there they have a hole in the package when they're nails through
yeah but the the thumprin in the meat is little you know the where it's okay if they take it but
then when they leave it you know but yeah then that that's the reason if you squeeze one the next
one you get to be a good one and you just throw that there we're back because now that's an
interesting philosophy life if you squeeze one the next one you get's gonna be a good one i
just definitely words to live by and i got one other thing um sometimes i go to fiu and you know
i listen to wolfie release when i'm down there because it's like a hero but they're not on that
package that's about my girlfriend that really yeah she don't have a show on that station does she

Palm Beach hello yeah hi Neil hi hi just wanted to call and tell you i drive back and forth
between Palm Beach and Miami every day every day every day my office is up there and most of my
businesses down in Miami and if it wouldn't be for you guys and Steve i'd never make it especially
during the traffic jam plan i 95 yeah by the way i don't know if anybody told you about a a pair of
signs that we've got in Palm Beach on the turn bike you're heading north going towards Palm Beach
they got one sign that says west Palm Beach 7 miles or land oh 162 five feet behind if there's
another sign says west Palm Beach 11 miles or land oh 170 yeah they know what they're doing man
oh you're right on top of it i i figured maybe the town moves so they just you know they have two signs
yeah just in case it ever does right okay you guys have a great day and take care and as soon as
I get back to the office i'll be faxing a letter out to you thanks a million for making our
okay we're getting tons of good stuff on the fax machine that was a great idea that i had if i do say
so myself miles of stuff now when you're talking about Helen don't go saying miles in the same
breath okay it's very tasteless 757 7516 is that number for the fax machine for all you
suits out there that have fax machines now i guess a lot of people especially businesses have got
all sure 757 7516 our like the Sharon is just racing in here with the fax machine stuff
i told you we keep her busy somehow you know look at that in credible i guess we we really can't
get Larry King into record that number that would be excellent Larry Kent i'm here the question
for the bird how do you feel about Donna Dixon not my time movies that Dave Dixon sister movie star
and it says by the way do you guys walk around like they didn't talk radio during the show yes
we do as a matter of a they put us on a leash so we can only get as far as the door
let's go to Miami hello hello yes hello uh deal yes sir i just wanted to say that we supported you
and we had a letter out Tuesday thank you to support you and uh one thing i want to remind you of
that i you know i listen to you most every day some days when i have to go out i put you on a tape
and one day about three weeks ago you had a real hilarious story about the
balanday commission with a guy named freebie with his doc and all that yeah the doc that was
uh six inches too long right oh yeah right yeah and i i had a leave right in the middle of that
and i i stayed until the last minute and i taped it and i just happened to hear listen to that
tape again this morning and i said yeah to remind you about that yeah but you hadn't mentioned it
and it was a real funny story about something about his doc being a couple inches too big and he
was in front of the commission and they first approved it and then they uh they rescinded the
primate and all that and he was in all kinds of trouble they called each other names yeah do you
remember that story as you're how can you forget it yeah and i were just wondering that uh you know
if you contacted that guy or whoever he is uh uh i forgot what the names were but uh
you contacted that guy for uh to go down with you he he has the same harassment problem as
everybody else that goes down from that company yeah absolutely yeah well i guess they got no real
problems over there in hell and there would you that's probably a great PR thing for them for the
chamber of commerce over there because when you live in a city that only has time for stuff like
this they must have everything under control yeah you said it you said it well okay i just want to
remind you about that because i noticed it was so close to you know not exactly like your story but
you know just another problem with that commission that everybody seems to be having it's unbelievable
okay good luck to you have a good time thanks a lot it's 1242 at wio d we have an open line in
dade county at 751 wio d don't forget steve this afternoon has a program on pornography and
Ted Bundy and of course almost everybody in the world now is to see that tape that ridiculous
contrived uh tape about Ted Bundy and all these you know he always had to have somebody else to blame
for everything that he did anyway the three guests on a panel will be sue the censor
none of that sue su the censor the censor yeah oh sue come of the censor yeah
Fred shots sex expert probably you see more pornography than almost anybody in the world even steve
and Norman Kent who of course uh he know well okay who is an attorney who defends first amendment
situations just like the one we're talking about a hellendale hello hello sir yes sir
i want call and tell you that i really support you i'm from Los Angeles and i'm here on a work
released for five months and i think you and uh Glenn are fantastic the best radio i've ever heard
well if you're from la that's probably true they got some pretty boring stuff out there yeah can
acts uh it's just uh all talk and uh no good talk yeah and all those boring people on k a bc i went
to uh the uh city of helendale offices this morning to do some business and uh i saw a brand new
blue vat in there so the blue hairs are driving blue vats now yeah you know and then i picked up that
helendale tattler that uh new paper yeah the helendale digest not to be confused with the Hollywood
sun tattler you know so you get these big papers man in the big cities and they all they like
blend together it's confusing but uh uh that that they're really rippin you apart i mean that is uh
taken the first amendment uh the way you should be taken the first amendment yeah if they can do it
and uh be little out of people uh i can't see why you can you can't do it and be a wonderful
joestar about it all yeah well we are that's the amazing part and we're going to continue to do it
and those people who think that they're going to you know single handedly dictate what we can say
there you got a real surprise coming they can write all the cute little letters and all the
cute articles that they want but they got a real surprise uh you know Hitler died 44 years ago okay
um i you know being from a wide open place like Los Angeles and San Francisco coming here to
this closed-minded yeah it's a it's a culture shock you may want to reconsider my friend
well it's the mind well at least when you live here you can see the sun you know when you're in
LA you never you know it's up there but you never see it at least here you see it you see it and
boy it takes a long time to get to the the sun though because these people drive so slow yeah
there's uh uh uh and everybody is either from back east and 150 years old or from a foreign
country that i can't understand yet right i know i do that's why it makes for good communication
well listen it's great here for me you have a good one and after a couple of more years you'll
really hate it okay okay thank you okay thanks 1245 and wiod we have an open line in brownward
524 9463524 wiod boy look at this Sharon is just a busy busy child today with these
fax machine notes Joey what is when is Joey coming like a week from sookis uh uh uh

don't go reading this on here but it's a little cartoon it's a two-part cartoon that you're really
get a great chuckle out of that fax machine
okay let's see what are we doing we have an opening in brownward 524 wiod
deal go to Miami hello uh nale yeah how you doing great i want to say something is my philosophy
about people in howl and down the difference between the old people in my and my me beach yes
people in my me beach are educated they know how to turn a dial you may be right people in howl
has them brainwash that they can't turn it yeah so uh mason dual letter addressed to him
well maybe sonny still has one of those old uh what do they call those radios with the crystal set
yeah you know that only tunes in one station well i'm mason dual letter to send him and i hope
there's no restriction on what we can say not as long as we got anything to do about it okay thanks
a lot 1246 at wiod we have an open line in date 751 wiod 751 946
by the way our attorney friend thinks that i called him a flaming fegalo or so he alleges and
something i just saw uh haven't done that at any point my reference to that is always to sonny
Rosenberg the mayor of howl and they'll know any reason i say that is to remind the audience that
he used that line about me two years ago which is a totally bigoted and disgusting homophobic
remark uh and for the mayor of a of a for a public official in any city to be making that comment
is just reprehensible but that should give you an idea of his mentality where he's coming from
so if they're god forbid any gay people who live in hallowed day or you might want to check around
and move out okay because obviously the mayor of your city has got some serious problems with homophobia
serious serious serious serious serious look at that these staff at my mean international airport
great okay the phones will be ringing over there my mean international any minute now so
govern yourselves accordingly let's take our break here now and that'll give us a little time
for some of these calls when we come back it's 1247 at wiod i'll turn on the old rogers
only right there pal don't touch that dial oh my god it's sunny

great and all my friends listen to you my kid listen to you and they're young they're under five
and i love you still and i just wanted to make a point these people in hell and they're
hard against you there's so many other causes to get involved with worthwhile the homeless
you know i mean you remember a kid who's been kicked out of the country many of them
why don't they send their time doing something worthwhile well because the the small group of
individuals you're talking about are a bunch of hateful malicious uh nasty bitter people who you
know the who are the stereotyp of the things we talk about here all of time yeah and because they
relate to what they understand that's why it hits a raw nerve with them because they can't they
can't stand the exposure i guess that's what it is but anyway i want to let you know that you have
a lot of supporters out there and i want to call my friend Tommy and my wager douche bag
okay okay i'll second end motion and again some support by mail as well thanks a
minute we appreciate it okay bye 1254 at wiod this was handed to me you should read this and you

grandchild born on twos day to share in a kneeled bush and generate a meal that's cute

heal yes sir how's it going buddy terrific pal all right i just want to let you know that we're all
standing behind you in support every time i turn around i see all these people like several yards
behind not well not not that close okay um did you read article in the howl deal digest today
we sure did we tell we read parts of it on the air yeah i like i like the one that said the
cities crusade against rogers eventually died a natural death because of a lack of support according
to the ayatola in tindola what's this problem that guy well i think lack of common sense lack of any
you know since they can't do anything positive about the real problems over there they have to make
a lot of simmiss about this kind of stuff yeah tell me this uh also Thompson said that it's not
a vendetta against you not a personal vendetta oh yeah how long has been going on with him only 19
months oh yeah not that's serious nothing important uh you know something in the spare time
it's funny i manage a condo just just south of the daybroward line in uh the aventura area
and we've got some very nice elderly people and we get along just wonderfully
mm-hmm well there's a lot there a lot of them out there i'd say i'd say even maybe 30 40 percent
of our senior citizens are reasonable rational people who you know feel a lot younger than their
real age and that's great yeah so then we have that other gigantic and i have to take
exception with one thing steve yet said yesterday said it's just a small handful of these people it's
not true at all they're a gigantic numbers of people out there who's behavior in restaurants and
supermarkets on a highway everywhere they go is just absolutely socially unacceptable we we have a
few that are just sourpuses but i think those people have been sourpuses all their life yeah yeah
they were they were prunes when they were 15 and 20 you right neo you hang in there buddy we're
hanging we love you thanks bye 1256 at wiod and we have a little crisis on the phone not a major
one we got a couple of open lines that's a little crisis what do you say well pombi
to of course one inbroward now there goes uh date is ringing one inbroward 524 wiod well that
fruit is really coming back strong but it was good thanks Larry the fruit was great what is in
it is that grape fruits are oranges or what wow oh yeah and linden suzen are going to be here at
two o'clock almost forgot about that with neutral system okay and a pombi
line is also wide open man i know that comes as a great shock to you that's the only way to get
through as i speak right now the six five five nine four six three six five five wiod are we
talking loud enough for you in pombi? Miami hello hey meal yeah um one of the things i think the
prop near the problem might be with these old forts the reason they don't turn their dial is
they're afraid they're going to miss something hysterically funny yeah you know they can't
turn it off which is true because yeah do you say something that's going to offend them but it's
a serically funny anyway by the way just got this you're going to love this nick just gave me a note
on the screen it says he's getting some calls from older people who hate me then they crank
nick and they hang up they well they don't have the guts to stay on the line and make fools of
themselves on a year no so they're harassing him on the phone now if they hate me now seriously
if they hate me and are that obnoxious then how come they're still listening right now because
they're obnoxious exactly great term for we're giving them fodder for their lives in other words
this is what their whole lives are about our bitterness and hate and being nasty and rotten and try
to spread it around and so we're obviously because they hate it so much we're doing a pubic service
for them yeah i was listening well i was listening to Steve yesterday and listening to some people
call up trying to give some kind of point why they didn't like you yeah and they couldn't back
anything that they were saying yeah well every time he kept answering asking a question they would
go on to something out total non-sequitur they couldn't answer the question right if it's more
if it's more or less the why don't you like Neil yeah and their answer was because because the
sun is in the sky okay listen you have a good one now thanks a lot okay we got a celebrity

six three we've got a mobile and pond beach hello this is alan bird who are you
finally a good tape now wait a minute that well maybe that wasn't a tape maybe that was him
oh gee i shouldn't have done that you know maybe that was really him
you think so i sounded like a tape to me yeah what do you think yeah was it him was it tape tape
well that would be i would be crushed if it turns out that was really him wonderful call
no well listen he left a real mark an indelible mark on his stage no tell you that in fact that's
why they brought these new chairs in today okay okay let's go to a del Rey hello
hello yes sir deal yeah do you think i'll be on Saturday
because the greatest hits best of nil oh i don't have any idea we're not taping this
are no no i can't help it on listen don't waste any good material it shows only a one-time deal
hey can you put me back on hold okay good hey let's just leave everybody on hold okay so
that can air the show these must be people with frozen radio dials or look at that since that
alan bird call like three lines just dropped off at the same time simultaneously i'm serious look
at the phone is like clearing out now plus when i heard that joy might show up this hour that
was probably good for two of those lines in okay let's go to fort lauderdale hello no okay there's four
in an amazing that we go through three hours everything was just like well this is the big one
to tell that's true this is the big one to two out yeah everything was just great in all of
a sense like we ran into a brick wall it is so typical in this town i'll tell you there's an
open line in brown word five two four w i'll do lots of other ones are flashing don't
to get too carried away my amry hello yes sir listen i'm not calling too much to talk on the topic
because it's kind of like arguing for child abuse i mean for what this guy's doing is wrong and i
think everyone see that i don't think you've gotten too many positive comments on his side
okay we haven't gotten any on this show Steve got a couple but that's about it but i think
that's listening to last couple days i've heard a lot of it been uh
relayed on freedom of speech it seems more like persecution here than than uh trying to change
the content of your show it doesn't seem like anyone's really trying to say kneel should take this
out or this is or put this hand or something like that or you're saying get rid of kneel and they
hadn't that been the case for the last two years no no he he objects to peace by being no matter
what we do you know no matter whether it's music or anything and then of course if we take it out
then he finds ten new things that he objects to show you know the bottom line as he wants to give me
off and he continues denying that but i mean anybody who's got an IQ over two who looks at the
pattern of the things that have been done and how malicious they are could come to no other conclusion
believe me well i got to tell you you're lucky i got to tell you that i feel like you're lucky to
have the support you've got at this station because recently i went to something along the same
line not not to the extent you are and allegations were made now is removed from a position
completely unfounded allegations and you know uh... inflammatory uh... slanderers
oh my god and when i'm trying to find out is uh... where the allegations of you know i've heard
you said they said you were trying to pick up boys and everything oh yeah but it was any of that
ever published the paper on joey just kissed me now watch it joey once fall out what's that was
any of those allegations ever published in the in the print magazine are are sure absolutely
because they they one of the local papers called all of the my story and publish it and
they're unfounded and they didn't even try to contact either the parties involved
yeah i was wondering if there's any records or if you get yourself a good lawyer pal that's what
you got to do yeah because the basically i i'm not going to be able to work in uh... they count
well so get a good lawyer and so they're as okay okay no thanks about okay good luck
problem it's after one i just received a kiss on the cheek i got what's in the lift from joey
Reynolds and that is shocking okay who would have ever dreamed don't you think it's time
okay now we got to do a break so look at that he's got all kinds of filthy stuff he just brought in

man it was such a monster and of course that's what joy was working there was a monster
and they went automated or something it's like they just i don't understand that well and when
you go back up there like in rochester w-h-a-m which used to be this big boring but a big a-m station
they're playing oldies and stuff now all right let me get a word and that's why it's here for a second
yes sir i'll go ahead and listen this is a big time i'll eat my fruit if you pardon that
i mean if you could only listen for a minute just listen for a minute just one second i try to
teach you okay all right when i was a kid when i first started a radio i was a kid my reasons
for getting into radio were because i was a poor kid and we were in a i was the last-wide family
in all black neighborhood my family was we wanted to get out of there we had no money we had a
why did you want to get out there we were in poverty that's i hated poverty you were racist that
what you don't know i wanted to get out of the neighborhood we were in we had nothing we had a
thirty dollar a month cold water flat so the best way that i could express myself was to go to the
boys club play basketball to the boys yeah and they had up what is this like an announcement we
have coming today i saw you hanging around the playground there i was on the pay system i know who
you've been talking to listen to me all right when i first got into radio the reasons for radio were
to serve the public and have fun with the public we were trying to entertain folks the next level
came up we're trying to entertain the owners so that we get the good jobs now the next level
that came up we're entertaining the sponsors so we would get some national business now we're
entertaining banks and radio is really come from what i said when it was a mom a pop store do you
understand what he's talking about that really no evolution of radio it's gotten it's gotten to be
a scientific game it used to be an art now it's a science that's all i'm saying they got everything
figured out a lot of radio yeah everything figured out a lot of radio if you heard if you heard
the radio in this market i got news where they got nothing figured out all right now there's not
much bad radio in this town that's because no one's dealing with the dynamic the dynamic is
that we have a a my name is pinto my real name it's no kidding it's an Hispanic name so i came to
work here i was Larry King's news you were Italian well i am Italian but so what does that mean see
now he's trying to make it out with wqba okay you talk about trolling for a job he's going to
it's a Hispanic man makes he's gonna start doing a little Spanish jokes you were you were Larry
Kent news Larry King Larry King's news yeah and i was at whammy and my ammy wammy and my when you
were just a kid you were at cat wkat and i ran you right so i was what do you see having
out the twilight zone music yes yes yes so they l'amagnana what a view of ráher

today joe i did that over macy's thank you well you gonna turn around web you know and okay
now where were we were giving us this exciting story the evolution of radio with joe renoll to go
ahead i didn't realize now why didn't you come in earlier what do you mean the evolution of radio
could could have killed the whole frown i figured the last hour or at least killed the lead
and we could have done okay now oh now come on be honest baby it is hot against about you you made
him hot against you know the guy was dying here until you got here that's the truth what did he
had Paul Harvey and what else and the other three and Paul isle this is Paul isle and
a board op did some shows here was good and alan burk who uh... really who died one year ago and
nobody talk well i think i got his juices got flowing in when he saw morten donnie make his success
because that was kind of his act you know like a jolpine thing although mortes kind of his act
yeah more at least he more to live that makes a big difference what's my friend you know i've
learned to live we live together doc he's straight up no kidding well i thought you like to know
don't get it and he doesn't have a homosexual now do you call them doc
yeah i can't talk uh... you know why
why does initials are md
portant and that was his name here was done on the doc now that's why i thought i can
thought he wasn't here it was an Orlando what is this man who has gone to go on from wkbw
a-ha-ha-ha-ha to the evolutionary of the science i don't science and think you know i think
is what we're talking about god you are like i'm like an asshole weak and you really are
like you drop some heavy duty acid or something we're listening to this guy
okay go ahead I'm sorry if you're right if you don't write it out and
I love what you say we're in Alan P.
awesome Palm Beach no no Alan P.
Alan P.
Alan P.
was a disc jockey who years ago took P.
O. and confessed to it and Peter Trimett W. M. G. M.
he never confessed to it but he did take P. O.
you know that love is strange by Mickey and Sylvia 1956 the record was number
one and it wasn't in a record store yet I mean at least if you're going to
take some money you know give it a few days
that's a huge story and that was Peter Trimett the curry had it
getting the third row at W. M. G. M.
as a kid growing up and I mean just a very very young child I was listening to
W. M. G. M.
went a big signal in the evening out of New York and Rochester and he had
some problems you know you're doing what about Stan Roberts I am really
you are and my ratings were better than yours but that's beside the
point there were twice and so was so was the test pattern but anyway well
look you were on in impossible she don't make some good
alibi he was you know on the station it just isn't making it talk about
dead well it's not an easy palace you've coming back yeah she is making
a turn around at least it's coming back to what they originally stood for
listen let's put let's put it this way radio's in the record business all
right except for these talk instances this happens to be one can we do another
break now because we got a lot of business on the station this isn't some like
podon isn't like being on Zeta this is not free food and Gulfstream that is
correct although if you like some food we got a lot of food and we'll come back
to talk about more upstate New York radio yeah we can talk about other things
I'm worldly are you sure yeah okay
that's true he's been everywhere man this guy's like a one-eighths walking road map
yeah it's 125 at W.I.O.D. Joey is with us today and we'll come right back
there comes a time in every person's life when they have to decide where to order
pizza I know you're thinking come on what's the big deal a pizza's a pizza wrong
all pizzas are not created equal and Miami pizza every pizza is handmade
custom ordered just like you like it with the freshest ingredients and the
personal attention you won't find it these so-called fast you I.O.D. I'm getting
to hate this what a show now you're gonna be astonished when I tell you this
did you ever hear me play Wild Weekend by the Rock and Rebels no yeah I heard
you play that yes I have on Swan Records yeah well you know my manager was
Tony Marrella who will have Swan Records okay I ran into one of these kids in
Buffalo and he was playing in a bar in some obscure place and he told me the
whole thing about you and Tommy Shannon and Wild Weekend it was incredible and
that's that record was re-released down on how many times and sold over a
million copies and that was Tom Shannon's never sold him yeah he said it sold
ten copies okay boxes one of them my basement doing yes that never sold but
anyway so to make a long story short guy sends us a copy of this from was it
from XYZ and I remember you see you don't realize this I was in Michigan I think I
may have been living in Detroit I'm not sure when you were at WXYZ is that
when the brand-end happens to you no I heard those shows okay what do you like
about can't raise at that sexy news jingle is that what you kids like my voice
is an octave higher before I worked for Wayne Newton and Lee Allen was on
here over there and Joel Sebastian may he rest in peace yeah he was a good guy
and those were the great days in Detroit right now that's great days now you're a
star your star but how many what the year you know about the great
golden day the good and Buffalo look at what you've done here never had any
help to come back who the hell could get stand major to work again I mean
you're the only good boy they're working too well now I'll tell you that
you know you probably be responsible for my career observes and switch that
while you're here today yeah I got to hold your breath got to have a little
profile here how come I can't work in the market what did I know did I
commit a heinous crime by not having numbers yes I feel like Dustin Hoffman you
know I had my to see and now I'm living with my star and I'm waiting for my
rainman you know if I get that I'll be there's a metaphorical comparison like I
have never heard of any I'm a wonderful actor yes is that so anyway tell us
about because the real purpose of your being here in spite of all this other
preliminary BS no is that the purpose of that you're like fucking a more
downy show I was I want to come over when you're gonna get out more it was a
former roommate of yours I'm on tonight I have a personal tape when you just
relax don't you talk to the bird that way he's my little bird okay he can be gone
in two seconds in fact now maybe how would you feel sitting over there yeah
yeah you're right I could be like Howard Stern's Robin yeah you look a little
like Robin anyway now when are you gonna get at me I would more downy Neil
when when more it was here at the moment let me it take let me answer one question
I'm a personal tape that more did for me or you know you very well
like you work because he was here Williams I love me he hurt you he heard you
on the air not hurt you heard you he heard you when he was here at the Miami
Convention Center and you're supposedly going to be there and be introduced
from the stage nobody ever told me that he mentioned you from the stage you
were not there nobody told me I was there how the hell could I have been there
well someone must have told you you were mentioned from the stage you know it's
like a town hall meeting you know these public appearances he does they were not
taping his show it was nobody invited me to be there well you were on the stage
I mean you were mentioned from the stage you're great I am a star here and you
answer my question when you get me on a show tonight it's on tonight you don't
want to be positioned as trash radio like I was I don't introduce me as tonight
he will open that microphone and he will say now here is the you ready for this
the grandfather of schlock you want to be known as that hey listen if it gets me
if he made 22 million last year okay 40 40 million while he reported 22
huh okay more well it's been nice knowing you man you're gonna like those nice
private rooms they give you anyway so you're gonna be on tonight and they
talked about trash radio and he introduces me as the schlockmaster you know like
he's the salt and a sleaze and here I get this yeah but this is all can try
I mean his whole show is can try you guys set this up ahead of time and you
love it no you did not tell me that you threw me a left-con by doing the
expo tree a thing and I am the world's most shameless self promoter I really
am but certainly not the king of sleaze no I mean I am the if anything I'm in the
whole of shy why didn't he have Howard on that show Howard who
hmm co-surn Howard Stern well Howard Stern doesn't do those gangbangs he
refuses to be on a gangbang the first lesson in those shows because you only
get your moment and if it's not a brilliant moment you die so therefore I
don't recommend you do that by the way Howard is not good on TV anyways horrendous
on TV he's tried more like he was gonna do that Fox Hill that never material
100 times he promoted it and it never materialized then he did that videotape
that he's made a fortune off of yes horrendive you seen it yeah it's not too long
it's got a few you know it's got its moments but overall it's pathetic Howard
does not a TV person as a half hour special it would have been fine I like
don't you like trash absolutely me you know those are hysterical uncertain days
you know you know trash and bad trash that is correct I heard you say that and of
course we put all of our trash in the plantation bags of God for God doesn't get
removed oh gee we have to talk about plantation I love how I'm down I love the
sweet and lower routine that you do I brought that to New York and claimed it
as my own material what was that routine you do about the early Bruce
but well wait wait till I get a more downy man I'm gonna expose you anyway
speaking of Helen Dale be sure to join me for a day at the races this Sunday
February 12th at 11 30 at Gulf Stream Park which is in Helen Day so I you're right
you're right in the bill is in a mail joy no I was the first the first day that I
got the record one of our listeners sent me that record in fact that's where most
most of this stuff comes from is listeners you'd like rats in my room yeah I mean
you got it that's pretty obscure to be able to go back and find that thing you
know who still is the most is Robin William so he'll go to watch young comics in
a club and he take the material home with him like it's his own he's brilliant
but he does it he's got a time where's Tommy Shannon Tommy

makes a regular run he's back and forth he gets a detroit job then a Buffalo
job now it's four four times in each market he's a real good guy Tommy
Shannon was a school teacher who was a dish-jockey on weekends and got to be a star

I know I know now what determines your show you got a brother sitting there in
a control room with one of those boogie hats on and a guy he's not never he
never laughs at nothing this guy no that's true is that the meat if he ever even
snickers man you know it's gonna be a worry and here he is this guy the brother
here he's got a four-foot cross he's wearing around his neck with
crucifix he says if you say something funny he'll laugh at it I know I'm not

you get that all by the way you know Steve is older than Joey yeah oh my he'll
never live that down man we discovered that today I don't think anybody was
older and you are well yeah but anyway when you were destroyed the big station
how about big Wilson on the wonderful aisle of dreams the big station was
Keener 13 yeah and for my money that's the greatest AM rock stage and it's
ever been on the year that was incredible station with Dick Burton yeah and Bob
Green and Gary Michael Wilson and Gary Stevens and boy what a station that was
here at fun what a monster of a station that once yeah and Dick Burton of course
is still in the grandest is one of the best guys in a business yeah he's a
fan of yours too he's another now are you serious Dick Burton yeah he's my
idol in the business he called me one day and he you know he's got about eight
kids yeah they're all girls who got to see he's not ready they had a great
billboard campaign why you gonna listen to me I'm gonna continue with these
homophobic cards they had a great billboard campaign in Detroit years ago
and on all the expressways they had big billboards and it showed a caricature
of Burton with a big sore red thumb and it said pick up Dick Burton on the
Southfield Expressway the John Lodge Expressway depending where you were
driving it was a great billboard campaign well he's got realized he's got
nothing to do with anything but he's a fan of yours he's got me one day since I'm
in Florida and I like this neo-rod to see you know him and I said yeah but he's
opposite me and I said he's beaten the hell out of me so let's talk about it
which was the case at the time now you're not I got to get a hold of him someday
on here he's a tremendously funny guy let call him he knows very well the guy
that works with him that there's all a voice Tom Ryan you sound right used to
be there's some right or really yeah Tom Ryan was a funny guy yeah do we have to
go no oh boy yours see he is so insecure man which shows you what business no

constantly insecure don't you have to play it here's a mobile somebody's
spending money to talk to you hello hey Neil yeah hey you know what what I was
I think I answered my own question because I was gonna ask if he had ever heard
that the Neil headroom thing where you tell the lady you think she's old enough to
be Joey Reynolds mother yeah
no no material so I'm probably so bad but not oh no I stole his materials that
what you think no no Joey I would never say he would have done that he'd still be
on the air I was a star when Neil is in diapers get up my back what what I was
like one of the four people that used to listen to you on she I had to you're
selling the hell out of me I couldn't stand Neil and we have because I never
listened to him and my friends told me all listen to him listen to me and you
believed all that crap you were used to say about me that's the problem Neil did a
great job Neil great I beat me and I don't mind admitting it and he did a great
job and I and I don't listen when you're a championship fighter and you get in
the ring with another champ and the other champ knocks you out and he's a better
fighter you got to come up and say hey listen the guy did a great job I don't
I thought picture you Joey at Hooters you don't wait but a buck oh five no I'm
a I'm a good looking guy now you're not gonna ruin myself a steam I'm just
gonna tell you where I lost the ratings war but myself seems another star you're
in trouble when Michael Jackson outweighed you and I'm a great lover and I'm not fat
and stop it although I wasn't one time I was going to go to Joey's faces all
at one piece though I like Michael so it's not too bad yeah I lost a lot of weight
