Okay, it's 1007 at WIOD.
Is somebody mess with his mic again?
Yep, sure enough.
Boy, they just keep messing with these things and they mess with the settings.
Could you hear how tinny that was?
Let's turn it around all the way to the front.
How do you like that?
Is that good?
Yeah, I like that.
Anyway, it's just a case of everybody's got nobody can leave their hands to themselves.
Okay, you know what they say?
Idol hands make, what, what, how's that saying go?
Devils, the devils work.
The devils play ground.
Something.
Idol hands.
With the blue dress on.
Your grandmother used to say,
Idol hands.
No, my grandmother didn't use to say that.
She used to say,
Hawkman is can't try to do that.
Anyway, it's 10 at WIOD.
The first call must be a crank because it says,
Hello?
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Isn't that cute?
Isn't that wonderful?
Maybe you could talk to the French wine man that was on with the henna lady the other day.
We couldn't understand what he was saying.
Well, I was very cute.
I have a few things I have to say to you.
Yes.
First of all, Robert Clary over there?
Huh?
Robert Clary.
He's a big baby talk.
I'm very sorry that the cops lost.
That's okay. We're used to it.
Yeah, I know.
And a few weeks ago before they did,
I called you up and asked you if you would play that song.
Did they vote?
Did they play in Chicago all the time?
Did that help?
Did you have a cup of sand?
Uh-huh.
And maybe if you have it, you play it for the rest of the day.
Now, we just got you playing it as a matter of fact before you called.
Well, maybe on another day then.
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe.
Also, I wanted to tell you that I'm going to be there for quite some time, aren't you, Brad?
Hmm.
And I've tried to remember ever to call some other people I've done and say,
hey, can I hang on the phone for four hours and run up to Bill for that?
No, chance.
But I would like to know who it was possible.
It's maybe once a month, twice a month, I could call and be your unofficial foreign correspondent.
Sure, no problem.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Hi, Brad. How you doing?
Now, every time you call, are you going to ask for that song?
No, I know. I know. I know. I know. You feel bad.
I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

my mommy lives in halendale she lives in hollywood she wouldn't be cut dead in
halendale except when she's visiting my aunt who lives in halendale

just that morning yeah yeah or anyway we got like 15 people listen to the show
what when I was sitting on hold we don't want people listening to the show in
north and south Carolina we don't want those redneck snooping in on the show
oh no this was this was all the way over Georgia so in Georgia that's a lot
better no it's a different brand of it that's safe yeah actually around here I'm shocked
it's not the the yaw who redneck types you imagine in fact I see more Florida
tags right out here than I do well that says all I need to know yeah well
but it's not too bad anyway I'm curious about one thing is dork farful
still there I might I don't discuss him and I made up my mind I listen last night
I figured maybe I've been on fear and I was in the car and I turned it on I
gave him close to an hour and I'm going to tell you something I'm not going to
waste my time discussing him anymore he's the lowest form of slime ball he didn't
even be able to be allowed in the building so I'm not going to get into it well
I I so much I agree with you totally and his show is unlistenable but anyway
okay well I just really wanted to check and see how things were going I'll make
a short and sweet please and I'll be listening to you next week when I get back
okay have a great trip okay thanks bye and don't ever call a show again it's
1018 at WID remember yesterday it was the tradelines that were all straight look
and broard now nothing I mean we haven't really asked for calls yet but it is it
is fascinating to see how this town works so well together anyway speaking of
being in a car I'm listening last night and I punched up oh now the first let
me give you a little history since wftl went talk okay I punched it up one
what now was it oh I know it was a couple of weeks ago and Mike Roberts
his father program director his father had passed away and he was out for several
days and norm Kent was supposed to be filling in and Craig Worthing was still
on by the way got a nice letter from Craig did I thank him for that Craig is a
great guy unfortunately he's at fdl big meetings so Ernie Sochin wasn't there
and she's and I'm listening and she's just dying she's talking about everything
she's reading out of the paper and I can't blame her because she does not
talk shows and she kept saying well I thought she was saying was well I be
babbling I be babbling and I thought what kind of a thing is that to say I be
babbling is that some kind of an ethnic thing or what what is she talking
about I be babbling and then what Ernie finally came in and he sat down and
they turned on the second mic and it was all broken up in the story of it
no seriously it sounded like something that they found in a backyard at radio
check that they thrown out that couldn't be repaired it was embarrassing and he
called her IV and I realized that was her name was IV and she kept saying IV
babbling IV babbling and if you want to call it in babble with me and kill
some time and I kept thinking she was saying I be babbling and I thought she's
that's the packiest thing I've ever heard in my life but anyway she was on I
couldn't shut it off because I kept waiting to see if he would ever show up I
be babbling was here yesterday what look at her job what is that man I
missed her it says that is her aka no not IV she caught IV I be what do I mean
that's her aka I be no he called her IV what do you mean I be babbling well
that's a name pretty good talk to you then fondled her it says I oh now that's
not the girl I was sitting over here and the thing in here no is that was that
event it was sitting in here oh he doesn't know well that's because that's his
replacement anyway just a joke Nick sure I be babbling is a name what kind of a
name is that I be babbling aliace aliace I be babbling it's an aliace
pretty good you be babbling I like that name that is something else we got to get to the
bottom of that all right 21 past and of course with the vast audience that they have
a W.A.L. tremendous there can be no question and then Ernie was going on about
to the P person I guess that's Paul Lyle are they they hate each other and he
wouldn't shake his hand they have this meeting and I think that's really unfortunate
when you're working in a station when you can't when all the people on your can't
get along like one big happy family like we do here at W.I.O.D. just wait to hear
how many promos you hear for the eight to eleven show on the show by the way oh
not I'm just I'm just leaving it out like it doesn't exist because as they told
me in that meeting the less said the better and after having listened for a
few days and gotten kind of the feel of the ambiance for the whole I think
that's probably correct okay 22 after 10 at W.I.O.D. we're going to do a little
break here we'll be right back
is it bring any bells with you well it says real men listen to the red hot
chili peppers so yes that's how before you're coming to prom
I never heard this before in my life no higher ground great are they playing
this a GTR well they better start why do you think it's be you
okay there it is it's red hot ground chili peppers from their
from their LP mother's milk 26 after 10 at W.I.O.D. now who did you fondle
yesterday you fondled the anemori atomic check can I say that on the air no
but her I was cool her arm you know oh you fondle her arm a little feel
as what you're trying to say yeah it was cool well there's nothing wrong with
that oh good all depending on who it is I guess okay Steve has open phones
today sunny and joe from Tony Romans and soft Miami on sports talk at 605
tonight and after that we have no information
you're right it's just blank oh and then I take it back it's three times I
guess I'm fascinated I won't last it's all the fascination is over but I did
punch up FDR yesterday afternoon what was Steve doing it was something
terminal and I punched up Mike Roberts was on and he had a 400 year old woman
call in and then about 10 minutes later he played me true to your sure which
I just I just almost fell on the floor in the car but anyway this woman was
saying oh my clatter he's so true what he doing is so bad if he was in
400 years old man she wasn't a day I'm serious and that's the F.D.L. crowdboy
they are really doing it they are doing it and the thing I like is they really
have a professional sound too they are the best so anyway 28 past 10 at W.I.O.D. there's
one line in the middle there in Broward that's not lit yet when we get it lit up
then I'll then I'll feel that we're ready to start taking some calls hot and
heavy seriously okay we'll wait oh I know what else I was going to do I we're
waiting for that other Broward line to light up and we will wait to believe me if
I have to sit here and leave two hours of dead air I'll wait that's how I feel
I'm not putting up with your crap I mean this could be the Mike Robert show just
so anyway I'm coming to work today and you'll never guess what I saw on 79th
Street just a few blocks just we could walk to there and not work up a sweat one
of my favorite places in history and I'm trying to think if it conflicts in
any way with anybody we have on the air and it doesn't Taco Bell Taco Bell
doesn't remark in no emotion whatsoever he doesn't care about it but that's
just one of my fey I love Taco Bell I just love Taco Bell and there's one right
up the street now it's two blocks up there just brand new it is open and I
was thinking maybe somebody would bring us food from Taco Bell today I like
burrito supreme with no beans today I love well I know we've got that us
tray and stuff coming but this first you know I'm sure Taco Bell opens 10 30
or 11 that other stuff's coming much later it is yes okay hey I don't know if
I'm gonna like that other stuff I'll sample it and I don't want to get mullin
crazy again but he really frosted my ass yesterday with that told deal he set
up that he just does it over and over and over again there just no talking to
this man he just keeps doing these little deals and he's kind of like the
Oli North of W I O D he's got his own little government within a government
although like Oli North he's probably getting his directions from yeah you know
what I'm saying so we'll have to check that out but anyway there's that Taco Bell
and I see even Rich's like yeah you probably do that yeah I'm Tony it's right
right up the street it's just on the other side of the causeway yeah Richelmecker
was closer even than Flora's much closer it so you could practically throw
a rock from here to there so I like a burrito supreme with no beans and a
couple of tacos and then they have I can't think of it no listen to me this is
important this is not something to laugh about they have a little thing and I
can't think of what they call it is it a pizza melt a pizza what the hell do they
call those little things it's like a fold over thing and it's got cheese and
sauce in it and those are delicious they're small what the hell do they call
those no not a case idea what the hell do they call those no it's got it it's
like up their own name for it and I can't think of what the hell they call them
it's driving me nuts because I'm a regular I mean I don't go to fast food places
very often anymore but what I do if there's a Taco Bell around I can't read I
can't drive by that's how addicted I am to Taco Bell I love it and I just can't
think of the name of that and it's really does Laura know you go to Taco Bell
what what's the name of those little pizza things they're little folded over
things and they've got like sauce and the cheese inside what do they call them
mexie melt see there we get somebody who knows something about food in here
for once and we get a good answer thank you allora thank God for her mexie melt
you never had one of those oh those are good too so I'm just giving you a
sampling of what I'd like four or five of each but the burrito supreme no beans I
don't like beans on anything okay because beans create serious
especially when you're doing a radio show with yeah all the guests that we have
okay it's 1031 at W.I.O.D. we have a oh not do I dare put this on the air are
you gonna talk about the unmentionedable can I well I guess but I'm not I don't
want to get into it a whole thing again today real brief um last night at 10
30 call was calling calling um telling him how he thought that you were
better than dick and um he finally asked him do you listen to me oh he said I
serve him a nearly yeah we don't want him turn it off now dick we don't want
you hey I got a question we're doing just great without him if if everyone
listens to your shows and nearly is there a listening show that dickie yeah dick is
the operative word sir in and out or less huh trust me
right here bye goodbye dummy it's 1032 did the book come in does anybody know
or wait did the mail come in does anybody know anything in this building oh
yeah that must be what's in this big envelope over here that must be the
arbitrage book wow let's open it up before Disney gets back and has a hemorrhage
hmm is it in what somebody find out for us if it came in because I want it now I
mean it's got to be here today it's Thursday the numbers came out when Friday
mm-hmm today's Thursday it's almost a week later it never takes a week for the
book to come in does it I don't know now you don't know how many times have
we been through this before I forget oh brother yeah rich is going out to
check the check the lay of the land fat rich just pulled himself up out of that
chair which was quite an accomplishment by the way it's 1033 at the WIOD
it was did you see what a I feel bad but I have to get out of the chair but boy
with him it's almost like you need to crane and he's lost a lot of weight he's
kept it off
well we got the book even though boy Gary thinks it's not in it Gary just look
out the window okay it's a beautiful view from your window the little tiny
boats water the blue skies the little birdies out there are chirping isn't it
cute anyway when you hear the hour by hour is you're just gonna I think you're
gonna have a radio accident I may have to be excuse yes okay at 5 a.m. WIOD
Mike Rinerie has a 9.6 chair in the five to six hour in the six o'clock hour
is seven one in the seven o'clock hour a six in the eight o'clock hour four seven
then that nine to ten hour the big nine to three seven o'clock we have a seven
nine
at eleven o'clock a seven nine this is twelve plus then a seven two a seven three
and a two o'clock a four six then a four one a four one a four two sports talk
a four oh and a four oh what was on at night baseball mostly four two three eight
three eight five seven and eleven of course we all know who that is I'm not getting
in the car outside I wouldn't dignify him and at midnight a six seven so right
across the board there we've got only the only marginal hours nine to ten p.m. which
is probably when John Sterling was doing the games and ten to eleven and of course the
big nine to ten hour in the morning I think Henry's cooking report is what
probably put that one under the bottom I was gonna say over the top that Mike does great
all the other places there but the nine to ten hour is like his Achilles heel in this
particular book so it's not like he lost a bunch of audience here it's just that that
one hour really just does that or could it be Roger's entertainment report I would
want to hurt Roger's feeling because we love Roger's a great guy but you never know
you never know all right let's oh this is going to be exciting and all you people who
run whole look at that couple of them hung up already because they know me they know
we're going to get into a big is this mobile collar still on yes of course well I'm
sorry to keep you waiting if I would have seen that I would have gotten to you three minutes
earlier well that's okay because I won four dollars and fifty cents on the fantasy five
the other days so I can't for an okay well listen it's almost the run out now but do
give your best shot I just want to congratulate you on your numbers I knew you were going
to get your book while I was on hold isn't this exciting that something see I mean when
the when the advances come out that's nice but when the whole book comes out you can kill
hours with this if you really play your cards right I'll be right with you I drive a
cat I'm unloading groceries here some old bags yeah figures I just wanted to congratulate
you again and wish good luck to the dolphins this week against Cincinnati yeah we can use
it I think they got a good shot this weekend though I think Cincinnati is a little marginal
to be honest with him I agree and I think boomers a little bummer this week yeah he's
overrated he bugs the hell out of me yeah it's really the only way they win is that hurry
up off end hmm that's the only way they can win but anyway have a good day thank you take
it bye what a nice guy huh 20 to 11 at W.I.D. let's look at Calder there in the morning
at 5 a.m. of 0.9 and a 0.6 then a 1 at 7 a 0.8 and a 0.6 which may not sound like much
but after he goes off Q.A. and has a 0.3 and so he's got the highest numbers in the daytime
hours and then at 6 p.m. who's on at 6 1 a.m. 7 I think now what isn't it so now they got
a 0.8 at 5 a 1 3 at 6 and then Kaplan's got a 2 a 3 a 3 2 a 2 and a 1 and a 1 1 not anywhere
near our sports talk of course except the nights when Hank is on when it's because there's
an asterisk is that when Hank is on nobody now just a joke Hank you are my best friend
even though you're a troublemaker and a compulsive but pain in the ass what else I don't
know what to look for at this point I'm so excited you know should we look at many
18 to 34 because that would be embarrassing wouldn't it huh come here some people yeah
comparing contrast speaking of embarrassing ladies and gentlemen here he is we have the
book stand by the way I forgot to bring you that I forgot to bring you that thing I've
got I know where it is in the house I thought it was here but it's in my house so you get
that tape plus don't ever going to be able to put that together anyway you're dreaming
what's our little scratch on your core bet yeah very funny let me see now here's many
18 to 34 10 a m to 3 p m w gt r with a 9 5 and we have an 11 6 well we already knew that
but it just looks so much better on a separate page doesn't it oh geez it looks just incredible
well we can do get into the demographics can't we now wonder how Steve did with those
the younger demographics again I don't know come on be nice give him a chance man 18 to 34
at two o'clock we have 14,400 and Steve loses an even a half that's a nice even number
7,300 women 18 to 34 we have 2200 Steve has 400 that means he loses 18 what is 18 out of 22
that's 9 11 that's a lot yeah it loses almost everybody there so Steve at two o'clock I don't
know what happens there but look at this women 18 to 49 we have 4900 he's got 1400 men 25 to 54 we
have 25,700 he has 14,000 later but I but I will say this the 14,800 is the next biggest
hour to anybody outside the show although by the 5 o'clock I reached out to 9,700 well we don't
want to take on Steve because like I said they consider the alternative you know who it would be
there's no doubt in my mind trust me when I tell you if somebody go into a Taco Bell with Burke
no I did not I'd work with Alan Burke I did dummy I did and I know you worked with Alan
Burke and he wouldn't even give your name on the air because my ratings were higher well I don't
discuss ratings in the industry I discussed issues geriatric issues dummy anyway why are you
so Mike is still in the building I'd work on that Henry's cooking report I think is what did it
to you guys because every other hour is fine but that 9 to 10 hour is like a bomb it's just
what Roger of course is standing there too so I don't want to say anything while he's there
but Henry's cooking report I think is what does it I think too much whining and dining mostly the
whining is in that 9 o'clock hour that could that could have some effect but anyway it's
amazing to see how Steve loses half the audience here at 2 o'clock anyway it's 1043 what
why were you in your car so long last time I was out and about well actually I had to go pick
up Dave because he locked the keys in the car oh and I was driving around because I couldn't find
he was at some insurance place on sunrise and I couldn't find it so I spent a lot of time that I
didn't plan on spending in a car and bicky Farrell kept you company in the car mentioned that name
you dummy so what do we want to see in the book is there anything how about Zeta boy this
ought to be exciting Pete Bouldard called me the other day do you think it's only an accident
that they finally had some good numbers no because no no and he after a year he called me at home
you you think if they'd had a bad book he would have called me well that's a first
well let's see these are 12 plus Zeta 21 at 6 o'clock 2523272526252724282426 it sounds like basically
the same bunch of people listening all day I could be wrong but it's still on son at exciting to me
although if we roll over and look at WGTR well they are consistent yeah I've noticed that
oh boy GTR look at this at 6 in the morning herman and McBean have a one nine
oh no no did you hear what I said what demo is that 12 plus well I realize that that's not the
bad but I don't sell 12 but no that's not the point the point is that that's a very minute
number for anything oh here's a facts for Stan from rich pardon me for being a chronic junior
Paul Harvey last night my peace and quiet was shattered when the phone rang a voice on the other
end started singing the classic smoky robins in composition my girl it wasn't the temptations
even David roughen and lyrics were the j michael's rewrite Stan major when I got over the shock I
realized it was my brother Steve who was warbling away when he finished he told me the big news
about Stan's return to the airwaves I was astonished since you recently had predicted the
impossibility of this but happy anyway since Stan hasn't had a show literally and figuratively
for a long time we came up with some possible themes for his first few shows oh great favorite
South Florida restaurants favorite episodes of vimey vites Don Johnson's here Don Johnson's kids name
good baby name if Stan Laurie have another one I'm gonna put my own in there a psychiatrist if
junior day with Paul Harvey junior EJ and DJ guest-farring Ed a Dixon for possible sidekicks
hot local female news reporters the negligee and swimsuit show and the best malls in South Florida
to cruise for twinkies that's where you put that in your memoir so along with those
letters that you were sending to okay it's eleven forty six and w i these Stan will be on on
Saturdays now no more tape no more best of niels so those of you who want to hear this show you
better get your act together get your priorities straightened out no more cheap freebies with those
I want to miss the dead air on crappy tapes those you'll put together crappy tapes on
theater day okay no more that crap I almost called it what it really was what Henry said in here
the other that's Henry maybe it's wise on vacation now so what is it that we want to see average
quarter hours we have at ten o'clock fifty eight thousand eight hundred fifty nine thousand four
hundred next to our so let's say the good stuff for the eleven o'clock hour because just by a
hair that's the biggest hour hmm okay I don't know what else I want to see in here I'm a little
bit disappointed with that one's right wins an afternoon drive well here's an asterisk
one point six at two a one eight followed by a one seven and a two four and then at the big
six o'clock hour one nine oh they're consistent yeah they're right in there boy and that's
twelve plus now if you get to the like twenty five to fifty four my favorite for the oh damn see
I was twenty five I wish all these others were in shares hour by hour that would make it a lot
easier they give you the total numbers but they don't give you the share hour by hour but it's
still would be fascinating you see here like men twenty five to fifty four w i n z afternoon drive
oh they have a share yeah but not the hour by hour one five
I want average quarter hour twenty four hundred men three to seven I wasn't in all news stations
supposed to be predominantly men yep and midday of course they got a big number in there point seven
fourteen hundred twenty five to fifty four men in midday on w i n z I think this calls for a special
card it's incredible don't you a little salute I used to be number one in that demographic
yes you did stand but they can you're at because they don't want all your problems
kicking at with fifty thousand watts of power all over south florida from the keys to the
palm beaches even out to the Bahamas this is w i n z thank you do grave lie now that you get
your highest numbers ever in this this book no we did not we had a seven three in the spring book
here with then we got that awful hit and tune and don't forget there was a lot of vacation stuff
going on here too you're never going to get the highest number and then we had the Alex benefactor
took a leak to point so I predicted a fall book based on this tremendous response that we're
we could go right over the hump so to speak but no but i think i think i think that's one truth
about eighteen to thirty two that's the biggest we've had i think that's the biggest we ever had on
a m with that eleven six eighteen to thirty four now on data last summer we had a fifteen in
many eighteen to thirty four and then in our last book over there remember we beat her
many McQueen in the morning eighteen to thirty four and they were really upset about it and
now they're even more upset because now we're here on a m in midday and even though we're not on
the same time as they are we're beating who's on a midday so that'll teach him to mess around with
Steve stands for that's what they get that they deserve fat walling oh the fat wallie factor yeah
wait to meet him oh boy i think he and moonman came up out from under the same rock
it's ten till noon at ten till one ten till two well it might as well get out of here i guess uh
see how we move this thing along major this show i want to tell you about a lot of pepper netta
that's why it a little punk i even stand in lory have had some freemials at lot tavernetta
and they enjoyed it more than they can begin to tell you one of the very finest Italian restaurants
anywhere even in italy i used to do that well better than some of them in italy i'll tell you that
and they've got excellent food in italy but a lot tavernetta just makes it phenomenal in fact the
cold is also just love lots tavernetta and you know how picky they are they're so hard to please
it's almost it's not even worth the effort but they're just in love with lot tavernetta and you will
be too everything is put fresh on the premises the soups are so thick you can eat them with your
hands not just with the sport and the best minister and pasta fajola you've ever had great pasta
dishes that angel hair pot desensational and baby cow their meal is the best in the world and the
seafood and poultry it justice as good as it gets and then the dessert tray by the time they bring
you dessert you don't think you're going to be able to eat it because they give you so much food
but give it your best shot because their desserts are also phenomenal lot tavernetta here's the
number for reservation 722 1831 and i urge you to make reservations because it's a small
in-it restaurant they don't have a billion tables so you don't want to be disappointed
lot tavernetta there is only one there at 845 west mcnav road just north of commercial boulevard
just a couple blocks east of Pine Island you tell Carolyn and all our good friend chef Romano the
neo-rodger sent you by for the best in Italian food lot tavernetta
the birds of liar the birds of liar fat rich said that the birds of liar 1050 for i just thought
we'd play that the rekindle old memories because we haven't heard that in a long time here's a call
oh did that disappear the call for stan you already live you're formally called
oh
that guy ever called wind back about that hot 105 thing
remember he was going to call every like every week and it was going to be an ongoing
soap opera thing what guy hot 105 was it or were 1194
running 84 yeah did he ever call that about one oh they were trying to with with all the
accusations and every station yeah don't you remember that and he didn't I don't know how he
forgot about it he was just a static call don't you remember about what I don't remember either
the guy that's called vaguely familiar to me guy called what did he want uh somebody from hot
from love love called or somebody like one of five uh-huh from hot 94 and uh they wanted they
were going to tell the whole truth about the glim and oh no and as far as I know that story has
never been told a liar that story has never been told someday we'll tell that story oh what
happened I don't want to get into that now let's look at wfto and see the gigantic pickup that
they may not heard the micro Roberts yesterday by yesterday by alibining about the fact that um
at age right they didn't start till July with the new format but you think there would be
something here look at this you said it's going to take them at least a year to turn it around
now if they continue with these numbers for least a year they're going to be a parking lot
listen to the numbers hour by hour wfto five a.m. zero they don't tune then a point three point three
point four point five point four point three point three point four point three point four point three
then starting at five p.m. point one point one point one point one zero point one zero point one point one
well trust now when you get into some of the younger demographics of course it's almost all zeroes
sounds like Zeta's numbers before you move over there remember
what a disgusting thing to say can you imagine their numbers over what's uh what's
a ambitious getting on snooze oh yeah let's look at wold i forgot all about them it's so easy to do
that because they got that good zone or new let's see it at big five o'clock hour five
dwell at four o'clock they have a three five at five when the news comes on down to a three three
and by six they're down to a two two who but then in the elela let's see uh nine p.m.
witchner has a three four then a six three a nine two and a ten seven hmm so most of his
audience most of his old drunks are still after the clock at night so i'm serious that's basically
what it all is scratchy voiced old broads and hello dude yeah i'm ahead of you yeah the half hour
in news oh yeah well that big eleven o'clock are they got a nine two in there thanks to anon
Dwight yeah well let's see what it's allis doing the morning here at the six four one three one two five
two seven but Debbie was the shocker with a four two three nine three seven oh no the three seven
is uh sandy three nine four oh three five but those are but as you look at the demos like in any
of the younger demographics it's almost nonexistent so sixty five plus almost all of it
but that's a rough break now let's see did we go over Steve here did we rough him up a little bit
actually he's um i think he improved a little bit then he's got all in the four he doesn't have any
four six four one four one and four two what does that come out i know this doesn't interest
anybody in the audience but let's figure it out for the four hour day i want to know
numbers with decimal point three four ten nine thirteen seventeen divided by four is four three
four three four three is what it averages out for the four hours is nothing wrong with that now
should we average our four hours yeah since we want to beat ourselves on the chest and tell
everybody how great we are and how do we get two five fourteen twenty three nine sixteen twenty
three thirty divided by four is seven point uh six seven six and something it's good
considering the Alex Bennett fact and the swimsuit yeah oh i forgot about that was that in
there too sure oh that's good for at least another point uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh we might
have had a ten if it wasn't for that swim suit all right that's it for this hour who's doing the
news today gale chuckle chuckle chuckle chuck myer is gracing us with his presence today i'll be
damned i heard chuck had a rough morning he fell down the stairs he stuck his thing in a cup of
coffee and he just oh he had a brutal morning all morning this morning but he's making a quick
recovery because he heard that free food is on the way so chuck fire's got the eleven o'clock
news and we'll come back at eleven oh five Steve has opened phones this afternoon from two to six
hurricane hotline with sunny and joe from Tony romans at six oh five and that's as far as
our you know that's as far as our promo sheet goes so we have no further information
they did twelve bulletins at once i'm chuck myer new thoc radio six ten w i o d

listens to wins oh i know what i'd like to see oh before i do that can we announce on the air
can we again brag like crazy because nobody else will tell anybody every male demographic 18 to 34
18 to 49 well we already knew 18 to 34 okay we had an eleven six for number one we're number one
in midday in every male demographic 18 to 49 we have an eleven to three the next closest is
magic with a seven two that means it almost every male who's listening to radio of it was under
a hundred in this market listening to this show right now in uh 25 to 49 we have a twelve five
matrix got an eight yeah that's phenomenal 25 to 54 we already knew this one we have a 12 one the
next process is magic has a seven two how about hot hot has a two one all right six eight six eight
yeah okay um 35 to 64 is the next one we have a 10 eight the next one is uh life with a nine six
we beat life and the possible so we want to really brag about this stuff i wanted to see on the weekend
weren't you be fascinated to see how those tapes did that are getting we're getting rid of fine
I could i don't think it did anything we had the bunch of teenulous thing during the summer time
two now luckily they're back in school um where is it what am i looking for that it's
that we can we can we're going to dark with those Monday through Sunday day part
okay here's morning of Saturday we don't want to look at that because it's spelled MOUR in
all right now i don't think those tapes did much okay 10 to three Saturday WIOD we had a um two nine
uh week well yeah but you got to compare it to the rest of the weekend uh oh day parts oh
but in men we had a five one well let's look up mag green show no she does pretty well what time is
she on is she still uh Sunday morning let's hear on the schedule uh midday it would be six to 10 AM
Sunday morning WIOD has a um five three um that's Sunday morning well that's not her though she
knows the garden show the garden show is big that's because he's got a three three see she even
even she beats a tape i'm trying to tell him that since i came here that those tape shows
suck they just don't get any numbers anywhere now what if i don't beat the tape well
well you'll probably never be back
well yeah no you're gonna do uh five or six
believe me especially isn't this great now you can be back and you can worry about every trend
we'll find out the weekend day parts and we'll um hold them over your head and have people come
to your house at three in the morning and say sticky numbers fan right um now it's so great that
stands kind of like back in the uh framework of things kind of like on the periphery of it but
that's a good way to crawl back in you know well you'll have me to knock every Monday you're gonna
have a show every now we're not gonna let you know we're not gonna let you know we're not gonna
you're gonna let me know first of all we're not gonna see if you are paying attention we don't
go to the track you don't anymore we go to uh this game starting with me oh that's right yeah
oh well that's still the crack well i wasn't talking specifically about call about what called it
oh he said it oh he'll call to you yeah i noticed when called her did the bob harness thing
this morning he didn't even give the name of the track he just called it the racing report and the
name of the track never even entered into the discussion uh oh and we were also having a little
clandestine discussion bill and i yesterday and you know hi lia is gonna be opening in november
and running opposite called her and we figured since we always like the underdog we might do a
little to you know promote hi lia since bob savage has always been so nice to me over there
wouldn't that be fun yeah hey listen racing is racing so what if they are three thousand dollar
claimers they still pay off at the windows some of the best times i ever had with Jackson raceway
and michigan with cheap claimers cashed a lot of tickets why should do your show off there
at Jackson harness racers all right it's ten past eleven at w i d we're trying our best to promote
the stand major return saturday's tended to what times of august this week i don't you have a
full you have four hours you have a full four hours right out of the box that's what it looks like
yeah the game this week is a four o'clock oh boy and you know dorthy is going to New York dorthy
mackey argin or dorthy she's going in there thanks a lot dorthy yeah she just kissed us goodbye like
like this uh yeah you'll regret it boy you'll miss when you're up to your ass in snow dorthy
you'll miss these and you'll when cod comes by and Jared and all your young twinkies in there
you're going to miss it um what is this um mobile call for you hello yeah is super sampler yeah
yeah you got them yeah uh you are the one who really said what a pushley town this was that you
would never work on saturday's i guess they changed huh how about that how about that it's good to
get back on the radio though are you going to play any chance how to keep your keys on
yeah as fact he's going to be on next week really what's that green now as a matter of fact keep
where the keys couldn't be here but his brother joe goldstein's going to be on joe joe joe joe
joe goldstein joe pinto joe pinto is also going to be he's not right now we're watching him
and the camera man they only hope they have for the show i noticed the new deal of camera man never
show you that quick we always need to get there joe for like a half a second we'll go back to the
game okay no changes okay that's all your audience can say is it that's it they missed all that yeah well
they can say only yeah look at the way the phone is going now boy since he's coming in it's like
an atomic bomb okay let's take a little break here Marvin we'll be right back
starts what an exciting
yeah that would concordinate it
yeah
boom
a dickhead
lock it in
oh boy sounded like the call of the wild okay stand is cutting some promos or something now so
you can feel free to call back in yeah no seriously the phones did that happens every time he comes
in lately doesn't it all he's got is DJ and EJ and those chronic but he does great he's
gonna have a big number in there we still can't figure out why but he'll do well on Saturday
kiss the ground that we don't have any more of those poorly put together crappy tapes
okay boy what a what a breath of fresh here this is gonna be a real live person back on the weekend
on wio d and of course if they were smart once the dolphins and they put them on Sunday too
mm-hmm right sure what is it it's two and three they're five games they're almost they're getting
close to the halfway mark already right another three weeks and they'll be halfway through the
season mm-hmm not of course to mention postseason play well anyway well listen we can hope i mean
you're only a game behind out of first place the jet suck and at whole division is pathetic so we
still got a shot okay we have an open line in date and one on the Palm Beach line which
surprised me because stand was a giant in Palm Beach he had just a tremendous following
in Palm Beach County bokeh hello i'm glad i'm glad i wanted to start out slow i knew there

I have no idea where it was.
New Orleans.
New Orleans?
With a K?
Is it?
New Orleans?
Got a rock and roll?
No, it was kind of a talk thing. It's funny because I used to live in New Orleans and
it didn't sound familiar.
Mm-hmm.
Ever heard of W.W.L.?
Oh, of course.
You know Rick Zerick?
Nope.
He's a giant in the street.
Mm-hmm.
What is he a truck driver?
Believe it or not, he does news talk on W.W.L.
Yeah, well that's the truck driver's station.
Yeah.
I've been sold at Catholic Church. He's built a call to use to work there.
Oh, we did?
Mm-hmm.
I didn't know that.
Well, he worked everywhere.
Yeah, so, um, yeah, I did listen to Dick Fairwell the other night twice and that was
it, enough for me, that's all I'm going to say.
Okay.
And, um, it's all that needs to be said, actually.
Yeah.
You know, Dave Dixon?
Yeah.
Speaking of name, dropping.
He's in Detroit.
Right, right?
He's at BMW ABX.
Yeah.
And then he was down here for a while.
Nobody has ever seen Neil and Dave Dixon at this.
You know, Harley and Francis?
You know, Dan Nebrath?
You know, um, uh-huh.
