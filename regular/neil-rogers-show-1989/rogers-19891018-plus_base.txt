And now get ready, hell and hell!
Cause live wealth is gonna make your class to be bad.
This Sunday, one afternoon only,
A lasting blue air over the rear door.
Live wealth.
Live wealth.
This is why it really takes us.
I ever fall in love, I keep...
All day afternoon in a basement work room on the facilities,
Meet a consummate even hell and hell.
Live wealth.
What special guest, let's make a long kiss.
Wake you up!
On the popular press,
Fit black magic.
You're too much.
For a place people in world.
Are you clearly clueless?
No, the whole night true.
I bet you think it's unfair now,
We're all calling for a win and dying cup of your real estate.
I don't use it to remember what you probably want.
We're so honest, we're basically close to normal.
A common door comes to push the patient.
A common door comes to presentation.
It's 11.47.
Now that's kinda...
If you missed the Neil Rogers show,
You know that Neil was sick,
But the bird took his place.
Oh, now come on, guys.
The bird had a lot of incident to talk about.
I had a friend of mine years ago,
Jerry Clifton, whose famous in radio,
had a house in Port Lauderdale.
I won't play the golf game.
I'll play you on Neil.
Yeah, we have a great meet-up.
Boy, you know, I can't.
I don't have a promo sheet.
I'm have to look around.
I have a promo sheet.
Should they be paid?
Repatriate.
I have to tell her that word.
Repatriations.
I'll say the same thing that Neil says to me.
I just answer the phone.
All right.
That's it.
We're done with this hour.
Okay, I'm using this to be okay.
All right.
Myer in the newsroom, Chuck.
We're gonna do the news.
All right.
And then we're gonna have lunch.
And I will play you on Neil for you.
Okay, Chuck?
Yeah, there he is.
I'll play you on Neil for you.
We'll see you then.
Don't miss a minute.
The Neil Rogers show.
I'm going to attend a new talk radio 610 WIOD.
That's unbelievable.
I didn't think you could fill this segment like you did.
You still got a little.
Oh, but we could make a lot of noise turn the rack.
It's not squeaking.
Now that we need it, there it goes.
Scared the crap out of me when I saw that.
Now, Roger told me.
I can't find a cart, my friend.
I don't know what happens.
It's in here somewhere, but we'll continue searching.
You see that?
Why?
He said he is so proud of that guy.
It's six seconds away at the duck.
He said if you need a duck.
Now we've already used the duck.
Oh, screw the duck.
He's real proud of that, Kurt.
I can't find it now.
There's wiggle wobble.
Yeah, wiggle wobble is in there.
Yeah, everything else.
And then of course there's.
Or that.
I don't like that.
It is a standing.
Well, we could play a few seconds of beyond.
Get some of those people unupset.
The ones that are all upset about the Donny Osman.
What?
You want to be on the air?
What do you want?
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't want to be on the air now.
Yes, you want to be on the air right now.
Well, I just want to tell you that I would call you back right after this first race only because I didn't get a chance to tell you.
I thought you this morning because we went to the funeral as you know.
So they'll there.
And I guess I'll talk to you after the race because they're nearing the gate.
Okay, okay.
Bye.
Well listen.
What was he talking about?
This is unbelievable segment, this past segment.
He went to the funeral.
I don't know.
Okay, we got Chuck Meyer standing by.
It seems like holding moments ago we were talking with Chuck.
He's got the one o'clock news now.
And then we'll come back at 105 with the big one to two hour and find out what the hell fill is talking about.
New shock radio 610 WIO D presents Neil Rogers.
To get in touch and talk call 751 WIO D and then 524 WIO D and Broward or 655 and 278 WIO D in the fall beaches.
Other areas make all collapse.
The opinions expressed by the host guests or callers are not necessarily those of the station.
Now here's Neil Rogers on new shock radio 610 WIO D.
106 is WIO D. It's the big.
It's the line to two hour.
I almost forgot about that.
Couple of lines in Broward now.
And this is the part of the show where we can't talk because we've had too many of the Italian Isis.
Now it's still going to call back now or we're going to have to mess up the whole thing here.
We want him to call in now because Marvin is queuing up that Donny Osman phone call.
Don't refer to it as an interview because it wasn't an interview.
We just a phone call.
Yeah.
Right.
Exactly.
You're just my buddy calling on a phone.
Your buddy?
My pal.
Yeah.
You're good friends.
That's for you.
That's my only comment for you.
I'm sorry it couldn't have been what's your name.
Debbie Phoenix, whatever her name is.
What?
Debbie Phoenix, whatever the how her name is.
She's a free no no no.
What's your name?
Phoebe.
Phoebe Kate.
What do you get to remember her name?
Debbie Phoenix.
Debbie Phoenix.
That's a buzzer.
She looks like River Phoenix.
In drag.
Anyway it's 107.
We'll take a call and the guy from Vegas is probably still on there.
I'm still here.
Why isn't it exciting kind of like a link with your past?
Ooh yeah.
Without having to set foot down here.
I mean it's like I got a story for you.
You know that's always good.
It's always happened.
We put some phone on hold or spending our money and then we go back just to say
I and he started how can I try and I got a couple stories.
You know how they have a lot of conventions here in Vegas.
There was a convention of radio program directors Neil.
I went there and I checked it out and they were all wearing suspenders.
That's the end of the writing.
Just before they get canned.
One of the things here that the producers of the Lawrence Wilkeshire
that used to produce it are suing Michael Jackson for trademark infringement.
You know how like before on the beginning of the Lawrence Wilkeshire they were always
blowing bubbles with that machine.
Yeah.
We'll turn down Michael Jackson to the blowing bubbles before his show too.
Hey hold on.
It's on the TV.
Sonia and Bert sitting in the tree.
KISS, that's on the NG.
Okay that's I think we're three.
Today on the two of Hill six long.
Oh okay.
I didn't even have to tune in.
I heard you had to show yesterday.
Same old douching and the same old talking.
Come on give us a break.

It's the world of the two hours.
Did you know that Johnny Carson is cab Halloween baby to take flim?
Where did you find that?
I was in the toilet.
Sure is people want to know.
Did you know there's a place just six feet under the earth where you go when you die?
Where's your pig model?
I picked it up in the toilet.
Here's what you'll find in the toilet.
This is where you come from.
This guy gave Bert to a 65 pound show horse.
John Hendy's come back in a spaceship with a super new diet.
Heard it dating John Hengley to make Warren jealous.
I'm sleeping with Joan Collins and I don't even know it.
Where is your red bed?

But the national toilet put a quarter in the floor and we'll wipe the world's floor.
Okay it's 106.
