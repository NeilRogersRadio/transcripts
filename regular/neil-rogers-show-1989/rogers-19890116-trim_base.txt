you know the understanding you in the phone keeps like making all these weird
noises are you
no this is not
made in the show
i'm sure i remember now from zeta you know
how are you calling the fish were jumping with glee
they were jumping with glee
yes now i have to keep you updated as you know the super bone is here
yeah and my michelle is planning some activities of our own
now you know some of these other activities have chosen to include some of
these these silly minority groups
well we have decided to concentrate just on the angle of facts and
protestant angle of the super bowl
now i tell you what we have planned but now first of all for the children now
for the right children that will become in
a lot of
we will be providing
cooperation with local church is a Christian petting zoo
that children will either have the chance of petting some of our local
christians
who have decided they will be patented
or they can pet cute little bunnies and white mice
now we're also offering male
ff 89 now this will take place the weekend before the big game
citizens will be invited to come into the community
and stuff their faces with as many wonder bread and mayonnaise sandwiches as they can
eat
now as it added bonus if they can speak German while eating these sandwiches
they will win the grand prize and of course there's always this event is hosted by
rick shawks
oh yeah that does it for me now the grand finale
this is really going to split this city on its side
we're going to melt down giant large statues of a children white christian
player from each of the competing kings
now once they are melted down we will have a communal
lot pool in the center of the mindy show country
we will invite all citizens to come in and swim
gleefully and express his christian emotions in a post and bishop will be hosting
this event as always
as always yeah and of course any Canadians that are welcome by we are as always
we are offering three hours for all of them
you know it breaks my heart so to go by these trailer parks where they live and see them watching
their clothing in the water fountain
and
anyway near I'd say just think life is grand and of course I am praying for you
I am praying
well keep it up as they say
okay
you can listen and I have for half hour 45 minutes
and there is absolutely nothing on the air except this guy is a jerk that lady is a
whatever and so it on and on and on and on
1240s fall apart but they all work just don't touch him that's all
I had a little chat with Mitch on the way up
yes and told him that you loved his work
I do love his work he's the best
I said what does that mean was that sarcastic no we had some problems in here last week
and he came in and he said don't mess with these other people they're wonderful
but they're all in work release just come to me and out of here the overhead
we got complete control over it and we can turn it off or we can crank it up
oh
nice to have a high chair that's sunny chair but sunny is in California for bad
to be in here that's Henry's chair Henry when he does a little wine tasting and
resets in that chair
no I want you to sit in that chair for just a second
so you can understand when you're sipping a little bit of wine Henry's very big in a way
I don't know I just keep sitting there for a second
and it goes down so you drop down and then that isn't that good
it's something erotic about that chair I don't know what it is
I think we know why sunny sits in here all the time so what are you doing Stan
just a drop by just was in the neighborhood probably was over the florist for a little lunch
I figured you would have the lunch here
oh do you want food?
sure
you think Carmine is listening to that
I'd go for a salad I know that well it's 1140 only you know what no it's not really
he's doing so great on his diet I am 29 pounds
well we are what you ought to do is really you ought to start ordering the really big stuff down
the really good stuff down
the big big z-d
it doesn't bother me
the only thing that bothers me are when they bring in like three of those giant cheesecakes
that bothers me
even the key lime pie the other day now you panic because you thought I was going to eat the whole thing
you started like it when you opened I heard that
yeah but luckily I had a new truss system spot coming up and that kind of tempered my thinking
I thought boy this is embarrassing
the one thing that I would go to Hollywood Saturday I didn't eat a thing
I drank the avion water and I was it
you probably couldn't have gotten near the food
no no people out there anyway Joe was there early really
I want to I want to find out what you eat at the track because you go to the track you talk about the horses
you talk about the race one and I talk about everything but craft of iced tea
and a bowl of onion soup and Linda gives me hell about the onion
it's got a lot of salt and I say Linda trust me how many onions does it have in it the whole thing
yeah I have to count the onion if I count my green all of it
so Carmine's listening stand would love that big z-d
I bet that for us has got great big z-d
oh that would be great I haven't eaten too well lately
and they're they're right up the street see so there's no problem they'll probably bring it by
or something like that even though it is a holiday they are open to they are
I assume so this is a weird holiday yeah I don't mean to be demeaning to Dr. King
but you know I wish we should you know I wish we'd get ourselves together in this country
I mean we're either going to do it or we're not going to do it
a lot of people don't want to open for us like that town of New Jersey
where they wanted to change the name of the street and one of the black politicians
so we don't want to do it because it'll give the area a bad image
we won't be able to sell any real estate because people will think it's in all black neighborhood
this was a black politician who said that
well listen I thought I was down on my luck until some friends in our neighborhood
two children young child and older boy went skiing up in New Jersey this weekend
both broke something two kids in one fall isn't that part of the whole thing
but isn't that part of the thing when you go skiing used to break a leg or something
two two children I mean one did it like on on Friday I think and another did it on Sunday
well you know what they say the family that skis together oh less is together
kids you'll get some of this in the years to come
you will so when you go on to work oh my god I just realized Christopher looks like
do I ask the wrong question what what hey oh really that's interesting oh yeah
yeah boy this could be really interesting Christopher looks like
I just realized there's nothing going on here that we know about that we want to talk about
no no you sure now now it is incredible because I have this story and this is
perfect story for you this is out of the new world weekly news stand you will enjoy
this so much a chubby weirdo who gets his kicks posing as a professional stripper
has condos way into six women's dorms say cops and talk the ogling coeds
and degreasing him with baby oil as he dances he tells the students that a friend
of theirs has paid into perform for them and they believe them says police detective
Richard Reynolds of Dayton Ohio cops haven't been able to catch the dirty dancing
phony he knocked on the front door of University of Dayton woman's residence in
November told the students a friend of theirs hired him from a local agency to
perform for the hey what a way to get the door yeah now since one of the students
was celebrating her twenty first birthday the next day they believed his story
and let him in now before he begins to strip T's the fake or ask the students
to lock the door and tells them not to take photos or make phone calls while he
performs he's usually able to talk to girls into rubbing him down with baby
oil as he wiggles nude on the floor
okay well it's for a new company yeah sounds good to me before you go could you do one
sure thing for me what that just say freeze major my antivirus you're under arrest
absolutely I'm not going to do that okay so who's he gonna marry this week
now he's going back to me well I've been at least eyes fixed right I think I
think I think I think don't you know I think don't you know Barbara Streisand
and I mean and what's your name Angie Dickinson go to the same time yeah somebody
brought by a whole bunch of those bumper stickers again to Toyota hollywood they
brought out that say a honky flurry King owes you money oh really I love
it okay we do have an open line and brown and I see the lines going on now that
stand is here a five two four W I O D no the food is that I know that no I know
the phones were really hot during the first hour I heard no they were okay yeah
well it's no no they were good it's just that in the very beginning what got me
a little nervous is because there was one line lit and usually when we sit down
they're like four or five lit already we don't have to even give the numbers out
there was only one but it is a major holiday is it no that's a good excuse
Margate hello yeah holy Christ I stayed on there a long time whatever you say
you're only sounds like it was worth it what I say it sounds like it's going to be a great call
yeah you're right at least you have good people walking through the door right you
but listen hey how to stand today was your out what you're out what you're out
that's how today was your legal house they know it is okay let me ask you another
question since push the fishing yesterday one of these bring any fishing to the white house
1146 at W I O D we have an open line and brown that's obviously a bush on
there at 524 W I O D let's go to Miami hello
they all got a question for Stan Stan where did that come from the thing with Don Johnson
uh that the new plays all the time that it came out of an interview when I had Michael
top it on the show Don called in I think I've always wondered that when you'll play it all
time I wonder how that came about and the very last thing I asked Don before he hung up
was if he would say freeze major Miami vice needs it and you know what he said I don't
need a damn history lesson the answer the answer is so funny the way he says it you know
it's just yeah that done in his wildest dreams he never he never dreamed and the real story is and we can laugh
on it now but it was serious business back then Stan got very because Stan played the
entire interview about 40 times on the year because it was long and it killed a lot of time
but he left out conveniently that closing portion of the interview so I somehow somebody
slipped me the hell on now you know I played it all the real story three day
I'll tell it from your van really please this man didn't speak to either one of us and finally one day
we had somebody go down a hall at about a quarter to two and drag him out of the office
and bring him in for peacemaking on the right and the only reason he came in is because we stop
playing it now he does he's to do the to this day he does not know the real story behind that well that's the way
I remember it just the way you told it no no absolutely not because we were recording the
Talbot show on the big reels and when john's johnson came on at the end of an hour at the end of a
real and and it started speeding up and it was going faster and faster and faster and faster
and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and

of seeing that alone i decided to wait for the one cable to see it
uh... uh...
uh... the one good thing about that is you'll be able to turn it off
yeah and foot foot something else now i will say this one guy in the theater
i would say in his fifties
he did after about a half hour he got up and walked out and i was wondering i
thought i wonder if he's going to the john
night blister and tell
and you know seriously no i'm not not getting him he just walked out he never came
back
and i don't blame them
this one of those movies will be on cable about two weeks
but i'm thinking about three months
they're going to be desperate to get to do
lead something out of this
well without even seeing and i'm waiting for them
trust me great
great area
by ticket
by
how's your
speaking cable how's your cable coming in
very good
a channel six was coming in like a real tv station

by not going through all of the uh... you know the red tape
in getting
the the zoning and and all that kind of thing setting it up because you can get
the big problem
wasn't anything negative who's just you know warning people
sounds real positive yeah
well i didn't make the mistake it's the day up right that they said don't believe
what the salesman oh yeah because a lot of it was life i companies will just
come and say oh don't worry about the permit will take care of that if you have
any problem will
will follow with you and they don't follow through they don't do a damn thing

the room that uh
radio talk very much in fact and console that he was using the little thing that
that the buttons with the phones uh-huh uh-huh it's just identical when
we use and the table was similar his was a little bit bigger than our is but
um bands kind of cool that was fairly realistic
that part of it yeah yeah but the way that the board op was spinning around in
circles and firing the cards
there was nicknick and spinning around you gotta have a wild
football helmet and different every five minutes and
throughout that the way the phone around your neck and throw a bunch of
spitballs for all of you know you don't get up and take a
stroll now and then no but Steve is doing that now i think that movie had an
effect that he's got this new microphone like the
like they used for football games with the you know
hands free kind of stuff i don't know what he's gonna be doing with his hands but
we'll find out i came out to see uh-huh Saturday and it
it was a revelation because it all came together because what you say it's only
a radio show that is correct that's what yeah i figured that out

to less now you didn't see that movie did you
no don't do it all right I won okay unless you're really bored with your life
don't waste the time no I won't okay have a good one bye
the amazing thing is there's so many good movies out right now yeah
yeah I did a lot you know I want to keep myself when I walked
out there I felt compelled to see it because like for example Tom jikka just
called me during the news yeah and they're writing a big thing about it in the
sun sentinel and I had calls from where was it from that paper in Dallas
mm-hmm well I got to see why they would do it because a movie was based in
Dallas but you know so you feel because it's about your
profession that you're compelled to go see it but I'm not exaggerating it was so
bad that you just boring and you're waiting for something different and it never
changes it never changes how was it technically was it okay technically no it
was horrible what do you mean technically as far as uh... you know they
always ridiculous the board out the the board office flat just before the break
he slam in the cards in mr hot shot and he's spinning around in the chair
like a board like that
haha
John McLaughlin was like that oh yeah

control he was wearing and carrying on and i like to scream at the track but not he was just
getting a little bit carried away a little bit and we had a pretty firm it's a pretty one out there

couple of problems he got picked out of the track one time and barred for life but now he's he's
all he stopped touting lester man he has given me horses he's a great guy don't want him to
misunderstand but he has given me a couple of stories i mean this one horse he gave me a corder
and he slept with a horse and uh and with the owner and he spent the whole night in his bar with
this guy and the guy is going to do the jockey if he owes him one and this horse can't lose and

my home and watch it i'm not going to go out there and fight on he's thinking the bangles the
bangles bang that is in a hot it's because of that Suzanne a hot she's so cute so it's got to be the
bangles don't you think you know who you were he's just starting to remind me of did you you saw
rain man no you haven't seen it he reminds me of Raymond no yeah you're starting to run the movie
no the bangles the bangles he started say everything two or three times i think he's picking
that up from her neary now that well now that's done i think now seriously i think that movie
had quite an effect on it well it's just like Steve walking around with that hand the um i don't
think they should be compared toyota of hollywood on four forty well you are nuts
got this brand you highway out there and nobody's on it you don't need to go on seventy five
go to the airport maybe to the naples here oh god me oh how long have you lived here you know
seriously seriously how long have you lived here that's obvious you take ninety five to the airport
that is correct oh man he says head examined don't you understand when you got on seventy five
you go right to the palm at wait a minute first of all it takes forever to get to the palm
meadow i mean it's a long long slip from steve road eighty four to the palm meadow is is forever
it's the same amount of time it would take you to go down the turnpike to ninety five and then to
the airport think about it you're on that turnpike a long time to come down here i'm not talking
about the turnpike i'm just talking about ninety five who the hell needs a turnpike but if you're
coming from plan there isn't any traffic on the weekend believe me it's like eight million
you're getting ready for even the morning when i come to work even when there's rush hour at nine
o'clock in the morning it's only ten minutes for my house to ninety five but why would you take
ninety five to go to Miami international from plantation it's forty minutes it's forty minutes
if you go on i seventy five and there's no traffic

to get calls from green land all the time how you did a show uh when you were on fact they sent
Arnie Ginsburg to Greenland right where you you did a show on wins were you were only taking calls
from Greenland one yeah uh huh that's why stand stop getting calls I kept telling them they can't
hear you in Greenland he's no well I saw I saw a news story over the weekend on CNN about ice land
they're having a big problem over there with paper versus plastic bags in the supermarkets they're
wanting to charge people a dime for the plastic bags and the consumers are all up in arms and yeah
they passed a law did you know about that don't put any ideas and I'll start in plantain
yeah well those ice land stories you know yeah yeah yeah where are you calling from sir
no actually west Palm Beach I'm calling oh same different clothes yeah yeah I'm just joking you know
just a joke listen uh I thank you I won't go see that movie you're talking to talk talk radio please
I won't go see it but I will tell you something you know that show that the dean was on wise guys
we got cracked over to school well you know I recorded that on my video and what I did was
all right well I've got two of them and I kept recording that part over and over again
where he's cracked over to school he's all fed you're assated it's a what I've got
leaves a dean alone he died 20 years ago nobody told him just leave him alone what I've got
he's a great friend of W I O D I've got a four hour tape at least he was till he moved to Philly
on long plate where he just he's just filled that over and over again and whatever I can
you ought to go see talk radio because I was saying before if you really have two hours to kill
you're terminally bored and you'd be a perfect candidate okay guys done the epitome of uh
yeah I heard my whole order here okay but another one of those great calls on at Palm Beach line
man it really but that's from Greenland greenland yeah Greenland that call yeah right next to
the family you're imagining spending that amount of time looking at Alan Burke's head
right that's scary don't we have well too bad we don't have something in his on tape you know a
little card something yeah he cut any promo's while he was here of his voice no no he wasn't here
long enough huh although he did I will say that he did mention the call iters a couple of times
which is moving up in the world okay I'm sure on CAU they probably say you know once a week
Alan give those call iters it's not bad CAU they don't care don't think no they don't have any
numbers anyway oh you know how he's following you're holding right yes and I said I'd come right
back and we're munching around here go another call I'm sorry all right we want to go back on hold
no no don't do that okay listen I saw the uh as I said door radio yeah and uh you know within
minutes I knew the guy guy was going to die I there's I felt no empathy for the guy you knew it
or you were hoping it I felt I mean I could really you hate the guy obviously you know the guy
was sick um didn't you get the feeling from the way some of the other people kept looking at him
that some of the people inside the building wanted to finish the job off didn't you oh yeah
yeah there's you know the scene with him in the basketball game here nobody likes the guy
who is listening to him yeah that's a good thing but he's stay on the radio as you listen to
that show that he was doing you realize nobody could be listening except all those misfits that
were calling in yeah that that was I found that fascinating that the only people that would
call in were the maniacs yeah that there weren't any any uh minorly decent people no the not a one
see that's where it lost all her credibility every single call was another sick character wacko
a drunk a hillbilly redneck douchebag not see uh whatever I mean or always it was like one person
calling with a slightly different voice I felt like I was underwater the whole movie I really
felt like I was drowning yeah I wish I would have been really and I wrote with my wife I was surprised
that she didn't walk out and after the first half hour yeah but uh listen some Ray Man trivia
umoria the uh in the scene in the restaurant where he's going through the phone book routine yeah
got taken that's his father-in-law what his father-in-law's name is got taken they said uh what
no what let's get up to g got to oh I see oh they always sneak those little cute things in
her like hitchcock used to do where he did those little cameos they always got to sneak a little
inside cramping right so all you trivia expert oh look at that the food is here sir and and
I want a side trap you but the food is here she always got arms full of food there will be no

fabulous movie just made one mistake when I went to see it I saw it in the theaters across from
century village and deer field oh come on you should know better well I should but it was
started it was the earliest latent or the latest early movie I could find but despite all of that
it was still very enjoyable even though they were complaining about not being able to see because
the people in front of them were too tall they should have a special theater for those people
you know I mean yeah I'm surprised they went at night you know it's full price yeah the only time
to go if you're going to a theater like that is to go in the very last movie yeah late at night well
that that was the mistake I made hopefully I'll learn from it how you doing Stan I'm doing great
good he's having a wonderful lunch here's a present having a really good what's what that
floor is on the beach you got no not on the beaches on 79 street on 79 just the east of this can
huh you don't know for us no I was I lived in North Miami beach and I'm living in boca
floris is an institution here so it's been here for like a hundred years
I have to make it a point to get down there please good okay gradie enjoyed to flick

if that's that this food is any indication he's going to be around another hundred oh yeah it's
tremendous all our stuff is great they're your tiny dishes and they're pizza and it's time to
talk about brick oven pizza okay which is not a competitor it's nowhere in the same area and
they don't even have the same style although they do have great baked ziti oh boy and brick oven oh
god I remember those wonderful days when ray used to bring us all that food now we're pretty far
see that's a one nice thing about floris it's right up the street and we're pretty far now one
very nice lady came by Toyota 1254 WI O'Neal we got a collar in Fort Pierce hello hey hi how
you guys doing great I was just calling no I've been hearing you know you guys are talking a lot
this morning about talk radio and all and I haven't seen movie myself and you know even though you
consistently you know telling people not to watch that I probably will end up going to see it
I don't know if you know because when somebody tells you to do something or do the opposite
oh yeah no I know a lot of people do go see it so they can discover that I was right exactly
and say that you know I know it was bad because I saw it not because you know I told me it was but
I was just curious you know since you said a lot of it was it's realistic as maybe
something would hope it to be I kind of you know I'm kind of skeptical myself if they can really
make it look as realistic as it really is you know as far as you know talk radio is and I think
they did a good job on a good morning Vietnam as far as you know how it is for you know radio broadcast
or rather the talk show but again a good morning Vietnam was a fun at least parts of it parts of
it were very depressing but parts of it were very funny I mean Robin Williams is a hysterical guy
oh yeah he was entertaining yes he's really moving is not entertaining in any way believe me
I was you know curious because the guy doesn't I'm telling himself it sounds like that was a good
no he doesn't tell himself oh he gets shot you get shot by somebody else by another caller
are you ever afraid of anything like that happy no fanatic you know no no happens it happens you
know you don't worry about those things well I'm glad you took time out today but all right okay thank
a lot by speaking of the good morning Vietnam you guys didn't know that that happened when I was
over there what and I had to take a TV crew out when this guy got trans quote transferred quote fired
off of all radio and I got I had I went out and interviewing it was he was something I mean he
wasn't Robin Williams you know but he was very outspoken on what he said on the air and it was a
real shame the way that it happened it was one of those things where you know some officer didn't
like him and getting transferred out and everybody else suffered you know you know almost like what
happens in this business normally what you trying to say damn I remind me okay let's go to
opalaka hello hello Neil yes sir yeah I got to agree with you on that talk radio movie you saw it
oh yeah and you survived it huh I got to say the movie itself was okay the realism wasn't there I
mean it was totally fake I disagree with you forgetting whether it was realistic or not it was just a
total I was a fool whatever it was it still wasn't good it wasn't entertaining there was nothing
I started to get interesting it was just the same thing I started to get dizzy to those camera
angles where you spinning around the room yeah oh yeah I would definitely take a couple of
exedrin and put them in your pocket when you go in there it was outrageous there was a waste of
five bucks yeah five bucks yeah where did you see it I I'm a where you paying three dollars for a
damn movie huh in pompano I had that obviously in pompano because the nice people who live there
that's what I paid to see rain man and I really on a weekend after no early like this was a
three-fifth thing three times it's a three bucks I'm used to going at night they really get you
during the week in the afternoon three bucks well listen I guess that's it huh I was wondering what
are your engineers screwing up with the phones and stuff what do you mean well I got cut off before
no we had a power glitch here fp and I'll burped yeah everything went on and it was real
exciting oh I listen have a good day I gotta say I love that protect condoms things you do oh yeah
that's coming up any second now that and the thing with the phone numbers before yeah the operator
that was actually I have a nice Daniel that's it here I'm fumbling around and trying to reach
for these guys come up with the most I know yeah backhanded ways of making requests that I've
ever heard in my life yes what what this isn't cute up it's not cute up either it's not cute
up or the pot is closed in there but you can't blame it on Mike Spendell now don't go pick it on
Mike okay now we're gonna run short a time to play this okay so save it is it possible that it's
not cute up because it would not you'd have I didn't do it because there's no reason to have stopped
it okay does that mean that we had gremlins in here again over the weekend is the card pot open
no three and all yeah yeah oh geez okay that was the problem the pot was
closed now it's got a few why was it why would that pot be closed all from the power thing I
know yeah right I wonder if the clock sure I guess you'll have to wait till after the news okay so hold
it so speak until after the news catch okay pal got an open line in date now 751 9463 751 WIOD

open line indeed that's pretty exciting 751 WIOD and the only other line on the board that's

in day could it be on beach well 655 WIOD if you move real fast in pumping for
Lauderdale hello hey Neil yeah how are you good good listen I thought at movie rain man I thought
it was terrific it is really enjoyed it was you were was you were someone the caller said something
about the ending they didn't like the ending or should have no I didn't say that and then the
several of the callers who who live in fantasy land they called in and they wanted I you know
some kind of emotional reunion or they wanted best and Hoffman to become normal I don't know
what they wanted they just they've seen too many Allison wonderland movies I guess well I thought
a little bit about that and talked to several people the movie could have ended where they got
together actually it probably should have but why why why the movie itself would have had the
effect that it did the way they ended it there's no way in the world those two couldn't get along
three million dollars you could hire the best help in the world yeah see what I mean I guess you
anyway did you go to race and Saturday very good timing sir no oh you didn't go perfect very
very very good racists good I had that fabulous ending in that ninth race great and I was sitting

absolutely no sense I was looking at my watch but unfortunately it was too dark in there to see it
my friends oh they loved it but I just uh absolutely said what did they like about it I don't know
they we walked out of there and everyone was silent and they were all one girl I was with was
crying she was so teared up about it and I was crying yeah I was crying too because I just wasted two
hours I was crying well I was so glad that he was shot in the end yeah get it over with you know
exactly I just shared at the end and got up out of there and left it was really a way every call
in that movie every single call was a deep emotional experience they were all looking and psychoanalyzing
exactly and his ex-wife was frowning and uh what Sandy he's in big trouble you know I didn't
see any difference from one show to the next they were all the same goofball callers and he couldn't
hang up on anybody in the same thing well why did you take that abuse you know I'm sure you
can't look at the frozen fingers syndrome well either then or yet it stuck somewhere he couldn't
get it out and every other call with the women with some how poor white trash house wife with
a southern accent well it was in Dallas don't forget that may have been a foul that's true that's
new but it was just a sorry film sorry ass uh piece of crap but let me tell you go see Mississippi
