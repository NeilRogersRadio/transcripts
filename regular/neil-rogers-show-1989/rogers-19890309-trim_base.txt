lot more interested in the good looking ones but all these people are obsessed
with the ugly one I always have every time I have one for grand
the pitch for the Tigers mark the bird Friedrich yeah mark the bird
which was a real interesting piece of work yeah you look like it was from
like well about margo Adam yes she reminds me more like more
dish Adam's family and that story about that what grandpa would have to say
about that yeah yeah
about the herspiel theater with that fabric oh do we have to go back in
that just let me tell you that I'm taking through my lunch now it is the
God's honest truth because I am a stage hand that I was working backstage and
saw her roughing into a bucket really and about 20 minutes later she was
taken out on a stretcher which takes a little bit of a humor out of it yeah
well she's okay now though isn't she I believe so one more thing that sports

60s that's the day is wishful thinking here's him now here's the forecast
lows for Friday night 50s 50s that Thursday was a math day but they've been very
optimistic okay in other words when they've been saying it's gonna be in the
low 70s if we get to 67 it's real lucky okay they've been real really pushing
it I think the chamber of commerce is like putting pressure on the weather
forecast is that I want to include soapers let's see Boston high of 35 partly
cloudy today Chicago mostly sunny in a high of 42 and we're only doing 57 or

go through to get my hairy carry to that really the flash my ass a little
that's the way I felt probably it's after one of the W I O D now every time
that weather comes up there I want to read it again okay I get this
compulsion to try to read it against you get at least some idea of the truth
okay I mean don't get me wrong so far is that one of the nicest guys you'd
ever want to know he's a super guy but his idea of the weather he's like
doing the weather for a Mexico City or something all right out of his mind hey

the makes me happy as to be oh I know there must be others and they know just how I feel
so the call they all start calling to get me all going me oh now help me
information more than that I cannot add except for he gets crazy when someone
makes him mad and the bird just keeps on catching cause he knows it's not real
go put me through the I'll do and get me out for me
oh
oh
oh
oh

oh
I don't know what he said one eight years ago you know I'll do yeah Richard's getting a little
carried away here let's go to Kendall hello now yes sir how you doing okay pal I have a question
yeah why do people move to Miami Beach is now is this like a rhetorical question now this is
an uh a little question that city officials um ask some people and they got a start on
conclusion you want to hear about go ahead sir I can't wait people move to Miami Beach for the beach
oh isn't that funny I'll be damned you mean they probably can they conducted a big study on
I probably spent about four hundred thousand dollars not just five thousand of course rates
raised by the private sector yeah and the average resident age 88 no 35
yeah and you believe that right of course yeah you know that's question about it a major
soft floor to magazine article mm-hmm I think who wrote that barber capidman and I think
there ought to be like a major TV uh investigation of that yeah what do you think about this
eastern stuff unbelievable what do you mean what do I think about it what does that mean
well the way Bush handle it and that Bush isn't handling it at all that's what I mean Bush
is a whim don't you understand that Bush is about as presidential as a pewy herman I know I'm
embarrassed to say I'm voted for that well I mean I don't know what made you people think that
this guy of a sudden grew some over the summertime or something I mean he got was always a whim
he's a bigger whim now than ever he's busy uh you know just putting on a pressure for his drinking
body it's just an embarrassment there it's just a joke I mean the guy's in his ass too yeah
he's only been in office less than a month now about three weeks and he's already made more
mistakes than most people making a lifetime I guess he's uh it's anyone is over I think
I think he could probably reduce the federal deficit if he would put a tax on every mistake that he
makes I wonder who he was hanging with that that that wife of his got a go man yeah you mean his
grandmother yeah well that's what America won didn't you remember when Reagan got in they said that
everybody wanted a father figure I guess they want a grandmother figure yeah okay with margo
well listen I think you've been out of material for about two or three minutes but have a great
say listen can I ask your question yeah real fast if it's more interesting than anything else you've
been saying yes can you claim me the asshole no why don't you have to want to double I mean I
could but we just don't have time we're in the big one to two hour we got a lot of stuff you're okay
pal we don't have time for stuff like that today Davy hello yeah meh oh yeah I'm gonna give you
ugly ugly of all time Charlie Keller used to play left field with the Yankees King Kong that you
remember yeah remember him yeah that's about the hundred years before I was born yeah but he was
he he had a nine brows across the top of the head I mean look exactly like a gorilla really oh well
he was before you were born that's correct King Kong that was the man okay thank you malthe raised
pretty upset about it too okay and fey Wayne's not too happy we have an open line and
broward now where that young gentleman just called in 524 w i do I have some of that good spring
water now I'm starting to feel almost human again I'm going through like a getting my second win
oh god man that sudden surge of all of that food just knocks you on your butt anyway let's go to
Delray hello hello see how you doing okay thank you and name's Truman believe it or not well
I like your book in cold blood it was really the reason I was calling it well several you know
sitting here one thing sort of struck me listening to that marina and inflatable commercial I
wish on why is it every time I hear inflatable by I think a marvel I don't know why that is but yeah
why is that I don't know just the two sort of go together I guess but the reason I was really calling
is I grew up I think you made me blowing it out of proportion you know what I mean okay
the reason I called originally was that I grew up in the Chicago area and I you know I've
followed the Chicago white-clothed handcuffs to some extent and you know ugly baseball players
were a trademark a Chicago Sherman Loller I think was probably as catchers he and Andy Etcherbeer and
I think have the catching award and yogi and well there was a no one for the cubs two of
a fact two of them there was Perry Cheedy you remember yep I sure do and he wasn't exactly you know
a good place to look at but there was people like early win and Nelly Fox with those great big jol
the yeah that was the classic and here's the guy was my favorite jungle Jim Rivera you remember
that yeah you got arrested for raping you have to write and you know what happened he fled you know
he was the first guy to really go head first you know the record well we don't want to get in bad
well you know but that's all you need in the second base yeah well it's and then speaking
of people getting shot or in jail any wait kiss to the Phillies he was one of the ugliest people
in a history and and will he put in had Jones yeah that's another way there was a really ugly guy
and here's one that I think that you couldn't really call him ugly because you could never see his
face especially the night games many monoso he was talking about you guys being nanny and Nelly
and putting head well out of the guy that's really what you're saying right and Hank Sauer that
was a nice I was another one and Hank Bauer yeah he was my favorite player when I was a kid
Hank Bauer right and Walt Dropa and here's Dropa yeah there's another moose for you my favorite
moose collection so we got Bruce Gower and Mr Dropa I guess who have make me okay now what let me
say one other thing here I I you know this I can't believe nobody has hit on this yet and I
think football football just doesn't have the class and the color that baseball does you know football
most guys I mean there are nicknames but not like in oh not like in bad like in base you know
I hear he couldn't I mean we we don't have an icky uh the words for example but we got some pretty
wild baseball players right I mean you're not gonna hear Nelly's in football well there's a few
Nelly's that's what Dave Coppe said and they got crystal glass or somebody like that and crystal
gear yeah okay well listen you've been a really informative caller but you're right on
television you like the white socks man you're right ugly as the day is long oh they're
they just one brief question I and nobody got it on me to play on the team nobody said on this
and I can't believe it the Easter when the Eastern pilots walked off the line yes sir all the other
pilots from all the other airlines I think maybe I heard this wrong but didn't they tell us
that hey in sympathy we're now going to fly safe yeah well they're just installing a little bit oh
is that what most of the people are used to that anyway so what's the big deal because I never used
to be too scared until they told me now that I fly in all these years on the face you know yeah
all right well that was just what I had today okay well listen you've been quite a caller believing
I have a great thank you 124 a w i d that was on a vocal line oh damn man we are really picking up
some serious team now because it's the big one to two obviously 278 9463 278 w i d on
america's only radio show where you also get the weather channel thrown in as kind of a bulls
no extra charge now we have a little something from the facts machine
obvious number one Billy Martin number two yogi pera yeah Billy had a schnauz that could stop
saying Lewis is no question about that anyway speaking of that if you have a big schnauz don't
bother to come by on Sunday but if you look almost human we certainly invite you to come out to
Toyota of Hollywood even a 128 w i o d here's another good vote on the facts machines as the
obvious man ever to put on a baseball uniform is none other than no neck Williams former Detroit
tiger no that yeah well these names it's a good vote but no neck played most of his very brief
illustrious career with the Indians Walter no neck Williams and I think also a little with the white
socks not that they wanted him to play but he was ugly enough and a white socks like those ugly
guys okay the white socks had a guy named Jim brideweezer who was astonishingly shockingly ugly okay
and that's what it takes to qualify to play for the white socks Harry carried by the way he
used to men easily forgotten because he was so many years with the cardinals and now for many
years with the cubs but in between was with the white socks which is why he left now you were
talking you said about a half hour ago that Joe Grazio is no longer doing the play
but yes he's got the contract okay so mr. he's going who is works he works anywhere that they'll
hire him uh he's moving from NBC to CBS or because he always does golf on CBS yeah well this is
really a thing when the games with Tom Seever for one year I see because it used to be when Joe
used to do the baseball game show when they when it would they have a rain a rainy day yeah and
they would remove the tarp from the field they used to remove the tarp from his head at the same
time that is correct but those were the days in fact when the lights would go out in the stadium they
used to use the reflection of the camera of Joe's dome in order to keep the broadcast on the screen
to get the lighting rowered hello Neil how you doing just great pal can you hear me on this
tape phone here I sure can listen can hear those quarters jiggling too are you sure it's a
paper answer okay I could get the operator on here for you all right listen if you want to talk
about ugly you really got to turn the hockey yeah I know people down here can't relate to that but I
know you remember Ed John stone I remember any shack remember Ed John stone yes but Eddie
shack had him beat Eddie shack had him all beat okay he had a schnauz that would kill Detroit
listen and Johnny Barr was ugly too that's before you were born sir
most likely listen a couple other things I forgot no I want to know the quarter answer the movies will
continue I wanted to know if you saw genuinely Kurdish and trading places no the other day no
got large breasts for a man that is correct she has bigger breasts than the guy what was his name
to play the Ron Ealy Ron St John Ron St John we find a big a gigantic poster picture of
Ron St John the building we brought it here in the studio life size and yeah and when I leave
here I'm gonna go home today on a one a if you never heard w a 1 a with wrong Shane John you
just wouldn't understand what you're using your music yeah your music boy you guys know that world

St. Louis bookers and those were spot and win more win more don't forget about win more pal well
listen here we have another called crest here and that's another story even the living are buried
in win more I was doing a shit this is true story Oliver you know has a pension which I think
is so professional for calling other talk show host at his station on the air you know are you
oh my god that's that is really crazy you know I was doing a show with a guest on another program
at J&O seriously but a month ago so we're talking about something entire studio with cable tv as a
matter of fact so what happens to getting is that all of a sudden you're not with that com teller
com com cast com cast I was at one time I see but that's not a story okay um how's your now I don't
know because I know it's one of the companies it sure is anyway I should work for them but anyway um
tell us that and all of a sudden we follow calls on the hotline see and of course they put
him on right away he starts how you doing he's talking about he's talking to the other talk show host
and already time for something I mean a man in a just a little he's incredible he can't control
him unbelievable when it comes from where do you come from hunger we'll listen keep it up and
you know it's nice having some you know on a new station on on I was the wonderful aisle of
dreams if they call it it's nice to hear the audience is under a hundred yes it's unbelievable
have a good life okay say hi to Lee for us all right 143 a w i o d that was a chronic guest on
Palm Beach County talk shows he was a good guy though but he's a chronic guest I guess uh 655
w i o d you'll never ever get on before we leave but it would sure be refreshing and exciting
to see that line flash again and just as I said that one of the brow lines went out okay here's
a mobile and powered hello yeah no yeah you get a lot of coolers with these English accents
calling in all the time and I just want to let you know that nine at nine at ten of them are just
the worst imitations of a British accent that you know I've ever heard like this one
well no no no let's still listen there are three questions you can screen these course from now on
okay they're from England they would know the answer to these questions okay by number one what is
the English equivalent of the McDonald's Shane hamburger speed McDonald's Shane there's an English
equivalent yeah and that's wimpies wimp wimpies yeah I think wimpies is one of the
most well it's not always good it's cold maybe a George Bush spent too much time in England is
that possible it's possible too many meals at wimpies George wimpies like the guy in papa he's
the exactly yes that's where they got it from okay they stole it from us like everything else let's
see right that war man they've never been the same again right my number two now in cricket
if someone says this is one of my favorite sports it is it's a good sport oh yeah in cricket it's a
score it's almost as good as thrilling what's that I say I really enjoy it yeah it's a good
slow but it's a good sport yeah like most of the British it's a little slow well yeah you could
say that all right if the score is two forty five for three what is it let me tell you the
British are the only people in the world who have sex on Monday and have an orgasm on Thursday
that's true that's true but it launched through Sunday that is true okay now what is the question
in cricket in cricket if the score is two forty five for three yeah what does that mean
and what's the answer well that means it's two hundred and forty five runs the three
wickets like three hours oh yeah when we wickets okay and what's number three number three
what is a wally and where would you buy one a wally yeah I thought that was on leave it to be
for no no no this is a wally and that is a large girkin oh it could be purchased any
uh fish and I bet you print said word which is he had one of those I bet he does yeah and I
can be called as the whole royal British Navy too right and I could be purchased from any
fish and chips shop in England oh boy anyone from me what about that British cuisine man I think
that explains a lot about you guys behavior okay that incredible British cuisine oh you've never
had a good chef with pie oh yeah I feel like Nanette that braille of his for the
good deal I mean you haven't lived to you guys jelly deals well I'll hold off okay until I'm just
ready to take my last guess okay thanks for the I just call my friendly douchebag okay thank you
last Margo Adams would say thanks for the tip thanks a lot I'll see you later one forty six
at WIOG and we can't we can't talk about wimpsies now but we can't talk about char-hut okay great
we're sorry that we can't recommend the nearest wimpsies and all those chips and all those horrendous
uh oh shepherds bonfire oh my god yeah but anyway char-hut is the it's 150 a WIOG and I was this
thing about British Royal they have always been confused because I wondered why you can be born
for example if if the king gets married then his wife is the queen am I right mm-hmm
but if the queen gets married like what is her husband's name I can never think of
or queen Elizabeth's husband's name what is it oh um yeah yeah mr. bland I mean he's like
totally without any personality at all what is it no he's not the king he hasn't become he's not
the king so as Elvis once said he said almost anybody can be a queen but only a very select few can
be king that's what Elvis said mm-hmm anyway what is his name anyway I keep all the duke of
Windsor no he's not the duke of Windsor no he's not is he the duke of Windsor was the one that was
married to Wallace Warfield and he gave up the throne so to speak wasn't he's not the duke of Windsor
and that's like that's like when he said that um what was the Dennis Ecclesley
was the new coach of the hurricane yeah Nick is getting I think he's catching it from you or something
not the duke of Windsor there's no cure for the Windsor was married to Wallace Warfield right
isn't that correct well and none of you people know anything about um prince Philip that's it he's
not the duke of Windsor he does have some other official name like that like uh duke of Earl or
something like that yeah okay Miami hello hello duke of mass I think it is yes I kneel yeah listen
now please don't hang up on me yeah I told you earlier about man that no no I can't talk to
twice in the same days sir please spare me the pain I mean your first call was embarrassing
enough Miami hello no in fact uh that reaches pacemaker just one of the calls yes
no I think he's left the club of world consort well excuse me uh big a pardon
hey wait no isn't that prince Philip yeah he's prince but it is true though I've that's like
an honorary title but it that's right it's not a joke though in the king if somebody inherits
the throne and becomes king then when he gets married his wife is the queen right right uh but if
the queen gets married her husband doesn't become the king because he's not part of the uh the
bloodline he's not in the right kind of like horses you know that's why you notice that the queen

your advice because I'm getting really sick of this uh sunshine that we're crap I got continental
cables oh boy good luck to you pal well listen I gave him a call today for the first time I got
off my ass and uh did did it so uh the uh the lady over there got a little pissed off and uh

something you know I'm gonna have to dump it's not bad she goes I go yeah I'm calling from
lottery I want that a sports channel and I'm sick of the Florida Sunshine Networks because the
world who gave you the idea to call oh boy and I go well I'm a listener I was the local radio
person now and she gives me a Roger's right she's not the same anymore and I quote where does this
asshole get off doing this blank what am I supposed to do I get verbally abused and I'm calling my
cable company well I would call and talk to one of the supervisors they're continental and tell
them that uh you got that kind of treatment I mean you're paying okay you're paying I'm paying
serious bucks I'm gonna call when I get home yeah because I'm gonna tell them the next time that
they're rude to any of my callers see where I get off doing it is that we have sports channel
of Florida buying advertising their their message the thrust of what they're doing is to try to
get public support and they you know if they get enough people to call the various cable systems
public demand will dictate that they're going to have to eventually more and more put on the
sports channel of Florida they can't wait if that anyone's in the gaming if he hasn't got any
business he's got any business treating you like that and I'm going to call continental cable
when I get home today and chew them a good ass okay because I got the number in the names of some
of the uh stupid advisors over there and they got no business treating customers like crap that's
the problem with cable operators man they got a monopoly in every community and they figure if
you don't like what they're giving you a drop dead go to hell and stick it in your ear okay
Neil bird thanks a lot I got to call my friend Chris to do you back okay thank buddy what is that
you know what that does that really flash my ass a little bit that's right here what is that
really piss me off he should tell the same story to yeah when he calls and talks to the supervise
I mean all we're doing is pass in a message along and letting the public know the facts I mean
we you know we're supposed to keep it a secret that the Sunshine Network has an sensuous
relationship with the most of the cable operators they got a piece of the action and as a
result they're trying to keep the sports channel floored off and put them out of business
and keep the public from getting to see the heat games and hurricane games and NHL hockey and all
that other stuff and speaking of that there's Joe I'm gonna leave this place so meticulously clean man
