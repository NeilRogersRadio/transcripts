okay
so i'll run to those phones
for the phone
oh wait a minute one just lit up now is a lot more exciting when it was
blank
but uh... may take a little while to get all of the stuff by chest okay but you
finally
reach a point
where you've taken enough crap
and you say hey this is gonna stop
now i don't know how many people heard the insipid garbage that was on this
radio station yesterday afternoon
and i'm being very kind when i use the word garbage
it it always shocks me how many different ways i will say this that the
various host in this market
see i mean if if i'm going to sit here with allis or somebody on other
station
that's great that's fun we have a lot of good fun to and we don't make a whole
show out of it in fact we really do it for more than a few minutes of the
time
and uh...
we never invite the audience to participate all the ones in a while of you
know some of our spies will participate
or there'll be a huge shot here and there but we don't
we don't orchestrate an entire we shut that stupid thing up
you can't say that
always had shot it off
it all that's what he was that that he said something to
that word would have applied very well to what i heard yesterday
for four hours
uh...
and you know everybody's been getting along real well and i thought everybody had
their place in life under control you know we all do our own thing
and i think i said several times that one of the joys been on the station is
that
it's not like you're holding up the whole operation like we were at certain
other places it like everybody's got their own very large audience mike's got
his own unique wild huge audience in the morning
and we certainly got that going here in in the midday to know question about
that they might have mail it rich to her near that he got from the mail should
indicate something
and steve has got a big audience in the afternoon and sports talks got it so
thing and yeah there's a certain amount of crossover
but i got to be honest with you i don't
think it's all that great
really i really don't know i really don't
which is fine
i mean if it was a struggling station if i can use that word then it's a
different story but it's not at station that's only going to get better and
better and have a big audience
assuming of course that each individual can put his or her ego in its
proper perspective
all and be a part of a whole team as opposed to
something else
ego
but started to say that it's amazing to me over the years how many different
ways people can
twist and manipulate so as to orchestrate the audience in due an entire
program of neal Rogers bashing
nothing else about stand i spoke to stand is morning by the way in here
are very good friends and always will be in sply out we've had our moments
and the stand is okay and hopefully he'll be back on here like he should be
some day soon somewhere
but uh... i remember that one show that he did over at winds when we were
on a data
uh... but at least at least one thing he was honest about it okay he went on a
year and he said we're gonna bash neal for four hours today which i never have
forgiven for was a tasteless right grotesque thing
and uh...
it was that his intentions i don't think we're for the way it turned out but
naturally once you open up the door for that uh...
it becomes self-evident what's gonna happen
and it's no it takes no talent to do that i mean that takes no style or
flare talent whatsoever
is to preside over an entire program
where the purpose is just to invite the audience to bash a particular
individual whether it's another talk host on your own station
or whatever it might be
i just can't envision i can't imagine going on here and saying okay let's
um...
rippley foulard today for four hours okay never done it
we've never done it never invite anybody to call in a rep other talk show host
although as i said some of them do
and usually when i do it not always but usually
like with leave for example i don't have any hard feelings with leaf
foulies is pretty good guy when we used to call us we still some good fun on
here
and i harbor no ill feelings toward them on where they are there i mean he did
destroy her help destroy w snooze but that's
it wasn't done out of malice it was done out of the confidence okay and there's
a big difference
no seriously not to be there you go again with that can't be man they ripped you
and i see us today and i'm telling you if you would have heard any of it you
would be apoplectic i'm so glad i was busy
yes now the one thing that we've done consistently since i came here somebody
calls in wants to rip mic wants to rip steve i tell them very quickly
could i
call them if you got a problem okay
we're not going to play that game
and i don't sit in a listen to ten minutes of it and then turn around say
well jay you got it all wrong and it's really unfair you know because that's
that reminds me of what surely spellburg used to do when i was a k team many
many moons ago and i first came to the market
and she would let somebody just rip me and i mean just us doing assault a
personal assault at every kind of slanderous crap in the world and then after
they've been on for five ten minutes rambling and hating and spewing she said
all that's not talk about him let's talk about something intelligent
but of course not she let them get out here you know when they totally ran out
of steam at no more venom dispute at that point
she would say oh well we didn't really want to do that but she made a point of
letting it all go on the air
and what i heard yesterday which allegedly was a discussion of this movie talk
radio not it's kind of difficult i've a discussion of a movie talk radio
because nobody's seen it is not yet
there's been private screenings with some of the people in the media including
steve of scene at i haven't seen it but
how can anybody discuss it
or the character in it
when they haven't seen it
i mean i discussed rainman after i saw it just come out of short time and it
took you notice it took a while sure it's not too many people had seen it yet
but at least it was in the theaters which is a good start
what followed thereafter was um... nearly four hours
of bashing new rodges and glen hill
now one of the things i kept hearing is that this program has no substance
now these are all these great pseudo intellectuals out there who are so bright
and we love those topics and uh... that's always just garbage
which of course if that's the case then they don't need to be listening to it
because we're not changing
we're not changing
and i love the way steve likes to engage some of his car's in this all yeah
nearly as the greatest when you see those topics and i wish once in a while he
go back and do that
it's not gonna happen okay it just isn't gonna happen
and some of you who are too immature to understand
this is a different show
there are no heavy topics in a mic renery show
and if you told mike well i think tomorrow you ought to come on and discuss
uh... brain surgery
he'd laugh at you okay because he's not gonna do it
he's very successful doing what he does
and nobody complains about that
amazing
and were very successful doing what we do here
and i hate to break the news to you but when the bird first came on the show
back in the spring
two years ago all we had in the in the daytime was a nine share on w i n's it's
only had a nine four or five is a good number okay
a nine is be it on her to on a m radio
that heard of an fm radio to be honest with except maybe for life
and then in the morning on zeta that year when a lot of these old far its
weren't listening
all we did was beat every morning show in the market
the last book that we were there every one of them okay
including some people have been on the year for many many years
thirteen yeah
twenty five fifty four we beat him the last trend we were at number one eighteen
thirty four i mean for a talk show regardless of what bandids on i have those
demographics we have this huge audience and i like to have to go through and
repeat all of this because i don't like to do a lot of self-serving
stuff i really don't
and i find it terminally boring to hear people one after another of these
butlickers calling and uh... this ingratiating thing i've talked about this for
years where the uh... with the callers feel they have to ingratiate
themselves with a host it's disgusting
but evidently there's a lot of substance to it
now evidently because that's what i heard for four hours yesterday and all
these people are so disbruddled
that there's no substance on this program in your cackling in my whatever it is
we do here
uh... boy they sure got a lot of substance yesterday
it was that juvenile
which near type stuff i used to hear it over there all the time i'd be driving
home at midnight
when i worked at snooze at night
i'd hear how come you're so nice and he's so mean i mean it's for these for
these people are going through their second child
and most of more pretty old to by the way most of the colors there was one twenty
year old pinhead
uh... who is
you know singing the virtues of the alan birchow and how it was so much more
interesting this one
well because alan used to have topics
uh... my god
a lot of this i would be audience and i've been saying this for many weeks and i
try not to say too often because naturally somebody enjoys the show it's
fine we don't care where they come from
oh yeah we got that idiot calling again i can dish it out but i can take it
let me say it again
i can take all the ripping in the abuse by people on the stations which means
it doesn't mean i'm not going to give it back because if it is worthy of it i
will
but not on this station
not on this station
and not to let people go on for five and ten minutes and put some of them on a
hold and carry them over and ripping and tearing and telling us what we ought to
be doing and what we should be doing that that's not a talk show
that's not substance it's not a talk show
it's not anything but swill
and as i said before and this includes s i herch the insurance guy out there
called in again yesterday which prompted me to call about twenty to five
if you don't like the show don't listen
and i just had a guy before i came on the air who knows
side very well
and tells me he listens every day of course they all do
every one of this man is so filled and he started out with this particular
call which is what really got me that's when i had to call on the bat line
and he started out about how well no question the two shows are different
steve niel is one thing you do want like like he was an objective
caller many started ripping into you about a cackling idiot and i kind of crap
and then by the end of the call he had worked his usual venom and hysteria
and emotion up to the point he was just uh... mouth breathing with his hate
but the man can't stop listening he's been calling with hate calls for our
not how many years
and this applies to anybody else out there you don't like to show we don't need
you go away
the only show in this
community i'm sure maybe in america where people are invited
to go away
because i don't want to punish you i don't want to hurt you if you are harmed by
the show
if you're wounded by the show if you're insulted by the show if you don't
understand it if you
disappointed if you feel there is any substance that we ought to be talking about
some real original things like capital punishment and have a few rabbis on
forget it because it isn't gonna happen
but don't waste
your time
and the good airtime
calling to ingratiate yourself with mother host so that you can rip this show
for five or ten minutes
and rip glimps for five or ten minutes if you don't like him
tough luck he's not going anywhere he's there be here
and it's a lot more than just laugh but you only hear some of you what you want
to hear that's correct
you only hear what you want to hear and you're all experts what time of your
shows on okay all you experts out there when the hell is your show on
when you get your such experts out there on programming and radio when you get
your show you can have any side kick it's likely
anybody have made the out of space queen on whatever you want okay
and i hear a lot of these mouth breathing goofballs out there all i got to do is
hear a voice on the radio right away that got one hand in their crotch and
the other with a finger somewhere
i mean some of you people are pathetic it's just a radio show
that's all just a radio show
and like i've always said about the chronic regulars
where they got no life
they got a real problem
a real problem i've never encountered any
chronic regular over the years that i've been on the air that's almost thirty
who didn't have serious serious problems
because to those people it's not just a radio show it's their life
right and i got news for you baby it's a job to me
and when i walk out of here at two o'clock by a minute after
i don't remember a god damn thing that happened in a previous four hours
as i've got all as i pushed the door
that's like closing the door on the program all the job it's a radio show
and the other ones of you out there who think you're set like the this miserable
bag that called in who was allowed to go on a great like well she works with
people and she knows human nature and all that nil he's so hate
full and he's so full of hate
yeah that's why we raised thirty five to forty thousand dollars for the
Camilo's house okay or they didn't talk about that because i'm no i'll
they somehow left that out are you serious and the overwhelming majority of
that money by the way came from the morons who listened to this radio show
okay i know that nobody with a brain could ever listen to this show
nobody with any humanity could ever listen to this show but it must come as a
great shock to you that the overwhelming majority
of those dollars came from the listeners of this program
it's twenty minutes past ten at w i d i got a lot more to say but we got to do a
break you know life goes on life is not just monologues alone as bob
lanceter would say now we got the time straightened out here it's going to be
noon to three a week from the center day the 14th of January that's
Stephen are going to be a Toyota of Hollywood now more with neo-roger our new
stock radio six ten w i o d we're here in homes to show you that miraculous new
product polyderma we pick the oldest lady we could find and apply just a
little dab of polyderm honor rubbed it in real good and just look at the
amazing results oh my i look and feel like i'm 20 again but wait let's put grandma
through fifty consecutive washes so wait no i'll have it all my hours later
will dry her up and she still is young looking as ever
and just look at that shine polyderma is made from an exclusive formula
ex out sixty plus that combines the facial molecules and leaves you with young
looking skin again and gives a hard coating that lasts and lasts for weeks
polyderma caution too much polyderma plighted one time can create undesirable results
polyderma what was that well we had to chop the end off because it uh... talked
about the uh... station this was originally on years and years ago
those are friend caprita needs to be a way that it just died well it talked about
glove signing for and we didn't want to leave that on there but why didn't why not
eliminated starting at polyderma before that word
oh as opposed to like in the middle of polyderma
uh... it was quite like that
sorry oh boy i'm gonna start screaming these ahead of time although we do appreciate
getting them on car because we don't have any place to double our material so we
got stuff always in in the hopper you know that well here someday if we live
long enough but uh... yet we need everything on car yeah so when you send
this material so you know still some cards from some radio station make sure we
get them on car
by the way the number one prime time uh... tv show last recording to
ac nielson the care and carpenter sterile be done
that's a pride i don't even have no substance
on this program it seems to me we discussed that
that we played some carpenter music at like one day the day after it was on
and it seems to me that if somebody objectively listen to the show even though
we don't do topical radio far from it and we don't claim to
that uh... actually even by accident we get into a lot more topics than some
of the shows where they claim to be very heavily topical oriented
where every time they have open phones basically turns out to be a breast
beating uh... how wonderful i am or let's rip niel for four hours
uh... what is your favorite steve can show by the way
it's ten twenty seven at the wi-w day no i i just uh... i i got to be honest with
you i felt i knew that the day was coming sooner or later
and it just happened it just happened yesterday and i've restrained myself long
enough and i keep hearing it i you know i hear it in bits and pieces
and even yesterday somebody called in fact i think it was the first call yesterday
right out of the box and they started wonder rips the exit
knock it off okay i don't want to hear it and i don't right i don't want to hear it
it sucks
and as far as dishing it out your damn right boy anybody else in a market who does
not work on his station i'll be delighted to rip most of them because most of
deserve it okay there are a lot of amateur hour people on here in this market
it's a bush league town with a lot of bush league listeners too and especially
bush league callers and listening to some of those voices and then hearing
sigh i mean that was that was just the
crowning blow to me that was just the um... the straw that broke the moose cows
back incredible so most of these were old most of
more old yeah uh... who are forced to listen to frozen dials up in
years i would say forty five plus crown i'm not saying forty five is all because i'm
forty six but i mean most of them were well up there
and that's another thing that they seem to be having a little culture shock and going
through and i don't give a damn what anybody here says the name of the game
in this business is twenty five to fifty four that's the demographic the people want
yet people younger than that that's fine and if you have some older that's okay too
but nobody buys those people okay we don't have any
polident commercials on this radio station we are going to have any okay
we don't even have effort and
and so i know it's a little painful and like when i tell nick i don't want to keep
here in these old voices and i don't want to hear them i really don't and i hear
too much of that on this radio station and that's one of the things that they
brought us over here for was to bring some living and breathing people back to
a-m radio on the age of a hundred and it's got to happen
because you're never going to maximize your potential this is a business i hate
to break that news to you it's a business you're never going to maximize your
potential when you deal with people a hundred years plus it just ain't going to
happen not the audience that anybody wants i mean
anybody and also notice you know that always the audience is always going to do
this pitting the one against the other i mentioned that when i called steve on
the areas today they just love to do that especially in this market because
they're like little children and they have to create this hostility and then sit
out there and take the joy and oh look at this they're fighting bye bye bye yeah
this is what they really love and i noticed that when a lot of the
carers would call it and immediately ingratiate themselves with a host
but then so that they would have more time to be allowed to say but the other
one you know he saw terabyte rips the old people and it's disgusting
one guy even called in and made this comment about um
when i do the disclaimer about being an old fart it doesn't necessarily mean
age he says that's like calling somebody a nigger but saying that uh
some of them are like white people or something like that what yeah
and it was allowed to go uh
and the response was well i don't really rag on old people that much steves guest
by the way today will be jamey swartz the nine year old being kicked out of viewpoint condos
who was on the today part of this part too about
nailed white the old parts and the prunes i keep hearing that word coming up
any afternoon prunes a lot and that thing we got in there prunes a lot or that boobs a lot
but anyway um that's the subject and it's amazing to me but it seems to me when i
hear that shows and i commended steve yesterday i'll do it again i think he's doing a great
job on that subject it's picked up national exposure it is a disgusting thing and that's the syndrome
we talk about so it's got nothing to do with who's nicer to old people or who's stereotypes
it's got to do with the reality of life here in south florida and when somebody is doing a series
of shows on the very subject but then would like to suggest that it's only neo who rags on the old
people then there's got to be something very wrong somewhere okay somebody isn't listening to the
sound of his own voice all right so i think you know it's easy to be lazy i'm going to be honest
people think well you know these guys come in here they do no preparation they don't have to read
the papers they don't bring up topics uh you know we had a guest yesterday and we probably won't
have another one for six to nine months you know Tom's always a fun guest but we don't have guest
basically but it's not easy to come in every day and to try to do different things and to try to
get people uh you know in a good mood and get them laughing especially in this time where everybody
enjoys being miserable to begin with and that's one of the reasons they resent your laughter is
because they can't stand hearing somebody having a good time absolutely too bad yeah tough
cookies okay like i said if you don't like it goodbye right now reach over to the radio find
something else put your hand somewhere else okay find something else to occupy your time
but don't assume that because you're going to call up Steve are you going to do this you're
going to do that we're going to change the show it isn't going to happen and we're not going to
have a lot of serious guests on the program or guest period we don't do that anymore all right
i did that for years and i finally felt embarrassment i looked back at my guest counter and i realized
i kept having the same damn people on over and over again and one of the reasons that happens this
is in New York or Los Angeles this is this is a bush leg it's a big hick town who the hell you
going to put on here in this town there's nobody here and that's why you wind up hearing the same
ponderous people over and over and over and over again to the point where you could just puke
when you hear their name because it's boring and the first sin in being on the year is boring the
audience okay 1033 at w i o d and i want to tell you about the armadillo cafe now trust me you don't
have to trust me stop by there yourself and you'll agree with me that this is one of the finest
now we don't want to be bitter ronjure 1038 at w i o d and uh it really you know the people and i
guess people follow the lead of the host okay because i did hear several of these people yesterday
who were playing their little amateur psychology oh and that bothers me okay because it's this arrogant
condescending kind of view of life like well i'm so uh next bird in life and i have all the answers
and all this other crap and like i've told you people before you don't know a god damn thing about
any of the people you hear on radio or television you don't know them and just like i keep using the
example of sandy patent who came across this little mistweet of the radio with sugar cookies
michael sugar cookies and all that in syphids syrupy crap and was according to most of the people
who worked with her in this building one of the biggest pain in the butts who ever came down
the pike in his business so it goes to show you that what you hear is not what you get okay it's a
radio show it's an act it's a stick and i hear these people going on and i know yes he's filled with
hate and i've studied human psychology but but but but you can be you don't know crap okay you don't
know from nothing so as i said if you're disgruntled if you're unhappy don't waste your time with this
show okay go to your favorite show stick with it find something else to do the rest of the day
and we'll all live happily ever after okay but don't give me this song in a dance about how we have
to be like Steve or we have to be because it's not going to happen it's never going to happen
in a million years it isn't going to happen okay and it wouldn't be good for the station for it to
happen because we don't want to save this all day and for you if you're excited about hearing
the topics you know that have been done eight million times more power to you okay that's not my
cup of tea i'm not into it anymore i'm not only not into doing it on the year i'm not into even
listening to it because i've heard it all there's nothing more to be said about abortion there's
nothing more to be said about capital punishment there's nothing more to be said about all the other
list of trite tried and true topics did it have been on why do you think on the tv talk shows now
they come up with something more bizarre every day because they're burned out man they got nothing
left donny you mudwrestling in the middle of a ring with some wild women mudwrestlers whoever thought
they'd come to the day they'd see that but hey if like he said if that's what it takes that's what
he'll do because all the other stuff's been done eight billion times so if you enjoy the humor on
his show if you have a good time if you enjoy the entertainment and they're just a ton of people
out there who do great and if you don't go away i wish you a happy life i wish you no ill will okay
just go away we don't need you because for every one of you there'll be five or ten other people
who will discover it probably by accident or by word of mouth and they'll replace you
and will all live happily ever after but see that's a problem in his town because happy is not a
word that's supposed to be there not happily ever after miserably ever after and don't give me this
crap about how i generalize or how i stereotype because the fact is that all too many of the old
people of this community behave like barbarians they behave in a way that is totally socially
unacceptable okay they're driving their behavior in restaurants their rudeness the way they
conduct themselves on these shows i i honestly thought that w gb s had made a comeback yesterday i
really did because it sounded like that same old malcontent crowd again who didn't have anywhere else
to go and suddenly found that you know that that one share of the audience when they were on the
year doing talk when Jefferson pilot just aborted that radio station here's a station that at a
50,000 watt daytime signal the best signal at anywhere a radio station in the entire state and
they were doing ones ones kind of reminds me of a hundred thousand watt FM that does the same thing
well that's another story it sure is but i'm talking about a station with a signal like i'd be
heard over all the whole two thirds of the state and they were doing ones and that was mr.
Collins and mr. Fowler in their infinite wisdom pretty sad commentary when you got that kind of a
facility and you can't do anything with it and you got to go and buy a successful already established
station in order to have a winner and of course we see what's happened to that place
during their reign okay but the rampant jealousy that exists in this community in this business
that's what really gets to me it's pathetic it's embarrassing and i've said this many times before
and i'll say it again i don't care what anybody else makes it doesn't it doesn't affect me in any way
you know like i told you more down he made twenty two million dollars last year that's not an inflated
figure that's accurate more power to him he made fifty two million i don't be grudging a dime of it
Larry King has made a fortune since he gave them the good con job over there at mutual okay
he's probably making over a million bucks a year and with with all of my negative feelings and i
got a lot of them about Larry and the things that he's done to people in spite of all of that i
don't be grudging a dime of it i hope he makes ten million because i you know people deserve it
management jerks you around enough in this business you get a chance to make it go for it
but i hope i got the message across and i hope i don't have to do it again and on those days when
people haven't got a show and it didn't make any difference who it is whether it was Stan on that
infamous day in fact i used to make the comment i wondered if he could remember and get through an
entire show without mentioning my name and it could never have no it never happened couldn't do it
just they couldn't do it like a bunch of old hands bunch of old fish wives
out at neil in the bar in the cacle and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
well what the hell kind of a show is that is that substance is that stimulating is that entertaining
is that interesting again if it happened in an isolated case oh i guess it could be funny it could
be a lot of things happen for a couple of minutes but to make an entire program of it over and
over again and then i heard the comment also made yesterday and i guess it was in a tongue in
cheek wave some caller about one of my listeners who came over and now listens to Steve
and a comment was well in spite of all the terrible things that neil used to say about me used to
and i'm sure was said tongue in cheek and humor but the amazing part of it is there were a lot of
things said about me before i came here on that show that were not said in humor at all no
i can recall the show with mr x and bob quinst one day that i heard in the car and i just
i was in shock i'm not talking just about a professional criticism or the guy shows socks or whatever
like i'm talking about the lowest the basis the most grotesque personal attack that i've ever heard and see
i believe in this business you have to know where to draw the line and you can have fun with
things and you can joke about things and if there are people who think in like galeson can't take it
that's their problem that is their problem but when you really start getting down dirty and personal
and nasty and when you don't even know what the hell you're talking about is those individuals didn't
then it's a horse of another color okay but when i came here i forgot all of that or i tempted to
and i still intend to do my best to continue one of those circumstances but that doesn't mean i'm
going to sit still for four hours in the old rogers bashing anytime somebody don't have a show
or something else useful to talk about because i thought that that audience were also
area-dite also educated also intellectual that they didn't have to stoop to that okay that they could
discuss all of these important things going on in the world for example the episode that took place
with the libyans the other day i mean you know people are some people are wondering if we're
going to have world war three because of that it would seem to mean maybe that would be something
that would be discussed on a topical intellectual show as opposed to oh that bird his life he's
disgusting he's revolting and i used to love the listening deal but i just i can't anymore it's
the what does he do a ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba one after another after
another odd nauseam disgusting revolting wrote test
and if i sound a little pissed this morning i am boy i'm foaming at them out
because i'm getting tired of it this show is not a subject of conversation on any other show on
this radio station they want to talk about us any other stations that's great we can make sure
they give the frequency and the time that we're on okay and make some mention the name a lot of
times but there's still a lot of people don't know where we are yet a lot of them
hmm i ran into some young lady the other day she said oh but he never saw before in my life
she said uh love your show my husband turned me on to your show and he's really upset he can't find
where you are don't know where you are and i had a teller well there hasn't been a word about it
outside the radio station it hasn't been one word true that's true someday there will be i'm sure
there really if we live long enough there will be good but i'm going to get this all out of my
system today anyway because i'm just in a surly squirrelly mood about that stuff you know
and i think we've been very you know again i want to pet myself in the back but i think basically
we've tried very hard to promote the other shows on this station there isn't a day that goes by that
we don't give many many promos for steven what the guests are and yeah we'll have a little fun
with it from time to time but not in a venomous way i hope he gets a six or a seven in the next
i hope mike gets an eight and i hope we get a nine absolutely okay i hope sports talk gets a 20
what are we here that's great that's what it's all about but this very clever manipulation it goes
on to orchestrate something i mean if you don't want to hear it all you got to say hey we're not
going to talk about it that's all that's what i do people call in want to rip mike you know
like mike showed don't listen to it he don't need to he's got more listeners than anybody in the
market in the morning he's got more than he can handle okay he doesn't need you
same with the show but here that kind of behavior yesterday with that audience man and just
bunch of butt kissing butt sucking butt licking douchebags that are just want to
ingratiate themselves for the great opportunity of just ripping and shredding and tearing and
and again jealousy okay and i got news for i hate to break the news for this show is going to be
real successful on this station just like it was on wins and just like it was on zeta just like
it was on w and w s real successful even without some of those who i'm sure turn the radio off 15
20 minutes ago didn't they no they didn't see that's what the story come on every one of them is
listening that's what i'm so they must go away masochists folks there's another talk show on it
this time it does talk exactly every day the sweetest most wonderful lady just ask roger he'll tell
she is the sweetest lady in the history of mankind that's saying what do you give it a try
exactly check it out you're gonna love that stimulating man now there's some substance something you
can sink your teeth into okay even if they're in a glass it's seven ninety okay that is correct
seven ninety on the a m dial wol d all right check it out believe me try it you'll like it i love it
and if you have trouble sleeping man you want a quick nap in the middle of the day time there's
nothing better anywhere absolutely oh we're not going to take another break this all right oh
fantastic because i'm really full of it today i mean full of it i'm usually full of it but more
so today than ever because it gets pretty stinking ponderous you know what i'm saying
that every time you turn on the radio people are orchestrating like like and i didn't hear it but
you told me about that show with ernie and then johnny dark gave me one version and we had all this
so but the bottom line is neo roger is not a topic for a talk show any more than ernie sochen is
a topic for a talk show maybe concentration camps are a topic but see that's the difference i
mean to have a little fun with somebody as a throwawayer for a couple of minutes that's one thing
to be like the band leader and to be whipping and flagulating the audience in on a one-hand saying
oh don't do it don't do it but let him go on for ten minutes and ripping and slashing and tearing and
that's that's just crap is what it is unadulterated pure crap so let me again and i thought we had
already said a lot of this let me say it again we're not going to be doing heavy topics
we're not going to change the show for steve his listeners or anybody else it's going to be just
what it has been for the last two years with usually a much lower stress level i don't know i'm
saying it because my head's about ready to blow off but with a lower stress level and like
livable you know and people want to have a good time and enjoy some of the stuff we play in the
stuff we talk about we're not going to be discussing brain surgery we're not going to solve the
problems of the world on occasion we'll do something worthwhile like raising all of that money
for chameleus house or anything else worthwhile it comes along we'll do our best and that's it
this program is not the answer to the problems of the universe it's a radio show
and i hate to break the news to you the other programs aren't the answer to the problems of the
universe either even though some people in their own ego maniacal uh mines may believe it
they're wrong they're absolutely wrong
there reminds me of that mike seagull stirrace to tell you know after we got the um
and it was mostly his campaign he deserved the call the local measured servicing
defeated with a petition right southern bell
so now we're being tackled next the next seriously the next night he came on he was so
and of course this is a man totally humorless totally without any sense of humor
takes himself a thousand times too seriously he used to do six to eight of w snooze before i came on
and he came on that night to announce and he was breakfast flushed with his own success and we
we got the we beat the phone company and now the next we're going to solve the problems of the
medical problem and then we're going to work out the problems of the legal profession and
and he meant that that was the frightening part he wasn't joking he was serious
i mean now that he had pulled off this tremendous coup he was now going to pray and again i
i guess that's fine if you're one of those people who really want who is a crusader that's great
i used to do a lot of that stuff too until i realized i was talking to myself
like that show with dr tyson on cocaine hello doctor i'm taking selfie
that's what this town is all about so don't give me all this crap oh you know what go people
the bottom line is the majority of you who don't like me or don't like this show our bigots why
did you just admit it okay because i heard some of that stuff in there yesterday too and you
know something i couldn't give a good god damn less if you're home of phobic then i'd look in
the mirror because you probably got a problem with yourself okay because what i do in none of your
business all right what anybody else does as long as they're not hurting anybody it's not in your
business so don't try to intellectualize your bigotry in fact some of the mouth breathers who
just worded out you know at least they're more intellectually honest than the pseudo intellectuals
who come on and are giving us instructions and amateurs psychology and telling us how we should
be living and at least your normal and blah blah blah blah stick it up your butt okay you morons
don't start feeding me all this pseudo intellectual crap because that's all it is you just a bunch of
bigots and you just can't believe you just can't handle the fact that here's this this middle
aged bald aging fat faggot who's on the air in Miami saying any god damn thing that he wants who's
been so successful and has got the top ratings in the market and just run circles around anybody
else on the air you can't stand that can you it drives you crazy including some of the people
at another station i want to mention wold do i all guess i just did anyway let me just mention this
because we promised Joe Johnson that we would mention this is great this is weird i like this yogurt
or burst i thought for a minute i thought it said yogurt or bus
with wio they were almost at the end of the first traumatic hour here
and every line's lit no now somebody dropped off and they've expired when i went into that last
little burst they put it out so anyway that's the bottom line oh look at that next got those
bizarre bifocals on today doesn't he look really a pseudo intellectual today
first what is that all the procedure yeah correct i got to get that pseudo intellectual crowd
now i'm serious i have seldom heard and i've heard a whole bunch of those shows and a lot of them
by the way have been on this station thankfully however mostly before we came here and i
didn't really think i'd hear it again but yesterday's was one of the all-time greats it was
really incredible because it just never stopped i mean i would say the three out of every four calls
basically were the same thing and they kept saying that this show all we did was the same thing
every day and each one of them was saying the same thing including the ones who were bashing you
they don't like you tough goodbye he's not going anywhere all right he's not leaving
and i'm not going anywhere i'm not leaving okay so i know this is a tremendous shock to your system
and you're going to have to make a tremendous adjustment in your lives but that's the way it goes
that's the way the cookie crumbles okay it is just a radio show and that bag that was held on she
was held on through two breaks through a newscast she's on for a half an hour and a grand she was a
little bit of fun but she ain't fooling me i know exactly where she's coming from and who's pulling
her wheels okay i know what that call was all about i'm not going to do something about this yeah
do something about it turn the dial okay save yourself a lot of grief because nothing's going to
change oh she's going to do something about it yeah she's going to do something about it like
stick her left arm all the way where the moon don't shine okay up to her throat she can tickle her
tonsils all right but i have never heard such a whining bunch of cry babies in all my life as
i heard yesterday afternoon who just look and it's always the same core of people who sees they
just see the opening there and they seize any opportunity to keep repeating the same old crap
over and over again and as you say the sad part the part that is the most bizarre the most
ironic is the baking quote chapter and verse of every word that is said they are all listening
right now as i speak and getting duly indignant and outraged and great i'm glad we provide you a
service thank god that we're here okay what the hell would you do if i ever disappear you
wouldn't know whether to scream or eat your kid about that okay oh so that wraps up our first
traumatic our field is like bob lancer tonight one of those long emotional monologues
the sky is falling the sky is falling and then every 90 year old old fart would be on the
phone are you right you right i get my my polo then the becoming the phone is they were making
guttural sounds with bob and but anyway i've seen it all you know and uh
gale brightest any by now she's a butch-tapper image a little bit she's going to really do a tremendous
job with a new well she had a little problem i'm gonna show a couple of weeks ago but uh i don't
think she's going to be interfering in anybody's life at any time ever as a matter of fact she's
got the eleven o'clock news and we'll come back with our number two at eleven o' five steve with
jenny swartz and part two of that condo hysteria at viewpoint condos that's a two this afternoon on
six ten w i o d okay now listen to gale is still listening in the newsroom gale we want you to
have a good day it's eleven o' six at w i o d we're back for a second hour here on a wonderful
Thursday everybody is happy and i just heard a incredible sandy paton stir which we're not
gonna repeat on the air nor will we divulge the source of the story but it was really incredible
anyway moving right along let's see this somebody expired in brower during the news break
which is fine because we haven't taken any calls yet and may not and the book disappeared too good
okay five two four w i o d in brower there it goes and the book a two seven eight nine four six three
two seven eight w i o d and we'll start and and let me just say this i'm gonna preface it right now
this is gonna be a uh cane bashing show if you think we're gonna do that you're crazy because i'll
hang up on you so fast you won't know what hits you we don't do that on this show and we shouldn't
be doing it on the station but as i said at great length unfortunately there are sometimes people
come in they really have nothing to talk about and it's very easy show i guess to uh you know
orchestrate let's rip niel and the bird for four hours you know which is basically what happened
here yesterday until i called and then all of a sudden there was kind of a change of heart
of a little bit later to the call uh where are we going Miami hello hello niel how are you great
gug and glad how you doing buddy cousin i like that you like that um you know that what really
amazes me about these people niel is and you really hit it right on the head is all it is is a radio show
i mean what what is everybody getting so they got the easiest job in the world they got to sit at
home and listen if they don't like it hey cruise over the winds hit the quam jam with merlin
jam with quam that's it hey listen they might pick up on it you might get some early jam with quam
that's not too bad you know i mean what's so hard and all they do i mean these people are nothing but
hypocritical self-righteous douchebag yeah and then they think they think they will amaze me as they'll
call one host and they'll tinkle all over them and rip somebody else then like in a half hour later
and i've actually heard this half hour later you hear them on the show of the person that they
were ripping doing just the opposite because they want to hear the sound of their own voice on the
radio yeah they've got like an incredible yearning to listen to a show you're in
yeah you know what i mean yeah they yearn to listen to something they hate it doesn't make sense
well good luck to them sir trust me they're all out there everyone even signs listen to you right now
i want to run a topic by you for the hell of it okay David Brinkley yeah okay i mean i'm not
going to usually bash the older people but this guy is like he deserves to be off the air wouldn't
well david died ten years ago but he's still you know considering that he's still doing pretty well
i like i like david brinkley but quite frankly you're right he's he ought to be he seems a little
female he ought to be in retirement counting his money and having a good time but he just he's
like martin aggransky that martin was on until his last tooth fell out and then they finally sent
martin out to the pastor you know i was watching the guy during the elections and uh i'm getting
like fog around my eyes watching him and his eyes are red and he's blanking and his skin's washed out
well they're gonna they're gonna uh NBC is looks terrible NBC's gonna hire back they're gonna
put him on with michael gillin and uh water chronis and they'll have winking blinkin and nod
together again man some bull listen have a wonderful day and we'll tell you a good life all right we'll
tell david you said hi take care okay i like david brinkley but he's right david should have
retired a few years ago there's it's like in baseball you know stand musil hung around too long
Ted Williams knew when to quit all right he quit when he was on top stand musil hung around too
long it was embarrassing because it was a shadow of his former self and he just it was became
pathetic watching a formerly great player trying to go out there and hit he just couldn't do it
and i see so there are some you know like do caucus he's not running again for governor he knows
he's a bomb and uh he realized he made an absolute fool out of himself and uh he's you know he's not
gonna run for president again he just has to say that as a good excuse for why he's not running
for governor again probably because he's afraid he's gonna lose anyway although he did carry
Massachusetts not by a lot oh we have a radio celebrity on seven hello Neil yes how you doing
okay it's mark marzli hey mark i got a classic old bag story for you i mean this one we'll put
blue hair on your chest right to president uh my any hello hello my daughter yes okay like uh
if you invite somebody to your house oh you buy somebody into your house and you find that you
don't like them that you dislike them would you invite them back again no no would you invite them
back and tell them how much you dislike them no why didn't all the people just turn the radio on
a different side i thought i'd said it maybe i somehow long line misted but no but you know what i'm
saying now i see the bottom line is they love it but they don't want to admit it see they love
it in a perverse way because they love to hate or whatever kick it is that they just there's
something there that they can't live without but they don't want to admit that so they have to
keep going through this big herang and they they feel once they do that it lets them off the hook
you know it's it's almost like a guilt trip but as long as they say that they hate me then it makes
them feel better and it's some kind of an excuse for them listening they could sleep better in my
pro it's like this the bag that Steve had on for a half hour yesterday was going on about well she
has to do a research you know yeah she's doing research we got a research with anyway uh i got a problem
i do my problem is i can't turn it off mm-hmm because i like it so i want to tell you so you
have a good question but okay bye it is a phenomenon they they hate you they despise me more
well you know i i um had this interview the fact the uh AP photographer the young lady was in here
this morning and they did a thing with some talk host around the country because this movie is
coming out mm-hmm talk radio which i thought was the topic of yesterday's show but nobody has seen it
but anyway and she was asking me all these different questions she was very nice from the Dallas
newspaper and um and i told her i said that you know there are the ones who hate you the most are
likely to be there every single day they're the most loyal listener and we just shocked you
couldn't understand that we don't understand it either but it's true it's a fact now who whose
message is this there was only a handful of anti-neil and bird call is that your message because
i heard the entire program and if you're going to try to sell me that uh you can go sell a Brooklyn
bridge to my Disney okay because you're dreaming i heard every single call on the entire show
from the time i went yeah a little yeah i think more like the john homeschool
this man is just dreaming it's uh 18 past 11 at w-i-o-d for waterdale hello hi how you doing Neil
great i just want to let you know i got my tape and by the way nick is right about one thing he's not
right about much but that amateur psychology has got to go on at you yeah hey i'm 22 and i used to
listen to you over on uh Zeta really and uh and pervert i mean convert yeah well we get a lot of
those perverts and uh you know i uh i won't miss a day how about that great all right well thanks a lot
new have a wonderful life bye okay it's another one of our young morons uh they're not going to mean
that seriously i don't want to you know offend him but i mean just in them yeah in the words of some
of those listeners yesterday i just a bunch of idiots young big heads uh uh you know get your
way teana out in your effort and and have a wonderful day and go out and sit around a pool and
to talk about ancd's operation and do something useful okay but get out of my life while you miserable
nasty old farts or is it prunes i forget it i don't want to steal anybody else's material okay we
do have an open-line in date if you move quickly now 751 w-i-o-d 751-9463 anti something on four well
that's good hello hello yes who is this who are you calling i'm calling my disney oh well this
is not my disney this is near Rogers well i certainly don't want to speak with Neil Rogers
well that's great calling my disney to complain about you oh in other words you can't just turn it off
you have to make it complaint is that what you're saying i have it said on w-i-o-d to make me up in
the morning let me say this i know that that that's that's wonderful that's wonderful but it
ten o'clock if you don't like this show you can change the dial we are going to substitute another
program of your choice it's not like it's not no we're not it's not like going into a Chinese
restaurant one from column a are entirely disgusting absolutely that's right you know something let
let me make you an invitation okay to go away no no you you're not listening though you said
i wasn't listening to you let oh there she goes she just another wonderful and that that was
that was the quintessential call all four hours of that yesterday afternoon okay now you can go
ahead and call my disney but i got news for you he ain't going to take the call he's not going to
bother with you bill wise might take the call but unlikely that probably take a message they're
not interested lady don't you understand if you enjoy mic in the morning great he's got an
enormous audience as i said before but this i this frozen dial syndrome doesn't sell okay just
doesn't play the idea that you set the dial you don't set a radio dial like you set a clock
you don't you know like a big clock you have one of those big old time clocks and you set them
with a little you don't have to set your radio i know it comes in the shot but you can just reach
over and turn that dial and twist it all around or twist whatever you want ma'am okay
so i think is really what your problem is that's what i love now why would some moron be calling
for mic disney on a talk show okay shouldn't that be very obvious to you man that by calling the
talk show you're not going to get to the general manager at anybody in management okay
so you can take your complaint and you can stick it where the moondone shine okay lady go away
and don't give me this pretend you know she's obviously listening oh yeah wow but did you know
there's another hit and run artist too she couldn't handle it because she had no comeback when i
asked her why it is that she couldn't change the state no no we've had this before that is not
an acceptable solution did you notice that is no solution you can change the station oh see that's
that's the argument they have got to use for the fact you know to cover up the fact that they're
so embarrassing i mean can you can you ever imagine you know flip it across on the cable
on tv coming across the show and of course let's face it every day there are hundreds of shows
that you just despised if you would never watch but instead of continuing to flip the dial
stopping picking up the phone getting the phone number making the effort to call in and tell them
i don't like that show i want you to take it away i want you to put something on that i like
that's what it is i would tell you the men and the white coats would be at your door is so fast
that you would know whether to scream or reach your key to you know what i'm saying mobile
is this a car phone or is this a joke no this is a mobile okay that's what i thought i said
how you're doing is it real yeah first of all i like to say god forbid people if you don't like
the show don't call don't listen second of all i like to have a great show i love the bird i love
his laugh great okay another thing i like to say is that the cute big car wash over there on
Hollywood for for one yard bunch of dish bags their rude i like what's that great call all right
have a nice day and a good life and a good time 23 past 11 a w idea interrupted myself in mid-sentence
because i have that mobile phone syndrome you know i see car phone on there and i don't want these
poor suckers to have to run up a big bill or hang up or you know i did just went right to that it
was worth it though he's a good guy just a little overwrought they probably ripped his uh
car antenna off or something minor like that or his phone antenna anyway this Sunday boy a lot of
people gonna be out there and love new from your phony company it's yelling and it's cheaper than calling
hey bill i'm the wife and kids pretty good Sam you and Laura want to come over for dinner tonight
sure okay i'll get back to you with yelling you get the same convenient features as calling
like yell waiting i just a minute friend my boss is yelling at me oh
David she got that contract ready for tomorrow morning yeah yeah sir i do try yelling new from your
phony company yell at our toll free number for more information of course it's cheaper to yell
after seven p.m a three-minute yell from sunrise over to tamrak costs only a dollar but you may
have trouble getting through during peak yelling hours
if the new easy choice from your phony company yelling yell out to someone you love today
yell at our toll free number for more information
okay joe wonderfully followers got that service huh what do you think
Lee is the only guy in america doesn't need a phone he's true he doesn't have a phone all he does
is open to window and even when he calls like steve and david county he's living in
pumping no problem no problem in all 1128 at w i o d let's go to my emmy hello
hey good morning nil when is this good morning glad hi hey nil i i waited a long time to hear
free winds pick it again it was great yeah i'm fact i got the uh just said right here if we ever
had a place to dub this stuff i'd have it on card i take it i take it oh yeah i had a couple
of years back because i started listening to you uh back in april of eighty seven i have it
to show and uh one thing a couple of things i don't understand you know one how can this guy
to call yesterday on steve show he was in his 20s oh yeah the one i liked Alan Burke uh you know
i i got nausea it's always got to be one sir i got so nausea it's always got to be one but you
know when you look at the democrat here in the last trend we were number one in eighteen to three
of four which is mind-boggling for talk show and Alan if he had like four people under a hungry
listening to a show as a miracle so it it goes to show you need degree to which all the
vultures out there perceive this as an opportunity to rip me so and i hear here was the one kid
twenty who's a moron who's an old fart but he's only twenty who loved out because he loved
those guests you Alan had some real uplifting guests on his show like uh like dr. vatsyn or whatever
is name one i got one more thing that burned me up when i heard it and i don't get a chance to call
i'm getting ready to go to work now i got to ride my tenth beat over to the beach oh yeah um i
work with pantyprize anyway oh yeah yeah you're probably see me over there because i'm
lady i was on forty first street yesterday pantyprize now i went over to bauho i shopped there all
the time i grab all the way from plantations little have any supermarkets and rower try to grab
all the way from plantation to four you just so i can run to that lady well i didn't see you there
yesterday anyway i was there you got a letter a couple weeks back and it really just burned me to
pieces from the out of mwalshbound oh yeah nice folks okay i've never missed a show i listened to
you while i'm a work or whatever and you know what i keep hearing these letters people saying you
uh made passes or tried to bring you know bringing young boys over the airways never hailing
trolling for boys on either so let's get it never happen it's never happening never gonna happen
and anything that's in the humor there are those who would like to twist and manipulate only
because of their terminal homophobia and their bigotry and they're not fooling anybody intelligent
i mean when the only people they can fool are the ones who have never even heard the show
then what does that tell you and i'm not an idiot i just finished my first semester of college
and i did very well i got all these excellent and uh Neil this is the guy that used to call you
from work release i think you know oh yeah yeah that's great but i finished my first and i go to
Miami christian college wow believe it or not how do i love you show never miss it you've never
say anything to offend me and uh you know them people i don't uh they can't shut it off trust me
they can't oh i know and i love the laugh go ahead and put up okay you guys have a good day bye bye
1131 at w1 out d we have a couple of open lines now a little crisis here on the show one in day
and one in brown we have uh no date i guess seven to five one nine four six three should give them a
lot more slowly so that those intelligent people like the sooner we'd like to a woman new ones
mic disney because she wants to complain about my show because we're gonna take this show off and
put something on the chelice okay dropped it hmm for i'll tell you we have just it it's like
you know we went along there at fm and we had you know our moments here i mean it was not a better
roses especially last few months working for those people over there but the car is by and large
we didn't have nearly as much of this am i right i mean not nearly as much of this most of the people
seem pretty happy you know pretty happy campers yeah but when you get back on a m again one of the
uh liabillonies is you have these frozen dial a m old farts but you can't turn the dial because
the dentures keep getting in the way well obviously something is preventing it because not a
solution although we don't want to bash those old people because we don't want to get a reputation
i don't forget steve is going to be a doing condo kid part two this afternoon i just mentioned that
in passing even though he does not attack prunes or old farts or people who are barbaric in their
behavior and treat young people like cattle he does not do that eleven thirty two
i just can't believe it i just can't believe it i thought we were given them a solution
changed the channel but obviously that doesn't hold no don't you understand her dial is set
it doesn't work her dial is set on six ten she gets up to it so therefore whenever you wake up
you i don't think she actually moves i think the bed is right next to the phone i forgot you
i don't think she can move far enough to reach the radio dial it is probably the problem and now in
that case i we do have a crisis i do understand for those of you who've done now what we might do is
we might send spike on spike just kind of hangs out he not doing too much and we'll send him out to the
homes of people who cannot reach their radio is to change the dial create and he will personally lock
it in any other station of your choice only problem is uh he's going to have to come back in the
morning because then you want to hear mike yeah so he'll come back around five fifteen
and he'll have it a paper out you know and he'll make the rounds and he'll just change your dial
and everything will be fine okay you expect to see him two three times and maybe give him a
little lunch on toyota of hollywood steven are going to be there a week from the Saturday that
ought to be a real picnic okay i'll bring the and you said it eleven thirty six at w i o d and our
next call is another mobile hello hi i want you to know okay okay listen i've been listening to
you for a very long time uh... am i back to am and i think i have a solution for this for ladies
the dial is stock i i find it's very easy to get the dial on stock which is usually take a cup
of uh... prun juice yeah uh... two and a half of metamusell just throw it up room good you drink it
that moves you and you have to run away from the radio you have to listen to what's going
i want to tell you something that you may have just done her the greatest
to be a senator because i don't think she's had a bm in at least twenty years okay that's probably
what it is you get very uptight when you have that pressure that pressure is terrible yeah it'll get to

to mention this a roman did another public service for me because by
that name which made me think of days of our lives
holly is back on the guiding light now that doesn't mean anything to anybody except those of us
who are ancient okay holly was one of the characters in the early years for many years she was
ed bowler's girlfriend okay i think they were married at one time i don't remember
how it powers girlfriend all you know it born no well anyway uh... and all of a sudden they brought
the same actress back she's been off that show for years and years did you ever watch guiding light
you'll end never watch the shame on you i know you've been here all the time yeah
little tv in here i'm telling you to enrich your life tremendously but anyway uh... holly was one of
the no see i used to when i was in high school i lived right up the block from the school so i'd
come home every day for lunch at about twelve thirty and that was when the soap operas were all fifteen
minutes and that's a long time ago okay that's almost thirty years ago she looks pretty good for
uh... you know middle-aged lady okay she got to be in her fifties easy and um... she's back
wow and it's so rare that they bring back the same actor or actress in you know in a role she came
back to town you know that's a storyline and it's shocking but you're obviously very
moved i'm sure that there are some soap opera groupies out there in this audience who can relate
to it who know i'm talking about and are just uh... incredible all here's another hate call hello
hello uh... not didn't have the guts to do it
i'll be damn well that was her again the same one now why is she calling this number lady please

start squeezing the back she's squeezing the back down the tuba is like it's going all over the floor
if you're gonna have a really productive uh... prune juice and a month the tuba's got to go into
proper place okay and you should have no trouble finding it it's eleven forty a double i of the
and let's go to beautiful belglaid hello good morning you want to stay as somebody go how you doing

news is that uh... bill wise is i he just left he's got a bag of sandwiches under his arm and he's
making his rounds he's gonna be switching those dials and then tomorrow morning he'll be there at
about five fifteen to get him all back on again for uncle might well i think you know what they
didn't want to listen to you what they use it was probably watch television now they switch on
where her all though used to be and they're getting the macramate channel or something because
of what i like the macramate channel that's one of my favorite well they're going into a panic
you know for the life it was a his turn back and since the radio is from the matter fact the other
day they were macramating something i didn't like and i looked up the phone number and i
directed it i called him i don't like that it looks disgusting i want you to do it in pink
fine well up here in Palm Beach county at least they're getting a more choice because the
the local folks show up here just announced their new lineup today oh boy i can't wait for this

scared it sounds like real stiff competitions long as real glad that out here in buglay we can pick
your station up we can't pick up j and really well you know that thousand watts and that
rotted out ground system on at a m tower out there in the lake it's kind of rough you know but
lead talks loud enough he don't need a trasmus i feel like i'm like a hero now it's gonna be kind
of difficult yeah we can hear the lead followers show from noon to three without a radio up there
in buglay don't could show be even pohoki lia's big and pohoki well what do they do is i
had newly to blow off air rates so i was not always put leo on and if you've heard the way

have a great day get to by he sounded that was a little leaf followers laugh there that wasn't it
now we know i missed your father doesn't call us anymore because he's gonna be a competitor
starting on one day oh god god but my pressure when i think of those days when he was on there with
his twos on w's twos on snooze that used to be the theme of the station twos on snooze on the leaf
followers show once in a while ones but mostly twos he's pretty consistent i got i got to do
i just i got to do it i know it lee what do you think this is for you lee
l n box was a normal man with a wife children a summer home in opalaka and a chain of radio stations
well normal that is until just three weeks ago hi honey how was your day un believable
terminal there's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there l n box is suffering from
neal roger's disease have you canceled the Miami herald yet but honey we don't subscribe to the
herald oh now that's a cop out what kind of a lame excuse is that just they know to l herald sir huh
people afflicted with neal roger's disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings
what's the matter with you blue herald bags from fembroke pines you know the yin feds who say
all nil how can you say those nasty things running around stealing sweet and low

congratulate lee and then is colons for the incredible job they did with w g b s and w n w s man they
took two incredible facilities and turned them into parking lots in no time okay we have an open
line in palm beach wouldn't you know i just by coincidence i don't think he's going to be calling us
but that that evidently is part of the reason that we will not be hearing again from mr fallor
on the show is that he's now going to be the competition you know i saw a was over a gtr yesterday
you know how long jeff charles is going to last on your i'm sorry but i just you know it's
you know how long he's going to last over there by five minutes can't believe you got a job you
were a gtr yeah and they have a gvs coffee cup over there see you're talking now and that's bad
because you don't contribute anything to the show i was cackel like a hyena and a moron you never
say anything i see oh that's why the confusion yeah well i thought i would try you know i have
a mincecote hot life even more today because it seems to upset them much more the more i laugh
about working on that what is this message uh oh roger thorp
oh from guiding light oh roger he's not on there anymore is he
when he's wife one called and want to know who is roger thorp roger was holly's uh
boyfriend one of them years and years ago and he was a really bad guy he was like a gangster type
and he kidnapped her something i don't remember but that's that's all a long time ago but holly
was on air forever boy she was on a show with ed forever and ever in fact no they were married
that was ed's first wife and he got divorced and they had a little girl who is now Glenn close
plays the daughter what are you talking about Glenn close is in the show no yes
was is in the show now are you talking that's not possible okay uh if that if that is not
Glenn close then my name is roger thorp well i have to replace Christina she's a movie star
didn't Joan Crawford get in soap operas yeah but uh what they leave to do movies they don't
stand you don't understand it's probably it's a temporary thing it's one of these
campalianno deals you know for a short period of time i'm telling you it's her that's amazing
that's her hair is like blonde dish now but it's her i'm somebody we'll call it okay is that
Glenn close or not all right that's i'm very good she's in guiding light okay and that's one of the
things they do to try to get you know how competitive that's become now to try to get big numbers
i see good the big battle air is general hospital in fact didn't general hospital have rick spring
field on for a long time sure and Richard Simmons was on that show was he yes remember that long
time ago he was on that show well you just you know i don't even watch him here okay i'm not i'm not
i watch i watch guiding light on the days when alan michael is on a show because he's kind of an
interesting guy but you know but i don't really watch so same or used to years ago when i worked
at night because when you're home in the daytime there's nothing else to watch i don't know
michael's was on that show no alan michael alan michael so gay alan michael's isn't on any
show and that's a way it ought to be okay well you're in an area new show called crank for your life
i don't know soap opera so you're in an area you're right i had nothing about this area so i
shouldn't challenge okay so so see the audience you know nothing about sports you dislike most
sports you know nothing about soaps you did not see the Karen Carpenter stir it up i'm a mess
you're a wreck you're a wreck you really are you need to start the reorganizing your whole life just
to satisfy that segment of the audience out there that hates your guts boy do they ever
boy and the thing about that they despise the most is that a lot of the stuff i say isn't funny at
all i mean you continue to see there you go cackling hysterically well and if they don't like it
they can drop dead okay that's what he did that's him he can't help himself all right he was born
with a little somewhere up in his brain there's a little thing and he just keeps cackling
can see you know there was a little egg in the family many years ago i don't want to get young
knee allowed to have to play the whole thing but when the egg hatch there was a little mental
thing there that had to do with cackling and gurgling sounds and well i don't know you're funny to
me i don't know that i don't think i should apologize even though i'm a terrible guy and i hate
full person oh yeah oh boy does that give me when they start that that psychoanalysis man when
they starting with that amateur analization of everybody and everything and they've got any
idea what they're talking about and of course when we were at zeta and on those rare opportunities
when i would tune in and amazingly enough most of the time when i would tune in the afternoon here
i was the subject of conversation even when they were guests i'd be the conversation and i
would keep hearing steve saying oh you know he's such a non-happy person he doesn't have any
life and about and except for a casual meeting at a chinese restaurant a couple of years ago
standing i were up there and steve and his wife were there except for that i hadn't seen this man
in years or had any contact with him and he had somehow he knew that i was this terrible unhappy
first course now that i have come here i'm a happy person because that now i have the honor of
being trashed by steves listeners for four hours in the afternoon okay it's eleven fifty it's ten
till noon uh w i o d and we'll be right back eleven fifty two now is that the message is that this
fallen bokeh oh they hung up they disappear they flew away another hit right on the devil
that's right when my ball spot finishes uh disappearing up there will be six six six six underneath this
i'll look at poor Cheryl man she hasn't eaten all week long what is it Thursday boy she ran out of
here uh Cheryl hasn't been eating this week i know her mother listened to the show and i want to tell
you something seriously uh this daughter of yours she's got to start eating now i saw that
carrying carpenter movie on sunday i'm serious she's got the same syndrome she is getting so gone
and uh she's got to do something about it you have to start eating a little bit and i realize i've
been on this diet i've got another three four months to go then we'll start bringing in the food
there will be a lot of pressing going on in the building and we'll get you back to a normal side
but she's just emaciated and i know her mom listens and is very concerned about her yeah and
justifiably so she is just a shadow we've only been here a couple of months she's a shadow
over a former cell that's okay eat my child eat that's right it's and Fred
bokeh hello let me say it again did i not say it correctly bokeh is gone okay that's probably just
as well yeah oakland park hello yeah i know how i like it great uh i i was gonna tell you i have a beef
i was at pompinolestine i love betting on the harness uh race and i have six to five shot with
bruise ranger on the rail were you there last night yeah i had the horse too and he got locked in
behind a dead horse what about that that's racing what was he waiting for to go past that horse
well first of all if he pulled he wasn't gonna get past the horse anyway i mean i would like to
have seen him pull because i had to one horse too but um he didn't have the horse to get out
that's the reason he didn't pull in the backstretch he'd have been out in the air he'd have been
right where he finished anyway nowhere but the race went in 59 and one and the one horse if you
noticed the two was the horse didn't have much of a driver but he got to lead and if you if you
look at his lines about i don't want to board the audience but he was the best in the race and he
paid a hell of a price and we got we got sucked in there on a stiff yeah i get it's true and if you
notice that one horse i don't want to sound like i've got it in my brain but he only one one
one horse one race in his life oh yeah they were they were all dogs but the reason we all got
sucked into it is because McDonald had been driving it and now Bruce Ranger was on it but Bruce
has had a rough couple of days yeah okay but he'll be he'll be back why feel a little better about it
hey listen misery loves company we all plunged our brains out and tonight will be another night
okay okay
he did feel better now he does feel better and no i didn't have the same horse and uh he got locked
in behind a dead horse but if like i said if he'd have pulled forget it uh it had been all over
from fifty five at wio d and uh those lines are sizzling today boy they are flashing and we know
we got a nothing but a bunch of ding bags and these bags of college show but that's the best we
can do okay we're doing the best we can't know listen we can't all have these high pollutant
intellectual shows were all the geniuses calling all the mouth-free the book is back hello
what happened what happened i'm working and i have to make some calls oh listen hey listen you know
it's a question of priorities now you know this show is a lot more important to you than that job
anybody can get another job you can but you don't come over pay my bill well spike listen when
spike comes over to adjust when listen amnesia when spike comes over to adjust your radio tomorrow morning
hopefully bring it check because everybody in the world's on a payroll here so there's one more
will make it a different time is he coming over by five fifteen five five five five five five five
I'll leave the door open in case they were once robbed me doing the night okay listen listen to that
I read a rolling stone yeah are you are you reading rolling stone or smoking it sir
right it's about good enough to use for kindling wood nowadays but uh singer Bobby McFarren
is reading a book based on a hit song don't worry me happy do they give the name of it
no but what i think is going to happen is now when you see the commercials on channel four they're
going to offer the book with it because people understand their little stupid hey listen i want
to tell you the best way you know the there are all different versions of the spot and there are
a few different ones but the the main spot where Betty White is in there and all is there
the fun way to do that is mute the TV turn the sound down and watch it with the sound off and
you will you will swear that you've lost your mind you'll swear that you've gone you know on a
spaceship to another planet and you that the compilation one have you seen that one with every
single person that they've had and they all mouse the words to the song yeah that's the one yeah
that's the one oh yeah do you mean you've only seen it once that's the first time i saw it
well you must be living a real shelter like i see it when the set isn't even on
huh and in the end i know Tom said that they told him a bunch of things yesterday but i got news
for it boy they're they're running like to a break again every chance they get they're running
two in the same break and just enough to make you vomit and then at night i see the two late
that the guy and the girl on their tiny what's coming on at night that's just this week
but oh that's just this week yeah they probably are a little upset that they have to stay so
late and do that yeah just like the people on the news they'd have to come back at two 30 in the
morning and do the news over again yeah yeah we're like so many people praying it for in the
morning i couldn't believe they were still marching and they won't let him do any updates either
they make him read the same damn stinkin old news that they read at 11 30 and they're pretty
picked as Sally said she's gonna uh revolt about it and make the same uh flow Sally is pretty
holding out that you know can i have to use some advice new yes sir this is the show for advice
and psychological counseling and amateur psychology you came to the right show people that
i tend to meet life that i respect a lot i'm a young guy yeah i've always said to me that
that people in this life or in this world really aren't worth you know they're not worth
getting upset about or they're they're not worth having uh problems with it do you find that to be true
i don't i don't understand me you can make that blanket statement but in other words if you're
going to worry about what do the people think that's definitely true to how with other people if
they don't like you tell them to drop right on just don't worry don't live your life for other
people right trust me and the problem that's piece of amateur psychology i can give you thank you
and the problem that i think when people are calling any complaining about your show if they don't
have a problem with you they really have a problem with themselves that is correct very very unhappy
people in their life very unhappy their lives are so unfulfilled and there's really nothing exciting
going on that they have to uh become like these honest listeners and get involved in something
they have no control yeah we have somebody in a building i'm not going to mention her name but we
have somebody in a building who fits right in that category of very unhappy person unfortunately
and she takes it out and everybody else yeah they they just we understand that so we just kind
of laugh and ignore it and listen have a great day i got to run i know more material okay
hi okay that was perfect you ran out of my room just as we ran out of time so our audience
maybe a bunch of dingbats and morons but they their timing is excellent okay uh April is here
i believe we got our lunch from floris and uh we're just tickled to death in fact that we're
discussing is uh Cheryl was just in here and i've been mentioning the fact that she wasn't eating
and the bird tried to slip her a little bit of his salami and um she said i'll pass down
everyone having any of it so she wouldn't have any part of it
i think he's the famous in his test i think muscle pain is red

way too tight hoping that he'll still big tonight he keeps his briefcase in his lab for else you know

Oh, you're eating on the air again.
Oh.
Call 09 at WIOD. We have an open line in Bokeh. Just lettuce, but lettuce makes some good
noise. You know what it does? God, is that make good noise. That Bokeh number 278-9463-278-WIOD,
just in case. I don't forget Steve this afternoon has Condo, the Condo Kid Part 2, and Janie
Swartz, the nine-year-old girl, being kicked out of Viewpoint Condo's and her stepfather
and mother, Marcy Esposito, Norm Kravitz, who are running for the Viewpoint Board of Directors
on a compassionate slate. And I don't think that the other side, Ogi and that group, I
think they're showing up. I think they're chickened out, yeah.
So anyway, those of you who are disgusted with the behavior of those pros and old farts
at the Viewpoint Condo's, the update is coming up this afternoon and they're having a big
meeting on it tonight. Hopefully we'll resolve some of this. And put an end to this barbaric
behavior. Okay, Miami, hello. Hey Neil, how you doing?
Great. Hello, Glenn. Hi. I just want to tell you a true horse story that happened a couple
of years ago. You remember Youngcrasse Raceway? Have you ever been up there? Yeah, I've been there.
All right, there's a horse up there that goes back 1970. The horse's name is Captain Dean.
Dellens goes driving him in the stretch. My friends got about $100 on the nose to win.
The horse comes to within, I'm going to say a hundred yards or maybe a hundred feet
of the finish line and dies dropped dead. Yeah. All right. I've seen that. It happened. I was with
the guy next day. Now if you remember in the older days before they had to computerize
totes, they used to have wind plays and show windows, $50. Yeah, you have to go to one window.
He goes to the window to the next race. He's really destroyed. He says, I want $100 to win on the
four. The guy looks at me and says to win, he says no to live.
True story. I got news for I've been on a few including a couple last night. I don't think they made it.
Well, they're still running, right? Yeah. He also said to me very famous words. I'm going to the
track today. I said, good luck. I hope you win. He says, not I just want to break out even. I could
use the money. Yeah. Very well put. Have a good lunch. I'm at a material and enjoy. Have a great
life. 11 past noon at W.I.D. All right, here comes the moment ladies and gentlemen that
have been waiting for all of your lives. Probably a lot of people eating lunch now. Sure.
Sure. And lunch is not complete without your teeth and a glass.
Maybe another tablet. That was pretty good for a start. Maybe a two tablet.
Okay. Now this is for those of you shleppers out there that can't even afford your own
effort. And what we're going to do every day is a public service of W.I.O.D. We're going to be
dropping these tablets in a fizzing glass. And if you hold your teeth close to the radio
by the end of 30 seconds, man, they will be like whisker clean. Okay. Trust me. Here we go.
Nothing.
Oh, does that smell good? You know what smells like peppermint? Does it? Is this peppermint
flavorment, effort and yeah? Boy, that's good enough to drink. Want some rich?
Well, I'm telling you, if this does to your insides, what a cadoodie or teeth man,
this is better than a barium animal, isn't it? Wow. 1239 at W.I.O.D. here's good old Chuckie
indeed. Hello. How you doing, Neil? Okay, Chuckie. You see how I call and defend it. You guys
yesterday. I knew you're going to say that, but let me just say this to you. You know,
we shouldn't have to be defended because the entire discussion shouldn't take place in the first
place. Really? I'm going to I'm going to invent some kind of electronic contraption that
will wipe W.I.O.D. off the dial for these old douche nozzles.
Well, evidently, they need some help because they just can't quite reach that radio boy.
They're trying desperately, but they just can't quite reach that darn. Yeah, it's like interference
from their wheelchairs or something. Yeah, from their walkers. Yeah, well, Neil anyway, listen,
I'll give you my phone number when you worry. Call me. I'll make you happy. Okay, Chuckie. Good
like. Okay, well, 1239 at W.I.O.D. there's no way. Oh boy, look at this speaking of chronic.
Hello. Eddie, hang up. Hello. Now. Yeah. How you doing? Who is this? You don't know me. I'm not
a chronic first time call, but it says Cox. Huh? It says, this ain't done Cox. Oh, oh man.
But anyway, while I get you, listen, I got one question for you. But first, there's more point
about this dialogue and discussion this morning. You said it. The call said it afterwards. If they
don't like the damn program, turn it on. Yeah, get a life and find something else to do. That's
right. Unbelievable. Listen, quick question. I'll let you go. I'm going to do some gambling.
I'm feeling plunged in this weekend. I'm going out on the boat. First time. Okay. Now,
buddy, tell me blackjack. The best shake for my money. No. I found the other day. There's a new
game out there called Caribbean poker that paying two to one. You know, I don't know anything about
poker and I don't like blackjack. I like roulette. I love the slots, but that's a sucker, but you're
never going to win on that. But the roulette's pretty good. If you got patience and you sit there and
you get a little lucky and you know when to get up and walk away, roulette, you got a good shot.
That's the number one. No one any game one. No one to leave. No one to fall, but my
Kenny's address. That's correct. Okay, Neil. I'm out in the material. Okay.
Good one. Winner's theus. Good luck to you. 1246 and WIOD and Openline in Palm Beach. If you're
really hurry now. 655-946-3-655 WIOD. Ocox is on seven.
I am iconic now.
David. An understatement. Hey, guys.
We've been out here.
Don O'Brien.
Yeah, really?
Hey, Neil.
Listen, we've done O'Brien.
Why are you shouting?
I see Caleb over here.
Why are you?
No, not you, him. He's shouting now.
He's got Lee Fowler to see.
Yeah, well, Neil.
As soon as we put constant, every line was lit up. All three day lines just went out at the same time.
We had every line in the board lit. We put this guy on. Every line in day just went out.
Well, I have that effect on people.
Maybe Neil, I have an idea for your old folks.
Have them tune to me for one afternoon. I'll give them some audio adjustment.
Yeah.
I'll rattle their brain.
They can't listen to F-M, unfortunately.
They don't know how to switch the band.
They can't even switch from one station on A-M to another.
They can switch the band.
You're really great.
Yeah, that's true.
Well, I thought if we could give them like a little hour of power therapy, you know?
Yeah, they need an hour of...
They need to power animals what they need.
Well, there's something people would think that that's what happens when you listen to us.
And...
And...
Anyway, I just thought it'd be fun if we had them tune over and rattle their brain for an hour or two.
Right. Well, I'm sure that my friends next door at GTR will be just delighted
by inviting everybody to listen to Power N-E-Six and feel that we just love them.
Listen, make me an Arminer, alright?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, they're not any problems.
You know that they're on tape.
They've never been here since we came here. They're both on tape.
Well, maybe that's part of Spike's idea of how to do that, you know?
Yeah, that's Spike Boy. He's in your fact.
He was here today for a couple of minutes.
I hope he saw the building.
Yeah, saw him.
No, I just have to have lunch.
You know, and it starts about 9.30.
And it ends about 4.30 and then they come in and they gotta go and coffee break and they...
Okay, Don, well, listen, it's here been a lot of fun.
Nice talking to you, Neil.
Bye.
12.48 at WIOD.
We have both the Palm Beach lines open.
Now it's true. As soon as he came on air, boy, the lines emptied out like there was a
bubonic plague on air.
And nothing personal, Don, it just the way they emptied.
Open line in Boca, 278 WIOD.
And in Palm Beach, 655 WIOD.
I guess the Marving Friday probably would be the last day.
We will be speaking in these hours through a lot of people in Palm Beach.
Because we, be it on Noon to 3, we can't handle that.
In fact, if you miss, good.
And you live in North Broward or Palm Beach and you can pick up J&O.
You can be able to tune over there immediately at Noon.
And you'll probably hear most of it repeated on the leaf hauler show from Noon to 3.
So it'd be a good way for you to catch up on what's going on here.
Toyota of Hollywood would like to invite you to come back.
The company too at WIOD got a mobile in date.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
How's the bird?
Okay.
That's good.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
I know.
They still try to be number three.
No, they're trying to be number 33, sir.
Thirty.
I think when the book comes out next Tuesday,
I think they're going to be getting real close.
Well, if they don't make it, I have just the person they can bring in.
And they'll just put them right where they should be.
Yeah.
Big Wilson.
Oh, that'll do it.
Okay.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know why no one else has grabbed him up in this market.
Even J&O has got the other three biggies.
Yeah, they got the title lineup now, boy.
Between Mike Miller and DeLie and Jeff Charles.
Why don't think we can handle that?
Boy, I'll tell you, big Wilson is next, so that's it.
Mike Miller is pretty sure he's doing a poll on which soda is your drinker.
That's, uh, that should be good.
And Lee Fowler will follow it up to see if the poll would come.
Yeah.
And then Mike's going to do a petition drive to get
National Hockey League team in West Palm Beach.
All right.
That's too much.
That they're really going to do well up there.
I'm sure.
Yeah, they're going to, uh, they're going to kick some serious ass up there.
You can be sure of that.
Let me, let me, let me, let me.
And would you have Charles working up there?
If nothing else, at least find out where the good drug supply is in Palm Beach County.
Well, I don't take some of the pressure off of Dave and Broward.
Yeah.
That's for sure.
Let me tell you about the contrived debates that Steve Kane always had.
No, I don't, sir.
I don't want to do that.
You really don't want to do it?
Not at all.
No, I don't.
I really don't want to do it.
I'm not going to do it.
And we've gotten almost three hours without doing it.
And I'm just not going to return in kind what I heard yesterday.
Because it's Bush League.
It just doesn't have any place, but have a wonderful day.
1254 at WIOD.
We have an open line in date at 7519463.
Bokeh, hello.
Nail Bird.
Yeah.
I'm a long, I'll ask them.
This is a high-go to your Armenian.
And I just want to tell you that those people.
What the hell is that?
What are your Armenians saying?
Shalom, I'll ask them.
What is this all about?
I have a couple of friends that are here.
Okay.
Those people out there, those douchebags,
who were picking on you yesterday,
made her blood turn to whiskey,
so that 100 bed bugs get drunk on me.
No, don't say picking on me.
That sounds rather true.
And they have some mizurka in their belly button.
And they made her enemies get cramped in their legs
while they dance on their graves.
May a child be named after them soon.
Yes.
And may your first child be a masculine child, sir.
It's 1254 at WIOD right down the middle of the board.
Just all empty down.
And they'd 7519463.
It's funny.
We were going along fine.
Don Cox called.
All of a sudden now we got a little problem here.
In Broward, you know, it was just so proper, lady.
And not a one-heter feel back.
Because I enjoyed her called tremendously.
And the amazing part of it is
she actually responded to something that I said.
Yeah.
Now that's a rarely.
See, another thing about these pseudo intellectuals,
who all you'll then bring up topics,
I used to do those heavy monologues.
And I go on for 35, 40 minutes to get my blood pressure up.
And the top of my head felt like it was going to blow off
from high blood pressure.
And I get all worked up to,
and you'd punch up the first call.
Oh, you know that Dr. Yahed and Leslie,
oh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah.
And that would be the first call.
It would get worse from there.
There would be nothing in any way, shape or form,
responding to what I said.
And it was the same on Z.
Remember, there would be those foolish days
when I would go on and rant and rave and pound on the table
once in a while just because I had something on my mind.
And the lines would all get lit up and you think,
boy, I really got these people going today.
And there would be not a single response.
So at least the lady talked about soap opera.
Maybe she bored a lot of you,
but at least she responded to something I mentioned, okay?
And she deserves several points for that.
That's true.
You know you're right.
Steve and his daughter.
And as somebody who knows the name of the daughter
that was Ed's first wife,
oh, and I know you're really excited about that.
Oh, yeah.
See, the reason I'm doing this now is
because you'll probably be begging us
to do an hour or two on Upstate New York tomorrow
by comparison.
And maybe even a couple of hours on sports.
Yeah.
Well, mobile in Boka.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Good afternoon, right?
Good you up there.
How are you doing?
I beg your pardon?
I say, how is things going for you?
Everything, it couldn't be better.
Right, that's wonderful.
We like hearing from happy people, sir.
Well, I got a lot of fun.
Why we don't get a lot of calls from Boka.
Yeah, Boka's a heck of a jam.
Let me know.
It is.
I know.
It's got those great strip shopping centers, man.
It's fantastic.
It's better than oral springs.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway, I have a little condo store,
if we, I think you'll get a kick out of it.
Yeah.
This is a famous condo called
Windmore Village.
Have you ever heard of it?
Oh, yeah.
Once or twice.
Yeah.
Once, didn't appearance there.
Yeah.
Good job.
Yeah.
And we had one demugs to give away.
Yeah.
WLNZ, one demugs.
I have a question for you.
They didn't, sir.
Let me just tell you the rest of the story.
Very briefly, they descended upon me
like I was giving away $100 bills.
I was going to ask you where I was going to attack.
And when the last one disappeared,
they disappeared just as rapidly as they had come.
It was like the birds in Alfred Hitchcock.
You know, they, all of a sudden, they all
descended and they disappeared.
And can I have a one demugged?
They didn't even know what they were.
But they knew they were free, sir.
And that's what was big at Windmore.
Anyway, this is a quick story.
My parents used to live over, not wonderful development.
And my father still works.
And he came back to the condo there one day from work.
And he went over to that community recreation area
with the community pool and the hot tub and this barn.
All that stuff.
The community and I'm a band-tie.
Yeah, whatever.
Well, anyway, he jumped into that hot tub.
And a woman ran over and said,
you have to get out of there immediately.
Because the sign on the wall says,
everyone must shower before they enter the hot tub.
And he said, well, you know something,
you're right, and I apologize.
Next time I come down here, I will be sure to shower.
And she stepped three steps into the hot tub.
And she said, if you don't get out now with shower,
I will urinate right into this hot tub.
Great.
Yeah, that's a true story.
And along with the whole, she did.
She urinated in the hot tub at Windmore.
And I hope she's listening.
Because lady, you're crazy.
And my parents moved out of there.
Just recently.
I'm glad they did.
I used to hate to go to the other room.
Now, let me ask you this question.
Was that enough to get him out?
Did he get out?
He was...
He probably warmed the water up a little more.
Yeah, he probably stayed in.
Who didn't get out?
How do you think they get those tubs hotter?
Windmore, sir.
I don't see the old lady's pee in the hot tub.
There you go.
I don't know.
Anyway, have a great day.
Burge a great, I love you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Why the story?
How come all these people seem to be satisfying?
No complaints.
No complaints.
They're not hostile toward you.
The only sourpuss we had was one old bag today
that called two different times for Mike Disney,
who is called the talk show line,
to speak to the general manager.
Other than that, everybody seems to be happy.
Oh, you know.
No complaints.
Those people never ever call you so many of them.
You know, they only...
You know that.
Oh, yeah.
They don't have the balls to stay in their face.
They've got to find that opening that I talked about.
And then, worm their way in there
and just rip the door open so that they can do their thing.
And if somebody invites them to do it,
they are.
Somebody orchestrates that
and gives them an opportunity to vent their spleen
in a short take advantage of the last time, especially.
Well listen, be that as it may.
Don't forget Steve has the Hurrod 106 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Palm Beach.
As we start our fourth and final hour
on a wonderful Thursday.
Just glad to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
Tickle to death.
Happy is a pig in stock.
And that Palm Beach number,
if you move real fast,
it's 655 WIOD.
655 946 330.
Oh, we have a list of guests that we have set up
for the next three months during the last break we decided.
We probably ought to have some very, very heavy guests.
Now, is the sink and float lady on that?
Sink and float lady.
The first one on the list,
you've been in the punch.
She was the first one on my list
was the sink and float lady.
That's what I'm interested in.
And if I could probably get a big tune in the audience
and win more, just the guy mentioned it just in the last hour.
I'll probably get a gigantic calling audience from win more.
Well, we have the sink and float question.
No question. No question.
Now we're going to be doing a show on brain surgery for seniors,
which is going to be very exciting.
That's coming up a week from Wednesday.
Let's start this hour and four,
Lauderdale. Hello.
Lauderdale.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
Listen, I was listening to you show this morning.
What I was wonderful, sir.
I was a little upset to hear how upset you were this morning.
Yeah.
But, uh,
but, uh,
I'm trying to be better.
Okay. You're trying to articulate, I understand.
I'm thinking up for you.
Yeah.
I get a little nervous when I speak.
You know, question.
A lot of pressure.
I just want you to know that you're the king.
You're number one.
You're the best.
And I don't think you should let these douchebags get you upset.
Okay, sir.
I'll take your advice.
107 and WIOD.
And enough butt licking already.
Okay. It's, uh,
Palm Beach is not there.
It goes.
It's,
Tinkos.
Well, you really can't tell for sure because you know how they ring
alternately.
No, they really do.
And I still haven't gotten used to that.
One day, I guess I will get used to that.
But they like flicker a little bit.
And then they stop.
In fact, Palm Beach, when Palm Beach stops,
it stops for good like now.
It flicker just a little bit.
And then it just stops.
Because a lot of the people when you're calling in Palm Beach
they're, you're not cold are you?
No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I can see my breath, but that's all right.
It's not distracting.
I just heard you laugh when I got your head.
It's so cold.
When I came in this morning,
do I look cold?
It was, and you know, I like it cold,
but he had it so cold that you could,
that water would have frozen.
That's on the table right there.
I mean, because I'm trembling a little bit,
do you get the impression?
I thought maybe it was those calls that did it to you.
It was.
That abuse.
Yeah.
And then,
okay, that's Palm Beach line.
Let me give the number one more time
because we never give up.
I don't know why we just never give up on it line.
655,
WIOD.
Four-larterdale.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Hi.
Have you heard about the Elvis contest
from the Royal Elbe Station in the Midwest?
No.
Oh, well, I thought Albee might be interested, you know?
They do it by...
Albee sure.
Yeah, I'll be sure.
Oh, yeah.
For sure.
They do it by, you know.
It's find the way you said Albee,
like it was one name.
Yeah.
Somehow Albee and Albee sure
seemed like two different places.
Albee seems like he might be from Milton, Florida.
Oh, that's...
Albee, Presley.
That's like a distant cousin.
All right.
Well, anyway, they do it by how you found
and how you looked.
That might be a problem for him.
And, you know,
and how you do the pelvis.
You know, the pelvis.
Yeah.
Okay, listen, I have a wonderful day
and all of that stuff.
Okay, 109 at WIOD.
You know, who's this note from?
That's from you.
And you're giving this to me like it's your serious?
I just spoke to him.
Steve said, well, what are you speaking for?
And what are you like the mediator now?
Steve said he stuck up for me on a show yesterday
did not hear the show this morning.
Well, the first part, the last part is neither here nor there.
But as I said, when you give people five and ten minutes
to bash and rehash and say basically the same thing over and over again
and rip people and then you say,
oh, but you know, and you defend it.
That's, uh, that doesn't do the job.
Here he comes.
He's walking down the hallway right now.
And it's just, I don't want to rehash it
because we did a whole traumatic first hour.
It's 10 minutes past one at WIOD.
We have an open line in Broward.
524-9463.
We had a couple of people today.
And they didn't even bash anybody, but they just,
it seemed to me that that's where they were going.
And I just stopped them at the pass and I said,
have a wonderful day.
And about them.
But Steve just entered the room right now.
He's got an emotional look on his face.
He's wiping, washing his hands with holy water.
So that means obviously we have a serious moment coming up.
Now what's going on?
No.
I walked in the door.
Everyone told me we were attacking me or something.
Oh, it's not attacking you.
I was telling you.
When you were making trouble.
I was telling it.
You told him I was attacking me?
Yes. He said you kneel, got on, and was attacking me.
No, I didn't attack you.
I responded to the attack on us.
That took place for four hours yesterday on your show.
I responded to that.
Oh, we got a lot of nasty calls yesterday.
You're looking at me that way for.
Well, you got a lot of nasty calls because you let it go on.
See, I really believe that if you don't,
because I get, like we had one little while ago,
I wanted to talk about your show.
I said, I don't want to talk about it.
And I hung up on it.
But I love it.
They have to.
Don't you know, I know you don't, you don't like it so much.
I love it.
Yeah, I love it.
If I'm doing it to somebody like Alice, who's on another station,
I don't like it when it's with me or with him.
I mean, it calls about the bird yesterday.
We're just, it's got to an epidemic where it was like,
they were all old.
They're people we don't want listening anymore.
I understand.
We don't want it to.
I stood up to you guys.
What are you, what are you,
you angry at me too?
I didn't hear it.
Oh, I heard it.
I heard it.
While I called you guys, I mean, yeah, I was a great call.
What's their complain about me?
Basically, what they top of the show wasn't,
you know, wasn't you and Neil the time we were talking about talk radio.
So this movie yesterday and we got,
but nobody saw it.
So I know, I know, we were talking about the nature of the business and stuff like that.
The nature of the thought was not a bad show.
You thought it was a bad show?
I thought it was an abortion.
Of course, you're against abortion.
So you're very, very against abortion.
But I just am not into that and it's happened so many times.
Maybe I'm getting to the point where I just, you know,
have I'm saturated with it because it's happened on a lot of shows.
That's just yours.
Or you do show a few weeks ago.
Don't you love when people attack you?
And the way I love that, when I'm not on this, my favorite,
my favorite part of the other stations is fine.
My favorite parts of your show when people call up to attack me have always been.
But they don't, we don't let them do that here.
Well, you know, but I mean, I, what I'm trying to say was I like it when they hear that on this show.
Yeah, you're a little bit down then.
Yeah, call now and again.
Well, it was a, but not really.
That was the strength of my mental always being.
Because it became the topic.
Well,
I don't, I don't want to begin the topic of the whole show.
See, whenever they have the opportunity and it never all appears like I said this morning,
like the old WGBS.
I mean, every misfit caller that was ever invented.
Well, I feel a lot of these people, I think a lot of these people have to be straightened
up because they don't.
They're not going to be straight.
What you do.
Well, they're not, they don't want to be straighted out.
They're all listening right now, including society insurance.
It's not, it listens every day.
It's as I continue to say, it's not, I don't do the show for the call as I do it for the listeners.
And I think that people are confused some, you know, in many ways between what you do and what I do.
No, I don't think so.
I don't think, I don't think they're confused at all.
I think that the people who hate me with a passion and there are many of them,
sees those opportunities to pretend that they're confused or pretend they don't understand or whatever,
but the bottom line, in fact,
Si was a classic point, which is why I called right after that call because he started out,
if you remember.
And he said, well, you know, there's no question you guys do two different shows.
Neil is one show, you do another show, but that bird, that cackling idiot,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
And then by the end of the call, because science is a very emotional, angry man.
I don't know what is problem.
He's got some problems.
And he gets hostile and his blood pressure rises by the end of the call.
Like disgusting filth and hell.
And he was talking about, you know, I must say, you know, quite frankly,
I didn't know the, I didn't know, I didn't know these kind of things.
But if they do, I won't let them go on the air.
Oh, they do.
Tremendous thing.
Well, I think it's the poorest thing.
And it will not all happen in the same trough.
It will not walk in evidence of that.
It will.
We're all not happening again.
I don't think you know, I think you liked it like I like it.
No, I don't.
You're wrong.
Okay.
No, I hear it on the station.
Now I know.
But let's get to the serious thing that I heard on the way in here.
You know about this business just when you think you got it made and everything said,
that was the serious career is said.
Well, I missed that.
Oh, okay.
I'm talking about.
We didn't say I did a monologue.
I was in a movie.
Bob Lasseter would have been delighted.
I went to see a movie this morning.
Oh, Debbie does, uh, Davey?
No, this is a thing you'd be sure to miss called the, uh,
I missed the lockout that,
what was that one last night?
Games would move.
Oh, Mississippi burning.
Great.
That sounds like a good idea.
Unbelievable film.
Unbelievable film.
But I forgot the title.
I blocked out the title of the thing with James with this morning.
It's opening today.
Be sure to miss the top of the question.
Oh, it was the way if it hadn't been for, uh,
if it hadn't been for the critics in the audience in their
sarcastic remarks, it would have been painful.
But anyway, what is it?
A show about zits?
No, it's a show about drugs and James Wood plays it.
It's awful.
It's time to...
I got to remember the,
the upper, the helper, the something...
The, they come by the way at the Toyota of Hollywood.
They told me the other day that they have a small new vehicle coming out of the,
the thinking and put it on the market that you can actually drive in James Wood's zits.
You can actually get right on there and zip right through.
You're still...
I have something serious to discuss.
Yeah.
Can I get to it?
Just when you think you've got it made in this business.
And all of a sudden I figure I'm...
Yes, we're all along and all of a sudden I'm up against the F Charles again.
I try to...
I was on the hard day.
I get away from this car.
I mean, I destroyed my career.
All the people I want to hear are material from the previous two hours.
I'll be turning Leon at noon.
Those late risers.
I mean, but going up against Charles with that point,
oh, oh, oh, whatever that he had,
he would have been a much better lead in over here.
You do know that.
Oh, yeah.
Powerhouse.
Well, I told him.
I said, you know what?
But I said, if we can't get Jeff, we'll settle for now.
I think they probably ought to give us six over there, don't you?
That's two for Miller, two for Fowler and two for Charles.
Oh, what happened to...
The...
Oh, I'ma said something we can give me in trouble.
I was going to say the best guy at the station.
What's happening to...
I mean, next to Lee, the best guy at that station,
Dick Farrow, what happened to Dick?
Is there a doubt?
I have no idea.
I guess he's history.
He must be out.
I can't believe it.
I'm probably starting to big thing up at Century Village up there.
And now you...
Because they did the same thing to Port John Broward.
I don't know what you're like.
But now you can go up against Fowler now.
I know.
That's the word we've already conceded.
Just when we thought we had the whole market right in the palm of our hand.
So anyway, these miserable misfits that you had on yesterday
since you're trying to...
It won't...
No, I'm telling you, it won't happen again.
Anybody attacks you off, say, Uncle Neil doesn't want to hear this.
Let him call.
Oh, you're inviting to call here.
Oh, no.
Because it's amazing, except for one old bag
who is wonderful, a who called today who is calling allegedly for Mr. Disney,
not for...
I'm a call-in line, which is generally the way you do it.
Call a talk show line to get the general manager.
And she even called a second time,
but hung up before we could get her mouth to start moving.
But other than that, everybody seems happy.
They don't hate him today and they just...
Well, you're going to...
You know, these were just a bunch of mouth-miss answers.
That is correct.
Right.
The GBS...
Why make you deal?
I won't permit those close-ups.
I'm a GOL-D.
I don't permit people to attack me because I like that.
I will permit people to attack me.
I would like that.
You will like that.
I love it.
I love it.
I mean, you can defend me like I defend you.
No.
If you believe it...
I mean, I wouldn't want you to gratuitously defend me.
Yeah, but it wouldn't be any fun doing that.
If they say something...
If I agree with them,
would make it even more interesting.
Oh, no.
I mean, if you got to say what you really feel like I do,
how do you like that, bum?
I think it was...
I think it was this guy you were talking about.
Who's the guy you were talking about?
The insurance guy?
Si.
Who kept saying that I was being nice to you just because you worked here?
Yeah.
You got to really...
You got to really...
You mean me every day, yeah.
In other words, the man was calling me a liar.
He got to see me every day.
In a show about talk radio,
we'll turn into a Bash-Neil Rodgers show.
Yeah.
And that's what Ernie Granger...
Granger's...
And an entire show.
That come early in the day.
Granger and an entire show where I was the topic.
And I didn't know where they were.
The more they...
The more they bash you,
or me or whatever,
that he wasn't on Saturday morning
because I don't have good concentration
that early in the morning.
And Ernie's very big in a concentrate.
I mean, how long do you think a show would last?
Bashing Ernie.
For you...
I mean, you know, like...
No, I can't just stain it.
I've tried, but after the first two or three minutes...
Well, that's what I'm saying.
Because once you see one death camp, you've seen him.
Right.
And once you've lost a sock,
what can you say?
I'll tell you one thing.
You ought to get Ernie together with that weirdo
that you had on the phone at Waco.
What was the name?
The one from California that Nazi law.
Oh, oh, right.
What would that be a show?
What great programming.
Why didn't I think of it?
And Ernie could say,
I've been there.
I've seen him.
I counted the body.
You know, and you would...
You would embellish him as you went along
because he's got a wild imagination about it.
Right up there.
But he's a...
He's an incredible...
He is a real student of the Holocaust.
I mean, not just a student,
but I think he like lives it.
You know what I mean?
I'm talking with the idea of doing a show with René-Roy.
When he goes home in 30-30-5,
Lord and I,
when he goes home and tortures his wife and I turns on the gas and the stove,
that's getting a little bit carried away.
But he can't help it.
He lives it, you know.
You're having Laurie...
Well, I was thinking that this is still in the formative in the...
Oh, Mrs. René-Roy.
Mrs. René, Mrs. Ocean and Laurie,
on the tipana,
what it's like to be married to talk to a host.
I thought that would be cute.
Well, why would you have René-Roy?
Well, this...
I don't know what to say.
How can you...
How can you be so cruel?
It's a one-nineteen at WIOD.
And on Saturday the 14th of January,
we will be at Toyotohari with Tomlaken Foodie.
Boy, this is Attorney Traumatic here,
all of a sudden, 22 minutes past one.
By the day.
At WIOD.
Quite a day.
Boy.
Poor Sharon, everybody's just...
Pull me up.
Well, anyway, moving right along.
What happened, all of a sudden?
I don't understand what happened.
We're all just sitting here.
Okay, we got somebody on a payphone and Broward.
Hello.
Yeah, hi, Deal.
How are you?
Okay.
I had a wonderful story about old people.
The other day I was sitting eating lunch,
you know, long-distance silver.
And when I parked my new truck,
I left plenty of spaces on either side of it.
And behind me, it was late in the afternoon.
Behind me was about 10 spaces.
There was no cars.
It was on senior eating this lady,
this old big Ford,
decided to pull in next to mine
and take all half the story of my truck.
And Roshita says,
she's back up and starts to leave the parking lot.
And then decides that she must have been hungry.
So I think she pulled back in and parked.
And I went out there and I said,
why did you do that?
You know, you just spoke on other spaces.
Why did you have to try and squeeze next to Michael?
Yeah.
Well, I usually park in that space every day.
Was your answer.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
That's her private property.
I think probably if she would paint her name,
you know, on the end of it there,
that would probably be a good idea.
So I went out and she was like a space mountain somewhere.
She really was.
I don't know.
Anyhow, she proceeded to walk right past me
and go in and order her lunch.
And get it and sit down.
There's about four people in the restaurant
so I do this also.
So they called the...
How bad was it?
It's $900.
Hmm.
You know, so you were probably like
infringing over a little part of her space.
No, because next to me, on the other side
was a wide handicap space.
So I always park a little close to that
because those spaces are real big.
Yeah, you drive a Mac truck and those.
Yeah, exactly.
And you know, I just trucked my joy six months old
and it's a Bronco.
It's like $19,000.
So I'm trying to take care of it.
And so the guy at the restaurant tells me
she comes in every day
and is in real pain when back
and she sits in this one booth only.
And if somebody happens to be in it,
she'll go over and ask them to leave.
And she sits and talks, so she...
What does she ever name on a booth, too?
I don't know.
I mean, they wish they could get rid of this woman.
So...
So eventually the mother...
That's probably the lady who's also called earlier.
Got our 6, 10 frozen on her A&M doll.
And he has one station, too.
On a radio.
So the police room finally comes,
Mars cycle police room.
And she won't go out to talk to him.
So he has to come in and sit with her
and she says, well, I didn't do that.
I wasn't even there.
And meanwhile, my black paint all over the front of her car.
And so he gives her a ticket and finally
gets the information and the witnesses and all that.
And she decides, because she had assurance,
which surprised me to know in.
And she said, well, I want to pay you, I don't want...
I assurance, to come to me, to know about this.
And I'm sure you probably don't,
because the people in the restaurant told me
that she wasn't driving so well,
and that he took away her wife.
Wonder why.
And...
It's just...
She casually, after that, got up and finished her lunch
and drove home.
And the only good part about it was she did give me a check
the other day and it was good.
And I trucks me a fix now.
But this lady,
does not belong on the road.
Yeah, well,
she went on a company, sir.
My grandfather's 91.
Yeah.
And six months ago, he got a six-year license in the mail.
Excellent.
You know,
and he drives, he's a pretty tough old guy,
but you don't want this man on the road
and you certainly don't want to be.
And how the state can do this.
Yeah, very easy.
It's called incompetence, sir.
And he's called incompetence.
Well, listen, I wish you the best of luck
and stay out of that diner, okay?
I know where her space is now,
and I'm sure I'm not going to...
Okay, good luck to you.
125 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Broward.
524-9463.
Miami. Hello.
Hi, gang.
Yeah.
I was up at Sky Lake Mall a few weeks ago.
No, one of you sound a little depressed.
No, there was a movie there.
It's called Dominic and Eugene.
Oh, yeah, I heard about them.
My mother's saw it.
I really?
In fact, my mother's comment on Rainman,
which infuriated me,
she said,
it was a little long.
Oh,
that was all she had to say.
The acting was good, but it was a little long.
Like an egg timer.
When you go into a movie,
it should be an hour and a half,
and at the end of the hour and a half,
the little alarm should go off to wake you up,
and then it's time to go home.
You know, and you killed a couple of hours.
But you're perfect,
but we can't expect mother Rogers to be perfect.
Yeah, all right.
I'm a perfect idiot, right?
Anyway, there was a song that was starting up,
while there was a pool room scene in Dominic and Eugene.
Yeah, I know it.
The eye-n-eye.
There were two bars.
There was...
Can I say this?
An excited kidder ran through the crowd?
Really?
Yes, they were.
It was very recognizable.
The crowd, and there were very few in the crowd.
There were under 65, I believe.
No, they were...
They'd laughed along with the movie,
the way the rest of people did.
Really?
Of course, if I play that song,
it may be Apple Plucky, friends.
No, very few are.
You've got a violent local minority that are just...
You know, God knows why they love you so much.
Really?
Yeah.
And Glenn, you're semi-wonderful.
Thank you, Sarah.
Okay, sir.
Have a good life, and don't bother comments again.
Okay, Jackass.
127 at WIOD.
I don't have any idea what his story was.
We have an open line in date.
I think, did I say that?
Or am I...
I'm losing it.
There's a cut, very confusing there.
It's like, I don't know what just happened.
And you're showing me.
Who came in and cheered at that?
I was visiting somebody in a hospital,
and they wouldn't let her in,
and Steve went running out,
and they're just...
I mean, there's no emergency.
I don't want anybody to panic,
but it was just strange.
Why not?
I don't think we got through to Steve at all.
I think he was rather oblivious.
Am I wrong?
That's Steve.
I think he was a little oblivious
at the point I was trying to make.
It's not like I'm thin-skinned,
and I don't want people ripping me on air,
because it goes on all the time.
But I don't think it's a topic for a show,
especially on this station.
Yeah, I don't think he...
You're right, I don't think I got the message.
It's just like, it's a gratuitous kind of thing,
and if I don't want him to do it,
he won't do it anymore.
That's not the point.
It just...
And not only that,
it wasn't in the least bit entertaining,
because it was the same thing,
over and over and over again.
Just different variations on the same thing,
but they all sounded the same.
And it was basically the same thing.
Either I'm disgusting and grotesque,
and it all like me,
or you're a cackling idiot,
and they've been listening to me for years,
et cetera.
Now, I don't know where they just came from.
This is part of this AM crowd again,
and they've lost us for a year.
But what about the year that I was on I&Z
and the daytime from 10 to 2,
doing the same stuff?
That's what I don't understand.
Puzzled at that.
Because you were there most of that time.
We're doing the same kind of stuff,
even wilder and wackier and whatever.
And they just...
It's like in their minds that never happened.
I mean, how many substance are your soul, Rodgers?
Any what?
Substance.
Substance.
There's a substance in this call,
but federal law prohibits us from naming it.
Okay, it begins with an S.
Okay.
Rodgers.
Okay, Rodgers.
Okay, Rodgers.
You all better save y'all, Mr. Macho.
This is one of those guys going down to the wrestling
every Wednesday night,
and watching a bunch of panties and tights
running around, tumbling and grappling
with each other in a ring.
Mr. Macho.
751.
WIOD and THADE.
We have an open line there.
If you move quick, we can get in with our last wonderful call.
We just came in.
Was he going?
Everyone was in such a good mood
until we had that little episode a few minutes ago
where we rehashed all of this good stuff.
We don't have any substance on this show.
So we talk about nothing but
frivolity and foolishness,
nonsense, and that's what it is.
And if you don't like it,
you can stick it in your ear, okay?
Or wherever else it might fit.
My macho friend.
Anyway,
it's 133.
April War of the Mistani by now.
And we don't want that guy to tune out now
because one of the things that all the macho guys
do when April comes over the headlines
where they immediately grasp their crotch.
Mm-hmm.
And then they get up and they run out
into the hallway and then all the women
who are crotch watchers
that will have something to look at.
Okay, so anyway, April is here
to stimulate the minds,
the brains of our intellectuals
and the audience,
and we'll come right back.
That's when it's a little off.
Happy day.
I think if I could kill it,
it would be fantastic to kill this up.
Back to the beginning.
I gotta wait for it.
And then played both of them at the same time.
Good, good.
Of course, God only knows how much it is done.
Oh, 30 seconds.
All right, we'll wait.
136, let's go to Miramar.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I'm a first time caller.
I met you at the ice cream shop
the last year.
I'll be darned.
You know, the ice cream shop
that isn't there anymore.
That isn't there anymore.
They really knew their business, didn't they?
There was no one in there.
Yeah, they had no clue.
They had no clue.
Well, I wanted to call and tell you that
I have enough substance in my life in other ways
that I love this show because it is frivolous
and doesn't have any substance.
Yeah, and we don't claim to have any substance.
I mean, you know, if a show claims
to be substantive and re-tackle of the issues
and there's nothing there,
then you can rip it.
But we don't make any claims to have any substance.
This is escape.
This is total escape.
It isn't.
It's wonderful escape.
Everybody needs to escape.
I know I sure do.
The old people need to escape.
They just don't know it.
Oh, I wish they would.
Oh, God.
I'll go home and pray.
And I'd like to say to Glenn
that yesterday I heard the show yesterday.
And I want to say to Glenn that I identify with him.
I feel like that he is like one of the audience out there
and he can respond to you and laugh like we would laugh.
Mm-hmm.
That's it.
I just laugh.
He makes me laugh.
It's not fake.
It's not funny.
Well, I feel like that I really did
if I would be and I'm missing you
at the ice cream shop last year.
Oh, I was there one time.
Maybe you were one time and he was inside
which was his first mistake.
And he got squeezed by a pressure with a crowd.
I'll put up against the ice cream.
What would you call it?
The...
What's it called?
Yeah.
He got squeezed up against the counter
and just surrounded squashed.
And what's it called?
Yes.
What's the ice cream?
Yeah.
Yeah, I bet.
Well, that's what I wanted to call and tell you
about that I love you show.
And it's just an escape for me.
Thank you.
That was a nice tinkle.
And you didn't even do it in the hot tub.
Mm-hmm.
Have a nice day.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
138 at WIOD.
There's an open light in brown.
If you move real fast now,
524 at WIOD on your heavy substance station.
We have more substance on issue.
And if you got a big shovel man,
just you can collect it.
So we got that all straightened out.
This rich man, he is just...
Maybe he ought to be like my bodyguard.
Like that, would that be unique?
That would be incredible.
Yeah.
That's the word.
In fact, you know, when the girl from the AP came this morning,
I thought I was driving in and I heard Mike and Henry were talking about her being here.
And I thought, wouldn't it be fun if you posed to the picture
in order that you were made?
I would be tremendous.
You could have been all over the country.
You almost did that one.
Yeah, we can all...
This was when I was doing hurricanes baseball for channel 33 a couple of years ago.
And that was at the time when Rich bought up 700 pounds of food from Valeniz on the first night.
And I said, you know, greasy and I would love to eat,
but not while we're on television, but everybody else picked out.
And I had been invited and never came off anyway,
but I've been invited by some...
Who was it from the Herald?
Some reporter, not Lucy Cooper,
but some other restaurant lady from the Herald.
She wanted me to eat at...
Where was it?
The Rask...
Oh, the round table on Helen Dale Beach and a little of our.
We were supposed to meet there.
And as it turned out, it never materialized, but we had it all set up and then Rich
chickened out at the last...
Never materialized, but we had it all set up and then Rich chickened out at the last minute.
But he was going to go there and present himself as me.
And he was going to have a photographer with her and they were going to write a thing about me
and restaurants and a rascal house and Helen Dale and the old people and this and that.
And it would have been one of the great putons in history.
And of course, you know I would just love to give a little stilts to the Herald,
after what they've done to me over the years, but it just never quite came off.
But there's always the next time.
Port of Miami.
Good afternoon Uncle Neal.
Are you coming or going?
My coming? Well, at the pens of Pound Witch Inn, we're talking about it.
Exactly.
Anyway, it's just been a long time since I talked to you, an old former co-worker
and a long-time listener.
Really?
Now you get one guess.
I don't have any idea what it is.
Stuart Ellie.
Oh my god.
Well, I guess that answers that first question, former.
Now did they used to call you boy wonder years ago?
Uh, seventy-five.
Among many other things, yeah.
Yeah.
I remember when you were boy wonder.
Hi, yes.
Yeah, the girl.
So have you kids been?
What an incredible show.
What does that mean?
Boy, I tell you, if there's a dumpster outside, I'd like to unload a few people.
Uh-huh.
But, uh, no, I just called to say hello and it's been a long time.
Sure has.
Nice to hear you kids up and around.
What are you doing these days, Stuart?
I hope you got out of this business.
No, I hate to tell you I got back into it in May.
Oh god.
I'm working for the former Sunifox radio station.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Why?
It won't be sunny over there in the mornings anymore.
Well, I won't elaborate on that.
But yeah.
Sunni will be all right.
I'm working a part-time full time there.
Great.
And uh, you're like kind of the Johnny Dolan of Y 100.
Uh-huh.
Oh, gee, thanks Neil.
Well, I wasn't a knock.
Johnny's over here at GTR.
He's a good guy.
He shows up everywhere.
He just won't go away, you know.
Well, he's a survivor.
It's only been three stations in 14 years.
I mean, that's pretty good.
It's all over the place.
Anyway, it's good to hear you and Glenn and uh, good luck with everything.
Thank you, Stuart.
Cheer up a little bit.
Well, you thought that'd be.
I'll try.
Okay, enjoy your late.
Bye.
Stuart Elliott.
Now, he was also at the ice cream store.
Well, he came by, yeah.
With his brother, I think, or with somebody.
That's right.
See?
Yeah.
So the last lady you called, we met at the ice cream store in Stuart Elliott.
We didn't meet him, but he came by the ice cream store.
And I was about to say, and I got sidetracked,
that the best promotions that we ever did were the ones that had nothing to do
with INZ or Zeta.
The best things were the ones that Stan and I did spontaneously.
Those two or three at the ice cream store.
And it was funny because we just used to start, well,
we're a whole bunch of reasons why we started going over there.
That little girl Michelle was working there.
Brian and that other kid working there.
Who just happened to be fantastic young people.
It looked very good.
We've always said that looking is not the sin.
And we used to joke about that.
And then all of a sudden, it developed into like a cult thing.
And we started hanging out over there and meet a lot of listeners.
And then we announced formally.
And I never forget that were you there the first night?
No, the second time.
The first night was in the rain.
Yeah.
We were legitimately at least.
I was there.
That was the second night.
It was pouring rain the night I was there.
There were these two thousand people there.
And you were jammed inside.
I never did get inside that.
Now you couldn't get anywhere near the inside.
We just surrounded crushed up against the ice cream company.
It was like a stormy August night.
There had been tornado warnings in the city.
It had tornadoes and it was just pouring.
Harrenda's night.
And I go up there to Lauderdale Hill.
And there's like two thousand people.
I know it was in this little shopping center.
Yeah, in a strip shopping center that's in receivership.
Yeah, it did.
And the ice cream store has long since been out of business.
Most of the places in it,
Plasma have been out of business.
And then we did the one where we drove up in the Ferrari.
I was in there that day.
They drove me up in the Ferrari.
And Beth was there that night.
Well, Beth was there.
It was quite an occasion.
And she was rubbing up against Dave and trees.
Dr. Deathmell, Dr. Deathmell, we haven't heard from him in a long time.
He's got his act together.
And not that we're complaining.
I mean, we just hope he's well and he's out there.
He doesn't have to call. We're sure he's fine.
A 144 at WIOD.
But anyway, the ice cream store thing for great.
Yeah.
Right at night.
That's for nights.
And it was chaotic.
And I like that when it's a little bit chaotic.
The only one that the station did,
that really turned out with a huge turnout
was at the Broward Mall.
No, not the phone place.
No, you're going to say the telephoto.
That was incredible.
And also at the Zoom, remember that?
And nobody could find us.
Right.
David Lee.
And they were very hostile about that.
The station good.
Wow, we had this big day out there.
We had the concert in Richard Marx.
And we had a big time.
But we went out there and froze our buns on, by the way.
I mean, it was freezing.
And they had us under this little tent.
And they put us in a place where nobody could find us at all.
And then the next morning, we had all these people calling and saying,
we drove all the way down there.
And when the metro zoos like going to South America,
I mean, it's in the middle of nowhere.
And we couldn't find you.
And nobody knew where anything was going on.
Remember the wind whipping through there?
They had a few hundred.
Like it was yesterday.
Reason.
God.
Absolutely freezing up on a little platform.
And under that tent.
And then some of the people came by.
Wondered why we were a little sour that day.
We were signing those pictures.
By the way, those pictures.
Haven't we're supposed to get?
Okay, let's go to Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
This is my first time listening to you.
Really?
Yeah.
What a shock, huh?
Yeah.
Our friend of mine.
Listen to you every day at work.
Right.
And I run to Carl and tell him that I'm listening to him.
I'm listening to you guys really.
And you guys are a joke.
You're great.
But he turned me on to you guys.
What is this guy's first name?
His name is David.
Oh David.
Oh David.
David is a real douchebag.
Yeah.
Great.
Okay.
Well, I was a good call.
It's 146.
I got it.
146.
It's a W-I-O-D.
Oh, and I think he's probably out there confused wondering
why she's hearing that dial tone in the phone right now.
And I realized it was your first time.
Okay.
But there are certain words, you know,
that we would prefer avoiding,
and a seriously avoiding.
Like the one that you said,
let's start it with an S.
And we can't say that.
Oh.
There are occasions when we were like,
why she was happy, you know.
And she was having a good time.
Oh yeah.
So probably four sheets to the wind.
Anyway, it's 146 at W-I-D.
But anyway, it's 150 at W-I-O-D.
And moving right along,
what were we just talking about there during the break?
Just before we came back,
I had something devastating that I wanted to say.
Okay, I must have been really important.
Now we got a pay phone here.
Some really big information on big-breasted Oriental women.
Hey, how's it going?
Okay.
Listen, I want one more person.
Are you been doing some research?
I know I'm sorry about that, but
the host is over there in Denny's, man.
Biggest brush you can imagine.
And she's from China.
I mean, thirdly.
Really?
Yeah, for real, man.
But anyway, it's the first time call it long time listener.
Yeah, in fact, I was in at the same Denny's a few weeks ago,
and even have a little thing in the menu,
which is under the chicken items.
It says the biggest breast in town.
Oh, no doubt.
Yeah.
Okay, we're going to check it out.
All right, so how's it going, guy?
Fantastic.
We're having a wonderful day, and the best part of it is,
it's almost over.
No doubt, man.
Okay, you have to go.
I like you guys, man.
I don't care if the Glen, you know,
Cackles or whatever you do, man.
Because you guys make a good team.
You know what I'm saying?
You can't break a good word, brother.
Okay, bye.
151 at WIOMD.
We just had a report on a Chinese,
was she a waitress, did he say?
Yeah, Denny's.
As Denny's in Halendale,
has got enormous breasts.
According to this young man,
who's been doing some very, very heavy research.
So to speak, ponderous.
Pangeless ponderous research.
Who is that lady that was out there?
Because I can't see she is more,
she is more see from the.
Oh, yes, she's a nice lady.
All kinds of stuff is breaking.
Hell is breaking loose on this story.
Really?
Now, you were, it was on the today's show this morning,
nationwide.
No, I was not aware of that.
So there it is.
I mean, we're getting more and more of the USA today.
The poetry, yes, I saw that.
I saw that.
Today's show did a long, long story on that.
So even at the risk of calling people, you know,
stereotyping and calling people old farts,
I would say that this is definitely an old farts story.
It's, you know, the epitome of everything that's wrong
in this community is that we have too many people of that mindset
who want to be miserable and hostile and nasty.
We have no heart, no compassion.
We just want to lock themselves away with people
of their own hateful mentality and shut the world out.
Well, it's an interesting, it's more subtle in that.
Because there are, you know, you keep talking about
Heather, the old fart mentality and then they're older people
who are nice decent.
And there are many of them.
So real division at viewpoint and they have
fielded a slate of compassionate people
who run for the board and the selection that's in the next few weeks.
And we're talking to all the folks at the viewpoint tonight
that some really nice and compassionate people out there
and with any kind of luck, we're hoping to get the new slate voted in.
And I think it's just a handful of stubborn old
fart that are, you know, that are on the board now.
The man said this morning on the today's show,
he said they're not asking them to change any rules.
That's right.
He says all they want is to let her stay there
until they sell the condos.
That's correct.
And also there is a thing in the bylaws that says that
the board of directors without threatening the adult status
of the community can vote in a hardship case to let one child in
without endangering the adult status of the community,
which is what we're trying to do, you know.
So it'll be interesting to see what I'm going to do.
Mm-hmm.
All they're asking for is just a little understanding compassion.
And that's what you're worth.
There's a whole group of people over there who just can't find it.
That's exactly right.
That's what the role says in the anthem of course the law.
And once we make the first exception,
we'll have a whole bunch of noisy little kids.
Oh yeah, they talk to these neighbors and say,
it's not our problem just because they have kids.
I want, you know, we don't care.
Can you believe it?
Oh, but there are a lot of very,
listen, I've heard from more and more
the people that live out of the viewpoint
that are real nice people.
And I think we're going to hopefully,
we've got to hope they're in a majority.
That's all.
We're going to go out tonight and try to talk to them
and talk to each other.
Okay, that's coming up, too.
Jamie will be here in Jill and Lynn.
And Marcy is here.
Unfortunately, the other side has declined to appear.
Am I correct?
Oh yeah, they won't come on the show.
They won't talk to you.
Sharon on the phone.
All the Aussies just in hiding.
It was fascinating though,
then the day that you were given the number out
and then we gave it out the next day
that they were using, that same old ploy about.
Well, our lawyer is going to be calling you
and stop these people from calling here and so on and so forth.
You know, people have a right of free speech within reason.
As long as it's not harassment.
Exactly. I'm hoping this thing will...
I don't usually get involved to this degree in these cases
because usually it's a no-one situation.
But I have real hope on this case
that something can be done.
Excellent.
Okay, that's coming up, too, on a Steve Kinchel.
Let's go to Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I've been studying this question
of the people that have a radio
that only has one station on it.
Yeah, the Frozen Dial Syndrome.
Yeah, but actually it's true that...
If I Frank Sinatra is coming out in a movie
with Henry Fonda, pretty soon,
it's a sequel to the China Syndrome.
It's called The Frozen Dial Syndrome.
Don't want to let me know.
Which is going to be brainwashed
in the listening of WOLD.
It's kind of like a spin-off on the Manchurian candidate.
It's tying all those in together.
Well, talk about nostalgia.
But during the 30s,
the Nazis issued a radio to the people in Germany
with only had one station.
Yeah.
And my guess is that those radios
have picked up at a fire sale around here
and being sold to the old people.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
And if Ernie finds out about it,
I wouldn't really be ticked. I'll tell you.
Well, you guys, we'll do an exposure.
I'll let you know if I find any of those radios.
And you're doing great commercials.
One other thing.
You do commercials for char-hut and for neuter systems.
That is correct.
Well, not at the same time.
Well, yeah, that's what I had in mind.
Because I can hardly get into the char-hut at Hollywood now.
It's so crowded with your listeners.
And I see a lot of stylish women
there carrying the neuter systems,
they're pro-shores.
Does that tell you something?
Great. Well, see, if you lose enough,
you can afford to go over there
and cheat a little bit every now and then.
Well, yeah, I'm going to have to get the neuter systems
before I try to get in that door again.
Okay.
That's what Fat Riches is doing.
If he tried to get into the door at Hollywood
and couldn't do it,
there was nobody in the store either.
But that's another story.
Now, Linda, is Linda here in the building?
I haven't seen her yet.
Splendon the phone?
Okay, let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've never been to the ice cream store.
I do hang out at the baseball card shop at Homestown though.
Great. Well, Steve will be down to seeing it.
I have time for an Ernie story.
Sure, anything you like.
As long as you don't bash him too hard.
No, no, no.
I will make an exception in his case.
A week ago, Ernie started the show right after the cop killing
and spent the first hour just pouring his heart out,
pouring his heart out on the subject,
just gun control and this and that,
this and that.
And the first color he took was a little low lady.
And she said, hello, Ernie.
Did you ever solve the toilet paper?
Yeah, we've been writing no question about it.
Ernie was speechless for the first time in his life.
Well, see, that's called from the school of wishful thinking.
A lot of those old parts would like to need the toilet paper.
Most of them have no use for it,
because they haven't had a good BM in months, you know, in years.
Some of them, but they can always hope.
Well, it happens, everybody.
Where there's life, there's hope.
Well, good luck.
Backward shouldn't happen.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, that's Ernie's motto as a matter of fact,
where there's life, there's hope.
And to believe me, if you listen to me show long enough,
you'll find a little bit of each.
North Miami Beach, hello.
Yeah, Neil, you made the hell of the hell.
Well, judges, page 5A, Neil Rogers was pulling down top rated talk show.
Yeah.
My Karen Conway.
Terrific.
Well, it's interesting, because Karen never spoke to me,
but from what I understand, there are things in there
which we can't discuss on the air.
But it's always good to have it in a hell of a nail digest,
because that's one of my favorite papers.
Ha, ha, ha.
So you can see it.
They used to send it to me every week at the,
or just another one of those things that clung up the mailbox.
Thank God, they haven't discovered we're here yet,
or else they don't have the postage.
