Hasn't had a chance to do it in a long time. I know. I mean call a race on here.
Burdy's melody with Benny Green.
You know his name is Benny Greenstein.
And he changed it to Benny Green for racing purposes.
And of course, rating port racing purposes kind of difficult because it's hard to see him under the water.
And in the ninth race, I'm picking.
How could you go wrong with this doing this show?
Yeah, ask me a question with Julio Pazua.
I just love that name boy. Ask me a question.
That would be a good name for this show. Yeah.
Ask me a question.
Look at that. Harry Trotzick trains that horse. So he's got a shot.
He's four to one in the morning line. And that's my that's it.
So anyway, what was I saying about horses?
Boy, you asked him anything. You're supposed to be keeping track.
I got side railed there because I gave our picks.
But what led me into what I said, something about horses.
Well, let's see. We're talking about.
Management. And then I said horses and horses, asses and it all kind of.
Oh, I like to fit together in there.
So I want to apologize to Dennis who called me from hot 105 this morning.
And I said Dennis, the menace, I guess. And I was Reese.
I told Sandy put it through to Gary Bruce's office.
I went back there and waited five minutes. Nothing happened.
I don't see a lot of calls on the board yet.
I'm sorry. Ratings day. Oh, sorry.
So if you have anything you want to get in here, you better do it now.
Because once we get into those numbers, you know that it's audio.
It's the only people that care are the ones in a business is why Johnny
Dark is here today too. Okay.
Like you say celebrity guest in the studio.
Johnny Dark.
And I want to make it clear not to Johnny dark from WMCA or WBL.
Johnny dark WNBC.
There's a new movie in town. Johnny darks in it.
And WRKO that Linda Blair movie.
I have to look at the paper. See the name of it in Johnny dark.
And I always said that Johnny dark just turns my head around.
Linda Blair movie. New Linda Blair movie.
No, no, I can't think of the name of it.
I don't know. You know, can you imagine a couple sitting at home and the guy
says to his wife, honey, let's go see the new Linda Blair movie.
Anyway, now depending on what transpires today, I just imagine this because once we
get into those ratings, the show goes to hell and a handbags.
But all depending on what transpires today, tomorrow, I may have a show that'll
make, remember last Thursday with the memo, it'll make that pale in the wind
significance because there are things going on that are so I told you some of
it coming to work before the phone crapped out.
Just mind boggling things, okay?
Shocking things.
Yeah.
But I don't want to get into any of it today.
But tomorrow, we may have a real barn burner for you on this show.
Now, speaking of barn burners, I want to go by, we have some memos from the past here.
By the way, topic on the Steve Cain show today, sex surrogates, therapist or prostitutes.
Or as I think would be more right down to earth wouldn't it?
Marilyn Volker.
Now, Marilyn Volker, it seems to me as one of those feminist, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
That name ring several bells.
No, Marilyn Volker is like from the, oh, what the hell is that group?
I ain't got it.
No, seriously, Marilyn Volker is like for, what's the age group in Broward County?
I can't think anything today.
Me.
That's Marilyn Volker.
She's with that.
What does that have to do with sex surrogate?
Oh, well, at all, I guess kind of time.
And the Reverend Rick Patterson, who of course is a vehemidly anti sex or anything that has to do.
I'll be honest with you, they use a piano in his church.
He's so anti organ that it just, not a not just that's just a little, little play on words there.
Okay.
And look at Henry Henry saying, gee, dad, it was a world, let's, sir.
I heard about that zipping and flipping and all that other stuff that was going on.
I'll tell you, hang around with Grandma Boone long enough and got only nose.
You'll show to the world.
Anyway, the Bill McQuade show, this is September 3rd, 1987.
These are guest listings from the past to WIOD.
All right, let me, let me do this.
Okay.
Seriously, we got three people under.
Get them off.
I want to see from all of people in the audience that don't want to hear about the ratings
today. They're sick and tired of us wasting an entire show.
Get them off of there now.
Nick cut it out.
I want to see from everybody.
Let's see show on the phone.
We don't usually do this because this audience is not like the wins and zeta audiences.
They used to be spotted within seconds.
Number.
There's a couple of points.
It's what we're talking about here, kids.
Four, five, five, the Broward line, breath six, seven.
Look at the date.
Look at the time.
I'm being blind.
Seven.
They're flanking.
There's still, oh, there you go.
Eight.
Now that took quite a while, didn't it?
Yeah.
All right.
Now all you pain in the ass people that want to eat.
All right.
Now all those people are wanting here.
The ratings immediately that are sitting on the edge of their seats.
Now is the time for you people to call in.
Let's let's.
They're two.
Yeah.
Whoa.
They're good Palm Beach.
Three.
Oh, I wonder who that is in bokeh.
That must be SBR.
Hop.
There goes Palm Beach.
There goes one of Broward five.
It's about even six, seven.
One more to go and brought eight.
There it is.
It was about a five.
One of them.
They both suck.
All right.
Now.
Okay.
Now those of you who really don't give a good fly and leave either way.
I just want to wind your own business and let us do whatever we want to do.
Okay.
Let's see those.
There's five.
Huh?
Six.
Yeah.
There to do whatever the hell you want.
Palm Beach didn't want us to do what we want to do because they, uh,
seven, they got a mind of their own up there.
Seven.
All but both.
All but no Palm Beach.
Oh, Bob.
I'm not lit.
Well, that's because everybody in JNO wants to eat.
That was a little quicker than the other.
Still not great.
No.
All right.
Let's one more category.
Not seriously.
One more category.
Now those of you out there who don't really care about any of it one way or the other.
Okay.
Who are totally indifferent and don't give a damn about anything.
All right.
Let's see those people.
Not seriously.
Let's see a little show on the phone.
Are those people who just don't give a damn?
All right.
About anything.
Oh, that's good.
There's three, five.
Six.
Florida.
Six.
It's not Florida.
All right.
We still got a date and a brow.
And to go there's six.
Uh, that'll be full in the second.
One a day.
Oh, yeah.
I'm waiting.
I think there might be somebody on there.
I think the light's not flashing.
Yeah.
There's somebody on there.
All right.
Okay.
Well, I've got to prove my point.
Okay.
It's 1013 and you people don't give a good god damn about anything.
Okay.
And that's the way we like it.
Oh, God.
Okay.
The melting pot has got a new location.
In fact, Friday night, uh, going to be there again down in over on South Beach.
No less.
Well, at 1450 Collins Avenue at the Rhythm Club.
It might be.
Now the Rhythm Club is a Rhythm and Blues night club with live entertainment.
And you can enjoy that delicious or gas McFon do that you enjoyed at the other
South Florida Meldy pot locations right there on South Beach.
No less.
And we're going to be there.
I don't know what time yet, though.
It'd be nice if Lynn Friedass would, you know, get on top of this.
Let me I guess.
But that's the way it goes.
So anyway, it's 1016 W I O D and here's some old memos.
Well, the memos do it.
Box schedule.
Yeah.
September 3rd, 1987.
The bill McQuill.
All right.
Wait a minute.
I got one more here.
Don't answer them, Nick.
All right, everybody who'd like Bill McQuill to come back and do the show starting tomorrow
from 10 to 2.
Let's say you fakers on his phone lines right now.
Come on.
Get wet.
Look at that.
Now come on.
Now does that take one?
Wait a minute.
There's one, two, three, four, six, seven, seven Palm Beach doesn't Palm Beach is
I told on they don't know Bill McQuill from from.
George.
There's eight.
Now that was faster than the earlier response.
All right.
Well, let's let's give everybody a chance here.
Dave while we're stalling for the numbers.
Everybody now come on out.
Two more for Bill McQuill.
Boy, he knows that big family moving from Texas one more there.
Cut it out.
It's an off.
Oh my God.
And just an incredible response.
That must be the old Bill Smith audience going nuts.
Yeah.
All right.
There's one more flashing in.
Look at that.
Two more.
We can't stop him.
We can't turn him on.
Here's another one.
Yeah.
It's like killing answered a picnic.
And I got news for you working here is no picnic.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
We got him finally cleared.
Are they clear now?
Wait, just a second.
Another hand.
Wash it.
Okay.
All right.
Now everybody.
Everybody who'd like to see Paul Lyle come back tomorrow and do
tend to do on a permanent basis at WIOD.
Three, four.
Oh, yeah.
Well,
four following.
Wait till I read some of these guests.
They may change their mind.
Five, six, six.
So I guess the verdict is for Bill McQueen.
Seven.
They're not not too fast.
The Bill McQueen show tend to know and proposed budget cuts for
Nate County could mean no lifeguards and some of us out for the
beaches.
County commissioners are meeting today in this proposal.
Joining Bill this morning in the studio, lifeguards,
Lieutenant's Marshall Hale and Dave Batonfield, a good and timely booking.
It says.
So yeah.
That's what it says.
That's like radio at its best.
Yeah.
All right.
Shining hour.
Yeah.
No question.
Somebody ought to shine his head.
Oh, that's our program director.
Of course, from Louisville, our six year old program director, 1231,
Bill McQueen, Nate County manager Sergio Parrera talks about the
papal visit and the monumental effort underway to coordinate the events
around the year because they had such big crowds.
Members that they could get anybody to show up also feed back from
Sergio on the lifeguard.
Now isn't this interesting how they got into a bilingual thing here?
It was supposed to be dilemma, but they spelled it D-E-L-I-M-A-Delima.
Isn't kind of like a little Hispanic interpretation there, Delima.
We might use that word now.
I think I might replace like ponderous or something and then Leak and start
using it.
Do you have a little Delima today?
Delima.
I like that.
That's kind of like Spanish, you know?
And all our friends south of Miami, the city of Miami, I guess.
South of North Miami.
South of the Broward line.
Can use that Delima.
Sharon looks like she has a little Delima today herself.
You have a Delima?
And then from one to two, well, maybe we can get somebody to cut it off for
you, Sharon.
Here are the confessions of a nun this afternoon.
Now this don't forget a September 3rd is not a promo for today.
All it might be, you might have its moments.
Confessions of a nun on the Bill McQueen show no less from Elizabeth
Wopton.
Her stories of lesbianism within the event will shock you.
A nun no more Elizabeth comes clean.
That's what it says on the Bill McQueen show right here.
That WIOD News Talk Radio 610.
And that's nothing.
What a, you didn't write this.
You weren't here then, right?
What a pornographic thing this is.
And it says Elizabeth ain't getting on.
Steve Kane show now, ladies and gentlemen, I think this is the, oh,
this is the ultimate two to six PM September 3rd, 1987.
Michael DeSister, the sister of school joined Steve in the
studio to talk about positive discipline.
Oh, unique learning institute.
Now we just happened in these just where my boss who don't play me talk show
schedule for Thursday, February 25th, 1988.
The Paul Lyle show, tendinoon.
Do we have the right to die?
And I couldn't think of a better show to be asking the question on right?
The use of euthanasia for mercy killings is always a hot topic.
It says who used to write these sheets man?
Somebody really just getting carried away.
And today on the Paul Lyle show, Dr. Reed Richter at attorney Bob break.
Oh my God.
Join him in the studio to debate the concept.
Wow.
And then the Steve Kane show on this date, February 25th, 1988 to six,
want your child to become a super kid.
Listen this afternoon, the Steve Kane is parenting expert Michael DeSister.
Drops by, drops by.
I like that very informal to talk discipline and how you should
dole out how much you should dole out to your child.
Oh, Doug Young wrote this, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, Doug Young called me the other day off the air and he was going on a
great length about how Lee is not stealing from me.
I said, boy, you're in a dream world, Doug.
Get a life, you know, and he's a big kneeling.
Oh, absolutely.
Right.
He was tinkling all over the phone.
In fact, they had to put the phone in from the other hide.
No, seriously, that's not a joke.
Wait a minute.
Hot 105, Jack Dennis Reese says, where is he?
Is he on a hotline?
Dennis.
Here I am.
Here I am.
Well, you can't wait for those numbers, can you?
Well, I think what he was like pushed off the receptionist to the people he
have.
Yeah, you do have too many people working at your age.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can think of about a dozen right now.
Just me about six people to get to you guys.
Yeah, I told her where to put it when you're a pretty important guy.
It's not always easy to get through, Dennis.
Would you come over and just hit her in the mouth as hard as you can?
And then hit your wife in a month for me once.
I'll tell you what, both of those are okay.
Well, I'm listening.
I got a great not the rating, sir.
Obviously, you know, I think we're all ready for those.
But the hot rumor is about I 95 coming back.
I 95.
Well, I'll have to get you over there.
Wait a minute.
It's the truth.
They have a brand new program director.
He's been hired from Chicago.
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just a second.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Okay, just a second.
Hold on, Dennis.
This is a dumb roll.
A shame.
Down then.
Didn't I tell you that the days were a day.
What a day.
They have a new.
All right, just a second.
Here we go.
This can't be.
Move.
Here we go.
Now it's going to be the all military disco morning show.
Oh.
I'm back in there.
I'm back in there stronger than ever.
Oh, my God.
I suppose we're going to be a dance urban format.
No disc jockey.
Kind of like just having bored off.
No disc jockey.
I'm going to stop mixing in the midday.
Yeah.
So you know all those mechanics are just going to be tuning
out of you now, Neil.
Yeah.
What happened to us, I guess?
That's the death now.
Dennis, what happened to Rose?
I think I don't.
I'm sure that they're going to probably like ease these people
out.
But if they haven't heard yet, they're like the stupidest.
Yeah, that's the old radio started winning
and doubt.
Ease them out.
Yeah.
No guns or no guns or how the heck in this community
go out about all those little ad libs, huh?
Well, I guess they're just going to go like full board
option.
Maybe they'll all be offered a chance to stay for $5 an hour.
Yeah, but are they going to bring you over to record?
I 95 because nobody said it like you did, boy.
Well, you know what?
Maybe Willie B.
And Willie B.
And Earl.
Earl.
Well, Earl.
Yeah.
Earl of Squirrel was my favorite.
Yeah.
But you know, it's funny because I'm
could you think of anybody to do I 95, but he dies.
Well, this is hysterical.
Yeah.
We call him the I man.
Maybe wait a minute.
The rumor has it that Kyle Isley is the one that's
hard to tell brother is still a format.
Yes, but as long as he gets to play all the old records and I
95, he's to play.
Exactly.
Well, you know, Kyle's a ball of fire.
Yeah.
I like Keith.
Yeah.
It's funny because we were sitting there thinking of like,
God, we got to get somebody to confirm this.
I want to keep your brother works at the station.
He forgot about his brother.
Yeah.
Well, that's easy to do.
Well, listen, you guys are really doing.
It's me.
You guys are really doing it over there.
Tell Keith.
He's a genius in his own mind.
And you're really doing it.
Now he's a super guy.
He is.
Listen, he's a great guy.
He just works strange hours.
That's all.
No, he's really getting better.
We're getting out.
He is buying heap season tickets.
Really?
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
Well, he ought to turn that team around.
Anybody can do it.
He can do it.
Anybody can do it.
Keith will definitely.
Well, listen, if you can turn that station around,
he can probably do that too.
Well, listen, we're waiting with Bated Breath.
We'll give you a, well, I guess he gives you the numbers,
right?
I'm head didn't write that up.
I'll bet.
OK.
But listen, I just want to tell you.
I'll see you later, guys.
Thanks for the info.
OK, man.
Bye.
Wow.
Good.
Look, can I do one?
One.
Ninety-five.
I, 95.
Come on, you just.
OK, there's all you kids out there
would like to be district.
You'd call up Rose Folger now.
Rose?
Because all you got to do, you can't
don't have to say anything else.
I, 95.
That's all they say.
In fact, if you want practice, go out on the highway.
Just read the signs.
Over and over.
And it's great.
And then they could get Ron St. John over there.
And they could change your color.
There's WA1A.
You're a music one.
That'll be next.
I, and thank you.
So Dennis Reese with some shocking news
on ratings they're here.
Now, you notice nothing.
They're not interested in the least bit.
We got the most indifferent audience.
Anyway, that's because all the people who are listening
are in the business.
They don't want to hear if their voice is recognized.
OK, it's 1025 at WIO Day.
It will be great.
The way that will live in infamy
and the anals of South Florida broadcasting,
ladies and gentlemen, shocking.
Can you believe that?
And you always hear these stories first.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I, 95.
Wow.
Wow, he's right.
Yeah.
Boy.
Now, as soon as we can get a station
that'll adopt the Palmetto format.
See, if you have a format that's named after a highway,
like A1A I95, the Dolphin format.
Yeah.
And you can have football and music.
Well, we're kind of doing that now.
Kind of the same.
No, we can have the football.
Dolphin.
We don't have the music.
Well, I 95.
This is probably the music you'll be hearing.
Now, what is that from New York?
What is that?
Palmetto.
Ah, hello.
Hi.
Yeah.
How you doing, Neil?
Who's this?
This is Dave.
I'm down here from New York.
I work for your former network.
Really?
Yeah.
Good day.
You were at the other station still,
right?
And we got into some sort of argument on the air.
We did.
We did.
About what?
About Paul Harvey being a douchebag?
About Joe, he's real name, I think.
Oh, yeah.
Well, something really heavy duty.
We get uptight about that stuff out here.
For sure.
So I'm calling to find out what the hell are you
going to start reading the ratings already?
Well, they aren't in yet.
OK?
Here's another one of these pushy New Yorkers.
Would they come in?
Would they come in like any?
Yeah, that's those for news.
Any minute.
We made the ratings already.
At least I came to the right place.
I was told.
You guys should hire Barbara Sprysion
to be on with Tom with the what's his name.
Peter Jenning, so she's got a nose for news too.
Is it OK if we wait till they come over the machine?
No, he wants them now.
I told you you were the very first to get them.
We are.
We put them on the air immediately.
What's your vested interest in this?
You want to hear those Paul Harvey numbers on WOLD?
WOLD.
But WNWS used to be the colors.
We call them WOLD because their audience is all over 100.
The only station in America where when you turn it on
and it comes fizzing through the radio.
Not listening to a word that I'm good.
I'm listening.
I like it.
I wonder I hung up on you last year.
OK.
You're another one of those pushy New York douchebags.
So you don't work for ABC anymore, huh?
No, I still do.
Oh, you still work for them.
That figures.
Well, listen, it's too bad we don't have Paul Harvey anymore.
But we don't have any more listeners over the age of 100
so we can't use him here.
I see.
OK, Neil, I'm waiting with beta bread.
As soon as we get him out, you'll
be the first one to know OK.
But you didn't answer my question.
What's your scam and all of this?
What are you looking for?
Because then we get a radio junkie.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, you sounded like you had a little problem.
OK, listen, it's great here.
It's great here for me again.
Give my best all those fakers up there at ABC, OK?
Tell them we love their shows, OK.
Pushing New Yorkers.
Wow.
Unbelievable.
And he interrupted this?
Yeah.
You can say that I'm a guy.
I can't.
I can't believe it.
And he didn't give it damn.
So we got the Dolphin's and music ladies and gentlemen
on your Dolphin Expressway station for the ABWIO duty.
In fact, we got a big billboard.
It says pick up Mike, what's his name?
Reniri.
Yeah, I was getting so shocked from that guy from ABC.
Pick up Mike Reniri on the Dolphin Expressway
with his thumb out, you know?
We ripped it off from Dick Burton.
Anyway, it's 1031, a WIWD to phones are sizzling.
We got at least three calls on there already.
They don't care about any of this.
They've all tuned Sandy in already
because they know we're going to do ratings
in their board crapless with that they want to hear.
He's got the bilingual proctologist.
Oh, yeah.
Our audience can relate to that.
Yeah.
You know what he does, right?
Yes.
We got a lot of people in our audience who
can be an asshole in either language.
He kind of fits right in.
Anyway, it's 1031 at WIWD.
And let's give those numbers out.
Let's see some life on his phone for Cry Now loud.
It's ratings day.
Geez, these are the things that we strive for in this business.
They keep calling and I keep hanging up on them.
I don't know why you're putting them on hold,
but it gives you something to do, Nick.
OK, he's got this extra hour.
Oh, Miami, mayoral candidate.
Well, we just hung up on him and we hung up on the one
in Hollywood.
Meryl candidate.
Yeah.
What is that all about?
God, you hung up on him.
I'm the call of Sandy.
We don't talk to mayoral candidates on this show.
OK, we're not Steve Clark, is it?
No, this is Miami.
Oh, Metro.
Oh, Metro.
How long have you lived here that you know nothing
about any of this family, isn't he?
He's not the mayor.
Miami is the mayor of date counting.
Metro day.
I get so confused.
Although in his case, does it make it exactly?
Because what does that say?
There's no feeling.
Right.
Anyway, our topic today on the Paul Isle show,
do we have the right to die?
That's what Dennis Collins is going to be asking
after the book comes out over at WOLD.
How you doing, Dennis?
I hate to break the news for it, but I'm not going
to LaRato, Texas, Dennis.
Not this week, OK?
Boy, it's shocking.
And what goes on in this market, all these subterfuge
and all these wild stories.
So I guess Tanner over there in Cox,
I bet you we don't hear from Cox today.
I got my fingers crossed in my toes, evil, and I said that.
But they're going to be really nervous,
Nellies over there.
I think it's not only is not 105 kicking a crap out of them,
but now they're going to have I, 95,
got only knows until even get out of bed tomorrow.
Well, I think Tanner or together.
I think Tanner can relate to this.
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I haven't feeling that there's probably,
no, seriously, there's probably one of the local radio
pundits in the market now who's been analyzing the whole thing
before the first number comes off the computer.
Like I said, really?
Oh, you can do this.
He's meditating right at the moment.
Or something very close.
Who if we had a psychic doing the weather on his station
and she gave the weather before the information came out,
would that be a premature evacuation?
Anyway, it's 1033 at WIOD.
Let's give the numbers out because I see we're, you know,
we've got a stall for a little while.
I have we have nothing yet.
I thought Sharon would already be running up and down the hall,
but probably our computer is on the blink again.
Or one of our rocket scientists in programming
doesn't know how to get it running.
It's something like the last time.
I remember when the last trend came out.
Now, see, today for those of you novices out there,
both of you and the audience who are not in the business,
the trends that are like month to month, those are,
those are okay, but this is like the big deal.
Because three, four times a year, we have a book.
In fact, you hear these pseudo intellectuals
who call in these people like to sound like they're part of the,
oh, is the book coming in?
You know that kind of, the book.
Anyway, the rating book is like for January, February and March.
This is the winter book, which wants upon a time
there wasn't any winter book in this market.
Those were the good old days, okay?
Well, we had two books a year.
We'd have to go through this crap,
but now they've decided for some reason that it's a major market.
They didn't really decide that,
but they decided to get the money for four books a year at Arbitron.
Oh, yeah.
So they soaked the crap out of these poor bastards
in a four times a year, we have to go through this, okay?
Which means 48 out of the 52 weeks, we're in ratings.
Yeah.
So we don't really give a fly and leap about them anyway, right?
Just like over at Zeta, they didn't care.
If you have good ratings, they didn't care.
If you had bad ratings, they didn't care,
which is why I know.
Ah, it's coming back.
Boy, remember Zeta?
Boy, which time, the first time or the last time?
Yeah, either time.
Those were the days.
Ah, 95.
Oh, I can't, I'm going to be excited.
Now, they're going to change your call letters back to INZFM.
Good question.
Let's take up an office pull.
Are they going to change your call letters from Zeta back to INZFM
when they go back to high?
95, you'd think so.
You know, they never changed them on the building.
Remember, they always let us.
They had a little premonition.
They left them on the building, yeah.
Yeah, no dummies.
Oh, boy.
What's that word that we came up with?
Oh, Delima.
Let's find out how they solve these Zeta, Delima,
a little later on in the show.
Well, you'll hear it first here.
You can go to the bank on that.
Anyway, this, Saturday, in fact, maybe you,
I don't know, I don't know.
Okay.
I told you.
10.55.
Well, he's carried away.
Okay.
How did Waxi do, by the way?
Did we give their number?
I think they went up a little bit.
See, I'm going to try to keep these separate
so we don't get all bald up like the last time.
This is our, for in the business show,
we do this like once a month.
Yeah.
It's got like having a period, you know.
Waxi, three, one, two, a three, nine.
What are a lot of people who are right now?
You bet.
Okay, here's our number, ladies and gentlemen.
12 plus 10 to three.
Well, see, we inherit the first hour of Steve.
I shouldn't say that Steve had his best book ever, I think.
Great book.
We went, let's see, life was number one as they always are.
That's like elevator music with an eight four,
but they don't count.
W-I-O-D from a four six to a seven three.
When we came here, it was a three.
Wow.
It's a seven three.
More than double.
Well, you know how to be in the sevens.
That's boom boom was here that one.
And a quam has risen like 35,000 people or 25,000 people,
185,000, which is about what it was at the INZ one.
We were doing those 85 numbers.
And the time spent listening is up to seven hours a week.
Good.
Lauren.
We came here, it was like three, seven hours a week.
That's like an hour and a half a day.
It's Monday through Friday.
More than seven.
Hot midday.
We even beat hot, would you shock it?
It was six three.
We beat Earl the Pearl.
Magic had a four nine in midday.
Waxie had a four four GTR 304.
One.
Here are those vaunted 25 to 54 numbers, ladies and gentlemen.
Here we go with another.
We already have it.
But it's shocking.
Number one 10 AM to 3 PM W IOD with an 8.6 in 25 to 54.
A unprecedented number in the ANALs of AM radio.
Yeah.
Since they had more than one station.
I know.
We came here in the summer was a two seven and a fall,
which we were a little bit of just a tiny bit of that.
A four five and out on 8.6.
25 to 54, okay?
But I don't know about your show,
because you're eating on the air.
Tom Deneber can't sell your show.
And we don't know.
Yeah, get out of here, Henry.
Flatten him up against one.
He's got to do the news.
God air him out for a couple of minutes, will you?
25 to 54 and 8.6.
Magic had an eight, hot had a six eight midday.
Waxie a five two.
We took that seat.
Go try to get people to talk about your radio station
after 10 o'clock in the morning.
Okay, well, we're trying right now.
GTR, if you shut up GTR of three six up to a four eight
midday is 25 to 54.
Gloves five eight to a four eight.
Wall and 100, two four to a three.
Oh, we never gave the wall and 100 morning number.
Did we or I guess we did?
They went down from a four something to a four something
about a half a point.
Mm hmm.
What about midday for Gonser 25 to 54?
All right.
I had a giant book.
Ah, well, he went to the, he went to the roof on the trend.
Yeah, he went nuts that Gonser.
Anyway, let's give Steve's number
because he did tremendous.
If I can find a damn thing here it is.
This is 12 plus three to seven PM.
Hot had a nine one in the afternoon.
Can you believe that Dennis Reese 12 plus nine one.
They even beat life who had a seven power had a four seven.
I would do a four seven that Steve up
from a three nine to a four seven.
Right.
How do you like that?
Great.
And he continues doing those Eastern Airlines shows.
If he continues ignoring boy Gary,
he can get over a five.
Okay.
I'm serious.
Magic of 46 GTR or 45.
Boy, gee, and I wonder they're just there going nuts here.
Man, they're salivating in a hall
to have a little orgy out there
because both stations went through the roof here.
Okay.
Jumping up and down.
I mean, you know, GTR got a fluke and we went nuts.
A wacky, a wacky at a, a wacky at a four two.
And remember the last trend and spike wise
was acting like a jackass.
And I said, if you look at the pattern,
the first two months of every book they go down
and then the third they go through the roof
and sure enough they came right,
it's like a pattern every book.
But he just gets so emotional
and starts throwing those telephones through the wall
and making holes in the wall.
Now look at this.
Three to seven afternoon drive 12 plus Zeta.
Consistency is the mark of quality.
They stayed at a one eight.
Ha ha ha ha.
Now you guys are denying the rumors over there.
But I just want to say,
they never changed the call letters on the building.
Just remember that.
I'm 95.
We've turned the corner on I 90 time.
And now we're on the turnpike.
Headed out of town like to a e-ha junction.
They'd be big.
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Listen, they can have a station seriously
at e-ha junction for all the people on the turnpike.
Sure.
You know how like when you go through the tunnel,
they got that station in Fort Lauderdale
and Disney's got his own set.
They could have the e-ha junction turnpike station, okay?
And sell the motorists, you know?
Like stop and get your gas and eat it,
or I rod your stuff like that.
Okay, that's going to do it.
If you're bored by these numbers,
but we got thousands more coming up.
So just stick around, stay glued to your seats
in the have a nice day, Dennis,
and all you other folks out there.
We got Harry, who just barely gonna get you
this new guest, I think,
and we'll come back at 11.05.
Rock, call 751 WIOD and date.
524 WIOD in broad,
or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beaches.
Other areas make all collect.
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers
are not necessarily those of the station.
Now, here's Neil Rogers,
our New Start Radio 610 WIOD.
And you know what they say about that guy?
He's an Ojoan Provacatouin.
Okay, 11.05 at 7.00 L.A.
And it's ratings day.
This is the winner book ladies and gentlemen.
All these numbers, they just keep coming out.
It's like, it's like a never-ending nightmare, you know?
It's like you just are lying there,
hoping to wake up someday,
and hoping all this stuff goes away.
Although, you know, we continue doing well.
We go up in every trend on every station.
Then we go up in every, virtually every trend on the day.
No, every one month there was like a little glitch.
But in here, we go up in every trend.
When we came here in 25 to 54s,
they had in midday, and I know the audience doesn't care.
But you know something, we don't care about you.
You know what I mean?
No, we don't.
We don't care if they all drop dead.
As long as somebody else comes along to replace him,
it was a little younger,
because we want to have like 18 to 34s.
Yeah, in summer of 88, 25 to 54, they had a 2-7.
2-7.
Then in the fall, when we came over,
it was a 4-5, a little bit, it was a 4-5.
Now it's an 8-6 in a winter vibe.
See, this is like a little ego trip,
because it doesn't mean anything.
And the salespeople are still going to be dodo birds,
and they'll still find new excuses like they always do.
Wow, those numbers are a little bit too high.
They got everybody scared now.
Everybody scared away, and they just said,
they don't know if they can handle it.
Oh, boy.
So we're still waiting for the rest of the 25 to 54,
so we can see what Steve did.
Oh, let's see.
Steve had a 4-7, but we didn't find out what Alice did.
We didn't find out what Sandy did.
We got so carried away basking in our own glory.
Let's get to it now.
Okay, we did a 7-3 in midday, now we're Sandy.
Sandy.
Here's Sandy, not on page two.
Sandy.
Not on page two.
Remember when she used to get 5s?
Sandy down from a 3-9 to a 3-2, tied for 14.
What odious station are they tied for, oh, Y100?
Yeah.
In midday when all the kids are in school, that figure.
And Steve had a 4-7, an Alice in the afternoon,
a W-L-D in 12-plus, from a 3-7 to a 3.
So Steve is like, I mean, Alice is hanging right on the edge
of her falling into the twos.
A 3.
Waited.
Wait on everybody over there.
Remember morning drive?
Morning drive is way down.
Midday.
Look at Alice's trending here.
Summer of 4-4, fall of 3-7, and now down to a 3.
And the frightening part of that,
at 2.9% of those people our brain did.
They're over the age of 150, other 8K.
How old, how old?
I met you at the palace, how you doing?
Oh my God, things are not good as she all mine
and used to say, okay, 7-8-9-12-plus, hot with a 12-3 at night.
Look at that.
That keeps eyes, man.
He's turned those creoles into weapons now.
A tower with a 6-2,
why 100 with a 4-8 at night?
Life with a 4-7, by most of their people are asleep by that.
Winds with a 4-3 down from a 5-1,
of course, that's when Bruce Williams had a vacation, I guess.
W-S-News, witchner and company from a 5-0,
I think that's their lowest nighttime number in ages.
Well, most of the jails people are 6 feet under now
on a Ho Chi Minh trip.
Love's 94, 2-9 at night.
If Joe's listening over at Magic 25 to a 3-2,
nice going, Joe.
Why are these days, you'll get over a 3-5.
I-O-D at night, 3-2 to a 2-4.
See, that was the nighttime in the weekends.
We do have that bumper sticker.
It says the weekends are deadly on W-I-D.
And the nighttime's are just a little less deadly, okay?
But now that we got boy Gary,
we might get some of the big-name talent,
like boom, boom at night or something like that,
a live living and breathing person, huh?
Well, almost.
From a shabbat of midnight.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hey, very real good.
Okay, let's do a little break here, because it's early,
but let's get it out of the way,
because I'm just so emotional,
I'm just overwrought with emotion,
of course, there's almost no calls, there's 5-sinking calls,
because the audience doesn't care about this.
But the one good thing we found at the beginning of the show,
a little mini survey, they don't care about anything else.
So we don't take it personally,
because we just have it in different audience.
It doesn't really basically give a damn about anything.
Who's still at We1?
Right?
Yeah, we're still at We1.
Whatever the hell we want to do.
Any of you people down in South-Dade and Kendall
and down in that area,
remember when we were talking about that one place,
that great restaurant, which I don't want to,
You know, tremendous restaurant,
and they did not get a little response,
which is unusual for us,
because we do phenomenal for almost all our restaurants.
Yeah.
And I was asking you, if anybody in South-Dade
still speaks English, because it's just really,
do we have any audience down there in South-Dade?
Well, I told you, I'm a...
I know we got a big audience at U of M.
Yeah, we agree.
Now, I'm very, very upset about a trend in South-Dade.
I can just say for a second.
Oh, on your eight seconds.
They're running movies dubbed in Spanish,
occasionally on HBO,
and I'm gonna call store like today,
and if this is gonna continue, I'm dropping...
Now, how much do you handle those cable companies
along and on?
No, I'm gonna pick up Cinemax or something,
but this is, it crossed my ass a little bit, you know?
To...
They were running live in daylight,
just to say the James Bond movie.
In the Spanish.
I mean, is this...
What's going on here?
Shit, what was...
This is the...
The Manana's Soul,
with you, Robert.
This is the...
Yeah.
He has a pretty good taste.
He's an Ojón provocateur.
Alright, it's 11 past 11 at W.I.
I want Fatherly to do that in Esponio.
We'll be right back.
What's the Haca trying to come out of Stinking VCR again
and about the...
Oh, come on.
Well, he just said one car...
Cotto call.
Yeah, I don't think that's...
We don't care.
I don't either.
That's your problem, okay?
Do I come in on the air and bitch about my satellite
and all that stuff?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I got it, seriously.
I may have some shocking...
I already got the information,
but I may discuss it on the air
tomorrow, depending what goes on with our D'Alyma today.
You know what I'm saying?
We may have a story tomorrow that will make new hair grow,
and you place it in your body and you have it in bed.
Anyway, it's 1114 at W.I.
It's our little rating celebration party here today,
and I noticed that Boy Gary even brought all kinds of stuff
into the studio here, messed it up pretty bad, too.
We believe in a clean studio, Gary.
Cleanliness comes first, okay?
A clean body, a clean mind, lead to clean numbers, okay?
Like zeros.
Now, if we missed some Zaden numbers here somewhere
along the way, can we get to this?
Now, Gonser went from a 1-6 to a 1-7 and 12-plus.
We want to give them all the credit in the world,
because they're always said,
he may not be good, but he's consistent.
Through the room.
The room.
What do they do at night?
Because nighttime, they've been struggling.
That lady calls there once and a half.
They turn the corner at night, ladies and gentlemen,
from a 1-0 to a 1-3.
So they've done it, but overall,
all we have a news bulletin, now that's exciting,
probably about Zada.
1115 at W.I.O.D.
Good morning, I'm Henry Beto.
I couldn't have said it better.
Anybody who's a wine connoisseur
always says an O'Shaun provocateur to it.
Anyway, it's 1116 at W.I.O.D.,
we got an open line in Broward.
How can we have a couple open lines here, man?
We're having like a little party, okay?
And we don't want you to call in and tinkle all over us.
Oh, congratulations, great number.
But if you're like in a business and you're desperate,
you wonder if you still got a job.
We'll be happy to answer it.
Now, where are the 18 to 34 numbers?
Are we gonna have to go through that same crap again?
We're the rest of the 25 to 54s,
because I know Steve is just like hanging on the edge
of his sofa by a baseball cart.
And I'm sure he wants to hear how he did 25 to 54,
because that's where the big bucks are, okay?
And all they gave us, now I didn't mention this yet.
W.I.O.D., tied for third overall, the whole week,
25 to 54 up from a 470 to a 540.
Did I mention it?
I did.
Oh, I'll mention it again.
Good.
3-3 in the summer, 470 to fall, 540 overall.
Tied for third, an AM station behind Hot and Magic.
God.
Tied with CMQ, it doesn't even count.
Nice, come up.
And a head of gloves.
Nice company.
And a head of GTR, who had a 5.
And a head, oh, you're gonna go nuts.
Ah.
No.
W.I.O.D., in 25 to 54s, beating out Waxi.
Morning, Shirley, I hate man, you hear what Tanner did this morning.
Are you here with Rick and Fred's dinner?
I'm all evidently nuts.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
Wow.
And where's the morning 25 to 54?
See, we still got a lot of holes.
I mean, it's nice they brought us in all these number,
where's the rest of them?
It's just like last time.
I remember when the trend came out.
Same thing.
Now, there's no excuses this time,
because everybody's excited and they're
probably smashed on the floor and passed out
in that computer room, okay, from the celebration.
Eight, six.
God.
It's great.
Shocking.
I don't know whether the screen read a banana, you know?
I think we just got a rest on our laurels now.
See, that's what those starts saying.
Well, you know, Neil's gotten lazy now.
They don't do any homework anymore.
They don't come in and do anything creative.
We haven't done anything creative in two years, okay?
We were told don't do anything creative.
Hey, time we try to just create if we get in trouble, okay?
So we just show up and act ignorant
and the audience relates to what kind of kind of this is.
God, it goes to prove the dumber you are
and the dumber you behave, the bigger the audience.
That's America, right?
Now, our show on Transvestite Pigmees begins in noon.
Wow, look at that.
A five one for WI of DC.
I told you, did I say to you this morning,
Johnny Dark was sitting here.
I said, we got a break of five.
There's no excuse.
This station, even with the horrendous nighttime
and weekends, which we don't want to talk about.
Once we get some of this stuff on the weekend
out of the way we get Meg back on,
that'll sure up the weekend.
Oh, yeah, like a dead weight.
It's a, no, it's a magazine.
It's so upset.
It's just a little joke.
I mean, there's some truth in it,
but it's just a little joke.
It's 11, 11, 11, 18 at WI of DC.
Don't you think somebody ought to send some food over
something because I'm not going to my mother's.
I need to get my glasses, my lenses,
my not lenses frames, because I sat on them.
We have to feed Johnny.
Johnny.
We got to feed Johnny Dark,
because he hasn't worked in years now.
Yeah.
As an even like I said, at least 20 minutes.
And we got to feed Johnny Dark
when we have a radio celebrity past or present.
And usually it's past.
We like to feed him.
I didn't feed boom boom, though, you know what?
That probably was the reason that show
was a little flat, man.
I'm sure boy.
I'm sure boy Garry will run out.
He ripped him so bad that they,
you know, never be forgiven.
God will punish you.
You'll be at the party gates.
And he'll say, I'm sorry, but we're closing the gate
for one phone call.
You were a pretty decent guy.
The rest of time you stole some albums.
We can forgive you for that.
But that called about that was unforgivable.
Oh, yeah.
Bit was.
Yeah.
Hmm.
I just, yeah.
You seem like you have a little dalyma.
Yeah, something dalyma.
Something just popped in my brain.
The dalyma on his TV receiver.
Okay.
Something popped in my brain.
What was that?
Well, there's this I-95.
Yeah, that was it.
Maybe it can be over in I-95, recording I-D.
Now, there's that old Lynn Frydas just came in the studio
ladies and gentlemen, we haven't seen her in a long time.
What was I going to ask her about?
Something about all of you.
They got those pictures.
You better go in there and beat him up, okay?
No.
And here it's Tuesday.
I'm just, don't say I didn't tell you.
They took the pictures like 10 stinking weeks ago.
We got these gigantic numbers,
which you people better start selling by the way now.
And we don't have those pictures, okay?
Now, if I go on a year and tell all these fakers out there,
we're going to have the pictures.
You better see to it that the douchebag in there gets them, okay?
That boy Gary, that's it.
Step on it.
Called Don.
Kick him in the head.
Although there's no sense out on the farm.
Yeah, get down on the farm.
The two are our pictures.
Here at WIOD, where we lie a lot, but not about the numbers, man.
And I remember the old days on IOD,
there were certain people used to kind of fudge about the numbers
a little bit or they would ignore them.
I don't want to match a day named.
But now that they're real good, we talk about them a lot.
I mean, to the point of being nauseated.
I guess Steve won't spend too much time on them today, right?
No.
Although we didn't have a 4-7 analysis out of three.
And that's in 12 plus.
And if they would ever get busy and bring us the rest of the 25 to 54s,
then you'd really see something, okay?
Because I guarantee you Steve beat him more than double,
probably triple in 25 to 54, at least.
And what do we do to...
Now, how did Sandy do 25 to 50?
Poor Sandy, we've ignored her.
I apologize.
Sandy.
Well, we had an 8-6 in 25 to 54.
Let me say it again, Lynn.
Then we had an 8-6 in 25 to 54, not one.
Sandy.
He's on the third page.
A 1-4.
Whoa.
Down from a 1-8.
On the road to nonexistent.
1-4.
Well, if you do one more show a month with that TV repairman,
she could turn the corner.
She could be on that same highway with Zeta.
I-95.
Pretty soon, you're going to see a lot of radio people in this market on I-95.
Headed North, okay?
All packed up.
Headed North, never to be seen again.
Like Steve Perrin.
On the radio bus, Steve Perrin from Y 100.
Gone.
Gone.
Oh, God.
This is terrible because we sound like we're happy.
Well, I am happy because they should only rot over at Y 100.
That's my first, not everybody over there.
There must be some nice people.
I don't know any.
Are there?
Um...
Certainly not the raw.
The David Ross.
One.
Maybe one.
There's one.
Oh, yes.
Simone used to work there.
Remember Simone?
Oh, jeez.
Gone.
All right.
And the radio shows are tough sometimes.
Yeah, they really are.
Oh, here come those numbers.
I wonder what the hell Sharon's been doing and there she's been the girlfriend.
She probably had Steve on the phone.
All is 25 to 54s except hours.
I mean ours are great, but we want to, you know, talk about what is this?
We already got that.
Morning drive like Raniri who's got a 5-3.
He stayed the same.
He's tied for 3rd and 25 to 54.
That's a big number in the morning for 25 to 54s.
Steve with a 5-5.
I think that's his biggest number ever in 25 to 54, okay?
And you know what they say about Steve.
He's an Ojoan provocateur.
He's number three.
And the only people to beat him hot who's just like going crazy and magic, 8177 and Steve with a 5-5.
What did Alice do in 25 to 54?
What is not on page two?
That's obviously not a page two.
He is on...
I like that.
Well wait a minute.
I just came to Zeta.
Afternoon drive 25 to 54 or 25 up from a 2-4.
I still have to come to.
Here's wins.
1-9 to a 2-1.
Here's she.
2-3 to a 1-8.
Oh here's Alice.
Way down here.
From a 1-8 to a 1-6.
Now did I say Steve would you triple or more?
Three times 1-6 is a 4-8.
So he did like 3 and a half times.
God.
In 25 to 54, okay, Alice.
Oh God.
You know, I really hate to do this.
I don't believe in rubbing salt on the water.
I really don't.
The level is a little low on that particular machine.
Oh no, I wonder if anybody would hear the word.
Nice one.
Okay 24 pounds 11.
Just a little sampling there for Alice.
Phil Beckman is on the phone who wants some more numbers here.
I don't think he's going to want to hear him when we get through.
What do you want Phil?
I just want to see what the winner book you wanted to see what?
The winner book for the phone book on She's Morning Show.
Okay, here's another one of these guys who wants to see what.
I wasn't on the winner at 12.
I want to know.
Oh, well let's see.
6 to 10 am 12 plus.
Yeah.
Just relax now Phil.
Don't get the hype problem.
I'm going to turn a lot of pages to get to your numbers.
I'm sure.
Okay, she, well, I ran the top of the fourth page.
That's not bad.
A one, two, and a winner book.
12 plus.
Boy, that's pretty weak.
And, um, oh, you want to see the fall book.
Yeah.
Oh, well that's good.
1, 7.
Oh, good, all right, please.
So that's a half a point drop.
Now 25 to 54, you want those?
Oh, why not?
Of course.
What the hell?
Pointy-five to 54.
She, I have to turn several pages to get to that.
Yeah, like maybe one more I think.
Wow, where is it?
Here it is.
A two one in the fall.
That's not too bad.
A point nine in a winner.
So you want to feel really good.
They must have missed me.
Yeah.
Now I'm left after the fall book.
They're dying over there.
Congratulations.
It goes without saying.
Thank you Phil.
See ya.
Bye.
Well, it's 11.25 with a big shite.
Let's tell you about shells right now.
Yeah.
I can be arrogant now, but when the day comes that we have that flip book and we got like a one or something then.
Then it'll be a different story.
And I'll be dancing on our graves out there in a hallway and Disney will be looking in with an ugly look and spike wise.
They'll be frowning and throwing telephones through the wall.
You know, the evil stuff that goes on every day.
And the salespeople will have it.
They had another excuse.
Anyway, it's just a joke, Linda.
I'll get hyper, okay?
It's, well, it's partly a joke.
We want to get you out to shells for a great dinner because I don't have time for this.
Okay, we're busy talking here.
And then we have to keep coming back, you know.
Well, maybe if we played some interesting stuff, we, you know, the people that don't care about the ratings, they want to be entertained too, right?
He's back.
And he's stalking a psycho who wants to make the Chicago Cubs pennant contenders.
Clint Eastwood is dirty Harry Carey.
Oh, everybody.
This is Harry Carey with Steve Stone and the culture goodness speed out of them today.
Clint Eastwood gives a Hall of Fame performance as the legendary Cubs broadcaster.
There's action.
The pitch.
Strike it to the, he's through that bull right past park.
Suspense.
It's sniping.
It could be.
It is a foward.
The romance.
Oh, look at the t*** on that broadsteep.
Holy cow.
Clint Eastwood is dirty Harry Carey.
Coming to a theater near you.
Are we back?
See what I mean?
We're busy doing stuff and hearing this stuff keeps ending.
We've got to play like something long.
Well, not that.
Okay, it's 130 at WIOD.
I see the reason I'm not taking any calls is because like they're only forced to.
It can cause you audiences obviously are rebelling against this.
They can't deal with it.
They're revolting.
Even more revolting than that.
Yesterday for a Monday we did very well.
Yeah.
Not a great show, but for a Monday it was pretty them solid.
You know what I'm saying?
We had actually a lot of calls.
No, no, most of them we didn't even have to do that.
So I guess everybody in the business has got all the information they went on.
Now where are the 18 to 34 numbers?
If Sharon can hear us, if she's within the sound of my voice, where are those stinking 80?
Why do they do this every time?
Every time.
I don't know.
I realize, see they don't, when I first came here they kept giving me this 35 plus.
I said, this, I said forget that.
It's 25 to 54.
See they still didn't believe that on AM you can really do it.
Now here we are with only an 8.6 and 25 to 54 in the day.
And Steve's got a 5.5 and Renewer's got a 5.3 so we're like kicking ass all across the board.
Like I said, they'll 6.00 PM in 25 to 54.
But 18 to 34, now we went from a 0.6 when we came here.
Last trend we had a 5.5 and 18 to 34, which for AM is like an a twilight zone.
It's meaningless except it's an ego trip for us.
And since in this business they're usually deflating your ego all they can do,
at least on ratings day when they're good, the least you can do is you know, go on the air and curl about it.
Yeah, because it's the one thing they can't stop.
You know, here they are.
Well, the only way they stop it is not by you.
And I think that what's in there right there?
I think I'm going to speak to it now because I just saw old watch's name there in the hallway.
He doesn't speak to it.
How about if we got a 10?
What would it take?
Now seriously, this is going to be our poll question.
What number and we need to get to for Phil to speak to you.
I don't know.
About a 15 share.
Now here's a bike wise.
I bet you think you got 18 to 34 stores.
Here he is.
He's going to sit down.
Don't get comfortable.
Oh, he's coming out of my mind too.
This is my mind.
What a maniac.
18 to 34.
Wait, let me give you the phone to throw through the wall here just like that.
Hold on, I can even Disney smoking now.
Look at that.
Look where he's got this cigar too.
Shocking.
What does that say for GTR?
Wow.
What is that?
What do you make these up?
10, 7 and what?
Do I take these under 12?
Take these under 12.
Pull away, right?
You hot beat.
But your number two, 10 so hot beat them.
That a 14 9.
Well, sure.
Once in a while I'll get a fluke.
Now next is POW.
What is this?
This is the week?
Yeah.
Oh, power had a 75.
Love had a 5.
Six.
Thank you so much.
Now what are these?
Oh, here's midday.
Hot had a 13.
Oh, I'm telling you.
That key guy's me has got electric crayons.
That guy's nuts.
Seriously, if you'd start eating fish eggs, I'm telling you.
The work for you every time.
The guy is incredible.
13 for hot and midday.
18 to 34.
GTR had a 10 8 up from what?
I'm going to need a four.
Yeah.
Power had a 6 5 down a tenth of a point.
Gloves had a 6 2.
And IOD was number 5.
In 18 to 34 with a 6 1.
I think this means we got you, Neil.
Oh, yeah, but our people can spell.
Waxy had a fine-form at day.
Oh, geez.
You know, he's going to be real unhappy over there.
You know how emotionally he gets.
I think it's pretty emotional.
That's the kind of stuff that we strive for.
Well, maybe one day you'll achieve it.
Joy with a 4 5.
Why 100 midday?
18 to 34 down to a 4 4.
And what about morning drive?
I did that a lot of 100 because, yeah.
How did it turn out?
Let's get there.
18 to 34 morning drive.
GTR 9 1 to a 12 0.
Ooh.
That was number 2.
I was like 14 6.
Nothing I hate more than a guy crowing a lot.
You asked for the adult 18 to 34.
I just said Joe, can I stop getting emotional now?
Oh, the kernel was up.
Ah!
He's done to the roof.
3 3 to a 3 8.
Wow.
He has.
Hold those I-95.
Yeah, we have a 10 5.
Look at this.
Sandy, 18 to 34 was down from a 1 to 4 to a 0.3.
A 0.3.
That's like you could put them in auditorium and, okay.
Ah!
And have room left over.
Where the hell is Zeta?
18 to 31.
Where is that Gonser now?
Come on, Gons.
Look at that.
Look at that.
4 2.
There's the story.
Gonser had a 4 2 in midday.
I'm going to do that other stuff.
I know you're not going to give it to us.
You won't relinquish it.
No.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
Okay, let's see.
6 to 10 a.m.
Who are we looking for?
Look like she had a good book, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They turned the corner.
They turned the same quarter that Zeta turned.
Did you hear any rumor about Zeta?
No.
They're going dance music.
Oh, I want to see Alice.
18 to 31.
They're going to be I-95.
I-95?
Come on, back.
He's gone.
I-O-D.
Let's see.
He's gone.
He's going.
Still in the building.
Going.
I-O-D-3-3.
18 to 30.
He's going to be 40 afternoon.
And Alice, I bet you Alice had a number that will live in the Anals of broadcast history.
0.5.
Down from a 1-4.
So he lost.
Two-thirds he lost two of those three people that he had.
Well, you talk about jury entry.
Okay, thank you so much.
Well, you're welcome.
Anytime.
What was that on GTR again for?
7-6 to 10-7.
See, if you would, if you'd open your eyes, which I know for you isn't easy, you'd notice
that the first two trends of every book for GTR, you get screwed.
Okay.
There's a pattern there.
If you go back over the last two years, it's the same pattern every time.
And the third month, they finally get the sampling right and it goes way up.
And then you get the number.
So instead of getting hysterical and counting and giving us a bunch of crap,
grow up a little bit.
Well, yeah.
Have a cigar.
Exactly.
If you want one right spot, we'll even light it for you.
Okay.
Okay, there he goes.
I'm going to spit on the jar of WGTR, state and scream.
Scream.
It's 11.35 in WIOD and don't forget this Saturday now.
This could be kind of like our rating celebration.
We're going to have free bagels and hot dogs and all kinds of goodies there.
And lots of bumper stickers.
Steve's got those new bumper stickers and I got the old ones.
And we might even have the pictures.
And of course, they've got loads and loads of...
All right, wait a minute.
We've had all these rumors today.
We do like to be fair.
We just had a report from Rose over in Carroll City.
It might not be as bad as everyone say.
Yeah.
Sonny wants...
Well, in a hundred mornings, 18 to 34, well, it's too late.
He already spiked to come back.
Oh, yeah, those are...
Sonny, you got to be a little quicker on the draw.
He's giving you every other pain in the ass while 100 number.
Now, just bug off.
They're...
The program director is gone.
You got to be dancing a jiff.
Absolutely.
And a three-year-old program director, right?
He's gone, Sonny.
You're not great.
Gone.
Wait a second, Jose.
Yeah.
With bells on his nose and rings on his feet.
He really blew this market up.
Remember what I always say about when we have a good trend or something?
Oh, you're gonna look at the phone.
True.
Yeah, three lines.
I'm not saying we take any.
Yeah.
But it's sure...
See, it's the way of evening things out in this market.
You can never have a big ego.
The numbers come in.
You can have this...
You normally can have an 80-year-old.
And they would...
Wow, we're not gonna talk to him today.
We don't want to get him to get a big head, you know?
Well, screw you folks, too.
Okay, that's the way we feel about it.
We sure appreciate your loyalty.
Have a nice day and go to hell.
Like someone that mail we get, you know?
Remember that one thing where they sent me that information
and about you'd really enjoy this.
And then the letter went on and just ripped it off.
Oh, sure.
About the car phones.
Yeah.
And said, these are good.
These are great models.
I have two of them.
They really work really well.
They do align.
You were lying on the rest of the letter.
I've seen it rip, I've seen it rip.
Yeah, okay.
It's incredible.
All right, we're gonna give the numbers out one time.
And then we'll assume that we've totally bored our regular list.
Look at that.
That they're all three lines in data.
Let the whole rest of the board is as blank as the management's brain.
Wow.
Thank you.
It's like a giant vacuum.
We don't particularly appreciate your attitude, okay folks?
Oh, but we can always count on this call, right?
Yeah, you know, I don't think that-
But things are really dead.
Oh, now they're going nuts.
As soon as they heard your voice, they called it a process.
I don't think there was ever any question that you guys would have achieved greatness.
Yeah, I'll say it.
Probably because of your calls, right?
I didn't say that.
Or is it in spite of your calls?
In spite of my calls.
Are you gonna be there Saturday, Paul?
Where's that?
At Toyota Hommie.
How many?
You want?
Are you gonna be there, Gordon?
No.
No, he's coming to the next window.
He finally embarrassed the sales department into getting him in on these things.
I said from now on after this one, yeah.
Okay, are we ever gonna have one of these non-radio type get-togethers?
Or that's not gonna happen?
I don't see why not.
Yeah, because those are fun.
We could have like an old E-Mac and Bollio's reunion now that the restaurant's out of business.
There you go.
Well, they're on fault.
Now that they govern themselves accordingly.
They're on fault.
Right out of business.
But anyway, you know, with all these poor ratings,
there are so many talented people out of work out there.
Really, Johnny just raised his hand.
Johnny, dark, for example.
And all during the breaks, he's been going,
I, ninety-huh.
He does you pretty well, too.
Well, thirty-five to sixty-four just came in.
This ought to be a really heavy duty for Alice.
First of all, when we get to the sixty-plus party.
I, not ninety-five.
That was kind of like a twinkie type station, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was kind of like, why?
I went a hundred.
Now I could just picture a man.
A man.
Yeah, I could see a man on a high, high, ninety-five.
I could picture it.
I could picture it.
Let's see, thirty-five to sixty-four.
I wonder how we did in that category.
Probably not too great.
Ten to three.
Look at that.
We were second.
Life had an eight-nine.
We had a seven-eight.
How the hell is that?
Well, we must have, like mostly thirty-five to fifty-four.
Right?
Mm-hmm.
Must have.
That is John on this.
Seven-eight.
Well, we just kicked ass everywhere, didn't we?
Well, that'll show those brain dead sales people
a thing or two.
Steve and the afternoon had a five-seven, up from a five-six, five-seven.
And Alice still don't show too good, because until they get to sixty-five plus,
don't you snooze, don't show too much.
Yeah, two-nine to a two-two in the afternoon, thirty-five to sixty-four.
So their audience is almost all sixty-five plus.
I'd be embarrassed.
You know what I'm saying?
Sounds like a lot of preparation.
Wow.
Now what are they giving away fiber one?
They're trying to keep their few listeners alive over there.
All right, well, again, congratulations and you guys are by far the bus.
Oh, is he gone?
He's gone.
Huh?
Well, I do want to talk some more to him.
Oh, no.
Because I didn't.
No, no.
He's okay, but boy, it's very small dose is like about ten words at a time.
Okay, it's eleven forty-one at WID.
We're going to give these numbers out, and then we expect to see some incredible action in this studio, okay?
Action?
Well, it's food action.
That's right.
Oh, yeah.
Mentally and physically.
We have to see work in years, okay?
Yeah.
751 WIOG and Dave.
We want you to call it and tinkle all over everybody here.
Now, come on, call it and say how great it was, even though you don't mean it, even though you couldn't care less, okay?
Now, do we have a separate column like for douchebags?
Because I know we're number one in douchebags.
You know, question about it.
No contest.
Let's see, an open line in Dave, one in brown, five, two, four WID.
And then if we can get vocal it, we get those other three lines lit.
Wow.
We'll have the full board of calls.
So we've been waiting for all more.
See, I don't really care about the numbers.
I like to see a full board of calls because you know what stands is I have the busy signal thing complex, whatever he calls it.
Syndrome.
And then he gets down to two calls and starts, starts hyperventilating on the air with a cigar.
Wow.
Okay, there's bokeh now.
We get that other brown line going there, even if it's, you know who?
Now, while you're waiting on that, I want to give you this little tidbit.
That was the terrain point for us, by the way.
You know, I'm dying over there.
That was a, you have a delima?
Yeah.
Well, it's in the new inquire.
I just want to, I just want to, I just noticed this in the new inquire.
I just want to read this to you.
Michael Jackson got all the time in the world for Powell, Marlon Brando.
He gave his buddy a one million dollar antique pocket watch for his 65th birthday.
Just wanted sort of the, put that out.
So you could, which pocket did he put it in?
Yeah.
And once he was wearing his glove, those are the things that America's firing mind want to know.
Okay, and that's the kind of information that we strive for, underlined in red.
It is underlined in red.
Look at that.
Yeah, we have a witness.
It's underlined in red.
Well, pink.
Without Ricky Tiki-Man, he, he kind of gave us the guidance.
He was like the, inspiring, the guiding light for this show.
And without him and without those talk up.
Not seriously.
So matter of fact, I think in honor.
Yeah.
Good.
I don't know why you're laughing.
I'm dead serious about this.
This is not, this is not laughing kind of stuff.
This is a heavy duty serious stuff now, okay?
To try to control yourself.
Well, we went a long time without these.
Yeah, to hear him again.
He spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to tell you that happened.
And one of the ways, one of the very easy and inexpensive, underlined in red, ways of
doing that is doing what you enjoy.
Thanks, those things.
How you doing?
Oh, Ricky.
Oh.
See, even he's excited.
That was shocking, wasn't it?
I think we ought to add another point out of waxing numbers.
That's so lovely.
Just an honor of that talk up.
Okay, that was shocking.
That was beautiful.
Ricky, we take back everything we've ever said about you.
You're a genius in your own mind, okay?
And if you ever took that cap off, your brains would spill all over the radio dial.
Shocking.
Wow.
Line six is down.
Oh, it's down.
That's why I didn't lie.
Line six is dead.
I think it's probably from the pressure from these calls here today.
It's, hello.
Oh, yeah, Dennis.
Yeah, say me, you pal.
I wasn't Dennis Rees again, either, I'll tell you.
Okay, 1144, WI.
See, now I don't feel so bad.
If we could say that about three or four of the lines were out, then I'd feel better.
Even if they're not, say that they're out.
It's just wonderful.
And then I'll feel better.
Oh, here's a Pembroke Pines GT R listener.
I bet you spike will go nuts on this call.
Yeah.
Didn't know how many of these things you guys went.
What?
I don't know.
Spike was mentioning it.
And they're not on at the same time, pal.
Wait a minute.
What was Spike bragging about?
Because in 18 to 34 GT R had a, what do they have?
Like a tension for it.
In midday, we had a 6-1.
Yeah.
Also, the whole station B W R D.
No.
No, I would be at a 5-1.
They had a 4.
What was the guy who had a GT R D, you guys?
I just got through telling you 18 to 34.
That's their audience.
I got a bunch of, how old are you?
I'm 30.
Well, there you go.
18 to 34, a bunch of young pinheads.
Space cadets.
You just don't want to give someone in being credit.
We're credit to do.
They're great, man.
I think we just have some fun with them.
Don't you understand?
And if they ever got an act, they'd really be good.
Yeah.
Well, McBean was out Monday, so the ratings in the next book will drop a little.
Yeah, just a hair.
Yeah.
If we can say that.
He probably got more than one.
I wouldn't be surprised.
And he'll probably tell you where it is to know when that filthy show they got.
Okay, listen, have a great life.
Okay, right.
Yeah, those thermodynamic beam listeners, well, they're very uptight, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
See, part of the reason that they finally have gone up though is because we're not on FM in the morning anymore.
Oh, sure.
If you just got probably listened to us on Zeta, he doesn't want to admit it because he doesn't want to hurt their feelings.
They're so sensitive.
Oh, yeah.
And you notice they sent us overall their bad material now that they won't use on either.
What do you think they're trying to tell us something?
Well, yeah.
They're hoping they can get our numbers down a little bit.
Okay, we do have an open line in Dave County.
I just mentioned that and one in Broward now.
Oh, man, I'll tell you this is so deflating.
I feel like we got a one.
Wouldn't it be nice to have...
See, I'm one of those people I expect too much.
I really do expect too much.
I expect people to care and they don't care.
They don't give a fly and leap one more time.
And that's my problem, especially in this town.
We saw that at the beginning of the show.
We proved it with that scientific poll we took on the phone.
They don't care.
And at least they're honest about it.
Okay.
They're not going to tinkle all over.
Oh, yeah, we care.
They don't care.
Don't bother us.
We want to be left alone.
And I can relate to that.
The receptionist from WQAM would like the morning ratings.
Oh, man.
You know that receptionist.
He's an Ojohn provocateur.
Okay. WQAM in the morning ladies and gentlemen,
6 to 10 AM, which is kind of moot because they got the...
Motherly over there now.
Now they do.
WQAM, I'm on the last page and I'm still searching.
Here they are second from the bottom.
Tied for last with WRHC, you know, speaking of English.
0.7.
God.
Which is up from a 0.6.
And it was up from a 0.4 before that in the summer.
Motherly, it's a take care of them.
Motherly will get them up to at least a 0.8.
And in 20...
25 to 54 is in the morning.
I know that he's an Ojohn provocateur.
In the morning...
Where in the hell are they?
I can see how they...
Oh, here we go.
I got all these sheets.
I got real sheet problems here.
6 to 10 in the morning, 25 to 54.
I bet you they're on the last sheet of this bat.
Start at the back and go away down.
EAT, well that's not in the market.
Rockin' Big Daddy.
Radio Suave.
She with a 0.9 is right down there and QAM tied them.
There's a three-way tie for next to last.
QAM, QAM Radio Suave.
When you're tied with Radio Suave.
Yeah.
You know, you're out of the business, okay?
Yeah.
And we want to congratulate John Tanagami over there at Chief
or consistently, month in, month out, book it and book out.
Just suck in the big one at Chief, okay?
I mean, just absolutely with that gigantic 100,000 watch
and let you can hear from coast to coast all over the world practically
with no audience.
Nothing.
You think Rose Folger's something.
At least he's got 10 or 12 listeners.
At she...
No, that's anyhow bad it is.
They don't even use arbitrarity anymore.
They sent out a search product.
They can't find anybody.
And you know, all those people are going to have those old sheet bumper stickers.
They haven't listened to it in two years.
No.
So don't go by that stuff.
Anyway, it's 12 minutes till noon.
And if you're ready now to satisfy that hunger,
I know a lot of people in this audience have a physical and a mental hunger, okay?
Now we try to satisfy the mental hunger by giving you a little food for thought.
Not too much.
Just a little tiny bit once in a while.
Yeah.
Like, I'm dying over here.
That should do it for this audience.
But if you want to satisfy that physical hunger...
Yeah, she did.
Okay, it's 11.52 in the middle of the night.
We have another rumor.
And I'm not going to mention Ames.
Go on a rumor today, buddy.
But somebody from the morning show on Zeta,
this is in line with that rumor that we heard earlier, which they're vigorously denying.
Oh, yeah.
Someone is called somebody else in the business that he used to work for for a reference,
which means he's looking for a job.
Huh.
Huh.
He's an Ojoan Provacator.
Huh.
Hi, 95.
Well, when they said they turned the corner, man,
what do they know that they'd be peeking out from behind that fence?
At that big sprawling expressway.
I want to congratulate the DOT, by the way, on their ingenious job.
Because when I go like up to Poppano Park, and you go up 95 from where I am to Atlantic Boulevard,
they've to get rid of the old white lines in the road, what they've done.
And a lot of places, they'll paint them over in black, so it blends in with the highway, with the tar.
Not here.
They scrape them off, and what they do is they dig these two big ridges in the road.
So now you've got two huge ridges in the road, and the last two miles before you get to the Atlantic Boulevard exit,
they've tarred over in the right-hand lane, two-thirds of the lane.
So the rest of the lane is of like an inter-too-lower, and here are all these cars in every lane,
more so than usual, swarving and puking and all of a sudden.
Please give the top twenty-twelf plus numbers after the news.
Thanks from Arab.
We got an Arab that owns this to, I don't know, I can't read this.
Arab?
Whoever it is.
Okay, we'll give anything you want.
Okay, anything that'll kill some time and bore the rest of our audience.
Because this is our way of punishing them, of getting back.
What's the month we get a chance to get into the audience by punishing them with the money?
So these tedious, boring, terminal numbers that are enough to make you puke your guts out, and speaking of that, where's lunch?
Well, seriously, Johnny Dark is in here a one-time incredibly famous radio celebrity.
Well, and he hasn't worked in a long time, and he's like a chipmunk.
He's gearing up like a squirrel.
That's why he's got all this weight on, because he's afraid that one of these days.
And we need some food in here.
And I think Carmine would send food over today on our great celebratory of Tuesday.
Celebrating the entire IODTR, sure.
Or someone.
Shucks.
Shucks.
Well, let's see, that's a big preparation when they have to go through.
That will someone will.
And maybe Arnold over at the hamburger thing.
Oh.
See, I love char-hut, but char-hut is the nearest one is so far away, I don't think it's going to happen in the United.
But Arnold over there with those real castles, they were incredible.
Oh, they were incredible.
Great.
We had those the other last week.
Wow.
Shocking.
They were.
They were.
1154 at IODT.
After the new news for those of you planning on tuning out, we'll be reading the top 20 in order.
12 plush.
Okay.
We're going to bring in boom boom to read.
We have an open line and brown right.
Right.
24 WID and here comes Sharon with more ponderous numbers.
Okay, I was just about to take a call and thank God you came in with this.
These are 18 to 34.
Oh, so I can't.
It's not a fosh sign.
You still listening to that?
Yeah, of course.
Of course.
Okay, we're getting.
No, let's attend to three.
We had a 6-1.
Now, look at what it was when we came here.
It was a .6.
What?
Alice had a point something.
We already looked at a .3.
How to go.
That a girl, Alice.
Almost off the air.
What was I looking for now?
Sonny Fox and Amori is desperate for his 18 to 34.
And that's the one Sharon didn't bring in here.
So blame Sharon for it.
Not me.
Oh, here it is.
6 to 10 am.
I got it.
Okay.
6 to 10, hot with a 14, 6 and a morning, 18 to 34.
GTR with a 12.
I said it again, Bill, 12.
Okay, you're happy now, you idiot.
Well, I 100 with a 7, down from an 8, 8.
Wow.
7, 1 from an 8, 8, down.
1.7, I'd say about a fourth, fifth.
Down 20%.
Great.
18 to 34.
And of course, that's the meat and potatoes of those rocky,
socky, jockey music intensive pinhead stations for those young pre-pubescent idiots.
Right?
A rendish.
Yeah.
They got that Donnie Osborne show.
I think I'll put them over the top.
He's out of town on the bus with Steve Watson and Quintet.
Zeta.
6 to 10 am, 18 to 34 from a 3, 3 to a 3, 8.
But like we said, the two books ago, and we were there at 10 to 5.
So they've only lost two thirds of that audience.
So no wonder the kernel is a desperately seeking references, huh?
No, we wish them luck.
We wish them luck.
And the guy only knows how to lead it.
Miami, hello.
And die in over here.
Hold on.
Come on, Rose.
It's not that bad.
Or was that Tim Williams?
Now, when guys work together long enough, they start sounding alike.
I mean, one more time now.
I'm dying, I'm opening up.
Oh, that was Tim Williams, right?
And we don't want to speak ill of Tim because he does have young children.
And you know how you motion-legate.
What is that?
Did you hear somebody cackling and laying a big on it?
Is that a hallway?
Yeah, I thought that was on the phone.
Is that on the phone?
What was that?
That was incredible.
Somebody's goosing April in the hallway, I think.
You better check it out.
West Palm Beach, hello.
I just called to tank on your tanko-tanko.
I can't talk long so I'll call you later.
Okay.
Now let's not start that now, okay?
With the last ten minutes of the show every day, we reserve for that.
But I can't deal with a lot of them.
Too old to deal with four hours of that, all right?
Yeah.
Should we try Boka?
Because we actually got like a couple of calls on it.
We're not overwhelming, but we got a few.
Boka, hello.
Yeah, like I said.
Yeah.
It's pretty grim.
Well, they don't even know anything about radio and Boka.
And if you've ever heard of WSBR at all, like living proof of it.
Okay, we have a Boka line open, 278WIOD.
There it goes.
And the Palm Beach line, come on, Lee.
Now I know just before you go on the air, you'd love to hear if J&O showed up the answers no.
So I guess you don't have to call.
J&O just didn't, WR-MF showed a little bit like they always do.
Like a little fraction, you know?
WR-MF.
Let's try a pinhead and broward.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing, pal?
Hi, congratulations on your numbers.
Well, thanks so much.
They don't mean much, do they?
But it's nice to see him in print.
But I was wondering if you give me so much travel tips.
I'm getting next week I'm going on vacation.
Yeah.
First I'm flying to Chicago for a day.
Oh, you're going to go see the Cubs?
I'm like, I'm only going to be there like three hours.
Well, that's good because you get really depressed if you went to WR-MF.
And then from there I'm going to California.
So I was wondering if you could give me something no good places.
Like I think I'm going to go ahead and report for like three hours, is it?
Yeah, well, that'll give you just enough time to change planes at O'Hare.
Really?
Yeah, that's a mess.
That's the worst airport you just, you're probably tearing your hair out at O'Hare.
That's why they call it O'Hare.
Some people call it no-here.
And then where are you going to California?
Los Angeles.
Los Angeles.
Well, take a gas mask with you.
I don't want to get you depressed before this trip.
But take a gas mask.
You can't read the air the smog is so thick you could cut it with a butter knife, okay?
But I got to that's why I'm only staying like four days ago.
Yeah, well by the end of that time when you come back I know at Mount Sinai they got a good unit where they give you like oxygen, you know, pure oxygen for a day or two.
Other than that have a great time, okay?
Are you going to call us from out there?
I'm going to call you from Chicago because I think it's going to be at the same time day in the show.
Excellent.
And then I'll call you from LA.
And no problem you'll be able to get right through.
Trust me.
I'll be 267.
Any line.
No, 655.
655.
655.
Write it on your sleeve, okay?
Okay.
I have a great trip.
Bye.
Bye.
Wow.
Okay, we have an open line in Broward at 524WID considering one of the Broward lines is out.
That's not saying an awful lot for you stiffs up there and we do have an open line in Palm Beach at 655WID.
655, ooh look at that, a Palm Beach call. Are you there?
Brow.
Are you ready to speak to us?
Yeah.
Well we got to do the news. Are you going to hold on?
Okay.
You sure?
Yeah.
We're not imposing on you are we?
No.
Okay, hold on.
Not that we care about it, you know, it sounds polite.
What about Mike?
Can we give Mike these numbers?
But we'll do it all again after the news.
In fact, we'll do it like every 50 minutes kind of like the NFL draft, okay?
Every number.
We'll get even with those sports people, man.
Every number you want to know and something.
I never hope you never hear again.
5-1-W-I-O-D-N-D-A-D.
524WID in Broward.
Or 655 and 278WID in the Palm Beach.
Other areas make all collect.
The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station.
Now, here's Neil Rogers, our new stock radio 610W-I-O-D.
Okay, we've got to count down those tough 20 and 12 plus, but Johnny Dark says he won't
relinquish the power.
Now I have.
Oh, you got it.
I was looking at it.
Where is the food?
This is supposed to be our big ratings part, huh?
What a party, huh?
And even boy Gary won't complain if we get food in here today.
He would go nuts.
He'd probably eat some of it.
He'd be so excited.
He was yanking on those suspenders.
I thought he was going to have an accident, a radio accident.
Okay, here we go.
This is 12 plus.
This is the entire week for those of you who have no idea what this is about.
I got news for it.
We don't care, okay?
This show is basically for those poor shoulders in this business.
Those downtrodden, those abused, those overused and whipped and beaten and destroyed poor souls
who have put their entire lives into this business and gotten as a reward of slapping the face.
A kick into pants.
A patch in Tuchas, okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, we can relate to that.
Because that's what we all strive for.
It's to be like boom, boom.
And if Johnny Dark doesn't get a job pretty soon, he's going to wipe up like that.
Or at least get fed today anyway.
This is embarrassing.
Okay, top 20, 12 plus.
Hot.
And 8-3, and we congratulate Keith Eisley and all those other douchebags over there for this miracle
that he's done with crayons mirrors and fish eggs.
Life with a 7-1, they don't count.
They just do not count.
What are you doing now?
You don't really like a little stub of a cigar like that?
Stub rhymes with slub.
Bub, leave me alone.
Number 3, W-I-O-D with a 5-1.
I wasn't at the first time they broke into 5 like since Mathusela's grandmother died.
Something like that.
W-Q-B-A, a 5.
Power from a 4-4 to a 4-3.
Magic, a 4-2 bouncing back up from a 3-9.
Well, if they keep playing in purple people either though, they're going to have some problems.
W-G-T-R, this is the one we really want to emphasize because spikewise is dancing the twist in the hallway.
And if he keeps playing those chubby checker records, man, he's ever really out of drop like a rock.
From a 2-8 up to a 4, they're number 7.
Number 8, he's an Ozone provocateur.
With a 3-9, we had a tie for a 3-9, W-A-Q-Y that's Radio Mumbi.
And Waxi.
Waxi was tied with Radio Mumbi.
Wow, that is shocking, isn't it?
You can listen, I have for a half hour for this.
And there is absolutely nothing on the air except this guy is a jerk.
That lady is a whatever ass on it, on it, on it, on it, on it.
Okay, number 10, I pertest between Y-100 with a 3-8 and W-C-M-Q with a 3-8.
Kiss.
As in kiss this was 12th with a 3-4.
Love 94 gloves, you're one of your favorite radio stations.
Oh yeah, they all love you and you're the one.
Especially the afternoon lady you love with a passion.
And I hope she never calls me again or leaves me a message.
13th with a 3-3, down from a 3-4, but about a flip.
They had pretty good demos.
They had a few people under 100.
W-S-News ladies and gentlemen, this deserves its own special little something.
Number 14, and dropping like a dime, dropped from the top story of the Empire State Building,
dropping like a pebble in the Grand Canyon.
W-S-News from a, listen to this, summer 4-8, fall 3-6.
And now in the winter time, a 3-2.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Mmm.
That's not things are not good at W-S-News.
Ooh.
Yeah.
W-I-N-Z at 3-1, 15th.
So those two are like kind of like neck and neck, right together there with the tidy bullman.
Number 16, W-T-M-I for our pseudo intellectuals of 3.
I'm not interested in the summer they had a 3 and the fall 2-9 in our 3-1.
It's like there's a straight line.
It's basically that same group of 15,000 average quarter hour pseudo intellectuals
who claimed to listen to that classical gas or get gas while they listen to the Mason Williams would say.
Joy FM.
Oh, joy forever is a thing of beauty.
This is a story.
Type 417 from a 4 to a 2-7 big story.
I would super-acquew.
Yeah, that's WQB AFM of 2-7.
Jumped out.
They really fell.
We can leap off the page.
They fell.
And leapyly.
Yeah.
And the Leros, which is coming up next time around W-I-N-Z.
W-E-D-R 19th with a 2-5 with that whopping signal theirs.
Look at their trend from a 4-5 in a summer than a 3-9 at 2-5.
It looks like Heath Isleys putting E-D-R to sleep.
And they're pretty p-o-d about it too, by the way.
They're not too happy.
And then of course rounding out the top 20 not to be left out.
W-X-D-J as an X-flax.
From that 2-4 from those heavy days of that fluke month that gave them that fall book of a 2-4 down to a 1-8.
Holding up following those briefly, she with a 1-7, Zeta with a 1-6, W-E-A-T-F-M with a 1-2,
followed by CMQ-R-H-C-F-D-L-K-A-T with a point A.
We shouldn't leave them out because they did show up.
M-B-M, Q-A-M with a point A, then radio swave with a point 7.
The motivation station about whom we've seen two articles this month didn't show on any page,
any category, any demographic.
They didn't make it.
It's true.
A non-measured val audience.
And they got two pages in South Florida magazine.
How do you like that?
To show you that those speakers in South Florida magazine really know the pulse of the radio market.
They give them two pages and they don't have one listener, okay?
Except for Captain Dave.
Well, they're one.
They give them one listener.
Maybe he'll continue to be motivated by that for the time being.
So there?
Where's J-A-N-O?
Where's...
J-A-N-O doesn't show.
Oh, right.
Super-surf didn't show up.
That's because most people still can't fight it on their radio dials, okay?
A van Patrick were still alive.
They'd be doing a least a one, two, okay?
Trust me when I say it.
All right.
We'll do a little break and then we'll get to your inane calls,
which probably have nothing to do with any of this.
It's 11 past noon at WIOD.
Indeed.
And it says you should send one of your sales people out.
Yeah, that'll take care of it, Rich.
You got a little thing here from Rich Pacti, which we appreciate,
but sending one of our sales people out, you know, follow up a lead,
is like sending out the Sherlock Holmes to follow a detective story.
And he's been dead for like...
Well, he was never even born, okay?
Like most of our sales people.
Okay, it's 1214 at WIOD.
We deeply apologize.
We're so sorry that we're boring you with this stuff.
And if you believe that.
Okay, Steve, today, sex surrogates, are they really therapist
or are they just a bunch of cheap horrors, okay?
Are they prostitutes?
God forbid.
And his guest will be Merlin Volker and Reverend Rick Patterson.
And as I said before, Reverend Rick gets really nervous
when he hears about any new erections in some of the things
we have a little building, a moratorium.
A Palm Beach is holding, right?
What is he holding, though? That's the question.
Well, see, it's my fault. I forgot about you, right?
I guess.
Yeah, see, I said we're going to get you after the news,
and now it's like 10 minutes later, right?
True.
And you're getting pretty tired of it, right?
No.
Okay.
Not near. Just come and say it.
You got to do a great job.
That's correct.
You're kicking butt some data.
Yeah.
And you're doing better on IAD.
Yeah.
And we don't have to get up at 4.30 in the stinkin' morning
and come in and look at Ugly Rose folder
with a sour look on his face.
True.
And that alone is where the price of emission.
Well, listen, is that it?
Yeah.
You mean you held on all that time to say something nice?
Why not?
Well, we'll send you a prize in the mail, okay?
Don't hold your breath. Have a great day.
Thank you, Mark.
Thanks a lot.
What a nice guy.
In Palm Beach, no less.
Wow.
Shocking, and he sounded like he was under 100.
Let's send him over to Alice Boy.
He needs they are.
They are like, yeah.
Oh, my God.
In fact, I wonder if we got something in here
that would kind of be fitting for them today, you know?
In the rack, we've only got, like,
listen to that hollow sound there.
What is that?
Is Rick Sqar in the book?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Is Don on the phone?
Or is Rick Sqar in the building?
Boy, I have never heard that.
A hollow kind of sound.
Oh.
Okay, now this really frosted my ass.
Okay, look at this question on the screen.
What is Steve's rating?
He's interested.
Didn't you hear how we just went nuts?
Is he on the phone?
Steve, we gave him out.
You did great.
We were like tinkling all over you.
And I was rushing through these to get to your numbers
and compare to Alice who you just buried.
All right, we shouldn't say that after that last thing there.
Steve had a 4-7 in 12 plus and a 5-5 in 25 to 54.
I think those are as highest numbers ever in this market.
I could be wrong.
But I don't think so.
I think those are huge numbers.
Way up, 39 to a 4-7 in 12 plus and a 5-5 in 25 to 54.
Alice had a 3 in 12 plus just hovering going into the twos,
diving into the bowl with the tidy bowl man.
And what was it in 25 to 54?
A 1-6 to Steve's 5-5.
So I guess we won't be getting any happy Purim cards
from Dennis Collins next year, huh?
Thanks for the experience.
We're supposed to be going to Oklahoma City.
Oh, is that where we're going now?
Yeah, Oklahoma City.
We'll be big over there, right?
I have to pass this along to you.
This was a little bit of a mail.
Let's hear about that.
Wait a minute.
Oh, the headline.
I have to get up now.
I'm getting too old for this.
Headline says Radio Host hits listener at festival.
This is from the St.P. Times.
Yeah, that's right.
Date line Largo.
Largo.
Contaversial Radio Torture Host.
Bob Lasseter.
Hit a 19-year-old listener with the back of his hand
after the man screamed close to the microphone
during a live broadcast at the Largo Renaissance Festival
on Saturday, police say.
On Saturday?
The man told police that he received free tickets
to the festival from the Lasseter Show on WFLA
and that he screamed because I've been a regular caller
on the show for the last two years.
I've been asked by the producers to scream.
He told police that Lasseter seemed to recognize the scream
and that after the scream Lasseter turned to his side
and punched the man in the mouth.
Wow.
Ah, you got it.
You got it.
Wow.
This is it.
This is it.
This is it.
Well, there goes on.
It goes on and on and on and on.
But that's the crux of it.
He says, Lasseter says, this is a quote I was closing my radio show
when I heard a loud scream that appeared to be coming
from my left rear.
His left rear.
Directly in my ear.
Montana.
As I am the frequent target of threats of physical violence
I react first, ask questions later.
Oh, yeah.
I swung with my left arm back handing a young man
before I ever made eye contact.
He was stunned and left the area.
This is a Lasseter quote.
I followed a approach that I failed to find it funny,
advised him what he did was actually in violation of federal law
and told him that I never wanted to see him again.
Yeah.
Now, the man gave kind of a different story.
This is the man's story.
Yeah, let's hear the other stories.
Yeah, this is the rest of the story.
The rest of his story.
He was still on stiffing this station.
Now, the guy told police somewhat different version.
I don't know if the guy from ABC didn't call in to congratulate us,
by the way.
What a douchebag.
He put down his microphone and ran ahead of where I was walking.
He began poking his index finger in my chest saying,
don't ever let me see you again.
If I ever see you under any different circumstances,
I will beat the hell out of you.
I happened to be in my car at the time
Lasseter was ending his live broadcast,
said the festival manager heard a loud scream.
So all I could say is I heard the loud screen
over the air police are still investigating this incredible shocking.
Well, there's nothing to do with it.
You know the real reason he hit him?
He's an all-john provocateur.
That's the real story.
Okay.
20 minutes passed.
No, the W.O.D. is the stuff.
Now don't throw that thing out there with that picture.
That guy wants to be your sidekick when I go on vacation.
Let me read his letter.
He's got a long letter.
Of course the only problem is he doesn't sign it.
I don't think so.
Yes he does.
Oh, here is name in all his vitality.
Would be celebrity.
It's signed.
Would be celebrity.
Now is there nothing in there with a name?
So how do we ever get in touch with him?
I don't think it's all I have.
You have his thing?
I have his thing.
I want you to resume.
I want you to relinquish his thing.
I have his resume.
Now that's shocking.
Okay.
Shocking.
What is this guy's name?
He looks a little bit on the Latin side of me.
I don't know who this is.
But he wants you to like to come in while I'm on vacation.
Or better yet so it's not to pose any threat to the bird.
And since he's already gainfully employed, you might consider me to keep you company
if that Saturday gig comes through.
You got it baby.
You got it.
Wait a minute.
Here's a motivation radio listener.
Can we get the bulletin-southered instrument?
Hello.
Hello Neil.
How are you doing?
Okay.
Hey bird, how are you?
You're the one.
I actually do listen to it.
I actually do listen to it.
Maybe your sales staff could also listen to it.
It might help them be a little bit better in terms of a sales staff.
Hey listen, it couldn't hurt.
You know what I'm saying?
Couldn't hurt.
Well I'm a salesman.
I'm on the road a lot.
Actually I'm in chemical sales.
And if I listen to it sometimes it helps.
I have a lot of garbage photos.
Other stations.
But they can't hear me going every now and then.
Yeah.
It works for me like a charm boy.
Well I'm the only listener so another good thing about it is that you don't have a whole lot of commercials.
Yeah.
I like that too.
In fact Zeta was right on the break of the commercial free radio.
Now after seeing his book I think there are going to be several stations who are going to be delving into that.
You know, dabbling with commercial free pretty soon.
I can understand.
I can relate to it.
Try to get your sales force to listen to it over there and maybe they might help you guys out.
Okay or maybe they might even get hired over there.
I think they'd fit right in if they got no spots.
Actually I'd like to get the job over at she with the big signal over there.
We get some good people.
You know.
Yeah.
And they might help them out some.
Okay just take a lot of defensive equipment over there.
It's an ugly likes to chase.
Haha.
Occasionally like with a ball peen hammer.
You know that kind of stuff.
Alright Neil.
Okay good luck to found you.
Thank you.
Bye bye.
Okay what a call.
22 past noon at WIOD.
An open line is in Palm Beach.
Hey we've actually had a few living and breathing people in Palm Beach.
And where the hell is that food by the way?
Uh oh.
We are getting pretty thoroughly about this.
Our line up with a 7-3 with an 8-6 and 25-54.
And we're all these people that love us and tinkle all over us.
And I'm not joking today.
We got a celebrity here who's starving that has eaten in two weeks.
And we can't even drum up a couple of burgers or something.
Wow.
A little pizza?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Come on now.
Don't let us down.
It's going to be humiliating, degrading and embarrassing.
Doesn't look good.
Wow.
Sorry John.
They just don't care.
Like I said, they don't give it in.
23 afternoons at WIOD.
And speaking of that, let's tell you about Nutri-System.
Well, this could be a blessing in disguise for Johnny Dark.
This could be kind of unwittingly the beginning of his Nutri-System career.
And...
Oh, is that what he's doing tomorrow?
He's looking for a job.
27 past noon at WIOD.
And we got a couple of, we got three lines open up again.
They're just not really into it today.
And on I admitted the beginning, I told them all to get lost and they did.
One thing about this audience, man, they're obedient.
But life goes on, we just keep going along with the build up to the Steve Cain Show today.
Marilyn Volker, River, Rick Patterson, the topic will be sex surrogates, therapist or prostitutes.
And then Amar is going to be doing professional guests.
Are they prostitutes?
I love those professional guests.
I still can't get over those two guest lists that we need more.
Boy, those were the days.
You want your child to become a super kid.
Listen to this afternoon to the Steve Cain Show's parenting expert, Michael Desisto.
We haven't met him as long as we've been here.
That's a nice guy.
I'm sure he's a good guy, but enough is enough.
And then Sharon gave me this thing, a brave new world of love potions.
It says daily use for two weeks brings firmer, longer lasting erections,
and an increased ability to achieve orgasm.
Really?
Bollimics will be more not to use the drug because of dangerous side effects.
Green oats, nettle extract and vitamin C are the ingredients of X-stavia, a non-prescription drug, from Switzerland.
X-men taking a powder in juicer water in a study reported a significantly higher increase in sexual desire,
as well as firmer and longer lasting erections.
Women reported no benefits, although Bill, what was his name?
Bill.
The guy who was a girl.
Oh, get tipped in.
Said that it was okay by him.
Her.
129, a WI-V.
Here's a call from Atlanta. Hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay.
I tried calling the brown line. I held off for 20 minutes. Nobody answered the phone.
What are you doing up there?
Roofing.
I called you last week.
Oh, yeah, this is Roofing's up in Atlanta.
Yeah, that's right.
Roofing.
He must be related to Muffin up there in Palm Beach.
Well, I'm dead.
Middle Muffin.
When all you got up here is Lead Low Ports to listen to.
Is he still on the air?
Huh?
He's still on the air.
He used to be on the old WRNG up there in Atlanta.
He's on WSB now.
Yeah.
He's on WSB?
Yeah.
That's our station.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But must already argue with Colborn,
oh, I mean put your eye to sleep.
Aah, oh!
Come on up.
Be nice.
Be nice.
Or, Nick Trigoni will come over there and head with a
Kalbasa, be nice.
Why is the exact opposite of you?
I know.
And yes.
It's eggs in progress.
Yes.
Well, I'll tell a corporate people you said so.
Oh please.
Just, ah, when you're going to get on that fanright, Neil?
Yeah.
What?
I think we have a bad connection.
I don't know if you're going to get on the fanright.
You know what I think you are sir?
He's an Ojoan provocateur.
Now we have enough trouble just to keep him under arrest on here.
We have enough problems here.
So I guess you didn't hear about those great ratings that just came out.
That's my cop story, yeah.
Well I might just go down the whole list of that for it.
Please do, probably I eat from last night.
No, no, no.
We've already done this to the point of nausea.
We had a 7-3 sir.
We were just a kick-dass and in 25 to 54s we had an 8-6.
We were number one and the food just came in.
I do you like that?
Where are you getting from today?
We got a little pizza here from Flores.
Thank you Carmine.
You're a wonderful human being.
And here's a little note from Lynn.
Isn't that great?
Boy I'll tell you everything's just falling into place today.
Sir, it's terrific.
It's almost worth being alive.
We did do something right up here.
Okay, well listen, say hi to all our, uh,
Yoko friends up there at WSB, okay?
Just put me on hold for a few seconds.
Okay, no problem.
Thank you.
Don't go away now.
Oh, look at this, Andy.
Poster was just, now don't put the Andy Poster on our,
oh my god, on our friend here.
Now look at what you did.
Look where he's got like, um, no, that's disgusting.
Sharon is really just going nuts.
Mm-hmm.
Look how he had a little accident there, don't I?
1231, what is that?
Oh, it's one of those ass hole certificates is in it.
Thanks a lot, Joe.
We just want to know that, uh, oh, I see it's just like a blank.
He didn't even write our name in.
Thanks a lot, Joe.
Thanks for the food, Flores.
This is, look at that pizza.
Boy, that's just with the plain cheese.
So we have none there.
Well, we'll get some napkins.
Don't start hyperventilating, okay?
Don't go nuts.
Is this guy still here by the way?
I'm dying over here.
Okay.
We left him out, hold so long, I can't say that I blame him.
It's 1231 at WIOD.
I was at line six working again.
I think I saw it, um, do a little, no.
Well, I get nervous, you know, when we have lines at our blank.
Let's take a call.
Oh, here's Leroy and Miami.
How you doing, Leroy?
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hello, baby.
Okay, Poster, Leroy.
You may not remember, Leroy B.
You may not remember me.
Leroy B, are you related, will you be?
I'm one of the B brothers.
Yeah, will the B both go B and B, Roy B?
I used to do the bad lawn over there, Carol.
I used to know you're cousin Bumble.
Is anyone?
I say, I hope you're having a good day out there.
I'm having a very good day.
Thank you very much.
Great.
Oh, you and tell you on techno, Tim.
You're just just going already.
I haven't even made a move for it yet.
That's right.
Wow, what a bunch of maniacs in here.
It's great.
Well, give me just one piece.
I know it's great.
It's that plain cheese from the Flores's orgasmic over.
Look at the size of those pieces.
Can I see?
We didn't let you down, John.
John was getting really distraught and upset.
And a little apoplectic, too, I might add.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, I'm almost lost.
I'm sorry.
You can't be here to share it with us, pal.
Oh, but they got shells up here now.
Well, that's great.
Go up there and just pick out.
Okay.
Hold on now.
I know what he's really thinking up there.
I'm dying over here.
Okay.
Yeah, 12.
12.33 at WID.
That's what there's all singing.
They've got a little chorusing in over WOLD.
They're all singing at some point.
And it's there.
Well, data is already passed.
I'm 95.
I'm 95.
I can hear it now.
I can already hear it.
Okay.
In case you missed the stories and if you tune in late,
the big radio news that everybody's buzzing about.
I said buzzing about is Steve.
What was his name?
Piccoloni.
Poram.
Poram.
Steve Poram.
The four-year-old program director,
while 100 is,
can he's out, he's audio-seeing.
It took them to depths that are just frightening.
And I'm sure Sonny Fox is really upset about that.
How come Sonny hadn't called us on the air today?
I mean, I don't want to beg,
but I would think he'd probably be cloting.
We'll use all the numbers he wanted.
I want to trick a little while.
Clem wants to speak.
Oh, you want to speak to your buddy again?
Yeah.
Are you there, Rufus?
I'm here.
Hey, he.
Are you doing, Clem?
All right, man, hey, Granny Dice.
Hey, Granny Dice.
Oh, no.
Yeah, I found Gordy.
Another blue hair bright to good.
That's right.
If he was 95 or the half,
he needs it to die.
Really?
Have a life time script for him.
Hey, man, why don't you call me Corvette, man?
All right, I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it.
All right, listen, I found Gordy.
All right, I'll call you Corvette.
All right, I'll do it, all right?
Get off me, old fellow.
I'm sorry, Nia, I have a booklet.
What can I say?
I know you have one, one, two.
Wow.
They're good together, aren't they?
All right, thanks.
In fact, pretty soon, they have that show on the weekend at WOLV.
They can have a show on the weekend here.
I don't know when I'm...
Anybody could have a show on the weekend here.
We don't want to get into that, do we?
Because things are just too positive.
You know, we don't want to throw any monkey wrenches into the works.
But I'm personally kind of upset about Gary Noe.
And don't forget,
you know, their roomers were before the big draft show Sunday.
So by now, we can be doing like a funny cheer now.
Oh, I didn't think about that.
Oh, yeah.
To me, that kind of like, put us over the top.
We're apologizing for eating on the air here,
because we know it's bad radio,
but we don't give a good flying up about it.
Because I told Boy Gary yesterday, you know, the bus to Louisville
leaves in about a half an hour.
And he knows it, too.
He got the schedule on his head.
All right, listen, this Saturday, we're going to be doing something
really speaking of that thing, you old D, you know what I mean?
Okay, 1239 at WID, aren't you going to take this pizza?
We desperately want you to have it.
Oh, Nick's going to get it for you.
Boy.
Wow.
He's shy.
I don't understand it.
What, what did we do?
I don't know.
Okay, so Johnny's going out to give me a diet soda and run his way out.
Are you really?
That would be great, because my diet Pepsi here is just about out.
Okay, 21 to 1 at WID, we're having our little ratings party.
Anytime, and we've got two mouse to feed there,
so we got to take care of him.
And we just, everybody in the station did great.
Well, we're nearly did great.
Mm-hmm.
We did incredible Steve Grimmongus sensational.
Now, well, now, you know, and we're almost in building a day,
isn't that what Boy Gary said?
He's going to give us 20 or 30 years.
You know what else Boy Gary said.
Okay, let's take a call from Hollywood.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, how you doing?
I got a pick report for you.
Okay.
It's a four-letter up, please, in the morning.
The speed trip set up from now, probably for the next couple of days.
I got caught at the first one.
And as I got out, there were two others on my way to work.
I'd like to call the city of four-letter up, please,
Department of Bunch and Subhuman, Moronic, Douchebag, Asshole.
Where was this?
This was on Broward, and they had one on Sixth Street.
And I also heard of somebody told me there was one on 19th Street.
Isn't that great?
Well, it probably is toward the end of the month.
They're down under quota, yeah.
Exactly.
The second one was already printed out with the judges.
And the troopers name and his badge, right?
And the speed, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, they must have been...
They must have passed it on.
People be careful coming into work.
It must have been your lucky day.
Okay, thanks a lot, pal.
No problem.
Bye.
Okay, I don't know what just happened, but look at that.
Every line was lit, and we took that one column,
three people dropped off immediately.
Well, it's...
We don't care.
We're eating.
We're not having a good time.
We're basking in a glory of those numbers,
which by tomorrow will be ancient history.
Now, do we have, like, a little note or a memo that said the incredible job?
You mean, like, they got after the draft show, something like that?
Yeah.
That said, this was a radio at its finest,
its shining hour, et cetera.
I haven't seen it yet.
What an incredible humongous, phenomenal, unbelievable, et cetera.
I don't think so.
I mean, we might still.
I doubt it.
Wow.
Well, that was really great.
See, we didn't let you down, Johnny.
We came through for you.
So, the news is, Johnny, is alive and safe for at least one more day.
Right?
Here's a mobile and Palm Beach.
Hello.
Neil Bird.
Yes, sir.
Let us a fight to say, Tinkled Tinkled.
Yes, sir.
Great ratings.
Unless I got one thing to ask you,
is an O'shong from Bucket Torders like,
Sipto's Jure or something?
He's an O'shong from Bucket Tordes.
Yeah.
You don't have to ask old,
Cunfian Western Dick fatherly.
Well, let's talk.
In between those Willie Nelson records on QAM.
One more thing.
I'm only concerned about one thing for you and birds.
What is that?
The higher your ratings get,
and I'll tell you, get much higher.
You've got to be 30 or 40.
The closer you guys get to the door,
you've got to be okay this time, right?
I mean, the closer we get to the door,
yeah, the no brain management
usually gets nervous when you're reading too high.
Now, one good thing about here,
they're always nervous.
They don't make any difference with the others.
Good.
Then you're safe and sound for a while.
Wow, yeah.
We're not going anywhere.
Please don't let them.
You can fight on what Dennis Collins says.
What does he know?
Not much.
That's obvious by the numbers.
You guys have a great day.
And best of luck to you.
All you don't need it.
Thanks a lot.
No, all.
1242 at WIOD.
We have an open line in Palm Beach.
At 655 WIOD and one in Broward now, 524 WIOD.
524 9463 on a mindless,
moronic idiotic douchebag show.
So this is why we're at the top.
That's right, but just the way we like it.
What a perfect reflection of America, okay?
By the way, now I'm still planning out my vacation.
It's still in limbo.
I got like three or four different,
I mean, I got a basic tentative thing set up.
But I was looking through some of these book now.
Amsterdam, everybody tells me how great it is.
You know, it had wonderful time.
But I was looking through this one burlitz book.
And it looked like all the people like the 60s all over again.
It looked like all these burnout washed out,
hippie-ish grotesque, mung, non-bathing.
Is that what it is?
Where have you been there?
Yeah.
No, nobody hears me.
Get on TV.
Well, I don't care.
You're seeing it.
I've seen a lot on TV too,
but actually being there and getting the feel of it
is another stirring.
You know what I mean?
That's what Phoebe Kate said.
Yeah, see, I've seen Phoebe on TV.
Well, wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen,
we have another Ojampra Vaca tour online for...
Well, what can I tell you?
Another radio troublemaker,
another unemployed radio.
Too bad you weren't here today.
You would have loved the pizza.
Well, the ratings are just phenomenal.
How's that?
What can I tell you?
And that in 40 cents will buy us a watery cup of coffee
and look, it's okay on the beach.
Congratulations, bird.
Thank you, Stan.
Congratulations, Uncle Neil.
And it's just...
It's incredible.
I know.
I mean, it's shocking.
Incredible.
Think of what it would be if you got that hot...
You know, got rid of that hot two to three hours.
Now, come on now.
Don't start that.
All I would have a point.
Yeah, it was funny because Steve said yesterday that he's a little...
You know, with the...
Because he has to get in here at the six to seven hours sports stock.
Oh, yeah, right.
And I didn't want to say...
Because Steve, you know, he's doing very well.
I don't want to say, well, we inherit your two to three hours.
Because he would have taken that to wrong way.
You know, Steve is so fragile.
But you can do this exact same thing, Stan.
You have to take that six to seven news out.
And we used to have to inherit your mediocre two to three hours, okay?
So it goes around.
See?
Comes around.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Stan.
It's pretty phenomenal.
What did Wins do in my old time slot?
Oh, do you want?
Wow, we're going to have good questions.
Well, look at that paper with all that pizza on it.
Oh, boy, just a second now.
I think they went way up to a two-one, something like that.
Just a minute now.
Don't start hyperventilating on us.
Three to seven.
While we got 25 to 54, that was your strong use to have like a fours and five.
Fours, you got five.
Well, let's take a look here.
W-I-N-Z, I'm on the second page.
I don't see them.
Here they got a two-one in 25 to 54.
They went up from a one-nine.
So they really turned the corner.
Yeah, right.
And 12 plus...
12 plus in afternoons were used to have like fours and fives.
They did...
on the, not the second page.
On the third page, two-five.
So they've lost half the audience, I would say.
Yep.
Well, they're obviously very happy with what they've got.
Now, did you hear the rumors about Zeta?
Yeah, that's interesting.
I mean, I mean all these i95 pins, I've got around the house here.
It's gonna be worth something.
I think so.
I think so.
Are you practicing Stan?
I...
The 95.
Yeah, if you work on it, they might get you right in or do all the voices.
But I'm not gonna have any live jocks.
Of course, that's no different from what they got now.
But can I get the crayon franchise for the new PD?
Boy, I'm telling you, this isley is just going nuts, isn't he?
And of course, he's another...
You remember that article?
Who was it? Jika wrote it?
About all the talent that the guy Gannett has let's look at their fingers?
Yeah.
And Keith Isley was a classic example there.
Yep.
Well, along with some of the rest of us.
Yes, right.
But...
Well, it's great, Neil.
Have a wonderful life.
Fantastic.
Talk to you later.
Do you have any of the male demographics in your time slot yet?
No.
You don't?
No, but the book will be in a couple of days.
We don't want to shoot the thing all in one day.
I better...
I'm gonna imagine what your room...
Men 25 to 54, we must have like a 15-shere.
That's gotta be a career.
That's gotta be a career.
How about these women?
How about these women, man?
If we had women, like we got men,
Gannett only knows what kind of number we have.
Well, I have the other showbiz are often.
I get the women for you.
Like I said.
See ya.
Wow.
Boy, what a day.
Well, see, Stan doesn't terrorize the women as much as he used to.
Because now that he's married and he's got his little baby
and he's more like kind of domestic.
Much more.
Remember in the beginning of the high-end Zahee?
He's had those women just terrified.
Well, here.
It was wild.
And I guess with good reason.
Okay, it's 1246 at WID.
We have an open line in Palm Beach.
655 WIOD.
6559463.
We're still waiting for our congratulatory call from Majod Picano at WJNO.
We haven't got that yet.
No, not yet.
He's probably had a, you know, we've had a lot of action on headlines.
Probably had trouble getting the hit.
So we'll try to keep that line open for you so that John Picano can get through
from JNO and congratulate us on these astonishingly shocking demographics
and great numbers here at WIOD.
Boca, hello.
John.
Congratulations.
Thank you, John.
We're expecting you on the Boca line.
Oh, where are you?
Your metamorphans are on the way, Neil.
Yeah, okay.
Well, that was nice of John to call us.
Mm-hmm.
That was real nice.
Okay, we're kind of dwindling down on calls here today,
but that's all right.
We understand trying to even things out a little bit.
Boy, this is this salad.
You could eat this for hours, I know.
And you use to leave it.
But that would be wrong because it's bad radio.
And I,
I wish we could do it.
I bet you would do a 20-year-old,
we could do quality radio like Sunday.
And it's best.
And it's best.
Two memos that will live in the anals of broadcast history.
They will hang those side-by-side
in the Smithsonian Institute,
the broadcast museum,
along with the program director who wrote them.
Well,
ought to be in an institute right now,
so they're fucking a straight jacket.
Wow.
You know, see, had those suspenders back on again today,
and he brought in the cigars and the champagne.
Just acted like he knew what planet he was on.
And he's got that little thing he wears on the back of his shirt.
It says, which way to Louisville?
A question mark.
So some of us who are getting about ready to show him
that they're right now, he's a good guy.
He really, look at he got our CD player,
which we ought to start using.
See, I feel guilty because we wasted a lot of time.
We've screwed around today.
We've been selfish.
We've had the show to ourselves.
We're sensibly because nobody wants to call.
But it's true.
But I think we ought to play a lot more music here, don't you?
Now, have you heard any of the music on the air?
You certainly must have.
Is it sound okay?
Does?
It's hard to tell in here because that one speaker is,
it's purposely,
bassy so we don't get the high,
so it doesn't pee back.
You understand that?
There are?
You know, there are a lot of highs in the building.
Most of them in the newsroom went,
let me just see if there's anything in here.
By the way, I want to show you something.
Don't ever get
CD CDs.
This is a set.
These have got all, oh god, I almost,
I want to blow my brain down.
While you hold these collectors out there,
don't go getting carried away and buy a whole bunch
of a new series until you listen to one.
And make sure that it sounds even remotely
like the original ones, okay?
Even just remotely.
Like I'd say, there were, it sounds remotely
like you've heard something like that before,
but you don't know what the name of the song is.
Yeah.
Do you know what that means?
What does that mean?
The acid casualty t-shirts.
What does that mean?
I mean, I know they got one guy in the show
who's an acid casualty.
And he's a good guy.
He's our buddy.
Well, at least till today he was.
And then tomorrow he's doing what?
He's doing a part,
oh yeah, in a video.
Is he really?
That's the rumor.
This is rumor day.
Oh, I think we look lazy as video.
That found 12.
10 minutes till one at WIOD.
Something to read a sign.
Oh yeah.
Okay, good deal.
What's the date today, 25th?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Great.
No, this makes my day next to the ratings.
This is the best number I've seen all day.
That's great.
Okay, Sharon.
Thank you so much.
You have a wonderful life.
1257 at WIOD.
We want to congratulate Larry Kent,
the winner of the Florida lottery.
You guys can't, Larry Kent.
Larry Kent is his name.
But not our Larry Kent.
Yeah, this guy is from Roswell, Georgia.
Oh, but even in honor,
we still want to congratulate him.
Well, Larry Kent said,
giant in the WIOD experience market.
There's been around for at least six or seven years.
I'd like to get the Larry and Boom Boom on the same show together.
Oh my.
We can get it like a phone number like seven,
seven, seven.
I think it's like alternate, you know, every other,
every other seven.
Super Saturday.
Howard County.
Hello.
Howard County.
Hello.
Howard County.
Hello.
Howard County.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Neil?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like to hear Ricky Tickley do a talk up
to people who got to be free.
Yeah.
And then step on it.
Had a couple of questions concerning the rating.
Yes, sir.
Anything you want.
I got numbers here that haven't been invented yet
for stations that aren't on the air anymore.
Yeah.
I wonder what would happen if all those monitors
that are out there got a diary?
Would they be realistic?
It could put you down or what?
Well, for all we know they may have.
So we might be doing a 20-year for all we know.
Yeah, right.
You never know.
Yeah.
I haven't heard about our favorite
afternoon radio personality.
Irene Richard.
Oh, Irene.
Well, Irene, let's see.
You know, probably in tears that you left her out.
Now, she didn't do too bad.
She had a 3-8 and 12 in the 12-plus.
Now, wait a minute.
That was up from a 3-6.
That's not so bad.
Then in 25 to 54, what did I say?
Because I don't want to have to look through all this again.
We already, Johnny and I looked that up somewhere here.
It was just a lot of problems.
I'll look it up, OK?
You guys being like pages and pages.
General with pages.
There's a lot of problems.
That's really well.
I think you created most of them, OK?
I agree.
All right, let's see.
You are so brutal.
Don't let sit at him, sir.
It's just sour, great.
All those former gloves, personalities, man.
They just get all bent out of shape
and then you tell us and show up on ratings day again.
You notice he wasn't there this morning again?
Well, the ratings went down.
He's always been flat.
That's what I think I really talked about the ratings.
Oh, ratings.
Oh, I'll look him up during the news
and we'll have him for you right in the big one of two hours.
OK.
Have a good one.
OK.
Well, while we're searching frantically for Irene's listeners,
it looks like they are at love.
We're going to pause now.
Of course, April War, them who hasn't got any idea what this is all about.
But it's having a good time with anyway.
She got the, oh, here it is.
$25.54.
We do a real quick down.
$55.05.2.
Not bad.
Irene, good job.
We'll be back at 105.
So why don't you two hour?
Well, that's easy for you to say.
OK, 105 at WIOD.
The winner book is, by the way,
Andrew Reese from Jewels are by us.
I did get that little thing and I appreciate it.
It was great.
Thank you very much.
What a day, huh?
That big one or two.
Did they all applaud it in a hallway?
They patch you on it back and say,
incredible job.
Unbelievable.
We'll keep up the great work.
Nobody talked to you.
Well, even Phil.
I see.
Well, they're probably all out to their big executive lunches now.
Planning all the gifts that they're going to give.
Quiet out there.
Here's a call from chronic productions.
This must be one of our inside people here.
Hello.
Good morning.
Good afternoon.
Is this one of us?
Congratulations, guys, for Miami-Rakes test and chronic production.
Well, thank you.
We couldn't have done it without your stuff.
Wow, we're all happy.
We're all happy to see you guys right to our thing.
You don't have to wait a minute.
Spike Wife just came in here.
You don't have nothing to do with this thing.
Here's a finger for you, Spike.
Yeah, get out of here.
Get out of here.
By the way, GTR had a fluke book by the way.
You believe this Spike Wife's coming in here?
Yeah.
Bring some more champagne.
I think he already drank it off.
So anyway.
So anyway, we don't pay for a book and the only way we can get the numbers is through you.
We're wondering if you can give us some of those 18 to 34 overall numbers.
Overall?
Yeah.
Well, you mean like...
You don't want to give us, was that news?
You mean for like the week, right?
No, for the winter but.
But I mean like for the whole week,
I don't start testing my patients as they say in my doctor's office.
18 to 34, let's see, those are on these strange little light pages.
Okay, you want 18 to 34, 6...
In what morning?
Overall, I'm going to start getting really upset.
Okay, here we go.
Seven of midnight, I can't find it.
Here it is.
I finally got it.
Well, we got 400 things here.
Hot, 14.9.
I know.
GTR, 10.7.
No reaction.
A power of 7.5.
Gloves.
I'm not reacting because I'm writing news down.
Oh, gloves 90 feet.
Are we reacting in the other room?
Believe me.
Are they really?
I hear it and if they'd make about two, four feet in between each other,
they'd probably be a lot better off.
1194, 5.6.
What 100?
5.4.
How about X, D, J?
Wax, the FM at a 5.
And that's the Zeta.
That'll be a while.
X, D, J, if I keep reading,
we'll have the end of the show before we get to that.
Here's magic.
They're not on the second page.
They're on the third page.
They went from a 4.7 to a 2.5 in 18 to 34 is on WX.
Oh, FF.
I'm afraid of that.
I just gave you that.
You see, you got to be real quick, 3.8.
But Zeta's like, Zeta's basically history, you know what I'm saying?
What do you guys do?
Overall?
You mean the station?
WIOD 18 to 34 probably didn't do much.
We had a 6-1 10 to 3.
But WIOD 18 to 34, I can't imagine it was much of any number.
Let me see.
Do I want to do this?
Is it on here anywhere?
Are we?
Do we make the first four sheets?
It's got to be.
Yeah, 3-1.
It's not so bad.
Test your patience one more time.
One more and that's it.
Okay.
Because I even am falling asleep now.
Afternoon to night, 18 to 34 for GTR.
For GTR, boy, this is a pretty intensive call here.
Let's see.
3 to 7 p.m.
WGTR 18 to 34 at 11.
Share up from a 7-6 and at night 7 to midnight,
WGTR had a 7-3.
All right.
Okay.
All right, I like that 11.
See ya.
Take care.
Bye.
Okay, here's some facts stuff now.
And this is the Lexington Stakes at Keyland.
Who do you like?
It says this is going to be on 4 to 5 p.m.
on ESPN on the Lexington Stakes.
Got a chance to pick a horse here today.
We already picked it high.
Lea, this of course is at Keyland.
You know, Keyland is the only track in America
that does not have a track announcer.
Track in that fee.
They don't.
They just to run the races.
There's no track announcer at all.
They just silent.
And of course Dave Johnson does it on television.
But let's see.
Foxy reality with Randy Romero.
Charlie Barley with Robin Plants.
I'm picking Charlie Barley.
Okay.
I like the name and I like Robin Plants.
You Canadian Jockey detonated.
Which is kind of like what's that word again?
What is it?
detonated.
No, that word we were using earlier.
Oh, Delima.
Delima.
I better write that down.
I can't remember.
With Donald Brumfield, dispersal with Chris Antley.
Oh gee.
Now Chris Antley is the hottest Jockey in the country.
He's burning him up in New York.
He's had a winning race every day for 59 days in a row.
He's won a lease for a race.
The old record was 29.
Even money in a morning line.
Dispersal with that's your kind.
Uh huh.
Notation with Pat Dei.
America's friend with early fires.
Magistise Zimpo with Craig Perret and Bionic prospect
with Jacinto Vazquez.
Dispersal.
Yeah.
Okay.
He's going with the even money chalk.
He probably goes about two to five.
It'll be another frosty to snowman for 240.
So take about 40,000 and plunge your brain.
All the bridge jumpers can bet on this one.
Dispersal with Chris Antley and even money.
He'll probably win.
But I'm going with Charlie Barley with Robin Sinkton
stakes at Sinkton stakes at Sinkton stakes at Keenland.
This afternoon, Fidelin this afternoon,
Forty-five PM on the ESPN.
Wow.
And it's even got the racing form here.
Look at that, which you can't read.
But it's exciting.
Charlie Barley, what is last start?
But you could go blind trying to read this on a facts machine.
Detonated.
Has been in the money.
Five out of oh, dispersal is the one you put.
Oh, yeah, he's won three out of four.
And the last time he was second by half a length.
Drifted out, it says.
Okay.
Well, anyway, we don't want to get here.
I don't think those are that bad.
They may have not used them, but they're not that bad.
Yeah.
The quality isn't that great, but they're not that bad.
Huh?
We like them.
They're not like the W snoozingals.
Those are probably great, but we don't have, uh,
let's understand we don't have anywhere to plan.
We got nothing to do anything here.
We don't have any production here.
Can you imagine what number we could have if this were a real race?
The real station.
No real to real.
Wow.
Where?
Are you going nuts now?
Are you getting out of control?
Are we able to reel the reel in here too?
We got a CD player.
We got overhead speakers.
We got a triple deck, uh, uh, uh,
cart machine down there.
And you want to, uh, reel the reel in here and make it like a real radio station?
Cut it out.
We like to give the competition a little handy crap anyway.
Okay?
All right.
We do have one open line in dead county.
I don't know what the hell's going on in dead.
Cause they're taking a little C.S. to none.
I don't think anybody south of, uh,
what's like the demarcation of it?
South of 79th Street.
Nobody speaks English in dead county.
They do something going on there.
They do take C.S. to south of 79th Street every day from noon to two.
Did you know that in dead county?
Well, I guess it starts here in this building.
They started a trend.
Hollywood. Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hi, Nail.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, Nail.
I burned congrats on your rating.
Thank you.
You got a terrific show.
I've been listening about a year and a half now.
And I've enjoyed every second of it.
I'm on the road.
Well, I wish I could say the same.
I've been traveling on the road.
I'm a traveling nurse.
And unfortunately for the past couple of months,
I haven't been able to listen to your show.
Cause I bought an MG and, uh,
radio won't turn to AM.
Oh my god.
Well, you take it back where you bought it and tell them to get
them straight and out of else.
They're fixing it today.
So I can get to listen to you tomorrow.
Thank god.
But, uh, continue to experience on a great show.
And I really do enjoy it.
Thanks a lot.
Okay. Have a great day.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, she was nice.
One, she very nice.
What happened?
What a terrible problem.
I never heard of such a thing.
No, AM.
God.
FM is obsolete, isn't it?
Kid with it.
I love.
Oh, we first came over here.
I love that.
The day that Alice, remember we having that little thing
back and forth?
Oh, sure.
And I had to tune into Alice,
which took years off my life.
And he was whining like he always said.
Oh, one day he says FM is dead.
And then he's on AM and it's that.
And I'm well, we, I mean, we go wobble as less Cooper would say on that particular.
But one thing we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is that W.
Snews is dead.
Okay.
I mean, he's number is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Can there be any question at all?
No, there is a lot of question.
We have here today, uh, out of the new inquire,
we have a little pole that was taken doing.
And Oprah, a lot of people in this building have a little pole.
Oprah is the runaway favorite of inquire readers when it comes to talk show host.
She is number one.
She got 44.4% of the votes more than double the second place,
which of course is Rush Limbaugh.
Haraldo.
Oh my god.
I'll go to America's not well tonight.
Yeah, this is really a Sally Jesse was third with 15%
Phil Donahue, long regard as the top, top duog of talk show host place in
this and fourth.
And you know what they say about Donahue?
He's an Ozhaw for the tour.
And TV motormouth Morton Downey Jr. was fifth.
And in last place, ladies, can we have a drum roll?
Well, I don't have a drum roll in there, but I think you're like this better.
Perfect.
Larry King.
Oh, yeah.
Larry was the wacker twist and Larry, of course, used to be on his station
when it was a WC.
He's the old wacker on the radio.
See how it all pies together?
It's unbelievable, isn't it?
The wacker twist.
Thank you, Larry King.
Yeah, you think about it.
Lake Worth, hello.
This is John Faccano.
Nope, sound like John was about ready to hit the bottom of the boulder, didn't it?
Okay, we have an open line.
Look at that.
Bokeh is wrapped off at the same time.
They dropped off like in tandem.
278WID and Bokeh even veg didn't call today to congratulate us on a ready shot.
You know, all you chronics like Paul Harvey at least, I can't say much for them
because he's really a pain in the ass.
But at least today he called in the book came out and he had the common decency to,
you know, deflect his own egotistical, ego maniacal crap and you know,
have a little something to say about us, okay?
Yeah.
But the rest of these professional, psychophantic, moronic, douchebag, subhuman,
whatever they are, you know, they won't do that.
Well, Cox did call in.
Oh yeah, well, not.
They're the only two chronic.
I forgot about him.
Yeah.
Okay, it's way, I think you're playing at buzzer enough.
Not yet.
Don't panic.
It's not yet.
We don't want anybody on the line to get nervous.
Poor Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I wanted to thank you before I give you my little spire report.
I just had an incredible out of radio experience at about one o'clock.
You had an auto-erotic experience?
There was no delay and I was freaking out and I'm like,
gotta hope Neil picks up on me first so I can tell him before he goes.
When was that coming out of the one o'clock news?
Yeah, and then just real gradually like,
oh, there's a one second delay and then there's a two second delay.
Like I was on drugs.
Well, yes, what?
That's how it works.
Really?
Kind of like builds up, like other things, you know.
Yeah, it kind of builds up to a crescendo.
It's quite magic.
And then in your case, it's kind of peeders out.
Yeah.
I just wanted to call and give you the great news.
You're going to be sprinting around like a dreidel in about three seconds.
So get ready to light your cigar back up.
Hmm.
Liz O'Neill is retiring from the weekly news.
Effective this week.
He's moving to one.
He's moving to one.
Washington of all God.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Wow.
So the weekly news is this.
Well, any kind of listen to Howard Stern show in Washington, right?
Right.
Ah, oh, really?
This will be a good experience for him all around.
Yeah, good learning experience.
His last editorial is going to be in tomorrow's issue and he says he's going to rip everybody that's ever
ripped him.
So your name will probably be in there.
It's in that wonderful.
I hope he spelled it right.
I hope so too.
Cause remember what goes around comes around you to so to speak.
Can you give me a buzz before I go?
Well, it all depends on what you had.
See you.
Huh.
Well, we're asking to get buzzed.
Okay.
Yeah.
I know.
Well, this has really been a day.
We've had more news rumors and stories today.
Yeah.
Right from the beginning.
Remember right in the beginning all the first day and stuff and then we had what was that?
Dennis Reeves.
Yes.
Absolutely.
You know what?
I really missed out.
I was I should have thought of it.
Then when he got into that rumor, I was so shocked.
I didn't know what the scream read the microphone.
I wanted to ask him about that night at old I 95 when he had all those kids in their underwear
in the studio.
Cause I keep telling you about it.
A lot of people think I'm making that up or I was wishful thinking.
Yeah.
And it's a true story.
Well, the Metro police came and chased everybody.
Now a lot of them.
I'm sure he'll call back a couple days.
And we were pretty pio to talk.
Okay.
It was getting to look pretty interesting.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, this one.
Look at that.
We got the bad radio.
Okay.
We only got an eight six and 25 to 50.
We're only number one, but it's bad radio.
See what you don't understand, boy, Gary is in this market.
Bad radio is good.
It's like the kids.
They said, boy, that was really bad.
I mean, it was good.
Okay.
So if he says maybe wait a minute, maybe he's talking kid talk.
Okay.
He said it was bad radio.
It is boy.
It does.
Don't I mean, he's giving us a stinking compliment.
Okay.
He said, man, that was bad.
And when he said the other thing was really good.
He meant it's.
So now I'm beginning to understand this kid.
Okay.
See when you got like a four year old program director,
you got to learn a little different.
You know, we got a little generation gap there.
We weren't even thinking like about 42 years.
Okay.
Here's a constant comment.
I'm sure about our male callers.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes.
Hi, Kathy.
Hi, Kathy.
I'm a reject from Nazareth College for Women.
Does that ring any bell?
In Rochester.
No, no.
Nazareth College is in Kalamazoo.
Right.
Well, if you say so, I don't know.
It's been a rough life.
You know, I get them confused.
All right.
Congratulations, by the way, on your rating.
Thank you, Kathy.
We do care.
Well, a few.
Care enough to send their very best.
I'm finding though a lot of your male listeners,
as soon as they say, oh, yeah, I listened to Neil Rogers.
He's great.
They have to issue a disclaimer.
They say, I mean, I'm not gay or anything, mind you.
Oh, yeah.
And as soon as they say that, you know what that means.
Yes.
That means that they're, you know, wearing puse underwear.
I think so.
Yeah.
Very insecure at least.
Exactly.
Well, see, part of that, now my audience is used to that,
because I've been out of the closet for like,
almost 13 years on the air here.
So it's not a big deal.
But there's a certain segment of the people
across over Steve Kane audience.
His guys are very insecure, okay?
So like when he does these shows about the guy breastfeeding
and about all these other weird things that Steve gets into,
his guys call up and they want to be like padded on the head
and reassured that they're okay.
They want to make sure that they would never do any of these things.
They wouldn't, I'm sure.
And the amazing part of it is, if you listen closely,
you can tell they're usually calling in pairs
together on the phone, which tells me a lot.
I think so.
Anyway, good luck.
Keep up to good work.
We really do.
Thanks, Scott.
You have a good one.
Thank you, Scott.
Oh, yeah, I wasn't that sure, but the Corp.
I'm great.
Just like a lot of guys in a business who are always, you know,
sure.
126 at WIOD.
Everybody do with the WPK.
Oh, the DJs are moving to the WPK art quiz.
I think he never somebody all at once.
I do a no-factor quiz.
Wow.
The WPK art quiz.
I mean, there's no discussion of situations or events
of social problems or anything else.
It's just shock and radio.
You know, the bad part, you know, that's the end.
127 at WIOD.
We have an opening in Broward now.
It's pretty shock.
Broward's been pretty mediocre today.
I got to, you know, the fact that one line is not.
I don't think it makes too much difference.
Broward's been very, very fair weather today.
524 at WIOD.
524, 9463.
Probably a lot of the listeners in Broward are busy standing
across the lake, cross from my house.
Looking to see if my satellite dish is still up there with their hand over their eyebrow.
What is that?
What is that over there and running all around you know, a little circle?
Wow.
That's my philosophy.
What in question or in doubt?
What in circle screen and shot?
I like that.
By George.
Let's go to Miami.
Hello.
Neil Bird, how are you?
Okay, pal.
Hippasa.
Nothing.
Nothing's happening yet.
Yeah.
Neil.
Nothing on this end either.
I was going to ask you for something.
Could you play that?
I know I don't like requests and...
Hey, let me tell you something.
You sound desperate enough.
What is it that you want?
The Michael Tyson song.
Oh, I didn't know why.
That's not really a song.
It's something like a song, but we didn't really say goodbye.
We can debate it while I'm looking for it.
We can debate it as a song.
Is it a bit?
Is it a comedy thing?
It's something.
It's something.
Well, it's in a machine right now.
How do you like that?
Oh, that's great.
And I want to congratulate you guys on the rating you showed.
I love your show here.
Thanks.
And you even admitted, right?
Yeah.
In spite of what all your friends say.
Nice, sure.
We love it.
And before I go in the...
Can you belt in...
And belt me off that...
Let me just say this to you.
Okay, that cart is in the machine now.
I'd hate for you to lose it.
You know what I'm saying?
No, I know.
You got me to do something I almost never do.
And now it's like you're backing out of it.
No, no, no.
Like winning a lottery and then burning the ticket, you know?
It is that that's bad rating.
I know.
Well, that bad is good.
Yeah, I know.
And this has been a bad call, believe it.
See you later.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye.
Well, congratulations, Mr. Kane.
We've done it again.
A miracle, okay.
I did what I missed later, I'll send it.
You know, I get...
I am so upset with you.
I give you your number so many times.
I give it...
And always, I give it.
What's over?
Oh, excuses.
When a book comes out, you don't have time to be running around.
It's a priority.
Please, though.
Come on.
Get it.
25 to 54.
WIOD, the Steve Kane show.
Number three in a market with a five five, your highest ever.
In 25 to 54.
Alice, not on the second page.
Barely made it to the third page at the very bottom with a one-sixth, his lowest ever.
So like three and a half times, his 25 to 54 number.
And of course, in 12 plus any afternoon, you had a four-seven, which I think is your highest number ever.
And Alice had a three.
So he's right on the edge of dipping into the twos.
How about 60 five?
Well, the interesting part of it is, now listen to that.
You're joking, but three.
See, when the 35 to 64 scheme, and I said, finally something Dennis Collins can get excited about.
But unfortunately, it just didn't materialize.
Well, you know what that means.
That means you're all 65 plus.
Yeah, 35 to 64, for example, what do we have?
We had a seven eight and midday.
Sandy.
Oh, Sandy, man.
She just disappeared from the face of the earth.
She's not even on the third page.
Sandy, are you on here at all?
Let me look again.
That was unfair.
Sandy.
35 to 64.
So we had a seven eight.
Sandy had a two five.
You had a five seven.
And Alice had not on the second page.
A two two.
Two two.
35 to 64.
So obviously, virtually all of their audiences over 65.
What little they got, because they've only got, what do they have a three one?
We had a five one.
They had a three two and wins out of three one.
But like, it's not just the 12 plus numbers don't aren't sufficient to give the story.
The real story is when you break down the demographics, they got nothing 18 to 34.
They got very little 25 to 54.
And even 35 to 64, they've gone way down.
Their audience is getting older by the minute.
Okay.
So when they start giving out that five or one, you know that they know their audience, all right?
Did you say Alice had a two two?
A two two.
He's going to be, he's going to be wearing it this afternoon.
Hi everybody, this is safety office of Mike Tyson, heavyweight champion of the world.
You're bad as dude around.
The baddest driver around too, with your driving tip of the day.
A few months ago, I was in the K-Mart with my ex-wife, Robin Gibbons.
I can't believe it.
Maybe you read about her in the papers.
Anyway, she buys me one of these cute little garfields of cats with suction cup feet,
which takes stuck on the window in my car when we left the store.
On the way home, I drove into a tree.
I can't believe it.
Maybe you read about it in the papers.
I couldn't see the tree because the damn cat was in my way.
Robin said that I was stupid as to garfield on the windshield.
I mean, that's really bitchy to me.
I mean, call the heavyweight champion the world stupid?
Now that's stupid.
So I faked Robin, I left it.
I took her out with a clean right hand, knocked her right down completely.
First, a standing account.
I couldn't believe it.
Maybe you read about that in the papers.
Anyway, my attitude toward Garfield the cat has really been affected greatly.
In fact, if I see you driving around with Garfield the cat in your car,
I may lose complete control.
I don't know what will happen.
Maybe you'll read about that in the papers too.
All right, and just try to relax.
Would you please, 132 at W.O.D., all these rumors flying back and forth.
While rumors are there.
Indeed today, sex surrogates and other sex show, that's what we love.
Don't get much, but we love it.
Therapist or prostitute, sex surrogates.
And I hate to say this because I like Marilyn Volker.
She's a very, very nice lady.
But I just, I watched that on TV, you know, on the really intellectual shows like Heraldo.
And I got to, I don't buy it, you know.
You don't buy what?
Well, they're not selling it to me.
But I've got the whole thing there.
I mean, it's like prostitution.
It is?
Yes.
Oh, no, no.
It is.
I haven't decided.
Yeah, I ought to hear.
Will you?
I have to say how old was it to the show?
Do we have any calls about Amsterdam, by the way?
Are the people there really as ugly as I think they are?
We don't have one stinkin' call about that, did we?
Oh, man.
You know, we could have a 97 share in it.
We would not talk about anything that we talk about.
Anyway, by the way, amazingly enough, they're getting incredible response
on the Stanley Cup contested sports channel of Florida,
even with that long convoluted address, which shocks the daylight settlement.
If you liked Fly, the movie, fly the rebate, fly to the sequel,
your love, the album, fly, and the family stone.
It's a family affair.
That's why I'm going this home.
I want to thank you for letting me be fly, so,
but it's not fun in the summer time, too many old testers.
The album, fly, and the family stone.
Let's prove the music.
Get it today.
Let's prove the music.
Take it home.
Let's prove the music.
And get a buzzard.
Oh, yeah.
Well, we're right in the middle again of a real intensive thing here,
and that stuff runs out.
I got to make those bits a little bit longer.
I did do that.
Yeah, I took care of it.
Well, take care of it again.
137 at WIOD.
It's a little ratings party here.
Everybody's just celebrating AMFMPM,
and they're even having a big beat.
I'm off the front of the building.
That's about time.
Lauderdale Lakes.
Hello.
Congratulations, Neil.
Thank you so much, sir.
I got a Morton Downey Jr. spy report just came over the news.
Yeah.
Can I get a drum roll?
Wait a minute.
Oh, boy.
Now they're asking for drum rolls.
What a maniac.
Well, just a second here.
We might be able to do it.
I wouldn't bet.
Yeah.
Today in a Los Angeles County airport,
Morton Downey Jr. went into the men's room,
and was thrown down by three young punks.
His hair was cut, and they painted a swatsook on his face.
Just another routine day for Morton.
Yeah.
Does everybody in the business is listening today?
Can I do a I-95 audition?
Okay, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
All right.
First one.
I-95.
Not bad?
Not bad.
I'll give your name a number to Rose, okay?
Thank you very much.
See, although that only knows where Rose is.
Wow.
Poor Rose.
What's he going to do now?
He bought a house at town.
How do you tell them not to do that?
I told them not to do that.
I told them not to buy a house, especially with your track record.
Yeah.
It doesn't have to be old and be a clown.
Yeah.
You know what we ought to do now?
We ought to play as something in honor of Rose.
What is it called?
Oh, I know what it's called.
It's in the rack here, too.
Now, seriously, this is going to be so perfect for this day.
Here it is.
And we know that Rose is probably monitoring right now.
I'm going to see all the disgusting things we're going to say about them,
even if they are true.
Excellent.
Peter Bouldier was a normal man with a new bride, a lovely home,
and a cushy, local, final job.
Normal, that is, until just three weeks ago.
Peter, is that you?
Of course.
How is the traffic?
It's fine.
Peter Bouldier is suffering from blend, hill, busy names.
Our crime sense is the revoked, Peter.
Are you okay, Peter?
Fine.
Everything's good.
Just great.
Blame-Hill disease is a nervous disorder, similar to Neil Rogers' disease,
but even more debilitating.
Pety, weedy.
It's Friday night.
You know what that means.
What are we calling Mr. Curious?
Oh, God, are you a man or a bird?
Don't let this pathetic creature become a bird, brain.
Send your contribution today and help us find a cure.
Oh, don't do that.
Why not?
We need the egg.
Well, they surely need a big one over there.
I'll tell you that.
140 at WIOD, we have one open line.
It's in Dayton County who want to get in for those last ten minutes,
where we, you think we're using that buzzer?
Oh, God.
I want to tell you, seriously, if they opened up Mike Disney's head and boy Gary.
On the same day.
They had like twin operations.
It would be the shock.
Remember when Haraldor opened up Al Capone's vault?
It would be similar without the bottle, okay?
Similar finding.
I said, you know, I hand what we scrape.
When they say that's great, when they say that's great, when they say that's great,
when they start understanding it, you start understanding it, you start understanding it,
you're in trouble.
Oh, you're in trouble.
Oh, you're in trouble.
Oh, good point.
Because if we start relating to them,
we got a lot of pinheads out there, but at least they got an IQ of,
in a plus, maybe only one or two.
At least it's in the plus column.
They don't owe points.
Okay, here's some Amsterdam information on four.
Hi.
What would you like to know about the people in Amsterdam?
I live near there for many years.
Well, they don't look like burnt out hippies with beards and they don't look like something
out of the sixties, do they?
No, there's only the tourists you're talking about.
You're around here, American Express, and they sit there on this,
whatever the statue is that we're gotten by now,
and they wait for money from home.
They're trying to find themselves, but I don't think they've had any hope.
Yeah.
But the women look like men in Holland.
Well, I could be a little dangerous here.
They always have a wonderful stalker team.
I must say, the Dutch football team.
You mean the women?
No, no, no.
Today, I don't know what the women do, but they make me, bulls, you know, things like that.
And they have a lot of Indonesian food in them.
Yeah, I read about that.
It sounds pretty good, too, huh?
Well, there are also some beautiful hotels there.
Now the most gracious one there is the Amps.
It's all right on the Amps, the river.
Uh-huh.
And if you know what a adult world hotels with a birch-cage elevator and a bad friend
who will the birds go up in it.
But it's a nice place and everybody goes, you're not too bad.
The most wonderful museum in the world you'll find in Amsterdam.
Great.
And then it writes museums.
Well, we got a lot of relics here, though, too, you know.
I know, but I'm a relic, too.
What can I do?
Well, that's all right.
We all hope to be.
But I'm a swinging relic.
Well, that's what counts.
Yeah, listen to me.
So in other words, you like it, right?
Because I'm not 100 percent, you know.
100 percent of what?
Amps, damn.
I'm not 100 percent sure where I'm going.
Oh, well, I lived in Europe for 15 years.
I'll leave my number.
Call me.
I can tell you where to go.
Well, listen, I don't have to call you.
A lot of people tell me where to go every day.
Yeah, well, that's a different place.
Well, probably post-pilot.
West.
Do they rate any of the weekend talks show hosts?
For some reason, they didn't give me the weekends.
And I think I know why.
Mine.
Because the weekends here were pretty disastrous.
But I don't have any numbers for the weekend.
When a whole book comes in in a few days, we'll have that.
Yeah, I want to ask you something else.
What do they rate, Craig?
They don't have ratings for overnight.
Oh, they don't.
They just tap them for the morning drive time.
Still one in the morning.
And well, from five in the morning to one in the morning.
Yeah, well, anyway, I think I'm going to tune in to you from now on.
You've got a live leap.
If you don't mind having somebody that's beyond 35.
Hey, listen, we'll take anybody.
Oh, yeah, gee, thanks.
No, I don't mean it that way.
I mean, as long as you're...
As long as you're breathing, and you got a sense of humor, that's all.
I have a great sense of humor.
Believe me, some of our people stopped breathing years ago.
Yeah, well, I breathe occasionally.
Okay.
Listen, you know, I recommend you to listen to you.
I can't give his name, but with the talk show host from another station.
Well, sure you can give his name.
No, I really can't do that, because he's just fighting to hold on.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, okay. Good luck now.
Okay, thanks a lot.
I appreciate the information.
Bye-bye.
Okay, we have a sizzling call, ladies and gentlemen, on the hotline.
Hi, Neil.
It's Phil, Frantic Saltsman from Haley, I'll see you for the hotline.
So much going on.
