Cheryl and Mitch said why don't we go across to Eli's and have dinner?
It's right across from the hotel and it looks like a good place and we wound up going instead to the palm which was tremendous at the
Anyway, so I said oh, that's funny. You should mention Eli's because we talked about going there last night
This is on the air and I said it's right across from our hotel. Oh
Now here is Mr. Thompson who obviously has a full rich life and does nothing but
Monitor these shows and conjure up all of these fantasies in his mind about everything that's going on and everybody who visits my home and every move that we make
Which is none of his goddamn business and has nothing to do with anything that's on the air
Okay, here are his notes. Okay phone calls
215 East Chicago Avenue. That was the address of this restaurant that somebody gave Eli's and here's the phone number
Hotels near Eli so obviously he called this phone number made up some story about probably needing to
Amit people who I need didn't remember the name of the hotel and what are the hotels in the area near Eli's and here's the Drake the
Barkley the Tremont the Whitehall the Raphael and the Ritz Carlton and as it turned out we did stay at the Ritz Carlton
It's got the phone number for the Ritz Carlton and evidently he after he called the Ritz Carlton
He was able to verify that
The Neorajers or whoever else he asked for Disney were staying there underneath Ritz Carlton
He's got 731 89 security in the name of an individual who works in security at the Ritz Carlton now
What he told that individual only time will tell because we're investigating that even as I speak all right
Coincidentally enough then and I just say this coincidentally
I underline that in red the next day after mr. Thompson's
We nearly got killed in the Renekar
Which you heard that story I so sure everybody remembers that story
Now I'm not can necessarily connecting the two
Okay, that would be reaching pretty far, but it looks bad doesn't it?
You see it looks bad when you keep sticking your tentacles and other people's business people assume things people start to
Assume things together and when you there's one sheet in here and the wish the audience could see this stack
This is only a small portion of the ongoing memoirs all dealing with Neorajers and W I and Z and Zeta and W I O D
There's one several pages in which he's talking to the CDC which is the citizens for decency
Counselor one of these ultra right-wing groups and on one page it says CDC a
Favorite violence towards Sodomites
Good Lord
Mm-hmm and even after that particular date there still are ongoing
Phone calls noted in his own. This is kind of like a diary
Okay
Very illuminating let me just read you one of the phone calls with Dennis Collins November 10th 88
That's three days after we started here on W I O D 11.50 a.m
Tim Williams told Dennis Collins that Gannett was talking with Disney through Williams to make sure Rogers didn't get into this
History of give and take Ray his old station on W I O D my note to Dennis
Interesting that Zeta let him beat on me for 15 months, but is now so very concerned about their rights not being beaten up by Rogers
11 788 that's the day we started on the air here. Yes
Dennis Collins was talking into my machine from his car phone. I have his voice on my tape during this call
Someone called me and would say nothing, but Roger show was on in the background
Dennis and I concluded the call and I replayed message it was an obscene message from one of Rogers listeners and
Dennis and Dennis and Dennis is on here just repeatedly also remember the problems
I had the original problems with my satellite dish when some crank called up the real estate woman who rented me my house
Mm-hmm and the true her got her told her that
Misrepresented himself as being from the city of plantation and that my landlords had been fined retroactive
$500 a day for the satellite dish which was a flagrant line got my landlords crazy
Well, here's another page all dealing with the zoning enforcement in plantation and with the a Roger satellite dish
And with the name of the woman with Murrill Lynch realty who is the woman who handles my the rental of my house
You think that's just another coincidence
And at the bottom of this page here is a description which I won't read because it's nobody's business
Here's a description of the location and the structure of Stan majors house
What on the bottom of this page?
And here are pages and pages very clearly showing these surveillance and taking of license plate numbers and
Notes about Harlan and Bob and some of the other people from Cooper City and
Stem and Joe you know Joe with eight ends and this one and that one
This is a pattern this is like a book and it reads very clearly of someone who is committing the most heinous the most obnoxious and
atrocious harassment
Who is out not only to get neo-Rodgers off the air but just to absolutely destroy my life to destroy
Anybody who stands in his path including Cox broadcasting Guy Gannett broadcasting anybody you name it
And this is America this is this is a legitimate reason
To get up out of bed every morning to conduct hours and hours and hours of this kind of harassment
Mr. Thompson you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I mean I knew because I've lived through it for over two years
Now we're in the third year this month of this ongoing hate campaign all in the name of religion again. Yeah
I knew a
Lot of it but now having all of this in black and white. This is this is incredible shocking
sorry Jay
And I would I just wonder about the legal all these great illegal minds because I'm I my feeling about the law legal profession
You know what it was for now. It's at the all-time low because nobody other than our own attorneys
Nobody really seems to give it damn and you can do anything as an attorney of course here are these hundreds and
Hundreds of letters. You remember American comedy network on the other station. Of course every song parity every one that we played
There is a letter adhered to the record company of the original
Talking about the fact that we on Zeta were playing this song parody and that American comedy network had recorded this without
Obtaining permission and rights etc etc
Now this is common practice in the industry it's done all over the country. Yeah
But here again is this self-appointed individual who's going to determine what we can do on the year what we can say on the year
What you people can listen to and what the standards for the industry are all in his little ivory tower because he has nothing else to do
1027 at WIOD. Here's another great page from this same a bunch of crap. Okay, I can find it the one that says April 1st
Neil's house
April well here it is
Neil's house April 1st. This is last year. Harlan and Bob there
Tags and here we have the license plate numbers of these terrible criminal youth from Cooper City
With all sorts of and then he's even got comments about Harlan bad grades occurred in January
The real dad is Joe
spoke with the so-and-so on 731 80 80 doesn't know Harlan's last name
But he was a senior and confirms that Harlan went to Vegas Harlan flunked and seems like a fruit it says
Well, I hate to break the news to you Jack, but Harlan is not as you would call it a fruit by any stretch of the imagination
Harlan is also far too ugly for anyone to be
Sexually interested, but of course that's the overtone of everything everything comes back to sex
Everything we talk about in this man's mind has some kind of a sexual connotation
Everyone who visits my house is there for sexual purposes, which is incredible because I'm not getting any of it
God only knows what happens when they leave the room
But you talk about an over immacute
Overactive imagination and an overstimulated gland of some sort there or understimulated as the case may be it just incredible
I should read the notes about the Hollywood adult theater shouldn't I that that part is can I read that on the air?
No, you're unfortunately
No, are you sure the last part I don't think about the seats?
I don't think so
Boy, you're hearing some wild rumors Jack. I can't read the thing where he says they're semen dripping from the seats
Boy, I've never seen that I better take my magnifying glass in the next time
Yeah, according to what I said from the detective John Williams and Hollywood who of course gave him this real distorted
bizarre story, you know, but that honest a goodness if we ought to have a TV documentary and
Bring this all on the air and have in all of South Florida really get into this is one of the most bizarre and incredible stories
This isn't just somebody you know doing a little nuisance thing or making a few calls dispenses
This is somebody who is just dedicated his entire existence to the destruction of another human being and of course obviously this radio show
Yeah
10 30 at W on a do you look at that we got several calls on the board already
This is a are you still there? Yes, well, how about that a mobile who hung on for dear life?
You believe it not really and Neil I hate to change the subject after all this stuff
Jack sounds like he really likes you. Yeah, he's a good buddy of mine
This and I was looking calls me every day to see how I'm feeling
Just a joke Jack. It's just a joke. See we have to say that because he has no sense of humor
So if we say something ingest he tries to make it seem as though you know, it was said seriously
I know so in response to that line he was how we say that I call him on the year
I've never called him at home
I've you know, it's just a joke Jack light enough as if J. Will let us use his material. Go ahead sir
Okay, I was listening to winds. I don't know if you heard it
No, sir come on you were listening
Nobody listens to the news
By the way, Rick, can you crank it down? It's hot as hell in here in the morning sometimes for the news. Oh anyway great station
Now the guy that does sports what's his name?
Ron Harrison Ron Harrison almost forgot
He mentioned something he said you know why the dolphins are on W I O D
I don't know if you heard this no
Because there's a 610 kind of team 6 and 10 isn't that cute that cute. Yeah, I don't know if you heard it before
I just want another thing
Mr. Field set it up
Goodbye
What does that mean? I don't get it no, I don't either I don't get either part well
I get the 610, but that's pretty weak. Come on Ron stop knocking the dolphins. Will you please we leave that to Steve over here
Miami hello, hey Neil how you doing good morning. Yes, sir morning. Good. Hi
Neil I'm really sorry to be calling you on this kind of
That note, but I was just wondering it's all turned around for a play is it possible that is it in fact?
I'm not even letting that go on the air, okay?
Because that's just exactly what he wants is to play the wounded soldier and to try to turn the tables
And I'm being oppressed and they're conducting a orchestrating harassment
I don't want we don't give his number or his address
We don't want to be calling him or harassing him. I've made that very clear how many times dozens of times over the year
And whatever in and if it does happen that's his problem. Okay, that's his tough luck
Sonny Fox
Sonny who?
Uh, how y'all doing for Dallas Texas?
By the way, there's a letter to you in here too, Mr. Sonny Jr
Yeah
Phone call from you, I guess it is about drug, Dave Caprita being a drugie or something alleged
I never said anything
Ah, that's yeah, wow, it's funny Jack must have just made it up
And there's also a letter to you from Jack about how I sit on the air on Zeta that you and Don Agony are homosexual lovers
Oh wait a minute. This is Sonny not Greg be excuse me Sonny. I'll give you and Greg so confused
Actually actually I'm calling because we want to take you up
On that offer to extend the olive branch of peace

rambling don't say pile this stat as they say in the pancake business this short stack that i

on today that you're talking about i'm going to have that uh radish there you know they're going to
cut up real nice you know how they have those utensils they're always peddling on a satellite on
those stations where you cut the radishes and the watermelon well somebody had one because i don't
know anybody who's got one of those somebody actually had one and they cut oh it's in public's
well boy they sure know how to cut a radish over there that's beautiful it's almost a shame to

on the all i see both aboard downstairs i mean are you applying for the job sir
one uh i don't know i don't know to maybe get out of the job then give us something to do and
it would also keep him close to the station he doesn't have time oh yeah he's unfortunately oh my
god well maybe that signals a change in the um boy do i have some bad some bad news for you Johnny
dark yeah all those tapes you got in your arm forget it you can't get in there go ahead
serious we got a collar on here and you're a hobnobbing with his slime ball Johnny dark you have
another wrinkled shirt on today exactly i don't want to get too serious again but this this uh
this uh person you talk about jack uh is any of his harassment included anti uh
feminism at all not that i know of uh okay because you could really nail him with that i mean
that would be something there you could go he saves most of his energy for homophobia but uh if you
cross your path even if you're straight as the uh verisono straights brinero's bridge huh isn't
that what they call it brinzo verisono's bridge it does make a difference in other words uh
if you just don't see things from the proper perspective your uh bad guy well i hope you really
uh i hope they really put him away for uh for good and uh he stops uh making your life well let
let me ask you a question just not forgetting about him specifically but if you went on a trip to
Chicago and you've got on the air that you were in Chicago and you found out that that some snoop was
uh making phone calls to restaurants and hotels and to security people and nosing around to find out
where you were would you take kindly to that you think that's part of what uh you know rights to
privacy in this country uh include i'd be slightly pissed yeah slightly pissed that's an excellent
way to put it sir have a great weekend you too okay ten forty three at w i d and then
now then we got these judges and think well you know that's this is america if you want to drive
around somebody's neighborhood there's not much we can do about it and if you want to uh you know
snoop around and interfere with people's rights to privacy i say that's a crock of bs i say that
some of our local a local judges here need a good uh a refresher course you know what i mean
ten forty four at w i o d johnny of course who doesn't care about any of this is here to eat
today he is here to just fill his fat face until he can't fill it anymore he even brought a gigantic
shoehorn from w i n d and sarasota what's that isn't this isn't a buddy bud shoehorn
a mobile on eight hello hi uh nia this is pop the satellite man uh hurt your hands the problem
sound there with those neo non-teens in your development that won't let you have a dish sure
sure the sir there there's nobody in my development who gives a damn about my dish i have no problem
with that the original interference on my satellite dish and i live in plantation and it's well
documented on a sheet i have right in front of my nose the original interference was from someone
who lives in coral gables who's been mentioned today okay because uh uh back by service the plantation

well i know that it works out all three to two from and right well listen do your other
commercial for satellite dish next time sir ten forty five at w i o d i mean i love my satellite dish
but it's like not the end of the world you know what i mean um look at this page here here's the name
of the woman again who's the real estate lady at merrill lynch who uh and the name of the man who
lives at the enemy street who's the head of the what do they call that the um
association yeah guns a mistaken the gods a mistake yeah that's exactly and then that
description of stans house and where you know what what in the world businesses it of this man
where stan lives or what is how he what is that all about huh he's gonna do surveillance down there
two stands not even on the air other than an occasional like yesterday once in a in a very blue
moon i know talk about an obsession talk about uh just pathetic pathetic and then the cause
though with Dennis Collins back and forth that's what i find most interesting in all of this i mean
just numerous two numerous dimension and i i've only looked through a portion of this and there
are thousands and thousands of pages in the other room i haven't even seen yet
now i would Dennis be involved with someone of this ill come and mic tops and on the same station
why would he be involved with this homophobic witch hat i just can't imagine uh we do have an
open line in brown or did five two four w i o d and the palm beach line is open again it's just like
any other day you know they don't care about any of this crap they want to know where the food is
on the cane show today uh from two to four pms a killer two women whose problems with pre-menstrual
syndrome nearly led them to murder plus dr. gale brown or the floor to pms clinic and then from

years before we get through this stack sounds great if we can say that that sounds good i like that aren't
these good ones yes these are some of my favorite short ones these are very short we don't have a
lot of time today they have a lot of very heavy business to take care of like this call in Miami
hello how you doing okay okay i got to i'm trying to talk it no oh jeez well that's a well
give it a shot what is it sir bottled water by the way there's also a great to note in there about
a conversation with Nick that jack had to when before we came here and Nick was very upset that I

you doing great hello Gwen hey hey you going on any sir you're going to eat trips anytime in the air
future any trips yeah because if you do we want to know what hotel you're staying there well first let
me say that uh Alex Bennett yeah yeah now we're getting to the real meager the matter that Alex
really you know today is the first day when i feel that the audience mostly has come back it's
taken me a whole week to get the audience back after him he blew he blew 89% of this audience right
out the window well we're glad you're back and i'm sorry that Gwen didn't get to do the show so Gwen
take my vote for you next there you go now you know how much water that's gonna hold it up for the next
issue this douche bag religious fanatic here i think what what you're doing today is great
thank his underwear out oh absolutely he's been doing that he's been doing this in the dark for two
years i should guess i shouldn't use that expression he's been doing this undercover now that's not
a good one but i'm doing this like uh all by himself now that it also isn't a good one because i'm
anyway i was gonna say something about exposing it but i guess that wouldn't be this so you see
you get boxed into a corner where no matter how you phrase it somebody can make it into something
that it's not but it the the the bright flood lights are going to be on all these activities from
here on in but you know what that you know what this also makes me think about yes okay this this
creep that's following you around about your sex life and all that who does that that doesn't
remind you of these morons like uh gym baker and jimmy swagger same same my genre now my plan is
it might cost you a little bit why don't you get yourself a private investigator oh yeah and have
this douchebag followed and every day that's because i don't have any did i don't have any desire i
don't care where he goes as long as it's not you know near me or any of my friends i don't care
what he does just go live his life see i don't i don't have this voyeuristic desire to know what's
going on with him i've never been with near his house i don't know where it is i don't have any
description of what it looks like and i don't care i couldn't care less yeah but if these judges aren't
gonna help you well we did get we did get it sir we did get another injunction yesterday and if
he violates this one the judge has ordered that any municipal police like a plantation or davi or
whatever or the brown county sheriff our under instructions to arrest him if he violates this
injunction and comes anywhere near me or my house that's good yes but you never know if you had
someone follow him you might uh find him at the Hollywood movie theater well he seems to have a pretty
all i don't know i've never seen any of these things there that he's uh writing about but i guess
i guess i haven't been looking closely and i'm gonna have to start
doing my own little investigation up close in person you know i mean no about all this stuff
okay good point thank you sir hey take care okay that is an excellent point we're gonna have to
start to investigate these some of these things a little more closely and up personal we do have
some open lines on the board i guess i shouldn't say that the audience has come back today we have
three open lines so it's not overwhelming that we're just waiting for a lot of good food to come in
i mean it's this stuff is gonna go to waste which is a shame no no Johnny's here it's okay no
no seriously he's holding back don't you see he's not touching any of that it's like uh that
stuff looks real good but i want to wait for the good stuff because he knows wings plus is coming
that's your way i was coming way i would be surprised if pizza lock shows up i mean i said that
we want a real giant party i hope who would make a cake do we have a sponsor oh i know who do you
know the cheese cake lady oh yeah but it may be too late yeah that's way oh that's way up and brown
somebody will come up with some kind of like a birthday not a birthday but a going away cake
good luck best of luck sharing it's that because this is sharing last day i know
boy is she lucky or what oh you talk about jumping off just at the right time you know
now you didn't find any letters in that mountain of paper de febby in there did you
any not yet okay oh yeah let me know if you run across anything
okay i'll tell you there's uh there's an interesting page here where it talks about bob and
alan and stem and now and i said to somebody the other day you know if if my uh sex life were
really centered around all the here it is right here yeah bob alan and andrew and i thought to
myself i thought about that for a while i said that sounds fine to me i'll never leave the house
unfortunately none of it is true but uh boy kind of what is that like alternating days like on
Monday it would be talk about fantasia talk about just sitting out there in the um oh and there's one
when we were at i and z i got to find this during the break and he's written down the license
plate numbers and he's he's convinced himself that capita drove a black Mustang what he never did
he's got all the cars out in the lot of sign to a different person i leave the building at 1019
that morning and then in the next space he's got written down 1046 am rogers arrives home at such
and such a great implantation so obviously he followed me home on that day and maybe many others
isn't that fabulous but it's america see so you can just run around conducting your own little
subversive surveillance and harassing people and which has a lot to do with what's on the year
doesn't it so in other words if i meet somebody through the show and they want to be a friend of
mine or come into my house then that proves i'm trolling for something on here didn't stand
meet his wife lori through the show i think so didn't i meet big Dave who lives with me but definitely
on the other side of the house through the show also yeah and also stevo met lori all be damn on
their member at a we're gonna start checking into a lot of this and following a lot of people pretty
okay we got henry burrow stanny bye don't follow henry because we all know where he goes that's all
basically the same henries have got the eleven o'clock news we'll come back at eleven oh five with
our number two as the goodbye Sharon party continues look at that there's smeg she never
looked better did she look at that on a joey reddle show and said wag your little tail there smeg
you well i don't want to hear about that look at that where's oh there's joey now who's that
that he's got is that sunny bono i don't know what you're laughing about that guy on the left there
looks just like sunny bono doesn't he he looks like a cross between oh i don't know who that is
with look at the he's got the boy gary's old suspenders who is that guy huh anyway we want to
remind you that smeg green is going to be on a joey rental show today god only knows why what
would prompt him to do that i got me she's a no man she well know you're right she is in heavy
demand kind of like debbie Ellis eleven oh six at w i o d it's our number two on a friday it's
Sharon's party we don't have anything here for it yet but where well we do have the stuff left
over from public thank god for that wouldn't it be embarrassing if we didn't even have that
because rich and johnny dark are both got the whimsical looks under fated like where's this giant
spread we were expecting well it's a little bit early okay why you talk about really sick i
i think jack needs to investigate johnny dark myself i think that's just a joke john just a
little joke north ma'ammy hello no i don't great this i just want to call my cousin Tony disback and
we're back okay good call i kind of has a little meter there a little rhyme that's cute
we have an open line of date at seven five one w i o d seven five one nine four six three
i can't wait for the commercial break to get over with there so we can get to the important part
of the joey rental show today yeah now we'll probably be really um hard pressed for calls this
our bs now what what is it you're doing you're not turning the sound up are you
no no no no no turn it down we we're not going to start re-broadcasting channel 10 on the year
okay it's bad it's hard enough to watch it we don't want to listen to it west palm beach hello
yes sir uh just here to prove that uh people appear do care now i've been care about what
uh you said people appear don't care and i've been holding for quite some time because i do care
i wanted to speak you in glen have you seen the joey rental show sir on tv no i
i trust well oh there's mag she really looks great that she heyes mag how you doing go ahead sir
it means nothing do you any of this right that's absolutely right that's it's an elephant too that's
a good sign a couple things number one as far as your uh this individual in choral gables you
mentioned something earlier that uh there's campaign have been stepped up after you would cow cow
to him and taking certain things no no wait wait wait a minute i didn't count on station station
there you go okay well i think that just proves it's like you're dealing with little children when
you give them reinforcement they keep doing what they're doing i don't think in this case i
don't think it makes any difference i mean this individual is so obsessed and so driven by this
i mean doesn't have any other purpose for getting up in the morning i mean this is all he does
sure well you don't you don't you think if they give him encouragement well it doesn't it doesn't
he'll just do it even more it doesn't help that's for sure um does that i'd like to know can you
enlighten me as to what where we stayed in chicago what that has to do with what's on the ear and
cleaning up the earways can you tell me what that has to do with any nothing but if you can
better yet of all this i've been listening to if you can prove that he was the guy that was
making misrepresentations regarding your satellite dish uh-huh well it's not a really good legal
case against it well it's all right there in the telephone records because the real stately
lives in brown he lives in date i've already uh uh through through various uh stuff that's been
slipped under my door anonymously i've already seen certain telephone records which are
incredibly incriminating and uh you know you just put all this together and it's right there in
black and white well as you have if you have as you have said there's a lot of things that
that are immoral and he shouldn't be doing but that legally uh nobody's going to even slap his
hand for but um what you've described as far as if you can prove he was doing that with about
the satellite dish and impersonating these other people and trying to get it taken out um i think
you're going to nail him on intentional inflation of emotional distress if that i hope that's one of
the counts in your lawsuit and uh you get punitive damages and get to get into his financial record
now you don't get anything this man got he hasn't got two nickels to rub together in his name
he's got everything in his wife's name so it's uh you know it's just an exercise sure
it well a lighter note um i listened a little bit to uh bill calder this morning and he told a
caller who didn't know his name he was trying to give her a t-shirt he says well do you know
what my name is and uh she didn't and he said well it's Glenn Hill be sure to ask for
Glenn Hill he did yep right before the end of the show don't get him started again i thought it
was kind of cute it was yeah oh even you thought it was cute well the bill calder's talking about
me yeah i think that's cool what you ought to hear what he says about you now he was he was he was
just being cute and funny yeah just an you know that's bill it was fun listen i enjoy your show and
and uh tell your uh station manager or whoever to um this the show's good now but it was better
um the first month or two when you first came here well no question about that but then they
start taking all you know everything away and getting uh well he's busy changing underwear right
but as soon as he finishes i'll pass the message have a great weekend thank you bye bye
bye you'll be all right be believable okay eleven we've got a card for everything in here
what Laurie major no that has to be a mistake isn't it
uh hello there it is Neil yeah hi how you doing okay it's not a mistake but i just had to say
something first i'm so glad you're able to talk about all this stuff well i'm sure
interested to see this nice description of your house it's very accurate that's what i'm calling
about i was floored when stand told me last night but i want your listener why you better govern
yourself accordingly Laurie absolutely um what i want your listeners to understand one thing which
is really interesting to the extent that this man goes to all right that um first of all
stand did not start living here and so after he and i were married which was more to 88
and okay i'll give you the date of this it's June 7th 88 okay and then he was shortly off the air
after that right this house is in my name and it's not like you're here all the time you know you're
welcome here all the time you know that but it's not like you're here every day i never i'm never
there i don't think i've been here twice but yeah you've been here a couple of times and you know
we've been over there a couple of times and stand goes over very infrequently with no pattern
or anything else and that's what i mean it just like really got into my gut last night i mean what
an invasion it really it like that you're good how about this thing about chicago where we nearly
got killed and here's the evidence in this man's handwriting of these phone calls and the hotel we
were staying at and he calls the overnight late night security guy and god only knows and we're
investigating all of that right now but what in the world does this have to do with anything other
words we go out of town and it's his business where we're staying no i mean that that is just amazing
it is just absolutely in front of the public they're just beginning to get an inkling of the kind of
invasive kind of thing that's been going on here for two years where you practically don't it
can't even leave the house i know absolutely and to know where where my house is i mean if that was
just like i said that to stay on my side but this house is in my name i mean it's not like you can
go look in public records and find that this is stand major house that's what's real well you got
to understand most of this doesn't have to do with public records it has to do with following people
that's what it has to do and license tags mm-hmm yeah well that's you know that's interesting enough
in itself yeah how some but just a private person can start pulling all that kind of
information well when you don't have anything else to do when it's a 20 hour day occupation i
guess you have plenty of time to do these things and of course i'm fascinated by this long list
back and forth of telephone conversations with Dennis Collins from w n w s which i find very very
embarrassing for them over there uh remember the lunch and add with Dennis yes i do and the pumping
session about you on the pretense of a job yeah uh information gathering session that's it
well nice work Dennis you can't beat me on a year in a rating so you have to try to give me out of
the market nice work incredible okay one thing Dennis Collins is no J are youing because he would have
never gotten caught in something like this that's for sure take care of Neil covering yourself
according i absolutely well bye bye eleven eighteen at w i o d we have an open line in day 751
w i o d and a line in brown or did five two four nine four six three five two four w i o d we're
just sitting here very casually awaiting the arrival look at that smeg is still on there boy this is
and look at this who's who's first through the door with but the Arnold family from Arnold's
royal cancel ladies and gentlemen with big smiles on their faces with rings on their nose and bells
on their toe here they are right from royal cancel that's great well this will be a good little
appetizer for you john get your started cleans your palate a little bit what's in the bag oh my
god now i want to tell you something Spencer said he was coming next week and bringing me cigars
but you remember the last cigars you brought me i ran i i smoked them all and i don't have one
cigar in a house and i was just in need of cigars and look at that isn't that incredible it isn't
credible oh well i don't want these uh okay what a guy thank you way and that's great and what is
this picture oh yeah that's about those nilly burgers that they got at Arnold's that's a sign in
a window there's a little picture for those who don't believe it and even a little a little lighter
i'll be damned well how does that work i'm not too familiar with that kind of stuff like a pen
i'll be damned well don't waste all my fluid thank you thank you very much that's nice isn't it
boy i bet you could do a lot of interesting things with that anyway it's 20 past 11 if you're
a little commotion in the background it's because the first wave of food is coming now we should get
sharing in here for some of this because it's her party shouldn't we feed her it wouldn't that be
the appropriate thing to do well i would think so wouldn't that be the gentile thing gentile thing
yeah gentile anyway it's 20 after the hour we're going to kind of get this all arranged Johnny over
there is just starving by the way give him a little something to keep him from being so
yeah a little fat rate there's one box for Johnny and fat rates those nilly burgers anyway can
i talk about wings plus while we're small enough not fair i just took a bite of this little bacon
and nilly burger you know and he starts playing that jingle that's disgusting Nick
but we won't have nicta kick around anymore starting on monday according to the rumor line it's
what fat rich told us and the bird said fat riches aligners i'm not sure if we should believe it
here's a mobile and broward i bet they're gone right no don't hear how you're doing what i
this now this is a loyal listener you've been hanging on for a long time spending big bucks
yeah well i have important things i heard the governors in town and i'm real at first time
caller by the way long time listener and uh if the governor does call you today i want you to do
two things want tell him about this lunatic down and call spring maybe he could extra
die to them out of the state but when you're done your conversation make sure you tell them
to govern himself accordingly okay thank you okay hmm uh ludic in cross brings
haha 26 past uh eleven at w i o d here's a little note says norm says good things are happening
don't mention it on the year oh we have an open line in broward at five two four
w i o d oh good things are happening with my satellite oh isn't that great well yeah things
the worm is starting to turn these last couple of days dramatically oh good what's good
i guess they got all the papers in and we're on the agenda and i'm going to get my permit
i won't have to unplug my dish today after baseball season and of course i may want to
of course the fact rich is kind of smugging complacent here today because he knows the cubs are
starting paul killgust this afternoon against the cardinals which is an act of hearing sanity but
you know we'd like to make it close now that we're game in a half again uh we'd like to make it
a little bit close give the cardinals a fighting chance and of course they're not stirring anybody
only migraine today so no big deal poor de mezz playing tidewater oh the pirates boy pirates
doesn't it reminds me about the three game sweep in new york the last time the two teams met boy
that was i guess a bad stroke a luck by the mints station to probably save some of those runs
from yesterday i bet you davie johnson and i will be thinking boy when we lose four to three
in tenonings we should have saved a couple of those runs uh Atlanta is this a joke hello
yeah hey Neil yeah are you really an Atlanta is this a put on swear i swear i am well you'll be if
you stay there long enough you'll be swearing for a long time i'll tell you that you think

at the times now now everybody loves the bird we've we've gotten that out of our system he had a
great call from Greg butel today people at love 94 want to kiss and make up they love him
mm-hmm it's true it's true really yeah it seems to have all blown over dissipated yeah dissipated

i don't like being here but i wouldn't go outside on a weekend they have a lot of lynchings on a
weekend up there in Atlanta you know and if you're from out of town see one thing about they're not
into race anymore they don't care about that it's just you can be white black or purple but if
they don't like the way you look they might just uh pick on you you know what i mean well i don't
know i think they might have you over for dinner so to speak yeah right i i'm i i must stand out
in the crowd or something to hear do you yeah every time someone sees me they think they say oh you
must be from out of town yeah it's probably that spirit you've been wearing you know i would probably
i'd change my wardrobe a little bit okay listen when you come it back i'll be back i'll be back on
Monday for about six hours and then i got to go to bolexie mississippi hey listen well call us

and i'll have some of these great cigars if i can ever get it lit all three brow lines as dead
as the proverbial door nail huh well you get the feeling this audience is really really behind
us don't you like they couldn't give a damn less they could be firebombing our cars in the parking lot

not going to the concert hold on a minute now okay okay uh very important call oh wait a minute
hold on hello what happened hold on hello hello we were we sure got a mess on this phone yes sir
hello this is the call we've been waiting for with baited breath bill yes i was getting out of my car
entering the call to parking lot when i heard you mentioned the fact that uh bob martina looks a
lot like uh bell of the go see uh huh you were right they have so much in common they both suck
and and really struck a chord that i got news for that's the first fine line you've ever come up with
i keep trying i i will tell you this bob martina has done so much for racing that uh you could
tell why we're uh two years behind on death story uh yeah well he's certainly an expert he knows a lot
about him uh listen he knows about it much about racing as he does about running the state
i got by the way listen i hate to keep interrupting but an old friend of yours called and left a
message just before you punched him you wouldn't believe it you want to hear it yeah long me 50 dollars
uh Larry Larry yeah what a guy huh what a kidder guy um anyhow i call because i got up to my office
i turned on the radio and i heard you saying to Glenn of Phil hasn't called and i didn't know
had you requested a call was there something about all a guy called in it's too late now the guy's
really probably going to blow his brains up but he was on his way to the track and he said if he got
anything today and we hadn't had time to look at the entries and i said i'll tell you what we've
never done this before but we'll put Phil on the spot and he'll surely be listening right now
and he'll call right in and give you a horse today i must have been walking through the parking lot
when it happens yeah sure i'll give him a horse yeah sure try me melissa in the six okay i got
i got a better one than that big Joey with my Gonzalo you're you're at the late in the dollar i know
i know i know 21 bucks huh uh yeah and the bird's horse came in second and it was a 61 dollar
perfected there um huh bike wrote him like uh like he was our caro came in on the rail saved all
the ground and that's my my Gonzalez for there yeah really great race with that horse
anyway so you guys aren't picking any horses today no uh huh all right well there's always a
took Monday Tuesday Wednesday oh no Wednesday right yeah whatever day it is right whatever well
there's always Sunday i don't think i'm gonna get out there this weekend because uh i forgot that
the cubs cardinals games are all day games and i have a feeling that i just may have to forego the track
i see i may have to forego it as healy adoro justina is what it's that right well if you don't make
it then i guess so we'll see you uh the the following weekend no question about it all right
save me a seat take care and i'll talk to you next week here what i said what save me a seat you
see you later you got it five well he did eventually call in but uh you know he's had a rough life
you know three minutes till noon at w i o t oh yeah and veggie was on boy you have more problems
when you called i mean god and i was nice enough to stay on but i was an important call it wasn't
it was very important it was touting on the air trick you learned from his old friend Hank Goldberg
yeah well you know i just called to give you a few of those things that went on in uh just
saying hi and saying i'm still alive oh so in other words you were done anyway
oh actually i was just saying you know hey i'm still alive and still listening you guys great
so i'll be talking to you next uh my my about a month from now it would be a real good day to call in
all right take it easy guys bye bye i wasn't that great he didn't overdo the welcome today i guess
he understands hmm he knows the lay of the land anyway in the noon to one hour we're gonna be reading
about 300 letters from jack's collection here uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
letters to everybody in the business several letters to Dennis Collins in there i find it
fascinating by the way we're not gonna be reading letters today jacks just to chill out but uh
no most of the letters he signs j b Thompson yeah with that very uh distinct handwriting the letters
he writes to Dennis Collins he signs jack really like their buddy friend close yeah well i guess it
coincides with all those phone calls going back and forth too i guess the philosophy of w snooze
we can't beat him so let's get him off the air that's the Dennis Collins philosophy at wold see if
i would general manager of a station in the market and word got out that i was consorting or
communicating on a fairly regular basis back and forth with somebody of this illke i'd be
embarrassed humiliated and degraded i couldn't even face uh the employees i'd probably go into the
closet so to speak and shut the door never come out again you know what i mean Dennis kind of a
i was gonna say it's kind of embarrassing but when you're used to the books that they get
the embarrassment factor has to be so great before it starts sinking in it doesn't make any
difference you know but i do like their demographics and we're gonna be all getting our pollen and
out after the newscast just in honor of them chuck mire has got the one at the uh one o'clock news
but he's gonna bring it to you at noon and then we'll come back at twelve oh five
some time
anymore
i
st
okay
drop off during that new news don't they? They really just go nuts. Well it's
about something exciting. Okay we can we can we tell us now? Yeah. What? Well no Steve
has some we all let you do it. He's got some very exciting positive news. Thank
goodness it two o'clock. Great thing happened and then you'll understand why he's
been like kind of in and out the last couple of days but as it always does in the
end Jack just as prevailed. You know what I'm saying? So govern yourselves accordingly Dennis
and Jack and Mike and all our good friends out there in radio land. Oh now did you
you were busy so you didn't hear about the letter? Well it's not a letter about this page
about when we were in Chicago that weekend? No. And it has well it's interesting because
here's Eli's and I mentioned people were calling in when I did that show and they were
saying hey you got to eat at this place you got to eat here. Eli's was a very great
steakhouse which we didn't get to but the day I did the show listen to this very important
day I did the show somebody called and said you got to try Eli's and I said oh that's
right across from our hotel. Well our friend our dear friend Jack got Eli's number and
then got a list of all the hotels that are in the area right there by Eli's and it's
sure enough here is the Ritz Carlton hotel which is where we were staying and then called
this individual whose name is here in security and wouldn't you know just by coincidence and again
I'm not suggesting anything I'm just saying it and bizarre coincidence the next day we had that
episode and nearly got killed in our rent a car so you see when you keep them and of course this
has a lot to do with what's on the year on the state that when we were staying in Chicago and
nosing around and playing Sherlock Holmes this has nothing to do with anything and it's certainly
not a his business or anyone else's but when you start messing around and I've an
of course something happens then people are going to put two and two together and start
assuming things you know what I mean so I think perhaps our friend is just overstepping his bounds
to the point where who knows what's going on not of course to mention all these contacts with Dennis
Oh well that's another thing yeah but I guess we better all govern ourselves accordingly we do
have some open lines on the board now one in brown or at five two four W I O D and Boka and
Palm Beach are as dead as the proverbial door nail yeah but he in three days thank goodness now he's
got his healthy appetite back everything worked out nothing after a great meal like a great just
stick with nor just stick with norm can I'm telling you if you would just listen to his radio show
you'd you'd pick it up just from that show that that show is so brilliant you can you can
perceive that anything you hand over to him you'll handle with brilliance and a plum
you tell him about all that talent under one root guess yeah all the three there we were in that
courthouse and there were the three greatest tacos in a history of broadcasting all in one building
at the same time in a year Rogers Steve Kane and Norman Elliott it was shocking really was
like they brought in extra security because they thought that you would never be the same
oh my god that's right five hundred thousand listeners and two
and Norm said I've got at least three or four because my friend listened and I said no I know
you don't have any friends so cut the crap anyway twelve thirteen at W I O D and the Steve just
eating like like he never saw food before he said first time in three days well that's
her is thank goodness for that yeah by the way post abilities is bringing in tons of food to
our remote it specs this Wednesday it says uh for riches grinning from earlobe to earlobe they'll
have loads of sampler items pastas pastas salads and everything that's ever been invented okay so
that's all the more reason I know is that for the crown or is that just for rich you'll have to
come by and find out for yourselves and Dion's gonna be there too I know we'll feed Dion Miami hello
Neil yeah speaking of cheap cigars and bad radio I'm glad Steve is there I was listening yesterday
turn on my car radio in the afternoon and there's Stan right now you're gonna not start ripping
Steve no no no no I realized the show wasn't much but you're not gonna start ripping him on no no no
that's not what he was over the house last night and I promised him his birthday is that tomorrow I'm
gonna take him to dinner that's not why I'm called he invited me to take him to dinner I didn't say
it wasn't mine no no honestly I'm not calling to rip him but the thing that is amazing how did all
the juniors know since it wasn't advertised every junior in the world that ever called him
called yesterday oh that's the junior computer pipelines here they have they have got a computer
thing a chip that they put in their computers and as anytime Stan is on here anywhere that immediately
sent along it's amazing and the well but one thing I do want to get a little spire report he did
go through the garbage yesterday and found that article about the Chicago AM station that's going
talk yeah I threw that he mentioned to me last night that he saw and I thought to myself she I
threw that in the waist basket how did so he was so desperate he was digging in the garbage well
but I wanted to say he what his comment was that how that station went and tired every single nobody
and lousy talk show host in the country yeah Stan if you're listening not everyone
and that's I'm believe me I'm not that's no put down or nothing I've been listening to
anyway listen the best of those tapes you've got to start doing it immediately of those letters
by the I was hysterical when you're reading those letters if you got to do it okay well listen I
only have enough here to last till two years from sookas so I'll see what we can do it one thing
though how we miren and andy are all nickheads and this is the last day we can call people nickheads
okay and govern yourself accordingly by you read open read on the air what I've been reading a lot
of the stuff this is all public uh stuff now because it's public record well I read the one that he
wrote to you you didn't hear that what did I do that no no this was about uh that I said something
about you showered uh my daughters or something here's the one to Greg Budelle and here's a phone
called the Dennis Collins uh eleven ten eighty eight uh there's also a little you know he's got
these little notes in here and one of the notes that he couldn't sleep on November second because
he was worried about what I would say on your show remember I came on your show before I started
working here and here's a little note remember a Joe with three ends our friend Joe out there
by the way Jack Joe is like 22 years old okay I guess that's still not old uh how old does
somebody have to be before they can come into studio I mean I'm not saying that I would old
enough to do something with them because that has to be over 80 I already know that Jack all right
but I mean just to look at him and talk about they got to be like 40 50 you know what I'm
interested in why is he talking to my old boss Dennis Collins from W.O. Wells is I don't know but
there's sure a lot of conversations back and forth and there are letters and there is a relationship
well for example November 7th 88 which is the day I started on W.O.D. it says Dennis Collins was
talking into my machine from his car phone and uh goes on I mentioned that earlier but it's
certainly bear mentioning again because there seems to be this somewhat incestuous relationship
between and then here Neal's home April 1st Harlan and Bob were there Jack was busy outside
surveying tag information request what you were in court yesterday you heard about these about
this police investigation that Jack was conducting even though of course he's not a member of
law enforcement but it's fascinating but the best one of all that was about the Hollywood movie
theater though no that's fine you know what I think I got a copy from Norm of a lettery sent
talking about how he had written Janet Reno oh yeah for relief okay and Norm pointed out to him
you know it's interesting that you would expect relief from a lady who you falsely accused of
being a lesbian during the year Jack say that oh my god anyway
March 14th 89 Detective Murray remember that thing that was we'd affect the normal here on the show
we talked about that Hollywood that terrible dirty theater with all those movies that you would
enjoy well nobody talked he did talk to Detective Murray of course from the Hollywood police uh the
vice-pig and it says Hollywood Rogers is known at theater for trying to pick up guys in theater
in bathroom oh my god now I must say that's a that's a technique I've never learned yet although
certainly I'll think about why did Jack has been surveying in well listen and then it says
semen drips down theater seats and was when Murray was there once he's been doing a close-up
and personal I mean even more he's safer wouldn't do investigative reporting like that
we're wondering you guys say about Jackie's thorough well I don't know that's the word
incredible anyway 12 9 10 W whatever it is and well listen I'm gonna give you my
timber this weekend I'm going to Key West and there's this gay bar there they got this gigantic
restroom okay it's incredible it's the size of Mount Rushmore can you give the phone number for
Jack well no as a matter of fact that I found somebody's phone number on the wall there was
of embarrassing uh coca-cola pre-killer hello yes deal I called you today well isn't that something
uh it's amazing I could dial that past but anyway I left out something I was gonna call one of my
friends which is the quain series Rodney's listen and tacking up his horse right now Rodney's
an idiot sir Rodney is an idiot well that's an understatement of course correct but I'd like to
call him and a couple other outriders douchebags of the most severe kind okay and that's a new movie
coming out douchebags of the third kind and it is also a unique kind of guy really well it sounds
like we got more investigating going on boy a lot of investigators in this time you all better
govern yourselves and that's it okay thank you so much I can't believe Phil had a line today can
you believe that that I never heard Phil Saltsman track it a really hysterical line but that was
pretty good he said that the governor martina's not only looks like Bella LaGosie but he has
something else in common they both suck which I thought was excellent anyway we got the cigars
here and everybody's in a good mood and Steve is he was chain eating here like oh and I got
another cigar that's right from Steve hmm well this is just a little one well I don't mean that
literally but anyway we want to yeah I got to find that letter that he wrote to you on February
the 8th February 13th 1988 busy day and a busy day was writing a Gregory Benjamin also I can't
find him but I'll find him over the weekend I'll I'll redig through here and put him in order
great there's some letters to Rick Shaw and there's one where he confuses he thinks Rick Shaw is the
Rick of Rick and Spud and he says the dear mr. Shaw I'm paraphrasing that Jack you'll have to
excuse me but I can't find it right at the moment he says Raju's this morning said that you and
Spuds are homosexual lovers and etc etc not Ricky Tickie you dummy come on Jack you've got to get
your Rick right you know what I'm saying he's got all his ricks confused 21 past noon at WIOD
Toyota one moment for you you've the stack of paper it's like swamped you February 13th 1988
boy that's that same day he was a busy job on that day wasn't it a busy camp Motown record
corporation Hollywood California Ray the Temptations dear Motown and this is for all the listeners who
you know wondered why they couldn't hear that stand major theme song it was the best thing J.
Michaels ever didn't his life I see yeah and it's common practice in the industry to do song
parodies nobody gives it to you know dear Motown not dear anybody in particular but dear Motown
guy guy gannet publishing company of Portland main owns two radio stations in Miami WINZ in Zeta
these two stations have been played migrale originally sung by the Temptations are written by
Smoky Robinson but set to different lyrics the new song is used as a theme song for stand major
attack show host on WINZ I doubt Motown has authorized alteration of lyrics of this great hit
I have tapes of this song is played on the air I strongly suggest you contact me before relying
upon any of your insurances that their lawyer or his clients might give you sincerely then there's
another great letter about to George Steinbrenner at the end he says PS I wish the Yankees best of
luck in their penance stretch drive this year I guess it didn't help last year it seems to me they
didn't quite make it but I don't know how jack has time to see any games well no he didn't he just
wished him luck just to kind of oh add a little syrup to the ointment there okay we got a lot of
open lines here folks this is your last chance it's either either you call in now or we're going
to eat celery on the air for last hour and a half okay that's your choice what is that oh from
two to six p.m. oh the parents of murdered children's been postponed until Monday okay well we
didn't want to get you to depressed for over the weekend so we're saving that one for Monday on
Steve's show and then today p.m.s a killer two women whose problems with pre-menstrual syndrome
nearly led them to murder plus dr. Gail Brown of the Florida p.m.s clinic and Alice on Monday morning
when he returns from vacation has got b.m.s which is another sub Florida syndrome that his audience
can relate to okay let's go to for Lauderdale hello hello Neil yes sir I'm thinking after hearing
these things about your friend Jack that maybe he's just going out of his way to cover up his own
little problems by picking on you you don't think so do you think he's got problems I think he's
probably a closet a closet queen and uh it's probably going out of his way to prove just some hot
to is by picking on you or maybe it's a jody foster syndrome maybe you should start watching over
your shoulder maybe he's going to come to your house some night in the middle well he comes to my
house uh the judge said yesterday that he's going to get his answer rested so I don't think he ought to
come anywhere near my house well what's hope he does because he needs to be arrested he needs to put away
well he needs some airing out I'll tell you that these are long rests somewhere absolutely true okay
sir thank you you know it's an interesting question jack jack records and listen to this do you
as these things you don't think he's looking today do well monitor what can I ask you this
yes what else would he do he's got a lot of correspondence to catch up but do you think as he
listens to these you know these factual things he's written come out over there do you think he is
embarrassed by that no no he's outraged because he you know he just as sure as could be that we're
twisting and distorting and of course he should it would be an expert at twisting and
distorting because that's what he does to everything that I say on the air and he's been doing it
for over two years now but the bloom is off the rose as Steve would say and jack you're just going
to have to get used to it because this is only the beginning we're going to discuss in any damn time
we feel like it and all of this stuff is a matter of public record we're going to get some good
of holly Ridge strings music to play in the background as every day we'll have the best of jack and
read some of these letters on the air I think it makes great radio yeah oh some of these are just
in crowd almost as good as eating almost no that's pretty bad radio oh man some of these
will take a while too it'll kill some good time we won't have to worry about these stinkin phone
calls here's a mobile on the Palm Beach line hello hey how you doing today great good lunch huh
oh yeah excellent lunches today brother you go to finger lakes yes I did as a matter of fact and
they still had those same cripple horses running it was great the Rudy still there yeah they're all
there you go the trotters while you up now yeah I went to the tab you downs they're all still there
too David Vance and all those people Robbie Rankin the whole bunch they're still up there in
battalion I got the daily news last week and I'm looking at the results of the anchors and there's
Maclotelle I thought he wasn't stunned well he was for a while in Europe and then they brought him
back to racing again I I wish they would have retired him because I think I think they're really
pushing their luck at this point he has nothing left to prove but they're still racing him
he was a trot was like 250 thousand dollar trot at all right you didn't get down to Norwich
to Norwich sure where the hell is that my hometown I thought you knew all the cities in
New York I never heard of Norwich down towards Binghamton Hamilton Earlville no no I mean I know Binghamton
and I know Ithaca but that southern tier down there that's kind of like foreign country to me I
don't know too much I know more like Lackawanna and Vittavia and Leroy and Tana Wanda no not
Pocano Montenegro now see that's not upstate New York that's down by the New York almost
that's in the Catskills us we go there you go on the onta Verona Cooper Town yeah well listen have
a great day sir because I'm about ready to go into a coma 29 past noon sounded like he was
going to break into a chorus of the Jewish Pocano is there for a second isn't it I was just
see done reciting he's done name got it baby you got it I think about that card I like the best
is that it's so muffled you know I know it's perfect so it would fit on almost any station in
the market like if you heard it on WLD with that muddy sound of theirs it would fit right in with
okay open line in Boka 278 9463 and what in Palm Beach at 655 WIOD were Lee Fowler is really
setting that town on fire isn't he he's kind of like Mrs. Murphy's cow or whatever that was
here's a mobile and date County hello hey Nick how you doing okay Joe hey listen I have a question
I'm Nick Thompson I don't see him in the phone book anywhere what do you want sir does he exist
yes well I was looking why would you be looking why would you be looking in the phone book
well I needed to find out whether the guy existed yeah he exists sir but I'm afraid you don't we
have an open line in date County 751 9463 751 WIOD Miami hello hello Neil did you mention who is
the guest on the Ellis Rubin show today the Ellis Rubin show yes who is it well I don't know
I was wondering oh man we got a bunch of pin rings here this hour and what happened we were going
along just fine we finished lunch I think was our mistake and all these would be comedians are
calling an auditioning now okay it's like the Ted Mac amateur hour or major bows Johnny's old
enough to make your bows here's a mobile in Boka hello actually it's a model gable well thank god
for that absolutely I never better watch where you're driving down there now you know I'm taking my
license plate so if I don't want to be monitored exactly I mean he may find out that I'm the Duke
you know my god you know what I'm saying you better give us that license plate number so we
can check it out okay I just never knew that there was a place in upstate New York called only
yet uh yeah I want to get to be here uh yeah in fact the fat Riches from there I just think that
you know maybe like an only in to about a year about an hour and a half baby a day would be perfect
for the Jack the Jack Chronicles how about that Neil I don't know if we could get it in in an hour
and a half well we'll do our best this is the most entertaining I've heard not that you're not
always entertaining me oh but you know I'll tell you once we get into some of these letters boy you
talk about entertaining talk about a live it imagination may you just it'll just uh open up new horizons
for you well this is definitely plays into the heart of most people today with the new TV uh
scandal shows that they have now you're doing it on radio for us it's wonderful yeah
yeah now what do you think about that Dennis Collins the WNWS what do you think he's going to have
to say for himself when we take his deposition in a few days uh oh what do you do for that me too
are you gonna serve lunch I'll come to yeah we got something special we're gonna serve Dennis
pardon the expression yeah all right okay see you in only at uh well don't forget to be true to
your show this weekend Neil okay bye bye why a little hyper there wasn't it's a ducker 1232 at WIOD
you're not suggesting there's more than one or two contacts with Dennis Collins numerous two
numerous dimensions one or two hundred and that's only in this stack I haven't gotten to the other
45 billion pages in the other room there yet would but I would like a conspiracy but I will I
didn't say that see now I think you ought to just kind of remove yourself from all of this and just
uh oh the question I don't I have now I would never allege such a thing because I know what I
I don't think that Dennis as desperate as his ratings are and as geriatric as his demographics are
and his tenuous as his job probably is with Jefferson pilot I don't imagine that Dennis would ever
stoop to such a level because the things that I hear about him would indicate uh he might
well that's why you see I would never say anything like that because what I've learned on the
air is our job is to ask questions we're not there to get here to try to jump to contusions like
Jack does and try to put two and two together and get eighty seven we're here to try to probe what's
going on out there in radio like this thing you try to open your mind what pro you can't say
you know trying to think of another alternate term but there aren't any there's several that came
to mind but also in the same category could easily be misunderstood by alcyx up at the FCC in
Washington and all these other great bureaucrats who are listening very very carefully to see who's
naughty and who's that of course we know that there are a lot of great liberals like Jesse Helms
and people of this ilk who are really very concerned that they want to keep everything in fact
we could play tinkerbell every day for 24 hours and probably still be in a certain degree of
absolute clinkerbell well you know what that tinkerbell I understand I know it's first of all
first of all tinkerbells are fair to begin with that's correct that is correct well I guess Rick
and Spud's are out of the closet after all 1234 at wio.d we do have an opening in bokeh man Nick
is doing a hell of a business on that bat line today I got news for you he is taking orders so fast
278 9463 is that bokeh number we desperately want to hear from bokeh and Delray because oh look
at that is this the men's tennis oh that was martin I'm sorry 37 at wio.d we have an open line in
the palm beach I feel like I've said that so many times this since I came back and of course Harvey
Bennett what was his name Alex Marshall Alex Bennett Alex Trebek who did that show it's going to
take me a good two weeks to get the audience back no you think I'm joking I'm serious it's going
to take me two thousand weeks to get the whole audience back it's it's improving as each day
goes by but he must have blown a good 90% of the audience right out the window he was great wasn't he
happens every time you go on vacation now about 80% what are you saying when he does it it's about 80%
what happens when I go on no no I don't know I didn't know what no no yeah well he doesn't
what I go on I didn't you took it wrong your paranoia oh I took it wrong now what I what I what I
meant now I don't know what I meant can I tell you what I know I take anything wrong yeah I know
what I would no let me tell you what I meant all right take it back no what I meant was that
I meant to imply that every time I go on vacation and you know the guest host said and it takes me
like a week to get everybody back was what I meant I didn't mean you well I never sit in for me I
was talking about my myself yeah say that you say that what about that yesterday
well we'll find out today if anyone's left because Stan is already I'm so great
I am so grateful for Stan sitting in I could kiss him I mean I was in desperate
rates yesterday and we could arrange that I think we get a couple of letters on it yeah a few
nor normative another stack up to the ceiling in the okay now do you hear that Jack a Steve wants
to kiss Stan right on the cheek and Stan has been a kiss him on the rose okay let's get wow this
ought to be good for another 20 or 30 letters we get that what do they call it the word generator
what do they call it they word processor boy I bet the thing is just turning it out if I just
get flow out of it yeah yeah you go to the cables you can hear it yeah yeah click it yeah
click it yeah it's a mobile and date hello
yeah okay while he was nervous he thought if he got on the ear here he'd have his license plate
taken down he got nervous and chickened out deer field you're now yeah
yeah you're correct what if it is a what if it is what if it's what if it's what's it to you oh I
sure have an open line and brown word 524 w.o.d yeah he's my favorite he calls it all the
different lines now he just he gets around like the beach boys he gets around let's see what are
we going to do Miami hello hello yeah let me tell you something I'm sitting here on my orifice
you're sitting on your orifice yeah well I'll be damned I I throw a boy off this is for a living I'm a dog
and uh uh uh uh uh he's familiar with the Baker Act is any Steve just walked out a little
time ago don't even get into that sir don't let's start getting into you know those things on a
year what the Baker Act oh if you're familiar with the Baylor Act yes I am okay can I use you a
serious question though you you're not a homeowner if yes I am you are yeah I don't own the
home I live in he's talking about the Jim Baker Act in no not the Jim Baker Act seriously the
Baker Act at the Jim Baker Act although I guess in his case it did apply it does for the net you
are a homeowner I I was at one point in time sued for liable and it was covered under my homeowners
insurance policy I didn't know you were a homeowner if you rent what what covers liable what are
you talking about sir what what the hell the what does homeowners insurance have to do with liable
no that's not liable it's liable liable you're a doctor absolutely oh my god I think you've been
looking at too many of those lately sure it's 1240 20 to one at W I O D he told us in the
beginning what kind of doctor you look and we have one open line in date 751 W I O D 7519 463 by
the way you were I must say you're not right too often but you were absolutely right about Hank
I mentioned that the other day but you couldn't hurt it because you were tied up with all that stuff
um Hank is a douchebag he really is he's a putts I know he's my best friend and it pains me to say that
what did he know it's no it's just true it's just this this ongoing viciousness this no not what
he's done to me it's what he's attempting to do to you oh yeah well and I think you know fun and
games is great and we can all like you know give and take and do the shots but when it when it's
personal and vicious and when he it's intended to be vicious then it's a different story and I
think Hank ought to really re-examine his entire agenda and govern himself accordingly I don't
comment on Hank anymore but I agree no I didn't expect you I'm just I'm just telling you that you had
an excellent point I think the audience shouldn't be sucked in by a guy who pretends to be this
caustic uh rack on tour or whatever he is nor the nor the interesting enough the sales department
he is going to members of the sales department betting them a hundred dollars I will not be here
a month from today which is always helpful for morale in the sales department and I just keep
running around to everyone he's been with asking if they can kind of double the bet and give me half
so far he hasn't matched my thousand but what can I tell you I told Phil that and never
never once another race had called her to call me and I personally would go over there to take
the number down myself I will climb up onto the scoreboard you know the tote board in the infield I
will personally climb up on there and take the number down myself you know also I was thinking if I
was Mike Disney I would I would say that I would be very angry I would be very angry imagine your
underwear bills if you were if I were Mike Disney I'd be very angry at mr. Gobert running around
betting with the sales department on something like that which might deter them from selling the
show and making money for the state Mike doesn't have time I do understand it your Mike this is with
the FCC and Jack Thompson he's got his own agenda and he's got important things to take care of
over and over and don't bother him with these little unimportant thoughts boy Laura certainly
looks good I think she for she looks like she's going to be springing forth any day.
Throw the one I gave earlier away and this one is better. Boone at science does bring in food
next Friday boy you're just full of it aren't you see how your life is taking an up here and
already that you dumped that you were going with on Wednesday I don't want to talk about Scott

Christine what is this I don't know what is this from their new location at 125 63 bis game bull

samples of the many varieties of pasta salads for those attending the remote so come on down to
specs spend a morning with Neil White there's samples of the great pasta dishes that
post abilities I saw what is this is this spot no is this a what is it looks like all
fear information for you oh okay that's what it sounds like well we want to do it on the year good
for Lauderdale hello okay nice talking to you too probably somebody heard Stan show yesterday
for Lauderdale hello hi Neil hi this is Cheryl you're guiding my fan oh yeah I haven't called
in a while well what a great what's great timing Cheryl why I don't know no reason in particular
oh okay well I just wanted to say that I'm glad that both of you you and bird are both back
from vacations I couldn't take much more of this show is without the two of you there at least
bird by himself is even good I heard Alex was tremendous Disney told me that Alex Bennett was so good
that was frightening I'm betting that I heard a little I thought it was frightening too I just wish
they would have left bird by himself he does a great job I they hate him don't you understand they
hate him with a mom I'm being honest with you there's no point in meeting around a bush they
despise him they don't trust him they think he's untrustworthy he has no judgment no talent that
by himself he absolutely sucks well I'm glad that the two you're back can you say what you just said
on the not the sucks part can you say the other part can you say together on the radio no no it's
being around the bush now we can't say that okay we take that back president's family gets very upset
about that well I'm just glad that all the vacations are over I hope yeah ordinarily when you work
at a real radio station you know vacations come and go and people fill in there no major problem
and life goes on but here it's a gigantic upheaval you know when air vacations for anybody they just
can't quite get their act together and they have all these bureaucratic people running around making
these wild the neurotic decisions and bringing people are just got fired in to see how bad a job
they can do it's it's great I have to give you a compliment of it Neil well going I've been following
you for many how much I loved it like Alex did I've been following you for many many many years since
you were like like Jack would you like some license plate numbers here's wait a minute April first Bob
and Harlan here's that silver fox airway our silver fox pampered pines dfz no that's okay silver
Toyota van I don't even know anybody who drives a Toyota silver van go ahead I have to say that you've
been very very nice about the whole situation with mr. Thompson there I mean this has been going
on for years and you've never really done anything you know you know what really we have been doing a
lot of things behind the scenes we've been spending millions of dollars to try to get this goofball
uh find him a life and do something else but about it that what really set me off was this
Chicago business this page that's got all these notes when we're in Chicago having a good time and
having a few meals and seeing some ball games and just there to have a good weekend and this puts
is out there making phone calls to arrest them confused what was the purpose that was to find out
where we were staying what was the purpose beyond that you'd have to ask him I don't know all I
know is what happened to us the next day I'm very proud that you guys have been just so good on
the air about it and this guy just looks like a total jerk in the paper and you know everything
else that he's done and it's about time you guys get to say stuff about it I mean it's well you're
going to hear a lot about it including our regular daily feature okay so Jack's going to have to stay
real close to home taping will not be sufficient he really deserves anything you guys give him now
I mean you guys have been just so good about all this guys of doing it because he's concerned about
the airwaves and about public these and in the meantime he's in no tracking us down everywhere we go
and snooping around the house and taking our license plate numbers and contriving in his mind conjuring
up all these illicit things that are going on in the house and I went to Vegas with some people so
therefore you see he believes I guess that anybody you meet you have sex with so I guess he must be
living very limited circles because they don't look like he's had too much lately but I get a lot
of people yeah so I hope that's not true but quite frankly I think I guess he figures that's the
only kind of relationships that people engage in oh it's really a shame that the man has nothing
helps in nothing nothing else to do zero it's all I will tell you something you'll find very
amusing and looking through thousands of these pages so far I have found three or four pages that
are not directly related to me or this however they are phone calls made to places where they
sell videotapes see what he does is he records these shows on the audio on vcr and videotape every day
and he's trying to buy videotapes in bulk at a lower price so that's the only other calls I found
that aren't directly related to the erudges only peripherally but I think I might lately I saw
a little of it the other day and I can't I can't handle it Holly was there with Roger in the same
room and Roger's a good guy and I can't deal with him it's getting really bad don't you see we have a
real-life soap opera here but they bring in best that kind of occupies is well you're soap opera is good
but and it's real but it's that's the best car yeah exactly we can turn off guiding light
yeah turn off yours excellent point well thanks again have a great weekend glad you guys are both back
bye 1249 at ww.od let's see what did I do with the spread what did it a busy beaver that day
February 13th 1988 Sheriff Nick Navarro Broward County Sheriff's Department for Lauderdale Florida
Deer Sheriff Navarro on January 28th 1988 Neil Rogers on his daily radio program on WZTAFM at 842am
three times called you a Nazi pig I convey this to you not to you listen any official action
by your department but rather to inform you as an individual of this defamation govern yourself
accordingly best JB Thompson you know the funny part of it is Nick Navarro actually likes me even
though he is a Nazi pig you know so it doesn't make any difference he saw my couple of
minutes yeah he was in here with Steve and we mentioned this individuals named him he said oh I
don't want to repeat what he said yeah we can't we didn't have anything very complimentary to say
nothing that we could repeat on the air let's put it that way who's on that bat line oh the mystery
and a former this ought to be good hello this morning you said Neil Rogers makes way for the
really big talent I just Jeff Barclay Andrew 610 W I O D 13 Neil walked out the show and split
that I served as guest host this morning at 10 Frank I have been waiting for this opportunity
all my life and this hour's show and playing a little music from Jim Baker's New
Andrew's and Beijing things of blues I don't want to give them much of my of course our sports
segment we're gonna have wide cups couldn't get lucky with a sissful of foggy's in a woman's
prison and in a more serious topic we're in a discussion fashion trends the famous little
Sasha and wide double knit and the war never seemed to go out of style standing to believe
radio glory fighting then Joe Zagaggy and what profitable little barrel of McLean
then Neil Rogers show the 2010 on this dark radio 610 W I O D
oh excellent Jeff I have only one thing to say long 50 dollars 12 54 W I D
they're so clever back there net sales department you know what especially Jeff Clark
there is a guy with a said now I was cute for him especially because his sense of humor is
sewn on his sleeve it's amazing they have to sew it on really what I heard he has an iron on
a sense of humor anyway we do have an open line in brow which causes me great pain and consternation
at 524 W I O D but your safe could Steve stepped out momentarily so now they'll start lighting up
Miami hello hello Neil yeah yeah I think there's a torture host is going to take some of the
the heat off of your rear end so to speak Alice Rantell is going to have Jerry Butler
dressed as a motorcycle cop administering a breathalyzer test yeah I have a feeling and of course he
probably can get ringside tickets because he seems to have a lot of good friends over there okay
well we wish it a better luck I covering yourself accordingly take care
12 55 at W I O D is the plot thickens doesn't it well I'm I'm amazed at all these Dennis Collins
a communicator case back and forth and Dennis is this and Dennis said that and Dennis said Tim
Williams said this and Tim Williams said that he was tickled a death that Disney would hire him
and hope that he didn't back out at the last minute etc etc and on and on and on because I was
a bitter pill for them to swallow over there at W I and C's last say to four because they wanted
to be consistent right across the board and to once stand and I left there man they are there
is consistent as the weather in Pahokie aren't they the question about it all station a one five and
a one five and of course those those 25 to 54 is in midday and afternoon drive are shocking aren't
they well that's what they want I mean when even the motivation station beats you then you know
you've got it made well he said he didn't want to be number one I remember boy there's been a good
spread here today we're just having nice cigar 106 at W I O D 11 4 88 there's one more rambling
of a jack that we just have to read on the year today as I find it so interesting you're going to
good flip your week 11 4 88 Dennis Collins uh-huh he sought Tim Williams today and he admitted
they never could sell Roger show right also Williams was hoping Disney would sign Rogers and
was afraid Disney would back out I called to tell Dennis Kane had compounded the defamation
so that's our little tidbit from 11 4 88 three days before we started on the year here's a matter
fact now I remember couldn't sell a show 12 minutes an hour we used to add it up they add and then
they added two more minutes because the show was oversold they had said demand they had a waiting
list to get on the show on Zeta I remember I remember a fit eight months we were sold out you through a
fit at the sales department what time member it's like it was yesterday because they went over 12 minutes
and I remember what you said to them you said to them you can put all the spots you want on there
but after 12 minutes that's all we're going to run you had to throw a fit to get them to hold it to
12 minutes that they were lined up business trying to get on that show but they couldn't sell it
enormous rates top rates but they couldn't sell it now now come Tim wrote that memo that said
that I was responsible for a third of all the billing on both stations that's correct at least they
couldn't sell it where did all that billing come from I used to hear the spots every morning there
were 12 minutes an hour wow maybe this is all just a dream or a fantasy because you can't imagine
that Tim would make up something like that and that Dennis Dennis would repeat it could you believe
that man Dennis seems to be involved in the zongoing day-to-day conversations quite heavily
doesn't it yeah we're finding out that's Dennis Collins a general manager at WNW
once were of our competitors which would be I mean if that were true that would be so embarrassing
to find out that he's by kind of been maybe it's right I mean in fact that Jack wrote it doesn't
make it so we have to give Dennis the benefit of the doubt don't we do we it's eight minutes past
one at WIOD we have an open line in Broward well there's a lot of stuff in here that we've been
waiting for for a long time to be able to piece together and then of course that incredible
Chicago masterpiece with those phone numbers and phone calls and I don't know I don't know about
you but I sure wouldn't want to be involved in snooping around in a situation where four people
nearly got killed in a rented car you know what I'm saying four-lawterdale hello hi Neil hi I
just wanted to find out I've been listening to you I guess since the FM station I guess about a year
you're in a house oh you mean the one where they couldn't sell the show yeah I remember that
not to take an insulting I was just curious how long that you've been a radio talk show host how
long you've been doing this not to take it in insulting well I just was curious if you've been doing
this a long long time how many years I was missing your show oh 17 17 years in Florida
so I've missed your show for quite a while well it's really not much according to some you know
missing much I also wanted to recommend I don't know when your next vacation's coming up but I
just got back from I'll be happy to tell you where I'm going and listen I'll give you the name
of a restaurant close by so you can call in and find out which hotel I'm
okay well I just got back from Lake Tahoe and I would recommend out to anybody it's a great spot
can I tell you a little story sure years ago I was out in California I was I think I was in
Sacramento and I said to myself well yeah I think I'll drive over to Tahoe you know it's not that far
hmm and there's a there's like a fork in the road there and if you go to the right you go into
the city there with all the casinos and if you go straight there's this winding narrow road that
goes all the way around Lake Tahoe okay and it's about 50 miles out of the way oh man it's not always
if 50 miles out of the way but it's this winding thank goodness it was in the summertime and it was
breathtaking view but it's the most dangerous road in the winter they close it all together and
there are these places that you have to actually come to a full stop and make almost a hundred
eight degree turn to keep going back up the mountain you know and and you look down there no
guard rails or anything and you look down and there there's the lake and all these rapids and it's
breathtaking view but it's a it's a nightmare of a ride you know but did you enjoy the trip no it's
great I came back and I thought it was just one of the greatest spots in the world yeah it's beautiful
wasn't sure if you'd been there or not and I figured I'd recommend it to you yeah I'd recommend it to
anybody it's it really is beautiful well that's all I wanted to let you know I enjoy your show and
hope to listen for the next 17 years okay thanks a lot thanks boy 11 after one at WIOD we have an
open line in broad I'm not going to give the boken palm beach line there's nobody calls on those
anyway I'm tired of exerting and the reexerting and just wasting a lot of needless energy on that
those people are not a part of the show they're not a part of the state they're not a part of the
planet they're just they're just like vegetating I think it's probably appropriate that we have
someone on both the line who's called veggie and they because they're just kind of in a vegetative state
Florida in Broward though there is one open line if you move very very fast because the line is
forming all the way to the rascal house 524 WIOD if you want to be a part of this big one to 2 hour
even if you have absolutely nothing to say what makes you any different from the restaurant here's
a mobile and brown or hello a meal how are you great I'm just on the first time caller I've only
been listening to show about three months now virgin caller well maybe we can get you together
with a reverend virgin wait can you say virgin on the air though no I didn't think so but what I'd
like say is I've you know I didn't know anything about the story is going on and everything I've
been hearing you say about this guy Jack Thompson is he supposedly a Christian or something oh yes
very much so born again Christian and you know they don't hate the center but they hate the
sin you heard that line well well what I was going to say Neil is that I'm a Christian and I
listen to your radio and you know I don't agree with but some things you say and some things I
really like what you say but for a man who claims to be a Christian and calling himself calling
self that to harass you and to do something like that it's a very Christian like well if you could
read these letters in the language in the tone and the threats of these letters in the lies and
the twisted distortions of what I say on the air certainly nobody who was really a Christian could
possibly you know do these things but then again they're throughout history people have
masked themselves behind alleged religion you know even Tarky modest said he was a Christian
right and Hitler at his SS had you know God is on our side on their belt buckles and thought that
they were Christians too so just calling yourself something doesn't make it so that's right you
know I just want to let you know just because you know what he says he's doing it isn't really
you know backing up is supposedly a lifestyle that really that's what it is you know I just want
to let you know that you know I really enjoy your show and like you said if you don't like something
that you say you can always turn the dial exactly and but I really appreciate you know you guys not
slamming him that that shows more character and morals on your part than I think it does on his part
well we certainly are looking to twist or manipulate any of the things that he said or to try to
see imply crimes where there aren't any or have any investigations all we want is to go ahead
and live our lives and do our thing and have him find a new hobby you know right okay have a great
week you two deal by 113 at W.I.O.D. and open line in date now if you move real fast okay this is
the psychology that we have to go back to 5249463 524 W.I.O.D. where we just hung up only moments ago
and we want to tell you about you know W.I.O.D. you know he wants to settle with me does he really
yeah anyway oh look at this this is a call from Tallahassee hello
joe nil oh this is that guy with a crank voice again yeah Tallahassee next place get a life
with it they're going with a funny voice again it's one of those mouth readers who must be getting ready
for your show we have an open line in Boka and in Tallahassee but I said I'm not giving those numbers
I'm not I started getting a weakness again there Miami hello yeah yeah hi hi I've got a friend

traumatic day for us because it's the last day we're going to be working with nika I understand
during these hours he's very broken up about it as a matter of fact during this break I'm going to
look through and find that note about jack's conversation with Nick before I came on the air

Greg Budele call today no it was i mean it was the most shocking event of the entire day even
more shocking than that memo about the Chicago restaurant in the hotels and the bird was just
he's usually unflappable if you pardon that expression but he was just falling apart at the seams
it wasn't believe it it was stunning Keith Allen was quacking in the background they all want to
kiss and make up they just uh well something's going on they're gravitating toward this show like
they did in the old days you know they all want to hang on and be part of the show and Greg's wife
he just got married his wife's having a baby in a couple months it's great no that's what he
said i'm not making that up he's very much in the family way uh-huh which is interesting because

hello i've listened to you for a long time first time i've called you and you would be amazed how
many people in law enforcement listen to this show they love this show sure let me ask for the
upset about that but they all of this show i think it's something about police officers and the
most people don't know they have got to have a unique personality and a unique sense of humor or
they don't last very long yeah i would think so first with all the fun and so are we with all the
slime balls you have to deal with every day i would believe that just like we do on this show

accordingly now all right party yeah well i guess i have my marching orders huh

to hollywood hello yeah hey deal yeah yeah this stuff about ripping the bird i gotta tell you when
you did that uh that live thing down at Toyota hollywood the live oh the appearance yeah yeah well
i gotta watch what i say anyway live thing don't say live thing well i'm sorry that could really
be twisted around by those who have very overactive hormones those who have dead things possibly
anyway you know the bird was okay i went down there i picked up a picture he grabbed it out of my
hand signed it i didn't even want a signature yeah but he was just kidding bird
getting up that i got you think of it of course i didn't ignore anybody i know he was terrific
yeah he was great that's what the crowd said too is they were trying to lynch him on the way out i know
but i got a question for you seriously um but the problems you have it okay let's say
it happened to a judge that would be ended real quickly hey i got news for you if any judge in this
town was getting the harassment that i'm beginning for two years and having people snoop around their
houses and write down license plate numbers and make a general nuisance of themselves and calling
all over the country to find out where they were staying on vacations uh you know as well as i do
boy they would did the stiff arm of the law would come down so fast that our friend wouldn't know
what hit him that's right that's the point i'm trying to make well you know most of these joe i'm
sorry you know my attorney friends they seem to think that some of these judges are really hot
child and some of them are okay but there are some in this town man i wouldn't give you a 15
cents for them they're just a bunch of pseudo intellectual douchebags and they look at everything
like it's some kind of intellectual exercise as opposed to a day in and day out life you know when
you got somebody that's devoting their entire existence to ruining your life and i'm not exaggerating
uh then you really got a real story going on you know i'll tell you this and and you know it and
and for the yo yo that's listening i know hundreds of people and i've turned on literally
dozens to your show over the years when you were straight talking also when you went to the
stick type talk and they all love it straight talk straight straight straight straight talk
can't say that no that'll really confuse jack but i've been listening to you for probably eight
nine years and i don't know any i i got a change that i know one person that complained about it out
of hundreds that i know yeah and i bet you they turned it off but you had a matter of fact he did
yeah he turned it off isn't that a revolutionary idea but you know a lot of people out here that
really enjoy your show and i'm not trying to you know suck up to you in any any way i mean it
legitimately because it's it's kind of tiring when you get good stuff on the air good entertainment
stuff that people enjoy and you get some meatball in the name of whatever he's doing it in yeah that
wants to wants to knock it off and ruin it for everybody else he's got a finger you know he could
use it to turn the dial over whatever he wants to do with it but he doesn't have to pull this kind
of garbage and there's a lot of people that are pretty hot about it you know there's another
interesting thing and looking through all his ramblings here in the dates on them he very clearly
lied in front of one of our judges here in date county a few months ago when we had a hearing because
he kept emphasizing over and over again that didn't want to get me off the air didn't want to
deprive me of alive there because he knows that's a separate actionable thing and then all he
wanted to do is clean up the act and yet in this series of thousands of letters and notes and so
on it just repeated over and over again must be gotten off the air shouldn't be on the year he
recently wrote a letter to senator in a way up in Washington about how I shouldn't be behind
a microphone and no business being on here so on the one hand he will say for public consumption
that he's just trying to clean up the air waves and on the other hand he's trying to attempt to
deprive me of a livelihood even if I sit here reading nursery rhymes he still wants me off the
air well I'll tell you something if I had somebody haunting my life for two years like you do I don't
know how you uh it ain't easy okay it ain't easy I think I would have fallen apart and done
something else myself well but I wish you a lot of luck and I know an awful lot of thousands of
people do and we hope you stay on the air forever I'm not going anywhere believe me and you and the
bird got a terrific show okay thanks a lot okay 141 at W outing now it says hotline fandom call
enough this is that same guy again because you know Nick it says last day with the show he hates
the show to begin with and if this fandom caller is that same guy again uh-huh and they of course
would have the hotline and I'll take the last 20 minutes of the show and I'll go through every page
you to here just to find that memo about Nick's conversation with Jack okay hello Neil Rogers makes
way for the really big talent hi this Jeff Flaude sales manager 610 W I O D 30 Neil walk out the show
and it's the same thing we it was okay once they're so upstairs yeah they're so obsessed but it was
funny the first time but not for an encore okay I mean it was mildly amusing the first time but
let's get serious kick an ax with 50,000 collards ladies and gentlemen this is the lightning row
on the Neil Rogers show
W I and Z is there such a station still is they on the air I sure I said I know they couldn't
sell my show over there you know I can understand
him Williams and Dennis Collins having a lot of conversations together because boy you know what they
say about birds of a feather isn't there some expression about that birds of a feather their numbers
sucked together or something like that which reminds me there's a trend coming out on Monday uh-oh
I'm not too concerned about this one but I think that when the summer book comes out that Alex
Tony Bennett I keep thinking that week that's going to be in there wow and I always remember the
two weeks I did in July they were like I said I know they were well you don't know that now you
don't know that because it's four weeks now the two other weeks that I was you're gonna
rephrase it let me rephrase it let me rephrase it let me rephrase it the two weeks that I was
here out of those four could have been an eight and two weeks that I wasn't here but listen could
have been a four and that average is out to a six great I'm not saying it was or they will know very
well could nobody know but now while you can find out you can go into the week by way we can dig that
out for if you're that can we go into the day but I'm not if you're that positive that you were
holding your end of the bargain there's no problem go into the research and I'm sure that
over you out in fact when I was here they probably went down quite a bit I'm just saying it stayed
through July that's all I meant I'm real happy about that I'm real pleased that the numbers
stayed through the whole entire month well management doesn't feel the same way okay let's go to
Miami hello that I post this question has Susan Martin and Jack Thompson ever been seen together
well that is an excellent question and we're gonna go out and check license plates this weekend and
find out if perhaps so we're not dealing with just one person uh bokeh hello what
uh-huh I don't see how you got from one to the other I mentioned a few trivial baseball names
and when trivia comes to mind I came to the elementally pop not to yours no I thought he was the
trivia can you what's wrong with me yeah what is wrong well this caller wants to ask the same thing
hello hi do you want to ask about what's wrong with him I don't know who this guy is it's laughing
at everything he said there you go that's so disconcerting well how do you think I feel
trouble I would say I said that Joe Collins died a week ago he starts laughing he laughs at everything
well we know you ma'am I think you are too you know you're so childy so are you
for hanging up on you for hanging up and not speaking to me very childish no she just don't want
to talk to you she doesn't oh here's that Steve letter I'm gonna have to show that to him again when
he comes back in February 13th 88 I wonder what was going on that day because boy talk about
ran we got to look and see what day of the week that one wow the grandlaters were just pouring
out of that house unbelievable Miami hello hello Neil welcome back back
