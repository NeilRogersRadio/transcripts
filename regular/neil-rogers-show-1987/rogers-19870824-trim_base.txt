Just can't exercise their individual liberties by turning the dial.
They have a problem with they've got a serious problem. One of them of course being John B. Thompson,
attorney who likes to call himself Jack. Jack of all trades. Jack down. Don't say it. I'm not,
but I'm thinking I can think of Jack B nimble Jack B quick. Oh boy. We've got a lot of great lines for Jack.
And of course when somebody sends me a copy as I received this morning of a long and this guy's an attorney.
Oh boy. How'd you like to be on trial for your life? And all of a sudden this guy in the middle of the courtroom
would start doing a pirouette in front of the judge and get his crayons out. I mean look at the attached
personal note that I've got. It looks like a little kid got Crayola's out or something. The monitor is out there.
Obviously a very busy attorney. No question about it. He's obviously got very busy
practice and a very successful one. But getting back to yesterday. Of course if you're just if you've
been out of town or if you've been listening to what would they have been listening to? Bill McQuig.
Out of town. No, if they've been listening to Bill McQuig they know about it because he oh that's
a whole couple of hours. With Dr. Hoofenmouth. A lot of people in your, a lot of people are in vacation
this time. Exactly. And if you're just coming in this morning and wondering what it is that we're
talking about well we seem to have a little problem here. Just a little problem. And of course when
you work in this market or in this business I guess but in this market especially they're always
little problems. I'm not just in this market they're having a little problem up at the Jacksonville
at WAPE. Oh yeah. Those Yahoo's up in Duval County. Yeah. And the county up there wants to
monitor. Maybe they ought to get this authority to move up to Jacksonville. The blessing for everybody.
Boy that's it's true. They want to monitor what's on the airwaves of their community as if all
of a sudden it reminds me of Joe Carrillo and his foreign policy in Dade County where the city
commit not even a county commission but the Miami City Commission has its own foreign policy.
And would love to subvert the foreign policy of the United States. Of course in some cases that
might not be all bad but in his case who knows. And so now there are those people individuals who
all taken upon themselves to be the censors for the rest of mankind because they want to protect
America and especially our youth from the perversion and the smarmy stuff that they're being exposed
to every day. And may God bless them in all of their efforts right. I love that that's the last line
in this letter to Bob Gilbertson which we all received copies of even the janitorial service got
a copy of this. May God bless you for your efforts. Best John B. Thompson. What a guy. This is
exciting. So we got a new one. We've got Dr. Hoop and Mouth and we have a Jack Thompson who
sounds like I have a feeling they know each other. You know I have this feeling yeah that they're
made back somebody they might play golf together. Oh yeah. Yeah. Very positive. Some of those
snooty clubs you know that kind of stuff. I could be wrong you know again that's just a guess.
You mean some of those clubs were like well I don't want to say that if you want to say that
that's up to you but well I was just asking you I would watch myself very carefully because you are
being monitored. Well I also because you are part of the problem you do understand that don't you
even though we pulled our audience here what day was it Wednesday or Thursday of last week
we pulled the audience and you know you didn't do all that well I survived while you survived
skin of my teeth but you must remember if we pulled the audience probably I wouldn't do much
better because there are a lot of people out there in fact I'll give you a perfect example now a
lot of you are ringing the phones which we don't want yet okay we'll let you know when we're ready
we got a lot of heavy stuff to do here okay all the lines are clear now all those people who would
like to have the news back on W.I. I remember those good old days or and it's almost a year ago now
see in the first few months that was amusing it's almost a year later all the people who would like
the news back just ring up those numbers 6249400 they all write 490400 and brown it now they're not
all there's still a couple of them there that are can't believe it yeah see if that this would have
been back in February or March immediately oh yeah they would have all lit up so quick because Sunny
Rosenberg's whole family would have been on there right away now they're still not all it is only
five people they've had just they've got there they go but that took a long time yeah they are
standards that was a very slow response no that's true if we had taken a poll on you it probably
would have been similar if maybe not even worse could have been worse absolutely could have been
much worse maybe you can just sit here and cackle every day for four hours all by yourself no
thing with no inspiration that's okay I'll pass well judging from what's on the back of the chair
looks like you already did oh I don't think we should have said that jack is up says monitoring
about that excretory activity just wrote something I say anything about excretory activity just
wrote a little egg now when a bird lays an egg is that that's not excretory activity that
it is no it's not it's reproductive activity and he doesn't understand reproductive how is that
also something we can't talk about I think so and are you cereal well judging by that letter oh
yeah no we can't talk about anything anything in fact maybe we ought to call up jack and find out
what we can talk about we can bless the Pope I guess and we can talk about the sins of homosexuality
I guess if we talk about young ladies with big breasts that would be good I got an idea what we'll
do is stand and I will swap our topics and from time to time I'll talk about who I don't even
know who it is that he talks about what's the one on Miami vice the only hundredth and the
other Santiago boy I've heard about her until I'm green in the face nice girl great let's talk
about her all day and about how the size of her breasts and all of that stuff and then I shouldn't
say stand will completely switch because I have a feeling some of the things he said about you know
who and I will not mention Don Johnson's name thank god certainly come under the heading of whatever
it says in this letter it was all it don't know are you sure of that well now that you mentioned it
so I don't think you're going to be hearing lesbian dilatate on this show anytime soon
now we are going to be doing the show remote from club 21 tomorrow well you never know who we
might run into there and if anybody took that picture now there it is still there I think that
when you know who comes into town tomorrow we'll greet him with this that might change with this
picture Bob Gilbertson baby we could give him a private screen your power to it is he coming in early
I thought he was scheduled for Wednesday tomorrow oh boy Tuesday boy it's been pushed up today oh boy
exciting don't you wish you could just kind of spin the clock ahead and it was tomorrow already
no that's all right see we've been going along here doing just great come wait and we've got
everybody in town listening and that's the problem there are too many people listening to this show
and they can't handle that they would much prefer for nobody to be listening to like it used to be
in those glory days back to be a really we have this hella type or did they pull that out they
don't even use it anymore do they don't even use it even on the news they don't use the
hella type anymore I miss it too yeah that's I was thinking we could just put it on for four hours
today that way the alarms won't go off there'll be something on the air yeah now I will not be here
Friday Friday of course at the beginning of my vacation does anybody made any provisions for that
see we're just living dangerously I guess is a good way to put it wouldn't that be a good way
to describe it on the edge right on the edge on the edge of the envelope I suppose I'll be here
Friday well it's gonna happen don't forget now your target maybe we don't need that cackling idiot
in the background well then Bob goberson will do the show now we don't need old Jimmy in there either
with his ridiculous tapes he's brought us in a lot of this smarmy material like that
Brenda Lee tape shame on you very sexual young lady well she must have been once upon a time
yeah the 50s yeah she dated a lot of jockeys I guess and I guess I should mention speaking of
jockeys that I did give our job a gold as the winner in the traverse on this program right and
anybody who had a brain should have seen that the track sloppy it was a muddy track all you had to
do is take the three horses with the mud marks crypto clearance Java gold and Polish Navy
and box him and the perfect it was uh hundred and some dollars it called her hundred and nine
bucks I think and the trifecta was six hundred and ninety dollars didn't I give them the winner
did you have a good day well I had I didn't have a gigantic day but over the weekend on balance I
want a couple a couple of hot dogs basically a few a few dollars not a lot that's that's
at least it's in the right direction exactly now there's is this a coincidence that Kyle is on
vacation this week or did he pick this week specifically well I think he's probably
prescient and I think he probably knew ahead of time that this was going to be a very volatile
week in all of our lives a week to be out of the bill he's already you know just answering the
phones he deals with enough pressure and enough trauma every day that he doesn't need to be here
do you know be in the middle of it but I will say you're right here in the middle of it today
and you're to be highly commended for that that's quite a turnaround from friday and saturday
when you were flying around in the control and of course saturday you were can
be speckuously by your absence I was interesting there were several people who called on saturday
see ordinarily they called get them off get them out of there
saturday when they felt that you were needed here for immoral support you were very conspicuous
by your absence you survived well that you notice how he changes the subject I survived period I
survived many years before you were back in here trust me I don't work on saturday oh really
sometimes that's very good to me that sounds I like if I say that enough will it be true I don't know
of course if it up to jack I guess I won't work on Wednesday or Thursday or Monday or Tuesday
or friday then what would he listen to that's my question what would he monitor what would he do
all day maybe he'd monitor Mike spindle because if anybody we know needs monitoring now I should start by
saying that I thank Mike and Ira for all of their nice comments yesterday about how were you united
front here good at wion z great and of course I'm sure that all of these people are prepared to walk
the plank right right behind me of course me first and after I go off the deep end and they look down
there into the chilly waters murky the murky waters of biscayne bay wouldn't it be great we could do
it right behind one herald plaza oh get on the front page of it of course perfect they don't have to go
far they're keeping would cover that personally okay they're keeping him himself would cover that
personally and I could look behind me and there would be Mike and Ira and Stan and just all kinds of
people Kyle the bird and as they look down into the murky waters of biscayne bay and saw the
let daffy would be there of course of course all those last bubbles bubbling up from biscayne bay
they would each begin to leap right slowly cautiously taking one step forward and three steps backward
with jack poms and be there oh he would certainly be there with bell sound with bell sound
I think he has bells on period all the time bells on his nose and rings on his toes
I'm monitoring you with my crayon snail I'm monitoring here in the gables
unbelievable busy man where do these people come from that's a great question exactly because one
thing I've been here almost a dozen years seems like only 20 or 30 and I've been in this town for a
long time and as each few months go by it's the same with the colors like all of a sudden we'll crop
up a whole new core of regular colors just after you got rid of sam and Harvey from a candle and
Marcy and all the old chronic regulars all of a sudden crop up a new bunch oh hi I'm the
Elton in the John lady I call you six times this week right thanks but you know we'll talk to you
next week this time it's true a constant battle it's true defend off the chronic posthgood
neoxas they say in the Vatican and of course if you haven't received we can send about all of them
out we've sent about close to a thousand of those out already haven't been in three days holy
tally Toledo yeah and if you haven't received your I love John Paul Georgian Ringo bumper sticker
yet well good luck to you we'll we'll send them out as long as they last as long as they last
as long as we last to send us a code that could be that could be a very good pool to take up in the
office you know which will run out first the Roger show or the bumper stickers I don't know which
one I would bet on after the hit come out like I said that loyal support you're right all those
people standing on the plank wimping out at the very last minute waving goodbye as they see you
hit the water we'll miss them yeah turning around walking solemnly the other way toward Denny's
on this game in 30 exactly exactly for a to say cottage I guess to get a minion together and
to say cottage that's right great well thanks a lot 22 past 10 at w i n z we've I did hear briefly
this morning your favorite f m morning show oh at the home of your former employers they love me
and they played that tape and they taped it off the air that's not somebody who sounds like me
that is me it I toys and exactly it is me they taped it off the air and they have replayed it
which is illegal they're still playing it it's illegal cease and desist butle
and those that is yeah I knew it sounded exactly like you precisely shame on them taking a page out
of the ocean and what's that other station the Haitian station a v s waves yeah by people's material
broad without getting their permission illegal replaying it on the air good shame dude the same shame on you
shame on you can't do that don't okay 23 past 10 let's take our first break and see if everything
still working up there we'll come right back since that's just what you get and more now when
you book a pan am holiday vacation to Rio for just the price of an airline ticket for just $660
you can enjoy a week's day at a first-class hotel free and get extras like daily Brazilian breakfast
like all pan am holiday vacations you'll find things like gratuities service charges and other fees
all taken care of simply book your vacation and go before November 12th some restrictions may apply
prices per person based on double occupancy so come to Rio for a week with pan am holiday vacations
and stay at a first-class hotel free now what could be better than that for reservations and
information call your travel agent or pan am holiday vacations at 1 800 the tour and find out
why you can expect more from pan am holiday vacations
but we hit a lot of traffic and got stuck in a two-hour delay
so we pulled out our pistols and we dealt with the traffic in new way
reuse our guns guns guns when we're driving down the streets of the lane
we're driving down the streets of the lane
when I drive around I go out shooting people's in
I come back late at night with my fingers all splattered red
and I'm just like in the most
it's not in a mouth driving on the road
I want to shoot a Honda blast to bat off of the road
with my handgun shoot shoot a Honda shoot shoot a Honda
shoot a Honda yes blast it off of the road
yes
if everybody had a man
all across the lane
it all be pulling their guns out on the old freeway
it's be firing a few weeks
horse and champ the lanes
everybody's going crazy driving it at a lane
I always told you that Brian Wilson was a genius but a little bit unstable
a little unstable just a little yeah just a little bit yeah making a joke
how does something like that shame on him you can listen I had a hand for a hand
by our 45 minutes and and that's what goes now they're all out there aren't they
nothing busy man actually we could kill from now to two o'clock just listing the
people that we know are listening I know you would James Hummel be one of the
first ones or number two he immediately comes to my mind yeah no question in my
mind there's absolutely nothing on the air except this guy is a church that lady is
a whatever yeah don't say it whatever that's a good way to put it yeah I think from now on
when we get some some idiot on the phone instead of calling him a douchebag we'll just say you're
whatever and then the audience we got a very imaginative audience they can fill into blankly
on minds of course now what do we do first do we do this I guess we do Mike Spindell first
because I know Mike is listening he's another one on the list of certain listens can't miss
another busy man well he's on a public door what do you expect he's working for the counties
up there in brown supposedly out there inspecting all the restaurants and in the meantime what is he
doing he's monitoring this show but I do think Mike and I refer all their support yeah however
I didn't hear all I heard was a little bit going to the track yesterday yeah but I have heard
an ugly rumor that couldn't possibly be true and I'm sure that Mike will call in immediately
to straighten this out that he has suggested that there be a rally next Sunday at this station
the protest against this radio station yeah I heard that too now I think that when let's see two
weeks from last Friday when next payday comes around again perhaps he ought to look at the signature
on that paycheck which is the signature of our general manager you follow what I'm saying I
will have to spell it out I follow in other words we don't have any problem with our management
that's true management is completely supportive that's right local management and we're hoping
you know of course they're on work release so we don't know from one day to the next but seriously
what is that Tony Lynchburg what does that mean is on the phone Tony from Lynchburg
that must be about oh yeah well we've got to have a wonderful life tell him good
like to him but not not today no way Jose where do you know there was a horse had called yesterday
called no way Jose I swear to you I hope you bail out of it last week now I didn't bet on him and he's
still running no I hit the perfect in that race and he was not in there no way no way Jose I mean
that tells you right up front forget it with Marlin Suki Marlin Marlin I'll be talking very
relatable Saturday we were out there and there were these two old guys sitting behind us it was
hysterical and the one guy says to the other he looks and Marlin Suki was the jockey on one race his
name is M-A-R-L-E-N-D and the guy says oh yeah there's that Marlin Suki she's a good rider
see I ought to be able to win a lot because most of the people out there haven't got any idea what's
going on you know they don't know a horse they don't know the lead pony from the three horse I know
but it doesn't do me any good see they thought they were going to doff and stadium and they got
you know they just sidetracked yeah and they're waiting for the first quarter to start
yeah a little confused okay now I want you to know that when John L. Way comes out on that field we
don't want any of you people uh looking at him too closely you don't want no that gets back to
of this which I'll get to in a minute we don't want to encourage any of that sexual stuff that's
right just look at his mouth he's got a lot of teeth if you can see through his helmet and you see
all those teeth always got like 64 teeth which most people have 32 and that's good because if
you ever get any knocked out you know football's a violent game if you ever lose any I think like
all hockey players ought to be born with 64 teeth good idea I never thought I never see a hockey
player with all his teeth do you know never except Jason although maybe Steve is in any place for the
red wicks and Jason the guy from the right at 13th I think he's got his teeth that's it no one else
no one else and maybe who's that guy who plays for the islanders
gee I can't even think of his name now goes to show you that I'm not a very good shape
patloff on tape I know has all of his teeth I'll be dying I've looked very carefully
and uh which gets to that letter but we'll get to that in a minute because this rally that might
now has he called in yet is we heard from spindle of course not it's busy no he's not busy
he's probably it hurt at this point because we're attacking him again and after all the nice things
I said about him Friday we like Mike we love him he's great he's a great guy he just he's got a problem
it's a four letter words called life he's got a little problem and his intentions are always good
but it never quite comes out the way that he intends you know it's like very well put it got the
mightest touch in reverse right like with the meds the meds won yesterday though didn't they
I think the meds won but the cardinals won too so it's a long hot summer break poor Mike yeah so we're
still waiting for your call Mike in the show will not continue he should call in the bat line
until you reconsider yeah he should call in in the bat line yeah call us collect sure we don't want
for spindles calls no every time he wants to back out of a bad thing although of course we
shouldn't be so hasty because all depending upon the events of the next 24 to 48 hours we may have
a massive rally out here that's true we could have pickup trucks from Davy and Haitians and right
Jack Thompson and the doctor Heffernin and all these people might be out here along with 20 or
30 thousand others we have no idea what this week is going to bring no we really don't not a clue
well there's some other people who don't have any idea what this week is going to bring but I have
a clue but we won't get into that good but well listen you always have to keep your options in life
open you know what I'm saying that's right you can't just let them put you out there and lemon
saw it off and drop into the grand canyon never to be heard from again no it's not going to happen
not going to happen unlikely so anyway getting back to probably one of the hot topics on the entire
program well by the way here's that well I'm going to do this first and get it in before we finally
exceed to Jack's wishes good because this is the picture of the bag boy from publics and I don't
think we had time to get into this he's also with two young ladies see we like to keep it I mean it
looks good doesn't it it's not what you what it appears to be evidently from the letter but he's
with two attractive young ladies that work with them and they're obviously out there at the beach
either that or bis can bay on a choppy day
it's as I understand that you frequent public supermarkets in search of good looking bag boys often
with a guy named Stan in tow hopelessly searching for women in the canned fruit section
I am a bag boy for publics do not have an earring although I do wear an apron with a floral print
I will be 20 years old in October and I've been hoping for months to see you
waddle into my store waddle how do you like that waddle into the store what a good sense of humor
this exactly I have even alerted the teenage checkout girls to watch for a gruffy middle aged man
buying twinkies entomins and moon pies in large quantity I have also told them that should they
encounter such an animal they should button their uniforms up past their breasts and alert the
manager he is to see that the transaction is completed without a pass and the gentleman be quickly
escorted to his car and then he tells me which one he works in date county wind publics we love the bird
wow and think that since you've made it to the big time with an iron share that mr. hila
should do your trolling for you we believe Glen Hill has excellent taste because anybody who likes
Phoebe Kate's and thoughts stand by me was a four star movie has latent as in homosexual written
across his feathers and it goes on a great length I'm not going to read the entire thing but to good
letter it says if I don't hear from you or see you in a few months I'll have no choice but to try
to gain employment at windixi after all they are the beef people and I'm not going to read the next
line because that would be that would be wrong as Richard Nixon once said that would be wrong right
look what happened to him yeah really and look at how much money we're paying to protect our
former president he's writing books and making all kinds of money yeah calling Ronnie every day
you hear them knocking again on the building people on the roof it's probably the group from Portland
they're knocking on the outside of the building trying to get in we won't let them in the front
door and they're trying to come in through the escape hatch in the roof but anyway getting back to
probably the number one subject today it is the courts business this is jack of course of course
do you hear that they get in the courts business when one of your employees encourages homosexuality
and uses federally proscribed profanity on the public public airwaves
well a profanity part we do not use profanity on the show and we know uh you know we know what the
FCC rules are in spite of what but the other part I think is something we need to come to grips with
promoting homosexuality uh I think I promote heterosexuality well there's the verdict is still out on that
from the last letter obviously there are those who still have that disagree are we allowed to do that
anymore anybody who has a limp wing can't you know are we allowed to promote heterosexuality on this
that's what I'm pointing out now this is all got to stop and don't you understand if we could
discourage all of this there wouldn't be any reproductive activity we'd have to stop talking about
because there would be no reproduction no more sex that's our new campaign even if you're married
no we don't want to hear about no no more sex no it's not that we don't want to hear about it we
want them to cut it out because this is really where the right wingers are coming from you do
understand that don't you absolutely well what I'm not mentioning any names some of these people do
have penis envy oh I know that's obvious no question about it obvious and as a result see basically
it comes down to everything tasting movies and books and radio shows if they can't have it they
don't want anybody else to have it I know if they don't enjoy it they don't want anybody else to
enjoy it whatever it is right fill in the blank I know as in whatever what's his name Jimmy Hummel
said before yeah what did he say you don't even remember the line this one's a jerk that one's a
whatever whatever exactly very good classic line reading yourself I remember because I had
forgotten it quite frankly myself and we certainly don't want any more of these perverted sex acts
being committed by anybody in our audience of any age or anything married nothing correct just
cut it out yeah stop it now we do understand that the W I and Z is going to provide tomorrow one of
our I don't want to mention his name but is bringing thousands of chastity belts from Portland Maine
seriously with floral print oh I was going to ask what we tell our old print so if you work
at Windixi you don't have to figure out or publics so by the way what was this bag boys name again
Chris another Chris is not incredible unbelievable other Christopher well that's going to make Linda
happy she'll like that who remember Linda who was our guest one day loves Christopher I thought you
said Glenda did I say Glenda I said that's gonna make Glenda happy now he's calling himself Glenn I am
do you have something you want to announce to us before we put the ban that would jack listening
encouraging homosexuals so I guess no more lesbian dilated in the Howard Stern show right no more
of that and no more calls from what's his name from the monsters grandpa yeah no more of that jack
would be real happy if you lived in New York you know I hit me having a great so what Howard yeah boy
Howard would love this guy but this isn't New York this is more like Coral Gables and Perine
Moral Gables Davy yeah Moral Gables that what are some of the other real repressive Miami shores
right kind of oh yeah Miami shores they have laws against every kind of thing you've ever even
governing your toilets yeah yeah you're right I got stopped by police and Miami shores one time
for sitting in my car but sitting in my car waiting on an appointment but what were you doing in
your car nothing questioning to the radio you know and the cops stop me and check me out I was I was
you know yeah well I was like five minutes early for an appointment so I was just you see a
bird go through a strip search it's incredible it's great they go over every feather it's
unbelievable a lot of fun a lot of fun I enjoyed it the Miami shores Lice Patrol will be right
but that they get very nervous if they see anyone there it's like Moral Gables exactly I got
stopped by the cops and Moral Gables one morning and Pompano that's another one the home of Dr.
Huffinmouth Pompano's a man very repressive Pompano's very repress hopeless yeah I live there one time
did you yeah I lived there for about a year that was the beginning of all our problems up there exactly
in the late 70 anyway there are a lot of rumors so anyway you don't have to worry Jack no more
sex head or a sexual there is no more sex far be it from us to talk about it or promote it because
you know you can't promote something that doesn't exist so that's done now right exactly it's over
the power of this show nobody in this audience is even thinking about ever doing it again now
that's over that's done exactly when we hold up our Jeff Stryker picture meaningless meaningless
so Jack it's it's fixed it is I'm looking at that it does nothing for nothing at all now well
maybe a little well you know Rome wasn't built in a day and I'm sure that wasn't either but that's
another story we're working on it in other words it looks like he's working on it but that's no don't
say that now don't say those kind of thing don't say those kind of things because that's what gets
them all bent out of shape oh I don't think you can say that either see it really boils down if
you're the ones who are listening who get upset they're the ones with a sick mind because no
matter what you say they can take it and turn it into something they can make something out of
nothing that's right like Stan he does it every day for four hours only kidding Stan I'll
Stan's probably still asleep so hopefully now he's all over all of that business everything's fine
right I told you that he got over yeah it only you know Stan gets over being angry quick it only
takes about a week three days you don't believe me but I told you I've seen a man before it takes
him three days and he's okay to the issue here is not one nealist provocateur
yeah rather the issue is whether this community has the right to seek protection in its courts
from those who would abuse a federal license to corrupt our youth and the base public discourse
that what we're doing the basing public intercut discourse
I'll be darn I didn't know we were doing that yeah well in his opinion well he didn't say that
well no it's because it's a matter of fact when he speaks yeah trust me that's the law
when the judge speaks if you see that show on channel four the judge now I mean if you like the
people's court you'll love the judge I don't like that crap oh boy I mean it makes the people's court
look like gone with the wind I mean that's how good this show is you know the judges and they show
the judge leaving his house every day and kissing his wife in a very provocative way by the way
that's got to stop that's got to stop now I wouldn't even be surprised if that dirty old man is
every now and then try something too oh no and all of the people who come to his court just about all
of them are there for that reason and if we can ban that that show will go off not slanding will go off
Dallas will go off the Carson show will go off oh David Letterman be the first to be off first
ago yeah I'm glad he's never how it's turned will be off boy if Jack ever saw Letterman you would
have any Murphy will never be seen again his he fit yeah buddy hack it back to the deli for buddy
in the Catskills never see him again the only thing he can is allowed to do is eat that's why
his cheeks by the way we've ever noticed that he's always got food oh yeah but no one have
puffy cheeks at all what you're talking about these shows are only going to be banned in
Carl Gables no in America oh really it's the American way federal federally federally proscribed
material and it couldn't come at a better time because under Ronald Reagan of course everything is
proscribe as opposed to circumscribed so that's where we are today ladies and gentlemen and if any
of this made any sense to you well good luck to you because I'm just in a quandary I haven't got
any idea I know what scream or eat a banana I really don't I didn't get any of it now let me
ask you something that first break that we took seemed incredibly short because we're only doing
one more am I wrong was there something scratched out here that I don't know about okay here comes
a message boys picking up just like Kyle the log oh well so it's Monday what's new about that
heads Monday yeah the doctor's favorite day yeah well in fact I still think that Monday and Tuesday
I should be allowed to stay home boy wait till stan comes I know a hissy fit I know I saw
look at that holy Toledo holy peoria oh my god I hope he's got a lot of material prepared for today
oh I'm sure he does these Mondays boy they're killers he can handle it okay let's take another
break and we might even take a few calls today oh no well I wouldn't get carried away you wonder
what one over do it John is here to see Glenn you have his tickets no which John I'll go talk to
him now they they're picking him up today well which John is this I'll go see the tickets be here
later today and I still don't know where I'm going to go now this is a little bit unfair
because my vacation starts Friday yeah I know and I don't know where I'm going to go because I
don't know what to do with my life at this point because every minute you know I know it could be the
last I know every second could be the last word that I utter on this show I know I don't think you
can say utter now that couldn't be John Thompson that's here to see me could it no unlikely no it would
just say Jack oh yeah I'm not going up there if it's John if it's it's Tom Thompson or whatever's
name it maybe it's Mike Thompson I heard him on the air coming in the morning they sort of have the
same front of a rule rule rule they got a great idea he was filling in for um Lee Fowler for the
dearly departed Lee Fowler oh is he taking a poll I don't know but next Monday of course Sandy
comes back and then all you people are all upset the world will be at peace everything will be great
and we can talk about sugar cookies and everything will be wonderful when Sandy comes back
boy I miss Lee don't you it's just now yeah without Lee Fowler you're no okay it's 13 to 11 at W
and Z we'll take a little break here again and we'll come right back okay nine minutes before 11 at W
and Z and there's Hawaii John is in the building now look at that he's just already do take off and
of course if the bird gets his wings flapping fast enough it's ought to be a great trip trust me
so up here we are all alone abandoned by even the bird and I don't know what do you think Rich
think we ought to take some calls not sure let's not overdo it you know let's not press our luck
Mike Spindell did not call in by the way did he now shame on him and we're not going to you know
make a big deal out of it we're going to rip him from 11 to 2 but we don't want to make him pay
for his indiscretions and the errors of his ways but I can't believe that after the Simmons that
he started on the air here yesterday inviting people to come on next Sunday and rally against
the station shame on you Mike shame on you yeah let's rack him up let's take some calls and see
what these people want to talk about and if our good friend Jack calls in of course let's put him
on immediately if not sooner and very briefly of course in day 624 9400 and in Broward 524 9400
those are the numbers there's anybody still left in the audience I know it's kind of a rough
situation it's not really a lot to say is their boys and girls not much we can say that we haven't
said before but that's life in the big city okay let's start in Miami we'll get right to it you
know I sit here and I look at the lines and you just want to kind of postpone it like death
as long as possible but sooner or later hello hi yeah remember with few months ago you had
large against in doula on your program in hell and deal my favorite one of your favorites now
and maybe I think you should have this guy John Thompson and hefernan on Charles
had him on the other the other way yeah we invited Dr. Hefernan to come on the show he never
even returned our call now he's not going to come on in fact you know as he hung up on Jeff
Charles because he was getting disagreement so he's not going to come on with anybody who's
going to show him up for what he is and if you have what about this guy I'm Jack Thompson no chance
but if you had him but I think it's possible that if you have the guy on for what well what
the same reason why you had our intendo on the problem was over he didn't he never he probably
have ever been heard from the guy again I don't wait a minute wait a minute I don't have a problem
to understand I don't have a problem I had a problem with intendola yeah yeah he
no he caused the problem yeah but I don't have a problem Thompson's got a problem because he can't
tune his radio so he feels he's responsible for monitoring the public airwaves for the entire
community he doesn't understand that nobody cares about his opinion he just can't get that through his
skull and what do you even hear that you were yeah your opposite Charles so you didn't hear what hefernan
was on his program right no but Charles kept asking the same questions who you know who's going
to be the sensor why don't you just turn the dial and he kept saying and all he said to Charles
was why don't you stop asking me that yeah and another thing you seem to be very upset about these
guys that are calling these sponsors and trying to take you off but the thing is I found out one
thing I like to ask you this question I think you can answer it probably I think it seems like you
do the same thing with a Miami Herald no I don't I don't have anything to do with the sponsors
at the Herald the sponsors but no when you can't when you don't buy the Herald it's the same as
tuning off a radio station okay there's a very big difference okay you don't have to listen to
this program if you don't like it and if you don't like the Herald you don't have to buy it or
subscribe to it but as far as harassing their advertisers I have never done that and I never would
do that and I discourage people from doing it you don't have any business to tell people where it
advertised and either do I right what it how it what it happened in junior after said in here
what I mean was he did he hanged up too no he was in the studio with Reverend Rick Patterson you
mean on Bill McQuague show yeah no he well he got a mutual admiration society which of course
is almost unprecedented in the history of this business of having a desperate hillbilly talkost
on a desperate radio station bring somebody in who's trying to get a competing person off the
air it's unprecedented see when you can't compete the only way you can win is by getting everybody
else off the air so I guess IOD feels at this point the only way they can win is to get everybody
else to shut off their transmitter and get the worst talk show and it's still only have a three
share figure that out the quagga's a three I thought you'd have a I thought he have a one one
I mean the whole station no bill is still looking for his first listener oh well doom doom
where show he just do more shows on Florida power and light there you go that'll do it but what is
I heard you mentioned Steve Cain's rating what did he get oh boy well he hasn't you know been
there through a rating period but the first month of the summer book looks pretty grim for
Steve oh he's got very minute numbers how's on Alan stand doing against him are they are they
stand stand is beating both of them put together by a wide margin is he do how's that doing terrible
even worse than Steve oh and house and house and house and house as are Charles doing invisible
so you it's only you and stand in the whole market well no I don't want to say that I mean
there are other people who listen to other station and not a lot of them you can you know rent a
hall and save the electricity but there are few you know and I heard the bad and this about
this rally spindles I just came back this morning yeah I'd like to hear more about that I don't
really know the details um maybe I could attend I didn't understand you said he was going to have
a rally at your station I thought he'd have it on on Saturday at at Thompson's office or something
to try to get him to stop doing what he's doing and I don't understand why he'd have it at your
station well I can't speak for uh you know who I can't speak for him we're still waiting for his call
well you hear I usually hear it soon enough okay thank you
we're waiting for your call Mike poor Mike he gets into more hot water you know just by getting up
in the morning my any B cello hello yes I uh I'm a first time caller but however we did call
uh Portland on Friday we couldn't get in to tell you I work in an office and all 13 of us
decided that we're going to call Portland's income plane great and we called early enough
and when I called the operator wanted to know uh what we were calling about I said well we have
a complaint such a way to connect it to the corporate offices and I was wondering have you heard
anything about how many calls they got or no a lot a lot I'm not hundreds okay keep up the good
work Neil thank you up you here thanks a lot okay bye yeah no they got a tremendous number of
calls and of course some of the mouth contents uh obviously must have been calling over and over
and over again because they're looking to seize upon the opportunity and I got news for them as I
said on Thursday or Friday I guess it was Friday that all this garbage broke out uh it really
is a move point because I mean they're going to be here on this station or on another one does
make any difference which one it is and we were going along just fine and then of course so they
struck a responsive cord with a knee-endrathol in the company and the question remains to be seen
whether one knee-endrathol is going to well you know undermine the efforts that we've been doing
here for a very long time or whether the audience is going to prevail and I think that's really the
question you know whether it's letterman or whether it's Carson or me or a stern or anybody in
broadcasting are we doing our shows for the audience or are we doing them to please uh certain
individuals at corporate and it might come as a great surprise to uh Jack Thompson but I've seen
Carson absolutely and letterman also literally rip into the corporate head shots a big shots at NBC
did not call them douchebags but just short of that okay so well you know that's where it goes
there's nothing in anybody's contract that says you have to say nice things about corporate bigwigs
especially when they're in Portland Maine I mean if you live in Portland Maine what does that say
about you to begin with right okay Mike Welf is here he's uh boy you're just all over the place
these days aren't you you're just uh like the dreaded diseases becoming a fixture exactly just like
the boiler or the sink precisely and we're going to why I have somebody come in and clean you up
right after the news Mike Scott the headlines world news from CBS at 11 and when we come back at
1106 we're going to get to some of those really great calls well great that's a bat line would you
pick that up right away and put it on it but just put it on one of the lines because this is the
call that we've been waiting for the whole first hour by the way couple of people dropped off during
the news break which rarely happens on this show and you know what it hurt it hurt there's an
open line in data we're going to have to start giving the number again see we they've taken all the
momentum they've like blown the balloon here you want me to give the number no I have a lot of
experience they never you never hear anything nice that I say about you didn't I thank him and I
refer all their support yesterday a couple times I thank you twice you didn't listen to the
entire show yesterday in context because I was at the track it's a matter of priorities if I
have to choose between enjoying a beautiful Sunday at Calder or listening to your show
obviously going to listen to my show right okay first of all and boy this is this is very very
difficult everybody listening out there this is not a protest the management of the station as a
matter of fact if you had listened oh wait a minute you got to hold on a second okay would you hold on
yeah you're not going anywhere I'm all right hold on we got to call around a mobile phone they
always take precedence hello are you there yeah I'm putting you on right away I'm even putting
you on over Mike Spindell because you're on a mobile phone we don't want you to spend all that
money I appreciate that you know look what what I want to say will be brief no the other last week
in the week before you were apologizing I don't think you have to apologize to anybody I'm just
an average guy I write I 95 I'm making rounds between hospitals I listen to your program because
you make me feel good I laugh you do bits when I'm having a bad day one day I gotta just tell
you this one day I'm driving in Miami shores of all places right and you doing a bit on tattoos
if I went crazy you had some guy on from Fort Myers yeah and he was doing tattoos and you said
that you were gonna as a gift to or as a prize you were gonna tattoo somebody above their
Herman when I heard that I I almost wrote about their Herman and McBean yeah and uh is
no yeah of course who do you think you're talking to okay but that's why I like your program you
well I'm having a bad day and I turn on and I listen to a stick or a bit uh on the Pope or uh you know
the uh the true to your show I laughed it's funny I feel better for at least another 15 to 20 minutes
that's all I gotta say thank you sir thanks a lot okay I don't
are you still there what an upbeat club yeah I was outstanding how am I I didn't listen yes to try to
uh drive those people away with good stimulating topics like picketing the station no I didn't ask
them to pick it no wait a minute why are you whining like I didn't ask people to pick it the
management of the station this isn't Jack Thompson is he you're whining a little bit on the
yesterday by the way did he yep saying that he's monitoring me now oh well you're in a lot of trouble
now after I said when do you sleep he said that doesn't matter I'm monitoring you now now I ask people
support Neil Rogers and to oppose censorship with the philosophy being say yes to Neil not to
report to the radio station or to protest against management I would not do that I mean that's
cutting off one's nose in my case which would be ample despite one space I'm not going to do that
I did hear him by the way played a little bit of doggy in the window yesterday
I know how do you know I'm the one that didn't queue it up
the little bird that didn't queue it up hi go on
we used we used to get it did you listen to the show yesterday I missed it Mike now he
was the one who told me they were one of my oh yeah we got calls this morning people asking
about the rally yeah and it's not the protest station please you know no they make me off the
payroll because of what you're saying now of course that's not the important thing free speech is
I'm going to restrain myself
I've not did I say you were in all kinds of trouble look at how the man is embellishing
this story well did I say you were in all kinds of trouble okay I didn't say it now maybe
true but I didn't say it this is the rest of the story exactly the rest of the story is support
of kneels right and opposing the lunatic friends the Christian permittance out there more
of us for their ideas for censorship not protesting against the station the station has been more
than equitable we had our super meeting 10 days ago and everything was put there more
so you only thought it was a supra because you got free dinner
the only reason I thought I was a super meeting is because you got a free dinner that's all come on
we're going to be honest unbelievable I even get shots when I call in after I've been requested
why are you so sensitive would you please answer the question why are you sensitive I don't know
it's just something that it's kind of like why is Bob laughs at his so depressing I mean
anybody who watches Dave Johnson come on bring in Jesse or Roscoe why would he be sensitive he'd
used to punishment abuse well Jesse is going to be my guest next week but I can't wait what good
better keep him in here that let him pitch are we are we at least we put this into perspective I
am not protesting against the station it's in support it's say yes to kneel say notice answers
why we somebody would say yes to kneel but that's another that's a whole show in itself
we can't discuss anymore really my listen I hope I've dragged it out so to speak
what do you think should we let him off the hook yeah I think he definitely no your hearts in
the right play absolutely as usual your heart is always now your brain that's in the
history have a good day thank you Mike okay he's upset you can tell he's upset he's upset every day
no he's upset with me think I'm giving him shots yeah well where would he get that idea I don't
know we like Mike a lot of course now there's some in the audience that you know like to torment him
I've noticed because he reacts because they know that he's sensitive and he reacts that way
can get to him yeah now we do have an open line in date and boy that hurts I'm not sensitive but
I can't believe it six two four ninety four hundred I don't like giving these numbers out again
boy that's a bad omen it's a bad omen it's an omen of things to come well I like that he called
it the lunatic fringe I think that's a good time Christian primitive yeah now that is that's a
great line yeah Mike Spindell line both of those are very good very good excellent good work Mike yeah
he took the day off today to come up with those lines exactly lighthouse point hello good morning
meal rest and I like what that mobile proler said it's absolutely true you are truly a breath of
fresh air and how anybody would like a right mind at that station I don't know and I missed
Mike Spindell show yesterday and it's a very good reason last Sunday I turned on the station and
that time me or state I mean I couldn't believe it here one fall after another these old prunes

hi hi I know I called you up to thank you I called you to really thank you make me laugh today
for one thing but um and isn't that amazing how amazing it's so wonderful I'm on cloud nine really
I always thought that Sunday was the worst day of the week because you weren't on the radio and
there's nothing to do so I took your advice and went out to call her great but my last 20
dollars oh my last I mean to my name scraping yeah no money as I'm going to pick one horse what did
you bet one horse is one horse I'm gonna plunge it on the horse to win like go for bro yeah and so I
I bet on the horse go gator oh my god with her a burrito castillo junior you're the one that beat
me out in that race only what I mean I was like I was like in the I was so I mean you must you
must have a nervous breakdown because that was a that was so out I that was almost a triple dead
heat in that race I know wasn't that exciting and you know what I had what I had a nine 12 box
and a perfect and it came four nine twelve four nine twelve oh yeah I won the lottery I had
no money wow and what did that horse pay about the ten some twenty twenty dollars you got
200 bucks back oh my god I have a hard failure and I'm thanking you on my knees for it well let's
not get carried away I can go to win Dixie and try to round I can't believe it you know you really
you made my day yesterday ready or off you made my day well congratulations thanks okay thanks a
lot of you like that what a great weekend yeah I kept coming in second and third second and third
second and third if I box three horses they came in second third and fourth I did I had a good
comeback though I had the three horse in the last race which won by about eight million
lengths and I had to lay double and the a perfect in the ninth that I won most of my money back
so I minimized my losing sport when you're losing your brains and all of a sudden you go home
almost even for the day and ahead for the weekend you feel like you've won a million oh yeah oh
I'm telling you oh yeah he says he this man has no concept I do what you're talking exactly
didn't even know what I'm talking about but that a good royal warred law with Octavio
Avale's in the last race boy he won from here to tower number three just drew off in the stretch
with complete authority well now that's exciting oh this is a call from Naples is it Florida
or Italy hello oh comma stop no minus this no it's Naples Florida hi what's going on over
there in Naples oh well nothing too much it's a lovely beautiful day yeah right you should be swimming
yeah there are a lot of people in the audience think I should be swimming like at the bottom of the
pool you know um with cement shoes no I'm I'm a I'm like I guess I'm a Christian primitive
wow you allowed Gentile to call your show well one or two every day okay so can I be your token Gentile
for you don't know you don't understand what a Christian primitive is um excuse me you don't
understand what that slogan means it means a right wing fanatic like the born again Christians
who want to censor everything oh well I know I know I understand the meaning of the phrase
oh I see it was just this is the first time I heard it no I'm not taking a fan no of course
nobody takes offense to anything on this show if I say hello somebody takes offense
this is true no I just I just thought I've listened to you a couple of times because I can't often
I radio I can't often get you really well we'll talk louder we'll get leave
foul over here you'll be able to hear him in Texas oh but anyway you know it's really interesting
what I'm Mr Florida I guess about oh I guess about 22 years ago from where New York oh my god
born in Manhattan well I mean not 22 years ago but I was born in Manhattan and it's so
interesting it's interesting is hack to listen because your whole show it sounds like it comes from
you know east 70 seconds yeah from a civilization well now away from the states no way to second
oh I'm sorry did I say something wrong did I offend you huh did I offend the state of Florida
no okay no but it's the reason one of the reasons that I listen to your show is because it brings back
all of the bad stuff that I remember which is why I left New York oh that's good this is what you
call a backhanded compliment well sort of like what bad stuff well I think New Yorkers by and
large I'm not a New Yorker by the way oh no well that that was one of the questions that I wanted
to ask you I was going to ask you where are you from from upstate New York Rochester which is like
500 miles away from New York City and a million miles away from the New York City mentality if my
New York friends will pardon that expression I lived in New York for 23 years and I've never
went north of um Yonkers you know well the Yonkers is as far as you need to go boy and there's
Carmine Abatella with the three horse winning by six the Red Man we don't want to get into racing
again though the whole audience will turn us off I know I know that I'm not as stupid as you
think I am trust me close but not quite I don't know you brought the last collar to you know she's
on her knees for you so I thought that was rather interesting well that's the story of my life
this is this is the only radio show we can hear the phrase corporate douchebag and Christian primitive
in the same house exactly and in some cases we're talking about the same people
well I think that I think that there's nothing to be said um about uh free speech on the radio
although I caught your show late I caught your show kind of late so I'm not sure what do you mean
like late it only starts at 10 o'clock we're just beginning oh well I know so if you came in for
the third race and there's still seven races left in the card you're crazy I know are you
will you be that's why they hired me that's a prerequisite but let me ask you something are you really
I'm in favor I think this I'm in the Florida state law who is this gentleman's he on work release
this gentleman up there nice to see us sir if a whole crew of work release folks that they bring
through the building every day oh what do they do they just bring him in here they let him look
in on a show and look around wander around a building then they put him right back inside oh well
then why did they call it work release this is the work man when you come in here and you're
a part of the show boy it's work trust me it seems like a piece of cake doesn't it um on so very
innovating experience man talking to all of these malcontents they've all got their complaints
I'm not a malcontents I didn't say you were oh you and I are the only normal two in the whole bunch
well well I'm here to tell you you bet yeah I think so just ask jack he'll tell you a jack jack
Thompson oh I thought you were talking about my ex husband well him too oh he's definitely a
malcontent good well I'm glad you got rid of him would you do a little cyanide oh no I didn't get
rid of them I mean he's I mean he's still hanging around figuratively speaking right but um
anyway what's really interesting is that your show is is is like a little bit of a little bit of
smooth exactly is that what they say up north I haven't bit you know what I left New York 20
about 22 years ago and I've never been back I mean my family came down here I just I got
everybody down of Florida and not but but um I think that it's really I think that it's really
important that um people have a little bit of um how can I say in Miami it's probably hard to do
but I think people ought to have a little bit of compassion yeah little rock monis that's what they
say in New York excuse it rock monis that's Chinese for compassion no it sounds like it's
Yiddish oh no we don't use Yiddish on this show oh no well it's okay I mean I grew up in
there was a very famous Jewish Chinese philosopher though and we quote him frequently
excuse me his name was Moishi Pupik oh really yeah as in he was full brother to Confucius well
listen I don't want to get you all confused now because I seem to be getting you off the beaten track
and you obviously had something very important to tell us what excuse me I said you obviously
had something very important to tell us and I don't want to get you a side track I know I
it's well it's not all that important I just thought that maybe um I think maybe the people that
come down to Florida from New York um in the in the in the recent years like like the 80s and the
late 70s I think that I think that they're screwing up the state because we're getting a little bit
politically and everything else Florida is Florida still in the South yeah in the deep South
in the New Yorkers are not responsible for that most of the New Yorkers who came here are moderate
to liberal not right wing fanatics not Christian primitives that's what I'm saying it's well don't
you understand unless of course they eat the early bird in which case some of the Marjouish
primitives but that's another story you're not following this because you don't understand what I
mean over there in Naples it's like sleepy time I mean here it's like a bustling hustling
uh buttery meanderthal wait a minute no man's land baby cakes lottery used to be like that too
come on when I moved to Lauderdale you didn't have to wear shoes anywhere right I mean as long as

here's an interesting card it says i'm familiar with stooges blank i can't
read that in the term blank old buddies but the relationship you have with the
bird defies description
that poor guy laughs at everything you say even though you repeat yourself odd
in finitim
how often can he cackel when he hears tinkle all over or douche bag
he must get some extra dough for helping you try to be funny by the way if you
if they pay you more than minimum wage you owe the company some money audio

isn't acute from my ammy
another one who's listening right now just getting sexual excitement

response
michael may not show up for the headlines by the way is when he hears that record
uh...
well here's some copies of some letters now this is from a life insurance company
in uh...
my ammy
copy of a letter from a thirty seven year old man married with one child college
graduate et cetera and so on if a few malcontents can force you to change
mr. Roger style
then you need to reexamine your role as owner operator of that station
if a thousand calls came in complaining about mr. Roger's of the show in general
they'd be microscopic compared to those that enjoy and approve
well this is a good lot not reading the whole thing but it's a beautiful letter
and i think uh... what's his name head word
for that
here's a letter from cahillie would call upon you
well boy i bet you know what's in this
but you know something really sub-rosa in this envelope and look at that it's
on pink stationery
now it's not from just right here
sorry i don't even understand what this whole thing is

bizarre okay let's take the calls and forget about all this foolishness
because if we start reading the mail again oh let's not forget about that
here's a card from key west

airplane stuff in the background for water deal hello
yeah good morning how are you okay
this is your diabetic listener in Oakland park and i hope you're sitting down
because i try to reach it for two hours Friday but majors came in and you got
wound up and i'm trying to know and i have this morning
number one i have good news and bad news for you right from the horse
this month you want the good of the bad first will take it as it comes
sir i give you the good we can handle it yeah because the bad news is it's quite
a little entry there's an interview with Edmund answer to those channel seven
yeah yeah on of channel seven and town right and one of the business
channels that i get there is one little bit here that i think you'll find
interesting they ask him a question and he answers i'm not sure that it is
self-concious about it's image and his answer is i'm not sure that it is
self-conscious i think my amy tends to be confused about it's image clearly my
amy has changed a lot the Jackie Gleason days are ancient history the strength
of the Miami images that it is an exciting vibrant community with a lot
of things going on that appeal to a lot of different people
neal Rogers a local talk show host is the new Jackie Gleason that was in the
in the article now you there i'm here yeah all right but you sound you don't
believe what i'm doing i didn't hear that last part i was otherwise uh...
about you did you hear about that your neal Rogers is the new Jackie Gleason of
self-lorda who said that answer the owner channel seven in this interview he
said that i almost fell off the chair when i read that
and then i could be an interview with that sixty seconds with edlin and some
yeah okay now
i personally called
i get that Friday and i had my attorney also get a whole Mrs. Paulie i'm an
ex attorney so yes i'm context
i spoke to mr. Gilbertson for forty five minutes really correct
and i told him that he was violating my civil rights and also my first
amendment rights by telling me who i can listen to and what
what i'm not supposed to listen to
is also violating your civil rights
and your first men and rights and you have a legal right to every card that was
taken out of that place
yeah there was nothing that we play that's an all right to take it there's
nothing i've been here contract supposedly that says everything
that you need to make a living that's part of your material
whatever you made on card that played that belongs to you
and if they don't give it back to you whether or not you stay on the station
or play it again or give information you still have the right and should
sue them for those cards that's number one number two there is definitely a
conspiracy that's been going on for months between the i just i
s's
they've been dealing with Mrs. Paulie who was a typical period
tanical mind up in new England
they don't care about ratings they only care about
pandering to the health of the archdiocese to some Jewish and Cuban organizations
that they've been getting heat from however he was on them enough to tell me
that the call Friday that you you know calling in into Portland
a three to one in your favor
yeah
and i don't think that you can last on the station they may let you go
may let you out of your contract which is the way he taught
oh that's fine with me oh that's what he said
that's what he said and i told him he's a horse is asked
because i you know you've turned this town around
the only thing worth listening to are doing down here i've been here ten years
i used to come to Florida i told you 40 years ago when there was
when there was life down here
not there's nothing here and i'm i plan to leave within the year with my son to go back
to california or why because i can't take it anymore
i'm going to miss you but you'd be you can't live on whether kneel
hang here only for climate and there isn't another station if you leave i know you can
get work anywhere
and hold to stay in this community
because even though many sports support you then i detractors
or i'm monitoring you
you've got diabetes like i have and you're going to put yourself in an early grave
and nobody will have pre no nobody cares about it down here
you wasted yourself for the governor like martinus
and the and the and the and the tall attitude down here
it's and the the fact that you're homosexual all these things
they've been working for months behind the scenes
so don't just think it just happened in the last few weeks
because of what you've been playing
now i'm getting this from the horses mouth up in portland
and this is probably she plays miss plays miss nice guy when she sees you
and everything because she loves your show
but she wants you off the air too
now if you're smart you will not take an enforce vacation on friday
because of duty what they get to build quality when he left
when you left town
well i hate to break the news to you or to them
but i do have a contract which i have right here on the tables a matter of fact
and uh... they are going to do anything to anybody
and uh... you know if they uh... they would like me to leave
let me let me tell you one thing if i left here on friday
i would
hello they have new uh...
it's in the voice learning you know that to open up your account
now they have new overdo it new things they made up that you did
the pope is an a dash dash
h dash dash
yeah i said that
a seventeen year old caller is advised by show host to show pornographic films
to his sister
right oh yeah i don't remember sure
i don't remember that one
you know they put in one or two that i said and they make up a lot of other stuff
like uh... you know the floor in the uh... confetti
that was still in the floor in a uh...
a p show
yeah i still think is a great line
yeah wish i thought of that one
why do Cuban men wear mustaches because they want to look like their mothers
h h h
oh the one about confessionals isn't here again
yeah yeah i say they left that one in
well we got a letter for taffy
this is great
great
well this is good and of course the uh...
Catholic church
and the local arts diocese in a frantic full court press just before the holy
father gets here
oh that's just a coincidence
yeah just a coincidence isn't it of course
just like the last time was just a coincidence
also want to thank a lot of people who sent me copies of letters that they sent
to a guy again at broadcasting we give the address out on friday and saturday
and of course you know they're always going to be one or two clinkers in the
bunch like this car you'll be delighted to hear what's from
it says
poor neal Rogers everyone is picking on him even the owners in Maine
and he'll hasn't done anything bad mister goberts insuries harassed the senior
citizens of halendale badmouth cane rantell foulard charles
whirthing
cal year can't patent McDermott cocks witchner
zagat sagaki mccalum to name a few sure he's tried to lure a few young boys
from quick check to go to Hawaii with him
but he's queer that's his sex satisfaction yes
he's made douchebag and asshole household worlds but gosh is everyone perfect
but neal will persevere he can always get a job in a glass factory blowing glass
but here's the good one
mister rogers when you go you won't be missed one doesn't have to know you
well to know you are phony merely listing you a few times
is proof positive a few times yeah wait till you hear this now if you were to
shock jock all our stern from new york your ratings would not be what they are
however even you should know this market's not new york and to copy stern is
to be a mere copycat i predicted you as your worst enemy will rule the day you
adopted the sleigh signed her
shekna
who can't shut it off all you they are being unbelievable
great letter is not great you got to be up another tweety bird maybe you in this
tweede together and make little tweety's together
he listen folks well i'm sure that he's fly you know you can meet in mid air
he sent me a list of other nickbames for tweety really
tweet the tweester i like that the tweester that rhymes with keyster
the bird man that's another good one very good i like your mail north
north Miami hello
yeah okay good you know i'm very strong supporter of you in your radio station
your philosophies and when i heard that all those great songs and material were banned you know it
heard it heard and i have a list here of 168 people on the home we're presenting in a
petition but you don't have the listing in front of you obviously
and what i've included i've come to is that there's a piece of this puzzle missing
whereas you have the 19 or 10 share of the audience you know 80 or 100,000 people who really enjoy your
program and non-offended to blame that enjoy everything you say and you have an
info of the angel for now intense but when these cars come into corporate headquarters
or your station nine you're a lover is making these decisions to ban programming
everything sounds like a crime quest so the misdeeds of the puzzle it's missing
is the sponsors they are the money people you take a sponsor i don't know how many you have
maybe it's a dozen or two dozen and you and stand on the other people
they are supporting or they are advertising in a radio station it's reaching 10% of the population
that i have a slight background advertising that is an unbelievable number
we are at the other radio station they're just pissing off pulling away their money on one or two percent
so these are the people that should be putting the pressure on your corporate headquarters
and put one main and your station manager and programming directors
wait a minute the station manager wait a minute sir sir hold it
the station manager and the program director we don't have a problem with those people
it is not a local problem in other words we have people here who are paid to operate
and program and manage the station and even though you know we've had a couple of
disagreements which is always going to happen
but you know the problem is with basically as i understand it one individual
in corporate headquarters at Portland main
who basically is also as i understand it i you know he didn't sign my contract
he didn't hire me i don't work for him and i have nothing to do with him
i know he's saying me over to yourself i know for yourself history is permitted
he sits up there in Portland main he's had some big cooperation
i don't know how many companies he controls he gets a club from the sky
jack Thompson or the odd style of this sort of you know it admittedly we think that they're crazy
but they are i guess somewhat well spoken and they talk to him and they tell him this
and him being up in Portland may not listen to his station not knowing
that there's a lot of young people down here who are in love with this station
and you've brought life back to listening to radio
and you know he has to take that call and he has to act on it
i mean any president or CEO of a large corporation is going to defend a corporation
for many hint of scandal and this guy is turning up the scandal's accusations
and whatever else they do but i think they're the only so boring effect
who has to come from this point you know these
the sponsor's are other corporations and they've come to our money to your station
they pay everybody's salary and they supply all the perks and everything else
the government has to support the operation and your operation is incredibly successful
so if they would make these cars to Portland name you will see that all your cars will come back
and you'll get a raise and everything will be great
but the people in need have to know that the sponsors are behind you too
yeah okay well i appreciate it
okay thanks very much
okay got some open lines in date now 6249400
and we have some incredible cheesecake that just arrived okay
can't believe it

and at W.I.N.Z.
Got a couple of open lines in Broward now, boy.
They're just hurt.
They're just hurt.
Well, this key lime pie is so good.
524, 9400, cheesecake, et cetera,
at 324, South Flamingo Road in Pember Pines.
That's in that little shopping center, right?
Little strip shopping center.
I don't know.
But it's great.
You don't know?
That's not my neighborhood.
I've got the mic so far away from you now,
because you've got all this lined up.
Look at this.
You've got it all lined up in front of them, like an assembly
of priorities.
The mic, you know.
Food.
Right.
I noticed you.
You're going to be losing a lot of weight
when I'm going from here.
I figured out all these premials long gone, baby.
Adios.
So when you leave, the premials leave.
But don't you say it?
Unless Donald gets a lot of free meal.
Ah!
He might understand that the Greg and Donald
are going on a cruise together, is that right?
Three days and two nights.
It must be the cruise.
Wonder what the sleeping arrangements are in that cruise.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Because we discourage that kind of stuff, you know what I'm saying?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
No more of that.
No more touching below the waist in this town.
No more even touching above the waist.
Jack Thompson will be on you guys.
He'll be monitoring on that ship.
Beautiful.
There will be a little tap on the cabin door.
Ah!
I'm entering you, Donald.
Well, I'll tell you what, I was doing fine until a guy called on him.
I believe in him, he was a good caller about a quarter to twelve.
Oh, yeah.
The one who had the 45 minute conversation with Mr. Gilbertson.
Yeah.
That really bugs me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That they would say something like that.
Well, not only that, but you know the impression, of course, I'm getting it second-hand and I'm
a little leery of that.
That's right.
But the impression that Mrs. Holly and the whole corporate from top to bottom in the station
and of course this is a very conservative company to say the least.
But if you don't have their support, then what's the point of it?
What is it that they wanted?
They wanted a bigger audience, they wanted a younger audience, they wanted living and
breathing people.
They wanted to take a day part that was dead, 50,000 watts midday that was dead for years.
So dead is a door nail and pump life into it.
And then pump life back in afternoon drive would stand.
And we've done it.
And to be fair, Mark Cune is well aware of that and what you did.
The local people are fine.
The local management, they were well aware of what you did.
You did what you were hired to do.
Bring audience to the radio station in your time period.
And you certainly accomplished that.
And they were fine.
Yeah.
Totally support you.
I'm not saying anything new, I guess.
You've said all this, right?
Well, we'd like to re-innerate the salient points here for the heart of hearing.
But the hearing impaired, you know.
I'm going to go back to eating now.
Well, just both eat.
We'll have eating sounds.
A new format.
No.
Can't offend anybody by that.
Right?
Well, I don't know.
It's disgusting.
They're making gone-of-roll sounds on the radio.
They're eating.
They're eating with their mouths full.
And you better watch it because somebody's monitoring what you're eating.
You hear that, Donald?
Miami, hello.
Loneal.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby.
How you doing, Bobby?
How you doing, Bobby?
Well, another one of our young listeners whom we've corrupted.
Listen, I'd like to book it.
You even look through it?
Well, we've got it.
We're not allowed to read that book.
No, it's a little too racy for wins.
Yeah.
I don't understand what I'm going to do.
Like look at it at all.
Well, I have it right here as a matter of fact.
The romance of the Blust.
That's it.
That's very, very interesting.
I want to know about the stains on the book, Bobby.
Believe it or not, those are two stains.
Three stains?
Yeah, but...
Oh, yeah.
Like Gail Stewart was one of the three ladies.
Yeah, and the tea lady.
And there's some lines here that are even crossed out.
Well, no, no.
The red ones are for you to read.
They're not crossed out.
I was trying to highlight them, but I couldn't find any.
Oh, we thought Jack Thompson had...
Oh, my God.
...sintered the book.
He got up and lifted her on the edge of the bed.
Through her back, taking her legs under his arms.
Oh, and it goes on.
I can't even read the rest.
Yeah, Jackal.
I don't dare read the rest because they're monitoring us.
You get like an A-tracker and listen to that tape.
No, we're still...
We're going to go to the Smithsonian Institute to find an A-track.
You got great sense of humor, Bobby.
Bring us an A-track.
Why don't you bring us an Edison cylinder?
Hey, if I can find one, no.
You know how they used to have like wax cylinders
way before either one of us were born?
No, see what?
That's the stuff they play on KAT.
See, those people...
...as an A-tracker, the people who did it,
they used to play on Monty Trainers.
Really?
Yeah, and I went there one night and they were handing a mod and everything.
So I got one and I was listening to...
I listened to...
This was like five years ago.
You know, and I was listening to it and then I had a head in the rain and I all of a sudden said,
maybe they have a use for it, maybe they'll get a kick out of listening.
I noticed a lot of pages in this book are dog earring here, you know that?
Why is that?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, just happened by accident.
Yeah, slip of the pen I guess.
Slip of something.
Slip of something, yeah.
Boy.
You guys are right, you know that.
Well, listen, you better listen real close.
Now you're still coming in here Wednesday?
Sure.
Well, you better listen tomorrow to find out if you should come in on Wednesday.
Oh yeah, I'm gone, I'm gone.
Every day could be the last one.
You're laughing, I'm serious.
Yeah.
Yep.
Is Kyle on the case in?
Kyle, is he new what when to get out?
Oh yeah, well, just...
He needs his attention, he needs it.
Yeah, that means you can go into match or control and the health, Bobby.
Yeah, he's got to spend all that big raise it to give, you know.
No, he's good to me.
What did he say?
I asked him if I could stay in here on this last Sunday.
Absolutely not.
Well, that line is going around a lot here.
No, but he needs to lighten up a little bit.
I mean, I'm sure he's a nice guy and everything.
You are?
Uh huh.
Nothing.
Kyle.
He is a nice guy.
Oh yeah, he just, you know, takes a lot of abuse and he responds in kind, that's all.
Yeah.
That's not personal.
I was very, very impressed with everything I saw there last Wednesday.
I'll bet.
I mean, everybody was so friendly, so not especially, you know, grand art.
Yeah, look out for him.
I'm telling you.
Yeah, can you believe, Bobby, that some people don't like me, that have never even met me?
I mean, see, if they just, you know, take the bag, these old bags.
Well, some are young bags.
They've never met me, never talked to me, but they hate me.
Can you understand that?
I'm not around.
I mean, well, all the listeners out there, you guys take it from me.
Grand Hill is the nicest guy he just played about.
This is a coming from someone who actually met me.
Who evidently got to know you real well.
I mean, if you just take the time, you're talking for two minutes.
Okay, I mean, you'll understand where he's coming from.
You understand he's a caring person.
And, you know, you put a lot of criticism on social problems, right?
Anything else?
It's just shock radio.
All right, I don't take any more time, guys.
Why not?
Why not?
I don't know if you guys want to keep me on all state, aren't I?
Yeah, but you think to say?
Yeah, I mean, if you have anything to say, Bobby, that would be good, but, you know.
Right.
I'm curious.
Now, how old is he?
19.
19.
Oh, so you're like...
I've been married in two months.
He's getting married in two months.
So you're like a legal person.
Almost, yeah.
Yeah.
So you don't have to get permission from your family to speak to us on this show.
Oh, no.
They're not worried about we're going to corrupt your morals.
I'm already corrupted.
And your fiance, Bob, does she know that you've been reading this book?
This was her book, originally, but don't you?
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Jackson, you look upset.
Now, you know why he sounds so happy all the time.
Well, listen, I hope you had a good time already because after today, no more hanky-panky-bomb.
All right, Bob, this is listening.
No, I don't mean that.
I'm talking about just in general.
We've banned any of that kind of activity.
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
So you can think about it, but don't do it.
Oh.
And don't think about it much.
Yeah.
Think about it very briefly, like, you know, a couple of seconds at a time.
I still got a good hand, right?
No, you can't do that either.
I do that.
Boy, this guy, he just...
You just don't get the message.
The massage, do you?
He is.
None of that.
Well, what are you supposed to do with all this stuff?
Well, forget about it.
Just take a lot of cold showers and think good, clean pure thoughts and go see the pope when he comes here.
I bet if I'm blindfolded and I can't see.
Well, then it's okay.
Okay.
All right, well, Gwen, I'll give you a call tomorrow night.
Great.
Tomorrow night?
Or afternoon.
Tomorrow night.
I'll get home.
Listen, I think I need to have a little chat with your fiance, but...
I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.
Well, she has a right to know.
I mean, if there's a third party involved, I think she's got a right to know.
There's not a third party involved.
It sounds like it to me.
You're upset.
And don't get jealous.
I'm not jealous.
You sure?
Positive.
All right.
Well, maybe a little.
He's a nice guy.
Very nice guy.
Came by here, met us all.
Interesting getting into this business.
I tried to talk them since and do it.
Are you serious?
Oh, don't do it.
I mean, if this week's experience hasn't taught you that this is the worst business in the world to get into.
I mean, it's like turning your life over to a bunch of vultures if you pardon that expression.
God.
Well, anybody would want to be in this business.
What is this?
I don't know, but don't put any of that.
I mean, that stuff is so rich.
And he's just eating it and eating it and devouring it.
He likes the new deal.
Oh, my God.
They took my blood sugar right now.
I'll be about like 4,000.
I'll give some of this to Charlotte who's sending out Pope stickers today for it.
Oh, thank you, Charlotte. That's very nice.
Yeah.
I'll take a raid with some goodies.
I mean, something to eat.
We have a caller on a mobile phone.
Hello.
Hi, Neil. How are you?
Okay.
Well, I've been in broadcasting for 15 years and listening to all this reminds me of an experience I had in Cleveland that a very highly rated radio station.
And fortunately, the owner is there.
Had some sense about them.
But apparently what's happening here is your Mr. Gilbertson is a freight of power that isn't in his hand.
In other words, a nine rating is something he can't handle.
Yeah.
And you having the nine rating and you being the person responsible for it, he can't handle it because he's out of control.
Yeah.
That's why he's trying to exercise control by taking cuts out of the studio.
I'm sure there's lots of sensible owners that would be happy to have your nine rating.
A lot of them.
You can go to the bank on it.
That's right.
Like tomorrow.
Yeah. Like yesterday.
So good luck to you and I hope you stay in this market.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
Okay. It's 19 before 1 at WINZ.
We continue the winds wake.
Oh, I just can't believe that this is beyond my comprehension and this is even going on.
I know.
I know.
Never expected it.
Came out of the penalty.
The penalty you pay for success.
Mm-hmm.
Just came out of the blue.
Because it's not important in life that you succeed, but that your employees fail.
Or something like that.
There's that famous Chinese philosopher, Somdum goi.
That was a great line.
I know what they're going to put that in the voice that'll be in the next day.
Somdum goi.
Another anti-Genthal remark.
It's just a show.
They got a sense of humor, don't they?
That archbishop.
What a sense of humor he's got.
That's why they walk around with a dress on.
Okay.
18 till 1 at Wynne.
Stan made you come along at 2.
Well, I'm just all choked up from it's either from the calls or the cheesecake.
Well, I can't believe either.
I'm getting older or the breaks are getting shorter.
We just keep coming back here like crazy.
It's 12.45 at WINZ.
We have somebody at the Hollywood PO.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
How you doing?
It's wet toilet post office.
It's why?
It's powder with branch.
Oh, sorry about that.
The main office is kind of crazy.
We're out here in the branch.
I got your bumper sticker today.
Good.
Hey, hey, did you guys ever think about high wind or planes that fly around with that bang on the back of it?
Well, the Pope's here.
You know, they can sort of like hover around them when he's saying mask on its tropical park.
Yeah, not a bad idea.
You know, or that other one that David Peel has that Pope's smoked dope.
Or do you say that anymore in here?
I don't know.
We're going to have to figure that out tomorrow.
Yeah.
We got to, you know, tomorrow we're going to have to really get into the intricacies of what we can say hello or goodbye or boynish.
You know what it's going to be.
Oh, you know what you're going to tell him.
You know, your show is very much like the original Saturday night and live when it first came out.
You know, I mean, a real pioneer in this field down here.
So tell him, you know, tell him that Saturday night lives in controversial when it first came out.
But look at it today.
It's established.
And your show is a lot like that.
Yeah.
The pioneer of South Florida.
You're on the threshold of a new beginning and radio down here.
Well, I think we've already crossed the threshold, but now, you know, it's time for a divorce.
Well, hopefully you'll go someplace else if they don't let you dig a thing here.
Hopefully somebody will let you do your thing.
Well, like I said, all they got to do is write me a check and, you know, write a little letter and say,
let's go our separate ways and I'm all set.
It's fine with me.
Yeah.
Hey, funny kids.
You guys ever think of having Father Guitars or Gucci on one of Pope's here?
You know, I mean, he is the fat, and a Vatican gossip columnist.
I would be appropriate.
Something to think about.
Something to think about.
Well, I'm putting one of those bumper stickers on the back of the Pope's mobile.
I mean, he might be a Beatles fan.
Yeah, there you go.
You never know.
Okay.
All right. Take it easy.
Have a great day.
All right.
Unbelievable.
Some of the stuff in the mail, I mean, it's just so good.
Let's go to Homestead.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
I was bored when I heard you got the Paul Boomer and Lord Windersmere record.
Yeah, it's got it right here.
I first got that in 1960 and all places of Memphis, Tennessee, at WRC, which is a CBS affiliate up there.
Uh-huh.
Plus, I was going to send you a copy of it.
I've got it stored up there with some other things.
But I've got copies of Jonathan Wenders doing some very interesting things, which you can't get on record.
Yeah, I've got that too.
Oh, Lenny?
Yeah.
Oh, that's one of my favorites.
Yeah.
Don't stay away too long.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a good adic.
Yeah.
All right.
Do you have the Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin?
Yeah.
You got that.
You got all that stuff.
And I've got one of, um, Casey Kasim.
I got a great tape that I could never play on the air, but it's a classic.
Right.
Well, there's no name made sending you all that stuff, man.
No, I appreciate it, but I've heard it all, and I only wish we could play it on the air.
That's the same, because some of it's great.
I guess now is not a good time to be playing it on the air, right?
I wouldn't think so.
No.
But I'm glad to hear you playing on staying in the market.
I first started listening to you.
Yeah, well, I'm not going to let anybody turn my life upside down.
That's one of the things I've seen done to friends of mine in the business.
And, you know, one of my big complaints about this business in general is that the talent
are treated like animals, like they're not even human beings at all.
Like they have no lives and no feelings, no ties, no nothing.
And I'm not going to ever put myself in that position where they're going to just turn my whole life upside down
for their own benefit because they're too stupid to understand what they've got.
Yeah, they really are.
Because you're the most entertaining thing in Miami.
Well, that's the problem.
Are ridiculous.
Yeah, they don't want to be entertaining.
Exactly.
You know, Miami's a very place, and they want to keep it that way.
It seems that way.
Yeah.
But stick to it.
Don't give up.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Next call around a mobile phone again.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
I always thought I'd come up with a couple of days, and I've been listening to you since I've been back again.
And what's going on for tomorrow that you're saying they're going to come down and make some kind of disillusion or what?
Well, Gilbert's is going to be here in town.
He's one of the corporate head and the Anderthals, and he's going to be here.
We're going to have a meeting, I guess, after I get off the air, or before whatever.
And, you know, we're going to decide what we all want to do.
And if he wants to let me do my thing and leave me the hell alone, that's fine.
We'll continue doing our thing and life will go on.
And if he doesn't, then, you know, they can write me a check and we'll come to some kind of a settlement
and tear up my contract.
Say goodbye.
What would he even bring them down here with these kind of ratings?
I mean, why would he come down from the idiot right of a letter and say, hey, you're the bad guy in the radio?
Well, he was already on his way.
He was coming here for another purpose, but obviously there is a crisis that he has precipitated by his behavior
by responding to, you know, a handful of people who wrote letters or made phone calls up there.
You know, it's an organized movement by people like this, Jack Thompson and Dr. Heffernin and some of the, you know, Catholic fanatics and other nuts who want to get me off the air.
And, you know, this is a reaction to it.
If you got a moment, would you be kind enough to give me that portman number I didn't get it today?
Yeah, it's area code 207-797-930.
Well, Gilbritz should still be there. I'm sure he's in Oklahoma City.
Oh, oh, oh.
But where should I call you to voice my opinion?
Well, you're guessing you can call that number.
I mean, you know, obviously there are people at the corporate headquarters.
I don't really think it makes any difference how many calls he gets because they had hundreds, if not thousands, of calls on a Friday,
and probably got a lot more today. But I don't think that makes any difference.
I mean, you're dealing here with a mentality that, you know, because obviously if they cared about what the audience wanted in the first place,
this wouldn't have been started at all because the, you know, the ratings show that we got this enormous audience.
And that, obviously there's a sizable number of people out there who enjoy what we're doing.
So, you know, if that were the criterion, then, you know, it wouldn't make any difference.
That's ridiculous. It's totally ridiculous.
Well, I know it's ridiculous. And I agree with you. And it's unfortunate for me to even have to come in here and go on the year under these circumstances,
like doing a show under a dark cloud and wondering, you know, what it is that I'm going to say that's going to get somebody upset.
And what we can do, and of course, they haven't laid out policy.
Our local management laid out company policy. And we discussed it less than two weeks ago.
And that's what makes it even more ironic is that we've got too many chiefs and not enough Indians
and too many people making corporate decisions here.
Now, that's true with most of the big business.
Yeah. Do I appreciate your time?
Thanks for calling. I appreciate it. For Lauderdale. Hello.
Hi.
Hi.
I've got a little complaint here. I've listened to your radio station and you in particular, all summer.
And tomorrow I have to go back to work so I won't get to listen to you anymore.
But I listened to you for the entertainment. But I got educated.
That man I wrote to you about two weeks ago from Bahamas that said you had nothing educational.
Oh, yeah.
I went to my local porn store, which is no longer renting, you know, because they're not supposed to.
There was a poster of Jeff Stryker. Now I'm educated. I know.
Well, that's a good education in itself. There's no question about that.
But Don, you ruined my whole plan. I wasn't going to have any education this summer.
Yeah. Well, a little bit of education, you know, that's what it's all about.
Okay. Well, thank you anyway. I'll miss you.
Okay. Good luck. Bye-bye.
Okay. Let's go to Miami. Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, Neil. This is Ginger.
I am getting ready to go back to school, back to college.
I've been listening to you this whole summer.
And when I got back down here, guess what I'm going? Nashville, Tennessee.
Oh, boy. Well, good luck to you.
Yeah. It's going to be fun.
But I wanted to tell you real quick, I kind of know what you're going through because my first year of school, I went to Liberty Bad Discolleids.
Do you follow school either?
Yeah. Then you know the mentality.
Yeah. Well, I went and I was studying broadcasting there for a year.
And we had a little radio station on the campus.
And I got kicked off because I played Christian music that had a B2.
Oh, shame on you.
Yeah. It was really ridiculous.
But I don't know. I'm still a Christian and everything.
But I really like your show.
And it's good to see you have an open mind and everything.
I've really enjoyed it this summer.
I guess hopefully you'll be around at Christmas and I'll be home then and I'll listen then.
Have you ever spent any time in Nashville?
Yeah, I spent all last year there.
Oh, you were there one previous year. And you didn't mind it?
Well, it was all right.
I mean, it's nothing like Miami.
Yeah. It was okay. What were you there?
I was there for two long months in one month.
No, one month in 1980 and a fall of 80.
Oh, okay.
And boy, it was a long month. It seemed like ten years.
Why?
Just the people are so...
Oh, they're so clannish. You know, with a K and they're so bigoted and so bizarre.
And they all look like they came out of a cave.
The people don't even look the same as people in civilization.
Oh, I know. That's true.
And I'm getting educated up there.
Like when you go to Kroger, you know, the women have those little wispy beards and a corn cob pipes
and they look like a blanket and drag or something, you know, it's strange.
Yeah. Yeah.
I guess you could use to it.
Yeah, I got used to it after a while, but I missed the beach, you know.
And I missed all...
You know, there's nothing like South Florida, of course.
But, you know, I'm getting educated up there.
Got only nosewood. I'll be like when I get out of it.
When I guess...
Well, just as long as you don't grow a beard, you'll be okay.
Oh, okay.
Okay, well, good luck to you.
And we'll be around somewhere.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
All right, bye-bye.
Okay, Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Bill?
Yeah.
I enjoy your show.
Thank you.
Listen, I haven't listened to your show for about a week.
I heard you get a lot of pressure about changing your show.
Yeah.
Where's that down from the station or from the FCC?
No, none of it has anything to do with the FCC.
We don't have any FCC problems.
And that's what makes it even more ludicrous.
But the corporate management is starting to tinkle all over themselves
and have a nervous breakdown.
How's there so far, campaign going?
Well, you know, we sent all the petitions off,
and we have people in Washington working on it.
And, you know, we'll see what the FCC response is.
I think that they've had so much flack.
You know, the best that we get from the members of Congress
is that they're just... they're not doing anything.
They're not going after anybody and that they're really
showing away from using that ruling
because they realize that they've stepped on dangerous territories.
So I think they've gotten some intimidation from it.
Oh, okay.
I have a good day.
Thank you.
North aid. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Are you joined?
Okay.
Uh, a morning 12 years old,
and I usually...
You can listen to your radio station while parents are home.
Well, they are home?
Well, when they're not home.
When they're not home, you sneak on the radio.
Yeah, I usually... in the nighttime, too, you know?
Do they know about it?
Yeah, sometimes they walk in and they say,
oh, who you calling them?
They're not just at the radio station.
Uh-huh.
You don't tell them which one though.
Well, I was going to call in on all these... all these Haitians, right?
I mean, I don't mind them, but one time I went through in a metro room,
and I went inside and it's done.
Yeah, okay.
Well, listen, you call Stan and I'm sure he'll be delighted to talk all about Haitians
with you.
Okay, we don't discuss Haitians on this show.
Oh, boy.
Where are mommy and daddy when we needed them, right?
Okay, we have an open line in date, 624-9400.
I don't know, it's going to take me a week just to get through the mail from today.
And there's something else, I guess, I should say,
because a caller earlier made a very good point about Bill Calder,
and there are others, but, you know, people who unceremoniously like kind of disappear
from the air in the middle of the night,
and then nobody knows what happens to them and stations have a tendency to be a little tight-lip
about giving out any information.
So, because I have a lot of friends out there,
and there are a lot of people in the business who listen to this show,
if by any bizarre circumstance, whether it's today or a week from Sukus or whatever,
but if for any reason I should not appear on the station again,
on any day, they can contact Tom Jicca at the Mime News
or Linda Thornton at the Harold and leave a telephone.
Now, I'm not talking about listeners, I'm just talking about people in the industry
or people who have a personal need to get in touch with me,
and I can get in touch with them that way.
I just mentioned that, I'm not saying there's anything imminent,
but it's just something I want to go on record with,
because there are an awful lot of people who really get screwed badly in this business,
and they just disappear in the middle of the day, and that's the end of it.
You think that I'm going to put that idiot on the air? Jack Thompson?
He thinks he's going to go on the air?
What was that? He hung it up?
Hey, Neil.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing, babe?
Enjoying your job?
See, anybody that would listen, I mean, here's an attorney, his name is John B. Thompson.
I'm glad I put him on for a couple of seconds.
And this guy is a mental case, a mental case,
who is in the process of harassing, he's an attorney in Coral Gables,
harassing this, not just this program, the entire station,
and the people in Portland are such neanderthals,
anybody that would pay attention to a guy like this,
has got a serious problem, and they deserve each other.
Mike Wolf is here with a headline, CBS has the news at 1,
and we'll come back at 106.
And now it comes...
the low...
the low...
below the waist.
Somebody sent me a clipping from this, this is from the West Kendall Gazette, I think.
Mm-hmm.
From my good friend, Ed Cohen.
A bigotry pollutes the airwaves, in perspective by Edward Cohen.
I'm not going to read the first part, although it's just incredible.
Some of the things he says in here, for example, he talks about OcN's tower being cut down,
and he says, I'm not suggesting that sabotaging towers is the best way to get rid of these radio stations,
but is there a better suggestion?
Isn't that a brilliant line?
I think maybe Ed's brain is going soft.
Luckily no one reads that paper.
Now you see what I've said about this market, about people who allegedly...
it's what I say to market, about the area.
People who are allegedly your friend, who couldn't give a damn at all.
And when they can use you and manipulate you, then they're your quote-unquote friend.
Oh yeah.
And Ed Cohen was a guest on my show for what, 10 years?
Mm-hmm.
Covered a lot of elections together on election night?
Mm-hmm.
A good friend, I thought.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe you've seen this over and over.
Yeah.
And I'll listen to this toward the end of the article.
Those of you who are interested in the Pope bashing that is coming over the air from at least two talk-hosts,
will probably be surprised to learn that in at least one case it was an issue the last time the Pope visited the United States.
And then he quotes the Miami News and he had a tutorial when they defended my right to be on air, et cetera, and so on.
Well, here we are again.
The Pope is coming to our town and Rogers has added again on different station.
Only this time, instead of the serious, issue-oriented criticism of the pontiff,
one gets mostly vulgar, tasteless recordings of dubious social value
that demean Rogers in my thinking even more than the Pope.
It is an extension of the new format Rogers has chosen elementary school sexual and expritori in you window and jokes,
presumably in defiance of the FCC.
Having spent many years as Rogers guest political analyst,
I can only say with regret that it's not the bleat that bothers me, it's these stupidity.
Mm-hmm.
End of quote from my good friend Ed Cohen.
Mm-hmm.
So you see now that I will, he's aware that obviously I'll never be on my show again,
because I don't do that kind of show anymore, it's nothing personal.
We don't do those boring kinds of shows where we bring Ed to sit in here,
and you know, I've got the greatest respect for him up until I read this article.
I was thinking about him just the other day,
because of the fact that he's a real, one of the last liberals and fighters for causes,
and obviously he's not a liberal at all.
You know, it is just jumping right on the bad wagon to twist what we do on this show
and doesn't have a sense of humor either.
There's nothing vulgar about the Vatican rag, and there's nothing vulgar about the Pope's smoke's dope,
and there are all different kinds of ways of making the same point,
and nobody did a better job of satirizing the problems of the 60s,
and in fact, all the Tom Lear stuff that we got in Iraq here,
still is appropriate 25 years later.
Oh, okay.
And he did it with comedy and satire.
It's more, you don't have to sit and bore people to death and talk in monotone for hour after hour,
and talk about things that people don't care about, and beat him over the head,
because nobody's going to call and talk with you about it.
That's not what it's all about.
And now I'm stupid,
because I'm not going to continue doing what doesn't work.
It's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Incredible.
And I guess that maybe this market, just, I mean, the audience is obviously,
because they respond to it, but maybe the marketplace just isn't ready to handle the idea
that when you give people what they want and you evolve,
you know, life is an evolutionary process.
And so is broadcasting, and so is entertainment, and so is everything we do.
It changes, because people's tastes change, and people's attitudes change, and people's needs change.
And all this crap about bigotry and all this other garbage, you know,
just for this guy to fall into the same crap.
Incredible.
You know, he's turned into another art title bomb, I guess.
You know, let's blame the talk host, the bigot's, and so on, you know, unbelievable.
Because the truth hurts.
People don't want to hear the truth.
Maybe that's it.
Yeah, no, that is it.
And this is, this is like the crowning blow coming from this man.
But of course, it shouldn't be any different.
You know, Howard Kleinberg, does he take any shots now?
Another good friend.
And of course, you know, Howard, I guess, would excuse it by saying that I betrayed him
by betraying a confidence about his position on Casino gambling.
Well, how many years can you keep a confidence when a man who's the editor of a major newspaper in a city
refuses to have the courage to tell the people what his position really is?
But it's just astonishing to me, boy, all you got to do is become very successful
and have an audience of living and breathing people who enjoy what you're doing
and right away you're a bad guy.
I mean, this is just, this is blasphemy.
Oh, I know.
I mean, he's entitled to his opinion, but if Ed Cohen thinks that I would ever go back to the days
when I would bring him on the show and have people calling by the Gillian's...
Get him off!
Oh, it's terminal, it's boring.
And he would sit here trying to get everybody excited about 400 bills that were, you know,
being discussed in Tallahassee.
They don't care.
They don't care about it.
And I'm not commenting on whether that's right or that's wrong.
I think it's sad that they don't care, but I can't change that.
And I mean, this is a business.
That's the sad part of it.
So you see no matter what you do, you can't win.
If you do this kind of stuff and everybody's into a coma,
and you have nothing but 90-year-old people listening, then they say,
well, she, you know, talk shows nobody listens to that except a bunch of people in cemetery village.
Nobody listens to that who makes any difference.
Then if you go ahead and you do something that does get a large audience
and you get living and breathing people listening to AM radio again,
then all of a sudden, well, it's too controversial.
And the corporate are having an nervous breakdown and everybody, you know,
it's just you can't win in this market because this is an immature bush-league town that doesn't want to grow up.
Now, here's a guy like Howard Stern, okay?
And this show pales into its significance.
On our wildest days, we never come close to Howard on his famous days, okay?
In terms of the language, the humor, the sexual innuendo, anything.
Because contrary to what Ricky Tickie or anybody else would say,
this is not shock radio.
And here's a guy like that in New York.
And when the FCC back in April gave the ruling out,
they admitted that there were totaled like 69 letters in the file against Howard Stern.
And only a handful of them came from New York.
Most of them came from Philadelphia, again, from a group of hysterical Catholics.
But, and also, some of them came from that Donald Wildman who's in Tupelo, Mississippi,
who's never even heard Howard Stern.
And also, one was from a Tipper, some a letter that somebody sent to Tipper Gore,
that she sent to the FCC, and she's over there in Memphis or Nashville somewhere in Tennessee.
And in a city of 10, 15 million people, there's nobody organizing to get Howard Stern off the air.
Mm-hmm. They love him. They love him.
And those people who don't love him, don't listen to him.
They've got a million other stations just like they do in this market.
Well, now that's a revolutionary idea.
You mean if they don't like him, they don't listen to him?
Well, I realize it's very difficult because a lot of people here have mental palsy
and they can't turn the dial like Irving Shekman in North Bay Village.
Hi Irving.
And like Edward Cohen down there in Kendall, who thinks that I had to continue doing
what he thinks is exciting and interesting by putting the audience into a deep sleep.
That's exciting radio, Eddie.
And maybe this market, the whole market is just what 99% of what you hear on the air is.
It's just mong.
And maybe that's what the marketplace can bear here.
And how many days did I tell you Howard Stern would last if he were on the air here?
Ten tops.
Two. Of course, it's a mood point because nobody here would put him on the air in the first place.
Nope.
They know better.
They know?
No, it's not that they know better.
It's just that they don't have the balls to do it. That's all.
Because the FCC wouldn't rule on him any differently in Miami than they do in New York or Philadelphia
because they're all major allegedly, major metropolitan areas.
Alleged.
Well, we thought this was a world-class city.
Yeah, we thought.
Where the people can't make their own decisions as to what they're going to listen to.
They have to sit there like a dog being at the moon screaming so that the moon is going to go away.
And this is intolerable, really is unbelievable.
If Ed Cohen doesn't like what I'm doing on the air here now, he knows me personally.
He knows I'm not a bigot.
And he knows that I've bashed every religion under the sun equally.
I don't pick out any particular one.
Now the fact that Pope is coming and happens to be a Catholic, that's his problem.
But to me, organized religion, and I've said it for years, is garbage.
And that's my feeling about it.
And I have nothing but contempt for these for these shifters and hucksters who rip off the public.
And he knows that and I've always said that.
For 12 years.
Isn't it interesting, by the way, we don't do those shows anymore.
Because how many times can you make the same point?
I've said all it has to be said.
You've said that for years at night?
Yeah. And nobody got hysterical.
Well, they got hysterical, but the point is that he didn't get hysterical.
Not like this.
No.
And I wasn't a bigot.
Yeah, that word.
But now all of a sudden I'm a bigot.
And of course they love to seize upon that.
You know, there are a whole bunch of people now bigotry of this bigotry.
What bigotry?
Yeah.
Because I think the Pope is a jackass.
I'm entitled to that opinion.
And because I think he never met a Nazi, he didn't love.
I'm entitled to that opinion.
And I'm going to express that opinion.
And if it's not on this radio station, it'll be on another one.
It's just as simple as that.
It's not complicated.
I'm not going to miss any meals.
That's why I've stored up all of this, you bet.
Like a bear, you know, when he goes in hibernates in the world.
He has to store a little excess in case there may be a couple of lean days,
case hunting, it's bad.
Like in Windixi.
And all of that humor that we've done.
You know, I love this line, elementary school sexual and ex-graterian you window in jokes.
Ex-graterian you window.
What is this man talking about?
No, I do.
And to use the word bigotry.
I mean, here's a guy who turns out, and it is, you know, he's been around a few years,
who turns out to be another one of the old farts.
So if there's anybody else out there who writes a column like in the Homestead Journal,
or the Narendra Express, or the OGIS Daily, or whatever, you know,
any of these other great American publications, please, you know, get it out of your system.
I mean, it's like obligatory now that everybody's got to take some shot.
No, that's fine.
Okay, I take a lot of shots too, but I mean, when it's done by somebody who's allegedly a good friend,
and I gave this man more airtime than Carter's got pills to promote all of his causes
and anything and everything that he wanted, and now he turns.
He turns.
And this is the same guy, by the way, a few months ago, back in April,
when the FCC thing was going on, wrote a column, applauding, like campaign, and so far,
and so on.
But see, he's like, he's like a lugner over Channel 7, Mark Lundner, he can't make up his mind.
Notice, what would happen?
Yeah.
Well, you know, he's jumping onto bandwagon because it's not very popular.
Notice, yeah.
In the print media, especially, to go on the attack.
Oh, it's disgusting, and it's vulgar, and what, what are they talking about?
Can they be specific?
Of course not.
Is there anybody out there who writes these things, who's ever gone into Windixie,
and looked at one of the cashiers at the checkout line?
It's a joke.
This is real life.
This is what people think about.
These are real life experiences with humor.
That's all.
That's all we talk about.
1987.
This is what the real world is all about.
1987.
We're not advocating that anybody go out and rape anybody or attack minors,
or that the little kids go out and, you know, make babies.
You know, any of the things that are twisted and distorted and perverted
and turned upside down by people who want only ultimately to silence what they don't like.
And that's incredible to me.
I turn that cable man, you know, channel after channel.
I see all kinds of things that I can't believe are there that are, to me,
I wouldn't watch him if you paid me, and I just keep punching the button.
I don't sit there and call American cables.
I want that off.
I want Jimmy Swaggerdoff.
I want Jan and Paul off my screen.
I want Fadi by Solo Flex.
Well, I don't want that off my screen.
I want that on the screen.
John is here to see Glenn.
You have his tickets?
No.
Well, why is he coming back now?
Cart?
Two carts.
Two carts.
What is that all about?
I gotta go see what's going on out.
Something they're having hysterics out.
No, no, wait a minute.
There's no need for anybody to have hysterics.
If anybody has something that they want to drop off,
that's another thing that's going on here lately.
There's like a circus in here, you notice?
It's like a zoo.
Why can't they just relax if somebody wants to leave some stuff?
Fine.
To leave it at the desk.
We'll take care of it.
We have other things going on.
I know that's a surprise to some people.
We do have some other things going on.
Not really important, you know, like whether we come to work tomorrow
or, you know, little things like that.
Boy, and they're having kittens out there.
That's a new thing in this company.
Everybody's having babies.
Even the guys are having babies now.
Wait a little Jack, here's about this.
Yeah.
Oh, did you hear he called in?
Oh, yeah.
For the other guy.
I used to hear from him.
Now, again, the reason I put him on it,
and I'm delighted, his performance couldn't have been better
because I had 30 seconds to fill till the news.
And he thought I put him on.
And, you know, this child, I mean, here's a man
who really needs some serious help in my opinion.
And you saw the, I still have this,
a page here with the, you know, like the crayons,
like a little child.
There's a lot that paid, says a lot.
Exactly.
From an adult.
From an attorney no less.
Yeah.
Okay.
And the fact that anybody in this company
is responding to people like this,
some of whom are long in mental institutions,
it couldn't be clear.
Oh, yeah.
That right there, and the call.
Yeah.
You put them together, and what if you got,
but like a little, like about a five-year-old child.
And they're responding to this?
Yeah.
That's what's incredible.
And what about all the positive calls?
No, we just, well, you, just the people
who sent me copies of the mail,
I've got a whole waste basket full.
You know, I'm not going to save it,
because obviously the originals went to where they should have,
but dozens and dozens.
And of course, there's still all this,
what is all that mail?
Yeah.
Who knows?
Yeah.
No telling you always find things in the Pope mail.
Unbelievable.
See, that's what it's all about.
I always have to hear from him.
It's great.
And you know, if Ed Cohen thinks this show is garbage,
if it's stupid, fine, Eddie, don't listen to it.
You know, that's what the R&D is.
You know, life has got to be more than just being obsessed with,
and that's what bugs me about some people.
They're one-dimensional.
Like John Broward who got canned evidently over J&O.
You know, when it's kind of interesting,
the reason is for it, too, by the way,
which is nothing new to me.
But why did he get canned here?
Not because of me, but because he had two topics,
or three topics.
Communist and Nicaragua and Soviet propaganda and every day.
He's still seeing that.
He's still seeing that.
Obsessed, one-dimensional.
Yeah.
And there's nothing to be more boring and more pathetic
than one-dimensional people.
Mm-hmm.
And if you can't have a good laugh, boy,
and the kind of world that we live in today,
and especially under the, you know, like I said the other day,
when you work for other people,
your life isn't worth a dime.
It's not worth a dime.
Because your entire existence is hanging if they're whim.
And if they get up on the wrong side of bed one day,
or they get a complaint, and they decide that you're a bad guy,
or whatever it is, bingo.
You're out on the street.
Your life, you could be, you know,
you could be one of the street people.
And that's one of the reasons that this business is so bad.
And you worked for some real bad people,
and so of us, who don't have any kind of human feeling
for the people who work for them,
like we're just all cattle.
Mm-hmm.
And who have no interest in the fact that, you know,
you're a person, you're a human being with needs,
and with the feelings, and with emotions,
and with bills to pay, and with whatever else,
with the life that you've got to plan,
and with obligations,
and all these other things that every human being has got,
every adult,
and they couldn't give a damn less about that,
just like what happened at IOD,
and the way they just mercilessly screwed over a bunch of people.
And NWS, and evidently, who knows,
maybe now the same thing's going to happen here?
Who knows?
Exactly.
The only difference being that some of us
are not going to be out on the street.
True.
Just say the least.
To say the least.
To say the least.
Okay, 24 past one at WINZ.
Let's look at the crackle on the end of that.
They're everywhere, the cacklers.
Maybe it's like a new illness that we don't know about.
29 past one at WINZ,
and the Stan majors in the building,
so everything's all set for another four hours.
We're all squared away.
No problems.
Keep it very clean.
I'm going to talk about Haitians today.
Jamaicans and Behemians.
It's that bigotry polluting the airwaves.
Look at all that cheesecake.
Isn't that great from cheesecake and center?
Good Lord.
And the you know who over here is,
I think there was one whole box that disappeared on the field.
You ate really?
Wrong.
Wow.
Stan ate more than I did.
Wrong.
Have one of these.
Yeah, he had about six or seven of those.
I had one of those.
The whole table was covered with them.
There was one that was like,
We gave them to our boss, here.
Oh, yeah, right.
Charlotte and John.
There's only one thing that you'd like to give to the volunteers.
Hollywood, hello.
Hello.
Yes.
That me?
That's you.
Oh, finally.
I have a question I'd like to ask you.
Yes.
This is this jerk Thompson.
I mean, Jack Thompson.
I think you had to write the first time.
Who exactly is he?
He's just a chronic pain in the neck out there
and attorney and coral people.
And in the what?
Pain in the neck.
I would put it a little lower.
Okay, pain in the back.
Pain in the rump.
Pain in the ass would be more like it.
Like I said, a pain in the ass.
But you know, I'm 72 years old.
Well, so am I.
I was 44 when I came to work today, but now I'm 72.
I think those records are hilarious.
Well, almost everybody does.
You know, but Jack doesn't.
So therefore we can't play him.
This Jack ass is going to presume to say what I should listen to
and what I should not listen to.
Yeah, he and Dr. Hoeven Moth, they're going to be the censors for American.
They're going to decide what we can do and what we can't do.
And what we have to say to live up to our first amendment obligations.
Well, you know, I think they're both for the need of...
A straight jacket.
Yeah, no, an animal.
Well, maybe put him in a straight jacket for him to make him a good ant.
Maybe a coffee animal from Dean Donnick.
Maybe a coffee animal from Dean Donnick.
Right.
Well, they're monitoring you, ma'am.
I wish he would.
I wish he would.
Yeah.
I keep a load of 38.
Good.
Well, we'll send him right over.
I wish you would.
Okay.
Well, I hope everything turns out all right for you.
Well, I hope so.
And every day and I think you're great.
I'll be around. Thanks.
Okay.
Okay, I'll be somewhere.
Mm-hmm.
No doubt.
Yeah.
I have no doubts.
Oh, I have no doubts whatsoever.
Mm-hmm.
Miami, hello.
Neil?
Yes.
Hi.
Don't get so upset.
No, I'm not upset.
I'm very calm.
I know.
No problem at all doing, you know, as you're under these circumstances, it's great, you know.
I know.
But, you know, I've been saying ever since this started that it was the Miami Herald and the Catholic Church that was behind it.
Well, and you sure got two good components of it.
No question about that.
There was a gentleman that called earlier.
I was in the car running errands and I heard him saying that he had called Portland.
Yeah.
And that they had told him that the Archdiocese was back at it.
And it just made me believe it what I said.
Yeah, when the Archdiocese can't handle the truth, that's what really bugs them.
When, you know, especially now that there are so many things coming out that prove that what I've said for years is true, and they can't handle that.
So they want to be able to keep conning all the people out there and pretending that they're holier than now.
And they do anything in their power to get me off the air.
I know. And, you know, I've been thinking about this situation for a few days.
And to me, it is the equivalent of the T.T.L.
The way that this county and the state and the government is spending money for one man for a two-day visit.
Yeah.
When we have people that are hungry and...
Yeah, people are starving to death every day.
I would...
And here, there are millions of dollars being spent so this guy can parade around and go on a PR tour.
You know, that's terrific.
Right. And I was just downtown, uh, last week.
And I was parked on flyover street near the cultural center.
And I was shocked at what I saw.
There were people walking around with no shoes.
Just, uh, hungry. They look like they...
A good wind would blow them away. I saw one woman down there that evidently was a large soul.
And she had on a pair of men's shoes that was at least six sizes too big for her.
And we had people like this.
And I remember when the Camilla's had...
How bad for help.
Yeah.
And they said they didn't have any money in the budget.
Well, I remember when we raised about 20 grand for the Camilla's house in a Salvation Army on this program.
Right.
And I don't recall ever getting a letter from the Archdiocese.
I did get nice letters from Brother Paul at the Camilla's house and the other organization.
But I don't recall ever getting a letter from Archbishop McCarthy thanking us for the...
You know, our efforts on their behalf and for all the publicity that Mike Spinell and I gave to them.
I don't recall it. I must have missed the letter.
That's absolutely true.
And I don't recall any article in the voice either commending us for our efforts on the behalf of the needy.
No, that's true.
The only time you ever get anything written about you in the voice is when, you know, you tell the truth that they can't handle.
And they want to make you out to be a bigot.
Right. But, you know, when we have situations like this,
and they have all this money to spare all of a sudden.
And all the peace when I just turned on television last night,
they're going to have peace every 50 feet around Macquarie's house when the Pope stays there.
Terrific.
Now isn't that wonderful?
Well, maybe they ought to have Jack there to monitor what's going on inside.
Right. Well, you know, I think you and I should go down in front of his office
and I recorded, you know, the I-95 song.
And we could play it over the loudspeaker.
I have, you know, plugs into a cigarette lighter in my car.
And it goes about, oh, about six blocks.
You know, I just discovered something.
I'm looking at the letterhead of this letter that he brought in for me this morning, this Jack Thompson.
And the first three digits of his phone exchange at his office are 666.
Oh, boy.
I don't want to draw any conclusions, but what does that tell you?
I want to eat probably, you know, not a hard time getting that number.
Yeah.
Another thing I dropped off the tape for you this morning on some programs that was on television.
Oh, yeah, thank you. I've got it right here.
I want you to please, please, please, look at that tape.
Okay.
The only thing is we forgot to rewind it, but there was a program on television,
and we just saw a part of it, so we picked it up again, Sunday.
And you're mentioned there.
And there's a couple of other things.
I think you'll be very interested in the inside.
You're a terrorist, you know, going up and down, towers.
Oh, yeah. In my spare time, yeah.
I, but...
Well, I got some power tools, you know, I don't know what to do with them.
So I figured I might as well get some exercise, you know.
Your mic is what you, though.
Sure. And, you know, as Ed Cohen says, let me quote him again.
He says, I'm not suggesting that sabotaging towers
is the best way to get rid of these radio stations,
but is there a better suggestion?
Oh.
What a brilliant comment, man. It just takes a genius to write something like that.
That man died a long time ago, and he didn't know it.
Like a lot of people in this town.
I'm fine.
The man is a terminal born.
I don't know what happened to him, you know.
Here is a guy who was such a good friend, and you know,
as soon as the day came that I wasn't going to bore the audience
with his BS anymore, all of a sudden, I'm a bigot.
Right. Well, let me tell you,
when he came on your program, a lot of people turned it off.
Oh, trust me.
He's boring.
But anyway, I wish you all the best of luck,
and I hope everything works out fine now.
Okay, thanks a lot.
It does.
Okay. Hollywood, hello.
Yes, Neil.
Yes.
A strange thing happened to me this morning.
I called up information in the phone company.
Yeah.
And I got, I asked for Mr. John B. Thompson's numbering call gables,
and Jack answered it.
And I told him, oh my god, look, we're monitoring you.
And he goes, oh yeah, he goes, well, come on down here.
If the man is a paranoid, if he gets a phone.
Oh, he's the man is not even a fruitcake.
I mean, he no question about it.
I could tell if the food was going to be on the phone.
And that's not an inflammatory statement or an attack.
No, I know he declared by his behavior.
I don't know about everybody, but, you know,
it's public knowledge.
Yeah.
And they can find out just by calling, you know, Mr. John B. Thompson.
Yeah, he needs some serious help this guy.
I don't know what his story is, but he needs some serious help.
He's a get hit in the head with a thumb gun or something, you know.
I don't know what's going on.
I think that's what happened.
You know, oh, another thing.
Well, I'll be there on Sunday at noon at the rally.
Yeah, we're going to have one.
Oh, what's the missing Gilbert thing going to be there tomorrow?
I have no idea.
Oh, will he be there during your show or something?
You know, because, you know, we could have our, I mean,
there are layabouts that, you know, we can just show up anyways.
Oh, no.
Well, that would, you see, I appreciate your support
and everybody in the audience, but what you don't understand
is you're dealing with a mentality that you've probably never even encountered before.
Don't confuse the army.
Well, okay, don't confuse this man with the facts
or with the ratings or with the audience or with reality.
I mean, you know, in his own mind and in this company's mind,
they've convinced themselves of what their image is that they want to be
and that there are half a dozen misfits out there who are upset.
And that's all they need to trigger them off into a, you know,
hysterical, whatever it is that they're doing to justify their own paranoia.
I will have Bob last to decide there.
Yeah, exactly.
Okay, well, just keep it up and we all love you and we're all gone.
I'm going to be there Sunday at noon, Sunday at noon.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.
All right, back.
North Miami Beach, hello.
Yes, I'm a family.
If W-I-N-C wants family, I'm family.
However, I'm willing to start with a thousand dollar donation
for all listeners who's right to hear what we want to hear.
We must stop them.
Let's get a good lawyer and our freedom of listening
and censorship must be stopped.
We have to name the hells, McCarthy, Thompson, these nuts up in Hollywood,
their minister, the son that is a lawyer.
Come on, people, let's get going.
Let's get a defense fund for our right to hear what we want to listen to.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you. Miami, hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hill.
Yeah.
Are you reading from my paper just a little while ago?
What paper was that?
Oh, well, where were you reading from?
You mean the West Kendall Gazette?
Yes.
Oh, that's your paper?
That's my paper.
Well, congratulations to you, sir.
Yes, and I just want you to know that I disagree totally with what Ed Cohen had to say in that publication.
Okay.
But I certainly...
Well, I'm not attacking the West Kendall Gazette because it's not one of these.
You know, one of the great publications in America, but at the same time,
Ed has written positive things in the past, which he's entitled to.
And he's also entitled to write this.
It just comes to the fact that he and I allegedly were personal friends for many years.
I mean, we didn't go out to dinner together, anything like that.
But certainly from a professional standpoint.
And I think even beyond that, I thought we were good friends.
And now he turns around with it.
Well, not even contacting me or anything.
And ceases upon the, you know, timeliness since everybody else is on the bandwagon
of labeling this program as something that it is not.
And he knows better.
He knows better.
My point is, you know, it'd be just as wrong for me because I disagree with what he wrote this week
to not put it in the paper.
Oh, I agree with you.
I'm not saying that it shouldn't have been there.
I'm just reacting to what he wrote.
And that Yo-Yo next to you, you know, who says nobody reads the paper, you know,
we happen to think we put out a pretty good newspaper and pretty informative newspaper
and not just a rag that is...
Is that what he said?
He said, I've a helicopter put out a new stand.
Did he call it a rag?
No, he didn't call it a rag.
Okay.
I didn't think he said that.
No, he didn't.
Anyway.
But the dolphin's going to win tonight.
I sure hope so.
Yeah.
Me too.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, everybody's getting very emotional now.
You know what I said?
Very emotional.
It's all due to that big, Bob Lasseter's sigh.
Next caller is on a mobile phone.
Hello.
Hello, Neil. How are you?
Okay.
That's good.
Listen, Neil, you know, when I started listening to you, it was because of the kind of humor
and you're kind of humor that you brought to the airways.
And the more I listened, the more I liked it, I liked everything that you did.
You know what I mean?
I think it's time that you should get some more tingle calls because it's the truth.
That's why we listen.
And the rating showed it.
And when Lisa Ballet said, well, it was her first book, but let's see what happens next time.
And when Alice said, well, I'm never going to leave the morning hour.
This is my time, Flood.
Well, what's happened all of a sudden?
Everyone's gone.
You're still here.
And now,
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I'm still here today.
Yeah, I mean.
That's what I mean today.
And they want to pull the reins in on you.
And that's not why I listen.
And I hope they're listening so they can hear me.
Yeah, well, I want to say something to you.
And I really mean this as sincerely as anything I have ever said.
And again, I'm getting it second-hand, but I have no reason to doubt the truthfulness of the caller,
the one that called about two hours ago, to quarter to 12, who talked about his 45-minute conversation
with Bob Gilbertson up in Portland on Friday.
And if Bob Gilbertson has taken the liberty of discussing any kind of contractual situation
about tearing up the kind, releasing me from my contract, or anything along those lines,
to me, that is the most unethical and the lowest kind of skull-duggery I can imagine.
That's not the kind of thing that you discuss with people who are calling to express a point of view.
I mean, people are entitled to call and say, hey, get them off the air or we love them or in between.
Whatever they want. That's fine.
And he can respond, you know, within reason.
But to be discussing those things with callers to me indicates that there's something here
that's just absolutely intolerable.
Well, if that was me, and they did that to me, I wouldn't stand for it.
I simply wouldn't stand for it. If that's all that they think about you, you know what I mean?
It's disgusting. It just makes my stomach sick, and I'm serious.
Because you started this, and now everybody else is trying to do something.
Alice talks about fantasy shows. The stuff I heard on that line there, you couldn't do.
Do they talk about that? A little potato is over there, talks about his fantasies,
and everybody has sexual innuendos. So what? So what?
It's a shame to say it. I mean, I almost wish you could tear up your contract,
and let someone pick you up who you deserve. I just pray it's in Miami.
Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Hollywood, hello.
Hello, Neil. I've been waiting such a long time, but it's worth it.
Okay.
Well, honey, I've been listening to you for years, two numbers to mention,
and I must say that you're so knowledgeable, so informative,
that I wouldn't change you for any other radio station.
In fact, I've been listening to appointments because I waited to the last minute
to your finish to shut off the radio, so I hope you'll continue.
That's what I'm looking forward to, but I wanted just one thing darling,
and I hope the gentleman that's with you, I think his name is Glenn,
that he won't mind not to giggle when you're talking or when a crawler comes in,
because that's a little nerve wracking. Okay.
But outside of that, everything is 100 percent, and I'm looking forward to listening to you again and again and again.
Okay, thank you. Good luck, Tiani. Bye-bye.
145 at WI and Z. We'll take our last break. We do have another one now, right?
Okay, just checking and we'll come right back.
Okay, now just to condense what you just told me,
the attorney who has been harassing this program,
and he talks about exercising his rights,
there are no constitutional rights to harass,
and he's been doing it on the phone and he's writing stuff in like this,
like a little child, and the fact that he would even put this on paper,
and where was the envelope for there?
Or the crayon, like crayon? I mean, the man has got serious problems,
but his name is John B. Thompson,
attorney at law and Coral Gables.
They B as in bothersome, not to be confused with any other John or Jack Thompson's in the Gables,
who may be attorneys. John B. Thompson, Coral Gables.
And again, as I said, if you think of the Antichrist,
that you give you an idea as to the first three digits of his telephone number.
Okay, so, and I'm not encouraging anybody to call or do any,
you know, I don't want to, we're going to get the same thing we did with Valdez
that we're doing verbal terrorism. I haven't encouraged anybody to contact him in any way,
shape or form, have I? No way, Jose.
So, we're still running, by the way, with Marlon Suki from the eighth race at Calder yesterday.
Now, are you going to be on your best behavior today? He's got a very,
he's got like a howdy-duty grin on his face.
He looked almost like John Anderson for just a second there.
I don't know. How do you like this ed Cohen? Can you believe this?
Can you believe this? My good pal. I remember him.
Leave my nail alone.
Yeah, now he's starting to finger through your may. Yeah, he can't wait.
Wait a minute. Did you get a letter from Mary Lou in Hylia? Is that who that is?
Wait a minute. Go back to that one there. I just saw the handwriting. Is that who it is?
Of course. Well, I know Erie believed me. I know the voices. I know the handwriting.
There's something says priority mail. I look at Erie's got one from the youth center.
Oh, the yacht center. Okay. Shame on you. Shame on you.
And for those who missed the earlier part of the program, I think Mr. Thompson does have a point.
All of this encouraging of homosexuality and heterosexuality and bisexuality must stop no more sex in South Florida.
And wasn't it Neil Rogers who predicted not too many years ago that that would be the next thing to be banned in South Florida?
Now in 1989, we're going to work on breathing the air that will be the next thing that will be banned.
And of course, not a big deal in this town because most of the people are walking dead anyway.
They don't need to breathe the air.
What is that? More dirty pictures of young ladies in lingerie? It's out. No more of that decadence and depravity.
But that's a macy's kind of. Well, I don't care what it is. No more of that. No more of these scantily clad ladies with their boobs hanging out.
Wow. Next caller on a pay phone. Hello.
Oh my God. I've been on for an hour and ten minutes on the pay phone. I pay phone. I called you.
I was on 45 minutes and finally you dumped me a two car. Sorry.
The information is very important. I'm sorry with my terrible voice.
I'm like, my mother can't be man number one. I saw the article about it.
Cones. Yeah. And I was started immediately with a letter when it comes out. I'll send you copy. Shame on him.
Shame on him is right. terrible. Number two. You called John Broward.
But did you find out who's replacing John Broward? No, I didn't call her. I called JNO.
I know who's replacing John Broward. Mike Miller. Yeah. It was in the paper Sunday.
Oh, I didn't see it. I thought you noticed it. No, I knew Mike Miller was going there, but I thought he was going to do afternoon.
I mean, John Broward's only been doing full time. They're like, what a month. I mean, he just started.
Then there's some more information. I called Maine Friday. Oh boy. Now I called twice. I called today. But please hear me out. I talked that.
Okay. I want to get on before you get off the air. I called Maine. The first thing the girl says to me, is this a combined?
And I said, let me tell you something. Although New's callers are younger people, they're asking some older people to do listen and do respond.
Do enjoy it. Anyway, I finally got through to someone in the office. I wouldn't speak to her at all.
And they finally listened to my name and number and said, right, right, we take care of it. And they're being the usual phone calls in your favor.
Number one, number two, I call the attorney this morning. John Thomas Thompson, whatever.
Yeah, mm-hmm. Right. The man says to me, I have a deep voice. He said, you guys, you get off the phone. You're a guy. I swear to God.
Oh boy. So I got some there. I called Maine again. Does that give you an indication of where this is coming from?
And people are listening to an unbalanced individual like this? Let me tell you, I called Maine again. I was tomatoes.
And I said, let me tell you something. I'm going to get in trouble. I said, Mr. Thompson's nurse.
I said, I really, you can check out. I said, he's an attorney, but he has some psychological problems.
He's giving us some problems. And he's called you numerous times. He says, oh, yes. He says, you just can't imagine how many cold letters we've gotten. And I said, please.
Well, wait a minute. How many letters they've gotten from him? I guess so. Oh boy. I said, please take my advice. And just don't respond. The more you respond, the more he's going to call. The more he's going to write.
Yeah. Thank you for listening to that, hunger. I'm glad I got through it because I had to let you know what happened. Well, I'm glad we're, you know, we have to be like inspector Clousseau here. You know, we have to piece together all the evidence because it's a really bizarre puzzle.
I know. It's a terrible situation. Yeah. Well, it's great to be able to do that.
Okay. Thanks a lot for a lot of deal. Hello. Hello, Mr. Roger. Yes. Okay. I'm one of your younger listeners who enjoyed you very much. Are you familiar with both pair? Yes. He was the one who said, I may disagree with what you say, but I'll defend my death. You're right to say it. Right.
And I agree with him. I'm a Catholic and most my parents are Cuban, but I enjoy your show. I'm an American. I was born here and I just wanted to let you know that some of us who may not agree with what you say want you to still be on the air. Thank you. Okay. Well, I hope you let the art stiacies know that too. And you know, I've suggested for a long time. And unfortunately, there are a lot of cowards out there, but that on Sunday when they passed the collection played around in the Catholic churches that a lot of people who are displeased with their
attempt at censorship would put a note instead of a bill. Of course. In the in the plate and say when you stop censoring Neil Rogers and anybody else on the air, then we'll start, you know, donating again. You know, they also do a lot of good to people. Yeah.
So it's just that some of these big rigs were in the uproar. I'm just forgotten what it's like to be people. Yeah.
You can be a real need for the rest of us. Okay. I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Stay on the air. Okay. Why are you showing me all of those dirty pictures from the Macy's catalog?
Is that Macy's or is that a different one? Macy's Macy's shame on you. He's back at it again. You know, I want to make it the Spiegel catalog and then it's the Sears catalog. And this week, it's Macy's the Chocky Shorts.
Shameful. That's what I wear disgraceful. I think the Gilbert's in his right.
Enough of this depravity and sickness with people in underwear.
And priests and dresses. I got a better one than that. I'm going to show you that I've already thrown away.
By the way, I think I'll hear confessions this afternoon. Confessions. Yeah.
There you go.
Say Miami Beach policeman. Really? Yeah. Which is why I'm throwing it away. I'm sure that he would be. What does it say on the back? Good looking guy from one of your liberal fans. Yeah. Well, it's no big deal.
We don't want to say what it is in the picture because somebody will get very upset again. More calls. I like your album here. Yeah, I'm going to. It's too long to put on cards. I'm going to have to put it on a cassette.
And it'll be interesting to see which day I choose to play that maybe tomorrow would be a good day. I'm not so sure if I'm going to be on tomorrow or not because we have these big corporate meetings and you know, it could be very. You think what? I think you'll be here. In fact, if you would like, I will come in at 10 o'clock to do what? We'll just do two man show tomorrow.
Will that make you happy? And you get depressed. I'll just say something a little under pressure.
You don't like that idea. Great idea. But you can never come in at 10 o'clock on your show. You can't do it on my whole show with me. Oh, that's true. Yeah, you owe me and I owe you. And I thought tomorrow the not attorney.
Here's a message from Richard. The not attorney is forwarding his call. She's put him on call forwarding to us. Is that cute?
I mean, isn't this guy really has got serious problem? Yes, he does. And it's a not the. And of course, what is it that we're doing about it? See, when you start using the phone to harass, which he's been doing even going back to Friday.
He was doing it and calling in the office and just making a nuisance call the phone. No, you see, I'd like to know what this company is doing about that. I mentioned that to our general manager this morning. You know, you just roll over and play dead, especially for some nutcase.
You're finished. I mean, forget about Bob Gilbert's or any of the other discussion we have to have, but when there's somebody who's just totally disrupting no, our attorney should be on the phone to him. Exactly.
Exactly.
Seasons to assist. Exactly.
Yeah. That makes sense because it's it's you know, if he'd call if he had called one time or even a couple of times.
Yeah, that would be it. But now it's haunting mocking calls and this kind of juvenile stuff in the mail and with all the, you know, with threats and with foolishness.
And as the lawyer again, you know, if he claims he claims he's a lawyer, he is a lawyer. The only thing a lawyer understands is another lawyer. Yeah.
Or the lawsuit. Yeah. So that you're right. But I'll come in at 10 o'clock tomorrow. Great. Oh, that's good. Okay. And maybe I'll be here for part of it and the beyond for part and call back and don't do that.
Just because I play on the year. No, I'm just saying I might have to be on a here part of the time. And now I'll come back, give you play by play and we'll play old angzine.
And all that other good stuff. Who knows what's going to happen, you know, but as we have discussed, I don't think I'm going to miss too many meals.
Okay, we're out of time here on a Monday. And again, you know, Friday, Saturday, Monday. This is three shows wasted from my standpoint. Just totally wasted with a lot of garbage, with a lot of mong.
I had a lot of fun Saturday go playing the cart right. Before it's taken out here. Yeah. Well, you better play him quick today.
Today is definitely the day. If you got any left that you can get in on Saturday, I would do it today because after a trip to Oklahoma City, you know who will probably be even more right wing than usual, you know, coming from Oklahoma City.
And after he looks at the books over in that place, it's really going to be exciting. Okay. That's going to do it. Have a wonderful day in a wonderful life. And don't forget if I don't show up here, all my radio friends just called Tom jick at the mommy news, Linda Thornton at the Harold. And don't call us. We'll call you.
