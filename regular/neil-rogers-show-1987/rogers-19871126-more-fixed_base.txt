Oh, he didn't.
Just two or three cabooses.
Ha, ha, ha.
Listen to this.
I remember your radio station WKAT.
Very vaguely, yeah.
Well, if you have, I...
Like the audience, very vaguely.
They're going to work as it starts selling time.
Oh, no.
What do you mean by that brokering time?
You know, like, airtime.
Oh, there's Oozzy.
That was my Oozzy.
I met the dog town.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you talking about?
They're going to start selling airtime.
I don't know.
They're going to sell time like WBCG.
In other words, broker time is what I said.
And you just kind of like, uh, ignored me.
In other words, you can buy half hour.
Exactly.
In other words, you can buy an hour, a couple of hours.
Maybe I'll buy some time on air.
Yeah.
No, I want to be on a station that somebody can hear.
I also, also, that means they're getting rid of King.
King?
Barry King?
Not the dog, the show.
Well, same difference.
Show is a dog.
OK, I wanted to tell you what's happening at Iodong.
Yeah.
Not a secret anymore.
OK.
Jim Frank, there a news anchor in the morning.
Yeah.
Leaving for Chicago.
Well, that's where he came from.
Well, that's where he's going back to work.
Good luck to Jim.
They really screwed him over.
Good over there too.
Dr. Ben Dover.
Yeah.
OK.
Bill McWake is going to do afternoon news.
So somebody's going to be doing in the two.
Couldn't be somebody we know who's out of a job.
Put it.
Maybe the dingo.
Go ahead.
We're waiting.
What jingle?
And major.
No, not Sam.
Major.
He's not going over there.
Well, I know that they wouldn't have offered him anything.
And I was, that let me tell you, have my kids an idiot if I ever,
if I ever knew an idiot.
Gee, did you just discover that?
Did you just finally discover that?
No, I called them up yesterday.
I don't want to speak to him unless he knows I'm being fired.
Oh, I can't wait for that day.
Well, hopefully that hopefully Gary will get some sense of that.
I want to hear that called personally.
Yeah.
And the last thing is with the thank God.
Is what?
The stand.
What about Stan?
He's going.
Is he going to stay at wind?
I'll let you know tomorrow.
OK.
I want to tell you we're talking about.
How long can this call go on with such term or teed even all this dead air?
And these long pauses.
Don't you understand?
This is a major market morning show.
OK, there he goes.
23.07 on Zeta 4.
We apologize for that last call from our somewhat zonked out Kendall correspondent.
Next time we know, we'll redeem himself and do a much better job.
Somebody told me that somebody was buying K18.
Could you hear that?
That I can hear that.
The company that I'm doing.
I'm doing taking Jerry Wichner lessons or something.
The company that I'm like you're in a coma.
The company that I'm in love 94 is thinking of buying it.
You know, if you look at their numbers, by the way, I hate to do that because I sound like somebody who called in the early part of the show.
Well, they've got like all teeny-boppers, man.
That's it.
All those kids that are hooked on that scratch crap.
It's always been that way over there.
And powerless 96.
If you took away their teenagers, they'd be off the air.
Oh, no, that's true.
That's very true.
They do phenomenal in teams, but that's it.
That's why I heard that Tanner does phenomenal in teams.
Okay, we're going to go to Sunrise.
Hello, Sunrise.
Hey, good morning.
How are you doing now?
Hello, Sunrise.
How's my name is Igorov.
And I'm using all every one he was.
I hear you, Roger Swoosh.
They're nice to me.
They're there, they're just to me.
There's just one problem.
They don't show rest to me.
I am very happy living in this factory.
And it's all because of the new round just for you.
It's the new round just for you.
Oh, I think somebody kind of hold a figure over there for just a second, don't you?
Yeah, nice note.
He hit there.
I think he had another moving experience by the Fending Machine.
Okay, figure out certainly a pleasure to hear from you.
Sure.
That was tight.
Wasn't it me?
I could have dubbed this.
You must have been God's ear.
I want a grub, blah, blah, blah.
I want to help the country's in the war against the Sander Niestas.
Because I don't want the coming, so I'll back the war.
We're just bypassed Congress.
We're just there's some missiles to Iran.
We'll say it's all point dexter's plan.
Alley North was a hero.
He is IQ is zero.
Did what he was told with those weapons he sold for the rainy and gold.
Everybody.
On me, come right with.
Come, love, love, love.
And on the eye, yeah, to life.
Let's reflect those tankers.
Can come in and can't go.
So on his lip, boy, you'll know that he's been for a decade.
But you know he deserves it.
That talented Greek cause his girlfriend's a thief.
We're just there's some time.
On the eye, yeah, to life.
To life.
You can work with.
Okay, there he goes from the Martin Bourbon School of Personality.
709 on Zeta 4.
And I'm not going to get into a big thing about Reagan.
You know, these people this morning.
Bye-bye.
She was nice, wasn't she?
She was very nice.
So a child.
Did he play Alice, Blue Gown?
I think so.
No, that was the previous week when he was doing his famous cross dressing.
Oh, boy, that was a show.
Yeah.
In fact, he was running around.
Remember in in class where Roblo was dressed up like Jesus.
And he was carrying that big cross.
Oh, it's a lot of joy.
Yeah.
And that's exactly what Alice did.
He had the glass lippers and a big cross.
And that was it.
And it was disgusting.
Okay, 26 before eight on Zeta 4.
And I am going to be so delighted when we get that exercise in whatever you call it.
What do you want to call it?
Exercise in ratings building over there.
See, because the people who are listening, they couldn't give a damn less about who wins the tickets.
Or about Bono Hussein or whatever the name is.
And you know, that's, see, the problem is that people cater to a small group of selfish phone callers.
So you want to say, I've never done that.
No.
And it's not necessary.
No, I'm more interested in the masses out there.
Right.
So why are you giving this away just to be a good guy?
You think we ought to change our mind?
Well, that would be some people upset, huh?
You just trying to be a good guy, right?
You're going to get them foaming at the mouth.
You know that people would love to have these tickets.
Okay.
Now ordinarily, if this our ladies' gentleman used to be Mr. Sports would do the sports.
And then they took him to Cleveland.
They started doing IDs.
And then I started doing the sports and I got tired of it.
I got sick of it.
And I said, nobody cares about these stupid scores.
And so that's it.
If you want the sports, call it.
