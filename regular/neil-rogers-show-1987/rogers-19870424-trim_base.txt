thanks
what do you from standards and practices now is out here in here for
i'm all for this new
i was not prepared for his crudeness his violence no sooner had half-character
locked the door behind in the national expression on his face which i can
face i did not like
gone was the hot pleading boy of only eleven minutes earlier instead there was a
contorted face of a man with rape on his mind
roughly he grabbed me oh dear i thought we really has it come to this
i asked myself echoing james mason as he played the emperor in the
terrence young remake of my maryling a film that has i gather
delighted hundreds of long distance jet travelers amongst them my run
baby i gotta have it and i gotta have it now
please i was originally pushing it is hard chest which would jammed against my
maiden form bra stuffed with latex
but his only response was to slam his hornets nest considerably enlarged against
my crotch
i struggled he held my arms close to my side he was very strong i noted for one
week but delicious moment as i inhaled the clean sweat of his body i weighed the
pros and cons of surrender
but when his really lips began to ravish my ear and i realized that my wig might
fall off i wrenched free of him come here he commanded no no i flooded away i'm
saving myself for mr right honey i'm mr right he started toward me and i'm in
his figure but i don't know you i mean let's not hurry this darling this is our
first real date petting yes but not he grabbed at me i leaped behind the bed
keating he swore come here bitch darling no please i want you to respect me to my
joy that i realized that vocally i had for the first time achieved the dark
throaty margarit Sullivan quality transfixed by the sound of my own magical
voice i fear i let down my guard half chariky dove across the bed and tackled
me yes tackled my rubb wrecking ridge agadas true but also a woman tender and
frail i was stunned by his force horrified by his brutality saddened that he
didn't respect me for a confused moment he held me opinioned in his arms my
back pressed against the radiator which left me i just noticed with a black and
blue derriere i looked up saw a satanic smile i'm going to burger you bitch
those carbon voyage lips were like a satyrs no like a carnivore's
don't please without difficulty i summoned a tear to my eye after all margarit
Sullivan's voice was coming from me you white bitches are all alike
rinquist teasers i was being used by the adjective it was not me he wanted
beautiful and vulnerable as i am know it was a white woman that he wanted to
humiliate he wanted to avenge wounded knee in my body at that instant i fear the
lad lost my sympathy if not my interest as he started to rip at my dress i gave
him my special giant moth karate blow to the belly he doubled up unable to breathe
then a well-earned twist and push coordinating right shoulder with left leg dropped
him to the floor with the crash before he knew i've hit him i was seated on the
small of his back with his left arm twisted behind him so that the slightest
pressure of my forefinger on his wrist would cause the most excruciating pain
christie grunted what the burger do you think you're doing protecting myself
from rape darling rape keating he snarled onto the floor still unbroken you
wanted you know you wanted not perhaps in the way you think
delicately i pressed my forefinger on his wrist and was rewarded with the
help stop that only if you promise to be a good boy what are you some kind of a
freak a lady wrestler or something he looked at me over his shoulder for the time i
detected the beginning of fear but i had have no desire to hurt him i want only
to rebuild him in my own image i also knew that if i were to frighten him too much
you would never return foolish goose i gave him a sweet smile i just learned a few
little tricks to keep from being all must up by purse natures and by rapists
but you wanted my ray you know you do come on let me up and i'll show you a good
time that i'd like to see darling but i think you better cool off a bit i made
myself comfortable on his firm rubbery buttocks he looked remarkably appealing
with his head twisted around so they could see me like the new moon over his left
shoulder the straight black hair all tounseled i noticed that in our scuffly it
lost his moccasins one associate of thought led to another you called me a white
bitch well you are i mean your white pressure no greater than a feather's fall
on his wrist don't he ill say you're sorry for calling me a bitch darling i'm sorry
that's a good boy you hate white people don't you know hell i'm half white
let's see which half he stared at me blankly with my right hand i took his
ankle and bent his leg back so that the large square foot in its dingy white sock
was almost level with my eyes i peeled off the damp sock
what are you doing he tried to straighten his leg but pressure on the wrist made him
change his mind he groaned then shuttered as i examined the calloused all-appointed
soul of his foot looking to see what color you really are dark he's have pink
souls i ate no nigger he muttered no but the bottom of your foot is lighter than
the rest you're definitely too toned darling
can imagine if taffy's listening this was quite true he was not literally a red
skin more light brown with yellowish tint so i noticed that the hairs on his ankle
were sparse black and fine come on he said and veris as i playfully tickled his
toes let me up let's call it a day i'm sorry what i did
i was now tickling the other foot and he began to shut her hey stop i'm ticklish
i stopped let's see if you're too toned everywhere i reached under him and got his belt
buckle in my hand he tried to roll away from me this time i gave him sufficient pressure to make
him scream darling there must be no secrets between us i changed my position sat on his shoulder blades
you're breaking my arm he wind i was also pushing his jeans down to his knees with my foot
he wore no underwear the smooth coppery buttocks glistened sweatily in the bright clear of the single
overhead Mazda well well i said significantly well well what he squeaked nervously clenching his
buttocks tight together i ran my hand lightly over the silky moist surface it was like hard good
year rubber tire relaxed darling my hand was at the juncture of buttocks and legs a dark
velvety maltees cross that marked the spot as it wore the center of the male the sacred black man
i i am relaxed listen i better get going i gave his bottom a little smack open for myra
pressure on the wrist a cry the buttocks went slack i pushed at the maiden jingle jiggle
my glancel come in here if we say jingle although at present his musculature is typically masculine i
could see how once his male organs are removed and his system fortified with female hormones the
broad pelvic region would be truly ravishing absence of unsightly hairs on his back except for
a single black tuffed at the beginning of the anus is also a definite plus looking down at what
will soon be a woman superb thighs i couldn't help but think how one day some man know a host of
men will be forever in my debt when they hold in their arms the luscious woman's body of half
Cherokee my creation but i still have my work cut out for me spread your legs wide darling
keating he moaned little bade there on the floor vulnerable yet somehow impressive were his
large black hairless powels what a nice be i too to oh oh one one this is nea rogers if you
thought as i did at westbroward was a wasteland for finally just think of all the billions of little
half Cherokee swimming around in there waiting to get out not now they aren't i had broken him
come on let me up but maybe i've changed my mind i teased and maybe i want it now i don't think i
can he said some stud anyway you need relief darling all rapists do i got off him suddenly
stand up darling where are we he got to his feet he looked frightened and angry as what would be
rapist would not with his trousers about his ankles and assured hiked up to his armpits
you can relieve yourself darling i said poignant to his dark long renquist which curved in a
brook line over the loose hanging powels he was not circumcised there was also pleased to
note that except for a silky black mustache at the base of the renquist his front was his hairless
is the back i was particularly satisfied by the nipples they are small brown and for a male
unusually protuberant almost a quarter inch in length when excited i know for i proceeded to
tickle him as he stood there dumbly unable to believe what was happening to him there's many a
girl who would love to have father hills like yours i ain't got father hills he said i slapped
the hard flat pectoral muscle with my hand but darling you do have beautiful exciting excitable nipples
as i played with him i studied the veins near his armpit trying to recall which is the one that i'll
take the silicone to i must get the old anatomy book out and do my homework from myron by
gorb it all the next few paragraphs i will not read because we still want the license
herison is upset that i'm telling everybody what he did was wife last night
oh his wife was the old half-chararchy the one that he picked up at bingo at the seminal
indian reservation right well she looks ravaging now let's see be leaving for the brick oven in
twenty minutes they're calling for me or call four seven six seventy seven twenty five for
reservations mentioned w i n z they'll have a bulletin car what the hell is that all about i can't
believe that here is a letter and by the way thanks for all the nice letters in the midst of all
of this male two niels send out your so far petitions immediately the halendale digest not only
supports you in this ludicrous censorship issue but will be happy to assist your petition drive
hopefully you'll receive support from other print media not all south florida publications are
out of touch with reality this is a serious matter that must be addressed immediately dan blustin
vice president helendale digest ps if the fcc censors the term old bags helendale will cease to exist
how do you like that for being frank and up front he's really impressed me that that yeah
the halendale digest is pretty good you notice in dollars and he doesn't read it yeah well there you go
well he doesn't have an IQ to read anything you know he's still working on a weekly reader okay let's
pick up where we left off i think this gets to the good part with cnn and also with larry king i think
now come on let's stop with all these interviews already i did a post conference for you guys
yesterday the big story what's your problem this story isn't same as the guy before i mean you
got to find out what you can do today did you guys heard what i'm going to do to digest it a whole
show we'll find out what you can't tell though is you spent the whole show talking about the fcc and
we don't know when you're to revert your usual sex and f8 go wait a minute you guys you guys
you guys stop because i'm going to tell you something this is why cnn and particularly such
because you guys i've gotten a million of things of me on tape and you go ahead you wake your own
damn story anyway if you got you were ready to listen or they show no you're not that's too often
often the cruise listen to your show in the radio okay you know that 90 percent of the time we're
not sitting and talking about sex we're sitting and talking about the news we're sitting and talking
about what's going on in the world we're talking about AIDS we're talking about I agree you do
that a lot too but i mean a lot of sex and that's next stuff i mean you're not usually talking about
the fcc for hours yeah whatever's on our mind and nine times out of ten and sex
i'm not you know that you're not a guy you don't know what it's like to have these kind of
genitals there's hormones surging through your body yeah but anyway i mean it's just
we don't sit around just dwelling on six for six sake it's about a man's psyche we're talking
what do you know i'm going to say the word penis on here okay pants there you got it i didn't change
i mean what do you want for me what do you want me to do now now you guys want me to use the
effort just run a tape of the radio i have a couple questions really i just have in my crew in here to
ask them uh what i'm not interested in what you think of the definition the new definition
the new definition of what's in decent i mean the definition is scenes pretty broad i think
hacking a girl's arms off um tapping her arms off leaving her by the side of the road to die
then going to prison for for only eight years and coming out is obscene that's what i think is obscene
but if you look at the i don't know you want to plot it i'm looking at it you're not a buying
this one if you look at the new definition now i mean it's a really wide definition look at this
you're going to read it what is the new definition uh what's in decent be language or material that
depicts uh in terms patently offensive is measured by contemporary community standards
sexual or ex-scritory activities or organs and that's a lot ratter it covers a lot more things than
the second-degree words man i don't know doesn't make any sense to me like uh it's
that constitutional that's what i want to ask you on camera oh camera i said i don't want to do all
and camera stuff but no you don't have to there's a miracle how are we going to take your right now
this isn't right but at least i'm talking right i mean you got some information and stuff i
don't really i don't look that good today the headphones have messed up my hair i have no makeup i
didn't shave i mean i'm going to rob but i do not look my best today no i look better and i'm not
wearing a shirt with a collar so my neck will feel thin and my arms apple sticking out
mmm yeah i'm going to decline but i end by the way believe anybody wants to see it in any way
what's the point because you're just playing a television you know she has to go back to you know
me howard you have to go back from the simple what you're gonna get in trouble yes i go
say nice it's bad for you i'm trying to make you feel guilty
you're not going to fire you because you're like you know you're like one of their good reporters
okay now give me a break i got to do my job too you know
you've never been very supportive either yeah you guys you guys do real crop stories on me
how are you going to root over clothes at these people yeah you're going to take 10 seconds or
whatever i say and chop it up and say yes howardster look at you i mean the basic attitude
are you done set yeah and i know you really should sort of the wrong thing these people have labeled
you this way it's their fault yeah it's her mess right we want to interview someone about
sex hunting if you're lying king he's an important danger dickensin all the time and i have
a heart attack yeah i say who is your home here
i'm gonna find a new guidelines i just committed something i'm gonna check on my attorney
you know how much money attorneys are gonna make that one for us oh yeah they're back in business
oh edible holy cow
fcc lawyers they had nothing to do for a couple of years
oh you're talking several millions of dollars remember all those guys you said i'm washing
tin yeah they work i would have worked yeah there was nothing to do we're gonna do some of our
murder readings and that potential army's off a tenth of a point got us so i'm gonna get a
do scc lawyers all the sudden you see everyone in law school jumping up a den of you and i'm cc lawyer
that's it i got like 900 phone calls from the ACLU they're going to represent i mean yeah this is
a field day this is what this is all i'm telling it's lawyers you know what i'm saying about i
saw the i'm stepping guys from the uh i'm just creating work for all their buddies and
most of them look like the type of guys who got beat up in high school here with the guys on the
fcc i saw one guy in larry k show that you see larry king yeah you gotta listen to this guy let
us fast forward through this tape but you gotta listen to this guy he um he looks like the kind of
guy who got beat up in high school up by wise guys like me and now he's like he's gonna get my
look at the first you're gonna hear do you listen to me right where is it man i gotta get the tape
oh it's my key but you gotta hear this guy can i get my crew while you're queuing your tape
i'll come on with your crew because you guys are just gonna hatch at me anyway just you guys got
enough footage of it you can hatch at me once he's old footage yeah okay with me you can use
all footage you guys got some good footage of me right let me just uh reach you this tape
it's pretty cool because this is kind of guy that like you say hate wise guys like me
is that probably made fun of him he never got to be in the good group yeah he never got to
get to be a party so he's gonna hold it against me he used to sit over in the corner and just
ride yeah
lot i know a fair amount of our radio management i think without a
smothered one there comes all right this isn't a guy from the ocean this is like a civil
libertarian dude who's really wow i keep believes in every kind of freedom freedom's i'm against
even him not that i'm actually yes that's just that's just that's the reason that you
had it uh i think that uh every idea that's worth to think about in society will remain on
the airways and i'm not at all completely you know every thought that
decision what are thinking about yeah
it's not me can't think about x-quick x-quick it x-quickatory functions
i don't even know what it is what does that i think no uh uh what is that hey that was a
offensive sorry about it i don't need to do it yeah guys think that's funny
reaction down the rope towards uh with the rhythm and the rhythm how to try i know i know
i know it's gonna work i'm gonna do it now that was pretty offensive it really set those guys off
the lorry's offensive with the same thing the lorry king and that really
time i'm gonna fly out to the coast i got a thing i got a late neck gray up program i'm gonna
back here and i'm gonna hide it back come on out me
why is it but if we write back you think don't i'm supposed to find in that
hunter yeah i'm just gonna be happy he just i'm taking that doing my interviews that i reject
i reject it anyway you don't want your crew in here just use some old footage and stuff
you guys have to be all the time anyway i'm sure to you not you personally i don't think you're a very
nice person but just the industry you're in anywhere you come on you know you come in here
so you're gonna come on what are you gonna get to the sex so now i gotta sit now i
now i'm forced to do a sex is everybody's sitting here waiting for me to do it i know
just go i'm never doing sex again just a bit of people and you got to stay tuned for like the next
seven years or wait a year if i do it again i do this isn't going back at CNN
so look at that 57th treat i had some bikini girls with me yeah to make photo
grep the bikini girls had nothing to do with the show nothing to do with the show
just i like to travel with girls and bikinis okay that's my little hang up that doesn't have an
everyday exactly we marry the cat like two or three wives didn't i i guess i don't i like to
travel with bikini girls if you got into bikini maybe i got your camera for you
what's that stuff you have now is that an attack on women and it could be that's a sexual thing
oh that that isn't relevant that's not what's thinking about cops on women
good luck and we got what's thinking about
because dangerous every thought worth thinking about say hi y'all when children bet so
oh
i have to get that compliment on him
well yeah
can i have you do you date any different then
listen to the back on when Larry King does an interview listen to him in the background
you got to hear this right are you concerned that the stern of animals gonna be once
let everyone know he's still breathing yeah just like you know the big heart attack
she's like in the back but this isn't me strong
you know
just take this out though it's very subtle do we lead to i'm just saying something
tomorrow at WNBC can lose his license
yeah i'm just gonna say i'm a says and said anything where anyone could lose your license for the past 15 years
they're hoping he says something make people listen
yeah
and just like anything that's creative
uh i'm not gonna try to in any way get into that i'm as his kid
oh that'd be interesting oh boy i'd like to do that
yeah let the girl wouldn't
but i am concerned as i said before to use a cliché that is up there if you i think i've
worked in radio a lot i know a fair amount of our radio management i think without a
snutter warning coming down there'll be a considerable shift phone management
dealing with people who are less let us say independent and don't say to match it
and i'm gonna get a lot of it
and clear easy larry this tumble
i like this itself
what you never hear this on the TV
yeah i think i showed this on TV then i let you uh
i get that so i'm gonna wait for you to say something with the sexual connotation
who is it
what is it?
oh see rasi checking in there

thinks about the new nba basketball team huh wonder she's going to be hanging around there in
liberty city can you just see that it's probably got her season tickets all right it wouldn't
that be great if she got all her white friends to buy up all of the season tickets for the arena
that would be real interesting and then of course once that happened they'd have to move all
the residents to the area to some other part of town like maybe maybe they could swap maybe
all they can move all the black people to brick a lavenu in those nice buildings and taffy and
all her white folks could move into liberty city and overta you know all the tenement buildings

and he was asking about that volume dial and kept saying what goes around comes around
anyway is there anybody in the audience who was up did we have any complaints any hysteria now
i mean wasn't lesbian dilatated but it was uh there was some pretty wild stuff in there
i think probably that was a real good example from a news standpoint not only in terms of the
first amendment the discussion in the FCC but also in terms of Larry King yeah that was very
apropos pretty soon Larry's going by by in this market isn't he yeah nobody has picked that show
off and now you can understand why uh next month uh it gets early May i think like May 4th he'll be
gone yeah right yeah yeah why don't write him a check that's what we all should do we should also
and Larry a check and see if he'll cash him for us no chance no way hoze so what do you make of all of
this this was a pretty uh momentous day you ought to be in hog heaven because you're the big
Howard Stern activist yeah in sound florida some people get involved in politics some people get
involved in the environment uh Glen Hill of course is the Howard Stern civic activist that's
why uh Mark Cune will speak to me because I don't know if you can vulgarity from coast to coast
they're funny to me you know i think he's a steric they're very funny to me and you're really
going to enjoy that tape that i guess it was being dilatated yeah yeah yeah lesbian dilatated uh perfect
we can't even get people to send in pictures here are are a hunk hot contest that died went over
like a pregnant woman that died you got like two pictures and terminal well we got about a half
a dozen but nothing exciting now you didn't say that yeah i know one of them wasn't exciting it was
just a pornographic and a couple of them were pretty exciting but yeah there were about seven or
eight this is just not a fun town don't you understand we don't want to go overboard i mean
everybody's getting involved in the campaign and that's great and we've had a real positive input
here but we have to do everything kind of like a stuffy way because we don't want to have too much
fun right management gets upset if they perceive that we're you know having too much fun
and maybe Dave Murray over in Tampa the chief engineer at WPLPR sister station maybe he would send
a picture for the contest yeah i only showed you three pictures because the other ones weren't
worth seeing believe me trust me what you saw was the best of the lot of a sorry lot all of the
first one now that young man was he was a model though right oh he was really he was a very very
good looking young guy and he was excellent by the way but uh you notice how slow he is today i
mean what is it i don't know have you been listening to daffy show maybe he's sitting like you're on
like a uh forty second delay today or five minute delay i know i know i know i know that
what nearly he sits here and just on that 60 cycle tone yeah well we don't you know we don't
just kind of get stuck there we get today or people get upset when i come on here so i've tried not
to be too out of any work not that you're out of work now they all feel sorry for do they i saw
when you were in the kitchen last week when it was like a charity job oh god everybody was kissing
him on the ring man they were just going nuts but if he got a job again tomorrow they would just
to ignore him they would stone wallet it's true everybody came up said oh we hope you come back
and we'd love to see you come even Lee mazilli or whatever his name is up there wouldn't talk to you
league league jelele jelele yeah he's not talking himself but uh yeah rumors that he was wearing
underwear today by the way so that shows you how desperate the people at zeta are they're running
around in rubber underwear oh no wonder can't he didn't come out just just a joke just a joke now
she listen we got to try to put her image back together i've been accused of turning her into
some kind of a dehumanized slut no on that show on Saturday yeah there was a young guy who called
up Mike Spindell on Sunday and he said that he had made the decision that he will not listen
when Kathy and I was 36 years old he couldn't handle it anymore i think each other every time he
hears us on together he starts handling it and he says he just can't handle it anymore it wears him
off for the rest of the week okay that's what he says all right and a 36 boy if that's all it takes
he's got some serious problems he had to call up dr. Bruce okay we have another break to do don't
wait boy i can't believe it well that's what happens when your show degenerates in the way how it's
there and uh concert i'm curious do you think there are people in this audience who even understood
what that was all about or appreciated it because i mean we went to great lengths to put that on the
and uh the people at w y s p were nice enough to uh do something i hope they appreciated it i enjoyed
it and i'm sure like see on the phone i mean if there are people who appreciate getting a chance to
hear that and enjoyed uh whatever it was that Howard and the robin were doing there like there's
nothing there's like one line flashing oh boy and that's probably Mike he's probably look at that i'm
serious there's nothing going on i mean any any other thing we do like three lines oh i see oh i
like it they're stepping up yeah they're a little slow well by this time in the show don't you
understand they're just uh whipped up into a frenzy they're just all passed out we're all slow
to the aftermath yeah or the afterbirth something like that okay ten minutes before two at w i and
z when we come back that's uh yeah there's still six of them flashing okay mic middle is on this one
here let's say the morning zoo is over here this must be mic mk and the tanner is on one
and the herman and mcQueen are on one of the other lines here too okay let's take our last break i
promise we just won't do it again here today and then we'll come right back and wrap it all up and
put a bow on it and see what the hell it was all about it back it's one oh wait that's good i'm glad
this last hour's moving along because i'm getting so tired of beating the audience with a whip today
man these people are about his laid out they're all either on drugs or they don't speak english
i gotta tell you something this town i wonder if rickshaw could do the talk up on this
man i know you're in for a man
i'm gonna so i'm gonna let myself get
absolute Mexican man it's a raining man
i know you're in for a man every special man
oh
understand that was the favorite song of the late fdi director
came to hover it's um nine minutes after one at wionc we're gonna let it all hang out so we'll
play nil roger's 123 on wionc and you'll be back in a minute this is Glenn hill i never dreamed
when i woke up this morning that i would be filling in for a nil for a few minutes and i don't
have a clue what to talk about you know should i take a phone call no you you're serious Kyle i should
take a phone call uh let me move over to uh nil's chair wait a minute this is uh
this is wild this is like a dream so i go to uh number two hollywood and we'll see what's
happening hello hollywood are you there yeah hollywoods yeah how you doing good help me find your uh
try out here yeah help me fill in while we wait i'd like to do that yeah you know all i wanted to say
nil roger's a t.u. it really doesn't matter and that is that it seems to me that the fantasy of
allyson one the land has finally come true because everything seems to be upside down if you know
i mean it's just unbelievable you know in the in allyson one the land uh people didn't put
necklaces on necklaces put little people on and it seems to me that what's called conservative
today is really just the opposite because if it truly was conservative then they would be up
in arms as soon as there'd be any attack on constitutional guaranteed uh right right and
and on here anybody screaming about uh rights violations or limitations except for the who
who supposed to be anti uh constitutional rights such as uh libertarian type people and uh
and it seems to me that what is passing off as uh conservatism is just a notsy fascist religious
fanatical type people amen who uh who aren't satisfied with anything else but bringing this nation
through the state of iran pre uh chomeini to the point where maybe we'll have blood in the streets
maybe we'll have this kind of disorder i don't know what they're looking for but it seems to me
that they want to make major changes in this country and if your blood and my blood has to run
in the street then that's fine with them they're going to have their way king george is going to be
back on the throne and the revolution is going to have been taken in vain okay and of course as far
as being on the throne is concerned um uh twenty five past one at w and z i want to tell you
something i just found parts of the building that i didn't even know existed and it's a good thing
i found them i'm really concerned about the fm boy am i concerned i run out of here and i go to the
what would you call it restroom but the regular yeah restroom yeah what the minthroom
and they're having like an fm staff meeting in there in the bathroom in the bathroom well i mean uh
and in the stalls and i'm very nervous when you go into a restroom restroom and there are a whole bunch
of guys converting around in there you know what i'm saying was the consultant in there and somebody
one of them was seeing glory hallelujah i'm serious then i look up in the front at the executive
john up there and the doors closed and all of a sudden my life is flashing before my eyes and i
thought how can this be see that was one of the nice things about being here at night yeah no
problem i'm sure that kyle remembers a couple of times at night even with guests here when they all
of a sudden in the middle of an hour you know when nature just uh was going to have its way right and
we put on a couple of psa's and i flew out of here and you know but there was nobody here so you
didn't have to worry about that but during the daytime man look out so i luckily you told me about
that the hidden bathroom and the bathroom in the back there that looks like something out of the
dark ages although you know looks are not what counts that's right as long as the plumbing works man
that's the only thing that really uh that you care about i didn't know that was back there either
that's hidden away ron Harris and uh budwaw back there with a little shower the carper goes
okay let's go back to the phone i'm sorry but boy that was just uh in fact i may make another move
back there in this moment and i do mean move plantation hello hi hi there's all this count as
extracurricular eggs very well putzer for a big trouble now yes now that they're going to have live
models and underwear commercials on TV yeah that means someday we'll have live condo models on TV no
down that's the next step but what's really obscene is a new state gun law yes me uh they really
just pushing it too far and then they said uh well we'll let each county decide on a waiting period
why don't they just let each county decide on the whole issue well far as i'm concerned is i
said before it's a lost cause and it just it's not even worth talking about i mean you know i think
at this point that everybody got to go out and buy a gun and uh that you know the gun is not what
it's all about it's the people the people in this country are irresponsible it's got nothing to do
with whether i mean look at this maniac last night are you serious oh god well we finally got one
of those out of the building now we got a whole new is that what you're trying to tell me good
golly miss molly used to open up that fm recording studio and all those little boys would come falling
out of there like five years old okay it's 14 before two i think i'm gonna i'm not sure though don't
go away all right in fact i really don't i don't think i am gonna make it i just as soon as i said
that there was just like a little of voice inside of me i said what do you think you're kidding you
know like there's no way you're gonna make 14 minutes oh no no way oh not 14 seconds maybe
can we have a countdown oh wait a minute maybe if i take deep breaths
we can put on 2d France again south Miami hello hello to you yes hello friend let's talk about life
experience um i'd like to ask one thing the no one seemed to have brought up if the fcc considers a
lot of things uh patently offensive if you're in the if you're in the armed forces the uh you're
certainly not able to turn off the commanding officers cursing and all sorts of other things that
they say which are far more horrendously over here on Howard's turns program anyone has
ever been in the air force of the army of the navy knows that the uh or in the marine but don't
leave out the marine sir uh marines i had a friend who was in the marine but in fact he was
stationed at Quantanamo Bay manning officer got in the week after he stepped up that line of
it and said you know why i saw your sister and she was the best piece of AI i've ever had in my
life talk about patently offensive and try turning him off
yes sir go ahead oh uh i wonder if they're gonna start bringing any criminal charges against
enlisted people probably uh i guess you know people like general once more and have enough
enough of that stuff behind them to put them away for the rest of their lives
they care no okay sir was that a good call i'm not sure i'm out either i was uh sitting here
pondering and i wonder what i have to call former admiral point what does he know is he a rear
admiral can we say that on the air i think he is they demoted him didn't they yeah he's a rear admiral
you know what that means don't you hollywood hello yeah hello nil yes uh hey listen i'm behind you
a hundred percent on a so far campaign that you had this petitioned right as far as that goes
but i'm just wondering if we're not uh it did you ever give any thought our illegal the
constitution and the bill of rights says very clearly congress shall make no law abridging
the right of first speech it doesn't say a few laws it doesn't say a couple of laws it doesn't
say more than one law it doesn't have an asterisk it says they shall make no law abridging the right
of free speech or they free exercise of religion period and along come these self-appointed moralist
and censors and they decide what that's supposed to mean and when you start monkeying around with
our most basic freedoms who the hell knows what it's going to be next you know we we keep saying
an over and over and over again and i still have the sinking feeling that the people who ought to be
the most scared by it who've been through it before these are going to be the last ones to respond
because they're totally confused about the issue the issue has nothing to do with words that you
think are vulgar it has to do whether the government can continue to censor and repress
free expression because if it's words this week about sex or organs next week it'll be words
about the president or politicians and the week after that it'll be something else that we can't say
it's 152 at W.I.'s you better not get too excited because that might stimulate some internal
activity here we'll pause and come right back
and if your talk show host is a lemon they're going to take care of that too so stick around for
that now we discovered today if nothing else we discovered why they haven't been talking on the
the fm
right
no seriously isn't that supposed to be part of polite matters is never speak with
a full mouth
weren't you taught that as a youngster
oh he's doing gum i'm sorry he's not going to well
say anything at this point
yeah i know ricky tiki with a hat he looks like a craig-worthy without the beard
now that had as offensive to me
yeah he's but rickshaw is patently offensive to me i think we ought to get him
off the air he is
that brogan at eighty second talk up crap of his that went out thirty years
ago
is patently offensive to me
and yet are we starting a petition drive to get ricky tiki off the air now
we just turn waxy off that's all very simple right
boy i mean he is does he offend you
alteratres mean nuts
yeah you know i like a lot of the music if he would just shut up
yeah place good oldies in the afternoon but uh...
it's uh... whoo you know
whoo ricky tiki whoo whoo whoo uh...
ha ha
anyway we're gonna be at the cv smith park tomorrow gonna have talked
