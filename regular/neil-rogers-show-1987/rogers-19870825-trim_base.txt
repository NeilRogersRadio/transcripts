our good Christians to lie and to make things up and to put words into my mouth or the
stations mouth and allege that things have been set on this station.
You know, and of course, we even had one caller who called it yesterday.
It was very upset that they had taken his line and attributed to me and also twisted it
around a little bit.
Of course.
Yeah.
You would think they wouldn't do that.
No, not good God fearing God loving, neighbor loving, all of the other good stuff.
You know, which of course makes one think of the Spanish Inquisition, but that's a very
long subject for another day.
But all of our faithful listeners out there can take a deep sigh.
All of you know who?
Mm-hmm.
A Bob Lassiter sigh.
Oh, yeah.
Good for you.
Because, you know, I've gone to the wood shed and everything is, came out kosher.
Everything came out okay.
Copacetic.
Is that the word?
Very good.
Excellent choice of words.
You've been hanging around Don Webb, I bet.
All those big words.
Is that a Don Webb?
What a wicked web.
We, how does that go?
When we DC.
Oh boy, somebody will call in some 90 year old, we'll call in with that old saying.
Oh yeah.
I know what you're talking about.
I know what I'm talking about.
Yeah, but I can't.
What a wicked web.
We weave.
We weave.
When we in the church DC, or something like that.
We in the Archbishop.
Exactly.
So maybe if you're looking for the wicked web, he might be over at church.
But what I was starting to say, and you know how when you come in here, I keep getting
sidetracked.
Sometimes for up to four hours.
It would seem to me that when some of our Catholic friends out there, we've got a lot of them,
thousands of them, that when they go to church this Sunday or whenever they go to mass.
I guess they're constantly during the week.
They have all these masses.
I don't know.
The teaming masses.
That perhaps they ought to put a little note in the collection plate instead of their
usual 50 cents or dollar or 10 bucks or whatever they put in there.
Just put a little note in there and say, you know, buzz off.
Yeah.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
They won't do it though.
They're cowards.
I've been trying for years to get somebody to stand up in church on Sunday right in the
middle of the sermon or in synagogue and say, this is a bunch of garbage.
When are you going to stop lying to these people?
When are you going to tell us the truth?
When are you going to stop with all the mumbo jumbo and all of these archaic rituals and
nonsense and speak to us about something that means something in our lives?
And they won't do it.
They don't have any guts.
No.
Not going to happen.
Not in our lifetime.
Shameful.
But what do you think about all these quints and then?
Well, I mean, we could take a poll on it.
Yeah.
Because when you said, what do you think it brought back the ghost of leaf followers came
into my mind?
What do you think?
I miss Lee.
God.
I'm going to be a lot of disappointed people out in the audience this morning.
I guess those who listen every day, but just are praying praying to the Lord that I should
disappear.
They are so all the same people who prayed for the dolphins last night.
He would have did for that.
I like what I watched women's volleyball last night too.
And I agree with Ron Harris.
And that was definitely the sport to watch last night.
Not this one.
Ron said that he flipped over and watched women's volleyball.
He flipped over and watched women's volleyball.
And it's not going to get into that because that that border is right on the edge of those
things that we don't discuss here on WLS.
And when you say that he flipped over.
Yeah, I forgot.
And watched women's volleyball.
This is our sports director, big dolphin.
Yeah.
Well, it was a pretty, I saw the last part of it.
The volleyball game is better.
Pretty impressed me.
The volleyball.
Even watching body by solo flex.
Right.
The weather channel.
It's better.
Like an hour and a half.
I love the weather channel.
That's my favorite.
I can't go to sleep at night unless I logs, you know, like 20 minutes at least of the
weather channel.
Well, I think we'll take our first break on that note.
I think we're going to have a pretty intriguing show today.
I'm not sure exactly why, but I just have that feeling.
Look at all those day people calling.
Broward people are well, they don't want to call it raining like crazy here.
Yeah.
Is it raining or did stop?
Well, somewhere else though, it's probably raining guaranteed.
Guaranteed.
Probably Broward.
In Broward, it's a very good point.
So Stan had a doctor's appointment today and couldn't make it in early.
He'll be in.
He'll be in sooner or later, but not, you know, he was going to be not early.
Right.
He'll be in.
Well, early for Stan is 130.
Exactly.
Well, Stan is a late sleeper.
You know, I happen to be one of those now when I just wake up automatically early.
In fact, it really irritates me on Sunday.
Yeah.
Me till I wake up real early.
Yeah.
Like about 730.
Yeah.
I don't like that.
Yeah.
But I don't have a solution to that problem.
Well, he's just acting like Mr. Informative here today.
Isn't he?
All of us.
There he goes.
There he goes, lapsing back into what he does best and that is making a total jackass
out of himself.
Okay.
It's 18 past 10 at W Y and Z.
I'm here.
I'm going to continue to be here.
We're going to do our thing and I will go on and.
We're going to have a good, uh, neat.
Well, you never know.
You never know.
At least until the next crisis, right?
I think you just want to make that very clear to Mr. Tom San and all these other, uh,
we're going to say, they were going to do our thing in this building.
Well, maybe not in the building.
Maybe we'll go out on the lawn again.
Not today.
We'd be FM.
We can have a whole big wins thing, wins and Zayda together on the lawn.
Wouldn't that be great?
And we can have a little weeny roast out there.
Would be fantastic.
That's a good idea.
Exactly.
Roast some marshmallows.
I want to roast some.
I mean, it's a beautiful day.
Let's go on the backyard and have a good time.
Sure.
And we could baptize everybody on the FM because God only knows.
Okay.
1019 at W Y and Z.
I can see.
Got a great t-shirt somebody sent in, by the way.
And it says on it, speak English, dammit.
I like it.
And it's got a picture of a vulture on it.
And what it does.
It's supposed to be an American eagle, but I think that's really a vulture.
Probably another coincidence.
Probably.
So many coincidences lately.
You may be able to get away with it.
I know.
Let's have her on today.
Could we have Daffy come on?
Sure.
It's a rainy day.
It's tank and it's depressing.
And we could lift.
We could lift a whole bunch of minority people up by their bootstraps today because there
probably a lot of people with boots on a rainy day like this.
I'll be happy to call her for you.
Oh, great.
It would be like going back to kindergarten again.
Wouldn't it go back to school?
We could do it like Ed Cohen says.
Some of that elementary school humor that he's talking about.
My good friend Ed.
Yeah.
Boy, how they turn on you in this town.
They really do.
And that's that it hurt.
Yeah.
It hurt bad when they turn on you like that.
What's that?
This is a copy of the letter that I read on your yesterday.
Oh, nice letter.
It's a letter.
Excellent letter.
Can I have that?
For what?
For our records?
I feel like I just tore in half.
I'd say the good part.
Sure.
What is sure a lot of people ring in the phone up here this morning, aren't they?
I'm sure there is static.
When you get on and you start saying these things.
Well, we're getting a lot of static, but I think we finally reached the pinnacle.
No, I think this morning we climbed to the top of the mountain and took one small
leap for mankind or something like that.
I get all of those things confused.
You know, I get a whole list in the game.
We took just a little leap from tower number three.
Okay.
Was Rick Edwards.
In fact, we may bring in Mottie Hall today.
Who's hanging from tower number two?
You know, that kind of stuff.
Let's make a deal.
But I feel just fine now.
I feel like my life is worth about a dollar and a half at least, which is, you know,
a bucket of half more than it was when I got up this morning.
And we're all back to normal.
Everybody loves each other in the crisis has passed.
I thought it might.
Yeah.
And everything is fine.
Great.
There is no joy in Mottville because many cases.
Some people are upset.
Exactly.
Well, Dr. Hoffenmouth is probably having an herbivore now.
I'm sure he's gotten worried by now.
You know, also have a very,
well, it's a two-day.
We have a lot of business to do here today.
And that'll probably depress him even more.
Won't it?
God, I hope so.
Yeah.
Well, that's a break stock.
Yeah, we have a lot of breaks.
Now, if he would just go back to taking care of all of his heart patients and if Jack would
just take care of whatever it is,
his fellow mental patients, you know, everything would be fine.
And we could all just live happily ever after.
Don't call us today, Jack.
We're monitoring you, Jack.
We're monitoring your office.
We're monitoring your phone.
Don't call us.
In fact, there was a guy from Metro in here, let yesterday.
And he's going to make personal, that's right, personal involvement.
Yep.
To make sure that the Jack just stays on the straight and narrow path.
Uh, he said something to me about getting on the straight and narrow path.
And I said, well, part of that anyway.
Yeah.
Exactly.
First part, there we go again, encouraging you know what?
heterosexuality.
Oh, God forbid.
I told you yesterday, no more sex.
That will solve all of our problems.
Everybody just stops thinking about it, stops doing it, no more problems.
Well, I'm sure there's a chance of that happening.
Of course.
In this town, it's a very good chance of that happening.
It's about 70% of the population has already gone into that category.
Believe me.
I mean, where there's no sense, there's no feeling, you know,
but I think we ought to put some of these calls on hold here,
because I'm not going to just punch him up again.
I don't want to go through that business again.
No, because it's a rainy day in Georgia.
Right.
And there are a lot of people out there get very nervous calling in when it's raining.
Yeah.
They're afraid that something evil is going to happen on the phone.
I saw an incredible rainbow and I was coming to work this morning.
And I should have known I was an I-75,
but just making that turn off the Harrison Parkway under I-75.
It was this big, beautiful rainbow.
And I should have known that that was an omen of things to come.
Absolutely.
You should have.
Of course.
So you heard me again on that show this morning.
Yes, I did.
They keep playing it.
It is you.
It is me.
They taped it off the ear, which is patently illegal.
And we would never do something like that on this show, right?
Oh, man.
All right.
How do you want to work this, Rob?
And you decide.
I told you.
But should I close my eyes?
No.
Okay.
I can't believe that they're desperate in the morning,
that you know who endonled and noodles are that desperate,
that they're going to start taping my voice.
I got an idea for them.
Why don't they just tape my whole show?
And they can play it there in the morning.
Of course, we'll take them to court and they'll lose their license.
But that's another story.
Tell them.
For many ideas.
Let them play the whole show.
They probably do a seven share in the morning.
They keep talking about my return over there.
They can't wait.
They're in a love you.
They are in a dream or a whole.
They're hot for your body over there.
Trust me.
Make no mistake about it.
Here's a little message from Rich on the screen.
The misfits are calling already.
Well, of course.
Jack's already on the phone.
I thought he was on the phone.
Oh, not him.
Other misfits.
Well, you know, some like little league misfits.
Maybe the major league ones, just the little ones so far.
Oh, blue here at old farms.
Oh, boy.
They're upset on the beach.
They're very unhappy.
I mean, beach is shacking.
I would thought we'd get rid of him.
Finally, we won him off the air.
Now, give him off.
Yeah, cool.
They're whipping the radio with their cane.
Oh, having a nervous breakdown.
They're attacking their neighbors with their walkers.
The beach is shuddering.
Oh, boy.
There may be a minor tremor on the beach and in Halendale this morning.
And I bet you who's really upset in North Bay Village.
Irving Shaqtman, probably having a novice breakdown in North Bay Village, boy.
He'll never be the same.
You may have had something this morning.
Yeah.
Like about a gallon of prune juice.
Won't help Irving.
You're never going to get it out of your system.
Where did I hear?
Oh, when Larry King was on, who was talking about Larry King was on the Hollywood squares last week or something?
And the question was, what's the question?
Someone told you on the phone, right?
What city consumes the most prune?
We already heard that.
It's very old.
Is that on this show?
It's not. It was from last week.
I heard it.
I couldn't remember where I heard it.
Sorry.
I'll behave.
Don't worry.
I think they were right about one part of their complaint.
Okay, let's go to Bokka first.
Good morning.
You like that tick that little tick on the phone?
Now, what? It's probably raining up there.
They're not going to hold on.
North Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?
Okay.
Listen, you're talking about coincidence this today, right?
Yeah.
Well, I got a coincidence here.
Did you ever see Stan Major and Bernard Meltzer together?
Oh, my good friend.
Boy, that is a very good point.
I never did see him together.
You know, and I figured he's got a doctor's appointment today.
Maybe that's his excuse.
Yeah, Dr. Bernard.
Well, you saw what happened to Dr. Bernard.
They put him out to pasture.
Yeah, I wonder why he was, you know,
he's got to be one of the best on that talk, Matt.
Oh, he was, he was my favorite.
It's cooking.
Hello, my dear friend.
You can call me genius.
You can call me friend.
You can call me grandpa.
He was good.
Yeah, the rest of them suck, too.
What does that tell you about W.O.R. in New York
that they got Bernard Meltzer on every day?
Boy.
Yeah, well, they should take Bruce Williams
and dump him out in the garbage, too.
But never on a Tuesday.
Today is Tuesday.
So, are you Bruce alone?
Will you play?
Is he, you know, every Tuesday he regresses into that street talk?
Yeah, we have to put that to the problem.
I have my radio.
You know, I listen to you in the morning,
and then at night time when I go out,
I turn on a radio, and there's Bruce on Tuesday.
Yeah.
Well, you know, it adds another dimension to your life
when you get to get into his world with him, you know,
and spin a few with dreams,
and it adds a whole new dimension for you.
After again, you know?
Sorry, like a snake-wirl salesman.
I'm trying.
Okay, you know, you don't want to get thrown out now.
Yeah, true.
Okay, well, listen, have a great life,
and we'll see you on Thursday.
We'll see you next Tuesday.
Okay, maybe he'll call us every week only on Tuesday.
I hope so.
What's doing?
What's doing?
Well, I'll tell you that guy is one of the great snake-wirl salesmen
in the history of mankind.
He really is.
He's got a line of V.S.
That is unprecedented in the history of broadcasting.
He Richard is laughing because I think he rides the board on talknet,
and that's really, and normally, and he...
Oh, here's Ross with the mail.
This ought to be good.
The mail came in really early today.
Right.
So the audience gets really upset when we start reading the mail on the air.
And today being a Tuesday, we don't usually get a lot of mail on Tuesday.
We're looking at that.
We didn't even get it in the box today.
We just got it in his hands, so to speak.
And what is this?
We have another box.
Is this from the Bahamas?
Ooh, that's some of that.
Yeah.
It says, Rattle Okay.
What does that mean?
It's okay to rattle it.
Oh, I see.
I don't like the sounds of it.
It's from Smith.
I wonder if that's from Alfredo Smith at Calder.
I doubt it.
I don't laugh.
You don't even know who that is.
Alfredo used to be a jockey at Calder,
and now every once in a great while he pretends to still be.
But boy, we got some interesting stuff.
Now, this feels interesting in this envelope, huh?
We're going to have a little fun here this morning.
We're going to place, squeeze the envelope for about the next 25 minutes.
I think there's anything good inside this one?
Doubtful.
I'm thinking wrong.
I think there could be something really good in here.
Ooh, look at that.
It rattles also.
Another box.
What is this stuff?
Oh, here's a cassette.
I tell you, it's work.
It's got all kinds of, no, it's not.
It's got all kinds of stuff on here.
Can we play it on the air?
Shoplifters?
Wimpy's?
Crazy Commando?
Frank Zaffa.
Yeah, we're going to play that on the air.
That would be a...
That would be the end.
Okay, let's take another caller too.
We do have an open line in date, by the way.
It's 624-9400.
Got a caller on a mobile phone.
Hello.
Neil, how are you?
Okay.
The first 10 minutes of the show this morning.
And I was curious whether or not they are restocking the racks.
You getting all the old goodies back or what?
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
We're not, you know, there are a couple of things that disappear that probably won't come back.
But other than that, everything is just wonderful.
I won't come back because you can't get a hold of them or they won't let you come back.
They have put them in the deep freeze.
I tell you about how to be weeks and weeks ago.
I was able to get...
Walk with an erection off the air onto a cassette tape, which I keep here in the van.
And through once in a while, I put you guys down quiet when you get a bow though on
and sort of refresh my memory.
That's a great tune.
Yeah, it is a classic.
Well, that one might walk back any more one day.
I never know.
That would be nice.
That would be real nice.
You guys are marvelous.
Absolutely marvelous.
Yeah, well, we feel marvelous today, sir.
I'm glad to hear it.
It's nice to be loved.
It's nice to know that the people stand way behind you with their full support.
Does it weigh behind you?
Does it mean that all the pressure is off and all the wigs up there are...
are there number one station in the U.S.?
The wigs are all back in place, sir.
They all look like Ben Franklin and George Washington on a bad day, and Elton John.
Excellent. Well, you guys laugh in, really.
And not all the mobile collars are suits, okay?
Yeah. Now, every now and then, we get a good one.
All right. Keep up the good work.
Okay. Have a great day.
Thank you, sir.
Okay. Now, what is that?
Seriously, in fact, most of the people I know who are Catholic long since gave it up, you know,
because they got tired of going into the confessional and telling the priest about all the little things that they were doing.
But, boy, the church itself, man, you talk about hypocrites and talk about narrow-minded authoritarian lunatics,
but they just are going to cram anything down your throat that they can.
Unbelievable.
We had dealt a credit and joy or show very much, now, they go by that we don't listen.
How do you like that?
Be darned.
I think that the I love John Paul, George, and Ringo bumper stickers are a great idea.
There are five of us here that would like one.
Great.
And it's about the name where we send them, and it says, have a wonderful life.
Well, great. Thank you, Leslie.
And we'll send those out to you post-taste.
Yes. And I tell you, I saw my first bumper sticker last night on my way home on a car.
Yeah.
Yeah, if you're going to get, we're going to send you these bumper stickers, make sure to put them on your cars.
Would you please look great?
Yeah, they do look good.
Yeah.
I hear a little cartoon of the Pope right here.
Shame on them.
Okay, let's take some more calls.
We don't want to just read the mail and put the audience into a coma, do we?
We don't.
Sure we do.
North Miami, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, after some session, I just want to hear you guys, I mean, we're going to hang up.
I want to hear you give the Bronx cheer to Jack Thompson.
Have for me.
That's what we were.
Or the fish cheer.
Yeah.
We also gave him the year number one in our book sign.
I don't really know what's wrong with this guy.
You know, well, he doesn't have anything better to do or what?
He doesn't have a full life as somebody I know would say.
Can you give me the definition?
What's the difference between listening to a talk to you and monitoring it?
Well, what is the definition?
No, monitoring is like big brother.
For example, if you had that, you know, if you ever read 1980 or saw 1984 read the book,
and there was the big eye in your bedroom and every room in the house,
watching you, two way T.C., they were monitoring.
In other words, if you were doing a little hanky, panky in the bedroom, they weren't watching,
they were monitoring.
That doesn't really make sense though, though.
No, not really, but it sounds good.
It sounds pseudo intellectual.
There's like a thin line between listening and monitoring.
Exactly.
For example, if you were like a peeping Tom and you were looking in your next door neighbor's window,
you could say, I'm monitoring you, you know, that kind of stuff.
And it still takes you way and throw you in the slamer.
See what's going on.
You're not listening to the show for your enjoyment.
You're listening to the show to see what's going on on the show.
Even though he probably is obsessed with him, listen to every day and get some kind of excitement out of him.
Absolutely, you bet.
I mean, yeah, he just sounds, is his voice real too?
I was going to ask you, I mean.
I don't know.
He's monitoring us.
Boy, this guy is a curious one.
Well, somewhere anyway.
Well, there's something wrong with him, yeah.
Well, don't lose any sleepover.
Believe me.
I really do retire to turn.
Did you hear about that?
No.
I hear he's a retired human being.
But he's something.
You know, I'd like to get a couple of guys that like Rambo and go out and, you know.
No, no, just leave him alone.
He's small potatoes.
Yeah, Mr. Wysher, we even give him the credit.
Exactly.
I think everybody's really gave him too much credit because, like, Stan even said,
well, there's this guy, Jack Thompson, he's trying to get us off the air.
I mean, this guy, you know, he's going to come out on the paper.
I'm the one who got new rogues off the air.
He would have succeeded.
He's not, though.
That's what he's trying to do.
It's like beating up Muhammad Ali or something.
Right.
He won all the credit.
Okay, well, listen, have a wonderful day.
So as often as you can, keep giving him the box.
Cheers.
It just turns me on.
It does something for me.
And saying this is dedicated to Jack Thompson and keep giving it to him off and on all day.
Okay.
Did you do that for me?
Okay.
Thank you very much.
See you later.
Look at this.
Here's Rosemary and Miami Lakes.
Wonderful.
Good letter.
Rosemary is almost perfect.
Although at the end of her letter, she says, I also like Glen Hill.
So you were doing great Rosemary till you got to that line.
And then you kind of, you know, this thing that they sent us at hops.
I've noticed every time I look at it, I think of Jack Thompson.
Do you really think there's anything to that?
A little bit too big to remind me of Jack.
Good point.
Okay, let's take our last break here.
It's eight minutes before 11 at W.A.
You want to thank me in Lauderdale for this neat little, what would you call it?
At the mom of the thing.
No, it's not a third.
It's got a thermometer on it, but it's a thing.
And it says, if you must smoke, please don't exhale.
Why but you somebody I know up in the front of the building, love to have that.
Our general manager is a fanatic non-smoker.
Anti-smoker.
Not just a non-smoker.
There are a lot of us who are non-smokers, but he's an anti-smoker.
Millotent.
I know.
Hostel.
So that's why whenever you're upset, you always go up there with a big cigar.
With a huge cigar.
Dogey in your health and blow it in his face.
Miami.
Coral Gables.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
I have your quotation for you, Neil.
It's a water tangled, red wee weave.
When first we practice.
2DC.
That's excellent.
That's the one.
And the little bobbing trinket that you have there is called a tumbic or hairy.
Don't say it.
All right.
And she's right on track.
It's the imagination nothing.
It's hopping.
Sure.
A little bobbing trinket.
It's great.
All right.
And I'm your friendly fundamental about this.
And just for I'd call in with your quotation.
And now I can go on with my life.
You're going to stay here, be here.
And I'm very happy about that.
Great.
Well, listen.
Have a wonderful life.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
What was so funny about that?
What just happened on the phone now?
Look at that.
Well, we haven't had a situation like that on the phone in months.
It must be Richard's doing something up there in the control room.
Look at that.
Like almost all just right there when she left.
All the lines were lit.
And I like most of them are gone.
Yeah, they're back.
See, they're back.
What happened to them?
Was that a glitch?
Is Southern Bell sabotaging our phones?
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.
Or is that electrician mucking around in the back there again?
Boy, that guy is dead.
There are phone guys in the buildings.
Yeah.
Oh, they're changing the phone system.
So all you people out there in the audience,
if you get disconnected or hung up on, don't get mad at us.
Don't blame us.
We're nice guys.
Lane these maniacs who are putting in this phone system.
Exactly.
I hope they really get, they are doing it.
And I hope they really get into what heavily like Friday,
because that's today my vacation starts.
And you want to have a wonderful time.
Aren't you going to be doing the show Friday?
Looks like it.
Great.
Well, I hope you have a ball here.
It ought to be a lot of fun.
Thanks.
What?
You're going to be doing some shows too, aren't you?
Like one at least.
Like one.
Well, that's not overdo it.
Yeah, Monday.
That's Monday.
Or maybe Tuesday.
Maybe you would be good on Tuesday, guys.
Yeah.
One of the other.
He could call up Bruce Williams and they could do a two-man show.
They could do...
Tell everybody, hey, get yourself an attorney.
Dumb Bruce Williams' joke.
That would be a good show.
Okay, here he is, Mr. Attorney himself.
Mr. Dumb joke himself.
Michael Wolfe with the headlines, world news from CBS at 11.
And we'll come back at 11.06.
There's lines in date.
I don't understand what's happening here this morning, do you?
They're just like, here one minute and they're all going the next.
It's like, well, a big crisis is over.
Screw him now.
You know, like, what kind of attitude is that?
Unbelievable.
6249400 and date.
And I have the greatest card in the history of all of our mail right here.
Cat recipes.
And on the front of the card, it shows a picture of a real ugly cat.
It says, from this to this.
And then it shows something on a cracker.
Easy to make, easy to bake, see recipes inside.
And you open up the card and the four recipes are for kitty fritters,
Kit and Canary Keesh, Curried Cat, and Rotisserie, Rotisserie Chinese Cat.
And to give you an idea, I want to give the cat lovers real excited.
The Rotisserie Chinese Cat.
It says, this is a splendid recipe developed for use with modern electric rotisseries
when done.
The cat should be crisp on the outside and almost jet black.
And it has the ingredients, 1.5 to 6 pound cat, salt and parsley to taste.
1.4 cup molasses, Chinese brands preferred.
1.5 cup of soy sauce, 1.4 cup of sherry, and a small clove of garlic.
1.1 wash and clean cat, being certain to dry well.
Well, inside and out, sprinkled the cat cavity with salt and insert the parsley.
Trace the cat securely, fold the legs under and tie close to the body.
Tie the hind legs together, then bring the tail across the chest and tie securely around the neck.
Make sure that all legs are tight so it's not to break off during cooking.
2. Combine remating ingredients in a saucepan and heat it up.
Flame for 5 minutes.
3. Insert spit rod through cat cavity, balancing it carefully.
And 4. Roast until tender about 2 hours, basting every 15 minutes.
When done, drumstick meat is tender when touched.
Oh boy, this is my favorite.
And I heard some old bag calling a Alice.
It was as only he had like 10 minutes in a show left yesterday.
It was the only call he could buy.
And she was going on a sued old bag from New York about...
Wow, she heard that some of these hosts don't like cats.
And only crude people don't like cats.
Those of us who love cats, I smear her.
Oh boy, she was great.
So I hope she's listening today.
And I hope she's got her microwave all worked up.
Let's go to sunrise. Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
How are you doing?
I'm a toy salesman.
And I keep hearing this sound in the background on your show today.
Yeah.
And I've got an interesting story about those little Richard and his father.
The guys won't touch them.
The girls love them.
They'll grab them.
They'll wind them up.
They'll watch them hot.
They'll scream.
But absolutely no reaction from the guys.
I know some guys who touch them.
Well, some guys.
I'm just in general speaking.
It's never 100%.
As you can tell, some of your listening audience,
Keperman Thompson.
Yeah.
But I'm in a 100% sport.
You go out things are going a lot better.
And keep up the good work.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Can't imagine why the women in South Florida would do that
because most of them are lesbian.
And anyway, we've already decided that.
So, well, maybe it's kind of an SNM thing.
Hollywood.
Hello.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just tuned in.
Wanted to see how the Big Power went this morning.
The upper echelon from up north.
Why didn't you tune in at 10 o'clock?
I was in my office working as soon as I got...
That's no excuse.
Just concerned.
Hello listeners.
And I'm saying it again.
Everything is just sensational.
They love me.
I have the full support and all of that other good stuff.
All right.
Well, I'm real glad to hear that.
There may be one or two things that we won't be hearing again,
but you know, life goes on.
That's right.
It's someone Neil Rogers is better not at all.
Exactly.
And that's what I told them.
I was going to ask you.
Did you...
Okay, good.
You put them in their place then.
Or did you have to?
Well, it was...
I described it as a spirited meeting.
I think that's a very diplomatic way of describing it, yeah.
Well, I'm real glad to hear it worked out.
And keep it up.
Keep doing a good job.
Okay.
We'll try.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay, bye.
12 minutes past 11 at WINZ, an open line in Broward.
524-9400.
Where did you know who disappeared to?
He's just erratic.
He just flies around like a butterfly.
In fact, there's a great recipe in here that I think he would really enjoy.
He could even be a part of it.
It's called Kit and Canary Keish.
It says this is very special pie.
Long a favorite in France is only now gaining popularity in America.
Maybe Sirvney, there is an appetizer or a lunch and dish.
And one of the ingredients for the recipe is one plucked and deboned canary,
which I think would be sensational.
Or maybe just a small vulture would do.
Kit and Canary Keish.
Did you hear the recipe for rotisserie Chinese cat?
Yes, I did.
Delicious.
They were trying to pluck me out in the hall.
Do you see this? From this to this.
Oh, you got to, I wish we had TV.
Easy to make, easy to bake.
From that ugly cat to a beautiful little dish.
And just a matter of minutes.
And you open the bottom of the card, has a big meow.
Some people are upset about this.
Are they really?
Oh, yeah.
We have cat lovers in the building?
Not in the building, but in the audience.
Oh, we've already gotten calls?
No.
But how do you know people are upset about it?
Trust me.
That old bag they'd call to Alice yesterday, she's upset.
There are some other radio stations in town.
You know, like stations where they play your voice?
Oh, yeah.
Which one could that be?
I don't know, but they may flip their noodle over this, huh?
In fact, maybe noodles ought to be flipped over very lightly,
and then breaded and cooked to a turn.
Oh, crisp turn.
God, I'd love to do that.
I like crisp stuff.
You know, like when you bake something like, I need like a,
you too.
Like prime rib when you get the end cut.
Exactly.
That's real crisp on the end, you know?
That's how I like my stuff cooked.
We have the microwave, the wind's microwave.
You don't have any food coming in your day, I hope.
No.
Thank God.
Don't need to go get some.
No.
Enough is enough already.
Oh, and by the way, I was in, you better write this on the log again,
for Ask God, he's last night.
Hmm.
Up there in Tamarack.
Yeah.
In that hillbilly kind of strip shopping center.
What a fine place that is.
And they're open for lunch now.
And they, you know, I just mentioned that in passing.
Because I pay when I go in here.
I don't get any freebies.
You can go to the bank on that.
But they're open for lunch now.
They told me and I thought I would mention that.
Is that okay?
I mean, they wrote it on the log.
Great.
And the FRASCATTIs.
FRASCATTIs.
My friends at FRASCATTIs are listening.
Maybe you could prepare some of these delicious delicacies that we've been reading about.
Like curried cat and kitty fritters.
You know, like on the lunch menu.
Some lighter fare, you know?
Because I saw a couple of real means.
You looking cats running around outside.
Maybe they can, you know, they don't get me.
Absolutely.
Sure beats po folks.
I'll tell you that.
Miami Beach.
Hello.
Oh, Neil.
Yes.
Did you know that the American Christian course is sending out patitions to stop ABC, CBS, and NBC?
It's a world on godly values.
It's things that picture, I think it has the um, um, um, um, thumbnail and he gets drunk and they're against it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, it's a sure appreciate the information.
Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Oh, this is great.
I've been trying to call you to support your cause.
And I also wanted to know if you got my letter with the clipping from the Anchorage Alaskan newspaper.
I sure did.
Boy, we made it all the way to Anchorage and that in the underthole didn't even know what my name was.
Well, I guess he didn't want to give you that much publicity.
publicity, yeah.
But I thought it was real interesting.
We were on a big single in Anchorage.
We were also in a little town called Homer, which is, you know, as you would expect in Alaska, it's a little fishing village.
And we're having breakfast and behind us.
There were people from Howondale.
Wow.
And we turned around really fast to see if the sweet and low is disappearing.
I bet you that's where all that Alaska and Silverware came from.
What were you doing in the Laskan, then?
It was a vacation.
Oh, yeah, I used to live up there, you know.
Really?
No.
I lived there for two years.
Are you serious?
That's what it was.
Fair banks.
There are a lot of birds nesting out there.
See, when you live in a real super cold weather for long enough, it freezes up parts of your brain and never throw out again.
Maybe it helps you keep longer.
It does.
It's a better.
Yeah.
Exactly.
It's like sometimes here in this studio, like we're aging meat in here or something.
Well, Glenn, have you tried any of those sunflower seeds yet?
No answer.
He's just, what are you talking about?
He just giggling.
That was in my letter, too, about the kind of bird seeds that help birds to chirp more effectively.
No, I haven't tried any yet.
I think some of those would be great in that curried cat recipe that would have been perfect.
Others have thought, yeah, with a parsley and the curried powder.
And a few sesame seeds.
They would be great.
Anyway, I'm going to make a tape with my bird.
Yesterday he was listening to you and he was just chirping away like crazy and whistling and dang his name over and over again.
What is his name?
My bird's name?
Boy George.
He's quite a bird.
Boy George.
I bet he rides his bird side saddle, huh?
Sometimes.
So the message coming on the screen, they are requesting.
What is this request hour again?
Oh, they want to hear the crepitation coming up.
I haven't had time to put that on tape.
I was in a meeting until two minutes before I came on the air.
Do we dare play that tomorrow?
Okay, yeah.
Tomorrow.
When he's safely on the air.
There's nothing wrong with that record.
It's funny.
I just got a few sounds in it like there's nothing wrong with it.
I heard part of it.
It's hilarious.
Oh, it's incredible.
Well, I just wanted to congratulate you on winning and...
On winning what?
Well, you get to stay here.
Oh, is that winning or is that losing?
I think that's debatable to be honest with you.
I thought you liked South Florida.
I'm not going anywhere.
I do like it here.
I love it.
The climate is great and the people are so friendly and so sociable.
Nice.
Great.
There's so courteous.
But it's so progressive here.
We've got a wonderful governor and the politicians are also sharp and it's great.
I like the way how courteous everyone is on the expressway.
Exactly.
And they all are such expert drivers here.
It's great.
What the hell could anybody want?
I don't know.
You know what I'm saying?
In LA, they shoot each other.
Exactly.
Precisely.
It's the only thing we're missing.
I used to do that here.
That'll be next week, probably.
We like to copy anything they do in California.
Well, all the trends start out there.
You bet.
Yeah.
Okay, well, listen.
Yeah, it hurts.
That's what the comment is.
It hurt.
Well, have a wonderful day and a great life.
And we'll see you on the SagaRas Expressway.
Okay.
Bye.
See, that's a good thing on us.
We're going to be on the SagaRas Expressway.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Especially only if you like scallops.
I didn't read in line with it a little bit, too.
You're picking them up and trying to find this place there.
The one that I haven't learned today is a walk.
different aspects to the question like where am I going?
Yeah well up until up until like an hour and a half ago I didn't even know for sure what
to do you know.
That's why we haven't and John and his mother are going to Hawaii and we hope they have
a wonderful time.
We spoke to him this morning and the reason that it's not all planned out is because it
vacillated.
I mean it was it was changing from day to day one day you were going next to you weren't
going.
It hurts.
So I waited until this until all the dust settled it hurt.
And it's going to all fall together.
Don't worry.
We'll work on it the rest of this week everything will be fine.
Life will go on.
It'll be okay.
But where am I going?
That will be a good question for the audience wouldn't it?
You were going to postpone there's several people in there who have a suggestion.
I'm not postponing anything.
Okay.
I said that on the year in a moment of I know crisis in a moment of crisis you don't run
away in the middle of a crisis.
I know.
If we were still in the middle of a full blown crisis then I would stay.
I know.
And we're not.
Okay.
Crisis has passed.
It will be fine.
Everybody loves me.
I'll do Friday shows like when a general manager of baseball team gives like when George
Steinbrenner gives his manager a vote of confidence.
Yeah.
And like three days later they get fired.
Spindell is going to do Saturday.
Oh boy.
Can I reconsider this?
Only kidding Mike.
Why is he so sensitive?
Why doesn't he cut that out?
Mike Wolf is going to do a show.
If Tom Jekyll gets back from LA in time he's going to do a show.
And what if he doesn't?
Then he won't.
Good thinking.
How about Linda Thornton?
She could do a show.
I don't think she wants to.
I don't think she wants to come into this.
No.
No, I don't.
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask her.
That hurt.
I just kidding around Linda.
I'll ask her.
I think you have so much BS that it's unbelievable.
One day you're telling me she just fine.
Everything is fine.
She loves you.
She does.
Everything's great.
Everything's copious.
I was just kidding.
She wrote that great article last week that Gary got hysterical about about the FM
doing talk and all this.
She does laugh.
Wild, the reason so on.
She loves you.
So what's the problem?
There is no problem.
I was just joking.
Honest.
See now I know what the audience means when they're not sure if I'm joking or if I'm serious
because of you that's the convenient cop-up.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're the one who makes them outrageous.
You're the one.
You're the one who's the human statement.
You're the one who's the human.
And then oh, I was just joking.
I was.
When he gets caught with a nervous cackle.
I was just kidding around.
So that's like a couple of shows and what else?
Who else are you going to bring in here?
We can replay the best of Colonel North.
That's a couple of days we're going to do that.
No, we're not.
No, my dead body will do that again.
Who knows what'll happen.
It'll be all right.
It'll all fall together.
Sure.
Bring a couple of people off the street.
We're going to go there.
We're going to go there.
We're going to go there.
We're going to go there.
The K-Mart.
I think Bobby's going to do a show.
Bobby could do a show.
Of course.
In fact, he's coming in tomorrow.
I can start my vacation early.
That's right.
I wouldn't I would not be away from here that one.
Bobby, come here.
Who else would you like?
He's a good guy.
Yeah, I know.
Who else would you like to do the show?
It's all he is.
He's a good guy.
He's a good friend.
That's all it is.
I know.
I'll call Michelle.
Unfortunately.
This afternoon I'll call Michelle.
She'd like to do a show.
Good.
Of course.
And Bishop could do a show.
Who are some of our other people?
He could do a show on truck driving.
It's a topic we've never touched on this show.
I wonder why.
It's a noodle for cat.
I think he'll be in Friday.
Donald could come in and do a show with this.
Oh, we would love that.
Oh, you bet.
He has a crush on this show.
I know.
He does.
You specifically.
Not me.
I think he's been crushed by that show.
That's another story.
I think they're crushing themselves.
They're just really disorganized.
Well, he is no help.
Far be it for me to talk about other shows in the market.
However.
Let's take a call from Lighthouse Point.
Maybe they got some good ideas for my vacation.
Hello.
Hey, yeah.
I was calling about the Crepitation Contest.
But you already answered that, but I don't want to hang up.
Yeah.
I really apologize because I had every intention to play it today.
But it's about a 15 or even a 20-minute cut.
And it's got to go on a cassette.
Right.
And I was tied up in that monumental meeting
until about two minutes after 10 and came rushing in here.
So.
Well, I first heard that about 16 years ago.
You know how old that is?
And I was about 20 years.
20 years old.
No, it's from 1933.
Are you kidding?
It's like 54 years old.
I can't believe it, but that's what they said.
It is so funny.
And all of you out there on radio, man.
If you're driving down 95 when he plays it.
Oh, well, the dubby on the floor is hysterical.
A previous year's winner is disqualified at the end
because let's say he had a run of bad luck.
Yeah.
And I'm looking forward to hearing it.
OK.
Tomorrow for sure.
Any idea what time?
I guess I'll just listen all day.
How's that?
OK, that's a good idea.
OK.
Thanks.
Nancy needs one.
Oh, bumper stickers.
OK, well, I'm not even smoking a cigar.
And I'm smoking.
It's catching from major.
You notice how he chokes on the year all the time?
I keep telling the man.
Enough with it.
One thing to smoke a little, a nice, extra light mild cigar.
But he smokes these big, disgusting gut rotting.
Oh, like smoking an H-bomb.
Yeah, those of you who have ever seen those footlong hot dogs
that they've got.
And don't start getting carried away.
That's what those cigars look like.
I mean, those are just bombs is what they are.
And all during the show, you hear him, you know,
what is he going to cut it out?
And today he's at the throat doctor of all things.
Shame on you, Stan.
Miami Beach, hello.
Hello, Daniel. How are you?
OK.
I'll take on the bread.
When he takes off, he's running around from one branch
to another.
I know, flitting around.
He's flitting, right.
Just nail the headhands, just to take it to any indication
of the frozen cons, you know, the telephone calls and the letters.
Oh, I didn't ask him that because I don't care about that.
I'm not interested in that.
I mean, the, you know, only barometer are the ratings
and the number of people who are listening to the show.
I don't care about that.
But they obviously were overwhelmingly favorable.
Yeah, because I called up and I sent a letter and I...
Well, I appreciate that.
They wanted KAT and they couldn't do that to me.
Take you off the air.
Yeah.
Alison, did anybody ever tell you about Mr. Ego
once who engaged you in a debate?
And if need be, he'll come to your studio to do so.
Boy, you talk about desperation.
You know, Mr. Ego, I hear through the...
In fact, this is something we were going to get into yesterday
and it slipped my mind.
One of the rumors I was talking about.
But the rumor is that Mr. Ego is not too happy over there
in the aisle of, you know what?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Well...
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Oh, he's disgusting.
I remember him from Orlando where he's...
This fly down a free job.
Just had it lucky when he came here.
Well, you know, he just...
He had it lucky because he moved into a station
that already had a well-established audience
and he benefited from that.
And because he helped the average, I'll give him a job.
Yeah.
Right?
And with no competition, he didn't even get a decent writing
or a job.
Exactly.
And now things are not so rosy over there.
So I think that in spite of all of that money,
he's going to find that the short term
may not have been such a great idea.
Neil, do you have any idea how low this contract is?
Three years.
Three years?
Yeah.
Two hundred big ones?
Well, don't be so sure about that part of it.
Well, they'll rule the day.
I guarantee you.
Well, when the next book comes out,
there are going to be a lot of people ruling the day.
Yeah. Right.
So he wants to debate me on what?
He didn't say, but he just would like to debate you.
Yeah.
Tell him there's a fat chance.
He's in danger to come over to your studio.
Oh, sure.
He's inviting himself kind of like Jack Sullivan.
He wants...
or Jack Thompson.
He wants to invite himself on the show.
Well, I knew you wouldn't do it.
And if you ever did, you would thank me.
No way.
You're sorry for that.
Okay.
Thanks very much, and I'm glad you're here at New State of Sweden.
Forever.
Life is wonderful.
Right.
Okay. See you later.
Hello.
For a lottery.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Congratulations, but you're still here.
I'm glad you're coming.
Thank you.
Well.
Thank you.
How about that?
Yeah, I think it's wonderful.
I've found a few couple of questions, though.
You could have gone anywhere you wanted at this point.
I think if things had gone to the worst.
Well, I kind of indicated that to them, yes.
But you keep saying how quote unquote wonderful
the Miami South Florida area is.
I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.
Don't put words in my mouth.
Well, then you were saying how great everything was
and how courteous the driver is.
I was being sarcastic about that.
You took that seriously?
I know you were being sarcastic.
Oh, OK.
It's still here.
If you could have gone anywhere.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad you're here.
I just wanted to know why you were.
Because I like the weather.
I lived up north for 30 years.
And I don't like that weather.
I can't handle it.
I really can't.
And after you've lived in Florida for a few years,
your blood thinned out.
Oh, yes.
And when you go back up north and you're,
just a couple of those chilly days,
you're like on a verge of pneumonia.
And I don't think I could survive that again.
Yeah.
And I was from New York myself.
You know, all the young people that were born here
and have grown up here and lived most of their lives,
or all of their lives here,
they don't know how lucky they are.
I mean, they have missed a lot of other things,
but as far as the climate is concerned,
and far as the wear and tear on your body,
well, I'll tell you that's a killer.
One of the questions, though,
my husband wants to know that if he could send in a blank tape,
he'll pay any amount of money,
like, you know, he'll pay money to have any of the banned,
quote unquote, banned, so...
No, he doesn't have to pay money.
He just haven't sent us a cassette.
We got a whole bunch of stuff we'll put on there for him.
Oh, wonderful.
He especially wants to hear the I-95.
It's on there.
Shall I say the word?
Sure.
Okay, I'll say it.
He wants to hear the I-95 at all.
It's on there.
But, um...
Okay.
So, where do I send a tour?
Can I just get the address off the phone booker?
No, W-I-N-Z.
Uh-huh.
Miami.
3-3-0-5-5.
3-3-0-5.
And just put attention to the bird.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
And, um, glad you're back.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks so much.
Thank you so much.
You're one of the best things to happen to radio down here, bar none.
Thanks.
Okay, bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
24-till-noon at W-I-N-Z.
Look at all this good stuff.
What is that?
Oh, that...
Now, that is dirty.
Okay, we can't describe that.
That's for Stan.
No, no.
This one's for Stan.
Another one.
This is...
You don't wear this around your neck, do you?
The keychain, isn't it?
Oh, it's a keychain.
Isn't that cute?
Boy, they're doing dirty things in there.
We're not going to talk about that.
See, we don't do that stuff on this show.
And so, why do we take it to call their for luck?
And look what they're doing.
Oh, now this one is cute.
Look at that.
Oh, it moves.
It's a moving one.
And they're doing some wild stuff on this, uh, whatever this is on this keychain.
Look at that.
Now, who is this for?
Oh, you?
Who's for me to take the call their for good luck?
And where's the one for Stan?
That one's for me, and here Stan is still excellent.
Oh, that's the one that's got nobody on the other end of it.
Just Stan.
Okay, let's take a break.
It's 23 before noon at WINZ and we'll come right back.
20 minutes before noon.
We have another break this hour, right?
No, that's it.
We did it all.
Boy, he is just so efficient.
Efficient?
I mean, almost to a fault.
Only kidding now, just kidding.
Cheerful and efficient.
Exactly.
We have a letter here to you, which is really astonishing from the desk of John Sipriano in Boka.
Yep.
Mr. Glenn Hill, WINZ, Miami, Dear Mr. Hill, I am a Paul at these sleazy jokes that have been aired about.
Pope John Paul II by your blank, this jockey, Neil Rogers.
I do not listen to your radio station and would have not have known of this scum had I not read it in the newspaper.
I will write to the advertisers and let them know how I feel as well.
Sign John Sipriano Boka Raton.
I do like that.
Doesn't even listen to the station allegedly.
Red something in the newspaper.
And now it's going to write letters to the advertisers.
I'm sure the advertisers are really concerned about people who don't even listen to the station.
I mean, that's clout.
You know what I'm saying?
Now, what sleazy stuff about the Pope?
The pubs, pubs, stop.
God gave him the grace.
The pubs, pubs, stop.
He likes his smoking mask.
Okay.
Well, this call from Boka could be Mr. Sipriano.
Hello, John.
Oh, assistant John.
Okay, sorry.
Okay.
Well, I've taken a chance.
I don't have the intensity to John does.
Okay.
I'm Paul.
Are you a Paul?
Yes, I'm definitely a Paul.
And I'm Peter Mary and John II.
Good.
Hey, I like Glenn.
I think he's a great addition to the show.
Well, nobody's perfect.
I'm all disappointed in the OLO.
I think that as far as Gilbert's concern, I think he kind of gave in to him.
On what?
Well, I think I see, you know, I've listened to you for, you know, I guess services have been down here.
At night time and on the daytime.
I think, you know, over the last couple of weeks, you've been talking about the situation with Maine.
Everybody's right.
And there's a lot of letters and you talk about this big meeting.
And I think that you came out of the meeting and I get the impression just in listening to you that you had to give in to a lot of their demands.
On what?
See the tone.
I just did.
On what?
The tone of the show is not what it was.
Why just, I think.
The tone of the show is not what it was.
I've just come back from about three days of almost a nervous breakdown.
I understand.
And I'm trying to come back and do some kind of sense of humanity.
And you're telling me the tone isn't what it was and what respect.
Oh, it's different.
Well, I think first of all, you know, they've eliminated a lot of your card.
You know, you can't play a lot of it.
Like how many?
How many?
Well, I can't count them.
I don't know.
I just don't know.
Only two that I know of.
Well, I think there's a lot of them and you're not going to be able to play that.
Like what?
What would you like to hear?
Like what?
Here the I-95.
No, that's one of the two.
Oh, okay.
I mean, two cards are not going to make the whole show.
This show is on long before we ever played that record.
Well, I just think that, you know, I came down from New York and, you know,
Man, I got to the point I was in top management.
I wasn't a CEO, but I was in top management.
Yeah.
And they always beat you down.
And I finally started my own business.
And I just think.
Well, I'm ready.
Listen, if you want to underwrite it, I'm a great fan of yours.
Obviously.
And I just think that these, these, these people in the top management,
you know, they're going to win because they own the goddamn thing.
Well, there's no question about that.
I mean, you know, you can compromise to a point, but in the long run,
they've got the upper hand.
They own it.
Yeah. Well, that's, that's the bottom line.
If they say it's a shame because I think, you know, I, you,
But I don't think there's any shame.
I don't think we've lost anything.
I mean, it was, first of all, the I-95 record was played eight million times.
I understand that.
And if it's the difference between that,
am I just starting all over again someplace else?
I'm not going to worry about that.
I mean, if, if my whole career was hanging on that record,
then I wouldn't have very much going for me.
I understand that.
And certainly it's not all I'm saying is, is I just see a difference in the tone.
And it's going to over the course of the next couple of weeks.
You know, I'm going to see it, but I just want to listen.
I just saying that I don't see any difference in the course of the tone of the show.
I mean, you know, in fact, I'm, it almost is like I'm back in that meeting again
because what got me upset was like kept hearing these generalities
and I kept asking for specifics and he couldn't give me any.
And you're doing the same thing about the tone.
The tone.
What is it we're not talking about?
Yeah.
I mean, you know, the fact is I didn't go to Windixie last night
so I didn't have, I don't have any stories to tell today, you know.
Right.
But if I had something to tell you, it would be there, believe me.
I think it's too early to panic, sir.
Okay.
Well, no, let's all panic.
I enjoy when everybody panic.
It's a lot of fun.
I mean, I'm not panicking.
Well, why not?
Come on, it would be a lot of fun if we could all panic.
Oh, now you don't have to start getting smart at it.
I'm not smart.
I'm just having some fun with you.
Now, don't mind getting upset.
You're getting upset.
You're getting up tight.
I think that's a sound remark that he makes.
It's too early to make a decision about it.
I just noticed just in the last two days.
I know two or three days ago this, this, this,
Sentai, real上 is the rest of your life.
The black guy is going to be a guy like Robert and this guy
too, though,
Like that like POW,
You're the guy playing the staple game and the rest of the day,
until there's a good choice.
This one, I don't think they know—
Shorty Heirs,
meaning the satan player.
Longer chance.
Right.
I know you, I, and Z let's all panic. Come on. The show has been different the last couple days.
Well, yeah, I'll probably go today because we've been didn't even know what the hell was going on.
But now the crisis is thinking about over and changing underwear a lot.
We're going to go back to know we are back. Now we're going to put on our old underwear.
Exactly. So don't come near the building.
Let's let's go to high a Leah. Hello.
Deal. Yes. Are you okay?
Okay. Okay.
What happened there? You had your fingers somewhere where it couldn't hit that button right away.
You didn't hear what he said? Well, he was on hold. No, it wasn't on the ear.
You heard on hold. But we're not on here. Hold on. Yeah.
Okay. So you had the quick finger. Oh, yeah. Let's not get into that.
Sure. Let me ask you, Glenn. How you doing? Great. Is this deep throat?
No, not at all. Orlando. Remember? Orlando. Tony, Tony Orlando.
And how's done? No relation.
And when you got me the latest number, we talked a long time ago. Oh, sure.
Yeah. I said, uh, Neil, listen. I want to. Oh, yeah. I know who this is. Orlando.
By the way, I put in the good word for you. Great.
I'm going to look at this one moves too. Did you see that?
I can't believe it. We're looking at these key chains. Boy, I bet you'd like one of these.
Oh, yeah. I've seen those before. They do some wild thing.
I had a match. Yeah. Yeah. Neil is a safe to say that.
And if you do, if you do them long enough, your key pops right off the chain.
I can't believe it. Yeah. The crisis has passed.
Is it really? Yeah. That's good because I was in a panic stage myself.
But I was way down and brown. I just didn't get a chance to get off the car and give you
a good. Well, anytime I get into brown, I go into a panic stage.
And for us living there, you know, that explains a lot.
For me, both. Yeah. I'm glad to hear that. Everything is fine.
Well, let me ask you a question. Do you think the tone of the show has changed?
Not at all. Not at all. In fact, I was glad to hear that.
Everything is just the way it used to be. I think so. Yeah.
The last caller, I think, is a little bit premature.
Yeah, you can see him. I think he got a wrapped up in himself before he knew he was going
way off the handle. Yeah. He got carried away.
Yeah. Well, he's emotional, you know.
Yeah. And I don't worry about you guys doing a heck of a job.
In fact, I think it would have been a panic stage if those people had done what they wanted
to do, you know, as far as banning whatever you're doing.
I think everybody want to really go off the deep six.
Yeah. I was ready for it. Well, if the guy thinks the tone has changed,
I'm going to solve that because it's known.
I'm going into the W. I. N. Z. Kitchen. Yeah.
And we have one machine that's got food that's guaranteed to make you sick.
Okay. And there's one thing that's in there too.
But I've got better than that. I got the W. I. N. Z.
Meatball mozzarella sandwich.
They're right back in the microwave of all of your favorite cat.
And I'm going to tell you those things make me so sick that I could just go.
So that'll make it better for him. Great.
Aaron T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T.
You got it. Let me ask you. You know, I was thinking in memory of Mr. Jack Thompson,
which is kind of like a fool every time I heard him on the radio.
I was thinking about taking my dog and shaving his rear end,
making a picture and making a commemorative pose.
That would be great. I think we probably get some artist out there to make a big poster
there to do something cute with it. So to speak.
Yeah, we need something to remember Jack by.
Yeah, that would be good.
I think that will work out well.
In fact, I think he might even like it so much.
You could turn him into business cards.
Probably. Yeah.
For all of his clients, you bet.
Exactly. You know, they probably would recognize themselves too.
Yeah.
Well, gentlemen, it's a pleasure hearing both of you.
And I'm glad to hear that everything is going to go just like it's been going.
Well, we'll get the tone changed back.
No, no, no, no.
I'm going to lie out in the sun and get my tone, you know, like,
the way a light chalk with, you know.
By the way, you're taking off Friday, you're going on vacation?
Yeah, I'm going away.
Where do you think would be a good place to go?
How about New Orleans?
I'd not be bad for a couple of days.
I heard it flooding around that, it wasn't it?
It's hot and the real hot.
It's heard.
It's heard.
Oh, I'll pass on that.
I don't want to spoil my image.
Okay, have a great day.
Thank you both.
Good luck.
Bye bye.
Now, where would be a good place?
I know, every time I bring this thing up, boy,
it goes over like a pregnant pool vault around a hot July day in New Orleans.
They just will not talk about it.
Well, this is not a traveling crowd.
No, you got to understand that the traveling people are all gone.
They're all out of time right now.
A lot of our younger people have gone off to school.
You do realize that Stan mentioned that to me the other day.
And it's a good point.
We have lost a lot of that younger crowd.
It's gone off to college.
In fact, yesterday there were a couple of people who called to say goodbye.
So if any of our young listeners, our college age type listeners
want to call in to say, audio, sorry, we've been there.
And we can wish them good luck.
They'll be back.
They'll tell them to reconsider.
They'll be back.
I mean, what kind of loyalty is that?
Why don't they stick around and support this show?
This is much more important.
I mean, who the hell needs them going off to Tallahassee in Gainesville?
It's like the silly people.
Auburn, Mississippi.
Can you see going to school in Auburn, Mississippi?
Or is it on Alabama?
Is it on Alabama?
Auburn.
Is Alabama?
No, I don't even know.
I think so.
Or is it Mississippi?
What have to call up Chris and find out?
Auburn, Mississippi.
Yeah, I think so.
That's what I originally said.
Yeah, it doesn't sound right.
Auburn, Alabama.
I don't know.
They both sound right.
I know.
They both.
Well, yeah, they're both the same anyway.
Who cares?
They're like Florida.
Yeah.
I want any young person want to go off there.
Somebody went to Auburn?
Auburn.
Somebody went there.
Alabama.
Bert Jones went there, I think.
No, he went to LSU.
But that's the same thing.
That's like in Baton Rouge, isn't it?
Baton Rouge is in Mississippi.
No, that's in Louisiana.
It's the capital.
Boy, it's the key.
Right.
Let's do a geography lesson with the bird.
I'm all met.
When the bird flies over your house,
I think he's back in Alaska, folks.
He's just a totally lost.
The Baton Rouge, Mississippi.
One of my favorites.
It's like Louisville, Ohio.
It's another one of my favorite cities.
Or Rochester, Texas.
It's another one of my real favorites.
In Batavia, Michigan.
The cities I work at.
Kalamazoo, Wisconsin.
Another message.
Miami Cuba.
Very good.
A van of Florida.
My suggestions.
Where to go?
Yeah.
The Atlantic City.
Forget it.
Our use.
Oh, I mean, if I could put my foot down my throat,
not just my finger.
That is the, have you ever been there?
Never.
Okay.
See, here's the guy.
Like he ought to be a travel agent, okay?
He thinks Baton Rouge is in Mississippi.
He wants you to go to Atlantic cities.
He's never been there in his life.
Why don't you give us a little critique on the racetrack, too?
You have such expertise in that area.
I've been at the racetrack.
Yeah, I know.
Baham.
Probably in the aviary.
How about the Baham?
He's been in the aviary with the flamingos at Highly.
That was his trip to the racetrack.
Forget the Baham.
Oh, I'll rip off city.
I'm not going there.
Even for this nice little booze thing they sent,
I'm not going there.
Plus Vegas.
Vegas is a possibility.
But you can only go to Vegas for like two,
maybe three days at the most.
Maybe, unless you get lucky.
And if I got out, you're lucky.
I wouldn't stay there.
All of the great thing about Vegas,
you can go to Seasors and you go to the sportsbook
and have all the tracks.
Mm-hmm.
And all the racing forms and you sit there
and you can even bet Calder there.
I know.
Oh, boy, that's heaven.
Been on Hollywood Park and the fairground.
You will consider Vegas.
You'll take it under the Great Race course.
Arlington.
You'll take it under the consideration.
In fact, the Arlington Million is coming up.
Isn't it from Chicago?
On September 6th, I think you can see embedded at Calder.
And since we gave you a job of gold in the
Traverse Saturday, I won't be here though then.
No, that's so you're on your own.
All you handicampers out there, you're on your own.
Now listen, I want you to get out to Calder today.
Have a great day.
There's no racing.
We just get out there and relax.
Get some sunshine.
You can't lose it, dime.
And Calder, but you can't get in the gate either.
But just kind of hang around by the front gate
and just we can all have a big.
We got a box lunch out there at the holiday in.
All the Calder crowd waiting for tomorrow for post time.
That's great to me.
And I think Mike and Zalas has got eight mounts tomorrow.
Maybe Michael call in today.
Boy, he is, I'm so proud of Mike and Zalas.
Boy, he is just great.
Now he didn't have a great day's Sunday, but listen,
had a lot of seconds.
And then of course the one race I bet against him, he won it.
Again, he did that to me again.
He always does that.
I had like a six one or something.
Whatever the numbers were perfected.
And here the six nine and here come the two horses
and you shouldn't use those numbers.
But that's what they were into the stretch in the lead.
Okay, all alone.
And here comes Mike and Zalas with a two from nowhere
and just, you know, beats me.
Shame on you, Mike.
Halondale, hello.
Yeah.
How you doing today?
Great.
We look like everything worked out for you.
It's a pleasure meeting to be concerned.
Yeah, we're still here, sir.
They still can't get us out of the door.
No, I called yesterday, but what I'm trying to say
is like, you know, you've been doing it for like three days.
They asked all your disappointments as far as the corporate's
concerned, you know.
And you had your meeting this morning.
And don't you think you're cutting your audience
a little short as far as what happens to you?
You know, and how things are going to work out for you in the future?
Well, what does that mean?
I mean, what would you like to know?
I thought in the beginning.
You know, you said all the things that were bothering you
as far as corporate's concerned and their demands upon yourself
and how you might go to like a different station down here.
Yeah.
So now everything's teachers and creative and I'm wondering
what did they say to you to make you so happy all of that?
Well, we had we thrashed it all out.
I said it was a very, what was the word that I used?
A very, um, it is good.
There's going to be something that's, you know,
like going to come back to you in the future.
Well, I don't have a crystal ball, but I mean, for right now,
they're supportive and they understand where I'm coming from.
And they're going to leave me alone.
That's all that.
Bearded spirited conversation.
Yeah, we had it out.
That's a good way to put it.
We had it out.
No, it's not still.
Look, let me say something to you.
And you were, do you have, do you have your, listen to me?
Listen to me.
Do you have your own business?
No, I'm the guy that calls me a diplomat.
Well, yesterday, okay.
So you work for somebody else?
All right.
Okay.
Now, anytime in life when you work for somebody else,
and I've said this consistently, you are subject to their whims.
I mean, if they wake up one day and they decide that we want to play a Chinese
melodies on this radio station, they own it.
So I don't have any crystal ball, but I have no reason to believe that that's
going to happen.
They swore.
I think they need to.
You don't need that.
Well, that's what I told them.
That's exactly what I told you.
You know, to keep you there.
I think they got that message.
I don't know if I'm trying to find out.
And as a matter of fact, Mr. Gilbertson said to me, we were talking about the
Pope, and he said, if I were doing the show, I would, you know, attack this,
and I wouldn't attack the Pope personally.
I said, you're not doing the show.
I said, if you want to go in there and do it, go ahead.
I'll sit in here and you go in there and do it.
So it's an up and effect.
They do need you.
And the fact is that he's not doing the show.
Although I would pay to listen to that.
I would love to hear him do the show, but I'm going to be monitoring anymore.
Well, I think, I think Jack will be monitoring.
OK, well, I wish you the best in the future.
Everything's kosher. Trust me.
OK, very good.
Thank you.
A lot.
We're monitoring you out here.
All the priests have their little transistor radios under their robes.
And they're twisting their knobs frantically.
What's that what they're doing there?
Well, that's a good excuse.
Oh, I was just adjusting my Sony, my Walkman.
That's what they all say at the rectory.
Can we say a rectory?
Well, I'm not so sure that might be actionable.
I'm not so sure.
I bet you they got big closets in those rectories.
You think so?
And if you go in there like in the middle of the night, open up the door.
Is boy, all these people fall off.
Probably even a few alter boys in there too.
Just in case of emergencies.
There's another fallen Catholic there.
Major's a fallen Catholic and Mr. Wolf over there is a fallen again after we put you in the bathtub upside down for an hour.
You can be baptized to be a Catholic too.
I love that baptizing stuff for that's my favorite.
Some of these wild nuts, you know, they take you out to like the ocean or they do.
He's laughing.
It's true.
They take you like to the nearest body of water.
You're like to assess pool.
Whatever it is.
And immediately they don't you in there.
And now all of a sudden you're your kosher, you know.
Here comes a message they miss the dirty.
Oh, this ought to be good.
The dirty songs.
Oh, that's good.
What dirty songs?
We don't play dirty songs.
Oh, that's great.
I just got you with a whole like 45 minutes this morning.
We don't do dirty stuff.
And now we got people calling and we they missed the dirty songs.
That one record you see, I will rule the day that I ever played that on the air.
Because now they can't live without it.
Where are those dirty songs?
OK, we'll try to find you some during the news.
OK, Mike Scott the headline CBS has the very clean, straightforward news.
It's known and we'll come back and find you some smut at 1206.
So please look at this from this to this.
This is great.
These are.
Did you hear me read that one on the air?
Yeah, I heard that.
Rotisserie Chinese cat.
I like my favorite though is the kid in Canary Keesh.
I bet you could substitute a vulture for the Canary.
No problem.
I'm going to tell you an incredible story.
Please, it just happened to me only moments ago as yes, absolutely about that within the last 30 minutes.
Great.
When you were reading that cat thing, I was parked outside.
I had to go into publics to get my prescription filled into publics to get your prescription filled.
Right.
And when I came out, wait a minute.
Since when does publics fill prescriptions?
The big one over there by a cemetery village.
They do?
Yeah.
Boy, I bet they do a land office business, huh?
Oh, sure.
Wow.
Anyway, I was coming out of publics and I saw this really good looking brunette.
And so I got in the car and she was going around the shopping center.
And so I kind of, you know, I was in my car and I thought, well, I'll just drive around here and see.
And maybe she works in one of those places.
I'll check her out later.
So I drove around the way that I wait a minute.
Let's slow down.
You were following her around the shopping center.
She was walking and I were following her.
I was in my car and I was ready to come to work.
Okay.
Yeah.
But instead of going out the parking lot, the way I would normally go, I just kind of went around the corner of the shopping area to see what store she went in.
Guess what store she went in and guess who she probably is?
There is a veterinary clinic there called the cat house.
And she walked, she unlocked the door.
Yeah.
She unlocked the door and went in.
Isn't that incredible?
And all the time you're doing this recipe.
Yeah, that's how he is.
That isn't that something.
Isn't that something psychic there?
The cat house.
You should have gone inside and said, what's cooking?
Well, I'm going to book her on the show.
I'm going to book her on a two o'clock and we're going to talk.
Where are you talking about cats?
It to retaliate against you.
How wonderful cats are because I love cats.
You obviously love cats.
Desperate man.
No.
No.
Desperate.
No.
Doesn't have anything to do with the fact that she's, she smiled at me and she's a lovely brunette.
Has nothing to do with that.
Of course.
Well, I was done.
I've been before.
Yeah.
Boy, and this is just loaded up with that.
And you were witnessed by the way you saw.
I wasn't lying.
I ate one of those meatball among Parmesan sandwiches.
Yeah.
Boy, within about a half hour, I'm going to be so
sick.
Well, this will kill the ten if I had a couple of those boy, they'll really put me into like
diabetic coma.
See the throat doctor sprayed something in my throat.
So you're okay.
Don't have throat cancer.
I don't.
He's very good.
Can I mention his name?
Well, we'll have it.
We'll write it on the log as soon as we get off with this doctor.
We're talking about there.
Dr. Duncan.
As in Duncan Donuts.
David Duncan.
As in Duncan Donuts.
In sunrise on Oakland Park Boulevard.
Boy, is he good?
Did you write that on the log?
He is good.
Dr. Duncan.
And he put me on K-Flex.
And then he doctor that puts me on K-Flex, I love.
Yeah, because you're hooked on that stuff.
Great.
Very expensive.
$28.
You and Elvis, boy, prescription drugs.
Prescription drugs.
Shame on you.
Double cheese.
Duracef.
What are those?
Can I take a couple of those?
Are they good?
OK, let's go to, I'll tell you what.
I'll take one or two of those, and then I'll drink one of these.
More Bahamas Survival Kit.
Miami, hello.
Yeah, Neil.
How you doing?
I'm fine.
How are you doing?
Great.
Good.
First of all, that song of the remake really doesn't do the angels justice at all.
I disagree with you.
I think it's a lot better than the angels.
Really?
Yeah.
No, not at all.
Anyway, well, I'm going back to school tomorrow, so I want to check in.
But I want to be listening to you.
Where is that?
I haven't had my walkman between classes.
Oh, I see another way to go to school here.
Right, I have one more year of Miami Dayed left.
Is it Auburn in Alabama or is it Mississippi?
I believe it's Alabama.
See, we're not sure now.
I don't know.
No.
I really don't know.
Who the hell would want to go there anyway, right?
God knows.
I will after Miami Dayed, I'm totally getting out of Florida,
but I'm not going to Alabama.
No way.
OK, with a banjo on your knee.
Well, it's in best of luck, and we'll see you.
OK.
OK, dear field, hello.
Yeah, dear.
Neil.
Yeah.
I know last week you took a pole that you would about the weather,
keep the you bet, really birds.
Yeah.
And now he lost in a pole.
And I can't understand.
You know, he still comes in every morning.
And he knows a funny thing, Neil.
But now he hear him.
I get so nervous, so upset.
Good.
I broke my radio.
I'll send you the bill.
Sir, I love him.
You love him?
Yeah, I love him.
I think he's a smart guy.
I think he's fantastic, even if I am sitting in his chair.
You think he's a one?
You know what?
You know what a smart guy is.
A schmendrick.
A schmendrick.
It's a funny thing, Neil.
I love to listen to you, because there's nobody.
I can't find your face.
He's a list of my bad granddaughters.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
I least love the guy.
Why?
Because he was like, he had a lot of humor, just like you.
Yeah.
Humor.
That's what I like about it.
Yeah, black people think Bob Grant's got a lot of humor.
No question about that.
I don't care what they think.
I like Bob Grant a bit.
And when I came to Florida, I shot a system of wife.
Who knows who you're listening to, but finally,
I found you arrested at me at the wrong God.
Playing those songs that they placed.
God, give us a break.
You know, my wife's not listening to you.
She can't stand me.
You know, what is this stupidity of his life?
The continuously, I don't mind of a person less,
but it's like I had two-year-old boy.
He gave it to me.
He gave it to me.
He got an ammo.
I love him, sir.
What does that mean?
I can know about it if you want to.
No, that was Stan.
Not me.
That was Stan.
It said that.
Oh, are you Stan?
I said it.
Yeah.
Well, are you following all of it?
Are you following all of it?
I love the birds, sir.
You love this one.
Yep.
Well, you know, I can't stand it when I have that bird.
The bird can come on my show anytime.
OK, we'll put him on Stan's show.
How's that?
I put him on any show.
I'm here.
Take him off the edge.
I'll tell you what's needed.
I'll make a deal with you.
OK.
Every month, once every five hundred years.
OK.
OK.
All right, Neil.
Bye-bye.
Adios.
Bye-bye.
Get the stupidest things in the mail.
Oh, you got one of those, too?
Yeah.
Did you get one?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Why?
What's wrong with it?
Why do you have to attack everything?
These people have good intentions.
And just because it's a dumb thermometer, is it the one about smoking?
Yeah.
Same one?
No.
Give it to Gary.
He'd like to have at least about a dozen of these all over his office.
Those militant, non-smokers, manny, anti-smokers.
My Emmy, hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Glad I didn't work that up.
But would you tell me what I'm going to do with three cases of depend on undergarments?
Well, listen, keep him on a stand by alert.
I think I'll send one case off to the Pope.
I would send him over to IOD as a matter of fact.
They can use them immediately.
I was a computer friend.
Did you get my, uh, uh, what to do with the bird?
Were you the one that sent that?
Yes.
You mean the cat recipes?
Cat recipes.
This is last week.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
The choice.
Yeah.
Very good.
Good.
Okay.
Nice to hear you again.
Thank you.
Did you smoke up there in the big office this morning?
No, I sure did.
And I put out my stoke before I went back there.
I'm no dummy.
Really?
There was smoke in the room.
Believe me.
There was some smoke, especially about a quarter to ten.
There got to be some real smoke in the room.
And we had a real, what I can't take of that word that I used.
Oh, the one off the air that you used?
You can't use the word.
No, the one that I used on the year to describe the session.
We had a spirited discussion.
A discussion.
Yeah.
And I said, listen, if you want to go in there and do the show,
go ahead.
No problem.
You know, I'll sit in here and I'll smoke my cigar.
Just go in there and do it.
I mean, the bottom line is, you know, we're not doing it.
And the real bottom line is when they begin to understand who these idiots are.
And when I showed Bob, the, see, he only gets selected things out of context.
But when I showed him this sheet that I got from our friend, Jack Thompson,
that looks like a little child wrote it, you know.
And then, of course, you listen to him on the air.
Yeah, you having fun.
Yeah.
I mean, this is a guy who's allegedly an adult and attorney no less or whatever,
who belongs in a rubber room, is behaving like a two-year-old child, who suffers from terminal homophobia and bigotry.
And he's, you know, he's going to tell us what to do.
And so the bottom line is that, oh, here's a woman in heat.
This ought to be for Stan.
Hello.
Oh, there she is in the shower again.
Oh.
Roll your tape recorder, as well as.
Uh, well, Mr. Goverson just disconnected us.
Okay, there's our live, I and the sky mic hanging over a pubic.
It's 20 minutes past noon at W.Y.N.C.
Let's take a...
When I look out into your eyes out there, when I look out into your face,
as you know what I see, I see a little bit of an ove, but in each and every one of you out there,
let me tell you, when...
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody,

let me tell you, when I look out into your face,
I see a little bit of an ove, but in each and every one of you out there,
let me tell you, when I look out into your face,
I see a little bit of an ove, but in each and every one of you out there,
let me tell you, when I look out into your face,
Michael J. Fox has no illness in him.
Man, there's a lot of unexplained phenomenon out there in the world.
A lot of things people say, what the heck's going on?
Let me tell ya, who the fear of this?
Elvis, who built stone, his?
Elvis, yeah, I mean, see guys walking in the street, pushing sharp his car.
And they think they're talking to Allah, they're talking to themselves.
Man, no, they're talking to Elvis, Elvis, Elvis.
You know what's going on that permeager triangle?
Permanently.
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis.
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis.
Ah, the saline Elvis, chapter Elvis.
Commodore Elvis is again.
Yeah, man, people from outer space, people from outer space, they come up to me.
They don't look like Dr Spock.
They don't look like clean-ons all that star-track jobs.
It looks like Elvis.
Elvis.
Everybody in outer space looks like Elvis.
Because Elvis is a perfect being.
We're all moving to perfect peace and harmony towards Elvis'
soon all will become Elvis.
Everything, everywhere, will be Elvis.
What do you think they call it?
Evolution anyway.
It's really Elvis.
Evolution, Elvis.
Evolution, Elvis is everywhere.
Elvis is everything.
Elvis is everybody.
Elvis is still a king.
You're all me, I'm out of the things that I feel.
Got you in me.
Yeah.
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
The time has come.
Time has gone to talk that little bit of Elvis
inside of you.
Talk to it.
Call it up.
Elvis, heal me.
Save me, Elvis.
Make me be born again in the perfect old flight.
That's right.
You got that Elvis inside of it.
He's talking to you.
He says he wants you to sing.
Everybody got a sing like the king.
Oh.
Oh.
Like the king.
Oh.
Get that leg going now.
Oh.
Get your lips to.
Oh.
Not a fool.
Get that on, let me down.
Oh.
Everybody.
Yeah.
We're rocking now.
Oh.
And what's his witness?
He's not only speaking to us.
He says the people, the people.
The people.
Oh.
Everybody got a point.
Elvis is everywhere.
Elvis is everything.
Elvis is everybody.
Elvis is everybody.
Elvis is still a king.
We'll come back in the place that's it.
here because I'm going to want to be eating all of them. Sorry about that but when it gets
back they're all going to be gone. Fort Lauderdale, hello.
Hello Dale.
Yeah.
Yeah, so that's right, my beauty college calling. We print it up 2,000 envelopes in the
letterhead of the bottom month ago if you're so far campaigned.
Yeah.
And what are you still embarrassed? We didn't get out here and we just want to know if you
still need it if so we'll go and let sympathy.
Yeah.
Okay, great. That's all I want.
You mean you mean they've been sitting there?
Yeah, I've called you your station a few times and I guess so many speak directly to you
about it because they don't say send it in. They don't know what to do with it.
So we'll just go ahead and send it.
Oh yeah, we can use that for a whole variety of things. We appreciate it.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Okay. I wonder who told them that. It couldn't have been the bird. You know who could it.
Could be. Okay, we got a couple of open lines now and you know how that feels.
In Dade County 624 9400 and there's an open line in Broward 524 9400.
I mean the audience today you would think would be excited and would be enthusiastic.
And what are we here? You know, wow, we want to hear that dirty stuff again.
You know, boy, it's really desperate Miami Beach. Hello.
Neil.
Yes.
We're going to keep you here. Neil. I'm so excited. Neil.
Don't overdo it.
Listen, can I get semi serious for a minute?
Please.
In regards to diet.
You can make a joke about this after I finish the call, but sometimes if you have an urge for Italian food.
Yeah.
If you go on a store and buy a big can of tomato juice, bring it home, stick it in a pot,
throw all kinds of spices in there.
Yeah.
You got instant tomato soup and I'm pretty sure after you eat it,
nice hot soup, you will have no desire for any Italian food.
No.
Okay. No, I'll just go out to lock in, Tina.
Right. You can do that.
And then if you want to save the calories and the hard burn, just try my recipe.
Okay.
How about V8?
Well, I don't go for the sugar and V8.
There's the sugar in there. They put it under natural flavors.
Yeah. How about these donut holes I'm eating?
Enjoy it.
They're a little bit...
They're loaded with sugar.
Or you can go on the stand major diet.
Young food.
Vanilla cookie diet.
At least smoking, heavy drinking and no exercise.
And a lot of intamins.
No, I exercise, sir, and I don't drink.
You do exercise, okay?
I jog.
Do you really?
Yep.
Great, Stan.
I think I'll do it sometime.
He jogs at Windixi.
Up and down the aisles.
All right.
I'm going to be jogging in front of the cat house.
And you jog, really?
Yeah, he really does.
You wouldn't want to see it.
I mean, it's enough to make you get sick, but it's great.
I even jogged in Phoenix.
Can you picture that?
It's okay, because...
115 degrees.
You're medley.
Yeah, he and Tom Lyckers used to go out and jog together.
Sir, did you watch the game last night?
No, I tried to bet someone on the game.
Why would anybody agree on that?
He was great, man.
Why would anybody bring up that game?
Because Jaworski is going to...
They play Philadelphia this Saturday.
And Jaworski is going to start for the dolphins,
which is going to be an incredible story.
You know what Jaworski had a good back to his filling teeth?
He did a good job.
Forget about it.
You didn't see the game.
You don't know.
I saw the land.
He loved you when you were in there.
Oh, he's my favorite, yeah.
Well, Marino's going to get scared, right?
Him and George Walson.
No, he's not a threat to Marino, but I've...
Strocks finished.
Well, Strocks about 100 years old.
What do you want from the guy?
I love Ron Jaworski.
Good.
Well, maybe we can fix you up with him.
Anyway, Neil, we're going to have to...
You're going to stay here and this was a heavy drama
at the last couple days.
Okay.
Well, I think there's some people out there that's like a letdown.
You know, they expected me to either not be here today
or to come on and have some melodramatic breath-shaking,
breath-taking, or something.
You know, any...
I didn't expect you to come on, little nervous.
About what?
I don't know.
I think if there might have been somebody nervous
in the building this morning, but it wasn't me.
I think Neil's kind of letdown, too.
Oh, letdown, because Neil likes a good fight.
No, he had a good fight.
He loves it, Mattel.
We had a good fight.
Okay, listen, have a great life.
It's time to get here.
Okay.
Trouble maker.
Pembroke Pine, hello.
Yeah, hello, Neil.
You mentioned Bob Ray, yesterday.
Yeah.
He's no longer a commissioner on the coil cables,
but he is a practicing attorney.
And he was one of the major leaders in that anti-gay movement
back in 1977.
Oh, well, I remember that.
He and Anita were just like hand in hand.
Exactly.
And he also has been in touch with that Dr. Hefferman.
Great.
Yeah.
I've had dealings with him because he was my attorney
in a mouth-ractor's lawsuit.
But he wanted me to go out and speak about anti-abortion groups.
And I wouldn't do it because I believe there's a role
not to have an abortion that's up to her.
You know, when people are obsessed with something,
when it becomes all-encompassing like it is to the Bob breaks
to the world.
Right.
They got a real problem, you know?
You know, he wants to be a judge in Day County.
Hmm.
And that is dangerous for a man as being as prejudice as him.
Yeah.
Be a judge.
Well, good luck to him.
Okay, and glad you're still on, Neil.
Thank you.
Right.
Bye-bye.
26 before one at Winds, all the powered lines just wide open.
These people, I'm cautioning you that today it's,
this is not like it has been.
Interesting.
At all.
Interesting.
No, it's depressing.
The audience is, their performance today is pathetic.
I mean, they kept calling till 630 last night.
Yeah, all on.
All on.
It's a whole new day now.
Trust me.
Hmm.
524.
I mean, why am I giving these numbers out?
Don't give the numbers out.
And we got in beyond that.
We can just give part of the number out.
524.
Okay.
That's it.
That's all you're getting.
I'm going to try that sometime.
You know what would light them up?
They're all lit up.
If you started answering the fold.
If you started.
I'm not doing that again.
They heard what happened to you yesterday, like 90% of the calls for the first half hour were cranks.
Yes.
Only three out of four from date.
Yeah, right.
After that it was fine.
I had no problem with it today.
I had no problem with it today.
Did we have any problem?
No problem.
We didn't have one other than Jack Thompson who called it in just the perfect time for about 20 seconds of self degradation.
Other than that, we had no problem in four hours.
You come on in that first hour, always like every looney tune in the world, been let out of the asylum.
No, just three calls from day one.
Yeah, just three out of every four.
Like this, call her on a mobile phone.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Joe on a mobile phone.
Neil.
Yes.
Listen, I know Stan's there and I spoke to Stan last week and I told 21 apologize to him.
Good, go ahead.
Over the phone, Stan.
Yeah.
I called you last week from Carl Springs.
What do you call the reference to this thing?
The thing in the People magazine and I know you were a little picked off.
It was the first time I ever participated on a radio show with you and I do have the like you show very much.
And the guy that you're up against, I think you have more questions than he does.
And I think I did bring up a source subject to you and you abruptly hung up on me.
And I apologize for maybe taking you off and I just hope you accept my apology because you are a gentleman and you know I didn't like it on the wrong side of you.
I think you're a real creep, sir.
I'm a real creep.
You're a real creep.
Why?
Well, anybody who would do what you did and then have the audacity to call this program and apologize is just incredible.
I just want to apologize.
Especially a suit on a mobile phone.
Since I'm paying for you, I'm paying for your mobile phone, you know what?
My taxes are going up as we speak to pay for your mobile phone.
I'm listening, sir. I'm impartial. Don't blame me.
I still love you, sir.
What did you do to him?
You and your BMW.
I was out of town right then.
Yes, please keep going with the music.
I saw the piece in people in the scene.
I was just wanting to have to stand and all that.
And I felt you were trashy and more open too much.
And I didn't think you deserved it because it was the guy I was feeling.
And that was it.
And he hung up on the phone.
And that was it.
I was really upset.
And I stopped there.
And I was feeling so good.
You deserved it.
You deserved it.
You know what kind of guy is that?
You owe me a break.
Right.
You know what I mean?
So I don't know.
Okay, sir.
You're a good guy, I'm a real creep.
No, you're not a creep.
You're not a man.
Yes, Neil.
Yes, Neil.
You know, like I was a douchebag, and I'm really not.
I have to be a nice guy.
I can do a douchebag to me, sir.
I love to show like you're so.
And I just wanted Neil.
No other one of these program directors on a mobile phone.
We've even got Bob Gilbertson calling people douchebags now. I feel like I've accomplished something today.
But I tell you, I thought I could douchebag.
And you know something? He thinks you're a douchebag.
He told me that just now he came in the studio. He said that caller is a douche.
What do you say? The one thing I said, the one thing I really want to know is what kind of car you're driving.
The crime driving you would want to be cut dead in.
No, come on, tell us. I don't believe that.
I'll tell you, Neil and Stan, I love your buzz. You got a great show. Keep tweeting on.
I think I can never get through to your famous poll you had last week, Neil.
OK. OK. I think we need to be all right. Shut up, creep. OK.
Shut up, creep. OK, listen, we appreciate it.
You're still a douchebag, OK? I am Neil.
On and on. He won't let him go. It's 35 cents a minute. That's why I'm leaving him on. Don't you understand?
Yeah, man. Sir, let me ask you another question. Sir, let me ask you. Sir, let me ask you. How's your wife?
My wife is excellent. How's yours?
What? Well, I don't have one. Tell me more about yours. I tell you. What's this?
Is it Stan? Yeah, Neil wouldn't ask about your wife. Are you crazy?
Stan, you heard my feeling so much last week that I wanted to fix your up with someone.
Yeah, your wife called me after the show last night, sir.
Huh?
Your wife called me after the show last night. Who is it? Your mother-in-law? You want to fix her up with?
No, not my mother-in-law. You shouldn't be. I wouldn't fix her up with you with three.
He is a douchebag, you know?
What's the matter? Is your wife, your wife got problems, sir?
Sir, has your wife got problems? My wife? Yeah. I get me.
That's what they say to you. That's what I want to talk about. Yeah.
But, uh...
I mean, who would marry a creep like you that would drive a Pontiac station wagon?
With a mobile phone. She.
Come on, you guys aren't coming any track at all. No track at all. Really?
Sir, where are you right now?
I'm on 36th Street.
Okay, give us a traffic report.
It's clean and greased. No problems. Well, I was nowhere inside any alley.
Okay. I'm probably too much in the lunch.
How many kids do you have, sir? How many kids do you have?
I'm sorry.
How many kids do you have? Torture. Torture.
There you are, torture. I have food or girls.
He's on a mobile phone. It's costing him 35 cents a minute. Don't you understand?
You just said you wanted him to talk.
Just from an SNM standpoint. That's your idea. That's why I'm letting him go.
How old are your daughters? They want you off, sir.
How old are your daughters, sir?
How old are your daughters, sir?
There are people running into control. I'm sticking their fingers down their throats to their poofyx.
They want you off. How old are your daughters, sir?
They're eight and five.
Oh, they do. They do toilets.
Ah, you're the daughter.
I'm over 10.
Okay. What was it?
Yeah, I love you. You got a great show.
You're not my type, sir. How's your mother-in-law, sir?
My mother won't eat too big. If I can give her to my father, or maybe I'd have six shoulders over there.
But, you know, I can't do it.
Is that it?
I can't do it.
Is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
Okay. What do you think of Jaworsky last night?
Jaworsky, uh, I think he has a better shot than Mr. Duskberg struck.
Yeah.
He definitely does, but I'm not going to be able to see the new Michael Jackson movie, Driller.
I think they need Twitter in the front line.
Okay. Good luck to you, sir.
Okay.
Have a great life. Say goodbye.
Goodbye.
I like people to say goodbye, but I'm fully capable.
It was fast enough.
I can never get that one just.
There's always that little sound pretty good to me.
Now, a little little violin somebody was tweaking their violin.
Yeah, but you've got standby me down, Pat.
Yeah.
19 before 1 at W.I. and Z.
We're going to be talking with James Hummel when we come back after this break.
You're not to be outdone by James Hummel.
We don't like that one-off-spin ship that goes on in a market.
I'm going to do a talk up now that is going to be so tight and so perfect that Ricky Tiki may be in tears by what time is he come on about three?
Well, he's like on all day, isn't he?
Like every day constantly all day.
And I want him to listen very carefully when we introduce Pat Boone.
On a day like today.
Perfect.
We must find a way.
Eat your heart out, Ricky.
I'll just the lyrics that are in there.
It dies.
It's it's shocking.
Oh, you laugh when I cry.
Okay enough.
You know, like 30 seconds of Pat Boone is all I can handle.
Which goes to show you how your taste changes and get older.
Now, when I was young, I could have handled a lot of Pat Boone.
I used to love Pat.
But first now we got those pictures and you realize there was not a lot to handle.
But as a matter of fact, does that look familiar to you?
No.
It's the Boone in the-it's the walking Boone in the box.
Look at that.
I can't believe it.
And it doesn't walk very far either.
I'd recognize Pat anywhere, you know?
Northlady Beach, hello.
Danielle.
Hi.
How are you?
Great.
I want to give a message to all those bummed out there to talk about Tweety.
Up yours.
Okay.
And now I miss eleven, right?
You bet.
Also, I have a complaint.
In fact, we're eleven and a lot now because I got this.
First I have a special hello to Glenn and also to Mike in the newsroom.
This is Shardit from yesterday.
And my complaint is yesterday I sat there earlier.
You guys were talking all this delicious food, palm of john, everything.
I sat there and all you offered me was cheesecakes.
What are you talking about?
Parmesan, everything.
We had Parmesan cheesecake.
No, I sat earlier around an hour ago.
You were talking about the palm of john.
It wasn't delicious food.
It was not no.
It wasn't from an Italian restaurant, dear.
Get your head put on straight.
Will you please?
It was from the W. Y. Z.
cafeteria.
Oh, is that where it was?
It was mong Parmesan.
Mong Parmesan.
What was Parmesan?
It's kind of like mouse meat Parmesan.
Well, whatever it was, it sounded good.
Well, trust me.
Trust you.
No way, Jose.
Okay.
And next time, am I going to get to meet you?
Hey, listen, you could have met me yesterday, but we're just having a little nervous breakdown.
Hi, my name is John.
Here we had a little crisis and everything's just fine now.
You're pressed for no reason, right?
And if you happen to hear Bob Gilchitz doing this show tomorrow, you'll understand that we had a change of heart.
I told him if you want to go in there and do this show, go ahead.
Do it your way.
He's not here.
Are you there, Charlotte?
Yes, I'm here.
I'm here.
Are you having trouble following all of this?
Yes, I'm following.
Okay.
Well, listen, we'll see you when you're coming back.
Well, as soon as I can, maybe next Monday, I'll pop in.
Good, because I'll be on vacation then.
You're going to be gone?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll have the following Monday.
I hear that Bobbi's coming back tomorrow to do a little work for us.
What?
Bobbi, I don't know who to help Bobbi.
You're going to be stuffing a couple of envelopes.
No.
I rather stuff them with blend or...
Well, we don't want to get into that.
We don't do that kind of material on this show, Charlotte.
And also, his personality fits his voice.
Exactly.
Exactly, kind of like a simpleton.
Right.
Yeah.
He's a really nice guy.
A nice simpleton.
The jerk's out there that don't like him.
They don't know what to help.
Just wait till you see him.
She did.
She was in here yesterday.
I was with him.
She was with him.
What's wrong with you?
In the biblical sense.
You have incredible taste.
That's right.
Okay, Charlotte.
Well, listen, we'll see you next Monday.
I don't know where it is.
I'm not next Monday.
When you're there, so I'll come on Monday after that.
Okay, I'll still be gone.
Okay.
You'll still be on vacation?
Yeah.
Be sure and come on at Monday.
That's Labor Day.
No, I have to work.
We're having a big sale here.
Okay.
Where do you work?
Mansons.
Oh, this is the Charlotte from Lansons.
Yeah, you're going to come to see me.
I want to give you a good deal.
From Lansons in a Broward Mall?
No way.
In the Hollywood Fashion Center.
No, 163rd.
163rd Street Shopping Center.
I know some of the people are working in security over there.
No.
I'm not with security.
I'm nothing.
And next time, maybe I'll get to meet you to stand.
Okay, Charlotte.
Stand is having cardiac arrest.
Don't take, okay, have a wonderful day.
It just, I didn't mention any names.
Don't make a major fuss out of it.
Will you please?
Got a caller on a mobile phone.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
I want to try to convince you of something.
Is this Joe on a mobile phone?
No, no, no.
Sandy will be back on next Monday.
And she loves those callers on a mobile phone.
Yeah, well.
Tony on a mobile phone.
This is, I don't usually do this.
What is it?
But I have been thinking about this for a long time.
I'm very serious.
Okay.
I would like to convince you of giving this some real thought about starting a sports show.
Yeah.
I think that you would probably in about...
Yeah, me and Joseph Ganky, we can be on together.
I'm serious.
I think it's really...
And we're doing so exciting songs.
I just rate it, sports show, in the Southeast.
I don't want to do a sports show, okay?
I mean, just like for an hour.
For what purpose?
I don't care about sports.
It would be a terrific show.
It would show that you could get enormous ratings in any of your endeavors.
I think you know sports.
I think you have a feeling for sports, like very few people do.
And I think you can communicate it on an intelligent level.
I was listening to the guy in WIOD and he said,
Jaworski will never throw a ball for the dolphins.
That's the level of...
That's what you hear, you know.
Who said that, Mandage?
I mean, Mandage is like a literate.
I mean, so are comments.
Must have been Joe Zagaki, because Joe is like in the steel malletian.
No.
Well, Neil even looks like Skip Carey, you know.
Yeah.
Skip and he could be twins.
I think it's a good idea.
I'll go do the Braves games and he can come here and do a sports show.
Tell me, what did you think about the dolphin?
What do you mean, what do I think about him?
I think, you know, can only get better or can't get any worse.
You know, I just think the puzzle's me about that.
They still don't have any defense.
They're secondary is pathetic.
They have no pass rush.
They have no defense.
I mean, everybody said in the Bears game they had no defense.
But, you know, when Mike Ditke was playing quarterback for the Bears,
what do you expect?
I mean, you know, like, Mandage didn't play.
And of course, Flutey's about three feet tall.
What do you want?
I see that's exactly what I think about him.
They still don't have a defense.
That can kill an audience.
I think that's fantastic.
I think that's great.
Yeah, it's killing his audience right now.
Exactly.
I bet you have a ball on it.
You're all doing their Jozy Gaki impersonation.
Oh, boy, Sonny.
Wait a second.
Take a poll.
How many people would...
No, I'm not going to take a poll.
Call Lee Fowler.
He'll take a poll.
I'll take a poll, too, sir.
Okay.
You're just going to finish cheap show.
Thank you.
Okay.
And his owl would say he stands desperate.
By the way, speaking of Alice,
attend the 70s today.
I pulled into restaurant for dinner.
And I was listening to Alice.
And the couldn't buy a call.
Attend the 7 went into a commercial break.
Came back and had some old bag on.
And I mean about a hundred years old,
who didn't even know who she was talking to.
Just here from New York,
who loves cats and just, uh, boy.
Talk about desperate,
unbelievable.
I like it.
I know you do.
And if I had that competition, I'd like it, too.
Because like, I'll lie.
I'm going to go out to dinner when you're in the kitchen.
I love film a quick.
Good.
I hope you and Alice have a wonderful time.
But watch him.
Elvis, Jr. is calling my show.
Hey.
My daddy is everywhere.
My daddy is everywhere.
Hello, Elvis.
I can't believe it.
Everybody is saying,
Elvis.
Elvis.
Everywhere.
How you doing, Elvis?
In Neil.
Yeah.
Hey, Santa, you can hear the car behind me.
I'm back on the street.
You know, because I want to feel home.
You know, Santa.
But on Neil, I just want to let you know that I'm Santa right behind you, baby, in this fight you had.
And I guess that's better than Santa right in front of you, right?
Exactly, especially on that escalator, Elvis.
Look out.
I just want to call him, say hi.
And, uh, let you know that I'm giving all my, all the sport I can.
And, uh, I miss you guys.
I'm saying, well, we're not, what do you mean you miss us?
Well, you know, I don't get to call you that much anymore.
Oh, I'm scared on the street.
Yeah, I'm just going to be busy lately.
And my age has been keeping me busy.
And, uh, you know, I'd like to call you more often stuff, but it's just been tough lately.
Are you telling me the bad news, Elvis, that you're not going to be calling me regularly?
Well, I tell you, Stan, every time that that beautiful, sexy voice gets on, you know, right then, I'm looking for my phone booth.
You know, I'm saying when all of you get on there, I just, I just want to.
I thought you meant Stan.
That too, that too.
That too.
Well, it's wondered about you.
You know about those rumors about your daddy, Elvis.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you know, hey, he rests in peace.
May he rest in peace when one piece you bet.
I'm going to hurry right now.
So I have to hang up, but you can't hear the car.
You can hear the car's behind me right now.
Right.
Okay, I just, okay, I hear those pizza man pizza delivery trucks pulling out right now.
Well, the thing is, I'm late for lunch right now.
Okay, baby.
Thank you.
See you later.
There he goes.
Elvis is everywhere just like the song says.
We have an open line in Broward and it hurt very badly.
The way the audience has been lukewarm today.
They've been really mediocre.
Well, that's all over.
Five, two, four.
You're doing your show as an animal.
We're giving him.
I know.
I know the audience likes a crisis.
They like, um, I'd like to hear everybody in heat.
But once you're going to have to, uh, let's start another crisis.
Contriots crisis.
Exactly.
Okay, that's the new format.
Who shall we pick on to the crisis?
Let's pick on to Polish people because the Pope is coming.
It's six before one.
Do we have another break this hour?
Kind of thought we didn't see.
There even even you couldn't squeeze them all in this hour.
And at that point, over back.
Okay, four minutes before one at W.I. and Z.
And the these donut holes work contagious.
They're like, um, you can't eat only 10.
You know what I mean?
That's right.
Like the tit.
It should try to eat one.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then you can eat it.
And then people will talk about it at the water cooler.
Okay, we know.
They must spend a lot of time at the water cooler over there.
So you know, and you know why?
Because they probably eat at that Chinese restaurant right next door.
They're on federal highway.
You know where I'm talking about?
You know where it is.
Where you turn there on federal by Oakland, I think.
Yeah.
And I have heard that that Chinese restaurant is one of perhaps the worst in the history of mankind.
So probably they spend a lot of time eating there.
Such a lot of time.
They spend a lot of time eating there.
They spend a lot of time eating there.
Such a lot of time.
They spend a lot of time at the water cooler.
With Ricky Tiki.
He's right there in the middle with that blue cap on.
And they're all gathered around Ricken Sons.
The whole gang.
Okay, Michael Wolfe is here with the local and area news headlines.
We understand that Mike's going to be doing one of the shows next week on my vacation.
And we're really going to be sure to miss that.
And then we'll go to CBS for the news at the top of the hour when we come back in 106.
We've got drop La Bomba.
And the Jim Moore and the editorial cartoonist of the Harold is going to be calling in for apologizing,
apologizing, ripping that idea off and all kinds of other original exciting stuff on W.I. and Z.
And then Stan's going to be allowed to give you a play by play of the cat.
What is the name of the place?
The cathouse.
The cathouse lady.
That's a two this afternoon.
Homosexuals that senator James Exxon of Nebraska told away truckers convention in Omaha.
And later said he would tell again.
And Lincoln Nebraska today.
Exxon said the jokie told yesterday before a speech to the Nebraska motor carrier association.
He said we were talking about the difficulty the truckers were having with the lawyers.
And we told several lawyer jokes.
And I guess one of the jokes I told was taken out of context.
But yesterday Exxon defended the propriety of telling the joke and said he would tell it again.
He made the comments to a reporter for an Omaha radio station.
Al Sektka of KKAR.
Look at that print on this on this wire.
Can't even read it.
The station recorded Exxon's joke and later comments on tape and played them on the air.
Exxon told the reporter if you want to run it fine with me.
I imagine I'll tell the story again.
The press never intimidates me.
Jeff Levy is executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington.
He said Exxon's joke is patently offensive.
And then at the bottom, as they always do, use it your discretion.
Here is the joke told by Exxon.
According to the tape played for UPI by KKAM in Omaha,
quote, the latest lawyer's story is one that's making the rounds in Washington, DC.
Why is it that there are more lawyers in Washington, DC and Queens and St. Queers in San Francisco?
Now, I can't read that.
Is that say Queens or Queers? Queers.
The answer is very obvious. San Francisco had first choice.
See, I thought it said Queens and I wasn't at a fendipity, but he said Queers.
Shame on Senator Exxon.
All is probably right.
Unbelievable.
I wonder where the queer lawyers went.
Miami, no doubt, huh?
Like, no names mentioned.
Yes, right.
Unbelievable.
Okay, so little contract cops again there that work keeps cropping up on his show.
Little contract cops, we have another recorder on a mobile phone who's probably an attorney.
Hello.
I'm not a lawyer.
Okay, well, I won't ask you the obvious other question.
No, I'm not that either.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm not sure which is worse either.
Okay, nobody's perfect.
That's right.
Hey, I'm glad all your troubles are all fixed up.
You know, that's really great.
And I was wondering since I'm 195,
since all your troubles are fixed up, if you could play the I-95 song.
No, we can't play that.
Haven't you been listening to the show?
Are you living in a vacuum?
No, I'm in a car.
Well, same difference.
Oh.
Unless your windows roll down.
Now they're up.
We can't play that.
That's one of the two or three things that we yielded.
You know, we had to do a little bargaining and we gave it away.
Yeah, what are you going to do in the Pope case, the town?
Same thing we would have done.
But I'll play it then.
No, we're not going to play that record.
We'll play the Pope records.
Oh, she was.
All right.
I mean, can't you live with that?
I mean, is something missing in your life now?
Well, I don't know.
I do look good as front saw.
I agree with you.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Nothing wrong with it.
Go buy a copy.
Exactly.
Why didn't you push it?
Push what?
Why don't you push it?
Why didn't you come here at this morning in bubble form program?
On the label, why didn't I push it?
See, this is really what the problem with the audiences today.
You people are all disgruntled, aren't you?
Well, I'm in a car.
Well, that speaks for itself in Florida.
All right.
Good luck to you, sir.
No, it's true.
He hit it on the head.
And there are several other people who've beaten around the bush
and haven't come out and said it.
But they're upset because I didn't go in there
and put my head on the chopping block
and just say, OK, you know, attack me and pale me, destroy me
over that record.
I can't live without the record.
I mean, wasn't there a show before I played that record?
I thought so.
But evidently not.
The record got old anyway.
Exactly.
How many times can you play the damn thing?
How can we hit the asshole song?
I mean, we've played it for you five million times.
We must have sounded a thousand cassettes
with copies of that record.
I must have played it.
I don't know how many times when I announced it in advance.
We're going to play the whole thing for you.
Get your cassette machine ready.
We gave away a hundred copies.
Didn't want it in two.
Well, you know, go to the mat on it.
How come you didn't go to the mat on it?
I'm going to go back in there now.
I'm going to tell him listen either.
We're going to play that record.
You're going to do the rest of the show, Bob.
It's as simple as that.
How do you like that?
And you know what it'll say?
I'll go do the rest of the show.
Contrived contours.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
But that's how the audience is, man.
You can never do enough.
You know, like you win the battle.
But you won't ever lose the battle, but you win the war.
Well, they don't want that.
They want you to win every battle and everything.
They want a hundred percent.
Life doesn't work that way.
I mean, we don't own the radio station.
Okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Miramar, hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Well, I'm not sure.
I thought we were doing okay, but I guess it's a mixed review.
Well, listen, I didn't hang up during the news.
It's a mixed bang.
Everybody did.
I didn't hang up.
Well, you were the only one.
Well, listen, you don't have to excuse me.
I just woke up.
I wanted to hear earlier today.
What happened with the big meeting and all that?
What's the story?
What's there?
What's there?
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll get the logger table, wind it back to 10 o'clock.
And we'll just play the first to 10, 20 minutes for you.
Hey, that sounds exciting.
Everything went fine.
We had a spirited meeting.
You know, we had a very heated exchange.
And they love me and they support me.
And everything's wonderful.
And they're one or two things that we agreed we're not going to play in life.
We'll go on, that's all.
Sounds good.
And those people in the audience who are not mature enough to be able to cope without hearing the same record 8,000 times,
they're going to have a problem.
Well, just get new ones and let them have to send them copies of the record, that's all.
Yeah, just get new ones all the time and then let them keep banning them and then keep putting new ones on you.
Well, we got one tomorrow that when they hear is going to make them forget that record in a hurry.
Trust me.
Yeah.
Well, listen, are you going to stay out with Stan all day?
He needs help.
To a clock, I'll be gone like a shadow, okay?
Well, he needs help, you know.
I think he needs...
Well, he needs some help, but I can't not the one to give it to him.
No, well, you know, his problem is he's carved out.
He said, he said, you're number one.
He just gave me a little signal.
It's too much carbohydrates.
It's all about...
Exactly.
All that entomans, man.
It's the thing that he has brain.
I bet he has the same problem and he gets in these weird moods and, you know, he just can't handle it.
Too much carbohydrates just sort of freaks out.
Yeah.
Well, I'll go over to Carvail after we get done here.
Yeah.
I'll go up the axis.
I think it took my advice.
He whipping out the Macy's catalog and the Sears catalog after he had that big chill on the...
He's got a better one today.
He's got New Woman magazine.
I'm gone.
Because I called him a while back about that ad.
He was getting all upset.
I'm excited about that.
That was in the Sun Sentinel.
And I said, God, where have you been?
And stuff's been around for years like this.
I said, go pick up a Macy's.
Earth's here.
It's cataloging there.
He's got him.
Hello.
I'm here, sir.
I'm just...
There was a pregnant pause and I was waiting for the rest of your point in comment.
Is Stan there?
He's here, but he just want to talk to you.
You got him very upset.
You took a cheap shot at him.
Man.
You know how sensitive he is.
I think Stan's a good guy.
He's very emotional, sir.
Believe me, he's very emotional.
Yeah.
He sort of didn't cut that guy any slack who called in, who felt bad because he insulted Stan.
His blood's going to be on Stan's head now.
Good.
Well, listen, guys.
All over his mobile phone, too.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You put that mobile phone in front of me.
How could you put a mobile phone in front of somebody you hung on in front of it?
Isn't that what it said on his...
Aren't you on a mobile phone?
No, I'm not on a mobile phone.
Oh, okay.
I'm laying on my couch.
I just woke up.
Well, we don't want to go into that.
Okay, this is a family show.
It's a family station and a family show.
It's a family couch.
It's in the family room.
And a lot of you stay on it long enough.
Somebody will be in a family way.
So just cool it.
Well, listen, have a great life.
Hey, you, too.
You guys take care.
Okay.
Love you, Stan.
Okay, deserves a mobile phone.
Okay.
Yeah, let's send him a mobile phone.
He can put it on his couch.
You know, that's what we ought to do.
We ought to make a deal with some phone company outfit.
And when these people call in who want to tell us what to do.
Yeah.
You know, we ought to voluntarily send him a mobile phone.
Something wrong with this thing, because it's not hopping around.
I'm winding it up all the way like I do in a first hired meal.
And it must be tuckered out.
Look at that.
It's been used.
It's just took a couple of tracks there.
You notice it leaves tracks behind it.
I wonder what you would call those.
It gets tired.
It's getting really tired.
Let me just wind it up a little more.
It's not doing anything.
It's going on strike.
It's enough is enough.
You know, like, come on.
Boy, I can't believe that.
There it goes.
See, it just needed a little rest.
Miami.
Hello.
Good afternoon, Mr. Rogers.
Why does this, sir?
Good to know.
How you doing, Mr. Carroyo?
Well, I'm a new Rogers fan, but I can't believe, and I'm shocked, that you have Bernard Meltzer on your show.
Yeah.
He's here.
Did you call me earlier, sir?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Have a nice day.
He called earlier.
He said that he wanted to know if anybody had seen you and Bernard Meltzer together at the same time.
It was a good line of first time, sir, but trust me, never twice in the same day.
And we're seeing evidence of that right now, right on the table.
Helen Dale.
Hello.
This is Julie.
I'm glad you said all your differences, and I'd like one point of information.
Okay, Julie.
See the phone number where I can get that record for Herving Paycheck.
I called 1-800-foot-spot, but I got to place a Minnesota.
Just when you thought crack-hole records couldn't possibly be more tasteless.
I met this year accountant.
Neither boat to Tadeeshmoor.
That's right, sir.
It's the cat-skill cowboy himself, Dr. Herving Paycheck, singing the all-time greatest hits of Noshville.
I said, you'll hear the accountant.
You gotta know how that beat him.
Know how to cheat him if you've on a litigod life.
Keep a second, sir, I've booked.
And who could forget this flavorful cut?
Looking for locks in all their own places.
Looking for locks I'd buy by the cases.
Quality stuff.
Be sure there's no cases of bones or two of my souls.
And no collection of old country music would be complete without Dr. Herving Paycheck's dietary classic.
I've his kosheb, binkosheb, bosn, koo, yes.
Crap-hole records proudly present the all-time greatest hits of Noshville.
Those not Miami Moods.
To order Noshville hits, dial 1-800-foot-spot, Dr. Herving Paycheck, because he's...
God knows not Miami Moods.
Yeah, wait!
How much do you want to bet there are people on their dialing frantically right now?
Hollywood, hello.
Hello, I'm Colmeo.
Yes?
Listen, I'm glad everything came out okay.
They must've ate some prune juice up in Maine.
No, they ate some crow this morning.
Oh, I guess so.
Listen, I'm not a resident and I have two kids and I'm happily married.
Sure, that's what they all say.
The same thing as you do, I go to the supermarket and check out the bad boys.
There's nothing wrong.
We shall talk about this on the air.
Why not?
Okay, but I check out the bad boys in Honeydew.
You bet.
Yeah, so it doesn't pay no?
It doesn't hurt to look, right?
Now what store do you shop in?
Uh, the great value on a 4-Foddy run and share it in it.
And I'm telling you, there's a one-kid in there.
You want to check him out.
Really?
He's got nice curly, full length hair.
Not long, but you know.
Yeah, long enough.
It's nice, nice, nice.
How old is he?
About 18?
Well, don't they have to be 16 to work?
I don't have any idea.
I think they do.
Uh, I think they have to be about 16.
Uh-huh.
Did you have a hair from the cashmash lady?
No.
No, you don't have a more normal.
No, I sure don't.
Um, sorry.
Oh, and listen.
I like the bird.
Keep them on.
Just fun.
And you know, these people that don't like his cackling?
These people ain't...
I'm nervous, like, at my...
my heart is in my throat.
These people that don't like his cackling are as laugh.
They probably haven't laughed in 50 years.
Yeah, well, there's probably something...
Well, probably a couple of things they haven't done in many years,
but we won't mention either one.
Yeah, and take on an animal.
Well, that's one of them.
And, oh, I gotta tell you something else.
Listen, you tell, uh, Bill Carl's, uh,
that moment that I...
I used to call him when he was on the afternoon,
and I miss him.
Okay, I'll tell him that.
That.
Okay.
And, uh, Stan Solaire?
He's just a man.
Stan.
Yes, ma'am.
Honey, I listen to you every day,
and I'm beginning to like you more and more.
Well, let me ask you this question before you go and tinkle all over him.
Where would be a great place for me to go on vacation?
You notice how the audience does not want to talk about this?
This is the most non-traveling town.
Like, when I used to do those shows on travel,
absolute abomination.
I mean, there would be nobody close.
I run a drive in other words.
I don't care.
Oh, you don't care.
Oh, my God.
See, there's no place.
I just stay home.
I'll just go to Calder every day.
Oh, it's such a short moment.
I think you ought to go to St. Thomas, don't you, ma'am.
No way.
Oh, you don't want to go there.
No way.
Why, it's a great place.
It's such a short moment.
I didn't have come to plan for this.
Yeah.
Well, today's Tuesday.
I've got a good idea.
Today's Tuesday.
I could leave Thursday afternoon.
What?
It's the cars I race track every day.
I'm in relax.
Do you realize how much I could lose in 10 days?
Yeah, but with your arm.
I'd be on work release by a week from Tuesday.
Sixth-eighth mark, a junior arm.
Yeah.
I'm going to go back to my home.
Oh, I'm going to go back to my home.
Okay, listen, have a wonderful life, ma'am.
Ladies, listen, do my trip.
We'll see you in great value.
Uh-huh.
We'll see you with great value.
That's where she does her job.
Where are you doing your shopping?
Yeah, I know I shop there.
Okay, see you later.
Oh, boy.
23 after 1 at W.I.N.Z.
I think I'm above back where I was at 9.30 this morning.
Honey, when sound's loud, me ill try to put me down.
And says we have a lost congregation.
I tell him right away that we live in here.
Good thing he can't hear her.
He's a martial.
It's number one in the nation.
