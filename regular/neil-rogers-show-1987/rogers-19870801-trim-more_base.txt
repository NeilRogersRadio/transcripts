I'm sorry.
Even he made it on there.
Well, congratulations, Frank.
You're a great American, and what can I say?
Well, those are little bonus numbers for you today.
Please, in general, you won't get those anywhere else you're found.
The world is a better place.
And probably not to left a tissue ball on this show again.
Boy, those are good.
Those are some of my favorites.
You did have a lot of important things.
I told you that.
You didn't believe me.
I think that I just come in.
I roll in here Saturday, expecting for you to be here like a clutch.
Well, you don't expect you to be here on Saturday.
OK, I was wrong.
By wild.
About making fun of you.
That you really had nothing to do this hour.
I was wrong.
We have a lot to do.
And I still have...
I don't care.
You know, this business about what like nature takes care of it and you're not attracted.
That's a lot of garbage.
I mean, if you're a virile heterosexual male, which is something I don't know much about,
but if you were and you had an attractive, you were like 17 and you had a beautiful 16-year-old sister
with big breasts and hard nipples and whatever else it is that they get all excited about.
I'm sorry, but you probably would, you know, like peek in the room.
No.
No.
Kyle says no.
You wouldn't be in the least bit interested because it's just like nature, you know, protects you.
There's a psychological barrier.
And from the time you're born, you know that this is a no-no.
I don't know.
However, if you have a 17-year-old brother, that's terrible.
Wait, is there a message?
There's a message coming on the screen.
When you grow up with somebody, you are...
Yeah.
So bored.
Yeah, you know, with them.
Yeah, you don't like them.
That is a good point.
You know.
Yeah.
Well, they did...
I forgot to tell them now in the Blue Lagoon.
Of course, they were there alone.
Different.
That's different.
And in Paradise, they forgot to tell your girlfriend that.
That's right.
Well, he aims to.
Yeah, that's exactly right.
That's different.
That's a different situation.
That's why everyone loved those movies so much.
And they...
No, that's not why everyone loved this so much.
It is a lot of skin in those movies.
Well, that's the only reason anybody could have loved the movies because they were both pathetic.
They were dumb.
Blue Lagoon.
I do have six copies of Blue Lagoon.
I would like to borrow one.
That was a giant, unbelievable smash at the box office.
Of course, because everybody wanted to see Brook Shields and Chris Atkins naked.
Which we did get to see him naked in the water.
Yeah.
And believe me, he made Blue in the box look like giant.
It was a Paris.
That's right.
I'm not serious about that.
And it's the same thing with Paradise, which is also a giant hit.
It reminds me of all those speaking of giant, all the scabbage about James Dean.
Okay.
Okay.
James Dean A was ugly.
Okay.
Trust me.
He was ugly.
And B, he smelled bad.
I mean, everything you read about him, the guy never got...
He was kind of like a early day rick waiver.
You know what I mean?
He never got near a bar of coast.
He never saw Irish springer.
And he smelled terrible.
His hygiene was...
He was a scuzz.
And he was also...
He was into like SNM.
And it would burn cigarette holes in his...
I don't really get into any of that.
I don't understand people who want to have somebody put out their cigarette on your chest.
You know, I don't know what that's all about.
Especially women.
But speaking of SNM...
It's a myth.
The whole thing is a myth.
What about SNM?
I heard another one of those weird radio rumors yesterday.
Really?
About one of our...
I received it for this late into the show.
How when you mentioned SNM it popped into my life.
And I can't believe...
I don't even know if I should get into this at all.
But I'm sure you'll force your zero-oil.
I always do.
Like the story about...
Mike Miller being a matriety at stake in shake.
In same peak.
Well, you worked with this guy.
So I wondered if you could shed any light on this.
I heard...
Jerry Wichner of all people...
Is a little kinky.
You worked with this man, didn't you?
I heard...
I just before you continued the story has a very big 357 magnum.
I know.
I was with him at all times.
That's why I should not continue with this story at all.
Whatever you want.
I heard he...
Dallys with...
Oh.
Don't say it.
Not on my show.
Say it on somebody else's show.
If you want to do Slander do it on somebody else's show.
Exactly.
That's why I'm going to stop right now.
But I just wondered if you...
Dallys with...
Don't say it.
I'm not.
Write it out.
Write it on that paper.
Just what we were talking about.
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
Well, who cares?
Well, I just wondered if you had heard that.
Because you worked with...
I mean, even Old Rover won't roll over for him.
I mean, you know, I think we've gone farther than we should have with that already.
But we're not interested in people's private life.
Good.
Okay.
We don't want to stick our noses in this.
Well, it's just basically his private life.
Such a bizarre rumor.
Yeah.
If it would have been Jason Gidrich's private life, then we want to...
Pull still on the right...
Right.
Exactly.
Then we might have talked about it in a great way.
We'd better just back out of it.
How great length we don't know.
I think we'd just back out of that whole situation.
I'm grateful.
Sorry, I brought it up.
I apologize to the audience.
Well, you ought to apologize to Jerry.
I do.
His wig might change to purple if you...
Although it already is purple, so I just...
Broward, hello.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me ask you something.
Why is Stan going through these desperate topics like hot pursuit and things like that?
He's shooting for about a one-two rating.
That was a good show.
Oh, come on.
No one cares.
Well, I didn't listen to him.
What was a good show?
No one did except a bunch of winding cops.
Yeah, well, a cop's in the pigs.
I couldn't believe he was so...
No, he was a little hostile with a couple of the cops coming to those pigs.
Well, I don't dislike all police, but most of them are pigs.
Oh, yeah, they're ego trips.
Yeah, the pigs.
I think he's just playing up to you.
You said he was real conservative.
I think he's doing his cop bashing.
He's called just to play up to you.
And it just doesn't work, you know?
You think so?
Yeah.
Waste of time.
Well, maybe he can do another John Broward type show.
Exactly.
Yeah.
But he can talk about Nick Raghwath.
Just stuff on insist and mutual masturbation.
Yeah, that would be more exciting.
Now, do you have any sisters?
No.
Brothers.
Yeah.
Two.
Two brothers who are older?
Younger.
Younger.
How much younger?
Three years.
And two.
And you're old?
34.
34.
But you've got a good memory.
Now, huh?
Thank you.
No, I mean, give me a compliment.
Now, when you were younger, you and your brothers certainly never did anything.
No, no.
No, no.
No, not at all.
You and your cousins.
Well, cousins, perhaps, yeah.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Little red-headed cousin named Kathy.
Uh-huh.
Unbelievable.
She was hot.
Oh.
Was she hot?
Uh-huh.
Was she?
14 years.
She was 14?
Yeah.
No, he said this went on for 14 years.
No, no.
She was six to the time she was 20.
She was hot some day one.
Are you serious?
Oh.
Well, without getting too graphic, because it's a family show, and the FCC is monitoring.
Uh-huh.
Right here.
Huh?
All I have to say is red hair.
Well, I don't like red hair.
In fact, red hair, I hate to say this because I love that I don't like people with red hair,
but in terms of being attractive to me, red hair is an incredible turnoff.
I mean, I just, I get physically ill, you know, when I think about it, but, you know, to each his own.
Oh, my, I wish, you know, with, uh-uh.
Oh, that explains it.
Now, you and your cousins, she was 14.
You were how old?
I was 16, 16, and what is it that you were doing without getting, you know, used some...
This is a special term.
She was a little discreet in here.
Um...
So, I guess you'd call it, uh...
Familiar copulation.
Oh, my God.
Ooh.
Wow.
She was a, she was a first cousin, too.
A first cousin, and you do understand that...
Uh...
Mangle, I know.
Yeah, there's some harp.
In fact, the whole city of Nashville is a result of that kind of relationships.
Yeah, but I think she was a Mangle, right?
So I don't think there's a problem.
Oh, I see.
So, yeah.
No, in the next generation.
No, seriously, in other words, she was really hot.
Yeah.
And so were you.
Uh-huh.
And how long did this go on?
Uh-huh.
15, 20 minutes?
No, no.
No, no.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
No four play tonight.
15 or 20 minutes.
What a romance.
What?
No, I don't mean, uh...
No, no, no.
How long?
Another month, years, week...
You're taking two Kalamazoo shortly, yes.
Oh, I was like it was like one time.
Oh, yeah.
Only once.
Just one time, but you still remember it.
Oh, I've been in love.
It was fabulous.
He remembers it vividly.
Was she the best you ever had?
To that point.
To that point.
Yeah.
Now, she was till his brother came along.
Well, there was a certain, you know,
the incest angle really adds a little excitement.
Oh, sure.
Everything's exciting at 16.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
So once again, we have found Stana a show.
He's all set now.
No, you're right.
The population.
This is a great topic.
It really is.
Unfortunately, most people are unlike you.
And I commend you on your honesty,
but most people are just, I don't know whether it's social stigma
or what it is, but they just are too embarrassed
to admit those things.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's right.
It's just right.
Certainly.
It's right to do it.
But I don't think I'd actually follow through an
act.
All right.
Now, let's say you were 16 and this 14-year-old cousin,
and instead of being your cousin,
it'd been your sister, OK?
Yeah.
No, wait a minute.
And your parents would have taken you
on a trip to Kalamazooers somewhere.
And you would have all, you've been in a motel.
And your mother and father were in run room.
And the two of you were in another room
for your sleeping arrangements.
Now, is there a possibility that something might have happened?
Most likely in a reaction, but I don't know if anything else.
Well, that's good.
That's a good, healthy type.
Yeah.
Like you say, I don't think there's anything.
If you make your sister, you didn't know, like,
too adopted people in two parts of the country,
and they made each other.
I don't think there'd be any kind of a barrier
between them, you know, genetic barrier or a light
those of you're not supposed to be attracted to.
Well, when you grew up with somebody, it's different.
There are all those signals there for bitten fruit.
So I didn't say that.
But it ain't worth it.
In fact, if you have any female relatives,
you might give it a shot.
You know, just prove that.
No, I didn't have a cousin as a matter of fact,
a female cousin, and we did do some interesting things.
That's OK.
I also had a male cousin, and we did some very interesting things.
So you're not a very real interest.
A heterosexual sense, too.
You know, I have a problem.
When I first started listening to you a few months ago,
I didn't realize that you were a homosexual.
Of course, you're a homosexual.
Hello, but can some regard.
And once I found out, I didn't care.
And I started telling people about it,
and once I described you from, you know,
New York, Jewish, homosexual, they wouldn't listen.
Then I started not telling them.
They'd listen and love it.
But now I'm running into a problem in the last week or so,
but your topic is the Hawaii.
But, you know, when I turn people on,
I have to have a disclaimer.
You know, like, I am really OK.
He's really funny.
But don't get shook up.
When he starts trolling, when he's trolls on the ear,
don't get up.
So you don't think that I'm really doing that seriously.
I mean, of course, there was always the whole point
in the back of my mind that maybe a miracle, you know,
might happen.
I mean, the video that I had in the AES today,
that was ridiculous.
Yeah.
Well, you know, some day, some day he'll be 20.
That's true.
Did he ever read here?
No.
Trust me.
No way.
All right, no.
OK, take care.
I'd say hi to your cousin.
I will.
OK.
Boy, that's incredible.
Yeah.
Good call.
In fact, I'm really going to admit something
on here now that I've been, you know,
I've always known.
They're always pushing you to be more honest and more open.
And I'm going to admit that I had sex with a 12-year-old boy.
But how old were you?
12.
OK.
In fact, I had sex with a couple of 12-year-old boys.
When I say had sex, I mean, it was just, you know,
back when you were five minutes.
Yeah.
It was four minutes.
Yeah.
Like in a basketball game, you know, a little dribble.
And that's about it.
OK, it's 13 before 2 at WINZ.
Well, so that took some great courage to admit that on the air.
When we come back, Len is going to make some startling
admissions to the audience.
Today is the day.
OK, I guess, huh?
Too much important business to do.
Oh, we could play just a little list of shoe bars.
Sure.
Like the Copa.
Now, listen, I shouldn't say the Copa because there's a Copa
on Bird Road in South Miami.
And we know when they got not upset with me,
but they were nervous a few years ago.
It was about four years ago on another radio station
because I had made some cracks about the Copa and the clientele.
And I was talking about the Copa in the Fort Lauderdale,
of course, off federal highway by the airport.
Well, that's right.
Yeah, the Copa on Bird Road, you're talking about it.
Yeah, he called and begged me to go on and say,
hey, the Copa on Bird Road is not, is that still the Copa?
I can't remember.
I don't know.
It may be something else now.
No, it's probably El Copa.
OK, Dave County.
Hello.
Yeah, it's fine.
Who's this?
Let me check.
I think it's Neil.
Hey, I know how you doing.
This is Gary from Dolphin Digest.
Yeah, how you doing, Gary?
You got the schedule cards for me.
Oh, OK.
Thank you so much.
OK.
And there also we just discovered some hurricane cards in there, too.
Yeah, you gave you some hurricane cards.
You gave you some Dolphin Digest.
Well, we appreciate them.
We didn't like the pictures on the Dolphin schedule,
but nothing is perfect.
I like tanks picture, but the other one.
Yeah, well, we get a little bit of everything.
We need to clean up his act.
Well, what can you do?
I know.
Well, I'll stop by next week.
Great.
Thanks for here.
Bye, bye.
Good guy, Gary from Dolphin Digest, who reprinted our so far ed.
That's right.
And we appreciate that.
Oh, listen to that.
Broward, hello.
Hello there.
Boy, am I glad you're there after that big buildup?
Oh, wow.
Well, I'm talking to you from the tin can credit phone on the wind's jet blimp.
Oh, it sounds like it, too.
How are you doing, Clarence?
It's like your phone.
Uh-huh.
OK, how's that?
That's even better.
All right, this is John, who was there yesterday.
Oh, John.
Oh, John, who was here yesterday?
Yeah, not Michelle, John.
OK.
Yeah, this is the big one.
Great.
We had a water cooler installed in our office the other day.
We could have a place to stand around and talk.
Blind for every day.
You know, I know Tanner can relate to this.
And we got a little Ricky Tiki doll.
And we put them up on top of the water cooler.
And all he does is he stands there with his sailor hat on.
It says, talk to me, talk to me.
Yeah, we have one.
You wind it up, and it does talk ups.
It's incredible.
I do talk back.
I get your commercial time down perfect.
And I come back in just as the wind's music is coming on.
Oh, look at that.
We just got a message that Copa is closed.
This is the one in Bird Road.
Yeah.
It's a funeral home or something now.
So I really did something for their imager.
That's too bad.
Sorry, Monty O's.
We have a recording here also of the gerbos that actually
power the wind jet blimp.
20 hits.
Go ahead.
That was good.
Wait a minute.
I got an article here.
Hold it.
OK.
I guess the gerbos ran out of the water.
Oh, boy.
I got an article here in a magazine.
It'll take about two minutes to read.
Well, good luck to you, John.
The chances of that on the scale of zero.
Oh, but it's about condoms and rock roots.
Minus infinity.
You don't want to hear condoms and rock roots?
No, but you can send me the article.
You can bring it in Monday.
OK.
I'll do that.
All right.
Well, did you make it to work yesterday, John?
Yeah.
Welcome to Tadey yesterday.
Oh, that's right.
Of course.
So I know what I had to last thing.
I've got a song here.
And the title of the song is The Nips Are Getting Bigger.
Oh, boy.
Well, you dropped that by Zeta when you come into building.
They need something.
No, they won't play it.
They're too busy playing the door.
But they'll listen to it.
Well, we might, but I don't know if anybody else.
Yeah.
I noticed his nipples seem to be getting very large.
OK.
Listen, John.
Have a wonderful weekend.
And we'll see you around a block.
All right.
Take care.
OK.
Bye, bye.
Dade County.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yeah.
Are you two?
OK.
Oh, no, not him.
Frank caller.
For one of the day, yeah.
What is he doing?
How are you doing, buddy?
Oh, yeah.
He's the one that called the first day we did this.
Dade County.
Hello.
Neil.
Yeah.
Have you got in the mail, say?
We don't get mail on Saturday.
Oh, you don't?
Oh, and you're beginning my record on Monday.
What record?
It's one that came out in 82 by the village people.
It has a touch trial.
I'll wait till you get it on Monday,
and then you'll see what it is.
The village people?
Yeah.
Ooh, I can't wait to see that.
It has a very interesting cover, too.
I'll bet.
It's a 12-inch mix of a one-of-a-spawn.
So let's see how you like it when you get it on Monday.
A 12-inch village people, huh?
Yeah.
It's unbelievable.
Well, listen, that's exciting.
We'll be looking for.
Is it some way you can play on the air?
Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you a title, a title,
the name of the phone is called Sec over the Phone.
I'll kind of like this show.
Like that?
Great.
That ought to be good.
Sounds promising.
OK.
Thanks a lot.
OK.
Adios.
There is freedom within.
There is freedom without worries.
It's just a touch and tell you should be careful.
Unbelievable.
It is incredible.
Toot.
As they say, a popular one.
Oh.
More Elvis.
Major's in a building with his new Elvis Presley poster.
Bro, you ladies out there.
I don't think you've got a thing to worry about.
Ha.
Well, it's all good things must.
And the fight button just comes to an end.
