Hallelujah, good morning. It's the Neil Rogers show and WZTM, I'm the beach, four-lotted
ale in the Palm beaches. Good morning, Neil.
What's Gary Hurt doing tonight? And who are mine's wanton?
Wiring mines read the Miami hero. Is Maurice Farray really having sex with an alien from
outer space? It's in the hero. Is Paula Hawkins the true mother of the elephant man?
It's in the hero. Is John Kennedy sleeping with Max Henry? It's in the hero. Is Jim Baker
about to give birthday Jerry fallbells baby? It's in the hero. Sex, sex, sex, more hot sex.
Oh, it's in the hero. Plus Gary Hurt's amazing right style from Florida.
A crossword puzzle that has no answers. Our own punitive practice just for us.
I had pubs and love letters to Neil Rogers. And we're so sorry Uncle Albert but we haven't heard a bloody thing all day.
Miley's Fab Lake rhetoric. It's all in the latest issue of the Miami hero.
Available at supermarket checkout counters everywhere. And where finer manure is spread.
Okay, I wanted to make sure that the people of the hero knew right off the bat.
We weren't going to waste any time. You know what I'm saying?
And those of you who go out and get your waterlogged newspaper this morning,
you know, pick it up and throw it around a little bit. Get upset with it.
Do nasty things with the hero this morning. How you doing?
559 at Zeta 4 on a beautiful Monday morning. What a great way to start the week.
Right? Lea Gillette is here and the Mr. Bird is here. Captain Dave is in the other room.
Yeah, Mr. Sports. Oh, is he Captain Dave? Well, we just made him Captain Dave.
Captain Dave is the old watermelon man. Is this a new nickname?
You've been hiding from me all week. Didn't waste any time. The watermelon man is here.
And we're going to be doing it every morning, six to 10. In fact, we're doing it right now.
But don't tell your neighbors about it. Now Kirk Cameron is how old today? 17.
Boy, oh boy. I'll tell you what they sound like. He'll sound like hell. Don't they? They sound awful.
Those headfos? Yeah. Those are just awful. I would never use it.
Oh boy. I would never use it. Come on. Let's get some good equipment in here, Max.
Get serious. Would you please? I mean, this is unbelievable. Right.
You went on a minute early. I noticed. I noticed this. This is a precedent.
By the way, the rumor has it. And I don't want to get anybody panicked.
But the rumor has it that there are a whole bunch of morning people in the market this morning that came in early.
Yeah. That's true. I drove down the 79th Street Cosmere. Herman and McBean were there at 430 this morning.
Oh, my gosh. It must have been the night there.
I saw what was named Herman's pickup truck. Chevy pickup out there and McBean. He doesn't have a first name, does he?
No, just McQueen. Just McQueen. Yeah.
Now this is all a coincidence that they all came in early today.
On another South Florida coincidence. You know, there's so many of them.
Look at that. There are a couple of lines flashing already. We just barely got out of it.
It's not even six or five. It's 30 seconds past six on Zeta 4.
I want you to give a lot of time checks. Okay.
And enjoy me being here on time, by the way. Now, you know on the old show, I always came in 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes late, right?
We always have it back. Always fashionably late.
Yeah.
So that's the way it's going to be on this show. We don't want to change that.
But I came in early today because...
You like the way I shut off the cart part there in the middle of the herald thing?
But I want to get all the screw ups out of the way in the first day. Nobody is going to pay any attention anyway.
No, look at that. Now, wait a minute. Is Dave already answering phones?
Can you believe that? He's so efficient.
That's frightening. He's already answering the phone.
This like he knows what he's doing.
Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know Neil about your phones over on the other side, but never answer the deadlines here.
Ever. Ever under any circumstance.
Because.
Oh, because it's just like, oh, la. Hey, a lot of hate.
Yeah, I got my first hate call here Saturday as a matter of fact. Scott was in there and he was enjoying the call.
Yeah, which got me very upset.
But wait till he comes in today and finds out the story. And I'm saying...
What story?
Well, wait a while. I break it on the air.
Anyway, the number is going to be and you probably want to write this down on the restroom walls all around town.
550.
940.
If you got that so far, 550.
940.
940.
And that's of course because the 94.9 is easy to remember.
It's easy to remember.
Yeah, we have our Noiman mics.
Boy, it's is.
I'll tell you one thing though.
They sound a lot better.
Your sounds better than mine.
Well, that's no accident.
Yeah, right.
Sure.
I'm serious.
Your sounds a lot better than mine.
Yeah, but yours says Zeta.
I want to tell you the watermelon man.
His voice is so deep that even without the mic.
He's got a reason.
You don't even need a mic.
He doesn't even need the mic.
I can just bear him up.
Yeah, to the point where we're getting.
Oh my god.
We're all top 40 DJs and we have no hearing.
No, you have any idea what power there is here?
Sitting here.
I can blast you guys into the next room.
Into the AM.
Into the AM.
Into the AM of fate worse than death.
And by the way, a little later on we have a sample of the new format on AM.
I saw them sitting over there.
Did you walk in and say hi to Mike and Arlene?
I walked in.
I looked at Arlene and she said.
The most incredible thing.
There's our first mistake.
Or is that the second mistake?
There was no mistake.
What happened?
She said the most incredible thing.
And I'm not going to do it now just because of you.
Can you say kinky?
Hey, listen, there's a whole new deal here.
I know.
I understand.
What do you want?
Like a 20 share on the first morning?
No.
You out of your mind?
Why should this show over here be any different than the one we did on AM?
I'll screw it up.
Yeah, of course.
By the time, like by the end of the first week we'll have all of this equipment like degenerated to the level of the cramp that we used over there.
Now I know that Arlene and Mike are going to do great.
Yeah.
And, uh, sure.
Why was Mike wearing black this morning, by the way?
You know what I'm saying?
I've never seen him do that before.
Look at Johnny Cash, didn't they?
604 at Zeta, the Rio Grande Show, setting new lows in the history of FM.
And of course, a lot of these paint-and-the-ass callers are going to say,
Well, where's the music?
Where's that music?
Where's Pink Floyd in the doors, man?
He's playing Pink Floyd, dude.
Yeah, dude.
You know, like we'll play a little music when we're good and ready, you know?
When we feel like it, then we'll play some music.
One thing I will say, I'm wide awake, you know why?
Because I never, never fell asleep.
Oh, come on.
No, in the beginning, well, I must have for a little while, but in the beginning like you panic, you know, like you're afraid you're not going to wake up the first morning.
And you keep rolling over and looking at the clock.
I know.
And it's like 130, and then it's like 10 to 1, and all of a sudden it's like 220, and you just keep looking at the clock.
All of a sudden it's 430, you see, I've got to get up.
Yeah, so you don't think you really slept.
Glenn, tell us your excuse for getting up late this morning.
He was, don't, I always know.
He already has an excuse.
Don't push him.
My alarm clock dropped off.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Over night.
Should we take, should we take some of these calls?
I'm excited about taking a phone.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
If I remember where the hell they come in on here.
It says phone.
Phone.
Yeah, the phone would help, yeah.
It's probably on this one here.
Try that one that says phone.
It doesn't say phone.
What is it?
How about the phone is way over here.
Hey, listen, I wasn't even close.
If you want to play this.
I didn't even say that.
What did you turn on?
Do you have any idea?
This is fun, don't you?
I didn't say it.
It's like playing with a new toy.
Okay, now which one should we take first?
Just like phone.
Look at this Captain Dave has already given us the finger like, hey, you're number one.
You're number one.
Let's get that breakfast club back on, man.
You're number one.
Come on, Captain Dave, get serious.
Okay, number two.
Now, wait a minute.
This is serious.
Now, this is our first call.
Okay.
We'll be nice.
Okay.
Dave County, no less.
Is that okay, Lee?
Fine, fine.
Hola.
Hello.
Good morning.
A voice.
It sounds like grandpa.
It's Al Lewis.
Good morning, Uncle Lee.
Good morning, Uncle Lee.
It's the island queen.
It is?
Isn't it?
Island queen?
Can you say king?
You've been up all night waiting.
What happened to that?
Peter Moon.
I must have been like riveting.
You've been talking to Peter all night, huh?
What kind of a show do you think this is, island queen?
Well, I was hoping you would pay a little CCR.
Look at CCR.
All right.
This is our kind of call, Rick.
You bet.
I don't know.
Welcome you to FM.
Thank you.
That's it.
That's it.
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, come on.
Now, Jeff, I could not see that all this.
Now, wait a minute, island queen.
Now, you always used to get too nervous to talk to us on AM, right?
That's right.
You would call.
You'd be on the screen.
And before we could get to you, it'd be too nervous.
This is story you went to.
So, I really use.
So, he talked to us on the air.
And we're thrilled.
This is going to leave you in the aim of the radio.
Yep.
Well, if anybody would know island queen, you're the guy.
And by the way, by the way, island queen,
are in into some postman the other day at a restaurant.
And they wanted to thank you very much for those posters you sent
to the Carol City Post Office.
I know they all have it on the bathroom.
Okay, listen, have a wonderful day in a great life, okay?
And if we don't see you soon, I'll revert there.
You know the island queen.
No, I don't.
But you get familiar.
Isn't Carol City lovely at 4.30 in the morning?
Perfect.
I'm serious.
Well, can I ask you a dumb question?
How come the date and brown lines are a lot of.
And that dumb vocal line, it would pay so much money.
I thought that was going to be a big bonus.
We got to make that clear.
That in Bokeh, you can call toll free, same numbers.
Wisdom as well.
Yeah, that's right.
It's other, at least southern part of West Palm County.
Yeah, that's right.
Should I give the number?
Yeah, I don't like giving these numbers.
You know that.
No, just it's, yeah.
For Bokeh, people get used to it.
We do it once a first day.
550-
Dash.
Is he pathetic or what?
Is he, is he tragic?
Well, the Bokeh line is ringing.
Are you excited?
Absolutely.
And I'm going to tell you what.
Now, let's take one from Broward, because we took one from Dave.
You're going to get in the rest of the number or what?
But now we're taking calls for this early in the morning.
It's 6.07.
Dash.
94.90.
You know, the best part of this is, what was that number again?
5.
That's a scary, isn't completely controlled.
Oh, boy.
Okay, thank you, Captain Dave.
It says, turn up the damn phone.
Okay.
So the phone isn't so hot, all right?
Boy, what a maniac.
He's going to be getting us all week.
You know that.
He's going to be getting us all week long.
And look at that.
He's got his Jeff Chase Voodoo doll in there.
The man is a maniac.
He's going out of his mind.
Broward County, good morning.
You be there?
Oh, there it is.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Neil.
Oh, our first Broward call.
I knew it would be excellent.
How you doing?
I broke the lad, you're back on the air.
After a long absence.
I can feel.
Uh-huh.
Are you there?
Just barely.
Is the bird there?
Yes.
Bird, get some gas.
Will you bird?
Get some heavy gas in here.
How about the, do they sink or do they float?
What the, she coming on?
She's the first guest.
On Wednesday, yeah.
The sink and float lady.
How about your sister?
Do they sink or do they float?
They float, not as much as, uh...
Ivory soap but close.
At least.
Oh, well, listen, nobody's in that.
By the way, do you know that Lee had a big summer book, the biggest in the history of Zeta so far,
two big ones in the afternoon.
Couple of, yeah.
Two huge ones in the afternoon.
Two hung low, right?
Something like that.
Listen, bird.
Yes, sir.
There's a lot of good people coming to the South Florida area, some entertainers.
Like?
Well, you missed David Brunner.
You could have had David Brunner on the show.
What would we do with them on the show?
Oh, look, Neil is a comedian.
Neil is a genius.
So why do we need another comedian?
Well, it's better than...
Wait a minute.
We're not going to be doing that stuff.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
No, we're not going to have those comedians coming in here, are we?
Oh, I hope not.
Oh, no.
Pink Floyd's going to be here another number one day.
Look at Captain Dave.
Yeah, you're going to have comedians, lots of comedians coming.
He's got all these people booked that we don't know about.
Well, we'll go and put them with Arlene and Neyne.
Strictly sabotage.
Strictly sabotage.
Trust me.
I know what's going on in that other room.
Dave did a great job when he answered the phone.
He really is.
He knows his whole life is hanging on this, yes.
So could I speak to Neil?
He says, well, you're going to have to hold on.
I don't know where they're going with it this morning.
Yeah, really.
Well, we don't need it.
Right up to Opalaka's matter of fact.
And I think to the post office.
Now all of a sudden it doesn't sound so bad.
I think the first few minutes, like I'm getting the mong out of my system.
Learning how to use the phones.
Seriously, Bert.
What do you mean learning how to use the phone?
What's a different system?
Bert, you really have to do something besides cackles.
Oh, come on, sir.
Now let's.
I hate to get on you the first or the second call.
No, you don't.
Yeah, don't get on him, sir.
If he covered with feathers from head to toe.
It's serious.
It's working well so far.
Let's not screw this.
We got a full board of calls at 6, 10 in the morning.
Let's not.
You notice how I slip the time in there very cleverly, right?
I'm going to say that.
I'm going to say that.
I'm going to say to four.
What are you going to do on two?
You have to do that between every call.
I know.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Well, listen, it's been great, but I think you're out of material, sir.
Bye.
Have an oh, first was good.
Yeah, we said goodbye.
First power calls are complained.
We want to thank our friends.
Are they still our friends over at the hot 105?
Oh, yeah.
Is that a first, by the way, is that the first time other call letters have been mentioned on Zeta?
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
We talk about them all day.
Do you really?
Oh, yeah.
Between every other record, we'll say like another station's call letters.
I'm on the air.
Okay.
He got the air.
Okay.
She.
We got any good shidi's we're going to play today?
We're going to play heat.
We're going to play he these are the relation.
Yeah, you want to put it up a little bit.
That's the only reason Lee is in the under show, by the way.
We wanted to put things up a little bit because on FM, you know, you can't be quite as
phased on AM.
Anyway, one of the thank Dan McKay, Marilyn La Blanc and Jim Skyler are good friends at hot 105
for sending over those poison bananas this morning.
Exactly what I request.
And I want to give you a little hint is who's going to be testing the first one.
Okay.
Speaking of the first one, here comes.
Isn't that amazing how that works on the speaker phone?
That's when it sounds bad.
Our first Palm Beach call.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Good morning.
I just want to know that we're awake in Boca and listening to you.
Well, turn over and go back to sleep, sir.
I wish I could.
I got to go to work, though.
We're all getting ready to go to work.
All the radios are switched over back to FM again.
Great.
Just want to let you know we're in Boca.
Looking forward to listening to your show on FM.
In fact, the bird even sounds better on FM.
Well, now let's not go crazy.
Don't get carried away.
Oh, really?
You may not get as many complaints on the bird now.
You've got a good voice on FM.
Well, wait a minute.
Let me ask you something because it's kind of a rating.
We got this hurricane business and all the other stuff.
The FM isn't crackling and popping and right.
Oh, not at all.
Puking, right?
Real smooth, huh?
Oh, yeah, real smooth.
Great.
Pointless exciting or what?
Okay.
Well, listen, thanks a lot.
I realize you got to get to work.
Good luck to you, Neil.
Have a wonderful life.
Plus, he didn't have much to say anyway.
But, you know, the weird things they can actually hear is inside buildings on the FM, you know.
We're going to have to get used to that.
Like Superman.
Oh, man.
Can I do that first?
What's that?
Oh, boy.
I'm sorry.
I should have waited a little bit.
I should have done that right at the top of the show.
Okay.
This sounds so good.
Wait till I figure out which machines are like that.
Then it's going to be a killer.
Okay.
That's going to be great.
All right.
Are you ready for this?
Yes, sir.
Should we have like a big fanfare or something?
Now, let's just go right into it.
It's a good time for the great taste.
I believe I went 13 minutes without that.
I am blown away.
13 after 6 on Zeta 4.
94 point.
No, you're going to let him say that.
Of course.
Are you going to do the 99?
No, I don't want to do that part.
That's much too complicated.
You realize that he's already said more in 13 minutes.
And he said in the last six months.
It's incredible.
It's incredible.
I just sat there and I'd figure out how much I get paid per word.
That was it.
All right.
So how many complaints have we had the cap of Dave on it?
No music?
I can't believe it.
Okay, I think what we're going to do about six.
Are you trying to control yourself?
This is the big time.
Now, you can't act like a jackass like on the AM.
Oh, I can't.
Okay.
Come yourself.
Why am I here?
All right.
We are going to do something a little specialist morning,
which we'll be repeating.
In fact, one thing I learned it's great about a morning show is,
and I learned it from good old friend of yours too.
You can keep repeating the same crap over and over and over again.
You're recycling audience.
You don't understand?
Like six 30.
Six 30.
All 20 of these people will be gone.
We have another 20 people at six 30.
That's true.
And in at six 30, we can start doing the same stuff we've done before.
I was going to make that call.
Does this line work?
That doesn't sound like it.
Oh, this one.
Ah!
Oh!
It works.
Okay.
Whoops.
What do I got to do?
Dial line?
Yeah.
Just relax, folks.
There you go.
Now?
These phones don't work.
I'm telling you, this is new phone system.
We dial a long distance?
No.
Yeah.
We are?
Oh, you don't have to dial one.
That's right.
You don't have to dial one.
Just the area.
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Hold it.
That's the signal for your long distance access.
Oh, boy.
You want to put mine in?
What is it?
Will you dump it after I tell you?
Will you dump it?
Please after I tell you?
You got to put it in now?
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Oh, listen to that.
You have one too.
I've told you.
No.
I use Gary Lawrence's access now for long distance.
Oh, well so do I.
Okay, here it comes now.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Can you say, kinky?
That was 976.
Kinky, I think.
Something like that.
I'm just curious.
Somebody just waking up at 6.15 in the morning on a Monday morning.
What's the thing to that?
This is what they're into now.
This could be a whole new format.
That's so loosely.
Save that number, okay?
Yeah.
Save it for me.
What I like best about some of these machines.
The lights light up.
Some of them don't light up.
It's like kind of like pot luck.
Exactly.
That's the idea.
Okay, now you're going to be doing in about four minutes and 20 seconds.
It's going to keep everything very tight.
Man.
Or, you know, a little after that.
And update on Floyd.
And update on Floyd.
Is that pink Floyd or what?
It's hurricane Floyd.
It sounds like a real wimpy hurricane.
Doesn't it?
I mean, what do you think of when you think of the name Floyd?
Floyd the barber.
In Andy Gryffer.
Yeah, of course.
Me too.
Not as bad as a West Coast.
They have where they have hurricane Ramon.
Ramon.
It should have been reversed, I think.
I think we should have had Ramon and uh, uh, whatever.
Floyd sounds something the Midwest might get hit with.
Yeah.
But there's no reason to panic.
Like in Iowa.
No reason to panic.
As you start picking on Iowa.
Oh, don't start with that, Neal.
Great idea.
Now, you know, I was born and raised in Florida and my parents, you still...
Do we care?
Well, my point is that my parents, you should always tell me about the...
When these storms came up and it's something for you to remember if you're not from here,
they're only wind and rain.
There's no reason to panic is my point.
We're just going to have a rainy, windy day.
I feel a bit about it already.
Go ahead.
Run around.
It's a voice of reason here.
The ladies and gentlemen.
Everything's fine.
Yeah, everything's okay.
Everything's okay.
Just relax.
Okay, let's call up Neal Frank and see if we can get everybody panicked for that.
Just a joke.
He's in Houston.
He's doing great.
No problem.
Okay.
We got all these calls sitting here.
I feel guilty.
Should we take another one?
Cap and Dave?
Don't be a guilty.
Okay.
Dave County, good morning.
Welcome.
Welcome to Zeta 94.9.
Yes.
Three, two.
How you doing?
All right, King.
Complain.
Number one.
Speak up, sir.
The reason why I called was to tell you that...
On my radio, I couldn't be sure that I had the right station.
I heard Donald and his good buddy over there.
But I wasn't positive until I heard CCR.
Then I knew I had to...
Yeah, that did it.
We do that, so you make sure you're tuning in.
If you get up like a quarter to six in the morning, you're tuning in the right station.
You play a couple of doors, cuts.
Absolutely.
Well, it's, you know, certain stations have their radio check.
Well, this is the first way of having a radio check.
Exactly.
Great.
I enjoyed it, and I think whoever was on before you...
What are you doing up so early in the morning, sir?
What kind of a maniac gets up into the shower in the morning?
Well, you really wanted to...
Please.
Well, diabetic, so you got to get that little extra cut in there, you know.
Make sure that the level's up there right.
And then you go back to sleep.
Yeah.
I'm going to cut you.
Yeah.
That's security guards.
That's well, that's true.
And it's good to hear you on FM.
Isn't it? Isn't it the truth?
Even the bird sounds a little better out there.
A little better, yeah.
A little better.
The nerd sounds a little better, yeah.
You notice he qualified that, yeah.
Well, I don't want him to get a slow and a half.
Now you're right, sir.
You're absolutely...
This is a family radio check.
Absolutely.
Let's not talk about that too much.
Okay, well listen, I have a wonderful day.
You're in a great life, and if we don't talk to you again...
Well, you know this is a good way that you're going to give a lot of people a new life.
I think so.
Really?
Okay.
Take care.
I'll read the urge.
Okay, is it that time we played the other one, but it's...
No, not for you yet.
You got to have it yet.
It's 690, Ritza.
But I think it's long overdue.
And the best part of this is it's scratchy.
This is very scratchy because it's so old.
Okay, you don't know what it is yet.
Have no idea.
You like it.
You can't wait.
Are you ready?
I love the quality.
You're right.
Is everybody ready?
This might germ out of bed this morning.
I think it will.
The beginning is special.
By the way, if Peter Bulger's listing you're a wonderful guy.
And the music you don't want to get to it.
We'll get to it.
I know.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
My heart.
Don't worry.
My heart.
My heart.
Don't worry.
Okay, not too much.
Don't want to overdo it right to the beginning.
But was that good or what?
In stereo.
Yeah.
Well, like I said, you have to partner on FM.
We understand scratchy.
Because it's so old.
Right.
It's like a collector's item.
Like what was it?
WWJ and KDKA.
Mm-hmm.
Were the first stations on here by 1920?
And this was right on the heels of that.
Okay, here comes your big test.
Don't start going into a laughing jack now.
Okay.
Because this is your big moment.
Okay.
That we've been waiting for.
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is.
Got his wings all plucked up this morning now.
20 past six on Zeta 4.
This is the Neorodger show.
This is your brain.
Any questions?
Boy, that sounds like a real newscast and everything with the intro.
I love it.
Well, if you get to the news, maybe it'll still be going.
621 on Zeta 4.
I'm Glenn Hill on the Neorodger show.
The main thing we'll be talking about today in the news,
of course, is about Floyd as it nears Hurricane Force.
And we have Hurricane Warnings in effect for the Florida Keys
from Key Largo through the dry tortillas
and for the Southwest Coast of Florida,
South of Venice, that does not include Sarasota.
But a Hurricane Watch now in effect from Venice to Tarpen Springs
and a tropical storm watch in effect for the Florida East Coast
from Key Largo to Jupiter, England and a tropical storm watch
also in effect for Bimini and the Grand Bahama Islands in the Bahamas.
Also, a tornado watch, National Weather Service is issued,
a tornado watch for most of Central and Southern Florida.
This includes us and this is from 7 this morning until 4
Monday afternoon, tornadoes, large hail, dangerous lightning,
damaging thunderstorm winds all possible in our area.
Now, the watch area is along in 75 miles east and west of the line,
west of Orlando, to 45 miles southwest of Miami.
And of course, as I keep telling you,
don't panic, a tornado watch just means now in the oil that conditions are favorable.
In other words, it's just possible.
I don't want you running around.
Here's where the storm is 24.0 north and 83.5 light huts,
about 120 miles west, southwest of Key West,
or about 200 miles southwest of Fort Myers.
That's 24.0 north, 83.5 west and it's moving towards the northeast
at 15 miles an hour, expected to turn more north eastward.
And this should bring the center along the lower west coast of Florida,
probably this afternoon.
The highest winds have now increased to 70 miles an hour,
and winds of 40 miles an hour extend about 125 miles north of the center.
Key West reported gusts to tropical storm force in the past hour.
Floyd could become a hurricane anytime this morning,
and you should just be prepared for this possibility.
Why are you building like to a crescendo?
Yeah, I'm going to say a moment ago, don't panic.
Don't worry.
Everybody stay calm.
And it's like he's building.
If you don't decide, yeah, it's just wind and rain.
It's just another storm, right?
Just relax.
Tell us about the big hail.
How big, Glenn?
We talking canned ham's here or what?
Died three to five feet above normal.
Only three to five feet above normal.
Like watermelon size hay.
Nothing even.
All right, next advisory.
Look at that.
I just caught Captain Dave Yawning in the other...
I saw that.
I saw it.
Okay, we're making little marks on all of these moves.
All right, so this is what we're mainly going to concentrate on.
Anything else?
Just the weather forecast, tropical storm, watch in effect,
and we're expecting cloudy and rain today and tonight.
Winds are possible up to 30 miles an hour in South Florida,
and we'll keep you advised on any further developments
or anything that happens with that.
I have no idea what the temperature is.
You want to just get one up about 175.
Around 75.
On Zeta 4, 94.9, it's 624.
I'm Glenn Hill.
Past six at Zeta 4, boy, almost did it.
I knew what was going on.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I almost said on she.
Just a joke, okay?
It's just a little joke.
Mr. Sports will be along at 635,
and he's got some real depressing news.
All the scab scores.
Oh yeah.
For all your scamblers out there in the audience.
Did the dofs win?
Yeah, the one.
No, not the dofs.
The scammed doffins, one 42 to zip.
Good.
25,000 people I was over at Calder.
I broke my streak yesterday.
Had a winning day?
No, you did.
Went to Pompidol last night, gave some of it back.
I like to spread it around.
You know, like manure.
I spread it all over Dayton, Broward County.
So did you break 10 bucks?
Oh, it was all over?
Barely.
Just not too much more.
Okay, we're going to play the George Harrison.
Now, the interesting part of it,
you know, I feel guilty about these people on phone.
You're going to play a record?
We're going to play our record.
Now, don't panic because we're not going to play a lot of music.
But we know on his first morning,
a lot of those pinnities, bureaucrats, are listed.
What was the music?
Man, he made a play, paint Floyd me.
The one I was, paint Floyd is coming up later.
Much later, like sign one of Derrick's Island show.
But we are going to play the, this record is so good.
I'm obsessed.
Yeah.
Can I admit that that I'm obsessed?
Oh, boy.
Something else you're obsessed with, okay?
Well, you thought it was the electric light orchestra first,
because it sounds like you're just...
Well, it sounds like you're just...
...produced by Jeff Lyd.
Right.
You have any idea what the title is?
So I'm going to play a little bit of my music.
No, I have no idea.
No, I don't either.
Do we know what the title is?
What is it?
He doesn't know what it is, but it's great.
He's been playing.
The guy's had a lot of pressure in there.
Does it matter what the title is?
There comes this sign, isn't it?
Yeah, something like that.
Okay, I think we're going to play it.
But I want to, you know, we're going to build into it.
Like it about 640, we'll probably play it.
I just want to get, even with him, you know.
He's been giving us little hand signs like this.
And I want to keep waking up a little bit, okay?
Okay, George Harrison, I'm saying it, and I promise you,
we're not going to overdo this, okay?
I'm going to noise over there.
Russell the paper over.
Excellent.
What are you doing?
Getting your next newscast together out of the newspaper?
Out of this coloring book.
A slow newsday, Glengest weather.
That was it.
That's it. That's all that's going on.
Welcome to Florida.
Yeah.
Do you like Florida?
You're a flyer.
So far.
The Neil Rogers.
Tell him that I've never heard of smuddy or program in my life.
Okay, thank you so much.
A little tissue buff greeting from our friend Rabbi Sam.
Took it.
We're going to have services, by the way, on a show.
We are.
It's going to be the only morning show in town on FM with religious services.
Every morning, we're going to convert.
I think we ought to take a call, don't you?
Yeah.
People have been waiting like a lifetime.
Dave County, are you there?
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
You must not work, right?
Yeah.
You're one?
Hello.
Hello.
Sir, speak to me, sir.
Wake up.
I'm kind of nervous.
I never called this guy.
But nevertheless.
Is this Joey Reynolds?
Yeah.
What a shot, sir.
What a shot.
Just for that.
A little memorial to here.
Okay, for this caller.
Only for you, sir.
Let me see.
I'm a little nervous.
I never called them already.
They're new in the right.
Okay, and he hung up during that.
Well, you only want a nerd?
He'd be ill in the middle.
He'd be real ill in this morning.
Obviously.
Oh.
Broward, you say what?
Joey.
What just be funny?
That's it.
That's a good call.
Now I see why you went to these calls.
Well, we want to get him out of the way, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Should we take that other bokeh call?
I'd say this much, boy.
They're flashing.
You're intrigued by a bokeh line.
It just amazes you that we have that.
Yeah.
Boca.
Yeah, good morning, you know.
Are you really in bokeh?
Yeah, I really am.
This is Terry up in bokeh.
Hey, well, nothing's perfect.
Terry, just remember that.
This just goes to prove I need a life.
I've just spent 20 minutes on hold before dawn.
Jesus.
What is that teller?
I beg your pardon?
Len has never sounded like that.
Oh, my gosh.
You also said dry corticas.
Yeah, tortillas.
I got that.
Those are delicious, I think.
For a Florida.
There's one right under your banana over there, by the way.
Yeah, really.
Listen, I think that the storm is all just talk.
I think the other strations are trying to divert attention from you this morning.
Yeah, is that Gary Owen's in the studio with you guys?
Yes, he's got his hand over his rear right now.
Good morning.
Really, I got up at 5 o'clock to adjust all my radios.
And it just, like I said, it just goes to prove I really need a life.
Yeah.
Are you going to get one this week?
I certainly hope so.
You guys sound great on the FM.
Legion led makes dancing like a tender of my god.
You got something caught in a stroke?
Well, we don't want to get into that.
Okay, I had to call earlier.
I started.
Okay, have a wonderful day, sir, and a great life.
Thank you.
I'll read the urge.
Should we do the sports like I've been in early, Mr. Sports?
Do you think he could get into it?
Sure.
No, we're right.
Maybe 35.
We're right at 35 on Zeta 4.
It looks like 634 on Zeta 4 to me.
Mr. Time expert.
He's rubber clocking again.
Yeah.
Getting those quarter hours in, aren't you, Glenn?
There you go.
Okay, listen, this guy is going to really be a big addition to the show.
Trust me.
Okay.
Does it matter yet?
No.
See a little guy in a booth?
Mm-hmm.
You look very carefully.
Good morning, everybody.
Two teams that haven't been in the World Series since the 1960s
hold the upper hand of the league playoffs in baseball.
Minnesota Quinn, thanks to Darryl Evans, inept play lead the American League Championship Series
three games to one.
After last night's five, three win over the Tigers.
And the Giants and the National League ran the free to two lead in their best-to-seven
series by beating the Cardinal 6-3.
The Giants and the Carders who win their postseason matchup at Bush Stadium tomorrow night.
And the Cardinal and the twins and the Tigers, let me say it again, the twins and the Tigers
will play the Sanfordone in game number six-five.
The National Football League strike is now at its 21st day in contract.
Talks have broken down.
NFL Chief Negotiator Jack Dunlund blames the union for erecting a Roe block with its
newest free agency plan.
Union leader, Gene Upshaws, has management with DRAWL.
That's with DRAWL from the bargaining table was orchestrated to tax the solidarity of striking
players and freeing scant fans out there.
These are the scores yesterday in the WIMB and NFL.
The WIMB Buffalo 14-7 used in beat Cleveland 15-10 Chicago 27-7.

fans.
National Hockey League yesterday's here already, Buffalo beat Washington 65.
It was the Bruins 5 Hartford 2, Chicago 5, Philadelphia 3.
Edmonton beat Los Angeles 92.
And that's it.
New this fall on Sonya People's Television.
It's a beautiful day for a communist.
Unless you're on the KGB list, you will do time in a salt mine.
You will do slave labor.
Hello, boys and girls.
This is Mr. Rogers.
Welcome to my neighborhood scheme.
Oh, I bet that's my Russian postman, called Red McFailey.
Hey, coming.
You know, he's kind of a funny postman.
Sure.
Not only does he deliver my name, he likes to open it too.
I guess he's just kind of curious.
Sure.
Fred Rogers.
Oh, hi, Mr. Secret Policeman.
Please do me a coming with me.
But why?
Can you say crimes against state?
I think so.
Can you say CIA spy?
Oh, sure.
Come on, let's go.
A dose for Downey Avoisinger.
Pleased to be watching Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.
He live from Siberia for next 20 years.
Can you say kinky?
Okay.
23-03-07 at Zeta 4.
Neil Rogers with you on a Monday morning with lead July Glen Hill,
Captain Dave, Mr. Sports, said a bunch of other would be human beings.
I liked Mr. Sports.
Did you like it?
I think he's going to be great.
He was your type.
No question about that.
He was your type.
Now, we're not going to have the weather fairy is at the deal.
He didn't make the cut or more.
You'll be here later in the week.
Okay.
Well, let's see.
We were very close.
We were very close.
We were kind of psychic temperature.
78 degrees on Zeta 4.
What time is it, Glen?
Do I do another time check?
94.
Maybe we can just keep giving the time all morning.
You know what I'm saying?
The hell with his other stuff.
Okay.
That vocal line is, by the way, not flashing again.
We're going to have to condition those people.
And you know me, I get very insecure.
Very insecure.
Make it clear it's toll free.
550.
Oh, yeah, that'll do it.
There's just one guy that uses it all the time.
That's it.
Yeah.
Is he a chronic?
No, we got another guy coming over from the AM now.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
You know who I mean?
Yeah.
Couple of them.
It's a matter of a chronic.
Yes.
And don't worry.
We will use that line.
I mean, 550.
90.
90.
Let's get Larry Kendan here to do trade line.
Great idea.
Please remind me as a morning wanes on to get into this thing
from the Sun.
Oh, wow.
Was this on Saturday?
Saturday.
Disgusting.
I'm going to get plenty of time.
Yeah, I want to wait till a bill.
Make sure Bill Kelly is awake.
Well, since he's a new big guy.
Anybody out there knows Bill Kelly, call him and home and wake him up.
Good idea.
You're going to have to because he's a new big guy.
Because we're going to rip him a rear, the likes of which seldom has been seen since the
Oprah Winfrey show.
I mean, it is going to be, even our lean Ross is going to be embarrassed.
Why the way?
Where do we have that thing?
We have somewhere a little clip, which I'm going to play a little later on from this morning's
news on WINC AM, our sister in law station up in the other end of the building.
It is incredible.
Okay, let's take some more calls.
I mean, we know one here already.
You'd argue we've been here a lifetime, right?
It almost sounds like we know what we're doing.
Line three says Captain Dave.
Captain Dave is just finally waking up now.
You notice he's finally getting into it.
He's washing his hands in his face and putting him under our armor.
I would trust him.
Would you?
Yeah.
Well, that's because you worked at that place together for years.
We worked at another radio station together.
Broward County, how you doing?
Yeah, dude.
Hey, dude.
How you doing, dude?
That's a big fight.
Holy cow, this guy says.
What the hell happened in?
Wow, wow.
Just, it's early in the morning, you know what I'm saying?
Like, don't get too carried away.
He's been up all night.
Hey, oh, man.
Are you the guy that's been on hold since Saturday?
So you could talk to me since Friday.
Friday, about two o'clock.
They tell, oh, league, congratulations.
Congratulations, Lee.
You're okay with league power on numbers.
I know it's two big ones.
Hey.
Yes?
Speak to us, sir.
Come on.
Come here.
No music.
No music?
You mean you didn't like George Harrison?
Yeah, this is my boyfriend's back.
Oh, well, no.
That's coming up.
Yeah.
That's coming up next hour.
Not a bad suggestion.
All right, dude.
I gotta get to work.
I'm late already.
Okay, good luck to you.
All right, bye.
Okay, that's what we like.
Callers who are willing to be late to work too.
Wait on the phone for a half an hour to talk to us.
Yeah, but it's a matter of priority.
Of course.
Come on.
Get your priority straight.
What are these?
This, this, this I gotta go to work, bit, you know.
But this is good.
They'll get off quicker, you know.
Calls would be short.
How come that vocal line's not ringing?
It's nobody awake up there.
We're gonna have one like in Jupiter, you know.
For all the good people are Palm Beach Garden.
I agree.
I agree.
I'm gonna install this coffee pot from as Jupiter.
If, uh, wait a minute, if they call from West Palm,
do they get through like magically on it?
Because somebody said the other day that these lines are like all over the place.
Yeah, we used to have a West Palm line.
What happened to that?
I have no idea that it's the new phone system.
Yeah, West Palm line.
It's not the new phone system.
It was the Zeta deficit that they had to pull that line up.
I see.
Because it did used to go to Jupiter.
That's why they're making this desperate move to bring us over here,
according to Bill Kelly.
Desperate.
Desperate.
Okay, let's give some chance for him to get coherent and wake up before you rip him down.
Polka's lit.
Should we take Boka?
Of course.
You other people get very upset because we take him out of order,
but, uh, to hell with them, huh?
Boka, how you doing?
Good.
Are you in Boka?
Yeah.
See, I told you.
What's up?
Speak to us.
What?
What?
Who is this?
Boka.
Did we wake you up?
No.
Okay.
Go away to school.
You realize you're our first female caller?
Wow.
Wow.
How is lead Gillette's voice gotten to you so far, man?
I don't know.
How old are you, dear?
Unimpressed.
How old?
16.
16.
Unimpressed.
Yeah.
How about my voice?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Not gonna be out of place.
Is there anything that stimulates you, man?
No.
Okay.
Good.
And you're in Boka, right?
Yep.
Perfect.
Great.
Actually.
Okay, well, it should have a wonderful day and you're gonna be here every morning with us?
Yep.
Look at the point.
Okay, this is like I said, a great caller from Boka.
Thanks a lot.
Okay, bye-bye.
What a good caller.
Interesting demographics.
Yeah.
16.
Brightening.
War.
That is...
We cannot corrupt our youth now, you know?
I'm not on the show.
No, no.
No way.
Can you say kinky?
Okay.
Let's go back to, uh, two.
Okay, Captain Dave, anything you say, man?
Dave Cowdy, hello.
Hill.
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
This is great, these, uh, you know, being out in the morning now, I can just call them when I get put on hold.
I can just go to sleep with the fun against my air.
Very good.
Good idea.
Or wherever, you know.
Yeah.
Somebody else is pretty upset this morning, I...
Who's that?
I didn't get the full number this morning, so I accidentally dialed 559-4-FM.
And I asked for a nail and they weren't so much better than this.
Really?
Yeah, but, you know, I guess that's their own problem, right?
Did Donald call you, Madam?
No, he called Donald, man.
Oh, okay.
At least somebody had it right.
You know, um, I think he should be pretty, uh, pretty impressed, this is your first Kendall call.
Wow.
Wow.
How's the weather in Kendall this morning?
Oh, it's, uh, pretty sunny and it's about to...
Is this Captain Kendall?
Right, yeah.
I know that voice anywhere.
Yeah, well, I want to say also that, uh, out here in Kendall, we are able to take advantage of...
You know, you've been on this early in the morning while it's still dark outside.
We're over here right now with the Bird's apartment, and we're ransacking it.
Very nice, actually.
But I tell you, these droppings and the newspaper all over the floor is very unpleasant.
Yeah, Miami-Herald all over the floor.
Just leave the VCR, sir.
Anything else I really am not interested in?
You know what the best part of this show is?
And the cuddle bone.
Leave the cuddle bone.
You know what the best part of the show is so far, we have had nobody upset over the...
Where is the music, you know?
I know.
Not one complaint, nobody.
Excuse me, I've got a question for you guys.
What's a question?
Where is the music?
Well, you don't have a good time, it's great listening to you on FM and take care.
Okay, you too, sir.
Bye-bye.
I'll read the darch.
Okay, no, real smart-ass here.
It's 16-D-4-7 at Zeta-4, and uh, before you're going to be doing the weather again in six minutes, huh?
I'm ready.
I'm ready and ready.
We got the temperature now, and what time is it, Glenn?
I got a couple of other stories here, don't worry.
I was wondering if we're going to milk that all week long.
No, no, no, it's about a quarter of seven.
We don't want to get too exact here, right?
It's around a quarter of seven.
Like they do on FM, you know, somewhere between 630 and 7, you know.
Hey, if you're late for work and get that second cup of coffee.
Okay.
Okay.
I think of that, Lee.
You're going to have to bear with us.
This is our first day here, but hey.
All listen to you.
Remember, I told you in the summer they listened.
Oh, yeah, how old is your son?
14.
Oh, really?
Wow, that's not interesting.
That's a very good deal.
I know.
Well, listen, I'll get your number off the ear, and we'll have a little tea party tonight.
Oh, wonderful.
Just you and me.
So glad you're here in the morning.
Well, you sound really, are you really in Boca?
I am really in Boca.
That's West Boca.
Doesn't she sound like she's right in the room all alone?
I know, I know.
Sounds better than my mic, doesn't it?
A lot better.
Your mic is on.
No, it's these cans.
You can't hear anything.
Not even hear it.
Oh my, oh, my.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
They really...
I know how to whip these people to shape my face.
I can't believe they did.
I can't believe they gave me...
Hello, Neal.
And they still too old men, sector me here.
Are they still too loud?
No.
Because I'll turn them down and then up again real quick.
Yes, I'm sorry.
So, it's wonderful.
I love you in the morning.
Leigh just lost three pits out of his watermelon.
Go ahead, man.
No, just happy that you're here in the morning.
I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown
when you went off that other station.
But now I see them not.
See, one of the advantages to this is that until at least about 8.15 or 8.30,
all of the pain in the ass bureaucrats aren't here yet.
That's true.
You come in early in the morning, get most of the show out of the way.
And then, you know, they come in, they get organized, get their coffee,
goof around, have a couple of free bagels and stuff like that.
And by the time they're finished with that, we're gone.
We're out of here.
Speaking of bagels.
You're going to bring your breakfast.
Yeah, that's how you're just going to be food alone.
No food alone.
All right, come on.
No, wait a minute.
That's not me, isn't that what we were told?
No, that's a next two.
You find a contract that said no food is allowed.
No, as a matter of fact, I haven't signed any contract yet.
So, what I'm going to, I guess I'll hold that as a bargaining chip.
Yeah.
Well, have a super day.
And by the way, if you're listening, Gary, today is D-Day, okay?
I want to put any pressure on you.
But, you know, let's see that contract with those big number.
Okay, listen, have a great day.
What's your son's name?
No, he's listening.
Just the first name.
All right, listen to E.
You too.
Eric.
You got it.
See, I know.
I know.
Okay, listen, you know, tell Eric have a wonderful life.
I will.
Thank you, me also.
Bye-bye.
Okay, boy, she was nervous, wasn't she?
Well, with reason.
Why?
By the way, I must confess, when I'm wrong, I'm wrong, okay?
Very simple.
I saw the preview for Stand By Me.
The preview, right?
You know the one that goes on for like, you know what I mean?
Like, 10 minutes, a filler, like a nishio.
And I was wrong.
Okay, yeah.
About River Phoenix.
What about him?
Well, I was wrong.
How about a little clue?
Okay.
Just a little kid.
You know what I'm saying?
He's just a little kid.
But you still haven't seen the entire movie.
No, but they have this thing where they're interviewing the two kids who are like the stars.
Who's the other one?
Well, we, boy, she's like, no, this is so straight.
He's like a walking encyclopedia of useless crap.
Yeah.
A head full of useless crap.
Yeah.
A body full of useless crap.
Perfect, yeah, 5 news, man.
But I guess that's like a current interview.
You know, they're talking in retrospect about the movie.
Right.
And now, of course, they're no longer little puny kids.
They're like, a little older puny kids.
Like, 16 now.
And trust me, I can understand why some of our more desperate people in the audience are all upset.
Now, if you've seen that movie, please stand by me.
I saw the first time we got a last Saturday night.
We were talking about this the other day.
Yeah.
I liked it.
Did you hear that?
He liked it.
Neil still hasn't had fun.
I just went on.
I can't hear it.
That right.
Neil has not seen the entire movie.
He's judging this movie by seeing like the last hour of the movie.
How are we going to go through this again?
Just briefly.
I mean, every day do we have to do stand by me.
Every single day.
Is that part of our revolutionary format here instead of reviewing a different movie every day?
We're going to review the same movie every day.
By the way, Don Stutter.
I'm so glad you mentioned movie reviews.
Don Stutter.
Did you hear any of you yesterday?
About 20 minutes.
About 20 minutes.
Interesting.
Maybe 25.
You talk about putting the AM in a freezer.
You know what I'm saying?
The deep freeze.
I mean, that man, he could do more damage in four hours than most of us can do in a lifetime.
What I was just listening to him, he was pushing his own advertising agency.
No, he was pushing buttons when I was trying to get the cart machines to work.
And you know the one that we queue up the carts in that sits on top.
He was trying to play that on the...
And it was great.
It was...
What a show, Don.
I'm telling you.
I thought, did you just hold the earphones up to the mic?
I think so.
I will say this.
His performance on the ear is only outdone by his movie reviews.
Did you see a soul man with P-Town's mouth?
The fact I did watch part of that.
It is the last hour.
And I didn't like the last hour of that either.
It is coming on my cable.
I saw the ad for it.
It's coming on HBO movie.
It will be on HBO very soon.
Classic.
I will get to see it.
You don't have to tape it for me.
It's about the kid that goes to Harvard and with the shoe polish.
He'd be black, yeah.
P-Town's Hall.
Or it's the Thomas Hall.
Or one of those letters.
He'd be chilling.
D-Town's Hall.
Something.
Cute movie.
You going to give the time now?
713.
We got it right now.
We've got it right now.
Absolutely on the button.
I just got the power of the morning.
Something special.
This isn't one of those comedians from the...
Oh, no more comedians on this show.
They haven't got the word up front.
A little note here.
I bet you this is from Joey.
You want to bet?
I bet it is too.
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
B-Hallo, I know this is not legit.
You telling me!
Who's it from?
It's says Marvin Bailey in town.
Oh...
Oh god.
Marvin, not Marlon.
Marvin...
Marvin, Bailey in town, air scout created by Pat Art, you
Das Melmak, iyi, Die Beat, Veron External.
Kofi Zeifying.
Rangers NHK Crisis Correct
from your good friend Marlin Bailey. Marvin Bailey.
Marvin Bailey. You know, thank you very much.
Don't call us. We'll call you.
When do that's really from?
Well, when he came in there like that, that was kind of freaky wasn't it?
No, right when we were talking about Jeff Stryker.
It depends on the coincidence or...
I'll put a lock on that door.
I know. Anyway, just about to explain the lead.
Oh!
Oh!
It sounds like a programming meeting.
You know something? I bet you we could just...
I bet you we could just play this all morning for four hours.
Do a couple of news breaks, little weather.
And get a three.
Three.
Get a five with this.
It sounds so much better in stereo.
Yeah.
And we could play Stans Frogs, you know, sort of alternate.
Okay, thanks Jeff.
And periodically we're going to be calling Jeff on a West Coast, which is good because when we come on,
it's six in the morning, Eastern time, three in the California time.
And they're just getting in. They're all getting in at that.
Perfect.
It'll be great.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Glenn, you still haven't told me about your fetishes.
He becaates.
He becaates. I know about that.
Yeah.
That's my fetish.
Sure. Big Don Ho fan.
That's about it.
Big Don Ho fan.
Oh!
Have all this compact disc.
Just what we needed, right?
Now, Conjure's supposed to be here to butcher up the image in the show and always pull in the stand major.
I know.
Now, Conjure up in your mind, a Don Ho CD.
I've got him.
I'm serious.
I will bring the men.
Okay.
I need bubbles.
We've got an incredible live version of Little Shack by the sea.
Not a cheap life jackalore too much.
A whole life urge to be going dano.
Yeah.
Number one.
That's the tip off.
And what's the story on his hair, by the way, in that series that lock a curly,
lock he had over his forehead, jackalore, whatever's in his solution statement.
Yeah.
He bought those at the Awakeake Deli.
Okay.
So now, Neil's fetish is chef striker.
Mine is fake.
No, no, I don't have any Jeff striker fetish.
I don't need, I never even met the guy.
Boy, do you wish he comes down here alive.
Wrong.
Not interested in the least bit of each other.
Other, other, a gigantic grotesque, disgusting,
vulgar thing.
Go ahead.
Thing.
Thing.
We're on FM.
We can be a little more open about this.
Can we open on FM?
And we get more explicit.
I heard that a lot of the jocks on FM are real open, but we'll save that for tomorrow morning.
Okay.
There we go.
Thanks a lot, pal, with a champagne agreement.
Is there a champagne in there too?
I would imagine, right?
Yeah.
Cat me on.
We want that.
I'm sure.
Cat me on.
But it's that sauce about 830.
He gets going real good.
That's from working at gloves 94.
That's right.
All those gloves rejects, man.
They hit the sauce about 830 in the morning.
True.
Now and a half before sunny starts.
Speaking of sunny, did we have,
did we have a big message from sunny this morning?
Did we?
I don't think so.
I'm assuming.
You're going to go, you're going to go, you're going to go.
Get a banana here.
Okay.
Sonny's going to be along with the Mongolian news a little later,
but it's at time again.
Can you believe it?
It seems like, I know it's 820.
Before you know it.
I know.
Before you know it, this message is going to be over.
Not you must admit that
two hours and 20 minutes.
You've got, you've had a chance to say more today
than you have in the last year.
This is incredible.
It is, I mean truly.
And that's all he keeps saying.
This is a just horrible thing.
This is incredible.
So emotionally blown away.
I'm exhausted.
This is so early in the morning.
All right.
Now listen, I know that you've taken a lot of excitement
and this was pretty good here when
Marvin Bailey sent this stuff.
And if when Don Ho comes in,
you are just going to freak out.
It's 820 on Zay...
Hey young man.
Listen, I've seen you hanging around my house
and I have some I want to talk to you about.
What is it Mr. Bailey?
I wasn't here now.
I'm going to put it this way.
Yeah.
Wasn't you, who did the pushin?
Put the stains upon the cushion.
Put prints on the dashboard upside down.
Hey.
Hey what?
Who wasn't you?
You Braco Bill been messing with my daughter Jill.
If it was, you'd better leave this town.
Well, you got to say.
Yes, to us, I who did the pushin,
put the stains upon the cushion,
put prints on the dashboard upside down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But since I'm messing with your daughter,
I have a trouble passing water.
So I guess we're even all around.
Why you wait?
Come over here.
Come over here.
Come over here.
Love that spot, Glen.
It's 848 on Zayda 4,
the New Roger Show on a Monday morning.
And just now, you know, when the show is over today,
we're just really going to be getting in with.
We are.
So maybe Gunsor could stay home for a while.
No chance.
No.
Don't even think about it.
Gunsor's already here.
He's been here for an hour.
Is he really?
Thank you, paranoid,
because he easily didn't get here to about like, you know,
I just don't know.
No, he's getting into it now.
Don't you understand?
Okay.
Just wanted a clarification on that.
Because this show is not temporary.
No, it is not.
By the way, if you haven't got the word,
this show is not temporary.
Listen, on the Breakfast Club,
we ought to do this a little retrospective
on those three and a half weeks.
Lovely, we used.
In retrospect, it was only temporary,
but it was beautiful.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm right.
But the retro is effective.
The retro is effective.
They did just the flood of memory.
Emotional.
I just remember.
It was into my head.
It's blown away.
I couldn't believe it.
Gosh, boy, talk about bringing back memories.
Now, Cap and Dave was the Alihar Viyaz
wall of radio.
It was right now.
Unbelievable.
And the Linda Thornton commission,
it's going to investigate that.
What happened?
Okay.
Well, listen, we're going to take some more calls
and in Boca, if you want to get on the line,
that's fine.
And if not, you know,
stick it is the best thing we can say to you.
550, 9490.
I'm embarrassed by giving that number.
Even a moron could remember that number.
And speaking of that, Peter Boulder is in a building.
Just a joke, Peter, just a joke.
He loves it.
He's used to it.
He loves the attention.
And I thought he was going to come in for a minute.
Oh, he's no dummy.
Really?
I thought he was going to come in.
Have a little, uh,
no way.
No way.
So okay.
No way.
But we will give that number for Boca,
which is a little bit different.
It's 550.
Dash.
940.
90.
Yeah, they have a dash in the Boca right?
I see.
And every time I do that,
that damn Boca line rings,
that's what really pisses me off.
You don't sit there.
They're there.
They're there.
I'm serious.
Well, they just want to bug you.
And then once it gets on hold,
I become so curious and to pour people in
Dayton Broward,
they just get left.
I'm not going to do that to him.
Because who's waiting?
In Dayton Broward?
One, two.
Whatever you say, Cap and Dave.
Dave Cowdy, good morning.
Good morning.
Welcome to Zeta.
Thank you.
Welcome you to the airways and this on the FM.
Thank you so much.
Now, I'm wondering if we have an
home income in here with Floyd coming
three weeks before Pink Floyd.
Yeah, I think there's a
definite connection at now.
Yeah, it's not just part of our new
promotional campaign.
I figure we knock out all the wind and rain now.
That way we have a clear concert.
Tony Prado has been hanging around with Weaver the weatherman
and boy, are they whipping up something wild?
I'll tell you.
It sounds like it.
Yeah.
Well,
that was great.
Good thought there.
You go to the Pink Floyd concert?
Yeah, 42nd row.
Have you ever been to Pink Floyd now?
Oh, sure.
Don't go to the show.
It's more fun just to hang out in the parking lot.
After the show, I'm sure.
I watch people try and find their cars.
True.
Very true.
Very true.
I don't know.
I ain't got parking homestead.
I'm not sure.
I know.
Oh, wait a minute.
Then we pay,
we pay a Pink Floyd record just before we get to the box.
Yeah, briefly.
Briefly.
Yeah, that one.
Yeah.
Playing part of it.
We're not playing Pink Floyd today.
Tomorrow.
And we're not playing any money today either.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
That's good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Too early.
Too early for early models.
You hear all that stuff later.
It's too early in the week for any money.
Tomorrow, we're doing our doors montage for about an hour
and get it out of our system.
That's how good.
We don't want to get the regular Zeta listeners.
All the sir coming up.
Yeah.
Later in the week.
Chicago record.
Do we?
I'm a man.
Decided we hated yesterday.
El Paso.
Yeah.
El Paso.
Let me ask you this question.
Do you like Chicago sir?
Um, not the city of the group.
No, not the city of the group.
They have the city of the group.
Okay.
You remember a record called I'm a man?
Not really.
See?
There you go.
I don't either.
I never heard that record.
Yeah.
And these people hold cult records.
It's one of those great AOR, EOR, you know.
Now I'm a man.
I never heard of it.
Spencer Davis group.
No, right?
That's I'm a man.
I mean, that's what you're talking about.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Oh, was it Janet Jackson?
I've heard of it yesterday.
Nobody understood.
Breathing in my, breathing in my llama's ear.
And whisper sweet nothing.
Tito, put a mask on the lawnmower.
Tito working at the post office again.
Yeah.
There he is.
Really is.
Look, it's raining again.
It's pouring.
Yeah.
That's in dogs, sir.
Wait, it's clear and it's clear and gentle.
Uh, go out and get in the traffic.
I feel like I'm trapped in the.
I'm waiting for a truck traffic in the rain.
Go play in some traffic.
It sounds great.
Well, listen, have a wonderful day.
It's been really illuminating listening to you.
And if you go outside, be sure to put on your ass best
those collages.
I'm saying best those shoes.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll read the urge.
That was another call from Kendall.
Boy, we're in big and kind of Kendall.
Yeah.
Kendall, the station is giant.
A monster in Kendall.
Well, what's great is they can hear you in Kendall
down that you're on a family.
Like Frankenstein.
Wait me.
They can hear us in Kendall kidding.
Inside you.
We got a lot more response from Boka on the AM.
Okay.
That's true.
Yeah.
We did get called collect and they really got into that.
You know, they don't have to call collect.
They can call for free.
Oh, so other words, what you're saying is they called only
because they wanted to make us pay for it.
That's right.
And we just make your life miserable.
No, we love spending the company's money.
One of the favorites.
Okay.
Let's try Broward.
Hello.
Hi.
How you doing?
Thank you.
And I just want you to know that this morning,
Joey had been asking listeners to pledge quarter hours.
Now he's asking other radio personalities to pledge their quarter.
Oh, boy.
He doesn't have too many left to give away.
I'll tell you that.
That's true.
And you guys want the school lunch menu for Broward County today?
Absolutely.
Well, we got fish burgers or hoagie sandwiches.
Oh.
Juice, french fries, and a cookie.
Kids go with the hoagie.
That sounds like a good time for the great days.
Yeah.
We have a little actuality somebody called in from Palmetto Jr.
high from Friday during lunch break.
So fish sandwiches, I'm telling you.
These kids get up this morning and his vocabulary lessons.
I want you to know that I have a seven year old daughter
who's listening this morning.
And she wanted to know what the word douchebag means.
Do I call her that she should refer to stand major?
If she opens up her webster and looks under the word stand picture,
that will be right next door.
Now, best of this is supposed to be cancer-quizing agent.
It's really comforting to know that they're using those
asbestos boots to make huge pizzas.
Yeah, you got it.
It's true.
And we, listen, from what I understand,
when I bring my car in for a car wash at your place,
they're, I want to make sure that you vacuum the back seats.
No, prom it on.
And we'll do the trunk if you'd like as well.
That's five bucks extra.
I'm watching the baseball playoffs this week.
And we got a guy named Sparky and a guy named Whitey.
And I want to know where Wally is.
She's Wally?
The Wally's at Metzger's field.
Okay, the beef will be along in about a half an hour.
But they're messing around right now.
I think she's in Boka.
Instead of the bird doing the news,
don't you think the bird's eye view should be in the traffic?
Yeah, yeah.
He has no idea which way the bullman looks along.
He looks a lot like clearance too.
I think I saw him on Elton Road last week in the beaches.
I have a nice life.
You too, sir.
I have it there.
J-35 on Zeta.
You'll never guess who's back in spite of popular demand.
Good morning, everybody.
Two teams that haven't been in the league
since the 1960s hold the upper hand.
We room.
Two teams that haven't been in the league
since the 1960s hold the upper hand in the league playoffs
in baseball.
Minnesota twins thanks to Darrell Evans in F play.
It made the American League championship series three games.
They're exciting.
Probably.
Maybe it's the weather furry to report on Floyd.
Okay, speaking of reporting, it's at time again.
And in the morning, we have a heavy turnover.
But for those of us who have to listen each hour
over and over again, please, you know,
what are you talking about?
Mix it up just a little bit.
Less on news time.
Variety is the spice of life.
News time.
News time.
News time.
That's just 50.
I was going to give it to you now.
Because I figured if I give it to you now
by 10 of you'd be talking about something.
I just, well, I saw this channel.
10 is here and I immediately thought of news, right?
And I thought of Anne, who almost hit me
with a diesel truck on Saturday coming to work.
And she did, boy, she was barreling by me like Dennis Weaver.
Remember in that movie, Duel?
Duel.
Or he was trying to get away from the lunatic
and the truck.
Anne had that mean look on her face.
I'm going to get you.
You maniac.
Well, fix you.
All right.
And once the last time you ever saw a truck driver
wearing a cardigan sweater,
it was the craziest thing I've seen.
You're right.
It isn't news time.
See, I'm getting so wound up now.
I'm like ready to wrap it up in about 10 minutes.
Well, then maybe a thought today.
You can't be, Dave, he was ready to wrap it up
about two and a half hours ago.
Just wait till he finds out tomorrow.
We're going to start letting him talking a little bit.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
I don't know if he knows that or not.
No, well, he's not in the right union to do that.
Sure.
Listen, we got all these, it'll sound like we got a lot of people in here.
Yeah.
As we as from the first day, we had the smile on his face.
Yeah.
I'll be talking.
I was him.
I'd be listening to that AM.
You know what I'm saying?
We're not really eating in here, Gary.
I was listening to the news this morning.
It's a laugh a minute.
I'm telling you, it's fantastic.
Go ahead, sir.
You're not going to, you're not going to work Saturdays anymore.
No chance.
No way.
Never again.
Because like all the bizarre collars
call in on Saturday.
Have you been listening this morning?
Yeah.
Well, these are some of the leftovers.
Like now, see, they probably couldn't,
they were probably like the only time they could call
as like early in the morning before 10.
You know that lead, you let must be the S&M
because he gave me a straw.
Not only is it cracked in the end,
but you can't, it's like cracked all over the place.
You can't, you can't suck anything through.
You will collect, I tried to warn you.
Yeah.
Glad I was doing it.
Look at this.
See, just drink it.
See what you do.
You just drink it like that.
You drink it like that.
You drink it like that.
Incredible.
It's an asbestos box.
It's good too, by the way.
Boxo joint.
Go ahead, boxo joint.
Don't let them, don't let them,
intimidate you.
Go ahead, keep talking.
Reception in like bokeh is like better now
than you're on FM.
Yeah, you hear that?
The reception is better and it's not crackling
and puking and popping.
You're going to like take over FM now.
Absolutely.
They're going to forget.
Like grant to bridge your orientation.
You got it.
And particularly, that's your love.
Yeah.
In fact, we had a call a little earlier from sunny.
You want to hear.
I don't think you can hear it on a phone,
but the people on the air can hear it.
Oh.
Okay, just a joke, sunny.
Okay, relax.
Don't go out and get 10 cases of grandma boon yet.
It's not worth it, sunny.
Well, listen, it's been great hearing from you,
but the life marches on and the call us in the morning.
You know, like before you go to school,
because bokeh is about as dead as a door nail.
Yeah, well, I usually leave like 60,
like 45, so I'll expect a call from me.
All right, now how old are you?
15.
15. See for our demographics.
We've had a 16 year old girl.
These demos.
And a 15 year old guy in bokeh.
What we're going to do tomorrow morning is get him together.
And maybe you can skip school together tomorrow.
Yeah.
Is that sound good?
Yeah.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Bye, bye.
Boy, please call us in the graphics.
I can't believe you spent that much time talking to him.
He's sitting in bed wearing his Batman pajamas
and his asbestos shoes.
We get numbers on this show.
Okay, now you get into it.
You'll understand.
You'll learn.
Look at this guy sitting over here,
sucking up that kneesh.
And 906 of them are incredible.
Aren't they though?
Oh, yeah.
I thought there was no eating in here.
Isn't that the reason?
Yeah, like, you know, one of the Easter.
Yeah.
Standing there with his cup of coffee
and he's got his 82 raisin bagels in the office here.
I'm not eating in that.
The beautiful studio.
You know, yeah.
Tell us another.
Well, it's the first day.
You know, we have to do something.
Got our bananas here.
Who's in these from a hot 105?
Yeah, that was real nice bananas.
And we got our champagne thing from Marvin Bailey.
Marvin Bailey.
There's another one out front.
Another one.
Another basket.
There's a big basket out.
Another basket.
OK, listen, let's take a couple of these calls here
because so far, excellent.
Don't you want to talk about Channel 10
for a minute while they're here?
You're going to talk about the one and only?
Yeah.
Well, look at the truck is out there.
Look who's driving.
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
I recognize that sweater.
That green cardigan sweater.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
And give Diane Magdamm our best.
Yeah, tell her we love her here.
We know this hair place that is just,
OK, here's a little promo now
for our friends at Channel 10, the night at 5, 530 and 6.
Does that mean that Michela is going to introduce this?
Possibly.
Thank you very much.
OK, OK, you can't see.
Wow, a bunch of men.
Show them and watch it.
Well, he's speechless.
His lips were moving, but nothing was coming out.
He's speechless.
It was incredible.
Yeah, no, I don't think so.
OK.
7 past 9.
Is that what it is?
And it's like 7 past 9.
Because this one says 6 past 9, OK?
It is 7 past 9.
Yeah.
In fact, if we can keep the momentum in that,
before you know it, it'll be like 58 past 9.
I'm just moving in the head a minute.
That's right.
OK, let's take on what?
From Dave?
Look at his captain Dave in there.
He's with the boss.
He just like a pig in heaven, isn't it?
OK, that's Captain Dave, of course.
Broward, hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
This is Dick from Fort Lauderdale.
Hey, how you doing in Fort Lauderdale?
I think I'm going to get out of this.
I'm going to get out of this.
Yeah.
Actually, I have to thank that Chucklehead
at the other end of the dial for bringing you to light.
Who's that?
You know that Chucklehead, Joey.
Joey?
Joey?
Now, did you say you're a first-time listener?
I was in the old Rochester.
Actually, did you avoid AM because of the static?
You know, much receiver just don't pick it up too well.
All right, what did Joey say?
That, uh...
No, just every morning.
I mean, I'm telling you, he's doing more PR for you than anybody else.
But I like...
I know how to get him out of that room.
Oh, boy.
I want to ask a question.
He's gone.
In the immediate run of the executive, John, here he goes.
And AM comes in on his, uh, radio.
What's up, Dr. Fort Cassington, sir.
This morning.
Oh, it is...
It's so good that it's frightening, isn't it?
I like it, but I want to ask a question.
Doesn't it sound a lot like...
Maybe you might be a little bit infringement on the hell you jackson.
I mean, because it sounds much like off my hell you jackson.
That's what you're about to mind.
No, you know what I mean?
Just, you know, I am a from...
With all due respect, I think you'll be ill in this morning, sir.
No, no, no, I really like your chance.
But I'm telling you, the more you listen to it, just think about it.
Definitely have some dreams in a lot of good.
Pottery, maybe we ought to take a poll on that tomorrow.
That is an idea.
I like it, though.
So, uh, is why does he doesn't get in trouble and be good?
He did that once with the chiffons.
You remember that?
Oh, yeah, with the...
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
One fine day.
And he lost that city.
One fine day, Sir Greber.
In fact, we'll be playing that tomorrow, but it's too far.
Sweet talking guy.
Yeah, and Saturday in the park by Chicago.
Program director doesn't know any of this.
He's oblivious, yeah.
Good way to be.
And uh, Fleetwood Mac.
Oh, yeah.
We don't hardly play Fleetwood Mac here.
There was a Fleetwood Mac cut on our list, by the way.
We're not going to play it, but I assume that since it was on a list,
it's okay for an other day, right?
Yeah.
Am I right? Look at that.
Yes, he goes along with anything.
Sure.
But I'm most glad that you guys at least occurred
you enough not to hang up on people the way that chucklehead does.
He's a jerk.
I mean it, really?
He's busy telling everybody how successful he's been in all these big markets.
If he's so successful, what the hell is he doing here?
I used to be in New York now.
I'm in Davey, Florida, you know?
He wants big numbers.
Yeah, I'll give him a lot.
Big numbers.
Listen, you guys take it easy.
Okay, you too.
Okay, bye bye.
Adios.
How about that?
Very first time listener.
Boy, that's incredible.
Good call.
I'm sure there's many of those.
Good caller.
Yes sir.
Good question.
Great.
Good answer.
One of those morons comes up.
Give the dumbest answer in a history.
Good answer.
Good answer.
Yeah.
Well, it's America for you, ladies and gentlemen.
It's wonderful.
It's like it's like the football games.
You notice now that the interest is building in the SCAB games
and the TV ratings are going back up again.
I know.
Which basically goes to show you like one of these morons
I was talking about.
He says,
Well, it's pretty boring in America on Sunday without football.
Yeah, there's nothing else.
What kind of a commentary is that?
I know.
What happens like the rest of the year?
I know.
Play football.
Just because the SCAB football is so bad.
How bad is it?
It's so bad.
It's fun to watch.
I mean, these guys are genuinely.
Awful.
Yeah.
Do you think glad?
You don't watch it.
You don't know how bad it is.
I'm just saying.
You want me to find it?
We're already forgetting these guys' names.
It's like Roger, Peyton.
What do I know?
Yeah.
Like it's too bad.
I forgot who they are.
In two seconds, I can sum up how bad it is.
Okay.
Okay.
That doesn't.
Okay.
That says his all.
Yeah, really.
Yeah, it was like that call we got a few weeks ago from the guy who
when he found out I wasn't into sports.
He was just like so.
You're not into sports?
He was so amazed.
Like he had never met anyone in his entire life
who wasn't, you know, a game fanatic.
And he said to me, what do you do?
You know, what in the world do you do in your life?
I was Mr. Sports do sports again this hour?
Or do we?
No.
What?
Look at that.
What have we won?
What have we won?
Whatever we won.
Yeah, they don't care.
It's just as long as something's going on.
All right.
The phones keep flashing.
They be flashing all morning,
except that first thing in a vocal line,
which only cause when we get hostile.
Well, if you want to do sport.
You're right.
They relate only to hostility.
Run the whip again.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
That'll make them all.
Okay, Folka, take this.
There it goes.
It's light now.
We're watching the line.
Not enough yet.
Please, sir, man.
I have another.
There it comes.
See, it works every time.
Hello, every time.
Folka.
Oh, there they go.
That's all right.
That's okay.
Hey, sure.
Don't have to speak as long as you will.
Oh, no.
Can make the line light up.
Boy, they aren't really stiff up here.
I don't have to say anything.
It's not necessary.
You can breathe if you like it.
It doesn't matter.
Wait a minute.
We got another one.
Hello.
No more whip.
Okay.
No.
What?
What the hell is this?
But Neil can't find it.
I mean, this is exactly like.
Oh, we're talking.
Van O'White here.
Yeah.
Oh, Glen, Glen.
You were.
Wait a minute.
You're talking with this.
Wait a minute.
We've reached another.
Momentous point on this show.
This is our first request.
That's right.
Is it?
All right.
Yeah.
Okay.
Another one in there.
Right, dude.
Do you want to give me a little bit of music today?
Like you too.
Give him the whip.
Yeah.
Okay.
God.
Listen, have a wonderful life, sir.
Thank you.
And thanks so much.
A great, Colorado book.
Okay.
It's enough to make you sick.
And what do you mean there's no S&F?
All right.
I'm ready to pick, baby.
F-E-C-T-E-F-G-T-K-L-M-O-P-Q-I-T-U-S-Y-Z.
That's your cover, man.
All right.
I'll take the sofa, the blender, the microwave,
the refrigerator.
Hey, man.
What do you mean?
$500 for us.
Like, and white five in portable TV set.
You got ripped off, man.
My brother and uncle get it for your whole sale.
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man.
All right.
Hey, man, come on, baby.
Get my regards to Neil Rogers.
Tell him that I've never heard of smuddy or program in my life.
Okay, 916 on Zeta.
And, boy, we got something big coming up.
Now we're going to play the George Harrison record again.
Almost finished here for the day.
And the consensus is...
Hell of a job.
Hell of a job.
First program.
Yeah.
Well, concerted.
It was really good.
The audience was really excellent.
Yeah, look at that.
Even Bokeh is calling in now that they know it's too late.
And I think we have just enough time to listen to something very special.
We had a lot of requests for this, by the way.
And here it is.
This is one of my daddy's songs and obviously I changed the words a little bit.
That's okay.
And this is to you, buddy.
Hello.
We are just near.
And so I'll fix my final AM callers.
My friends.
All say I'm queer.
But I just wish I was a little callers.
I've made a life of full.
And now I'm going down the hallway.
All much more than this.
I'll do it my way.
Unbelievable, Elvis.
Yeah.
There were times.
There's more.
You knew when I've been old, my poem is over and I could choose.
Oh, my God.
Oh, through it all.
When the world was down, I saw Jimmy Space and spit it out.
I stole.
But I am still small.
I like it. Thank you very much.
Yeah.
There he goes. Elvis, Jr.
And one way or the other, I know we get him on a show today.
I see you're going to have to get into all these people.
Yeah.
I've heard Elvis, Jr. before.
And I at least care.
Chris, a lot of things.
That stuff is all new.
Yeah.
Jeff Striker.
I mean, riveting stuff.
Riveting.
You guys are killing me with this.
But you notice the AM quality.
The MSR is again Jeff Striker.
Just in case you missed him.
That's from the way stuff, right?
Yeah.
Well, we let you recognize him now.
Yeah, we keep them in a short time.
We heard the AM quality on that card.
All the popping.
That's what I like.
I know.
It sounds like it was out of the same genre.
As the Joey thing.
Well, listen, thanks a lot.
It's been something else.
Hasn't it all lines are flashing?
Even Balkan.
Now that we're getting ready to go.
Don's are in the other room.
Cooking up a wicked brew of hits.
And what can we say?
That we will see it tomorrow.
Well, listen, tomorrow we're going to know what we're doing.
And this was like a dry run, right?
Exactly.
Considering all things equal,
it's going to be great eating those conissures.
WCTA.
Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and the Palm Beaches.
Just give us your coordinates and we'll be in your board.
Say the four.
94.9.
