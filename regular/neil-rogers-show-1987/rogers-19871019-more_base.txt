Beautiful and wonderful and lovely and also underage you just want yourself.
Okay, 550, 9490 we do have a line open and brown.
Of course we never know if these people can get through or not because of this wonderful
phone system too right.
We don't want to bitch about that every day.
Most days but not every day.
I'm going to save that hate letter for a little bit later when more people are listening
because it's too good to pass up.
And we have some new little new little things today that Dennis Collins will get upset about
it.
Good morning, 10 to 4.
I'm David Cohen talking about Zeta Studios.
Remember when you wake up at night, terrible or depression, you have to take your radio
at 94.9, Zeta 4, 6 to 10 in the morning to listen to the show The New Rogers, the
best talk show in the world.
It has a good day and a good life.
It's always listening Zeta 4 and relax.
It's incredible.
Relax.
Remindable.
Relax.
Yeah, something like that.
I see there's a lot of carpeting still out there in the hall by the way that hasn't
been laid yet.
Have you noticed that?
That hasn't been what?
They may be back today.
The carpeting crew may be back today and of course you're hoping not.
I'm sure of that.
Okay, this caller and Dave was there for a long time.
Am I right?
Oh, look at that.
I keep looking around and it's like on the screen now.
What a what a show this is turning into.
Dave County.
Good morning.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes.
Welcome, my friend.
Keep those levels absurd.
Running world.
Yes.
Welcome to my world.
Glad you joined us.
Yeah.
Hey, Tiger.
Maybe we can cut up a couple of jacks.
On some of your dreams.
Bruce.
This is Bruce Williams.
Wouldn't you recognize him?
Who's that?
What's up, Bruce?
Well, it's real foggy up here and I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it to work
this morning.
So I have to listen to you all the way till 10 o'clock.
Great.
Is this it?
Is this our this is our call the morning?
You're right.
The dolphins and you're setting in again.
I told you.
Okay, listen, by Bruce, I'm going to start being nasty and cutting some of these people
out.
He was terrible.
I tried to warn you.
You didn't want to hear me.
You're right.
They're very depressed.
Look at that.
It's like only like last week we never had to give the number out, right?
But we've been through this before on the A&M.
And you're right.
And I'm absolutely wrong.
When the dolphins pull off a particularly depressing performance.
48 hours.
Those weren't the dolphins yesterday.
It doesn't matter.
They were imposterous.
They found that.
And I got news for you.
Having to listen to Marv Albert and Joe Namath.
I mean, Joe has set new lows in the history of illiteracy.
Okay.
And he just any word with the letter, Eleanor.
I wonder if they got him and Tom Brokaw together to do the game.
What would happen?
You know?
I mean, it is just pathetic.
Okay.
And that vocal line is also dormant.
I see the other people are starting to pick up a little bit.
Well, they're sleeping in a little late.
It's Monday.
I told you.
Speaking of Monday, by the way, we also have another thing in the mail.
Which you're going to be very excited about.
It's a recipe.
You know what it's for?
For.
Mung bean sprout salad.
Which we'll be reading a little bit later on.
In fact, Marina Polve is going to be here to lay that one on you.
Look at that.
What's happening with the phone this morning, Captain Dave?
They're just a little cranky?
Cranky.
Yeah.
He just shaken his head.
He doesn't know.
It's all over.
He said you had one week and you're finished.
You know, that's it.
It's not.
Just like on an AM, man.
I'm telling you.
At the beginning, they give you that little false sense of security.
And that's it.
They'll be this way for 48 hours.
They'll all be back by Wednesday.
I think they're uptight and unfriendly if you ask me.
And like, now I feel great.
You know, I feel like comfortable in here.
And even some of the stuff is working.
Not most of it, but, you know, little bits and pieces.
So you're pulling for the other team in the series.
Not the birds of what Minnesota or whatever the other team is.
Yeah, the Minnesota North Stars.
What do you know about sports?
You could tell them any name.
You know, how the North Star is going.
Yeah.
Yeah, the goal is a little sick, but the catcher is going to like up for it.
Is that the other team in the Minnesota?
Okay, let's take one or two of these call and, uh, Broward.
Hello.
Good morning.
Yes, sir.
I hope you're going to be our first good caller this morning.
Well, I hope so.
I just got back in today from a two week holiday.
And, uh, I don't know what's going on, really.
What do you mean by that?
Well, I just got back from Europe.
I left two weeks ago Friday.
Are you trying to impress us with that?
I mean, like, you know, you were in Europe and we were here?
Well, no, I could have said I was in Peoria, but I was gone for two weeks.
Yeah.
I turn on and, uh, here we are.
For me?
And here we are.
But, uh, what happened?
You went from AMFM.
I know you're talking about it.
And, uh, all of a sudden, it's happened.
Yes.
It's happened.
Here we are.
I mean, like magic.
Well, not like magic.
I'm not going to have to have AM now.
Now that you're gone.
Is it going to fall apart?
Oh, speaking of the AM, by the way, they're running a promo.
I'm glad you mentioned that because they're running the most ridiculous, disgusting promo
that says, and I'm paraphrasing, but it says, uh, join the crowd of FM listeners switching
to AM, tune it to 940WINC.
Well, of course, what she forget, the T-Lady forgets to say, is that that throng of FM
listeners were listening to my show.
Yeah.
And buzzing.
And our computer just went out, by the way, kept in the day, but it was nice for, uh, 15 minutes.
Ha, ha, ha.
Yeah, we're here, sir.
And, uh, you found us with no problem.
You were away for two weeks.
Now, how did you, uh, stumble on us?
Well, I called a friend yesterday to find out what was going on at work.
Yeah.
And, uh, the friend says, by the way, he holds on FM.
And I said, yeah, what time?
And why, if you said 6 AM, I said, Neil won't get up at 6 AM.
No, Neil gets up at 4 AM, sir.
4 AM.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Sorry to believe.
Uh, how can you get up sorely in the morning and get with it and fight?
It's very, very easy.
You set the alarm clock and get up, you get out of bed, you shave, you get dressed, you
do a couple other little goodies, you get in the car, and here you are.
Just like magic.
I keep saying that.
That's, we're not supposed to say magic anymore.
Look, can you kid the Apple some of the things that we're going on when I left?
Like what?
Uh, did you ever go for lasagna?
Uh, no, for real Parmesan, sir.
Would you get it right?
Oh, well.
No, Jamie and Marci are now on a work release program in Kendall, and when they get out,
we may get over to their house.
Okay.
Are you still in a 9-7-6 kick?
Well, the problem is when they get us some real phones in here, we may be able to dial
out.
Okay.
We can't die alive.
Well, I was one that stopped by to see Eddie McImboliose that night and dropped off the
picture.
The notorious picture that you're going to do the hour on the next day.
Of what?
Uh, Mr.
Someone at the copa, I think.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Well, we made that legendary.
We made 4,000 copies and passed it all over Dayton, Brown.
What a picture.
Yeah.
Are you mailing them out too?
Like you did.
Well, I'm not sure.
Well, you see, it's not all to do with you though.
No, see.
They just get surly.
They've always got an excuse, but that's the kind of town it is.
Yeah.
Uptight and unfriendly.
Welcome to South Florida, ladies and gentlemen.
Put your gun in your holster and have a wonderful day.
Okay.
Let's go to all the computer screen.
Is that?
Look at that.
What happened to it?
It just died?
Yeah.
It just died.
I thought it was a joke.
I thought maybe he shut it off for a second or something.
It's dead.
I want to tell you, the engineering staff in this radio station on the scale of zero.
Okay.
Let's go back to Dave County.
Hello.
Hey, look at that.
Even the phone works today.
Great.
That's a good start.
How are you?
Wonderful.
So what's happening here then?
We're going to, uh, what exactly is the deal with Iran then?
Are we?
Oh, come on.
Don't start with Iran.
Will you please?
We don't discuss.
This is FM.
We talk about happy things like Michael Jackson's face lift and stuff like that.
We don't talk about Iran.
I heard you mentioned it briefly.
And Ronald Ray Gunn.
We don't discuss those things.
We've got a bunch of mindless automaton auto-matons out there.
As somebody I know would say.
Yeah.
The news this morning will concern Don Johnson.
Yup.
Shooting pigeons.
Stand by me.
River Phoenix is 17th birthday coming up.
Stuff like that.
Yeah.
And if they blow up the world, what difference will it make anyway, right?
I've had a couple appointments this afternoon.
I'd like to make.
Well, and if you don't make them, what difference will it make?
Nobody will ever know.
Will all be the bombs of the bursting in air.
All right.
Well, it's good to hear you on FM.
You don't sound too enthusiastic this morning.
Sound a little tentative.
Like maybe this is...
Yeah, I'm very tentative.
This whole Iran thing's kind of got me on.
No, no, no, no.
Listen, we don't want you to get depressed.
A little later this hour, though, we are playing a Peter Paul and Mary in the very last day.
That's what we want.
That's what we want to hear.
Okay.
Have a wonderful day.
And listen, make the best of it, you know.
All right, man.
You know why?
Why not?
It could be the last one, right?
Okay.
For a wonderful day, and we want to motivate everybody in the audience, we don't want to create chaos
or panic.
But this probably is the last day.
And it's been nice knowing all of you, you know.
But nothing is permanent, right?
Look at the dinosaurs.
What happened to them?
Well, we enjoyed our week in one day on Zeta.
And if it has to come to an end, now we go out on a flourish of glory and excitement, enthusiasm,
all those.
Broward County, good morning.
All right.
Hey, how can you even feel nice last week?
Okay, where we going next?
I'll show you people a thing or two.
Okay, no more of that crap, okay?
We're going to start hanging up on everybody.
We'll get a lot more calls in that way.
That's right.
Okay, if there's any more runs from Piper High or Miramar High, we need to make up with them.
Remember, never say goodbye by Bon Jovi in the principal who's a real idiot over there.
Oh, yeah.
And they wanted to play it at the senior prom and you have censored the record and they couldn't play it.
And they had to play like Mary has a little lamb or something.
And I think they ended up playing stand by me or something like that.
Are you serious?
I know it was considered.
No, they considered it last night on HBO.
That's right.
Remember Phoenix turned nine.
You've been talking about the 15-minute promo.
I finally saw that at the very end of it where it fades out where they're starting to amolest each other.
That's my favorite part.
I can't believe that.
That was great.
You know, early.
As I look back at it, I think this is one of my favorite movies of the 80s.
I'm serious.
This movie affected me.
What is the word beyond obsessed?
There must be some word in the dictionary that makes obsessed pale into insignificance
because whatever it is, that's you.
You are way beyond obsessed with that movie.
Those dumb little kids.
It's like everybody growing up in the 50s.
We're all running around looking at dead bodies and jumping off railroad trestles and stuff like that.
That's what life was all about.
You did jump off the road trest.
Oh, sure.
I had leeches all over my body all the time.
It was a commonplace growing up in upstate New York like you know who.
By the way, probably part of the reason the lines may be a little jam this morning.
Joey is taking a contest.
They're having a big giveaway over there.
Who could pick the date when he's going to get canned?
No dates after January 1st, 88 by the way.
Just a little helpful hint to our listeners.
Interesting.
Okay.
Captain Avis put the board down there.
You know, the screen doesn't work and the hell with all this business.
We don't care.
We'll just punch him up at random.
Broward County. Good morning.
Morning.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm from South Planned Paces and you said last week that...
Isn't that where the kids were counter-fitting that money?
Yes.
Yeah.
I'm sorry to bring that up.
That was a sore point.
Well, I wasn't a counter-fitter.
Okay. Really? Yeah.
We're not all in one.
I've been listening to you so since you've been on the earth.
So, what are you doing here?
Wait a minute.
When did I ever say South Plantation Kids were more on this island?
I read it because the South kid did call.
Oh, I love South Plantation High.
Yeah.
It's my favorite.
I do.
Isn't that the one that's got like the soccer ball on the thing?
They were like the state champions, right?
Yeah.
We love them.
You want some South?
Huh?
You're eating with here during high school?
No.
No.
I lived in the frigid north.
Where?
In Rochester.
Oh, no.
I lived in Westchester.
In Westchester?
Westchester.
Westchester.
Westchester, what? Florida?
Oh, Westchester, New York.
Oh, in Long Island.
Now on the other side.
What do you mean on the other side?
The other side of the city.
Westchester County.
It was close to the Greenwich, Connecticut.
Oh, okay.
God.
Well, I don't know that much about, you know, other than Manhattan and the Bronx,
that's enough for me.
That's right.
Okay, well, I'm Queens.
I'm enjoying your sound.
And Fire Island.
Okay, have a wonderful day.
Now, wait a minute.
Let me ask you this.
Yeah.
Does anybody at your high school listen to this show?
I almost had station, but that would have been on the field.
I don't push it.
I honestly don't know.
I'm my friend, though, who I take up in the morning, but, you know,
that's not because of the situation.
No, but that's a good start.
That's a good start.
Well, ask around.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
See what you can find out and report back.
Oh, okay.
Okay, have a great day.
Bye-bye.
Great.
Captain Dave says he's getting a lot of hangups today.
A lot of little cranky types out there in this Monday.
You're right.
It does happen after the dolphins lose.
That's right.
This town just goes bananas.
You go into a restaurant.
That's what he wants.
Yeah, waiters will be snarly, you know, and you go through, like, say,
Windixie.
And the waiters are only snarly after the dolphins lose.
I thought that was like an everyday occurrence.
Well, more snarly.
And you go through, like, a checkout counter at Windixie and the checkout girl,
you know, will be just in a hospital.
Possible.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
For 48 hours.
We still haven't had a call from anybody from Piper High, 550, 90, 490.
You don't think we'll get one?
Yeah, we'll get one.
I think it's a good possibility.
It'll be a good friendly caller, or they'd be uptighted unfriendly.
Well, we'll have to see.
We're trying to mend our fences.
We're trying to be real friendly with it.
I'll under their radio stations back on the air over there.
K-P-X.
K-P-X.
Unlikely.
Big 88.
Unlikely.
And if it is, we'll take care of it.
Oh, look at that.
Another deadline there.
Boy, these callers this morning, great.
You guys on a scale of zero minus infinity, you know what I'm saying?
I mean, like you guys are pathetic this morning.
There they go.
Okay.
Now they're all flashing.
They want to be beaten and whipped, you know what I'm saying?
Oh, I know.
They want to be flage-related.
That's what this town is all about.
630 on Zeta 4.
The Neil Rogers show.
Oh, that was excellent.
Boy, you can cut a promo for us anytime.
Okay, here we go.
This is what they want.
All our striker likers in the Zeta audience.
Here you go.
The moment you've been waiting for.
Okay.
For anybody who's been listening to the station must be in a little SNM anyway, right?
Let's take our first call on the Bocala and they just called, but we're desperate.
Hello.
Good morning, this is Bocala.
Hey, Bocala, how you be?
Oh, I'd be good.
I'd be real good.
I was like the maker.
No, a con-entering last statement.
Those weren't the dolphins.
Those are guys dressed up like them.
Yeah.
Yeah, they weren't.
Well, that's a new fetish, now there.
But there's a whole bunch of guys dressing up like football players, you know?
Yeah, the fans keep getting away, though.
Yeah.
Oh, it's like they're making a comment.
I was trying to call for lessons last week.
But you may have mentioned about Dale Reven to Matt Nox.
Yeah, they're hitting me.
If they hit me, Matt Nox, the face gets worse as Dale Reven gets better.
Yeah, they're doing like skin grafts.
I think they're doing some medical regi-ship like Dory and Gray.
I think Michael Jackson is involved in that somehow.
Could be.
Well, enjoy the show with the fun and day.
Okay, have a wonderful day, sir.
I'm trying to bet.
Okay, because it could be the last one.
631 on Zeta 4, we don't want to create panic and chaos.
Why did Captain Dave just close the door and lock us in?
Is he trying to tell us something?
I think maybe.
Is this it?
Well, we had a pretty good time here for six days.
I agree.
They said don't go buy a house, don't do anything rash.
And I think they meant what they said.
Brown would count a good morning.
This is our piper called you watch.
Hello.
You?
Hi.
Morning.
Yeah, you don't sound like you're from piper.
No, not from piper.
You sound like the pied piper.
And I'm high.
Miami high.
Yes.
What?
1802?
61.
Okay.
Well, let's say 61.
The dolphins play like the dolphins, no matter who's wearing the suit.
Yeah.
They lost to the sea hawks who was the dolphin.
Yeah, that's true.
They have no pass rush and no secondary.
So it's still a dolphin.
You know, the same thing.
Absolutely the same thing.
My wife, Leroy, is dying to hear for realty.
Your wife, Leroy?
Yes.
CB.
CB has the lighter shade.
Her name be Leroy.
Yeah, she be ill in today, sir.
Is that what you try to tell us?
Yeah, she be behind it.
Oh, great.
In other words, you're, this is a request, right?
Is that all we're going to do on the show is have requests?
Yes.
We're going to have dumb requests.
Why should this show be different than the previous one?
Yeah, than a one on the AM.
Where all the FM listeners are tuning madly to wins.
You know, I mean, who the hell is that broad kidding?
You know, the tea lady.
Is that it, sir?
Did you just, did you expire?
No.
Well, I have never heard a call.
Just go so dead in all my life as you did.
I know it's early in the morning.
You can't keep up with this, right?
No.
Going too fast.
Okay, listen, have a great day.
And we'll see you tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be Monday for you, okay?
Okay.
Okay, that was good.
That time I remembered Gloria.
How are you doing, Gloria?
I'm G-L-O-R-A.
She came up to me in the brown morning yesterday in the patio.
And she said, I'm mad at you.
And I said, for what?
She said, you don't say good morning to me in the morning.
And I said, look at her like, who the hell are you?
Huh?
Vogue off, lady.
Now she was nice, Gloria.
And she watched the news.
That's the news.
We look out in the red one area.
And the hotel is very pretty.
But we live in the middle of the birthplace, Larry.
Yeah.
And the helicopter comes flying in about 230 yesterday afternoon.
Clarence.
15 minutes later, Jonathan Bloss, our layover of the plate.
Well, that's that Don Johnson story that we did earlier.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm the one that's, I'm the one that call the police.
I didn't know you had it on.
I just got up a little while ago.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I got up the I.M.C.
Because when we found out it was Don Johnson out there,
we figured we needed some power to get him out of here.
Yeah.
Stan would be out there in a minute.
That's right.
Did Stan come out?
No.
Oh, goodness.
I have to get the nice man's name that came out and interviewed us and everything else.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Bunky buyer, yeah.
No.
What was his birthday?
Bunky.
Bunky.
Smunky Bunky.
Newhall anyway.
Yeah.
I heard your voice on Debbie INZ this morning when I was driving to work.
Oh, you did.
Sure it is.
I was online.
I'm going to have to listen.
Yeah.
That was, it was just incredible.
Now my baby has a new thing.
It was incredibly late.
When she goes to bed last night.
Yeah.
It was mom and scared of Don Johnson.
We should get that on tape for Stan show.
The entire afternoon in the bathroom.
Really?
According to the bodyguard.
Hmm.
Now what does that tell you?
Probably listen to Stan show Santa miss.
It has that effect on a lot of us.
Oh, yeah.
I just want to come.
Say hello.
Okay.
Have a great day.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, good bye.
It's so much fun coming to you.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Sorry.
Bye.
I went right down the street, I was black and white,
five and four to work TV said.
You got ripped off, man.
My brother and uncle get it for your own sales.
Give me the money and I'll buy the TV set, man.
All right.
Hey, man, come on, baby.
I just wanted to let Glenn know that the fog has burnt away.
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah.
And the other thing is, what would you like in the morning
at 6.30?
Give me your order.
What do you mean, what would I like?
No, listen, we appreciate it, but we can't do with the food.
You know, we just got to stop.
I got to stop.
It's too.
Why not?
Because I can't.
I'm like diabetic and I weigh 800 pounds and we got to stop.
Down the hill, you're not that big.
I'm telling you, I got to stop doing this.
I mean, do I have to beg and play to your wonderful guy?
We appreciate it, but you're killing me.
You're not that big.
You see this man doesn't want to listen to reason.
So you understand?
So you ever hear of diabetes, you ever hear
like little little things like amputations and blindness
and little stuff like that, you know?
All right.
We'll make some special for you that way.
Yeah, right.
Like nothing.
We don't want any food in here in the morning.
OK.
I don't feel good when I eat in the morning.
OK.
Is that because Peter?
Is that OK?
No.
Bye, Peter.
We want to hear it.
Does want to hear it.
Now, there's a classic example.
I beg these people to stop for speeding up a meal.
And they won't do it now.
It's painful.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, wait, didn't you have line two up there?
Oh, hi, Captain Dave.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
OK, are you?
Well, why does it say two on the board?
It says two.
Hello.
Aren't you lucky?
You got out by accident.
I did.
Huh?
I've been trying to call for a while now.
Well, it's your lucky day.
It is.
Yeah.
Who is this, please?
Neil.
Neil.
Yes, does that mean anything to you?
Yes.
It does mean something to me.
Does it ring a bell?
Yes.
Good.
As a matter of fact, I am not very happy with the change
in the morning, so.
Well, that's tough.
I know it's tough.
Yeah.
Because I think you are very insulting.
Yeah.
Well, I think you're a douchebag.
How do you like that?
You get off on insulting other people.
Yeah.
So what are you listening for?
It's already 840 in the morning.
How come?
What time did you get up today?
I got up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
How come you're still listening, my douchebag, friend?
I have not the listening to the radio think 6 o'clock in the morning.
What time did you turn it on?
What time did you turn it on?
My hostile hysterical lunatic, friend?
Listen to me, young man.
Young man.
How old are you?
How old are you?
I am, I am, I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am.
I am 36 years old.
I am older than you are, so don't call me young man.
You old douchebag?
Yes.
I think you are very insulting.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah.
And I used to listen to data for it.
I keep trying again.
It again.
You keep trying it again.
Well, the practice club has gone.
It's history.
It's a revaderich.
Okay.
If you were filled out your diary, they'd still be on the air.
You sick old bag, you pathetic old douche.
She was nice when she gave diet to the phone.
Yeah, we put her on by accident.
It was an accident.
All right.
I didn't realize what kind.
A near fatality.
Hard County.
Hello.
What kind of you after the car, damn telephone?
Okay.
Hey, I was just listening to you talking to Mrs. Doucebag.
What kind of language is that?
I don't want to talk to you.
You're just disgusting, vulgar old man.
Now we're getting there.
Now we're getting the kind of calls we want.
The old meal.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're getting the old callers.
They don't put these old parts on the air.
Would you please?
Lost.
This is this is data.
This is FM.
We don't want you 90-year-old geriatric douchebag con here.
Get lost.
You know what I mean?
They're the ones.
Yeah, they were hostile to me.
And all of a sudden they get upset with me.
I get these horrible letters and death threats.
And you know, you miserable, no good scumbrain, mong head.
Boy.
And of course, part of that's probably true.
But who the hell are they to make judges about me, right?
Say hello.
Hello, hello, Neil.
Hello.
How are you?
I'm fine, darling.
How are you?
Wonderful.
Isn't it a great day, darling?
Wonderful.
The frog is left to tell Glam.
Yeah, he's full of fog.
Oh, I know.
I know.
By the way, the man.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
The White House story was old too.
Casper Wine Brain has been on TV giving all the details of what's going on.
And you're sitting here reading what you're probably going to do again in the 10 minutes,
reading this old stuff.
It's true.
He's still on television, but what is Glam know?
Nothing.
What on playing him?
Play in our newsroom here, man.
No wonder this station is like a, it's like a stepchild.
You know, we got all this equipment that doesn't work.
We can't get any of the news.
The phones are like a joke.
You know, we're going to shape this place up real quick, you know?
You're real, darling.
I know you will.
You can say it again, honey.
Listen, darling.
Whenever you play something, could you do something for me?
For all the blue spots in the audience.
That's because you maybe talk like Bobba.
I miss her voice a lot.
Barbara.
Wonder what happened.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
The peppermint, yeah.
Yeah.
She's around somewhere.
She'll need a couple of words.
Okay.
She'll be around somewhere.
Okay, darling.
Bye.
Okay.
Have a wonderful day.
Love to her.
That was my favorite call, the whole program right there.
Remember Phoenix, yeah.
Is this a class?
The first grade class one.
It's a Zeta studio.
Oh, my gosh.
Are they going to learn a lot?
What school are they from?
It's not a broadcasting school.
I don't know.
Found a school of broadcasting.
They don't want to say what school?
What school are you from?
School of faculty.
What?
What?
What?
What?
What are you talking about?
It's just, just radio.
Sacramento.
Sacramento.
It's a Catholic school.
Oh, okay.
Oh, the Archbishop sent these guys over here to a monitor show.
Okay.
These are little midget priests over here.
I'm not going to get the guard.
Yeah, one's smoking a joy, I noticed.
Unbelievable.
I have a great day.
Feel better.
And you probably back in school in a couple of weeks.
I give it about two more weeks.
Okay.
All right, bye.
Take it easy.
My kind of student point.
I mean, I don't want to encourage people to be like.
But too much of a good thing is too much.
Oh.
Is, is need register, see bird health show.
Yeah.
This is not a Canadian.
Is C4 in Monday?
Is C4 in Monday?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Sure.
I'm going to put that on the air.
That's our first sticky from Buckeye, I think.
That was neat.
Yeah.
If we can't understand it, pal, it's not going on the air.
I don't understand.
Like, no speaking English, no speaking on this show.
Now, this is better when you hang up on people.
We get more calls.
Yeah.
Like that, that bitch.
Oh.
That call from where was she from?
I don't know.
Those kids are out of there, aren't they?
Are they out of there?
Yeah.
I think there's still a couple hiding in the turn.
Well, like I said, that bitch they've called me for, okay?
She really was.
She was disgusting and made my whole day.
She just realized that her call was one of the most productive
of the entire show.
It added like kind of a little spark to the show today.
And if anybody needed it, Broward County, hello.
Oh, Neil, how can you say those nasty things?
Is this a lawyer?
This must be a bang boy from public.
This is a lawyer.
Yeah.
One is Diaz, what's Mark's do?
Is this Mr. Carroyo?
I'm Mr. Carroyo.
K-Pasta.
Mr. Raya is listening to us.
K-Pasta, what's that?
K-Pasta, what's that?
What's Mastu?
Born as Telfin in your case, I know.
Yeah, I don't know, Neil.
What the hell are you doing on FM?
I mean, it's really nice, but you know, my boss refused
to put it at their radio in the truck.
Well, tell your boss he's a cheap jerk.
That was good.
Yeah, I know.
I thought that'd not do it again.
You'd blame me out there?
Sure.
I'm sorry, it means that.
Are those kids still in there?
Look at Peter, his eyeballs are rolling like a pinball machine.
I am fully aware of that.
Just relax.
You know what, play money by pink Floyd if you don't watch it.
And now I heard that.
I'm coming to work this morning and we're playing some record about it.
Let me give you every inch of my lover.
So what is that all about?
You know what?
I know what record it is.
I just wanted to quote the lyrics again.
