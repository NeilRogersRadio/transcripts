I just want doing a survey right now. I'm trying to find out how many radio stations play themselves
on hold. Really? Yeah. Okay. Well, let's put you back on hold and you'll find out. It's
a 744. No, I have no idea who that was. Okay. That's like number one has more information on that
pirate station. Pirate station. Hello. Doesn't he know my voice by yet? Oh, wait a minute. Is that you?
Yeah, I know all about. I heard that. Now, wait a minute. What are you? You want to slow down a
little bit? What are you talking about? You heard what? Well, anyways, you know, Mr. Gray.
Now, don't start with the accent. Would you please? Oh, that's all right. Believe me,
the middle suffice. Anyways, okay. The pirate station. He has like a network of pirate stations
all over the FM band. Who would you slow down a little bit? Put the dog. Put the dog. He
is away and relax him and will you? Okay. Take a coil out or something. Yeah.
Now, the Steven Gray. Yeah, he works at EDR. Oh, geez. And you might remember he's a good friend with
Willie B. A good friend. Oh, that that that is a lot. I went to right that equals four right?
Well, in their case, yeah. Is that an age? They were on the air the other night and I don't know
how much power they're putting out, but you could pick them up even in the bow and in parts of
power. And he had this guy who claimed to have done things with you on the air. Really? Yes.
And it was it was interesting. And then believe it or not, Roby Young called in. Oh, boy,
this is all tied together now. Yeah, it is now. And really young called in. And just in case
anybody's listening, you know, a seed is of Lebanon is. Mm-hmm. It's the trend. If you want to,
you know, fix the trends, right? It's right on top of the roof. It is? Yeah. So if anybody from
seed is of Lebanon is listening, the the pirate station is their trend is on the road. Well,
if anybody at the FCC is listening, instead of wasting your time waiting for me to say something
that I'm not going to say, why don't you get the pirate station off the air you idiot?
Oh, it's three. There's even a talk one. There's one talk one coming up on 1600 down on the beach.
1600? Yeah, there's going to be a talk show on there. I don't know. I was asked for some tape,
but in the interesting thing is they're all going to show up in the book. That's the best part.
I heard they did. Yeah, they're going to beat KAT. I know that.
No, well, that's the story. And he was talking about you and they were doing all sorts of
strange stuff on the air. I'm surprised that the caller mentioned that. I have a feeling with the
setup, but I don't know if they want me to mention it to transverse on. Feet is of Lebanon.
I'm sure they did. I think you should plug that a few times because I don't interfere with some
other stations. I understand they have one on 917 and 919. Well, if we know who the person is,
why do we even have to waste any time worrying about where the transmitter is?
Well, the FCC, they've known this is going, this station has been on the air for a year.
Why aren't they doing something about it? Well, they're busy monitoring.
Yeah, they're too busy monitoring me. Yeah, waiting for that magical day that's never going to happen.
They they claim that they're still trying to catch the person that's been interfering with the
traffic control of towers. Yeah. But that's over and gone with. And I don't know what their problem is,
but that station has been on like a long time and they matter fact, they've been
phimalcassing other stations. Every day they've phimalcats like they have like a you know,
like you have a feature of things on the Donter Show. They like feature a certain radio station
every day at 9 o'clock. Oh, it's horrific. One day they play RIDN 98, other day they play Zaid.
I've heard a Y100 on there. And they play all that kind of good stuff.
Oh, look, uh, anybody's listening for the FTC. He's a Lebanon right on top of the building.
Okay, I'm supposed to be high security building too. Yeah, great. Well, it's obviously kept them out.
Obviously, well, look, have a nice life and uh, Glenn, I don't know why you have not called Barbie
up yet, but that's I'm sure you'll explain that like in the near future.
