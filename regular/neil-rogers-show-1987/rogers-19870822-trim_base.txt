no sense in beating around the bush because i'm going to get right to it today
because
a lot to say fact don't rush to the phone because i have a lot of things to say
and i want you to listen very closely and very carefully because uh... who
knows what evil irks you know the hearts
of uh... people from coast to coast
i listened to a half an hour when i left this building yesterday that just
turned my stomach inside out
turn my stomach inside out
and you know i got a pretty good sense of humor okay
i think i got a real good sense of humor
and i'm also not thin skin because when you work in this business and especially
in this market for almost a dozen years if you've got thin skin you're not
going to make it
and i take the heat from everywhere now i joke very often about the fact that when
it rains i get blamed for it and when uh... somebody gets fired here i get
anything that people get upset about i get blamed for
and now we have a new we have sunk to new lows
because now i have trashed my good friend i'm told you know each of the last
three days has gotten progressively worse
why because i've had the audacity i guess to play that little bit on
card i want you to hear the card by the way
can you hear that i bulker raced at this morning
so you heard that washing sound of the bi purposely didn't do a good job i
want to leave wishes on there okay is that picking up
you can't hear it well that's all that's on the card anyway just little
washing sounds we could let it go the rest of the show could be the new background
for the news
and you finally reach a point in life where you get tired of taking crap you
know what i'm saying you get tired of the abuse
and you get tired of everybody else thin skin childish people
taking out their anger and frustration on you
and i hear it on i've heard it consistently you know oh yeah we take a lot of
shots at people on this show no question about it
but we don't orchestrate an entire program to attack somebody
and here we had a show how many weeks ago wasn't four or five weeks ago
less than that
we're another one of the juvenile people in this market did four hours
four solid hours under the pretensive discussing talk radio of attacking me
including some of the most the wildest lies and hysteria and paranoia the name
what could imagine and i didn't dignify them then and i'm not going to do it
now with a response because it spoke for itself it was so obvious what it was
and then a couple of days ago low and behold here on the same radio station again
and w i o d we have another two hours with a board up orchestrating over
presiding over that performance of let's attack nila what he does on the ear
we can't beat him we can't compete with him so let's get him off the air
let's attack him
we get it from the Miami hero we get it from the Miami news my good dear friends
at the Miami news who know me so well that's the thing that amazes me about
all of these people who know me so well because they listen to a radio show
who wouldn't know me if i bumped into a men an elevator
like loose salomi never met the man Charlie Whitehead never met the man
and of course my dear friend Howard Kleinberg
and i was beginning to wonder last night i was thinking about all of this
isn't it interesting that Cox Broadcasting which owns w i o d also owns
Cox newspapers which owns the Miami news and i guess i would sound paranoid if
i were to suggest that all of a sudden these last couple of months the
Miami news has taken a sour turn on Neil Rogers
can't miss an opportunity to take some shots
and yesterday as i'm driving out of here i hear that we uh we i guess that's
the collective we that's so popular on this show lately
we have been trashing stan mager for four hours yesterday
and that came as quite a shock to me because i didn't know that we had been
doing that or that i had been doing
i thought we were having a little fun with that cart which i still think it's
funny you won't hear it again because as you heard i just erased it
and i wouldn't go through the work of putting it on cart again
i thought we were having a little fun with it because to me the hold on johnson
Miami vice thing is is a joke it's funny
evidently to stan it's not funny
and when you take the constant i mean even when you try to do something you think
is for the good of the community like the thing with mr valdez and getting
people to call their elected officials and maybe a handful of malcontents
call with bomb threats or death threats maybe i'm not so sure that any of
those calls really came in but assuming a handful a half a dozen of them did
of course nobody writes about the other 1995 calls or however many there were
the only thing they write about is the fact that this show is responsible for
verbal terrorism and it's the kneel ratings again who'll do anything for
ratings but has never done anything positive for the community
in the dozen years that he's been here
again keep in mind the people writing this are all these people who know me so
well
and i guess seven weeks ago yesterday when my roommate died i must have missed
all those sympathy cards that came from my good personal friends like charlie whitehead
and lucielomi and all of these other people steve cane who know me so well
i must have missed them maybe they got lost in all the mail we get is that possible i guess so
i missed your card steve because if these people all know me personally and know me so well
and know where i'm coming from and know that i'm such a big it and such a bad guy you would think
that they would know a whole lot about me which they don't
but somebody who ought to know a lot about me is stan mager because i've worked with him for 10
years he's one of my best friends always has been and if you've listened to my programs when stan
was here before when he was in filial field when he was in phoenix in fact i've had stan we had him
on a phone a few times to do some shows together about different topics from time to time just
like we've had gerry Williams on and of all the people i know in this business the one person i
have never trashed never taken the opportunity to take a shot at seriously is stan mager never
and i listen yesterday and i hear people who want to say something positive or who think the whole
thing is childish we're all cut off immediately but isn't it interesting how some of these old
parts some of the same old pathetic people like that guy in haelandale who sounds like sonny rozenberg's
brother with the poems or what with his song how many times have we heard that same call
Neil condition out but he can't take it and he's singing how many times have we heard that guy
now all of those people seem to be on for a substantial release for a couple of minutes
including the woman again about oh my husband and i how many times have we heard heard
my husband and i we were so fond of you when you were here before and we're so happy that you're
back but my husband warned me that roger's is using you he's using you as a whipping boy and look
out you'll be next he got ernie fired and taffy fired i got news for you folks i didn't get anybody
fired i have nothing to say about anything that goes on in this radio station i have nothing to say
about my own vacation as a matter of fact which i don't want to take i'm going on what they call
an enforced vacation next Friday if i'm still here by then
so i have nothing to say about this show much less about anybody else and yes i was delighted to see
taffy go just like i was delighted to see john brownward go but it wasn't my decision it was a
management decision and why did they go because they were terminally boring and because their
demographics were a hundred plus because they weren't broadcasters and neither one of them ever will be
and it finally gets to the point where you just want to throw up your arms and say hey listen
you know you can't please anybody
and i put my neck on the line to get stand made you're hired in this radio station i've fought
and screamed and yelled and carried on like a maniac because to me he's one of the finest tacos
to the country he's one of the few people who could do what he's doing in afternoon drive and
we joke about Miami vice and about don johnson and his obsession with her whatever we want to call it
to joke
and i thought we had a lot of fun here yesterday for four hours at least i thought we did
there were people coming in from around the building we're getting a chuck a lot of what we
were doing a lot of which had nothing to do in fact most of which had nothing to do with stand
and
and i listened to this yesterday when i left here and i just uh i got to tell you
you have to really wonder you know life is very short i learned that short time ago
that once you die it's a very permanent thing it's not temporary very permanent
and to waste your time fighting you know it reminds me of what Mike spindell is a good example
classic example i'll use him
mike spindell knows how much i like him okay
there's no way to dislike mike spindell it's not possible to dislike him he's like a little
curmudgeon there's no way to dislike him
and yeah he has his eccentricities like the rest of us with his wrestling and his meds and all
of these other little things and yeah i've joked about that
i've talked about different things he's done on his show
we've had some fun with that and i can't tell you how many times his skin has gotten very thin
and he's come back on very upset and wounded with me
so when the guy in hell and they'll wants to sing about people who can dish it out but can't take
it he's got the wrong guy because i take more abuse than all the others put together
in a week i take more abuse than all the others put together
and you know something doesn't usually doesn't bother me and elis bit up until yesterday
didn't bother me at all and sunny fox can come on and talk about my trying to change a three dollar
bill in windixi and this one can come on and do something else and steve can can come on and do
four hours of ripping and lying and shredding and attacking my everything under the sun for my
mother to you name it doesn't faze me because i know what the business is all about and i know
the nature of most of these people it's a radio show
and i know that most of these people don't really know me from adam and spider what they think
in a wrong mind they don't know me from woishi puppet okay
and just when you're having a good time and just when you're enjoying coming to work and just
when things are going well and you've got gigantic numbers and you're pulled off this incredible
miracle of bringing thousands not a few but thousands of people from fm back to a m there are
those people who can't stand prosperity they have to have a crisis they have to make a mount
nut of a molehill including the people at the corporate headquarters in this company so those of
you mouth can tense out there you don't have to worry because you're going to get your way
whether it's today or whether it's next friday or whether it's a week from sookas you're going to
get your way eventually because nea roger's won't be on w-i-n-z you can go to the bank on that
you can bet your life on it but a lot more than you did on heatwave in the a-thracent
corder yesterday with a much more definite result because there are those people who can't stand
prosperity they not only want you to accomplish certain things but they want you to do it their way
and the bottom line is in this market and in this uh situation here you can't please anybody
not possible 20 minutes after ten at w-i-n-z we'll come right back
24 after ten at w-i-n-z and it's not going to be fun and games today i'll tell you that
is if you can't tell it already and i'm sorry about that but i don't think i owe any apologies to
anybody at this point and i'm not going to offer anybody any apology today because um you know
it's it's not forthcoming if anybody owes me an apology that person knows who it is
because what i heard yesterday was downright embarrassing and to allow these people these ridiculous
little old farts calling it oh he got ernie fired too ernie sochins a good friend of mine
ernie had been a guest at my show for years for years and one day he took me to lunch
in north Miami Beach at corkies i don't never forget the day and he said i really would like a shot
i'd love to do a talk show and i got ernie sochin hired on this radio station and to the day when
ernie was let go here i was in the understanding that he was still going to be here i knew nothing
about it now of course those people who don't want to believe that aren't going to believe it
because as usual i'm responsible for everybody who gets fired even on other stations i'm responsible
for people getting fired somebody in the print media i forget who it was a couple of weeks ago
asked me if i was responsible for sandy paint and in my middle are getting fired an iod how do you
like that as if i have any control of what cocks broadcasting does and of course we know that
they're such a reputable company and they treat everybody so well including my best friend
Bill caller who they've screwed to the point where the man is like inside out and upside down
they give him such a screwing and lied through their teeth this wonderful reputable company
cocks broadcasting
but again i'm somehow responsible when somebody else gets fired
you know it's one thing to joke about it but it's another thing when people believe it it's
another thing when they're given the opportunity to come on the year on this radio station and say it
because somebody is wounded and i still have no idea about what to be very honest with him i still don't
understand it and anytime management has said to me while stan ought to be doing this or stan
ought to be doing that my immediate response has been stands doing a hell of a job and he's going to
do 50 times better than d'Affi McAllem ever dreamed of and he is already doing that it's already
showing in the short time that he's been here it already shows but as i said in this business there
are those who can't stand prosperity including the people who own this radio station can't stand
prosperity and i'm not going to apologize to anybody including anyone in portland main or any
of the other neanderthals for anything that i've played on the year or said on the year
so the FCC isn't going to take neorodgers off the year because neorodgers hasn't done anything
that's actionable okay not even close
but this company is ultimately going to cause neorodgers to be when i say off the year i'm talking
about this radio station because i'm not going to miss any meals okay i'm not going to be out of work
but you reach a point of no return in your life and you say you know my life has got to have
some kind of value to myself you got to have some kind of self respect and when you sit and you pull
off a major miracle on a station that's been the most geriatric oriented station on the AM dial for
years with a dying format and you breathe breathe life into it and bring living and breathing people
back to it and everybody talking about it and you don't even get a thank you from the people
who own and operate it and the best that they can do is say well we don't like this and we don't
like that and we got a phone call about this then it's not a very uplifting experience as i've
always said to you it's another one of those great radio morale boosters and boy do they know how
to boost your morale in this business see because ultimately the talent were like were like cattle
cattle
and were just used and manipulated and when they've turned the inside out they put you out to
pasture and they say the hell with it just like they did at Cox Broadcasting
in the most unceremonious of ways
and you see the the real problem is here that there are people enjoying this show see that's bad
we're having a good time that's they don't know how to deal with that they don't know how to cope with
that that's why you find so many people in this business who love to take like the former a person
I worked for who owned WNWS Woody Sudbrink he made all his money by taking stations FM stations
and putting in automation machines and putting on slush music music see then you don't have to
deal with personnel you don't have to deal with those pain in the ass talent people you just put
tapes on machines and they just automatically keep going all day long and that's what most
ownership people in this business can relate to because they can't relate to the fact that the
talent are living and breathing human beings with needs and feelings and who really exist and
breathe the air as opposed to just automaton's to be oh there's that word again mindless automaton's
like the audience and so you see in the long run the audience gets the shaft too because the people
who enjoy this show you're the ones are going to get screwed because I'll find another job I'll
find something somewhere and I'm sure probably make a lot more money than I'm making here
but you're the ones ultimately who are going to get screwed because you're enjoying what we're
doing or you wouldn't be listening or those who aren't enjoying those who are enjoying it in a
masochistic way are still getting a certain sense of enjoyment from it
but yesterday I reached the point at which I finally said to myself hey wait a minute slow down
let's put everything on hold I've lost control over my own destiny as a human being
and then this morning when I came in as if I needed any more impetus because I was already
going to do this show today is if I needed a little bit more fuel on the fire I find out they're
having a baby so to speak to use the expression up in Portland Maine because Jack Thompson who called
in here yesterday whose name isn't even really Jack Thompson called yesterday to complain to our
corporate headquarters and so therefore we can't play this and we can't play that and we can't
do this and we can't say that etc what we can do we don't know because our management isn't here
so we don't know what we can do but we know what we can't do which is just about everything that
we've been doing for eight months on this show so where does that leave us you see it's one
thing to be out on a limb and I'm used to it I've been out there on a limb for years but when
you're out on a limb all alone and you turn around and there's nobody even behind you on the
bottom of the tree then it creates a problem and when one of your best friends is saying oh gee
trashed me and all my contracts up in February and I wish I was back in Philadelphia because you
played Don Johnson on a tape then you got to say to yourself hey wait a minute so I'm losing
contact with reality or somebody's losing contact with reality here
and it gets old it really does and I think I've got a pretty strong reserve of
whatever it is that is required to take a lot of crap from a lot of people which is one of the
reasons I've issued out that I've learned that in this market that's a survival technique it's
just like with the colors the colors want to be civilized I tried to treat them civilized if they
want to be obnoxious fine I give it right back to them that's called survival
but even when you have a lot of that whatever that quality is you finally reach your point at
which you say hey wait I think I've used it all up it's exhausted and that's the point at which I
find myself this morning because everything that I do is bad I mean you know run down the list
you know I'm a bigot and I get everybody fired and I do all those dirty terrible things on the air
and everything I do is for ratings and there got to be some more oh yeah and I trash stand for
four hours yesterday because I played Don Johnson I mean how can you get to be much worse than that
you know I never killed anybody and I never did steal a freight train or even a caboose but
short of those things you can't get much worse than the erudgers you can't be a much nice to your
guy I mean after 12 years all of these terrible negative things that I've done these device
of things in a community and here poor George Valdez and his family are living in terror and fear
because after all I was responsible for instigating all of that verbal terrorism you know and you
can go right down the list of all these evil terrible things I mean if you listen to some people
I don't even like my mother I'm such a bad guy of course the fact that they take stories out of
context and they lie and they twist and they leave certain parts of it out that's okay that's okay
and primarily you know what was interesting to me yesterday as I listened in that half hour
the younger voices were people saying hey you know you shouldn't be mad at me you know forget
about it no big deal is joke the older voices again the chronic old hyalurys that segment of old
parts who keep this town from being anything who make it into an outdoor funeral parlor as always
those were the ones what because they love it they love to pick this one against that one
they're full of bitterness and hate their whole lives are just filled with bitterness and they
love to share it because as I've told you for years misery loves company and that's where those
people are coming from but you know when the day comes whatever day that is that those people
turn on their radios and they can't find me anywhere in the dial they're not going to know what to do
with themselves they're going to have to find something new and it won't be easy to focus that hatred
on like the old guy from Hallendale with this song who wouldn't miss the show of his life
dependent upon it and like the old lady who calls here air every day with my feet stink you know
the one she called yesterday I forget the line yesterday air every day oh she also called
in during that half hour two the fat bag was obnoxious today the fat bag which got on the air
about three or four times I noticed see that was okay that was good that wasn't the shot that was just a
joke and I think somebody I know ought to be ashamed of himself
because when I need instead of paranoia and instead of whatever it is I can't even describe it
I don't know what is going on in the man's mind what I would need a little support from somebody
because it comes at a time when this show is being attacked from everywhere including from the
people now who own the radio station and once the people who own the radio station decide that
what I'm doing on the air is unacceptable anymore then I can't be here anymore because I'm not going
to go back to interviewing nutritionist who tell you whether your BM sinks or whether it floats
and all that other crap that the other stations are putting on the air I'm not going to do that again
ever if I have to go out and live on the street I'll do it before I'll go back to doing that again
because it's pathetic and because I don't enjoy it
23 to 11 and winds will come right back
24 11 and W I N Z and it gets even better boys and girls during the break
we had a lady in here from the date county sheriff's department to serve me and the station with a
complaint from our good friend Dr. Heffernan and of course this turns out to be a complaint for an
emergency temporary and permanent restraining order from us mentioning the doctor's name or phone
number on the air where's that RF coming from all of a sudden you hear that is it back maybe it's
an omen well if you don't hear it the first time you can hear it the second time anyway so we now
have in our hands and it's kind of fascinating to me because it says in the last paragraph where
for the plaintiffs pray for an immediate temporary and permanent injunction restive already got
the temporary one restraining W I N Z and Neil Rogers from mentioning or broadcasting over the
year the names or phone numbers of the plaintiff and grant the plaintiff any other relief team judge
what's interesting you know the temporary injunction they got had to do with giving the phone
number out because it is a physician's office and we don't want to jeopardize the health of any of
the patients create a problem for them not getting through and we've already long since stopped
giving that number on the air but in terms of the name you see dr. heffernin wants to play the game
but only on his rules see he's become a public figure when he formed his so-called committee
for first amendment rights or whatever he calls it he became a public figure at that moment
when he went on air on w n w s before he hung up on jeff Charles he also
embellished that standing as a public figure when his son was on two days ago on w i o d replacing
sick daddy uh he also became a public figure so the idea that we aren't going to mention dr. heffernin's
name on the air is ludicrous because he's the ringleader of the people who are doing their damn
this to try to get this show off the air and as i said in the first part of the art probably
will succeed not because of their own efforts but because of the company's response
if that makes any sense to you
so this really doesn't amount to much of anything just more of the saying that we've seen before
and again you know the bottom line is that it's strictly censorship and they can deny it all they
want but the bottom line is that dr. heffernin wants the first amendment to be whatever he interprets
it to be in other words we have the right to say whatever we want so long as he doesn't find
an offensive or jack Thompson whoever he is doesn't find an offensive or you know a handful of
other misfits in the market and isn't it ironic that we were running all of that um
effort and energy on the so far campaign save our first amendment rights in regard to the FCC
and they were we were kind of the focal point of that whole business
in focusing attention on the first amendment and the right of speech
and therefore we've become the immediate target
you see because these people can't turn off something that they don't like or that they find
offensive they have to get it off the air and that's been typical with the people on a religious
right for years this is nothing new this has been going on now for 15 years at least
in fact with the Catholic Church it's been going on a lot longer than that because way back in the
40s they were the ones who instituted the rating system for motion pictures
because naturally these people have to set themselves up as sensors for the entire country not
just the community but the entire country telling us what's naughty and what's nice what we can
read what we can listen to what we can watch what we can think etc
and as i said you know if you're out there like the pied piper i've told you that story many many times
where you feel like you're the pied piper you know playing the flute walking down the street
and you know the all the people marching behind you and you finally get to a certain point
you turn around you see there's nobody there you're all alone
and i'm always fascinated by the fact that when push comes to shove your colleagues generally
are just like the people behind the pied piper they're invisible oh don't get me in the middle of this
I don't want to get involved that's the kind of response
because most people are scared for their job well i'm not scared for my job because i'll be honest with you
like i said earlier in the hour from not here tomorrow i'll be working on monday somewhere
doesn't faze me in the least there are a lot of people in fact they're not going to my door all the time
i've been being bugged all week long with phone calls from people who just love to have me go to work for
all over the country because there are a lot of people out there who'd love to have a nine share
of the audience in midday with most of the people living and breathing under the age of 100
they'd find that pretty exciting you know i've said many times before that this show
peels into wind significance in terms of i'm not talking about quality i'm talking about content
in terms of the content level of coming close to the borderline with the Howard Stern show in
New York and it's interesting to me that Howard Stern show on wx arcade in new york is sold out for
the next year and a half they have a waiting list of a year and a half on that program
no don't don't tell them not to send any food here please i'm going to get to that in a minute
okay tell them thank you but no food
that's another thing lately i come in this morning and tweety bird says to me oh there's a pizza coming
i said what is this gonna stop already you see that's the bottom line these people who love
you to death and how many times have i said that in the air and i'll confess there was one day that i
got very upset with staying major but instead of going on the air the next day and carrying on about
it i called i left a very poignant message as Kyle will recall who relayed the message
because diabetes isn't funny it's a life-threatening disease and people lose their vision and their
limbs and their lives from it and i've tried without going into a big song at a dance because i
don't come on the air usually and get into my personal health problem well you know the rash i guess
we could use that as an exception because i mentioned it and we sat here in the phones running
off the hook for two hours about my rash but short of that i don't come in here and cry on
the public's shoulder about personal problems and i have begged people don't send food into this
studio and now every day not once in a while every day we have food coming in for the eating machine
so that when they preside over my funeral they can all say boy he could sure eat a great meal couldn't
they like in the movie fatso boy he sure loved his corn you know whatever it is sure loved his pasta
and so yeah i did take exception with that and i was angry for about an hour i guess about that
would stand major because as i said yesterday i don't hold grudges children hold grudges it's a
childish thing to do and if somebody is really your friend you don't hold a grudge over something minor
and especially where there was no malice intended to begin with
so i'm still confounded can a few dumbfounded be wildered and dismayed over what i heard yesterday
but i'm not going to apologize because i don't think that there's anything that i did that
requires an apology there was no shot intended there was no shot given
and if don't johnson and my army vice are indeed that important then uh what can i say
i thought it was funny and evidently most of the people in the audience thought it was funny
but they're just reaches a point in your life when you can't please anybody
when nobody is pleased with what you do except the audience but you see the audience doesn't count
which is something i've just learned recently see i always used to think that it was the audience
that counted i wasn't told to do the show for the owner of the radio station for the general manager
for the program director for the janitor for my friends i always was told that when you came
on a radio and you did a show it was for the audience and to get the largest possible audience
and to entertain them or amuse them or inform them or whatever the hell i was you were doing that's
what i always thought in it after 27 years in the business finally i discover the audience doesn't count
no we're supposed to please dr heffernin and we're supposed to please bob jumbertson in portland
main at guygan at broadcasting and we're supposed to please god only knows who else i don't know who
but certainly not the audience because you folks don't count we're supposed to please howard
Kleinberg at the mimey news and lucielomi and charlie whitehead and john de grute and mark
fischer and all these other mavens there the folks were supposed to please and not you people because
we know you're a bunch of verbal terrorists you're just bad folks with dirty minds and i love that
line that also went uncontested yesterday on this radio station between two oh six and two thirty
five about all how he came on the air no it wasn't i take that back i'm sorry it was one of the ones
it was the day before on w i o d from our good friend davan other one of the chronic regular
callers and i noticed a lot of the chronic reggares were involved in that exercise yesterday
i even heard our friend mike you know who called in yesterday
hey long since banished from the air on virtually every talk show and tell
but when you get a chance to jump on and make your attack boy they're all right there aren't they
they're all right there
now i forgot the line forgot the line i was talking about that they heard the previous day it'll
come back because it was such a good one such a classic
i mean when you're responsible for so much evil and so many bad things it's not easy to keep
track of mall i should have written them down i don't make notes but i should have written them all
out so at least i forget any of my sins and any of my evils this is better than being Catholic i
mean anybody can go and confess to one priest with a silly frocco but when you can confess to 80
thousand people out there listening then you've really cleansed your soul then you've
at least got purgatory made and maybe heaven you know who knows
nine minutes before eleven at w-i-n-z we'll come right back
well let's not get carried away it just came back to me about the old fart on bill mquie show a
couple of days ago in iod with dr. hoffenmouth and now we're not going to give his real name we'll
just call him dr. hoffenmouth okay forget the injunction no problem anyway
this guy's going on about well uh you know he went on in the daytime and they wanted all the young
people so you know all those young morons all he want to talk about his sex and cars you know so uh
you see here we go again it's always got to be the attack on anybody end of the age of a hundred
because the old farts they own south florida see that's going all the way back to the
halendale business that was the first business of this content when we had people taking up
petitions in front of albarsons and in front of publics to get them off the ad because we
don't like what he's saying see that was the beginning of all of it and of course uh once you
offend the condo commandos boy you got some serious tourists in this town you got real problems
and then when you offend dr. hoffenmouth you got a real bad problem
so the one thing that's consistent about this show we don't we don't single anybody out we
offend everybody even the people at work here are offended
i wasn't that fascinating how come he's upstairs today you notice that that's a first in weeks isn't
it i don't want to mention uh certain animal who's not in the studio here lending moral support
because he doesn't want to get in the middle of all of this he's upstairs in the control room with Kyle
just soaking it all up just being very cautious not to dip his wing in anything poisonous you
understand what i'm saying but that's okay we can survive we'll get through it one way or the other
see the irony of the whole thing is what's ultimately going to happen is i'm going to wind up being
gone because i was too successful too successful see i did too well if i would have just gone ahead
and we would have kept you know booking all of those boring guests and doing the same stuff i've
been doing for 10 years or 10 and a half years whatever it was but no problem we could have done
a nice four and five share and had all the 90 year old demographics and had all the funeral
parlors on the air and just been like it was before and there would have been no problem although
it is kind of interesting that you know when the Catholic church first tried to get me off the
air was for criticizing the pope they didn't like what i was saying about that uh they didn't like
the fact that i was homosexual they didn't like the fact that i was too liberal they didn't like
what i said about uh you name it about the marriott boat lift so you see it really doesn't make any
difference but when you speak your mind it's got nothing to do with vulgarity or with language the
problem is when you really say what's on your mind and you really speak out then you got problems
so all of this crap about first amendment rights and about freedom of speech is just that it's just
crap nobody who really says what's on their mind in this country sticks around very law
because you've got to say what the establishment wants you to say
and that's basically the bottom line
so
great to be alive isn't it so anyway that's the end of our number one boy just flew by like crazy
what i thought i just sat down here an hour ago and i don't know where anything goes from here
because as far as stan is concerned hopefully he'll be over it yeah i thought yesterday i really
did i thought he'd come in about one thirty we laugh about it and everything would be back to
abnormal but no no way Jose
i haven't got a negative feeling in my body about stan major or mike spindell or ernie sochen
but i'm responsible for all of those people's discontent
i guess even people i don't know who lose a job or who are unhappy or dissent even people i don't
know it's my fault so i hit it on the head yesterday and i think you know i was joking what i
said it but i think he can go to the bank on it if there's anything that you're unhappy about
you can blame me for it because i'm probably responsible
6249400 and date 5249400 and brown or al warnell is here with the headlines world news from
cds at 11 o'clock and we'll come back perhaps at 1106
4th lotterdale hello hi no hi i heard a news report last week about the pro-life people wanting to
keep the abortion clinics closed on the post-surrival for two days and they're threatening to
form a human chain to keep the people from going in the the clinics yeah now i think anyone
who has any sense of democracy freedom and and all the rest that goes with it well that leaves all
of those people out i don't know i i just find that it feels that all the right wingers are they
seem to be the most outspoken and then the most people who are doing all the picketing and all the
the loud mouth in it yeah they're going to make the decisions for all the rest of us and if they
think abortion is wrong even though you know the law says that it's okay and even though all
of those clinics have are licensed by the state and are you know operating legally don't confuse
them with the fact or with democracy or with anything else they're going to impose their wishes
if they decide that the show is offensive if they decide that a station in Jacksonville's offensive
if they decide that a magazine is offensive and shouldn't be a they're going to make the decisions
for all the rest of us and it you have to be a fool not to see how undemocratic and how
how dangerous that is is very dangerous and and for those out there who have any sense
i'm going to be one of the people who who will try to make an attempt to go in one of these clinics
and i'm sorry for the person who tries to stop me from going in yeah well all those people i
got news for them who are going to try to stop people from going in are going to put themselves
in a position of being arrested they're going to put themselves in a position of getting their
arms chopped off yeah yeah because they're going to be what they're going to be doing is going to
be strictly illegal exactly that's all i want to say okay thank you you know it's one thing to
march outside and to pick it with your stupid little signs and to carry on like a bunch of intolerant
children but if you're going to try to stop people from going into a duly licensed place of business
then you're going to be committing illegal acts and i have a feeling they're going to be a lot of
people being arrested that day and isn't it going to be ironic that a lot of this money that's
going to be spent by us taxpayers is going to help to go to arrest some of those people my any
beat chill out the nil yes how are you okay but you're talking about the candidates you left out
i never said i never said anything about the kennedy i never said anything about the kennedy
but i'm saying to you what he's talking about kennedy not the i i also want to bring up wait a
minute wait a minute what what did this man just say did you listen to these first 20 seconds
you said to me you're talking about the Kennedys and i said i bought back about a
i said wait a minute and i said i haven't mentioned the name of any of the Kennedys and you said no
i didn't say that but you mentioned the Kennedys before no i didn't mention the Kennedys sir i never
mentioned their name i don't know i must be gone by the dog i don't know that you must be losing your
mind sir i never mentioned the Kennedys on this program yeah well you know that about Catholics
all these so what about them what so what does that have to do with it they are the ones who are
standing in the way of people having abortions or trying to dictate how people should live their
lives yeah how could they do a thing like that one day they they themselves are a lot with that
wonderful finger uh oh pal take an inema would you please that's that chronic regular on my
me beach you know go go call up rage Charles or somebody pal get a lot we don't we don't do your
kind of show anymore okay with your senile babbling on the airy see that's the kind of stuff that
we're supposed to do according to this guy at saint lizard with church we're just supposed to sit
here and let some guy like that put everybody in a coma you talk about the Kennedys you were talking
about when sir when what day what year what month see this is another one of these old parts who's
got his own agenda and he's gonna bring up you know he's gonna inject anything in there that he
wants even though we're not talking about that because that's how many of our very aeryidite educated
seniors in soft lorita behave don't confuse us with what's going on everything is for us and for
our convenience including your show well i got a surprise for you pal no more my emmy hello you get
