any inside information but uh... all the information i get is that
that mike uh... has
is turned so firmly implanted that uh...
that they love him over there so some reason trouble that uh... you know that
that the bob richen and mike and he leave the shoes outside their office on
his breaks uh...
you know mike milicom's out and shines him up good and yeah
anything else master and then runs back in indesence programs
suppose that the guy doesn't belong on the air i mean i mean you you could
know what they mean when they say mike Miller speaks with fork yeah i mean
over the years you know that i've been here before and i said well he isn't
that bad i was known for tall he's an embarrassing as there isn't
embarrassing he's an amiss every tiny
he's like amateur i'll be sure i'll be sure i'll be sure
and you know this whole thing with the water you think they're not going to
new york tomorrow because they haven't got them you know they got they've
probably got the secretaries over the assigning petitions like crazy so they have
at least a respectable number
he he had six weeks to ask people who could be opposed to bringing the
super ball to my any any can't even get that done really
so uh... i would say he'd be the one to go but now uh... if they put came to the
six that certainly would seem not right they've got sanding out and to two
wait a minute but let me ask you this question do you really believe that a
guy who is making a lot of money
and who is got a pretty firm position in the afternoon because he's got
really has had no competition do you think that he's going to leave one
station and go to another for any amount forget the amount without ahead of
having some agreement what time he's going to be on the air you really
i do i think because of the kind of you know the kind of money he's paying them
they do just about any you know he would he doesn't know i mean he's fairly
honest with me i said you see this never lied to me unlike phala and he told me
honestly doesn't know he told me what he wants he says he wants to do two to six
and he said that you know that that he's heard talk that they'd like them to do ten
to two and and i would both agree that that would be a mistake because you just
don't fight you know your best cannon against your best cannon that doesn't
make sense by the way in the next hour following cbs news at eleven i want all
you people even you radio people who are listening this morning to call
everyone you know because we have another major
coup and you're going to be here to cover it exclusively for the minibus
what is that we have the debut of key west vice which is the
sequel to hellendale vice i thought it's him with with Steve called us with
that violators on air i think so what it yeah because i think he would call if
it didn't i don't know well steve if you want to call out to jeopardize that
kind of call in but if steve does want to call we certainly we would put him
right on the air wouldn't we oh yeah if stand up we know that steve is
listening there's no question you can go to belicor bet your life oh he told
he told me to be listening well steve is a big fan of mine he won't admit it
and i do i thought he was listening for me i do forget that i do recall when i
first went on in the daytime he said in the beginning you thought it would be
real close neck and neck and that alan i would you know battle for the
audience then he later on retracted that said that i couldn't cut it in the
daytime you know that all i had was those old condo commandos i wonder if he's
going to change his tune on that wait a minute if i can go on iod if he's employed
by nws y kuniko that's right excellent point i think the precedent was said
yesterday steve so if you want to call in we would certainly put you on the
air immediately for you to give us the load on in fact what other station in the
market would promote yes i mean means going to be on another station you might
even be a competitor in this time slot but we have thick skin here we're not
you know thin skinned wimps we're just thick skinned wimps here at wion z okay so we have that big
exclusive coming up thanks to mark moseley i can't believe it marks going to be doing a lot of
stuff for us in days to come after yesterday boy did he have a heated go round with marlin
baili yesterday was incredible even f lee baili was involved in that thing and the jerry baili
was writing in the jd baili yeah yeah is he okay by the way is he recovering yeah he
want to raise just this so i'm oh he came back because he was injured he's lucky one
or a good well we're going to talk horse racing later took us the derby's coming up and
times going to give us the winner and hockey last night what a depressing night i mean with
last year in one year in a hockey game and i think he came more to press that that's my
second that's good but mike wolf wants the new they are and then the world news from cbs
at eleven we can keep going and then we'll come back with tom jico with kewest vice with barn
joe v and uh all of that other good stuff and some departed talk show host at eleven oh six
go ahead put a little excitement in your life listen to neo rogers midday's tender two only on
wion z my army them out at each other but ladies and gentlemen we go to the ends of the earth to
bring you the top radio talk show talent i can't believe that we have a celebrity online three
steve how you doing neo hey steve how you doing it's great talking to your tom how's it going great
long time huh it look really i can't believe this man i'm off the air for a month and he's stolen all
my sponsors we need to with links to carriage hell yeah you well listen between now in the middle
of july baby you better watch it you'll know that's not there how the recreation center of the
full-time social direct captain crab may take you away by the middle of july so how you do what
you're doing with all this free time it is so fantastic in fact to tell you the truth i'm kind
of sorry i only had a three month no computer what i'd like to have at a six month it has taken me
the first month just unwinding relax i'm so milled out nobody even knows me they say you can't be
steve but uh got rid of all the tension i spent some time i know you love this neo love at the
de cipto school oh my god and days up they're getting my head shrunk great and uh i saw you on cn
any of that look like a little tiny head on this big body was incredible i haven't seen it yet i
leaf alley gave me a tape and i haven't had a chance to play it although i don't think we can say
head on the year anymore can we oh really no listen i wanted i wanted before we started i want to
set the record straight on a couple of things please i'm set number one uh in in terms of my leaving
w n w f uh i was not unhappy at w n w s at all i in fact i really enjoyed working over there uh the
problems were financial between us and uh that was basically the reason i left the other thing which
nobody can believe especially my wife is that i get along really well with leaf alley i know i'm
the only person in the world but uh leon i are friends i love it when it sounds like sand to get
along with them pretty well i have a different that very well could be yeah in fact if i were your
wife i'd be getting real nervous because you and leon sandy now that could be a real interesting
trifecta there well she uh she thinks he's a vicious sadistic s o b and we're lorraine i get more
very perceptive on his wife is the right on target or why i likely fall a bit smart i do and in fact
i can't leave among i'm as friendly with leon as it's possibly possible to be with leon because he
doesn't let anybody too close but i think he's a i loved working for him i always got a line that
we never had any problems and the other thing is uh with all these terrible things you keep saying
about my cantony i've spent some time with him and he's a real gentleman a very nice guy and
a world that's a terrible rap comes from well i only speak from what i know it's gone on at that
station in the brutal way he's treated a lot of the people there it's a brutal business you know
tell you know that well yeah but it can be some humanity and if people uh get the views that i love it
what is this
hahaha
this is a love fest ladies and gentlemen this is the right idea i gotta tell you it's it's fun being
here i've been listening to the show every day i'm a i'm a i used to tell people on the
arm of talkaholic and when i'm not on i'm always listening and i love the direction you've taken
the show it's really fun and exciting and entertainment philosophy of course is one that i
uh always believed in and uh think it's doing great and i congratulate you on your numbers
thank you well what do you think of the fcc thing uh to tell you that you that initially when it
came out it was very very offended by it and very upset by it and i've spoken out in fact on a
couple television i'm so desperate to uh get rid of my creative juices i've had to resort to
television creative juayde man can you say creative juice out on this show no you guys have dirty
minds i can't believe that that's the fcc uh well but anyway i the more i see uh of the way
everything depends upon how station management across the country is going to deal with this thing
the ruling in itself is sort of innocuous it's just a question of where they're going to go with it
in other words that they decide to clamp down and don't you think it'll have the chilling effect
that the fcc wants it to have evidently it hasn't so far from what i'm hearing i was listening to
out this morning and he was reading something from the uh the broadcast publication saying that man
let's face it when a talk show is or or a you know a music show is very very successful you're talking
about hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars and uh arms was in fact nioh could tell you
about this i mean when you get uh you know when you get good numbers and you're very very strong
management i know management doesn't love nioh but uh how can you say that still because i know
you're not lovable when it comes to working with management but the fact is you're making them a
lot of money and they're not going to mess with you dick caster loves me i would have said something
else how would you like to work for a guy like lu crone right now i love lu crone lu crone
one of the greatest guys i have ever worked the only man ever throw me out of a studio you're
kidding really oh yeah right on the air he threw me out i didn't know that what did you see must have
said something horrible i can't believe that steve is on here canonizing all of the radio douchebag
i can't believe this is incredible steve it was the day that nioh had the seeds and i was sitting
there just as an observer yeah that was growing came in he says i'm gonna have to ask you to leave now
when i says i'm here he pointed there with my heart's mountain bird seed and lu was convinced
that it was pot seeds and was having a nervous breakdown that i was going to lose the license
i was right before i got here yeah but i i did one of these differences between deal and i's i
i am sort of a management kind of person i've been i started this business as a producer so i
understand a lot of management's problems and i've always i mean their exceptions i didn't get
along particularly well with neo rock off but steve you're gonna get along real well with mike nela the
way you're talking well my husband but i mean i don't want to get you know kill him
i heard from the people in iod that steve was sharpening up his tongue for coming back on here but
i didn't think they meant for this come on steve no he listen just because i'm an easy going guy
doesn't mean that i'm easy going guy well i will say this i must confess that when steve first came
to the market and i'm not really sure at what point it changed but steve was like a maniac i mean
he was just like compulsive and hyper he almost is hyper asal and then all of a sudden something
happened and i don't know whether it was uh the marriage or whether it was a leaf out or something
happened i heard you just became like mr mellow mr establishment it's just incredible i wouldn't
i wouldn't go that far almost i did go well i did go the the marriage did change me a lot of it was
very frustrated and angry and i just come off as very bad relationship when i got down here and i
when i'm angry and frustrated i do have a tendency to take it out on my show you know but i uh
no i have meled somewhat but i mean i still know what it is to get nasty i think well what does that
mean is that mean when you come back on here we can expect which okay which steve can we expect
well i can tell you this the date county steve or the broward county steve i can tell you this i
can't i'm not going to be like i was in you know when i first got here because i'm not that person
anymore yeah but i can give you a little insight there's been a lot of speculation about whether
you know w-i-o-d was going to tone me down and because they have had let's face it a very conservative
image boring yeah planned well i'm trying to terminal diplomatically but uh in my discussions with
mike he is very anxious for me to uh you know he said you know whatever you want to do you just go
for it and they're not going to inhibit me and they want me to be as you know as outrageous as i
feel comfortable with being so there's going to be no censorship and no toning me down and i'm
kind of looking for that the other thing that i love me when i think you're about this too is you
know there was a ever since you moved into mornings against now yes uh there was a moratorium
passed on you know i'm going back and forth with you on the air and i'm attacking you or
yeah issue with you which i hate it because i mean i think some of the best shows that uh i've
done i think you two i think we we enjoy playing off each other a lot and i love going after you
we're playing off figuratively say that yes figuratively speaking only when you say some of those
things that are uh perhaps you know now you need somebody to keep you in touch with reality
and i was not allowed to do that and uh w-i-o-g they've taken the gloves off they say if you feel
you know if Neil gets out of line you can feel free to go right after him so it'll be fun great
i know you look forward to that as much as i do okay now what what what what is this going to happen
in the morning or in the afternoon Steve at this time told you i spoke with time yesterday you still
up in the air i kind of see now i have difficulty believing that i mean i know you would not lead
us down the line you i would not lie i know that but i but i just find it difficult to believe that
you would negotiate and grant you their paying you a ton of money and i really mean it when i say
more power to you because i i am what you say about management i'm not a management type person i
think that most management in this business leads talent they get whatever they can out of you
and then when they're ready to scar you they couldn't kick her less what happens to you so i'm
delighted if you get a half a million more power to you but i can't believe that you would negotiate
that kind of a deal without knowing upfront when you were going to be on right to the country in fact
Tom put it very very well uh when i negotiated the deal which i did which by the way i i feel and
i agree with you and not not that management is ever what you would call blood me but i mean i
think this is a business and i think you have to negotiate your worth otherwise you don't uh you
know they're i mean if if if uh w n w s could have hired me for twenty five thousand dollars
they would have been glad to do that yeah but i i think the salary thing uh i think it's something that
will benefit all of us because i i we have a ten as it was at time you said a great yeah the
rhino regans the rising tide lifts all the ships for sure yeah and i think it it certainly will
benefit all of these the major talent certainly in this area but uh yeah and i told uh Mike when
what already has David Gold said he won't come back for a penny less than you make
hope he doesn't hang by his thumbs until that happens yeah but i hope he does in my discussions with
Mike Anthony and and you know he's a good i find Mike to be very open and and very very very i
mean i have worked with him extensively but uh i i have uh he he's i told him i said listen i'd
be glad to tell you you know what i think but uh when you're getting paid this coming they don't
pay me this kind of money to make uh uh you know management decisions as far as i'm concerned
they want me to do overnight that this price up wasn't happy to so i really was not part of
what they do when they want to get rid of you what that's what they do when they want to get rid of you
yeah well i i don't concern myself too much with that my feeling is that uh as much as i mean
this i mean there is a part of me that is always wanted to go up against you knew because i
think it'd be fun i think it'd be a good a good match but the point is why split that audience
in my i'm just giving you my thinking that's certainly not the management of iod necessarily but
the thing is if i go on i'll give this clamor convenient you know to have your audience join me
too but i mean that's that's that's what i leave tappy is what and leave tappy well i i might have
some problems with tappy i don't know it might be difficult by the way you are brutal to that poor lady
why we speak only the truth on this show it can you i've got to ask you this what is tappy like
off the air i got me off the air she's delightful we get along great she came in a two yesterday she
said i don't want you to think that it was me because i don't have any problem with anything you say
and i think it's all very funny and so on and so forth she doesn't understand it's all you know i mean
it exactly but uh no we get along great well it's it's interesting i gotta tell you it's it gets very
why aren't you surprised to learn she was a black woman steve i heard that no i of course not
i got a matter of fact please you're related to robin quivers did you know that yeah i know yeah i
got to be very honest i really don't i've i tried you know i tried to list everybody i can only make it
about five minutes into tappy shows and i keep tuning back hoping that something will happen that'll
hook me in but so far that has well what happened to leon the ratings i wonder because leon
had some serious problems in here in fact we might give steve the hour by hour breakdown you
know the book is in i'd love to hear that yeah would you like to hear it out for like from what
9 a.m. to 3 p.m but i'm what i'm really i'd probably like three to seven is what you want to hear
to sound too commercial but i'm really interested into the 25 to 54 numbers great well it's
unfortunately a kiss meet now in 25 to 54 i had a six share in men 25 to 54 uh go go through the day
let me hear you out you can break it with me because i've been listening and i haven't heard a breakdown
have they have have you and how can you run down okay i'll tell you i can you can hold on a minute
right yeah you're not going anywhere are you not gonna work i'm going nowhere till july first but
they got to pay you for this right yeah oh my god i have to they're they're just uh you know i
get some living expenses out of the kindness of their hearts they're paying you to keep your silence
they're very nice to me great okay hold on a second as is steve cane uh mr. in limbo in talk radio it's
11 19 at w.i.n.c when we come back we unveil for the first time anywhere the exciting new numbers
all next week on 39 to 1 it's 11 22 at w.i.n.c the land of the
three in the home of the grave steve cane is standing by now this is a momentous occasion isn't it
yeah i love it it's exciting okay at nine a.m. i can't give you the shares on 25 to 54 because they're
not on this page i do have the uh numbers of people average quarter hour which make it
terminal for the audience but i'll try to do my best okay you just give the regular numbers
whatever okay nine a.m. w.i.n.c 4.2 these are shares of the audience w.n.w.s
5.2 at that w.i.o.d 4.0 10 o'clock w.i.n.c 8.5
are you there steve i'm working w.i.o.d 2.7
oh boy w.n.w.s 2.8
brutal you let me an hour and a.d 11 a.m. w.i.n.c 8.1
w.i.o.d 2.5 w.s. news 2.9
noon 12 noon w.i.n.c 7.1
w.i.o.d 2.3 w.n.w.s 2.2
oh my god 1 o'clock w.i.n.c 7.0
w.i.o.d 2.3 w.n.w.s 2.2

number two o'clock two o'clock w.i.n.c 7.0
half him account 4.0 w.i.o.d 2.3
w.s. news are you listening Lee 1.9
oh 1.9 painful oh even the glow in the
glow in the final touch and get more than a 1.9
let me let me stick up for my old station for a second please
i'm like i counted you for and i well i know you'll give me an out of
tens or on this one that four point whatever it is the taffy god
now you know that is a spillover it's a spillover from your show
plus that i just spent so much time attacking her in the
wait a minute in addition to which the demo you know the demos
67% of the young demographics all disappear at two o'clock on this station
i can believe that that's a true story for example men and women 18 to
34 in one o'clock hour we've got 9400 in the two o'clock hour we've got 3300
now well that would take it okay now let's go to a 3 p.m. okay because this is
of some interest to you 3 p.m. taffy has a 4.1 w.i.o.d 2.5 and
w.s. news has at 3 p.m. a 3.0
unreal oh at four o'clock we have number doing news 3.2 i.o.d has a 2.7
and snooze a 3.4 five o'clock w.i.n.z with a 3.4
w.i.o.d with a 2.4 and w.s. news at 5 p.m. with a 4.0
that's the big hour at six o'clock wins with a 2.4 i.o.d with a 3.7
with sports talk and w.s. news with a 3.1 and then at seven o'clock
surely with a two then a two eight jerry with a five three a six six
a 9.4 and a 12 9 in the midnight hour
well not a not a sterling book for w.s. that's for sure
and i have a feeling it's only going to get worse
oh fucking shit Steve you were over there has leaf out of ever high in anyone who
was successful well how do you know i mean it depends which
you mean by no is the answer i guess but i don't know i don't really
understand fully what they're doing over there other than i can give you a
couple of theories that are you know from the inside that people may not
realize they have an excellent sales department at w.s. and there is some
feelings you can understand something they view the
entity over there as a combo and of course when you've got the number one
FM station which generates massive amounts of revenue
well you know when you have a dead book at w.s.s. you kind of lean on your combo
figures and have a sales department at x1 over there that is able to
do that and they do not i can say from a business point of
view experience extreme variations in income
uh... uh... uh... for the station has the numbers on w.s.s. fluctuate up and down
so from a business point of view and basically i mean let's face it we uh... you
know we as performers and as listeners tend to view uh... the radio is
entertainment from a programming point of view but basically it is a
business and when you're doing practically as well uh... you know when you
have a good book as a bad book uh... it can you know can make it happen that's a
cop at steve i mean that's like saying to white good winds twenty five games in
the next second picture wins five games you know saying well they won thirty
between them that's not bad i'm not you understand something i'm not giving
you my viewpoint i'm just telling you you know how they
tend to view it at the station and there is also uh... some feeling of
white and i think this was it the root of the salary
conflict that i was involved in with them they went to their sales manager
who quite frankly is not a dear friend of mine he was the only person over there
really didn't get along with that we were probably selling one and he was that's
well that no because they didn't really remember to get to involved in selling
under uh... mister lab i hear that steve you uh...
i had a little shot it took twenty minutes folks we finally got a little shot
from steve that's good there are people in the business i don't like i'll
have a few but i want to mention any names here but right at the top of the list
but the point is i don't want you to do negative on the show steve if you want to be
positive that's okay i don't believe in negative but the point is the story of
that is that they went to steve liba and they said uh... do you need uh... you know
how important is that the steve can't be here from a financial point of view as
opposed to a programming point of view mister lapis said well we don't need steve
as long as i'm here we'll keep it sold out he's not important and evidently that
was at the root of their bargaining philosophy really and that's well that's the
story of god and i assume it's true and i know he's deep what i can probably
believe that and uh... that's why i'm no longer at uh... w n w s but uh... okay now
there's all this rumor about al being very a disenchanted with what's going on
and he and li have been sparring on the air
and uh... if al should wind up leaving and going somewhere else and obviously
he certainly got the credentials to uh... go to a lot of places uh... that would
pretty much be the end wouldn't
well over
again it depends on the perspective you must understand this company was making
a lot of money when they had w g b s and we all agree on you know the effectiveness
of uh... uh... w g b s is a talk they should so the point is they i don't know again
you must understand i don't know any of that i'm just giving you my my feelings in
my intuitions there may be some feeling that it works scenario if they go back to
a you know say i'll have to say uh... they you know they went back to uh... you know
that g b s level of of programming on uh... w n w s
they still have a very viable and uh... you know i have money making operation
and i think that the feeling may be why spend all this money for these expensive
salaries when we basically can generate similar again i don't agree with this but
this is what may be there thinking uh... why you spend all that money for salaries when
we can generate the same revenue uh... you know thanks to uh... very sick
but you know where that kind of a philosophy eventually leads
to becomes a one five and they become one and then it becomes a point eight
i mean there's you know you can take the f m here the f m here a few years ago was
doing sixes and sevens and eights and you know now it's down to one sixes and uh...
you know once you start that kind of a slide you say well you know we can make
this much money it doesn't really matter when you when you when the bottom line
becomes the bottom line you eventually wind up going into the toilet and can i
say that i don't know yeah i agree you know my orientation is programming and i've
used to have a fantasy of being involved in management putting together a station with
a jury Williams and Neil Rogers Steve can you know getting the top people in the
country and giving the you know the public all day long the best but again my
orientation is programming and uh... that's why i you know i have those feelings but
from the business point of view uh... Jefferson pilot has been successful in the past
and that's another thing that you have to consider we view
w-s-e-s the old story about the uh... the blind man
feeling the elephant tail and saying an elephant looks like a snake we view
uh... w-n-w-s as an entity down here in terms of this market uh... w-n-w-s is a tiny little
particle of Jefferson pilots uh... holdings and Jefferson pilot of course you know is
is worth it i mean it's just uh... company of tremendous wealth
and sometimes the decisions that may be made again i don't know this i'm just
going by a sense i have a feeling that the decision to keep my salary at the level
that it was my feeling is was not made in Miami that it was a decision that was made
in Charlotte by Jefferson pilot who are not programming people and they don't really
understand uh... you know that their bottom line people and they think what they talent
over a hundred thousand they i have my understanding is they didn't the idea of
giving me the hundred thousand i was earning when they picked up my contract
uh... was outrageous to them i mean they had to because they inherited the contract
but these people not being in the programming end of the business don't really
understand that their bottom line insurance well what you're saying then is that
there's really not hope that they're gonna know much hope that they're gonna get
anyone very exciting over there and that probably explains why it's taken so
long to replace you well i wouldn't say that i mean there are you not gonna get
anyone very good that cheap well it's gonna be hard i mean there are you i mean when i came
down here from orlando my salary my starting salary was seventeen thousand dollars plus
ten dollars a life spot so i mean there are people out there that are good that perhaps have
not been discovered or whatever but it's hard to i mean there are not a lot of great talk to
our hosts in the country and if you can say that again it is a very good people think it's easy
to just get up in front of a mic to be great at this business is very unusual and then
those of us who are at the top of it i think deserve the big bucks because when you go into any
business and you get to the you know the top five or six people in any business or in any field
that's the kind of money they earn and it's hard to find i had a conversation with Lee
over the five still talk to power a lot and he was telling me you know that they're involved in
this big talent search and he said oh there's a lot of telling he's there a lot of a lot of good
talk to our south there he's been listening to tapes and i told him i said lead there may be a
lot of good ones but there are very few great ones and he had to concede that i mean it's it's a
hard job to be great at amen well listen this has been a lot of fun on whether it's your call i
wish you the best of luck not too good but we wish you the best of luck uh it's good talking to
you i've always wanted to call you on here maybe one of these days you'll uh call me if we're not

here that's like the fm format a or r all over the road okay now let's talk a little bit about
that and i understand a lot of this is in stuff and some of the people in the building get very
nervous and they're always telling me oh too much of this inside stuff the audience uh they can't
the audience doesn't care they love every minute of oh yeah i get close people before come on
you're gonna talk about the ratings or anything like yeah i mean even if we just make it up as we go
along like lead us you know can you believe they're still playing the most listen to talk host
it's that's shameless that's absolutely shameless i i was gonna call him on it let last rating book
when they did it but uh to to continue it after two rating books i mean there only two rating
services birch and arbitron and both of them have the same result you know the latest the surveys
it's not even a contest allis so the fact that they're still playing that the beginning you would
think you would say to him i don't i mean yeah i respect that apparently he's beyond that
well i don't hear him talking about the numbers at all did you no oh yeah he was crying yesterday
or the day before about how one rating book doesn't make a career and you just going on and on
how about two yeah or three uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh that's true that is
absolutely true and the ratings aren't precise and i'm not going to sit here and pretend that they are
but uh certainly they indicate a trend don't they they sure seem so and what it is is he's really
in an oasis over there i mean give you know despite all the kid in the run he really is the only talent
they have left over there i tell you one thing the only oasis that successful to mistone is rust
oasis over at the ad team but other than that being an oasis is a bad situation but he really is
he's the only one over there now that that's pulling any any kind of an audience and uh you know
you've heard him you can see he's got a five before you come on the air and if you aren't here he'd
probably out there very well when he's on a pose you've got a five two in the nine o'clock hour
last time you had a five six in an hour yeah and you can't say anything about look at the other one
say on a pose Cassandia was on in an hour but that's the next best thing to be on a one one one one
week she's on that hour and the next week she's on with micronary and the next week something else
is on there i mean you really do need a scorecard to keep what keep track of what's going on and i
do by the way you know what i saw a note yesterday interesting idea i don't know how well it'll work
w h anni up that used to be the country station carries the mess they're going all sports
24 hours a day sports radio they're going to be the first one in the country with net grade i don't
think it's going to work very well that would be excellent for my can't think he's probably listening
right now and there's a rumor that sports talk is going to be going four hours yeah i heard that six
to ten yeah but it's not very often how many nights aren't there games they have a game on just
they don't understand though they had that fluke back in a fall because the dolphins in her canes
were a big topic of conversation yep and they had that fluke for sports and Anthony comes
burrowing into town he looks at that and hey let's do 80 hours of sports talk this you know
as well as i do this is not here there's nothing to talk about although i will say i did
two days ago we did a whole show on hockey well not a whole show i heard it but we never had
an open line i mean it was incredible some of those names though are coming out there that uh
you know dug mones and yeah johnny buce dug mones can you say that on here i don't know no it depends
what he's moaning about dug groan's dug makes guttural sounds perhaps but certainly not
we can't even discuss how Terry search art died no please uh this is a family show although i
will say this in the teen column all across for wion z we have no teens zero and you know you're
an expert in your course they're in school now so in spite of this huge audience there are no
teens so jimma kine from the fcc or any of those other bureaucrats are listening uh we don't have
to concern ourselves with that now although what happens during the summer book i suppose you'll
have to turn your act out but don't probably listen to bon joe v in muremore well accept oh god
can you imagine the implications first they'll listen to that record then they'll actually be going
out there and doing it go all the kid in the side that's really frightening i know it it really is
it's just and this is what i keep try to tell people with this fcc thing it's got nothing to do
with howard stern it has nothing to do with shock radio it's got to do with the idea that all
around us were surrounded by a group of right wing oppressive people who want a sensor
people who want to send other people how to live their lives they're not satisfied if they want to
live their own life in some oppressive manner and you know jen you're flexing every three seconds
guide love them they're entitled to do it but don't tell other people they have just reminded me we
don't subscribe to the summer book so you know cino evil here no evil we don't know i mean if we
got eight million people we don't know about it this is hard and this cost would made the point
the sunday in this column which you know for the people were in listen before was a wonderful column
it's they always find some justification and children are a great fallback we're protecting the
children because who's going to come out against protecting children but in point of fact the kids
anything the kids are hearing on the radio they're hearing a lot worse in the school yachts anyone
who's ever been near a school knows that and a word's empty here i mean use them for a period of
time to become meaningful well just for a good example you couldn't say rapin very you couldn't
say virgin impregnant the 10 years ago and remember when par said water closet yeah and then you
see one that leaving the air yeah water closet yeah the the reason i used the word rape you know the
one the one absurdity lunacy in our whole language is that you can't say the f word
which to most people has a pleasant connotation well depending on how you yeah but you can say
rape which is ugly and violent disgusting and is essentially the same thing lots of you want to
figure that out and say rape on the year now there'd be one tall coasters who'd be off she would
never show left yeah that's true she'd be out of question i never show left anyway oh come on
i what did surely do did i mention that before but i think i look at those seven and i numbers a two
at seven o'clock and a two-way to eight o'clock i guess you're right but you surely had to run out
for shaman after legal sand yesterday yeah i let me can i make a prediction because i really don't
know i just talked to a lot of different people in the business and i put all of rumors together
i think sandies out at i.o.d if she i should be on the show i'm doing at w.s news i'm not sure
what hours i think she's going to wind up over there i think that steve will do ten to two and
miller will do two to six and bill will be on at night and uh... and that's it i think that's
going to be the i disagree i really do although i agree with the second part if she is out she'll be on
in w.s as quickly as is a lot i don't know she has a no compete and i don't know if a no compete
is valid if they get rid of you is it oh hey that's a whole different ballgame if she's an employee
and i didn't depend a contractor they can hold her doing on company even if they get rid of her
sure that doesn't seem right but anyway unless they have some kind of an agreement she would
she'll be on n.w.s immediately upon leaving i.o.d except i happen to know that she she wants to stay at
i.o.d you're not dancing on a grave now are you no she was very indignant when she came back about
my dancing on a grave no i think i think that she'll be at i.o.d for a while for a number of reasons
i think that what happened the three days she was off there afraid of some kind of a backlash
and and secondly sandy has about nine years in change in in at i.o.d which is a cox company the same
company i work for and after ten years you get a wonderful pension that's really is happens to be
true and so sandy it would it would she would be very foolish not to try and hang on there are you
hearing that sandy hang on well i and i she knows it how's the plastic surgeon doing by that
was a terrible shot actually sandy said that and you stole it from her with another thing in this
rating book that really had i i know that people in the audience they listen to different kinds of
radio and she and i say that are and and some are music for us wouldn't it be something if all
of this kind of like little creeks and river is met you know and they all turn out together well i
bet you that if you went out in the street and asked a hundred people that sixteen and would tell
you a country was something you use having sex probably i think there's just no maybe Jim Baker
is having sex with contra lears yeah or contra bay there was a there was a picture of Jim Baker right
after the right after he went off the air and it was taken a long lens about a block away he was
sitting with some babe that wasn't tami by the pool i mean a real shapely young really yeah
make well the only supposedly going to the latest things they like to swap around swap me they call
yeah well if you don't know what you can't tell me she's incredible man she's a piece of work
okay listen we're at the end of this hour and we digested it and we've heard from some real
celebrities out there and greats and your greats it's been incredible first two hours but when
we come back following the new news break then we're going to turn it over to the audience and if
they're not excited about ratings and radio and the FCC and everything oh my here again is
me alright okay it's 10 past noon at w.i.n.c. Tom jik is here the tv radio editor the mommy news
we're talking about radio and television about the new ratings and about anything else that tickles
your fancy we're talking about the FCC and first amendment rights and a whole bottle wax and let
me give you our numbers in date county 624 0191 624 0191 in brownered 764 0707 Tom is just immersed
you should go blind reading there's numbers over there is having a nervous breakdown and we're
going to be really want to have a let's start in hallowed day hello hi Neil congratulations on
the book thank you two points first of all Ed little is no longer with mutual radio i know
he's down here running traffic patrol oh he does traffic patrol yeah he owns the thing i didn't know that
yeah yeah that's the one that's on all the other stations that give it to him for free and you know
you're the you guys are the only ones that have your own airplanes up there
what was that all about what was that all about who was that
oh he's on a traffic patrol we're just having that yeah okay yeah okay all kinds of hand signals here
all right all right i'm in the business so i know about that all right did you happen to see
the McVealer report on Friday no you missed a good one they had the this is to do with the FCC
and they had the the girl on there by the name of Diane killery she's the FCC attorney out of
Washington yeah she's a moron yeah you got that right yeah she was on a crossfire show with Kane yeah
uh her first comment was that quote organs that are offensive now what does that mean
her mouth's offensive to me yeah she is she is patently offensive to me and everything she says
is patently offensive i know it but it was so funny to look at it and all the things and it let's
see i just got a few notes there the in you window this is talking about Howard Stern again
yeah the double entendres the in you windows uh over the line to the extreme now what again does
that mean well who measures what's extreme that's the thing you got that right uh she then said well
the children here in the audience the uh the radio station should be governed by congress
quote and unquote well in a roundabout way it is well in a very roundabout way well no congress
appropriates money for the FCC congress approves who's on the FCC uh that's that's uh in congress has
made its will known to the FCC in a number of cases yeah but you know she keeps using this line about
the congress has spoken and so on and so forth the FCC act was last amended 53 years ago i would
hardly say that that indicates that congress has spoken in regard to anything that has to do with
contemporary broadcast standards right uh that 25 years ago and i first started in radio that
you couldn't even flesh a toilet on the air in fact one guy was fired because he did it yeah uh
so this moment that only toilet flush ever in the history of broadcasting is on minachi bonka
far as i know market forces otherwise meaning advertisers and you know average we're all in the
advertising business and we've got to get a show over to get the numbers to uh you know raise
the advertising rates uh that should be made unlawful by congress uh again another quote uh
well the interesting thing about this administration is that there and this FCC is that their entire
philosophy has been let the marketplace decide but that's only up to the point where the marketplace
decides what it agrees with apparently well of course but again where do you draw the line
i think the market is decided with niels numbers with how it stands numbers i think that's the
marketplace deciding i agree and uh again children unreasonable risk no kids how do you kill
tell if kids are in the audience her response was that more kids listen to radio and during the day
than are in school that's ridiculous i know it's ridiculous there aren't that many kids listen
to radio period spending an awful lot of money on education foolishly then maybe we just
started by every kid a transistor radio yeah either that or a television show well i'll be
honest with you the response we got in the mail today and other we looked at it the second time
is pre-paltry and i'm i'm beginning to understand that if this campaign of mine is going to make it
it's going to have to make it with help of people like lanceter and tampa and jury williams and
bossed in other parts of the country because the people here evidently most of them are too stupid
to understand the implications of it and you know it's really frustrating because you got this
gigantic audience out there i mean here these big numbers but again to try to get them to do something
that's another thing well they don't really think anything's going to happen it's going to have to
take you know someone in coming in here in brown shirts to pull you off the air and then they'll
understand but again it's not just it's not just me it's not a question of whether i'm going to be
on here or not or how it's turns going to be on here it's a question of whether next week the
government decides that we can't speak out and criticize the president that we can't criticize
religious it in that's all of these things okay i think it ended already because the response on
the phone here today this is embarrassing this is like that Friday night when tampa is out with me
about three years ago i mean i just don't believe the terrible look at the things going on and i know
it this is incredible it's like the whole audience is going into a coma now we've got two lines
open in each county and date six two four oh one nine one and in brown it's seven six four
oh seven oh seven four lottery hello hello how are you okay great i have a couple of questions
this whole talk radio thing is kind of new to me after the United Kingdom where it's not really
that prevalent and what's been got on recently seems to be very very controversial because it
would appear to me that the whole idea of talk radio is so the general public can view their
particular views on kind of events no no no i would have thought it would be a good medium for that
well that's part i would imagine that's why you have the the telephone call and so the general
public could view their ideas but if you bear with me what i want to know is that a death on a
definitive policy on the words that cannot be used because it would appear to me again that
anything can be misconstrued as a gesture for a painting of fencing depending upon the person
who's listening to it you got people like linden russ who's right wing views could be you know
described as paint layer fencing to anybody yeah well i that has to do with content the commission
says they don't care about content but does it about come back to the paint layer fencing no patently
offensive is in terms of sexual material oh yeah you can talk about killing sexual or
expatory activities or organs that's what's patently offensive you get come on and and
shield for the clan and other disgusting organizations anti-semitic any racist comments or any
can't talk about sex that's okay but if you have any any discussion that has sexual innuendo
and dealing with organs or expatory activities which is another way of saying you can't say
sh on a year then they get all upset about it you know i i think this thing's being attacked maybe
from the wrong perspective the the opening part of the first amendment is congress shall make no
regarding an establishment of religion and obviously these laws are based on religious taboos
they're not based on any kind of anything that makes any sense it's all based on religion the
christian religions that are now involved uh... are the ones who are pushing for these anti-sexual
judge you can talk about all the violence you want you can put all the disgusting killing you want
but if you talk about sex you're sure that they have something to do with perhaps pms
you know pms or syndrome because that's obviously pertaining that's but sexual and excretar
yeah you know you're obviously kind of like you know that the obvious answer is that we don't know
they get it made this vague and ambiguous ruling i've got it right in front of me from the fcc
and it's a you know they don't want to give you any specific so who the hell knows what we can talk
about well that's intentional and by making a vague and ambiguous you know what they're trying to do
is to intimidate a lot of broadcast there's a lot of license holders and to try to uh... you know
force them to stop talking about things that they consider objectionable
just like the children's considers things objectionable on bumpers tickers you know it's so
basic it's so evident and the fact that the majority of people out there are you know again
brain dead they're in suspended animation they're not going to take any action you know this is a
classic example of how weak this country is i mean the government could they could actually come
out tomorrow and say okay we're going to take away the first amendment
i don't know what people are thinking to be up to decide it about any uproads or whatever
but it's all part of a pattern that you like you say you've got one group that wants to do away
with t-shirts you've got another group that wants to do away with bumpers tickers you've got
another group that wants to control what's on the radio you've got a principle now in miramar who
won't let it very innocuous song be played in senior prom at which a lot of the people there are
legal adults in the state of florida where does it end they just chip away gradually and then you
wake up one morning and you find out you're not see germany again yeah got the several lines to open
in response today by the way sucks we have two open lines in brown and seven six four oh seven oh seven
seven seven six four oh seven oh seven and we have one open line in date six two four oh one nine
one i just can't believe it homestead hello hi there's a movie that's been on movie channel this
way called Lenny about Lenny Bruce yeah it really is apropos what's happening now how is
during is the modern day Lenny yeah it's absolutely and the thing about any Bruce was like in one
scene he talks about dirty words and he said I'll tell you what's dirty and then he described
several killings I think you talked about Kennedy's assassination you talked about segregation
and poverty so that's dirty and then you said the f word that's nice you know he said you could
even greet your parents with it well like I said that and it really made me think about it for
a minute well as I said before I said many times and we're you know then we can listen to all the
hate all the violence we want explain to me why you can't say rape and you can't say the f word yeah
no one has ever been able to explain that to me 21 past 12 at w and z my guest is Tom jica the
radio tv editor the Miami news we're talking about radio about television about the FCC about the
first amendment about the ratings about anything you want and we have an open line in each county
in date county six two four oh one nine one and embroward seven six four oh seven oh seven
and I really do mean it I mean a response today stinks the high heaven and again you know if there
are people out there in the audience who think that I'm just going to drop the ball on the whole thing
even if they don't talk about that particular issue they've got nothing to say about anything
that's going on in the business which is incredible yeah this is the one the most exciting this is
and you know what this reminds me of I don't want to sound bitter but in a way I am because this
is happening every time every time after you I do well and which has been most of the time
and the ratings come out and I don't think I overdo it I mean we do talk about it whether the good
bad or indifferent we've always done that on the show and it's like okay sit there and stew and
now we're you know we're just not going to talk to you this happened to be like a half a dozen
times in this market yeah and it seems to be an interesting ratings I certainly get enough calls
on and people are always asking when they're coming out yeah well I guess they're all they're all
playing a hard to get today I don't know 22 minutes past 12 at W I N C let's do a little break
here 25 past noon at W I N C Tom jiff is here I'm here we're kind of in a coma I don't want to
steal Al's material but we're in a coma and we have another radio celebrity standing by on the
line good morning mr. Tanner I hate that to do now good good evening how are yours mine are
where they were when I got up this morning yeah well that's good you know I um I think you're
right about this business that people being in a coma about this whole first amendment thing
and I think the only way you're going to stir up enough trouble to get them excited is to
point out that there are so many things in danger beside Neil Rogers and Howard Stern Howard Stern
is an indis-market it's sort of an abstraction to these people and you're exactly right because
all this is leading down a road where none of us wanted to go where your listeners don't want it to
go and the road is paved with apathy just that simple yeah some other words I don't have to feel bad
you're getting the same response well well as Neil pointed out here a couple of days ago that
people kind of thought that Hitler was just an amusing little oddity now you know and his early
oh yeah well I just don't pay attention to him and he'll go away well it's all because the
fact of the matter is that there are a lot of interesting things going on in the government today
while we're so busy concerned concerning ourselves with all of our north and people like that did
general C-Cord and so forth nobody's concerned with GE quietly gobbled up their biggest
competitor for a defense contracting business RCA and in the process just happened to get the
number one television network there's a lot of things going on the people really ought to wake
up and pay attention to and that's that's on the one side of the issue side of what I wanted to
come in on another side of the ratings I've been listening to you guys talking about the album
rock situation here's the whole story with album rock album rock has never been that popular in
South Florida the reason that she did well is because it's only one of the kind there's always been
about six and a half shares of album rock back in the old data four versus she days she had a
four they had a three yeah Bill but nobody's doing progressive album rock here there is no station
because they're all caught up in classic rock Tom they're all trying to go for demographics you
know and and that's fine I think it's an interesting point Neil Rogers and I have one thing in
color and we play for whoever the hell wants to listen to the radio I don't care if there it
Neil has 18 year olds or 68 year olds and I don't care if I do either I have a lot of teens he
has a lot of older people who cares it's warm bodies you want people to listen to the radio
uh it's up to the sales guys that get out there and market this stuff to dissect it and uh
feed it to the agencies like Pablo well it's still it you have to wonder someone came up walked
in here a few minutes ago and came up with an interesting theory that what's happening now to
music on radio is what's happened to television to a certain extent people are listening to their
own cassettes that's also true uh in reality dance and rhythm based music has always been uh very
very very important part of the local music scene in the 15 years that I've been doing music
radio down here that's what it was at y 100 when y 100 got away from that their ratings went
down the drain what they did this time is you so aptly ported out your column uh I think they
have made some improvements in their station but basically they bought the book they paid a quarter
of a million dollars for a contest it says they've been doing it in one twenty five thousand
that's how they put themselves on the f 15 years ago yeah right it worked then it will work every
it's working less and less well less and less efficiently um as far as hot 105 is concerned
their problem has been reason they wanted I think uh to make the change with me that they did
is they want to learn the thing from out of town and I think you folks are with their w i and z
know about people from Maine who come in into Miami airport and freak out because they see
his fanics and black standing around yeah and uh the reality of the situation is that if you don't
live and work in Miami you don't know a damn thing about the radio down here and you're probably
going to lose out his bed is w i n c f m has a good name was on whatever it is today joke can was on
the talk of stepping down the radio dial that are caused by ignoring the fact that this is not
Kansas City Kansas well that's what that's what can was saying about Jefferson pilot running
uh w n w s from north carolina and they have no idea what's going on down here this is a unique
city and I happen to think that Miami South Florida which is a media term if you will Miami
Ford Law to Dale uh it's unique I have had it exciting I think it's a a robbing city and I think
it's a challenge to be driving I don't know we could be getting in trouble with that if you think
you're going to uh force Charlotte North Carolina radio down these people's roads and have them
get ratings you I mean the result of that Bill this is Glenn Hill how you doing hey Glenn how are you
real good um I just wanted to ask you Neil has been wondering for quite a long time on the air
whatever happened to Casey well Casey had his Lancet record in 1980 and then he had well actually
not true he had uh sort of a medium-sized hit record while I was in Washington around 1984 and
I speak to him from time to time uh I think what has happened is he simply lost the inspiration to do
his music um well I don't know it seems to me he's just another one of these one hit stars are you
are he had a gun in him to it's two of these two of these we had the longest string of number one
record since the Beatles is that right yeah why they're right by me he's not a one hit artist but he's
artist who likes inspiration and who amongst us can say what it takes uh to provide inspiration
whether you're a talk show host or a recording artist you you've got to get the uh the juice from
somewhere who well he just he just happened to be in the right place with disco music when disco
is hot and fortunately it went went by the wayside rather quickly well actually I disagree with you
I think it never went away here in Miami it's alive and well and we're just calling it something else
well I I know what I call it I know we can't say that on the air
y'all lives in Chicago but is here in Miami in spirit this morning
can't believe it yeah I certainly think one thing that I was listening to you guys I don't
happen to have a copy of the book because I may not have come you know until we like four or five
days later by pony express or something but um I was listening to your album I always
it's incredible you don't see that sort of personality pool that Neil Rogers has
but listen the audience I mean this is the first day the book just came in this morning at 930
and the audience is already getting even now so don't ever get cocky in this market I don't
know if I can say that but don't ever get overconfident because man immediately they turn on you
now you know what you provide you provide entertainment rest that stuff is boring
yeah you can say that again say it again one the way not listening to your
you and uh good talking to you Bill look before it to the mo hill to that okay okay good
lie out okay 1232 at w i n z we have an open line in brown or if there's anybody alive
there 764 0707 Davie hello oh well brown and red amazing
yeah frightening yeah those other stations are boring
I just really start I know that's probably the difficulty there's so much going on people
just can't figure out where to start now I'm finding yourself in a motel at Tammy Baker
yeah now please take out just a script of face off
um I haven't tried to get people to sign the petition and they're like well what's this for
I explained to them what the FCC is trying to do and how it's the first step in in
restriction of our personnel rights and they're like yeah well and then they're so
empathetic they're like yeah well maybe I'll sign it I'll think I'll think about it yeah I think
the word is dumb I think you're being kind when you say empathetic they're just too stupid to
understand what the implications are I know it's unreal then saying what the principal of Miramar
yeah now I heard that song you play that's pretty boring song yeah certainly not controversial
um I don't I don't see where they they can get on their high horse and tell students to do that
um that he had somebody on yesterday the day before from uh school board by our county yeah
and they got on this thing about dress codes for students and teachers and he says he doesn't
think teachers should have a dress code but students definitely should and I don't see the logic
in that why should it go for one group and not the other well that seems to be the way alive here
if one one group of people telling another group had a behavior don't do as I do do as I say isn't
that what the Tammy and Jim thing is all about exactly exactly yeah I don't see how these people
can live with themselves though why is it time after time after time that the people who are most
specific about telling others to live are the ones who get caught in the back seat of college with
eight euro kids why is that I was afraid of everybody being like them maybe they don't like themselves
well I think they're trying to focus attention on everybody else they're trying to shine the spotlight
everybody else in the meantime you know do all of their stuff in the dark you'll allow me thank you
death protest too much right yeah I don't know how this ties in with the FC ruling but a lot of
record companies and lobbying Congress for years to restrict home taping and
restrict in the import to these new digital tape reporters in the street and
pan i said you know most people are listening to tapes at home and that's what I do and that's
the record company keeps saying well if you you let them tape whatever they want we're going to
lose so much money and that's just a lot of BS because I do a lot of taping because I like to listen
to my own music I don't like to listen to that damn thing to trash and I have five five of those
crates those teach craze filled with records because I buy some money to make my own tapes up
you know I'll go out and buy a complete album for one or two songs on the album now so I
I the fact that I taped makes me spend more money rather than left you know because I don't go
and try to get pirated copies and I think that that's another thing that needs to be looked into
is all this lobbying by these companies well the movie industry when vcs came along for it and
fought and wanted out wanted to outlaw vcs then wanted to tax them and it's turned out the vcs
are the best thing that ever happened to the movie industry now because they've got a whole
another market there that didn't exist before yeah people are basically honest there's always
going to be some dishonest people but most people are honest and then they're not going to rip you off
I know okay there's a question here yeah um the rating you you had some of the information a couple
days ago and then you had to break down by the hours today why do they send them separately why
don't they just send them all at once well that's a good question I really don't know that I don't
know how they go about putting the book together but they're you know they put everything into a
computer up there in beltsville merrill and then I'm sure that there's certain things that come out
first before they actually print them up and then they put a whole book together yeah it's
a luminous amounts of information I'm looking at a sheath here almost as big as the telephone book
and it's like a baseball game when when the when the score first comes in over the yservic first
they give you the score then they give you the lion's score and then they give you the box score it
just takes time to put the box score together the full book is like the box score is that that phone
size pack you got there that's just for Miami area yeah just for the stations in this market wow
it's unbelievable yeah well we're only about four million of them okay listen don't give up keep
plugging away for us I will one of the reasons why I think you might not be having a lot of people
calling today at the end of the month people get paid people trying to do end a month business
or something that might be the reason why that's an interesting theory hey listen if that's true
I'm gonna take off the end of the month every month that's a good idea all right have a nice week
you too thanks a lot twenty three me four one we have another celebrity a color standing by after
our next break we have one open line on the board it's in brow it's seven six four
twelve forty a w i z on the arches our guest is Tom jica of the Miami snooze and we have another
celebrity color on the line this can't really be Greg Budell can it yes it can sure sounds like
Greg Budell it's me how you doing private citizen Greg Budell right I'm not sure if I want to become
a decent mechanic or go to the front you're here with taffy all these people in no compates are
coming up it's in this amazing you could maybe do a show I know can get a lot of litigation
from this show yeah I thought that having a six month pay vacation would be a lot of fun but at
this point I've got a little less than two months left it really stinks well I'll tell you what
if you'd like to try out if you want to come in here and you can make some arrangements I'd
love to take the next two months off yeah hey the rest on my laurels now I mean I certainly
can't improve on these numbers so I'd like to take a couple of months off you'll just pay me and
come in here do the show congratulations you deserve those numbers I think it says a lot for
being yourself on the radio I think that's the thing that makes you different the illicit I don't
believe there's any contrived or any phoniness in what you do thank you and it's kept me sane I have
laughed my I think it's one of those body parts that can give us trouble off the last few months
it's really been fun I as a matter of fact I saw somebody ran into Greg the other day and they
said he was missing no so now we know where when he laughed it off just about by the way I can't
take you up on your offer because you said something a wind of thorn a while back she has
suggested considering a move in the talk radio and with with your when you reacted the way you did
I immediately ruled out any career in the tacos why because it takes you it said hey buddy why
is there be a taco or something like that that doesn't mean you couldn't do it no I just get
nervous when I hear people like Joe Johnson is it an example I like Joe he's a great guy yeah but
the all the way does take shots at jikka times looking with a real sour low so he's maybe not so
great a guy he's a decent well he's a guy and I'm fine the bottom line is Joe is not a talk show host
no he's never going to be I will be there may 16th I've been working as a private citizen and
you know this is a frustrating thing because I would be railing on this if I were on the air but
well when my time comes I'll do it by the way I forgot to mention Tanner it slipped right by me
said emerald hills and I guess somebody hasn't told him but we're doing it here at the station
and wind so I'm glad that you just mentioned that again yeah it was good to hear him too today yeah
and keep on man it's great hey listen Greg you're going to be doing a music station what are you
going to do to turn it around I just talking about it all morning what's going on in music in this
market you know it's just it's disgusting I have some real strong opinions on it I don't know how
much I can say without jeopardizing my situation right now but everybody is researching things
three dimensionally to find out you know how many dwarfs like this on yeah let's take another study
let's call Frank maggot and take another study for 20 grand I think consultants are the
the ruination of the business they've taken the creativity out of it yeah and I expect I mean
this is a business of feelings and emotions and I expect to use a lot of that when I get over
to where I'm going next and well where is the music audience gone pardon me where has the
music audience gone I'm just a parent well Neil has shown that you can entertain people without
playing and sawing I think that you know what I'm looking forward to for myself is being able to
play to the audience and not to the station management for the first time in seven years that'll be
it I think a big change for me the music audience I think it's just you know they all say you go
out there and they all say the same thing everybody's playing the same song they're playing them
over and over and over again I mean you know you're the inspiration by Chicago how many times can
you hear that before you gag on it well it does it you know power did very well this time is
personality DJs coming back I think so I think the trouble is there's very few people that can go
on the radio it really be themselves the personality you know everybody's got to be in an
out there and they've got to talk like this and you know I mean there's so much phoneiness on it
sucks yeah I don't think you can say that but I'll say it does suck you're right well I appreciate that
Neil and I enjoyed that well I wanted to disprove what you said we didn't eat little music on the show
I mean we would be naked with that little bit it goes well yeah those violins make it loud
yeah
this beautiful boy or a W like a big talk yeah
well Rick Shaw go get cut right into life so audience for you with this by the way Neil I
enjoyed your review of my former employer last week I was almost drove out the road really that
was wonderful you mean the legend in his own mind uh-huh okay now wait a minute let's see if I
can do the talk up on the last part of this record it was fascinating unbelievable was that
incredible or what oh let's go man all the radio people out there are so impressed now man they're
just spasming all over their knee at this point they're going nuts well listen it's great here and
from yeah and we'll look for you on the 16 okay and the done agony says hello thank you okay
well this is really something the audience doesn't want to talk to us but all the radio people want
to talk that's what I'll screw the audience you know yeah let them stick it where the moon don't shine
mirror mar hello celebrity talk hi hi I have a question directed to Tom Tick a please yes
okay I read a column a few weeks ago about Tom like us yes either coming back with his wife and yeah
I understand that he's neither coming back nor is married well if he's not married he lied to me
he is married and as far as I'm coming back he's not no from what I hear as he used that he used
w a w s here is leverage to get a better contract than I was on it I see I was
um it's wondering about you're in Miramar right yeah did you go to Miramar high no you have kids
who go to Miramar high I went to my only beach I well what do you think of this whole thing with
this principle I think it's terrible I really I mean you know I wasn't going to comment on that
situation when you live in the community why don't you do something about it I work here I'm
I'm going from work well if I live in that community I'm gonna talk to his lady she doesn't
live in Miramar yeah I mean you're where does it stop we know where we know how it starts
you know only cringe it where it's gonna stop hey this is really the first stop
right of it because I don't have children there I didn't know about this I really didn't and it's
really an innocuous song the worst things in it are the suggestions that that kids might actually
drink beer and and and fool around in the backseat of the car and all it really says is fool around
and uh no it's terrible because you know in elementary school they're taking Judy
blue books off the shelf I mean we're trying to do that as long as the community lets them they
will I think they ought to take judge blue them off the shelf or put them on the shelf yeah no it's
very bad it should be stopped I today which is I didn't know about it no one ever approached me about
it and I definitely signed a petition against that well will you send in for one sure please I
guess they can't play in I'll give you the address again in a little bit okay they won't be playing
Bruce Springsteen's born to run at that prom no I believe that your legs around my velvet are they're
gonna be playing Bruce Springsteen's born in the USSR yeah in Miramar a bunch of commie fascist pigs
over there yeah now send the application to send the form okay thanks okay bye bye okay yeah all of
these things couldn't exist that they all feed on each other when when one of them happens it
makes it a little bit easier to do the next one for lottery hello hi Neil hi um I'm 21 and I
just wanted your management to know that you do have young listeners big basically because the
the music stations in the town totally suck suck is the word right yeah it's it's really horrible
but we're gonna start a new FM we're gonna have new colliders for the FM WSUK that probably go
over really good yeah um what were the numbers like for for the music stations what what was the
number one probably why they were almost all down powering up a little bit but almost all the
others were down she was genetically G.C.R was down the FM here was down the power went up
maxi waxi was down a little bit power went up and hot what a hot two went down a little bit
yeah went down pretty good but yeah really yeah that's about the only other station I listened to
I drive a lot so I just got so sick of these these fake like like Greg Budeau was saying these fake
people on the air and hey there it is it does it does so I just was playing around with the radio
one day and ran across Neil that was several months going I just leave the dial right there on
94 unless Taffy McCallum comes down a minute that's one of five for a couple hours well the problem
is that all these can solve it as Budeau said they all try and find this one typical person in
program the station charm and nobody is typical yeah yeah it's it's really hey to use the word
but it sucks yeah sucks um Neil that that little spot about uh Cammy Faze new album yeah are you
playing that today that's hysterical isn't it it's hilarious oh you mean that well that's really
a commercial for Tammy Faze new album I think that's in the next break hey um along those lines did
you know that and he is is coming out the new album Anita Bryant really yeah I just got my copy of
the uh the weekly news here and I'm reading all about it oh the weekly news does not recognize this
program this is like red china they don't recognize I know that's really terrible um I run into jack
31st a while out and about and last time with your car with your car yeah I'd like to
I ran into him a couple weeks ago and I I said hey what's going on with you and Neil leave
Neil alone he's a good guy you know he never told a great train and what did he say he says I
don't even want to talk about him he wouldn't even talk about the subject of Y and Z with me
well what did you do to him Neil really tell you one thing you get on the wrong side of one of
those wild queens and it just uh I put up her skirt or something exactly by that on the wrong side
no Anita's new album just once in a while it's called Anita with love and it's a pop gospel album and
get the it's produced by her own company in Atlanta called beta lambda corporation oh yeah right
I'm serious is that you serious boy if she only knew if she only knew I mean as long as you brought it
up I wasn't going to mention this but Anita Brian is really taffy McCallum yes I believe that
with breasts a black tape a black Anita right right yeah Anita is black didn't you know that no I
didn't I you got to do something about her and well not you your station does this I talked to her
a couple weeks ago on the phone just because well no wait a minute today's the golden chance will
the real taffy McCallum please stand up as your topic today and she actually is inviting the
audience to call in and ask her anything so you can ask her where she comes up with these boring
subjects and when she's going to get off the backs of all the minorities and when she's going
to start doing a show the thing that the thing that I would do I mean it's the thing that she would
do if I call them said anything like that well yeah that's an interesting point and on and on
and then she hang it sure something to think about you know you know if it's a play case her collar
she won't she won't get an argument with anybody yeah like you like if you said shouldn't we fry
everybody who's got the AIDS virus she would say well it's certainly something to think about
yeah exactly especially if you said fry that would really get it going yeah well back when
then Smith college we used to talk about that a lot and yeah she's such a total waste of time I
hate to say but I think I'd rather listen to the guy over on the other station but I said I
listen to hot 105 when she's on could you imagine if John Brown and Taffy McCallum had children
that would be a does it would just be discussed which he gets and test to babies probably Dr. Mangle
would have got that well listen we got a run we got an important message from Tammy fam will
see you later say hi to Jack Steady for me okay okay
okay
today when I wake up I still have all my makeup and say a lot of praise for you
finally the 10 record sets you've been waiting for Tammy Faze unbelievable new album
here's the rock I called out from under
it's all here the headache the hearted the pancake
my my
Tammy Faze here's the rock that I called out from under
