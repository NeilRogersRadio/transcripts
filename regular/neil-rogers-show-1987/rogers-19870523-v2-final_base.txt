He got up and gave me over a little card.
She sells miniature cars or something.
And autographed and a little nice message to her mother.
And then the waitress came over and Tinko.
Very nice. She Tinko said that my show was a panic.
And it was just great.
Pianic, panic.
Yeah.
That prompted neo-roger, the seldom-rightison W.I.N.Z.
talk show host, to ridicule the heralduring
is 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. radio show.
He claimed that running a Spanish language ad
insulted English-speaking readers.
Throughout the day, subscribers called the paper
to complain.
The phone has been ringing off the hook, said Jim Kurol,
the newspaper's vice president of advertising.
But he explained it was partly a mistake.
It was a mistake, all right.
Yeah, you bet.
Yeah.
Buying the paper in the first place is your first mistake.
Creative ideas advertising of Kurol Gabel's,
the desert in's ad agency, wanted to run the ad in two
of the heralds' neighbor's sections that
reached predominantly Hispanic readers.
But the herald pulled the ad because it did not contain
a disclaimer saying an English translation was available.
Do you want more?
Yeah.
OK.
The ad agency complained to assuage the agency.
Boy, there is a good word, huh?
Ooh, that's one of Daffy's favorite.
That's as in rubbing the right way.
The herald agreed to run the ad with a disclaimer
in the front section of the paper.
In other words, to pacify the agency.
I think what a lame excuse that is.
I never saw a disclaimer.
That, Kurol, says, was the mistake.
Yeah.
The herald has a policy that allows advertisers to run ads
in Spanish without a translation.
All other foreign language ads require English translations,
Kurol said.
The ad agency says it wasn't trying to offend
or discriminate against anyone.
We wanted to get the attention of the, oh, man, this is it.
Boy, a little louder this time.
Wait till you hear the last paragraph.
The last one is the killer.
OK.
Boy, I'm telling you, I wish they had their offices open today.
We could get 6,000 heralds' subscriptions
canceled in the first hour today.
We wanted to get the attention of the angloes
who would ask their Hispanic neighbors or friends,
what does this mean?
Said, Maritsa Gutierrez created ideas.
End of quote from the lame Miami herald.
I'm going to tell you folks, if you don't cancel this rag,
next week I'm never speaking to you again.
What a disgrace.
Is that incredible?
I mean, what a lame excuse, too.
See, they listened to you.
They know all about you at the herald.
I told you.
The phone was ringing off the hook.
It's too bad.
People were pissed.
All right, did I tell you my herald story?
Oh, you got one?
It's very brief.
Well, let me do the break first, OK?
All right.
We'd like to do our breaks a little early.
Why?
Because I cross them off early.
I just get, well, I get nervous, you know.
So I cross into the next couple of hours I cross them off.
And Kyle is desperate to catch up.
It's 28 before 11.
What a story.
How?
What a paper.
What a town.
What a town.
See, what is this?
Let's do a break.
We'll be right back.
Equig, here's the weather for homestead.
I think my ambition imitation.
Is there such a thing?
I get Tom Gallagher back in here to do his ambition imitation.
Many Tom can speak that low.
I like it.
And she's good.
She get rid of those matronly sweaters, though.
So before he wears the sweater that is made
of Jim Harper's burgundy sweater,
you know the man has been here for 30 years
at this radio station.
He has never taken the sweater off.
Much less cleaned it.
Now that never takes it off.
That's a true story.
Yeah.
It is true.
That's why he buys coffee at McDonald's
in the morning of the drive-through.
They won't let him go inside any place.
He just goes through the drive-through.
He does.
He buys coffee every morning.
Oh, look at this.
He wants to wear a blue one once.
Yeah, one day.
Only Gloria Brown knows when that was.
So before we get back to the story.
How you doing, Gloria?
About the restaurant.
I had one tell you my herald story quickly.
I had to call the herald last week.
Do you realize it's 21 before 11?
Already, we've almost killed his whole first hour.
And we're just getting going.
We have the warmly audience up here today.
I've been here since six, and I'm not going yet.
I'm not getting going yet.
But anyway, is that a threat?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Look at that, man.
The phones are just going crazy.
I can't imagine what's on their mind.
Here's the weather for North Mighty Beach.
Mostly cloudy.
I had to put a trot expression was weather fairy.
Go ahead.
The weather fairy.
He was dressed up as an elf during this thing before Christmas.
Oh.
And he referred to himself as the weather fairy.
And I just repeated that on the ear,
and he won't be just, will not come near this building anymore.
Boy, there used to be a character called the weather fairy.
Yeah, and Bidouche.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
No.
Who show?
Greg Bidouche.
He's to have the weather fairy.
Don't say that Jim Kelly is probably listening.
It will be very upset.
Yes, he will.
With good reason.
How do you feel, Greg, taking a guy's job after 10 years?
Yeah.
Hang your head in shame.
Jim probably is listening.
I mean, it's not like Alan Burke.
Alan was loaded anyway, right?
I mean, Jim's out there getting food stamps today.
You know, in fact, Jim gave a quote to Linda Thornton that she did use it.
Well, that's her yesterday.
That's her.
And the quote was, she's on the antifocus.
Yeah.
He's got all the gossip.
Linda asked Jim if he had any immediate plans.
And Jim told Linda that we could print in the paper.
No, Jim told Linda Thornton that his immediate plan was to get up in the morning, make
himself a cup of coffee, go down and sit in the jacuzzi and listen to the Neil Rogers
show.
Great.
I always liked what Jim Kelly was.
Yeah.
And he does listen to this show.
He absolutely loves this show.
And I did Jim's news on the air for about six, eight years.
And he's a real good guy.
And I really enjoyed working with him.
And you did Jim on the air?
No, I worked with him.
I did his news.
Oh, I see.
And stuff like that.
And I wish him all the best.
And I think he'll be fine.
Anyway.
I do.
I mean, the way you just brush a guy off like that, you know, like he was like a fly on
your noses.
I think he'll be fine.
I'm moving right along.
Yeah.
What else can I say?
We need to take up a collection.
Do something for the guy.
Boy, the way these radio stations just jerk people around and it's disgusting.
Don't buy an asteroid there.
Don't buy a hunt.
Jim, I'm glad you did.
That's the one thing they tell you when they hire you in this business.
They say they look you in the eye and they say don't buy a house.
And when the first book comes out, they look you in the eye and they say don't unpack.
You know, whatever that means.
Well, luckily Kelly's been in this business long enough to know not to buy a house.
He didn't buy one.
Anyway, look at Bill Carter.
He bought two houses.
Got more nerve than I do.
Yes, he does.
That's for sure.
I called the hair.
Bill hasn't cashed a ticket.
And so long.
I don't know if he's awake now this early.
Yeah, he's probably getting ready to go to Gulfstream.
It's raining.
And I guarantee you, Carter's getting ready to plunge his guts out today.
He hasn't cashed a ticket.
I can't remember when he can't.
I'm serious.
I cannot remember when Carter last cashed a ticket.
And I'm not joking about that either.
He is old for Gulfstream.
He keeps saying that.
Old for Gulfstream.
Yeah, for the whole meeting.
And they run like 50 days.
That's a long time.
Yeah, especially when you're there every day.
Now he's missed a couple days.
Kidding.
What happened?
I couldn't afford it.
So, anyway, notice we've almost got to the end of the hour.
We still haven't heard your hero story.
And we're not even close to the rest of the road.
The rest of the road.
That's light years away.
See, this is the kind of show I like.
These pain-and-e-ass callers, you know?
Give it a rest.
No, I know.
That is Cuban.
You know, they want to get all hysterical.
I'll get hysterical about it.
Okay.
I can get hysterical.
No, I know you're...
I happen to like a lot of the Cubans.
You're very pleased.
This is your favorite kind of show.
Favorite kind of first hour.
You bet.
I'm leaving you.
Wait till the next hour.
Yeah, I'm leaving you.
You're not going anywhere.
I got news for you.
I'm leaving.
I think it's damn time that they give me a holiday.
Let's see all the people that want to go in this day and meet a leave.
Look at that.
Six of us are so pretty.
Are you ringing?
Don't be picky.
Okay.
We can get that other broward line flashing real quick.
I'm telling you.
I'm out of here as they say in the soaps.
Why do people today?
You know, young people always come up with these ridiculous, at least to me, the ridiculous,
because I'm an old fart.
Okay.
Right.
I'm out of here.
Boy, that expression just drives me nuts.
Yeah.
And you know who started that?
Bow on the days of our lives.
Oh no.
That mong face.
He started that.
I'm out of here.
Tony, he started a year ago before anybody else was even saying it.
It's like party down.
It's another thing.
Oh, Haiti after has me nuts.
Party down.
What does that mean?
Party hearty.
That's a big talk about mindless people who will just, that's the thing that bugs me.
People are such sheep.
Some moron will come up with a ridiculous.
Oh, that's true.
It might have been Stevie Caughtin who started saying, you know, you remember Daffy doing
that show talking about Stevie Caughtin was responsible for young people saying, you know, you talk
about inanity.
I mean, that show on a scale of zero, that had to be, I'm glad you brought that up Kyle, because that, I'm telling you.
That kind of epitomized the whole Taffy McCallum show for me.
That was, that was it.
That was the frosting on the cake.
Steve Caughtin, who never even said, you know, he never said anything.
Other than hello and good bye and where's my check?
And that was about it.
Where's my 10% or whatever.
And of course, we know that all young people were just star struck by Stevie Caughtin.
You could go up and down to Broward Mall right now.
And kids would say, oh, Steve Caughtin, they would swoon, they'd fall on the floor just by the mention of the name.
And God forbid you should mention cash, ass mucin, they'd go nuts.
And you don't even know who that is.
No, I do. That's good.
Not a clue.
Are you gonna tell us?
It's a jockey.
Oh.
Who also went to England.
Okay.
He was too good looking to write in America.
They sent all the good looking jockeys to England.
I don't know how Caughtin got over there.
Well, you know, those English, they need optometrist.
Like Angie Dickinson.
The seldom reticent.
Isn't that great?
Boy, I made the Harold again today.
I'm gonna go home and write it in my diarrhea.
You ridiculed the Harold.
Yeah.
And you shame on you, Neil.
You ridiculed the prestigious Miami hero with all those Pulitzer prizes.
Sort of leads into my story about the Harold.
In fact, they're up.
Well, I don't think yet.
They're up for a Pulitzer prize for yellow journalism.
Is that great?
The Harold, the daily news and the inquire are battling it out.
See who can win the Pulitzer prize's Yellow Ribbon Award.
So while you like that cigar, I'll tell the story.
And that's what you think.
We have another break and we could do it at any moment now.
We could talk about AFMED.
We could talk about Gulfstream with Joe Neymar.
I might do this spot myself.
Hey, by the way, tomorrow is the 24th.
Tomorrow is that big jackpot day.
You know, for the Sunday.
That's right.
You're doing the drawing.
Yeah, the spring break.
I saw the ad.
It's spring break.
Something tied in with spring break.
Aren't they going to have Frankie Avalon and...
They've already done that.
Oh, they already did that.
They may be there again, but they've already done that.
That's on no interest.
No interest.
I didn't think so.
Nobody is, in fact, that was going to be the big thing that brought everybody back to Fort Lauderdale.
Now, the real reason I want to go out there today is because we ran a spot on Monday.
And I believe in truth and advertising just like the ad in the Harold.
And it said, no, really, it said,
see and bet the pre-knotes this Saturday at Gulf Stream.
So I'm taking, I've already taken all the money in the world that I've got.
I'm plunging on Ali Shee-Dee.
Ali Shee-Dee.
So...
And I made about a few perfectes with Ali Shee-Dee and bet twice.
Six-one.
Those numbers just keep running through my head.
I just keep seeing those black-eyed Susan.
I want to know a black-eyed Susan.
Susan Day, she was on the Partridge family.
Do you remember her?
Yeah, she's on LA Law now.
Yeah, she's always beat up.
You know, she's always one of those abused young women.
No, David Cassidy beat the hell out of her head.
Yeah, now she's a lawyer.
Oh, is she really?
I don't watch that.
She should.
Now that not planning to rerun, if you want to see the real sex on TV.
I hate to break the news to you.
I don't watch those network shows, okay?
But this is...
I don't watch that.
That's wrong.
Like last night I was home for just a few minutes.
I watched the hockey game in the mix.
Do you think I would leave you a sports?
I mean, I'd leave you a sports.
Trust me.
I'm macho, okay?
I'm into sports.
I watched a little bit of the hockey game.
In fact, I did see Edmonton score their first goal.
Messier scored on a breakaway.
That was great.
Right between Hextall's legs, if you pardon the expression,
man, it was great on a breakaway.
And I left the house feeling confident that Edmonton would win.
What do I know?
How would I know the game was fixed?
I mean, who else could give up five goals in the last part?
I mean, that's ridiculous.
Ludicrous, but then you're not into hockey.
You wouldn't know anything about that.
Nothing.
Zero?
Zilch.
Something about a puck.
That's all I know.
Uh-huh.
And the guy wears a...
The goalie wears a mask looks like Jason and Friday the 13th.
Exactly.
No, the goalie is Jason from Friday the 13th.
That's why he gave up five goals in the last period.
Okay, we have another break to do.
Then Glenn's maybe going to work into that story about the hero,
which I know is going to be exciting.
I'm going to reread for the benefit of the audience
at just getting up now and tuning in.
I'm going to reread several times that story
from this morning's business news section
because most people don't read the business section anyway,
unless they got money.
And that leaves our audience out.
Absolutely, Marshall Moore, that's got the people with money.
And they're so damn cheap, man.
He's got Marshall, you ought to be embarrassed.
You do a great show, but your audience doesn't appreciate you.
All they want you to do is give and give and give to them.
I've got 7,000 shares of Con Edison.
You know, who cares, lady?
Put it where the moon don't shine, baby.
We don't care about your Con Edison.
It's true, though.
There are a bunch of cheap skates at tune-units show.
That's why they got all the money.
They have the first two nickels they ever made.
They sit there rubbing them together all day.
Which is all they've got.
10 minutes before 11 at WINZ,
we're going to come back right after these important messages.
54 news wins.
You know, in all fairness, I think the ad team
should have done that spot for Gulfstream
to be instant bankroll sweepstakes being given away.
Can you hear Russ doing it now?
10,000 dollars!
Wouldn't that be great?
That would be how it would sound, wouldn't it?
Yeah.
I'm Tony.
There's a guy who has made millions.
Millions.
From what?
I mean, that's the incredible part.
And I think it's great.
He's a great American.
We used to be disc jockeys together.
Russ and I.
We used to work together on the whole lot.
Yeah, look at the difference.
Yeah, oh boy.
You're just barely eking out a meager existence.
Just barely.
And he's a meager.
He's flinging, hanging on.
And the man is a multi-millionaire.
He did us a very nice favor, though.
Yes, he did.
They've been great with us.
They've been terrific.
They did the newspaper ads for so far.
Yeah.
They've made great ads.
You bet.
They donated their services.
Super.
Absolutely terrific.
And they've worked with us and they've been great.
And I really would like to publicly thank them.
I've already thanked.
Good.
But he's got millions of dollars anyway.
True.
That's true.
In fact, he ought to be buying the ads for us.
Only kidding, Russ.
Come on.
Only kidding.
That's right.
He's got a good sense of humor.
Yeah. He doesn't like the hero too well, by the way.
He hates the hero.
He was so happy about your campaign.
He mentioned it to me.
And why is it that so many people hate the hero?
I mean, people who really have an IQ of over 10.
Right.
Keep the hero.
I mean, despise it.
True.
Oh, I mean, really, there are people who don't like the New York Times.
But they generally tend to be those right-wing lunatics.
You know, I think the Times is a communist newspaper.
OK, that's philosophy.
There are people who don't like the Washington Post for the same reason.
There are people who don't like the Chicago Tribune because it's too conservative.
But again, that has to do with philosophy.
But there are people who hate the hero just on principle.
I know.
Right?
I know.
Because the hero, once upon a time, was a lot more liberal than it is now.
I mean, now it's basically a fascist newspaper.
But once upon a time, it was a moderate newspaper.
The news was the liberal paper, indeed.
And the hero was like kind of moderate.
Like they might endorse the Nazi party.
Things like that now, they've gone way beyond that.
But there are a lot of people, philosophy aside, who just despise the hero.
Yeah, they do.
Who'd like to see Don Johnson go into, you know, one hero plans and plant a bomb, you know.
And speed off and look in the rearview mirror, like boom, you know, just the whole thing glop into the bay.
It's true.
And I found it out.
It is.
Yeah.
In fact, when we come back from the news, Glandis is going to tell us his Harold story.
I got to wait till I did the video.
Oh, yes.
Well, you know, big build up.
Hey, we have to build these numbers here.
You know, I mean, we've got to build to what about a 10 share so that she doesn't sell the station.
Only kidding, Mrs. Holly.
Well, that was great.
She came in here with that dog the other day.
Mac.
Big Mac.
Leave it to Gland to find out that they were the dog.
You know, I guess it must be all of that time that you spent as the, what was the title?
