He said, Jerry, I want to ask you to hand the ministry back to me as you promised in Palm Springs on Mark 17.
I said, Jim, assuming it was being taped or someone might be listening in and it was for the record. I said, Jim,
here's what I want to say to you.
It's number one in the nation.
All the faiths give us dollars for so many truth.
I'll show the world my smile.
It's like you would tell your view.
I'll show the world my smile.
The truth is you are my smile.
Confidence is high.
Can it be a good smile?
Kennaway to W.I. and Z. And boy, is this going to be some shum.
I'm glad I'm not going to be here tomorrow. I'll tell you that.
Mike Spindell is going to be here tomorrow. In fact, Mike was in here and the happy birthday to Mike Spindell.
The day is his birthday.
But boy, I think tomorrow he'll probably be regretted, right?
Unbelievable. Don't have a reason I say that is because I just know.
I just know for whatever reason that this weekend is going to be an unmitigated disaster.
I can feel it in my bones.
I shouldn't have known yesterday when everything fell into place and everything was working out too good.
That today would be one of those depressing morbid days.
And I want to remind you by the way that this weekend we want you to listen a lot because on Monday I think we're unplugging all the equipment.
And just we're going into a state of limbo.
We're going to bring in chubby checker to do the limbo rock here at Wins.
Boy, this business folks, I'm telling you, it's so tempting.
You know, it is so tempting to get into a big thing.
But I'm not going to do it until about 10.30.
Anyway, we've got four open hours today and I must confess I set my VCR and when I came home, surprise it didn't go off.
So I didn't see Larry King last night.
So I don't even know what the question is.
I also discover much to my astonishment that Jerry Falwell was on with head coppill last night again.
Can that be possible? Can it be true? Of course not.
But that's what I'm told.
And in the mail this morning, I'm a little disappointed.
I thought we'd be inundated. All of the station mail hasn't come in yet.
That will be in a little while.
We're bringing that with a pony from the Carroll City Post Office.
I thought we'd be inundated with $40 checks for so far for your own boon box.
But so far we haven't seen the first one.
I guess our audience just isn't into that kind of stuff, right?
They wouldn't even know what it was.
And if you look at the expression on Pat's face, it looks like he's not sure what it is either.
But that's another story.
We'll get into that later.
One of the great pieces of mail I got at home yesterday.
Wait till you hear this. Guess who this is from.
Now this will lighten up your day a little bit.
Look at the mast head.
It's from the Miami Herald.
And it's one of the...
It's one of those letters that looks like it's so personal.
But you know something?
It's the same word for word.
It's the same letter that everybody else has been sending me.
Signed, allegedly signed, it caped.
Because I do my business, of course, under my real name.
So they don't know me from Moishi Pupick.
I guess if it was Neal Rogers, they probably would not have sent the letter.
Begging me to reconsider and do a subscribe to the Herald.
Don't forget Father's Day is coming up. What is it next weekend?
Do something good for Dad.
Cancel his Herald subscription this year.
Just think the load off his back it'll take on those wet days
when the Herald is all soggy and full of 20 pounds of water.
Because the Herald delivery boys don't even twist the ends of the plastic
to keep the water out.
In fact, some days the water is the best part of the paper.
What happens when you throw that out?
Do they recycle that? Do we make them into trees again or something?
What do they do with that?
No?
Can we do it in reverse? Can we make the Herald and do pine trees?
And do something with that.
Oh, here comes a great message.
And by the way, when you call Kyle today, he is ready to just attack.
And I don't blame him.
They bury it in the landfill.
Well, we have the best informed landfill of anywhere in America.
I'll tell you that because people are throwing out the Herald left and right.
They're just going nuts.
Anyway, I did not see a Jim and Tammy on the Larry King.
I didn't see it.
So I feel like I've really been remiss.
I've really left the audience down.
And if you believe that, you'll believe almost anything.
Isn't that great? I get my own letter from Decapin.
Or that's exciting.
And then is that, is if that isn't enough?
Yesterday, when I was going to the store, it must have been about 20 to 4.
And I turned on Daffy Show and sure enough.
You know, it's always unfortunate when these things happen and they get out.
When they're not supposed to.
There's no pleasant way when somebody leaves and somebody else is coming in.
There's always got to be a little scene.
And I've always long kept my mouth shut about that business.
But here it is in the newspapers.
And then, of course, all these people are calling in yesterday.
It's all your fault. It's all at last.
The maniac that's out of the morning is disgusting.
You know, I'm responsible for everything.
Anything that you old farts don't like, I'm responsible for it.
You know, that's the amazing thing.
And to show you what a great paper the Sun Sentinel is speaking of newspapers.
Listen to this.
Page 2A in this morning's paper on that people section where they have all these wonderful little, you know,
Piazzadora. In fact, it's right under Piazzadora.
New Shock Announcer, it says.
In a move that shows the strength of shock radio, W-I-N-Z-790-AM.
I'm telling you, these people at the Sun Sentinel are so out of touch with what's going on in the real world that it's unbelievable.
Has hired sharp tongue talk host, Stan Major, and dumped issue-oriented broadcaster Taffy McCallum.
And two hours of afternoon news, the station is at tremendous success with its Neo-Rodgers talk show.
Rodgers, the premier local shock radio host, has used a mix of insults and sexual innuendos to propel him to the top ratings in Miami.
Major will broadcast from 2 to 6 p.m. daily starting June 8th following Rodgers show.
Major is controversial, he generates issues and could become an issue himself, said Mark Kuhn, W-I-N-Z's program director, end of quote.
Have we moved our spot on the dial? Has W-I-N-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z
So for all the little old bags out there that want- oh he did it first he pushed out
Kathy West and now he pushed out that thing and next he's going to push out somebody else
and that- oh he's just terrible. Like I have something to do with management we don't
even know where the hell management is much less having anything to do with him. We don't
even know- not only don't we know where they are we don't know who they are how do you
like that? Remember that saying about Nero Fiddling while Rome was burning I mean we don't
even know where the heck these people are. As a matter of fact and I don't want to get into
a big thing about this on the air but it is kind of humorous in a very sick way.
There is becoming a great similarity between the WINZ-AM sales staff and the New York
Metz pitching staff. They're all under disabled list. Of course some of them were under disabled
list before right before they left mentally disabled but that's another story. Man this
market I'm Tonya and that story about Mike McCagget's fired at hot 105 and they within the last
month or two they fired almost the whole staff over there haven't they? Of course we saw those
numbers. That station is really it's fulfilling the promise I gave for it last year not so hot
105 but it'll be okay when they change the callators to WIOR and they bring in those automation
tapes then it'll be good then Lee can start worrying he won't have that security blanket of life
hanging around his neck with that nine share. Have that wonderful music in the background the
elevator music boy that'd be great. I think that's what we need all over the dial in South Florida
the hell with all this shock radio. I mean if this is shock radio boy we're in for big trouble.
Is that buddy Nevin's is that the guy who writes that crap at the Sun Sentinel?
Is that who it is? Does anybody know? Does anybody care? Does anybody care to know? I don't.
I mean I do get the Sun Sentinel every day but only out of protest. You know what I usually do?
I pick it up in the yellow bag and I throw it in the trash. I really mean that there's nothing to
read in it there's no news. There are only ads they have a lot of ads if you're like Tanny Fave
who love this shopman you'll love the Sun Sentinel. I mean if you love Kim Arter TJ Maxx or Zairs
you'll just love the Sun Sentinel. I'm sure she got all that jewelry that she wears at TJ Maxx right?
He must be paced when you're only making you know a couple of million a year you can't afford
the real stuff she can't afford to go to mayors. I understand that Bob Mayor is involved in that
store somehow that's the only jewelry store in town where you have to sit on a phone book when
you look at the displays it's incredible. Can you imagine Bob Mayor and Mike Thompson doing a
two-man show? They'd have to get phone directories from the 10 biggest American cities to prop those
two guys up only kidding. Bob Mayor is not a bad guy as far as Thompson's concerned. What can I say?
Okay listen I don't really know what we're going to do here today because I'm just and totally I'm
tomorrow I'm going out to Calder the track is opening up I haven't seen my pass yet by the way I don't
want to start belly-icking about that but I haven't seen any pass for Calder. One thing I must say
about Calder race course is that who does public relations and publicity over there is there anybody
over there or is it kind of like our sales department I mean you can't complain about our sales
department because we don't have one right it's a true story I'm not joking we're here as a
pubic service now public radio for South Florida W.I.N.C we can get Jim Kuehlo in here from his WJR
days leave a lot of dead air he liked dead air WJR Detroit the great voice of the great lakes
was kind of like putting you into a coma and you know they were pumping out that 50,000 watts
in JP McCarthy was just making all that money and his golden tones and doing all those car
commercials it was great those were the good days when you can drive over to Biff's and go to
get a great hamburger and go over to Hazel Park and win about 7800 in a couple of hours and just
to have a great time those were the good old days this is garbage this sucks in fact I'm getting
up and leaving right now you don't know how tempting it is man you have no idea
every day is like the first day how do you feel today folks you in a good mood you want to play
the game today you want to talk or not I think I'm going to play that whole fall well tape you know
yesterday we did get three hours out of it I was joking about that but then after the show had
done done me that we managed to stretch the one four minute segment into the whole first three
hours of the show is a miracle it was a miracle from above so what we need to hear of course in
the first part of the show today is from people who did their homework last night unlike me and
again you know I'm sure every one of you who has a vcr has had it happen on more than one occasion
the problem and I have one of those that is programmable on the screen and I got that big big
screen you got to be pretty dumb not to do it right and have it go off but it just didn't fire
it was kind of like Jim Baker in that room with Jessica Hahn it just didn't fire and get home
and it's still sitting there you know it hasn't done anything it's in that impotent position and I
didn't see that and I didn't know I had no idea that couple was going to have another segment of
the soap opera I mean that's just unbelievable they are so shameless that it's it's unspeakable
look at those lines man to go and nuts do you believe it do we want to talk to them not necessarily huh
oh is that what that's about oh I don't care I'll be happy to hang up on all those people
what is that is that all of them calling right now
20 minutes past 10 at wion z let's get over with the frivolity and the light stuff and let's get
to the real show that's coming up in just a second shock radio according to the sun sentinel
stand major will be really honored to know that he is also a shock shock now here's a guy
doesn't even know who stand major is I'm sure it doesn't even know who I am or where the station is
on a dial but it's shock radio in date county 624 oh one oh the bakers were not on with king last night
see my vcr is so modern that it knows ahead of time the program content and if what you're
trying to tape doesn't come on it just doesn't move it sits there that's great technology manno's
Japanese they're unbelievable I'm telling you it's a good thing that they're not planning to attack
us again are they you saw those guys who were up here yesterday those engineering types
21 past 10 at wion z let me give those numbers again because all the lines are flashing I have no
idea why 624 oh one nine one and day 764 oh seven oh seven and brown would come right back
did you miss out last weekend
hello I'm Bob Kuviyomi publisher of outhouse magazine and this month in outhouse see the totally new
start book naked pictures of evangelist jim baker that's right we've caught Mr. ptl doing his own
kind of missionary work with a treacherous little prayer partner in a totally hot see through
french made outfit yes crystal clear black male and white photos of the sin sational encounter
that noted tamis masquerade and put her on the road to perkidan village USA
pick up your coffee now and see little jimmy in his last six commandment breaking performance
as he tries to convert his delicious disciple with a very special laying on the hands
just look for the headline it says bible from ping jim bow nails of foxie bimbo exclusively this month
in outhouse magazine 25 past 10 that sounded like the noises that Larry king makes I understand he
was upset last night but Jim and Tammy fade just couldn't handle it again Tammy was so upset after
nightline that she couldn't take one more round of it kind of like Jessica Hansen drove you know
after the first two rounds she didn't want to go to round three okay we've got several open lines
in date we had a lot of action there on the phone but not too much I don't know what they
held their doing they've all got little messages and other narsch right that they're doing
624 0191 to all our English speaking friends in date county bokeh good morning
good morning yes sir congratulations on one of the best shows I ever heard anybody do much less
your good work yesterday was in grotto yeah yesterday was a great show that's why they've all
got everybody's depressed here today it was too good you know it's a tough thing got to come back
to earth did anybody keep a master of that no god I was in the car all day I would have
taped some of it at home but listen one time I listened to Tammy after I don't know I had a little
man those three kidding yesterday yes and and she actually she she answered the questions about
why she's living with class she didn't blame you at all she said it's all a numbers game and
management realizes that provocative radio and if you're in a radio is slightly more interesting than
her you know extreme right wing yeah type stuff and she really she was calculating yesterday no I
think she is all the way around I think she's handled it it's unfortunate that you know some idiot
in the audience I don't want to mention his kid's name on the air but we do have a hit I ordered
but called her at home this is a kid who's interfering in this entire business in the market
and I'm telling you if this kid makes it to the age of 20 it'll be a miracle called her at home to
tell her that she was going to lose her job and this is why all of this has come out you know
in a very unfortunate way but in spite of that and in spite of the real mess that it's all turned
into I agree she has handled it like a lady in with class and I don't I don't how are we any
old feelings toward her at all in spite of what a lot of those callers have to say we've always
gotten along very well off the air it's just that you know philosophically I disagree and I don't
you know think basically that she's a part of what it is that we're trying to do on a station in terms
of talk but that isn't her fault you know she is what she is that's true and Stan nature is coming
in he was the first person I ever heard that got me interested in talk radio you guys are going
to be a quenella that you'll blow everybody out of the water with this if he hasn't lost what he had
he was down here what five or six years ago and then went to Philadelphia and he's quite an act
um there was a plate when you're listeners yesterday I got quite a few laughs that the same there
was going to be another telephone uh download some of the other stuff that they hadn't already sold
up at Heritage Village yeah he planterized that from David Letterman the baptismal jacuzzi and
condoms or Christ and stuff like that really you mean we've got a rip off artist in the audience yeah
really uh some of your listeners might be interested uh playboy's got to sing in the uh see the July
issue I just got it uh the world according to Jim and Tammy up excerpts uh from a lot of their books
and one thing says Tammy explains the miracle of the house trailer we prayed and asked God to give
us money to buy a trailer we took this meeting in Virginia in West Virginia a tiny church up in
the mountains God began to bless and move we started praying for the trailer and that meeting and
people put a hundred dollars with hundred dollar bills and the offering for us we were embarrassed
because we had been putting 20 and 30 ends of the bank now God was performing a miracle and giving
us the most money we've ever had in our lives the next week we purchased a 30 the most beautiful
30-foot holiday trailer trailer possible that sounds like it was the start of it you know the
yeah this is like the Fernando and I'm held a Marcus of uh televised religion you'll be pleased to
know by the way that uh somebody in the audience was kind enough to make me a t-shirt today it says
the ptl is so well great really I just think any I know I don't want to cry for a time too much
I'm sure the college got a lot to do but I think anybody who would follow you and Tammy and you
know that they're gonna be you know the the uh the people out there just you know want to with
themselves and go to a prince about it but I think they should have to register themselves as idiots
that are willing to be controlled by Charlottes oh yeah I think it's great I've got a complete turn
around on this you know I used to get very upset about it but in the case of them especially but
even the other ones even fall well and the swaggered although fall well as a lot of people have said
is really a dangerous and an astiguy but uh but as far as the bakers are concerned and swagger
you know they're incredible actors and they put on a great show and the people are suckers and
they want to be ripped off and I say more power to them if people are that stupid that even now
they're continuing to send in millions of dollars I say more power to them and it's that's what
America's all about is is the great ripoff well I think fall is biggest fear he quoted the other day
I watched his uh his news conference he said there are 518 thousand people sending in money to ptl and
I think he's afraid for his own self that uh their whole game will be shut down if he has enough
of this stays in the news long enough yeah well my way it's bad for business yes that's what I've
been saying all along it's bad for business that's why anchor bird got on there and that's why
follow gets on I mean you know when you really sit down and you listen to the things that fall
well was repeating the conversations it's it's like he it's like he's reading for the national
inquire oh really oh god follow all of us that they've got a fax machine in his office and he said
using one of our own planes you know he doesn't fight commercial and stuff like you know we're
sending people up like the old uh the old Romans and uh the people just don't seem to care yeah well
more power to them I'm off for Jim and Tammy listen have a very weakened call their blur brains up
to bring them a couple winners okay okay thanks a lot man is called into inform us that the nightline

offend you by the language they use only 12 percent said yes 84 percent said no

subject offensive than men according to their survey of a thousand fourteen interviews all over

to Alex yesterday really and I he used the word tinkling he was talking about somebody had called
to uh to compliment him yeah and he was talking to Mike Thompson he goes oh yeah the guy just went on
he was just tinkling all over me now I realized that that's not anything that you have copy right
either anything but that's that's sort of identifiable with Neil Roger yeah that kid hasn't got
an original thought in his brain yeah yeah yeah he was doing the thing about the tidie bull man
the day before yeah yeah yeah I don't think you should rip them on merciful and of course this
afternoon he's doing something very original between five and seven I'm delighted he's doing it
better him than us he's doing a dating show between five and seven every Friday yeah that's a brand
new concept huh somebody also called in to say that Mike Thompson repeated the polish joke that I
told on the air yesterday I'm not surprised I'm not surprised no writtenality over there what so
none whatsoever and uh lee had an interesting uh show on this morning I'd listen to it for about five
minutes you have a choice of it would you rather shoot your father your mother your kid or something like
oh that's good oh yeah it was it was charming it was something about who do you want to let out
I want to say good morning to Mike Thompson by the way Mike's a big fan of this show well he does
put a screen over the speaker in the radio though so he won't catch anything when he listen to this
program yeah yeah how many phone books you sitting on this morning baby 23 before 11 at

was it guy at nine o'clock on snooze Jerry witchner Jerry witchner okay uh I was trying to get
away from the ball game on my way home last night uh and looking around the dial and I heard him
talking so I stopped and listened for a second and at exactly nine sixteen e a said you're a
large pile of blubber then mumble something about uh he can handle the criticism but he would like
the opportunity to take his fish shove it down your throat grab you by the ass and turn you inside out
I thought you would like to know that that was at nine seventeen he made that last day I want to
tell you something right now if you took away the three fifty seven magnum from Jerry witchner he
is the biggest wimp that ever stepped foot on the face of this earth okay I'm sure uh but I
I thought you would like to know the kind of thing in addition to which I have no idea what that's
in response to other than his general you know run of the mill redneck mentality I don't know
what he's talking about I don't need has he flipped his wig or what he was mumbling something about
you ripping him on the radio and that uh he then said you know you were nothing but a big pile of
blubber and this is last statement at nine seventeen I looked at the clock in the car and I went I
got to make a record of this in my mind so I can tell Neil tomorrow that was the last part about
your new inside out I was a star girl I said yeah he could do that like I can fly without wings yeah
but uh I felt well you know that's that macho you know that wonderful redneck macho mentality I
want to get him in a bar and you know uh turn him inside out and put his footwear his mouth
there's and all that other good stuff you know that's terrific talk Jerry does he carry a piece of that
of course are you serious oh okay well that's his phallic symbol you bet wonderful well you you let
it you let him you let him come for you when he gets within twelve feet I'll take the gun away and
then you can have him okay okay good luck to you all you got to do is pull Jerry's wig off boy and

less than spectacular yesterday did we just fell into it I'll confess that I'm not taking any credit
for anything that happened yesterday except good luck and we just fell into it everything fell
into place we had a great show yesterday so I should have known that today we're just going to be
kind of like four hours of discontent Miami hello hey new yes number one I won't take any
shots of camping happy okay I can barely hear you are you whispering is this yes basically okay I won't
take any shots at daddy because I'm just happy that she's not going to be there I agreed with a lot

series of assaults on four altar boys at a West suburban Cicero Church he molested boys in his
home after promising to show them his collection of baseball cards unbelievable police began investigations
after a teacher saw one of the young victims draw a picture of a man and a boy having sex
Cris used his position as an unpaid lay minister to be friend altar boys can you say lay minister
on the air I don't think so I'd be real cautious about that the New York Daily News reports that
Randall ring 19 a coach at a parochial boys basketball team and a state parole officer was charged
with satanizing a 13-year-old member of the basketball team in Queens it's 14 before 11 at
W.I.N.Z. and let's go to Del Rey hello hi I was gonna say after I think that priest was quoted
as saying after the baseball card trick came through for him I think he said that Bayza Ball has
been very good to me but I wanted to did you did you happen to kiss this morning Jesse Jackson was on
oh no that would have ruined my whole day are you cereal what does he want Jesse Jackson was on
filled on he's a small what does he hope to be he hopes to be president yeah maybe president
or at the very least a near-do well I well he's already that he he's pathetic but he's the front
runner so I don't know what you can say about it but I thought you might have had your VCR set for
that it was pretty tragic no my VCR knows now I understand it's got a brain of memory and I never
realized that till this moment but now it knows when Jesse comes on it immediately has a shutoff
machinery with common sense yeah it's got a chip in there the other day I was flipping around on
the stations and I turned on the 700 Club and there's old smiling Pat Robertson and guess who the
newest addition is to that memory of of religion Susan Howard the girl that played Donna Crabbs
on Dallas who got asked I never watched the show she she was the one of the the headline ladies on
there and she got taken off the show at the end of the season and now she's doing the 700 Club
that's not a big change Dallas to the 700 Club I think you know in line of all the things that
happen in religion yeah what I did write in together you ought to well this you'll find this
interesting did you you you don't ever listen to co-cell do you are now never did you hear that
moon beam who he picked for the competition for in the in the next race was a week from tomorrow the
no the bell ma'am sorry goch and what is it havy's comment or havy's copy havy's copy
mm-hmm those are the two horses he likes you think he's out on the limb there or do you know well
I mean that that really takes a lot of brilliance they both won in New Jersey last you know a couple
of days ago last Sunday or whatever day it was you know and I guess New Jersey is close enough
to New York that anybody who wins in New York has got to win the bell ma'am you know what I'm saying
that's right well you are to trust me plunge your brains out on Leo Castilly with Santos you know
after I have to compliment your house they show I'll tell you something I didn't you know I used to
listen to another station who used to rip you apart all the time which one is in there is another
station well there was and I always used to you know like an idiot dislike you without over having
listened to you well since you come on days I started listening to you and I found myself to
to become a hardcore Neil Rogers fan hardcore huh hardcore especially after you think you
ought to get pet boo next time you go out to a park and you can sell box lunches I'm going to tell
you I'm going to tell you what I want to do all right but I'm not going to wait all of this would
be unfair what I'm going to do is the people who've already if anybody did send in their $40 check
right I mean this may open up a real Pandora's box anybody sent the $40 check what we'll do is
we'll wait because we've ordered a hundred copies of the penthouse of the hustler from January 84
and what we'll do is we'll wait till they come in and we'll send them a virgin copy okay because
we want to be fair to them if you pardon that expression but anybody else because I'm in such a
foul mood today not really it's just a strange day anybody else who wants their own boon box
just had to sustain self-adressed envelopals and you a copy free you don't even need to send a
donation to so far how's that for generosity that's that's that's that's we can put this guy in a
map listen have fun at the track tomorrow okay see you later in fact in one of the pictures I hear
that Pat is wearing Jerry Wichner's wig and you ought to see where he's wearing it unbelievable
so if you want a free copy okay we want to bring Pat back we want to put him on the map he hasn't
had a hit in so many years that it's enough to make you want to cry
some day we hope to quietly tell our story a story of two centers saved by grace
I have never been to a prostitute and I am not or had ever been a homosexual
when I cry each time I saw the time take our love from the side okay all you got to do is send me a
stand self-adressed envelope now those if you have sent the forty bucks probably nobody did right
you think so we'll find out in about ten minutes when the mail comes in but we don't want to be on the
fair so we'll send the people who make the donations the virgin copies because there is a big
difference between the actual copies out of the magazine I mean you can you can count the pubic
hairs on that picture almost and of course the copy isn't quite as graphic I guess although you
unless unless you're just oblivious it's pretty easy to see what's in the box but anyway if you
like your own boom box just send your stamps out of the rest envelope to boom box
care of neo-rodgers w-i-n-z
Miami we could be opening up a Pandora's box with this huh Monday the mail may come pouring in here
that's boom box care of neo-rodgers w-i-n-z Miami 33055 be the first what in your neighborhood
with your very own personal pat boom box colder pass just a little hint every year I have to do that
I don't know why it's embarrassing isn't it of course those of us in this business we have no shame

good morning Neil hi I I have a point of information if you're interested I just found out that
that Miami Herald has a special rate which is half of the amount that people pay for their
subscription and if you want the number and the address we had ascended the people who are still
subscribing will pay half of what they normally pay for the year are you interested no I don't
want to promote people I don't care what the rate is I want to make a castle they would be losing
half the amount of money than Miami Herald and I thought that maybe oh I see some of the words when
they read if they send it to this particular address they will pay half of what they normally
pay for the year why is that I don't understand it it seems that if this is a secret and no one
is supposed to know about it and being they I happen to call up and wanted to know why they were
selling it for half price on the street with the new subscription they said that they had this but
they did not advertise it to a regular subscribers oh if you are well listen go ahead I mean more
power to you it's the Miami Herald yeah host office box 599 fourth lordedale
the zip is 3 3 3 0 2 and the next bill if they send 53 dollars and 30 cents for the year they will
be saving half price and they will be losing half of what they normally get because it's over
$106 a year and normally every three months if you pay every three months so they will be losing
half of their profits and I thought it would be interesting being they had that terrible article
in the page that's Pio box 599 right 440 now 3 3 3 0 2 3 3 0 2 right have the amount to be sent
with the next subscription bill is 53 dollars and 30 cents for the year okay thank you

out here was the boat show weekend and this is to do with the Miami-Herald and very in depth
research department yeah they had a full page a full color page in a special edition for the
boat show and it showed a knot that every boater is supposed to be able to know how to tag called a
bowler knot the knot was tagged incorrectly oh wait a minute does that have to do with a bullet
amendment not quite but I just couldn't believe that any major person would print a full color page
of a knot that everybody's supposed to know how to tag and just now I understand why
Oli North said knots to you when they asked to testify that's all Neil thanks a lot
sir hang in there
hey guy you got to testify in front of an angry Senate subcommittee and that can really make
use wet so you need the cologne especially formulated to cover that distinctive stench of guilt
your testifying but your car lying your wearing Oli splash it on Oli the covert cologne name for
the guy who started it all I'm Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North and there's nothing I'd rather do
than tell you how great my new cologne is but I must regretfully and respectfully decline to
comment on advice of my attorney
this time divert your funds and take the fifth of Oli new from cover up cosmetics

he keeps scratching behind himself mm-hmm well maybe that's for customers or flies or I don't know what
but he asked me if I wanted a t shirt I said no I can't yeah well the rumor is the herald is

bleed it bleed it out of them come on squeeze it out of them like getting blood out of a turnip
lake worth hello hello Neil how you doing all right I got a couple of questions actually one question
one comment I used to work at a you a VHF station in Miami that used to do independent programming I'm
not going to mention channel six okay and we used to broadcast Jim Baker's early morning
Sunday show that was an hour in front of a live audience yeah and there was absolutely no glitch
whatsoever so I wanted to know when he was born again into show business because I have seen
him recently just before this well he had a consultant oh yeah oh yeah that's interesting the same
guy who consulted our FM and if you believe that the guy did a better job with your FM you'll
believe anything now what are you talking about they've really they've put showmanship back into
a television and I think Tammy they have 40 share regular workouts with her tear ducts they got a
40 share on nightline two nights ago and the other comment I had the other thing I had to do
was a comment I run in my neighborhood up here which is a big residential area full of old deserted
houses and often people drive around looking for some place and they never seem to find it so I'm
always stopped for directions so I was running down this street and this car blows past me starts
talking on his horns stops the guy jumps out and stands in my path so I had to stop and so you
know I'm expecting somebody was lost and they needed directions because that happens to me all the time
yeah was very which I mean I've got some good news for you did you know that Jesus loves you
I couldn't believe it I almost I almost gave him a free past meet as maker I'll tell you
oh that's incredible here I was you know after running the car he wanted to share don't you
just need wanted to share the good news with you sir yeah I guess I looked like I needed religion
like those priests that wanted to share the good news with the altar boys oh god that's good
they were saying must have been my shorts I don't know yeah but I wanted to tell you that story Neil
okay well listen good luck to you all right thanks we'll see you we have a
brauer just to die that was it that cleaned out brauer completely 764 0707 see I got a false
sense of security yesterday I told you that but I didn't know it at the beginning of the show
today I know it was going to be tough got the day off tomorrow and they're not going to they're
not going to be easy to come by today 764 0707 if there's anybody alive in the brown and of course
that's been something we've been investigating for a long time by the way somebody called about this
picture and they did a lot of investigation in the hustler before they printed this because they
could have been sued for millions okay and this is already like three years ago so there is no
question but somebody suggested we were whistling in the dark with this
you know that Pat Boone this is a true story he did the whistling on this on this record
yeah
too much lip balm I think 1130 and WNYNZ and let's go to Miami Beach hello hello my
idea yes sir yeah I'd like to ask you a question sir you might have I changed the subject yes
uh where we going next we got a caller on a mobile phone hello good afternoon
well I answered his question didn't I
me all want to ask you what happened to Duffy what do you mean what happened to her
yes she was crying she said she's leaving no she wasn't crying one of the callers was crying
well the callers and they're all blaming you yeah you're the bad guys I'm all everything that
happens if they don't like I'm responsible for when it rains and it floods the backyard I'm
responsible for to thank God you're tall because everybody blames you everybody how it was on you
yeah I'm believable all right take care okay sir well that was pretty profound wasn't
man I'm telling you we're not going for quantity today we're going for quality we're not getting it
but we're going for it Miami hello how you doing all right uh where are you reading this from this
uh all this pre-story here uh the pre-stories is from the May 1987 issue of free thought today
which comes from the freedom from religion foundation and Madison Wisconsin and each of these
stories comes it's got the date and the source so it's not you know they couldn't just be making
these up like the USA today Orange County Register it's got the date and the source of each story
is there's an address there I can send for this sure let me find it for you of course you
probably have to cough up a couple of bucks that's all right I think it's worth it okay freedom from
religion foundation the name of the paper is free thought today okay yeah and the organization
is called the Freedom from Religion Foundation P.O. Box 750 Madison Wisconsin
okay and the zip code is 53701 all right okay and the subscription price is 15 bucks a year I
think it comes out every month I guess I called you a couple days ago about the educational horse race show
yeah yeah I'm gonna head out to Calvary tomorrow anyways and take a shot at it hopefully I got lucky
well I think you get out there early I was thinking about that it would be almost impossible to do
it on the air because you have to start from scratch the best thing to do is get there early and you
got to buy a program and a racing form get the daily racing form and in the racing form there are
a couple of pages and it's very tedious and ponderous but it explains how to read the form okay and
it explains what all the symbols are and it shows you the last 10 races of each horse and it's
going to take a while but you know you just don't want to go out there naked so to speak but surely
huh what's really then about noon or quarter to 12 first races at one all right okay see you
here good luck probably go out there with a $20,000 try that's how it is man a beginner's luck you know
oh look at the colors on that one what that looks great and that's a way to do it to hell with all
this handy capping still know Miami news you think it's in a building probably out in the parking lot
it kind of sits there for hours they just combine they throw it on the other side of the gate
and then he just fly out of here I think the delivery guy from the Miami news doesn't like our
neighborhood or something we have an open line in day 624-01-91 it's 27 till noon at WINZ and we'll
come back when Z Miami Beach hello hello hello hello yeah I want to mention to you that I think
that you're making a mistake in promoting the local delivery of the hurled in that at any price

building up circulation and they're building up their rates and their income good thinking all right

rid of hulio and all three to five shot in every race right who needs that water hill hello hi
Neil hi how you doing okay i just have a question about the heralds advertisement in the way
that they get people to subscribe to their newspaper i recently moved to the area and on five
different occasions at night because i worked during the day i had been called by different people
saying that we should subscribe to the hero and after the first phone call they gave me the
whole mania as of how much it would cost if i just ordered it on the weekends if i just
ordered on the weekdays and the whole package thing i said no i'm not interested um they then a
couple days later called again then later they called again i got my husband and we just kept saying no
no no yeah by the way before you go on there's a bill in the florida legislator that would outlaw
all this telephone solicitation really and i sure hope it passes yeah because it's gets quite
annoying and even on your day off like saturday well you know what you should do and maybe you've
tried it you should tell them i've already had a call and the answer is no and make a notation
somewhere don't call us again oh that's a good idea i'm serious because they just keep
pounding you until yeah do they work on commission and set how the phone people i would think so
yeah i think they get a slice of every subscription that they sign up oh i didn't know that i
i maybe not i don't know maybe they work by the hour i have no idea i'm curious also another
thing about the baker situation yeah um yesterday with everything that had settled down and tv
news and showing what had happened on nightline in the whole nine yard and i think i saw a little
blurb last night around on the six o'clock news where far well with saying now you know that if i
were going to make these allegations again spaker that i have something to stand behind it
he is smooth he's highly polished i'm even afraid of having him i mean being charged with a ppl
you know i think he's like now i want all the million dollars you know i'm saying don't you
don't you get a weird feeling about i tell you one thing i always when i see him talking or get
the feeling there's four pounds of johnson wax on his tongue that's how slick he is slick
glib and disgusting he's revolting he's very in control yeah i mean just every but he's going to
lose this one because most of the people dislike him already see in his his whole stick you know it's
nickels and dimes compared to the ppl they've got so many millions of viewers because they're on so
many more stations with that satellite so he's just uh small potatoes compared to them and of course
now they've really played it to the hilt and uh Tammy has been declared uh you know saying under
the baker act or something and uh you just watched they're going to come back bigger and better
hey say one question how did this all come to be i mean the board had to know how much money the
baker's from because they were all taking these gigantic salaries too if you were working for a
company and the chairman of the board was paying you three hundred and fifty thousand a year for
doing almost nothing you would vote to say hey let's pay him five million year keeping here for
life you know wouldn't you yeah but who pulled the whistle i mean who was investigating all this and
made it come to be known you know well the newspaper up in charlatte was the one that really
opened up all of this about their condo in florida and their home mansion in palm springs and about
the uh Jessica hunt thing it's been the charlatte newspaper of all places that really opened it
all up wide so to speak at the hero i'm sure no okay thanks a lot okay take care
by the way i would like to advise you that if there's any doubt what is it that catholic swears
of the same Christopher metal around their necks ones who don't work across because uh there's a
picture and there are two pages to this thing in hustler and in the first one here is a picture of
that wearing his um v mi v mi his uh sweat sweater or whatever the hell it is in fact he looks like
he's sweating in it and around his neck you can see part of his same Christopher's metal and in
the other picture where he's flashing in the uh carton flashing in the box uh you can see the same
there's no question about it i mean not that there's any question to begin with i mean you just
look at him and you know it's pat depending on how well you know him of course but uh it's
incredible it's so if you want to be the first in your neighborhood to have your own boon box
just write a stamp self-adreced envelope to boon box and we'll send you a copy of both pages
from the hustler article boon box care of neal rogers wynz mi mi mi three three oh five five
and uh this puts the herald the shame trust me summer is here and if you're looking at your shoe
or drob at the record at corder at the gallstream he had four winners in a row not on the same day but
his four consecutive winners he was disqualified and all four of them unbelievable so obviously he's
sitting it out and uh her burdo castillo is going to be writing perfect parade in the eighth
who might be a little bit of a price he was running in cheap claimers and now had that monster
win on the grass in a twenty five thousand dollar allowance race last time out only to be disqualified
in place for it so they really got to be looking for revenge tomorrow okay
i'm not i'm just going to stop at that point i don't want to get carried away here with that racing
form we have an open line in the for in the first race in date county six two four
oh one nine one corral springs hello neal hi how you doing okay how are you are you really in corral
springs of corral springs incredible my neighbors are cows
oh i'm not touching that line i'm serious real cows anyway uh two things yesterday i called
channel seven the brown word number yeah guy wouldn't talk to me he they took my name and number they
you know they played around with me for about five minutes then he took my name and number and he
never called back to complain about mark Wagner yeah i just wanted you to i have a feeling they
probably got a couple of calls yeah well they they he never called me back uh another thing i was
raised Catholic um Catholic boarding schools the whole nine yards and um you know i i guess i
believe the basic tenets of the religion but i i saw the same thing you know with um the
nuns and the priest um at boarding school my parents paid a lot of money to send me there and we got
um reds and pastries and stuff that were you know off the shelf some stores that were donated
from bakeries yeah and the nuns ate you know the finest and my aunt i'm you know i'm talking about
money and religion sort of um bequoting it to what's going on with the pt all in all now my
works for a bunch of priests um in Pittsburgh and they eat i mean literally drive you know
Mercedes and Lincoln and eat the finest i mean finest food available that you and i couldn't afford
so i guess it's the same you know with every religion yeah well maybe that's why it's good that
all this other stuff is coming out now to show the hypocrisy it's all such garbage i think you
know they could help the poor that are so needy yeah more than eat flamenian and see that's a
one thing copper lacrosse who just totally went out there then i didn't ask jim and tami would have
been the perfect question uh when he kept saying well you know the board insisted on paying us all
this money i would ask him well you know with all these people who are starving to death on the streets
all these street people and all these people who are desperate and starving how in good conscience
can you take you know uh two million dollars a more a year what the hell are you people thinking about
that's a good conscience yeah okay all right thanks me all i'll see you in church okay bye bye

I said what he upset about.
I said what did your priest teach you?
And you're not going to believe what he said.
First you get down on your knees,
and that's all he said.
It's 12 minutes past noon at WINC
and let's go to North Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hi Neil.
Hello.
I'm one of those despicable telephone solicitors.
Oh.
Don't ever hang up on those people.
Let me tell you how to do it.
String them along.
Just keep saying, uh-huh, uh-huh,
make them go through the whole pitch,
ask them all kinds of questions,
and then say no.
Telephone solicitation is a numbers game.
If you're sitting in an office,
say there's 100 women sitting in an office,
and they're mostly women,
and they're making phone calls.
If you say no and hang up,
we're glad,
because we didn't go through the pitch.
We didn't have to tell you everything.
Tell Kate, we're not going to turn that guy around.
But as long as you stay on the phone,
you take up our time,
take up the telephone time,
which forced money,
and then at the end,
when you've exhausted every avenue,
you just say,
well, gee, I don't think so.
Another thing a telephone solicitor hates,
is a person that seriously hangs up,
and you're pitching a dead phone.
Don't ever hang up on them.
If everybody in the United States did this,
can you imagine the money
that you would have to spend on watch lines?
And on pay,
and they get no sales out of this?
Never thought about that.
Oh, gee, just keep them on the line.
Keep talking to them.
Keep on it.
It any hang up,
and they say, on it,
SLB, I couldn't turn him around.
Yeah.
And all in, he was interested,
and I couldn't turn him around.
But, you know,
just at the bottom line,
just say,
no, I don't think I want that.
Okay.
Okay.
Good, good, good, good.
You guys worked.
Believe me, I've been doing this for about two years.
Only because I have a bad eyesight,
and I'm 65 years old,
and I can't get a real job, you know?
But, uh...
Me too.
That's my problem.
Yeah, I know.
Well, okay, do that,
and you'll drive them nuts.
Don't hang up on them, okay?
I have them crazy.
See you later.
All right, bye-bye.
1214,
at WINZ,
we have an open line in Broward,
764,
07,
07.
You think I want to try that one more time,
see if we can't stop that in the right place.
First you get down on your knees,
fiddle with your...
Okay, let's take our next call in Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
Just wanted to make a comment,
talking about the homosexual acts
with the priest and the quiet boys.
I think there's something going on between North
and the President.
I'll tell you why.
I know if you heard of the other day,
the hearings,
they had something when they were questioning this,
and Rico Rodriguez,
and they were watching something,
and Rico Rodriguez related to the committee,
says that I'll ignore past comment.
He says,
Well, they can't touch me
because the old man loves my ass.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Is that great, yeah?
Yeah, so I thought I'd just pass if you didn't hear that.
Well, I always had the feeling that Ronnie knew
something that the rest of us didn't.
Unbelieveable.
I'll enjoy your show.
Bless you, sir.
Okay, thank you.
Have a good weekend.
Now, Colonel North, let me try and get this straight.
All right, Senator.
Your testimony is that Bob McFarlane had a plan
to get some contra-a.
Is that that is correct, sir?
He'd sell our weapons to Iran to get that contra-a.
With a plain load here,
and a plain load there.
Here alone, there alone.
Everywhere a plain load.
That's right, Bob McFarlane had a plan
to get some contra-a.
So, oh, McFarlane has that plot
to get that contra-dose.
Yes, but when the going got too hot,
he couldn't take no more.
About the on-hand and the valium-fair.
Here appear.
Better be here.
Over the way to down.
Bob McFarlane had the plans to get some contra-a.
Yes, I'll see.
Well, thank you for clearing this matter off.
Colonel North.
Thank you, Senator.
And I would advise your count.
So, although before any further testimony is heard,
you have that being assumed.
Yes, sir.
Of course.
16 past noon at W.I.N.Z.
We'll go to Deerfield, next.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
I'm the fellow that called you a couple of weeks ago
when you were doing a job on Century Village,
and you were used to censorship power,
and you cut me off.
But that's not the reason why I'm calling.
I'm a call to paper,
and I'd like to tell you a little horror story.
Can I tell it to you?
Well, if it's not too long.
No, it will take a short time.
This fellow bought a claim of $5,000.
Yeah.
And he wanted to see the horror story board,
so he went to the behind to the stable.
And he went to the stable where the horse was,
and he looks in, and the horse is lying down on the floor flat,
and the vet-
With Pat Boone.
Go ahead.
You'll hurry that?
No.
And the vet was working on the horse.
Well, the fellow said to the Jesus Aitake,
he said, houses health.
Doctor says he's flying.
The fellow says, do you think I could race him tomorrow?
Doctor says, yeah, in fact, I think he'll beat him.
And that's the story.
Quiet.
On, but well, that's when it has to sink in.
It has to sink in?
Yeah, that's good.
Okay, I'm glad you like it.
You redeem yourself.
Did I?
Yeah.
Okay, we're friends.
We'll see you tomorrow at Cody.
You're going to go tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll be there Sunday also.
Excellent.
Well, if I win tomorrow, I'm going Sunday.
I'm going to plunge millions on Sunday.
Oh, my God.
This will be able to buy a Rolls-Royce.
Our own track.
Okay.
See you tomorrow.
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
That is good.
See, the more you think about that, but it's not one of those that hits you immediately.
Twelve, it's like some of the horses that I've been at Coder.
They don't hit the finish line immediately.
It's like about five minutes later,
when the other horses are going into the paddock for the next race.
Twelve, eighteen, a W-I-N-Z.
We got a little break to do here.
Right, boy, this is a busy hour, man, for a lunch hour.
This is almost unbelievable.
Shock, shock.
Isn't that incredible?
I've been here for 11 years.
And the only shock that I ever got was when I stepped on the carpeting in the other studio and sat down.
Then, of course, I got a shock when I came in here and daffy had the chair wired, but that was another story.
Miami Beach.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I sent you a check for so far.
Yeah.
And I am close to note about our baton ratings.
I don't know if you got it.
Yes, thank you, all the way around.
Yeah.
The thing I wanted to tell you, I sent you a very cheap cassette tape I found out.
Yeah.
Going to matter?
No.
Oh, it'll work well.
Yeah.
Oh, that's good.
When did you send that?
Because I remember when I got it.
Oh, dear.
It must be a week, ten days ago.
Okay.
Because Marlon Bailey from Superstar Productions keeps dubbing these for us.
And I don't know when he's coming in again, but as soon as he comes in and gets the next batch,
we'll get it right out to you.
Oh, great.
I'm looking forward to that.
Good.
And I'm going to participate in the arbitrarne ratings in about three weeks from now.
Incredible.
Well, we can't discuss it on the air, but...
No.
I've never known anybody that was involved with it, so I'm really happy about that.
So, sooner or later, each one of us has our day.
Yeah, every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
Every day.
But we all find that nobody is supposed to clarify, because probably not everyone makes decision.
It's never fair to treat a soldier.
It was enclosed in this morning alone.
And it only exists now.
But let's do that.
That's called knocks out by the military intelligence press.
We Alto's another project for over 5.
night, May 17th.
Two months had passed.
He said, Jerry, I want to ask you to hand the ministry back to me, as you promised in
Palm Springs on March 17th.
I said, Jim, assuming it was being taped or someone might be listening in and it was
for the record.
I said, Jim, here's what I want to say to you.
Is that answer your question, sir?
I think so.
Neal, are you going to do anything for the, since it's a Constitution's birthday?
Are you going to do anything special for it?
I'm going to pray for it a lot.
Okay.
Well, you came up to good work and I really enjoy your show.
Thank you.
Have a great show.
Okay.
Good luck to you, sir.
Have a great life.
Take care of yourselves.
Okay.
Twenty four minutes passed 12 at WINZ.
We have two open lines again in Dave County.
Dave seems to be the one where we have a constant problem.
You know what the problem is?
No say, Obla, English, Aki.
That's the problem.
Six, two, four, 0191.
Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neal?
Yes, sir.
Great show.
I'll buy a tie.
You know, ever since I started listening to the daytime, your real bad influence on me.
I'm late to my appointments all the time.
Yeah.
Fitting the car, bus, and the gut.
That's what many of the priest have said to him about him.
I'm bad influence on him.
But I got a question for you.
Yeah.
Does I looked it up in the dictionary and I can't find it for the life of me.
What the hell?
I'm sorry, that's what I was saying.
What is a suit?
A suit?
Yeah.
Are you serious?
You can't find it.
I gave you an out of spell it.
PSED.
PSED.
Well, PSED.
EUD.
Yes, he helps if you know how to spell it when you look it up in the dictionary.
I'm not trying to wonder.
Wait a minute.
Let me get my dictionary, okay?
Wait a second.
I got to tell you these evangelists are getting their due though.
Now it's great.
I'm sure that suit is in my dictionary because this is a suit dictionary.
So obviously, what'd be in here?
I got another one for you.
You'll look that one up.
Here's prosthetically.
Mung, what the hell is Mung?
Mung?
Well, Mung is just a word that Bill Calder made up years ago and I ran with it.
So he comes up with a material and I use it.
No, it just means like a mess, like a junk, like something unmanshable.
Oh, okay.
I follow you on that one.
Well all I can tell you is suit is short for pseudo intellectual.
Oh, is that one in the same?
Yeah.
Okay.
It's funny because you'd be surprised when people listen to your show.
Now, it wasn't a health club the other day working out and these guys are watching me.
I was getting a little nervous.
I said, what are you two suits looking at?
A third guy in the club.
This is what it suit me.
So I had to just wing it and we were talking about you showing it at Fred Chapsa.
They were getting a big kick out of it.
You'd be surprised how many people in the what I call the perfect demographic.
Well, I thought, wait a minute.
30s upper middle income.
I found it.
I found it.
Suit or pseudo falls spurious.
As in Steve Spurrier, remember him used to go quarterback for Tampa Bay for the 49ers.
Okay.
Good.
Well, at least I find out how I spell it.
Well, this is a high level show, sir.
You learn something on this show every day.
That's why I'll list the hell is no more.
Okay.
The stand major coming on your show are the other one on this station.
Station of the other one on this one on this one because the paper was I looked at it before coffee and I said, wait a minute.
Something's wrong here.
Yeah, they just can't they just can't find us on the dial.
I'm going to but it sure radio station.
They's coming back.
Yeah.
Because he was the one that got me into talk radio when we were having that Mary L problem here.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He loved to get him.
Get him right.
He's ready.
Hey, good luck.
Neil.
Hey, great show.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Jerry Fallwell and Jim Morrison.
Man, could you see the religious institution that they could build?
By the way, what happened with Marlon and that Elvis picture we were supposed to get today?
Is he called us at all today?
No.
Maybe.
Kyler is in a state of suspended animation.
He is not speaking.
He's about to write one of his caustic messages on the screen.
It's going to be really good.
Do you really?
Oh, I see.
Where are we going next?
Let's go to Tamarack Hello.
How you doing?
Let me ask you something.
I missed that as far as what you said about the Catholic Church and I called you a producer to stream.
You might be able to get me a little idea.
It is basically about the sexual abuse charges that have been going on for centuries.
Yeah.
Nothing new.
Well, that's basically true, but at the same time once you really look at the facts that the program goes to.
Are you friends of the program or school system in this case?
What do you mean am I referring to it?
I'm referring to the Church or...
Well, that's not only the Catholics, but they seem to have a big slice of the pie, so to speak.
I got a big slice of the pie, but for the other end of the stick is when people graduate out of broke-years,
go to a school where it's elementary or high school, those people know how to speak English.
They know how to write, they know how to add.
They know how to do a variety of things.
Yeah, there's no question about that.
They know how to do a variety of things.
That's for sure.
Well, that is true, but you look compared to your average school in New York City and now way ahead of the other kids.
I mean, something because of the discipline and the more rigorous education, you know, that's what I'm saying.
So if a few thousand get molested along the way, you know we shouldn't worry about that.
Well, let's put it this way.
I hate to think of how many children have been molested in the English educational system.
This is an all-male institution.
They don't integrate the sexist.
Yeah, well we don't live there.
Yeah, I know.
Well, that's basically the truth.
But you know, let's face it.
No, I don't think it's basically the truth.
I don't think that's the truth.
I don't think that's the truth.
I don't think that's the truth.
I don't think that's the truth.
I don't think that's the truth.
I don't think that's the truth.
Yeah.
So naturally we shouldn't tell you.
You know, I think they need to be given a hand.
By the way, do you hear that the Pope has requested or everyone is being requested to spend $10
was in dollars or Houston.
So the Pope can be paid $2 million to come there.
Oh, I got a great story for you, by the way, out of California.
I think it's in Monterey.
I'm going to have to find it just a second here.
Maybe you can whistle Dixie or say a few hail marries or something while I'm leafing through here.
There is a great story, not that great of a story.
In fact, it's not even a big deal.
But it just came to mind.
It's somewhere in here.
It's in Monterey.
Well, I wanted to ask you something.
It's true.
What I heard that Patron had appeared nude in Hustler with his genitals in a box.
Correct.
I have it right in my hand, sir.
It's not in the picture that it is.
Is it where they filled in the parts so they did something like that?
No, they didn't fill in the parts.
What kind of an idiot did he do?
Why would he do something like that?
Well, first of all, he was like, I don't know, 18 or 19 years old when he did this.
This was 20, whatever.
He was a young kid.
Oh, this goes back a long time.
Yeah, and this was not something that anybody was supposed to get their hands on if you pardon that expression.
Oh, God almighty.
And that's what a...
That's what a lot of us said when we saw the picture, oh, God almighty.
What a disappointment.
I cannot find that article.
Anyway, it had to do with the fact that they wanted to exploit the Pope's trip to...
It was Monterey or somewhere in California.
And that somebody out there, the Archdiocese, had asked to commercialize,
to charge the media out there for coverage in order to raise the two million that they need out there.
And the networks and the other media people got very upset so we don't pay for the news.
Why don't you...
Why don't we really expose the fact now that he should pay for his own thing,
but also expose the Vegas Pound and then well known that he...
This Pope has been directly involved in the death of the Priopope and he was placed in that position more or less.
And the other Pope, I think John Apollo, whatever his name was in 78,
they quickly informed him away and they...
And they're bombed as body without anybody taking any look at what was the initial cause of death.
So that's involved.
And why can't the Pope pay his own expenditures?
Amen.
Well, businesses bad, don't you understand? They're crying the blues.
Three businesses bad.
Crying the blues, sir, business is bad. The Vatican's in debt.
They've been giving all that money to the Contras.
Excuse me?
They've been giving all that money to the Contras. Business is bad.
I'm sorry, I don't understand. You mean that the Pope has been giving money to the Contras?
No.
You got this joke.
Of course.
The whole thing is...
The whole thing is a joke. Don't you understand? The whole thing is a joke.
You don't understand that. It's passing right by you.
The whole thing is a joke. The Pope is a joke. This whole thing is a joke.
That's what we're finally learning and unfortunately it's sailing right on by the brains of too many people.
Well, you know what's face, this has been going on for an awful long period of time.
Exactly. It's business.
At a pay and calculate, it's going to be a great deal.
And a few other people, this thing would have not reached the kind of a portion that it's going in.
Well, Billy...
Just for instance, you know the Jerry Fowler is supporting the South African government,
which means that he believes that it's perfectly acceptable and take little back children and concentrate them
and bang their heads and until they become mentally retarded.
He never...
Did he consider that to be in the right of God?
Until he met Jim Baker, he never met a white person he didn't like, sir.
That's Jerry.
Jerry.
Well, now that Jim, now that Pat Boone has that particular problem, he can't do anything either.
Well, no, it looks to me like he could do something.
But we don't want to get into it on air.
Well, I agree that when he was singing April Law or April Showers,
that was a few years before he took that picture.
Yeah. Okay, sir.
Thank you.
Have a great life.
Yeah, somebody has suggested that those organs have been...
Now, there was nothing airbrushed in that picture.
Believe me, okay?
Trust me what I tell you.
There has been nothing airbrushed.
Boy, you know, the more you look at it, the more you realize how small it is.
First you get down on your knees, fiddle with your...
It's 27 before 1 at WYNZ.
And, you know, there's really...
We're going to have to get four more carousels in here, you know why?
Because I'm beginning to realize that within each piece, there are probably dozens that we can spawn out of each one.
You know, like the sun, a Vatican rag.
Or the brother-in-law of the leprechaun condom.
Leprechaun-dom.
Which we haven't played that today, have we?
Well, listen, if you're real good, if you really rub your bloney stone,
and you really put your hands together, say a couple of Hail Mary's,
maybe when we come back from this break, we might play it for you.
David, Jim Baker called me on the phone.
Sunday night, May 17th.
Two months had passed.
He said, Jerry, I want to ask you to hand the ministry back to me.
As you promised, in Palm Springs on March 17th.
I said, Jim, assuming it was being taped, or someone might be listening in,
and it was for the record.
I said, Jim, here's what I want to say to you.
First you get down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries.
No, this is the time of year, when everyone's a wee bit Irish.
Say, Colleen, would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me wax my shallary?
Oh, now that I would, my detached lady, if you'd be wet in the green.
I know there's a smart lassie.
Please make sure her lassies wear in the Kelly Green protection of leprechaundoms.
Don't be wissing on a forlift clover.
I'll fall in for the gist of gab.
Especially if you plan on kissing some blindy stones.
As what have you?
Be doubly in your protection with leprechaundoms.
They're strong enough for a man.
But I like them too.
So, take yourself a leprechaundom, and you won't be catching anything else.
22 before 1 at W.I. and Zenial Ranges with you till 2.
Don't forget Mike Spindell, be filling in tomorrow.
I'm going to be out at Carter losing thousands, and then I'll be back on Monday.
Let's see what's going to happen on Monday.
Taffy's going to be in France, and Glenn Hill is going to be here Monday from 2 to 4.
So that ought to be a heavy, exciting, we're going to have that operation over the weekend.
That cackle box.
And no, oh, that's right.
That's right, Mondays the day we're getting our new phone number.
So, words are going to be really touch and go on the phone.
Miami, hello.
Hello, miss.
We can do.
Just a second.
Who's calling?
Tom.
Okay, Tom.
Yeah, hello.
Hello?
Yes.
Yeah, drop by to visit my great grandma, and safety's all right, and she had you on the radio.
And earlier, I heard you mentioned something about your interest in horses and racetrack stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I have an uncle that checked out a few years ago, and he was, that's the only thing he lived for all his life.
I mean, he enjoyed it.
Anyhow, he owned his own horses, and he was kind of bright, he graduated Bowton in New England.
And he found in his drawer this chart that he made out like it's in.
I was wondering if I could give you, I'd be glad to mail you one, but I was wondering if I could give you a brief like description of it if you could maybe explain it.
I'll hang up and listen, because she's wanting around, and her bag is dragging on the floor that's your name's from.
But on the top line, it's numbers, and all the way down, it's like initials, like M-A-R.
On the top is like numbers, dash 4, dash 3.3, dash 3, and dash 2.
And it goes down to zero, right?
Yeah.
Okay, I knew like the first one, dash 4, it's the initials M-A-R.
And the next one, that's all the initials for that one.
And under the 3.3, it has initials F-G-L-A-T.
No, those are the tracks where they ran.
F-G is the Fairgrounds L-A-T is Latonia and Kentucky. Those are the tracks where they ran.
Yeah, well he spent all his life accumulating this information on here.
And...
These must be speed ratings that he created for the different tracks probably.
Yeah, he spent his whole life on this.
And I really not sure how to explain this or what it's all about, but I'd be glad to mail you one.
Yeah, mail it to me, and then I'll look at it, and then maybe one day next week, call me,
and I'll try to explain it to you, and maybe we'll discover something in here.
We might find a good system.
Like I said, he was bright. He had no problem making bread off of this, but he kept it to himself.
Yeah, well that's the smart way.
Okay, all right, nice talking to you.
Okay, but if I figure it out, I'll share it with you.
Okay, bye.
Okay.
19 before 1 at WINZ, there's an open line at date.
Believe it or not, 624-0191. Hollywood, hello.
Hello, how are you?
Okay.
I understand you don't have the Miami news yet.
No, as a matter of fact, but I do have the racing form.
Well, there's two items in there that your producer thought might be of interest so I decided to stay on and tell you about them.
Okay.
A one is on the front page, it reads,
Minister 1's anti-sensor show at library, censored.
Do you like to hear about it?
Yeah, that's great.
The fundamentalist minister wants to censor two sexually explicit movie schedule to be shown at the downtown Metro Library as part of an anti-sensorship program.
Rick Patterson, pastor and director of Jesus Fellowship, said in a letter to 750 fellow pastors in Miami,
Enough is enough.
I believe at this time for us the pastors and church...
That's what Jessica Hahn said, too.
Oh, yeah.
Anyway, they sent a bunch of these out and they spoke to the folks at the library.
He says, we have a series of films each of which present different reasons for having been banned, religious, racial, sexual and political.
And it's always the old nemesis of sex they object to.
Yeah.
One of the films is anti-catholic called the miracle.
Patterson said,
a representative of the American Coalition for Traditional Values will address the Metro Commission next Tuesday,
and his attempt to stop the showing of the last tango in Paris in La Cache of Faults.
Oh, my God.
At the library.
God forbid.
The films have been included in a series of five being shown as part of a program called censorship and libraries,
which is described as an attempt to educate the public about the dangers of censorship.
And the library says, ideas are by their very nature radical.
It is unrealistic to expect that a library will shelter everyone from whatever they dislike.
And he says, let's see, response to the letters is coming in.
Patterson says he's received signed petitions from Wayside and Graham Baptist Churches.
And anyway, the library says this was not billed as family entertainment series.
It is not being presented in the context of family entertainment.
Yeah. Well, I preach there.
He's going to have a big fight on his hand with the priest in town if he tries to cancel La Cache of Faults.
Let's see.
What really bothers me is that people kind of think of the public library as a Disney institution.
In fact, it's a vital institution for democracy because what makes up a democracy is an informed citizenry.
And literacy is what they advocate.
Yeah. God forbid.
So that was that thing.
And the other thing is on the up e page in the front of section C, mentions you in the same breath with George Carlin.
Uh-huh.
It says Bill von Moore wrote this.
This is Wins Radio's talk show host, Neil Rogers, who has his own list of words for the FCC.
Would like to double-bowl his running target if he could line up George Carlin to help him pull the trigger.
In a telephone interview from his LA home carlin, the off e comedian who acquired label counterculture comic, blah, blah, blah.
He said he was aware of Rogers' gunning for the FCC.
He even knew about the acronym Rogers' using for his crusade against the government agency that regulates radio broadcasting.
And some say it's trying to control minds too.
Rogers calls his campaign against the agency and its actions so far save our first amendment rights.
Wow.
And, um, I see.
And they talk about the kid Chris Douglas.
Yeah.
There's a whole story about Chris and here how, uh...
Yeah, his father was one and opened all this garbage up here.
I'm not even working over there.
And, uh, Carlin's been quoting HLMacon who says,
people have the right to make their own choices, but certain people deserve to be offended.
And so bad taste and indecency should be protected.
Yeah.
Now we're trying to get him on sometime in the next 10 days.
Oh, that's great.
Anyway, I thought you'd like to know about that.
And, um, I'm thoroughly enjoying your program.
And, I'm working on my second petition.
And I just sent it off to the postcards.
Excellent.
And don't stop.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, don't tone it down.
Don't change anything.
We won't.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
Okay, by the way, speaking of the petitions, I haven't even given the address today.
And the weekend is here and I'm not going to be on tomorrow.
I'm sure that Mike is going to really lean on the thing tomorrow, right?
You bet.
So far, PO Box 2214 Miami 33055.
Now, I realize I'm asking a lot of people who already signed petitions and circuit of petitions
to start all over again and get involved with the second part of what we're doing, but we're sending out these cards, thousands of them to our representatives and senators in Washington, asking them if they support censorship and putting them on the spot, trying to help us get the FCC out of the business of censorship and the sticking
there knows in the first amendment.
So if you'd like some of these cards, please send this to your...
You don't even have to supply the envelope.
Just your name and address on a card or in a letter to so far SOFAR, save our first amendment rights.
PO Box 2214 Miami 33055.
I guess we got them upset at the arts diocese.
They're eating macaroni and cheese today.
That's what I heard. They're so upset that they're going back to no meat on a Friday.
Should we do something to pass or fight them a little bit? Maybe a little dedication?
PO Box 2214 Miami 33055.
I was there March 17 and confronted you with the story I had heard that you had raped some girl in Florida in a hotel.
You advised me in a private meeting that you did not rape anyone, but that in fact your wife at that time was in love with another man.
And you were trying to win her love back and hoping to make her jealous.
The John West of Fletcher per your request brought a 19 year old girl down from New York.
Okay, we're back. It's 13 before 1 at W.I.N.Z. And where we going next?
Should we take a call from Miami? It's always a risk. Hello. Hello.
Buenos dias. Listen, you have to excuse my poor English, but I've been trying to get in touch with you for about four weeks to give you a name or a good restaurant.
Okay. Try it. Something new. We're ready.
As a Japanese restaurant that is on 32nd Avenue between Coral Way and 24th Street, the name is Fuji.
FUJI. Yeah. And I want you to try that. My name is Oscar Gerizo. And if you want to collect it, you don't like it.
You can call me at Amon the telephone book and I'll tell you for the meal.
Oh, don't do that though. Everybody be looking up in the book and calling you and expecting you to pay for their meal.
No, but if you don't like it, if you like it, I know you won't call me. You'll go back there and we'll meet up there someday.
Okay. Thank you, sir. Thanks, Oscar. 12 minutes before 1 at W.I.N.Z. There's an open line in Broward 764 0707. We'll come back right after this.
I can see a lot of praise for you. Finally, but 10 records that you've been waiting for.
Tammy Faze, unbelievable new album. Here's the rock. I crawled out from under.
I put six tantums of makeup on. Then my husband does it with Jessica Hound.
Oh, baby, forward cold and go wild. I'm all strong now down boots and pigs.
It's all here. The headache, the heartache, the pancake.
Rock of age just is my face. My mascara won't erase.
Tammy Faze, here's the rock that I crawled out from under.
Don't you buy my new album? If you don't, you're burning hair. You're really real. Thank you, God bless you.
In Jessica Hound, you told me that when the door was closed and you and Jessica were in that room, that if anyone raped anyone, she raped you.
She began to undress you. You were at that moment, temporarily impotent.
I'm going to be a little bit more patient.
I'm going to be a little bit more patient.
It's 1252 at WINZ. Where should we go next? Marguid, hello.
I knew how are you. Okay.
But, on the other hand, instead of going to the track and risking your dollars on things that may or may not result in a profit for you, I have an entrepreneurial investment.
Then I think that you'd be interested in. Are you ready?
I'm listening.
Okay. In light of the success that up with people has had all around the country, how about something like up with rabbis?
I mean, we can make a fortune down on Halendil.
The only problem we might have is four-well, could steal it from us.
And then he might be titled simply to call up yours and go around to...
Exactly.
You know that's what I think he's already done that.
Oh, yeah, he has. That's the only problem we might have with this.
That's what Jim Baker told Falwell.
That he had done that and Falwell said to him when I wasn't the first one, obviously.
You lost me, but that...
Not good. I'm glad. I'm glad I fumbled around a little with that because it's good. We wanted to lose everybody with that.
No, you don't want to lose anybody. You're picking up 40 and four all the time.
I know. On a street corner. I picked up a listener on the corner of Biscayne in 79th the other day.
Did he speak English?
No. Okay, well, did he see what Pacifica did with regard to the FCC?
Yeah, they're doing Ulysses.
Yeah, did they get permission to do it?
What do you mean get permission? They're going to play it. They've done it every year for six years.
This is the seventh year in a row that they've played it on June 16th.
But they've asked for permission to see if that would...
If that would... If one of the greatest...
Well, no. No. The FCC has said they're not going to do anything until after they play it.
Oh, I see. I didn't hear that.
In other words, it's like opening up the trap door and saying, okay, go ahead and walk through and we'll see if you survive.
Well, that's how they play ball.
And Donald Wildman has said, okay, when they do this, we're going to say, go ahead, prosecute.
Like, you know, he's the judge in the jury.
Have you ever heard him, by the way?
No, I haven't.
The guy in Tupelo, Mississippi, he can barely speak. He's like subcreetin' like he hatched under a rock like a barnacle you'd find in the bottom of the Titanic.
What's he doing way out there? Why isn't he in the White House?
Well, he wants to be there with all the classy people in Tupelo.
I see. All those Elvis fans.
I got you. And you'll have a good day.
You too.
Thank you.
Oh, wait a minute.
Is he still singing? He's still making guttable sounds.
I guess got the tail end of Pat there, but I'm sorry about that.
Speaking of the tail end, don't forget, get your envelopes in for your boom box.
I will say this, that everybody who comes in this studio, yesterday you noticed they were a little bit bashful.
They didn't want to be the first one in because if they did, then people would start raising eyebrows.
But today everybody who's come in has really said, this is everything that I have said and then some.
Okay, I'm not exaggerating.
But boy, I hope you've got good eyesight because it's not everything he was cracked up to be.
Miami, hello.
Hello. Hello. Hello.
Rusty nose.
What?
Meaning?
Get rid of a...
Okay, sir. Happy Easter, too.
18 before 11 at a WI in Zila.
See, how many of we taken?
6, 9, 14.
That was good.
Five minutes before 11, well, at least he's not talking now.
His parole officer's going to be there on Monday.
We have an open line in Dade, 624-0191, Miami. Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
Did you read the story in the inquire on Jerry Falwell?
No.
It's a June 2nd issue.
It's a same TV evangelist.
Jerry Falwell got a million plus advance for a tell-all auto bio.
He says it'll be a real shocker for people who think I was Christian 10 years before I was born.
Reverend Falwell admits he refused to attend church and never cracked the Bible until his spiritual rebirth at age 18.
And he also reveals in St. Frantford's journey that his dad was a rich notorious criminal who was hot tempered and volatile and who killed his own brother after he came at him with a pistol in each hand during a drug-induced rampage.
Reverend Falwell said his dad felt so guilty about the killing.
He started boozing heavily, often at the rate of several bottles of whiskey a day.
Obviously, you could not have intercourse with her.
What do you think of that?
Well, what can I say?
But you've never got so much to say about everybody else.
Huh?
What is there to say? I mean, I'm spellbound.
No, I was too, and I read it.
I mean, he can go into the details, but he likes to go to.
Okay, listen, I hate to move.
Okay, listen, we've got a good call here coming up. I hate to cut her short. Can you get him on the air? Do you still there?
What's that?
Who was the question?
No, I...
Oh, no, she's... oh, I see. Are you there?
I'm here.
Okay.
Am I on?
Who was the question?
I question.
Yeah.
I want to know, first of all, I got a couple of them.
Yeah, I heard the first one.
No, you didn't. You got a different person now, I think.
Oh.
So, are I on there now?
Are you on what?
Yeah.
Okay, first of all, I want to know who's Daffy.
Is that not the same guy?
No, it's not me.
Okay, no.
You look at hysterical. Well, is he still on the funerary hang up? He's gone?
Okay. Don't get panicky now. Just relax.
Well, that's...
Well, that's it's almost still one o'clock already. Not you, Kyle. Kyle's having a nervous breakdown.
Hey, Kyle, sorry.
He saw somebody run out of the newsroom yesterday, and he's trying to do his best to imitate. Go ahead, I'm sorry.
First of all, who's Daffy?
I'm walking out. I can't stand it. What?
Who's Daffy?
Daffy is Daffy. She comes on after me.
That's a girl.
Yeah.
Oh, see, I've only listed a couple of times. I just heard you saying it before.
Well, you've got to start listening every day, then you find it's like a soap opera.
You've got to watch several days before you figure who all the characters are.
All right, well, I also got another question.
Whatever happened at Barbara's Fudley, my partner over here was...
He said that he used to listen to Barbara's Fudley.
Oh, yeah. Well, I'd get away from him real quick. I'd run out of the building screaming and shouting.
Why's that?
Barbara's busy selling weapons to the contras.
Barbara's busy selling weapons to the contras.
And testifying in Washington.
Testifying in Washington.
Yeah. Why are you repeating? I sound like an echo like I'm in an echo chamber.
Oh, okay. Well, I'm sorry about that.
That's okay.
So the guy in here called it again.
A horse joke. Remember that?
Yeah.
What's all a horse manure? I don't understand.
Is this your best material?
My best material. I don't have any best material.
Oh, okay. Well, listen, get some and then call us again.
Mike Wolf is here with local and area news headlines.
World News from CBS at the top of the yard.
We do have one open line in Broward 764 0707.
Let's see. I thought we could get that other guy in the air.
But he just ran. You know that coward?
Probably looking at his pad moon picture right now.
After you were in the shower saying weeping and saying to God, oh, God.
I've been with a whore.
Seven minutes after one at W.I.N.Z.
And we have one open line. It's in Dade County 624 0191.
Let's, uh, we have a hostile caller.
That's good and for Lauderdale. Hello.
Hello. Yes. On this pad moon picture.
Yeah. Are you saying he's a victim of pubic side?
Puma side. Very good.
Does that what it looks like?
That's certainly what it does look like. Yeah.
Okay. I got to ask you one more thing.
Why didn't say you were hostile on the screen? Are you hostile?
Oh, far from hostile. I'm not allowed.
Okay. Maybe we're just hostile when you first called.
Now let me answer something else on this pseudo intellectual.
Yeah.
I'd like to think of you more as the epitome of
sugacity. Yeah.
As wise as Solomon.
You know, uh, very good.
Yeah. Thank you.
Okay. Testing my vocabulary.
I'll have you know, sir, that there are a lot of words that I know,
most of which I can't use on this show.
We have an open line in Broward 764 0707 Lauderdale lakes. Hello.
Hi, Neil. How are you?
It was a little, that was a little test.
Well, you see a brother of Kathy.
He's a certified sued.
You know, you're a brother of this year. I giggle and just for all of her all the time I listen to,
I just enjoy you so much.
Well, listen, you can giggle, but don't cackle if you cackle.
You're in big trouble.
Uh, Tommy, do you remember getting a letter with a text in it?
Well, I've been checked with different types for the so far.
But do you remember getting a letter with the gold label?
Yes, I certainly do.
Well, I'm that gal.
I would try to get you off and on, but I can't.
I'm so surprised I'm so successful today.
I was really impressed with that.
I was well done by that.
I hope so.
Anyway, you know, I just want to repeat what I said in one of my letters that day.
You know, I had a call for a tape and I still didn't get it on.
And this is going on what almost a month.
Mm-hmm.
So, you know, wait a minute, you had called for one?
No, I had written, you know, I had sent you a blank and money and so far.
And you didn't get your tape yet?
No, I didn't get yet.
And this is almost a month now.
Well, we'll have to find out what's happening with Marlon Bailey.
I haven't heard from Marlon today.
Uh-huh.
He's handling all the tapes.
Uh-huh.
And if anything happens to Marlon, boy, we're all in big trouble.
Oh, boy.
I wish you were closer.
I'd give you some help.
In fact, he was supposed to bring by the new Elvis picture today and we haven't seen it yet.
Oh, boy.
That's very important to me.
I'd rather have to tape.
Well, anyway, as I say, you are a breath of fresh air.
I'm telling you, I don't have my kids around me, but you take their place.
You are just terrific and I take the same way you do.
Uh-uh.
So, I want to thank you for giving me so much and doing the listening to you.
I don't know what I do without something like this to listen to every day.
Okay.
Well, listen, if you don't get that tape in next couple of weeks, so let me know.
We'll see you get it.
All right, he had some ideas.
Well, take care of yourself.
You too.
Have a happy.
Thank you.
You too, dear.
Bye.
Elvis and Pat together.
Is that what that picture is supposed to be?
Where is it?
We haven't heard from Marlon.
I know Spindell is going to have a good time tomorrow, boy.
I can tell.
Mike, if you're listening, boy, call in sick.
Trust me.
Before it's too late, do it now.
Two open lines are both in Broward, 764, 0707.
We came back into the room where several people were, including Mark Dumas, Jerry Names, Pastor Dorch.
We came into that room and we were there six hours, totally.
Not 25 minutes.
I wonder what the heck they were doing in that room.
That must be the orgy in the sauna that they were talking about to think so.
11 past one.
Let's take a call in Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, am I out?
You're in.
Okay.
Yeah, listen.
Have you ever seen a bumper sticker?
Wait, wait a minute.
Are you on a bad phone?
I don't think so.
On a cheap phone?
Hello?
Hello.
Yeah, can you hear me all right?
Just barely.
It sounds like you're talking through a tin can.
If I holler, is that okay?
Hello.
Yeah.
Is that better?
I can hear you fine.
Can you hear me?
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I can hear you a little bit.
Okay.
I just wondering that you've seen the bumper sticker having you the more majority is meter.
Yeah.
Okay.
Anyway, I've fallen all his cohorts.
There's very far was pretty active politically, you know.
I'm signing up for the president things like this.
I'm wondering, and I know you, you're opinion of the people of Southern Florida is that they're
bringing their people.
Yeah.
I'm from Northern California myself.
I've been here for about a year and a half.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm wondering if you would ever consider addressing me the, this constitutional convention that
the conservative right is trying to bring around.
You know, do you think you would stimulate my interest?
All I'm doing is keeping quiet and hoping it doesn't happen.
Well, if it happens, you realize we all have to get a passport.
We're all going to have to leave the country.
Yeah, we're not far good when I left California.
We're going to have to ban you to about more out there, but we're two states away from
ratification.
You know, to get, you know, for it to go before a voter, whatever.
Yeah.
That's getting pretty scary.
I know.
Can you just imagine?
I'd be, to be, to be hard.
I mean, for me to go would be the first amendment.
The new founding fathers at the second constitutional convention, Jim and Tammy Faye, Jerry
Falwell, Ed Mice, William Rennquist, and Oliver North.
It's pretty scary, Bob, but I'd say, you know, anyway, I listen to your shout quite often,
and I've never called you a shout.
I've called the cocktail grounds out West, and I've called the other station out here once,
but I just wondered if you think it would, you know, stir up my interest.
I know that when it comes to political discussions out here, God help you if you're not Republican
and, you know, to the right of a till of a home.
That's right, yeah.
You catch my drift, don't you?
Well, we all have to be, if we're to the left of a till of the home, we're all commonestas,
you know that.
We can just say the fact.
Yeah.
Anyway.
I have my card in my wallet.
Which one?
My common Easter card.
You're a closet Communist, I see.
Well, listen, you can't come out of hogger closets.
That's right.
Well, you know, gotta keep the few things secret, right?
You bet.
Well, listen, have a great life.
Yeah, you're really doing great, you know, and, well, you know,
maybe one of these days, some of these lives out here with love, you know,
I mean, turn on to some, politically active, uh,
I don't know.
Yeah, we have a lot of lobotomies that are going on now in secret labs all over town.
We have little bits of Bill Casey's brain that are being inserted.
So just wait, it's going to be exciting.
I'm not suggesting revolutionary, but, uh, if the people are being so, uh, brainwashed by the image makers,
then I think we hold up in a while.
I just want to alert you what's going to happen when these people wake up from the operation.
What's going to happen?
They're going to go back to their condos, get their checkbooks, rush to the bank,
sign over all their CDs to the contras.
It's going to be incredible.
All right, yeah.
Okay, take care.
And in that, uh, six hours, somewhere along the way, you said,
Jerry, I want you to take the ministry.
And I ask you the question, why do you want me to take it?
You said you're the only preacher I trust right now.
Wait, what?
Fris words.
All I say.
115 at WINZ.
Miami, hello.
Oh, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
I wanted to ask you if you saw a 2020 last night.
No.
Okay, what they were talking about was, and, uh, I don't know, you know, if this is a big issue,
and I, but, uh, with deporting, uh, those, uh, German, both people were Germans before,
and then became citizens of the United States, and came over on the boat,
and, uh, then that's how they became American citizens, and then they've been found to be, um,
Nazis.
Right.
And I wanted to hear what opinion I had about that.
What opinion I have about it?
Yes.
I mean, what is it?
What opinion can you have?
This government has a shameful record for 42 years now.
This government has been playing cozy with Nazi war criminals.
Yes, I agree.
We never met a Nazi we didn't like.
Right.
And, uh, they're also, you know, the scientists and whatnot came over and had, uh,
diplomatic immunity or immunity due towards the scientific community.
Yeah.
I think that was wrong.
Okay.
Okay, then, now, thank you for talking to me.
Okay.
As a matter of fact, when they were trying to figure out a way, what to do about Bill Casey,
they were very distraught that Dr. Mangala wasn't around anymore.
They were all wishing that somebody would have taught him how to swim.
It's 116 at W-I-N-Z Hollywood.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Did I catch you off guard?
Yeah.
I love PTL.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Great.
I even love Oliver Norris.
Excellent.
Well, you have good taste.
Oh, they've provided me with many a happy moment.
I know.
Oh, I wish there were just more of it.
Further, he went on to say that he wanted me to form a new board.
Ah.
And in the course of things, after we had, and that was quite a traumatic thing for me as well,
after I had agreed to do that, before I left the room, he asked the question,
do you think I could ever come back to PTL?
What do you think?
You say what?
Well, I don't think you should.
I think you should stick with Jessica on.
Yeah.
I've even made up a song called The Rape of Jessica on.
Really?
Yeah, but I haven't got any words.
That sounds like a delightful little ditty.
I play it on Johnson Street beats.
Do you really?
Yeah.
I bet that goes over big.
Oh, it goes over like a lead balloon.
Like a pregnant pole vaulter, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, you know what my greatest ambition is?
I'm afraid to ask.
Maybe I should be afraid to tell.
Go ahead, we're listening with Bated Breath.
Well, I'm trying to be a lesbian, but I can't be very successful at it because I'm...
I'm a man and a man can't be a lesbian, but I...
Really?
Well, you could work on it.
You could have the operation first.
Yeah.
But somebody said I could be a faggot, but that's too normal.
I don't want to be a faggot.
No, anybody can be that.
Yeah, I want to be a lesbian.
Nobody can be a lesbian except a woman.
But I'm trying hard.
But anyway.
Yeah, moving right along.
I just wanted to tell you that I love PTL.
And Jerry fall well and pant boon too.
What is pubeside?
That's like genocide.
Hmm.
But you killed out of lessons.
No, when you look at the picture, your whole family dies.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I'm not a lesbian.
I get myself getting used to it any days because one is being treated for the audience and that is I'm not let known.
I'm a rabies boy and the next one is suicide dog.
And I tend when you're told that we're not going to talk about it as it is not.
Sure so you are not going to talk about if you're treated the entire morning and you're
not calling your mom and dad to call for financial recovery, as it is, it will appear.
You know I was".
We haven't reported my issue.
I know she isn't in the bottle.
No, we don't answer personal questions on the air, sir.
No, not personally. It's just, I guess the question.
Yeah. If you, if you thought hate the Cubans.
I don't hate the Cubans.
Well, you know, I heard that you knew he had the Cubans.
No, well, whoever told you that didn't know what they're talking about.
Okay, I don't hate the Cubans.
Well, I deal with people as individuals.
I don't know about you, but I deal with everybody as an individual.
Well, no, yesterday when you were talking about it, you mentioned it, you know, like the Blacks,
you mentioned like the Jewish and the Cubans and stuff like that.
And you know, you said that you had higher lia and the Cubans.
No, I didn't say no. I never said I hate higher lia and I never said I hate Miami.
Well, you said you went shopping the store.
Exactly because I don't speak Spanish. That's right.
But see, what's wrong with it? I mean, I see I'm 24 years old and I've been living here since I was a kid.
Yeah.
And I got a school and I got American friends. I got Black friends and I got Jewish friends.
Yeah.
And some of my best friends.
And then that bad, I mean, I was born in the United States.
Now, both of them almost since I was 12.
Yeah.
And I came from Cuba and I mean, I got into your army and stuff like that.
But, I mean, so what are we talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, you know, what I was saying to you is because you know, my answer, my question was, since you weren't, you know, saying all those things about the Jewish and the Black and all like that.
All what things? What are you talking about?
Well, I was saying that if you don't like Miami, the one you just get out, one you just leave.
If you don't like the show, why are you listening and much less, why are you calling it?
Well, I'm calling you to tell you.
I mean, you said you have a show to talk and that's why I'm calling.
If you don't like it, why are you listening to it?
Well, it's a good show. I'm not saying there's a bad show.
Oh, I see.
Very good show, but I'm just...
Well, if I left, you wouldn't have this show to listen to.
Your life wouldn't be worth anything if I left.
Oh, I know that.
Okay.
I know. You have a good show, but I'm just...
Well, see, I'm doing you a pubic service.
Huh?
I'm doing you a public service.
Well, I know you're doing it so I'm good service.
But I see what I'm saying is that I just wanted to ask.
I live in plantation.
I don't live in Miami. I live in plantation.
Oh, okay.
No, but just say that you're saying that.
There are at least two dozen people who speak English in plantation.
But, Steve, do you come back again to the same question that I asked?
No, I'm not coming back to any question.
We're not even talking about this today.
We talked about it two days ago, not yesterday.
But you're rehashing it again.
Everybody's getting along just fine today.
The other day, I got hanged up.
By who?
I don't know. When they said,
I used to live in higher Lia when it was 20th, when they hang up on it.
That's why I called today because I wanted to talk about that.
About that subject.
Yeah.
Okay, well, I just thank you for...
I used to live in higher Lia.
That's why that's why I called.
Because you said that you know that you do want to shop on higher Lia's stores
and some of the places because...
I like, you know, because people talk about this and stuff like that.
Exactly.
Why should I go to higher Lia this shop when I live near the Broward Mall?
Do you used to live at Broward Mall?
Yeah.
I used to live close to this.
Right.
So if you lived there, you wouldn't you shop at Westland, would you?
Well, you know, like I said, I got nothing against nobody.
Neither.
I mostly was born here. I get along with everybody.
Okay.
All right, well, thank you for calling us.
Okay, I'll call you again.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Jim Baker called me on the phone.
Sunday night, May 17th.
Two months had passed.
He said, Jerry, I want to ask you to hand the ministry back to me.
As you promised in Palm Springs on March 17th.
I said, Jim, assuming it was being taped or someone might be listening in and it was for the record.
I said, Jim, here's what I want to say to you.
Say, you flex, say, you flex, say, you flex.
Hey, say, you need to...
You're doing it, boy.
Yeah, hey, you're about me.
You're going to fall too.
Put him in electric chair.
Now we're gone, the sinches head.
Five, five, five, eight bunnies.
That voltage feed us feed us.
I'll bet help, then I squeal.
Five, five, five bunnies.
One you can run and understand.
Boy, that chair is really gone and sprained.
It's locked for no.
Roller's switch.
Now it's time for a bunch of switch on and deep.
Five, five.
Five, five, five bunnies.
Five, five bunnies.
It said to find electric shoes.
How deep can I stay out of this?
Don't you worry about a thing Sunday,
we'll all sing.
Five, five, five bunnies.
A little going away present for Daffy there.
Five, five, bunnies.
Five, five, bunnies.
Five, five bunnies.
Maybe they were able to reconsider the death penalty in France.
130 at WINZ.
Now she had a sense of humor that I enjoyed.
Fort Lauderdale, hello.
Are you there?
Are you gone?
Coconut Creek, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Hi, how are you today?
Good.
We were looking here to show for a year or so now.
Who knows how long?
We took your advice.
We went to Casarolla, the Thai restaurant, for dinner last night.
We tried the food it was seen and I'll tell you,
it's the greatest and nothing compares to it.
I thought we'd gotten what to have and it was unbelievable.
Great.
The place was spotless and then the restaurant business,
I think it's the immaculate conception of the ultimate.
You can't compare anything with it.
We ought to put that in their spot.
I'm telling you, and I would like to thank you so much
for wonderful things you're doing and I'd like to say hi to Pat and Mary Lou,
the owners of the restaurant and I'd like to thank you personally.
Okay.
Good morning, great job and good luck tomorrow, I call her.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Have a good life.
Boy, talk about enthusiasm.
He was just gushing, huh?
When I was there, March 17,
and confronted you with the story I had heard
that you had raped some girl in Florida in Ota.
You advised me in a private meeting that you did not rape anyone,
but that in fact your wife at that time was in love with another man.
And you were trying to win her love back and hoping to make her jealous
that John West had fletcher per your request brought a 19-year-old girl
down from New York in Jessica Han.
It's 131 at W.I.N.C.
and Ziernex Collar is in South Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
Excellent program, as usual.
As usual.
You know, last night on Larry King's,
they talked about Jim and Tammy,
and this guy who was just talking with his fall well,
that they were all at President Reagan's inaugural in 1981.
What does that tell us?
Are they all good friends of his?
Yeah.
Considering this Iran scam thing is happening now.
They're all in bed together, so to speak.
I'm wondering if they didn't all get together to kind of take the limelight off the President.
You had a call about how it goes.
You told me the window was closed,
and you and Jessica were in that room.
And I'm wondering if anyone raped anyone,
she raped you?
What was that, sir?
I'm wondering if Ali North didn't buy a donkey with those travelers checks
is thought of me an impeachable offense.
No, I think he gave all the money to the PTL club.
And you know, the funny thing that nobody mentions is that Oliver North is not only a born again Christian,
but an absolute fanatic born again.
I mean, he's just obsessed.
That's right.
He's a head behind the Bible several times, I believe.
So I have a feeling that all of these people, once they take the big blanket off in the sky,
all of these people are going to be lying their naked together in the same big water bed.
You know, if Gary Hart couldn't run because he had overnight thing with a woman.
Yeah.
You notice, by the way, nobody cares about that anymore.
You notice how quickly that came and kind of disappeared?
That's right.
But boy, the Jim and Tammy thing, it was kind of hot for a little while there.
Then the Gary Hart thing came and disappeared almost overnight.
And now, Jim and Tammy Fae are like bigger than Mary Tyler Moore.
I mean, it's just a criminal.
After our sailors got killed last week,
so follow just came out with that remarkable statement two days ago.
It took the line off the Marine thing and then off with what Mr. Gonzalez Lopez,
he got three or four names, what he said about Reagan loving all the Norths ass.
I still can't get over that.
That's incredible, isn't it?
They haven't made a bigger thing out of it and they have.
It blew me out.
Well, if you look at the president's cabinet and all the people that he's appointed in the last six and a half years,
it's obvious that Ronald Reagan never met an ass he didn't like.
And the truth is coming out now.
I don't know why we're not hearing from his supporters to do anything.
I guess they're all lining up to...
They're all praying.
They're all praying that Jack Kim's past doesn't come out.
Wait till I give the picture a Pat Boone and Jack Kim, that's going to be the good one.
Pat Boone and his brother, Pat Boone.
Yeah.
Amen.
Okay.
That's Bush, you nailed.
Same to you, sir. The Lord loves you.
If you began to undress you,
you were at that moment temporarily impotent,
so obviously you could not have intercourse with her.
134 are next call in Miami Beach, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
I was out of morning at the hospital taking tests,
but when I came back I heard you mention Pat Boone again.
Yes.
So my dislike forever,
will you tell me what it's about?
Are you, you mean you don't know?
No.
Are you serial?
No, I was at the doctor's all afternoon yesterday in the hospital
was more than you.
And I'd like to know just what it is inside just mentioned.
I never did my 10th and they stole a reef and life.
Are you standing up or sitting down?
I'm sitting down.
Okay, I have in my hand from the January 1984 issue
of Hustler Magazine,
a two-page article, Pat Boone Nude.
Are you following me so far?
Yes.
Every word.
Okay.
Yeah, that's very nice.
That's all I ever thought of him.
That he's not very, very good parents, now.
And the second page has a picture of young Pat about 20 years old.
Uh-huh.
And he has a cardboard box with a big hole in it.
Uh-huh.
And you can, you'll have to use your own imagination as to what he's sticking through the hole.
Yes, I've already followed with you.
Are you going to send in for your copy?
No, but I'll send you in an extra check for your cause.
Excellent.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
On a day, like today, we've got to find a way.
You told me to 15 minutes later you were in the shower, saying,
weeping and saying to God, oh God, I've been with a whore.
It's 136 at W.I.N.C.
I think we should, we have two more breaks or one.
One, two.
Okay, well let's try one now and if it works well, we'll do another one later.
It's holiday.
Have a memorial day savings riot at your Norton tire center.
And when word of this incredible sale gets around, it'll be here.
Here in the checkpad, boo-n-out and what a disappointment, huh?
They said no big deal.
That was the reaction.
They couldn't believe it.
They said that last time they were to the track and saw the jockeys
was the last time they saw anything even close to that small.
I mean, you're going to be in for a shock.
And this is not a put on.
I mean, this is for real.
If you'd like a free copy, we'll send you both pages.
And again, thank the gentleman who brought this in yesterday.
And trust me, sir, you will get it back.
In fact, what I plan on doing is sending him one of those 100 divergent copies
that we're getting it's at least we can do for him from Hustler.
But if you want your own copy of Pat Boone Nude, although he's not new,
he's got all the rest of his clothes on.
It's just what he's sticking through the cardboard box that I imagine
would bring a lot of attention, especially over at the art's diocese.
In fact, they've requested the first copy over there.
They want to check this out to see if it's true or if it's just another ugly rumor
that that guy in a radio, that shot-jock has started.
That's what they allege is the reason that they want to have a look at it.
They want to inspect it at the rectory.
Hollywood, hello.
Hi.
Neil, that's something happened to me.
Unbelievable yesterday concerning you.
I had your program on and forward was in the back, but you know, you've been with a horror.
Two young fellas walk into the storm watching for a friend of mine.
And they said, is that Neil Rogers on the radio?
I said, yes.
And they said, you should not be listening to him.
The man is evil and Christ will call us all down the count for this.
I said, I don't begrudge you, you're right.
Stay away from Monica.
But how did you recognize his voice so quickly?
Yeah.
And he said, we are all poor to know the voice of the devil.
Oh, absolutely.
But it's a man.
These are not all people.
Prunes.
These were young fellas no more than 20.
Another thing, you have the whole issue of that January with Pat Boone.
No, I just have the two pages.
Oh, because I went crazy looking for that.
I had thrown all my old copies away, but I had sent a picture in it one time of an eight plants that they published with a little thing on the bottom.
And it happened to be in the same issue.
So I'm thinking, am I going to be a millionaire with having fun at these original copies?
It could be.
I'm Tonya.
These could be collectors copies.
It could be more valuable than Elvis's blog.
Yeah.
But anyway, it's really an awful picture.
Isn't it the guy really going to join a monastery?
Oh, absolutely.
I mean, it makes me feel good at this point.
I just, I can't believe that there's anything that tiny.
You know what I'm saying?
Now we know why Shirley Foley left him a couple of times.
Anyway, they're on to you and they're out to get you bow.
Okay, well, I'm going to be watching for him at Carter tomorrow.
There'll be out there too, plunging their brains out for God.
Just take care.
Good luck.
See you later.
We came back into the room where several people were, including Mark Demost, Jerry Nimms, Pastor Dorch.
We came into that room and we were there six hours, totally.
I'm going to be on my way.
142 at Winds Miami.
Hello.
Hello?
Yes.
Listen, Neil.
I love you, Proveer.
I've been listening to it for three days.
Because the friend of mine turned me on to it.
But I was talking with another friend of mine.
They were talking about the whole deal with the religious scandal.
Yeah.
And I think that it's funny that these people like my baker and follow, they're getting all this money.
And then they're not attacked by the government.
And that's the best part of it in their eyes, in their own eyes.
They don't get a bit of tax.
And I think that, you know, that's because church and state should be separate.
That's what the Constitution says.
And I think that if they're going to follow that part of the Constitution, I think that it should also follow, you know, at the first amendment with the non-conspiracy.
With a non-compete clause, right?
Right.
Okay. Well, listen, good luck to you.
Have a great weekend.
Thank you, too.
Stay tuned for further adventures.
Good luck at the racial.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Adios.
Sylvester Stallone stars in his most challenging role since Reinstein.
Yo, Mandy, and you came, and you came without taking it, and now you're burning down.
Stallone is Manolo, and Barry first went part one.
It's a miracle.
Ah!
Got it, Dakota.
Absolutely, yo.
Copacabanda with my own name.
Ah!
Rex Reed says, I love the costumes.
Jean Siskel exclaims four stars, yo, absolutely. Roger Ebert says, pass the popcorn.
Sylvester Stallone has the limp arm of the lawn. Barry first went part one.
You are the disease that I'm the cure.
Yes, yo.
And coming this summer.
I know you are, but what a boy.
Rudger Hauer in.
I know you are, but what a boy.
Peewees last adventure.
I know you're, but what a-
And in that six hours, somewhere along the way you said, Jerry, I want you to take the ministry.
And I ask you the question, why do you want me to take it?
You said you're the only preacher I trust right now.
Oh, you don't lie.
When I cry, each time I saw the sign, take our love letters from the sign.
You know, there's something that just, just dawned on me.
You noticed that real high pitch in his voice?
Now, I know nothing about music, so I don't know. What do they call it?
Tenor? Something like that.
Like a squeaky tenor, kind of like Ron Sachs.
Now, I don't want to get too graphic, but remember the day we were talking about when Tom Gallagher was in here in Leed Gillette.
And there's that old stereotype about guys who have real, deep voices have got, how do I say it delicately?
More than a generous share of whatever the Lord handed out.
Is that a very nice, genteel way of saying it?
Or Gentile way of saying it?
Boy, there goes that. There goes our spotlight.
Kyle just dropped one of our prizes from the herald on the floor in the control room.
That's the end of that.
Anyway, getting back to this and I'm trying to handle it delicately.
If you notice that real high pitch when Pat sings, and then you look at the picture,
I think you'll begin to realize, seriously, that there's more to it.
Now, perhaps Ron Sachs would like to fess up, huh?
I mean, what's it all about down there, Ron?
And of course, I guess if that were your fate in life, you would win a lot too.
146 at WYNZ, and let's...
I'm going to tell you something.
If you ever did anything that I suggested that you should do,
writing in for a copy of the picture is imperative.
I mean, if you just want to go crazy, and of course the copies are not, I will grant you.
They're not as good as the original, but make no mistake about it.
Make no bones about it.
You're just going to have a nervous breakdown when you see this.
You'll be the head of the party all over town.
Okay, let's get back to the calls.
Miami Beach, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, you're solving interludes in between the phone calls.
I didn't think I'd get on.
But the first thing is I want to ask you, is it true that tapping the columns
is not going to be on anymore?
That's correct.
From when is it going to be?
This is your last show today.
Why? What's the reason for that?
Well, again, when you ask me what's the reason for that, you have to ask management.
The real reason.
Is it because they're rating that down or something?
You didn't let me finish my sentence.
Sorry, okay.
I don't make those decisions in spite of what many of her callers said yesterday,
I have nothing to do with who stays, who gets fired, who gets hired.
I have nothing to do with any of that.
Management makes those decisions.
I understand.
I didn't even hear her show yesterday.
I just heard you saying yesterday that she might not be on anymore.
Yeah.
Well, you know, what she does, and again, I commend her for, you know,
going out like a pro and not making a big scene and, you know, conducting yourself in that way all along,
and I commend her for that.
But what she's doing is that just doesn't fit in what the station wants to be.
Who is going to be taking her place, do they know yet?
Stan Major.
Oh, you know who he is.
I heard I used to hear him a long time ago, I think.
Right.
Anyway, I think you realize he's calling you now.
I think you know my voice already, right?
I didn't in the beginning, but now that you mention it.
Yeah, I've called you last time before pay stuff.
I wish you a happy pay stuff, and I wish you a happy spooas.
And I hope you ensure your blinces.
Well, as a matter of fact, that's going to be taffy subject on her last day today.
You should Gentile celebrate your vues.
Okay.
But I hope you enjoy your blinces.
Okay.
You too.
I'll be sure.
Okay.
Okay, by now.
Win is this.
Hmm.
Okay, 12 minutes before two at wins.
I think we ought to take our last break.
Are we going to do lots of locks?
Or is it looks?
Or we should do that one next?
Okay, somebody is out to lunch on the beach.
Hello.
Hi, how good afternoon, Neil.
Are you out to lunch?
Well, I'm on my lunch hour.
I'm out to lunch, no?
I'm not over bottomy like most of my amy beaches.
They're always out to lunch.
I personally want to congratulate you for the job you're doing.
I've gone from New York and I used to listen to how it's starting.
Yeah.
And you can beat them over the head.
That's why I mean, I run them over in public.
So, but you don't get down, Neil.
I take care of you.
Because they wait all day long.
I must tell you though, I must congratulate you.
You have opened up my mother's mind.
We have been trying to do it for years.
Yeah.
She now listens to you.
She's got a radio in every room.
Are you sure?
I'm programmed into her car radio.
Great.
Do you know anything?
And who knows?
She made this up a paper, but not the Miami Health.
And she told me that my grandfather, who was a freshman for 45 years,
when he came down here three or four times a year,
we never buy that paper.
He called it a scavenous paper.
That's a good word for it.
Yeah, well, definitely.
It's a polite word for it.
The strict that we pulled mother's day.
They picked the rascal house.
I didn't want to.
Oh boy.
They stood there in line and they wouldn't let him throw.
And I said, Ma, tell them you know Neil Rogers.
And those faces broke.
They were all waiting for the white little bag of rolls.
I heard a great line of puppinets.
And the woman said, Dear, can I have more roll?
These said show honey.
So there's just finished the one in your purse.
Oh, that's great.
Isn't that great?
That's excellent.
I mean, I went to high school down here, head over that, you know,
air against the wall.
Little people of little minds.
And I hope you do start a big movement.
Well, there are a lot of people in South Florida trying to start a big movement.
Some of them have been working on it for years.
Yes, I saw her problem.
I said, that's the biggest problem.
I know if you put it to a preparation,
H in the city of West of Russia,
three fourths in the state with this appear.
Yeah.
I really, but congratulations and don't give up.
Okay.
There are some people that have a brain.
Well, we're going to start a new movement.
It's called BM and the PM.
Ha, ha, ha.
You got it, Red Rider.
Okay, see you later.
Bye-bye.
Ten minutes before two at WYNZ.
Now can we take our break?
I mean, listen, you know, I'm cooperative.
I'll do whatever you say.
Thank you for new sweat.
Why should we got our bonus spotlight back in one piece again?
That's good.
That's excellent.
That can be the prune alert in a control room.
Very good.
That's the most expensive piece of equipment we've had put up there in a long time.
It's eight minutes before two at WYNZ, Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Yes.
Hi.
I think the picture of Pat Boone.
He can't blame anybody by himself because all those love letters he wrote to Stan.
If he were to know, he would have kept them a little shorter.
Maybe he wouldn't have wore it down to a nap.
Couldn't be any shorter than this, believe me.
In fact, he can only write parts of letters now.
Well, that's what happened.
He started in the 50s and then we got left.
You got it.
Okay.
I just want to write away.
Who do I send to to get a copy of it?
Okay.
Just send me a stamped self-adressed envelope to Boonebox.
Boonebox.
Okay.
Not Boone as an M like a radio, but Boonebox with an N's, care of Neil Rogers, WYNZ.
Right.
Miami 33055.
All right.
And trust me, it will be well worth the postage.
It will be a collective's item.
Oh, thank you.
Okay.
Homestead.
Hello.
Homestead is long gone.
Is there anybody else on it that we want to talk to?
No.
A lot of lines lit, but I guess we don't want to talk to any of them.
Okay, well listen, it's 6 before 2, so instead of talking to somebody, I guess we'll play something.
Huh?
A lot of lines on there, but according to Kyle, nobody that I want to talk to.
And if anybody knows, he knows.
Oh, I know what we ought to play that we haven't played all day today.
If I can find it.
Okay, this is like a countdown.
It's like seeing if can Neil find it in the rack before the show ends.
We've got to have some kind of a sound effect.
Oh, here it is.
Say no problem.
Just because we got 7,000 cards in here, no sweat.
It's late at night.
You're fast asleep and a shadowy figure is about to break into your home.
But you're protected.
Yes, it's the James Brown Home Security Alarm.
The heart is working alarm in the safety business.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh
Well, the James Brown, home security system
Jim Baker called me on the phone Sunday night May 17th
Two months had passed
He said, Jerry, I want to ask you to hand the ministry back to me as you promised in Palm Springs on March 17th
I said Jim, assuming it was being taped or someone might be listening in and it was for the record.
I said Jim, here's what I want to say to you.
I don't do my job as well when I'm constipated.
Okay, it's four and a half before two.
You realize we could get any shows out of that? Easy.
Starting yesterday, well let's see, that leaves us 78.
78 and a half because we haven't done nearly as much today as we should have done.
Okay, we're almost at the end of the line and I get two days off this weekend which is really exciting.
And I understand that Bill Carter is going to be making one of his rare public appearances at the track tomorrow.
And we're all looking forward to that.
I understand that there's a rumor going around that Mike Miller and his agent might show up there two tomorrow.
So we're really excited about that.
And I got the racing form.
Carter's going to have a nervous breakdown. When he finds out I understand through the grape fund that he's got our passes.
But I have in my hot little hand alongside my Pat Boone photos.
The daily racing form.
Beaton favorite in the first, the first time starter trained by Cam Gambalotti and written by.
Santiago Soto.
I'm not touting on these and just making noise on the arrow.
Okay, I'm just making little guttural sounds.
And of course here all of a call to his favorite horses Jose, hooray.
He's going to go nuts tomorrow. Happy gypsy, terriette secret.
Here's one for me, homo, adonis. That's a good one. That's one of my favorites.
They're all in there. And then in the eighth race, don't forget.
Don't forget if I can find it.
Perfect parade. Poor Doug Valliente boy got set down four races in a row.
And this was one of me one going away in a $25,000 allowance race on the grass.
And got set down. And this time he gets the services of her a burdo Castillo.
So perfect parade. I'm just again not touting. Don't get angry with me.
Okay. Just send in your losing tickets to Oliver North.
And we'll redeem them by sending him to Barbara Studdley.
Okay, that's going to do it. And we wish Taffy a good trip in Paris and the best of luck.
And the her audience out there. I know that they're going to be attacking me for the next two hours.
But that's where it is. You know, you've got to find somebody to blame.
There's always got to be a scapegoat. I'm responsible. Just remember if we have an earthquake,
if we have a hurricane heaven forbid, if it floods out in your backyard, if the electricity goes off,
no matter what it is, it's nils fault. Okay. And I accept responsibility.
I'm not even going to argue with those people because most of them are over the age of 200 anyway.
So I have a great time. We thank Mike Spindell for filling in tomorrow while we're out there just taking away
thousands from Calderon. We'll look for you Monday morning at 10 here on Wins.
