or 0707 the crankers in deer field are starting again at monkey business up there just amazing this morning
uh... the people seem to be getting ready for a wild weekend
a wild weekend of course this is the time of the year middle of the end of february in the first week in march that's the highlight that's it right that's the whole year in south Florida
and of course we go back to peace and tranquility and it's real quiet all the tourist go away
and all the college kids go up to Daytona and we can just you know we can just kind of shrivel up and die together and peace and quiet
there's something to be said for that isn't it and uh... i heard the fm blasting away up in the front into the atrium today so there's something going on up there that isn't quite kosher
what are they trying to do just get a last savor the last few uh... sounds of that music is at it
couldn't believe it i think it was right here that promotion often
it would have been great is a great instrumental trust me
and when you're a hundred years old the holland day old is the people there to go drive their stuff they'll fail
please give them caddies with their dashes to high they can't get around no matter how they try
blue hairs bow man all folks
there the birds they show her play by the year near their foes wanting anything that she's made about a silverware chain up the street and know where the condo's come and all his house the door it goes
big versus shopping bag
friends and names at grocery stores were ten things of a load don't stop the folks in now and there with their cars back up for load
they push and show them right at check in the rear of their way they drive over miles a trip the last all day
obnoxious roof folks
they listen to me a rageshow on wind radio
the end of the college to be comments from their mouth flow they fit to the down council about this awful mail
it's wonder when you rushes these things about how in there I won't tell you one thing I want to get caught there than I want now
bye now good luck

She never buys me a swim, never buys me a swim
