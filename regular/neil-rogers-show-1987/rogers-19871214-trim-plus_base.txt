But hey, good luck to you.
You have a very good vacation and don't let birds feel your show.
Thank you, sir. I reordered you.
Okay, and don't let birds feel your show.
Thank you, sir. I reordered you.
Okay, the masked marauder from Kendall. Hello.
Good morning.
Oh, wait a minute. Before we talk to the masked marauder,
you're never going to believe this is a true story.
I think I have the same one.
No, you don't.
I could. Is it about Steve's okay?
No.
Okay.
Yes.
Will you just control yourself for a moment, please?
Oh, is that the one about the restaurant?
Yes.
Oh, that's a great story.
Hold on a minute.
I was in Windixi.
My favorite Windixi yesterday briefly just to get a few items
and I'm, I had to get some bananas, okay?
And I'm, why do you look at me?
What are you going to do to those bananas?
Anyway, I had to get some fruit.
No, that's not any better.
Anyway, I had to get a couple items and I walk into the produce section
and you'll never guess who was there in a million years.
What couple was there?
Half of you McCallum and John Broward.
Worse.
Not the callers.
Worse.
Oh, God.
The least valorant owl.
Jamie and Marcy.
Jamie and Marcy and Windixi.
I don't think they even have a living plan, please.
They live in Hellendale.
So everybody now is flocking to my Windixi.
I can't believe it.
Okay, I'm sorry.
What were you doing?
That was worth waiting for.
By the way, where are those numbers?
Well, there is.
I don't know why they say they're still new and I have no idea.
What do you mean they're in there?
Well, we don't want to get there in there, but they...
I don't know why you can't get them till noon.
Do you have any predictions?
Wait a minute.
Let's put it this way.
I don't want to get your hopes up too high.
No.
But I noticed that both of you are kind of calm
and not mentioning about that tonight because it's a big day for everybody, isn't it?
It is.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's not that big for us because they're not expecting all that much yet.
How much are they expecting?
And I'll tell you, higher or lower.
Oh, looking somewhere in the twos.
Well, hopefully it would be in the twos.
Yeah, I think I don't think...
What do you mean hopefully it would be in the twos?
We had a one-night last time and we inherited that August that was dreads got to be above a two.
Yeah, as far as I see it's at least doubled.
It's at least doubled?
Oh, that'd be great.
See, that whole thing is last time I saw something like that last month
and like there was something totally different.
I don't know, I don't know exactly.
If you give me the instructions, I'll just have some instructions over there.
No, I can't go back to the computer and give you the instructions.
Mark, you don't have an nervous breakdown.
Well, because I just don't know how to use this thing to its fullest potential.
Well, listen, you've got a lot of things you don't know how to use that are fullest potential, you know?
And hopefully you won't be the one to show.
You can bet your life I won't.
Trust me.
Okay, now, I have some material for you today.
Oh, I hear that one of the board ops from WSNEWS, my scientist.
Oh, none of the trust me.
Okay.
That's for our girlfriend, EVET.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay, now I have some material for you.
I remember to tell you about the one about Steve Cain.
Yes.
The restaurant.
Did you already tell that to the board?
No, I haven't told that yet.
Okay.
Are you going to tell her or just threaten to tell her?
I'll tell it to you.
Anyways, I'm not sure what the name of the restaurant was, but our good friend Steve Cain went to a restaurant.
And he ran up $130 bills.
That's the same amount you had?
Yes, it was.
Okay.
I know who you heard this from, too.
And at the end, he wanted, obviously, the leech one.
I told the waitress, I'm Steve Cain.
The guy who talks about rest, the hunt on W, you tell her, the she said so.
So he said, you know, call over your manager.
He told the same thing to the manager.
She said so.
And then he left paying the $130 bills to lift the waitress.
Yeah.
He was very upset that he had a pay.
In other words, the point is he was looking for a freebie.
And he didn't get it.
So then he left no tip on a $130 check.
How do you like that?
What a guy.
Yeah.
All hard.
Now, I have a treat for you today.
Just don't know where to begin.
Okay.
I just was a joke.
I was at some place and I called up 800 information.
And like, you know how you, when you call these people, you have to tell me you're on the air.
Yep.
And I told him I was jacked from Miami Beach on Zeta.
And we wanted to know why our 800 number wasn't list.
Anyways, that could be real funny, but I know if you wanted to do that.
And they were patching me into the supervisor and she says, oh, I don't want to be on Zeta.
She doesn't like you and all that other kind of stuff.
Oh.
She doesn't like whom he?
Yeah, but the supervisor.
Well, let her drop dead, okay?
Okay.
Now, let her stick her where the moan don't shine.
You know you're a good friend of my clients, right?
Mm-hmm.
He wrote you a jingle and I have it on tape.
Okay.
But now he says that he's, I have to call him up and see if you want to sing it live or should I play that to you on tape?
Now, play the tape.
Okay.
You shouldn't go.
You ready?
Yeah.
I hope it's more exciting than this call so far.
Well, I have the mother stuff I can't play.
Ah, I can play by Glenn Haraping Barbie.
I have not.
Yes, he is.
She called me up and played with you.
He left 50 trolling messages on her machine.
Well, that's not harassing her if I leave messages on her machine.
Oh, boy.
Now, he wanted to know when I come over and all that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Well, you're the one that instigated it.
I think it's wonderful.
More power to help you.
Yeah.
Okay.
You ready?
Yeah, obviously.
We're ready.
Here you go.
Sounds good so far.
Hold on.
Here it is.
Two, three.
18 to eight.
Oh, how I love you.
In the morning.
You're watching on Maradio.
I'll give you an excuse with all of my rights.
You're watching on Maradio.
Your maintain comes to the answer to every little sweet thing that won't be true.
It's male on 949, the largest on Maradio.
The music, key, Miami Beach, Miami.
Where's J-Michael's when you need it?
That's right.
I'm going to get J-Michael's boom box so they can make sweet music together, okay?
Okay.
Some media instructions.
You have my address.
Okay.
Okay.
Have a wonderful life, sir.
The SEC is cracking.
J-Dome.
I'm a J-Dome.

Like my choice of now.

Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster.
It's 744 on Zeta 4.
You have the feeling we lost control of the show last couple of calls.
Is that just my imagination?
Everything is out of control.
Oh, yeah.
Excellent.
That's wonderful.
Okay, and the phones are flashing like crazy.
And those numbers are going to be out later in the day.
Now, what was he talking about?
Like we're supposed to have an apoplectic fit about it on the air?
About what?
About those numbers.
I mean, what can we do at this point?
Numbers.
Numbers are numbers.
It's all over.
And his prediction is that they will double.
Wrong.
There's just no chance.
All right.
If they do, that would be very nice.
But I don't do that.
I think those would be a little high expectations.
Always remember, the set your sights low.
Mm-hmm.
And anything that happens above that is a bonus.
It's a bonus.
That's what Mark Cune has always said.
He sets his sights real low over on the AM.
And I think for this particular rating period,
he probably made the right decision.
You know what I mean?
Like fractions.
That's where he set his sights.
And that morning news.
Now, have we still not heard?
It's a 746 on a Monday morning on Zeta 4.
We have yet to hear.
We've been asking for days from anyone who has ever, I mean,
even by accident, heard just moments of the morning news with Mike and Arlene on WINZ AM.
And we still haven't heard a peep.
Why do you think that is?
I don't know, but there's a problem there.
We don't know for sure what it is.
But now, as I said, we could be wrong.
It could be that they're all very loyal.
Sure.
Wins listeners, and they're not turning over to right.
So they're not here.
That's correct, that's a possibility.
It's a logical thing.
Very unlikely.
Very unlikely.
In other words, somebody.
Somebody who was, I mean, they started 530.
Well, now we got a call from Richard Vega.
Now he's heard the show.
Yeah, and you heard what he said about it.
Everybody listens to this show.
Cross section of humanity.
To what show?
Teenagers to old folk.
Listen to this show.
Lawyers, junkies.
Everybody listens.
Yeah, you know about the junk.
Okay, we have an open line today.
Somebody just to drop it off there.
And I can't say that I blame them 620 3600.
620 3600.
After the news, by the way, we're going to hear John, what's his name?
Jonathan King.
Yeah, John Broward.
John King.
Jonathan King and he's so fine again, because I just got to get that back on.
Okay.
And we're also going to hear a bad finger.
Mm-hmm.
You found it?
Isn't it a miracle that we have that in our library?
Oh, I watched the Godfather over the weekend.
What did you?
How did you like it?
That reminded me when you said library, because that's one of the lines in the movie that James
Khan says.
Yeah.
I tell you, part one is incredible.
Yeah, part two.
It's great.
Yeah, but it's not a big part.
Part one is the definitive movie.
It will.
It's Cosmolar and Brando's and it will have cotton stuffed in his tube.
Somebody stuffed a 50 pound water cotton in your tube.
It's part like you're a constipated tube.
It's the Joseph Goodness.
The opening scene is when he's sitting behind the desk playing with the cat.
Wonderful.
I watched part one Saturday and part two Sunday and wonderful weekend.
Yeah, the one Sunday at the media house for a cup of coffee.
But you were afraid that the city would win.
Movie making at its best.
That my friend, Godfather, he's my ring.
That interesting.
I like the Godfather and the Pope have that in common.
They both want everybody to kiss their ring.
The other coincidence.
Do you think?
I was going to say they're both from Italy, but this Pope is from Poland.
That's your hit.
But lives in Italy.
Do you think he's connected?
Anyway, if you can catch it on HBO, part one is a must.
Part two is nice.
Fascinating, but part one is the definitive.
But you got to admit that part two is the best sequel of a movie that was ever made.
Usually part two is a really inferior to the original.
Part two is fascinating.
Was it as good as the Silicon?
Part of a head of an Italian movie set in Silicon Valley in California.
That's strange, isn't it?
Oh my goodness.
Okay, let's take another call.
I will do the news.
And then we've got all kinds of stuff to do here today.
We have an open line in Dave County, which seems to be part of the course this morning.
How come we don't hear from more of our Latin listeners?
I have no idea.
Do you think that Zeta 4 has a big Latin audience?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just asking for an opinion.
I don't know.
I really can't say.
There isn't any particular reason why we should, is there?
No, there isn't.
In other words, no key out of this question.
No, no, no.
Unlikely.
It's incredibly.
It would be incredibly if we did, because we just don't play any music that relates to the Hispanic audience.
It's just like we don't play any music that relates to the Black audience.
What is it?
We want this like wasp audience.
We want all glam too, is that it?
Do we want any Jews just a couple?
Just a few to round it out a little bit?
That's right.
That's right.
We got the soul patrol.
We could have like the Latin quarters.
Yeah, and the kosher corner.
Broward County.
Hello.
Hey, same to you.
Happy Chanukah.
Hey, I'd like to commend you on what you're doing for the Camila's house.
I think it's really great.
Yeah, and the mail really picked up today.
I was very happy about that.
Yeah, it shows you a really good person behind that cynical exterior.
You got it.
That's right.
Well put.
Way deep down inside somewhere, there's something good.
Yeah, even though you try to hide it.
Nobody's founded yet, but when they do, boy, it'll be great.
I was wondering if you had that Christmas song by the McKenzie Brothers.
The one that goes through the Christmas where it gets a beer?
That may be around here somewhere.
Yeah, we'll have to do it, try to dig it up.
Not sure.
Great.
Yeah.
I like that song.
Good.
And listen, I wanted to ask you to quit picking on people from the silly,
just because Joey Reynolds is from there, doesn't mean we're all bad.
Okay.
Well, listen, there probably one or two good apples in that bunch.
Yeah, it's got a lot of history.
Two hundred years ago, there was a lot going on up there,
and down here was only swamp land.
That's right.
And some of the garbage from two hundred years ago is still lying on the streets there.
It's incredible.
Yeah.
And all the Indians are lying under the glades.
Yeah, like I said, Wilson Good had the right idea.
He just stopped too soon.
This Wilson Good.
He'd be the mayor of Philadelphia.
Yeah, right now, well, I haven't been there in about 12 years.
Well, that's good.
Believe me, you don't want to go back.
Okay, just savor those great memories.
Okay.
So, boobs are nice.
Right.
Like way out, like Pittsburgh.
Yeah.
And have a food.
And get these burgs.
Yeah.
And Utica.
Okay, listen, have a wonderful day, but the news be coming up next.
You know what I mean?
Have a good holiday.
You too.
Bye, boy.
7.51 at Zeta 4.
Frank Sinatra is playing Santa.
7.56 on Zeta 4.
And also remind me, Captain Dave, we have to talk about that picture taking session that was scheduled for tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, we're not going to do that.
No, we're going to take a car wash, man.
Yeah, it is the car wash man.
How you doing?
He's doing great.
Anyway, wash my car.
The wind's going to be paintless.
No, that's true.
They don't want to wash mine either because it's too dirty.
Anyway, getting back to where I was only moments ago.
Sorry.
What was I saying?
Oh, yeah, something about that picture taking session.
Also, you notice when the news comes on, like we had all the lines lit up.
Look at that phone now.
Isn't that amazing?
Like everybody just disappears.
Think a few had to go to work.
A few of them probably had to go to school or work, which is a pretty damn lame excuse as far as I'm concerned.
Anyway, 620, 3600 and Dave and 7779, 3600 and Broward.
This is the sparsest this phone has ever been since we sat down here.
I can't, they're like two calls on at Bordnock.
I can't believe it.
Is that incredible or what?
And, huh?
Well, yeah, another starting up again.
But, you know, we may have to play something here, like music.
And that sends a boy like crazy what do you know?
All you would be rip off artists.
And that's the end of only living away.
This is just a metal time I see you.
Jesus, don't spoke to God.
What is my life?
You're often seen happy as time.
It makes me want something to find.
You should even give him the drive.
But then again, you can't shine.
You can't shine, wait forever.
And I'm gonna make him mine.
If it takes me forever and ever and ever.
He's so fine, Georgia.
He's gotta think of mine, Georgia.
Sooner or later, Georgia.
I hope it's not for later.
We got together.
Georgia.
The sun and the moon.
Georgia.
I do get wait.
I do get wait.
To be held in his arms.
See a court.
If I were a court.
And he has to leave my place.
I do anything that he has.
And it's a thing to make him tall.
For he's so fine, so fine.
So fine, so fine.
So fine, so fine.
So fine, so fine.
So fine, so fine.
So fine, so fine.
Jonathan King, that's number two already with six bullets and rising rapidly to the top.
Can you believe that by ten o'clock this morning?
Is there any doubt that that'll be the number one hit on Zeta 4?
It's eight o'clock here on a Monday morning.
It's time for the ID captain, Meng.
You smell that?
I love the smell of Neil Rogers cold in the morning.
It's a smell of an arbitrage victory.
This is WZTA, Miami Beach, or Vlada del, or bomb beaches.
Sorry, command of Neil Rogers.
And his attache, Glenn, and Burger Hill.
And your sportsman will turn internal Dave.
Boy, that exciting or what?
I thought that was appropriate for today.
Why is that?
You know, victory.
I don't want you, you know, everybody here is acting like we're going to have an 18 share or something
when he's never, first of all, it's only two thirds of a rating period, number one.
And secondly, you know, we have a lot of work to do here yet.
We started at ground zero.
Everybody is impatient.
Yeah, have you noticed?
This is a whole different ball game, okay?
Yeah, I know that.
And we want your best when things are not running smoothly.
Oh, well, then we have to do great.
Really great, because based on the first few weeks here, especially the last couple of weeks,
man, talk about running smoothly.
Now, wow, I have something to read to you.
Are you sitting down?
Yes.
Do I look like I'm sitting down?
Do I look like I shrunk a few inches over the weekend?
Radio highlights for today out of the Miami Herald.
Do they be good?
Steve Cain, 2PMWIOD, representative James Burke, and John Broward.
Oh, the Scuss.
Jesse Jackson.
Oh, the Scuss, Jesse Jackson again.
What is there to discuss?
This is the second show he's done this Scuss and Jesse Jackson.
I'm saying there would be one thing if he had Jesse on the show.
That would be bad enough, but the Scussing, Jesse Jackson again.
This man is so desperate for a show.
You know, we owe somebody an apology.
You know who it is?
Wait a minute.
Like I said, you owe somebody an apology.
You know who it is?
Stan Major.
He's talking about Stan Major.
Because all these, you know, all this crap about how he needs to get a show, okay?
And there's certainly an element of truth in that because he keeps ripping me off and just talking about me.
And if it isn't Miami Vice or Don Johnson, it's Near Rogers, but...
But.
Yeah.
Everything's relative.
Exactly. And at least Stan is listenable and you have some fun with him.
I mean, the guy isn't doing the same old, tired, hackneyed crap that he's been doing for years like some other people in this market that we know and love, right?
One of whom you just mentioned.
You know, I'm so sorry last week that I missed the 850th show.
And who was it that he had all last week that killed me at an appleplex?
It's every week, I don't know.
Oh yeah, he had Jack Lieberman on again for the five billionth time.
And that's just this year.
And the year's not over yet.
I wonder what day he's having Michael Desisto on this week.
I'm looking forward to the wrestling show.
Oh, sure.
This man.
And they're actually paying this guy.
Now here comes another guy who is that Gary Lawrence in his $75,000 BMW at 804.
What the hell is he doing here at this hour the morning?
Let's hear it for Gary, boy.
He really puts in those hours.
Doesn't he'll be gone by three?
He really he puts it his time, man.
And by the time he finishes with his place, he ought to be putting in time.
Just in joke, Gary.
It's just a joke.
And who is somebody other these other original people like Alice Rantell,
who was doing that thing with the attorney Richard Essen?
Today, Alice's guest is Steve Sonsky, my old TV critic.
And I think back to when I was on at night,
in the early days of the daytime, although thank God very quickly I woke up and smelled the flowers and the pansies.
But you know, you come up with Tom,
and I'm not saying these are bad people, but I'm just saying the repetition.
Tom Jicca and the nutritionist.
And then there's Mike Spindell with a veterinarian.
I mean, if he has Jan Bellows on again, one more time, this decade.
Next week.
Oh, no, are you serious?
Oh, no.
Overrant, overrant, over the same tried and true boring terminal repetitive guests.
You know, you're right, of course, what you say, you're absolutely right.
But it bothers me.
And it bothers me.
And Bob Kunst and Ellis Rubin and these Janet Reno and the same monotonous boring Ed Cohen.
My good dear personal friend.
Yeah, right.
Remember who, uh, it's whenever we, you notice, I want to, this is an interesting point.
I'm about, excuse me for interrupting, but I'm worked up to an apoplectic frenzy at this point.
Do you notice how all of a sudden when things change and people know that they're not going to be on your show anymore?
That some of your good friends start turning a little bit.
No.
You know what I'm saying?
Like on AM when I cut out the guests, all of a sudden my good close personal friend Ed Cohen starts writing hostile things in the,
in such a prestigious journal as the West Kendall, Ben Zet, about the near Rogers show.
What a waste.
What, you know, it's such a waste that I'm entertaining people instead of bringing a boring washed out old man on the, like him to put the audience into a coma, right?
And the same over here now that we're not in all of a sudden Tom Jicca.
Oh, I don't get up at six in the morning.
Listen to him.
No, because Tom is too busy listening to Mike Reneerie pick his nose and I OD, okay?
Why did you, as soon as I said that, you started wiping your nose.
Coincidence.
But what, and you notice the pattern, how the, the turn on you, these people?
Yeah, you know, everything you say, all they want to do is use you.
They're all horrors.
Don't you want to understand all of these people are horrors, all these talk show guests, horrors.
And you, and you, you, you nurture them and you develop them and you bring them on and you make them into again.
All of a sudden they're like on every damn show in town, everywhere, like the plague.
Can I get this one more time?
What are they again?
I don't, horrors.
Oh, we got two mobile calls.
Mobile.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I just kneel.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, well, I heard you before you said that you didn't have any Latin, you know, listen.
Well, I didn't say we'd have any, but I was just curious if we have many.
Well, I want to give you a play, a meringue gate for me on here.
Johnny Ventura.
He's a very popular meringue gate player.
And I, you know, we want to get the Latin market.
No, not that bad.
At that bad?
No.
Well, someone turned me on to you and they said you would do it.
They said I would do what?
I might do it, but not that.
You're a funny man, you know.
I know.
Oh, God.
You love the show, don't you?
I really do.
I really do.
And how about your other Hispanic friends, my friend?
Oh, when they out of jail, they listen to it.
In jail, they cannot listen to it.
I know it doesn't penetrate those prison walls, does it?
Oh, it doesn't get up to Atlanta.
We've been trying.
Atlanta.
You got to check on Atlanta.
Another radio shack on Tennis, the big ones.
Yeah, I sure do.
Yeah, but we couldn't, we couldn't listen to it.
We tried, but we couldn't, we got Y-100.
Yeah, that'll do it.
Sunny Fox, man, he's big in prison.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
He dresses up as a woman.
Yeah, well, he's got a lot of experience, you know.
Really?
Listen, Neil, one more thing.
Yes, sir.
What do you think about the dolphin yesterday?
How about that?
What a division, huh?
They're seven and six and they're tied for first place.
What a great division.
Is it true that Roby's going to move the team over to Cuba?
Yeah, Roby Young.
Yeah.
They're going to build a stadium for him.
Right.
Have a wonderful day, sir.
You have a great life, Neil.
You too.
Okay.
Boy, boy.
Well, it's too distinctive to see how easily he's convinced.
Now, I just made that up.
Yeah, it's too small.
He's gone.
Okay, you know, if you've got a 2-5, that's okay.
Now, we don't know that we got a 2-5.
That's just he just read some numbers off.
But they happen to be 1, 2, 1, 9, 2-5.
That sounds like they fit into this time slot.
Sure it does.
And if that's the case, that means we did over a three in the month of November.
Like maybe well over a three, right?
The decimal point is in the right place.
Now, if it's like 0.25, he's used to that.
There's no problem.
There's no pressure.
Just like home.
Yeah.
Well, one thing about being consistent, there's something to be said for it.
Okay, it's 947 on Zade and now do we want to take, are you going to do news?
If you, if you, well, one thing about being consistent, there's something to be said for it.
Okay, it's 947 on Zade and now do we want to take, are you going to do news?
If you, if you like, what do we got?
How much do we got left?
Because I have no idea what you're doing in there and I guess that makes two of us, right?
See he's on the phone again.
Should I play that thing on the phone again?
Because he won't get off the phone.
Why are you going to get off the phone?
Because I think what have we got three minutes?
We have three minutes, right?
What is he, he just, he will not pay attention to me now.
Why don't I just do the weather?
You don't want to do the news?
I'll be glad to.
Whatever you want.
We have time for it.
Okay.
What?
He's back on the phone again.
He's telling me, you know, he was just, you know, so he doesn't know for sure.
I said, I told you that already that you don't know.
We're not going to hold a gun to his head.
I know. I think he's just a little worried that he was.
Maybe he was chast.
But not his head.
Not to his head.
Because what's there to blow out in his head, right?
There's nothing there.
Okay. Don't panic, cake.
Just relax.
Whatever you say.
You know, we're patient.
We can wait.
And if that's what it was, that'd be it.
That would be great.
That would be just fine with me.
I'm not going to hold you to it.
No.
And if it's anything lower than that, then look out.
Because I know where you live.
948 now on state of four.
And the man who used to be bodyguard for it.
