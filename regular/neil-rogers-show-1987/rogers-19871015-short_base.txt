If you could tell me the next time Stan made this going to be at the house, I'm going to bring over an exorcist and get that Miami Vice-Sort of
He was disgusting.
I hate him.
I mean, just because you're not there to discipline him, he went overboard.
Is he back on that crap again?
Oh, yeah.
He played Don Johnson, he was rolling on the floor, he was making strange sounds.
Yeah.
Our stars are saying stop them, please.
Well, me, I've tried talking to him for months about it.
He's obsessed, sir.
But you got to hear him.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
That is a good idea.
Thanks, human.
That tape you play with that weapon stuff.
Yeah.
You got to hear him like that.
There you go.
Sounds like a good idea.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
The Stan Major Cure.
Oh.
Oh.
There you go.
Okay, so you have a wonderful day.
Thanks a lot.
Oh.
No changes, man.
The only problem is he'd enjoy it.
Yeah, it's a good thing, very good.
You know, the fantasizing that Don is doing the whip.
Oh, Don, whip me.
I can't stand it.
Come on, Stan.
Vouch up a little, will you, please.
