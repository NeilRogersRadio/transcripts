Well, the closest we have to that is RBD and Broward, which we can't get in date.
And then there's WHR, which used to be 98 gold, which I hear again is changing format,
but right now they're playing this hard and soul syndicated stuff, which is a lot of
old Motown, that kind of era, which I happen to enjoy, but I can't get the signal in
day county.
There's a rhythm 98, which is a small station which actually exists in South Day.
There again, there are a lot like EDR, a little bit more R&B, but you can't get them
passed like Query Gables.
So what is the problem there?
Do you think something like that would be marketable?
Or am I just dreaming?
Am I going to have it?
I think that if it was a format of soul and rhythm and blues, like you're speaking about,
that it would have a crossover audience.
Okay, nine minutes before noon at WYNC, we have a caller in a mobile phone for Linda.
I can't believe it.
Hello.
RoNeal?
Yes.
How's it going?
Hi, Linda.
Hi.
I read your column off of that.
Wait a minute, sir.
You don't sound like you're on a mobile phone to me.
I got off the mobile phone.
I got home, put it on hold and picked it up.
You're hanging up on me now.
What a story that is, even the people at the Harold wouldn't believe that.
Tom Peeler has been following you around.
I probably won't read it.
Go ahead, sir.
We'll give it a shot.
Okay.
You just have mobile phone to give it up.
I'm following the epsilon.
The situation with all these different radio stations changing format.
I just want to know some of your comments and what you think is calling on seems like
that hot 105 is really bowed out.
Well, they don't have any choice, really.
It looks like power 96.
It's just that formula.
It seems to be right on.
Yeah, the dance music format, which goes for EDR2 in a way, because a lot of their stuff
is the same kind of rhythm.
It's very popular here right now.
But again, with so many people doing it, somebody's got to lose and hot did.
Since then, they've veered a little more.
You hear more crossover.
Right.
I just can't put it.
It's like 100 power 96 and hot.
Very, very similar.
I just don't see.
Who do you think the loser is going to be at the most three?
That's hard to say about hot format right now.
Why 100 came back up in this last book after like two years?
They bought some of the audience back.
They think that was due a lot to that content.
Well, yeah, the content set a lot to do with it, but also their sound is a lot more firm
than it was for a while.
It really seems like 10 is going to be better.
Excuse me?
I said it really seems like 10 has got the formula down.
Yeah, he does.
It's working for him over there.
Both everyone in these radio stations know it's continuing over power 96.
That's the one I prefer personally.
Power?
Yeah, it's just like they really have the personalities.
Power has like one thing good about power too is they have a very energetic presentation.
That's right.
I think, you know, it's like listening to the old days to me in 70s radio when why 100
was real when I was a teenager.
You kind of get that feeling from power, which is good.
That's the funny thing is that they're the upstart, but yet they have the veterans.
That's true.
Yeah, let me let me let you in on little secret power radio in this market sucks, okay?
You think so?
Yeah.
Does that include your show?
No.
On the radio, aren't you?
Well, no, we're on pop-up toasters in the golden fillings.
That's the thing.
Okay, thank you so much for your call.
Have a wonderful life.
Hollywood, hello.
Oh, Neil?
Yes.
I'd like to ask you a Linda question.
I'd like to know what the ratings are on top net.
Too high.
I think that that.
49.
49.
The ratings on top net were pretty high.
I can't believe that.
I'm talking.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can't believe that.
I can give you an answer based on a life experience.
I mean, what is it with this guy?
How many bad things have happened to me?
I know.
You guys good.
We ought to put him on on the weekend.
You're pretty good, sir.
He must have been screwed left and right.
I mean, you know, I haven't screwed a lot.
Maybe I can get on top.
I don't know.
Really?
Even that or the Harold can follow you around.
You can get on the front page.
I just was curious because I wasn't to you in a daytime.
And I really enjoy your show.
But since you've been off at night, there's nothing to listen to.
I mean, Jerry Wichner is passetically boring.
How about Bill Calder's on a night now?
I don't want to promote other videos.
Yeah, Calder's on a night.
Yeah, Calder's on a night.
Notice that Jerry can't even see the station call letters, right?
Who?
Jerry.
Jerry.
Can't even say a letter.
Jerry illiterate.
He doesn't say WN.
WN.
WN, WS.
Yeah, Glenn Hill does that, too.
He says WNZ.
What is it, Gaker?
What are these people come from?
So call the ship and you're headed by.
You do use a WNZ.
Well, listen, I have the numbers in front of me now.
It's from seven o'clock now.
Four notes.
That's fine.
They went with three, four, four, one, three, nine,
and then after ten o'clock, which Sally's on a 10, right?
Oh, God.
Oh, yeah.
Five, two, eight, nine, nine, six at midnight,
but she got beat out.
They do embarrassingly well.
They do embarrassingly well.
And Jerry, which one?
Sally's voice says like she guard us with all razor blades.
I love that gravelly voice, sir.
Okay, I got to get another call on here, sir,
but thank you so much for your call and have a great day.
Oh, thank you so much for letting me be on.
Okay, please call us again.
I have a spare time.
Okay, Davey, hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay.
Hi.
Listen, I was listening to WS News the other day right before the big change.
Yeah.
And where they were feeling the change.
And he made a big thing about the so far campaign
and how you were just pandering to your audience.
Oh, yeah.
And attempting to get rating.
Oh, it's helping to get ratings?
Yeah, it's a really exciting thing.
It's just what he said.
And then, you know, right afterward, I almost couldn't believe this,
but I had to call you and let you know.
They have an interior design center over there that they do live spots for.
And he said that this interior design firm was like losing interest.
Oh, I heard that.
Oh, my God.
Am I glad you brought this up?
It's Miriam and Tyr ears.
And he said, please call him and tell him.
Call him, yes.
I was the most bushling thing I ever heard in my life.
He's begging the audience to call him and tell him not to cancel their advert time.
It's exactly right.
I'm Miriam and Tyr ears.
I actually could not believe that.
I'm going to call you and let you know.
And the only thing I want for it is please a few seconds of a Craig Worthing imitation.
I love it.
So we don't knock on this show.
We only do positive.
If Steve wants to come on this show and knock Neil, he'll have to go on with Alan.
Do it.
We don't do that on this show.
I love it.
Have a good day.
Am I glad that he brought that up because I heard it the other day.
I thought, wait a minute.
This can't really be going on.
He's during the live spot.
He's saying they're thinking of cancelling.
Please call him right now and he kept giving the number.
He says, even if you're not going to buy anything, call him and tell him to keep advertising
on a leaf-fowler show because I need the money.
He didn't say why.
They were thinking about cancelling.
Well, what do you think?
You know, there's only one reason that sponsors cancells.
No results.
I didn't hear that.
No response.
Non-competes penis.
I mean, that's what it's all about, Lee.
Okay, anyway, thank you very much for being here.
Please come back.
Thank you so much for the pleasure of your company and for your call.
I'll be here on the 16th.
I hope.
Great.
That's good.
We can get some coverage in that if the hero doesn't censor it.
Speaking of that, now listen, we've got something for-
