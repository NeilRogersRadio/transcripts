I run my bike 30 miles every Saturday to the list.
And this guy calls me names.
Shame on you, sir.
Shame on you.
By the way, have you seen some of those bad boys at the new AMP?
No, what are you cackling about?
A, good.
This is my gun.
A million producers in the world.
And they stick me in here with an A.
Shut it, my god.
Semicar castle.
Hello.
How many?
You're supposed to be such a nice boy.
And now you're so terrible.
Yeah, but you can't share it off.
You can't share it off.
I don't need this.
I have offers from other stations.
Patavia, Almira, Fredonia.
But instead, I stay here and entertain you grotesque sub-human dutabag.
Unbelievable.
Geneva, hello.
Hello, is this Neil Rogers?
What kind of phone are you on, sir?
How's that again?
Do you have a dial phone or a watt?
No, I have to put it to the operator.
Let's...
Let's...
Let's not get into that.
Hey, I was listening to Joey Reynolds on WKBW last night.
Somebody asked you.
Did you hear what he's been saying about you?
No, I don't listen anymore.
He's a daughtering old man.
He claims he's only 40.
Yeah, right.
And do we be true in two?
Oh, shut up.
And you're up a stomach.
And if you think he's bad now, wait until he hatches.
Oh, boy.
Okay, when we come back, maybe the egg will come out of his shell.
But I hope not.
Little radio history there.
Sell them heard before.
And you heard it first on Zeta4.
7-14 on a Friday morning.
And our next caller is probably in Broward County, disappeared.
Hello, are you there?
I can't believe it. He held on.
Frightening.
Go ahead.
First lead.
What?
First lead.
Where is Lee?
First complaint.
How long have you been listening, sir?
Four days.
No, no, I mean this morning.
How long have you been listening?
About ten minutes.
Oh, okay. Well, we owe him an explanation, right?
Right.
What is the explanation?
Lee's just not here anymore.
This was not his bag.
I got a brain on your bloody side.
Oh, that was good.
I like that.
That was my favorite call of the whole week.
Where's the Greek progresses?
You notice we're getting some good ones.
Yeah.
Okay, no, Lee actually got jealous when David Cohen came in and he asked his where it was.
And he couldn't handle it.
Couldn't handle the pressure.
Okay, let's go to Dave County.
Hello.
Morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
Maybe you can clarify something for me.
That's got through his voice so well.
You know, it's frightening.
This guy is Dan.
Stan, who?
And Major.
Oh, yeah.
He keeps talking about this guy Don Johnson.
Who the hell is Don Johnson?
I don't know.
Never heard of him.
Unbelievable.
Yeah. You can say it again, sir.
You see the paper this morning?
What paper?
Um, hell.
No, I don't read there.
It's right here, but I won't even touch it.
Man, sexual priest is living a living contradiction.
A what?
Man, sexual priest.
Yeah.
You turned into a woman now.
Great.
Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways, sir.
It's a miracle.
It's a miracle.
See?
Yeah, Jose became Juanita, I think.
Yeah.
Is that it, sir?
Well, could you play that on?
Oh, here we go.
Let's see.
Yeah.
Now, this is a textbook case for the audience.
It's the pattern.
textbook case.
Go ahead.
What is it?
The one of Elvis with addiction.
Everybody wants to be Elvis.
Elvis impersonators.
Oh, yeah.
That's in the other room.
You think I'm going to go schlep all the way in the other room to get that?
We'll see what happens, sir.
We'll give it a shot.
Okay, 550, 9490.
If you can get through on this ridiculous phone system, 550...
Well, we don't want to belly ache about it too much, but it sucks.
It's the bottom line.
550, 9490.
And Boka, of course, sitting there very silently.
In fact, there's several of the lines on it, but we probably be a reason for that, right?
What could that be?
Well, we don't want to go into that again.
That's not good, carried away.
Okay, 17 past seven, and we'll go back to date County.
Good morning.
Hi.
Hi, how you doing?
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
First time I spoke to you on your new program.
Aren't you lucky, huh?
How are you?
How's everything good?
Great.
We're just so thrilled and here you wouldn't believe it.
It's hard to hear on the phone, you mean?
With you, yeah.
I can't really hear you.
Well, that's your idea.
Oh, is that it?
Yeah, that way we can throw a few insults, and nobody picks them up.
Let me ask you something.
Yeah.
Is that really Ron Harris and that they gave the news today?
What?
Is that really Ron Harris and that gave the sports earlier?
No.
Oh, you mean Mr. Sports?
Well, you know you said Ron Harris said what?
No, Ron was just hanging around in here.
He had nothing to do.
He sounded terrible on the phone.
He has scoured the newspaper.
What sounded terrible?
This boy, if it sounded like he had a six-chain.
He did.
Oh, he did.
He had to beg one.
He had to beg one.
Not anymore, though.
I don't know whether we should go back to the old format, but did you watch it not landing?
Oh, I forgot all about it.
No, I would actually...
Oh, God!
What happened?
I went to bed early because I had all those phone calls.
Every time I tried to take an apios today, the phone kept ringing.
Oh!
And I went to bed at nine o'clock.
Oh, my God.
Well, what happened?
They arrested the Abbey.
Really?
Yeah.
And then they finally...
Well, I won't go through the hole.
Oh, here he comes at...
Get his mic off.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay.
Ignore him.
But they finally decided...
And it was like it was Gary that did.
That he realized that Olivia was...
...thought her mother did it.
And that's really Abbey thought.
Olivia did it.
Yeah.
And...
Well, on that show, everybody does it.
Huh?
I said on that show, everybody does it.
But Paige, she's having bad dreams.
And I think, Mac or father is becoming very suspicious of her.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
So, listen, I won't go into the whole detail.
But make sure you watch it next week.
Wait until next week when the Ville Parmigian twins come knocking at Abbey's door.
That's going to be something.
You watch.
Good luck on your program.
First time I've listened to it.
Thank you.
Thank you, love.
Have a nice day.
You too.
Bye-bye.
Okay, see, that's the first time she's listened.
So she got a little confused when she heard Mr. Sport.
Yeah.
She thought it was Ron Harrison after his sex change.
And actually, Ron Harrison is Arlene Raw.
She's not aware of that.
After the change.
All this confusion is understandable.
Sure.
Easy for you to say.
Okay, it's almost 720 and I guess we might as well do it.
And that vocal line is, you know, I just can't relate to that.
I can't relate to it.
I'm going to put like Scotch tape over it so I don't have to look at it.
5509490, it will take loads of calls today.
And, you know, a lot of people have called and said, where is the music?
It's almost 720, I'd say to four.
Rough scene in Miami last night, a four-year-old boy,
apparently thought a loaded 38 caliber revolver was a toy.
Shot and killed his four-year-old sister.
This accident occurring when David Dallas and his sister Maggie were at the family-owned Dallas security firm.
Metro-Date Police said the boy picked up the gun.
Shot his sister in the head.
Maggie Dallas pronounced dead later at a Miami Children's Hospital.
After spending more than two hours yesterday, before a grand jury investigating the famous suitcase,
Dave County manager Sergio Pereira says he feels victimized by the man who sold him stolen goods,
because Pereira said he bought them in good faith.
NFL strike has ended.
However, it appears replacement players will again be used in this weekend's games.
And once again, the USS become a target in the Persian Gulf.
No indication yet how it will respond to today's attack.
This time, the target, a U.S. flag, Kuwaiti tanker.
And we have an accident northbound on I-95 this morning.
This is near the 69th Street exit ramp, and that is backing up traffic to 112.
Ruff area?
Yeah.
You don't want to.
You like to avoid that area.
At all times.

Now Neil Rogers continues to shoot the breeze on WIMZ.
On what station?
It's called 6249.
Do you hear that?
100?
In Rowered 5249400, don't bottle it up inside.
Let it all out with Neil Rogers.
Do you believe she said that?
She said that.
Didn't she say Zeta Ford?
Yeah.
That's what I heard.
Yeah.
I thought she said Zeta Ford didn't she?
Yeah.
WZTA.
I thought it was something like that.
There was a Z in there somewhere.
I think I'm going to keep playing it.
I like that.
26 past 7 on Zeta Ford, the Neil Rogers show of Friday morning.
And don't get hypernil.
Just everybody relax.
The daylight is breaking out there.
Isn't that beautiful?
Look at that.
There's Rick Edwards running around in circles over near the towers.
Fantastic.
OK, let's take some of the calls here because they're lit up like a Hanukkah bush.
Rowered County.
Good morning.
This is good morning to you in the bird.
Yes, and how are you?
I'm just fine.
How are you?
You sound fine.
We're fine.
I'm very glad that we're all fine.
Everybody's fine.
Isn't that fine?
Yeah.
Yes, I have a question of the sports guy.
Yeah, Mr. sports.
Yeah, it sounds a lot to me like Brian Norcross on that.
Well, I didn't want to let it out of the bag, but he is a distant cousin, a kissing cousin.
I can tell.
Yeah, I bet you good.
You're a real funky guy.
Yeah.
I had a radio accident this morning, my first ever.
Really?
What did you stumble upon?
Well, I was trying to fix breakfast and tune you in at the same time.
And my husband told me to hurry up and I got close to it.
It's a good time and I had a quick tune over.
Hmm.
Boy, that's not just an accident.
It's frightening.
That's like a major disaster.
That would be like a headline story.
It's a good time.
I know my husband's got to fix his own breakfast.
And the boy is going to have accidents like that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Only fair.
Yeah, it's amazing.
I went to the melting pot and I had a wonderful time back so much.
So now my husband wants me to go up and get pot to chocolate to go at night.
Yeah, I don't blame her.
Did you get the white chocolate or the dark?
No, we got the dark.
I got to try the white the next time.
Oh, trust me.
I mean, the dark is great, but the white chocolate with the amaretto is so good that you'll forget your husband.
You'll just kick him out.
That's great.
Just take the chocolate home.
OK, well, I really enjoyed it.
And I thought Jamie bounding after you that night, you were up there.
I thought you lost your wallet or something.
He's really frantic.
Yeah, he came flying out of there like a maniac.
I saw that.
I was just acting natural.
You know, like a maniac.
I thought he worked there and you forgot your wallet or something.
You're all important.
That'll be my luck.
Probably he'll be working here next week.
I'll go over there instead of getting Dave to wait on me.
Well, why don't you put Jamie as the way to?
It'll be the first fondue, Ville Parmesan, a history of mankind.
Well, you have a wonderful weekend.
You too.
For the first time in a while.
OK, yeah, isn't this exciting?
It's just great.
Now they don't have to listen to me bitch about working on Saturday anymore because I won't be here.
And I like it when we have our choices, records to play and not to play because you calm up on the FM.
They won't play in any way.
So it's a different.
Yeah, that's right.
They got their playlist and they pretend that they're playing something you wanted to hear.
But if it wasn't on a list, they won't play it anyway.
Yeah, they just say it to pass the player.
You got it.
OK.
Have a nice one.
You too.
She's so right.
What's the difference anyway?
Yeah, they're not going to play what you want.
Yeah.
And if you happen to call in and request something that's on the list, then they record it and they put it on here.
Oh, look at this.
Are we being nice?
We're playing what you wanted to hear.
Is it complete blind?
Don't look.
And if it wasn't on a playlist, man, those consultants would drag them screaming and kicking out of there so fast, you wouldn't believe it.
It's 7.30 right on the nose here on Zeta Ford.
This show is flying this morning.
Isn't it like a big bird?
Just flying along.
Let's go to Broward County.
Good morning.
I hate it now.
Good.
How much seems to me?
You got rid of those car phone idiots you used to get?
Yeah, the mobile caller seemed to like have disappeared.
Yeah.
You know why?
Well, first thing in the morning now.
Yeah, well, they're cheap skates too.
You know, it costs 35 cents a minute starting from the ring.
And you know, very often we let them just keep ringing.
So they're not going to call their cheap.
We're calling them.
They're cheap soothes.
Yeah, hey, that is a good idea.
Maybe we could get people to write in to write in with their mobile phone numbers.
I can call them.
Yeah, and we could call them in the morning.
And then what we really will do will call them when they're not in the car.
When they got the car like parked and they run in somewhere and will let a ring and ring for like, because you get charged when somebody calls you.
Right.
They'll start running out of wherever they are to run to the answer.
Do they get charged the same?
Yeah.
We call them.
Absolutely.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's that's power.
So whatever you do, don't give out my number.
No, I haven't given it to anybody yet.
I know.
Which is just the way I like it.
Real common peaceful in the car.
The purpose of the phone.
Yeah.
Well, in case you need it, you know, good question.
Thank you.
It's doing great now.
Yeah, we're cooking there.
I think yesterday we finally crossed the path.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
I don't.
No, I think like yesterday we finally got our act together.
And, huh?
Oh, I lied.
Yeah.
Well, listen, what did you want to hear, sir?
Oh, do you think I'm not around?
No, I'm just pulling your leg, pulling your leg.
Are you going to work?
Not today.
Lucky, man.
Oh, not today.
Any special reason?
Um, no.
No, just, he just, in other words, do you work?
Yeah.
Yeah, you work, but you're not going today.
And it sounds like there's something a little devious here that you don't want us to probe
and we're going to go into the window, right?
Okay.
Oh, this is good.
I like this.
I think we've touched a raw nerve on this called, now listen, we don't want to pry.
I don't want to get you in hot water.
Where do you work?
Okay, listen, enjoy your day.
What are you doing?
Going out to Calder today?
No, I don't know.
Going out to the Broward Mall of Tend to troll?
Yeah.
Well, good luck to you, sir.
Okay, then.
And tell Stan, I said hi.
Okay.
Okay, he'll be over there at the mall with you.
I'm sure.
It's 732, Mr. Sports is in the other room, gargling and getting ready to do his thing.
And in the meantime, let's go back to the date County.
Hello.
Good morning, Neil.
Yes, Walter.
Hi, you're doing it, Walter.
You stupid old fart.
How are you?
Hi, I want to talk to Grant about his news cow.
Okay, Walter.
Here we go.
Oh, Grant, we have a problem here in New York.
The grand jury was investigating the famous suitcase.
What the hell is the famous suitcase?
I also said that a rat was an ally of Kuwaiti.
There's no such country as Kuwaiti.
Honey, there is it.
No, try Kuwait.
Oh, Kuwaiti.
Kuwaiti.
That's right.
Thank you, Walter.
That's the way it is.
Good morning.
733.
Okay, my senior, I, a little friend, have a wonderful weekend.
You too, Neil.
Good on you.
Thank you.
And Adios and Dan Rather sends his best to you.
733 on Zeta 4.
And we're going back to date County again.
Good morning.
Hello.
Hello.
Mobile.
Mobile.
What is it?
Mobile.
What do you mean what?
I got on the air?
Yeah, you're on the air, sir.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Unbelievable.
I know.
I heard you racking on all the mobile callers.
Yeah, a bunch of suits, but you might be an exception, sir.
We'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
Okay, first of all.
Although, you know, start paying from the rain.
When you start paying?
Until it's picked up.
Oh, really?
I didn't know that.
We heard the other.
Yeah.
Secondly, I really wanted to hit your number, but you're not going to give it out, huh?
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm going to give it on the air, sir.
Yeah.
My idea.
Yeah, brilliant idea.
Where is Biff today?
Biff is no longer with the show.
Biff is, he'd be doing some other stuff, I guess.
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah.
I just wanted to ask you a question.
You remember the old Ford Lauderdale soccer team?
Oh, yeah.
The strikers.
Yeah, yeah.
They have any connection with Jeff?
As a matter of fact, yes.
The team was named in his honor, but...
Yeah.
Mayor Cox did not like the connotation, and as a result, its adios are even there.
I've got some all bumper stickers.
I think I can say just something.
They say striker-likeer.
Oh, those would be great.
They have to read it carefully.
Not spelled right, but they would be great.
Yeah, you have to read it carefully.
You don't want to give them any trouble.
Well, Peter Boulder, our program director, is a little confused about all this Jeff
striker stuff.
He hasn't figured it out.
So I guess we're going to have to paste some of our pictures up on his door today to, you know,
lead him in the right direction.
Like I keep telling people, you have to listen for a while.
You'll catch on to everything.
Yeah, it's like a soap opera.
I said, Peter, I don't have time to go back to the beginning and explain it all to you, you know?
But hang in there and a little, little, little, all makes sense.
We're hanging.
So let me ask you another question.
Yes, sir, very quickly.
I saw you on TV, you know, when one hand was doing your thing a couple of weeks ago or a week ago.
Yes.
And you had hair and everything.
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing?
Yeah, but I remember back to the tropics.
And Harold, you had the bald Gene Wyngardt instead of was bald.
Yeah, where are you way back then?
Well, I don't remember.
I don't remember being bald, but it may have been, you know, on the TV.
I know.
It's just, it didn't like ship with the old tropics thing.
Right.
Well, I'll work on it.
Okay.
Adios.
Talk.
Okay, not a bad caller from Mobile Phone Caller, you know, 735 on Zeta 4.
Good morning, everybody.
In the National Hockey League last night, the Islander shut out Philadelphia 6-0 in overtime.
The Rangers and Pittsburgh played away 6-all tie.
And the Boston Bruins beat Los Angeles 3-2.
Although the National Football League players ended their strike, one union leader says it's not a surrender,
turning the move AC's fire.
Unable to negotiate a contract settlement, the union is taking the owners to court.
The owners say the back-to-work order by union leader Gene Upshot came too late to avoid a third straight weekend of SCAB games.
Whitey Herzog's pitching choice for the opening game of the World Series is a surprise.
He's picked rookie left-hander Joe McGray and over veteran Bob Forsch to pitch against Minnesota's Frank Viola in the first game of the Series Saturday night.
Cardinals also learned that third-baseman Terry Pendleton will probably be lost for the series because of a ribcage injury suffered in the last game of the playoffs.
Mike Tyson defenses heavyweight crown in Atlantic City, New Jersey tonight against 1984 Olympic gold medalist Tyrell Biggs.
Tyson and I know one favorite is unbeaten in 31 fights with 27 knockouts.
Biggs is 15 and 0 with 10 knockouts and that's sports.
22 to 8, 738 in Espanol.
It's Ciepe, he trained the Ocho.
Thank you.
Or whatever. That's not how they do the time.
Ocho Maynose, 20-dose.
So Dave says...
Is that right?
Ocho Maynose, 20-dose?
22 before 8?
Well, we know.
Oh, come on.
Can you cut me a break, Stan would say.
Do you know anybody who says that?
Yeah, only Stan.
Cut me a break, that's like one of those tragic ancient lines.
It did, yeah.
Like Stan by me.
Anyway, this hour, now we got to play the roaches for that nice lady.
She really, remember she called back yesterday?
Yeah.
And she said she's with us for life.
And you said it's good.
And after we played Meried Men by the Roaches, which is cute.
You know, it's, we're going to play it sometime.
Maybe if not this hour, next hour for sure.
Because she said she listens from 7 to 10.
Okay.
And I don't want to disappoint her.
It's here, it's like right in the thing there.
Yeah, light tone.
And also this hour got stepping up and we are going to play it, right?
Oh, absolutely.
Come on, that's the greatest.
Okay, bokeh, good morning.
Yeah, Buenos dias.
Buenos dias to you too, sir.
This show sounds great to hear, really does.
I know, that's because we're loosened, all that other good stuff.
Releuze.
I get a phone, the phone sounds fine.
People have a car playing about how they can't hear one on the phone.
It sounds just as it did before.
What do you mean?
On the speaker phone?
On the telephone here.
Nobody, in other words, when you're talking to us, you mean?
Yeah.
Doesn't sound bad, I think they expected to be in stereo on their phone.
Well, see, the problem is, like on the AM, we had this other system when we didn't use the speaker phone.
We used a different system and all the microphones are wired directly into it.
So it sounds like a regular phone call.
I can't as opposed to this, which sounds like we're in a barrel.
Yeah, sounds like a speaker phone.
It's not bad.
But the interesting thing of it is we are in a barrel, that's the good part.
It's real good.
We're going to play with our Leechless, there's not Whitty guys anymore, right?
No, Lee is moving on to other things.
I think it's probably the best.
I think you get to make people in the room there, just kind of let's it all up.
But I think for his, for his demise, you ought to play the James Brown, the Soul Patrol, and the Keyhole thing for him.
That might be a...
Oh yeah, James Brown's security alarm.
It's probably possible.
On the telephone, the sports guy does sound like Brian Dorkrot.
Yeah.
Well, what can I say?
The weather here is beautiful.
He's like your Tony Cigreto, I guess, in the morning.
He comes in and does the sports for you, right?
Yeah, a little more upbeat than Tony, but he's good.
Listen, there are a couple things that the bit about the six-year-old Neil Rogers, that's going to be a classic.
Yeah.
I think that's the one where he had it just been.
Yeah, from Geneva.
I didn't know they had that.
I would have been trying to hide that, but they dug it out.
That's one more thing.
I hate to ask for a question.
But my girlfriend doesn't believe, you play the Joey Reynolds Gong thing all the time.
But one day, it was last week, you played...
I think you just played it once, was a Neil Rogers thing.
It was on the same song.
Oh yeah.
It was hilarious.
I just laughed out in the car.
I was like, it was fine.
Well, I'll be honest with you.
It's in the machine.
Right as you speak.
Fantastic.
You guys are doing great.
Neil have a great weekend.
I'm sure you're looking for that two-day...
You have no idea.
Appreciate the car.
Thanks a lot.
Okay, we'll call you again.

One, two, three.
Just lost me.
I'm just gonna switch to
I can see you.
I can't wait until
you're done flying.
I'm gonna fly to
you.
I'm just gonna fly to you.
I'm just gonna fly to you.
I'm just gonna fly to you.
Okay, Joy, never get anything like that, did he?
And you see, the reason I haven't played that is because it
makes references to the AM.
And I'm trying to avoid that.
But as I've listened to this stuff,
it doesn't make any difference.
It doesn't matter.
It still has the same flavor.
17 before 8 at Zeta 4 and our next caller
has probably been waiting for a lifetime in
Dade County.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
As the first morning I've had
offset you've made this change to Zeta 4 and I must say
the story of making sound more mellow like a nice guy.
Right.
You're coming off real more mellow.
Like a miracle, right?
Yeah, I just wanted to ask you are more young people
tuning you in because I work in North Campus in Miami
Dade and they seem to be telling me everything you say.
Oh, yeah.
You must be getting more younger group here.
Yeah, everybody with an IQ of over six under the age of 35
in this market.
Listen to this show.
But I'm really telling you it's something interesting to hear
the campus.
They are actually discussing neo-rodgers instead of power 96.
Now what?
We are making progress at the campus.
What campus is this?
Fourth campus, Miami-Dade College.
Miami-Dade.
I wonder what Dave Cohen, which campus he goes to.
Did he say goes to Miami-Dade?
That's at 113.
Oh, yeah.
Bet you that's where he is right now.
I hope so.
But listen, neo-keep up with the good work.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Have a nice day.
Everybody in the listening audience, keep your hands off our
property.
Okay?
He's a good guy.
He has a good sense of humor and he came in and spent a little
time on the show and leaves lap yesterday, which is why Lee is not
here today anymore.
You know, these FM people, man, they're uptighted and unfriendly.
You know what I mean?
Like me at the track.
They are uptight and unfriendly.
Speaking of the carpeting crew, here they come ladies and gentlemen.
Isn't that them?
Looks like they're there.
I would recognize that raft anywhere, wouldn't you?
Yeah, right.
The license plate's hanging off the back.
Oh, boy.
That's part of the crew, although I didn't see somebody in that truck.
So if I start getting nervous a little while, I may not continue.
The show may not be able to continue.
Well, you must confess now.
I mean, I feel more comfortable because Lee was getting very upset and
uptighted and unfriendly.
But you got to admit, now this was an extraordinary young man we had in here
the other day, wasn't he?
If you say so.
I mean, even Stan admitted to me that he was an extraordinary young man.
Of course, Stan, we don't know what the hell is going on now.
We're not really sure.
And look at that.
Look like Don Johnson getting out of the truck, too.
That looks just like that.
That's not.
Isn't it?
Okay.
Okay.
ABC and CBS and AP and UPI get him in here immediately if not sooner.
550, 9490 is our number.
If you like to, then that's toll free for anybody.
Anybody who can hear us, 550, 9490.
And if you get some kind of a recording, that means you shouldn't be calling us in a first place.
Correct.
Okay.
Line 2 is next in Dade County.
Hello.
Good morning.
How are you?
Great.
And I make a suggestion regarding the music.
Of course.
Anything you like.
Okay.
I noticed that during the past week you conspicuously left out America's greatest rocket roll band.
Any guesses?
Neil, this is one of your favorite groups.
I'm waiting.
Each boy.
No, we haven't.
Didn't we play Sloop John B the other day?
No.
We left it out.
I think we left it out.
We were going to play it.
We didn't have time.
Okay.
Either good vibration to surf or grow would probably be in order.
Okay.
Okay.
The second thing is this.
Did Carlos ever do it?
Carlos, the label maker.
You kept warning him not to do it.
Did he ever?
Carlos.
No, we haven't heard from Carlos.
I would want to speak for him.
Left hand.
And left hand.
And they're car commercial.
Yeah.
That gentleman certainly keeps his level up, doesn't he?
Yeah.
He sure does.
Okay.
I want to let you know I'm enjoying it.
Thank you.
Have a nice weekend.
Okay.
Five billion dollars.
Fourteen before eight here on Zeta 4 and look at this.
They're starting to roll in.
Who the hell is that?
Look at that.
That's a program director.
Oh, that's a program director.
Like I said, look at that wonderful man who just drove in here.
Look at him with a smile on his face.
And he's taking little notes.
He's writing down the time.
You ripped me at 746 and you ripped me at 12 past seven.
See, it's a good thing about him.
He's only got an AM radio in there anyway.
So don't worry about it.
Say they can't look at it.
He can't get out of the car.
As long as we keep talking about him, he will not leave the car.
Do I blame him?
Well, if I look like that, I'd never get out of the car either.
Just a joke.
Pete, just a joke.
Did he get out?
No.
He's not going to get out.
He's still in there.
He's taking little note.
What he's putting together his dream team for Linda Thornton.
And by now, I would think Linda would be up, wouldn't she?
Yeah.
Linda, OK, so you woke me up two days in a row.
No problem.
I don't feel bad.
You have no way of knowing when I'm taking an app.
But that's not what bothers me.
What bothers me is you don't understand.
It's a dumb question.
Nobody cares about your question about the dream lineup.
You know, they all want to be program directors, but they don't have dream line-ups.
No.
They have some nightmares, but no dreams.
By the way, look at that.
The sun is shining.
The sky is blue.
And Peter is still in the car.
He still won't get out of the car.
OK, won't get out till we take another call so we better do it.
Who is that?
Oh, this is our first time tunnel.
Oh, this is our first time tunnel.
Oh, this is our first time tunnel.
On the F-band, this is our first time tunnel on Z-4.
How does it sound in stereo?
One, two, three.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
OK, little two, Harry, to leave that on forever, right?
But I liked it.
Yeah, the stereo time tunnel.
You won't hear that.
Enjoy 107.
I'll tell you that, ladies and gentlemen.
No chance.
No changes.
Broward, hello.
Hi, is this the lead Gillette and friend show?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Is Neil Roger there?
No, he is not on the show anymore, sir.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Could you give him a message, please?
OK.
Neil, this is Joe Nichols.
It's a good time for a great motivational tape.
By the way, they haven't still haven't been able to motivate anybody to listen to that station.
Have you noticed?
Well, I did notice that, unfortunately.
But our ratings are getting better.
Yeah.
What is it about a point two now?
Well, pretty close.
Pretty close.
We're feeling really good about that.
I'm listening to a tape in my other ear right now.
I'm feeling really good.
That's really incredible, especially since the Neil Rogers factor is no longer on the AM dial, right?
Thank God for that.
Yeah, you can say that again.
Thank God for that.
They get up to a point three.
OK, well, good luck to you, sir.
OK, and we have a motivational change for your I-95 song.
Yes, sir.
Would you change the word to Apple?
It's healthy for you, and you'll feel much better.
OK.
He sounds almost as good as Bruce Williams.
Sure take care of that, boy.
It's 11 before 8 here on Zeta 4.
The news is coming up almost almost instantaneously as we speak.
Oh, leave it.
And we'll hear about that wonderful country of Kuwaiti, where they were their espesto's shoes.
Is he still in the car?
I do bet.
What the hell is he doing in the car?
I think he's going to be there at 10.
Look at that.
He's smoking the steering wheel.
I can't believe it.
It's not that bad.
You know, don't follow parties coming apart of the pieces.
Look at that.
Do you remember a rear window where he had the suitcase and the trunk?
Right.
And I don't know if one of the consultancies in there, but boy, it sure looks familiar.
All right, it's 7.50 now on Zeta 4.
I just worried this morning from Midland, Texas, since rescuers are getting closer to pulling that 18 month old toddler.
Out of the abandoned well, officials say the rescuers tumbling through rocks so hard that it dulled diamond-tipped drills.
Today broke a two inch hole in the well shaft where the youngsters trapped 22 feet below ground.
The Pentagon hints it knows but won't yet release the source of today's attack on a U.S. flag Kuwaiti tanker in the pulse Persian Gulf.
But a spokesman says there are reports that an aircraft was in the area of the attack at the time.
The commander speaking in Washington declined to give further details on the report.
And a third quarter report released by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles says that Broward, Panellis and Palm Beach counties are the fastest growing counties in Florida.
And what about this $46 million Pennsylvania lottery win?
Yeah, what about it?
Well, I'm so glad you asked.
You get 1.4 million a year for 26 years.
And I keep working now.
I keep coming to work.
I love it so much.
Well, you got to have the winning numbers.
No one has claimed the $46 million prize.
It's the largest in U.S. history.
And if it isn't claimed within a year, it will go into a fund for safe programs.
No, probably if I won it, I would take a plane trip to Portland, Maine, and I would take two things with me.
One of them would be my winning lottery check and the other one would be a broom handle.
Okay, does that say it all?
I think it's a very clear answer.
Okay, the Zeta forecast.
Partly set.
No, okay.
Partly sunny, breezy today.
How much Mr. Sports doing there?
I know.
I 85, low 75.
We have just a slight chance of rain.
71 degrees.
It's 752 on Zeta.
I'm Glenn Hill.
755 on Zeta 4.
And you got another little goodie for us?
Another piece of great news.
Wonderful traffic.
Southbound Turnpike near the stadium.
Construction to the toll plaza.
And that is slowing down traffic real bad, it says.
And at 27th Avenue and Northwest 207th Street, the Lake Lasern area, there's a shooting.
And it's Dave Captain Dave wrote lots of cops in the area.
So you probably don't want to go over there.
Are they doing the shooting?
I don't just want to go.
Could be.
Hey, listen, Dave Coutie, you never know.
You don't miss the traffic.
You never know.
Of course, that's for the lady in Boko who wants us to reinforce her paranoia.
Okay, now I know it's coming as a great shock to you.
And in the next star, we will hear the roaches, okay?
For that lady.
I'm promising.
Okay.
Why do you look like you don't want to hear the roaches?
Well, that's not that.
I just have my doubts.
That we are going to play it.
Yeah, trust me.
But this hour, we're going to do something good because the PD is here.
Hey, Rodgeroneo.
Hey, Rodgeroneo, how are you doing?
Love your show.
Hey.
What?
He's on his own speaker phone.
Listen to that.
Why don't you get on the phone so we can hear you?
Okay.
Oh, boy, this is a good guy.
I told you, these vocal calls are my favorites.
This is what radio is all about.
Come on, Rodger.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
You sounded better in the barrel.
Cool.
What's up?
Nothing.
So you're making fun of my show.
Yeah, we were making fun of your show.
And Joey Reynolds is almost better than you are.
You know it?
Yeah.
How old are you?
13.
13.
Now, you're not the guy that called us the other day, are you?
No.
Okay, good.
Because you sound like you've lost a couple of years or lost something.
I'm not sure what.
Well, listen, I have a wonderful life, but I'm not going to press my luck.
I don't know what I mean.
No.
Dave County, hello.
Want a meal?
How are you?
I don't, Bert.
We're all doing great, sir.
Uh, nearly.
There's a song I haven't noticed you play.
I've listened to you all week.
And what that'd be?
E-L-O's telephone line.
I thought you said you liked that song.
I do.
I love it.
Do we have E-L-O in the other room by any chance?
No, we have.
Oh, but we've got no time for the guest to.
No, don't say no.
Who the hell get his mic off?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay.
I was in Bob Rich here.
And I was looking for angel heart.
You were with Bob Rich ?
I was in Bob Rich's video store.
Oh, yeah.
I was looking for angel heart.
And I couldn't find it.
Every time I go in there, they don't have it.
Yeah.
But I seen a movie and you kept talking about it.
And I got it and that movie was great, the hitter.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
I was a good movie.
Classic.
That was good.
With Pete Thomas Howell.
That was good.
It was good.
What a great second choice.
Yeah.
And Rutger Howard.
Well, you kept talking about it.
I forgot.
I'm going to try it.
I wasn't sure what it was about.
It'll keep you right on the edge of your seat.
I mean, are you saying you're still not sure
what it was about?
You been after you saw it?
Oh no, I know what it's about.
But yeah, it was a good movie.
Okay.
I didn't know what it was when I picked it up.
I didn't know how bizarre it was gonna be.
I'm still waiting to see Blue Velvet.
All right, now you remember the scene where Tom Howell
is sitting there with a, waiting for the coffee
and Rutger Howard comes in and puts the pennies
on his eyelids and Tom Howell says,
why are you doing this to me?
And he says, think about it.
No, I didn't get that part.
Well, think about it.
All right.
That's the message.
I'm gonna lie this morning, Neil.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
A Revenage.
143, it's 803 on say to four.
Sunday shining, blue skies, beautiful day,
in spite of whatever he tells you during the weather.
It looks magnificent.
We got, we got a yellow.
No, not right now.
Don't see, I like to do that, Tim,
because he just, he just freaks out.
He just goes, no, later on, we'll play it a little later on.
But I just wanted to make sure everything's under control.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
Let's go to Rowered County.
Hello.
Neil, yeah.
How you doing?
Welcome to FM.
Thank you so much, sir.
Much nice, because I have FM all over my house.
I only had AM in one little radio,
and I had to carry it from place to place.
Yeah, that AM is a real pain, you know?
Do you remember Ernest Angley?
Sure.
Heel, say bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Super tramp, back breakfast in America every Sunday morning
while he'd hit people in the head.
Oh, yeah, that ought to do it for you, yeah.
That was, that was my, that was my line up on Sunday mornings.
And I'm not talking about that today, but...
We got to play Goodbye Stranger by Super tramp, too, huh?
Yeah.
We got so much music we got to play now.
I guess this is the last call.
Well, I hope not.
No, I'm just a joke.
All right, well, listen, I just wanted to say good morning.
It's nice I could talk to you, because usually I'm in the car
or flying when you're on.
Well, you can call us from your mobile phone any time you want.
I'm not rich enough to have a mobile phone.
You don't?
No, sorry.
I think they're a waste.
That speaks well for you, sir.
Yeah.
To matter of fact, yeah.
I do carry a beeper, though.
That's what really stands for.
You carry a beaver?
Beaver.
Oh, beeper.
I agree.
OK, have a great weekend.
Hi.
I wasn't sure what he was talking about.
You know, this is a family show.
Look at this.
805.
Just flying by.
And the weather is coming up almost as we speak.
Everything is like on time and things are happening and...
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
I can't continue, can't.
I know.
Wait till Monday.
We'll screw everything up Monday.
Is it a forecast?
It's beautiful outside.
Partly sunny, a little breezy today.
High will be about 85.
Yeah.
Low tonight, 75 and more news.
We have just a slight chance of rain.
And that is through the entire weekend.
Oh, boy.
You bet you a 72 degrees.
Isn't it great to be alive?
It's 806 on Zeta 4.
I'm Glenn Hill.
Hey, young man.
Yeah.
Listen, I've seen you hanging around my house.
And I saw what I want to talk to you about.
What did you make the best?
I wasn't here now.
I'm going to put it this way.
Yeah.
Wasn't you who did the push and put the stains upon the cushion.
Put prints on the dashboard upside down.
Hey, what?
Who wasn't you?
You broccoli billed and messing with my daughter Jill.
If it was, you'd better leave this town.
Well, I got to say.
Yes, it was I who did the push and put the stains upon the cushion.
Put prints on the dashboard upside down.
Yeah.
But since I'm messing with your daughter, I've had trouble passing water.
So I guess we're even all around.
Why you?
Come over here.
Come over here.
Come over here.
Eight minutes after it on Zeta 4 Friday morning.
And I think we'll take one call before we do the roaches.
OK, because I've got to play that.
I feel so guilty if I don't get that in for that wonderful, lovely, loyal, whatever she was.
Stayed County.
Good morning.
Hey, Neil.
Good morning.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
I haven't been listening.
I just got off as well.
What's your hot topic?
What's the topic?
What's the hot topic?
Well, the hot topic today is your dream lineup.
If you had your own radio station.
Now, actually, you didn't hear the background behind it.
It doesn't know how to take no for an answer.
OK, so we just tried to humor her.
Or more?
She doesn't understand.
It's a stiff topic, OK?
Unbelievable.
Linda just doesn't understand a stiff when she sees one.
What about that pain in the ass woman that called up that didn't like your show and didn't like New York?
Is she been bothering you?
Oh, I wish she would call back.
She was about my third favorite call of the week.
She was definitely in the top five.
She doesn't understand that life is empty and meaningless as your show.
Yeah, that's right.
You got it.
So it fits perfectly with her, right?
Right.
Well, I've got you on tape.
I'll listen to it tonight.
And I'll listen to the rest now.
OK, have a great life.
You got a great day.
Thank you so much.
I'll read it there.
Oh, boy.
These people are so nice, you know?
But this is like the honeymoon week, the first week.
We're on the night.
Next week, we start calling everybody douchebags and really getting into it with these people.
And it'll be a different story.
Hey, it's so nasty and I still, and it's disgusting.
And stereo, no less.
It's disgusting.
It's disgusting.
And that's when we really start cooking, right?
Yeah.
By the way, we want to just make one comment.
We love the consultants and we want to let them know that because for some, it's our reason.
They love the show already, you know?
And just leave us alone and it'll be OK.
The first, the first time they say anything, like even how low it'll be over, right?
We're not sensitive or anything, but enough is enough.
Boy.
You have something there?
Well, you know, the traffic today, it's not like traffic.
It's like a police report today.
Well, this is like a police state, OK?
You're a local Gestapo is watching you, ladies and gentlemen.
Now we have a car chase going on.
It's around Northwest 2nd, up to 44th Street, it says.
Right.
Yeah, it's not like traffic.
That's another good part of town, too, right?
OK, 10 minutes after raid.
Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
Here's the moment we've promised.
I've promised, OK?
And in spite of all your skepticism, that wonderful, lovely loyal listeners.
Isn't that what we're into?
Unzade of loyal listeners.
Is going to get her way.
Of course, Peter is very happy that we're appealing to the loyal listeners.
He's not going to be so happy that we're playing obscure music.
But so what else is new unzade, right?
