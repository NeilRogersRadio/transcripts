If it doesn't work out, you can leave.
Is that fair enough?
I leave.
I said, I said, I'm the one who leaves.
Oh, Dave isn't leaving.
When you meet him, you'll understand why.
Just go get him.
It's 20 minutes past 11.
Well, listen, now we can't bring all ugly people in here.
Okay, once in a great while, just a humor me, bring in somebody who looks human.
Okay?
I mean, there's nobody in this building who looks human since that engineer went to Tampa.
We don't want to mention his name.
He gets very emotional and all his family starts flicking limperists at him.
He just, they can't handle it.
You know, even his wife, 20 past 11 and wins will come right back.
If you have American or European antiques, they could be worth more than you realize.
Now is the...
Okay, now let's try to bring a little order and decorum to this show.
Okay, Dave is here.
You got to lost probably.
Am I right?
Do you get lost?
Right.
Bad directions.
Who is that Kyle over there?
Kyle gave you bad direction.
Yeah.
He doesn't care.
No, don't use turn on him too already.
Everybody's turned on him.
All right, I'm still on your side.
Okay.
Yep.
Now what's Gina doing up there?
She's up there staring and laying is up there staring.
We got half of the staff staring in here.
Do you approve?
I mean, is he okay?
Is he all right, Gina?
Does he meet with your approval?
How many fingers?
Oh, she's checking them out.
Okay.
She's turning around.
She says fine.
On 10 fingers, how many?
Now on a scale of 10.
Scale of 10?
A nine.
A nine.
A eight.
We got a nine.
What's Lee Fowler got a three something?
Three something.
Well, how do you like that?
You give her a 10?
Oh, she's nice.
Did you want to do something with her now?
Well, we're doing the show.
I mean, if you guys saw, she's afterwards.
After the show.
Well, don't hold your breath.
Well, I'll tell you what, if she's busy,
well, we'll talk about that later.
So anyway, you brought Dave in here
and you're hostile with him already.
I want the audience to understand.
Is he hostile?
Pull that mic up to him.
Don't just leave him sitting there
like some kind of a nerd.
You know, show him the ropes.
Talk into that.
But don't eat it.
Just don't eat into it.
Well, I want to sit over there and kneel,
I want to, oh, the controls.
Is that all right?
What do you mean you want to sit over in this chair?
Yeah, you get a nice, like in my lap?
No, not your lap.
We can switch places.
Yeah, right.
He just came into room and he's taking over the show already.
No chance today.
Maybe tomorrow you can sit over.
All right.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
I mean, talk about a pushy guest.
See, this is not like Paul who was,
see, he's the opposite.
Paul was like laid back.
Is that the expression?
Are you going to continue harassing my guest?
Are you going to continue putting everybody else
to the bottom line is, see, the problem I got now
is that I got two people in the studio,
both of whom want to be the only person in here.
I don't mean with me, I mean just without me.
Am I right?
No.
No, I'm wrong.
You're wrong.
Now, what would you do, Dave?
What would you, if you just sat here all alone,
there was nobody else in here, what would you talk about?
I'd talk about you.
And what would you say?
Only good thing now.
Oh, yeah.
Look at that, he's winsing.
Look at the expression on his, he was winsing.
I didn't know what was coming there.
He probably, uh,
repeat some of those conversations he had with Brian
and Josh at the ice cream store.
Now, we want to talk about that.
They were that fan, huh?
Yeah.
Hopefully he's not afraid to tell people his name now.
Who's that?
Brian.
Why is that?
I don't know.
He says embarrassed to tell people his name, because you.
This could be all worth it in the long run.
I like the direction.
I like the direction.
Yeah, I like the direction.
He's real hostile in that.
It's your kind of maternity.
He's embarrassed to tell people his name because of me.
Yep.
Why?
Let's calm up and ask him.
He's at school.
He's in school.
You want to take him out of school?
He goes to, um, Nova.
Nova high.
No, we could have him paged.
No, no, no.
Now let's not do that.
Little tacky.
He might be in the middle of biology class.
Or something important, learning something.
For Jim.
Yeah, Jim 102.
Yeah.
So what else, Dave?
I don't know.
What did I miss?
Did I miss anything?
No.
We might be waiting for you.
Waiting to follow your lead.
All right, let's take a fun call.
OK.
Broward.
Broward.
OK, Broward.
Hello.
Neil, how are you doing?
Happy anniversary.
Thank you.
Speak to Dave, sir.
He's hot to talk to you.
Ah, no.
Well, listen, if we're going to get on that truck,
I get to tell you your guests are terminal.
Come on.
Thank you very much, sir.
He just got here.
How do you know that?
He just arrived.
Well, it's going to be something interesting.
Well, listen, Neil, before you get off,
I got a rush over.
I got to tell you something too.
I think I've got self-advistory for you.
OK.
Listen, I was flipping late night channels last night.
I came across that the old time tunnel TV series.
Remember that?
Yeah.
Well, this episode, Joey Pinto with James Harnel,
four James Down and Lee Merryweather,
that it'd take him through the tunnel back to the 50.
That's how they did it.
That's how we get to throw y'all.
I think it was called Escape the Yesterday.
Yeah, Escape to the Dark Ages.
Right, who is it?
James Harnel's tumbling through the tunnel
on the evening, talk up to two.
Wouldn't that be great?
Incredible.
OK.
Well, it's now the happy anniversary, Neil.
It was great last night, too.
You were there?
I was there.
Good.
OK.
Did Brian say anything nasty about anybody last night?
I don't know.
I only saw him for a second.
I didn't know if it was him or the other kid
with the bullfond that was Brian.
Yeah, the one with the bullfond.
Yeah, bullfond.
The one with the hair stick that you put up.
Yeah, that was it.
OK.
Yeah, the bullfond.
What kind of a road test?
OK, good luck to you.
Time to move on.
True.
They're ripping everybody today.
We don't rip anybody on this show.
Just dating facts.
Shame on you.
I liked his comments.
Now, who would you like to rip?
Me?
Yeah, do you want to rip somebody?
Now, OK, see?
Well, he's a positive.
I think by the end of the show.
By the end of the show.
Like nobody here, we don't want to mention any names.
Dave Kelly.
Dave?
Dave.
OK.
OK, let's put them on a head.
Dave, hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Is Neil?
Yeah.
Turn your radio off.
Would you please?
Come on.
Hold on.
Hold on.
I'll play a super dumb OK.
Hold on one second.
God, even Paul turned his radio down.
Even Paul.
He just won't let up on him.
What do you want?
Just because he was ugly?
He wasn't ugly.
He was OK.
He was like average.
Lifeguard.
Yeah, it was average.
Mail?
Yes, sir.
I didn't say Bork.
I said bird.
B-I-R-D.
Bird.
I think I have an ad in here.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
I saw Sonny Fox this morning.
He had a spare banana.
I looked like Peppy Fields and drags.
Oh, I heard that call the other day, for standard.
You hear that call about the young lady on the beach
that either want to fix him up with,
and he went through this whole thing, and it was Peppy Fields.
Perfect.
Little too young for stands.
I wouldn't do anything like that.
No.
Listen.
What do you want?
I know you die of bed.
I'm by a bed.
You can eat all you want.
Yeah.
Just don't swallow.
I know.
Oh, this is the same guy that called about Peppy Fields.
Let me explain something to you.
You're the same jerk that called about Peppy Fields, aren't you?
Yeah, you jerk.
Get out.
You want to go back to the Broward's desk?
Yeah, Broward.
Broward.
Neil.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's the bird there with you or is he off for a while?
He's here.
Are you listening to the show or what?
Yeah.
Well, let me tell you.
I'm listening to him out of my car.
Is the worm turns?
To come call you.
OK.
Now, real quickly, I'm a loyal listener.
I've been listening since I don't know if somebody
told me about you months ago, and I've
been listening to you for that long.
I just want to know, is there some way
to take your show on the road?
Well, there are a lot of people who would like that.
You know, like Toledo and Oklahoma City and places like that.
No, I'm not really talking far away.
I'm just talking, like, maybe up to Coral Springs, not
to P. August.
No, more like the Melmau Park.
Now, get a few plugs.
No, I'm not calling for the melting pot.
Listen, we've got some really cute kids.
And I just thought maybe you'd like to come up.
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Cute kids.
Well, understand how that's done.
We have some very nice young health seniors
and juniors in high school.
Very good looking young men.
Really?
Some very fine looking for stand, young women.
And I just thought maybe, oh, we also
have a very healthy treat for you.
We have a diabetic ice cream.
Really?
Yeah.
You also have some help who are like kind of in between
for the bird.
Yeah.
Well, we have a college aged young person.
Yeah, a young person.
Is that about right?
Sounds good.
I don't know which way the bird goes.
If you look real, real boyish, there
are two qualifications.
They have to be boyish and boyish.
Boyish and boyish.
Yeah, sure.
I don't mean either one of those.
Don't listen to this.
Don't listen to this man, sir.
Trust me, sir.
But anyway, I did.
In case you wanted it felt like playing around,
it's a take your show on the road.
How about Larry's up in Coral Springs?
Well, you know, we, this is a true story.
In Coral Springs?
In Coral Springs.
All right, let me tell you a little bubble,
might see, OK?
But it's a true story.
OK.
Saturday night, stand, of course, being
in one of his usual desperate moods,
said, let's go up to the ice cream store.
I said, OK, you know, I always have to humor him.
And of course, somebody might have been working there,
anyway.
So we go up there and it was crowded.
And we went inside, but we realized we're going to be a long way.
And we're not going to stand online to get an ice cream.
He said, why don't we find out this Larry's place
that everybody's been talking about.
And he thought it was like right up the road, like in Tamarack.
And I'm driving around and we're looking.
And we couldn't find any.
He said, well, I think it's just a bum's too.
There is no such place.
There is such a place that the corner
of Atlantic and University.
You know where it is?
Larry's ice cream?
Yeah.
It's in the promenade building by Coral Springs.
Quimau.
We have a Coral Springs expert here in the studio with us.
Oh, very good.
Who looks like a blood shot.
We were going to give you up a little early this morning, then?
Yes, it's my friend.
I've got him up a little before his side.
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
Go ahead, sir.
But anyway, in case you ever want to come up there,
like Saturday night, we're going to have a real nice crew on.
And I'm going to be there myself if you want to stop by.
Really?
And I'd love to have you and stand in.
You see it's one thing, but I wanted to show up.
So for example, last night, you know, all this talk,
like letter that I would be calling.
It was unbelievable.
The crowd.
I came right.
I came right.
I didn't want to invite you guys up to the place
that had a healthy community.
Excuse me, sir.
Niels talking.
OK.
Thank you, Dave.
You know, I really wanted to have healthy tree for you.
Yep.
So, you know, I just felt that I would come up
and I didn't fight you.
But with the crowd, it was there.
It was phenomenal.
It was unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Right.
I was starting to say something only moments ago.
Like last night, when I went in,
I got one scoop of strawberry ice cream with some marshmallow.
You know, and that was it.
And I went outside and I started signing you autograph.
I never got to eat it.
I had like three bites.
So people who carry on about, well,
you can't go to all these restaurants and eat.
But you're eating ice cream every night.
The amount of ice cream that I eat,
you could put in a thimble and have them
for the Chinese army leftover.
All right.
I understand that.
Not like, uh,
I don't think if you'd like some.
Now, I just want to, I just, sir, don't get defensive.
I just wanted to clarify that.
Okay. I'm just clarifying.
I understand, but no, it's, it's really, it was really, you know,
I really have to put it to your credit.
Yours and stands credit because you had a phenomenal crowd.
We did.
And they were all wonderful.
I've come to the conclusion that the people who show up,
uh, the silent audience out there, they're the great folks.
The ones who call, you know, not all of them,
because I don't want you to get upset.
The ones who call are primarily a pain in the ass,
not, not Dave called it a couple of times,
but that's only after we made him a star.
Oh, okay.
Am I right?
Is that Dave with a melting pot?
Is that for that?
The melting pot.
Do you know him?
Oh, no, I really don't know.
Am I?
He's a wonderful, a wonderful, a wonderful young man,
sir.
He's a friday.
I love his,
he's the only dressing man.
How do you think he's out of this world?
Friday night at 9 p.m.
By the way, it's going to be nine,
because I had a, did you hear that?
Yes.
Friday night at 9 p.m.
We're going to, you're going to make a reservation this time
because we'll be there.
I promise you.
Okay.
Well, I think maybe we'll just make a reservation too.
We'll show it.
No, wait a minute.
Let's slow down.
Did I tell you to cancel a reservation?
Do I tell you that?
But he is right at battenhamford, Lauderdale.
Yeah, Friday night.
See?
Now, did you hear that?
Oh, I shall.
Now the truth comes out.
See?
But there will be an ad coming in there.
See, that's because you're up in Coral Springs,
which is halfway to Jacksonville, sir.
It is not.
It's far, it's not.
Come on.
It's coming.
Come on.
I live up the road.
Listen, I want to tell you, I live in Plantation.
Sir, I live in Plantation.
And to get to Coral Springs, I have to take a freight train.
Okay.
By the time I get there, I want to steal it.
You can use Kyle's directions, you're probably right.
Kyle sticks around Pemberk Pines.
He likes to stay close to home and I can't blame him.
By the way, he has control over turning your mic on it off.
So it would be very nice to come because he's only
got a couple of days left on this shift.
And then he's the bandening, you know, the whole deal.
It says you weren't paying any attention to the directions.
That's what he's writing on the screen.
Ah, okay.
Were you paying attention?
Well, when he said left, it was supposed to be all right.
All right, I got an idea.
Now, how late is this pain in the ass ice cream stir open
that you got?
11 o'clock.
11 o'clock.
And we're going to be eating at nine.
Nine.
Nine.
I'm going to have this very first time.
You're done.
Chocolate fondue.
Oh, yeah.
That sounds a lot better.
Yeah, so maybe I'll make you a deal.
One, I bring it to the melting pot.
When I go there for dinner.
What Friday?
Yeah.
OK.
Is that OK with you?
Sorry, it was me.
Sure.
Why do they have it here?
Maybe that OK.
It's fine with me.
OK.
Dave says it's OK.
Dave says it's OK.
Now, he'll probably get fired for saying that,
but it's OK.
OK, we'll look for you.
OK, I'll look for you too, Neil.
OK, Moishi.
OK.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Mr. Food strikes again.
You know, why don't they just bring in?
Are you hungry now?
There's a little too early for you.
Well, I just woke up.
Why are they setting pizzas on?
Pizza down the way.
Don't you love when these people come in here?
It's like, you know, what do you want?
You know, what can we do for you?
That's basically what it is.
What is it we can do for you?
You want lunch?
Lunch is what there's a too early.
Well, we could order it now.
Yeah, and then in about an hour,
you could work up an appetite, right?
Right, yeah.
We could help you work up an appetite.
We could make you real hungry.
Maybe Elvis Jr. would call.
Mead and last night for the first piece.
Yeah, I'm really amazed.
He's a great guy.
I'm really upset I didn't get to meet him.
He didn't come over.
He's a great guy.
He was talking about his daddy.
I never talked about that.
And he had that young lady was in the shower with him
that day.
He did have a bridge.
He was really good.
Ooh.
Okay.
But he had to go out for a little cheesy five.
Sorry, I missed that.
23 before noon at W.I.N.Z.
And Dave is with us.
And sooner or later, we're going to bring him
to a crescendo here.
So to speak, we'll come back right after this.
Okay.
I only want those people who like seafood
and who like the lamp to listen to me.
Got your attention?
Good.
This is David Glickman talking at you once again
for seafar and the wild, wonderful whiskey creek.

Wait a minute, run this by us again.
What was that you were just telling me?
You go to the chiropractor and he does what to you?
Yeah, it's a little chiropractor center.
You know, it's kind of interesting,
but Dave's only been here like what, 20 minutes,
and he's already given 72 12s, you know?
Which is okay, that's all right.
Just the cows getting writers cramp from putting him on the lawn.
Okay, you go to the chiropractor and they all know about me now.
They all know what about you?
That I've owned on the radio and I'm like a star now, Neil.
Yeah, probably because of you, but you're not, you're not,
it doesn't bother you.
You're not thin skinned like some ice cream scoopers that we know.
No, it's just a radio show.
Nobody's going to touch you here, right?
Nobody's going to attack you.
Right.
What a bet.
Now, just a joke.
Okay, just a show.
And you understand that I understand.
Yeah, it's fine.
It's like a soap opera.
Right.
Or is he slower one?
Okay, let's, where are we taking our next call?
Dave County, right?
Dave.
Okay.
I mean, there's nothing wrong with lusting, right?
No problem with that.
And you love to have every man living in child in the world
lusting after your body.
Yeah, I'd like to be like, yeah, yeah.
You think he's trying to tell us something?
Dave County, hello.
Hi, Neil there.
You're speaking to him.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
I'm calling from Albany, New York.
It's who?
I'm calling from Albany, New York.
Who is this?
Debbie.
Debbie.
No, not me, though.
Debbie does Albany.
I listen to you all the time.
What are you doing in Albany, Debbie?
Yeah.
I just have to back to vacate.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to put you on another line.
Hold on a minute.
Let's put her on and over here because that sounds like hell.
Are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Oh, that's better.
This is where I live.
And I call down there to vacate.
And my mom got me hooked on you.
Wow.
And everybody in my family listens to you.
And I just wanted to tell you that I wish you were up here.
Yeah.
No, not me.
I don't like Albany.
No, it's kind of dirty and cold.
Thank you.
All those hills and, oh, it's just a nasty town, yeah?
Yeah, a lot of snow.
Yeah, already, probably.
I wanted to stay for Monday night, but to meet you at the ice cream store.
Boy, it was beyond belief.
Was it?
We had an imporring rain.
We had over 1,000 people.
Did you really?
Yeah.
Well, I wanted to stay, but they made me.
Not listening to you.
Yeah, that's what it sounded like, Debbie.
Well, maybe we gave her an autograph for some.
Yeah.
Or a hard time.
Yeah.
My grandmother listens to you?
Oh, great.
My dad listens to you?
Wow.
Who does?
Yes, who doesn't, though?
Your husband.
You have one of those.
You don't have one?
Yes, don't listen to you.
Yes.
Good.
Well, that's good.
You understand, Bill.
Well, when are you coming back?
I'll be back in December for the hot.
I usually come like about once every other month.
I got a good job up here.
I can get away.
Boy, no kidding.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, listen, it's great hearing from you.
And give my best to all our good friends in Albany.
So well.
Take it.
And Governor Cuomo, give them a big kiss for us.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Thanks, Debbie.
Bye-bye.
Isn't that nice?
Yes, very.
We're big in Albany.
I'm too big indeed.
No.
Okay, let's go to Browell.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Say hello to Dave.
Somebody say something to him.
How you doing?
How you doing?
What's your name?
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul.
Paul from...
Yes, no.
You miss that.
I miss what?
No.
Go ahead.
I'll tell you what.
No, wait a minute.
I'm going to put this guy on hold.
Let's do what we did that other day.
You don't have to answer him.
Just put him on three.
When I punch one up, put him on three or four.
This one's on.
There we go.
You there?
I'm back.
Okay, because it sounds better that way.
And you can actually hear what these people are saying.
Well, go ahead, Paul.
Dave, whatever your name is Dave.
What's going on?
No, now he can hear you better, because we stuck him in your ear here.
I was at the coop a couple of weeks ago, and I think I know who the mystery person is.
Uh-oh.
He had a spare Bishop out of drag.
Close.
But not a match.
No, no.
There was also a divine there.
I can't.
No.
The two of them were so much close together.
I can't tell who it was.
Not quite.
Your series divine was there, wasn't it?
Yes.
War wasn't it.
God, the first time I was ever at the coop, I got really trash.
It was like six years ago.
Yeah, and I ended up dancing with divine.
There was something that I'll never see.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
So who divine is?
No.
Good.
Something to tell your grandkids about, Paul.
Yeah.
Out right.
Anyway, are you cute Dave?
Excuse me?
Are you cute?
Am I cute?
I don't know.
I asked Neil.
Yeah, he's cute.
On a scale of one to ten, how many fingers do you have up?
Twelve.
Sounds good.
Trust me.
I'll trust you.
But he's an ice guy.
I mean, outside, listen, I got to get this audience over this insanity, you know, this obsession
with this external beauty, okay?
I'm not thinking of it.
I mean, there's internal things too, you know what I'm saying?
You know, I'm thinking of his mind, you know?
Well, there you go.
Now you're talking.
I twist it around, it's not.
I mean, like, can everybody look like Jeff Striker, for example?
Of course not.
Dave wants to check that out.
I mean, Jeff's probably a moron, you know what I'm saying?
Now he'll ever come on the show because I said that.
He talks like one.
Yeah, he talks like kind of a goofball.
Anyway, I wish I'd gone out last night to see you, but I couldn't get out of working so.
I mean, just because we have all these Jeff Striker pictures in here, and now, you know,
probably won't hear another word from Dave the rest of the show.
I'll fix that.
Yeah.
It's your magazine, Tonya.
Now somebody brought that in.
Some disgusting pervert brought that in here.
Nice.
Okay, well listen, is that it, sir?
Are you speechless now?
I'm looking through my own pictures of Jeff Striker.
I'll bet you where you sound like you were reading a little hard when we punched up the call.
That's why.
Anyway, Dave, stop that on Albertsons in Dearshield and say hi to Paul.
So.
All right.
Are you going to do that?
Huh?
Yeah, I'll be there.
You can have a busy schedule.
Now, don't say like indifferent.
You might make some good friends through this show, right?
Right.
Unlikely, I know.
Okay, Paul.
Good luck to you.
All right.
Listen, we got a lot of desperate people out there.
Humor them at least.
Will you put them in?
I mean, humoring me, so why not humor some of them?
Okay, where do we go, Dave?
Dave's on.
Okay, whatever one Kyle wants to put on.
We'll let him, you know, do a little something.
Get involved in the show and he's waning days.
You know, do a little something for us before you abandon the ship.
Hello.
I didn't mean something that little.
Okay, there's nobody on that one.
Let's try another one.
Hello.
Hi, Dave.
Oh, yes.
I want a date.
Who is this?
I don't care what you look like.
It's what's inside the cat.
Is this a male or a female?
I'm a boy.
Somewhere in between, I think.
Yeah, they so.
Can we do anything for you?
I think that was the wrong question.
You could do a lot for me.
Yeah.
What's your name, sir?
RG.
Who?
Reggie?
Reggie.
Nice talking to you, Reggie.
Excuse me?
What do you think, Reggie?
Goodbye.
I think it's time to say goodbye.
I think it's time to say goodbye.
I think it's time to say goodbye.
I think it's time to say goodbye.
Okay, I think this could be Dave's last appearance on the show.
He's already got one foot out the door.
And I'll just say that, you know, they're always going to be a few like that.
At least one.
Okay, where are we going?
Some brown?
Where are we like?
Okay, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, Leo.
You had more people at the Ice Cream Store last night than the Polk had on this cane boulevard.
Yeah, we didn't call it off because it rained.
We went right ahead with it and said all of our prayers and brachles and everything went on as usual, you know.
And everybody brought their babies for blessings.
Yeah.
And it was, yeah, we baptized about 50 people.
About the season.
It was very reminiscent of the Pope.
Yeah.
You know, I thought about that.
Only our people showed up.
It was throwing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm glad you made a mention that the external beauty isn't what it's, Brian is gorgeous.
I mean, I had to go back for a couple of extra ice cream cones.
Yeah.
But nobody's home.
Well, yeah, that's a very good way.
And he's a nice kid.
I mean, let's not see.
These are just innocent bystanders.
They're people who are not interested in being celebrities.
Dave here, for example, wants to be a star.
So he's put himself on a line and whatever crappy gets, he'll have to take it.
But these other people are just innocent bystanders.
And if they don't want to be celebrities, far be it for us to interfere with their lives, right?
Yes.
Well, he is, Dave is trying.
I mean, I'll give him that.
He's trying.
Well, I'll let you exceed it.
I'll let you know later how hard he's trying.
Thank you.
Are you out so to speak or?
Yeah, I bet you'd like to be here with him is what it's all about.
Isn't that what it's about?
That's impossible, but I don't know.
Yeah.
It would be more fun just to talk.
Because I don't want to get you really nervous because he makes Brian look like Quasimodo.
Do you ever see the hunchback of Notre Dame?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
True.
Listen, another thing I wanted to ask.
Did you want to see Don know whether report last night?
No, I didn't see that one.
Well, he said that he was discussing the probability of being a star.
He said, you know, if you're going to be a rain, yeah.
There was a good chance we'd get nailed off and on all my, I had a hard time sleeping.
Oh, boy.
It's a good thing Brian didn't hear that.
I tell you, the weather report is something worth turning on these days.
I would say that, yes.
Okay.
Well, listen, have a wonderful time.
Okay.
When you go back for ice cream, give them all my best.
And we'll see you at the melting pot.
Are you going to, well, listen, are you going to come up to the melting pot Friday night, 9 o'clock?
9 o'clock.
Coral Springs.
I don't know.
It's on sample roll.
I find a baby sitter.
I find a baby sitter.
I have to find a baby sitter.
Call the ice cream store.
They'll probably, uh, spear somebody that I put in the work.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay, bag.
Bye-bye.
Okay, there's the baby.
All of the fall.
Coral's the game is with baby.
That's a good idea.
Now, maybe we could call California for Dave a little later on.
How long could speed of 1 o'clock?
I don't know.
We haven't figured that out yet.
You are a little mysterious.
You do understand that.
Am I really?
Yeah.
And we don't want to pry.
Okay.
But the longer you become a star, the more things that people want to know about you.
Like when you open up that magazine, what was the comment?
What did you say?
Nice.
And know what he said?
Is that what you said?
Was it?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Well, listen, we got lines for everybody.
You know, we've even got lines for him, which is incredible.
It's connected to the...
It's the toll fee number for the Autobahn Society.
Nine minutes till noon at WINZ.
We'll come right back.
Hello, Pemberck.
Pines, you're on the air.
Hi, Neil.
This is Glenn.
I'm at Brick-Oven Pizzeria having lunch.
Do you want me to bring you anything back?
Well, I'm not very hungry, but I haven't eaten yet.
What did you have?
The Brick-Oven Lunch Special.
A garden salad with freshly cut vegetables.
Some garlic bread.
A slice of pizza.
And a coke.
Would you believe that I filled up for just $3?
Okay.
Like I said, I'm not very hungry, so just bring me a toastanti pasta.
A baked ziti with sausage.
A cow's-zoned with pepperoni.
And two of those little pizzas with onion and green peppers.
Oh, yeah.
You might as well throw in an appetizer and some garlic slices with cheese in mushroom.
Okay, Neil.
See you in a little while.
Glenn, since the readers of South Florida magazine voted Brick-Oven Pizzeria,
the best pizza in all of South Florida, Kyle wants to have dinner there tonight.
What's the address?
It's 7100 Hollywood Boulevard.
Halfway between University Drive and the Turnpike.
That's Brick-Oven Pizzeria's 7100 Hollywood Boulevard in Pembroke Pines, right?
Right.

They're beautiful.

Baby, for news, where?
Okay, be sure to come back now because we have very low-main here.
It's seven minutes before noon at WINZ.
Just shape up, okay?
I'm trying.
Was I wrong about him?
He's a nice young man.
Okay, yeah.
When you want to attack him too?
No.
You've attacked all my other guests.
Is there anybody you like?
I attacked one that I've got.
You attacked Don Agony?
You were one of the best skiler when he came in here?
Skiler calls here himself.
Well, he's not there.
Because he doesn't want you to feel bad.
That's not true.
Broward, hello.
Oh, that was good.
I heard that.
Okay, let's go back.
You put him on air.
Because I'm not...
I heard that one.
My batting average is not too good today.
Okay, let's pick one out, Kyle.
Whichever one you like, and pick a number between one and ten.
Hello.
Neil?
Yeah.
All right, how you doing?
Okay.
I'm a first time father.
Great.
I was there last night.
You're kidding.
Yeah, I don't have to remember.
I told you I need Steve.
And his wife that worked there?
You knew Steve?
He's more.
His wife works there.
Worthy ice cream store?
No, no, no.
Oh, yeah, I remember.
Sure.
Okay, and his wife gave Steve a half to give to me.
If you could, just tell her, thank you.
Thank you.
Listen, thank you, Steve's wife.
That was a pretty good turnout last night.
I would say so, yeah, in the rain.
Had to be over a thousand people.
At least.
Yeah, maybe a lot more.
Probably.
Well, just...
I'll just say hi, I guess.
So what were your most lasting impressions of what you saw last night?
No, what's his name?
Now, why would you say that?
I wasn't even thinking about the old what's his name.
Oh, it's there.
The day wasn't even there.
Just the crowd.
Okay.
So you enjoyed it?
Yeah.
Oh, did you see Jill?
Yeah, Jill was there and she said she's mailing the pictures tomorrow.
So by Friday at the latest, she could all those pictures of the ice cream people
and rob over at Windixie and all these other fantasy people, you know?
Right.
And we'll have the pictures blown up into posters and we'll put them out on the highway.
And we'll make stars out of people that don't even want to be stars.
Okay.
Okay.
Talk to Jill quite a while.
Yeah, Jill's great.
Jill's a knockout on.
Okay, see you later.
Okay, bye.
Bye-bye.
Speaking of super stars, what are you bringing in here now?
What did you say three months and seconds?
With you, Dovonning?
Go Dovonning somewhere else.
Would you please...
This is the worst.
Is it bad?
Oh, God.
You mean it's in bad taste?
I mean, no, it's not in bad.
It's just bad before lunch.
Oh, it's lunchtime in a record of how sour vomit.
Sour vomit.
How about cheeseburgers from outer space?
There.
Ain't got no emergency.
By Dr. Hacker.
Dr. Racker, by the way, is one that sent that gigantic envelope.
Did you see it?
It was, you know, this biggest, that window almost.
This biggest, the Carol City.
Okay, thank you so much, Jay, and have a wonderful life.
Now, that's new material.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi, this is my second day listening to you.
And I was wondering why are queer people falling in and talking to me?
Why are queer people calling?
I like to sound like fags, you know what I mean?
Fags?
Yeah, like, I don't know.
You mean like, faggolas?
I'm sure that last guy with pretending to sound like a girl.
Well, maybe he is.
How do you know?
He's a guy.
Maybe he's a little girlish.
Or goish.
For I feel sorry for Dave.
Why?
I know he sounds.
Oh, well.
He sounds what, you see me?
Tony?
He sounds what?
I know the word to describe it.
I don't sound good over the radio.
Is Dave this?
Yes.
How you doing?
What's your name?
Karen from where?
From Fort Leivdau, but I'm just visiting here.
I'm going to some Canada.
Oh, that explains this call, yeah.
Okay, and the American-
You Canadians, very homophobic.
I know there are no homosexuals in Canada, but that's where it goes.
Let me tell you, divine is this?
I know who he is.
Hi, this guy.
No, he's not a guy.
He's a thin.
I'm a Canadian thing.
Why don't you like Canadian people?
Oh, some of them, you know, like the Maple Leafs.
I'm not into hockey.
I know.
Okay.
So, what is it that we're doing to Dave?
Are you upset?
Are you worried about him?
No, no, no, I just feel bad for him because he's a bad guy.
And you guys are in phone damage.
But how about all together?
How about you?
About me.
And how about the young lady that just called moments ago that was salivating,
that was drooling on the phone.
He's got whatever he wants.
Don't you, it's like a sport.
It's like a crank car.
It's like a smorgasbord, don't you understand?
In other words, whatever turns him on, whatever he wants to sample,
it's all there, like on sample road, you know?
You want, Dave, do you want the fake guy's phone here or do you want girl phone?
It doesn't matter to me.
Yeah, so he's flexible.
That's what we try to explain.
He's just an old man.
He's an easy-going guy who gets along with everybody.
Why are you uptight about that?
What's wrong with that?
Isn't that wonderful?
If they want to call me up and say that, that's it.
Yeah, he doesn't care.
If it helps them, he's delighted.
Okay, that's good.
And if we helped you, we're delighted.
All right.
Are we going to see him Friday?
Are we going to see it Friday?
Are you coming up to the Melding Pot Friday?
Do you have dinner with us?
No idea where the Melding Pot Friday is.
It's on sample road in Coral Springs.
Okay.
755-6368.
Okay, give it a shot.
Okay, enough plugs here today.
Okay, we're going to pause now if anybody wants to bring a little lunch by, a little later
on because Dave is a hungry, growing boy, that would be okay.
Mike Wolf's got the headlines.
CBS has the world news, including all the sponsors.
Here again, Neil Rogers.
1207 at W1Z, notice who is conspicuous by their absence.
Bird.
Yeah, not in the room.
He said he was going to live.
You know what this behavior has been very, very peculiar.
Something's definitely wrong with him.
Yeah.
You have noticed that, haven't you?
Strange.
I mean, always strange, but today, bizarre.
See if it's a little depressed about something.
Yeah.
Like maybe some of the limelight.
And especially two days in a row that we've had, you know, just guessed, listeners pop in here
and just sit in on the show.
It's like no big deal, right?
Right.
Wouldn't bother me.
No word to be found.
Now, maybe Brickov, Brick Oven will send over a little something because we do have a celebrity guest in the studio.
We might, you know, I'm not going to overdo it after that big speech before about being force fed all that food.
You know, maybe a couple of little pizzas and antipasto, one of those big CDs and some stuff like that.
Fun.
Be available.
Okay.
Now, at great expense, we're going to play this.
Boy's want sex in the morning, sex in the morning.
When I'm not my best want, sex in the morning, petting and pawing, tearing out my breath.
I want someone who's wins, someone to pin, someone to underpay.
I want someone to fall on, someone to crawl on, someone have a way.
I want sex in the morning, sex in the morning, covers at my knees.
I want rotten condition, path of position.
I am a trapping one, someone who's sleepy, someone who's keeping nothing into taste.
I want somebody first hand, someone to first and then go back to sleep.
There is nothing I like better than a juffle now and then.
With the hands under the sweater and the back that starts to bend.
But before my eyes are open, I don't want to have too hard.
From a simple turn still poking with a thimbleful of pride.
Boy's want sex in the morning, sex in the morning, soiling the sheep.
Sex while I'm yawning, suddenly spawning, when I'm half asleep.
I want someone unconscious, somebody not just waiting for a thre is one.
Sex with surprises, sex with some rises, someone on the pill.
There is nothing like a lover who can satisfy your needs.
And the joy when you discover just how often he succeeds.
But before my eyes can focus, I don't need him to surprise.
By descending lights, the low kiss on the field of sleeping fog.
Boy's want sex in the morning, sex in the morning, when I'm still not fresh.
I want something that strikes him, someone who likes them, falling their blood.
I want someone to take them, someone to break, and comment on their side.
I want someone to pride in someone who not, and then just close her eyes.
I want someone to take them, someone to break, and then just close her eyes.
I want someone to take them, someone to break, and then just close her eyes.
Wait a minute.
I'm like a dagger through my heart, I can't believe he said it.
Except in the morning you said it.
No, I heard a lot.
You're not up in the morning, right? You could get up better.
I used to.
No, I mean more.
No.
Do I want to tell us why?
We don't want to get to work in the morning.
I don't work in the morning.
We don't want to pride, you know.
Now I have sex in the morning.
Oh, okay. Good.
Well, listen, now see, now he tells us that it's afternoon.
Now it's a quarter after 12.
Okay, let's take some more calls.
Davis here.
There's an empty chair, and from what we understand, there are rumblings around the building that the bird's beak is in the group position.
What did we do to him?
What have we done to him?
Can you explain it to me?
I have no idea.
Paul said right in the seat that you're in yesterday, he was a very nice guy.
He was a little nervous when he first came in and he loosened up a little, but he didn't say a lot.
He ate some lunch, which he had to grab away from Mr. Nerd over here.
That was about it.
There was nothing, and we had a good time.
I don't recall anything negative about the show whatsoever yesterday.
Nothing.
Even the callers were good, which on this show is a miracle.
I'm telling you just an absolute wreck today.
We haven't even got a cackle out of him yet.
Maybe you got him nervous.
Is that possible?
It could be.
I think something happened last night to him, actually.
Because I noticed that when he put his hand on your leg that he was starting to get tremble.
Okay, let's take some more calls, and we'll just press on, and if that's the way it's going to be, that's the way it's going to be.
These emotional people, I can't deal with all of it.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Hi.
Sharon, how you doing?
Sharon, how are you?
Okay, I'm sorry.
I wanted to stay out for a while and get to talk to you, but it was so insane there.
I know.
I couldn't believe what a scene that was.
It was great though.
It was really good.
Everybody had a really good time.
There were so many nice people in one place at one time.
That's right.
It was really, really a lot of fun.
And Glenn was really nice.
Well, I know more.
Not anymore.
He's made a quick turn.
You know how they say the worm turns?
Yeah.
I think he ate a few of those worms at the ice cream store last night.
Now tell me how Dave compares to Brian.
You weren't listening before, were you?
No, I came on in.
I said that Dave makes Brian look like Quasimodo on a bad day.
Oh, well.
He is.
He's a very nice looking young man.
He's got a very pleasant personality.
He's flexible.
He's not afraid.
He's not embarrassed and uptight.
He's very extraordinary.
Did you get to speak to Brian last night?
Brian was not what you'd call in a friendly frame of mind.
That's too bad.
No.
Nor was Josh.
I'll tell you who's, and I don't want to start getting into a whole thing and rehash, or kill her hash, or any of that.
But one of the nicest people up there is Michelle.
I must tell you she is just a beautiful young lady and very nice personality.
She's pleasant.
She's friendly.
I get the feeling that Dave is a very nice person.
I get that there are some of the people I want to mention, names, who are a little uptight about all this.
Like Dave said, the fame is so they're embarrassed and are afraid to let anybody know who they are and all of this other stuff.
I can understand that they're kids.
Oh, yeah, that's true.
They're our kids.
But it was such a really warm, nice crowd lift.
I mean, they're miners.
I mean, like David at least is 18.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Like there's a line that you draw there between 17 and 18.
Try.
You know, like the law.
No.
I mean, seriously, like those people are kids.
Where is Dave?
Dave is an adult.
He's a man.
So to speak.
Did you try any of the cookies I gave you?
Oh, those are killers.
They're great.
Oh my God.
Shame on you.
You shouldn't have done that.
I just wanted you to try them.
You can't eat only 10 of those.
Let me tell you right now.
Those were just devastating.
Okay, good.
I'm glad to like them.
I'll try to make them up to the melting pot Friday night.
But listen, I guarantee you you could bet your life on it.
If we have a tornado, we will be there because I wouldn't let Dave down.
Can you make Dave?
Can you make reservations like how far in advance?
I would make them as soon as possible.
Okay.
Real good, I'll.
Friday at nine.
Don't forget.
Okay, I'll be there.
Have you been there before?
Oh, you were there last week.
Well, I went there.
I didn't eat there or anything.
I just went there and looked for you and they said you were...
Well, what good is that?
They want you to come and spend your money.
They want you to come and eat.
Hi, sir.
How's it going?
Somebody was there who ate and was looking for us.
They said it was fantastic.
Right.
Okay.
This time I'll definitely eat whether you're there or not.
No, no, we're going to be there.
Don't say whether we're there or not.
We're going to be there.
Trust me.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll see you then.
And only if Dave waits on us.
That's for absolutely.
Now, how do we know that you're going to wait on us?
How many waiters work there?
Oh, we'll have about eight.
Well, how do we know we're going to get you?
Oh, we don't.
Well, of course you're going to get me.
You just request me.
Right?
Really.
Right.
Okay.
Do you hear that?
I heard that.
You're going to be my only table of the night.
Oh, you see that?
Mm-hmm.
I can hear you.
Listen, Neil, can I get to sit with you at the table?
Yeah.
Is there anyone who can do that?
Yes.
Okay.
Because I like you.
Okay.
Save a seat for me.
Are you not bringing any of those boyfriends or any of those...
I'll just maybe bring my husband or I'll come myself.
Oh, your husband?
Yeah, that would be okay.
I mean, you know, for once make it legitimate, you know?
Okay.
I mean, this is the only...
You know, I don't want to say tramp would be a terrible word, but...
Just a joke, Sharon.
Come on.
Okay.
Lighten up.
All right. Great.
It's great talking to you, Neil.
All right. So what should we do?
Should we make the reservation for...
Because I don't want all these other people want to get in the act,
because we can't do anymore, you know?
Okay.
But we can certainly have dinner with you.
Okay. Sounds good.
Okay.
See you Friday.
Thanks.
Bye.
How do you like that?
Unbelievable.
Is this going to be exciting or what?
Yeah, it should be a great time.
Should be fantastic.
Yeah.
We'll set you up in a great big table.
Great.
Have a little party back.
Yeah.
And we'll kind of like see you in the middle and everybody can stare at you.
Yeah, we'll cover me in chocofon, do.
Dave, try to restrain yourself, okay?
All right.
Because I have a lot of great lines for that.
But it's a family show.
It's a family show.
You notice this chair?
Empty.
Empty.
I don't want you to feel guilty.
I got a good idea for you.
Move over in that chair.
Because all day yesterday, Paul wanted to sit over here.
And I said, now the bird sits there.
See, pretty soon I'll have him right over here.
No, but you sit there.
And now that's a hint, isn't it?
Okay.
Doesn't it feel better sitting over in that chair?
Yes.
Yeah, better position.
Okay, let's take the next call here from a date I do believe.
Hello.
Are you doing new?
Good.
What's up?
Listen, I just got finished watching my third Jeff Striker movie.
Oh, you'll be ill in that bit.
I was telling you.
I never see anything.
It's a good thing he can do what he does because he can't act.
Yeah, he's got a limited vocabulary.
There's no question about that.
Sure.
That's true.
Now my neighbor gave me a cassette.
It has three Jeff Striker movies on it.
It's pretty good.
Your neighbor gave you what?
A cassette with three Jeff Striker movies on it.
Okay, what kind of neighborhood you live in, sir?
That's right.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, go ahead, sir.
I'm sorry.
I had a question for Dave.
Cover your ears, Dave.
Do you have anything in common with the Jeff Striker?
Not that I know of.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
All right, just a minute.
I'm going to open to a page.
Whatever page this is.
All right, now you can look at the picture again.
Ask the question again, sir.
Do you have anything in common with Jeff Striker, Dave?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
I think he's trying to tell you something, sir.
Do we have a, David, have a phone number?
If he does, you're not going to get it.
I'll tell you that right now.
It's my job to protect our guests.
Okay.
The audio.
See, we make you a superstar.
You know, you're super.
Wanted by the whole human race.
Yeah.
Wouldn't that be great?
Yeah.
And it's all because of you.
Okay.
Well, let's take our next call and braw it.
Hello.
Hello.
A rate called Food is on the way from Brickovan.
How do you like that?
Great.
Is that service?
Unbelievable.
Is that service or what?
Service beyond belief.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Hi.
Hi.
Who's this?
It's Chrissy.
Chrissy.
Wow.
Chrissy.
Chrissy from the mountain pot.
Yeah.
How you doing?
Okay, how are you?
Now, Chrissy, let me tell you about Chrissy.
Please.
She quit her job just so she could listen to the show today.
No.
Come on.
Am I right?
No, I didn't quit.
What did you do?
I just took off for the day.
Yeah.
She took off for the day.
She's goofy.
For you.
No for you.
She wanted to hear you.
So what are you doing over there, Chrissy?
Nothing just listening to you guys on the show.
Dave's doing a really good job at playing with you.
And you work with Dave?
Yeah, I do.
How long have you known him?
Since what, Mark?
Ever?
And how well do you know I'm Chrissy?
Pretty well.
Really?
Yeah.
Like real well?
Like, no.
No, just close friends.
Oh, I see.
No, I'm, listen, I'm not prying.
I'm not trying to get, you know.
No, we're pretty close now.
Pretty close?
Yeah, we're pretty close.
Real close.
Yeah.
Yes.
Huh?
The red tape says.
Okay.
See, there's kind of an interesting relationship in other words.
Like Dave thinks you're pretty close and you think like, you know, he's okay.
Whatever, whatever.
Yeah.
Is this your first time calling?
Yeah.
Well, I've been called, I called before, but I never got through it so finally I did.
Okay, great.
Well, listen, it's been exciting, Chrissy.
Okay, yeah, I'm happy, really.
Is this your first time calling, ever?
I'm not ever, but the first time I got through.
Boy, what a, what a day, huh?
Yeah.
You take off from work so you can hear your boyfriend on the ear.
Yeah.
And what, why did you laugh when I said that?
Is that the wrong expression to use?
Well, he's not my boyfriend, really close friends.
We're just close friends.
Yeah, but I just wanted to tell him that he's been really close.
See, I'm getting, I'm getting some mixed signals here.
Like he said you were real close and he smiled like, you know, like there was something there that, you know.
Now Michael, I'm just joking if you listen.
Now I'll be curious.
Ooh.
Well, wait a minute.
Oh, boy.
Now, see, now we've reached a point in the show where I think we may have nowhere to go back to.
You know what I mean?
Okay, listen, it's great hearing from you.
Okay, Neil, I really enjoy you so I want to see a Friday night.
We'll be there with Belzon.
Yes, he missed you.
Thanks, Chrissy.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
No, we'll be there.
Trust me.
You'll have so many people there you won't know whether the screamer eat a banana.
Don't you find it bizarre that he just kind of waddled out of here?
And look at Kylie's having hysterics.
He's going into a coma from all of that.
Just waddled out of here and he just never will be seen again.
I mean, what is his story?
Mr. Jellis?
Of what?
I think we need to have a talk, you know, like that.
Just let us know.
No, don't you think we need to have a talk with him like about the birds and the bees, stuff like that?
No, seriously.
I'm not joking.
23 past known at W.I. and Z.
Dave is here today and the other thrown is empty, but life goes on.
Well, we have bowling on Monday night.
I used to be a good borer that may come as a shock to you, but I used to have it at 280.
I used to bowl in three leagues.
That's better than me.
Back in my Michigan days, many years ago.
Well, Leo, we have a league on Monday night.
But I haven't picked up a ball in the year, sir.
A bowling ball at it.
So it doesn't matter.
We have a league on Monday nights.
It's gay bowling.
Gay bowling?
Oh, boy.
About 160 of us.
What do you guys do?
Ballside saddle or what?
No, no, no, it's a lot of fun.
I'll bet.
And we've all, you know, we've all think it's a good idea for you to come.
Now, I want to ask you one question.
How many holes are there in the ball, sir?
Three.
The conventional three.
Very good.
That's excellent.
And finger tip, of course.
Keep all your fingers occupied.
Good.
Anyway, I think it would be a great idea for you to come by.
Maybe you got at least one by ten.
And you'd probably like to invite Dave to come and bowl in the league two note doubt.
Of course.
That's not a Pizali, so to speak.
Oh, you don't have to be gay to bowl, you know, it's not really.
Oh.
Most bowlers aren't gay.
Matter fact, most bowlers are what?
Are gay or not gay?
No, are not.
Oh, I'm glad you said that.
I thought we were going to get into professional wrestling.
We gave you a bowl of bowling alley.
See, let me say something to you in all seriousness.
Okay.
And this is nothing to do with you.
It just came to my mind.
And now is a good time to say it.
Okay.
All right.
One of the things, no, I want you to listen.
I want you to respond to it.
One of the things that people in this audience, many of them, including the dirtiest,
minded, sickest ones, the ones who think that I'm the pervert, these people don't understand.
It's very possible to have friends and not have sex with them, isn't that right?
Absolutely.
For example, all of the straight males in the audience who got male friends, okay?
They got a lot of friends.
They don't have sex with them, but they have friends.
And some of them are good friends, okay?
The women out there who go shopping with their lady friends.
When they go home, they don't, you know, do what does lesbian and dilate.
I mean, they're just their friends.
And it's, you know, life is in rich, for example.
Dave here is a nice guy and has an incredible personality, which I can't believe.
He's just too almost unreal, you know, that he takes all of this and it doesn't phase him.
You know, he's just an easygoing guy.
And he's a nice guy.
What does he swing?
Come on.
See, there you go again.
Just kidding.
You've got to stop with this, all right?
In other words, I would love to have 20 friends just like Dave.
Now maybe one of them, of course, you know, you always say that you've got 40 friends like me.
No, I don't.
I have no friends like Dave.
I'm not the only one who used to think that every guy I used to introduce her to, we were sleeping.
See, there you go.
Of course.
Every single, I mean, even straight guy, that our friends and minds still are.
You know, they, she's think that, well, you know, what are you doing with this guy?
You know, be careful.
Yeah, exactly.
You know, be careful with all the disease.
Right.
And in the meantime, you probably weren't doing anything.
No, no, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, it's not a matter of me.
Very few that I even introduced the mob that I answered, even with.
And then right now is only one.
Yeah.
But, you know, it just goes to show everybody things like that.
If you're gay, you are.
Well, no, but even if you're anything, but especially gay, I guess.
But anything, I mean, like Stan comes on, he does all this thing about trolling.
And yeah, okay, he's desperate.
But in the meantime, well, I shouldn't use him as an example.
I think that was a bad example.
True.
But anyway, back to bowling.
Okay.
Come on.
Come, come, bowl one by day.
We've had Brian out there.
Alice has been there once.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian.
Brian, North Carolina.
Oh my gosh.
I'd love to have seen that.
It was wonderful.
I think you should do neighborhood weather from there, but that's at the point.
And you had Alice out there?
Alice.
Yeah, the very same Alice who was at the copa in this picture.
What picture?
The one from the weekly news that I have here, the picture from the copa with these other two very amazing looking people.
Oh, no, I missed that.
Yes, I have it right in my hand.
And the Dave is rolling on the floor looking at it right now as I speak.
I have to run out and get that.
It's the September 16th issue of the weekly news.
Page 39 in the upper right hand corner.
Oh, blow it up and send it somewhere.
I'll pass.
So, you know, if you play the middle of the game, it's like a very name.
What?
You Monday night.
I mean, it's at 9 o'clock.
You could come bowl one game.
Pick up a ball.
You still have your bowling ball?
You've got to be kidding me.
Why?
I sold it.
OK, when I was unemployed, I sold my bowling ball and my bag.
We have a houseball.
We have houseball.
I'll bet you did.
I'll bet.
Anything.
I think it'd be interesting.
You know, we all...
Well, I'll give it some thought.
No.
You know where it's at?
No.
OK.
Well, why don't you tell me that would be a concern?
I don't know if I should say because you know, Monday night we'll have a hundred people show up to see what the boy...
Wait! What's wrong with that?
No, you're right.
It's a bird bowl.
Some of them might be good.
At bird bowl Monday night, it's at nine o'clock.
And it's a lot of fun.
And you know, you don't have to be gay.
I want to say that.
You know, as a matter of fact, we have...
Well, OK, I won't be.
OK, that's what you want.
I won't be.
I'll stop.
I'll just stop.
It'll make a lot of people happy.
Yeah.
But think about it and show up one Monday and give us a thrill.
OK, so to speak.
So to speak.
OK, see you later.
I will win you ball.
Thank you.
Call 34 at WYNZ.
We've had everything from bowling to incest today.
And we're moving onward and upward.
Let's take a call from Broward.
You want to?
Sure.
Yeah.
But you just agree, you see.
I get nervous.
No, I really do.
I get nervous when people are so agreeable to everything.
Like, I have the feeling if I asked him seriously,
would you like to...
I can't say that on here.
I mean, like anything.
You just...
Just...
Have you always been like that?
OK, we'll take one from day.
Yeah.
No, we're going to take it from Broward.
I have to find a spot at which to, you know,
take control back of the show.
Broward County, speak to us.
Unbelievable.
I know it really is.
It's a good time.
OK, go ahead.
Hey, dude.
What's happening, dude?
What's happening with you?
Hey, Dave.
Hey, how you doing?
This is John.
John?
John.
From Springs.
Oh.
How you doing?
Do I know you?
How does the Nelson plot Friday night?
Oh.
I was looking at you.
Yeah, I remember you, but I thought you were from Bo-Bointing.
Boca.
You're Boca.
I work out in Boca.
Boca.
Right.
Same difference.
Boca, Bo-Bointing.
How you doing, John?
You're good.
Probably come back out Friday night.
If Neil's going to be out there, Neil.
I'll be there.
He'll be there.
Definitely be there.
What's the name?
The bird will not be there, though, by the way.
The bird.
You know, speaking of the birds,
when Dave ought to do it, get together and redo your brick oven commercial.
With Dave at one end, do it the other, but make an melting pot commercial.
Hey, Neil, this is Dave.
It's a melting pot.
Yeah.
That's what we have here.
That sounds good.
Well, if the melting pot wants to buy some advertising, that would be a good way to do it.
Okay.
Hey, you know what else?
Two.
That girl shared.
Would you put this pot?
She's part of your fore-day shake and one-eye.
Do you have any desire to be in this business?
Excuse me for going on, but I'm just curious.
Do you have any desire to do any of this?
Why do you have any openings?
Oh, boy.
That was a terrible thing to say.
Can't you believe he asked me that question?
I'm sorry, sir.
Go ahead.
Dave just said something awful on the radio.
Now, Neil, you've got a terrific program.
I listened to you daily and got caught up.
Sorry, today, when, so when you called me and said,
David mentioned my name over the air.
And I'm kind of busy, so I won't tell you guys up.
Neil, I've come by for a night.
What are you saying?
You do.
Sure, so you're going to be out there.
We'll stop in Dave.
We'll make reservations today and see the both of you out there, I guess.
Well, let me ask you this question.
Go ahead, Neil.
Because I'm always curious about this.
Like, all these people came by last night, and it was great.
I mean, they were, I can't begin to tell you what a positive,
because they were all nice.
I mean, each person was nicer than the other one.
Which means the first one may not have been all that great.
But by the time we got to the end, they were sensational.
But seriously, what is the deal?
Because I know there's one host, Mr. Ego, in town.
I always used to come watch a seat, come watch a seat.
Which I don't, I can't think of very many people.
I would love to go watch Eat Dinner, sit around and watch the meat.
What does that mean?
The drawer is you.
The drawer is you, Kyle, the bird, and...
Well, Kyle's not going to be there.
Okay, but not just that in general.
You guys, I hear you in the radio.
And the birds definitely not going to be there under penalty of death.
Hey, everybody, what are you doing?
Showing the floor.
Yeah.
Dave, Dave should be in your chair today, and you should be down on the floor.
You do a great job.
Oh, listen.
That we can get in a lot of trouble with that scenario.
I can just see that now.
Okay, here about the style here about the radio.
The features, the oversized, heavy set man.
The drawer is the easy go and talk on the radio.
Yeah.
The way things happen.
The gay rights or the...
Bicycle, whatever.
Whatever, you know, be whatever you are, exactly.
This is the drawer, the floor.
And we're trying to find out what Dave is, but he won't tell us.
And then go right into the mung brain over the...
Right.
Boy, this guy is really just rambling along.
In the year, you're excellence, sir.
You're really out of sight.
But here's the shaken.
You what?
Like, like, here's...
Me too.
I'm sure.
Dave, he tried to get in a little closer.
I got a little closer.
Any minute, go along the floor.
And a half-kissed.
Okay, well, listen, sir, I think you've really done yourself quite a number here.
Okay, Neil, I'm going to swing by there and share it with you.
I'm going to swing your booth and perhaps I can take too many to your time and get in the booth with you all not.
Well, we don't want to all squeeze in there, you know, but we certainly would be delighted to say hello and, uh, whatever else.
Yeah.
And Dave, we'll see you out there, too.
Yeah, great, John. Thanks for calling.
Okay.
See you, John. Take care.
In other words, that's Bob. Good bye, right?
Get rid of him.
Yeah.
Okay, let's take one from Dave next.
We do have one open line.
I should give these numbers out.
I never do any off-flange like that, because they just go nuts.
And that's because you're here today.
They just...
You don't believe that?
What?
That the lines are going nuts here.
Can't you see them? They're all flat.
We got seven lines. They're all...
Of course.
Is it bad?
I don't know what all these buttons mean.
Look, look at the phone.
Can you see the lights flashing?
Yeah, I see a lot of empty ones.
No, those are not... Those are business lines.
These are the calling lines here.
I'll say you had open ones here.
Now, that's the, uh, bat line.
That's the inside line.
All of these are the top lines.
Seven.
Seven, that's it.
Count them.
Are all seven of them in my line?
Why is one not flashing?
Because it's... That's the one that we're going to put on the ear.
Okay.
Any more questions?
That's it.
Okay.
I'm ready to take control.
Do you want to sit down over here and I'll sit over there?
No, you're staying your spot.
Why?
It'll be a disaster.
I mean, you have no idea what any of this is.
But you come in here right away.
Oh, and you had two buttons there.
You press them.
Yeah, simple.
Even a moron could do this, right?
Oh, okay.
Hello.
He has left the room, but...
Hello.
Oh.
Yes.
I need your...
Cloud.
The cloud that comes with your name.
Okay.
You need to...
Will you do me a favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Oh, thank you.
Would you call Grinnell Park and find out what's going on over there?
Why?
There is lots of movie, the star movers, and cameras, and people, and I'm dying to know who's over there,
and I called and they won't tell me.
Maybe they're shooting vise over there.
Oh, and I stay had that last time.
We don't want to see that.
Maybe it's someone important.
Maybe it's Jeff's striker.
Oh, boy.
Ooh, couldn't you call and find out?
Okay, I'll do that right now.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Yeah.
No, that's not it.
I think this...
They shot vise there last year, and it wasn't as big as this.
Ooh, don't wrinkle that up now.
Oh, please.
Oh, God.
Okay, I'll call right now and find out.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay, this could be something really exciting.
It could be...
Un-
Reliable.
Okay.
Or, on the other hand, it could be...
Total waste of time.
Let's find out.
Are you excited about this?
May?
Yeah.
You know, looks like the excitable type.
You look very calm and laid back.
This is 9-76-JF.
In just a moment, you and up to either of the colors
will be connected blind with the incredible Jeff's driver.
To talk to Jeff, call between 2 and 10 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Or, on the other hand, meet other colors.
Exchange numbers or just listen to it.
Have fun.
Yeah.
I love that voice, don't you?
Yeah.
You could be on the sheet.
Like in the morning, maybe.
When they have that big opening, so to speak.
We're waiting with baited breath.
Are you getting nervous?
Or are you going to sleep?
What's going on here?
We're waiting.
We're waiting for something to happen on the phone day.
Don't panic.
We're waiting.
I'll get in the way.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, listen, I think at that point we better interject.
But that was pretty exciting.
Did you like it?
Yeah, it was interesting.
What are you going to voyeurism a little bit?
I don't even know if that is.
You don't know what that means.
In other words, watching people do certain things.
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah, that's going to be a stimulating right?
Right.
Okay.
Well, let's turn the lights out and Kyle can watch.
Only a joke.
Okay.
Let's go back to the phone.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, speak to Neil, please.
You got him, sir.
How you doing?
Oh, how you doing, Neil?
Real good.
You have no idea.
Yeah, I think they're shooting police academy 5 out there.
Is that it?
Yeah, I believe that's what it is.
Oh, boy.
Another great movie to South Florida's credit, boy.
We get all the biggies.
I hear that.
I thought maybe it would be Porky's 9.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, the cast, speak to Dave.
You got him.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, Dave's, how you doing?
Nothing bad.
Got some real nice looking waitresses.
We do?
There you go.
Oh, there's Chrissy, of course.
Oh, okay.
And we got Lisa.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
That's about it.
I've got to be better than some of the women I saw down at the ice cream place.
Oh, come on.
Now, there were some really attractive people there last night.
There were few, you know, I mean, not everybody can be fantastic.
Not everybody can look like Michelle.
Oh, Michelle was a guy.
She was fine.
You bet.
I'm in love with her.
In fact, I was almost considering making the big switch.
Oh, well, you better watch that now.
Yeah, I know.
I may get that operation, sir.
Well, listen to you.
Okay, I'm good one.
Okay.
That's you later.
There we go with a horny old man.
Okay, let's take one from Dave County just because we love our friends and Dave.
Hello.
See what I mean?
We love them, but they hate us.
That's the way it's been all my life.
Let's try another one, Carl.
There's nobody there.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Dale.
Yes, sir.
How's it going?
Okay, wake up.
Pal, come on.
Well, you know, the film's only been written here for like a 45 minutes.
Wow, that's okay.
Keep you out of trouble.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, dude.
I think you got problems with the birds.
I think you're bringing these young attractive guys on the show.
You know, he's getting a little wild.
Yeah, he got, he couldn't handle it.
I mean, Paul yesterday he was nervous about, but when Dave came in today, he just crumbled.
He couldn't handle this.
Listen, does he got along here?
The bird?
Yeah.
Minimal.
Minimal here.
Like he's got about as much hair as you'll Brenner did, may he rest in peace?
Huh?
Have you ever seen Tully Sivalas, sir?
It's straight, though, right?
We don't, we have no idea.
He flies a rather crooked path.
Yeah, so we have no idea.
It's bizarre.
You know, you talk about...
What difference does it make?
In his case, especially.
Well, a lot of difference.
We need like to know?
No.
Not in the least, have no interest.
No interest, sir.
Did all?
No.
All right, so what else is going on?
I hear Dave's on the line.
Dave is here.
What do you mean what else is going on?
Oh, I want to know what's happening.
You know, I call you every day.
You call us every day?
Every day.
Yeah, I don't get through that.
Oh, I see.
It isn't the phone ring, like, you know, 50, 60 times.
Yeah.
Well, it was a full and rich life.
Just say what?
A full and rich life?
Yeah.
No, I know.
You're just loyal and devoted, right?
Yeah.
I got it, and then when nobody else was.
I know.
Yeah.
When we really needed you, you were there.
Neal.
Yeah.
What do you think of this football strike?
I'm delighted.
I'm so happy about it.
You have no idea.
Yeah.
Baseball.
Baseball play officer coming up now.
The twins have clenched.
Yeah.
And the giants.
It's going to be great because you've got Toronto and Minnesota and San Francisco and
Cardinals.
You've got three out of the four teams.
Our teams that usually are not in it, okay?
Which is great.
David, who's talking about my...
Are you a baseball fan?
Yeah, I'm not.
Okay.
So in other words, you're not going to be impressed by my deal Murphy plaque that somebody
brought over last night.
Oh, I am impressed.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's impressive.
You'd be impressed too if you looked like deal Murphy.
But go ahead, sir.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
You know, I don't mind hanging out there.
As soon as I said that, he dropped the plaque.
But other people took his hands off and dropped it.
Go ahead.
Your friend Steve, Steve did on this station?
Well, Mr. Ego, yeah.
What about him?
But a moron.
Oh, come on.
Oh, my God.
I mean, it may be true, but let's not, you know, not for us to say that.
That's okay.
He is embarrassing himself.
I mean...
Yeah.
I heard that he's doing something about, let's support the scabs or something.
And, yeah, let me tell you something, all right?
He tells you that there's none of our business how much money they make and all this kind
of stuff.
Unless, not getting a personal life, and then he brings up Lori and the three quintelists.
Oh, yeah.
And he goes on and on and on.
And he called Lori the other day.
They were talking about...
What did he call her?
Sure.
Well, not as much as we did.
But listen, what he did was he called it because he had a...
He had a person on the show that was talking about being a showman as pig, and he called
his wife and says, am I a showman as pig?
And he says, yes, you are.
And do you know the day wasted?
It was a waste.
I mean, it was a good call.
But they wasted like 30 minutes of money, air time.
Yeah, like we're wasting all this money, I'm not sure how I'm talking about it.
We'd be different.
You're getting paid to hear me talk.
Oh, no.
What, but they pay me by the minute now?
That sounds good.
What he says, what?
He came on and said that he makes a high risk.
That wasn't right.
200.
Huh?
He makes 200.
Oh, he says, you know, I worked 45 years to make $100,000 to get to 100,000.
Well, now he's making two, sir.
Trust me.
I don't give a damn if he makes...
No, I don't, for my party can make five because if he makes one or he makes five or 20,000,
he still sucks.
You know what I mean?
I'm just gonna have a one, listen, have a great day.
I gotta take this break now or Kyle's gonna get real nervous.
Take it.
One?
Take a break.
Okay.
Right, I'll read the dirge.
There he goes.
12 minutes, did he sound a little surly at the end of the...
Are you leaving?
Now, where are you going?
I'm here.
Look like you were about to spring up and everybody's like leaving today, you know what I'm saying?
If I, did I use my right guard today?
I thought so.
I mean, I left the house rather freely, but did I do something wrong?
Now, do I need to apologize?
No.
Have we offended you?
Nope.
Do I offend the bird?
Yes.
Yeah.
Can you do that?
Can we give a sigh?
Ah.
Boy, Bob Lasseter.
Hang your head in the shade.
Ten minutes.
Put your clothes back.
I want you to please.
Ten minutes before one.
No, seriously.
He's getting up to take his clothes off.
This ought to be very exciting.
I think we discovered something here today.
Were you gonna let me have one of those or not?
I don't want to take your last cigarette.
I don't smoke.
And I don't want to encourage anybody to smoke.
But I figured if I do everything that Dave does, we're gonna weak.
I'll look just like he does, and then there'll be no more problem now.
I notice he's not...
Look at this!
Oh.
Oh my god.
Are you cereal or what?
Holy Toledo brick oven pizza is just brought in the whole store.
What do you guys do?
You're closing up for a couple of weeks or what?
Nine pies.
Boy, oh boy.
Do we take care of you or what Dave?
I don't believe it.
What?
What probably if you take the...
You don't have to be bashful in here.
Just take over.
Everybody else does.
Just start digging in.
No drinks with this.
Come on Dave.
It wouldn't buy all the drinks you want.
Relax.
Relax.
Look at all this stuff.
What are we gonna do with the Chinese army?
Well, we want first, and then we'll let the rest of the people come in.
Okay?
Those are garlic slices.
Those are fantastic.
I believe it.
Yeah.
Never had one of them.
Everything's marked.
Okay, let's take a call while our guest is going through an attack of gluttony.
Thank you very much.
That was beyond my wildest expectations.
See, do we take care of you or what?
We've got to tip them.
They don't want to be tipped.
What do you think this is?
The melting pot?
All right.
Broward.
Hello.
Move them.
How you doing now?
Okay.
Okay.
I've got a phone number for you.
If we got food here, boy, we should share it with the audience.
1-900-660-Hoke.
Jim and Tammy Bakers, New Phone Noises.
Oh, is that it?
1-900-Hoke.
660-Hoke.
Oh, I love that one.
2-000 phone calls.
Oh, we don't care.
We got luck.
This show is loaded.
I know.
I mean, Money Magazine, Golf Digest.
We're loaded on this show, you know?
How's the pizza?
We haven't touched it yet.
What's this garlic slice when it sounds pretty good?
Oh, yeah.
Those are great.
It's like a pizza, but it's in slices.
It's got garlic.
Thank you so much.
That was good.
I just want to let you know that phone number.
That's all.
That's all I was going to call.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Hi, Viva Dirge.
1-4-3.
Hi.
Great.
I feel like I'm back in college again.
I'm smoking.
I just smoke new ports.
Three packs a day.
Now you stick this guys?
Yeah, now I smoke.
I'll go cancer sticks.
Big ones.
Okay.
Let's take another call from Dave.
What do you say?
Sounds good.
Sounds good.
Sure.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Good.
What's up?
What's up, dude?
Dave, it's Paul.
How you doing?
Down in Miami and running the melting pot down here.
Wow.
You got all your friends calling in here.
Hi, Dave.
So, is this the one down in Kendall?
This is the one down in Kendall, yes.
And what I wanted to know, Neil, is you're making reservations.
My manager called me and a lot of people are calling in.
And I wanted to know how many people are going to be on your table.
On my table or at my table?
No, it's plain.
We have two different sides table.
There will only be one person on the table and he's sitting to my right right at the moment.
He'll be on the table.
He'll be centered directly in the middle.
I've covered with chalk with fondue.
You told them about that, huh, Dave?
Yes.
That's only for special customers.
Only for me.
Trust me.
I'd pay serious money.
But anyway.
Guys, we're trying it.
We're trying it.
I mean, I have gold card, green card.
I even have an immigration green card.
So, anything you like.
I heard about that.
But, I guess they're going to be four of us because Stan and I and Sharon is bringing one of her illicit relatives or something.
I don't know.
So, I guess four.
Lucid or lucid?
Lucid.
Lucid relative.
Yeah, elusive.
And lucid, okay.
So, there'll be four of you, total.
And one person centered in the middle.
Yeah.
And we got it now.
You think you can hold them down?
I need to clarify that.
How many guys does it take to hold him down?
Although, I guess we can find that out during CBS News.
Says the joke.
It's just a joke.
It's just a joke.
No, I'm serious.
Do you know how long have you known Dave?
Well, I've known Dave actually.
My name's Paul on the owner of the melting pot.
Yeah, we know.
Dave started building with it.
He started what?
He built the...
Yeah, that's what he told me, yeah.
Yeah, he started, he walked in one day and I go, oh boy.
But, I mean, you said, oh boy?
He didn't look so good.
What do you mean?
He made a game of job.
Well, what happened to him all of a sudden?
It looks pretty good now.
He became a master's stain technician is what it was.
Well, we don't want to...
Listen, I mean, it's a family show.
Oh, no, stain technician.
He stained all the wood.
Oh, I see.
Well, even then, I'm not so sure we can talk about it.
It could be actionable, you know what I mean?
I understand.
I understand.
And Dave's been with us about a year now.
A year and a half, I guess.
But I mean, he's...
He always had this...
Like, kind of disposition, because I find it very bizarre for people to be just so like...
Nothing seems to phase him.
He's very lethargic, yes.
No, I didn't say lethargy.
Come on, Paul.
See, you're just using that as an excuse to underpay him.
I think you own the big raise personally.
I mean, it's thus went off my back, yeah.
He's very kick back, yeah.
But he's good.
He's got a real good person out.
Yeah, he does.
He gets a lottery question.
How do a person you just like to fold up, put in your trunk and take home for a few days?
You know, and just sit there and laugh, you know.
Am I right?
Exactly.
You see, I've got him paid perfectly.
He's just a Mr. Goodtime Charlie, you know?
That's Dave.
That's something about that's correct.
Yeah, see, I'm a very good judge of character.
And what's on the outside?
It doesn't always tell you what's on the inside, right?
Direct two.
Yeah, some people put on a facade.
That's right.
And we know what that is.
But this is the real thing.
Exactly.
No, that's the real.
You got the real Dave right there.
Absolutely.
What you see is what you get.
And the cigarette is right hand, right?
Yes, he does right now, as we speak.
Who Dave?
I won't tell you what he's got in his left hand, but it's a family show, Paul.
I understand.
So listen, this better...
I'm sure this is going to be great because we've had ray of reviews
and everybody has said it's sensation.
And I get another hostel letter from the people at P. August because, you know...
I mean, I would have gotten up there eventually, but it's just, you know, life doesn't work.
If I were there, if they would hire some Foxy help up there, I would work there immediately, you know.
I understand.
If these people would just find out where my team might change their mind about me, after you see Paul, I don't know.
Really?
Yes.
Why is that?
He's a good-looking man.
How old is he?
He's your boss.
He's about 25, 26.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm 25 years old.
I'm a hard work.
I'm dedicated to fondue.
And you're the boss?
I'm the boss, man.
It's a young company.
It's a young company.
What does he do?
Does he force you to do a lot of tacky things up there or what?
I mean, that you can talk about?
Basically, you run a real relaxed crew, right?
Well, that's what we got.
Yeah, you really do.
I can't get over it.
Maybe that's probably why the bird left the room because he couldn't cope with all this goings on here with somebody who was so...
At home, he just seems to fit in here like a glove.
So to speak.
Fits in everywhere, you know?
I don't think he's ever been put in a situation he feels uncomfortable.
I have to do that.
Yeah, it's a matter of fact, last night.
Why, what happened?
Anything we can talk about?
Now, really?
Oh, you meant the ice cream place?
I don't know what time it got off work.
I was down on my hand.
Did you go to the ice cream place?
No, I couldn't.
So what did he talk about?
I don't know.
I guess it's something we'll have to discuss during the news break, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right, then, guys.
You guys doing a great job.
Thank you.
Of what?
A promoting fondue?
Yeah, you bet, man.
I'm telling you what.
You'd better be great because, you know?
Oh, it is.
I'm not even worried about that.
As long as you get david away, then nothing can go wrong.
Well, that sounds good to me.
Okay, Paul.
Well, listen, you're going to be there, right?
Oh, yeah, I'll be there.
Oh, boy.
I'm always there Friday, sir.
Well, maybe you can hold him down on the table for us.
Well, we have special clamps that are underneath.
Okay.
See you Friday.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Okay.
Well, listen, we're going to eat now, and you tell me a couple of those little stories.
Now, when we come back, we'll take some more calls, and we're just...
You know, we're all the hungry people in the building came from.
Right away.
From Zeta, from all the way to the building.
Okay.
Well, listen, they have good reason to be hungry, but that's another story.
Just kidding, Peter.
Just a joke.
It's just a joke.
No problem.
But we, again, want to thank Ray because he's feeding the starving here.
He's just doing a fantastic job.
And your wildest dreams, when you came here, did you ever believe that you'd just...
You would be seen in front of you that you would be treated like a king or close to it.
Okay.
Let's take some more calls here because the phones seem to be just foaming at the mouth, don't they?
The callers?
Okay.
Probably the callers are for Dave and not for me anymore because they forget.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Oh, that's me.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Nea.
How are you doing?
That's me.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Nea.
Oh, pretty good.
Okay, let's...
We could do that one day.
We could do the time tunnel.
I'll just talk to myself.
I'll interview myself a lot better than most of the more I'd said.
All right.
Okay, let's try another one.
Hello.
Is this going to go on the whole hour?
I don't know.
Hello.
I don't think they want to talk to you.
All right.
One more.
And then that's it.
Then we'll just go to music.
We'll change the format.
We'll go to music.
Hello.
Hello, Nea.
Oh, boy.
You saved the show, sir.
I bet that's the story of my life.
You must listen to me very closely at a much time, too.
Okay.
I'm listening very closely.
You know, Jamie and Marcy.
Yeah.
That didn't last night.
They were there last night.
My brother, if he knew I was listening, I'd be in grave danger.
Why?
Well, all over the country, Neal, and this has been going on for several years.
He doesn't know I'm calling.
They wore unsuspecting talk show hosts to their home for dinner.
And they're never heard nor seen from again.
Who said, Neal?
It's been said that they forced fees in a large kosher-dill pickle until they're busting
at the gut.
And it's sad.
It's scary.
I don't know what to do.
I feel evil.
Yeah.
I had to warn you.
I had to let you know.
Well, you may have to save a couple of desperate talk hosts, or you do realize that, don't you?
They took your picture last night, and I saw it.
They blot.
We're over in our pants, huh?
Eating dinner.
I just want to straighten out of one thing, though.
There were no people at the sterilized night with giant pickles.
They keep them in their house in jars.
They're stuck piled.
Publits is all out of them.
Go to Publits.
Go to Albertson.
See if you can find large kosher-dill pickles.
Yeah, I found some large dill pickles at Windixi.
I don't want to touch that.
Okay, please.
I have a question for you, though.
This is the serious question.
Okay, let's clean it up here a little bit.
Yes.
They may be on the listen line in Portland.
You know, they give you very uptight.
I was talking to Stan a few weeks ago, and it went pretty well.
But at the end, I mentioned the radio stage, which I'm not going to do.
Another radio station in Chicago.
And I wanted to tell a joke, which I have heard off of there.
And I guess I...
Which one?
WLS?
No.
I don't know.
You probably cut me off.
No, I won't.
Why would I cut you off, Virginia, in Chicago?
Okay, well, you all do it, and you'll cut me off.
The loop.
So what's wrong with the loop?
How do you think?
I was going to mention the joke I heard.
I'm actually kind of operating on it.
I can't do it.
Go ahead.
Well, it's a bad weather joke.
It's terrible.
You know, it's a thing...
Well, what do you do when it's running cats and dogs?
You know, don't step on a poodle.
But I mean, it would like the ultimate bad joke at the end of a pretty...
I'm telling you, that Chicago radio man is so good.
And it puts that dams thinking how it's stirring the shing.
You know what I'm saying?
Well, I'm an airline pilot, so when I'm up there, I listen to it.
Yeah, the figures.
You know what we're having all these problems.
You know what I'm saying?
You'll land it.
You'll land it the right runway.
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
It's scary, actually.
Yeah.
But...
Like that flight, I took the Pittsburgh.
When you landed it all here, I got a little nervous, you know what I mean?
I tried new in there.
You were on there, you know?
Yeah.
Oh, but really, I don't work for that airline.
What do you think about that?
That just went on down here with the...
At gate C8 down there, it's my Amir port.
Where's that?
I don't get involved in all these controversially.
We keep the show very laid back.
I have no opinions about anything, sir.
That's cool.
I've got a 180 degree turn.
I used to be an opinionated son of a bitch.
And now I just have no opinions about anything.
I respect that.
I respect that.
But listen to it.
I don't read the newspaper.
I don't watch the news.
I want to be left alone, you know what I mean?
I had to warn you now.
I just...
I had to warn you.
I know, Marcy.
Isn't this beautiful.
You look like a normal person.
She looks normal.
She's good looking.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, sir.
Let me give you a little music here.
We have our management team in here.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
Where's this from?
The beautiful birthday cake.
Publix.
Mimey likes from Puebix, huh?
Thank you so much.
You touched my heart.
And other body parts.
What is it?
Is it going to fall?
No.
No, I hate listen.
It's under control.
Trust me.
Thank you very much.
On my one-year anniversary, it says don't buy a house.
A little print.
I don't even...
Isn't that beautiful?
I like it, yeah.
You didn't realize when you came here today.
What a special day for me.
I guess.
For me, just don't leave day.
But...
I got a great idea.
Okay, let's take a vote in the building.
You know how they pass out secret ballots.
And nobody...
They're not marked.
Nobody will know who's...
You know, like the ex.
We'll take a little poll.
And we'll see.
Maybe we can get you a new job.
Be great.
Okay, I mean, you know, one that really pays.
And we can have the bird.
Can you just see him at the melting pot.
Waiting tables.
He's kind of flitting from one table to another.
And you can be here every day.
Sounds good.
Does that sound good?
Sounds good.
All right, so we have the secret ballots now.
Let's put Gina in charge of the secret ballots.
You know, like take a bunch of slips of paper.
Can you do that?
And sometimes the next ten minutes.
So I'm serious about this.
And all they got to do, just on each sheet of paper,
like make Dave or the bird.
And like a check place to check.
Seriously, she's laughing.
This is a very serious moment on this program.
It's our one-year anniversary.
This could be the turning point.
And could it do for a change?
Yeah.
Or do perhaps for a little change.
Maybe shake him out of his bad mood in there in the other room.
He seems to be just absolutely...
A little too much of that too heavy on the heart's mountain this morning.
I think, man, he went nuts on that one brand of bird seed.
He was going crazy.
He's pounding.
Well, let's give reason to do it.
You know, I don't know that he's got any reason to do it yet.
But let's get about 50 little slips of paper in hand,
or maybe a hundred.
I don't know. We've got so many people at work here
or go out into parking lot. There might be a few.
And then you can round them all up.
They can all be anonymous, and we'll tally them up.
Obviously, Dave or the bird.
Obviously, it doesn't want to be here.
Absolutely.
He's ready to quit.
So we have nine pies and one great big cake.
Boy, I told you, no more food on this show, didn't I tell you that?
Okay, are you going to, we'll have to cut that cake.
How are we going to do that?
Rich will supervise that.
Okay, yeah, I knew you would.
Okay, let's take another call from Dave County
while we're cutting up the big cake and having our major celebration.
Hello.
Yeah, see?
Yeah.
They love me.
Okay, wouldn't hang on.
Let's try another one.
Dave County, hello.
Yes, this is how you're doing.
Is this Neil?
Yeah.
Yeah, Neil, I want to ask you a question.
I need to find out if you have an extra tape of a...
You know that monsemand that you have?
Oh, yeah. Do I have an extra tape of it?
Yes.
No, but I could put it on tape for you if you send me a cassette.
Okay, what's the address then?
W-I-N-Z.
Uh-huh.
My...my Emmy.
33055.
5555.
Very good, Dave.
He's already practicing.
He's becoming, you know, like a part of the act.
That's right.
Okay, so anyway, okay, I appreciate.
Is that it?
That's it.
Good luck to you, sir.
Okay, thank you.
You bet. Hey, listen, anything for this audience?
They're great. They're wonderful.
They turned out in enormous numbers last night through rain and sleet and snow
and nothing stops them.
Hello.
Bobo?
Bobo?
Bobo?
Uh-huh.
Think of me.
Oh, that's Stan.
I'm Tony.
You got a sense of humor or what?
Dave County.
Hello.
Dale?
Yeah.
Hi. How are you today?
Great.
Welcome to W-I-N-Z, sir.
Yes, I came up last night to see you at the ice cream store and it was a pleasure seeing you
and there were a lot of very nice people there.
It was a madhouse.
Right.
I wondered if I could just have a chance to give you a few of my observations from up there
at the ice cream store.
Sure.
First of all, you were a much better looking guy than I had expected.
Really?
That about you, so.
Is that true, Dave, or what?
Yes, it is.
Yeah, he's saying that because he's eating all the food, you know?
And I pictured you as being kind of overweight.
You didn't?
I didn't look particularly heavy.
You were sitting down so I couldn't really see you.
Well, I was inhaling the whole time, you know.
Well, you've lost some weight, haven't you?
No.
So I heard.
And the bird, he was at a total disappointment.
Really?
Yeah.
Right.
Let's attack him now, you know, unmercifully.
Let's really let him have it.
His behavior today is so bizarre as to be indescribable.
Bird was a very apropos title for him to be called.
I don't know what his story is today.
What is problem?
He just came in here and he started.
In fact, he got Paul to hang up, who was here yesterday.
He was badmouthing him.
Got him just all bent out of shape.
And then he started attacking Dave from the moment he came in here
and just got up and left in a snit.
Well, he really had no personality.
He was very quiet, very subdued.
I think he was a little taken aback because you and Stan were getting all the attention.
Well, we weren't anywhere near him.
I don't know how you could say that because we were like in three different groups.
He was inside the store and he was, you know,
autographing all of my pictures, which was kind of bizarre.
And seriously, and then Stan was in one area with all of his being.
I was way in the back, luckily, because I had to find somewhere to sit down,
because otherwise everybody was hovering.
And we were like in three different groups.
It was hard to see you because you were totally surrounded.
And it was sort of hard to see Stan because there were a lot of people around him.
But Glenn was just sitting out there and nobody was watching Stan.
And you could tell why after speaking with him.
I always thought he was such a mild mannered, easygoing, you know, reasonable bird, you know.
Well, he was sort of a nerd as well as it was.
Well, it rhymes.
And as concerned.
Huh?
He was very nice, very present, but I'm going to tell you,
he does have a problem with women because the guy who's looking for women as much as he says he is,
there was a young lady there who came up to Stan to get his autograph.
And she was absolutely magnificent in every way.
Yes.
It really seemed to acknowledge her.
I don't know if he was in a day or he just wasn't.
Well, he was probably doing his Brian fixation routine, you know.
At the clock, I say you and I hope you do it again soon.
Thank you.
Okay, welcome to Rip the Bird on W-I-N-Z.
It's a new feature we're going to be doing daily from 10 to 2.
And don't stop now.
I mean, you're just in the middle of an eating frenzy. It's great.
Are you enjoying it?
I've had two pies already.
But you've had two pies?
Yes.
Are you enjoying it, though, Dave?
It is unbelievable.
Really?
Yes.
It's a good time for the great taste.
Okay, we'll take a break on that note and get a little pepto bismol, little digeol.
And we'll see if we can't get you ready for the second course.
Okay.
Who still is not back in here?
Want to keep it up, Dave?
So the audience is probably hanging on the edge of their seats, wondering if he's going to come back in here.
I would, I need him, right?
Do you think there's any chance?
No chance.
He's went praying back there.
Okay, let's go to Broward.
Hello.
Broward.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir. Buenas deeus.
Happy anniversary, Neil.
Thank you so much.
Are you talking to me?
I sure am.
You're right about one thing, man.
You know what's it? A bird looks just like a Tweety, man.
You hit that nail right on the head.
Were you there last night?
Yes, I was last night.
Okay, well, I wouldn't lie to you.
It was very nice.
It was a nice turnout.
It was nice people.
Yeah, it was such a fun experience.
And then of course you'd come back in here today and its life is usual, you know?
What is his problem?
Like, we, the listener's demand and explanation.
Why is he on strike?
Well, he's on strike because he's pouting because he's been upstaged the last two days.
Now, how can he be upstaged yesterday?
I don't know, because Paul was a very nice guy.
But he didn't, he didn't, wasn't overbearing.
Didn't have an awful lot to say.
Dave, of course, is overwhelmed him because Dave is like a living and breathing human who has a lot, you know, not a lot to say, but is, uh...
What I don't understand is, when he came in this morning, the first thing he said to you is,
aren't you going to apologize to yesterday's show?
Yeah, that, that was very strange to me.
I don't understand what I meant.
I don't have any idea.
And then of course Paul did call it and he blew him away in no time.
And I said here with the phone dangling and I don't know what, you've got to understand the big problem that happened.
So when I went on vacation, since that moment, the bird has become like bigger than life, if you pardon that expression, or it's a movie's called it.
But he's become just overwhelmed with his popularity now.
And I guess he's probably going to start his own station and...
I think he could handle it.
In fact, we saw him yesterday afternoon when he was preparing to go to the ice cream store, he was out of the back building a huge nest back there, right under tower number two.
So I think he's probably going to start his own station back there.
That's what he's doing today, Bill, in a nest on tower three.
Yeah.
A couple of quick questions for you, Neil.
The Tower of Power.
I watched Larry King last night.
Well listen, life is not perfect, sir.
And he says that 143 high, what is that supposed to mean?
Well, you know, there are no football games he wants to make America feel like they still have a little touch, you know, with the NFL.
No, that's his big signal to Angie.
Is that what that is?
143, which is the most detachiest thing in the world.
Well, first of all, the idea that Angie would do anything with any part of Larry King's body is so disgusting to begin with.
No one would like to imagine.
I mean, Larry King could be the ugliest person in the history of the human race, okay?
And Angie, even at her age, is still pretty well built.
Very well, Bill.
Yeah, you can say that again.
And if I took it about Bill, I was the guy who was standing there last night when you were signing that woman's t-shirt.
Oh yeah, writing on her boob, yeah.
It's quite interesting.
Yeah.
The other question I wanted to ask you, that's...
That's all I get, see, the story of my life.
Nobody came along and said, you know, can you sign anywhere else?
He had exactly what you said last night.
Yeah.
I was like, I was standing above you.
When you first sat down, I said, okay, Angie, I can start the math.
Oh yeah, I'd be honest with you.
I was in a fog.
I feel...
They were crowding around you, but I tell you, Neil...
And then when that woman kept pressing her crotch against my knee, that's the heavy woman.
No, no, there was a heavy...
And I thought, oh my God, what is your name so I can write this in please?
I mean, this is not what I had in mind, you know.
Yeah, really.
You're the question I wanted to ask you.
Is that really Frankie Valley on that Joey Pinto song?
Turn it up, America.
Turn it up into front office.
Give Gary a hernia.
Yes, it is.
Let me tell you a little story about all those things.
You know, Joey, I'm sure he's still playing a lot of that crap.
Years ago, like way back before they invented the wheel, they used to have a service for this jockeys,
where groups would record customized show opens, you know, like the charelles and...
Like that one, right?
...the four seasons and Frankie Valley.
And all of the stuff that they had, or at least most of the stuff that they had at WKVW and Buffalo,
was stuff like this that was custom made for the station.
And for their jockeys.
Right.
And that's what that was.
So that comes out of it.
It's not like Frankie Valley came in and said, oh, my good friend, like, you know,
that thing he plays by Wolfman Jack.
I mean, let's get serious.
Set up, man.
It's like it's a promo type of deal.
It's not really anything legitimate.
Like Frankie Valley really wasn't his friend, like he said.
Well, maybe he was his friend, I don't know.
But it was just in conjunction with the station, baby.
What they say, birds of a feather swing together.
And that bird really does look like a bird.
Oh, well, we're not missing him.
You're a friend there, Paul.
Dave.
Dave.
Dave, is Dave entertaining you today?
He's doing a good job.
Yeah, he's fine.
He's eating up a storm.
He's smiling.
He's pleasant.
He's not making any cost of comments about our other guests.
Taking a straight joke is the curb joke.
Yeah.
And they're not so straight jokes.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Take it easy.
Bye-bye.
We're getting rave reviews already.
Great.
Okay, let's take a call from Dave County again,
because I know that somebody in Dave loves it.
Oh, you got the score sheet?
Oh, in other words, you just had a, okay, Gina has gone around the building.
Right.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an incredible moment.
Do we have a drum roll?
No, we got something better than that, because we had that young lady who called the Canadian.
Yeah.
Okay.
We can ever get Joey Reynolds to stop playing on the car machine.
We may have a new national bird of Canada in just a moment, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you so much.
This staff, we may have to call in some outside help.
You know what I mean?
Like my friend, my pie's on over on the beach.
And I have to get him some new help in here.
Popular opinion, there are 16 nerds, okay, in the building.
50, let's see, 510-13 want the bird.
Nobody wants Dave.
What?
Well, I didn't vote.
Two are undecided.
J. Michaels voted for himself.
There's a little asterisk here.
It says this survey is based on the 16 people who are in the building right now.
Jean Cashman, who of course is a great programming expert beyond a shadow of a doll,
one of our brilliant programming experts.
Her expertise probably is unlimited in broadcasting.
Thought that Dave wasn't exciting enough needs to talk more.
Talk to me more, I'll talk.
Let's go.
Let me see that.
There you go.
Can you believe that?
It's a shut out.
However, we did put in a call to another brilliant programming expert Rick Sklar
in New York to put in a long distance call.
And he voted for Dave.
We put in a call to Bill Tanner.
He also voted for Dave.
I'm speechless.
Wait a minute, but you're not hearing the rest of these things.
Bill Tanner voted for you.
Bill Tanner, how do you know?
Rick Sklar voted for you.
How do you know?
Sonny Fox voted for you.
You know who else voted for you?
It's a good time.
There you go.
Donald voted for you.
So you see the votes are coming in from the real broadcasting people.
Well, I think we need the audience's opinion, not the agency.
Exactly.
Good thinking.
Boy, what a great way to kill the last half hour.
Exactly.
This guy, listen, I'm telling you, you could be dangerous.
You might be sitting in this chair any minute now.
I'll still be sitting here too, but that's another story.
Okay, let's go on what we're going to do in this last half hour.
And if you're calling for other reasons, don't run away.
But we would just ask in passing, right?
Right.
In passing.
What a little poll.
What you, what say you?
You say what?
Dave County.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hi, Neil.
How are you doing?
Two things.
Number one is, did you know that birds eat two and a half times
their own body weight?
Yeah, I've seen it.
I've watched it with my own eyes day after day.
Okay, and the other things I heard the caller before about the gay bowling league.
Yeah.
I was on the gay bowling league.
Really?
At one time.
And it pulled me.
It was us.
And there was also the group of Baptist.
Baptist?
Yes.
No, Baptist.
Okay, I'm sorry.
That took over the soul.
Wait a minute.
What is it that you're looking for, Gene?
That took over the soul bowling.
Is there any pizza left?
And there's a pizza right there.
Or no, it's an antiposta.
Like that.
And I ran into my sister.
Hey, listen, don't be choosy, Gene.
It's the price is right.
Go ahead, sir.
I'm sorry.
I ran into my little sister.
Really?
At the bowling alley.
Yeah.
I'm hanging out there.
Dave says he would like to run into your little sister.
But, uh, oh, she said, what are you doing here?
I said I'm bowling on a league.
She said, oh, no, Ray.
Please don't.
Tell me.
You become adaptive.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Oh, that's a gay bowling.
That's pretty good.
Wait, you have a good day.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Do you want to cast your vote?
No.
I like this.
Thank you.
Okay, I'll vote for Dave.
I get to vote for me, right?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, I have a good one.
Okay, wait a minute.
We have a special call coming in, ladies and gentlemen.
We have a special call.
Are you going to put it on now?
Okay, here's our mystery caller.
Hello, yes, just wanted to let you know that you know I'm here if
Yes, but I'm kind of busy signing autographs right now
For the rest of the staff no doubt
How about both come out in the building well, we don't want to talk about it
We've discovered that we need to survey the outside of the building
What's your vote sir?
How you say what sir?
Just let you know that you know if if if I you know sort of a contingency plan for you, you know that's all
Okay, sir. Bye. Thank you

And they said if I get a chance to get it on the line today if I could ask you all to play it works
Paper forms. They'd really appreciate it. Well, we certainly would consider doing that
But of course we do have a vote that we need from you. Hey, definitely come to husband's name and Dave and it's a great name
It's a great time for the great name
All right now you got your recorder rolling now because I don't want to have you call me tomorrow

Well, why don't you do that?
How about the record?
Very good good thinking. Okay, I love these people who are very technically minded
You must have got a school with Rick Edwards no doubt our corporate chief engineer

Bump
Well I was driving down
995 the other night
This guy and one of the important cars just about Indian clean off the road
Well stories won't go to me no good getting that am so I just kinda sit down wrote this song about an assistant
it goes like this
Where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.
You're a VUTG H A D and don't try to blame it on me.
You deserve all the credit because you're a butt head tonight.
You were a butt head yesterday and you're a butt head tonight.
I've got a feeling you'll be a butt head to risk to your life.
Let's take it, here we go, where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.
Oh!
I was talking to your mother just the other night and I told her that I bought the two of a butt head.
She said, yes, I think you're right.
And all your friends are butt heads because you've known them your whole life.
And somebody told me you got a butt head for a while.
There we go, where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.
Everybody join in where you born but hit or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way, worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.
Let's do that last line.
Either way, it worked out fine because you're a butt head tonight.
Oh yeah.
Okay, 19 before 2 at W Y and Z. Cake is good by the way.
Yes, very good.
Excellent.
I like the management and all of the other fakers in the building.
And very good. It is from Pueblox, huh?
Yes.
Just imagine if it would have been from Windixie.
I guess maybe after two years.
Okay, let's take our next break and we'll be right back.
Okay, well listen, if I have to find something in Iraq, you're going to have to fill the time.
You understand that?
Okay.
Kyle, let's take a call.
Well, see, I have to go ahead.
You take the call and I'll look.
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
Okay.
Take a phone call.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes.
I just throw my voting for Glenn.
He's the only one who has his own.
His own what?
What's the theme?
Are you for this one?
I went to everybody's head.
I bought the bed.
The bed, bed, bed.
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.
The best of when, a bed, bed, bed.
What do you think of that one?
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, somebody at the mega band is a 60s.
The trash man.
Am I right?
Yes, you are.
Yeah.
Well, you know, they had so many hits.
I heard that song and I just automatically thought it glimmed.
I heard that on a show in town the other morning.
I want to say which one.
Well, we have that tape too, only.
No, we don't have that one.
We have Larry Bird in here somewhere else.
Oh, just looking for it.
But yeah, I got that in the other room, but I wouldn't waste the card.
Very keen program for it to play that, I guess, huh?
Yeah.
So I, you last night, had a good time.
I enjoyed the picture of the girl with the t-shirt you were signing there.
Really?
That was fun.
Yeah, she had everybody writing all over her chest.
It was pretty exciting for some.
And it weren't more people signing, and they could have gotten more interesting places.
It was not too stimulating for me, but, you know,
it was a good time, though.
Yeah, it was. It was great.
I had a ball.
Look forward to seeing you soon.
Okay.
I'll read you the arch.
Bye-bye. Okay. One vote for the bird.
A little sympathy vote.
Uh, Dave County. Hello.
Hi, Adele. How are you doing today?
Okay.
Still taking your poll here?
We certainly are. It's life and death.
Life and death. Well, my position on this is if you're happy, I'm happy.
Well, a vote is for Dave, then, I guess.
Is that not a committal enough?
Hey, listen, I want to tell you something.
I mean, you know, just come in every day and have somebody sitting here who was smiling
and in a good mood and also, um, on a scale of one is about an 800.
You know, I mean, that's not bad.
It just doesn't hurt to look, you know.
I heard you mentioned Fredonia earlier.
I went to school there.
Fredonia?
I sure did. It wasn't the duck soup for Donia, either.
Wow. While there's a big hit movie in Buffalo, and I'll call Francis Does Fredonia,
which is coming out next Monday. It's going to be fantastic.
Pretty wild. Pretty wild.
I got a couple of questions here for you.
Yes.
What's the deal with Kyle? Is he leaving you?
He's just moving in the mornings.
Is that so on my right?
Or did we have another change yet?
Are you still moving in the morning?
Okay, next week.
Next week.
Is that going to Toledo?
No, he's not going to Toledo.
He may have relatives working in Toledo, but that's another story.
Did you have a meeting with the higher ups as far as your Saturday thing?
Well, we have some interesting things.
Let's just put it this way.
We have some interesting things that may be developing.
One can get.
No.
I'm not going to, but one can't get.
Really? Well, good luck to you, sir.
Also, I'm the fellow that arranged for you to get those Mojo Nixon records.
Great. Where am I CDs, buddy?
I was going to ask you if they showed up because I checked with the record company.
They said they indeed sent you some.
Well, we didn't get them.
First, we have somebody who intercepts a lot of the mail, and I want to mention a names.
Okay.
We're influenced to pull, but...
Okay. If you're interested, I'm going to give a call.
I know the folks over at Rhino Records that you're interested in,
Mike, getting you some kosher club and Yiddish people, things to give away.
Oh, I would love to have those.
I mean, those would go like potato pancakes.
And I know those guys over there, so I'll see what I can do for you.
And also, Mojo Nixon is going to be doing a bit of a public relations type tour.
And if you're interested or if Stan is interested, I think we can arrange to have him on the show.
I think he's going to be a town October 8th.
Great. The Wednesday, coincidentally, it's the first day of soccer.
Well, if Stan ever comes in here, we can find out what the story is.
Would you be interested?
He may also be, boy, no, we don't have too many gatherings.
Limited number of guests on this show.
Like today, yesterday.
Like today.
Yeah, okay.
All right. Well, maybe I'll ask Stan Lee T. If he's interested in that.
Okay.
All right. I'll see what I can do for you on the other stuff.
And one other thing I've met Don Agony a bunch of times when he used to be a taxi.
Yes.
Is a waste of proto-plasma.
He is a great argument for birth control.
I think sterilization is the word you were looking for.
Well, you know, if you can work out a retroactive abortion, he's a good candidate for it.
Okay. See you by.
Adios.
Okay. The poll is just devastating so far in one direction.
Date County. Hello.
What's wrong? I voted bad.
What's wrong?
Okay. Well, you hear the nature of his callers don't you the people who want him?
Oh, boy.
Exactly.
Some foul callers on this show today.
Let's take another one from Broward. Hello.
Yes, sir.
Let me show my razor down here, okay?
Please, please.
Try to control yourself.
Okay. I'm back.
Great.
You're still taking this poll?
We're doing whatever the hell you want, sir.
It's a great day.
Well, Dave sounds like a super guy.
He sounds nice.
But I mean, you know, we out here listening audience cannot see what he looks like.
And listening to him is about as exciting as watching concrete hard.
Well, I got news for you.
There may be something else that would harden if, you know, but that's another story.
But we can't we can't see him.
I mean, trust me.
He sounds like a nice guy.
He is. He's a great guy.
Well, I mean, I want to know when you leave here, he will never be seen again.
I'm taking the moment.
What the bird do that I do better than me?
Well, the bird, you don't, you don't like jump in enough.
You just kind of sit there and wait for Neil to kick you in the butt and then you say something.
I haven't kicked him in the butt once yet, sir.
Well, you'd like to.
Well, I don't care. I have to hold up and start.
But I mean, you just sit. I mean, it's your big day.
I'm not into discipline, okay?
Okay. Well, I'm trying to say it.
I think I'm doing a fine job.
Yeah, that's it.
And if you think you can do a better job here.
Well, you just, I mean, it's your big day.
You gotta just jump in there and take charge.
I mean, he'll be a lot better tomorrow.
Okay. I mean, you know, you come back tomorrow?
Yep. I guess it's, I mean, just stay on.
We should all.
But just as kind of a, how do I describe it gently?
In other words, like a little message.
You know what I'm saying?
That's me.
Yeah. What do you say?
Well, when somebody gets a little bit per snippety,
and that's a nice word because it's like kind of neuter,
like the bird.
When somebody gets a little bit too big for their bridges,
then you have to kind of intimidate them a little bit, right?
Yeah.
Now, don't you think that if Dave shows up again tomorrow?
And of course tomorrow he'll be a little looser.
To probably have a lot more to say that that would be,
represent a threat.
I guess basically you're doing a good job.
Yeah, see?
You can't.
It's his first day.
I mean, you've got to remember, he just walked in here
out of the cold and he's at least sounded looser.
He hasn't had a lot to say yet because he's just getting the
feel of things, so to speak.
Well, this isn't the best phone call I've heard either.
Yeah.
I mean, what do you want me to do?
When we talk about gay people, what?
You're not taking a poll.
Yeah, do it. You do best.
Okay. All right.
Well, he already voted for the bird.
So, you know, okay, where are we going to go next?
Probably the date county because that's where they really know
what's happening. Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Deal.
Yes.
It's here in my anniversary and, uh, in Dave's, too.
And I was wondering, uh, you know, the phone number?
It's your anniversary and Dave's?
I mean, well, I hope you guys have a wonderful life period.
I don't know.
We would have had a little cake, a little, uh, something special for Dave.
Yeah. What I meant was all three of us is the thiriniversary.
You, Dave and I.
What does that mean?
Okay.
It's our one day anniversary together.
You've been on the air for a year.
Dave's one.
Well, I haven't been on the air for a year.
I've been on the air for a lifetime.
But I mean, one year in this day, uh, and, uh, it's been Dave's, uh, one year working at
the melting pot.
Yeah.
And, uh, it's been Dave's, uh, one year working at the melting pot.
And, uh, it's my girlfriend's in my anniversary.
Wow. All right.
Congratulations.
Great.
A little, uh, come on.
I'd like to join you, but I don't know.
I'm going to put the phone number to the melting pot.
You'd like to what?
We can't find the phone number to the melting pot.
You know how to dial 411?
Cool spring.
Give him the number.
Come on.
755.
5, 50, hostel.
6368.
Okay.
That's in cool springs.
What is it?
What's the number road?
What's the number?
Did you get the number?
You don't want the Miami one.
What's going to be at the cool springs one?
Okay.
But maybe he wants to take his girlfriend to the one down there.
I don't know the number of the Miami ones.
It's on the Sunset.
Yeah.
Sunset.
Where are you still lived?
Where the bird lives down there?
Yeah.
God forbid.
And Dave says it's great.
Yeah.
Did you cast a voter did I miss it?
He didn't cast a voter.
You didn't cast a voter yet.
No.
Hey.
But it's the phone number to the one in the Miami.
Well, we don't know, but are you going to cast a voter?
You're just going to keep like this is 20 questions.
Uh, I don't know.
Undecided.
Yeah.
Okay.
Good call.
Get lost.
Okay.
Can't these people dial information is a vent difficult?
I don't know.
Like we have all the numbers in our fingertips.
Boy, you look really wide awake and bushy tailed.
Wouldn't you just crawl out of the sack?
I'm still ripped from last night.
It was quite an experience.
It wasn't.
It was gut wrenching.
We have decided.
Now, I don't know how long you've been listening.
Because you looked like you slept in late, which I also did, by the way,
to get up to like 830 this morning.
Really?
Yeah.
But now our guest celebrity here today has worked out very well.
Got cheese fondue out there, by the way.
Uh, no.
No.
You'll have some Friday down.
Okay.
Good.
You will?
You will.
Well, he's going to be there too.
Don't start looking down at him or you're being big trouble.
I'll mount it right up for you.
He gets what you will.
Yeah.
Chocolate fondue.
You mentioned something about that.
Yeah, he's going to lie down in the middle of the table.
Start naked.
And they're going to cover him with chocolate.
Isn't that what you said?
That's what you said.
That's what I said.
Yeah, well, somebody said that.
Have a brunette waitresses.
Well, did you hear Chrissy?
The fun fun.
Chrissy.
He's obsessed with Chrissy.
I mean, I'm obsessed, yeah.
But he's not obsessed with you.
No, I think you would like her.
She's going to be there Friday.
Yeah, she will.
He's not obsessed with you.
Did she have a boyfriend?
Yes, she does.
Oh, I see.
And he'd like to be all I got to you say they've got a boyfriend.
They've all got a boyfriend.
And last night, that's the perfect proof of that.
She has upset when she didn't get to see her last night.
Even Dave said he's got a boyfriend.
Just a joke.
It's just a joke.
Believe me.
This guy is just pouncing on all those young ladies out there
at the melting pot in his mind.
In his mind.
Okay, we got now listen.
We got a couple of minutes left.
And this is the pivotal moment.
And you missed it.
And did you see Mr. Bird anywhere in the building?
Or is he still pouting?
He's pouting.
Just talking to him.
Is he pouting?
Well, you know, we were talking about something else.
We were talking about last night.
He is a wreck.
Gizzy.
An absolute wreck.
He will got up and walked out of here like the most ejected foul
in the history of mankind.
I've never seen anything like after all that good food
people brought last night.
Yeah.
And you should have seen the amount of food that showed up here
from brick oven.
He is just, I can't believe that he would pass that up
so he must really be in a foul mood.
Okay, let's take these pivotal last calls.
Rowered.
Hello.
I'm going to hang up now.
What do you mean?
You're going to hang up now?
How does that supposed to mean to you?
You're going to hang up now?
Excellent call.
What a beanbrain.
Dead County.
Hello.
Yeah, I definitely vote for Dave.
I'd rather listen to Jeff Striker moan than listen to the bird.
Excellent.
Very good call.
Thank you.
Thank you.
As a matter of fact, we may make on Wednesday we may do that show
or next Wednesday, Jeff Striker moaning for four hours.
Broward.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Am I on the air?
No, you're not.
You know, these Dr. Ruth calls, we don't need those, okay?
Wait, did you mark the last one down?
Yeah, right.
Just relax.
I got everything under control, okay?
Dead County.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Oh, for Dave.
Really?
It's got to be tough walking in that studio on a one shot deal.
Yeah.
Here in talk.
I don't care what anybody thinks.
They just haven't had the experience.
Thank you very much, sir.
I appreciate that.
What I'd like to know, what my secretary wanted me to ask you was,
how do you get invited to do it as well?
You have to look like Dave.
Why?
Because I said so.
Well, power, right?
When do you want to take a look?
I don't.
But why not?
No, I can tell by your voice.
You don't look like Dave.
Okay.
You look more like Dave Giroway, maybe.
Yeah, see?
I really appreciate that.
Okay, that's all right.
No, well, it turns fantasy into reality.
Yeah, and look who they put his sidekick was at chimpanzees.
So what does that tell you?
Well, that's what they're doing,
medical experiments on now.
What can you do?
Yeah, too much monkey business.
Okay, listen, have a wonderful day.
You too.
Okay.
Okay, the last important cause, though,
all I think you may have,
I think you may be safe.
I think I got it.
Yeah, you think you've got it.
Don't pass it around.
Rowered county, hello.
Just wanted to tell you that you really drew him last night.
Yes, we did.
And I'm just wondering why all the girls were hanging around you
and all the men were hanging around Sam.
Well, we're switching off,
but you know, varieties of the spice alike.
And have you been to that new musical church in Halea?
Isn't it interesting that the neuters were all hanging around the bird?
I thought that was fascinating.
All the, go ahead, sir.
I'm sorry.
Have you been to that new musical church in Halea?
The church of San Theria?
El Mungo San Theria.
The old watermelon man.
The old watermelon.
I remember him well.
Did you cast a vote, sir?
I'll vote for everyone.
Okay.
That's how it's said from non-committal.
That's our favorite kind of call or real decisive.
Thank you.
I couldn't get near you last night.
Well, thank God for that.
Okay, sir.
And our last call is from Dade County.
This could be pivotal.
Hello.
Let's transplant the bird's brain into Dave's body.
Okay.
Okay.
We've already got one bird brain, isn't that enough?
Okay. Have a good one.
Thank you.
That's a vote for...
Well, he wants your body here.
Yeah.
And we'll do the lobotomy.
We'll do the whole thing.
So I guess Dave's coming back tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
Are you really?
Or are you just putting us on?
Yeah, I got an outfit out to do.
I would be crushed.
We got a picture of the people.
Do you understand it?
The B for this.
Yeah.
Okay.
He'll be here.
Trust me.
He just getting to love it.
And I'm beginning to love it too, as a matter of fact.
Okay.
Mike Wolf is here now.
He's got some headlines and then CBS minus the farmers insurance spot in position 1v.
And then we'll come back tomorrow morning at 10.
And listen, after a little experience, there's no telling what he might do tomorrow.
