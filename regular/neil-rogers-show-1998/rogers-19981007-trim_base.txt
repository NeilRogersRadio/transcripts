I know that.
Oi!
I picked up to you.
All right, well, I at least have a great day.
Let's take the cream to you.
Talk to the big.
OK, and have a great day.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 0.5, 60 on a mobile one line.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
This is your buddy from the hockey game.
Well, this is that asshole Mitch?
Oh, now I'm not interested in you, OK, asshole?
Here's the guy.
I wasn't even going to mention this because I don't want to dignify him.
I don't want to dignify him when he's coming.
And see, this is one of the reasons it's so hard for me to talk about hockey,
although I will for a couple of minutes and a bit here about this Peter Wurl business.
But this guy, we go there the very first night.
Here's the beautiful arena.
We go in there.
It's just spectacular.
Remember comes by and says, hello, I see some of my old friends.
But who's the first person that comes over?
Is this asshole who walks up to me?
Do you know who I am?
See, that's like that very jackass thing in Toronto with the airport up there.
As soon as somebody says, do you know who I am?
You know beyond a shadow of a doubt.
He's an asshole.
Right.
Because what does that mean?
Do you know who I am?
No, I don't know who you are.
It looked like just some ordinary puts me and it's this Mitch guy chronic.
He stands there for ten minutes.
Pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat.
Oh, you're I'm the reason you've got ratings.
But I said to him, how did I survive all those years before you showed up here?
He's the reason I've got ratings.
No, you're the reason I've got hemorrhoids. That's what you are.
I'm not interested.
OK, well, I'll talk to you.
You're a putz.
You're a jackass.
Nobody wants to talk to you.
You're worse than Andy from Hollywood.
You're worse than Greg from Pointe and Beach.
Now, Port St. Lucie, wherever the hell he might go.
That's right.
That's that's Mitch.
He is the ultimate.
He's the worst.
The guy with the eyes is a picnic.
He redeemed him.
No, seriously.
We can forgive the sinners.
He redeemed himself on Saturday.
He's a great guy.
He's a sensational guy compared to you, Mitch.
You're a misfit.
You're a putz.
You stood there for ten minutes and pat pat pat pat.
And you know something by the time the ten minutes was over.
You still didn't say a goddamn thing.
You're another guy with no life who wants to play off of using this radio show
to give yourself an identity.
You don't need this show because with or without this show, you're still a putz.
So you don't need me to have an identity.
You know nothing about what you're talking about.
You have nothing to contribute.
And I had even said to you, if you call the show and you want to talk about, you know,
like a like a bench and talk some hockey, that would be a breath of fresh air.
But he doesn't want to do that.
He wants to be a little celebrity.
Oh, you know who this is?
Yeah, real asshole.
Anybody going to talk hockey on his show?
I'm the one who'll talk it because I'm the only one in this town
and pretty much knows what's going on.
Outside of the people associated with the organization.
And some of them don't know what's going on.
Boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I'm telling you, I'm, you know something.
Them putting that show on last night at 1030.
The Monday show instead of the one from yesterday.
That's the greatest service that they've ever done to me over there.
That's the last time I'm actually meant by the way.
But that because it just started the wheel spinning in my hand.
I said to myself, what am I getting all bent out of shape about this for?
I don't give a crap about Maddie Leshum.
I don't give a crap about these people if they call or they don't.
You know, just like last night, you know, I come in this morning.
I said to George one hell of a crowned air last night at the Appetsal.
He says, oh yeah, and see he's thinking of the three or four misfits
that showed up there last night.
Three or four.
That's all there were.
Now I'm talking about real, I'm talking serious misfits.
Okay.
Serious.
Besides Jeff Cohen.
Serious misfits.
As a poet, but the overwhelming majority which there was a hell of a lot of living and breathing.
Young people there last night.
There was one guy from you of them.
You of them know this.
I couldn't believe it.
I didn't think we had anybody at the you of them listening to this show.
Because anybody who listened to this show knows what I think about the you of them after years and years of experience with that whole organization on it.
Barricade.
Ing blow.
Right.
But this guy was like a bright living and breathing guy.
I had young people coming over to me saying, hey listen, don't ever stop doing what you're doing.
It's great.
And don't ever let anybody muzzle you in.
Okay.
It was great.
So that's the way I looked at it.
Not that we had like three or four misfits there.
Or five or six or seven or eight.
Are you counting L for two?
Three I thought.
Boys, he getting big.
Al, we love you, but God, are you a giant in the porno industry?
Ten minutes after 11 at five, six.
You a.
Am.
Holy Makin'ah.
This is Joe Boyle on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the Hockey Authority, Neil God.
This is Hank Hill on music.
I just heard that song by Barricade Ladies called One Week.
First off, let me just say this.
Slow down.
I couldn't understand almost nothing.
I think you said something about Chinese chicken.
And then I heard the word sushi.
What the hell?
Now I know why you call it one week.
It took me that long to decipher the first line.
I'm Hank Hill on music.
Thank you.
I think week was the opportunity of wearing.
Okay, it's 11.16 at five.
60 WQAM on a really neat Wednesday.
Here's I start reorganizing and putting my life back together again.
Don't forget Sam, the promotion man, he'll be our QAM van.
Be looking for it.
At the Hooters at Pines and University.
He's got T-shirts.
He's got Neil Buttons.
George is better than Tape's Buttons and Rikia Glacier's Goodies posters, T-shirts, pictures.
And maybe some old stained underwear.
And who knows what else he's got hiding there in the truck.
Here's Port Lauderdale.
Hello.
Hi.
Yes, sir.
How are you doing, Neil?
Okay.
Maybe I'll give you some insight into the acons diet because I've been on it a couple of times in my life.
Give me some insight into what?
Yeah.
I lost 65 pounds and about three and a half months back when I was in my 30s.
Yes.
It's called a drinking man's diet, man.
And I've met far back in.
And I just recently did it again, lost 30 pounds.
And now what I do is I don't stay on the diet, but I really restrict my carbohydrates.
I've gotten back to eating some fruits that are low in sugar.
I eat a big, I scoop it out.
I don't eat pasta.
But you don't have to stay in that ketosis state and maintain your weight of that.
Of course not.
I'm maintaining it for about three years now.
Right.
So that this...
It's the SS, sir.
Those are the killers.
The SS, sugar and starch.
Those are the killers.
Yeah.
But you can still take a small amount of it.
If you still keep your carbohydrates, I try to keep it down under about 80 or 90 a day.
Yeah.
80 or 90.
I used that three or 400 before.
80 or 90.
That's after you lose the weight.
You're not going to lose any weight to an 80 or 90.
You're not going to lose the weight.
Right.
Yeah.
So that does allow me to...
I've a talking about your call.
I called about how we love the bagels.
I just scoop it out if I eat it.
Uh-huh.
And it's...
It's a...
It's a stop fruit juice in the morning and a stop high sugar fruits and all that kind of stuff.
And it's...
It's possible to enjoy everything that you want until maintaining your weight on the diet.
Okay.
Okay.
Say, how do I...
Okay.
Here's North Miami Beach.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I had a chance to meet the last five people off.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
I think it's a great thing you're doing with cancer once.
Yes, I am.
And I hope that I don't see again that one of your pipes.
Okay.
Five.
Thank you so much.
By the way, the center one number you can go or do your best to Neil Las Cedis and cassettes by calling them direct if you like.
954-5633-600.
954-5633-600.
I wouldn't give you the real good information about it in order on our website, NeilGod.com.
But unfortunately,
and maybe he might be listening to us today, or maybe we might send a search party out.
You know, I hate to knock him because he did such a great job for us putting that website on there.
I mean, he knows Stupendous Job for free, Julio Benito.
But he's found a life and he's doing other things and he's not doing his computer stuff anymore.
But we're supposed to be in touch with George's last couple of days since the first week of our campaign is basically coming to an end in a couple of days.
And I would love to have that on there on our website, but unfortunately you won't find it on there on our website because we can't find Julio.
Does anybody know where Julio is?
No.
I'm not talking about just any ordinary pedestrian Julio.
I'm talking about Julio Benito.
Anybody seen him?
No.
Anybody heard from him?
No.
Anybody can find him.
No.
Not a search party.
Come on, let's go.
Because that's really, can you imagine how much we could be raking in?
We got people listening all over the goddamn world on the audio net.
And people checking out the website.
We need to get that on there.
Like today would be good Julio.
I just mentioned that in passing.
We don't want to screw up your busy life that you got a real life.
Now that's great.
And our next appearance by the way will you on Saturday, October 31st, Halloween day.
At Ben and Jerry's in Aventura between 2 and 4 p.m.
Or are they going to be picking out at Ben and Jerry on that day for Halloween?
Mm-hmm.
They're going to be doing their New York Super Fudge chunk and their fish food
and their chocolate cherry garcia frozen yogurt.
And I'll be watching.
Here's a mobile in the gables.
Hello.
Yeah, what's up, Newell?
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
I was just, I heard of something that a Howard's parents getting in trouble or something.
And I was wondering if you could elaborate because I've been able to like watch the news for anything.
I don't know anything about it.
Now, I just cut like a glimpse of it last night on the news for whatever.
A glimpse of what?
What are they saying?
They said that he was setting up calls for something, fake calls,
and some of his radio stations might use it as an excuse to drop him.
Mm-hmm.
And I thought you would know about it.
I had no attention to Howard.
He gets a lot more, all the publicity he needs and then some without my help.
Oh, I know.
Okay.
No, no, hold on.
I have another thing.
I'm talking about your students.
I'm a your student also.
I'm a lost student there.
And I've been listening to you forever, though.
And one point.
That guy that just called about prune juice.
About prune juice?
Yeah.
That guy that was giving you his diet, how to, how to, how to, he said prune juice?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's just the perfect elaboration of Howard.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
We have two open lines in date one and brown.
56670560.
0560 on the mobile one line.
So the national hockey league is reviewing the racial incident.
Here's a big story by David J. Nealahal, people who tends to be a little dark and collected
himself.
And it's interesting because he doesn't put like a defensive spin on this.
This is a guy who wears his Afro-Conner Al uniform and his Hussade Shaco to all the
Panther games to cover them for the hero.
But evidently, isn't quite as militant and some as some I'd be because he kind of from
his perspective in here says this is much to do about nothing.
And maybe I'm reading into it, okay?
But at any rate, it says the NHL has interviewed all participants in Friday's alleged racial
incident involving Pantheos forward to the world and Tampa Bay, Darcy Tucker and St.
McArtheid, but doesn't expect to reach a decision today.
When I told them, they asked the world, what I told them is what I knew which is nothing
said, world, 21 year old black Canadian.
I didn't hear anything.
I didn't see anything.
I don't know exactly what happened.
Here in a way, he don't know.
He didn't hear nothing.
He's not the one that's all been out of shape about it.
And the Panthers didn't videotape the game, but Tampa Bay did.
The Panthers said they wanted to copy, to send a colon, Campbell, the NHL's disciplines
are to review the attack on Fordous Rob Needomire by Tampa's Andre Nazarov and Zara.
Tampa sent the tape all the resources to tape his foggy during the third period.
It's a little on the foggy side.
But it goes on to say from the press box at the top of the 8,000 seat Jacksonville Colosseum
and this is David Jane.
You'll write in this.
It appeared that after Nazarov jumped Needomire with a series of cross checks and punches
to the back of the head, a pile up and suit against the far boards in the Florida zone.
Meanwhile, at the bench, Whorell and McCarthy began drawing at each other, saying to
McCarthy, by the way, being the boon of Tampa Bay, to use the play for Calvary.
The arguing continued and they were given each 10 misconduct.
Tucker was already in the Tampa Bay box.
As Whorell and McCarthy continued their debate, Tucker put each of his hands under the same
armpit.
Like this, under the same side armpit, which I don't know if it's a side armpit.
Do you have armpits anywhere than on your side?
I don't think like this.
It goes on to say that gesture was read by Brian Murray to be a ton of Whorell as an
ape-like creature, but says David Jane, he'll from the press box.
It also resembles a child indicating a rival is chicken.
Isn't that what people usually do like that?
Like that.
That means chicken.
It doesn't mean ape-like.
Wait until you hear the rest of this.
I think maybe BM is lousian.
He's got a little bit carried away.
Which it says that's a trible indication that a rival is chicken, which is how the lightning
later said they felt about real-not fighting.
Tucker also stuck an index finger in his mouth repeatedly, which Murray thought was making
fun of Whorell as a banana eating ape.
Now keep in mind, this isn't the Tampa Bay guy saying this.
This is Brian Murray's interpretation of the events that took place on the ice-hop.
They're in Jacksonville.
He thought it was making fun of Whorell as a banana eating ape.
So they're doing like this, right?
Like chicken because you won't fight the big guy.
And like that, like meaning choke is what I would interpret it to be.
But Brian Murray, Shesh, it's making fun of him as a banana eating ape.
Lightning General Manager Phyllis Pizito, who's a real asshole by the way,
called the incident an attempt at game is mentioned by the Panthers.
This is typical Panthers bowl, he said.
They're trying to get us off our game because we're playing them in the opener
Friday night.
So it's Brian Murray who's saying all of these things.
That it's a racial incident.
I mean, that line, I can't believe that anybody would say that.
Tucker also stuck an index finger in his mouth repeatedly, which Murray thought was making fun
of Whorell as a banana eating ape.
If I went like, uh, what?
To you, would you think that I'm saying that you're a banana eating ape?
No.
Is that the message there?
No.
If you did it?
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Banana eater.
I'm the banana eater.
I'm sorry.
Everything else.
Okay.
Here's a mobile and coral spring.
Hello.
Morning, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
You know, if anybody knows about hockey, it's you.
You're the man.
I'm the maven.
You're the man.
I'm going to get off that subject.
You remember that, uh,
quickly.
Okay, it's the biggest deal with Bob Lincoln.
Bob Lincoln, yeah?
Yeah, you're a link.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't call him a banana eating ape just because he's the missing link.
Because he didn't pay for the gas.
We got stuck in the airport.
Oh, I remember.
I know the whole deal.
Are you playing in another deal with him or?
I'm not planning another one of those deals with him with anybody, uh,
anytime in my lifetime.
No chance.
Okay, I got another question for that.
Those two, those three trips we did to Vegas.
In fact, I should be put away for the fact that it was second one.
And then to do a third one with that rocky rent to Rio, whatever your name was.
I mean, I must have been out of my mind off my rocker.
But once we got off the plane, we had a hell of a deal.
Yeah, once we finally got there, it was sensational, right?
God, I remember that.
Uh, do you think that we have a chance to legalize gambling with anyone
in these candidates that's, uh, uh, for governors?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No chance.
No chance.
No, no, we gotta find somebody done.
Okay, good luck to pal.
I'll see you in Vegas.
That's, uh, going to find not going to happen, man.
This is like the guy to call me before about you.
I know it's depressing.
It's something you don't want to accept.
It is not going to happen.
Read my lip.
Okay, the ones who doesn't have a little cold, so run it.
Read my lip.
Oh, yeah, that's the cold floor.
We're not going to get no casino gambling in this state
because it's a backwater state that's run by a bunch of
Bible-fumping red necks and by a bunch of old parts
who don't want us to interrupt their, uh,
the stranglehold they have on his town.
That was one of the great parts of our appearance
at Pizza Loth last night.
The median age was, I would say, about like 25 or 30.
The people that showed up there.
Did we have hardly any old parts there last night?
No.
Unlike maybe a couple.
Living and breathing people under the age of 100.
Oh, I said, this is great.
These are the people I want to talk to.
Not the old people that got 40 pounds of cotton
betten between their cheek.
Rectome.
Whichever cheeks it might be.
Forget about that.
I wasted my time with that for five million years.
I knew I had blue lips.
Can that sit done?
Help me with my blue lips.
It's 11 to 1.
Like I said, don't take no lip from anybody.
That's my philosophy at the show.
Love a Q-A-L.
Kill the cold.
32 at 560.
W-Q-M got hanged from a shoelace to at.
Yeah, these people like that got your tell me,
but I got to get those people on the air.
The old crusty fart, the one that's getting the injunction
and the little judge with a mustache and a wrinkly hair.
Yeah, that's right.
To get me off the air, I love that.
I love those people just like that Christian lady
that called a few days ago.
Those are my favorite callers of all time.
Those are the best.
Because when you stop and you listen to those people,
you realize that they're certifiable
that they need to be in a rubber room someplace.
It's like the dog that sits out there
being at the moon, howling and screaming,
hoping that he can make the moon go away.
Instead of like just a dittle around,
sticking his tail up in the air and walking in the other direction
and going on with his life,
he sits there screaming at the old moon,
hoping it'll go away.
And I'm not going anywhere.
So find something else.
Find another occupation.
Go read the Bible.
Go hand out Bibles to dying people in hospitals.
Go out there and spread the word.
Go to the jungles of Africa,
the deepest darkest jungles of Bangladesh,
and hand the people out there the good book
to get them the words.
You can save them before it's too late.
Do something constructive.
Just like I told that them Christian bitch.
Who by the way, I think did try to take it up the record.
It's having a good time, which is why we didn't hear from her anymore.
And she made promo.
Oh, there you go.
You too can make promo if you're entertaining as she was.
That's right.
Woo!
Yeah, that was my favorite.
Oh, oh.
Yeah, in fact, that's what she said when she...
Recko.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh.
But you notice you said it with kind of like an enjoyable sound there.
Like, oh, it hurts so good, you know, that kind of thing.
So I think she's going to be doing a lot of that.
And if you keep doing that,
sweetheart, you'll be burned at Lake Afair.
Make no mistake about that.
See, it's very simple.
There's a phallon.
In fact, we're going to get the button guy came by,
by the way, our button guy, what's his name?
Jeff.
Jeff, I haven't seen you in so long.
He's a great guy.
Jeff, our button man, he made up some great buttons,
which have the picture of the front of the cover of our best off CDs,
with the little center one heart logo with the one inside.
We need him to make up some buttons that say,
DNH.
I'm starting a new religion.
We're going to make bumper stickers and buttons.
You know how they have the little fish?
Well, there are own.
It says DNH.
That's my religion.
Oh, seriously, you heard of DNH,
which of course is the fiber of which all life is made.
DNH means do no harm.
That's it.
Very simple.
That's all you need.
Doesn't cost you anybody to join.
You don't have to believe in any saviors,
any supernatural people,
any creatures, any little goblins from Mars.
Do no harm.
That's it.
Very simple.
Now, let's move on with life.
And stop arguing about a bunch of bullcrap.
See, you're not going to heaven.
You're not going to hell.
There's no such thing as life after death.
Take the flower.
Take that little seed and take that flower.
And you watch it germinate and you watch it grow.
It blooms and it blossoms and it grows into a beautiful thing.
And then it starts like a wilting a little bit.
And then it starts getting older and decaying and rotting.
And then it dies.
It dies.
It dies.
Die, die,ina, with dies.
And that's a microcosm of what the life of all living things on earth is.
Some things have long life spans.
Some things have short life spans.
That's it.
That's what it's all about.
Anybody tells you you're going to be up there
and heaven did them with the angels up there.
I got news for you.
Maybe Tim Salman and Jim,
what's his name?
Edmunds are going to be up there.
Those are the only angels you'll be running into.
And now JT's still he's playing for the giants now, okay?
No angels.
Nobody playing little harps and nobody's sitting there going,
oh god, you're good.
Oh god, for the rest of their eternity.
I mean, eternity's a long time.
They keep threatening you with this health thing where you're going to burn
in the lake of fire for eternity.
I mean, this alternative also on that good to me either.
Praise in God for all eternity.
Oh god, you're good.
You're good already.
You're good.
You believe me.
You're good.
You're good.
That's something I'll know.
You're good.
Forever.
Let's have lunch now.
You're good.
You're good.
Don't stop now.
Just keep going.
It's all about your crap.
Yeah.
So knowing, of course, that people have this tremendous fear of death,
we come up with all these bubble miceys, all these fairy tales.
And then we charge them a lot of money.
We make it into a big business.
And then we use it as a big, you know, as a way to justify bigotry
and pit one group against the other and kill a lot of people who refuse to come
into our, I believe, our bubble miceys.
And isn't it been going on like the guy who called before?
About an hour ago, like he said, since the beginning of recorded time,
since the inventor of the first goddamn stupid religion,
this is what's been going on.
You don't need this.
Do no harm.
You don't hurt anybody.
You don't take anybody's property.
You don't hurt anybody's person.
That's it.
That's all very simple.
Do we need anything else?
No.
I mean, if you can do some good things along the way, that's fine.
But that's your prerogative.
You just want to be a schmuck who just goes through life.
Fine.
Just don't do any harm.
That's the religion.
And if everybody in the world would abide by my religion,
which I just articulated to you for the 10 minutes of time,
we'd have no wars.
We'd have no persecution.
We'd have no hatred.
Everybody would just do their thing.
And look at all of the resources we would have.
I mean, we can't even get the tax money from these fakers.
Look at all the resources that are being wasted on this bullcrap
to subsidize fakers and snake oil salesmen.
That we could speed all the starving people in the world
and educate the people and do something about the plan,
parenthood, and have like, you know,
not five billion people crawling around on the face of the earth
and two and a half billion of them starving today.
What a concept, huh?
What a concept.
Oh my god.
Right, exactly.
Do no harm.
Sure thing.
But we ought to have cards and buttons
and bumper stickers made up with that.
Instead of these stupid little troglolites
with the fish on their car,
I'll give me a break with that crap already, will you?
Speaking of troglolites,
Jeff Cohen just came in.
Don't bring any of that in here
because I'm eating lunch at mommy's today.
Okay, usually it's Tuesday.
This week it's Wednesday because I was at the law last night.
So don't be bringing no food in here, Mr. Food Pusher.
Mr. Rapeni Pusher.
So how'd you wind up doing last night?
QA have.
I can have an orgasm just driving down I-95.
Oh!
Guys, where the heart on promenade dolls.
Girl's grab your partners firmly by the balls
drag them down the length of the halls.
Make them holler, make them shout.
What you pretty ass up against is now.
First lady goes, second lady pass, third lady finger up the fourth guys ass.
Finger out, promenade the halls, now released the poor guys ball.
Down with the petticoat up with the pants,
this is the end of the dirty square dance.
Those who do are wrecking, I'm tired now.
I think I'm looking for where I've made some french fried potatoes.
11, 4, 4, 5, 60 WQM just another spy report, the chronic, the old fart.
Called Georgia again out there.
Wish we could get him on a year.
We ought to break into a middle of a commercial break.
Yes, we can't hear out tomorrow.
Just read the Harold tomorrow.
They're going to report that he's dying of AIDS.
That's the news to us.
Because we know that I'm losing a lot of weight.
Okay, yeah, right.
Only wish I was losing a lot of weight.
Let's go to Boca.
Hello.
Hey Bo, hey, it's Mr. Boca.
Yes, sir.
How you doing, Neil?
Great.
Good news.
My brother is getting married and the whole wedding party is going to Vegas for the honeymoon.
Great.
Man, we're going to have a good time looking.
Yes, sir.
I've been there, but I can't wait to go back.
And we're just going to just live and breathe amongst some happening people.
I'm trying to have a good time.
People with big smiles on their push, having a great time.
That's right.
Walking around in the middle of the night, not worrying.
Right.
So I can't wait.
And I just wanted to say that no matter what they do to you down here,
as far as give you our time, you've got a tremendous amount of people
I'm out on the road all the time.
And you've got more listeners than you can imagine.
And I can shake my thing in.
And we all enjoy it.
And just wanted to give you my support.
And have a great time, pal.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, you see what got that old guy that old cod, you're fired up again.
You know what he's pissed off and fired up the timing of it.
After I went through my very common sense thing.
And this gets them psychotic.
You can't say that.
It makes too much sense.
That's what he's really saying.
You can't say those things because it's too simplistic.
And it messes up our plans.
Remember what Tessio said in Godfather 1?
That screws up all my plans.
Can't go selling.
And that's what this guy's all been out of shape about.
Because it's very simple.
You don't need all these fairy tales.
You don't need to charge somebody a bunch of money to rip you off.
So that you're going to wind up going to heaven or all this other bull crap.
And get saved from some evil destructive, hateful God
that wants you to burn in the sufferer, etc.
for the rest for eternity.
Which is one of the sickest concepts that anybody, any rational.
I mean rational.
Are we talking rational?
No.
Any person could come up with people in the people in the jungles.
Oh, we got to get them the word because if they don't get the word in time,
they're going to wind up in hell.
Well, did they have any choice?
No, but don't confuse us with the facts.
Do, no harm.
Period.
And leave people alone and stop being so hateful and obnoxious and judgmental and bigoted.
That's what we're asking.
Is it going to happen?
No.
Of course not.
Just like in Northern Ireland, every part of the world that you look at,
most of the strife, most of the conflict that's going on today
and through the ages and from now until the guy that planted is blown up
is because of bull crap.
Because people want to be sheep,
they want to be led down the garden path with a bunch of horse crap.
They want to walk around with those stupid beanies on their head
and they want to walk around and worship a guy with a dress on.
Because the number of people in this world, especially in this country,
you want to think for themselves, you can put on a thimble
and have room for that fat ass old fart that keeps calling you.
Have room for him left over in there, which would be a good place for him.
We could call him Thimbalina.
So just keep getting all bent out of shape and upset
because what, that's your revolutionary, do no harm.
Just leave people alone.
Just don't mess with their property.
Don't mess with their own person.
I mean, we'll draw the line at insects.
Self-defense and insects.
For wild animal comes in your home killer.
Okay, even Bob Barker, I think, might go along with that one.
Cockroaches and mosquitoes.
Well, oh, too bad, see you later.
Send them to skier heaven.
But other than that, any other higher life for them once we get about the insects,
have some respect for it.
Leave it alone.
Do no harm.
That's it.
I ought to be on Goddamn International TV on CNN right now.
It's the these stupid bitches on their talking economy,
which they know nothing about.
I ought to be on there right now.
Preaching a good word.
The simple word.
Ten minutes.
That's all they should give me.
Ten minutes on there.
And I'll tell them what real life is all about.
Do no fricking harm.
The NFH.
Can't put the F in there because then Matthew will get upset.
Oh, sorry.
Let's talk about him again.
The NH.
So basically, and I'd like one person, by the way, I challenge you.
And I know you won't be able to do it.
I've got challenge.
One person.
One of your witnesses out there.
They're calling me and tell me what.
That's wrong.
To tell me what's wrong with that is a philosophy for life.
For all living and breathing people all over this planet.
That we couldn't survive a hell of a lot better.
And make this a god damn instead of an outdoor ensana solemn.
Make it into a real paradise where people can actually be happy and be fed.
And live a land instead of the madness that goes on here.
People with a gun, the gun nuts and the shooting and the killing.
And the people who's making babies like rabbits and their kids are walking around.
Two-year-old kids wandering around in the middle of the street.
These are all the news stories we got.
Because mommy and daddy are busy doing a drug deal or whatever.
And how mommy and daddy are busy doing.
If there is a mommy and a daddy,
which in America now maybe there's a mommy, maybe there's a daddy.
Maybe there's not either one of them.
I mean, if Jody Foster's having a baby,
God only knows what's going to have next.
Maybe Steve Jones is going to have a baby.
Not his wife.
He's not just him.
Maybe Steve's going to have a baby.
Because that's what America's all about.
Madness.
I'm not the crazy one.
You people are to pull in this crap.
You're the crazy one.
You're out of your mind.
Believe me that this is the way that supposedly civilized people are supposed to live.
Kids being thrown into dumpsters, into pizza ovens.
Just like that bitch on that old bag of the condom.
Oh yeah!
When they tell her there's a body in the dumpster in the back of her building.
Oh yeah!
We're playing bridge.
We're playing my genre.
Oh yeah!
There's a dead body rotting in your dumpsterly.
Oh yeah!
But we're in the middle of a Maasjon game over here.
Wow!
Excuse us for interrupting your Maasjon.
We'll come back when you're done.
Okay.
Call us when you're done.
Give us the name of the winner.
We'll put it on a goddamn TV.
And then maybe you want to take a look at, you know, get your gas mask out
and take a look at his dead body back here and see what's going on.
Oh yeah!
Please talk about Sam and Chris before he calls me again.
I'm going to ask you to tell me what's going on.
Again, meaning what?
That they're dying over there.
Speaking of dying over here.
Over at the Hooters.
So what do you want from me?
Maybe nobody wants any of this stuff.
Maybe nobody's listening.
I don't know.
Sam and the gang were over there in the QAM van.
At Hooters on Pines and University Drive.
And they got the QAM T-shirts and Neil Buttons.
And George is better than Tape's Buttons.
And Enrique Goody's poster T-shirts and pictures.
Now maybe that they're there.
And people know that they're there.
Maybe now people make the effort to go over there
or if they're in the area, go buy and see them.
So Sam feels like he's doing something worthwhile today.
I mean, they got free stuff for you over there, okay?
So stop by and make Sam feel like we're doing something
useful and worthwhile.
And like we really have an audience out there,
even if we don't.
We don't know.
Do we have any idea if we still have an audit?
No.
Of course not.
We had a lot of people show up last night.
They all claim that they listen.
Do we know if they're listening?
No.
They just wanted to be nice.
Here's a lady in sunrise.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Good morning, Neil.
This is Jenny.
Yes, Jenny.
And we were at the center one benefit last night.
Great.
And I don't know if you remember me and Adam.
He had an elbow t-shirt on and anyway.
Yes.
I tell you, you don't have no idea how how touch you were
that you were doing this.
And it just, you know, really touched our heart.
But also, what I first want to say,
we want to become the first official members of your DNH.
Great.
Oh, yeah.
We're on there.
What you're in, that's how easy it was.
You're in.
What cost you a dime?
There's no dues.
You don't have to put a shmata on your head.
You don't have to do any mumbo jumbo.
You don't have to buy any books.
You're in.
Yeah, this is excellent.
Because you're very important to be on the radio.
Because a lot of people said, let me mentality, you know?
Yeah.
And people, they just need to know what you think they can think of.
All the killing, all the suffering, all the hate,
all the misery, based on people arguing about a bunch of fairy tales
and stuff that we'll never have the answers to.
Instead of saying, well, we're here.
We know that why can't we just do no harm?
Get along, be civilized.
And that's it, and then move on from there.
That's pretty simple.
You know, let's try to, let's try to feed the people
that are starving to death.
Let's try to, you know, discourage people
from making unwanted babies.
Let's start doing things that make some sense.
And are these people willing to do it?
No.
No, they're running around the worshiping a guy that wears a dress.
And you know, something's funny when we got home.
We got, I also got something in the mail.
And right on the envelope, it looks like handwritten,
but it's not.
It says, Jesus is going to be passing your home
close to where you will be sleeping tonight.
Yeah.
Ready.
So I opened it up, and it has all this funny stuff.
And of course, there's an area there to send.
Oh, it's called sewing on this one,
presenting money, sewing seeds.
Oh, yeah, you have to sew it.
Yeah.
Get the needles out.
Yeah, so it's quite entertaining.
I got a little purple and gold prayer thing here.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I've shot ten real fast if I were you.
I got it quite tickled, though.
I'll have to say.
But again, you know, it was, it was so good to see you.
And Center One, Adam had, as we told you,
a partner named Neil also, who, they helped him in their,
in their early days.
Carol was very instrumental in that too.
Great.
And it's just really, we met up with her on the way out.
And Adam spoke with her for a while.
Great. Okay.
Good hearing from you, Jenny.
I think we went out.
Well, keep listening.
Thanks a lot.
Keep thinking straight.
And bless you.
Okay.
Okay.
Bless you, my child.
Okay.
We got two members in.
Anybody else joining?
No.
Okay.
That's three of us.
Two open lines, and day one and Broward,
five, six, seven,
oh five, 60,
pound five, 60 on a mobile one line.
I'm waiting for the first.
Instead of all I hate to spew an end to Georgia's here,
let's hear some good Christian out there,
or some good Orthodox Jew,
or some Muslim,
or some Buddhist,
or some other religious nutcase,
calling here and tell me why I'm wrong.
What do we need all these organizations
and all these institutions
and this massive, massive waste of the human resources
to subsidize corrupt,
crooked, bullcrap?
What do we need that for?
Why do we need mumbo jumbo?
Why can't we just use a little bit of common sense?
Even the dumbest of the dumbest
a little teeny tiny common sense?
I got a little teeny tiny common sense.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello?
Hey Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'm about to start your time.
When you go, when you bake a baked potato and you cut.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
We have an open line and Broward.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the mobile one line.
When I'm talking about baked potatoes and the Edkins diet, okay?
I don't know who started this crap with the Edkins diet today, all right?
I'm the one who like reinvented the Edkins diet after he put the book back out.
I'm the one who made him a millionaire again.
The Edkins diet works.
It's great.
If you want to do it fine,
if you can stay on it, that's great.
It's a way of life.
It's not a diet.
If you can't do it like me, then you're fat.
That's it.
Nothing complicated.
We don't want to hear about it.
It's boring.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
Hey, I couldn't agree with you more about the Duno-Harm concept.
I want to take it literally to one point when you start talking about animals and all of that.
If you had, and don't hang up, I mean, please, if you had a cat that was yelling and yelling
and keeping you awake all of the time, then you had an opportunity to do away with the cat.
Would you?
Rain, for real or you want to make a joke?
No, I'm not making a joke.
I'm just saying.
Of course not.
Of course I wouldn't do that.
Well, what if it's disturbed your sleep and you never had enough to eat it?
I'm sure I got it out of there.
I'd get rid of it.
I'd make sure that wherever it was, I'd find it another home.
What if the only opportunity was?
Have a great day, pal.
What if?
What if?
What if?
What if chickens' peeds are okay with your driveway be wet?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, there you go.
What if?
What if?
What if?
You're just a moron.
You're just a bozo, pal.
Very simple, but you want to make it complicated, okay?
So forget about the animals.
Forget about them, all right?
Because why the hell?
Forget about the insects and the animals.
Let's try to stick with human beings right now, which quite frankly,
I'm not sure if you qualify.
Let's try to stick with human brains with a brain.
Human beings.
Remember Bobby Brie?
Good.
God Almighty.
I said if anybody wants to refute it and explain it rationally,
got something legitimate.
Not some jerkball out there with a goddamn dead cat, okay?
If you got a pussy problem, pal.
This is the wrong show for.
Call Dr. Laura.
We have an open-line in Broward.
56670560 and 0.560 on the mobile one line.
It's 1156 on the two.
We got the bookshambia at six and then we got the
battered gym.
They got anybody over there with Sam and Sam and the nephew.
They got anybody over at Hooters and not.
He hasn't called back.
Hasn't called back.
We got some people over there, okay?
Sam is over there.
He wants to give you some crap, okay?
Sam is the expert.
Hooters on pines and university drive.
They got a whole bunch of QAM stuff, such as it is.
I mean, we don't have a lot of good stuff.
We got QAM t-shirts.
We got Neal Buttons.
We got Georgia's Better Than Tapes Buttons.
In Rikki Iglesias poster t-shirts, pictures,
a bunch of stuff.
What does wrong with these people?
Oh, they don't want to see Sam?
Come on, get over there before they change their mind
and turn around and go back and Sam starts saying,
oh, there ain't nobody listening to that goddamn show.
Now you're probably right, Sam.
We have an open-line in day.
DNH, maybe anybody else out there want to join?
No.
You know harm.
That's our new religion.
We're starting right here.
Gonna put all these other bastards out of business
because it doesn't cost you a dime.
You don't have to really think a hell of a whole lot.
More than about two minutes about it.
Makes sense to me.
And this guy out there with his damn pussy problem out there
in his driveway or whatever.
Like I said, call Dr. Lura, call Irene Kassurla,
call up Monica, get out of my face.
Here everything's a big goddamn joke.
Here's South Beach.
Hello.
Hi, Neal.
Yes, sir.
Oh, God.
You're the best.
Yes, I am.
Um, take...
Oh, shh.
A couple things I want to talk about.
You're good.
Exactly.
I want to join, man.
It sounds great.
Oh, you remember number three?
All right.
There you go.
I think I don't know if you're qualified.
You remember number three?
Well, you're number one.
Yeah.
The two people were number...
And I'm doing number one and two right now.
Yeah.
I almost...
He's speaking at number one.
I almost did that when I heard the guy from the
Contrary Day Spot.
Do a spot.
Oh, man.
The one guy?
Contrary Day Spot.
Like he's tolerant as loud as possible.
You mean Joe Rose?
Joe, how is his spot?
Oh, man.
I was as George.
It's going to be good.
He's always saying, how come Joe Rose is
tolerant here in this spot?
When he does his live spot, see how he's...
And then when he does, he'll be courting his spot.
He's tolerant.
I like the wee wee.
Yeah, that's the problem, I think.
Too much wee wee would, Joe.
Maybe around too many deaf people or something like that.
That could be it.
Thanks, though.
You can kiss my rear end.
Not bad.
We'll pass.
Okay, pal.
Have a great day.
Go sober up.
We have an open line update, 567-0560,
pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
DNH.
The greatest threat to all these
faker religions out there.
All these phony balonies with their hate literature
and their bullcrap and their propaganda and their lies.
That's what they do.
Better than anybody.
Like that Ernest Ainsley.
And like that goddamn phony.
What else is named the Benihana Hin?
That's right.
Benihana Hin sounds fishy to me, Mr.
and he's on it.
And he even came on at CNN showing just about admitted that.
It's almost of it's a bunch of fakery,
which we know it's all a bunch of fakery.
All these things.
He doesn't even touch him.
And they're already passing out.
They're grabbing him.
They're falling on the floor.
And then they say,
I'll come back and do it again.
And people are sending this faker money.
This is terrifying.
This is unbelievable.
This is even worse than jury springer if that's possible.
That these people go on air.
They get all this taxes and status.
They put the little number at the bottom of the screen.
They raise all the money they want.
They become good obedient right wing Republicans.
And they propagonize all day long 24 hours today.
They twist and manipulate the news for fun and profit.
They brainwash the uneducated masses out there.
And they're making tax-free millions.
While people are running our starving,
that we got the fall is here already.
Before you know it's going to be quarter and hell up north
another month or so.
Another couple of days maybe.
People are going to be out there.
The homeless are going to be freezing to the starving to death.
And we got assholes in this country sending millions and millions
and millions of tax-free dollars to a bunch of quacks,
a bunch of fakers out there.
And you tell me that this country
has got some degree of maturity, of sanity.
We got this charade going on up there.
Here's Wolfgang Blitzer.
A bit of Blitzkrieg again on CNN.
Investigating the president.
And at Nazi Trent Lotz got the balls to come up there yesterday
and accuse Clinton and the Democrats.
Well, you know, this is all just a masquerade.
This is just all a side show to try to deflect
attention away from the investigation.
Like it was Clinton who invented all the problems in the world.
It was Clinton's fault that we got this global economic crisis
that they're toppling like a bunch of goddamn dominoes.
The economy's all over the world.
It's Clinton's fault that goddamn
Saddam is over there building goddamn nuclear weapons.
Not George Bush's fault who didn't finish the job
back during the Gulf War.
It's Clinton's fault that they're killing each other in the Middle East,
even though we got Madeline Albright over there again.
They're shaking hands and they're shaking it and rocking back and forth
like Leo Mazadega in the Abrayev's dugout.
That's right.
It's all a diversion.
He isn't amazing how much power this guy has got
that he invented all these crises just to deflect attention
from the important stuff which is the president
diddled around a guy who blow jobs from this bimbo.
That's the important stuff we ought to be focusing our attention on.
And thank God there's no partisan politics involved in that.
Trent Lott, you Nazi bastard, you prick.
We have an open line and date 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a mobile and sunrise.
Hello.
You know you are a terrible example for the youth of America.
Well you know something the youth of American
can't listen to this show because we're on here in Miami.
You're the same asshole that called yesterday.
Give me the same song and a dance.
You got a real boring voice.
You got a personality like a dead frog.
Blow it out your ass.
I'm a terrible example for them.
Let me say it again.
The youth of America, the ones who are in this market
and showed up at the pizza law last night
who've been listening to me for years and years.
They all grew up to be very normal.
Thank you very healthy, very productive,
very decent people with wives and kids and families.
Productive working with the guy houses.
How do you like that?
How did they manage to survive that?
If I'm such an evil, no good and why the hell are you listening?
Anyway, you idiotic bastard.
You and calling every day to give us a song and a dance.
If you don't like the show, find something else to do.
Stop being at the moon like a goddamn rabbit dog.
Because just like the moon, I'm not going away.
Okay.
I'll be here today.
I'll be here tomorrow.
I'll be here for a little while on Friday.
And that's the way it is whether you like it or not.
Okay.
So stop baying at the old.
Cock-a-roll.
Right.
You jackass with your real boring voice.
You sound like a guy.
You sound like Sandy Payton and drag.
Oh, she's not in drag.
It's for real.
We make something that makes so much goddamn sense
that it terrifies some of these bastards.
So they have to attack me because they can't debate it.
They can't argue it.
Oh, what you're saying makes no sense at all.
Of course it does.
It makes all the sense in the world.
And you can't refute it and you can't debate it.
Because you're too stupid to debate it.
Because you're unwilling to think.
You're unwilling to use your brain that separates you from
those stupid insects I was talking about before.
And that cat that's hung out in the goddamn backyard
at stupid cat.
Come on.
Cut it out.
Prevo 80.
Hello.
A-N-O.
Yes, sir.
A-N-O.
A, first of all, I want to wish you a happy calamowade.
A what?
A happy calamowade.
This was yesterday and it's still going on as we speak.
Oh.
That's a big deal.
Did you sniff your headdress?
I'll stick with the D&H.
Okay, I don't want any of these bubble monkeys.
You didn't sniff my headdress today.
No, I didn't sniff your anything today, no.
And I've come Liam and Zoni.
So he's always.
Okay.
Okay, we have an open line and Broward and two in date.
There's another crazy old joke.
Just go over there and dominate the wall.
Okay, just go away on it.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.
Probably going to be running off with your accountant
pretty soon.
Probably David's boyfriend.
5, 6, 7, 05, 60 and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a lady in Daniel.
Hello.
Hi.
Yes, ma'am.
I want to join your D&H.
All right, here's number five.
Oh.
D&H.
And you know the Christians are afraid they're going to go to hell
if they don't donate or they don't go to church and all
they've got them scared to death.
What a, now who in their right mind?
Well, how come they don't stop and think about this?
Who would want to believe in any religion where there's a God
that people invented who is so sadistic, so twisted
that if you don't believe a bunch of ridiculous ludicrous things
that nobody's saying would believe in the first place,
that you're going to wind up burning in hell for eternity?
Isn't that a pleasant thought?
They scat them.
Anyway, can I tell you a dirty joke on the air?
No.
Okay.
The other thing, stop your sugar.
The sugar puts on so much weight.
It's terrible.
And I call Trent Lock, Trent Mouse.
I got names for them and I'm sending them postcards
like mad.
I hope you're looking up with John Ford.
Okay, so we'd our have a great day.
Thanks.
Okay.
We have an open line in the Broward One Indeed.
567-0560,
0560 on the AT&T wireless line.
SS, baby, doesn't stand for secret service.
Not the secret police.
It stands for sugar and starch.
And just like the original,
like Hitler's, that says, same thing.
They're killers.
They'll kill you.
Killer carbohydrates.
That's what I should be doing.
I shouldn't be wasting my time sitting here talking
to a bunch of people that have no response to this
because it makes too much sense for them.
I should be out there peddling the damn AT&T instinct.
Then it might maybe motivate me to stick with it
and lose about 50 pounds
and look like a human being and get my health back again.
That's what I ought to be doing, right?
You let your sweet ass.
I'm calling up Bob Atkins this afternoon.
I'm going to say, Bob, I want to go out there
and spread the guy damn worried.
I want to go out there and spread it.
Lonely.
Lonely 50.
Million dollars.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
You ain't nothing, Bob.
Bob.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Y'all come back.
He's got one finger in his right nostril.
The other finger in his rectum.
And having a good old time.
All right, buddy.
We'll see you.
Well, that was Buddy McKay.
No wonder we got no chance.
Here's a mobile in Cooper City.
Hello.
Design, gozo.
Hello, Neil.
What is it?
Design, gozo.
Means what?
How you doing?
What does that mean?
What is that?
I don't know.
Oh, okay.
I think it's similar to
the Smok Step Kazoop.
Is that close?
No, I have no idea.
Anyway, Neil.
What do we do for you today, sir?
Start it in English.
Four and a half years.
We're eating some million dollars.
And central sex.
And I want to beat this guy.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
Okay, well, thank you.
We have an open line in Brown one and date.
56670560 and 0.560 on the AT&T wireless line.
Thanks for the great Z material, sir.
Here's a mobile in Pembert Pines.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay.
Yeah, you got to give me a fact number
because I got a factless letter to you from this.
Quote unquote this little quaint 47-year-old church
out in Arkansas.
I got a letter and it's from Jesus.
Sometime in the next week,
they can't give me an exact date
because I'm sure he's got a busy schedule.
Yeah, I couldn't.
I was appalled by this mailout.
Sometime in the next week,
Jesus will be passing by my house.
Oh my god.
Wow.
Hey, that's the same.
We had a call earlier in the show,
a lady who was at the pizza law last night
that got home and there was the letter in their box.
It takes the cake.
Yeah.
Sometime in the next week,
he's going to be passing by my house.
Okay, well, the fax is 305.
650.
0198.
I'd but listen to this.
Now, I got to take inside this letter,
there's another letter.
Okay, I have to take the letter
and I cannot open it.
And none of any circumstances,
I must not open this letter.
So I check a box,
a, b, c or d,
which is $5, $10, $20 or other.
Well, that's the price you take
for opening the envelope, right?
Now, I get it and it says
before you do anything,
do not.
I mean, any circumstances
opened this second letter
because I got to sleep on it overnight
and I cannot open it until sunset.
Yeah, I'm all wrong.
So what do the other letters say?
So that's all I got to send them a check
for $5, $10, $20 or other.
And then I get to put in there
what they want me to pray for when I'm on this,
I can understand that.
That's all about the second letter says?
Yeah, the first letter.
So if I wanted the second letter say
that you just said you're not supposed to open it.
I opened it up, of course.
And what does it say?
Why are you having so much trouble
communicating here, sir?
It says that I have to,
I have to pray to them what they want me to pray for
and my prayers will be answered.
But how can I mail a letter
to this 47 year old church today
and they're going to have it
and pray for me by sunset tomorrow.
But when you open it up,
FedEx overnight mail.
But when you open it up,
that's it to me, $6,500198.
Thank you.
We have an open line in front.
Why was it so difficult to squeeze out of him the answer?
I think maybe they've got,
they're already working on his mind.
His mind is turning into jello
just for opening the envelope.
I think it's a Kami Pinko plot if you ask me.
And they wanted money, huh?
Uh-huh.
Wow, what a shock.
Like I said, DNH,
do no harm.
Here's a religion that don't cost you a penny.
It doesn't cost a single solitary dime.
And then we'll follow it up.
Have to forget everybody in this religion.
We'll follow it up with like a one that's like optional.
DSG do some good.
DNH in the beginning and then DSG.
If you want, do some good if you can.
If not, okay, we won't hold it against you.
You still won't burn in hell.
Proc 26, the WQM,
there's an open line in data.
It's interesting to watch these things flick off of there.
You know, it watches a phone line that's flick off,
which makes you either wonder about the people at Bell South,
where I did them with it,
or just that these people are very impatient.
You made that point yesterday,
which I never really thought about before.
I'm the old station,
which I don't want to mention to call it.
Because we don't want to go back.
We want to go forward.
But on the old station,
people used to call if they,
you know, they really hung on like a for a long time.
W-I-O-D.
Oh, I hate that state.
But here they call and like the new thing is,
I mean, if they do ever call,
if you don't get to like within five seconds,
oh, they're gone, they're busy.
But like I said,
I don't worry about it because starting day,
I got a whole new leash on life.
And if you think I'm joking,
you're dreaming.
I will never ever,
I must be a messicus.
I must be out of my mind.
I got to be a fool.
But I would ever subject myself to that kind of
begging and screaming and carrying on and foolishness.
What's the point?
What is the point?
How many years have been taken off my life
because I got myself sucked into doing that here on this show?
What an idiot.
What an imbus alarm.
The first one to say it.
I'm a schmuck.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'm a belt stop mobility.
You've already cost me five bucks.
Yeah.
Anyways, I wanted to start.
That's a little worth it.
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
Yeah, it is because I wanted to tell you
about the psychic powers of your show.
I'm a pharmaceutical rep and I just left the company
and I was trying to reach this little witch with a bee
that worked at my other company.
And I don't have her page or with me.
Yeah.
And she called you five minutes ago.
How do you like that?
So I was just thinking of her.
So if you're still listening,
Lisa, page me, okay?
I'm the late boss.
See, there you go.
Thanks, Neil.
It's better than Schrold Griffin.
It's like the psychic friends that work.
I'm not going to use a page or any more.
I'm just going to call everybody through your show.
All right.
All right, buddy.
See ya.
Bye.
Well, I'm gagging this.
Slow down when that's a girl.
Okay, it's really good.
But uh, uh, too late.
Well, I think I got a real good greenie coming up, baby.
We have an open line in date, five, six, seven,
oh, five, 60 and pound five, 60 on the 18 T wireless line.
No calls about this Peter War rel incident
about Brian Murray, Lucienet.
I'm just, I just can't get over that.
That comment.
Darcy Tucker stuck an index finger in his mouth
repeatedly and gesturing to a rail.
And Murray thought it was making fun of where
all is a banana eating ape.
What kind of a comment is that?
I mean, if a guy goes like,
fuck, fuck, fuck, man, chicken, even little kids know that.
It's got nothing to do with a racial slur.
I think BM, I think he's solutionating.
I think his brother, Terry, needs to send him off to Kampselmer.
Send him up to a Caloet for a few months during the season.
Okay, Terry.
Terry's doing a stellar job.
He's a good guy.
He's got him a really plan.
They were great last night.
They might be better than we thought.
But BM, Shia, we'll be Shia.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Neo.
Yes, sir.
My FedEx driving circumcised first time calling Julio.
Great.
They ought to pay triple for what you make.
You have to deal with these idiots that call you every day.
Yeah.
I'm two more days for the hot these season.
I can't hardly wait even though we got our young prospects
that are going to lead us into the playoffs.
Well, they look pretty good last night.
I got to tell you this kid, Mark Parrish,
he's got to lead the team with six goals.
The preseason, he looks outstanding.
And this Kavasha kids playing good.
And that's his he's SpaceX.
That kid's not too bad.
And, uh, he'll be there Friday night.
I can't wait.
There's one other one.
It's that Ratchard kid.
He looks pretty good too.
Even though they might have to send him down.
Yeah, we're against Kamp from.
They use the free agent, right?
Ratchard.
They use the free agent.
Yeah.
They thought about on a bus and a dumpster.
Where do you think the devil's are going to be at this year?
I haven't seen any other teams play.
So why don't start making predictions to the last season's turn.
So I haven't, you know, exhibition games mean nothing.
All right.
I want to ask for two things.
Just suck around for a no BM button if you have any left.
No.
No.
And shameless request, uh, the president and Elmer Fudd on your next break.
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
Is that in here, by the way?
What is that called?
Huh?
You know the one I mean to settle like comedy thing
from a Clinton and the Elmer Fudd?
What does that call, George?
I know it's not in there.
It's not in there.
Like I said, forget it.
OK.
We got two open lines in a day.
Well, now that we got all that hard drive time in here,
now we can start getting all this other stuff in here.
You know what I'm talking about?
That we weren't able to do because, uh, yeah, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5,
60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's a mobile and crawl springs.
Hello?
Reverend Ningo.
Yes, sir.
Speak to me.
Can I have a number?
Number three?
Go ahead.
All right.
Ningo, I want to thank you for yesterday.
It was fantastic.
We have the numbers.
I'm sure you got the wrong show.
OK.
I want to say what I mean for your religion.
Yeah.
No numbers.
And I want to thank you for the show
that your parents last night.
It was just great.
Yeah.
And Blatha, CDs, and this number two was great.
It's different.
I really liked it.
They're all great.
They're both great.
Yeah, they're both great.
This number one was great.
It was everything I expected.
Yeah, number two is outrageous.
That's right.
But this number two has some surprises on it.
And I really liked it.
Excellent.
And people should buy both of them as a set.
And I wanted to say something about the old goals
that he's not disgusting.
He's very interested.
And I appreciated the fact he was there.
And he actually gave me a signed copy
of his illustrated style report.
Yeah.
And that's why you liked him.
Because he gave you something.
The other the bitch that called me for.
You didn't get anything from him.
So you don't like him.
Well, and also I think the Yankees
are going to do to everybody else
what the braves did to the cops.
OK.
Good luck to you, sir.
OK.
We have an open line of Brad, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
No sports talk today.
OK.
Only a little hockey talk.
And it's not really about hockey.
It's about the racial problems
that Brian Maria's hallucinating about.
Bok, bok, bok.
Oh my god.
Where is that thing, by the way?
See, it's very hard.
It's hard to hit the button when you got your,
you have to do with one arm like that.
Like that.
One more.
One more.
OK.
There you go.
Here's a mobile in Pembert Pines.
Hello.
And here I go.
OK, sir.
I stop by the hooters there.
And they give you a birthday in Pines.
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention they gave all the stuff away
in their long run.
They were mobdys.
They just wanted to say thank a male,
a listener, and a caller.
Right.
Just wanted to say thank.
And a lot of Tommiki Street is a dish bag.
All right.
So yeah, there you go.
Yeah, they, you know, Sam, I guess,
expected to be people.
They're waiting for them.
They showed up once you guys got there, OK?
Because they had free stuff.
And like 50 billion people showed up.
The free stuff is gone.
And they were gone like 10 after 12.
Boy, am I gagging on it?
I think somebody has doctored my stogie.
Is what I think.
Either better somebody put it in a recomb plate.
Reckomb.
Oh, geez.
Yeah.
See?
I told you, first, Mark Belanjay and Cal Ripken
seniors got that problem.
Are you kids out there?
No smoking, OK?
I'll kill you.
All you young people, it's a filthy, disgusting,
habitant discolors your teeth that gives you a bad breath.
It'll grow you a 200 size of a guy
that in grapefruit, maybe even a watermelon.
Oh, see, I shouldn't have said watermelon.
Brian Maria would be calling in.
How about if I said watermelon and went like that
as the same?
Oh, geez.
I can't believe he said that.
Let me look at it one more time.
He thought he was making fun of who
well as a banana eating ape.
Because he went, I know.
Brian, you need some a sure your shop, OK?
You need some a sure your therapy.
Hey, you want to put something good in your mouth?
And no matter you, here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello?
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Greetings. How are you?
Great.
Never made a matter, sir.
Greatest day of my life.
You may needle down and kiss the rings
to be an honorary member of DNH.
Neil, God.
No, it's funny though.
You say, do not harm, but I guarantee you're
going to have somebody's religious,
fanatic, calling them saying, do not harm.
What do you think you're doing?
By doing all your hatred on the air.
It's purely hatred about what?
hatred of what?
I'm not the heater.
They're the ones that have hate.
Yeah, well, that's there.
You know something I talked about this two hours ago,
and here it is almost one o'clock.
I still have an at one call from these good,
brainwashed believers out there.
Other than the ones who want to attack me,
having at one call tell me why this is such a bad idea.
Why this doesn't make any sense?
They're blowing some out here, Neil.
You keep doing what you're doing.
OK.
Arthur.
See you.
Don't let me eat too much of this.
I'm just having a little bite.
I want my mother to start hypervatalating,
because I'm going there for lunch today.
OK, that's enough.
No, it's not.
Ashtole, mind your own business.
Don't be a Yenta.
Remember, Sonny Hirsch once said,
don't be a Yenta.
Look what happened to him.
We have two open lines in Broward, five six, seven,
oh five, 60, pound five, 60.
I am, see, I'm not going to beg for calls,
but I'm begging and pleading for somebody to call
to dispute the truth of DNA.
I mean, we know that DNA is indisputable.
OJ taught us that.
Monica taught us that.
And the same is true, no matter what letter is on the end,
DNH, do no harm.
Why do we need these religious institutions?
Why do you need to have someplace to go on these stupid holidays?
Why do you got to go there and put a stupid schmata on your head?
Why do you go there and stick a dumb wafer in your post?
Why do you got to go there and confess your sins
that somebody else called sins,
because you had a good time, maybe,
to some stupid pansy in a dress
that's sitting on the other side of a confessional booth,
getting off on it, okay?
They think the priest has got a head cold over there
to hear a lot of heavy breathing in the puke on the other side.
I got news for it, baby.
He's yanking it.
And if the church is really so sure to cash,
all I got to start doing is putting quarters
to put the slots in the arrow on the confessional booth.
That's right.
Let them pay for it.
Two open lines in Broward, five, six, seven, oh five,
60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless.
You think we have, by two o'clock,
we'll have one person here called today
and have a legitimate discussion about this who disagrees.
Will there be one who's got the courage
in their convictions?
No.
You bet your suite as there won't.
Because they know I can talk circles around them
and four seconds or less,
because they don't make any sense.
Oh, you better watch out,
because you're gonna burn it.
Oh, yeah.
Focus, focus.
That's the focus.
Here's Lauder Hill. Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I want to know where you're coming from,
what you're doing, and what are you trying to prove?
About what?
Watch all I'm asking.
About what?
What you're talking about, like there is no God.
How do you know?
I beg your pardon?
How do you know there is no God?
I'm not the one who suggested that there was.
See, the burden of proof is on it.
Sir, do you want to answer your question?
Yeah, okay.
And if you believe that there's a God,
if somebody tells me there's a God
then the burden of proof is on you.
It's not a negative burden.
I don't have to prove that there isn't one.
You have to prove that there is one.
Okay, what I don't want to say is
if you let me for one second.
I'm listening.
Okay, when we are brought up, whatever religion we are,
whatever nationality do.
I'm trying to make people think instead of being brainwashed.
In other words, if you happen to be lucky enough
to be born into the family that's of the right religion
then you're going to be saved.
Is that what you're suggesting?
No, no, no, I believe in every religion.
I believe in everybody has their religion.
I am not against anybody religion.
Yeah.
The one I'm trying to get.
What about in Northern Ireland, sir?
Do you think those people ought to be encouraged
to keep coming each other?
They're animals.
They're animals.
And what about in the Middle East?
You're going to know what to do.
And what about in Indian Pakistan?
You're going to know what to do?
And what about the religious right-wingness
country that's been debiting abortion clinics?
God, here you make no sense.
You're just a babbling old fool, okay?
I want to talk to somebody who's got some substance.
Not just talk littering generalities and spout
and spew guys too old to have a goddamn brain of his own.
I believe in all religions.
Great.
Then you're crazier than any of the rest of these bastards, okay?
One is bad enough.
But all of you must be crazier than a bedbug.
Call a goddamn exterminator, okay?
We got bedbugs in the phone.
Oh!
Two open lines in Broward.
Five, six.
See, that's what I mean.
I sat here patiently waiting for an intelligent conversation.
All their animals anyway.
Yeah, they're animals.
They're not animals.
They're people just like everybody else,
but they've been brainwashed and they're filled with hate.
And they hate each other because they can't coerce
the other ones to believe the same fairy tales.
And you know something, they're all Christians.
That's the most bizarre part of the whole deal.
The Protestants and the Catholics over there
to hate each other like poison, that's not the only place.
Is it the Lutherans?
Is it the Methodist?
Is it which sect are we talking about?
Who's which ones got the Tony, baby?
That's the question of the day.
Which ones got the Tony?
Who's got the real answer?
And I'll tell you right now, who's got the real answer?
Nobody's got the real answer.
Nobody like Harvey Paxes on a goddamn Belmont Racing Show.
Nobody picks.
And you do?
Because I got more people on my side
and my people are reproducing like rabbits.
DNH, do no harm.
It makes absolutely all a sense in the world.
Simple, cost you no money.
Nope, empty promises of bullcrap.
No devil with a pitchfork and a tail
and all these and the horns and angels
with their little harps.
Oh, God, you're good.
Yeah, for eternity.
I'd rather be burned out in the lake of fire, okay?
Than to be the rest of my...
Oh, God, you're good.
And I just keep saying that I like it.
Oh, God, you're good.
That's what they have to look forward to these people.
Their souls are going to be saved.
I got news for you, okay?
I'm looking at my souls.
They're pretty goddamn worn out.
Okay, must be all I'm walking in Europe.
Gotta go out and get a new goddamn pair of shoes
because I can't even save the souls on my shoes
as much as the soul.
Oh, man, who's got a soul.
How do you function without a brain and a heart?
Did anybody ever ask that question?
Anybody ever see anybody make a comeback?
No.
I haven't seen it.
Once they stick your ass in the ground,
that's where you stay, baby.
And it may not be...
And what kind of a God will create that anyway?
I mean, if we understand that nature,
that all things are part of nature,
and every species has a lifespan,
then we can understand that.
We may not like it.
It might like to be around for two, three hundred years,
or instead of like 70 or 80 or 90, whatever it's going to be.
But if that's the plan of nature,
if that's the way nature works,
we can understand that.
There's a logic to that.
But if there was some kind of a God,
who invoked created man,
and only gave him a very short lifespan,
what kind of a sadistic, no good God is that?
We were made to live forever.
Only sin, kill.
Yeah, only sin.
Only this devil again, okay?
And since God knew up front right in the beginning
because of the fact that he's...
he's omniscient, and I...
because he knows everything.
He knew ahead of time
when he kept tempting these people,
what the choice would be.
And then the...
the simpletons that wrote these bubble mice,
he's, oh, well, he got pissed off.
Well, how could he get pissed off?
And he knew what was going to happen anyway.
You have to be an imbecile to believe this.
You have to be mentally deficient to believe this crap.
And then he's going to punish you
and make you burn in hell,
like all those people that he killed,
when Noah, when that old slipper Noah,
got out there and built the ark.
And if...
let me ask you this,
if God created the whole universe and the sun
and the stars and the moon and the cockamount,
how come Noah, this poor old slipper,
had to build the ark?
Why didn't God just go?
But I'm being...
Huh?
Oh, there's an ark.
Look at that.
Lookie here.
Look at that thing.
And I guarantee you God would have made a better ark
than that poor old slipper Noah.
One that could have fat the dinosaurs on.
And probably had a hell of a lot better turlits on there too,
for all those damn dinosaurs, that's right.
Man, oh man.
Can you...
Like I said before,
how'd you like to have had the turlits concession on that ark?
Woo!
Talk about heavy duties.
Here's a mobile-informed Myers, hello.
Hey, uh, I just wanted to tell you,
the reason you're not going to get anybody coming
to talk to you,
you're like little Tarathie on the Wizard of Oz.
You're throwing water.
These witches don't want to come anywhere near you.
Oh, is that it?
Yeah, it's it.
Yeah.
You don't think so?
Yeah, I get it.
But the thing makes too much, you're what you're saying,
makes too much that.
Yeah, you're right.
That's the problem.
They can't deal with it.
They can't cope with it.
It's too simple.
They want to make it complicated and it's very easy.
Yeah, you know, you actually have lots of listeners
over here in Fort Myers.
I know that.
The problem is,
you don't have any kind of cold-free lines
with children, everybody.
You get on here.
Yeah, well listen, it's the beesleaves, the beesleaves.
Yeah. Yeah.
They're too cheap to put a toll-free line in.
You kidding?
Yeah.
Okay, just thought about it.
Let you know we're listening.
God bless you, sir.
Okay, bye.
Like I said.
Damn God.
Bless you.
We got a member over Fort Myers.
P and H. You know something?
This is going to scare all those far-bison out there.
I'm making more converts on one show today,
and this is only the beginning.
And you want to know why?
Because it makes sense, number one, and number two, it's free.
It doesn't cost your penny to join this outfit.
Do no harm.
That's all.
Like they say, it's basketball.
No harm, no foul.
That's the only religion that makes sense.
You teach that to kids.
Oh, yeah, okay.
That sounds reasonable.
Unlike those weird stories that they were trying to teach us before.
And about hating everybody who doesn't believe the same crap that we do.
We don't hate anybody.
We just get along.
We just survive.
And if you want to associate with somebody you do, if you don't, you associate with somebody else,
that's all do no harm.
Like I said, I should be at the United Nations right now broadcasting intercontinental.
I should be all over the goddamn world on a satellite preaching the absolute goddamn.
Oh, God.
That's right.
The word of what's his name and put an end to all this tax-free bullcraft,
the biggest scam in the history of the human race.
And I feel so sorry for people who are so brainwashed that they can't use one little,
that they have taken the ability to think they've had to take it away.
It's been, it's that's a sin.
If there's such a thing as a sin, I've said this before, that's a sin.
When you steal somebody's ability to use their brain,
the one thing that separates us from the cockroaches and all those other crawling scabby creatures,
the human brain,
and they want to take that away from you as early as possible,
because once you're old enough to start thinking about, hey, this is a bunch of crap,
this is like Santa Claus in the tooth for once you're old enough to start reasoning like that,
they're never going to get you.
You're a lost cause.
So just like Hitler with his not-so-youth,
they have to brainwash you from the earliest moments with bullcrab.
For a minute, I'm still waiting here, it is one o'clock coming up after the break.
One o'clock, the one to two hour coming up, have them,
and we still had anybody other than that, a babbling, dottering old fool,
who was talking double talk, and we had one?
No.
Not one.
And like the guy said, just like Dorothy, just call me Dorothy Rogers, okay?
Pathetic.
Hey, if you're looking for me, knew that this Saturday,
QAM's got the college game of the year, right here.
It's UM against Florida State, live from the Orange East.
That's right.
That's about 3.30 right here on sports radio, 5.60, QAM.
And when those testicles they have come knocking on my door,
I grabbed my red pajamas and my pink for you.
All right, great.
All right, Neil.
Thanks for the great tale.
See ya. See ya.
Okay.
We have an open line in the Dave County, 5.60, 7.05, 60,
and POM 5.60 on a mobile one line.
Oh, you heard the good news.
Yeah, the good news is you're out of here, okay?
That's the good news.
The good news that the door is slamming in your face,
and I'm going back to watching my day in soap opera, whatever.
Boy, oh boy.
By the way, speaking of soap opera, is it matter?
Has anybody ever seen so much terraced at the same time as guiding light?
Wow.
We got Diana who just won't die because she didn't take quite enough blood pressure pills.
We got Ben who just won't die because he's a miserable SOB.
We got Blake who's all of a sudden walking like a miracle now,
and Ross is in the middle of it, and wow.
You think you got problems turning on guiding light,
and it really cracks me up.
These guys did say, oh, what kind of a guy watches a soap opera?
And then I was listening to Henka a couple of weeks ago.
And he was doing this thing, or no, it was managed, filling in.
Asked about guys not watching Monday night football,
and you'd be amazed at how many guys were calling in saying
they're watching Melrose Place on Monday night.
Now, is Melrose Place a soap opera?
Last time I checked.
Do people watch it because there's a lot of hot flesh on there?
Right, just like we watch soap operas the daytime.
Hey, Billy, just keep your mouth shut, Billy.
Billy is looking real good on guiding light.
If he just doesn't talk, you know, he's got that little...
Here's a mobile and four-lotter nail. Hello.
How you doing, Neil?
Okay, sir.
I've been thinking about your topic today.
Yes, and it made me start to think that, you know,
if you start thinking back during the Renaissance period
and all during medieval times,
it was the best way to keep the sheep in line.
Yes, scare them.
If you scare them by saying, hey, if you don't do this,
you're going to very bad life.
You're not going to lose them worth of damn.
That's what that old, Madeleine O'Herz said before she ran off
with all the money.
Religion without a hell isn't worth a damn.
Nobody's going to be into it.
That's life after death and heaven and hell.
That's what it's all about.
That is so true.
You know what?
I'm a hulio.
I was that type of a Catholic.
But you know what?
The first day of what I saw is just the Bible is a good book of fiction.
No, it's not even a good book of fiction.
It's a twisted and distorted and warped and full of hate inside courses
and it makes no sense whatsoever and contradictions.
It tells a good story and it doesn't tell a horrible story.
Well, the thing is, you have to take the good things out of it.
You have to take the morality parts out of it.
You have to take the good things out of it.
The parts that you say, hey, you shouldn't kill people, it's not good.
But if your children are disobedient, they shall surely be stoned in death.
You can't be selectively pious.
You can't just pick and choose what makes sense
and out of a book that makes no sense in its totality.
You can't do that.
Isn't that what you're doing?
You're choosing what makes sense.
No, I'm not.
That's not what I'm doing at all.
I didn't get it out of a book.
I got it from common sense.
I didn't need somebody to write me a book saying you don't harm other people.
You don't steal their property.
You don't hurt people.
That doesn't require reading a book.
I never said I was my life-fizer book.
But what I'm saying is you can do a pickout.
Just like you do on any other book
that you can pick up that tells a good story that teaches morality.
I mean, I can leave a bunch of them out there.
It teaches morality about how all these people had slaves
and they were begetting and begetting this one and that one and everything.
All the sottomy and the incest that was going on.
You're nailing down the really, you know, medieval point.
The stuff that's really...
The medieval points.
It's going to take a little medieval, anything.
If I got the book right back here, I'll get the damn book out.
If you want me to, it's got nothing to do with medieval or anything.
It's right in the...
Go read it, pal. Have a great day.
See, he's making a little bit of progress.
Okay, he's taking like one about a half a baby step.
But he can't take the rest of the step.
Show the book away.
Okay, go burn it somewhere.
Go have a good time.
All these right wingers are in the book burning.
There's one that ought to be burned.
Because it's full of sickness and twisted crap.
Oh, disobedient children.
She'll surely be stoned to death.
Well, that sounds great.
And that's coming right from God himself.
That loving God who loves us.
But boy, he gets pissed off.
And every time he gets pissed off,
his wrath shall wax hot because...
Pist off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that.
That's right. That's right there.
At the beginning of Genesis, that's what God says.
And that's why his wrath is waxing hot.
Some days it's so hot even listens to waxing.
He's the one.
Till he heard Rene Rion there doing that Uga Buga.
QA air.
You get a lot of beef.
Farts.
The O' Rogers on the sports hall radio.
WQA.
Two at two o'clock.
We got the boogster at six.
Then we got the pop raisin Atlanta 745 tonight.
We're getting to the big stuff.
Here's Hollywood. Hello.
Uncle Neil.
Yes, sir. How you doing, sir?
Can you start me?
Can you start me up for any DNA?
Okay, your number 5,000.
This thing is growing like topsy, man.
All right, awesome.
Hey, sir.
I'm trying to change the subject and religion.
Something else that affects all of us.
About 25 minutes ago on CNBC.
Yes.
General Reno was on there talking about how the department justice has just filed an antitrust
lawsuit against Mastercard and Visa.
She was saying something or other about it because they're both owned by the same company.
Or something or other about their own both owned by the same banks or something.
But it really it affects all of them.
So what does that mean?
Well, just a part of the big family.
Just the antitrust, the monopoly.
So we're going to get some money back?
I don't know. She went gibber jabber.
Well, I'm interested of us.
Yeah. Yeah, right.
She was gibber jabbering.
She does that very well. She gibber jabbered a lot.
Well, like I said, I didn't understand all of it.
I didn't get on the all of the technical stuff or whatever.
But I caught the gist of it.
Yeah.
But anyway, I have a shameless request.
Yes, sir.
Okay, next break. Can you play Casey Kasem?
Which one?
The one that he's where he's cursing.
Okay.
All right. Also, Neil.
Yes?
Try Gilbert's world and then Jerry.
What is it?
It's called Gilbert's world.
Oh, Gilbert.
I think you said Gilbert's world.
I was like, okay, thanks a lot, pal.
Get out of here.
I thought he said Gilbert.
And then it's not like he said Gilbert's world.
I passed on that.
My favorite moment of our thing at the last Saturday
when we were at borders over by the gallery was when Gilbert,
right after he's saying the national anthem.
Where the hell is it?
Oh, no.
What after he's saying, I mean, that's a national anthem.
Well, I'm stall on for a time after he's saying,
take me out to the ball game and he said,
I thought that I would stop it so far.
And everybody in unison said, uh-huh.
Here's a mobile in Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, good show, interesting show.
I respect your opinion.
Let me take for a minute.
Yes.
I'd like for you to go to the New Testament of the Bible.
And, uh, you know, that gives a good message.
Read that.
Where's that?
Read John 316.
And, uh, where are you going to start with that again?
You've been going to too many football games for John's health experience.
Yeah, I follow my logic for one minute.
Okay.
See, before you go on with your logic,
let me just say this one thing.
You okay?
Okay.
People who drive around with a little fish on the back of their car.
Yeah.
And people who go to sporting events holding up these signs, John 316.
These are intolerant people who should not be there.
They're unacceptable to me because they're flooding their beliefs,
which they're entitled to believe whatever they want.
They're flooding them in places where it doesn't belong.
That's right.
I don't want somebody out there sticking their religion,
I know, is when I'm driving my car in the highway
that I help pay for with my tax money.
And I certainly don't want somebody when I go to pay to go to a ballgame,
holding up those religious signs of any kind or denomination.
Well, God gave us free will, you know?
Yeah, we can, yeah, we can.
I mean, we can...
Sir, do you realize how stupid that is?
God is omniscient.
That means He knows everything.
And so we knew the outcome of all the decisions ahead of time.
Right.
Well, how can that be right?
And man had free will.
Neil, let me ask you.
All right.
I agree with you about work.
No, sir, you said you would use that all day.
You wanted to have a conversation.
Listen to me.
Well, listen to me.
I want you to answer my question.
If God knows ahead of time, what the hell...
He knows everything ahead of time.
Right.
How could He give man free will when He knew ahead of time
what choices man would make?
How could He have been dismayed and distraught
that they made the wrong choices when He already knew?
Why did He tempt them?
Why did He put...
Why did He...
Why did He give them the chance to fail
when He knew if given the chance they would fail?
Right.
I did not know the answer that question.
I couldn't pretend to know the answer that question.
Well, how can you bring something that makes so little sense?
I know something you don't know.
Yes.
I have had...
There's a difference between religion and the spiritual world.
I've had a...
And what is a spiritual world?
That is your relationship with God.
And as Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
I've had that.
I believe...
What does that mean?
Well, what that means is that...
That we replies that...
You know...
That He was our Creator.
Does that make...
I mean...
It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
First of all, when you say,
What does He got like two eyes in a mouth and a nose?
Is He got a big...
A tail like the devil?
What does that mean?
Well, let me...
Let me say this, you know...
I believe that we were created by a power bigger than ourselves.
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
Why do you say that?
Why do you mean...
If you look at those...
You asked me a question, I give you an answer.
You just keep on talking.
Are you do not believe in God?
Of course not.
Right.
Okay.
All right.
How could anybody believe anything so silly?
Well, I mean, what is your answer?
My answer to what?
To how we're here.
My answer to how we're here.
How about if I give you three words, okay?
Yes.
I don't know.
All right.
Well, so you don't know.
Right?
Yes, and so I'm not going to make up some ridiculous story that somebody else...
You don't know how we're here.
Yes.
Okay.
And let me take it once that further.
I don't know and I don't care.
All I know is that I am here.
And I'm going to make the best of it, okay?
I don't care about try to explore things for which I could never have the answer.
They happen millions and billions of years ago.
We can't even...
Listen, I don't like that.
We can't even...
We can't even conceive what a thousand years is like.
Okay.
A hundred years maybe, because some people live a little over a hundred years.
Right.
But a thousand years is beyond our ability to understand to cope with.
Okay.
So the concept of understanding of dealing with millions of years or billions of years is so far beyond our scope to understand.
Right.
Then what's the point?
Well, the point is, you know, there are things that we don't know.
Yeah.
Oh, well, that's good.
That's a good start.
There are things that you and I don't know.
And let me...
What, your DNA...
That's a good thing.
Now, where did our moral...
The ender come from?
The Bible, correct?
No, of course not.
I doubt it's gonna kill.
All the things that you're saying...
Sure, let me say it again.
Let me say it again.
Before these silly old men wrote that stuff, died.
Civilized people, which there were some actually back then, just through common sense.
Right.
Understood those things.
Right.
But the same book that you're talking about, I'll repeat it again.
It's only one example.
Right.
Says, disobedient children, shall surely be stoned to death.
That's the Old Testament, Dale.
Yeah.
Okay. And people...
People are people that...
They're people that are making and choosing.
You can't have the New Testament without the Old Testament, because Jesus was a Jew.
It's all for...
Hey, Jesus was a Jew.
You bet.
You bet he was.
And you came now, follow my life for one minute.
I respect your opinion.
Did Jesus refute any of the Old Testament?
All right, let me...
No, just follow the life.
I want you to answer my question.
Okay.
Did Jesus anywhere in the Scriptures refute anything that it says in the Old Testament?
I don't know with the...
I don't know if he would answer to.
He had told me that he would not do five-seventeen.
Hey, Dale.
Yes.
I don't know if he was asked to.
I mean, did somebody ask him about that?
Well, if he had a purpose of giving the people the real word about what...
What salvation is all about.
If there was something in there that was wrong, of course he would have said...
He would have done it, but he didn't do it.
Dale, he came to be an example of how to live.
And he...
He talked about the same thing about religion that you're talking about.
Sir, I want to tell you something.
Yes.
There's a very, very high probability that there was never any such person as Jesus Christ, okay?
Well, I mean, you know, that's an opinion.
No, it's not an opinion.
It's a fact.
There's a very high probability that he never existed.
Well, I mean, that's something, you know, that that...
Obviously, as your opinion, or there isn't a opinion of people that that didn't happen.
Yeah.
Let me...
Let me ask you this.
Let me get back to one thing.
Who killed President Kennedy?
Who killed President Kennedy?
Yeah.
I don't know for sure.
And now, when did that happen?
That happened in 1963.
Right.
That's 35 years ago, right?
Now, how can you be so positive about something that allegedly happened 2,000 years ago?
Well, because I've had a spiritual experience, I won't use religion because we're...
You know, religion has problems because men and women are in charge of it.
What is a spiritual experience?
I'll tell you.
I have to think like you did, okay?
And there's nothing wrong with that.
But I also used to drink alcohol for 30 years.
Oh, okay.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
Wow.
We finally got to the bottom line.
From what addictions?
Right.
Say hi to our friends over there at Paxton, who were all there over there before we got out.
All those recovering alcoholism.
I'm not going to recover alcoholism, okay?
But if you would have said that at the very beginning of the call,
and we could have gone through the whole 13-step program,
and we could have saved a hell of a lot of time,
and if that's what helps you make it through today,
without a little bit of...
What are you doing?
More power to you, okay?
Maybe it'll help me stop eating sugar and starts.
Maybe I should pick up the good book.
Okay, let's go back here and get the Bible.
Okay?
I'm holding the Bible right here.
The Old Testament, the New Testament, is it in here?
I'm squeezing it.
I got my hands on it and the Bible too.
And I'm still on Starch and Sugar.
How do you like that?
Isn't that said?
Didn't work.
Well, I haven't worked that hard enough yet.
Okay, I haven't even got to the first step.
Much less the second one.
Oh my God.
I apologize profusely to myself.
But like I said, you know, I give these people a ton of time
because I'm waiting for the punchline.
And the punchline was,
he's recovering alcoholic and therefore, you know,
he said her in so on.
Great.
Here's a lady in our West Palm.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, my name's Kelly.
This is Neil, right?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, good.
Hang on one second.
Sure.
Okay, let's see if that made the echo go away.
It works like a charm.
Yes, go ahead.
Okay.
Well, I agree with your new religion.
But I'm also a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,
I do think is quite important.
Well, what does that mean?
A personal relationship?
Did he come over for dinner?
No, he's not going to plan it heaven.
But, you know, he's a planet heaven.
Planet heaven or planet hell?
Planet heaven.
Planet heaven.
How's under the ground?
4000 miles down.
Under the ground, he's down there with Pat Boone,
the journey to the center of the earth.
Yeah, hell's in the center of the earth.
That's what they say.
The center of the earth is like a molten, hot plastic.
Yeah.
That's where hell is.
Uh-huh.
And, you know, the lake fire is down there too.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
So, um, but I agree with you know, if everybody would do no harm to everybody else,
it would be great, except that there is a real devil.
And there is evil in the world.
There's a real devil.
How come God doesn't hear rid of the devil, ma'am?
Well, um, the devil, he can't get rid of the devil because he, he,
he provides by his own laws.
If he says something, if he says something, he's not going to go back on.
How about, how about when he got rid of all of Ma'am kind except Noah and his family with the Ark when he got pissed off
because Ma'am was acting pretty goofy.
He didn't like it.
Oh, what do you mean he can't go back on his own word?
He changes his mind all the time.
Well, he didn't, he didn't change his word there.
He, he never said that he wouldn't destroy Ma'am kind of.
Yeah.
Well, what kind of a loving, kind of a loving God destroys Ma'am kind instead of looking down away with his magic finger
and makes Ma'am obedient and stop doing all the crap around.
What, Ma'am, what, what kind of a sick creature are you talking about that you placed your faith in
that just Willie Nilly keeps destroying all his life that he created?
He, God the Father does say he did.
Sounds like a mad professor to me.
He is God the Father and then there's the sun.
Okay, thank you.
She's not responding like you'd expect because you can't.
We have an open line at Broward, 5-San and it's, it's sad.
These are living and breathing people and they're just repeating by wrote.
The same crap that's been pounded into their heads since they were little children.
Oh, and God that's the Strother and the Son of Hail Mary, Holy Mother of God, by the name of God.
Yeah, right.
Say 6,000 Hail Mary's and we can stop all of this book.
Say 200,000 Hail Mary's it'll keep you off the street.
You're rubbing a rosary beads and Father of Tools and Aaron, he's rubbing something else.
I guarantee you that right now.
Because he wants to alter your life.
Well, what answer do you have?
I don't have any answers.
I don't want any answers.
I don't really give a crap.
Doesn't interest me in the least bit.
Be like winding up in the middle of downtown Manhattan without a car without any clothing.
But you got, you know, in your wallet you got $5 million in cold cash somehow.
You just wake up one day and there you are.
In a plush pet house suite at some hotel in Manhattan.
Now, are you going to say to yourself, how did I get here? Where did I come from?
No, you're going to go out there and have a good time.
Or you're going to hop on a plane and go wherever you want to go. That's it.
127 and 5, I'll tell you to be out of shadow. But this is beyond religion. That's Ben and Jerry's.
I'm squeezing it tightly. Do I still want Ben and Jerry's? Do I still have those sugar cravings?
You bet your sweet ass I did.
Hey, hey.
Reunion.
All the white folks hate the black folks and the black folks hate the white folks to hate all but the right folks
is an old established rule but during national brotherhood week, national brotherhood week,
lean or horn and sheriff Clark are dancing cheap to cheegets, fun to utilize but people you despise as long as you don't let them in your school.
All the poor folks hate the rich folks and the rich folks hate the poor folks. All of my folks hate all of your folks.
It's American as apple pie.
I love you, ring.
National brotherhood week, national brotherhood week, New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans cause it's very cheap.
Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand. You can tolerate him if you try.
All the Protestants hate the Catholics and the Catholics hate the Protestants and the Hindus hate the Muslims and everybody hates the Jews but during
national brotherhood, national brotherhood week, national everyone smile at one and nothing good week be nice to people who are inferior to you.
It's only for a week so have no fear.
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.
That's the American way.
You said it sweetheart 133 at 560 WQAM.
Here's a mobile in homestead. Hello.
Hello. Yes sir.
Neil, I've been following your advice and thinking for myself and it's provoked two questions for you.
Yes sir.
The first is, you know, you are encouraging all of the older people in date county to get out because it would improve the county significantly.
I'm what?
You are encouraging all of the old people to get out of date.
What did I say that?
Oh frequently.
What are the problems with date county is that there are so many old people.
No, that's Broward County. You got a backwards here. That's Broward.
Well Broward or date.
No Broward.
I think that's the same.
Yes. No, it's not the same. Not at all.
Well, I've seen a couple of pictures of you and you don't appear to be a teenager to me.
Yeah. I'm a scary old teenager.
You are.
I'm a teenager. What does that have to do with anything?
Well, I mean, if you fall into the category of one of those old people, are you going to take your oldman's life and get out of town?
Well, I'll be out of this town long before I ever become a senior citizen. I'll guarantee you that.
I think you've been saying that for a while.
Haven't you nearer?
Sure. I've been saying it for 22 and a half years and I'll say it again.
Broward County is an outdoor funeral parlor. That's right.
Yeah. All right. Second question.
The demographics here are skewed. They're upside down. This is not a real community.
You can't go to any other city in the world or real city.
A real metropolitan area and see such a disproportionate number of old people.
Not nowhere.
Question two.
Yes, sir.
And I'm not trying to beat you.
No, obviously not. Not after the first go part of the conversation. Obviously not.
You and your side.
I think you said such a great thinker. Yes.
I, you know, are obviously anti-religious. Very, very much so. Yes.
Very.
Okay.
Am I entitled to be on the air expressing that viewpoint?
Of course you are.
Okay. And I will.
Of course you are.
And I do.
But my question is.
Yes. Why then do you wear a Yamago?
Because it's a joke, sir.
And if you're too stupid to understand it, because it's a joke.
And if you don't get the, if you don't get the symbolism of it, then I can't help you.
I thought you said that I had taught you to think for yourself.
Gorners, tell him in your case, okay?
That's exactly why I wear it to point out how silly it looks and how ridiculous it is.
Got it. And you understand it.
No.
No, he doesn't get it.
But he's got the Dayton-broward backwards. So, you know, what can I say?
In addition to which I'm not wearing a skull cap anymore, I'm wearing a nice baseball cap now.
Maybe it's a postcard with a pregnant pole on there. Maybe it's this one.
That would be good. The one that says, would he be more careful?
It was him that was the God pregnant.
It says the rhythm method. It's not infallible. But then who is?
How do you like that? There's the pregnant pope. What a pregnant idea.
Either that or he just had one whale of a meal.
Maybe too much french food for the pope.
Maybe too many killed bosses, huh?
Maybe too many parogies there. Lots of Polish food.
They make you balloon up like a, like a mania, like a walrus.
Don't you love those pedantic old guys like this one?
The pedantic ones who top down to you, like they're so articulate and so on.
And then they turn out to be total bozos.
It's a joke, sir. The armaka is a joke. It's a satire. Do you understand what that means?
No. Okay, thank you.
Mobile in Miami. Hello?
Hello, meal. Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon, sir. I get kept me on hold for a damn long.
Hey, how you doing today?
Okay.
I would like some pressing engagement or something.
You like going anywhere?
I'd like to join your organization.
Yes? Organization?
I'd also like to sign up my two children and my wife.
I'd be more of us.
Yeah.
And came up to 6,000 now.
Thanks, Neil. You know you're the best.
Listen up.
I was flipping around the station last night, the TV.
And there was some guy, John Stoffel, you know the reporter.
He was on ABC. He was talking about John Assle.
Yeah.
There was talking about these people who were channelers.
They channeled other people from other worlds and all that.
Now this one guy and this one from Brazil had to hope so many people in the believing
that he was channeling some guy who was like two, three hundred year old.
And the guy who comes out of the house.
Yeah.
The guy would be in one room and he would be telling him the answers and the media
would be having them, these answers and these questions.
And it was so hilarious and when it came out that it was all host,
this was like maybe 10 years ago, maybe 10 years ago,
that these people still believed it.
They were sure we can't be.
It's just like the people that are still sending money to Jimmy Swagger.
That's right.
It was unbelievable how these people just were very believable.
Oh, it's very believable.
How these people just were like, they would say we do anything they could in the world.
Yeah.
To believe this guy and then they came out.
Well, let me tell you one thing.
Sure, just keep this in mind.
It's good for making money sometime in the future.
There's a lot of dummies out there.
Just keep going on.
One of the problems was, you know, was the media because nobody would take and investigate this guy.
And one of the things that they said that he did was that his part would stop when this guy channeled through him.
And the guy showed the trick or what they would do.
They would pull rubber ball on his rib.
And he would push it while his nurse was taking a pole.
And it stopped it.
It was such a joke.
It was so hilarious.
Well, anybody who believes that crap is definitely got rubber balls.
He deals with a heavy ester and closing.
Deal?
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
22 till 2 at 5.60.
L.
I'm heaven rake.
We're having sweet honey.
Oh, right.
Nothing much to do with that.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
I'm heaven rake.
All of them debts yes.
Who has been waving by light.
Going to serious.
Searing up we die.
All right.
Let's do it.
16 to 2.
And they did.
60.
How about some cool aid?
How come I let's go?
How about some of putting?
We have an open line and Dave won in Broward.
5.607.05.60.
We want bumper stickers.
We want buttons.
We want paraphernalia.
What?
What?
Hello?
Hello?
It was him.
Oh, but there you go.
Here's this great courageous old fart that's bugging George all day calling 10 million times.
The raggedy old voice is going to get me off the air and I should die for maybe the...
But he don't have the balls to go on the air.
Isn't that something?
You cowardly piece of turd.
Isn't that beautiful?
You turd.
Nice.
What does that tell you?
You know what it sounds like to me when you come right when you cut away all the bull crap?
You know what it sounds like?
He's an Ojón provocateur.
Exactly.
A crap disturbance.
Balls do you foul.
Don't want to go on the air and have all your good friends out there.
Both of them hear your voice and have you show an asshole you are to the universe.
Show your big fat ugly pimpley.
Rack them the world.
Dear field beach.
Where are you going?
Okay, let's go to that one.
Isn't that what it was?
Oh, that was just an asshole.
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing, sir?
I'm kind of like Woody.
Okay.
Good.
I agree with the 1000 percent on what you're talking about today.
Yes.
I got some, I think you'll find plenty.
I was just pulling on to the highway and I saw one of these big billboards.
Yeah.
See those signs from God.
And I haven't seen any of me.
I had a lot of calls about them and I read that thing on the paper.
I haven't seen any yet.
Well, one of them says I'll come out.
It says on commercial boulevard.
If you keep using my name in vain, I'll make your rush hour longer.
Yeah, I saw that.
Isn't that great?
Well, that's typical.
That's the kind of God the inventive.
He's a satist.
He likes making life miserable for God.
No, we'll pay for that.
Does God himself pay for that?
God has paid for it.
That's right.
He said, don't be trusted.
When he put up a bunch of billboards.
I thought I let you know that, Neil.
Okay. Thanks for the good news.
Thank you.
And bless you, my child.
Thank you.
Bless you.
We have an open line in Broward to invade.
They all come out.
All the good, religious, if you believe that way,
you're going to burn in hell.
All those good people.
And of course, that makes my point for me.
I love it.
Oh, seriously?
They make your point for you.
You're going to burn it, have you, evil, have you.
Right.
There you go.
Just like Tom Lear was singing before,
the Protestants and the Catholics and the Jews
and the Arabs and this one and that one.
I'll kill each other for thousands of years now.
And we still can't learn our lesson.
To just be people.
And DNH, do no harm.
And just leave everybody alone.
And stop teaching and breeding hatred
and intolerance and stupidity.
Because that's what it's all about.
Oh, but the good book says.
Yeah.
And who are disobedient children?
Surely be stoned to death.
Oi!
Can you imagine that today?
Can you imagine all the TV shows we could have on Earth?
We could make Wamy the Stoning Station.
Then they might get an audience.
All those bratty little kids that are doing all those evil things.
Just like every 15 minutes, we'll stoned another one to that.
It's right there on the channel or whatever it is.
Yeah, that's it.
Oh, God.
Now, that's a...
You don't waste any time with stones.
Because the kids are all stoned.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Enjoy the show.
It's a good discussion today.
I don't believe that man's born with the sense of a pumpkin
or you're calling a common sense.
He's not?
Am I questioning with the DNH?
He's not born with common sense?
No, I mean common sense or conscience is learned.
It's taught.
And that would be the role of religion is to be fine.
Let me ask you this question.
Do you ever have a dog in your life?
No, I have not.
But you've been around dogs, I'm sure.
Right, right.
Now, when you're around other people's dogs, for example,
do those dogs bite off your hand?
Not necessarily, no.
No, I don't mean not necessarily, but do they do it?
No.
No, they don't do that.
Do they attack you?
Do they rip your neck off?
Do they open up big gouges of bloody wounds in your body?
Well, some might try if they're brought up.
No, no, no.
We're talking about dogs that are in bread for that.
We're not talking about pitfalls.
I'm talking about your average ordinary dog.
No, they don't.
And why is that?
Because hopefully because they're upbringing from their owner.
No, no, no, no, no.
See, there is no.
You can't sit down and say to a dog,
because I have two dogs, have raised them since they were little puppies.
Okay?
You can't say to a dog, don't chew this guy's hand dog.
The dog instinctively knows certain things at birth instinctively
knows right from wrong.
Animals breed, right?
Does somebody teach animals the facts of life, the birds and the bees?
Of course not, because they know it instinctively.
But my point is they're certain things that are instinctive.
And they're the basic knowing right from wrong,
you don't have to read it in a book.
You know that if I have a car,
you don't take the keys and drive away with it.
That's common sense it has, and you're born with it.
Nobody has to teach you that.
So you it is because of your upbringing.
But let's do an example that's a little more not so clear.
You like to gamble right, you go to the track,
and you like to, as you call it,
plunge your brains out.
No, I don't plan to have my relics to gamble a little bit, yeah.
You have the means to do that.
Yeah.
Let's say a man with a family goes to the track
and spends his last hundred dollars that was supposed to go for groceries.
Now has he harmed his family when he went out?
Well, what does that have to do with what we're talking about?
Well, I'm saying it's somebody talking about a guy that's got a compulsive gambling habit.
No, it's not what he has a drinking habit.
What does that have to do with common sense?
You know, somebody has to define what harm is,
and that is the role the religion takes.
Religion defines all.
No, ruster, that is not the role religion takes.
That's the role that we all know.
Let me say to you again very clearly, read my lips,
that's the role the law takes.
That's the role of the law to define what's right from wrong, not religion.
Just like the Christian scientists, like this one over in Tampa a few days ago,
that let their little kid, two-year-old kid die after he got the beastings,
just like that disgusting thing.
That's not the role of religion,
and it's been overruled by the law in this country time and time again,
and hopefully always will be,
because just because people are crazy with their religious above the license and superstition
doesn't give them a right to do harm to their children.
You're right, but religion will, people who believe in the religious foundation of law,
will tell you that law came out of religion not the other way around.
And so you always have to have some defining set of rules and any of what religion,
sir.
Law came out of what religion?
Well, what, the think of mailings or the basis for all is what a Christian is.
Are they really all laws in the world came from the Ten Commandments?
How about the...
I love any answer.
Let me ask you this.
How did the Asians learn about the Ten Commandments?
Where was the Old Testament in Asia?
Well, I don't know.
I haven't been to church in three years,
so I'm just telling you,
no matter what,
I'm murder.
I'm murder.
I was murder, ever legal in Asia and Chinese or Japanese society was never legal
because they didn't know the Ten Commandments.
So somebody defined in their society that they knew?
Somebody defined it, but how could they possibly define it unless it was just common sense?
I don't know the answer to that, but what I'm telling you is people are going to tell you.
Well, how can we ever come?
Sir, how can we have a conversation?
I'm trying desperately, especially with people who disagree with me.
I'm trying desperately because I'm seeing...
I'm not disagreeing.
I'm just telling you that you will have to know how to respond.
You won't answer my questions.
You have to define harm, and you can't define what harm is to everybody and say,
and everybody agrees.
So that's where...
Well, let me ask you this.
Where is the great area by doing harm to another person?
Where is the great area?
Because what's harmful to you because of your upbringing in your background?
Sir, just a minute.
You're talking about people with compulsive gambling problems.
Oh, it's not.
But to the gambler,
does he see that that's harmful?
No, maybe not.
Of course he does when he goes home and he can't pay his bills and his family is starving to death.
Of course he does.
And that's exactly what I'm saying.
Do no harm.
If he's harming his family, if he's harming his family, what is it?
So you, that's how it's done.
It's because the gambler who's compulsive, it's not.
No, he knows that.
Sir, you're wrong.
He knows it.
When he goes back and he keeps getting deeper and deeper.
Sir, you don't want...
Do you want to have a conversation because you make no sense?
Do no harm.
And when you're harming yourself or other people, if you want to harm yourself,
that's your own business, I guess.
Well, when it affects other people, that's harm.
It's not some big, great area that we have to have a God then committee on and have a big discussion about.
Very, it's common sense.
Not complicated.
152.
But again, they got that 12-step program, so he'll be all right.
Eight minutes.
Probably, but obviously, you're right.
Oh, this guy's not worth the worth wasting time with.
I thought it was somebody like, you know, interesting.
This guy's not worth the way to know.
There's some older disgusting, decrepit piece of crap on the beach.
All I can say is, you turd.
Give me a break.
I didn't even let him on long enough to call you a thug.
I don't care about that, but this guy's worth the weight in the little online.
This guy's a hundred and a half days, got four feet in the grave this guy.
Jesus Christ, there's a baby's being put in dumpsters, this old fart's taken up space.
Dear field, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, 15 years ago in Montreal, it was a guy who had a radio program, a sports program called Ted Teven.
Yes.
All of a sudden, every time there was a Canadian talky game on, in between periods, some guy would fall out and start getting an analysis of the game.
You know what I got was Ron Rouge.
Well, let me tell you something.
Three months later, after six years on the air, Ted Teven gets fired and who takes his job, Ron Rouge.
Yeah.
I always job from him.
What does that have to do with?
I don't have no idea who that is.
But right here, all the federal Ron Rouge calling your program.
His Ron Rouge.
Which caller is Ron Rouge?
Ron Rouge is the guy who gives the hockey games.
Who gives the hockey games what?
Who analyzes the hockey games? Is he an answer, is he?
No, he's not. We don't have anybody here named Ron Rouge.
Not Ron Rouge, he's the other guy.
Yeah, okay. Whatever you say.
Go back to Montreal, okay, if you'll please.
Yeah, back to Shari.
Hope this guy up with the other one.
With the old Lunatic on the beach, man.
A match made in heaven.
Woo!
Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Give me a favor.
Forget all those guys.
Those guys are a bunch of punches and smuckers.
That guy from Miami Beach.
Neil, give me a favor.
Give me a little Larry King.
Here's our friend of yes, none. Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Yes, man.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Okay, I got one minute.
I've been very quickly.
Let me tell you why I'm an ex-nun.
Because if I had to teach one more child to hear
a Mario was going to scream.
And that's the reason why I got out of the content.
Because I couldn't, I really couldn't in conscience try and
take young minds and put them into that particular frame of mind.
So that's it.
Okay.
Okay.
Have a good one.
Bye-bye.
There's our friend, the ex-nun.
She got out of it because she knew what was a bad habit.
That's right.
And she got tired of shaving her headball too, by the way.
So anyway, that's going to do.
Do we have one call around here today that made any sense in the,
of course not.
D-N-H, we want bumper stickers.
We want pins.
We want signs.
We want billboards.
Do no harm, man.
No.
Very common sense.
Do no harm.
That's it.
That's our new deal.
Doesn't cost you a dime to join.
Don't have to rush to temple.
The church.
You don't have to pay any dues and fees.
Can I borrow money?
Any faith hevers?
What is it?
Hello?
Hey.
Neil.
Yes, Hank.
Oh, I got a story for you.
You'll love.
I got a call yesterday from a reporter in Las Vegas.
So you'll never guess who's out there buying up businesses.
What way?
What way do you think it's moving into Las Vegas?
The Gotti family.
No.
Goes south.
Not Wayne Hypinga.
Oh, yeah.
Wayne is buying up stuff in Vegas?
Auto dealerships and waste management companies.
Oh, my God.
Well, we'll have to look for a new place to go, I guess.
Used to be a fun joint.
Why not?
I'm going to use them as a contact.
Get comp.
Yeah.
There you go.
Yeah.
He'll give you a comp.
Remember the end of what was that movie where James Kong was in the...
James Woods was in the...
What's upon a time in America?
Oh, yeah.
He was in the garbage truck at the end.
Yeah.
I'll wind up with some hacked up hooker and some...
Rude side.
Wind up a problem.
Old did head.
That's right.
Unbelievable.
So you'd like that one.
So when's the deal going to be finalized?
When's he making the deal?
I don't know.
They called me and asked me to check on her from this end.
You know, that they had heard out there, that they had been seen out there.
And was seen in the company of Steve Wynn.
Yeah.
And that he was looking to acquire...
Oh, no, no.
By the way, if he's acquiring auto dealerships out there, that's...
Yeah.
...that's something different from what he's been doing in other states.
Well, maybe the good news is that means he's getting out of here.
Wouldn't that be great?
Not a...
He doesn't do it.
Oh, you mean he moved the family out west?
Why?
So who gets...
Oh, my God.
You finally gave us a ray of hope.
He's going to move pick up the whole damn thing, move out there.
He's going to...
Because we know he wants to unload the Panthers.
He's already got the Marlon deal basically done.
He gets rid of the Panthers and then the Dolphins be after that.
No, he keeps the Dolphins.
But maybe he could leave the Panthangeles behind, you know, just to look after.
Frank, he's Panthangeles.
There you go.
He's small potatoes, just like Wayne.
Okay.
Thanks for the good news, Hank.
All right.
Okay.
And thanks, by the way, for pointing me the hell out of our pizza lot,
and we did a great job.
We had a beautiful turnoff.
Yeah, I'm going to do it.
Hank's coming up next, and then we got...
What do we got?
The Booster at 6, and we got the Big Ball game that I should be one way
out of a pitching series, Sandiego, Atlanta 745.
You are on a hot summer day.
Me and the Mrs. Always Stop the Dickens.
Dickens Fruit State.
They've got everything from fruit to vegetables, homemade pies.
But there is nothing like their cider.
They can't ride honey.
Uh-huh.
Dickens cider.
Yes, sir.
Why, even though we were late for church last Sunday,
she had to have a little dick inside her.
She says there ain't nothing like it.
Even my minister says his wife enjoys a little dick inside her.
Hey, why don't you bring some home and our protective plastic rib bottle?
That way you'll stay fresh.
Or you can let it sit awhile and have some hard dick inside her.
Hard.
It's good at lunch, good at dinner, and there's nothing like waking up with a dick inside her.
Dickens Fruit State.
Just to our fruit 9W and country road 69.
Open 24.
Because after a chillish summer night,
I like to snuggle up in bed with a dick inside.
We bring.
Well, this morning with our ball popped out of there.
I didn't use this, but it's one of my weaverisms like a wet water melon seed.
Oh, I like them in high speed.
We had Rick weaver on speed during the little warm-up session here before.
And he was a hell of a lot better, too, by the way.
And a running box.
There you go.
I'm turning the cracks in the big hole.
Ha ha ha ha.
All right.
Hey, listen, if you were as old as this car machine,
you'd be having a little bit of a technical problem, too.
Okay, it's one of those things.
Nothing we can do about it.
I've got a story about the Amandal bread murders that's going to be coming up in a minute or two.
Oh, yeah, you've heard similar stories on this show on the past,
but this one that takes the cake, if I can use that expression.
By the way, I want to go back in my word, which wouldn't be the first time,
because I always reserve that option in the case things change.
Yesterday, I said I would never mention Manny, whatever, unless you're...
He's an asshole.
Over at Whammy and that whole business again.
I just want to say this for the ten people at my watch that show.
The reason you're seeing old rehashed reruns is because that's what they're putting on,
because Manny Lushum has decided that we're not going to put on the stuff,
because we've got these Amsterdam postcards that I've got on my cat that I'm wearing on my head right now.
That's already been on the air, by the way, many, many times, with the joints,
and the one that's stuck up here on a mic stand.
So being a hard ass and also...
He's an asshole.
He, and of course having no conversation with me whatsoever.
We tried, we put in a call to him two days ago.
Rob Kaplan stood right here.
We dialed up the number.
We got the station.
We got Whammy on the phone.
And did he ever call us back?
No.
Did he call me at home?
No.
Did he call me this morning?
Has there been any discussion with Mia with any of the operational on people over there about this?
No.
Did they care about the near-large and needle at night on Whammy?
No.
Obviously not, because they're just still willing,
because of him being a hard ass, about what I don't know.
What is the big issue here?
Has he told us?
No.
Has he told me anything?
No.
But they're willing because they just don't care.
They just don't give a crap.
Which is the Florida way.
How do you like that?
We don't give a crap.
We don't care if we put a recent show on,
an old show or show from one to years ago,
because we're going to blow that thing out anyway.
So I just thought I'd mention that to you.
So if you're wondering how come you're scratching your head
and you're wondering how come you're not seeing on a Whammy show,
the stuff that we're talking about here in the radio,
that's the reason why.
Good morning.
Get my Newsweek magazine in the mail yesterday.
This is always comforting.
When you buy your magazine in the mail and it says,
the crash of 99, the crash of 99.
Oh my God.
In black.
On the front cover of this week's Newsweek,
economy at risk and Japan took a big overnight.
And the European markets are taking a big right now.
And the Dow is down 111.
And the NASDAQ is down 63.
All you drecking tech stocks for, you got real problems.
And what are they doing today?
The House is going to be voting on whether she's
to proceed with them.
Peachment hearings.
There you go.
That's what we're worried about is blow jobs at the White House.
The world economy is going to hell on a hand basket.
And what is the United States government worried about?
The Congress is worried about blow jobs in a White House
and people don't want to talk about it.
And don't think it's a good idea for it to leak out.
Everybody's like, Scorch-Corch and it up.
Get a gigantic colostomy bag for the Congress
because they've got a real serious leak.
Scorch-Corch problem.
Maybe you want to send you an Allison up there.
She could be doing a business handover wrist.
Oh, and also Ray Reki before I get into my
Mondle bread story, which is going to take a couple of minutes.
Ray Reki, and I didn't even know he listened to this show
because Ray Reki, to me, is, you know, not a bad guy.
He's just boring.
He writes this real terminal column in the Sunsendle.
Usually about his kid went off to school, very parochial,
very Yahoo.
Something he might read in the candidate
when messenger newspaper.
I always see what, but I always see what,
the columnists are writing about just in case
there might be something of interest there
or something that they're ripping off for me,
which in this case, he is.
Right out of this show, almost verbatim word for word.
Nice going, Ray.
Bad name is hurt, but fists don't, he says.
Let me get this straight.
If you're a player in the National Hockey League,
it's all right to put your opponent's shirt up over his head,
rendering him defenseless, then pummeling with your fists.
In fact, it's almost expected if players didn't regularly fight
punch-kick, scratch, and gouge one another,
attendance at NHL Games and doubtfully would take a severe punch.
But if a player insults an opponent's race or national origin,
everybody comes outraged.
What's that about, he says?
Have we become so politically correct that we're now mentally deficient?
Has common sense really become that uncommon?
I'm afraid so, Ray.
I'm not going to read the rest of the yoke,
but I got an excellent point, which is the one I made yesterday.
And the day before, and that is you got hockey players
who are out there doing life threatening,
and in some cases damaging injury to each other.
I have a continuing diminishing respect for each other's physical safety.
And nobody does anything about that.
They talk a good game, they're going to do something,
but they don't really think about that.
And then this Peter Whirl incident,
which they continue making a big thing about it,
he's Darcy Tucker from Tampa,
spent 20 minutes on the phone with him the other day,
saying, I never said any of those things,
and Will Rell said, I know you didn't.
I didn't hear anything.
And Peter Whirl does never problem with this,
but they want to make another big song in a dance
because it's politically correct.
He's, he called him a, uh,
and he called him a, yeah, right.
Oh, yeah.
And of course, the fact that he might have speared him in the head
or poked an eye out or something like that.
Well, don't worry about that, that's part of the game.
That's okay, right?
Yeah!
That's right, makes you more macho.
Let me do the break.
But correction, okay?
You do believe it, essentially,
because I'm so out of whack, I'm whacked out.
I'm out of balance.
So thanks a lot, Mon,
the monologue bread was great.
Oh, yeah.
Don't ever do that again.
Can you believe that?
Yeah, you can believe it.
And of course, there would be a lot of the niles,
but you do understand that subconsciously,
there are people trying to make sure that you stay fat.
This has been going on my whole life.
There are people who want to make sure you stay fat and sick.
And it goes on, and it goes on,
just like yesterday.
Jeff Cohen comes in here with 5,000 pounds of food.
Didn't I say I'm not eating anything because I'm going to go out
of my mother's for lunch today?
What was that food doing in here yesterday?
And I told him not to be pregnant.
Didn't we pack that place on Tuesday night and make him a lot of money?
And have a way, and didn't he sit there at the table with our gold thing?
And coherently talking about the fact that during the summertime,
I was the only one,
and the only time his business was slow,
was the seven months I was off the year.
Didn't he go on a great length about that?
But I've made this man tons of money.
I'm talking about this for years on a year,
and people, oh gee, here he goes on this again.
But you know something?
It's a matter of trying to stay alive.
And it's not easy.
It's almost impossible to stay alive,
because they've got all these people out there trying to kill me.
With kindness, with sugar, with vandal bread.
You have to be certifiable to give a bottle of booze to an alcoholic,
and this is no different.
No different.
There are people on death row for crimes less than giving a big container of pure sugar,
or whatever it is.
Cookies, cakes, vandal bread, pies, pastries,
to a diabetic, a compulsive sugar eater,
who's now sitting here watching that number,
they're out of control.
There it goes.
Yeah, oh, geez.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I'm hanging on by a thread.
Jesus!
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6.
Out of these natives today or not, do you think so?
No!
Probably not, that's okay.
If you're like you're spending too much money on...
I've got the college game of the year, right here!
It's UM against Florida State, live from the Ornville.
Game starts at 3.30, right here on sports radio, 5.60, QAM.
I got out of here, the whole new year of crimes.
Fun.
Yes, sir.
You know, you're obviously a very intelligent man,
but the problem that I think that's going on is partially
that you're not exercising to burn off some of that sugar.
You can eat some of that food, but why do you want to kill yourself like this?
The exercise, I understand what you're saying.
Exorcism has got nothing to do with your blood sugar.
Not that fast.
Once you get all that sugar in your system,
your blood sugar starts soaring when you're diabetic.
All right, but you start to sooing up.
You're not listening to what I just said.
You can't touch that.
You cannot put it in your mouth.
I understand that part, but what is the obsession
of wanting to kill yourself, though?
I don't.
What you do.
You're eating that fish food and everything else.
That's right. Good point.
So the fact that matter is, I mean, it looks like you want to commit suicide.
Do you think it's a psychological thing that I really have a death wish?
Do you think that could be it?
Personally, I like you a lot, you know that.
But over the years, I know that.
That's what you've been doing.
You really, you know, maybe it's time you start seeking help in a way.
What do you suggest you do it yourself every day?
You go on.
Kill myself.
Kill myself.
You kidneys have to be killing.
You sowed as your liver.
What's your liver function reading?
All my tests are great.
Really?
Yeah.
Your cholesterol level?
What's that reading?
206.
Really?
And then that's from the Atkins that you, you know.
What, my cholesterol?
Yes, that's it.
No, it's from the Pravicle.
I'm taking to keep it down.
Well, I mean, look what you're doing yourself.
You're taking so many pills.
Right.
All this crazy stuff.
Pills from my blood pressure.
Pills from my blood sugar.
Pills from my cholesterol, right?
I mean, don't you think it's time to get your back home?
No, I think it's time to start changing your regime.
I mean, it's not your regime?
Yeah.
The way you're going right now, this is...
Well, no, no, no, I understand what you're saying.
And I do a lot of my own picking out on my own.
But I guarantee you, I'd probably weigh at least 20 pounds less.
And I'm not trying to blame anybody else.
But I'd probably weigh 20 pounds less if it weren't for the unwanted stuff that I'm allergic to
that I just pick out on that people stick in front of my pussy.
But you have more...
I bet.
I have no willpower.
Fat people don't have willpower.
None.
We don't.
I was once fat too, but most of us have to, you know,
your body fat alone is higher than the average person because of the fact that you don't move around a lot.
My body fat is...
You can't even count that high.
They don't have numbers that astronomical.
So why not try something different for you?
Right.
Such as...
How about trying to walk around the block a couple of times?
I mean, start somewhere.
Walk around the block?
Yeah, try something for your cardiovascular.
You need help.
Okay, I'm going to start.
All right, look, I mean, make a lot out of the block right now.
I'm going to start.
No, I'm sure I just got through Sam.
I'm going to do it right now.
Look, no, you're a very nice guy.
Nobody would like to see you go just a good way.
Sure they would.
They would love to see me cook right here on the year we get a 90's year with that.
Neil.
That Maddie Lesher would probably put that on the day in Miami again.
This town wouldn't know what to do without you.
You know that.
I mean, it's sad to say this, but I think really you need to start seeing somebody regarding this problem.
I need serious help.
You're getting worse, man.
You're right.
Bye bye, Neil.
Thank you so much.
Okay, I need serious help.
I'm raising my hand.
Is there anybody out there willing to help a man who's star is killing himself with sugar?
No.
And start.
No.
And food.
No.
Karen Carpenter killed herself with no food.
I'm killing myself with all the wrong food with too much crap.
In fact, when he stick me in the ground and put on the tombstone, they can just put a eight too much crap.
That's it.
Right there on the tombstone.
He was killed with...
I wanted it.
No, not that.
He was killed.
That's right.
We have an open line that's been powered to and date 56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line.
I mean, he got was very nice, very concerned.
And it sounds very simplistic, doesn't it?
Do you know how many fat?
The number of fat people in this country is increasing by the minute.
The low fat...
scam.
Total scam.
Fatter and fatter and fatter.
And the fact is that like I said yesterday, which I know it's a boring topic, but it's a truth.
Sugar and the starch are killers for millions of people.
You can't touch them.
You can't eat them.
Did I go there with the empty do I ever eat dessert in my mother's house?
No.
Do I ever ask for cakes or...
Nobody cooks better this stuff than my mother in the world.
But do I ever want it or do I ever touch it?
Do I ever dance? Of course not.
And now because my good friend Cheryl was there in an outplayment her,
don't go blame in her, but of course because she was there, that wasn't excuse.
Let's whip out the old sugar and start cooking up like a storm, making a bunch of crap.
Making up a bunch of crap.
Was there any doubt in anyone's mind that I would eat most of that on a way home?
No.
There was no... when she gave it to me, there was no doubt in my mind.
Way back in the recesses of what used to be my brain.
Here's a call from Homestead. Hello.
Oh.
Yes sir.
Something wrong with the phone when I called in.
Okay call me back. Call us back.
Yara phone, you know something?
We're getting dicked in Dave County on his phone says I'm telling you about right now.
We got a crappy phone system to begin with and somebody with Bell South.
I'm going to tell you right now we're going to bring in Shilok Holmes and everybody.
Ross P. Row, Colombo.
We're going to have a major investigation what's going on with our phone lines here.
Somebody's dicking with our phone system here.
We said here yesterday and watched those three day lines simultaneously.
Remember that? All at the same time.
Is there any chance that that's possible?
No.
Of course not.
Just click they all just vanished at the same time.
People get in cut off because somebody's dicking with our day lines.
Or maybe the whole goddamn phone system but especially the day line.
You're not fooling us, okay?
Probably my good friend Larry and Mixon over there, Bell South knows something about this.
5667-0560, 05-560 on the AT&T line.
All the day lines are open as usual but I don't want to blame the audience for that.
See this is the game that they like to get you into.
But guess what?
We're having a deep pressure man.
I'm going to come in every single day and take that big fat paycheck
because cash is where it's at.
Let's see if it's any better.
You back?
Hey Neil.
That's better.
Yeah, some funny happened didn't it?
Yeah, somebody's dicking with our day lines.
Okay, I'll give it a dick insider.
Listen.
I'm one that's been on interest.
Full crap, yeah.
Yeah, it's full crap.
Sorry.
The point is, I've been on this program for over three years.
I still crave sugar.
But I tried to make my son, I had a friend that died about 30 years young.
You died?
You died?
Yeah, you died from drinking booze and it made me aware of my health and my blood sugar
was 300 when we checked it.
Jesus.
My blood pressure was up to 200 plus.
And I got any act in the program, blood sugar slowly got down.
Now it's normal for the last two years.
What is it?
For me, I can't see it works for everybody because nothing works for everybody.
It works for me and I can't do it.
I had the same thing, listen, believe me.
What I had to do was discipline my cell handful and that's what it means.
The stashios and the shell and I just eat them.
I found out that if I just stay away from all the sweet people who don't have these cravings
and these problems and these additions, they can't relate to it.
And this is just silly, these people are weak.
It's an addiction, it's no different from alcoholism or drugs or any other damn addiction.
You're on the bone, I listen, the other thing is I've stayed on and I found out that my cravings have decreased.
I still have.
Yeah.
Periodically, I have to go on a whipped cream done.
I hate it when you talk about allergy and it has a secret.
You got to get that out of your mind.
You honestly got to.
I know that.
I think I got to go back and see my friend Bertann and get hypnotized again.
Don't taste it, don't taste it.
He's doing great, I saved his life.
I saved his life.
I saved the announced landing ladies life, which we don't hear from her anymore by the way.
Saved her life, she told us that.
She was great.
She did the last couple times I saw her.
But I can't save my own life.
I'm like the scientist who comes up with this great cure that cures the right.
