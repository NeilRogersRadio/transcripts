make the president look bad and we even have to spectacle of a majority of the
Republicans voting not to even release the votes by which we voted today.
The Republicans insisted on keeping secret the proceedings in which they were
open. They're for opening to about everybody for themselves. It is the
disappointment that is because it is not only partisan but it is not a
process of trying to get into fact-finding or defining impeachment. It's
basically an effort to discredit the president. This is Chairman Hyatt this
year now. Well this is a no-planned war. I don't think things were as
dismal as Barney portrayed them. We accomplished a lot. We have big
land-ringled parties. It was civil. I would say the spirit of bipartisan
ship is alive. There was a general view among the Democrats not to reveal
anything and there was a general view among Republicans to reveal as much as
possible consistent with responsible redactions to protect people who
are the names of those pictures. I'll go ahead and put a nistics in the
involved. In this was very peripheral. We're going with the white on. We did that.
I'll go ahead and tell you. We don't want to hear it. Makes me sick of my stomach.
Nice going Henry. Go steal somebody else's wife. It's 11.55 at five. What did I tell you?
Remember several days ago when he and John Conier's run. Oh this is going to be
more partisan. It's not going to be political. Right. We believe that. Everything is
about fairness and justice in America. There's no such thing about political
partisanship is there.
We're on a tour of the old world place and when they were crewy-eiled by a face and he said no
word.
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No

Oh, yeah.
So there's the 20, 400 pages of the testimony that they're going to release and also the video
tape and date with Al Goldstein, whatever else you want.
That's all coming out.
And of course, we all know that it's nonpartisan, but the bad news is for those of you real
perverts out there with no lives that they've removed all the extra salacious parts.
That's right.
They've all been de-dacted.
They've all been taken out.
It would like a big, heavy magic market, you know, a real, big, black one, a big, black
magic market name, Ben.
So all of people, I mean, who the hell's going to read that?
They didn't want anything in there.
There was more salacious than was with the original report last week.
And how'd Al could anything be more graphic than that, huh?
I mean, maybe the salacious part was about what brand the cigar was, huh?
Maybe we had an actual picture of the...
Maybe we had the pictures of the cigar droppings and scrapings and the peelings and stuff like
that.
But that won't be in there, damn it.
Here's Miami with 200 question marks.
Hello?
Neil God.
Yes?
How are you, Neil?
Okay.
Listen, I'm a Julio Born and raised here in Miami, so I know it really wasn't much of
a hockey fan.
Yeah.
But when the Panthers went to that run a couple years ago, doing the head of the runs,
yeah, after that, I jumped on the bandwagon.
But my true love is football and if you can, okay, hang on.
Okay, boy, I never thought we'd give these damn things away.
I think the football people are upset just because I said football talk is boring.
Well, it is.
I mean, it's not as boring as that Dolphin Bill's game last week.
Nothing could be more boring than that.
Even eating vanilla ice cream is more stimulating than watching that game.
That was pathetic.
I really was.
It was sad.
Anybody that tries to make a big song of dance about that performance, you know, a rookie
quarterback out there, there's like peeing in his pants and just terrible, just awful.
And nobody able to do much of anything just back and forth and nothing happening.
I'll kick a field goal.
Here we go again.
Same old tired, boring stuff.
So I mean, listening to people talk about something that was boring in the first place
can't really be all that stimulating.
Can it?
No.
I don't think so.
But hey, who are my?
I mean, that, you know, we got ourselves consoling in here.
We don't want to say that it's boring.
It's exciting.
Is all hell.
Do you believe me?
Here's the call in Davy.
Hello.
Good morning, you.
Yes, sir.
How are you today?
Great.
So now I spoke with you a little bit earlier in a week.
I'm a little bit out of material, but I, it looks like I'm a little, a little late.
I want to take my kid to the game Sunday, but you're out of tickets.
To what game?
To the Dolphin game.
Yeah.
No more tickets.
Oh.
I have to be honest with you.
Okay.
I have another pair, by the way, but he ain't going to get him.
Isn't that something he still doesn't want to talk to me this guy?
This, I don't give tickets to people who just call up.
I mean, what kind of a show is that?
I'm trying to create a little bit of creativity.
I've been doing this for a hundred years, at least force you to come up with something
to say, to talk about an opinion, a comment, anything, an observation.
Even some...
If he wants me to sing God Bless America and paste these into G string up here, I'll do it.
Something not original, you know?
But this guy, like he wants to take his kid to the game, go to the game.
I'm sure there's going to be tickets.
That, by the way, is that game sold out?
Do we know?
I have no idea.
No.
I haven't been following that.
Is the game sold out?
In other words, is the blackout been lifted since it's already Friday and we ought to
know the answer to that?
How about Joe?
Does Joe know the answer to that?
Is the game sold out?
I don't know, but we'll find out.
How could we not know?
You know, just don't on me here at Friday, the game is Sunday.
What does our sports section say, okay?
Let's get that Harold's sports section.
They would never lead us down to wrong path, would they?
Yeah, they might.
Let's see.
Where is the...
Let's find some football stuff.
Let's get rid of this baseball stuff.
I know that's where the exciting stuff's going on right now.
But let's get some football.
Come on, look at them football.
Where are we going?
Mitchell, not too happy up there in Detroit and we need to sorry about this.
Come on.
Marino believes in a wide receiver because that's all they got to talk about is he's
got to find more wide receivers.
All very jackass.
Marlins may be going to Channel 69.
That'll solve our problem by the way if we get the heat end of Marlins on there in
69.
We'll never be on anyway.
Which very, of course, is salivating because that nighttime programming on Whammy, he
says is averaging a 0.5 for the prime time programming in August.
And the numbers must be solo.
We don't even get them anymore.
You notice that?
Didn't even give us the numbers anymore.
We used to have the squiggly lines.
Now we've got like minus the squiggly lines.
In other words, less than nothing.
That's okay.
We're kicking some serious ass.
Oh, we're not.
Where the hell is the footwear?
Is this story here?
Where is the deal?
What kind of a goddamn newspaper is this?
Don't they usually have a thing on gators?
We don't care about gators.
We want to know about it.
We got a professional football team play.
And here, at least they fact similarly thereof.
Where is the stuff coming up?
Where is the usual summary they have about the game and how many tickets available?
Where you're going to see it?
Where you're going to hear it right here?
Here we go.
What does it say?
Uh, Sunday's highlights, television.
It says right here four and 12 Steelers and dolphins one o'clock.
The game has been sold out since Monday.
It will be.
What did I tell you?
See, I just, just as you said that, just before that, just barely beat you in the punch,
but thank you.
The game has sold out.
So these damn last two tickets we got to give away here are like gold, like pure platinum.
Oh, that's where they're going to be playing at pure platinum.
So this last guy that just called in, I wanted tickets for him and his son.
That's called me early in the week.
They just keep sucking around, sucking around.
You can't do it that way, sir.
It does not work.
And I'm desperate to give these tickets away because whoever gets them is going to have
to come and pick them up here like in the next two or three hours.
And we don't have a lot of time to deal around.
This is a sold out game in a very frenzyed sports town.
Isn't it a very frenzy?
No.
Well, here's Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Great.
I'll listen.
I want to do your favor.
I want to take those two tickets.
Oh, okay.
Here's a mobile in four lottery.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
He's here.
They're hearing his impaired.
What is it?
Oh, what is it, sir?
I had a comment.
What if Hillary was cheating on Bill when he was out of town?
What if they found out about that?
Wouldn't that be his anger?
Yeah, that would be his anger.
Okay, here's a mobile in four lottery.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I'd like to wish you a nice vacation and a safe return.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
And if you want, you can give me those two tickets.
Okay, let's go to a call, Gables.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
How you doing?
Okay, sir.
First of all, two things besides the tickets.
Hi.
What would have happened a while back?
Oh, Henry.
Yeah.
What would have happened before if he got caught 30 years ago?
Would he have gone to the present, said, oh, I've sent...
I know.
You have to ask him.
And the second thing...
I'm going to cover it up since he lied about being married.
You told this bra that he wasn't married.
What would happen if he was taken by Hager right now?
Yeah.
What do you see him?
They're just now, I think he probably needs it.
Okay, thank you, sir.
We have an open line in day 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
This is called an exercise in satism, and I enjoy it.
I like it a lot.
You challenged him to come up with something.
Just a little something, not cold, not platinum, just a little something.
Sorry, can't do it, Sally.
Hey, when you're looking to make your next election morning.
Man, three days.
Oh, man.
We're throwing up the more before 6th day in them.
I'm doing three.
Yeah, like the army, right?
The first team, weekday more, 4th radio, 5'60, QAM.
Oh, god.
And now, the sound of Pamela Lee, breastfeeding on the set of Baywatch.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, it's good.
Listen, we're just up Pamela.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, it's good stuff.
From 14 to 5'60, WQM.
Maybe that's not possible on it, Joe.
Oh, George, I'm sorry.
So at any rate, you know, Rimmer with that terminal call of his before, he forgot to mention
the most important thing that not only is the big thing tomorrow, the Panther hockey
fest, but that everything is free except the food which will be half price.
Oh.
How do you like that?
I mean, they're not going to be given the food away.
We like the Rascal House, but it's going to be half price at the arena tomorrow at the
Macarena.
So that's something you should have been talking about, but he left that out.
And you think if anybody would be priced conscious about food, he'd be the guy, but.
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How's your calling?
How's my calling?
Long time with the first time call.
Yes, sir.
I wouldn't know if you could play that if I asked you something for me.
And also, how about this dolphin ticket?
OK, there.
Excuse me, I'm lighting my cigar, OK?
And it tastes pretty good.
Yeah, that was good, sir.
That was brilliant.
That was excellent.
Not always you want to request and the tickets, but he's got nothing to say.
That was a double, double, dummy.
Oh, sorry.
Here's a lady in North Miami.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
OK.
I want to wish you nice vacation.
Thank you.
And tell you, I didn't like your show before, but I've enjoyed it thanks to my husband.
Yeah.
And how about those tickets?
OK, we have an open line today, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60, and see.
You know something?
Some people think, boy, this is a real waste of time.
Oh, this is excellent.
This is like a seminar, especially today, be when I'm going on vacation.
This is perfect, because this shows you why most of the time we see here begging for some kind of a meaningful call.
Something intelligent, something amusing, something entertaining, something to piss you off.
Anything of substance.
Because they have nothing to say here.
They have absolutely nothing to say.
They figure if they call and do a real quick suck job, that's it.
I don't want a suck job quick or drawn out.
All depending.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
You said you had a day that perjury, the him lying in the, in his deposition is not perjury, correct?
That what?
The him lying in his deposition.
Why not not open?
It's not constant with perjury.
That is correct, sir.
Why is it that isn't going, they're going out to him because of perjury because he was lying?
Well, sir, let me say it again.
Lying under oath doesn't automatically concentrate the perjury.
Look it up in the book.
Turn out one of the talking heads and listen to them discuss it, because I think it's a little beyond your grasp.
He's grasping it.
We have an open line in date, 566, 705, 60, pound 560 on the mobile one line.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
My God.
How are you doing, man?
Okay.
Just to press pants or fan calling here.
Just trying to get your opinion on the, on the, on the arena of the very, very top seats, the nosebleed.
Would you have been to know how good the seats are from them?
There, there's no problem.
There's no obstructed view, you'll see fine.
You won't need the binoculars.
It's great.
Unfortunately, you know, no bad seats in the house.
You mentioned the stockles here in Miami, but I think we all got it from Wayne.
He's the biggest one from all along.
Sports slept kind of for those nice seats in the bottom, man.
But just like that, if you feel as often thick as it's possible.
We have an open line in the date, 566, 705, 60, pound.
I want to give them away.
I mean, badly, I'm desperate to give them away this hour.
I am Jones in to give them away.
In fact, I'm never going to do that thing with the ninth caller we're getting.
I'm not doing that.
That's too easy.
Because it requires no effort on their part other than to be just dial a number.
What do you get a reward for dialing a number?
I'm never going to do that again.
I'm going to put them through the ringer.
If you want something, earn it.
We're not asking you to get on your hands and ease and look at anybody's ass.
Just asking for a little herbal intercourse here.
Very weak, a weak performance that just shocks the heart.
I mean, you believe that?
No.
No, of course not.
I've had a lot of practice with this.
Here's a mobile in sunrise.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm here.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, you see a New York with a giant game on Monday.
All the big Jews in New York is very upset.
Yeah, because they don't rush your shine.
Because the mixes up, they said they should play the game with there's no Jews.
Oh, yeah.
Like Cincinnati.
Yeah, Cincinnati, Tennessee, Carolina.
Yeah, that would be good.
Perfect.
You know, someplace like that.
Right.
And, you know, the whole of the Jews are very upset.
Do you think that they're going to put their God first or football first?
Oh, definitely.
The giant fans will be there.
They'll be there.
Yep.
Okay, I don't need to take it that way.
Good.
Thank God.
God bless you.
How do you like that?
They got some nerve.
It goes to show you what a glacier country this is.
They're playing a football game.
A Monday night game on Russia.
Shona.
Boy, that is unacceptable.
I mean, next thing they're going to be wearing their Yomakaside saddle over there.
They're over their forehead.
You know what I'm saying?
Let's show a little bit of God damn respect out there.
Will you please?
You know, this bill, McCullum, if they don't get him off of there,
I'm going to start getting really upset.
I argue that we think what's been done is right.
Get him off my air now.
This Yahoo from Florida.
Is there any other kind?
No.
Jesus.
Get him off that screen.
He's just on there.
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.
He's been hogging his thing since he's over at Hagen Daz's where he is.
Give him one of those caramel, brittle crunch bars and see if he sticks it in his...
Rackum, pipe and smoke.
Here's a Davy.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
And Neil, what's up?
How you doing?
Okay.
I just got back from Buffalo.
Uh-huh.
I just want to know what's going on.
Okay, we have an overline in Broward.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the mobile one.
I just got back from Buffalo.
I want to know what's going on.
Not too much, bro.
Let's go to a homestead.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
You got Cookie Roberts on Channel 10 and the video.
You won't watch that.
We got lunch coming.
I don't want to see her.
Oh, you might puke.
But the president's testimony on tape is going to come out.
Nope kidding.
They're going to release it.
I just got through and giving you that 25 minutes ago.
We had it right here as it happened, but thank you very much.
We have an open line in day 5, 6, 7, and guess what?
The president had a bowel movement.
Not necessarily today, but sometime.
This guy's calm to give us a bulletin.
They're releasing the tapes in the other 2400 pages.
Surfer he had been listening to your radio, which is the important thing.
Forget about Cookie Roberts.
Forget about those goyema Channel 10.
Get with the program.
We have these people very poorly potty trained.
I'll tell you that.
Man.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Miami.
Yes, I'm calling.
I want to Monica's number there.
There's nothing.
No, okay.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Hey, we're all right.
Yeah.
A big fan of yours, Neil.
But I have a question for you.
You're obviously a vocal, vocal critic of organized religions, correct?
Yes.
Okay.
But you continue to wear the monolucle when you're on the radio station there.
Why is that?
Because it's a joke.
Oh, we're not this way, but I don't get the joke then.
You don't get the joke?
No.
You don't get the joke that it looks silly.
You don't understand the point.
Yeah, you get it.
Get out of here.
Goy.
We have an open line in day 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16,
0, 5, 6, the end of mobile one line.
He doesn't get it.
That's a problem with this down.
They don't get it.
You have to hold up a billboard.
You see this?
I've got it over my like here.
Like I put up my glasses falling down my push.
Is that got something to do with religion?
No.
Can't out of here already, will you?
You got to explain them.
Not on.
Well, I mean, that's just different things that's not...
Do you know what?
Can't you just get...
What we do?
Yes, yes it is.
There's a lot of different things that's in a Masonic.
Um...
Order.
Yeah.
Like mumbo combo, yeah.
Why is that?
I mean...
Well...
And you do that like blood oath that you take?
What a thing is, there's something...
I'm sure you remember the trial letter will commission
because if so, we're going to have to trace this call.
I understand what you're saying.
Yeah, right.
That's...
It says right into manual.
That's always the response.
I don't understand what you're saying.
Isn't that what Nixon said?
I can't recall.
I don't understand what you're saying.
No, no.
Are we tracing this call?
We tracing it?
Uh-huh.
Good.
Sir?
Okay.
Yes.
I'm listening.
No, what I'm saying is...
What are you saying?
I don't know.
I don't know where you're getting your information from.
I'm asking you how did you come up with it?
How do I come up with what?
With what you say?
I've done shows on the Masonic.
I've seen your secret book there, your secret handbook.
I know all the ins and outs of that Mason book.
How do you know that that book is actually a Mason book?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is right on the cover.
It says, this is the emis.
You know what that means, sir?
Hi.
What I'm saying is...
You know what that means?
What I'm saying today and put something on it, that doesn't mean it is.
So what's the point?
What's the point?
I've got a lot of people in the freeload to take it to your hockey me a china with a license.
With a lot of nil, nil, uh, uh, uh, just a life of nil Ross.
Yeah.
Is it?
Okay.
And with that mean, that that that person likes it?
First of all, there's no blacks allowed in the Mason's anyway.
So you're giving me a bunch of below-no-no.
You're not a Mason.
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, we have an open line in Broward, 5667-0560, and pound 560 on a mobile one line.
That was great.
I was going, man.
There we go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I could have, we could have cut that sure, but we've been nearly as entertaining.
Yeah.
We be, we be in the Mason's.
Yeah, right.
We be believing you.
I think you've been watching too much purimation, okay?
I'll see you out there on the Delastreet.
DQA.
Look it and stick it.
Big, they're talking about it being like a war room.
And this, these secret hearings that they're having behind closed doors, the Howt You De Shiree Committee,
being like a war room and a cycle place.
And it's all partisan and they're screaming and yelling and carrying on.
And, hey, they're going to give it their best shot again.
It's right last Friday.
And work didn't shake the polls.
Didn't move it one ounce on the Richter scale on the president's job performance.
In fact, most of the polls went up a pointer too during the week.
So now this is their last best gas.
If we can just show his true, his true colors and show them.
I was in public last night and there was a lady like a middle lady, a little bit older than me, I would say.
Trubby.
It seemed like a nice lady and she was in line there.
Oh, go ahead.
How are you, Neil Rogers?
I said fine.
And then as she was, I know she was in front of me.
So she checks out.
She turns back and says, you have that Clinton hell.
And I thought to myself, yeah, okay, whatever you say.
So they'll be releasing these tapes shortly.
And if you didn't have enough to keep it busy last weekend with the 455 page Kenneth star report,
now we got the president on video and we got 2400 pages more good stuff.
Here's Anna and the first part like a lot of these Democratic congressmen are saying right now that are foaming at the mouth.
They haven't even read most of it yet.
They haven't had a chance to look at the tape.
They haven't read most of the stuff.
But a couple of guys sat down with a Crayola and a magic market.
So I'll build the mark this out and this out into a pornographic.
Then they're making judgments for that's great.
So the witch hunt continues and thank God I'm getting out of here. I'm going to have my passport in my hand real tight.
Here's Hollywood. Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
First of all, have a great vacation and we're going to miss you.
Thank you so much.
And you remember late in the break in years when the White House was in the World War Republicans
and the both houses were controlled by Republicans.
There were persistent rumors that Frank Sinatra was blanking Nancy Reagan.
That's the White House.
Well, of course.
And anybody that pursues that story was crushed.
And they didn't want anybody to know about this.
No scandal of the White House.
Right.
Yeah. Now everything goes over here.
All the Sinatra books that's in there.
For me?
All the Sinatra books that's stories in there.
Yeah, I read a couple of them.
Yeah.
What I could never understand is after having a God and how we could point Nancy.
That's really nice.
Well, I was starting to feel in his later years, you know.
Yeah.
Anyway, have a great holiday.
Thanks a lot.
We have an open line at Proud, 566, 705, 60, count 560.
What we've got in Washington right now is a political blood bath that's going on.
That's what we have right now.
And if you think you've seen the last of the outing of people with Henry Hyde and that bitch from Idaho,
that Chenna with woman at the Helen Chenna with and a Dan Burton, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Because Ken Star, he's had a platter problem.
He's been leaking all over the day in place.
He needs a colostomy bag now.
He's leaking so much.
And a carton of depends.
And so now everybody else is going to be leaking all over the day in place.
And hey, what are we worrying about?
How is the market reacting to this latest announcement, by the way?
I have a feeling I already know.
Let me take a peek at 275 here on CNBC.
Down 10.
That's not doing too much.
It's not doing too much until it's going to be just like last Friday, remember?
Kind of like hovered for a little while and hovered.
And then after the report came up, it went zooming up and went up like 180 points that day.
Because they said, well, who the hell is going to care about this?
Here's Miami. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
A young Catholic part had here.
I went to Columbus High School, but I didn't get my last dinner.
All right. You're the one.
Yeah, I didn't get my last dinner though.
But I got a couple of things to say on send things regarding that more on that called about the Frats.
Frats are just kids that each friends and pay money for friends.
That's right. A very good point, yeah.
They're losers.
And regarding Sosa, the fact that we live in a super racist-ass country,
basically they don't want to see the most, you know, prolific record in all of baseball history broken by a really, really dark state.
Yeah, it wasn't bad enough when Henry Aaron, you know, Hank Aaron broke Babe Rood's lifetime home in record.
A lot of people were a little bent out of his head, especially in Atlanta of all places, you know?
They don't want to see a super dark stick break the record.
Right.
That's what it all comes down to.
I think you're right.
But another thing is that he was given all the press to McGuire.
He wanted McGuire to be in the limelight.
He wanted kind of a back seat, you know.
And regarding the president, you know, whatever the president is,
the good guy, he's got needs.
And I'm disappointed that he picked such a fat slut.
Yeah, exactly.
And he doesn't smoke a better brand of cigar like from Nick's.
Yeah, you know, or at least fill it with some weed.
Yeah, there you go.
But hey, what are you going to do?
Hey, thanks, Neil.
Okay, pal.
We have an open line in date, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60.
By the way, George will be doing a show next week.
I'll be on vacation.
So be sure and bring your bond.
That's going to be the slogan, B-Y-O-B.
Bring your own bond for the show next week.
George will be here propagandizing.
I wouldn't be surprised if Norma Kent calls in every day,
given plugs for the normal people,
the National Organization for the Reform of Weed Laws.
Here's Miami Beach. Hello.
Miami Beach.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How are you today, great show.
Okay.
Got two things short.
Guaranteed to Clinton's ship back to Arkansas.
Guaranteed.
I'm not even putting an asshole on the year.
Same Jack as, like I said, call up one of the gambling shows.
Okay.
You haven't got 25,000.
You haven't got 25 cents.
You haven't got two nickels to rub together.
Okay.
Your pony asshole.
Go back wherever you came from.
God, don't call this show ever again.
You're boring.
You're terminal.
I'd rather talk to Rimmer than you.
Okay. And he's terminal.
He's, oh, God.
Good guy.
Boring.
My good friend, Rimmer.
Boring.
Where we going?
I mean, what did he tell us before when he called?
That we didn't already know.
And I have been doing a great job of promoting the big hockey
festate amount from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
and telling you a lot of good things like free admission
and free parking.
Half price on all the food.
Which I didn't know until I just read that thing in a paper.
How do you like that?
Half price on all the food.
You'll be able to sample all the good, all the different stuff.
They're going to have all the different stands there.
Which I'm positive of being able to love there in that crap.
And Miami Arena.
I mean, if they were dropping, if they were dropping doggy logs,
it would be better than the stuff at the Miami Arena.
In fact, that was my favorite stand at the Miami Arena.
It was the doggy log stand.
23 till 1 at 5.60 p.m.
I like peace and quiet.
Man, I don't need to listen to Barney Fag.
Barney Frank, Rangin in my ear,
because I made a few bucks off a book I worked on.
All the white folks hate the black folks.
And the black folks hate the white folks.
To hate all but the white folks is an oldest established rule.
But during National Brotherhood Week,
National Brotherhood Week,
Lena Horn and Sheriff Clark are dancing cheek to cheek.
Bun to nulagize the people you despise.
As long as you don't let them in your spirit.
Good.
All the poor folks hate the rich folks.
And the rich folks hate the poor folks.
All of my folks hate all of your folks.
It's American as Apple Pie.
But during National Brotherhood Week,
National Brotherhood Week,
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans cause it's very chic.
Step up and shake the hand of someone you can't stand.
You can tolerate him if you try.
All the Protestants hate the Catholics.
And the Catholics hate the Protestants.
And the Hindus hate the Muslims.
And everybody hates the Jews but during.
National Brotherhood Week,
National Brotherhood Week,
National Everyone Smile at one and other hood week.
Nice to people who are inferior to you.
It's only four a week so have no fear.
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year.
There's a one time in person for this House Good issue,
a committee which is a political blood bath.
Now, Barney Fag is under foaming at the mouth.
At least I think that looks like foam on his lips.
Tinkertly.
Exactly.
And he's telling it like it is.
He says they're not even coming up with any plan.
Is how to really research the material etc.
All they do in there is see how many votes they got and they got the votes to be publicant.
And they're just going to release as much as they can to try to manipulate public opinion.
And of course the grand jury testimony is all one sided because there's no cross examination.
It's all Ken Star and his henchmen interrogating the president and doing it from a very partisan standpoint.
We'll listen to certain answers into a baris and humiliate and degrade and bring down etc.
So this is a real good weekend to be leaving this country.
I'll tell you that.
I'll be wiring for whatever money I got left after the market crash is okay.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Uncle Neil.
Yes sir.
Good afternoon.
Waiter's to you.
I wanted to talk to you.
I'm with the men of Koon.
And me and my dad agree.
I'm sorry.
I think McGuire is the man.
I don't see any race through them.
At least not yet.
What does that mean?
He's the man.
What does that mean?
Well, I disagree with you.
I kind of agree with Hank.
I think that McGuire broke the record and Sam is just chasing to get the record.
What do you mean he's chasing?
Aren't they both tied?
Do they both have 63?
Well, no Neil.
Well, yeah, they are.
At this point they have 63.
But McGuire is the one that actually broke Roger Maris's record.
They both are.
That's about ridiculous.
I think I will hurt my life.
Don't hang up on me.
I know you're not going to like it, but I'm sorry.
That's the way me and my people.
You're not letting me say anything.
You're not letting me say anything.
I just don't want you to hang up.
Why not?
Because.
I'm a nice guy.
I don't want any tickets.
I don't want anything.
I just want to talk to you.
I'm just telling you, the record was 61.
Okay, who got one?
It doesn't make any difference who got there first.
We're not talking about who's believing right now, which it happens to be tied, which makes your argument even more spacious and the less meaningful.
The fact is they broke the existing record.
I think the record was broken.
But there's nothing argue about.
Why are pasted?
And then when in sunny, broke the same record.
If the record for a run in the mile was four minutes and two guys on the same day ran in tree 55, or whatever.
But it wasn't on the same day meal.
It doesn't make any... you're not listening to me.
It doesn't make any difference who broke it first.
They both broke the existing record.
But we have our own opinion.
And then it's not an opinion.
It's a matter of fact.
You know, tell me that you're from the Dominican Republic.
Don't hang up like that.
Get out of here.
Blow it out your ass.
Just don't hang up on me.
We have an open line at day 5.6, 7.0.5.60, and 0.5.60 on the mobile one line.
Brilliant call, pal.
Yeah, you know what? This guy, the only.
The closest he's been to the Dominican Republic is rubbing up against some of those Chiquita bananas in the fruit-standard public.
Here's a mobile implantation. Hello.
Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
Long time listener. Love the show.
All right.
I've got a little story for you.
Real quick.
I just got the horse about four months ago.
Yeah.
What, Henry, I ran off with your wife?
Yeah, right.
I just turned 30 years old.
So I didn't see no action about a month and a half.
So from one horn, he got to another.
I take this girl out last night.
We got a lost all of it.
I found some serious money on dinner and drinks and whatnot.
Yeah.
The weather was pretty crappy last night.
So I get her in a truck back to her house.
So she goes, come on in.
So I said, okay, fine.
We're sitting on a couch and she jumped on me.
It starts attacking me.
Yeah.
You know, we're kissing in the fourth day.
Yeah.
You know what she says to me, the silly bitch?
She goes, oh, I'm sorry.
I can't do nothing with you on the first date.
I don't want you to think I'm a slut.
There you go.
After she fills me up and everything.
Well, thank God there's still one upstanding young lady out there.
Huh?
Well, she is a slut.
We have an over line in Broward.
567.
You don't want people out there screwed around on the first date?
That's the American fucking way.
Hey, man.
Fancy broads like the one that says.
That's the American fucking way.
In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at Atlanta said yesterday.
For the first time this decade, more than half of America's high school students are just saying.
No.
To sex.
How do you like that?
Nancy Reagan was ahead of her time.
Whether it's drugs, whether it's sex, whether it's fish food, whatever it is.
If it's good, just say, no.
There you go.
And as if they had ever had sexual intercourse, 52% of those surveyed in 1997 said.
No.
Compared to 46% in 1991.
How do you like that?
16% of students said they'd had sex with four more partners, down from 19% in 1991.
Etc.
Etc.
And so on.
On and on.
It goes about this and about girls and about boys and this one and that one.
And a few of 50, the condom uses up a little bit.
We're supposed to be excited about that.
Where the hell is the thing about the condoms?
It's in here just one moment please.
Just relax.
Can't find it.
It was in here.
God damn it.
Oh, as if they used to condom last time they had sex.
57% of the students said yes compared with 46% in 1991.
That's still pretty weak.
That's just a little bit more than half.
That means that 43% of these kids are out there dipstick without any protection.
And we know about these girls out there, these sluts.
Walking a disease carrier.
In fact, some of these high school girls they hold up these sizes,
as a committee is my middle name.
Here's the lady mobile and curl springs. Hello.
Hello.
Yes ma'am.
Hi Neil, how are you?
Great.
I just want to tell you these guys that are calling you, they're complete idiots.
Haven't they ever heard of FPS?
It's like small penis syndrome?
They've got it.
They have nothing to say.
I mean they call about their problems.
Like a guy with his phony stare on his father and don't hang up on me, don't hang up on me.
Oh please.
But while we're on the subject of sex, I mean I really need to know because I do listen to your show and I know that you're gay and all that good stuff.
Yeah.
But what is your opinion on drag queens and that sort of thing?
You don't really say much.
What is my opinion of it?
I find them totally uninteresting and embarrassing.
Okay.
All right.
Because unfortunately the heterosexual majority likes to use drag queens as a stereotype.
And hey look at this, we're talking about a bunch of lady guys.
Yeah, it's true.
I don't see what's entertaining about drag queens.
I have, you know, I mean to each of us all and if you like that fine, I just see nothing entertaining about it.
Do you?
I think they're funny as hell personally.
I, you know, hang.
I don't.
Just funny to watch.
I mean we know one lies in Manelli and one Barbara Streisand and one Joan Crawford, that's enough for me.
We don't eat 500 of them.
Oh, you know God.
Anyway, well I appreciate you talking to me.
And have a great day.
Thank you.
Bye.
Happy New Year to all our Jewish friends out there.
Oh, there you go.
In fact that would be a good idea.
This is the year you whip off the beanie.
Oh no, not on the high holidays man.
Are you crazy?
Woo!
Don't take away our beanie.
This would be a good year to get that Mizzouza off grandma's door.
Yeah, overheard that body.
That's right.
Just try and take that Mizzouza off the door frame.
That'll be the end of you.
In fact, grandma will be on the phone with the attorney so fast changing her will.
You wouldn't know what hit you in the push.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Hey, you also forgot Julie Andrews and Julie Garland.
No, Judy Garland, yeah.
So you forgot Judy Garland and speaking of girls.
I saw the Leo de Caprio pictures yesterday in playground and it's just like black kid.
No big deal.
Yeah.
And.
Okay, thanks for the good news and butchup.
Sweetie.
We have an open line in Broward 565, 0560, pound 560 on the mobile one line.
Not a question of whether it's big, whether it's shaped like a hook and that's not the point.
Leo de Caprio is a sexist, sexless is a fruit fly, okay?
I'm underlining the first part of that.
There's in fruit fly.
In fact, on most of his pantaloonies, he's got what they call a fruit fly.
But they don't convince those young girls out there because they're very emotional and all worked up into a heavy sweat and foaming at them out.
And the president said it tasted pretty good.
Here's South Miami.
Hello.
Hey Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
I love those all fingers but I want to talk to you about the panthers.
I found interview yesterday and one of the panthers said that the reason they played so bad on offense,
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm defense was because they're concentrating on offense so much.
Well, they didn't see you.
That's a lot of baloney.
They didn't know how this is not a team that scored a lot of goals.
They had a lot of trouble scoring goals.
What?
That's a sad excuse.
That's a loan.
That's exactly right.
I don't know what they're going to do this year that's going to be,
what if they concentrate on their defense and they're, they're going to play better or something or they're off at our own.
Well, the defense was pretty weak last year.
But the only problem is their goal tending is weaker this year than it was last year.
Right.
But what do you think they're going to do?
What do you think they're going to do to improve their, their offense?
I mean, they said they concentrate on their offense last year.
They're not.
They're not.
I mean, maybe Terry Murray's got a magic stick that he can bring Dave Gagne back to life and Whitney will have another big year in coslovel blossom
and score 40 or 50 goals maybe.
And maybe Millenville come back and, you know, speed up to about two miles an hour.
I don't know what history is.
Well, scoring, I don't see a lot.
Right. I agree with you.
I guess I'll see Whitney in coslovel and maybe Gagne and that's about it.
Right.
I agree with you.
I'll see you out there at the game.
Have you still got those tickets or...
Which ones?
The dolphin tickets?
Yes, sir. You want them?
Yes. Hang on.
There you go.
There's the guy talked a little hockey for me.
He knew how to suck around.
I wasn't very excited, but nevertheless, online too.
Give the guy the other pair a dolphin stealer tickets.
And then a little while we'll draw for the hockey tickets.
And then we'll look at all this stuff for a killin' day and have it a nice lunch to top it all off.
From Tonys.
Good stop, Tony.
Or whatever his name is, Brad.
How come I'm having a...
I'll mind it.
I guess Jeff Cohen does want me to remember what their name is over there, okay?
Because he gets real nervous when we start life.
Well, you know, Jeff Cohen is great.
Pete's a lot of this great.
We love me. He's a great sponsor.
A good friend.
A little kinky.
But I mean, you know, Jeff's not the only guy in the world.
It's got a little bit of good food.
We got Chuck over there at the sub center.
We love Chuck, don't we?
Uh-huh.
And Nesey, we love Nesey.
Which you don't spit in my food.
You bet.
12, what's that going to start?
12.55, but five.
The Q.A.A.
The Neil Rogers shop port Lauderdale.
Oh, boy.
It's the one to two hours.
We hold that clenched and drove in the south.
We dine on deep bright spotted out.
We love to fling the dirt in the campaign.
We pray a lot in church about who to next best merge.
And then both only uses at the spray.
Jesse helps us on attack.
He hates the night sky because it's black.
And all the Joneses are new poster day.
We saw the elves above on the seven hundred clubs.
And I think that that you can't it was his name.
We lean away right.
And need a can.
We find the bush and planets have the we've like the door.
We're mostly white.
And sperm retention.
Here's our big thing is it a cause we lean way right.
And we all again to rest the same.
And hate the gaze and she's a stain.
And fear the things that we don't understand.
Retriever makes it worse like us.
Well, his face could stop the bus.
So I think we all should give her the dick ahead.
And 96 will be in swing and beat the dims like Rod making.
We'll dump the red and blue just keep the white.
I've left Limbaugh Santa straight, just don't let him near your plate, and hope there's no more books for him to write.
We lean way right, and need a cave.
We find abortion clinics, and then we block the door, we're mostly whites, and sperm-retending.
Here's the big bag of tidal cause we lean way right.
Okay, it's 103 at 560, sorry, just finishing lunch. Nice go on Brad, outstanding. What do you have in the field the best in the cities when I heard?
That's what what's his name said. It's a lot of really crispy. And McCloskey, here's a pompe-no, hello.
Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir? I got a complaint, and I've been trying to call you for about two hours.
Five hour ago I called whoever it is. Boobs and answers your phone, says, I say, I like something else, but he said, no, clinic. That's like it, he calls me, still a ticket, man, I really wanted that.
Good, good, good, good, mow, George. Excellent. See, he's psychic, he knew you were a butt plug. We have an open-line at Broward, 560, 750, 560, pom 560 on the 18th, he knows you were shameless, free loader, right nothing to say.
Excellent job. George would be doing a show all the week next week, and let's hope that Joe is learned a little bit, and is nasty and rotten to the callers too.
Because that, see, I sit here with my finger on the off button, even before I take one, because I am anticipating, because I've been around a block a few times, I'm anticipating what kind of swill is waiting there on the other end of the line like this guy who wants his stealer tickets.
And by the way, they're not stealer tickets, they're doffin stealer tickets, okay? Probably some stealer fan. Like I said, really nice going. Excellent, congratulations to him.
On his Barney Fag, again, cracked this thing up, I want to hear what he's got, he's got to say. Come on, Barney.
Not to advance the process of fact-binding. We're no closer today to figuring out how to do a fact-binding than we were before. Not in any way unfortunately to decide what is a resident feature book.
We accomplished a lot. Or this is just a memory. They get this all hit, that old heavy hideoffer there. That old wife stealer, that old flandering adulterer, liar.
Oh, but it was a long time ago. It was just a kid. Yeah, he was only 41. He was only 41, just a young greenhorn. What behind the years is only 41.
When he's lying to this woman and saying that he's not married and he steals this guy's wife, this poor Fred Snodgrass up there in, where it he is in Western.
Here's a mobile in Pompo-no. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. I got a question for you. Change in the subject and happy holiday to you. And the same to you, sir.
Thank you. What is a Jewish person to do around the holy day is if they don't belong to a Catholic issue and they want to get in and pray. They don't let you in if you don't have a ticket.
And if you're a gentile, you'd walk into any church in South Florida. No one bothers you. But around the high holy days you don't come up with the cash by those tickets.
Because it's a business, don't you understand? It's a business. Jews don't have any of these TV shows on there with the 800 numbers.
So they got to transquease the box out of your somehow so they make it a business at high holy days. It's a disgrace.
Well, if they don't show you what it shows you what it's all about, it's a bunch of bull crap. As soon as it starts costing you money to believe in somebody else's religion, anybody's religion, then you know it's a business not a religion.
Well, let me ask you this. You know a lot of places to go. I mean, it's a synagogue anywhere in South Florida that will gladly allow a Jewish person who is not a quote unquote member.
Oh, good answer. Good luck to we, sir. Good luck. Stay at home and read your prayer book. I won't cost you a dime.
I will have to know. In fact, Georgia is going to be having special Russia shut a prayer services here on Monday for those people like this.
So good. You're so good. God, we're going to praise you. God. Good God. That's good. By the beat. But I'm up. But I'm out. Yeah.
Give me a frickin' break. Okay. Yeah, we can go to heaven so we can all praise God for eternity. Oh, God. Good. You're good. I said, what else is going to know? You're good. Yeah. Come up with a new one over now. You're good. You're great. You're wonderful.
What the hell are we doing up here? Where's the filter fish? Where are you? Good. When is lunch already? I'll guarantee you one thing. There's no rascal house in heaven. You got real problems. You got real tourists coming. All you old Jews waiting to go up and see God in heaven.
See, I don't care what anybody tells you Jews don't believe in heaven in hell on those bummer mice. That's the one thing. I mean, yes, the Jews didn't vet the Old Testament. That's very sad and all those old fairy tales.
But any Jewel believes in heaven or hell is really a goyend rag. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Nail. Yes, sir. I wanted a great. I'm just getting my mission stuff in my car.
Nice. Yeah, I know. I think the operative term that you're looking for maybe with the social of wire thing is both surpass the record. I think the wire broke the record. They both broke it. No, no, they both surpass. They're both surpassed. But now they're tied for the record.
Yeah, I think that was very simple and I'm not going to say it again because that guy is just an Ojohn provocateur. They both broke the existing record. They both broken. I exactly. You have to say, you know, okay, have a nice day. Surpractice. But I mean, put him up. Here we go. That's the number one hobby with this audience on that. But I mean, put him up. But I mean, but I have to come up with a name with that. A name for it.
Some antical nitpicking. I thought that the Clinton was the one that was supposed to be doing all of that. That's what we keep hearing. And now there are a bunch of copycat. The sematical diddlers out there. They both broke the record. Okay. The record was 61. They both got more than 61. They both wrote a record. What a tough concept. That is to figure out. I had some pretty difficult. God. Let's do the drag for the hockey tickets after we do this break.
For my hockey tickets for the first game ever in a history of the Macarena and sunrise. The exhibition game. The Panthers and they ruins a week from Sunday, the 27th, which we will mail out to you immediately. Not sooner.
If you need some cash, if you just a little bit. It's changing the rules. Yeah. Well, they're turning. I mean, you know, from this is what makes it so ridiculous. They start out. Why do they even waste their time in the beginning talking about it's going to be fair. And we have to be very judicious about the way we do this.
And we have to examine all the evidence. And it took them less than a week to go into a feeding frenzy now into a hysterical closed door session. A wild barn burning partisan thing now. And they're releasing the other.
The other written stuff and the tapes and they're going to get the Paula Jones tape and they're going to release that because they're trying to put out this enormous amount of material.
Hoping against hope that it's going to turn the public against this president make them look like a fool. And I hate to break the news to you. But I think it's going to blow up in their push.
Of course, it is because they're all a bunch of self-righteous hypocrites. And what's going to happen is that we're. And you know something. The guy who said that this was there was Alan Dershowitz is the first guy who used this term sexual McCarthyism. He was absolutely correct.
So that in McCarthyism, the witch hunts have begun, baby.
Without a doubt, because first of all, I would prefer to have somebody who's got a little balls and is a little shady running our country and doing things for it.
Then some boy scout who's totally repressing who and who gets pimples.
We're going to be attentive. Right. Exactly. Exactly. By the way, I made a little song for you. Yeah. A little thing for the past here. Okay.
Any I L R O G E R S the very best auction. Okay. See a farful there's far from doing his Nestle spot. See, I just mentioned far from the other day.
And this guy's doing a farful song. A little bit beyond you before your time. Most of you. That's okay. So who did we figure out? Did it was Danny O'Day? Alan O'Day.
He did it undercover. Here you go. Yeah. And okay. Thank you, Henry. We have an open line of two light. They're all gone. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pump. 5 60 on the 18th wireless line. What was that? Oh, that was Henry. It was serious. Did you call back to real Henry? Henry.
What did you say the guy's name was that I gave it all herman. Oh, sorry wrong name. Nice try. Hank whoever the hell you are. Oh, that was Hank.
By the way, don't forget. Hank's going to be at where? What did I do with that thing? God, this is so bad. You know, this damn studio. This is a farce. This is a joke.
Hank's at the east side pub doing a show this afternoon. And then we got talking baseball with Josh D and Donnie B. And Donnie and Marie. And Amarland's in the
next month. It's seven o'clock in a very, very big game for the meds. And I got to tell you, man, everybody talks about the cubs. They're doing great. But the
meds are one of the not talked about that much unbelievable stories of this baseball season for those who care. You care? No, I think it's pretty interesting. We have an open line in
the middle of the night. I said for what? Oh, well, if we need to get in touch with it. That's exactly the reason you don't know how to get in touch with me,
because I don't want to hear from you. Okay. There's nothing if something gigantic happens. If the president resigns, if they drop a nuclear weapon on
Raleigh, North Carolina, it'll be on the news. Okay. I'll be right there on CNN International right in my hotel room. If my dog has
been there, you put together a show that's edited well and really goes over and gets more than a one share, then I can wait till I find out to get back.
You know, and I'm not holding my breath. You notice how they don't even bring us the numbers at all anymore squiggly lines guaranteed. And then
Barry Jackass is writing about one of the great to have the marlins on there because they got like a 0.5 for all their nighttime shows on
the whammy and how desperate they are. You talk about desperate Barry Jackass. Just go look into mirror puts. Here's a mobile and sunrise. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, it's Bob from excitement. I haven't talked to you in a while. How you doing? Okay. I heard about that book you're reading. Ain't nobody's business if you do. Yeah. I don't know if you remember. I don't know if you ever got it. I sent you a hard cover autographed by the author copy of it for Hanukkah about two or three years ago. Really? Yeah. I don't know if you ever got it right. But I don't know if you ever got it right. I don't know if you ever got it right. I don't know if you ever got it right. I don't know if you ever got it right. I don't know if you ever got it right. I don't know if you ever got it right. I don't know if you ever got it right
but I thought for sure if anybody would enjoy that book it would be you. That is the greatest book in the universe. You're right. Well, it seemed awful familiar. Maybe I actually read it once before. It's worth reading again. I don't know. Yes. Please read that book and start spewing about it on the air. That book reeks of common sense. And therefore, nothing will ever happen out of it. Right. Exactly. It is incredible what that book says. What that book tells it will be an enlightening experience for you. It is excellent.
And are you there? I'm here. Oh, I thought I was. I'm right here. I'm on my cellphone. You know, what they're doing with all the strip clubs and everything and zoning them out now, zoning them out of business. All has to do with what's in that book and it's. Don't understand that sex. We can't let people have sex. That's a terrible thing. This is the most hypocritical society ever. Next thing I know the president's going to be having sex. Yeah. These municipalities are circumventing the constitution. They're overstepping their powers and they're putting
decent business people out of business. Yeah. Well, this is America. We better get used to it. It's not going to get any better. I believe we'll book. Have a great day. Enjoy that book and tell everybody to read it. Thanks a lot. Okay. See you. Get out of here. We have an open line in Broward 5 6 7 0 5 6 the release at 9 a.m. on Monday. We just got the word right now. The Clinton video tape testimony to be released at 9 a.m. Monday. We're going to have to wait all weekend long. And then even as a slap in the face to the Jews, how do you like this? Oh, what's your shot?
They're going to release a pornographic video that even Ron Jeremy would be embarrassed by. Who happens to be very Jewish by the way and also double jointed. Okay. Where we going? We're going to what's this one with 72 question marks again? Hello? Hello? Yes. Any of us know I love your show. And second of all, Monica Lewinsky. I have one word gold digger. It is so obvious that this woman was up to this all along who is going to keep address for.
All this time and now watch it. You have to be the biggest pig. The biggest slot. The biggest cycle. Right. She's a cycle. Yeah. She's a cycle bitch. I mean, I don't know. She's crazy. That's a warning to all you guys out there in radio land. Be where the cycle bitch. Any arm with off and fan can I have those tickets? Okay. We have an open line in date 5 6 7 0 5 6 the pump 5 6 the on the 18 T world. There are no more f'ing tickets. Okay. I got no more goddamn tickets. You got it?
They're gone. Man, oh man. A shivitz. No more doffin tickets. Panthers tickets. Traffic tickets. No more tickets. Okay. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I write the train every day with these right wing religious fashets. And they thought they always are talking about how Thomas Jefferson was the greatest non-flandering president we have ever had. Non-flandering.
And when you made that you read something the other day about how he was screwing around in Europe and all that. Where did you read that? Where did that come from?
It was off the internet. Oh man. It's well known that he. Yeah, I know what it is. I would love to find out where that was originally made so good show these guys because they think that this guy. They they they they. But let's let me ask you this. What difference does it make to you? What they think? Do you know what I'm saying? What do you want? Well, it does. I like to carry my end of it to these guys because they, you know, they get a lot of money.
They're gonna train their bobbing up and down and they're reading their Bob. And up and down. Yeah, a lot. And so was tell them so was Thomas Jefferson. Yeah, I have a great and George Jefferson to you. Better watch out for him. Okay. Maybe somebody knows where that exactly that came from off the internet because it was great. We have an open line and Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line. Here's a mobile in sunrise. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yes.
I'm from the Bahamas. I've been listening to your show a week. My friend from over here. You know, hook me on tour to that real nice. You know, I like it very much. Uh huh. When I go back to the Bahamas, I'm going to tour into 5 6. Yeah.
Yeah, my friend has been telling me about a song that you play. I like to hear it about the big black guy named back. Okay, you got it. Thank you Neil. All about. See you. I'm on. Okay. We have an open line and date 5 6 7.
Is that sad? Huh? Isn't that sad? Just as a just as a little parting gift before I go away in vacation, not going to put you on, Jack, as go take a shower.
You want to go with the eyes? Oh, they're already showering together. Yeah, but how about using some soap? Oh, you're afraid you're going to drop it? We have an open line and date one and Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line. How sad? How pathetic? God, almighty. How can you live that many years?
They never even get a semblance of a life not even a little teeny tiny one. Even I got a little teeny tiny one. Where are we going? Are we going anywhere? We just I'm telling you what we're going to do. Let's do the break while we're thinking about it.
Because I have to take care of lots of important business before I get out of here today. That was a real good lunch, but I'm going to tell you a few things.
I'm going to be a beeline. In fact, let's play the big black guy name Ben plus a 10 of our other favorite. Oh, no kidding, Sherlock. 25 till two of the mistakes upstairs. Then I just get through doing this. I was an hour. Not, but that's okay. Okay, 45 minutes. Yeah, nice going. You know what I mean? Oh, we don't want to get her upset. She'll start bitching to that to try that new sales consultant upstairs.
Car test is on the rocks. America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds. What can you do to protect your car? An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen. The club won't protect the valuables inside your car. But a big black guy name Ben can get away from the car.
It's simple to use. Just leave the big black guy name Ben in your car whenever you get out and he does the rest whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them to wear from the car.
I'm not a part of this. Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy name Ben. It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although he really doesn't say much. Just get away from the car.
That's about it. I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with. I got him to protect my car. It's the best investment I've ever made.
My name of it isn't that great. There have been a lot of cars that I can't tell you how many times I've heard it away from the car.
Knowing that I've got a big black guy name Ben protecting my car. Let's me sleep better at night. Call now 1-800-1 big guy. That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-Y. And instead of bring this.
You'll hear this. Get away from the car, motherfucker.
Oh my God. Brad, down there at Tony's, your food is great, but I'm going to tell you. Don't anybody, they're going to be an evacuation from this building any minute.
I'm going to wait. Certainly. Back your hotels. I've got you beat by 10 miles, mister. And I have no idea what kind of bombs you were dropping in there earlier, only what George described.
Couldn't have been in the category with what I dropped to. Oh. Listen, when you drop it and then you go running out screaming because it smells so bad.
And then you know. And you're thinking, please don't let anybody else come near this room, at least for like two, three hours till the smoke clears, so to speak. Oh.
Woo. So I feel now like I just had a high colonic and lunch at the same time. Nice going. Nice going, Tony. Brad, whatever your name is. Wow. Why is it that the, I don't get it. And the same in Italy too.
Every time I go to Washington, Italy, I'm like doing a goose step back to the hotel, just praying that I make it back in time. Talk about tight cheeks, man. Even Mussolini never had cheeks that tight.
Let's go to a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. You'll got. Yes, sir. Have a great time on your vacation. Thank you. I will. Just wanted to say I'm pretty impressed with QAM hiring a party Frank to do your budget car commercials. And also I thought I was also on the standing table.
I was looking for Elmer foot on those comedy bits. Exactly. Chris Rock on HBO was talking about Thomas Jefferson and the female slaves going, well, I just finished growing you. Now I got to pull your car. Yeah, right.
And I'm at a material. That's what the bird used to say too. I said, I'll pull my own cards. Get out of here. Oh, geez. You know that the Cubs have a pair named Glenn Allen Hill. They do.
Who's very big a big black guy named Glenn Allen Hill? I thought he was living in Lakeland. Here's a call from NASA. I'm on. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.
Neil. Yeah. I call it to your show. I listen. All those daily. I love it. I can implement you highly. You are one of the very few broadcasts in your country.
Tell it like it is. You have a lot of balls. I have big balls. Maybe my doctor said, do you keep a good witness with big balls and enjoy your vacation? Thank you so much. You're quite well. Yeah, man. Okay. He's roll of newspaper over there and have one hell of a good time. He says you're the guy that tells it like it is. You damn straight. We think we have an open line and date five six seven O five 60. Well, I'm telling you that was a just traumatic intestinal experience. I don't want to get too graphic because I realize it's sensitive. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I'm not going to get it. I
'm not going to get it. I don't want to get it. I don't want to get it. I don't want to get it. Yeah, don't want to get it. Yeah. Let's go. Wow. Yes. Well, look. Look. Now our assholes. Look. Give us less of a listen. Look. Wow. Look. Look at your assholes. Look at your assholes. Look. Look at your assholes. Look at your assholes. Look at your assholes. Look at your assholes. beautiful assholes. Look at your assholes. He said, take your assholes down and take your assholes down secondhand. That's what you're supposed to do. That's an amazing thing. That's what you're supposed to do. He said. And believe me, it was a real evacuation, believe me, when I tell you. Oh. Oh, they said, I have a fire drill for that one. He said, Leany Movol in the Hollywood. Hello. Yes. Hello. Yes.
man. Hi, I have just felt compelled to talk about something. Okay. I have the
misfortune of listening to the Germanic show last night. What is it? What does he
talk about? Because it wasn't sports. What was he talking about? I have no idea
people called up asking very polite very intelligent sports questions and he
danced around and talked about the best. I mean, you know, if you want a job
to see nothing, he should feel good. I want to bang you in the butt honey. He answered
someone answered the question. Yeah. What is his purpose? What is one purpose? I'm
not going to get married to his purpose. Where you have to back him to be a great
entertainer. He don't care about sports. He knows that sports is boring. Don't be
not my good buddy mad dog. Okay, bitch. He's a little bit down because me she
again got the rascic by a bunch of little girls from Syracuse. Okay. The orange
men you'd be all bent out of shape too if your school was a little pussy
school like me she again. Here's Miami Beach hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah. I was
wondering Monica Lewin's keys. Her and the president did it nine times, right?
Well, and did she wear the same dress? Oh, yeah. Well, she's just an intern. She can't
afford like a whole wardrobe. What do you want? Well, she will. That's what I was
wondering. She had a spare in the closet. Well, I was wondering if if all the things
run the same dress or did she swallow something? There was only one stain, sir,
and she did not swallow. She's Jewish. She didn't swallow. That's the problem.
And the president should never get involved with it. A jab. That's the problem.
And she would have swallowed the evidence. Then we wouldn't have had this problem.
Okay, it was the mess on the dress without see that nobody is talking about that.
Without the mess on the dress and the DNA, there would be none of this. We could
put this all behind us as mandates would say. Were you fudge back? See what I mean?
We could put it behind us. But in the meantime, we got that goddamn DNA. And so we can thank
Barry Drek and all those people in the OJ. That's where this really started. Big time is the OJ
crap with the DNA. Oh my God. We got here's a mobile in Miami.
Is a mobile in Miami? Hello? Neil. Yes sir. How are you doing? Great. I got three things for you.
First, I hope you have a good vacation. My mom just told me from Paris and said the weather was
beautiful. Great. The first thing is that, you know, I don't know if you read the first
page as a president, though. And I missed about a minute to your show and I've been listening
to you tonight all day. But there was a lady who would try to take her kids to celebrate
Russia's show. She is not a current member of a simple OJ. And they wanted to charge for
a hundred bucks. Don't be frustrated, boss. Yeah. It's a take her kids. Of course. It's a
40. She asked them to just pay reduce if you really didn't have the money. And they turned it down.
Right. Yeah, they turned her down. No discounts only at the Adeli. Notice counts in show.
You can't get a discount. It's tickered to have it. I'm sorry. So you got to pay the full price.
I'm telling you what you're living in that way. You got to pay the worship.
Second thing is that I found a city that's worse than floor. That's all floor. That was Texas. Yeah.
Worst place I've ever been. Yahoo and right wing. Yeah. Oh, everywhere.
And he's all I get too much. There were plans. Sunday night football was on. We go to this restaurant.
They got 30 TVs and the restaurant. And what are they showing? They're showing you the line
being from the band that's playing 10 minute 10 feet in front of you. They wouldn't even put the
football game on. Point number three. Dylan Monerton. The last thing that anybody wants to see.
Here's a country that won't even put sexual intercourse on nighttime television. But yet,
well, that's coming on. Wamy Monday. Oh my gosh. Don't walk any numbers. The president and
there's all of these videos and all of those experiences stuff that's coming out. Here we want to
hide it. We'll change the name of the station to Wamy. Bami. Thank you, Mami. But anyway,
you have a great day. Pal, have a great weekend. Still more than a one. That's what Barry Jack,
I said. He said, and tell you puts up an exciting on there like sports because Barry likes to
look at those naked guys with their jog straps on. That's what turns Barry Jack ass on.
12 minutes before two at five. Turn at your age. This is through the first theme. Time of big
things. Wake up everybody. The first theme number one. Eat your corn is hand. I'll eat my
pop part. That took you three days. Jason. Hey, we hear you. You really enjoyed the poem by
the truck driver this morning. Man, three days. Oh, man. We're still about to move before
six. I'm doing three. Yeah, like the army, right? The first team weekday morning, six to 10.
Only on sports radio, five, 60 QAM. Oh, sorry about that. So Neil split. So it's just going to be
music and here's all these people coming in here. The Neil Rogers could I could hear the word
assholes. Thanks for shutting all the pots off Neil. I like I had to plan to do it from here
anything like that. That show you are the baddest folks. I'd like to see a song about
about me, about you, about the way our American hearts beat way down on the bottom of our chest.
About that special feeling we get from that cockles of our homes. Maybe the bull of the cockles,
maybe in the subcontract area, maybe in the liver, maybe in the chimneys, maybe even in the
colon. We don't know.
I'm just to radio show with a regular job. I'm here ever. White suburban nights. I like the fall
for knowing books about more. I got an average house with a nice hardwood floor. My wife and my job.
My kids in my car. My feet on my table and a cube of cigar.
But sometimes it's just kind enough to keep a man like me. Oh no, no way.
No, I've got to go out and have fun. It's someone else's expense.
I try really slow in the olds for fast lane while people behind me are going insane.
I'm on a toilet.
I use public toilets and I piss on the seat.
I walk around in the summer times. I ain't out about this heat.

I'm on a toilet.
I'm on a toilet.
I'm on a toilet.
You know what I'm going to do?
I want to get myself in 1967.
The panel I killed the Rotterdamer.
I think with a whale skinned off caps and all other cow in the area.
And big brown babies seal eyes, red headlights.
Yeah.
And I'm going to cry brown and have baby at 150 miles per hour to get one mile per gallon.
Second down quarter, five or two.
Burgers to McDonald's.
And the old fashioned not by the great of all styrofoam containers.
And when I'm done sucking down those grease ball burgers,
I'm going to wipe my mouth with the American flag.
And then I'm going to toss the styrofoam containers right out the side.
And they're going to goddamn thing anybody can do about it.
You know what I mean?
Because we got the bomb that's wise.
Jewards.
You clear.
Fucking weapons of days.
Russia, Germany, Romania.
They can have all the democracy they want.
They can have a big democracy they walk right through the middle of the enemy square.
And it won't make a lick of difference.
Because we ain't got the bomb.
So dad, John Wayne's not dead.
He's frozen.
And as soon as we find a cure if I can't or wait in a throwout that's ho-
And he's going to be pretty pissed off.
You know why?

Am I held last last word, am I just another half-hole?
Assholes get the orders, and assholes grow to vote.
Assholes get elected, because assholes get to vote.
I once heard it said that all assholes never die,
They just lay in bed in a small fly.
Assholes get elected, and assholes get to vote.
Assholes get money, assholes every day,
Assholes get elected, and assholes get to vote.
Assholes get an asshole from the main,
Because the size of the people is an assholes operate.
Assholes get elected, and assholes get to vote.
