He doesn't like cocaine just likes the way it smells
Snort and a balls of tyros rolling up a 20 snort and a ball and he's
Gave them good and plenty they lick the 20 dollar bills
Their teeth are grinding like a peppermills
Goin' a balls out the home and pills
He's in the sky
Steve how is in the bullpen? His nostrils are wide open
He's so f**king up he thinks he's on the braves
He gets advice from Doc and Doc prescribed some rock
So first he blew a line and then he blew the safe
Snort and a balls they abuse the magic powder snort and a balls
Wrinkler lit a mechlam chowder
Prescriptions got perpetual refill
They do it in the pool if they had gills
Doin' a balls out the home and pills
All that money
A balls out the home and pills
I like to welcome you all aboard
This is your manager
I love
27 before I was worried before one at 560 WQMC
And then his lost their mind over there
They're absolutely out of their mind
They're showing our live version TV
And then they got the guy they were about to meet
And like maybe out of 40 seconds later
They got an interpreter coming on
And they're saying they're having his phone
Celebration of the centennial of something
Of John Linden or Vladimir Lennon or whatever
And seeing that just showing his crap
Are you people out of your mind or what?
God are you people crazy?
Here's the hyaluria
Hello?
Yeah Neil
Yes sir
I was watching a show last night
And they cut to a commercial right
And then they showed
Do you remember when Laura Meager came to you?
I know they showed the same crap again
And then they showed you and they put your purse right quick
And then they were like
Get that guy out of here
You know when you were telling her?
Yeah
Yeah well I just wanted to tell you
You know that good luck to you and to George
And I'm going to school on Monday
And I'm all missed you guys
All right good luck pal
All right man
I'll read it out here
Okay yeah all the parks we go back to school on Monday
We wish you guys the best of luck and like I said, get a Sony Walkman
Keep listening to this show it's the only place you'll hear the God damn truth
We have two open lines and day one and Broward
I'm not giving no more Marlon tickets away
There's too much of an exercise today
There's some people in town
There's five or ten people in this town
This is too difficult
This is much too difficult
That's the strain and squeeze and plead and beg and cajole
And this guy that went on about the Covenants Well
That was unbelievable
Don't I want to go to the Andes?
For what?
I need to go see Ande Griffin
Much less to go to the Andes mountains
Come on they have lamas
Good good I'll go see the Dalai Lama
Okay get out of here you crazy bastard
You know I want to go to the Andes mountains
Don't you understand cut it off at Mexico
And let the rest of it just sink off into the South Pole somewhere
Because Latin America to me I'm very bitterly disappointing
Who in our right mind would want to visit there
And I realize some of you are from those countries
And just be glad you got out
Okay I mean at least we got a lot of good strip shopping centers anyway
Dead counties wide open
That's that's where all those people are friend by the way in Dead County
All those illegal aliens 5 6 7 0 5 60
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line
Isn't that where the illegal aliens go to Dead County
That's the American fucking way
Right
Here's a mobile in Boca
Hello
Yes sir I can't believe I actually got you
I haven't been in a country for more than a year in the old
So that's time I heard you
You were leaving that other station
Good to hear you on this station
I'm glad to hear your actions the same
The reason I called is to tell you about the most fantastic city in the world
Yeah
Barcelona
Spent almost the year there
And about a couple of months in Prague
Of course lots of stops and you know where Amsterdam
There you go
Well he what he said was kind of like
For example
Only he said Madrid instead of Tampa
That's what he said
Right that's what he said
Okay thank you
You first maybe that's why he had such a good time there
We have two open lines in day one and
Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60
Palm 5 60 on the mobile one line
There's a guy in love with Barcelona
I don't think so
I'm then told the different things
No matter what you listen to
If you want to check out a place if you like traveling a world
You got to go there yourself
Because you talk to 50 people
And 25 of them tell you one story
And 20 of them tell you another story
And the other five are so stolen out of their mind
You don't even know what story they're telling
And they don't either
You got to go yourself
You got to try new things
Like the guy with his spaghetti sauce says
You got to try new things
23 to 1 at 5 60 WQM
Where we got a brief taste of the Hank Goldberg show today from 2 to 3
Where we got 50 billion hours of pre-game activity
From 3 to 70 before the dolphins in the packers
We're at 7 o'clock tonight
If you go 5 60 QAM
Where you fudge back them
I'm here to believe I've got you
I'm a thousand smells
Running out of TV
Just don't stand in my way
Because never got to go
Now we're on meant to where you come from
Haven't eaten a thing for two whole days
I tried white rice and chicken broth
But nothing seems to work
My head for all these is swollen
To feel like they're playing
I think I've lost them on my colon
And I'm ready to go by
It's gone depends
Because I have tried
And money and still have time
We are all lost
I've got the wrong
Yes, I tried to kill the tape
But it's too late
Oh, this version bastard man
I just want to mark it was making nice comeback
The Dow was down only 26 points
And now they show a taped interview with Yeltsin on there
On Russian TV, first thing out of his mouth was
I mean this guy looks pie-eyed right now
He's had at least two points of vodka before he started speaking
And then the most important thing he said
Is I will not resign yet yet yet
And then he said
And that was sitting on the market down 49 and dropping like a rock again
We were just starting to make a nice little comeback
Everybody's assuming he's going to step down
And somebody who maybe has some of their mental facilities
Still working might step in there
And he will not resign yet yet yet yet yet etc
And so on and another one of the
That's it
I'm talking to a man that God damn Truman
Everybody's talking about what a genius he was
It was that freaking Truman
Send his ass back to Missouri, send the box back there
Send best Truman and what that was his wife
That was best, what was his daughter Margaret
Send them all back there, they're God's in Mishbhaha
In a God damn big carton
Should have gone in there and put that American flag right there
Should have gone over to Minsk and put the flag over there
One in Siberia
And then we should have built a bridge between the Illusion Islands
And the Siberia there, the American-American bridge, whatever the hell
And then move it out of the American way
And then we should have sent MacArthur back over there to Japan
That's right, got him out of the Philippines and sent him to Japan
And sent all Doug MacArthur in there about telling him what for
Stuck the American flag right in the middle of that God damn hero he was pushed
Right in his back home, there you go
And we wouldn't be in this pickle today having to worry about all these other
Guided and banana boat countries
That's what it's all about
That's why everybody's having a nervous breakdown and puking their guts out
Because we got a world where all these see if they didn't have the bomb
Then it would be a different story
Don't we just go over there and say hey Yeltsin you're going to resign or not
He says, yeah okay here you go, here's one for you Boris
What am I talking about?
Here's a lady mobile in Hollywood, hello
Hi Neil, how are you doing?
Okay
You know that lady called in or somebody said you have said that
You got to really go to the place
At the people talking back
You got to find out for yourself because other people have different taste
Some people are very bad taste
I got to tell you everyone I talked to I just got back from Fancy Cisco
Yeah
Everyone I talked to said you're going to love it you're not going to want to come back
And you know what? They were right
From where San Francisco
Hello
I'm listening from San Francisco
Yeah well then I did the monoraxing and I went down to Big Sur
Too, so that was really
I haven't been there in so many years I wouldn't even recognize it
I have no idea what it's like now
Oh well I almost couldn't make it back
Because the road heading back north to Big Sur to get to the airport was demolished again
Yeah
Every few months there
But guess what I did while I was out there
And this was not pre-planned it was just kind of a coincidence
The mountains were playing the giants
So I went to the game
You know my bar
The Marlin's in the giants you went to that awful candlestick street comp park whatever they're calling it these days
The three com
Oh god
Well that's the one Friday night two weeks ago we lost 10 to 0
So I was feeling like a real fool
Well if you go out to San Francisco if you go anywhere why would you go to see the Marlin game?
Because I thought it was a novel thing
There would be like my going to Roman going to the racetrack
But then last one
The problem is still one at five sixty WQM
Now if you do want to win a pair of Marlin tickets
And she ain't good again by the way
Make sure she don't get them Joe
Big caller number nine right now on a contest line
A winner pair of Marlin's tickets for the Dodge Big Mac Zone whatever we're calling it there
I wish I had that promo from yesterday but I don't
Because Sam of course don't want to be overwork
In the club level and left field there
You get out there might have a chance to catch the big one at markets
And maybe you just catch cold
Who knows what you're going to catch you'll catch something
And I'd call her to our contest line at 1-800-227-0560
227-560
And make sure she don't get them or anybody it sounds like her or anybody that's related
That is some nerve isn't it is not unbelievable?
I mean if you're listening to the show and I'm making it very very clear how we're doing is
Oh I'll take the tickets
Yes stick them in your recto
Okay sweetheart
You're not the only one and the center back to San Francisco
That's not the point
The point is I'm making it as clear as possible
If you have an IQ smaller than your little toe you can still understand
Every time you do that all these lines light up people think they're calling to the tickets
What do you mean? They call here
Even though you give them that a number out
They do know they know they're all full
If these people are right now think they're coming
No wait a minute I'll find it
Do they already play?
Are you calling for the tickets?
Hello?
Tomino
Yeah I think you're right they were calling for the tickets
Okay here's Miami were you calling for the tickets?
No I'm not
Thank God
I mean only really stupid people could be doing that
There you go
I have a friend who gave me a mortgage
I don't know should I kill them or you know
They continue being friends with them
Don't get too close don't get too attached
Back to George I'll give you my mother's phone number
We have an open line and Dave won and Broward
567, anybody out there got a dog or not too fond of
Here's my here's a Millie's phone number
Okay she'll take care of it
She'll take care of her dog
Yeah media sushi anosia to media that becomes her dog
And you won't see it no more

I'm going to waste my time with that normal crap
I'm already decon I'm going to walk around going to glutes to my ass
All these postcards from Amsterdam you want to go to a free place go to Holland
Okay where people know how to live and to let everybody else live
And where everybody's got a brain and where they teach kids about sex
And they're really young so they don't become psychotic and frustrated and acts murder
And chewed each other in school and in teachers and their parents and everybody else
And not everybody's running around with a gun because they're terrified that some scumbags going to come in and blow them out of their bed or whatever it is
Go to a civilized place because this your rated
Two open lines we got a president that everybody was psychotic because he admitted that he may have tried it a couple of times a hundred years ago
And didn't inhale oh my god we got a pot smoking president
Wow
Woo
Heavy duty baby I think maybe in fact if Jeltsin was doing a hell of a lot less of that vodka and smoking a little weed
Maybe he'd be a look at a little bit better look at that

Caracas does I can't speak for the rest of it because I would never go there but I would say it's a banana
Republic but they would be an insult to bananas
Caracas you want to go out and move it terribly
Well I have been through I moved from Venezuela in 1979 because of the exactly because of the situation
But still has this charm it has the exotic part of that also from America has yeah
But unfortunately you got to be on the adventure mode and really kind of like to roughen it up

Looking like something out of a Carmen Miranda movie from a hundred years ago it was incredible
Well but isn't that fun too?

I was just telling before about how the cab drivers kidnapped all the tourists
And take them on the middle

Open line and date one and powered 5.6705.60
Pound 5.60 on a prestigious AT&T wireless line
It's eight minutes after one on your dolphin intensive station
Don't forget now stay right here on 5.60
Because Greg Reed wants to make sure you don't go anywhere else
Because the dolphin game no TV of course it's blacked out
Are you out of your mind?

Unless you want to hear it in some foreign language from some barbaric country
And that of course is right here on 5.60 QAM

Everybody's people today's show is brought to you by Larry's latex and leather
Home of the vibrating melon
Ooh, and now back to our show
Hi, I'm your 15 year old host Jenny
And this is Titanic Talk
We're me and my friend Kimberly talking the radio about our favorite movie
Titanic and Leo
I love you Leo
Yeah, we talk about the most beautiful thing in Titanic
Leonardo DiCaprio
I love you Leo

Okay
Two, let me spot...
So anyway, I didn't say I was giving away one right now, but I might
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Oh, you people are shameless, you know
I'll avoid the light and by the way, speaking of giveaways, during the break
Did I... Did he really say that?
That putt-wacking Sam the scam
Who happens to be from Venezuela?
You see, that country once upon a time was really not so bad, I guess
And then Sam came into the picture
And all of a sudden everybody said
Oh!
And that's the end of this place
The fact that he's from Venezuela, I guess, either as an excuse for why he's such a
putt-wacker and so useless or maybe it's some other reason, I don't know what it is, but he is just
He's having a meeting by the way to, they were themselves about to be a center one thing
Gonna be able to make that, Georgia?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
He's having me, we're in here last night, we got all the stuff put together
Georgia's over there meeting with the CD people, they're gonna take care of that
LeWance taking care of the wholesale thing
And here's our promotion guy, he's gonna be sitting in on a meeting
Talking in that very pedantic style of his like, how are you, how do you do, etc.
And what do I do, nothing, nada
He likes that song, nada as you go by LeWance only the in-out of part is what he can relate to as in-out of thing
Which is what he does
Where we go, let's go to a mobile in Miami, hello

That would be like listening to it on WACC, like we had last week and hear a 7-second delay while you're trying to listen to the radio
Yeah, my hey, I have a great story about an old Jewish guy named Eisen
Yeah, but while I was waiting, he brought up Mexico
I went there about six years ago and friends of mine went to another one to go surfing
and they went to another break and they hired a cab driver
What a coincidence on the way to the other place
They all got robbed, took their money, didn't hurt anyone, but the cab driver
His money was never found
What a coincidence, right
No insides there
Okay, but I'm a local roofer here in Broward
And we're doing an old Jewish guy named Eisen's roofer today
I told him yesterday to let him know we were coming
And I told him that we had a big black guy named Ben as our foreman
And that he'd protect cars on the side and I thought it was just kind of funny that guy had to request that
How do you like that? He must be psychic
Yeah, let's be
But anyway, is there any way I could get you to play any of the little Clinton, you know, Melody?
Like what?
Requests, oh God
I guess you have a few there, the few strong
How about, I want you to listen to me
I do have sexual relations with Miss Luansky
And I told that woman to lie
There's a dress that has some stains
Preseason with a Friday night showdown against the NFC Champion Green that was at Pro Player
Countdown the kickoff starts at three
The game starts at seven
Yeah!
Sports Radio 560, Q-A-N
What's your question?
So this picture's a big trouble model for New York, Linda
A wreck
I can see what was here
Grand jury investigating
And guess where she shot this team heart
She looks like a guy
Hey, more stuff
She's seven feet wide
She makes me want to cook a shrine
Countdown the kickoff starts at three
A kick with a f***
With two smelly skins
A blow to the glee
Uploaded and ugly fat pig
Countdown the kickoff
She wants the media to stop the fusing
And Ritping her and ask with songs like this
But we find that amusing
From that self-promoting ugly pig
How much were you paying?
How much were you paying?
Formaticus pay?
Formaticus pay?
By retreats the melons pay?
That's what's good, Linda, Linda, Linda, Linda, the tricks of fancy
I wish you all would leave me alone
I'll just make it when I feel out there
I know you'll be beaten
Maybe I'll know so far from you
Just who do you think you're fooling?
You bad-of-talk is ugly smelly pig
You're really mad, drugs in a dress
And you know me
It's a classic
Okay, she's got big trouble
I just had a flash on CNN that the grand jury that's investigating her is talking to the people at K-Mart
She should listen to Dustin Hoffman
Who told her that K-Mart sucks, she wouldn't listen
The law in Maryland about wiretapping is this
That if you tape a phone conversation without notifying the other party, it is definitely in violation of the law
Unless you're ignorant of the law
However, the employees of K-Mart were in the bottom of her wiretapping device
Say that they routinely notify all customers
And they definitely did notify her that if you do wiretapping without the other persons are consent and knowledge that it's against the law
So that big fat Linda's got big fat problems now
All right
While she's going to need somebody to take care of her son while she's in the slimer
Here's Miami, hello
Neil, how are you?
Pretty good, sir
And they're here in the George breaking in with during the bit
Sure, I'm holding
In fact, you mentioned that because yesterday he said some of the most disgusting stuff
And I'm sure he was forgetting that people could hear it
Yeah, well that's okay
I just want to say something about the...
I think he said something like Bobby Hall is God and I don't even know who he is
But anyway
I mentioned one thing about your wonderful promotion department
Yeah
You're having a promotion tonight down on Quail Rouge Drive
It's a piece of hut
Way down south
Giving you a way to tickets for the Dolphin Games
Way up north tonight
Great
Excellent, great idea
What has the promotion started about 945 after the game is over?
Almost
It comes with helicopter playing right too I guess
You get up to the stage
Right
That's Sam's the best
We're sending him back to Venezuela
He's going to be deported by the end of the day pal
Hey, good luck
Okay, thanks
Bye
Okay, is that my stamps? I'll find out how much I owed Joe
I can't...how much do I owe him?
$100?
Yeah
He's going to bring him into you, make sure that they're right
Make sure that they're right
Well, what if they're not right?
You know something if they're even close I'll take him
Because what difference is there?
What if Joe opened the door
Come on, you can open that door
Huh?

he's a very well it was a little bit of his he's got music all it that's
out all over the world including Italy spain everywhere

well there's two ways to look at it
i mean number one you say you know you got to come all the way over here and
come in for an hour
and of course to go into that building for hours like risking and danger in your
health
but on the other hand come in for just an hour saying okay see you

depending on how much free food's waiting

lana course more need a little bit of cash you know i'm talking about i don't

peculiar way could be on the ear and act like he belonged on your guilty doesn't
belong on your just to say hello okay well you know what i mean you know the thing i was
listening this morning and they were doing this contrived controversy you know with Hank
and Andy and and i'm listening to that and i'm thinking the thing that bothers me the most
is that guilty thinks that we're kidding and i can't speak for Hank but i think i don't
hang pretty well when Hank is telling you that he's a little putz and will always be a little
putz i think Hank really means that and when i tell you that i know i really mean it because he's
a little no nothing but who is shrill and talks loud and kisses a lot of ass and shills a lot and
doesn't know what he's talking about well you know how you say you know you you have a face for
radio aren't you supposed to have a voice for radio oh not here i mean between that when
they put the board ops here on this station as long as you work cheap man it's unbelievable
as long as block takes a shine to any work cheap well you're in in this joint it's a shame because
i'm a sports fan but every time between goldie and uh having uh uh joe rose singing uh
whatever around the clock around the client i turn the radio off yeah a couple other things uh
well i'm glad you enjoy their show oh we we we we we we yeah only in the state of florida do we
uh get to choose between a jib bush and a buddy mcay i like the we we yeah shouldn't jib

me about that show do i dare to talk to see i was gonna say anything i was gonna try to be a nice guy
because their numbers are sagging badly and they need some help from all of us but everything is
so contrived didn't they ever hear mr ego that can try controversy on the life of it went over
like hollivite in the middle of bay route it just doesn't make it okay and uh they just it's so
contrived and corny and like sparring and jabbing and poking and jamming and uh you know who cares
