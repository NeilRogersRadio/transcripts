you did not go to this school in the place that you live
and then you decide to go back to the weekend
what is supposed to do is to tell gating
especially once you get into the game you can't serve alcohol and nc double-a event
yeah so what is so you're told me that you can't go to a bargain
who's up with what you're saying?
but if you got all your power to play you're all in trowel and from all different parts of the country

well maybe to call up the white house they might have some good numbers for you
but i'm serious i want to get a lot more and if you get to thank you won't be able to take advantage of the opportunities
well i heard especially since the game starts at eight o'clock but that's a good idea
the idea is to go there
you know barbecue some dogs and burgers and chicken breast maybe have a couple of
but i'm not
and you get into the game and
beat the crap out of every person that that but let me say this to you i understand what you're saying but do you

not get all that attention because he's got a small brown
open line and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty
on the eighteen t wireless line would be something if we thought that the big
mac is got a small brown one i would be a pretty interesting
or maybe if above is got a small brown one

anyway there's him to be you eight out

my life
uh...
at all strides will convert anyone into a jute
my life and
i've got to
uh...
translated means
sorry i must have left my wallet at home
me
and
and
and
and
and
translated means
stewardess did you make sure to give me a kosher meal
me
and
and
and
and
and
and
and
yes rabbi the check is in the mail
yes you two can convert into a two for just ninety nine ninety five at
orl striches
act now and get a free heart side candle for just ten dollars
orl striches
will convert any goy for just ninety nine ninety five or more if we can
and
and have a home especially backwards for christ
they
all exactly for christakes
so anyway speaking a kosher meals you know something i think that uh... with all
of money that i spend on airfare i'm a smok
i am absolutely a smok and people have been telling me that for years you know
when you were you know if you would call in the head of time just call the
airline
and tell me what a special me because the food on airline
worse than the food of the mimey arena that's a lot i mean the absolute worst
in the history now american airlines not too bad
edible
not great but at least edible
but most of the rest of the day suck
except all italian
so what what they serve you in a kosher meal what would you think that they
would serve you like a cheeseburger brisket how about a cheeseburger
that would work
uh... uh... uh... it won't be for the of seawolf i'll tell you that
oh some of the stuff that they serve on those european airlines like martin
air and some of those other oh my god
what your choices between play of seawolf or poached uh... australian uh...
cockerel
yeah
cockerel what what the hell is that i mean there they're asking you to eat
things that you don't even know what the hell they are cockerel no cockerel
so we'll find out from somebody who's ever ordered kosher meal on a plane with
a lesurvy maybe a couple of kosher weeners would be good
we have an open line and date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty
on the eight tnt wireless line
here's a mobile in pember park hello
good morning yes sir how are you great
i wouldn't look at my seat on the saturday yes
and and do i i do have great to i'm in section one seventeen and about
eleven rows up some right behind the penalty box that's nice
but i don't care too much for the legroom
i i think in part of the uh... arena in my army
the the legroom is very small i have a really i thought there was more legroom is
what they were telling me i think i think you're right
they have that little couple there there that's uh... well that's right they have
the couple to in front of your beer is in your seat and you know that stuff you're
gonna buy they hope
right so when somebody comes in and i thought they're warning for everybody
sitting in one seventeen row eleven
please stay in your seat while they're having their period uh-huh
second of all uh you know i don't i have to disagree with the with the uh- with
the tailgating and and i don't know why the associate tailgating were drinking
but uh... you know i spend at there's actually a couple of things
yeah but you don't tailgate before a hockey game i mean nobody ever know that
that i don't mind that i don't mind but it's the fact that the way they put it
in the paper that the cops are gonna enforce this law
yeah so so this just gonna be another reason for a sunrise cop to stop you and
ask for you and for that purpose i don't think it's it's right
not that you should go there because they're right there is no place if they were
gonna at the at the hockey game and another thing is that is the restaurant on
that club level now this year i spend families yeah i spend ten thousand
dollars on four tickets to sit in a lower bowl there
and and i think you know they should have that restaurant in a place where
everybody can make a reservation go in there and eat
there they say families is open to sweetholders and club seatholders only
exactly now you know i know that the hot dogs are not cheap and pizzas is not
cheap in there but to go in there and and that being able to do that i i don't
think that that you know i know that and i don't know what is that but we know the
team is gonna be so bad this year i think a lot of people are gonna want to go
and uh... in the first period get their cell phone call upstairs make a reservation
say i'll be up in about a half an hour and sit down have a nice meal and then by the time
we come back it'll be just about over time to leave i do like to you know i'm a big big hockey
freak so i do like to get down there early and it may be if they would eat in that restaurant and
go and go below and watch the game right and i really think that they should do some about that
yeah i don't know that kind of money they should give you like a special pass to go up there and
uh... you can be whatever you want exactly well that's all i have to say thank you very much
and by the way i love your your your show at night really nice thank god have a great thank you
okay here's the latest bull should be censored uh... sixty four percent in proper way uh
uh... that much of the same thing every day it's the same thing the polls aren't changing that's why
they want that take testimony before the grand jury the republicans not that this is a political
thing you understand that it's partisan by any stretch of imagination but they want that video
tape out to the public so they can see him getting red in the post and all embarrassed and psychotic
and getting up and walking out and slamming the door and saying you douche bag you scumbag
i think they got a backward i think can start the scumbag if he acts me i think you got a backward
ma here's a a lady in hollywood hello hello yes man uh... meal i just want to share something with you
George Bush of deceives the public before he even was president his golden voice they know to
but in the meantime okay great i think the uh... just at the fan that we just had a party

i know that's the line you always give me the all got out they did yeah
two open lines in davcount he five six seven oh five sixty and five sixty on the eighteen
t-warves line mobile and pember pine hello nale yes sir hey finally getting around answering your
question from monday okay that's only one thing well you know it's been busy week i had a
fourteen-tenth of weekend check my seat that the arena on Saturday incredible place
really looking forward to going to games there were you uh... shocked at your style amazing
it is because i know i was it's the point the place is it's beautiful it's beautiful and i have
first row up of all seats and it's kind of great because i can look down ten feet and see the
poor bastard to pay twice as much for their seats as i did anyway there's no bad views i mean i
when the first time the first two times i went in there when it was far from being finished
and you can i'm one of those people's not that crazy about heights especially when there's like no
there's there no railings and you're just like staggering around waiting to fall and break your neck
i really didn't have a real good fix on what the view was going to be from way up there and
what used to be called nosebleeds i'll tell you that there is not a bad view you can go way
in the upper deck the upper bowl and there's no bad view i went to the very last row just to see
what it was like from up there and it's perfect there's no bad views and i was a little concern that
the mezzanine is farther from the ice than at the older arena but it doesn't matter yeah it doesn't
matter still great i'm going to tell you i don't know if these imposehose over here have been over
there to see it but the qa in box you know we got a suite over there and i qa in boxes just
unbelievable it's breathtaking well i had those all those all locked on Saturday so i
thought this was going to go in and look around but uh... so that if you want to be honest with
lot because Greg never got that check in the mail that might be it that was the door i would
really just forgot to sign it so if you're a panther of things and take a hold you can get dolphins
tickets up in the nosebleeds for like half a place well i don't know if i'll be renewing those
next year let's see in the first preseason games the jerks in my row decided to get into a fifth
fight with the guy in the row in front of them will just happen to turn out to be a cop
i was a you know a multitude of beers later uh-huh during the green bay game there was some cheese
heads there so they had to ride over that and guys were literally pying down on the stairs
and then suddenly you know you get there early you do the tailgate things you know you get there
eleven o'clock the beer is flowing fast through furious right and there's drunk light at time
the day oh absolutely there's no question about it and this guy before that's a tailgating is
not about drinking this guy's full of crap if they talk all the booze out of tailgate and there'd be
like three people there with their little grills you would be you could roll bowling balls through
there right in anyone and god forbid the people in section 425 you talk about what's
bad you're enough what's bad yeah right oh yeah well the same with a hockey man if i can find
anybody talks about hockey around us so this year it'll be a real a breath of first year as
composed of as opposed to the other joint well if i renew the ticket next year they're not going
to be there i mean i'm gonna get some real things okay pal take care see if the tailgate party not
open line and broward and to and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t
wireless line you know the the interesting thing about going to a sporting event is that
of especially here because you don't have that many real sports fans
oh number one understand it number two care about it really all that much unless there's a lot
of winning going on and they can jump on a bandwagon and so one of the things that people just
all two things if somebody gets in a hockey game somebody gets hit by a puck in a head you know
puck goes up in a stand somebody gets hit and they're bleeding and they have to carry them off
or they're lying there for a long time everybody is looking i mean i'm not just talking about the
people in the area which you can understand that there's blood on their seat on their puts whatever
but i mean like all over the wind they're all like looking and gawking it's that rubber neck
and thing again they're very excited about that and besides the fights in on the ice which
there's a disproportionate amount of interest in that here because they don't understand again
that well so if there's a fight out there they think that's really what they came to see
but the fights in the stands at a football game any kind of a sporting event you almost never
see that at a baseball game i don't think i've ever seen a fight in the stands at a baseball game
maybe they're not tailgating enough but at a football or a hockey game man fights in the stands
especially football there's no you put all the other sports put together there's nothing
that even compares nothing close in this country i mean soccer matches abroad they're killing
each other but here at a football game a football game without a few good balls in the stand to
these people is nothing and who now wants to see that and it's always over something really good too
yeah like the day that fat rich knocked out guys beer over in our role when i have no idea who
that guy won you're over you knocked a beer over with his big fat foot and then he went and he bought
with his own money brought to you know i'm sorry excuse me was it actually he brought the guy
another beer to replace it and he still was pissed off and ready for a a countertoms
and luckily which says you know you don't want this man to be talking about you on a radio on
monday the guy says who's that he said in your rod you know i listen to me how you doing you know
all of a sudden his whole altitude changed but he's ready to get into a big son of Dan
because rich like a lot of us fat people are like even skinny people is the clots he knocked him
and don't stick to beer out there in the damn aisle anyway stick it either way under the chair or uh
right get into a lot of our way so we're gonna say in fact there i think some of these assholes
some of these red necks they stick it out there in the aisle they kind of push it with their foot
right out there in the aisle just as you're coming by just to make sure that you'll knock it over
so they have an excuse to start a brawl does that word redneck ever come to mind when you think
about football uh-huh okay just something i'm thinking about here's port saint lucy hello
port saint lucy how can we have nobody on the phone there's 60 minutes and 39 seconds later on
our diamond or gone or you know who it must have been no don't you we have an open line and date
and one and brown at five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the 18t wireless line
we only got one lost in port saint lucy and that's your good friend Greg formerly a boi
in beach must have been him too bad too bad we uh we lost our connection with our good buddy
here's a mobile in Miami hello hello in the hour did i want what is it did you go to the game last
what game was that the Miami dolphin i do not go to the dolphin games no i don't know how you see
you missed it because they had the indication out there and they were asking for your help to
watch over the players i know you got there later something they had vindication well no Sean
wouldn't out for the year first play of the game guy was late i don't know what i thought the uh
i thought maybe you couldn't find your park in place i haven't been there in three years i don't
go to the dolphin games anymore i see every week i'm giving away to a friend of mine i don't go to
the dolphin tickets games anymore because of who needs to see a bunch of drunks and we need to see
that boring scuse for football you have a see they're doing that invocation thing they're asking for
guidance they want the protection for the players i don't want to thank you okay so Sean
wouldn't broke his thing as panther we have an open line in day five six seven i'm not going to
no more football games i'm not it's just a very unpleasant experience i watched plenty of football on
tv lots and i thought that it would stagger your imagination oh but you hate but i don't hate
football i enjoy football if it's a good game which the dolphin game was not and i don't care how
many assholes get on here on this station and try to make a song of a dance about their
sitillating running game and about it was garbage it was crap i can't flip it back and forth to see
if there was anything of substance going on and uh at one point like late in the first half
buffalo at six first downs it often said one and the same old tired crap i mean three and out three
so they finally drive down the field get one touchdown why this is the same old crap i watched for
a hundred years to think that i would waste even a gas money in the turnpike tool to go through
there and watch that garbage even with free tickets i'd have to be out of my mind i'd rather stay
home and take bookers out of my nose for two or three hours i'd rather stay home and uh put my
dogs toenails anything constructive then go out there with a bunch of drunken oh yeah you got
a good time at the old ballpark come on you got to be drunk here and i'm not saying that at
baseball games people are swimming down the beers it's just i think maybe different class of people
who can handle their booze a little bit better but especially at wriggly field what those the two or
three years that we went to the cubs games at wriggly field did you ever wind up going to the game
one one and then they stuck me in a can and so get out of here you just had your uh your deal
of a lifetime but uh man they're swimming down the beers they're like crazy i mean a five like
handfuls at a time they're bringing it back to their seats hey come on i'm ready come on
i'm ready let's go take me out to them uh look what it did to Harry i'll see him no more
i'll see Harry no more all of the i think he was really a hundred and twelve years old as well
they finally determined 26 after 11 god for pomp and oh part we got all kinds of
wife worked and made a whole bunch of money and wouldn't it be great if you could sit around all
day watching tv and drinking beer and wouldn't it be great when someone comes to the door you can
just ignore them to have another beer and wouldn't it be great when your cigarette starts the house
on fire you don't care because your sound is leaping is stupid wouldn't it be great
lie day dream about the good life when you could do something about it just drink a bunch of beer
a message from the American beer council 17 to noon at five sixty w two oh okay the puppeteer
behind farple was Danny O'Day who now was Danny O'Day remember Dennis day
remember Doris day anywhere remember Danny O'Day no that's what it says he was the puppeteer
behind a farful dog i have my doubts we'll find out anybody are puppet people out there
and here's a very interesting fact about Thomas Jefferson since we all have all his sexual
scandal and we have people out there in a hinterland oh he lied to me about his sex life
Thomas Jefferson's love life began at 19 when he fell for a 16 year old virgin yet he bungled
his romantic chances by not making his intentions clearly known she married someone else instead
in 1768 while his friend John Walker was away for the summer Jefferson made sexual advances on
Walker's wife oh Betsy confessed her illicit relationship 20 years later the events
stayed dormant in the public arena till erupting as a huge scandal in 1802 while Jefferson was
held president day only the intervention of close friends kept it from escalating to a death
duel 34 years after the fact back in 1772 Jefferson married another friend's widow Martha
historians speculate that she had lived longer the longer she died giving birth in 1782
Jefferson could have been two of what does it say could have been too content to leave his
agrarian paradise amount of cello for national politics her death left him in a suicidal funk
and he vowed never to marry again in 1784 he moved to Paris as minister to France and was
introduced away Renaissance fuel romance at 43 he met a 27 year old artist Maria Conway who's
unhappy marriage prime the pump for a uh heavy attraction prime the pump they spent four delicious
months together in Paris until she broke it off probably from religious guilt she broke it off
oh who put it back on moral scandal erupted in 1802 when a southern reporter in pale president
Jefferson for keeping one of his slaves as his concubine Sally Hemings was the beautiful
Milano daughter of his former father and law one of his slaves
Sally had accompanied Jefferson's daughter to Paris back in 1784 and had remained in a place of
prominence in Jefferson's life for the next 39 years to life through his life dead death
mildly amusing interesting we have an open line and uh,
Broward and all of date is a vanished we actually were doing effects so many of a show here for almost
two hours today and now they've decided okay enough and up with the puppets
five six seven oh five sixty pump five sixty on the 18t wireless line
late year four lottery hello hi Neil yes ma'am i'd like to catch up back to the kosher meal question
okay thank god okay um now years ago um kosher meals were better because they first class you can
tell how many special meals they've got because you hear the stewardess is talking about it and
there's only usually like two or three on a whole plane oh well no during the um you know the
comment for you think that'll help we have an open line and Broward all of day did county has just
made a nice a nice knowing you guys have a great day hope they're headed over to the arena now for
to tailgate for the opening game which is like only a month away five six seven oh five sixty
pump five sixty on the 18t wireless line west Palm Beach hello hello what's up man not much
a um you know you're right about uh you know this thing with Clinton it's such BS but uh number one
you mentioned me about uh you've never seen a fight in based on his for uh in New York all the
time Cheyenne Yankee and I've sat in the bleachers of wriggly field and I'll tell you man you see some
big fights there really but uh do you think what Clinton that bothers me is that someone from a
different state that I didn't vote for I have no saying it's gonna go ahead and make a decision
that I'm against and I got I got a problem with that because I think Clinton's doing a good
job and this stuff is really private yeah between him and his family his wife his daughter uh that's
why they're so desperate now with this uh to release this tape 10 million for the grand jury because
they're they're hoping see their desperate the republicans really counted on last Friday is being
the turning point and figured that that all that gross detail in all that explosives that the
american public just would be screaming and yelling and it didn't work and I know but now they
figure that this is their last chance they figured what it means why did that still have to be in there
yeah why do they have it it did not why they that that's the whole thing they didn't have to mention
all that's $2,500 other pages that's where it belonged not another report why they're gonna be put
on the internet for people to see all over the world why do white water in the cigar and her uh
et cetera exactly why does why did white water as we mentioned why did uh you know the certain
thing is about what he did have to be mentioned see the thing I don't under I I now understand is
that he will be impeached because they don't want him there my I don't think he's got I don't think
I think that they're going to be hearings in the house I don't think there's any question about
that but I don't think they'll actually uh I don't think they're really going to begin
in my hearing I totally hope not but it's just amazing what this country has come down to you know
it's it's it's it's amazing and it's gonna happen here too and it's sad because budding the case
not gonna be elected no no chance he's got no chance and things are gonna be things are gonna happen
to the school board in this state yeah Jeff Bush is elected you have at least everybody have a
free Bible anyway yeah I don't by the way something about the Panthers only two game a few years ago
someone gave me tickets for the lower bowl I couldn't hear half the game because there were women
behind me talking about meaningless stuff and there's nothing about hockey I mean they look like
they could listen we we had one lady in our road list last season used to bring a book to the game
every week see and this is the season after they went to the finals okay now I'm hoping that
since this is not near Miami and it's not trendy in near sawgrass okay that it won't be like that
am I wrong I have no idea I think I think you're wrong because most of the people that came to the
games are from brown and Palm Beach and they got that county people coming to the fan bases is
a brown and Palm Beach you know the answer listen bring a good book hey thanks I see you there
Monica gate don't let me forget to read this okay when it gets real slow again in about 10 minutes
we have an open line in brown well the other here they're gone I mean you know the way it goes wait
till next week there'll be they'll be smoking these phones when little George is on here
that's right wait till I have my mint and come on and do the show one week these phones are
going to be smoking off the hook there's a mobile import lottery hello hey nail good day yes
sir good day just got my car and I heard of the end of your topic the airline food I was wondering
if you are read about the taste that's hardly there's a very small percentage of the population
that's allergic to peanut right that I didn't see the story I saw the headline right yes
and now I have violent reactions and just about quote from it if you call up again in advance
and say hey I'm allergic to peanuts they cannot do it from that life really yeah they've got to
serve raisins but the bigger the larger raisins would be the alternate the bigger question is
you that that Southwest tried to bring to the court was well where does it in I mean what if
someone's allergic to to whatever yeah I mean you can literally go on forever so oh yeah there
are people allergic to seafood there are people allergic to almost anything you could name of course
people allergic to chocolates absolutely so I didn't like I said I didn't catch most of what you're
discussing I did hit the airline food but I'm just I'm just trying to get some ideas as to what
any of these special meals that might be an improvement over the usual crap that they serve you
because most of the airlines are just garbage I fly regularly and it is virtually no difference in
the quality of food between a kosher or what would be described as a special meal yeah and what
it served normally I think I'm going to pack me a couple of sandwiches yeah that's your best idea
okay thanks a lot yeah American actually didn't do that better but job I don't fly American that much
although I think I might start a lot more because they give you great service good planes good food
great female captain air fluis up to Toronto nice going sweetheart hey you know some people don't
give a crap you know because the traveling public you don't have that many choices and especially
down here no matter where you're going oh you can't get there from here you got to make 17
different stops and there's only one airline that ever goes there like once about every two three
weeks when it's convenient for them here's a color ridge hello hello Neil yes sir
um born again circumcised gringo calling uh-huh I can answer your question you're born again yes sir
are you ignoring oh god am I what I find your show very humorous though it's a little
psychological it's for me to be listening and but why do I enjoy your show why are you I'm not
agnostic I'm an atheist okay I just wanted to know well you know we can go to a language and
stuff but that's okay I like it like would you have won uh gd if I pop up god damn yeah I mean you know
if you're if you're a true Christian you don't like to hear it but I find you wow kind of
sure you're not supposed to say stuff like that oh not now I'm in don't you when now listen
what you just said okay sound kind of silly really that doesn't when you when you when you let
those words that you just spoke hit you back in the face doesn't that sound kind of silly that
childish I think is the word I'm looking for well no I think it's childish day to have to speak
like that well what do you mean to I don't have to I just speak like this because this is the way
normal people speak yeah well I don't know anybody who says what a guy damn bunch of crap that was
you know I just don't know people are on I'm not one of those people who puts on an act for the
public and who uh it does does all this other phony baloney stuff I don't see any need for that
I can't we just go why can't people in the media just go on the ear and speak like real people
I heard there's a year that would be hey listen before I was born again or whatever I mean I
cuss like a sailor yeah I mean a big time and that's where I grew up I played football
what is what is being born again have to do with the way you spoke what were do you use because
when you become born again you know you don't want to start speaking like that and actually it's
really it's a turn off from yeah yeah but I don't I hear it is like oh jeez the least but I mean
whatever I don't know what did you just say jeez jeez oh Jesus oh Jesus Christ did you say that
no Neal what I'm saying you know what this guy said he said Jesus Christ don't say that again
no Neal I got damn it I know you did you say you started jeez Louise that was a jeez
for the jeez with the jay aha gotcha but Neal I'm listening to you so what's it matter I'm not
calling up to say don't say I understand we're just having a little discussion here I'm just
trying to figure you out exactly what but as always trying to figure me out I'm trying to figure you
out there you go well being into being an atheist and you know you really truly but I haven't got
any idea okay well and you don't believe any of that stuff about the Bible the Bible is ridiculous
it's silly crappin by a bunch of barbaric primitive idiotic dumb people by men it was a book
written by men for men and by primitive people you know I love to show but you got to remember
gay overweight and being an atheist there's no way to get through life oh really oh here we go
here's a good Christian you just get my Bible out here's a good Christian who's taken shots at me
that I'm overweight that makes me better there any are there any overweight Christians oh there's
a tunnel well why is that are there any gay Christians I probably have millions so so what are
you talking about your tongue you're telling me out you're telling me how I should go through life
no Neal I was trying to be out here that's the difference between no I don't think so I think
that that's the difference between so-called born-again people and the rest of us who are like
living let live kind of people I don't care how you go through life my philosophy in life is
do no harm that's it I don't know harm I can't let you see and I was no harm so that's all I'm saying
and I was just trying to be funny and it wasn't funny so hey God bless you all right Neal
and have a great and have a good day and happy brush your shoulder okay there's another
board of game guy with a bad sense of humor he was a lot of funny rug here and T before you
gave me came board again god damn it yeah I got my Bible out here what do I drop out of floor
oh better not have been something from my from your prayer book here that your crazy accountant
David gave you he didn't give me that who gave this to you no comment what do you mean by that
well what does that mean who gave it to you some Jew that we're not supposed to know about okay
okay are you listening crystal some Jew that we're not supposed to know about gave George a prayer
and I hope that he read it after whatever they did it's 1157 at 560 wqa m when you're looking at
the qa but Neil Roger Shutterdale were you fudge packing man I mean real garbage but there's
no hold unless you want to go fly alatalia they give you great food I'm sure that most of the
major European airlines you know the real hot sea tatsy ones they give you good food two open
lines in uh... date county how about that city bird airline anybody fly we had a few calls on
that back when they were sponsored briefly because I talked about them number that city turret bird
that flies everything through brussels see that's the only thing about them they fly at such
inconvenient times and they get there and wherever you have to wind up going from there by train
or by plane you get there and waste a whole day but supposedly it's a very good airline and
allegedly they give you pretty decent food we'll find out 567 from my from congress he's got his
hair down this like Hitler all he needs is a little mustache here's a mobile in keel argo hello
mobile in keel argo hey yes sir first time caller Craig Craig yeah you say uh
fighting in the grandstands you don't see any that in the Winston Cup stand yeah
yeah they do a lot of drinking uh-huh well there too is either head's keep above and around and
around their heads are like like Linda Blair spinner okay thanks a lot Craig we have an open line
and day these a good old boy and one in brown at five six seven oh five sixty maybe it's not red
next that are fighting at the ballgame maybe it's new yorkers oh what a concept because the guy
they called before was talking about the metz and the Yankee games which I can imagine there's a
lot of hatred there I know that they have interleague playing they play each other there is like all
kinds of contra-times going up there in the stands because they're new yorkers they got an attitude
maybe they're hostile and pissed off so maybe I'm blaming her good old boys and of course up
norets you go up north like to east lansing or the an hour Michigan there's no red next up
there are there no way all those good old boys from a waso Michigan there now red next are they
here's Miami hello Miami hello yes sir yeah so I don't understand uh these Republicans
these right when Republicans up there and then they're concerned about the morality of the country
when they're leaking all kinds of things about the president getting a little bit ahead
putting it on the internet right and just just putting it now they want the tape to come out
I got you know I got it has nothing to do with morality it's strictly partisan politics and of
course in the last 15 20 years the right wing lunatics they've decided to take over one of the
major political parties and had a great success doing it and so they they hide everything that they
do out of the guys of morality and religion and they're just a bunch of partisan political
assholes hiding what they're doing well I think with an agenda this is they're they can't hide
anymore people with anybody with enough brains can see what these people are about uh you know when
you when you start the breach of morality breach of morality you've spewing this stuff all over the
TV spewing it all over the internet right right right they shoot themselves in the air somebody made
a good point yesterday when it was legal experts on CNN that is if you go and testify or I go
before a grand jury and testify that testimony is secret it's confidential the idea that he put
the testimony on tape and then now they should show the tape on uh worldwide television so to
embarrass and show that he had a red face and they got flustered and pissed off the only purpose to do
that it's not going to illuminate anybody all it's going to do is to another attempt to embarrass
and humiliate and degrade him and force the public to have a lower attitude in which I don't think
it's going to work I don't think it's going to work and I think it's an American I think it's not
patriotic to do this to the president and it's just it's ridiculous it's ridiculous it shows you
what this party is all about and I'm an independent but I voted for Clinton and I tell you what I
would never be a Republican I used to think Republicans but they're anti-Emergrant they're anti-worker
they're anti-human they're anti-women they're anti-any minority you can think of uh
there are a bunch of elite snobs who now are hiding their whole agenda under the guys
of being religious righteous goody two shoes would you just look at that look back at the right
the when they had their convention and looking back at uh when when this guy from the Christian
coalition came out and now I got home and power was speaking would you remember the hat that
that guy had on oh yeah it was it was a rebel flag for God's sake right a Christian yeah
what a rush down okay get your passport yeah okay we have two open lines in date five six seven
oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line we got a one party country in a very weak
party at that and then the other party a bunch of religious nuts that's about me although I will
say this it gave me made me feel a lot better about life watching that thing in the US Senate
yesterday that debate about the uh national endowment for the arts and laws a hundred million
dollars a year the congress gives them now which is half of what it used to be and the same old tired
right wing arguments again about all these immoral plays that they're subsidizing and about promoting
homosexuality and all this twisted art this which is really pornography here in the same assholes
that just put this pornographic report on the internet for the whole world to see and not something
that's art but something that's a you know a a an account of a real life sexual encounter and a
bunch of them that was okay but if somebody does something in the name of art that they don't
approve of well we don't want to be funding that and after John Ashcroft that Nazi from Missouri got
done with his pontificating since it was his amendment and they turned it down 74 to 26 there in
the US Senate including many Republicans with an IQ larger than their toenail who voted against it
and i thought boy that's not even close i mean it was no contest just one after another after
another say hey get lost screw you and who wasn't that made the most eloquent speech by the way
on behalf of keeping the funding for the NEA i'll give you 400 guesses fat the Democrat from
Massachusetts hmm how many fat democratic senators are there from Massachusetts?
not steady yes Ted Kennedy and let me say this to you too which will get the right wingers out
there really the uh look at that can be effective as president as of today 58% say yes 39% say no
so that's another piece of propaganda that these right wing assholes and these media assholes
oh well he's lost his effectiveness he can't be a leader anymore is anybody believe that?
no bunch of idiots what was I starting to say about to oh yeah here's the greatest the most
effective senator in fact there one Kennedy whether they were doing that thing with the Irish
group there at the White House a long couple nights ago and Clinton made the comment and he was
absolutely correct here's a guy when he when he's finished there in the senate whenever the hell
of time comes he will have accomplished more and done more good in that body and i mean if you're
a right winger you're not going to agree but that's too bad then any other senator in the history
of the country here's a guy did the how's that Mary Ellen and Mary Joe compacting doing huh?
anybody seen her lately no she died she died
and how many how much screwing around were they doing huh?
including the gonsome or shbukha the whole family Bobby Kennedy who I read I read one of those
tabloids he was doing he was having affairs with women and with men Bobby Kennedy how do you like that?
he was an equal opportunity scorer around her because the Kennedy family believes in non-discrimination
okay in other words if you're ready to all know the winner the bible here because that
board again guy got me all whipped up into a frenzy and all ready for religion not
I notice your two wish accountant David and scribe this in the front it says on the occasion
of being reborn a true yid oh my god of his mind is he out of his mind oh yeah we know that
does he does he we need to do that stuff does he do the thing with the tepula now every morning
look far be it for me to make fun of anybody else's religious practices how can you respect
the person like that I know why I do because he's your accountant because he's a damn good
accountant and he got the project separating that how can you respect him as a thinking
functioning human being knowing that he's participating in these idiotic ancient stupid rituals
that's crazier than speaking in tongues than that delusional bunch of crap I know I'm not saying
that the crazier than wrestling with snakes and speaking in tongues but just and how about
that self-flagulation thing that they do while the wailing wall the cat looks to no but the Jews do
that to the Orthodoxy they're crazy at the wailing wall they go there and they like to
flagulate themselves so to speak well that's why there were the talus that covers up a lot
but you know something I noticed you don't have remember I went a couple of weeks ago I did that
thing on a second page of Genesis to show how ridiculous and how this was written by primitive
stupid people who didn't understand the universe that they lived in much less anything else
and god made two great lights the light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and
the stars and the stars kind of like an afterthought well the stars I mean you know the moon and the
stars who wouldn't have had all those great songs if we didn't have the stars so right there it
shows you the kind of intellect that the people the men the ancient men who wrote his craft that they
had but you don't have to go that far you don't even have to go to the very first word of chapter one
because above chapter one and the book of Genesis in the Old Testament it's a section one
now I'm gonna spell for you how beret sheet is spelled okay thank you Chuck for my great lunch
it is spelled B-R-E those old Jews
wherever they are some are up there in heaven where the angels playing those harps anybody
better learn to play the harp before we go to heaven all you goody tushu pies pasties out there
if you can't play the harp you're not gonna fit in in heaven
I don't want to harp on it here's Hollywood hello hello yes sir
hey how you doing great hey no more facts for Clinton he now plays the harmonica yeah not bad
hey uh you know you know what's telling me off about Clinton is when he was
what what what what sir I hate to interrupt you uh you are not gonna believe I just looked at my
lunch I just opened up the little sack you'll sucko and there's a napkin on here you are not
going to believe what this says see are you gripping on your chair tight yeah you're better
I'm holding it squeeze it real tight it says made by Nisi dolphin tickets wanted
can you believe this go ahead sir I'm sorry I'm speechless
somebody wants your dolphin tickets huh I don't have any dolphin tickets
like it turns this all of a sudden that's fucking bitch go ahead sir I'm sorry yeah it turned
me off the bottom was he went to that uh religious uh breakfast and he started uh talking and
everybody's uh religion like when he was talking about the Jews he put on those gold you know
trim glasses and he he was looking like a Jew you know talking I mean the guys enacted man I mean
yeah well that's what you got to be who would I love I mean we had a professional actor in there
for eight years yeah well he didn't remember what the other thing was no this guy's good at it he
put on a I'm stunning perform did you see it that was like man this guy's really kicking some
ass you just wait when he Oscars come up forget about all his other glam this guy's going to be
number one he's going to win four Oscars for that have a right day let me go you too buddy okay
we have an open line important here can you believe that you must have already peaked did you
already see that napkin did she did she write that or did you write that you wrote yeah that's
my hands right sure it is that looks like doesn't that look like Georgia's handwriting Nisi wouldn't
put that in there I mean what an arrogant thing to put in there like here's your free lunch from
Chuck who owns the joint and loves you guys and you've done all this to bring us a lot more
business since our stuff is so great which it is but in the meantime dolphin tickets this is a
quick letter to Senator Graham and Connie Mack and I thought this hit it's right that the
nail on the head I'm writing to urge to you to do whatever you can to stop this disgusting
public commentary and constant rehashing a bill Clinton's private pekadillos undoubtedly what
you lost yes exactly undoubtedly what the man did was reprehensible but it wasn't big words
private and I feel his denial up in the lift of the fair was more than understandable was a
reprehensible because you put the cigar in his mouth after she put it in her sub my god yeah
human you know who among us whether a private or public figure would answer such a question as
are you having an affair with so and so with the fourth right yes as a matter of fact I am
it is ludicrous to imagine any sane person married or unmarried to do something like exactly
it is completely understandable and forgivable enough already this matter is a private one
I don't care to know what went on between him and the other person I think it's disgusting that
the media thinks this falls in the category of the public's right to know the true fact is that
the media knows salaciousness sells gossip is dropped up by the public because gossip is only
titillating tidbits about some well-known person's private life and nobody cares whether it is true or not
all this garbage about lying to the American people is pretty fun if you would have been paying
attention George he said he wrote this letter to Senator Graham and Senator Connie Mack of
baseball fame that right wing fascist pig from the west coast Connie Mack rams with smack go
sir George has net thinking like like all of a sudden he discovered you were reading like he's
you know illuminating me this one ate my lunch and let this guy read thank you as
condolences it is all this garbage by lying to the American people is pretty fun in coming from
the mouth of media types and politicians although these factions lie to the American people all the time
these people tell us what they think we want to hear my life was progressing very nicely without
knowing what Bill Clinton does below the waist I don't want to know all that concerns me
Bill Clinton is what kind of a job he is doing in the post I elected him to this concerns me
is he effective yes he is in my opinion did he lie under oath about a completely private matter
sure he did and so would I and I'll bet you would too unfortunately the American viewpoint is
completely parochial and very very insular coming from supposedly a great role power you like
this Neil the Europeans are having a blast laughing at us they know and understand that one
sex life is private no matter how public your life is when your private sex life begins to affect
the confidence with which you do your public job then your opinions want to know about it but not
before they don't expect private perfection from public officials they only expect that he
slash he do a good job and he elected post you know foreigners have become American citizens are
non-pressed when they see a question on the citizenship application like quote have you ever
committed adultery they laugh themselves silly and incidentally they really confess and
in answering this question they lied not because they're all adulterous but at the naivety of even
posing such a question at the bottom now you have a day oh my god when I'm on this tirade I can't
tell you how despicable I perceive the actions of Ken star to be that our government has wasted
millions and millions of dollars on this investigation and wasn't it supposed to be more
important is how many more pages is now it's almost done no is almost as well as this report
one of the government's jobs is to uplift the people while it defends and protects them what can
possibly be uplifting and filling boxes and boxes would be the help of a stupid affair like this one
uh stupid is what it was stupid for the girl to throw herself at a man in public office stupid
for the man in public office to take advantage of the girl's stupidity there is no way to defend
what either of them did maybe married men would have less affairs if unmarried and sometimes married
females would stop throwing themselves at them every comment I've heard from co-workers I have two
jobs and run a small home-based business associates and friends reflects all of the above I've
yet to hear anyone say Clinton should be impeached I speak to a lot of Democrats too how many more
pages just five more sentences okay let's put this lottery matter behind us stop focusing on
meeting George mine you're all business go ahead uh reveal upon your colleagues in the government
to forget and forgive are as it's supposed to be a Christian based government and isn't one of
the basic cuttings of Christian Christianity forgiveness let's show the goodness of the American
people by getting pajamas are using to concentrate on the devil and concentrating
positively on the good uh remember when Neil Bell Clinton had warts and we elected him twice he has
warts gentle warts and despite Jennifer flowers and Paula Jones we chosen because we realized
his private life and public performance are two different things oh there's more one please keep
all of it above and mind whenever you hear the word impeachment oh great actually thank you so
much thanks for helping me for my okay so was long and ponderous and very very terminal but he
said at the way he was right it was terminal and I apologize but I mean my lunch here okay
Christ almighty life is more than just entertaining the audience we have an open line in brown
where Shakespeare just hung up at five he was a good that was a good letter I mean of course he
wrote it to Connie Mackin the Bob Graham there's another spineless Wimp Bob Graham although he
at least voted to keep the funding for the national endowment for the earth nice go on Bobby you
spineless piece of crap he's such a third the idea that we have a good politician here in the
state of Florida last good governor that the state had was Le Roy Collins and I was back in about
the hundred years ago there was a guy an actual liberal governor of the state of Florida
Le Roy Collins baby about six hundred years ago when Joe Collins was playing first base for the Yankees
it's uh 26 after noon at five the Q-A-L deal Roger Todd
on partisan crap really lasted long time didn't it lasted about five minutes oh that's right we
want to be fair we want to make sure that our response is measure we study all of the evidence
and you've got a beat but a boob but in the meantime the republicans want to release these the
video tape in his testimony of the grand jury because they want to show beyond a shadow of it out
oh yeah he purged himself he lied he got ready to the face he was embarrassed and here's all these
growth see this is just more pornography because when I show you the video tape you're also going to
be hearing Ken star and the other attorneys asking these embarrassing questions about all the
intimate sexual detail so it didn't work in print but maybe if they can put an audio and verbal
account of the same stuff on here maybe that might get to the public you think so no but that's
what they're trying because they're so impartial and because they want a fair assessment of all
this information not man anybody so I don't matter what you think you may think he's the biggest
pervert or maybe psychotic and think you ought to be impeached whatever
but anybody who believes that this entire investigation and all of this the way it's being handled
now is nonpartisan and not just a political witch hunt man you're dreaming you're in la la land
and then I am it's going to blow up in your faces I'm telling you right now because instead of
giving it due time to at least put on the pretense of deliberating about this stuff and at least
pretending to be fair there is none of that they're just salivating foam and get them out because
they're all bent out of shape that the polls they're not getting the public reaction that they wanted
swallies right wing strategist that's the new deal oh what are we going to do now maybe we
can show him naked maybe we can show his little tiny penis or something like that maybe we can
get that soggy cigar right amount of I guess Monica's mom's probably hanging out of that too right
she's doing something with it like my mother said he just come back nice going mom
oh port St. Lucie's back hello port St. Lucie I told them not to do this again and what did he say
I won't yeah huh okay thank you okay we have an open line in pervert five six seven oh five

Miami good afternoon yes sir how you doing great are you last night to the first time
yeah that your ratings have to have gone up and date why is that because I saw you oh okay
now anyway that's not what I thought you don't have a nielson meter hooked up to your uh thing
no I sure don't I damn it and I don't want one good anyway listen uh we're gonna ask you
you know besides the fact that uh this is not what I was gonna bring up but thank god you are on
right now because every other station that has any kind of someone's of talk yeah I mean they
are ripping uh uh Clinton so badly really oh god yeah all our sanctimonious hypocritical asshole
for all of those mm-hmm and I'm telling you I I just I said that's it these people here are
treasonous bastards yeah anyway uh you gotta understand that they're all a bunch of right
wingers to begin with so there's no credibility there and I'll admit I'm a lifelong liberal but I
was never a big bubble fan but I mean this business about sex and covering it up and lying about it
I mean first of all it wasn't anybody's business in the first place and it's not relevant to
anything in the national interest and that's the only thing that should be um no in fact the
interesting how the stories are changing from these media hypocritical moguls now all these
those experts on here in the first couple of days they were saying well the real question the test
is he competent to lead the country can he still a function as president no overwhelming majority
of people are saying yes but now they're no longer doing that because that's standard they didn't
like the response to that so now they keep changing the story of course uh but what I did call you
ever about is that I was um listening to uh some other stations uh sponilla and you can
imagine what they're doing so no so this is what your friend here live bomb mavada and uh she had
a big thing on um the spies the Cuban spies oh yeah I'm sure they do at least five six months on it
well here's the thing somebody turned or something like that because she was mentioning something about
Cuban strategy from the island and the people are saying no no no that was basuto trying to get
more publicity and money he's the one that turned these people in and they're turning the
toes around on hip down well I hope they have a good time with each other okay because I couldn't
give a crap last okay have a great day if I never heard the word Cuba again it would be too soon oh
you can't say that well I just did say it I'm not interested in Cuba I'm not interested in
Israel I'm not interested in any of that stuff okay I'm not going to Cuba I'm not going to Israel
I'm not interested in the Ireland including Patricia Ireland that bulldog from now I'm not interested
in those things all these countries all over the world where people are you know the one thing
you can open up your ear and they're all going fanatical you know I do feel sorry for those poor
bastards down there in Cuba the ones that haven't got two uh pesos to rub together to
anything's to rub together because they were left behind because their skin color was too dark
or whatever George was saying before weren't you saying that that wasn't why that's what happened
yeah that's what happened oh there was no money huh they were very happy because they weren't
part of the ruling class that's right the privileged Batista's Pazons that's what it was all about
right and then they got on air and cash draw has brain washed them successfully for 38 years and
peered at my about a bit but oh he looks pretty healthy to me unfortunately because I wish quite
frankly he would croak like in two seconds a wicked nasty or at least get bloody diarrhea like
Roy Foster something oozing a grotesque so we could get on with life because I wouldn't you love
wouldn't everybody who's fair minded love to see the test like all of a sudden we wake up tomorrow
oh a castro croaked overnight and they have bad cup of tea like the Pope you know they give them a
bad cup of tea and then died in the sleep and all of a sudden it wasn't his brother we have like a
you're gonna have free elections in Cuba we're gonna have democracy there which of course nobody
there ever heard of that we're gonna have democracy now who'd be nice now let's see no but now let's
see how fast the boats go pouring out of here okay the planes oh my god they're gonna be you
as well how do you think hurricane evacuation forms long lines they're gonna be lined up you won't
be able to get near the airports you're not gonna be able to get near the port of Miami but these
people are all American citizens now hey don't confuse us with the facts okay I think the test
should be how many people are waiting to go back that are all screaming in the out of about this
stuff for last 30 some odd years how can a china with us just like how many the Jews from over
here how many of these Jews ran off the israel not to mention my father five thousand times because
it was so great over there and then came running back here with a tail between their legs
because they didn't want to live like a bunch of slippers over there where you have meat like
once every six weeks maybe if you know maybe if the rabbi says it's okay if he blesses it and the meat too
surrounded by mortal enemies on all side there's a word for that you know what's called masochist
now that's what it's all about here's a hollywood hello hollywood hello yes sir speak to me
oh i'm online i think i had something in my mouth that's okay me too well don't let the
the watergate people find me a white water people whatever what you were talking about like you
but my problem is i'm a republican you have a problem yeah i do now uh-huh i voted for Reagan
i voted for bush i voted for uh-dol yes oh you were the one yeah i was the one stupid fool and now
the light is coming to my eyes yeah thank god that i'm not gonna vote for this ticket anymore
you know this this president we have quint he's been in six years from the day one the republican
party has been fucking him right all along walking here and they're not allowing him to push
through any uh legislation he wants they're just pushing through what they want their favorite things
and now we get this idiot uh-jeb bush is gonna run here and hold it god who's never run for all
this even as a dog can that's right never been a dog catcher never had any elected office any kind of
things he's gonna be the top man in the state yeah i mean this doesn't make sense i spoke to this man
on a one-one basis uh-at-a dinner about six months ago this guy is a total idiot he could not
answer questions that i were putting to him you know what is he gonna do about hmos you know
the only thing he cares about h-o-m-os h-o-m-os those are ones he cares about he hates the h-o-m-o
once he's set us all to camp yes yeah but this this this party i'm gonna go down and register as
a democrat i'm gonna call the party i'm gonna call a republican party of pommam what i'm doing and why
i'm doing it that my family's been republican i've been republican you know you you just
follow the lead of your father and father and i feel like i'm sold out for this party god bless you
sir while he said he's going down there do it right now came before you let another one of those
because then jib bush will come and put your ass in jail for saying that in mind too okay we have
an open line in broder five six seven oh five sixty and five five sixty on the mobile one line
yeah i think it's gonna backfire it's only the sixteenth of september and they were asking
this morning you know they had these primary elections around a country last night anybody care
about that no bye bye Geraldine nice knowing issues out but they were asking if there were any
indications of any backlash against the president saying this whole in backhand star business
and they said uh no no the only thing they did see was a light turnout and that's the one thing come
November they're they're they Republicans are counting on that because light turn out always
favors the republicans because it's the old parts and the people with a lot of money and
special interest they're the ones that go out there you're good Christians who are like fanatical
and really driven but i think that by the time November third comes around and especially if they
get this i hope they do get this videotape released because i think that's gonna blow up and
they're pushed even bigger than the uh star report on friday because they are doing everything
to humiliate and demean and embarrass and degrade not just bill clinton but the office of the
presidency i mean based on what they're trying to do the president has gotten no privacy he's got
none of the rights that anybody else do and they say well you know the president thought about the
law well how about at least at the level of the law doesn't deserve the same consideration as
joe smith down the street goes and testifies in front of a grand jury and before he's back his asses
back in the white and the other row in the overall office already they're leaking it leaking it all
these illegal leaks how come nobody is talking about that what if you if you're watching up
this crap if you have a strong stomach maybe once a day somebody might make reference to that
they'll allude to the fact that all these illegal leaks are going on and how come nobody's doing
anything about that can start the great leak master who assured us months ago that oh no he
was not instructing and these then he's going to be able to stop it no more leaks remember the
you got to bring the friday barker and uh who genio martina's and all those other group balls back
because we got a bunch of holes to leak uh leaks here to patch up
everything in their part and then it's the warning desire to manipulate and twist public opinion
and drive this man from office and it weren't politically motivated none of this would be going on
none and you and none
zippity doodah that you've got to be a moron not to understand that no matter what your opinion to
build clinton is no matter what your politics are if they really were doing this on the up and up
if if there was any attempt to be fair minded and if Ken star were impartial which is a real hysterical
joke then there wouldn't be leaking in fact that little twirpy david kendler president's attorney said
that friday the reason we were able to put out that seventy five paid rebuttal or 175 whatever the
hell it was before the report came out of two o'clock is because there were so many leaks by
mr starin is office that they basically had an idea what the essence of the report was already
anyhow because they're leaking and leaking and leaking they're doing the illegal wire tapping
of people's telephones in this case so monica lawinski but that's okay illegal recording illegal
everything else but they can break all the laws they want nobody supposed to talk about this
always supposed to talk about is that the president's a horny guy as if we didn't already know
that and he likes to lie he likes to cover up his sexual escapade like that's something he just
invented wake up america baby before it's too late before a bunch of far viscera right wing
goyam take over the whole god damn country and what this guy just said before about jab bush being
a lightweight that's a compliment that's an understatement what jab bush knows about government
about running this state about anything about politics you could stick at a thimble and have room
for the gonsum ischbukha for the old bush family left over in there but oh yeah well you know
it and then we got people like ron silver up there in brown you know something they ought to send
you to camp okay ron silver you jackass you ought to be ashamed of yourself liberal democrat and
really Logan oh yeah well we're supporting bush because we're pissed off well isn't that great
you'd be one of the first ones he sends off the camp okay you you jackass you idiot you
shame on you i don't know when hell ron silver is coming up for a election but i hold out garen
damn tia that when it is everybody every uh you and everybody else to the or left of a till of the
hunt is gonna make sure his ass is out of there because payback is a bit you idiot
prof of the q a l the nil roger shillotter dale oh boy it's the one to two hour so anyway
george and i just uh came up we put our heads together came up with a sensational idea
those of you people out there that can't afford rolling papers anymore while the other times
they're getting really tough ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee ee
and don't believe in all that bull crap in the bible you can use each page as a rolling paper and then
you can be a holy roller sounds good to me it's wrong with that as a matter of fact you can take
that first page of genesis i was talking about before and you can roll up and take a couple of hits
and say man that's really good beret sheet huh or however you want to pronounce it
all right nice going guys yeah let's start rolling so always got the good stuff
well that's right off we're in the middle of little Jamaica baby they got the good beret sheet
right around here so they just had this thing on which i'm very disturbed that some of these
weak need democrats now well maybe it'll be better for the country if by the president reside if
you step down you know this is going to be you know and i said before you know you got one
half of a party in this country the democrats who are like watered down got list finalist most of
them cowering a shaken in their boots hypocrites and then you got of course the driven by the right
wing fundamentalist republican party which the rest of them can be found because they're too busy
like new new mister cover up their own peckery dillows you can forget about politics in this country
because basically we don't have any anymore we got almost anarchy where we're going to uh my any
hello hey me how you doing okay sir hey i'll even got a quick question for you i got a crazy
sister in war who's just obsessed to religion she was able to convert even my brother now
you had you talked about a book a few months ago yeah what was the name of the the book
got this crazy priest and all the business of religion i want to send it to her
this is quite a great it's called farewell to god by Charles temple didn't i give you a phone number
when you order advice since it's written on a Canadian publisher you can't buy it here in this country
because apparently we exercise huh you can't even buy it in this country no i don't believe it
well i'm just so sick of it i want to thank you personally for uh basically just opening uh
opening the eyes of the people let them see man what a crazy crack a crap people just
obsessed with religion that can keep because they've been brainwashed anywhere and you brain
somebody from the time they were little kid until you know the time that they are old enough
to figure things out for themselves it's a very real breed it's just amazing because i have a
great day pal they're calling you they're calling you the abode we have an open line at brown at five
six seven oh five sixty so at any rate farewell to god by Charles temple and and the phone number is
nine oh five seven one three thirty eight fifty two if you want to order that book
it's on what's the name of the publisher mns books but for some strange reason we can't find
farewell to god in america why is that this is a guy who used to be good buddies with the billy
gram and grew up with him and was a minister for many many many years until he finally saw was
there all a bunch of bullcrap and he puts it out here he lays it out for you very simple to
understand there's nothing pseudo intellectual in here it doesn't take a biblical scholar doesn't
take a genius or rocket scientist to read that book and be able to dispel all of this garbage these
myths these bubble my sees this beret sheet here's a Miami hello why am i waiting so long
yeah when you wait 30 minutes to say that that's a good question we have an open because you have
nothing to say probably is the answer open line and date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five
sixty on the eighteen tealine call us back when you get one of your testicles these ends okay
yaldi that was galdi jr. sixteen q a yeah maybe you know my jockey shorts
there's and we have the media extravaganza over Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
amid discussions of seamen stained dresses and t-mases with distinguishing features
public opinion polls indicate that most americans feel that the president's sex life not only
while in office but in the office is his own business this idea of privacy is a kinder
gentler heterosexual don't ask don't tell we may not necessarily approve of what you do but
if done in private it's your own business yet for the past half century mainstream american culture
particularly after the seismographic social eruptions of the sexual revolution has been caught
in the middle of an uneasy truth between a desire for the illusionary traditional safe moral order
of the past and the innate human instinct for increased personal and sexual freedom this is
the conflict in which William Jefferson Clinton and Monica Lewinsky have become featured performers
at first glance gay men and lesbians might seem to have no special take on a scandal one can't
imagine a more typical and taudary heterosexual situation overripe even for jockey collins yet
there are striking reasons why gay people might have salient insights into this complicated and
emotionally confusing narrative the most primary being that the drama surrounding Clinton and
Lewinsky whereas a remarkable resemblance to the position of gay people in the u.s culture today
at new york city's first gay pride march a lesbian held a placard reading
we are your worst fear we are your best fantasy just as homosexuality has come to symbolize for
many heterosexuals a scary break from traditional morality as well as new invigorating prospects of
personal freedom the Clinton Lewinsky scandal has elicited similarly conflicted responses
that the president may have engaged in an adult sexual relationship with a younger woman
or that the young woman happily agreed to have sex with the married leader of the free world
are clearly violations of accepted social and moral teaching yet at the same time many Americans
often shaping under a mandated sexual morality that only half of them accept can understand
that is our an impulse to act in similar ways that is why mainstream culture is simultaneously
upset mesmerized and confused by the impolio gay people however surely know what it's like to
have their sexual lives and activities the focus of so much emotional transference but there are
other aspects of the Clinton Lewinsky story that resonate with gay people we are constantly told
that rights of privacy will protect us from oppression yet we have all experienced how fragile
that protection is privacy for sexual activity or simply being gay often affords little immunity
from persecution ask Michael Hardwick ask Sharon Bottoms ask Monica Lewinsky gay people also have
an extraordinarily extraordinarily clear insight into how sexual activity can be the excuse although
hardly ever the reason for witch hunts and despite their protestations the political right and special
prosecutor Kenneth star have a clear political agenda in pressing this investigation and is with
most witch hunts the constant sturm and drang of the media hoopla functions as a contemporary
incarnation of ancient Rome's bread and circuses concealing far more important issues like crime
foreign policy a failing social security system but perhaps the most important at a time in which
AIDS is delivered present in gay people's lives the more than 40 million dollars spent so far on
stars investigation into the possible sexual valiances is a symbol of the sheer waste and misappropriation
of taxpayers money that occurs time and again how much AIDS a AIDS education could be funded how
many needle exchange programs could be instituted how many people with AIDS without these
health insurance could be given proteins inhibitors with this money the real scandal is not what
Clinton Lewinsky may or may not have done in the Oval Office but how completely misguided and
terribly harmful our cultures priorities really are brilliant Michael Bronsky you faggot at the advocate
that outstanding red on target and yes we do relate we know all about witch hunts
right Jack here's a davi hello hello Neil yes sir yeah were there dinosaurs and knowers are
I put that guy that was calling before about me only Dino the thing is there was an
in the skeptic magazine today it's great to talk about that they go aren't they doctor Laura
while she's full of crap yeah you know doctor Laura she you know something doctor Laura invented
crap yeah yeah they asked her like you believe in gosh we shouldn't question god the thing
they also talk about we talked about you know the earth ruling this on the earth before this on
and the dinosaurs on the earth if somebody just sits down and reads that one line it's on a second
page of Genesis about making two great lights that gives you an insight that shows you very clearly
that the men who wrote this crap had no idea what they were talking about this isn't the
vinyl inspired this isn't something that somebody handed the Moses and a mountain somewhere this
these are just the ramblings of ignorant people that's all that's true because we lived in a very
primitive ignorant time and the idea that here we are two thousand years later and we have people
running around repeating this like this is something that we're supposed to live by this is insanity
this is mass madness that's true Neil and we need guys like you because really they didn't know the
earth revolved around this they didn't know anything they didn't know dinosaurs exist it never heard
it wouldn't mean the earth didn't revolve around a sunken layer they didn't apologize them to
just a few years ago I know and in Darwin when two years ago Galilei and Darwin in this
in this decade I thank a lot Neil okay I have a great time God bless God bless us all oh you don't
believe in God no oh geez we feel really insecure now there's no God and what happens when you die
oh gee you don't want to know I don't think you want to know what happens when you die because you're
too emotionally you know too much emotional cripples to understand you're dead you're dead
too much as well live while you're alive because you don't live too much when you're dead and there
ain't nobody up there in heaven and there ain't nobody down there in hell and on the burning on the
lake of fire etc and so on this if there's such a thing as sin it's taking away somebody's
ability to think I've been saying that for 25 years stealing somebody's ability to reason and
to think is the greatest sin of all because it's the only thing that separates us from the
yesterday the rest of the animal kingdom that and the fact that we're big enough and powerful enough
to destroy the whole god damn world we're doing a beautiful job of it we're doing a great job
here's Miami hello hello yes sir right now more it sounds just like you sir you're on
ain't no yeah I think you are the greatest man yes I am okay with nobody say how a third cannot
not be true you couldn't touch man he's not my real look we just say I've been trying to tell a lot
of people man and it's no heaven it's no hell there's no link for fire it's what you do now with all
if there's a helmet it's right in the middle of my head okay but it's one thing I want to say I'm
not on the political thing you know that you can see I'm I'm from way back you know you're you're

wasn't it the tie your family and the godfather yeah and one of the strategy meetings they have
twin locks saying sorry I hit him eleven times with charges and he's still alive in the full alive right
that's why they want to sell it uh huh that's why material it's not working sir you know
that now I don't mean you I mean them it's that their strategy isn't working is blowing up
in their place I know they can't believe you still alive too bad okay thank you he's like the
ever ready can't with six hundred lives okay and they keep banging away and bang away and he just
refuses to fall and even these spineless fellas Democrats so they better get with the god damn
program okay we're sitting then to camp two jellyfish we have no I realized I see I lost a
couple of calls on here because I read that long pond risk but it was not on the risk it was very
well articulated and for those of us bags well what which hunts are all about political or otherwise
consenting adult sex lives I hate to break the news to uh middle America out there or whatever
the hell we are is nobody's business in fact I'm more concerned about those people who are interested
in other consenting adult sex life those are the ones I'm very concerned about because those
people are really scary part whatever is going on in air closet is creating a lot of problems up
in here between the years not so much between the lives where the problem is in this country it's
between the years that's where the problems are two open lines in date five six seven oh five

with broken legs, broken legs, broken arms, broken, you know. God don't know what they're going to
be breaking. I try eight minutes into your last week again for the 500th time. She got the hang
mail or something because God evidently either is not there or he just isn't listening and worried
about football. Maybe he's got more important things to worry about like inventing himself.

Sir. Okay. Can I put my two cents worth talk? Nobody's talking about debt. Buses can be the governor. If we don't start, you know, doing something, you know,
what do you mean nobody's talking about it? We've talked about it at length. Yeah, but you're the only one Neil. Yeah. Well,
we're talking about it. Thank you, sir. We have an open line in Brown to and date five six because nobody cares. That's why, sir. Nobody gives a crap.
And he's running out there to the condos and he's unsuspecting old Jews. Whatever happened to those leaders in the condos.
They used to round everybody up and you know, get their votes. The guaranteed locked in whatever happened to those old
batches. They all croak or something like that. Jesus. It led down the garden path by Hitler, Jr. Without the mustache.
Five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the 18 T wireless line. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, how's it going? Okay, sir? Yeah, what's up with the
beanie? What's up with it? Yeah, it's there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But what's up with junk? Bush? Okay. We've got our younger people out there. Really know what
the else going on? Right? They got a great education. They really got their head and all of this stuff. They know what's important in the world. Right? No, you bet. Here's a mobile in
Pompano. Hello. Mobile in Pompano. Hey, this David. Yes. I'm running down the highway in my car. Yes. Listening to a heard rush on the other
station. Yeah. And he went on commercial and bought a good store. Come up with you. Unbelievable. The difference between you and
Russ. Well, you're an intertikiness. You can't talk with your partner. Go back and listen to rush. I'm inarticulate. Right. I can't speak because I'm not
a Nazi like rush. I'm inarticulate. I'm not a big fat six. I'm fat, but not in the same league with him with his 85
divorces and all his other bullcrap and stories made up about how Vince Foster's body was in a house owned by Hillary Clinton.
And then they put me on a shadow without the stories of a bunch of bullcrap, but he doesn't bother to go on here and
correct it because he's nothing but a goddamn right wing lunatic for a profit. How in our isn't this great that this guy would
take the time. Isn't it? And he's so shocked now. The difference between like like could there possibly be another person in the
world who's got a difference of opinion? Who isn't saying diddo diddo? Which diddo says basically I'm a dunderring. I can't think for
myself. Remember those bumper stickers diddo diddo? Yeah, whatever rush says I'll say this end because I'm a parrot and I don't have a
brain in my head. And all you have to do is hear this little red neck that we just had on the phone. That's a rush hole right there. He's a rush
hole and he's an asshole besides that I'm in articulate right. You should only be sorry in articulate my red neck Yahoo friend.
OK. Go out and say hi to bossy the sheep and get out of our face and give rush your big kiss on a push
to why you're at it. See if you found any more dates on the internet. We have an open line in
the community talk show host hemorrhoid suffer folks over 300 pounds. I know the agony of this kind of dilemma.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you there's help with new preparation rush and my rush to excellent
suppositories. Now you can end the pain and it's ring of hemorrhoidal tissue. Just look for my picture on the box of
the positories and the applicator tube. Another fine product from all I B the obesity and broadcasting
network. One thing they say about larna as he's an asshole. Yeah. And are you scared Neil? Are you scared?
Larna says coming to town as long as I live. I'll never forget that call on the old IOD. Oh yeah, the syndicator from Houston.
Oh, are you scared? It's not personal. It's just business. The audio scared. We're putting larna on the
station against you. Oh, I'm shaking in my boots and all those years that he's been out. We've been getting our
six and seven and eight years while he gets those two nice going. Of course, that's 12 plus those old
demographics. Nice going, larna. You fat fascist, but he's so articulate. Yeah. I think the word he was
looking for was fat. Here's dear field. Hello. Dear field. Yeah, good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm confused about
something. I hear so many statements from parents saying that the president and is a bad example and
a showing bad leadership for our children. Why does a politician or an athlete have to be an
example to our to parents children? Why can't the parents be the example? That's what should be the
role model should be the parents. That's right. We don't ask back. We don't like presidents or
politicians to be role models for our kids. I mean, that would that leads me to believe is the parents
not doing their jobs and they have to look elsewhere. Right. Just like the parents don't teach their
kids about sex or anything else that's their responsibility. You know, we always want the teachers to
do it, but do it our way. We're going to get pissed off. So you they want their cake and they want
to eat it too. Right. Well, thank you. For sterilization. Just keep it in mind, sir. Yeah, I know. Okay.
By the way, Alan Greenspan is a speaking and Robert Rubin, the Treasury Secretary of the
Huffering, it's been up, you know, 18, 20 points all day right now. The that was up 16 and the
NASDAQ's up six. But it's all been hovering waiting for this word breaking news, this house banking
committee in Washington and the testimony on the global monetary crisis, et cetera, and so on. And
they're waiting. And I haven't been listening to the audio, but evidently, Greenspan didn't give
another signal about lowering interest rates. The markets are going to be really fired up and pissed off.
And that market's going to take a real like that. And on the other hand, if he does open up his
push and say something, you know, indicating again, like he did a week or two ago, then it's
going to go zooming up because that's what they're looking for. And at the moment, it's just kind of
like sitting there waiting a pregnant pause. Say something. Come on, Alan. Say something. Please say it.
Oi. Here's Miami. Hello. Meal. Yes, sir. I took that number that you gave with that for the book
for World of God. Right. Called up there. They have a big problem. And I'm not kidding. Because I called
the publisher. Yeah. They have been threatened by somebody or someone or something in this country,
not to bring it in. What do you mean by that? They've been doing it for, uh, no, no, I'm talking about
putting it on a book show and stuff like that. It's almost like a, uh, uh, uh, rush, alarm,
e, whatever's name is. How do you like that? Yeah. I'm serious. And a guy's calling me back.
I mean, it's a report when he does call me back. He's calling me back to let me know who and why
they're doing it. That's unbelievable. It's true. And I said, well, in this country, we, so in this
country, we can't put a book out on his shelves by somebody who's an ex minister who, uh,
who denounces religion and our articulates it very well and very brilliantly. We can't put that
on the shelves as an opposing idea to all of religious brainwashing. Well, I guess it's supposed
to be the land of the free. This is a, this is the era. Unbelievable. It's true. This is what the
I was just told, but he is calling back supposedly to give me some more information. Why they're not
on the bookshelf here and why we have to call Canada to get it. Isn't that something?
Thanks for the good news. Keep me posted.
Charles Nippeldon, farewell to God. I mean, it's hardly a, uh, a revolutionary book. It's
hardly one of the most grotesque things in this remain kind. But maybe he just makes too much sense.
Maybe he's just the bus business in such a common sense, a practical way that they're
fearful that a people read it. They'll say, Oh, yeah. Good points. All of them.
We have an open line and date one and brown. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.
North Miami Beach. Hello. North Miami Beach. Hello, yeah. Yes, sir.
One question. I know you're going to give me a straight answer. Huh?
What President Clinton did? Yeah. Did he harm the country or its people in any way, shape or form?
No, no, he did not. Okay, here's sunrise. Hello.
Hi. Yes, sir. I'd like to talk about the dummy of America. Yes.
Isn't it? Oh, this must be Neil. I'm sorry. I said this must be Neil.
Yeah, could be. Oh, God. Yeah. Right. People call up. They ask you. They call you and they say,
what's up? Why is that? You're asking me because they're stupid because they're stupid.
Like they got a call a few calls ago about Laurence Limbaugh and how much more articulity is because
he agrees with his his right wing bullcrap. A page five B today, sunset. Yeah.
There's an ad for one of these scary Halloween things. Dr. I B scary.
Oh, yeah. Nice. I B scary. What happened to I am scary? I am. That's his that be his brother. I am
hip. That's typical. You know, newscasters, everything. I mean, it's no wonder the kids in this country
are just as stupid as the public. Let me say it again. When the principles and the teachers,
some of them are as inarticulate as that they as long and can't speak the language properly.
How are they going to teach kids to speak? Crazy. The other night, channel four, this is before
the stock market, about 500 points. Yeah. They were doing a mock stock buy thing where they bought
certain shares. Anyway, they showed them the names of the stocks that they bought on the screen.
And one of them was Pfizer, the chemical company. Right. Viagra. They spelled the THI's the EOR.
All right. Nice going, guys. Probably Rick Sanchez had his fine finger in that.
No, this is a joke thing. Like I said, probably Rick Sanchez had his probably Tony cigarette
Oh had his finger in that. Absolutely correct. Okay. Thanks for the good news.
How do you spell a fish food? Okay, 12 minutes before two at 5.62.2. Speaking of good food.
Are you serious? Rich Wiley is talking about stocks on that show every day now. You have to be joking.
I need help. Rick Wiley talking about stocks. That's almost that was in a car last night. I punch you
over because we had Donnie Beyond. I mentioned this before tonight and he was talking about politics
and about this whole. Oh my God. And poor suds in the background. You could tell he was like trying
to crawl down into the chair and disappear and hide. Rick Wiley talking about sexual escapades and
about lying and about politics and etc and so on. In fact, you can't know what a great guy he is.
Speaking of the market, by the way, it's just kind of hovering there. They're waiting. It was like
almost even steven like where to look at that. And now it's starting to go up just a little bit
up four points but they're waiting. Come on. Somebody say it. Say something already. Where
you? Alan Greenspan say anything. Get that then. Arrow zip it up there. Two, three hundred points.
Oh, this is Al Rogers and Margaid. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing today? Not Al Rogers. Yes, sir.
Great show Roger. Neil. Yeah. Yeah. Roger. Neil. A couple things. I'm nervous.
Excuse me. That's okay. I'm pissed off. Now people are trying to tell us what we should believe
about President Clinton. Yeah. If he did it, a any other any man. What do you mean if he did it?
He did do what he already said he did it and there wasn't all that great to be honest with. Yeah,
but how many of us would admit it to the whole nation? Nobody. Exactly. Like I said that the other
a how many people would like to have their intimate sexual escapades right on the internet all over
the world and graphic detail with their name and push attached to it. I mean people would be
running for cover. They'd be running into cave somewhere. Who gives the crap? Exactly. No more.
But anyway, thank you Neil. How did a great show. I love you. Okay. See you. Seeing you here,
ready to blow that guy off because you thought he was not like Al Rogers. No, guess not. That's
one of the almost grotesque George Apologizes you, sir, for confusing you with the Unchist Al Rogers,
the Antichrist, Elantichristo, North Miami Beach. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. How you doing? Okay.
Long time no one left. I got a Jewish girlfriend. I've been to Nixie guys. Oh,
the one night. Yeah. I was Mr. President now. That's the United States of America.
All right. Thanks going, sir. Here we go. For one night, he was very well and he went to
Nixie Gar's first, his voice said, well, he had like a thing over his push. He had a muffled
push. Here's the North Miami Beach. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I want to talk ice cream cone real quick.
Yeah. What is the original original ice cream cone with the chocolate and nuts on top
and the sugar cone? Which one is the original? Drumstick? Drumstick? No. Nuddy buddy? Drumstick?
I don't like nutty buddies suck. Drumsticks are great. I, while I was hooked on those three years ago,
I was addicted. I had to go to what drumsticks and I was. D.A. Do you remember when you were a kid?
The egg. Come on. Which came first with what? You know, was the drumstick ahead of Nuddy buddy?
You might like that something. I'm worried about. I have no idea. Well, you tell me when you work on it.
Okay. Go on. Do some research on it. Okay. Pat will be waiting for your answer one of these days
very soon. Was it the Nuddy buddy or was it the dumbstick? That's what he wants to know. Maybe it was
the joystick. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood going once. Sounds real dead to me. Okay. It's
going to be a real quick couple of calls. You're not going to be in. Here's Haya Leah. Hello. Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir. Yeah. I just got back from school and I got into an argument with my professor because
he claimed that Lewinsky that we should feel sorry for her because she kept the dress the same way
you would keep like a souvenir cup if you had coffee with the president. Isn't that beautiful? Yeah,
right. Lucky if you had coffee, you would keep the cup. And Neil, if he was wearing a joc
strap, she would have kept his cup. Is that what he's trying to say? Your professor needs psychiatric
help. We got to have him removed immediately. Leave not sooner. Right. He really said that. Yes, he did.
Oh, what a jackass. We had to feel sorry for her because what? Because he's a slut that loves
running around with married men. We got to feel sorry for her that she got her presidential knee
pet and then ran it all over the place. Get on the phone with 500 of her closest friend and told
everybody in detail what was going on in there. We had to feel sorry for her. Your professor needs
a shrink. You know, also I was wondering if you've been on 595, I saw a billboard of 101.5 light
FM and it had Elton John and it says the bitch is back. What's that all about? What do you mean? What
is it all about? I don't know. Is that like mental infall Elton John or something? Okay, I'll
help you at the concert. Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay, no calls. Two minutes to go and no calls
in my arm. I could just lift off as a result. 5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. Any
interest two minutes to kill here? Anybody alive out there? Play the bitches back. Okay,
maybe he'll catch on. Jesus God. Yes, mental. It's all 5 6 7 0 5 60. We can't even do a little
mini lightning round here in the last two minutes. That's how much we've got now. Pomp 5 60 on the 18.
Absolutely nothing. Q.A.M. Yeah, I got cut off. You got cut off? What? Pomp on. How'd you get cut off?
Oh, Neil. How you doing? Listen, hey, it's not the idea. Everyone likes a little head. But the
key is you don't sit there. Neil will offer. What if George had some under the board right now?
Would make any difference to me. Do you pay the same amount of attention he always does?
Q.A.M. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Let me tell you something. I just went back to school to take some
courses at Miami-Dade. Yes. And if you want to think about what's going on, you ought to know
that those kids are being treated and trained like automatons. Automatons? That's what's going on.
The ruling class. That's the Wayne O'Neatt joint, the automaton. The ruling classes,
wherever they may be, are trying to create robots. Which is going to be doing an excellent job.
I know. And it's frightening as hell. Yeah. I just wanted you to know that the computer age,
they've destroyed our privacy because they know that they want to be able to control everything.
Yeah. And they literally want robots. Okay, thank you very much. Maybe the Illuminati is behind it.
I think it's a goddamn trial, lateral commission conspiracy is what it is. God damn it.
Well, too bad we don't have time for all those other calls that are coming in right now because I
bet you they're really great. Aren't they? I think these calls are great. Hello.
Too late. Okay, well listen, I just want to give them the opportunity for Krenna Lada. They're
ringing and ringing all these lines now. After I scream and go spastic and ballistic. Thanks coming
up next from Shulestake 2 at 2 o'clock. And then forget about the president. Forget about the
market. The Dow is up one point because they're waiting and waiting for something. And we got the
important stuff. We got the Marlin game that anybody believe in.
