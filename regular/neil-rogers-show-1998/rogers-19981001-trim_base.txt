The science following.
What I call a dirty square dance.
Up with the pit go down with the fence, in with the pickery, everybody dance.
Girls win rags on up against the walls, guys with a heart on promenade dolls.
Girls grab your partners, permanently by the balls, drag them down the length of the halls.
All right.
Make up my hollars, make them shout, what you pretty has up against is now.
First lady goes, taking lady pass, third lady finger up the porch, guys I have.
Finger out, crawling into halls, now release the more guys balls.
Down with the petticoat, up with the fence, dancing to end of the dirty square dance.

So we may have to actually come on here and start begging for cigars, begging for stogies and of course if we get some good ones we'll have to talk about them unfortunately. Hate to break the news to you. So anyway our center one thing officially kicks off this weekend and this I could do the rest of the show here today without even breaking for commercials about this. We'll be at the borders in Galar over by Galaria in for Lauderdale this Saturday October 3rd from noon to 2 and then I find out through the grapefine.
I find out through the grapefine that we're gonna be at pizza loft this next Tuesday night October 6th from 6 to 8 p.m. I had suggested to screw in when she came down here a couple of days ago. After she gave me this list of dates which I'm not gonna be here half of these dates and we had to try to get this straightened out. I had suggested since she had pizza lofts to get you for the day on my birthday when I'm not gonna be here. That maybe we could move that to Tuesday and let me know you know like revise the list and let me see what's really going on here.
Well come to find out that our exotic promotions guy over there Sam the sham who must have lots of naked pictures of lots of people in this company to keep that job.
Come to find out they put a press release out yesterday announcing that this coming Tuesday night October 6th will be at the pizza loft from 6 to 8 p.m. with our center one best and
real stuff. Did they send us a copy of the press release. Did anybody tell us about it. Did we discuss it and find with me. Are we gonna be there. Yeah, we'll be there. But would it be nice for us to know about these things. I know you're starting to get picky again. Your secondary. That's right. We're small potatoes because it's Sam and Luan. They're the ones that are in charge of this. They're the ones that are gonna make this thing fly. What tell do we know about raising money for charity anyway. And also that phone number for center one. That's what I'm gonna be doing. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this. I'm gonna be doing this
special phone line or to the best of me. Let me let me let me straight it out for you. There are two volumes this year. Volume one is great stuff. And volume two is like kind of like the old Neil unplugged stuff. That's like a little X rated with no bleeps in it or anything like that. With all the words that you want to hear. So there are two great volumes to make up for last year when we didn't have one. And that's center one number which will be working. Bell South assures us sometime today tomorrow. So she just called. Like I said, Bell South assures us the delay in getting the line
working is because of the hurricane. Everything is because of the hurricane. That's a good excuse for everybody that can't get the rack together. 954. 563. 3600. That's gonna be the number. It will be working tomorrow to order your best of Neil for 97 and 98. Volume is one and two cassettes. CDs. Whatever you like. 20 bucks a pop which all goes to center one. 954. 563. 3600. But at any rate, as far as this is center one promotion is concerned, it's interesting. And I've been telling you all along and very honestly, I have no reason to make this up.
That Sam, the sham and the nephew, the so called promotion department here, the incestuous relationship, the people that have the naked pictures of people that work here. And do absolutely nothing have been totally, absolutely 100% beyond the shadow of a doubt uninvolved in his promotion. Which is why we couldn't do it last year, even though I wasn't on the air here yet. Nonetheless, starting October one, I was on the payroll, right? Yeah, there you go. Nice job if you can get it. And we were hoping to do it last year to raise all that money for center one.
But Gregory didn't want to put up the front money. So I put it up this year made by $10,000 donation early just so we have the front money to print the CDs and cassettes because this is such a cheap ass outfit. And yet they want to, you know, they run in these promos on you're like somehow this is a Q and promotion. They want to take credit like, Oh, look what we're doing in our promotion department is really involved in this. Aren't they? No. It's embarrassing like everything else that goes on here. It's embarrassing. So I'm starting to make up a short list. Maybe you want to think about this today. Of people who are in the office, I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office
I'm going to be on the office. I'm going to be on the office.
Oh, we can't do remotes on this day and we can't do remotes on Sundays because we got
to often games as if he needs to be there.
As if somehow he's like irreplaceable and needs to be there for us to pull these things
off.
Was he there with any of our other appearances for a center one?
No.
For Camilo South.
No.
Ready the other money we ever raised in the past.
No.
Did we somehow get through and make it then raise a lot of money without Sam the sham?
The QA.
Okay.
1014 at 560 QM.
Now you tell me some asshole at the fan in Denver has called us and given you a bunch
of crap.
Yeah.
WQIM.
Too bad.
Maybe I'll call back.
Maybe.
Because Jim Leeland's having a press conference today and what time do we know what time
the press conference is?
Joe.
We already know that he's leaving and that he's going to go to a managed Colorado.
We already know that.
Anybody with a brain knows that.
What time is it?
1045.
1045 and we'll put it on for a few minutes.
Get the emis to real world there from Jim Leeland.
There's a good guy but not stupid enough to stick around here.
How come that guy didn't call back from the fan in Denver?
What was he giving you a bunch of crap about?
I don't understand.
What is there to bitch you out about?
Because we're not going to sit and have a long chat with him about it.
We're not doing a sports show here between 10 and 2.
Is that okay?
Is that all right?
Jesus Christ almighty.
He sports nerds who think that there's nothing else going on in the world besides
somebody running around with a jock strap on.
We're in a middle of a worldwide depression baby.
Not just recession one, the verge of a worldwide depression and people are worried about his
Jim Leeland going to be managing the marlins again next year.
No way Jose.
We can't even get a straight answer.
Is John Henry really by the team?
Are we ever going to get an answer on this?
Is there going to build them in a arena, a stadium of this?
Are they going to build them a pup tent?
Where's the money going to come from?
Fred Graham by the way, good article in the paper today baby.
Nice going.
Right on target.
As we continue searching for more money to build stadiums and arenas for millionaires
and billionaires.
Nice going.
But some jackass over there in Denver is very upset over the fact that we're not all
worked up into a friends here because Jim Leeland is making an announcement today.
Here's a call from Houston.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
Hey, I just want to tell you that the internet saved my life because I moved to Atlanta
about a year ago and I still managed to listen to you at least once a week or so.
Right.
And I'm in Houston.
Would you move there?
No, I'm just working here and I got in the hotel I'm flipping around for the ballgame
and I passed Larry King Live with Rob's Piro.
Oh, is that incredible or what?
I was laughing my ass off.
And here's what he had to say.
I saw a clip on the news this morning where he's talking about Clinton ought to resign
and they ought to take up a petition drive to force him to quit.
They have a candlelight vigil and caravans of trucks carrying these petitions from all
corners of the universe.
Oh my god.
Larry with that little sanctimonious rolling up his sleeve dude do all over the place.
I know how to do a torture.
Yeah, right.
Unbelievable.
It was funny.
And you know something.
And the interesting part of it is and I'm sure Larry didn't mention the fact that all
a Ross Piro supporters have abandoned him and discussed when they found out what a pony
he was and a total BS artist.
And half the fault calls he were taken were set up calls like, Rob, you're great.
We're going to run for president.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Leave it to Larry, baby.
He knows how to suck like nobody even Monica could take lessons.
I've been doing this along.
Yeah, we know Larry.
It was great.
Okay, have a great day, pal.
Thanks, Neil.
And a great life.
Hey, Larry King pumping up a little Ross Piro again.
Gotta roll up your sleeves and do do do.
Biggest bullcrap artist that ever came down to play snake royal salesman.
Little bigoted means spirit and nasty prick.
Fony baloney.
Oh, yeah, they're going to they're going to set up a hoodie or mess up my daughter's wedding
because they're trying to make us look bad.
Oh, yeah, they're sabotaging his daughter's wedding.
Paranoids, I got a clinic, egotistical prick.
And people went out and voted for him for president.
How do you like that?
Of course, he had screwed around because it would touch him.
Speaking of people touching each other, somebody finally said this to me, this cliping from
I guess I was on vacation when this came into paper.
Bishop of state battle heats up is what it says.
We're talking about the late and bishop.
Anybody remember the late and bishop?
No.
Of course you do.
How's Andrew?
Have a nice day.
Right.
The fight over the estate of Channel 10 anchor and bishop is getting down right ugly it says.
Helen Buckner, longtime companion of the famously dignified bishop, is being sued for a million
dollars in damages by radio personality Sandy Payton, who ironically received the bulk
of bishop's estate.
How do you like that?
I would love to keep you all to myself.
That must be what she told her just before she croak.
The waxy talk, myster was posed with bishop, especially toward the end.
It doesn't say which end.
When she helped care for bishop who was battling cancer, bishop charged, uh, changed her.
Let me say it again.
Bishop changed her will seven months before she died, giving Payton 75% of her 1.1 million
dollar IRA.
Oy!
Buckner, who originally was supposed to get the largest piece of the pie, but broke up
with bishop in 1991, was given bishop's candle home and the rest of the IRA.
Last month, Buckner filed a court notice implying manipulation of the will.
I've been slandered and defamed Payton told insider it's got to stop.
In a July letter to Payton, Buckner unsuccessfully offered a settle the dispute of Payton Pater,
another 142,000 from the IRA.
The incentive for Payton to settle changed the will because of a lesbian relationship with
the divorced Payton.
How do you like that?
It's not because you're associated with a gay person that your gay weener said,
Sandy has an impeccable reputation and it's been trampled.
Said Buckner, lawyer Lee Schollinger, I'm surprised they want to air this out.
When it got there and it out.
I would love to keep you all to myself.
Nice going, Sandy.
And it's really interesting that now that she's dead, only after you're dead are you supposed
to say this.
Now they're saying that where's that term again?
Not because you're associated with a gay person that your gay.
So they're actually coming out now and saying that Anne Bishop was a guy.
Not that we didn't know that.
Not that it's a great revelation.
But now that she's dead, it's okay to say it.
Is it okay?
Okay.
There you go.
Yeah.
You better tell Rob Kaplan that okay.
It's not because you're associated with a gay person that it necessarily makes you gay.
Necessarily, all he's worried about.
Better to draw him a diagram.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
What's going on?
Not much.
That guy kind of stole my thunder about Rob Ferrell.
I'm switched around and I'm watching a little soccer, I'm watching a little baseball.
That's a mad.
And then I see Rob's on there.
And I couldn't help but get past that he kept calling her a vulnerable young woman.
Oh, yeah.
Votable.
I mean, with her other knee pads, presidential knee pads.
Actually, you're very good at getting a little bit of a ball.
A little bit of ball there.
And today, you know, it could be that she was actually the one that instigated this.
Yeah, wow.
She already says that it's not just in the star magazine.
It's in the, uh, Kenneth star report.
It's in there.
She admits she, she brags over the fact that she went there and instigated and floated
with him and to show him her ass and yada yada and all the other stuff.
She admits that proudly.
Well, he's got to have some kind of morality.
He's saying in this and that and that.
I think Larry made some kind of association with it.
If you were the, if you hit, you're, uh, you had a, your CEO, follow about us and that
and got busted.
Well, if he was doing lanterns, he'd be out of the right away, even though Larry said,
what if he tripled profits and everything's running great?
And they're going to, oh, I fired him.
No doubt.
No question right away.
Yeah.
And Larry's asking him, what's you?
What if you were the CEO?
Oh, Larry, how could you ask me something like that?
He's crazy.
He is crazy.
He's crazy.
Well, however, uh, crazy like a fox, but Larry keeps putting him on her again.
I mean, who in America?
Who in the right mind wants to hear that little puddle whack or anymore?
Not I, sir.
In addition to which I wouldn't be surprised if he takes it up the leggoes, what I heard.
All right, Dale.
Have a great day.
Thank you, D.
OK, 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18 T wireless.
I'm going to get any response here today.
No.
I'm going to wake up the natives today.
No.
Got the big hockey game tonight at the new Macarena.
That'll be my first event.
I've been in there three times, but this will be my first time actually seeing a game.
And the thing that really distresses me, my luck, my luck.
I'm reading about the game tonight.
And it says the rank at National Car rental center will become a virtual test tube when
the panthers play the Carolina Huracun's tonight.
In what is an NHL experiment that few members of the league seem to care for, the center
red line won't be in use.
I'll call a chalky.
I mean, give me a break.
The one game experiment will be examined to determine if it leads to greater scoring.
Panther coach Terry Murray hates the idea.
And I's gone, Terry.
I went on target, sweetheart.
I don't agree with it.
But Murray said there are too many bad habits taking out the red line as stupid trial.
It will change evaluations on our defenseman.
You couldn't fall to play if he gets caught on a breakaway tonight.
Absolutely correct, sir.
Who now wants to go to a hockey game where they got no center red line and where they
like changing the rules and making it up as they go along?
Well, it's only a nice evasion game.
What they're bad enough to begin with.
So I think like maybe one period tonight and checking out the entire arena and the food
stands and stuff like that, that'll be good enough for us.
5'6'7", 05'60", 05'60", on the 18t wireless line.
Let's go to...
Even a guy from the fan in Denver didn't call back.
So let's see.
Between Allen and when we get the...
They got nothing these people.
We got a new CD from Tracy Nealy.
We got what?
A new CD from Tracy Nealy.
What do you mean?
A new CD.
Being one.
What is it?
Pure disc or three?
Yeah.
Meaning what?
Just one of them?
Yeah, just one.
And I got more coming.
And then as after that wasn't bad enough and we opened up the paper this morning on the
front page, which was it?
They're here, I guess.
Now, their turncoat, Willie Logan, sparts for Jeb Bush.
There you go.
He's all bent out of shape because he was too liberal for the Democrats up in Tallahassee
and so they pushed him up.
You know, too liberal.
So he's going to endorse Jeb Bush.
That makes a lot of sense.
Willie Logan, baby, he's the highest profile black Democrat to endorse Jeb Bush.
We got Jews for Bush.
Schwarz is for Bush.
And he, you know, they might as well call off the election because that Bubba there,
Buddy McKay, got two chances none and much, much less than none.
See, we don't have people anymore that stand on any kind of principle that stand for
anything.
It's all strictly a personal thing.
You know, you pith me off.
So therefore, I'm going to be a turncoat now.
I'm going to, you know, even though it's totally flies in the face of everything that
makes any sense for me, I'm going to support a right wing lunatic called Jeb Bush.
Nice going there, Willie.
You jackass.
Now, what are these?
What is this?
What are we doing?
Are we doing something new and different here today?
Are we doing what?
Something new and different that they all say anonymous.
Is that what that is all about?
Here's anonymous on five.
Hello.
Hello.
What are we doing with these people?
What are you doing in there?
I just put them on hold.
Yeah.
And here's Tallahassee.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir?
I listened to only one of Georgia's shows all the way through the religion show.
Yeah.
And despite the fact that I actually went to synagogue yesterday, I liked the great deal.
Yeah.
I'm glad you're back, though.
Please, no more Michael Jackson.
You can only take so much of that.
Yeah.
So actually, not Michael Jackson, but the Jackson Five.
I agree with you about politics in Florida.
I didn't tell Hathy or living in Tallahassee right now visiting down south.
And as soon as you get pushed, get elected, I want to get the hell out of that town before
turns into, you know, before they start putting up the camp.
OK.
Have a great day, pal.
OK, five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
As the Neil Rogers show comes to a brutal screeching halt.
This is the end this week, by the way.
It's very fitting that yesterday was young Kipper.
Young Kipper is over by the way.
Now the coast is clear.
Oh, too late.
Don't make any difference.
Does anybody care?
No.
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line.
While the other Toyota dealers advertised the QA.

It's free publicity. Is it helping us? No, of course now we can't buy a call on the show the uh
The numbers look pretty good there
But you know something the cum went down if the TV show were helping us and finding his new audience the
Cume would have to be going up we'd have to be reaching a lot of new people

What have got Vincent and we got Andy and Hollywood and Mitch the misfit and what else we got in that little
Bunch of Cubans your friends Euras to your friends Euras and then we got Ron with his pro-zac and that's it. That's all we got left

I'm sitting here doing a goddamn show every day. I'm doing my thing
But why not f in sports station is what we're on we got assholes from the fan in Denver calm getting bent out of shape and bitch in Georgia
Because we don't want to sit in finger fork with them on the phone. We don't want to finger fork on a phone
Bunch of assholes over there in hope Jim Leland comes out there in the Rockies will be every goddamn game. That's what I hope
Here's a mobile here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I have a show idea for make your young skipper
You have what a show idea
You're you're gonna take a rubber chicken
From dot paper. Uh-huh. Okay. We have an open line in Broward five six seven oh five sixty
Five sixty on the AT&T line rubber chicken on it. That would be good. Huh
What is it? We have Donnie B with the re-ud with the poop. Okay. Here's Donnie B with the inside poop. How are you?
Oh gosh come on Donnie Jim Leland will not be returning the Florida Marlins
Tell you
Yeah, I was shocked. I thought he'd be coming back. Yeah, sure he did. I thought on the outside chance to get a little slow. Yeah
He's coming back in a black body condom looking like Dan Radler in the storm. Go ahead Donnie
Wishful thinking but he's grateful to the organization and the fans. He said they go to Colorado
No, no, he said he hasn't talked to anybody. He will not talk to you. That's a lie. No, he says he hasn't talked to anybody
He's gonna take his time. No Jim Leland hasn't talked to anybody
He is a man of his word if nothing else now. I'm pretty good. Oh you are such a suck. Oh no, he really is
What are you auditioning to replace Guilty now? Is that it? Oh come on
Come on nail go ahead Donnie. He's appreciates everything that that Wayne and Don smiley did for me
He was very impressed with John Henry and with John Henry and wishes everybody the best but at this point
He's gonna just he said it was a major decision for him to him
This was shocking the world that he wasn't come back because to him you know to him
It's a shock that he's not coming back. I mean he he feels it made here comes as a great shock to me
Made a song. Yeah, but he has no plans at this time. He said he hasn't talked to anybody
But he will he will talk to people and see what happens
Yeah, but at this point, you know, he's gonna sit by the phone. He doesn't have to manage this year
But he will it will it for the right situation like Neil Rogers is gonna sit by the phone weight for the phone to ring
Exactly, right, you know you got all the point in over the phone like Glenn Campbell right right and
You know, he's a rhinestone cowboys gonna sit there and wait for the offers to pour in doesn't matter if it's a L or N
Cosure cowboys
So basically that's it the biggest decision to Marlon history right now Jim Leeland leaving the organization. Oh
God, all by the way you put that is so dramatic. I'm just almost spent at this point
You know the the most momentous okay
I thought that maybe like the sailor the team would be a little more momentous. Wouldn't you think so?
Well, the sailor the team without Jim Leeland
I think this is bigger Jim Leeland
Because he's not gonna be here. He's in other words
If John Henry comes along and we build a new stadium and they actually spend some money and get a couple of pictures on there
That that's not more important than having Jim Leeland is that what you're saying? I don't want to argue with you
Don't know I just want to make you understand what you're saying, but that's the expert you're the bad hasn't happened
You demand that hasn't happened yet. Yeah, right? I mean, so that this point is the biggest decision
That's that's right up to this moment. This is the most
You know, would you say this is more important than them winning the world series
This is the biggest decision. That's not a decision. That's an actual occurrence. Okay, the biggest decision
Yes, yeah, and the biggest announcement we didn't have to announce that they were winning the world
Now is that I think the world and then Greg Reed not pushing in the five or fifteen million dollars to help by the team
Is it a bigger decision than that? Well, that was yeah, that was a momentous occasion. Yeah, that was true. That was pretty shocking to all of us
The fact that Greg didn't write his own personal check this matter fact. I think we work here. I'm pretty shocked by that
Well, because he is pretty giving isn't he was he's pretty free with the money
That's it. He says doesn't matter
Really national league or American league for all those who say he doesn't want to manage in the American league
It just really depends on the job and if the right one comes along
They'll take it if not he'll wait you know a couple years or next year until
And he's out and he's out he doesn't
He really impressed with John Henry
But he didn't really want to wait for the time to want to wait for the time table to rebuild again. Right
Okay, thanks Donnie. No problem. Great job. Hey, thank you now
Okay, 1057 at 560 W Kismence the reaction and Jim Lee Lens leaving are you shocked? Oh, yeah, are you is this momentous? Uh-huh
Woo. I don't know if I'm going to be able to continue throughout the day. We're just starting to build just a little tiny bit of momentum there

Are you gay? I mean are you a real raving homosexual good then you've probably got excellent sense of fashion and
Chico's fashion design needs you everybody knows that the only good fashion designers are women and overly flamboyant
Straight men have the fashion sense of a slug because only when you've been but loved by another man
Do you truly understand that you got to make do with what you got and make it really beautiful?
So if you are a little light in the loafers good for you come on over to my place tonight and we'll explore your wild side
But if you're a super homo catcher gay boy skip on down to Chico's fashion design and show the rest of the world
That just because you like to kneel doesn't mean that you can't be on top of the winner
It's 11 13 at 560 wq about tell you that whammy thing that whole operation is turned out to be a real
Weener, isn't it we have two open lives in date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the mobile one line
Here's a mobile in port Charlotte hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing?
So I'm your one list up in port Charlotte all right. I at least a living
Yeah, I just delivered Miami years ago
And I'm planning moving back believe it or not. Oh god boy. I can't imagine anybody doing that
Well, sir. I can't stand this old ass town. You don't understand this you've never been a Charlotte County apparently
I've been through it real fast. Oh god Neil. Oh, you don't blink
Don't blink if you come to this town because that you oh
Well, I'll tell you since we got back on a year and four Myers-Man and responses been
Under what I think that's the problem. I think putting us back in four Myers is what killed us
Well, you know what do you believe or not? I can pick you up in my car radio
But I listen to you more times than not. I listen to you on the internet
I am a circus circle side of the mannequin
um, yeah
And I just want to I do have a question though about this Saturday
Which board is bookstore and fundraiser bulls-rider you're gonna be at that's okay? Okay, noon to two
Noon to two okay. I just lie to okay. I just lie to okay. I just lie to okay. I just want to make sure fact
I wouldn't be surprised at all audience shows up. I wouldn't be probably 40 50 people
Well, listen you got my votes there and okay. I want to reiterate with those colors that before
I mean I was flipping channel last night myself and Ross Perot is an apple. I mean
I'm tired of Larry King bringing him on but he that little ninja makes it makes the ass
You know, if Larry King would stop putting him on he would just go away and do everybody a favor
But you know Larry. He must be alone on 50 dollars as long as 50 dollars. No way
Maybe he's gonna have Larry's baby next. Okay, pal have a great day. I'm gonna do you say bye
Okay, we have all the day lines wide open here five six seven oh five sixty
Ponet see that thing about the cue me, you know, I said here and thinking about that
There's certain play it there's certain play it there's certain play it
There's certain places where they're like an unlimited basically number of potential listeners
But when you look at the demographics of this market, you know, you got to realize that I've been here long enough
I've saturated this market in other words everybody who might ever listen to this show
They already either are listening or not is the case maybe and that's it
Because when you when you start eliminating you know just by process of elimination the enormous chunks of people who are never going to listen to this station
Or this radio show or any English language show. I mean, there's no chance those people are gone and they're always going to be gone
As opposed to being like an living and breathing place. We're almost everybody speaking in glaze
And there's a possibility that someday somehow you might actually expand your horizons and start talking to new and different breathing people
So here's a mobile and West Palm Beach. Hello, you know, this town has nothing to offer a bunch of roofs out there. Yeah
You might as well get the doggy book out and see who's breed a dog is smarter. You know, we get more response with that. I'll guarantee you that I went

He's on the periphery of like a real market
sweet water
But he's up there listening air be god damn day, but he's got nothing to say so air be called in the show is another homophobic shot

I'm having another great day in the big city right then bother me. I'll take the money. Thank you
I don't know if you've touched on it yet or I'm touching it right now with a story on the paper
I got my thumb on it. Yeah about looks like we might have to be polishing up our old
Gustaf and boots with jet bush getting support from
Really Logan that's right from one of those shards is yeah right on the front page
I mentioned that before nobody out here cares about it nobody this audience gives a crap
We got the Jewish journal endorsing jet bush the other day yesterday on yom kipper one of the greatest acts of
Blast for me in the history of the human race and today we got really Logan, which is no surprise
We already knew that because he's looking his wounds those aren't the Jews for Jesus people are they know these are the Jews for jester
Um, I was that these are the Jews for masochism
I'd also like to thank you Neil for helping me
Maybe open up my mind a little bit, which I know is the point that you're just trying to get across to a lot of people
That's uh, I've been reading a lot of books on uh, you know, on philosophy and on religion and stuff and
Just trying to get my mind made up. So let me ask you this seriously. Why is it so complicated?
Why do we need yeah, I was to come to work this morning
I was thinking about the guy that called me yesterday about Madeline O'Hara and her family like disappearing and about maybe they stole a bunch of money
Why does there need to be an American atheist organization?
I mean, I can understand you know the ACLU and organizations like Freedom from Religion Foundation that deal with legal matters that go into court to protect those from religious fanatics
I understand the need for them
But why does there have to be an atheist organization a Christian organization a Jewish organization
Well, what what does the need for it? Why can't you just believe whatever crap you want?
Just be a decent person don't bother anybody else. No harm. And that's it. What do we need all of this for?
There's nothing complicated about it
Nobody's going to heaven nobody's going to hell nobody's gonna have after life
Nobody's gonna be coming back at you. It just uh, that's it
You know the whole point was with the whole thing
Especially you really see it in the really crazy, you know Muslim religions and stuff that
That the afterlife is really crazy religions like there's some that aren't
Oh, I guess okay all religions that you got
The Jews uh, yeah with the chickens on their head in Israel yesterday waiting to for the assay
They don't understand that it doesn't work from a down from of what they didn't have it look at the way water flows
Okay, the sins of the chicken are flowing down into their bodies
That's the problem of the orthodox Jews
That's why they're crazy than a bed book the sins of the chicken are in their brains now
The whole thing was related and eventually it flows all the way down and they turn into a bunch of chickens
This is what they turn out to be you know the whole thing is it just it's to me
It seems like it diminishes the life in what we have here on earth because it doesn't mean squat when you think about eternity
I mean what what eternity isn't every ridiculous. It's called fear of death
That's exactly what you go and step on a cockroach and you start and after you stop on that thing and kill it
Better than crap you ask yourself is that thing uh making a comeback?

Because I'm not giving away those tickets yet. I don't know for sure
I'm probably not going to be here next weekend not this weekend
We got of course the big thing at the borders and then Tuesday we got the thing at pizza law
But to follow in weekend October like 9th and 10th and whatever those dates are
I'm probably going to be out of town, but there's a chance I might not be all depending
And this guy who did a very nice thing for me he turns out to be a freeloader too
Can we sit on your tape? No
The answer is no
If you do something nice for me, don't do it because you're going to like out like in a godfather, you know
You're going to come back for the funeral later on

Self-help con Joe
Resoli all those people they ask nothing and return Gary the sign man nice people
You know they don't want nothing to read what they don't want anything to return
But then it's just because I mentioned I mean she I don't want any tickets
I don't want to go to any ball games. I'm just going to lock myself in a house
Because this god damn town there is nothing there's nothing else here, but freeloaders. That's all we've got

I got nothing. How about your dog? He'd wrap a good come on. I'll take it
Jesus Christ
You can't even joke about these things
I mean god forbid that I should make a joke about those tickets and right away I wouldn't within a matter
You can't buy a god damn call all day long

How about some tickets for the NBA they're not even playing for Christ sake. Oh
Oh, you'll take them I thought you would
60 wq amp preacher shoots himself during sermon
Jacksonville a youth minister was in critical condition saturday when after accidentally shooting himself in the head
During a sermon as he waved to gun and compared Russian roulette with sin
Melvin nurse and boy he could assure you one
35 was at university medical center after shattering his skull with a blank when the
37 caliber handgun discharge
He fired and then he fell. I thought it was part of the sermon that he was supposed to fall said Anthony spate
Pastor at the living wake Christian fellowship church international
But I got up there. I stopped water the carpet the congregate said pastor. This is real something's happened
I began to pray for him and add someone called the fire station next door
Nurse had fired the gun over his head several times about it going off
So the shooting caught the congregation by surprise
He was using Russian roulette to make a point about the consequences of sin
Witnesses said the ministers said the nurse opened the gun cylinder and inserted a blank sponus cylinder
Each time he discussed a specific sin he'd repeat the same motion
Though a blank the casing still contains a hard cardboard type wide
That ejects several feet when fired police said
New police nor church members knew who owned a gun
Spate said nurse often preached about the dangers of crack cocaine and sweet car crime
But he has to give a sermon on Thursday about gun use and sin
Spate said he allowed nurse to give the sermon in lieu of a weekly Bible study session
But didn't know nurse had a gun
He was nursing it
Nurse had been preaching for a short time when he took a gun out of a small case
And referred to a passage in the New Testament book of James that deals with sin and death spate said
I think it deals with guns
Oh, they didn't have no guns back then today
Geez they couldn't have had too good of a time
No one they were always writing about sin and all that crap, huh? They didn't have no guns. Let me have it a good time

I don't want to like just chew off the end like some kind of a disgusting, you know, like
some old red neck.
Just chop off the old end, spit it out.
All the way to us, spit it out.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
You never know what you're getting into these days.
You know, you got to be real careful.
Okay, let's see.
Do a little clip here on my, on my part, doma reserve, numero, uno.
There we go.
Now I feel like a real man.
I wonder we couldn't get any goddamn calls on his short last three days.
We're smoking a bunch of bogus cigars.
How do I can people respect you when you got a bunch of crap in your mouth, huh?
Put something good in there.
Look at our deadlines.
Look at them go out as soon as I lift the stoke up.
5 6 7 0 5 60, pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line.
Or we're supposed to say Miami date County.
Maybe that'll do it, huh?
305 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on the 18 T whatever that is.
Here's Miami.
Hello.
Miami.
Okay, let's try a mobile.
It was Palm Beach.
Hello.
Hey, Neil. How you doing?
Okay, sir.
I heard you mentioned today this morning about, they're losing the red line for this game tonight.
Mm hmm.
And that's probably not going to fly.
And I hope it doesn't fly.
It's stupid.
And I'm pissed off that they're doing that again that I'm going to go to.
What a wasted time.
Well, I mean, if they want to resort to the roller hockey crap,
let them go ahead and do that to that game.
This is the real game.
Right.
Just leave it alone.
But what I wanted to ask you was, and I had heard that they were going to go back to the standard size crease.
Yeah, well, not the standard size crease.
They've chopped off the edges.
Oh, okay.
So they're going to square it up again.
It's still going to have a blue thing.
No, they're not going to, let me say it again, they're not squaring it up.
They've chopped off the edges on either side of the, uh, the, uh, uh, uh, post.
Of the wall.
Okay.
They don't have that overlap on the post.
Right.
Okay.
Now they're going to extend the back ends behind the net.
They said they're going to widen that that area.
Supposedly, they've already done that.
Really?
Yeah.
Because I'd say if you want to open up a hockey game like, you know, like the European, that's one of the changes they made this year is that they moved it.
I forget how many feet out from the, uh, from the boards.
Well, that'll work because they'll take guys like Ray with you, man.
That'll open their game wide open.
Yeah.
You know, I don't say too much about Ray Whitney.
You know, how these guys are like the other day.
I had my fingers crossed just like you, man.
Right after they signed them as like, come on, come on, don't screw this up.
But anyhow, I'm out of material meal and closing.
DJ, you're a gold-tending douchebag.
Okay, see you pal.
See you there tonight.
Okay, we have one call left in the board and then it's, uh, mo-con, baby.
Well, I guess five six seven, oh five sixty, that's our toll free number for any place in a goddamn world.
Come five sixty on the 18 to wireless life for you, uh, cell phone people.
Here's Tamarack. Hello.
Now, yes, sir.
I had some lady complaining about you at the young kick-or-service is the other day.
Good.
Incredible.
Okay, great guy with the eyes.
Guy with the eyes.
How do you like that?
That's how desperate we are.
We got the old guy with his $25 million bet that Clinton's going to get the impeach.
And then we got the guy with the eyes.
We got the guy with hockey is, uh, is soccer on eyes as a skate or whatever.
His one line is you are the most useless, the most pathetic, the most unbelievable audience in the history of the human race.
It's, it's just pathetic.
All I keep thinking about is that paycheck.
That's the only thing that drives me that forces me that continues to a cause me to go through the motions of getting into that Corvette and showing up in this place every morning and doing this exercise.
Because this week, as of this week, it ceased to be a radio show.
It's now an exercise and agonizing exercise.
One line left on the board here is a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Hello.
Mobile in Miami, yes, sir.
Hey, thanks.
Um, I think just a couple things would you continue to bash the bush, please?
Meaning jet bush, of course, because I can't stand the guy and everything you say about it.
These people don't care about jet bush, Willie Logan, the Jewish journal, no matter what I, what it is that I have to say about it, they got no retort, no response, no interest.
None. And that's why he's going to win in a landslide.
A man who's never been elected dog catcher, he's going to be the governor of the state in a landslide because these people couldn't care less.
I'm afraid you're right, but just keep on bashing the bush once a day if you don't mind.
Another thing, you know how it shows up.
I can't believe that New York, mass crazy, the cause of some down and that's supposedly the highest rated radio show.
All I got news for is the highest rated radio show in this market, two hours got an 11.8 share in the last trend that just came out and is making more money than God.
So what can I tell you how it's doing? Okay, and I guarantee that if Howard opened up the phones, I was asking for people to call him.
He wouldn't be sitting there begging and pleading and carrying on day after day with a highly rated legend show like we're doing here with one call on the board.
Just really pathetic two open lines and date all three lines in power to these people have anything to say about anything.
No, they're out of material.
We used to get guys at the end of a call and say I'm out of material. I'll see you now the whole audience collectively.
She just opened up their window and yell out the window. We're out of material. Have a great life.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T wireless line. Mobile in Miami. Hello.
Yes, sir. Hi, I don't know if you remember. I've been a guy since you a billhick a long time ago.
I was wondering if you ever got to check it out and what you thought.
Well, what do you mean check it out? What is there to check out?
Oh, well, did you I think you're a CB and a tape. He was a comedian. Are you dead now?
But who is Bill? Bill Hick. Bill Hick. Bill Hick. I thought you were talking about an old hockey player. You used to play with a Rochester Amherst.
No, no. Yeah, you mentioned that before. I'm going to have a more name.
No, I haven't checked it out, pal, but I'll get to it one of these years.
Okay, we have two open lines in date 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T line. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.
Neil. Yes, sir. I heard a promo for you this morning from you this morning. You're talking about Don and Bob's.
Yeah. You know that they recovered the Naga hide and I believe they sold it to some lawyer.
I think, but they, you know, the place you got all new Naga hide. It used to have the holes in there.
What do you mean the holes? The holes in a Naga hide. I can always think of all the high school kids using those holes.
And then they went and put a brand new cover over everything.
Yeah. The high school kids were using the holes for what?
I see your option. Yeah. I must have never said on those spots. I would say.
Oh, don't give me that needle. What? I went up my wife went to Brighton.
Well, we're going to have an argument about whether they had holes in the seats that Don and Bob's.
No, the argument is whether you ever use them or not.
Oh, whether I use the holes. Yeah, I used to use them all the time.
Okay. Okay. Thanks for the good news, sir.
What is this man talking about?
For even having assholes called in here about the Naga hide at Don and Bob's on Monroe Avenue and Rochester.
Oh, man, yet too much of that goddamn chocolate almond for a fudge frozen custard for you, pal.
We have an open line in date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eight.
I have these people speaking English. No.
What language they be speaking. They're speaking Sanskrit again today.
God.
Here did the high school kids are doing their humping the holes in the seats. Right.
You'll see this guy at Westland and his name will be in a paper next year.
I guarantee you that.
In fact, as soon as this guy walks into Don and Bob, they say we don't want you're doing.
You're looking for glory hole. Right. Here's for Lauderdale. Hello.
For Lauderdale. Meal. Yes, sir.
What would have happened is at the White House if they would have caught Quentin bending over and yes Jackson just right behind them.
Okay, we have an open line in Broward five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18th line.
I guarantee you one thing you to sure got excited. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir.
Neil, I know if you heard this or not, but that he didn't interview with Jennifer Flowers and he asked her whether or not her affair was Clinton was similar to the one that Monica had.
She thought for a second and said close, but no cigar. Yeah, I already had that fell. Oh, well, nice try.
Little late had that one was at 1863. We had that just before Lincoln. We have an open line at day five six seven oh five 60 and five five 60 on the 18th wireless line.
Here's a lady mobile in Pompano. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am. How are you? I'm doing okay. Okay. Well, I just heard you complaining about not getting any clogged in a long time.
All week long, Monday was okay. First day back from vacation Monday was fine. Mostly with reports about how George did and the rest of the week these people got no material.
None. Two of it was off. Yesterday was worse. And today is the ultimate. I don't want to call in the worst day. I just had that from vacation. Yeah, I went to Michigan and I was around Michigan State,
or something around great. Why do I just can't say hi? I love you and I'll see you borders. Okay, excellent. All right. Okay, she was just an easy balancing.
Not a bad place. Oh, by the way, manage probably is crawling because they beat a girl steam. That's right. Michigan beat this part. Well, I was away big deal.
Lost another girl steam lost an order. They're oh my god. Touchdown Jesus. There it is again right there at the end of that goddamn building on that big chrome dome.
South end. They're doing a deep knee bends in South end. I'll play that because they got a really horse ball team.
This is thanks. Real sick entire of these universities where that's all I know just like turning on this radio station here and all that Gator crap. Man, there's nothing more obnoxious that you can even smell it.
Right to the speaker in your way to what's Gator crap again. Look out.
Crawl 56 at 5 a.m. The Neil Rogers show and Fort Lauderdale. It's the bomb to two hour. Hi, V.
Shot is you got some big bucks. No, not really. So what does it mean? It's a company ticket. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? What do I think? What?

Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Hello. Yes. Me. Yes. I like your program. Uh-huh. You just tell me like this. It's a fun to be. Yes. So keep up the good.
Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. Okay. Happy. Yes. Circus. Two open lines in day one in Broward five six seven oh five 60 and pound five 60 on a mobile one line.
Here's a mobile in Delray Beach. Hello. Hey, Neil. How are you? I'm great. Good. I have a question. I never hear you talk about that TV show. The Simpson. What do you think about it? Because I don't watch it. Are you don't watch it? Why would I talk about it? Oh, I don't know. I thought maybe you just didn't want to talk about it. I'm talking about what do you mean? Don't like talking about what is there to talk about?
Nothing. I don't like to show either. I would wonder if you if you don't like to show why would you call and ask me how come I don't talk about it? No, I was asking whether you liked it. I didn't know because I don't watch cartoon shows. The only cartoon I like is bullwinkle. That's a quality work. Right. Yeah. That's good stuff. Okay. Have a great life. Okay. Oh, two open lines and date and two in Broward. In other words, Desperado with 55 minutes to go. Can he make it till two?

But anyway, I just wanted to let you know she had a Brian Trump or sail 75 cents portion. Oh, you don't want to put those on your bagels. Well, they had a couple of people come in there. Looks like locks. Let's have a couple portions of that. Please and came out with the Brian should you can't eat that?

Neil, how you doing? Okay, sir. Well, we needed this town is another threat of a non hurricane to shake everybody up. I think that's what the problem is. I think these people are like all spent from the energy that they put out last week.
Now, but I'll tell you I mean I called Georgia a couple times. He did your proud and it was I guarantee he didn't have to beg shamelessly for calls like this all week last week.
Yeah, no, he didn't. No, he didn't. He did. No, only Thursday because there's a hurricane. But the rest of the week there's no hurricane going on today. And you know, I'm kippers all over with. I, you know, I'm not that slow. I am. I'm on to what's going on here.
Well, I'll tell you I'm 23 years as a 22 and a half years in one place as long enough. It's time for me to move on. I'll tell you this place is dead. I mean, it's so depressing. I call
the train. I'm going to tell you some I go to the track last night. I realize it was, you know, young kipper and I'm sick and tired of these funny. All super religious Jews who want to do a days of the year become religious.
That was like a muscle. Lee in their last night. So we could have gotten bowling on the fourth floor at Pompo Park last night. That's how pathetic. I mean, call the other say I mean, even though call the not that great, but whatever. I mean, I got that handcat off yesterday on your kipper. So we could go out and get the handle up there and called her. You try dastardly mesh. Yeah, I don't remember.

Just move back from Texas. Yeah, bad move. Yeah, I realize that now. I was wondering what good horse tracks do you recommend around here?
Meaning what? What kind of race? Good racetrack. We'll play some money or something. Good race tracks for what? The horse race. Therapeutic racing. There's only one over at a time. She can go to call her for the third reds. Go to Pomato Park for harness racing. That's it. That's it. Yeah. Oh, man. Oh man. One. Now what's going on? Just dead. Meaning what? How many race tracks do you want to have opened at the same time? How much are going to lose all in one day? They got simultaneously from 600 different tracks all at the same time. Go fund your brains out, pal. Or blow up.
One of the other. Welcome back. We have an open line at Broward and all of date County, all 400 lines in date five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the mobile one line. I'm going to tell you Tuesday, Wednesday and three quarters of this show on Thursday. These three days, I've talked to more assholes. These three days. Then the last three years put together and that's saying a lot. That's covered a lot of goddamn territory for this show. Three days, not even three full days. And I've talked to more no life, low life people would not
think to say with absolutely no ability at verbal intercourse whatsoever. And I'm almost starting to enjoy it. Dade County, but Dave County, I don't enjoy because it's only on this radio station. This is a cancer or in date County. We're close to the county. I'm thank God for in date County. Do we have any audience in date County? Are the Jamaicans listening to Cuban's listening to the Venezuelans? Listen to the banana boat people. The Haitians listening. They're so on baseball. Did you use the four of more life? No. They're still doing. They're still nailing the mazes is up on the
door. 5 6 7 0 5 60 and pound 5 60 on a mobile one line. Mobile implantation. Hello. Hello, Nielsen. I wanted to talk about specialization last 10 years. Have you noticed where these doctors are getting more and more specialized for specific parts of the body? Right. Go in there. I got to maybe up on the big toe and just be the doctor. Wait. That's on the right foot. You need to see the other. He's a spec. I think I found out specializing is going on.
I found out that there is a hydrologist. Can you imagine the weatherman on the weather channel saying, oh, we're going to go to our hydrologist to get the rain predictions? I mean, what are they going to have a small
car? I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

Hey, Zoe, where are you guys coming to this class? Super Uh-Ring in the room.ide of water, see you guys...
As have been on the internet, I had empieza a short way, and our hands were hairy.
It's alone not being able to sell its house for 27.5 million.
Who?
You got to...slice, alone.
Yeah.
The same asshole as yesterday.
Okay, we have an open line in Broward, two of them, and all of a day.
One call on the board. One lonely call after this asshole.
I call yesterday with the same week material.
Oh, well, this time was clear enough I could understand it.
Thank you very much, sir, for getting a better phone.
56670560 and pound 560 on the mobile one line.
Here's the Fort Lauderdale, hello.
Here's a mobile in Cooper City, hello.
Oh, hi, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Did you touch on...I don't have a lot of stuff.
I touched it.
Did you touch on the damn Quizz and Berry Dying today?
Who?
Dan Quizz and Berry used the pitch for the Kansas City Royale.
Oh, yeah, he died at the age of 45.
I saw it.
Well, when you see that I touch on it, what is there to discuss?
Well, I'll just be glad.
He had a brown thing or something.
Yeah, he was a super pitcher.
And Neil, I'm just trying to call it a failure board, buddy.
Okay, thanks a lot.
You're welcome, sir.
And to say how to Dan.
Well, you know, he's in that big baseball diamond in the sky somewhere.
He's up there with the jury diamond up there in the sky.
We have an open line in Dave.
One in a row.
At 5.6.7.0.5.60.5.60 on him.
I guess what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to go back to polls.
We'll have to come up with topics like bandage killed four hours yesterday.
I knew.
I knew what he was doing at.
It was really a different drag.
Four hours on how come you're not watching Monday at football anymore.
How come the ratings are not what they used to be, etc.
And so on.
When in four seconds you could say,
because the game is tough.
That's why.
Because people don't want to watch a crappy product.
There you go.
Here's a mobile in Kendall.
Hello.
Any odds of going.
Okay.
All right. I guess nobody's in Miami is just a quick response.
I guess there's still scared of a jury still coming by.
Hurricane George.
There's been scared by Branko across there anyway.
I wanted to touch upon what was it that happened about baseball.
What's happened with a Dave County's open 5.6.7.0.5.60.
on a mobile one line.
It's so you keep putting that same jackass on over and over.
That's one of yours again.
You think of me the same one.
They're all the same.
They're all it's one person.
Okay.
It's one person in about 50 million different bodies.
It's all the same little person.
Here's Tamarack. Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
A few weeks back you were talking about an issue.
Travel leisure magazine with the top cities to visit.
Yes sir.
I wasn't the top cities to visit it was the top cities in the world.
Allegedly, here we are.
You know, we're going to get that.
I was at San Evan, the public's when Dixie Eckers, Walgreens,
and went to a new stand today and I couldn't get it.
I did see a travel leisure magazine today but it said fall and winter issue.
I thought you said it was like a September issue.
Yeah, whatever.
Well, whatever one is out now.
That's the one that it's in.
Okay, because you know, you wasn't on the cover.
Did you look on the cover?
What did it say?
Yeah, it didn't say anything about that.
Then you ride a look.
Okay, can't get it.
We have an open line in Broward all in Dade County, all 20 or 500 lines in Dade.
5, 6, 7, I'm not going to do this.
I'm going to play some music, relax, do some of my commercial breaks.
I worked my ass off these three days.
I've done about 600 days work in these last three days.
Is it been worth it?
No.
Of course not.
Me talk about the inverse proportion of, you know, something in and something out.
You've been so good to me.
Oh yeah.
This world where mine.
I'd give you the flowers.
The birds end up being.
I'm just sitting here, standing in my mind.
It's connected.
You'll be being up there.
You to come.
I'd give you anything.
Why, it's connected.
I beat dynamite up there.
But baby.
So I'm sitting here with my microphone open and I think on the ears, is on the ear out there.
What is it, David?
Danny wants to answer what?
Danny wants to dance for me?
No.
The shoes on too, what?
It's the TV show when you come right down to it.
It's, I don't want to get them up sick because they're already like on the way out.
They're already all, yeah, just an inch away from the unemployment line.
And of course we are going to have a real bad recession, guys.
I don't want to get you depressed.
I don't want to get you like down and out and hit you below the belt when it really hurts the most.
But you know, it's what it is.
Because they're phasing us out there on whammy.
We're phasing us out here on Q&A.
The audience is phasing me out of their lives and I can understand, I can relate to it.
I still got a few nickels to rub together.
126 is 5K.
We have an open line, a date one and an an anemobo one line.
Here's a mobile in line.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
I don't want to be a chronic.
This is the third time I've called since you came over to QAM.
Yeah.
Okay, that doesn't qualify me as a chronic.
No, it sure doesn't.
Well, in the midst of all the excitement about the hurricane, Rick Fancho has had a classic line as only he can have.
Yeah, thank God it wasn't a human's, yeah.
That was an economic problem.
Something like that.
He said that after we've had 600 reports on it.
I don't want to get a feel bad, but we've heard it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay, don't be sorry.
Are you going to go to borders anytime soon?
No.
No?
No.
Okay, thanks.
Okay, we have two open lines in date two and anemobo.
56670560, don't forget we'll be in borders by the gallery and four-letter day.
This is Saturday, noon to two.
And pizza love next to the October 6th, 6th, 8th, VM.
Call me again in three years, pal.
Here's a lady in Miami.
Hello.
Lady in Miami.
Hello.
Yes?
Hello, is Neal on?
Speaking.
How are you today?
Okay.
Just wanted to give you a little prediction.
Yes?
This is the first time I called you.
Uh-huh.
And we just want to say that we know that the Christian, the Christian moral majority will get you off the air.
Oh, really?
Yeah, this year.
This year?
Yeah.
How are you going to do that?
Ah, because the Christians are the majority.
Well, what the Christian majority, so called, has been trying to get me off the air for 20 years.
You know what?
I'm still here, sweetheart.
We.
We haven't given up yet.
You haven't given up?
Well, let me ask you something.
Why don't you find something better to do?
Like, go help some starving people.
Go feed some of the homeless people.
How do you know I don't?
I'm positive you don't, because if you're busy listening to the show every day,
worried about getting radio shows off here, you don't have time to be doing anything productive.
Oh.
I'm a good Christian lady.
I'm a good Christian lady.
No, you sound like a bigoted bitch to me.
Oh.
Oh.
Yes?
You don't think you won't be off the air by then, do you?
I guarantee you, but your life on it that I won't.
Well, we'll see what the Christian majority can do.
Oh, we'll see what that was.
The Christian majority, because I've never quite heard that term before.
I've heard of the moral majority.
I've heard of the Christian coalition.
I've heard of the American Family Association.
The Florida family is a...
The Christian majority.
Is that something you just made up in your mind?
The Christian moral majority.
Oh, the Christian moral majority.
The Christian oral majority?
Oral majority?
Oral.
Yes.
Yeah?
Oral, is that what you said?
No.
Yes, you do.
I didn't say that.
You take it up the...
Breakfast room.
You also do that?
You're very mad.
No, I just want to know the truth.
That's all the truth.
You'll set you free.
Oh, okay.
You enjoy sex in the breakfast room.
No.
You don't?
No.
Well, maybe you'll try it.
No.
Oh, yes.
No.
I think so.
Why do you say that?
You know what it says in the Bible?
Those who say, uh...
No.
What they really mean is...
Uh-huh.
That's not true.
That's what it says right there in Leviticus.
Where?
Roy, right on the first page.
Uh-huh.
You better go read your Bible, sweetheart.
You don't know crap.
The Christian moral majority.
Right, we're going to get you off the ear.
It took like 30 seconds to get her to untwist the phone
from her thing before I could finally get her to say hello.
There you go.
Dave County's wide open fives.
That's what we get from Dave County.
That's our contribution from Dave County today.
Oh!
That bitch.
566-705-60 and pound 560 on the mobile one line.
I'm going to show up tomorrow just in spite of you, okay, honey?
Here's a mobile in Hollywood.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Look, I want to tell you about the biggest shambles
that were pulled by Wolley Logan.
You know, there was another Wolley Logan for the politicians.
And this one, the rent out of Opharata.
They never had a meeting.
They never had a personal appearance.
And he got a look on the other men's names.
He can hear about Opharata.
Yeah.
He never had a meeting.
Well, I'll send it back to Opharata.
It's a good place for him, okay?
Him and the abushmyster.
Max made in heaven.
We have an open line.
And Dave wanted to be rowered.
566-705-60, pound 560 on the mobile one line.
Here's a mobile in sunrise.
Hello.
Hey, maybe that lady earlier should get in the wreck.
Maybe she'll be a little happier.
No, she's taken in the wreck.
Don't worry about that.
You think so.
All those Christians, they love it.
Yeah, well, the jury from the majority said you're going to stay.
So that's more important down here.
Yeah, I can talk about the response this week.
I'm going to stay, Max.
Don't be thinking about that.
I was curious if you went to any of the Panther exhibition again.
I'm going tonight.
Did you go to the one before?
No, I did not.
I went out of town.
Did you get the seat on TV at all?
They're not on TV.
No.
I was curious how Sean Berks planned.
Yeah, let me say this to you.
With all due respect.
How guys play any guys play in the exhibition game?
Means absolutely nothing.
Yeah, they're trying to pedal us a big song in a dance.
You do realize now that Kevin Weeks has gone up to play in the Canada,
the Canadian national team, because they haven't been able to sign them.
And as Agent wants ridiculous amounts of money.
So really what they're stuck with now, they got Sean Berk and Kirk McLean.
Berk and Jerk is what they got in gold.
And I'm going to tell you something.
We got real problems.
We're going to be letting a lot of puck.
That's right.
Thank you.
Okay, good luck to us.
I mean, I realized that they would like to have made some other deal.
They thought they had Richter.
They thought they had Poppant.
They thought they thought V and you always think something and jump in the
Come Shop and don't happen.
And they're going to make you a big song in the dance about Sean Berk.
And yeah, he's one of those guys who for a couple of games here,
a couple of games there, very impressive and give you the idea that hey,
this guy's really something as opposed to Kirk McLean who once in a while might
play a really good game, but not very often.
And that's what they got.
And they kept telling us they were going to approve the gold tending,
to which we say, yeah, right.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
No, yes, sir.
Hey, I knew you were used to Republican.
You know what I'm voting Democrat this year.
Great.
Okay.
Congratulations, amigo.
And we're tracing the call.
They'll be coming after you.
We have an old effect that lady, that Christian lady because Christian Republican
is synonymous now in America.
She'll be coming after you, sir, and showing you what's for.
She'll get your ass off the year.
5 6 7 0 5.
That's right.
You'll get his show off the guy damn air before she gets ours off.
5 6 7 0 5 6 the in pound 5 60.
They Christian moral majority.
Good old Christians, baby.
Christian bigot.
Is that what you're saying, lady?
Good old bigot and Christian because as soon as they start talking Christian,
you know what they're talking about.
Hate.
That's right.
We hate this one.
We hate that one.
We don't like what you say.
Therefore, we're going to censor.
We're going to get you off because we can't handle the truth.
Because we should be the only ones to propagandize in Philly, a public with all our bull crap.
Nice going, sweetheart.
Crap.
And by the way, don't get sore about it.
Crack go, no they're either.
20.
