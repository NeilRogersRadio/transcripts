Sport radio 560 Wanderway every coming out. No.
Waterdale presents the Neil Rogers show to talk to Neil called 560.
And then there's that for the signal to the Tonya. No.
For the Emperor or pound 560.
Okay, here you go.
There's the opinions of Neil. His guests call is there.
Anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM easily read acquisitions
or the Beasley broadcast group.
No.
Now Neil Rogers on Sport Radio 560 QAM.
No.
No.
No.
Talking on a sports show.
Trying to be my show.
Your voice sounds good like a seven year old girl.
A little sports show.
What else are you there for?
Chelsea.
Chelsea.
Talking like a baby.
Who needs a little training?
Oh, I can feel understand.
You don't sound like a man.
Reboots of rubber bands.
That joke.
Your throat comes.
Chelsea.
Chelsea.
Oh.
Chelsea.
Your lucky management.
Chelsea.
You don't belong there on the air.
And Chelsea.
The sport can wait till your voice cracks.
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.
If they should only take you back when both your baby's dropped.
Chelsea.
Chelsea.
When you're gone and grow up.
You make a lot of throw up.
You silly, squeaky, blue.
Go to broadcasting school.
Your free to visit boys.
Thank you.
Now I talk.

That's power.
Then I'll present.
I'm the most powerful god day man in the world.
Yes.
I am.
Neil.
Neil.
That's power.
Then I'll present.
I'm the most powerful god day man in the world.
So is the correct.
The burgers are made out of people.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I'm sick of everything.
Just that taste of smell.
How do you feel?
Well, 86% of newborn boys in this country are sick of size.
They procedure as widely performed without any sort of anesthesia.
I have no precution.
I'm dead on it.
Oh, it's just Neil.
Oh, it's just Neil.
Oh, it's just Neil.
I need you to find me.
Oh, it's Neil.
Neil.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hi, Neil.
Hi, Neil.
Hi, Neil.
I will ask you tonight's blockbuster.
Ready other companies that perpetuate this kind of behavior.
Check out the economy.
You're spurping.
Look, Neil.
It's an all-general product.
Sure.
I don't have a bones for dogs.
You're high, eh?
I know that before you work or you're righteous.
Father, old school.
God.
Damn, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Mr. Mary, you have to see this.
No, God.
Just a liquor.
How's that hand job?
Something on hand.
Oh, he has no feet.
He doesn't do much of it as well when I'm not.
He doesn't.
That is great radio.
I am that hemorrhage.
I only have a longer cord than a piece of crap.
Look at this.
How sure is this damn thing?
I'm going to pick this cord and I'm going to shove it right up his neck.
OK, Neil.
This place operates like a freak.
It's not how it really does.
I want to be left a freak alone, OK?
I'm not man and I'm the sixth grader boy.
That they made.
Look, particularly.
Oh, boy.
Kill, kill.
Oh, see, that's their fate.
Oh, there's a winner.
That's the path again.
I'm there.
Kill.
Kill.
Kill.
Kill.
More power than a ill-president, man.
I'm the most powerful god damn man in the world.
So is the correction.
1045-60WQM.
Merry Christmas from all your friends here at QIM and from us too.
And we're going to, man, you talk about playing the rack.
We're going to play stuff you haven't heard in a Koon's age.
All kinds of good stuff today between now and two o'clock.
Because it's a holiday god damn it.
So I'm at the hockey game last night.
Was that really a hockey game?
No.
I'm there last night.
And my good friend Howard Kleinberg.
And so there's two of the fine people in this town, by the way,
two of my favorite people, Mr. Mrs. Howard Kleinberg.
They're the good people, damn it.
Yes.
So anyway, Howard comes over to me and he's giving me a song of dance
about how sick he was.
He had a little hip problem.
Now he's doing great.
Thank god.
And so he says to me, so they're really blowing out the first team, huh?
I said, yes.
So anyway, I mean, it's just, it's amazing, you know.
So let's just keep in guessing, okay?
Are they really?
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Maybe you'll just have to keep listening, huh?
Let's play that game like they tried over the way that babbling broke.
Let me say it again.
I have no problem.
I'll publicize anybody on any other station.
Because we have no fear.
We're not concerned.
We're not the least bit concerned that Brook is going to like give Hank any stiff competition
otherwise.
In fact, I'm sure he's like kissing the ground that they put that babbling brook on in the afternoon.
What wonderful competition.
Anybody could only pray for that.
God, I can answer to anybody's prayers, right?
Yes.
So anyway, I'd speak on the game last night.
I have just a few brief comments.
It's the holidays.
I don't want to put like a negative spin on anything.
Although there is a little negativity in the paper here this morning.
Finally, it says in the hockey column, this is in the scum stand also must be that fat Michael Russo.
He says the new building is trying to work out.
It's never ending kinks.
Maybe they can have the kinks in concert there, huh?
Yes.
The sound coming out of the loudspeakers continues to be either too loud, too low or too mumbled almost all the time.
And then the middle of the play plays periodically.
The horn sounds quickly creating confusion on the ice.
There you go.
Holy at the macarena, baby.
The National Carvebeckle Center.
We're the only arena in the world that has these extra added coupements, okay?
No extra charge.
You know, before the game, and there's poor kids that I have no ideas from the young hockey players,
and budding, you know, future NHL stars, they're out there giving them an award for whatever.
And the PA,
and if you're life depended on it, you couldn't understand the word that this guy is saying.
If they held it, oozy up your ass.
You couldn't decipher what this poor bastard saying on the PA.
And yes, the horn does come in there, which is good because it kind of wakes us up a little bit every now and then.
I think that's what it's for.
Kind of a wake up sound.
Yes.
Right.
But poor, that was in it.
The first time in the new arena, I will probably say that I left early.
I mean, real early.
Once a Washington score, there's second goal with about five minutes left in the second period.
Got up, made a B line out of that joint.
Am I a please that I did that?
Yes.
You bet.
Oh, man.
Talk about a coma.
But anyway, did not listen.
I just want to say this and I really mean it.
I'm not going to carry on about the fact that the red light you can't see it from where we are when the goal is scored the and about the offense.
I don't give a sh** me more.
That's right.
I mean, you are what you are.
Like they said in Godfather 3, was it?
Yeah, when he said the Vincent, he said you are what you are.
A piece of the thing that to the gay son.
No, well, that was the other story.
That was off camera.
But at any rate, so we are what you are.
That's the so called fans.
They have no clue.
If you listen to the conversation that's going on around.
Yeah, we got to have still bars.
What team is he on now?
Who's on that tape?
Yeah, right.
They know from nothing.
But their favorite.
See, I've discovered what the problem is they really don't want to see hockey.
They want to see they want to do all the stuff I talked about the wave and they look up on the scoreboard and they want to see the WWF.
Or they want to see, you know, Mike Tyson choose somebody zero off.
They want to see boxing, wrestling.
They want to see brawling.
That's what maybe a little mud wrestling.
That's what they want to see, right?
There you go.
Because they've got a major Peter problem at the Macarena.
A big black guy named Peter.
I'm going to tell you this guy.
There were showing pictures in between periods of the different players with a little Christmas messages.
And, you know, here's Ray Whitney up there and here's Billy Lindsay.
You know, here's guys that you could like a lot.
And here's Peter Warrant.
And then of course, what he got into one of his 18 brawls during the game, including one which he didn't get a penalty for,
which is very bizarre, but nevertheless.
And when he, you know, he's picking up his glove and his stick and the holding in,
three sitting ovation on the same penalty.
They're obsessed.
They really believe that this is a hockey player.
And like I said, I don't give a shot.
And if that's your idea of what is a hockey player, then good luck to you, okay?
And that just reinforces what I said the other day.
Yeah, we just ought to have the grab ass out there.
Everybody party and get up, run around.
You have to worry about standing in front of other people.
Forget the game, okay?
In fact, we can have a little, what we'll do is we'll have a bunch of big black guys beating the crap out of each other out there.
Right in the middle of the adjoin, huh?
I was going to say the middle of the ice, but we would melt the ice because the refrigeration caused the fortune.
So we want to save away in the 31 million bucks for the salaries.
And also that refrigeration system just shut that baby down, baby.
Shut it off.
Yeah, I'm serious.
Not a good idea.
Yeah, I thought they called that box.
No, no, not boxing.
No, they want to see, that's why they do like boxing because it's usually two big black guys beating on each other.
And they love that.
White guys love it.
But just, I mean, just a free for all, not boxing.
No rules, you know, just beating a living crap, maybe, you know, bringing each other like to the edge of death, maybe like into a coma.
They would love it.
Oh!
So that's my idea for the new year for the Immacurate of the National Carrectal Center.
A putrid performance last night, by the way, boys.
Everybody's stuck to join out.
There wasn't one player on our team.
That even Ray Whitney stuck to join out.
Everybody on the play.
I mean, you guys were brutal.
It was pathetic.
Little warming here, by the way.
Isn't it just me?
That'd be you.
That'd be me for you.
You have poisoned myself with that.
You have poisoned myself with all that rig because they had to kill about 400 ants in here already this morning.
Which is kind of nice that you work for a company, especially a Christmas time that can't afford an exterminator.
Yes.
No, stop!
Yes.
It's made in the evening.
The pathers have lost again.
So I'm looking for doggy.
Some things I must say to him.
And when I find him.
Before I punch out his life.
I say you asshole.
You coached very bad tonight.
You coached very bad because you didn't listen to your uncle bill.
He's the endless eye.
The real McCoy.
And you watch us stop peace of hand from Canada.
Oh, Canada, Tom.
I've died in an old life here.
Hey beer drinkers.
Do you find that your beer not only fills you up, it binds you up.
Yes.
You need a beer that will help you loosen up.
Introducing the beer that not only tastes great, it packs a mega high fiber wallet.
It's the first beer that's also a laxative.
We call it Shats.
As a T.A.T.
A Poster V.S.
Shats.
All the cats get their hats to the man who's drinking Shats.
The man who needs some fibers is true and fair.
When the chef and the chef are not just number one, the chef is always number two.
Hi, I'm Phil Throne from a Shats group.
Before yourself, a chef.
And see why it's making a splash all over the country.
Shats, the laxative beer.
Shats is rude with the highest quality hops in barley.
Then we add our secret ingredient, whole-turned-tone.
Not too much, just a pinch.
Every chat beer is certified with 12 essential vitamins, so you're always guaranteed a good healthy Shats.
Shats is available in the 6th-ounce little squirt or the 64-ounce pig logger.
And every chat is paper to one end, so your can won't slam Shats.
We here at Shats are satan by the recent passing of Adolf Shats, founder of the Shats Family Brewery,
better known as the Old Brick Shats.
In fact, Adolf loved his beer so much, his last wish was to be interred in a giant fat of Shats.
So come on, when it's time to take a load off, crack open a chat.
You will say the parade calls for you to leave this all in its way.
Oh, no bullpen, I kill that, or you'll hear.
Give us shots of pop and soon you'll hear a pop.
Shats is making chairs for other pigs.
Don't just take any beer, take us shots.
And for you T-toddlers, try our new high fiber non-alcoholic beer.
We call it O-stool.
O-stool.
A sample one today.
And don't forget Shats' light, Shats' dark.
And for those with diverticulitis, proctitis and polyphosis, doctors direct them to try new Shats' red.
Shats' red, a division of fricking the ministry's flushing new.
Okay, 1017, if you think that's disgusting, wait for your names of these octoplets.
I didn't realize that these were dark, complex people down there in Houston.
That we're doing the fertility thing and had a litter of 600 babies.
The world's only living octoplets were given names on Wednesday in the tradition of their parents African tribe.
Time right in, well, what we just be talking about here a few days ago on this show.
We're always timing, we're always right on top of it.
The hospital had been identifying the children by letters of the alphabet.
Since seven of them arrived Sunday by a cesarean section, the first child was born on December 8th to IYKE, a Yiki Lewis Udobe, left and his wife, Nikkem Chukwa.
Chukwu, MKEM, CHU, KWU.
The couple said they named the children the tradition of the Igbo tribe.
The major ethnic group in their native Nigeria, Nigeria.
We want to honor God and celebrate his gifts to us in the names we give our eight children.
The couple said in the statement, Lewis is the surname for all eight.
Also on Wednesday, police confirmed that the octoplet's father had been charged in September.
He had been charged in September with domestic assault after an incident in which he allegedly struck his mother-in-law during an argument with his wife.
These charges are bogus that is attorney Rick Castlebury, a crowd for Lewis's set for February.
Thank God for those fertility drugs.
Thank the Lord for that.
Texas Children's Hospital where the babies remained in critical condition with 85% chance for survival.
Released their names, translations and given nicknames.
Baby A born almost two weeks before her siblings and is Chukwu, Chukwu, Buka, Nikme, Gika,
which means God is great. She'll be called Ibuka.
Not to be confused with Ibuka.
Baby B, the first of the seven Sunday deliveries is Chidnima Anulika, which means God is beautiful.
Chidi is her nickname.
How you be doing, Chidi?
Baby C is Chinaturem, Noabbugu, Noabbugu, or God thinks of me in English.
The churnic name is Eturem.
Baby D is Chinai-Jem-Otito, meaning God knows my way.
Chinta will be her nickname.
Thank God for that.
Was not that chinta?
Baby E, who's birth weight was just 10.3 ounces in the most delicate condition, is Chijindu Chideira, translated to God has my life.
Her nickname is Odera.
Baby F, the first of two boys, is Chukwu Bukum, Maabubuchi, meaning God is my strength.
His nickname is Icom.
I like Icom.
Baby G, the largest baby of 1.60 ounces, will be Chijokhe Chidenum, Chinatum, no, wait a minute.
Chijokhe Chinatum, meaning God is my leader. His name is Jaioki.
Keep this in mind for all your future NFL fans, okay?
And Baby H, the last out of the woman, the sixth girl, is named Chinagurom Chidiaburi, meaning God is merciful.
Her nickname is Gorom.
There you go.
Beautiful.
That really makes me feel a lot better about that story.
Okay, anyway, speaking of stories in the news, even though it is the holidays, they're happy to share this really exciting news with you.
Teacher of the Year quits lied about felony.
The former Catholic priest lied.
Can you believe this?
Former Catholic priest lied.
There's no fact in the church.
About his molestation conviction when he applied to teach at Palm Beach Community College.
On Friday, the day he was to receive Teacher of the Year honors at Palm Beach Community College, a horticulture instructor resigned after official learned he lied on his job application after being convicted a convicted child molester.
Walter M. Weirts, 63, a former Catholic priest, was sentenced to six years in Illinois State Prison in 1986.
After putting guilty to three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving boys between the ages of 12 and 16.
The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office is investigating Weirts after receiving a complaint that a young boy from New Mexico was staying at Weirts' home.
Might have been abused, Sheriff Sergeant Jim Storm said on Wednesday.
The boy has returned home and charges are unlikely because in an interview, the boy had with the Mexico authorities turned up no evidence of a crime.
Weirts who taught at Palm Beach Gardens campus could not be reached for comment.
College officials said they believe he has left the state.
I can't imagine why, but he has left the state and the building.
Oh!
There you go.
By the way, that's for our friend John and Lake Worth.
Thank you, John.
And you're welcome for our plane at Bob and Tompet.
Also, if that isn't enough here to let kind of temper your enthusiasm for the holidays, here's another great story.
Youth group leader charged with abuse.
Police say sex activity went on for three years this out of St. Petersburg, a worldwide boys organization.
Received complaints about one of their youth group leaders, but allowed him to continue working with teens in his paper reported.
Leaders of Dmo Lane, a year ago, that John Shirley never trust your kids with a guy named Shirley.
John Shirley took a picture of his youth group, mooning his camera at a Masonic camp to St. Pete Times reported.
In the last week, at least 11 boys in Shirley's youth group, had told police that Shirley gave them alcohol and drugs,
fondled them or had sex with them, and watched them masturbating in the St. Petersburg apartment.
He was arrested December 16.
Most of these sexual activities that happened over a period of three years, including this year,
according to a rest report, Dmo Lane organization that is included among its members, John Wayne and Walter Cronkite.
Oh!
Fireturing last month after St. Petersburg police began a criminal investigation.
After the mooning incident, leaders at Dmo Lane headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri, were told about the pictures which were passed around at the good old lodge.
So, Murray Christmas, in a father or two of Christchurch's stick, anything you're in, Mausoleco.
He started out a regular guy who joined the erectory and made the ultimate sacrifice and racing celebrity, a plausible tool.
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Oh, it's him!
It's between the time!
K-27 and 560 W-3 M-3G was just something almost choked at at the Christmas party.
How come you didn't tell me that story? You didn't know about it.
Huh?
So he told me about it. He said he was gagging on it. I forgot. And the bay leaf too.
But it anyway, did I say 10-27 and 560 W-Q-A-M?
This is 560 Q-A-L.
It works for the large and in the basket.
No, we call that stuff, man. Boba Venus.

My cousin's back and he's co-ranced contemplating.
You know, the diamond just wasn't my style.
I began working nights now near your janitor in this whole office building.
Just to keep busy, I guess, because I'm a baseball old man.
And I'm waiting.
Okay, there's the big cheese now.
How you doing tonight?
Hey, what's going on later?

When you know I got all my work done.
Oh, really?

You can drive me.
Anything.
No, no.
I'll give my car keys.
Why don't you clean up my car?
I got a wick at standing in the backseat.
Yeah, I've got a different stuff in front of me.
I can clean it up with us.
I'll be back in about two hours and maybe I'll bring you a piece of pizza.
Okay, Dad?
Well, Dad, listen, thanks a lot.

Nothing you can let anyone to paint your second boobs during your things could face this method brought to you by the National Curseing Foundation.
And remember our motto.
Go f*** yourself.
Ow!
Oh, right!

Doc and Simon, just like our suits, with eyes of my nose and expanding to where all don't man.
I'm a dumb man.
Here all don't man.
I'm a dumb man.
Now he on top of it.
We're from the show.
What's written once?

We just said no.
We're good on our path.
Don't try to fight.
We'll make white water.
We'll feel demand.
We're right in hand.
Some of us better support.
We're just helps.
And also sign up on our own.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's get it up for now.
We're from the show.
We're taking up six times.
From the show.
Whoa!
We're taking up four years.
We're from the show.
We're from the show.
We're from the show.
That's a little more new home.
One nine five at the local back store.
On the end you could add four more to the turtle.
Yeah, do the turtle.
All right.
That's that's that's your ever gone home.
Well, when we got here it's Richard Geer with the turtle
and the tube and the mattress here do the turtle.
Do the turtle.
That's that's that's your ever gone home.
You could have a puppy.
You could have a pussy cat.
But when you got a turtle you'll know where it's at.
If one out the floor choose the one with the night is clawed to the turtle.
To the turtle.
Wow, that's damn bad.
Don't have a water hole.
You friends and actors who come from the UK.
Charming and pleasant in a quite friendly way.
A sense of humor to make someone chuckle.
I saw who they got women's easing buckhoops.
You was caught by copping Hollywood.
They say that he was up to no good.
Fans on that crying he caused the big mob when you got a hooker and got a blow job.
Get a hooker and get a blow job.
All right.
In the back he cheered down on his knob.
Stop broke it up they saw her head bob when you got a hooker and got a blow job.
Raise your English known as sex they drink too much tea.
Unless you're part of the royal family.
But you rest not like that he's no evil snob so he got a hooker.
He got a blow job.
Get a hooker and get a blow job.
In the back he cheered down on his knob.
Stop broke it up they saw her head bob when you got a hooker.
They got a blow job.
That was the most you've ever had.
You got a blow job.
Yeah you got a blow job.
He was a hooker.
He just got a hooker.
I was just so out of sync with you.
They loved the game early last night when homelwatch the rest of that depressing hockey game expecting fully here.
Rumors say they put the biscuit in the basket but it never happened because they stopped.
That's right.
Oh it was brutal.
Nice job there by the way Neil.
Nice choice leaving early.
Good.
Okay by the way our total for cent of one is 122,874.
So we're right on the precipice of 123,000 and is the van going out to the air not?
Yes.
Well you said that kind of like in a very...
Yes.
...in a very enthusiastic way.
So the van is going out.
Are they going to commercial in the federal highway?
Like we should did like the...
No.
Yeah where they going?
They're going to the east side marios which is sort of in front of the adventure mall.
I bet very very busy.
They're obsessed with a guy named Adventurimall.
They're at the very busy location.
It's a very busy location but that's not where our audience is.
Well you talk about over there must be some hot chicks that they're looking to get numbers from or something in that area.
Because that is not where the audience is.
This Adventurim thing they're obsessed with it.
I mean our new balanced people are an Adventurim.
We love them.
Ben and Jerry is their an Adventurim.
We love them profusely.
But other than that...
Is there anybody even we even know an Adventurim?
No.
There you go. I rest my case.
But well they'll go out there and we'll give you all the details that'll be there in a little while.
I don't understand these guys but I don't want to go all the way out there east and port Lauderdale on quite frankly who can blame them.
So we're going to be playing the rack playing all kinds of good stuff.
Maybe I'll take color too.
I don't know.
Because you know the cause yesterday?
They really did.
Now what's all these rumors I'm hearing this morning on the worst team I'm driving in right before I turned it off
about how rumors signed his new deal last night.
And these are going to be the voice of the Panthers run to you.
How come they're hearing about it?
I'm not hearing about it.
I mean they've been telling me that he was negotiating and was right on the verge of it.
And so all of a sudden they're breaking the big news on the worst team on a show that's going off the year.

They stuck.
Twenty before 11 and 560 WQIN.

Since the 70s revival it's a common scene in many doctors offices.
You gotta tell me please, why can't I dance?
Well I'm afraid you have white man in gyros.
White man in gyros.
A tragic affliction causing so many to give up trying to get down.
Stand alive or have a stand alive?
The symptoms are easy to spot.
The inability to snap your fingers or clap your hands anywhere near the beat of music.
Why?
They're just saving you.
They're stinging causes and instant gag reactions to all those standing next to you.
Oh my God.
And of course when you're out no one wants to stand next to you.
Hi guys.
Wait, wait up.
Wait up.
Wait up.
We could say there's hope for white man in gyros but there is it.
We only recommended course of action in rhythmic abstinence.

We've changed the rides to suit our lifestyle.
Yo, ho, ho, be a splash bugler on butt-pirate to the Caribbean.
And we've modified the tunnel of terror so you can ride with Mickey's new domestic partner, Gerald Gell.
Hey, it's Gerald Gell here.

Oh, boy, I was the bitch.

And I remember it like it was only yesterday.
Hey, Gellie, let's play a game.
What?
Just sort of gotten my bucket.
A piece of candy.
Hey, I'm guarded by a snake.
Let's go.
Grandpa, I don't want to play this game anymore.
Who's gay?
Let's play, play the candy and the crevice.
Oh, Grandpa, I don't always know when you put it there.
Yes, those games would grandpa sharp me for life.
Which is why now that I'm the grandfather, I'm scouring a whole new generation with worthless original.
Hey, Timmy. Say hi to Wet Willie, the worthless wonderworld.

Giving children nightmares for over 60 years.

If your toothpaste doesn't taste great,
your kids don't brush long enough,
which could lead to ugly, tartar buildup.
The solution, regular checkups,
and brushing with new crusts that tartar control toothpaste
lays with crack cocaine.
Hey, son, almost got in there.
Brush and crack, boss.
Brush and crusts.
Crust is not only clinically proven.
It's also highly addictive.
See your kids will brush and brush and brush.
And brush and brush and brush.
Come on, Billy, it's been 45 minutes.
Brush and, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
If you're not careful,

New crust toothpaste,
laced with crack cocaine,
recommended by 9 out of 10 drug addicts.
Discover, diuretics.
Is life an endless nightmare of confusion in chaos,
leading to a bleak nothingness?
Or is it just me, PJ?
Why do I have dreams about my mother in Phran?
Page 69.
Why did I give my life savings to a bizarre cult religion
founded by a bad science fiction writer?
Page 1999.
Am I worthy of seventh-level zardons, or am I a butthead?
Page 25, 25.
Discover, diuretics.
Flushing questions from the mind.
Is it field of counter, field of movement,
diuretics by Elrond Havab,
over 20 million copies sold, and you believe it?
No.
All right.
You, who's fighting so,
must take it slow.
Prove that you're inside.
Don't say,
with even still,
for grandmas,
or even Neil Young.
Tree,
you're never well.
No drink like hell.
It'll surely go bad.
Holy.
Just keep it clean.
It can't be fixed.
You'll need a donor.
Don't you ever party hard?
If you do, you could die.
Or just wait in a long flight.
Like David Trussby.
The Jeff River kissers well behind.
Yes.
Does he have a reason
to sort the best thing this guy?
Yes.
He's constantly falling.
And a puppy can fall.
The Jeff River kissers well behind.
Yes.
And ever since they traded through
they been playing real quality.
The reason they gave it was to stay the key line.
And we know that Chris made me a pretty nice guy.
Muddy, fumbles, and he stumbles,
and tricks on the school.
I insist that that's a dying bird.
He says,
Yes.
The thieves in the clothes
and they'll never say why.
Just sending it easy,
just use I all the time.
So Jeff River kissers well behind.
Yes.
Clean it on my child's nose.
My lawyer says it's worth white hair.
A song.
The side been looking around.
One excuse to explain my world.
You can't recognize me.
My doctor is how I bleach dogs my epilithelies.
And I keep the children around.
And they sleep inside my bed.
And he's a save that I am gay.
That's why I'm marrying with a movie.
It's way too late to come and say
with this song.
That's really bad.
Blame it on my child's nose.
No.
I'm done with those toys that I never had.
The only thing I show in my life
is what my phone and I view it down.
Before you judge me
and hold me freaking,
let me find and tell you.
And say.
I believe it on my child's nose.
The devil made it through.
No.

Don't I fight?
Feel I die?
I'm still fucking in just life.
I'm doing you all that I did.
Just in seven.
I just doubt it.
This is not a love thing.
I knew maybe I should go to number two.
It's not safe in here till I go to food.
I got to lay.
Vincent Baalke was a savior.
Now he starts to feel the pressure.
You can't read the Republican one.

And it's done.
Run the house like a fan's word.
And the Democrats may change no good.
But your god, male, thought his mom she was on top of Trump.
She said that news.
Call Hillary down.
When we call her the big beast,
she don't mean bashful hockey.
But we see God the bear of the devil.
How about the pain from the show?

When did you went down the bank of South?
Finding a great head of CTL when it's just a lonely day.
The family's gone away because they couldn't give her every play.
Just any preaches, Ben's just timing J.
Oh, buddy, shoot it.
Get up all the business because he's getting nailed.
This is aspirational golf.
His family's moving on.
Yes, she's looking for the wider play.
They used to think that it was so easy.
This purple cash was having faith in his dreams.
How he's clients.
She is firing now.
Once the weekend lets you be happy.
For family faces you may love throughout the week.
So she's fired when it's while he's flying.
And now he's his.
He didn't know her G spot on the club's hands.
I was doing this monkey with his ass all right.
And in just three days he was noted in debt.
It was a full hour.
It's a full hour.
Making love to a monkey with it just ain't right.
Now my face is sweaty and my butt cheeks.
Guys, it's busy.

Anybody believe it's over 300?
No.
It could be. We'll be getting report any second now any moment.
Well, right there at the main entrance, we got the QAM van right by the main God Damned Entrance there in Evans' Hero Mall, right by East Side Mirios, between pennies and the Lurden Tether and all those other glitzy stores.
We just look for Chris and Sam and all those people and say, hey, here's a bunch of money.
We're going to try the end of the butt, honey.

The gun to be good.
We'll be carrying lots of earth in the gunny sack.
Smoke it every day until your lungs run like a rock.
With all the money that we have made, Jamaica doesn't need any foreign aid.
American tourists come here and say, got nothing like this in the USA.
They smoke.
Are you smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.
They light up this cliff and smoke.
They begin to puff and choke.
Smoke, gun to smoke, smoke.

You like this wolf, the giant stiff whenever you turn.
Many people coming here for miles around.
So bite and hurtful you by the ounce and it comes.

He would want to take you on like Joseph McCarthy.

Too much of that Moroccan crap, too much of that baby crap.
You know what I'm talking about?
That's where he goes fault.
I'm about of course because he's not a musician
and he couldn't do anything.
He wasn't even a good drummer, but nevertheless,

Brian, let me ask you a question.
How is that little trampcessy did you ever bother?
He heard you.
I don't want to know about this.
I want to know about the Nisten Frank.
I understand, but he is the man's man.
Oh, oh, sir.
I want to be for you.
Get to return.
Are we very at?
Remember the 70s?
This goes.
Leisure suits.
The Partridge family.
But you know, the best part about the 70s was the hair.
That's right.
People had great hair.
And black people had the best hair of all.
Afros.
Right.
That's right.
Like Florence Williams, the third on the mod squad.
Sherman Helmsley on the Jefferson's.
And pretty much anyone on Sanford and Sun.
Yeah, Lamont.
He had great hair.
Well, nowadays 70s are back in style, including those great looking afro.
Like Samuel L. Jackson's in public fiction.
Now you can have hair just like here.
Thanks to a revolutionary new product for the makers of Brogan.
Introducing all new Brogan.

Did you fear your nephew was in hell?
I feel that my nephew is not worth a long experience
Not with the Lord, but in other words in hell
You fear that that Roman Catholic community this day
H. your nephew's body
Yes
We have on the light of Van Ays here
A Roman Catholic priest on KFI-640
Hello
How you doing?
Good
This man, first of all, up on my condolences to you on the lock of your nephew
Are you a priest?
Yes I am
Yes
I just want to let you express something for you
You've been misinformed about the church
That you are a priest
That you are a priest
If you just hang on, I will explain to you what I believe is
And then you can draw your own conclusion
But you are a priest
Let me explain what our teaching is and you draw your own conclusion
Let the father explain
First of all, we believe that when the New Testament is communion
We see the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
Oh, to our Lord God
We will hold on, man
I'm just calling to let you know what our belief is
You eat flesh and blood
If you want to look at it that way, that's fine
Oh, my God, that's fine
This is our belief and you draw your own conclusion
I want to find this
Man, you've got to let the father explain
Well, when I want to hear him talk about it, you can see that there's been form
This is like show raises like clad back and forth
Okay, first of all, the answer is that because you've been misinformed about what happened to your nephew and I was looking for it
You eat the butt, you eat the whole damn thing
Excuse me? Don't you eat it?
We eat the whole thing, yes
The whole thing
But he sees the whole body and the man
That's not what I said
You said you eat the blood and the flesh
How cruel
Call the man
No, of Jesus Christ
Oh, God, that is a blasphemy
Well, if you choose to leave that
I'm trying to do it until my part believe
Because it is a beautiful form
Do you eat up on the booty, too?
I'm not even going to answer that
I don't understand what that means
What is this man talking about eating the Lord Jesus?
What in the finish?
Let him just say what he has to say
From this scripture's man, where Jesus took bread and blessed and broke it and said
Take this and eat it, this is my body
Oh, God
And then he picked the cup of wine and said
Take and drink this is my blood
And again he said, I'm going to eat my body and drink my blood and have no life at it
Oh, my God, this is good Friday
Exactly
And you're talking about eating up on Jesus
I can tell you that
I wonder what we believe
You're grabbing on Jesus' hands
What?
You're grabbing all our own Jesus
If that is just a belief
And my men ask you what about him
Okay, ma'am, I'll say again
I'm grabbing on Jesus and Catholics
I'm not going to lie to my boy
I'm not going to lie to my boy
I'm not going to lie to my boy
You won't laugh no more
And I'm going to laugh no more
You'll laugh no more
But like some kind of Negro smog is going over there
Well, I'll tell you
Listen, it's Friday, I'm not going to lie to you
It's like a brother best friend
I'm not going to lie to you
Listen, Father, I thank you for taking the time
I really do
And you have a good Easter
You pay for your sins
Well, only better to God
That's true
Thank you, Father
That was a Roman Catholic priest
And Mac and all my boy
Like a brother bushing
All you can eat
Yeah, keep going
What was it?
What did you call him, man?
All you can eat me, bro
Yeah
Oh, no
Oh, all you can eat me, bro.
Oh, God.
So, I understand.
Thank you very much.
I'm Aaron Sona.
You know what?
You got me talking on the passion song.
Tell me the story about how you got flown.
I got you down.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Holy cow.
Oh, ho, ho.
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.
I got you down.
The lines are jammed up.
Yeah, there isn't a doubt.
Call up and tell me what it's all about.
I got you down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Holy cow.
Oh, ho, ho.
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.
I got you down.
I got you down.
I got you down.
I got you down.
I got you down.
Here on this show, there's a new topic each night.
Don't you have sex with me?
I got you down.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Holy cow.
I'll tell you once more before I hang up the phone.
I got you down.
Okay, 9-F-1 at 5.50 WQM 510 bucks over there in Adventura.
So far, not too exciting, not too bad, not too exciting.
That gives us 123.8684.
We're getting close.
We need another 316 bucks in the next 15-1 minutes to get 224 grand today.
No, we're going to do it.
Come on.
Do we do it?
I want to hear it.
Enthusiasm.
No.
Okay, 12 after 1.
Here's the greatest of bad somebody's fact is to me because I don't want to birth anybody's bubble,
but shaky the truth and you will not read the Sun Sentinel.
Did you see this?
Where they reprinted this, the old, trashy piece of crap.
It says on the editorial page today, Sun Sentinel.
Well, of course, this is the same paper that told us, where's that thing?
That told us that people who don't bet on ball games are just as interested in the odds.
And the points breads are those who do bet on ball games.
That's right.
So why would they lie about Fannie Claus?
So it says one of the most famous letters to be editor ever published was written by an 80-year-old
guru who had doubts about Santa Claus in a halting hand she sought help from the New York Sun.
The answer first published September 21st, 1897, over 100 freaking years ago,
has stirred the hearts of American diversons.
Today we reprint her letter in the Sun's reply, an editorial written by Francis Farsela's church.
What a name, huh?
As in Farsicle, the editor, I'm eight years old, some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.
Papa says, if you see it in the Sun, it's so, please tell me the truth.
Is there a Santa Claus, Virginia or Hanlon?
Dear Virginia, your friends and your family, you're all full of crap.
Oh, that's not what it is.
No, but it goes on about, yeah, and not believe in Santa Claus, you might as well not believe in fairies.
Huh?
Yeah, it says nobody sees Santa Claus, but that's no sign there's no Santa Claus.
The most real things in the world are those that neither children or men can see.
And then here's the greatest line in this whole letter to the editor.
Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn?
Yeah, sure, all the time in a grove.
Well, what is that?
South Beach all the time.
Did we ever see fairies dancing on the lawn?
And it says, of course not.
Well, that's before we had South Beach.
Thank God, he lives forever.
Santa Claus is rich.
Hey, Virginia, I hope you're still alive, although we're sure that you're down there deep in the ground
because God works in mysterious ways, but nevertheless, there ain't no standing claws, there ain't no two fairies.
There are some fairies in South Beach and in the grove, but that's about it.
I'm wondering why I leave it out.
And of course, it's a God bull crack.
Don't leave that out.
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.
Well, I hate what I'm doing on 2 a.m.
What's that fact that's going on again?
I want what they had before.
These are my kind of guys.
What the hell are they doing anyway?
We're the manly, down the dime, really, James.
I want more at risk for a gust of ice to feel high.
When I listen to the sport, a manly voice won't get my attention.
I will really get to see the short.
A squeaky high voice will give me another reaction.
Well, I hate what we're doing on 2 a.m.
But that's back and back on again.
I'm going to miss here and straight men with voice with this high.
Now I'll have to get deeper as I close it again.
So I can impress all the macho fans.
Check out Chris Moritzide to build a band inside.
There ain't nothing I can have at macho sports guys.
This voice has a classic name.
Well, here's old.
Yeah, I can't believe that.
Yes, stand up.
You're close to the radio and press the sound.
Get their voices on up there.
If you'll mix my balls, you'll get there.
And that growl, man.
Well, he's smart.
I hate Red Brothers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
Oh, my daddy.
He wants to meet her.
You see hard working man.
My mother, he wants to meet her.
You see this guy.
I said, I'm going to get there.
I said, hey man, get from me instead.
Hard work, good, and hard work, fine.
First take care of this.
So now I hope to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join.
I hope to join when I'm defeated again and that's every 10,000 points I'm supposed to join.
I hope to join because it's time of the end and doing time well.
I hope to join before I hope to join and say that I hope to more.
I hope to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join.
I hope to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get up in the car I'm supposed to join when I get

Introducing the crap.
Two and a half pounds of steaming human extra minutes that pops neatly
into the front seat of all domestic and most foreign vehicles.
Properly installed, the crap determines even those determined feet.
Hey, nice car.
They left it door online.
Take this car a little skid.
Oh my God, someone took it up on the front seat.
That is disgusting.
I'm moving on to the next car.
One wave of the crap.
And these will move on to another car that doesn't have a steaming pile
of human extra minutes on the front seat.
We guarantee it.
Order the crap for your car today.
And anyone who tries to steal your car will be indeed.
Well, you know.
Coming next year, the chain is taught for the tour your hometown.
During the benefit of Cardinal Classy School for wayward boys, it's Michael Jackson.
These are my latest and take-ins.
I've got a very epic sight.
Michael Jackson.
What?
Because I've found them any time.
Just don't matter.
Let's see.
That's all right.
Michael Jackson.
Yes, Michael performs all of his great hits from all these with the Jackson sides.
There's an A, B, B.
I'm can down on my knees.
We're moving the dumb, go straight.
A, B, C, Saddle, B, B, G, and B.
That's right.
From the time of tunes of the Jackson 5, to the classic silverware, Michael Jackson's
benefits, who are aims to please.
The people of the room are supposed to start using an aisle.
Some call me big, brothers come up at a pile.
And I know what to do.
File, hide and sit for a while and beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.
Michael Jackson.
Sometimes I'm so depressed that I just sit around so again waiting for a call,
when the call you call again.
When I'm home alone, sitting naked by the phone, I beat it, beat it.
And B, one of the five lucky boys to receive backstage passes to hang out in Michael Jackson's
presence.
Michael Jackson's benefits.
Hey, Michael, yes, Bobby.
Is that your real skin color?
It's inside with counts.
But I know a game that you can play to find out.
It's inside with your slides.
You know, it's time to free really.
Say, say, what you want, but you know who I am.
Give a fraction of me.
You don't know how to read, but this old boy is here.
Me too, actually.
And here's the rousing finale.
Yes, Michael sings the song he wrote for the show in the world.
It's the beginning of Voice Choir backing him up.
I don't like girls.
I like real children.
They are the ones turning on and hate.

to teach, and to teach, a perfect that would be
Let life hold her and sigh her arms and aim her towards the tree
What things that I'd like to see, and that gift on TV
I give her a gift into info by inside the winter's youth
It's the perfect end, while it would really fit her
The ash feels the fur husband gave, while their kids say the bitter
What a smug
Who's that humor gonna get laid?
Your body's a show-tongue, not even guessing paid
It's like you can't get girls without some beer
Where you haven't gotten laid this week, this month, or even this year
But I'll go down on you, when you feel lonely
I'll go down on you
Okay
I'll go down on you, when you go down on me
It's okay
It's the perfect end, but it's the bad bone
I'm a nut, I'm a nut, my life, don't ever get in a rut
It'll match all of this, so I'll lose tonight
God says God gave her a new slot, I ain't crazy
I'm a nut
Is it wetter, under water, if you're there, when it rains?
Is it shorter to New York, and it is by plane between myself and I
I wonder who's the number, is it slaughtered down south?
Then it is in the summer
Beef, pea, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap
I'm a nut, I'm a nut, my life, don't ever get in a rut
It'll match all of this, so I'll lose tonight
God says God gave her a new slot, I ain't crazy
I'm a nut, I drove my cattle like a Vegas, do that is by my luck
Well, then deal with it, don't make us on a grey pound bus
I should have said the words on by
While I was back, but remember only for as far as breathing birds
Is it b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap, b-bap
Billy, he's mom, not another animal
Kids just hate getting animals, and moms hate giving them
But now there's a brand new animal that kids just love
Introducing new animal animals
The candy coated chocolate animal that makes getting cleaned out fun
Hey mom, can I have another animal?
I don't know Billy, that makes your third animal today
Please, well, okay, cool off, then this time I want a green one
Well, sorry son, I took all the green ones
I'm dead, my two boys
New animal animals, melts in your butt, not in your head
If I work for the pecs, I'm the other here, the other here
Oi!
Old baby, old guy, the other here
If I want the pecs, I'm going
Oi!
I buy up all this patience
Like the life of love in Zeta, I use to be the high old man
Roy!
I have lots of money in the bank, annoying ones that go in like Roy
I'd have already all net work that nobody carries
But everyone has that on the spot
TV cable, realistic, I would own
I'd have a half a dozen big effemations and 607 AM station schools
And that's just in hell and they'll all alone
Oi!
If I work for pecs, I'm the other here, the other here
Old baby, old guy, the bill with my number
If I work for pecs and boys
I'd rearrange the whole map
The other here, the other here, the other here
The other here, the other here
I've have shackles, you know what I mean
I see rists, they're the freaking queen
Wayne High Zenga would be for an increase
If I bought that pecs and boys
Oi!
I had a checkmate pay, one day she flew away
To Tio on a web of who lives through the double-wheel
But with our right wing censorship
There are words of muslims that
Do we tell you how I feel for K?
K?
For K?
So, if you see K, if you wanna
I'll see you if Tio wanna choose
O, if you see K, tell her I'm a service day
And the FCC won't let me sing this
So I'll not roll to say how if you see K?
Take her hand, tell you say
And after the strength mission
I'll be out in 90 days
O, if you see K, if you wanna
Then I'll see you with Tio
Why not go, why not go
But God, I'll see you with Tio
Why not go
137 and 56, you know what I'm saying
Don't forget we know who's gonna be here tomorrow
We got all kinds of ball games, we got sports ran
Radio because it's God and Christmas Day
Okay, are we gonna be here tomorrow?
No!
Nobody!
Thank God
But the hangs coming up next will be along today's
Got a show from 2 to 5, then in the 5 to 6 hour
The Jimmy Johnson showed last one of the regular season
And then we got sports ran Radio 6
Because even the 8 lock won off on Christmas Eve
It's cold
Little rock
Turn on K through a hundred G
And we're going
Just in that flag of Hillary
Power of rookies
Automatic transaction
Flesh engaging
That's absolutely
Little rock
Little rock
Oh God, so strong
It puts the lotion in the basket
Oh, it's all found on the street
Miss the girl's hands
Give that song for my part
Is this thing?
Oh, rock
It's beautiful and it's fine
How can I go down?
It gets in from girls
They're broken bones
Never tried to be high
But 16
It's beautiful and it's fine
Oh, man, I'm happy
It goes crazy
When it's bad
When it's bigger it's better yet
But it's still my hand
It's touched my chest
For sure
When it blooms
It ruined my best became my world
And through my life
Oh, how it makes me feel fine
It's 16
So beautiful and it's fine
It's a great song
It's a great song
It's a great song
Hey, you Jennifer Capriotti here
And when I'm left and balled on the court
I'm getting doned off my aunt
And I get my best hit
Off the Jennifer Capriotti cut his ball can bomb
That's right, it's the Jennifer Capriotti
10 is ball can bomb
Cops will never suspect it
It has been looking bad
Just empty the balls, screw on the ball
Fill it with water
And you're set to destroy brain cells
The Jennifer Capriotti way
Oh, this is so smooth
It's the bomb that sings it's a tennis ball can
A tennis ball can that sings it's a bomb
First beat's benefit
The Jennifer Capriotti leaves his offense
But normal approved
There he was just a walking on the sea sand
New I did it, it did it, dumb did it
He's a man from the land of calories sand
New I did it, it did it, dumb did it
He's good, he's good, he's good
He's divine, he's divine
He's good, he's divine
Changes water into one
The next thing I knew we had a layman on his feet singing
Two I did it, it did it, dumb did it, dumb
Stop lying not gonna see
And the dumb is on his feet singing
Two I did it, it did it, dumb did it, dumb did it, dumb
He walked on, walked on
him надrrupt my dog and he cured a lubbersource
To what I'm saying is the son of God
Yes, they do but there's all the people thinking so I
Now, he's the reason that we
have any sideace and tumble
I dead
It did it, dumb did it, dumb did it
And he's the reason that all the Christians pray say,
And do I dare to dare to dumb dare to
They praise him, praise him, kneel down, kneel down,
Praise him and kneel down, the man who wore a thorny crown.
Do I dare to dare to dumb dare to
Do I dare to dare to dumb dare to
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew
Do I dare to dare to dumb he's a Jew
An ant of picky, clearly owes you thrive on that archery
Artific and arena for the Miami-Dade
Happy to arena, somehow don't seem right
Better ask your foe in poor financial aid, five
And the age my cow, there's no best if all they're all all strife
Let's turn this place down, and ensure it's just what you're being right
Before we move our ass, take the tan of scuttle
Like that, that's not all I can't say I can
I see that's all I can
Oh, I see that's all I can
I see that's all I can't say
I see that's all I can't say
I see that's all I can't say
That's weak, I did the craziest thing
I knew the hope is to learn and keep on it
And then I hit the street to go check out my stuff
And what happened was right on the garbage
There was a black guy standing on the corner
I said to him, I was up and your blood was going down
And he looked at me as if I was some kind of brain
And you won't believe what he called me
Take the broom, take the broom
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those best youth
Don't like the kids of those kids of those
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those youth
He said he bought a safe for you
And he pulled out a gun and said a fish
And I'm just learning to buy an X-1 or one
And he named that fish and said he has less than one old youth
Come on, stop a new fox, a fox, a fox, a fox
As I lay there, I thought I was dying
Somebody called the paramedics
I presume there's another dude said that he was set at conkey boys
Do the body good, Ken?
And we'll be good, Sam, you
Take the broom, take the broom
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those best youth
Don't like the kids of those kids of those
Do the body good, Ken?
Don't like the kids of those kids of those
Now how did he look like the kids of those kids of those best youth
Do the body good, Ken?
Don't like the kids of those kids of those
To do the body good, Ken?

look out of character.
But there's a special place in my eye the Valentine's Day.
Why I can't remember back way back in the days of my youth I was sitting there in the car
In the kitchen she was covering as she wanted the break in ortho week because I was
Italian but that I was there from the wrong element. Can you believe that coming from that
You bet. That's it. So I got the hell out of there.
So I got out of the f***ing car. Why are we still f***ing moving?
A couple of weeks later I was feeling kind of a bit about it.
Now I said it's a f***ing flower from the PMS.

Hey, catch my bygroom to the loo
