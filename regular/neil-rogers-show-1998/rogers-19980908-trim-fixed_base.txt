They had the tapes out when I was talking about that goddamn pat at Pompato Park
And I just sat there reliving the whole experience. I was I was screaming at the set. Yes, right keep saying it
But he ate three four and I know there people say well, you know what he makes it to be a lot of that
I'm making a big deal because it was a big deal in my life
Because that moment that millisecond of my life just opened up a whole new outlook on everything in this goddamn place
What do you need three four? How about giving me a hundred? Okay, I got a hundred of my best personal friends gonna come
We're all gonna squeeze into our little box. How do you like that?
But just give me as many one dummy up. I love that it was a beautiful thing
So thank you so much Pat whoever to have you are
On by the way speaking of the far right how come we're not hearing anything about Dan Burton? I mean
Little representative Dan Burton from Indiana who's up there
First it wasn't either one that said Bubba was a scumbag. That's way. I love that song and that one of my favorites Bubba is a scumbag
But seriously he calls the president of the West a scumbag a few weeks ago
And then he's under a trying to put that bulldog janitor Reno and jail
And all of a sudden we find out over the weekend
We heard very little about this that Dan Burton had a child out of wedlock in the early 80s
He has a teenage son that nobody knew about
And then he's not the hoots but to come out there and say the over the weekend well
The reason that I'm addressing this now is because of course since I'm investigating somebody else that actually
That's the reason that this came to the front that's right and all you other phony right wingers out
They're including new noot mice during all the other ones
They're gonna be outed too for all their little uppecry dillows that they're doing
And you notice how everybody is running panicky now including a Daniel Patrick Moynihan with the a Batman lips and all the other
They a Joker lips all these people just to have peen in their pants because now they're finding out that the
Star report is gonna be really racy
It's gonna have every detail and haven't they been saying all along
It's not about sex and it's not they've been saying but guess what it is about sex
And she's doing with a cigar and they're doing this in the limo over here. What the hell kind of report is that?
And that's why there are running away from this thing like he's got leprosy and paulsy and very very at the same guy damn time
Because he was screwing around and the rest of the world continues laughing around soft
How about that mark McGuire huh?
and you know I've discovered that every I read three more articles over the weekend
Negative you know about that andro
Every single one of them was written by a woman and
What are they talking about here next door and he and their sales department?
We allowed are they being real loud and leak cutler's office again?
Are they in denial again in there about the fact that they talk to God damn loud while you ain't here try to do a radio show?
Yes, they are take it out in the hallway, okay? Take it over to power 96
They'll put you on the air they'll audition you take it over to Sheridan Street. Definitely give you a goddamn show
He'll put you on doing tags on the spots if you sell any
God are they loud over there?
What I was I said about Mark Mcguire and the andro one of these women know about the only them all these steroid written feminist bull-by-quim and other ones
They know about taking good steroids
But all these women want to pee on a parade you pee all you want sweet arts, but it was great
I just missed the yesterday
We didn't get home in time to see the home run but I saw the replay and it was number 61
And when surprised me at all if number 62 is coming up there tonight eight o'clock in Cardinals and the Cubs
Nice going Mark. You are a boring guy of a nice going and
Take it away Joe Joe Box said it best on Saturday during the telecast and HL and Rose okay
Baseball it's okay only in football and the IOC the International Olympic Committee
Which even bans some over-the-counter cold medications the IOC what a bunch of bluenos assholes they are
So don't come to be big in the middle of a bunch of crap about andro Mark Mcguire is doing it
I have a parade about it. Okay, even George is excited about it
Oh wait till I tell you with the real story about Jesus
Ten minutes after I'm telling it's incredible. Yeah, burn the bloody bitches
Oh
Shaving green so I let it all my face
I look like a church and I was fired into space
Driving home I was all alone
Thinking someone's playing tricks on me
But in the rear-view mirror I could see Jesus staring back at me
So
My path up
Nothing
Without
I
All
I saw him on the side of the top, so in the low pass on my car.
I saw him in a foliage beginning in the side of the smuggler's yard.
Yes, I saw him in a foliage beginning in the side of the smuggler's yard.
Yes, I saw him in a foliage beginning in the side of the smuggler's yard.
I saw him this honest digng of foulard bars.
I saw him on the pile of those carbono sheets, feet were found on cars.
All my friends take our mix, down into an pond,
I saw me this honesty of foulard bars.
to the Michigan and we're in to the Maddits if you're listening you ought to be ashamed
in a bearer. I mean I'm not ashamed in a bearer. Michigan's steak got
wild for the second week in a row because it's a girls football team we know
that. Respect to lose. But Michigan that he keeps talking and trying to go
by I saw that Michigan Notre Dame game released enough of it to make me six
Saturday and it finally dawned on me since there I mean nobody can tackle
that bad even little girls can tackle better than Michigan but the fix is in.
And it dawned on me finally that the strut of true in his for real it's just
been misinterpreted. Don't you understand what Jesus is saying? That's why all
these football players prayed to Jesus he's been in the football. The strut of
true in what Jesus doing. He's got his arms up like this touchdown. That's right
what do you think when they go back I like Doug Flutey to that great hail Mary
at the end of the game BC and Miami years ago. Nice going Doug Flutey to let
your field goal kickers sucks up there in Buffalo. Touchdown Jesus yeah that's
what they call it Notre Dame touchdown Jesus. Oh he's back to throw it's a
hail Mary and Notre Dame wins another goddamn game you know something I'm
gonna tell you this because it pisses me off here's a national network NBC the
Notre Dame Network. Well what is that what is that all above? I mean there are
universities that have their own television network within like you know
within the state but a national network carrying Notre Dame on here in Dick
Enberg that misery if I hear that dick one more time you know I used to like
him years ago when he wasn't didn't have such a big swell head like Joe Rose but
he's everywhere just too much he's oversaturated enough with Dick already okay
he was good once upon a time Dick Enberg but too much dick even had so too much
God I can't stand him the voice of Notre Dame touchdown Jesus so here's a
fact from Gert George did do a pretty good job and the exception of not using the
dump button with the effort well George did use the dump button but it wasn't
working because they had some technical problems here yesterday wow what a
concept oh this one I'm not this is that the scrawny little writing which I wouldn't
waste my time this is the one that doesn't know whether he hates me or loves me
or hey you know just chronic chronic we're looking for a fact and look at his
phone here we got one call on there and it's got 10 question marks on it that
show yesterday must have made an impact like you wouldn't believe so forget
about the calls right now got more important stuff more important fish to fry
getting my car here on Friday at noon heading for the airport to get the
hell out of this God for second place for a long weekend get all the way to I
95 and I make my turn on the I 95 this has to do with cars and computers
whatever happened the good old days when we didn't have computers and cars see
the first bad experience I had with the computer in a car was back in Chicago
several years ago when we went up there to do our show from Murphy's bleachers
across from really feel and we had at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Chicago we had
rented that why they gave me that big Duke in a way that big continental and
there's four of us in noon one day getting ready to go to Ritzfield the
old ballpark and at the hotel I get my Lincoln continental in fact we went
up into the park and garage brought it down there the front and there's four
of us in the car my friend Dave there's a Cheryl Riffkin and her former husband
Mitch Wiener Riffkin whatever his name is and we're gonna wait and I pull
out to take off I hit the gas and now the computer decides okay full throttle
bingo let's go don't you remember that you went there that year no I was not I
was down and if it weren't for in fact you can go I'm telling you right now see
and I left my mark in Chicago right there under pillar on that big pillar in
the middle of the parking area there and if we're ready for that pillar because
you go right out of the street there were hundreds of people walking I would
kill like all of us and all of them because of the computer in the car so
anyway I'm heading out to the airport here on Friday get to I'm gonna be five I
make my turn all of a sudden I hear these bells bang bang bang bang I'm
believable and I see that and all of a sudden they feel like all the power is
like gone out of from under my foot there's like nothing and it says flashing on
my computer reduced engine power and I thought oh no no crap what an
understatement that is as in no engine power as you know I'm coasting now
luckily I'm in the right hand lane so I pull over you know and off the shoulder
there just barely getting on the expressway and I wonder what and there's all
these lights all these warning lights but I'm being believable into bells or
ringing and I'm sitting there and of course my luck I don't have my cell phone
in that car I left it in the red car and like a schmuck that I am I don't have
as so I'm sitting there and my life is flashing before my eyes to get I'm
gonna miss the damn plane we're gonna have a you know stay here the whole day
I'm weekend which is a fate worth and death so I reach over turn off the
ignition and I thought to myself well what the hell can I do give it a shot turn
it on starts right up and the check engine light is on but all the other stuff is
gone no more bells no more puking no and there I go knock on wood okay off to
the erases no problem come back yesterday getting a car even the check
engine light is finally gone history everything's fine I get home I look at my
owner's manual the check engine light is on with some when some kind of a I
should have brought the thing an emissions problem a exit who cares about
emissions I'm driving to work this morning there's a diesel truck for now you
can't even see where you're going it's pouring out so much damn oil and I'm
worried about emissions not turn or otherwise I mean what the hell are we talking
about here and then well and I'm trying to figure out what the hell that means
reduced engine power and you know I'm saying to myself at this point I will
never ever drive that car again except for the dealer to trade it in you know
how that is I maybe it's only me but when you lose confidence in a car in other
words a couple weeks ago the lights come on ABS breaking system check ABS and
there was nothing wrong with the ABS brakes but the lights came on and like
later on the same day they went out so my computer is starting to have like
little parts all over the place and what disturbs me keeps bringing back the
memory to me of going your computer locks in and all of a sudden it locks in
the accelerator and by the big you just and you can't stop the car like
happened to me that one time in Chicago with that big continental which I should
have sued their ass because plenty of people have told me the old one you know
uh Ford's got a problem with that many continental's we've heard about yeah
that's great that's great you're going 80 whether you want to or not so it just
has to do you lose confidence in a particular car because you have a feeling
that the you know it's got very few miles on it it's time to say goodbye to the
silver 97 see you have a nice life okay let's take our solo call here in
Davie with the 10 question marks okay sir oh god how do you like that I come
back here after a wonderful holiday weekend and there's Ron with Proza and that's
it that's a middle of our call well George wants to continue is gonna do
another three and a half hours today because obviously the impact was so
tremendous yesterday there isn't a call on the board here today is it real is
it memorizes it tapes is it George and of course today being the day after

the gods on us truth this is the yeah honest truth I saw more wrecks more
broken down cars this morning and it's only like a half hour 25 minutes from my
house to work here than I've seen all summer long all summer long put together
I saw more geeks and more problems and more wrecks this morning it's the full
moon it's something in the year the markets up 282 points here's a mobile in

Jimmy right every time I drive my wife Jimmy I step in the brakes the

comes on I I get different North Carolina and I brought the dealer there and
they're like oh it's the altitude you know and it's the altitude yeah they don't
like your altitude that was exactly right but so do now that's the thing this
was reduced engine power and it's like I got my foot to the floor and that thing
is just coasting off onto the shoulder and thank God I was on a shoulder
because I had no power not reduced power no power because the computer
decided that something was wrong which was not right how do you like that
we need help exactly have a great day pal you think that's God bless you here's
one that says bring back the bird thank you Ralph am I was that is that a
yes or an oj or it's back to the Don't count either what Greg's back to

bointin beats now off there and wherever the hell he is oh we don't want to hear

that they're amateur program directors like Bokeh Brian and Tom Chauvin we
don't give a crap about that we want to hear from like the real meeting potatoes
the real audience out there not a bunch of self-appointed amateur program
directors like that God damn little bald headed Bokeh Brian 1026 at 560 WQA

anything you want did your older sister ever come home from college crying her eyes out
because the world was unfair and she was stuck in a run well she was the old
person in your family that wasn't a big old barrel of the world is tough and
chances are you aren't the best for the brightest and when you put your mind to
things you still come up short to get ahead in this world you need to cheap

into a Cuban boy who you know doesn't speak no Spanish yeah I love it all right hey man this
mad dog this call him the Chiwa one now talking all that garbage oh my god you know something I've
seen I've seen little girls five and six year old girls tackled better than Michigan man they blow
me because yeah okay yeah I think managed to be laying out for a few weeks now after that
performance by the Wolverines by the little wolfies there on Saturday against Notre Dame and
touchdown Jesus man do I get I get so psychotic when Notre Dame wins at anything if they win like a
pinnacle game I get pissed off two open lines in date five six seven oh five 60 and pound five
60 on a mobile one line and of course you notice when they're over on the sidelines and they have
the coaches on a on the phone usually it's with a coaching staff upstairs this is with the Vatican
they have the special red phone the bad phone the Pope is on a phone he's not too happy with that
second down call by the way here's a sunrise hello sunrise hello yes sir yeah I'm
tiny old how you doing I'm doing okay I got a newer General Motors vehicle it did the same
thing about four times really and basically what finally they told me at the dealership that what
you need to do is crank down the gas cap when you fill up crank down the gas cap yeah it's a pressurized
fuel system and it gets an it gets a different reading if that gas cap isn't tightened down you
know something I think that probably is it because I had just I had just filled up the tank like
the a 94 and that might be it and maybe you get it at the full service and the guy didn't crank
it down or I didn't do it I never do full service I I did my I pumped my own so to speak well I did
that a couple of times and you just got to crank it down because you know I'm like yes I did more
five times yeah because there was nothing wrong with the car because how the hell could I've
driven all the way from I've very road to the airport and then back home now yesterday if
there'd been any even like you know I'm checking all the I'm checking everything the oil and I'm
checking the temperature every every possible thing to see if there's any problems I'm driving
under because they don't want to damage the engine but there was nothing wrong with it yeah crank down
the gas cap would have cranked through it okay thanks put a crank to it there you go there's a guy
that sawed my problem right off the bat and I'm ready to trade in my car just because I had to put
a crank to it crank it down tight baby that's the way to do it two open lines in date one and
brown or five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line you don't have to feel
compelled to call in say that you like George better than the tapes but I sure hope you do but
let's give a give us an honest analization here those tapes suck get rid of the tapes number one
it's so time consuming for him not to make those and it's always dated I'm talking about stuff
that happened a hundred years ago by the way did I mention that Kevin Week sucks no I didn't
mention that you did I oh yeah his agent is holding out Kevin Weeks and Brian Murray's really
pissed off you know the sad part of this whole deal is because being in Toronto over the weekend
by the way American Airlines is great oh thank god for American Airlines I love them the food is
great their flights are great I love American Airlines we had a lady pilot by the way going up
there you ever had a lady capatano yes very good only she was talking too loud on either I mean I
know they can't tell how loud it's coming over usually the problem is then you're clapping and
they're forty four down there and you can't understand what they're saying usually that's the deal
but she was so loud but she was very good so some of my old sexist views in fact maybe if that
Swiss air I shouldn't say that so but he you know a lot of people now saying that he screwed up
you're not supposed to say that about you know these experienced pilots but they're saying that
when you have smoke or any kind of fire on board you don't dittle around it like you know take
it as nonchalantly as he did and circle around and start dumping fuel if you're going to take a
dump that's a dump you take and they're saying that even though he was like only 30 miles from
Halifax that still he could have if he descended like what they say like five thousand feet per minute
for six minutes he could have done it and even with a heavy load in fact I was reading over the
weekend that it's safer to crash even on a runway on cement that it is on the water because of
the way the water like whatever whatever whatever the way it makes contact with these aluminum
shell of the aircraft now but at any rate too late now I guess we have two open lines and date
fine and of course people are saying well you know after you read about that aren't you a little
bit nervous when you get up there and fly any flim no so air candidate I know you're on strike
and we hope Helene gets her job back real soon and we love her and our friends at air
Canada but you know hey that American Airlines is pretty damn good two open lines in day five six seven
oh five fifty and the food we didn't have no sea wolf we didn't have no mahi mahi we had damn good
two good meals on air and American Airlines nice go on guys that I direct they serve on air Canada
here's a mobile in Miami hello hello yes sir oh yeah no before I get the George I want to tell you
this Saturday I was desperate for something to listen to and I was in the car working I was
listening to the circus Tennessee game on QAM Q driving right past your building on 441 couldn't
hear as long as it's not coming out of the studio there's no crack one no cuching no nothing it
sounds great yeah what it means long as it's not coming out of the studio why would that have
anything to do with the signal I guess because it was west with one I don't know if it's
sounded fun though I mean you know it's breaking up so bad on 441 now I can't hear yeah you
can ever hear us on 441 that's by intent Saturday Saturday it was fun though but it was a football
game that wasn't anything you know what our first choice would do a lot better if they could hear us
on 441 because most of their audience is right by those gun shops yeah probably yeah
so it's done great yesterday a lot better than the type okay thank you sir thank you okay so far
it's unanimous we don't have one person now come on it can't have been that good okay I'm sure
he did a fine job and it was my idea in the first place and I'm delighted to hear it but there's
got to be somebody out there some cryptic asshole he really sucked okay something like that just
uh so we don't get a big swell hit like Joe Rose day lines are wide open five six seven oh five
sixty look at that we just passed the 300 mark the Dow is up 302 points and then as the 72
yeah let's get it up there about 7800 points and then sell everything and then just calm down okay
then just sit back and relax and laugh at it you know speaking of money Lorenzo here's a Boston hello
hello yes sir hi good morning I'm calling to beat up on the song Florida fans yeah I'm a dog fan up here in
Boston um what's the deal done in my game last night by the way yeah what that I said nice game last night
yeah actually I was reading the article and now they might be held this morning you stole 5,000 tickets
available you know the dolphins are the only marquee team and the NFL it doesn't sell out from
systems yeah you know Buffalo is crappy as they are Buffalo has got all their games already sold
out this year the whole thing yeah he's just sold out for the Jacksonville way can you give me it
you know I'm 3000 miles away why we're with the problem down this is miss sports town you know
that what do you mean look around here no it's not ridiculous I wonder how come the newspapers here
didn't have the attendance you know you of them like all these other schools they beat up on our
girl school again Saturday East Tennessee State I wonder how come they didn't put the attendance
what was in there in the orangeville we were very interested to see how many showed up and they're
too embarrassed to put the attendance in there because the only time it's a real big football town
is if a number one team is winning your big game or number two the opponent happens to be like a
marquee you know like Florida or Notre Dame or something yeah they're gonna lose the team you
know beautiful stadium like they say it's a marquee team they're gonna lose that stadium they're
gonna lose that team they're gonna lose what team the dolphins yeah okay I hear them complain I hear
everybody down they complain about their zinger and the mile ends and that I'm a red sock spin I've
gone a hundred years without a championship out of the wheat field we don't complain like that
that they don't show up for the dog and the red socks you'll feel it's a minute just a minute the red
socks took the field last night and your people at the anyway park booed the crap out of them
sir I have two satellite dishes I don't miss a thing they booed the crap out of
and then they finally came from behind a you know pulled it out there David Wells is
going to lose the season by the way what a guy he is you know the difference between a red
sock though with the red socks can show up when the red socks are bad they tell them how bad they are
because that's a sports town you don't have to tell me that that's right well buy some kick it
huh okay try to get the patriots to win a game will you all right okay yeah they they they just
the same old crap you know blood so he's confused he's wasting all his time out it's same old
crap for them every year we have an open line see these people think that the other guys in the
space of the sports experts I see more sports in one day than most of these guys see in two weeks
all these guys that talk a big game what they're talking about open line and date one and
brownered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's Coral Springs
hello I'm morning ill yes sir I have a new Seville and I have the same problem I took it to the dealer
yeah and I left the gas cap off at the gas station I'm here like that it's a gas cap thing yeah
and here the and here the slightest flash you know I could have gotten killed in this damn thing because
of the computer reduced engine power what about if I was in the middle lane they're going like 70
miles an hour and all of a sudden it decides reduced engine power and I can't even accelerate well
the your computer in your car has a memory and take it to the dealer and the memory will read back
what the problem was I think my computer's got Alzheimer's probably I think I got a Ronnie Reagan
computer and I say something about Georgia yes sir he was downright almost brilliant I mean his
monologue yesterday was just great I was great and anybody can get a goldstein calling him up and
telling him how great he is I he has my admiration I want to tell you I got a tape I'm the only
person in the world who has a videotape made by L Goldstein personally for me how to put how to
stick the key in his apartment door in Amsterdam and open the door and I'm going to tell you it's a
production this thing probably up for three Academy Awards well I'll did something for George that he
wouldn't do for you what's that you offered him women yeah oh he's tried that with me all right have
a great day pal yeah this is this is on the heels of Al being in here a couple of days ago playing
grab ass with me I used to you know I I showered ten times when I left here that day oh god don't
take it personally I lost you want to and he and as you saw how fatty was on his tape this and
this tape was only what a couple weeks ago with the end of August he has put on a course rose
he must be feeding him and feeding him and just just bulking him up getting ready for the you know
what I'm saying two open lines and date one and powered five six seven oh five sixty pound five
sixty on the mobile one line mobile in Miami hello Neil yes sir I listen to the entire show
yet they give George nine and a half to a ten wow it was it was great you know and you know he
wasn't doing the professional stick stuff and he had a lot of crap talk about yeah you know he
didn't have any of the chronic son you know we all can't be like the bird but he didn't have any of
the chronic son and you know he had a lot of reasonable stuff to say and it was great you know
those tapes you know the tapes you know you can only hear you know I'll you know back from
hurricane Andrew so many that's right and you know George did a hell of a job excellent all right thank
you so much you're all right have a good George said the checks in the mail all right thank you how
do you like that the verdict is almost unanimous this audience doesn't want any part of God damn best
of tapes worst of tapes tape replays I don't give a crap who it is they suck they absolutely
positively suck and except for those rare occasions when we both have to be on vacation at the same time

mental block now I have perhaps like that computer I've blocked it out of my mind Lenny Mark Keds

I haven't even figured out what three is yet we have two open lines and day one and brownered 5 6 7 0 5 60
pound 5 60 on a mobile one line here's Miami hello hello yes sir yeah first time listening first
time listener yeah listen that look correct I just heard you're making by the Boston fans got a
thought I thought I'm a Miami I'm a new England fan in Miami and I get a little crack I made
about the Boston fans I said they booed the red socks when they came on they did and they did
they did yeah did you see the game last time I just want to know why I can't you guys ever sell
out of the goddamn game here we do sell out games once in a while whether they're like win 3 4 5 in a row
don't don't you know I'm not sure you're not arguing with me this is the most bogus sports town in
the world I know that I'll argue with somebody wants to argue with you okay not bad enough we got
the New York fans sports fan not only that's not a sports show go call one of the sports shows call
Hank this afternoon hill hang up on you two seconds we have an open line and day one and brownered 5 6 7 0 5 60
pound 5 60 on a mobile one I go back to Fenway Park okay go back and shoot pigeons with Ted Williams
and Fenway Park on your day off get out of our face you know that now all of a sudden we got
Boston fans they finally won again they've been choking like a goddamn accordion lurches like
their famous for Toronto has been what were they 150 games behind them with about two weeks to go
and all of a sudden that Boston loses every day until they finally pull the game out last night
and all of a sudden they're talking a big crap okay Boston's a real city if in fact Boston
what a coincidence I have from American Express the travel and leisure the big thick one the
annual one where they have a pool of their 10,000 readers of people that travel all over the world
and really know what the world is all about as opposed to most of you who never go more than 10 blocks
from home and this year's top 25 cities in the world which Boston is number 20 don't see Miami
on there nowhere don't see any Florida cities on there nowhere the top 25 cities in the world
based on attractions culture people value and restaurants and Boston is number 20 which your
let's see Chicago say well I'll give you the list in a minute three of them by the way
more than three of them like a bunch of them are like an Australian New Zealand well it may be great
on there but who the hell are you know who can afford 10 weeks to fly down there by the time you
get there it's time to turn around and come back oh yeah those Boston fans we add great okay in the
meantime you lost your game last night it was the same old tired stuff I'm pulling for the patriots
in the you know same old tired baloney nice field go kick into there by the way if there's
anybody out here in this audience can kick up all more than 15 yards like on a straight line
you're signed up immediately same with the bills there here little duck flutty comes out there
on Sunday little duck flutty man I love duck flutty because of that hail Mary touchdown Jesus
that hail Mary if you're against the hercones years ago I'll never forget that as long as I live
for BC comes in there to touchdown passes for the bills he leads him down the field gets him in
field role position and Steve Christie who blew an easy field goal early in the game he blows it
wide again you saw he pulled it he was pulling it in the football too I think new Christie could have
done a better job than Steve Christie kicking at field roles they blow another big one
unbelievable part of the the ongoing and continuing american tribute to mediocrity of pan
guys lot of money who can't do squad 10 57 at 5 60 4 6 the q a l the Neil Roger Fort Lauderdale
wheels if you got the balls to give them a call just remember that he won't take your crap
these George George Fort Lauderdale's cleanliness he can be
you won't find no cheese don't give him no you am what do you want
George George Fort Lauderdale's
critics on a bench it's 11 to 1 at 5 60 w q m so here the top 25 cities in the world as
voted by the people who read travel and leisure the american express people who got a few bucks
and travel around all over the place number one in the world which I never been here and I
never will go there is Sydney Sydney Australia it's the only city to place in the top 10 for every
one of the five categories Sydney must be great but good luck to you number two guess what number
two in the world is George answer them namster damn snow on here what Rome Rome Italy baby
run on the heels of Sydney number two is Roman if the pope wouldn't be so damn a dictatorial it
will probably be number one number three which Florence how do you like that two of the top three
are in Italy what a concept huh number four fan Francisco number five Melbourne so two of the
top five the greatest cities in the world are in Australia number six Venice then you know we're
not talking Florida either by the way Venice Italy three of the greatest six cities in the world are
in Italy manjula ganja baby number seven Paris
uh
followed by van koever number nine new york
number ten london number eleven queens town new zeland
followed by Toronto number twelve and then Vienna Jerusalem putz down jesus
fifteen christ church new zeland boy what a quenella that is we got Jerusalem and christ church
back to back followed by Chicago Seattle number eighteen Washington DC New Orleans Boston number
twenty oh Victoria BC Madrid Bangkok can we say that San Miguel de aende Mexico and
Wellington New Zealand number 25 so three of the top 25 are in New Zealand and two in Australia
so if you want it you want to be where it's really good you got to go down under that's where it's
good is down under it's under the table as long as the house knocked on here so there you go the
25 greatest cities in the world Rome and Florence are number two and three I rest my cave
what happened to brow it okay what what's going on here all the brow line just crept out the
right away to us didn't he five six seven oh five sixty pond five sixty on the eighteen T wireless
line they're busy I'm sorry sorry I came back north Miami hello good morning yes sir George was
absolutely brilliant brilliant I'm telling you not just good he was brilliant you hit it he's right
on the head with uh he was knocking his fellow uh it's fixed it's fixed yeah he couldn't put it
better words I mean this exactly how most of us think and also yeah also you're talking about
Doug Flutey I mean why is everybody got a knock on this guy because he's little little little
guys always get you know in sports they always they're always putting them down oh they can't do
this yeah right Whitney Stu Barnes these guys can't play and there are a lot of little guys who
are tremendous got big heart yeah exactly I mean this guy already playing Canada but he's still
he did good up there hey you know he was in the CFL for eight years with the Argonauts right he was
the player of the year in the league six out of the eight years yeah how can you beat that Joseph
Gaki Gaki the other day he was well is the Gaki sucks okay okay yeah well anyway have
opened up his big mouth at his opinion all of if uh if looting's got to play this Sunday he got
the dolphins you can count on the dolphins winning I swear I'm a dolphin fan but I hope they lose
this weekend if they shut down the Gaki first of all he's not going to be starting because this
rookie who played terrible I saw most of that game uh sorry yes Sunday and uh the kid is horrible
and so the the rookie's gonna start but the dolphin fans should hope that the the kid is healthy
and that's who he doesn't come in again because if looting comes in there in trouble I by agree
even at his age he's 35 years old he's still mobile he's still a lucid he's still ran for two or
three first downs he's a hell of a competitor let me tell you something you get about George but
I don't know I don't know he's sucking up here but go ahead what's Lindsay I mean God's how can
he even put him in the same category as a punky little sports geeks at night because he doesn't
know the difference exactly okay bye bye have a great day pal there you go yeah we like putting the
kids on here giving them a chance the kids yeah we're not talking about five and 10 year old kids okay
tough they put on here like that lady Marquez Jesus God and Joseph two open lines in brown one
and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t line mobile in Miami hello
mobile in Miami hey Neil yes sir hey how's it going in day buddy okay buddy I was uh flipping
the TV the other night and I saw George Bush on TV and uh there was interviewing him or how he
lost the election in Clinton the first year and then they had the uh the guy who was the special
council remember when it was um investigating that route I run what country fair yeah well yeah and um
and then they had I didn't know that they had indictments put them guys right at the time of the
election and Bush was saying that that the Democrats is messing them up and that's why Clinton is
going through what he's going through and everything like they did but I don't see it you don't
see what this is all payback this is a payback for that and it's payback for watergate you got one
we're going to get one of yours they've been looking to get this guy out since the day before even got
in and then uh they have the special council that was a uh Democrat but the council have some uh
do they feel that Clinton should be for being they said no because compared to our
account for the scandal that there's one thing is personal so you know if you want to if you
want to do it that's his personal life email okay pal uh no you take care of that
I bless your president and bless the USA and get on here yeah it's a bunch of bull crap but I
still want to know the media very selective how come we're not here a lot more about Dan Burton
this pious righteous right wing son of a bit from Indiana who's uh screaming and yelling
calling the president of scumbag how come we're not hearing about more about him that father this
illegitimate child while he was married and how come we're not here a lot more about Pat Robertson
who had a kid that was uh you know born 10 weeks after they got married well that must have been
another touchdown Jesus another immaculate conception another miracle you look next time they show
you a picture that shrouded to rent his hands are like straight up in here it's gonna
have to do with the crucified I mean who for crying out loud better in the world of color touchdown
and Jesus here's Miami hello Miami hello winners this how much uh great how was Toronto Toronto is great
you get cleaned up did I work it cleaned up cleaned off never been there though I've been to Montreal
I would not go there to I didn't like it no Toronto's great Toronto's the number 12 greatest city in the
world right according to the people that know something right Quebec is even worse what is it
Quebec is worse than Montreal oh yeah too many frogs yes yeah so George did good okay even though
he picked on the spics a little bit yeah that's fine okay great they deserve it okay me go okay
see me I'll be this so where how come we're not here for many women today that's pretty unusual
what do you mean off the year they don't want to go numbers what do you mean they don't want to go
on the year you know they don't know what's going on that doesn't count okay that doesn't count
what kind of a pussy a whipped thing there's that we got women calling in here off the year oh you
will mind the pleasure nobody cares about you whispering in unless you're giving a phone number most
of you are too old anyway it's not interested two open lines in date five six seven oh five
sixty pound five sixty on the 18t lies still can't get over what a fruitcake rob capitol look like

hard it's after 11 at five sixty WQM what do we got going on today anything we got anybody on
here a staff room tank here what's going on oh dude nothing there sorry no schedule
wait to know it's a holiday weekend I guess Blufflin's he couldn't be bothered sending us over
a schedule for later on we try to assume Hank is on today from a summer but I'm not sure where
the sporting brews from the sporting brews because it's Tuesday but we don't have no schedule over
here because that's where it is because Blufflin's he probably was on another busman's holiday we have
two open lines in date one and brown five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the 18t
line the factions are pouring in here's one that's uh I can't believe Santana formerly a pierced
Leahy remember those factions that used to come in from pierced Leahy like real chronic like eight
million of them thank you so much Santana whoever you are your music sucks by the way here's one that's
George was fine at least he had a show and didn't take requests like the bird didn't play their
rack he sounded like an adult in other words as opposed to like uh some of the kids we have on the
ear here he was no goldie with a squeaky voice or hanks board officer producers that sound like
three year olds amen why does the station continue to have kids do the baseball show before the
pregame show with bird with boog with bird boog bird I'll tell you why because they they've if
they've had an adult in here they have to pay them some real money why does this station have kids
do spots that people pay good money for there is a real good question that I've been asking for
the last eight months and several odd days since we've been here George was not boring but could use
a little a life for future shows my only problem is he's constantly be feared for you as the old man
or the old fat man or something like that which is the nicest thing most people say about me here's
another one from uh lawyer no less Alan dear Uncle Neil loved your yesterday however beware of the
eyes of Julio suggest you immediately go out and rent all about eve before it's too late
okay or rent Adam and the Steve before it's too late is that what it was oh speaking of Adam and
Steve what I do with that letter to the editor oh here it is in the hero today because these
newspapers just can't give up on his conversion bull crap I mean they're obsessed with this
and here's a letter from Charles Burr drives with purge in pompato beach campaign not in tolerant
homosexual activists are trying to shut down the center for reclaiming america's truth in love
ad campaign the point is that homosexuals can change thousands have those who have our thankful
that someone offered a way out why is it why is that intolerant or hateful seems to be the most
decent thing to do the last sentence of this letter seems to be the most well I got news for
a child's burgey burgey and pompato beach purgey how about being a decent guy and turning into a
homosexual if homosexuals can become heterosexual then I'll come heterosexual can't just say
poof I'm gonna be a homosexual huh it seems like the decent thing to do as whole you idiot
we have two open lines and date five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t line
anybody ever been in the city australia or Melbourne I mean if it's the greatest city in the
world we'd like to find out what else going on it it's so great here's the moral gables hello
meal yes sir yeah two din yesterday thinking I'd only two din for like 20 minutes or so just to
check it out and you were glued to it I actually was I was entertained pretty very interesting
but he was talking he was talking I'm trying to get there about how great Montana was and seeing
it's pretty I didn't think he knew anything about football all right well we told this to him from
Montana I think it's so great but I want to know that's that's that Kazinsky and you know
like a guy who shot at the capital they don't look there because people mind their own business
to the other people people mind their own business just like in Arizona while they're building
bombs yeah Montana Freeman I mean they come all the moons bunch of moons living up there
but they're right eastern part anyway and they all have orange here they look like boogshambah
they all have orange here it looked like they've been doing in breeding for about 500 centuries
right so I thought that might just be something to be aware of well see sure that this is always
kind of a summary I don't dwell on it but George's biggest problem is that he spent most of his
life in Montana North Carolina and Florida so you put that together I mean now what do you expect
yeah he's damn it's good he just can't afford to go anywhere I mean if they ever decided to pay
me anything that'll be different story hey I saw something on Discovery Channel in Sunday night
about see post office yeah about theft and all that and they had one piece they had one piece
where a postal inspector gets called out and temporary postal delivery guy had dumped his whole
sack of mail and a dumpster yeah and I was wondering maybe your mail was in there I wouldn't be surprised
right okay thanks for the good news yeah wouldn't be surprised but you know something I don't care
anymore just like I'm just like Chris Darden said it's uh I don't give a sh** that's exactly the
way I feel I got the the mail is coming very slowly it's dribbling along and uh so far I you know
my credit has been ruined yet it's getting close but not yet two open lines in day five six seven

despair now we're talking Pat but it's true women I guess being I don't know what the excuses maybe
they've been conditioned differently or whatever it is but they get very very sensitive when you start
picking on any woman even if it is some psychotic bitch but I wasn't picking on them I wasn't
talking about that I was talking about me this is not about you just because you did one show
mister it is not about you yet okay next week here's Hollywood hello Hollywood Neil yes sir this

made connections there why was there for a day I missed the connection on the way back and I had

this crappy old guy with a dress in a silly cap how can anybody respect the guy with a silly cap oh

about the space to put things well no wonder you had every square inch of that countertop for a
crap let me ask you something is there anything that I need to have immediately that I can put

foot too and that car is like coming to a screeching called reduced engine power so you tend to get

probably nine at five sixty wqm that I was lost about a hundred points of its game but it's
still up to fifteen it's uh hey if you need some 14 at five sixty qm it's interesting to hear all
the comments almost all them and very glowing and praising George did a great job yesterday
but uh- somebody brought me in a cassette tape of the highlights of George's performance in
which you know when you hear the real thing it's a lot more revealing than just hearing everybody
talking around let's hear what it sounded like see
okay two open lines and date know what they like the five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the mobile one line he must have been sending out free samples too uh
here's plantation hello hill yes sir I was wondering if you happen to notice in the paper that
the L.A. King signed granados just did a cold color for the hockey games games
uh you think I think it's got any women in mind to pull uh
color for our pants is other than sure what language are you speaking what are you talking about
I read in today's uh USA today that the L.A. King's of Hyatt only for not a sister
to do the color commentary on the L.A. King's hot today the colored commentary will maybe Kevin
Witt's can do the colored commentary because he don't look like he's gonna be standing up to be
playing anywhere we have two open lines in date one and brownered five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's Kendall hello hey how you doing this is
a ride everyone from happy book today um football that got a little more and it's about the
L.A. King's color commentary nobody thank you um I thought George did a really good job yet today
yeah um I enjoyed he was pretty fresh you know he said what was on his mind then tried to
clear put around the city but he didn't everything see yeah and uh oh how about that see and uh
I thought uh one thing I want to say about is there's nothing I enjoy I love watching Michigan
Williams but I hate root for Notre Dame yeah I hate it that's the only time I ever root for
Michigan is when they're playing Notre Dame in 80 they stuck the joint I'm telling it with the
worst tackling team in the history of college they couldn't bring down my grandmother and she's
been dead for 22 years and she's doing a jogging across the field that's right across the goal line
and I don't understand why Las Vegas wasn't on the list all the funnest time I ever had in my life
yeah I want to say hi and I'm good to have you back but George did do a pretty good job
excellent thank god okay see ya take it uh that's right that shows you how bogus this list is
because Las Vegas I guess you're not supposed to have too much of a good time maybe that's why
this list is a little restricted Dave County's open 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line
here's a lady in Oakland park hello hello yes man hi how you doing a lot of back thank you um you
were missed but I have to be honest with you I didn't listen to George yesterday I was in the house
so I didn't hear him you didn't hear him no I forgot all about it actually oh my god
but um I would like to hear him that you can't have any complaints anyone no I don't know any
complaints good if I'm not in the car I'm usually not listening and I work for a living in my car
so I was off yesterday her change right but I would like to comment on something if I'm
and that's the new God billboard up and down 95 the Neil God billboards uh no good just god himself
oh putting up billboards now and all the same what are they saying um what part of thou
shall not do you not understand God and another one I thought said meet me at my house on
Sunday a Rosalo pes yeah so I just they're trying to get the message across I'm sure in fact
isn't Sunday the 13th oh probably today's the uh huh I'm sure right a Rosalo pes on Sunday I
feel told you so bad for the people that live in her neighborhood isn't it pathetic the God
squad man they become more and more intolerant they're all over the oh and then yesterday I was
watching the news last night and we're showing that anxious right wing piece of tirtil looks like
he's from Mars that Gary Bauer interesting presidential hopeful Gary Bauer I'm going to tell
you something I'm going down today to the passport office and get that thing renewed so far presidential
hopeful my god unbelievable he makes pair Robertson seem like a good humor man we leave
John to worry about him getting any blow jobs right well right maybe given a few have a great day
thank you see yeah thanks for the good news okay date your order this is brutal man I thought I
yesterday George would have this audience worked up for me today and come back they'd be there'd
be an outpouring and it was the same I sat down here nothing nothing had a weedle and tweedle
and twiddled these people like from the very get go today all three lines in date are wide open
and one and brown and fine of course it's the day after labor day every day that I've done this
show when we weren't given stuff away of course every other day 22 and a half years there's been
some excuse what is it today it's a full moon it's today after labor day it's a Monday it's something
something to excuse these people and we had one call today about Mark McGuire it's number 61
yesterday against the Cubs no against Mike Morgan with your nice high fastball air nothing
the greatest moment in my lifetime in sports I would say except those forced
and they cubs the leaps one a lifetime ago unbelievable excitement and these people like and
I'm going to tell you right now if I have one negative comment about Mark McGuire I'm going to
go ballistic you think I did a lot of time on that pad from the racetrack with that program business
but I'll guarantee there's a bunch of old parts in this town for still ready to find something
negative about it because this guy you know ain't no babe Ruth or whatever they want to come up with
and by the way do I the guy was right last week back in those days in the 20s
when they had different rules when they didn't have the same ground rules when you hit
out like what would be a ground rule double that bounced into the stands that was a home run
and I have a feeling we have no way of knowing the records how many of them no it's
isn't to take anything away from baby Ruth but I'm sure that some of those 60 home runs in 1927
maybe some of them bounced into goddamn stands how do we know
Mark McGuire the one guy the one guy that kids can look up to they're not going to be out there doing
the andro and then I'm not going to be in hurricane andru and then I'm not going to be all like a
bunch of muscle bond freaks which how come the way he talks about Jose Konseko when it comes to
muscle bond freaks and steroids or it's because he's Cuban and he's from this town okay
and speaking of from this town let me say it again Alex Rodriguez I'll use sports experts
who talk on his station probably be the greatest shortstop in history of this game he's from
this town is anybody ever talk about him no because he's not Cuban he's from LaBri
public in the minicana like all the great baseball players like Sammy Sosa they're from LaBri
public in the minicana that's right that one big island one side of the island they're so
on the baseball the other side of the island they're hitting them that's right whatever the hell that
means here's a mobile in the for-later day oh hello great any you George did a great job by
the way but that's how I'm calling okay let me ask you a question are these people catching those
baseballs are they stupid given them back to Mark McGuire for a kiss shirt what do you mean by that
I mean I would not know they're not stupid they're giving they're doing whatever they want to do
when Roger Meris hit a 61st home run the guy that caught it came and brought it back to him and
Meris gave it gave it to him and he said get whatever you can for it the guy the guy got five grand for it
right but now they're saying that like the 60s back in it's gonna be like over a million I said I
would never I mean I'd go to the highest fitter and I'm a fan sure do you understand what I'm saying
to in other words like the little kids that got the ball and they brought them to him the kids here
and they didn't want money they were offered like thousand dollars by some guy who was like
standing right there waiting to intercept them and get the ball for like your fun and profit
they turned it down they didn't want money why why why because McGuire makes millions of millions of
dollars this gets paid from the middle wait wait a minute what does McGuire have to do with whether
or not they get something otherwise you think he should pay him for it yeah that's only because
he can pay him for the baseball you can't apply for middle income how do you know that they're
from middle income housing whatever whatever that means how do you know how what they're from

Neil yes sir I'm so glad you went to a break instead of letting you follow us two hours
these calls oh god they're a pathetic I mean what's the problem doing the right thing that's what
these people are doing they're giving the fall back to being nice guys they're actually missing the
game the guy that got the whole month on the first inning this cheering team it took them away
yeah you get the rest of the game you had to watch it on TV right right so the face making a
sacrifice for him you see in a good giant you doing the right thing by giving it back and not only
that what is it this guy's business that he's telling other people what their values ought to be
if the if the guy wants an autographed baseball and a batter whatever they want him that's enough
that's his business that's right and this guy this guy's knocking people who aren't greedy like he is
exactly from the men this playery that doesn't have a blotch on his I mean not one negative thing
you can say about him and these people got no interest in him down here because he's not
making that a big deal maybe this is first for the negative maybe there's so used to
all the universe I guarantee if Alan's proud regans was Cuban he'd be on the front page of the
front section of the Harold every god damn day let's see home run again just a second home runs
and he's got 3080s right on the verge wow and by the way if anybody cares Griffey at 49 and 50
last night but nobody cares because he's you know yeah but this is this was my day rocks with
you in the week something like that have a great day so choked up he's emotional about it we have
an open line in power at five six seven oh five sixty the Dow is now up a hundred ninety four
it was up three hundred and five very early on but it's starting to a slide back in the reality
nazdax up fifty five who knows it's only twelve thirty it's only twelve thirty don't get too
excited about it okay because it's just a momentary blip in the midst of a very here's the south
beach hello south beach you hear the sound yes sir how you doing okay all right well I just
wanted to call about Marlboro and family so so I think they're unbelievable and I don't I don't
care if anybody puts them down for make it not narrows his record you know beaten but it's been
it's been there for what forty years thirty seven years yeah so you know I think it's a hell of an
accomplishment I can't wait till tonight and not only that but people were saying a few weeks
ago why you know if he does it less than a hundred and fifty four games but they got still 20 games
to go and he's gonna break the record the next day or two there's almost no question about it
I would think unbelievable I would think him and Sammy are both gonna hit home once tonight and
possibly even more than one I'll be watching well so I'll be right there at work but I got a
big big call TV award I'm gonna just go put out really okay have a great day thank you see what
there you go there's somebody's gonna be watching isn't gonna be waiting to see how much is
you gonna get for them there's so many of these people like that little sucker Geldy every time I
hear you know I was striving to work this morning this is the gods honest truth I turned on
I just hit the button on a radio no secret or yet and I hear that voice
ma'am ma'am ma'am immediately I pop the CD in her so fast and so hard and nearly went to the
guy named dashboard how in God's name can anybody out what credibility is there in some little
pusillanimous punk with a squeaky ratty voice who's nothing but a little ass sucker where's no
idea what he's talking about ma'am ma'am ma'am yeah get out of here send him to camp for Christ
takes going that so up here on or do something for him to do all of South Florida gigantic
favor please put him into a coma for 20 years at least for four years anyway here's a mobil
in Stewart hello hey Neil how are you okay sir good deal listen I was following in regards to the
market wise saying and you looked at the last couple of years there was no excitement what
the weather and baseball right I think this is fantastic I think it's LL's R&T Rose and going for
4192 like 10 years or so ago I think it's about time all these people with the talent
forces you shut the hell up and start celebrating some fun again baseball I think maybe they should
take up a hobby like Russian Roulette would be good for some of them yeah exactly a full of good
favorite crap limbaugh right hey thanks Neil I'll go have a great day pal we have an open line in
Broward 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the mobile one line there is nothing in all our sports I heard
somebody call it in over the weekend on some show not here oh well you know there's records
that are more important than this a Joe D and there's no record in any sport that is more sacred
that is more significant I'm not saying there aren't there aren't achievements there are greater
but in terms of the significance with the public than that home one record period so it's only a
sport big deal at least it's something something we can be positive about something we can get
excited about we got the presidents getting ready to be impeached we got Dan Burton is admitting
he father and illegitimate child back in the early 80s but nobody's talking about that we got
the goddamn sadoms over there they're six months they're going to be ready to start to do a nuclear
weapons or whatever they're going to be doing over in Iraq we got all kinds of crap going on all
over the world I mean the whole economy of the world is in a shambles and what are people negative
negative even if there's something good going on did I see Miami on his list by the way of the
top five thousand cities in the world of the top 60 thousand places to live no
here's the Miami hello hello Neil yes sir how you doing okay I agree with you that the home one
record is probably one of the greatest things in sports but where I'll tell you where I disagree with
you yes I really think if you look at what's happening this year you have three people at a
hundred feet over fifty home ones yeah got the RBI records it's in jeopardy that's been around for
more time I don't think so I don't think Gonzales got no chance you don't think so no what's what's he
got the records 190 right I don't think it's that right yes it is it isn't what is he I'm about
150 RBI's he's got 148 no chance what he good though but anyway I have 43 to break and there's
only like the I get you right I thought he was close with that why he pulled off like everybody else
yeah well with pressure maybe whatever it is but I'll tell you I think the ball is a little
off top you know there's so many people that are hitting over 40 ohm ones this year three over
50 and I like Mark McGuire I think he's a great guy has anything to do with it I think the fact
that you got a lot of crappy pitching you think it's a pitching you got expansion you got Arizona
you got Tampa Bay you got the Marlins which has got a little league pitching step you got very
inferior pitching and that's why you have more and more home ones and I think there's a different
pitching okay all right okay thank you okay every great day is gagging on it okay see God
works in mysterious ways he's cooking on his own words 23 till we're all gagging on it we have
an open line indeed 56705 60 time 560 on a mobile one line that Joe was in here gagging on
pizza yesterday is the room where we heard that's right not just the topping either he was eating the
crust and was I picking out over the weekend oh damn right dammit I'm as big as a god damn walrus
you know I sat there I sat my hotel room yesterday morning in my underwear looking watching the
TV and it was like a mirror I mean not on a mirror but like a reflective glass
yes and I sat there looking at myself sitting on that sofa on that cut a bed I have never been other
than when our gold thing came in here and tried to goose me your last ride I have never been so grossed
out and so it's because because when you're sitting you know how the fat kind of like
alt everything the drop the drone yeah everything like drops down and like is exaggerated but never
less and I'm I swear to god I had hooters that were as big as grandma Moses on a bed and my
puppet was like hanging down there I looked at that and I thought good god that's one of the most
disgusting things I have ever seen in my life that was before lunch 22 till one of QA
at the clambie negative because that's them they are negative sour nasty hateful people and they
want everybody else to be just like them and I refuse to do it I think it's a great thing I'm
going to be watching that game tonight and if he hits 62 I'm going to pee in my pants and the
kid who got the prize he did the right thing right because on down the line he did the right
thing he did the right thing for him if he wanted if money was all that important to him he would
have said okay I'm going to hang on to this because I was brought up to be a mercenary damn
a piece of crap and that's all I know is money money money and he's there because he's a sports
fan these people don't know don't you understand a lot of the people who listen to this radio station
they're not sports fans they're all gamblers if they couldn't gamble on a ball game or on whether
one leaf is going to hit the ground fallen from a tree before the other leaf hits the ground
they don't have any interest those aren't sports fans want to people like misery likes company yeah
okay pal come down see you and have a great day
yeah if you took the gambling out a lot of sports these people about I'd say 70 80% of maybe
long gone if they don't have a bet to hold their interest what kind of a sports fan is that a sports
fan no sir it's our guy with a gambling problem is what it is so what do you like Sunday we have two

you know the guy said stupid do you think in the guy that catches number 61 or 62 somebody's not
gonna do something for them one way right there right you know they're they're gonna be given a trip
somewhere or something that not not only that but you one thing that most of these idiots never
thought about and that is what makes collectibles valuable what makes a baseball worth a million
dollars what made baseball cards worth a lot of money when I was a kid collecting baseball cards
I had shoe boxes full of baseball cards and one day my mother threw them all out when I
went off to school and rightfully so because you're dog too huh with your dog and all through the
dog in the same way spas good and uh you know because who the hell would have ever thought anybody
would pay why is it worth something these things are only worth something if some maniac
besides that they want to pay a lot of money for it exactly exactly well why is that a fiber a
ten dollar baseball worth a million dollars just because it was the you know somebody hit a home
arm with it I just don't get it right so uh more power to the to the kids right me

Jose lembi it whatever that is this bald head of geek the southward insider no channel seven
this god for sánchez with only ninety seven son centel readers out of twenty seven hundred
picking him as the areas best news anchor wsv and channel sevens rick sánchez could use a few more
admirers but he won't find them among the sprawling pot luck nursery in david sánchez ordered more
than a thousand dollars worth of exorers and lyreo pays i'm not a plant god the plant around his
Cooper city home for his 40th birthday party he also ordered a few sánchezia plants because
their name sounded like his according to a pot luck sales hole sánchez however never picked up
the plants or paid for them could it be because the salesman didn't show up much enthusiasm when
sánchez asked for a channel seven discount said sánchez did i ask for a discount yes but not a
channel seven discount asking for a discount when you buy large quantities is not improper it's good
business whether you run television or the president says rick sánchez how do you like that
so not only is he a is he annoying and pretentious in pompous he's also a cheap fast dude how do you

Neil i'm not this uh maguire baseball saying i'm sorry i can't agree i you can't agree with one
i can't agree that these kids should have given up the baseball no way no how i mean if this was
in the 1930s 40s 50s maybe even the 60s yeah that wasn't the right thing to do but today
what do you like it can i just continue sir but today i'm gonna have a conversation i don't mean

do a big bowl wasn't about money then yeah it's all big bucks today yeah they'll get you to

baseball right when a rock those players world right there oh the owner of those baseballs world
upside down yeah yeah and what if they told him the stuff to baseball off his ass what then oh yeah
he's really gonna do that yeah no you'll see how fast they make a fair market value offer to
like how much whatever the market fair yeah and and that's it and your whole craft no that's not
no you know how powerful a craft why should these kids be the goat then though they're not the
ghost they could have asked for whatever they wanted they didn't want the money yeah but you're
telling you're telling kids get out of here they're innocent kids that's what they wanted they're
not dummies the guys did there with a hundred dollar bills after the one down here after 58 and 59

dam society they know what money's all about the first they don't say mommy your daddy anymore the
first thing they say after they start to speak is don't be fester that's right so don't give me
this crap about their naive little kids they just aren't mercenary like you are sir
air every time something good comes along we got assholes like this want to find the negative
let's work overtime let's work ourselves up into a fever pitch to find something negative so

let's put the knock on him because they're stupid and naive you're the one that's stupid
million dollars for a goddamn baseball and people you're crawling all over each other so
you can get their hands on a ball it might be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars because the
whole thing is and that's the whole point right there it's disintegrated none of them but dollars
and cents and here's a whole thing that's going on a whole event that's taking place that has the
country transfixed not because the goddamn baseballs are worth so much money but because of the
accomplishments of these guys so finally after all these still years we finally get something to be
enthusiastic about and we got a whole process the guys like this that's all they know is money money

is uh his tone but uh did a good job for the first time i think great um another thing
i think everyone is uh about this required thing
they're being really polite because it's required in soza as far as giving them back the ball

hear me out you take three million dollars from somebody who very wealthy you take all that money
and you donate to charity some aguiers and charities of your choice you pay and if you have
if you're just a minute didn't he already donate a million dollars cash to a charity for abused kids
sure but why not doing more money to get the money yeah okay why don't they know i'd
some more donate this okay the people that are looking for the money for and i'm looking to give
it a charity you jackass yeah take the money and give it take what money that's the point there
isn't any money unless people demand money and let me say it again in 1961 a guy that caught Roger
merriss's 61st on running Yankee Stadium took it to him after the game and gave it to him and
merriss handed it back and said get whatever you can for it kid and the guy got five thousand dollars for it
but he brought the ball back and wasn't looking for anything but here we are 37 years later
and that's all we know we got we got to squeeze some money out of these people okay somehow some way
and let me say it for the hundredth time that the people involved in baseball the owners and
everybody connected with it should be done in our hands and knees kissing Sammy Sosa and Mark
McGuire both on every cheek of their back dance right for bringing some interest back and making
this excitement with an otherwise a terminal deadly boring sport that's what they ought to be doing
after they slapped the public in the puts four years ago with that stupid strike
here's your lady mobile in deer field hello yes meh yes man I totally agree with you about the
baseball thing they should give it back it's not their accomplishment why do they want to sell off
something that's not there as he hits more home runs the prior ones become worthless the only
one they're going to be able to get money for is the one key breaks the record that's a good point
and it should go into the hall of fame yeah I heard a suggestion made somewhere I don't know if it
was here I was up in Philly for the weekend and God forbid that they should take the picture of
the person who touched the ball and put it in the hall of fame that'll be their 15 minutes of
fame isn't that ridiculous but you know why a million dollars for a baseball come on even
even look why I was like I'm not paying for it it's it's not it it's ridiculous my accomplishment the
ball is his not not only that but like I'm sure that somewhere in Cooperstown and baseball hall of fame
they've got a baseball representing the 61st baseball at Roger Maris you know the 61st
home run who knows if it's the real baseball who's not in my look one baseball looks like all the
other ones well they decided they're going to produce special balls that one of wire hits it's
numbered or it has his name on it so nobody can come forward say I caught the ball each time he
comes up now they have a special set of balls for him they have a special set of balls yeah wow
it's a side point but they've developed they have made these balls and they have a certain insignia
on them that when he hits if he hits one out they'll know that it is the one he hit and he should
get was like on drugs they were stoned out of their mind which is why most people want to go there
they got the good stuff here's big pine key hello yes yes sir I for the self-appointed critics regarding
George stellar performance yeah I don't know if anybody remembers when Adam was on for Rick and
I never realized I forgotten about that I tried to put it out of my memory well I never realized
until I saw you on TV what's involved with that job yeah I mean it looks like one of the hardest
jobs it's there and talk for four hours let me put it to this way it's a stressful four hours
it would be a good way to describe it you can't hide it it you can see that you're it's a stressful
job so kudos to George's stellar performance right regarding Rick Sanchez's account yeah
uh lariope and plant material I'm a miserable rich at Shoe opera I've been doing this for 30 years
plant prices the price of a lariope back in 1973 was about two dollars you know it is now about three
dollars I mean this guy I mean oh what kind of a he's four nursery in nursery they're just
barely hanging on by their teeth now bokeh brown was telling me lariope is also called monkey grass
is that correct yeah wouldn't that be perfect for Rick Sanchez's house yeah perfect sounds good to me
and here he's bitching about the fact that this guy's trying to squeeze a couple of box
profit and he's looking for a channel seven discount I'll give him a channel seven discount
don't trusty dollars the price of the plant if not I mean and and I'm speaking for all the
weed pullers out there that call them to installation contractors uh or landscapers uh where weed
baggots and and that's it I mean there's no money and I don't know why I've been doing I because I'm
brainless I'm sure but uh maybe the plant the price of plants has not
for somebody to ask for a quantity discount pretty embarrassing I think the word you're looking for
is cheap my friend and have a great thing thank you thank you cheap bastard that's what you are
Rick Sanchez oh yeah well when somebody buys something in large volume yeah thousand dollar deal
you want a goddamn discount of course you're making all that money mr. hot shot over there a channel
seven on Ed Anson's a big list making the big box turns down jobs to go out other markets because
he wants to stick around here see if he can knock any more other other people off at the ballpark
Rick Sanchez cheapest they come baby with his monkey grass
boy if ever they if ever there was a perfect plant for a perfect douchebag monkey grass for Rick Sanchez

vacuum pink uh yeah look at that just puff it away here here here's a mobile in high
hello hello yes sir yeah how you doing yeah great ask a question uh speaking about my
guires if everyone is speaking about him just uh question you think he has an outside chance to
before his career is over at least 700 oh months I don't have any idea how many he's got
yeah like I think close to 400 I guess does he well you know he's got a long way to go for seven
hundred that's why I'm asking these guys what 35 years old maybe he could play another four or
five years yeah four or five times and I have no chance even if if he had 50 year for four years
that's 200 more I know exactly it's uh it takes it takes many many years of consistent the hitting 40
and 45 and uh exactly you know well that's the question I'd ask okay okay see you
doubted okay here's a mobile in four lotterdale hello here we go here we go
hope this time will be good yes nail yes sir godjohn's the first time call it okay
all right now first of all he has four hundred and forty eight home runs no chance then
all right one more question he's got a chance at seven hundred and fifteen home runs I don't
depends if you know you say if he plays for his forty five fifty till he's one he has forty five or
fifty right yeah no chance okay now about the baseball I mean would it's like a you know he is
in the stands and the guy doesn't want to give it back to anybody he just wants to he doesn't want
to sell it either yeah he wants to keep it and what about that what about it you know
it's the you know title to that why not of course I mean he could take the home there's nothing
that forces him to give it back uh what and another thing would have you know my guard goes
to those slump and uh he's got a hit 62 yeah what about it then I guess he didn't uh hit 62
okay pretty profound here we go okay we have an open line and broder five six one he wanted the
other guy who's two a main person with a call he didn't do it five six seven oh five 60 pound five

every time the opposing team uh hits all them run they throw the ball back you talk about starting
an immediate riot can you see that hits number 62 night right there in the first inning in St. Louis
and some jackass some wise guys says hey I don't want to this thing I don't want this be
throws it back on the field 47,000 people come pouring out of the stands mass grab ass ride
out there running the goddamn field at Bush Stadium here's a mobile in Miami hello
nail yes sir good afternoon sir how are you great uh call it the chain through the taxes uh and I want to
kind of express this a last year I told my vehicle one of my cars and I'm told uh actually about
five six thousand dollars under the value in the book how much I know that I love five six thousand
I told the car for the Volkswagen in 94 for about eight thousand dollars worth about 13 to four
shapes I paid the sales I will actually I told it to the individual and uh they contacted me
about too much later from the State Department or actually Department of uh taxes and said that
I underpaid due to the fact that I sold the car for way less than it was in the book and I argued
that I basically told them to look this is a price that I wanted some well I didn't pay that they
finally sent me three or four notices I'm gonna paint over two hundred dollars in late payments
on the difference is about three or four hundred dollars to believe me they could do whatever
so in other words they just make up this new scan that you have to do what they they have a book
and they go by what the book is yeah well let me ask you this what does their books say about a
baseball yeah that's true what I'm saying they're telling you how do you determine what fair
market value is for a baseball that's involved in and breaking some kind of a statistical record
you're absolutely right just aren't you just how can they determine what I want to sell my car
right that's what I can't do it sounds like fascism to me and they get so taxual and I had to pay
the LLC and I had to pay the interest and the tax so you get screwed either welcome to America sir
thank you dorsavidanya wow how do you like that and I thought they were cleaning out the guy
damn IRS doesn't sound like it to me sure for nodding him that's like robin hood yeah that's right
little man that's right and giving it to the guy damn government again so we can waste all the
money on screwing around and then Burton can to go make some more illegitimate kids and I still want
to know how come this self-righteous pious piece of right-wing craft Dan Burton who sits there as
the chairman of the house judiciary committee by the way and is trying to stick that bull-dike in
jail and is called a president of scumbag we finally bring his ass out of the closet he's got
an illegitimate kid that he fathered back in the early 80s who's a teenager now
and there isn't there aren't ten words about it on a goddamn TV they're in five words about it
anymore story came out over the weekend that's the end of that but we're too busy investigating
the president and going in an air-beard goddamn gory detail of what she did with a cigar where she
stuck at yada yada and they did an allimo and so on talk about the pot calling the kettle pink
in the purple with polka dots who the hell are we kidding here huh and all these spineless
gutless man now it's the middle of September and all these politicians running like crazy oh yeah
well you got an abortion coming up we ought to cover your ass that's what you're worried about
well let's take Miami with ten question marks hello sir for the first time I disagree with you
yeah okay I if I would cast out all I'll catch it in what's a big problem with that I don't
see what's a big deal and why do you why do I set it up to you is what I said and then go go
over to public and get some fish food let me say it again it's up to whoever catches it if you
want to do that fine and if not that the kid the guy is knocking the kids that's what we had a whole
bunch of these people knocking kids or anybody else who doesn't want a trillion dollars for the
guy damn baseball that's up to them that's up to them and I think it's a breath of fresh
year that not everybody is country consider only about money it isn't just mercenary and wants
to squeeze every damn dime out of what they can get markets up to twenty five
149 and the NASDAQ up 63 you know I I'm wondering about these people who are buying all this stock today
they can jump it on this uh what what are they thinking about huh well what are they really
thinking about why would you be buying today see I'm looking at it thinking oh maybe now I can
get out you know that kind of thing if they do this for a couple more days maybe some of this can
get out you know I miss either you go with that goddamn money thing again all the important
in life than god damn money let me trust you guys ammo coast is the largest invest Chinese buffet
in the town but all over the place you're starting to see other Chinese red radio 560 q a
l the organizers got that many drivers and not they'll turn you back she'll smother you to death
as junk you sack that demon got it time rip for his life he did it her one time she thought
he was as wide where's your clothes where you're gone watch as you sleep you think it's casual
so
154 560 wqm these little hulio's like that last one recall oh well if I got the ball while
let me tell you pal the only balls you're gonna catch are in your mouth okay you're not catching
old baseball because the game is insane Lewis they're not playing any more games here this year
so you're not catching no ball you're not getting no million dollars you're not gonna pass go
it's everyone so on now I want you to understand if I were in a position if I were happy to be in
the stands and I caught the ball you're damn right I'd take the million dollars if somebody was
stupid enough to offer it to me that's not the point you want to give me a million dollars okay
thank you small bills please but the point is that there are some people including these kids who
have got different set of values and attitudes about it and then they're saying no way and the only
thing we're hearing about in regards to this except for maybe two or three other calls is that
you know how much is the goddamn ball worth how much is this worth how much is that worth
I'll tell you how much more to those calls are worth here's West Palm Beach hello hello Neil
yes sir how you doing great I couldn't agree with you more it's just I believe what it is our society is
so money hungry obsessed they're just like sick it's like a neurosis with these people that
when something like this does happen they're so shocked and you know what I mean no I don't
they're shocked that these kids have the why did I see when when somebody is this mercenary is
there yeah and you know like yourself if I caught the ball I would get the money sure but it's
great and it's a breath of fresh air to see the kids and especially down it four of them were hit
in Miami and and these people are saying oh well these kids are they're just kids you know they're
being misled and years from now I mean well maybe they were years from now say gee if I had to do
it again but in the meantime they're not doing it that's true it's such a breath of fresh air
and these assholes are just jealous they're just they're just psychotic wishing that they were
the ones out there tromping around in centerfield getting the baseball so they could have some claim
to fame you know I think the baseball players should take some advice from the kids I mean I got
some money stashed away and it's not because I caught a baseball sometime in my life it's because
I worked for it that's that's what it's supposed to be all about and I run around trying to
cash in on souvenirs Neil one more complaint I have yes sir have you noticed lately especially
here in West Palm Beach maybe in Miami nobody if you go to like a drive-through or something nobody says
thank you nobody says have a good day anymore all right what's wrong with that well that's because
this is South Florida it's unbelievable you're just catching on to that you go anywhere else it's
completely different that's right I was away I was in Toronto over the weekend you get in the
elevator with strangers good morning and whatever you walked on the hallway there's the
maid you never saw before in your life uh good morning I mean really people just being
friendly or nearly people not here is noticing more and more that's why the last time I heard
somebody say have a nice day was when Sandy Peyton opened an ambitious will and got all been
other show unreal and Neil how do we get what uh 69 in West Palm Beach with a good antenna all right
good luck pal how do they get whammy up there they're all seeing that thing on whammy we can't get any
numbers out of that station even mash can't even squeeze out of I think they got squiggly lines his
last time I check they got just little squiggly lines because people said not that Alan Alder again
fat not that damn McLean Stevenson how many bombs did he have there's a guy how many different
series the now seriously what do you have like 75 different series that they try to make a TV
star out of McLean Stevenson did anyone want to pan out no how about Jamie far like I said the other
they since the quiz shows went off don't see him no more and what do they have it on like four
times a night on whammy as often as possible as often as the law allows here's the North Miami hello
yeah yes sir Neil yes a about this ball business ball business yeah with my water uh-huh everybody
should be able to do whatever they want to do that's what I said that's right so what the hell if
you want to get the ball back fine if I got it I will take the money for it and not only that but
this is such a tremendous accomplishment is this all we got to talk about is how much money
people are going to get for the baseball why are people even worried about this it's good
that someone our principal still all right but you have money this kid don't have money if I was
if I was a kid I think the money but he that's what he's choosing not that's right it's up to him it's
a free goddamn country there you go amen uh-huh see uh-huh what do you say uh-huh that's what I
thought he said he's right he's absolutely correct all these people will stay and then not only
that but somebody told me a long time ago don't be a goddamn yanta okay what are you sticking
your nose would you you're gonna get something out of it no no got a little commission coming out
of it no what don't y'all worried and bet out a shape of a one the kids got money or not
enjoy the moment you know soak in the excitement okay course the problem like I said before is
that element of people they're not sports fans they don't root for teams all they do is make a god damn
bett and if they can't catch a bet they don't give a flying crap about any of the rest of this
if all yeah I'll tell you right now you cannot hockey all you want but is there anybody out there
with a grandma center if there's not gambling it goes on but is there anybody out there with
brains that bets a lot of money on a hockey game no of course not people who are fans are
certain of the sports they go there because they love the sport but like football they took all
the illegal gambling out of college and professional football you think we'd ever see another game no
there you go so let's get serious let's draw the line between people are really sports fans or
people are like getting sucked in this because of the excitement of the moment and the occasion
as opposed to those people are nothing but a bunch of chronic neurotic gamblers who can't sleep
at night because they just lost the guy damn mortgage money Hollywood would pen question mark
cello if we find an award for a game this year is what yeah we found me if I'm gonna win 40 games
this year right that's not like Andy from Hollywood didn't it Andy from Hollywood let's hear it
we didn't want his facts before even though we tried to compliment George yours and no thank you I
consider the source you an asshole so Andy from Hollywood has to get his call in here even
else almost hockey season I told him when hockey season starts it's only a couple of weeks away
in a one of a few days away before we open camp with no goldpender by the way
but Andy from Hollywood but I'm glad he mentioned that leave on god his brains bettered out there again
give up nine runs or something like that in four and a third of things hey Andy you think leave on
it's gonna win 40 games this year I got to do it we'll be lucky to win 50 games this year they
only got about 20 to go but be that as it may so wonder what so what do we solve here today we
decided George
