Oh, we're sorry the teller made an error. I don't know. We're supposed to be two people there when they open the envelope from the ATM and
I'll put you 2750 back in your account, but nothing nothing happens to the teller, but you know
You want to get good service next time you go there talk to the security guard. He'll get you straight. Oh the whack-and-nut guy
Yeah, he'll get you straight now. Yeah, he's a whack-and-nut. Okay. The wacky guy. He's whacking it
I mean maybe maybe it's only me maybe again. It's my peculiarities. I'm an eccentric old fart whatever it is
But I just find it very bizarre that when I would call my bank the security guard would answer shoot for you know, I
Don't get it
Too open line. I'm probably the only person in all of America who would be kind of taken a back by that
Yeah, and not even answered by saying
I mean I call bank, you know like like a business. Hello
You know, I figured maybe I got the wrong number and then as time is going along here
I realize I don't have the wrong number. They haven't like a grab as part of you over there in a bank
Two open lines and date five six and past eleven o'clock. You got it sports radio five sixty
Q a f
Kill the cold
I'm really sure why in fact, I'm always in a mood to hear that it's eleven fifteen at five sixty w Q
I want to thank my close personal friend Richard over at Emory Coast. They are the nicest people on the face of the earth
They wrote a letter to our sales department
It's a testimonial letter about the tremendous effect of advertising on their show and on this station and about their new
Location in North Miami Beach and how their opening has been far beyond what they were expected thanks to this show in my large
Loyal audience and you people out there Emerald Coast. Do we love them or why great?
But I mean this letter I've now you know over the years you get a lot of nice letters from sponsors saying yeah
We got great results and it's so but this is just this ought to be framed
It is just beautiful. Thank you, Richard
And I'll see you there this weekend by the way, and oh this well maybe one of these days this weekend maybe Saturday
We have an open line of date Rocky game on Sunday George life revolves around a hockey games
Maybe you tell by these dynamic hockey calls we get
I promise about the ice being so bad. We've had at least no calls about that
They don't know what it's all about. That's why they keep going back there and they're having a great time
Man, they just be bad today hey
Come on play it louders little louder more distorted come on louder. That's it. Right get up. Hey
You have a good time you believe us believe it. No, come on work on it. Get anyway. Oh
God why he said that
Let's go to a mobile in Delray Beach hello
Hello, Neil. Yes
Hey, what you're saying about the ice is right on man look at Evanton. They scored a quick point up
Edmonton according to that thing in a paper
Do they wish I guess you also saw it got the only really great ice in the whole national hockey league and the rest of the league sucks
And the worst ice is in these new buildings like the Macarena building
Hey, you know it's funny about your security guard. Yeah
He knocked down the cleaning lady to answer it no doubt
Unbelievable. Is that incredible story? It's a true story. I absolutely believe it in fact
That's the second year the second call the woman voice that was probably the cleaning lady right?
I
Mean I said is this so and so bank and there was like
Like a long pause and like like I caught them in the middle of something
Like maybe they were all in the vault together. I have no idea what was going on over there
And then all of a sudden it was kind of like a slow, you know, you hear the phone go like on the cradle like very slowly and like
Well, we don't have time for this Brad because there's nobody here that knows nothing right now
I
Mean one one thing I've discovered about doing business is that if it's a bank if it's a
Shoestor whatever it is you'll find people
Who really one or two people in most places a couple of people that really have their
Together, okay really know what's going on and then you'll find like a whole bunch of other people who have who are clueless
Kind of like around here when you come right down
There's us me and George and then
Okay, where do we go?
Here's a mobile in Hollywood hello
Hey, a long time first time all right anyway, you were talking about your 2k and
I was talking about it that doofol was talking about it. Oh, well you mentioned it as well too
That's what we have to look forward to anyway my employer just sent a letter to all the
10,000 plus employees saying that
Very okay great. He said the
It's the fan
We have an open effect that's it. Do you see I'm this morning? It'll hold big face full because the hit the fan
Yeah, open line of David. I just I'm sorry. I hate to keep talking about him and and now I understand why people hate me like poison
Are still drawn to the show and you're listening right now?
It no, it's kind of a perverse thing. I in the morning. There's nothing to watch anyway
You know, I'm getting ready to come to work. I'm sitting there taking all my vitamins and my my blood pressure medicine like extra doses before I come in here and
What
Oh Jesus this is embarrassing this hell
Matt yes, yes, yes you what's going on man? I've phone is light enough. What do you what's what's going on about a security guard?
You don't know the story I I've heard bits and pieces from people calling me here
We we don't have a security guard. Well, whatever the guy is well
Maybe he was just hanging out having fried chicken. I don't know it could be we have fried chicken
Everyone well there you go see that must have been Monday must have been fried chicken day
And you were out so you didn't get get any what happened
What happened was that I got one of those little notices in the mail
That said that I was overdrawn and it was somebody's mistake over there because I made it a positive and a
Wrote myself a check like I always do at the same time
So it was like a little a clerical error, which is no big deal
And I called there and you weren't there and the phone rang several times. There's this 330 on Monday and finally a
Dark-complexed person answered the phone you talking guy or a girl guy a guy
Oh
There's nobody here that fits that description and I said is Matt there is a I think she's here
I thought she must be on having that sex change. He's been talking about all these years man
I don't know it. I don't know what happened and so then there was like a long pause and some young lady came on
And I said is this Republic security bank and she's
And then there was like a long pause and then I heard the dial tone you called my number
Yes, and I called the number back
And I know it was the right number because she picked it up cold at next time this young lady and then I explain her the mistake
And she went better be better move better and while I said just tell me what the balance shows now
And of course it was plus you know a thousand dollars whatever. I said okay, then I guess it's been straightened out
But I just found it very and she said oh, Matt's not here today
He's out the hijacking somebody's car doing something. I don't know
You know what happens is we've got a phone here that is available for customers to use if they want to call their girlfriend or wife or whatever
Oh, and it might be that when you called you were calling in when someone was trying to call out and they picked up the phone
We're gonna have to take that phone away from the the customer service area
I thought it was a security guard. Oh, well, no, we don't we don't have one of those. Yes, you do I swear we don't have a security guard
What is that guy that's always standing in the lobby there?
He's just hanging out waiting for the chicken to come in what guy are you talking about?
There's often a guy that stands there with a black outfit on I
Don't I don't know who you're speaking of sometimes we got some jobs that come in here to make their deposits or
Not a cop like a security guard outfit. Maybe he just posing as the security guard. I don't know. We haven't had security guard in about two years
Yeah
So the bottom line is we didn't charge you anything right no no there's no problem with that that parts all straightened out okay
But it was just a bizarre
Experience you know I'm calling the bank
Expecting to talk to a real living and breathing person. Well, that's like some huh?
That's me also work, but you weren't there and so evidently some bulls are just decided he would pick up the phone
You know what usually it's like if you were walking past a pay phone
You know you've seen this happen you're walking past a public pay phone and it starts ringing and some people actually will pick it up
People do that right that that very well might be what happened and I'm gonna take just because of this
I'm taking the phone away from there. So anybody else wants to use the phone now. I'm gonna get blamed for that
Well, hey, what can I tell you that goddamn meal took our public phone away?
And we get lots of people the mail man. He's probably listening to you right now. He comes to use my phone every day
Here you go, but when I'm getting even with him
I apologize if you call here and you have a problem
You know who you are he told me to beat me and call my cellular phone or whatever that you this this should not have happened
I apologize for that
Anybody who's listening to me out there. This is not normal procedure
We don't have a security guard and if we did we wouldn't have a man to run the phone
Well, you had one for one day anyway
I would go check the fault if I were you out quick. I'm gonna go back there right now and check it
Okay, man. Hey, I'm sorry about no problem. All right. See you. Bye. There's my good buddy Matt from Republic Security Bank
So these are great guys get you right on the phone air tastes good care of me not good enough
But hey, he's got a wife, you know, we have an open line and date one and brown
Maybe that's what it was all about
Maybe there's just a couple of
Intruder's there who just happened to be wandering by the phone right?
Oh
Look at this five car accident i95 north-throwed approaching baby bull of heart
Oh, and by the way that bull that they were talking about yesterday that was not all the newscast that got loose
Was that on Davy road?
Oh, I don't I don't recall I thought that I didn't hear because I saw because I was driving home from my
Some lunch yesterday and I'm driving up Davy Road extension to 595 and I look over to the left there
And I see all these cop cars. There's a camera crew and I must have been the bull over there
That got loose which got tremendous coverage by the way you had a thought it was one of the most important stories and history man time
Little bit of loose
Bull in town
Anyway, the two left lanes of i95 northbound are blocked two cars of overturned delays are building rapidly back to rippen road
So if you're thinking about going northbound on i95 in that general area, I would be forgiven
Hit the Hershey highway
Let's see here's got back last week from tree weeks and I'm stood on and London
He says sorry, but London is one of my favorite places. I've been going there twice a year for the past 10 years
Oh my god all I can say is oh
Anyway to remedy your lament over no good food in omg stodom you might consider caprese spua strut 240 a tag in food with great any
Postal imposta
Casa de David
Wouldn't you know those Greeks would have a hole in the wall huh?
Right go. Yeah, I don't think he's talking about that kind of a hole in a nice going Alan. Do you ever have a way with words or what?
Hole in the wall with very fresh salads
And if you
They'll talk them right there. Yeah, and they tossed the salad also. Let's see. I'm saturday
The
Greenwood the what? Inuit yeah, that's something like that. It's either into it or inuit are they into it? Yeah, they are if it's in a bottle
They're in a way
No, the Inuit Indians they have this language, but like little
Good answer like this and how do you speak symbol? It's like trying to figure out how
Sanskrit
So finish is that kind of a language you look like that Indian it's got like instead of like tradition
I mean you'll look at some of the names of the streets like regulier beer or I start out
They're like 700 letters. I mean just uh, you know
You just become familiar because the arrow is pointing in the right direction and there's the place called conscious dreams over there
And the youth hostel meeting place and you got some idea that you're getting close to the right part of town
But in a possible language the only great thing being though is that everybody under the age of 100 over there speaks
English so no excuses okay for all you put these you want to go to London because you were afraid to go somewhere they know speak in English
People like that to me are just such party poopers people are to afraid to go like to Italy or to France or any place else because they know speak in English
Go to Italy that's half of the front of it
Because in all the big cities in Italy like Rome and Milan and for insor Florence
They're they're catered. They're geared toward tourism
And so you're going to be a trottery as the little mom and pop restaurants and again many of the places they have little baskets of menus
And they'll have the menu in Italian of course, but also in Spanish and English in uh, Chinese
Lots and lots of Asians by the way in Italy. It'll be like you're promoting by legalism buster
No, I'm promoting smart tourism
As opposed to the guy being French which if you don't speak French they won't yield an inch
You go to Paris if you know if you can't understand a little bit of the menu in French
Forget it because they will not accommodate you. They don't give a crap take your American money and vote out your ass
They don't want to know from you
But in Italy you go to any place and they will accommodate you whatever English it would a language you speak because they watch your money good business

5 6 7 0 5 60. It's like the people with assures when that show first started. Oh, he's wearing a blue shirt today
He's got the orange shirt on tomorrow and then he's got the Puse shirt on Wednesday
That was the extent of involvement in the TV show from the radio audience
I mean we had a lot of people watching out there
But it was a whole different group of people not that people listened during the daytime once was more than enough for them
But there was a whole different avenue of people out there who were actually watching even this asshole who knows exactly where the mole is and what color it is on Tuesday and what shade it is on Wednesday
Etc. Are in salon
Here's a mobile in sunrise. Hello. Hey me. What's going on? Yes, sir
Can you take any more criticism today? That's it
You showed you show is great. I know what the hell that guy's talking about
But he's right you could use a little bit of a fun tan. Yeah
Maybe I'm sorry. How about some makeup I could have put on during that show?
I like to hear all those other pasty looking people do
You look like Dwight Lorde down. He looks like he looks like Tara. Yeah

Heavy issue
Straight pubic here. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, yeah

I got news for I hope for your sake. You look better than I do. I'll tell you that right now
But I've seen many of you and many cases you don't
I've seen lots of you and believe you me you make me look let me say it again like Brad Pitt
And speaking of Brad Pitt, which I mentioned that yesterday the reviews I read about that grotesque
halosha movie
halosha is that another oh
kind of word yes, it is
Joe black deep in the red for struggling universal
Meet Joe black has a long way to go to stay out of the red for universal studios. It says
Trailing weekend box office lead of the water boy in the strongly opening slasher sequel. I still love what you did last summer
Meet Joe black closed 15 million puke
Pookie dollars for a third place debut pretty weak
The Brad Pitt film is far from recovering its production budget of more than 85 million dollars
And the lackluster opening did little to help the hit star of universal now next to last among the major studios in market share
Meet Joe black is a bomb
Maybe lobbamba
With or without Brad Pitt and that's what he brought here
And I do mean phony plot here
You know what it looks like Brad Pitt gotta be walking around with bleep spot here when you look that good
Why do you have to start that wouldn't be like him going on getting a nose job. I don't get it
Paula Jones we understand nice job by the way Paula
job
Monica gave a nice job and she did a nice job. Here's a mobile and four-letter deal. Hello
Hello, yes sir
Well public service announcement if you're driving 994 or 994 i95 the Davy Boulevard you're gonna be stuck in traffic
My car wreck is it still all backed up? Yes sir
Didn't know if there are been announced
But I just wanted to let everybody know it's still all backed up way way back
Okay, okay, we don't stay in hell thank you sir
They had a five car wreck. I was just wondering about that
It must have been a psychic caller there. I was wondering whether I should announce it again because sometime they clear those things up real quick not down here though
Five car wreck northbound i95 approaching Davy Boulevard the two left lanes are blocked two cars overturned
It's a mess and there's an hour ago. The ladies were building up all the way to Gryffindrow and like this guy says it's backed up
So unless you want to be sitting there and there's nothing there a few things in life more frustrating than sitting in a
middle of a wreck going nowhere
One of the only things worse than that is going to a hockey game and fighting out that there's a god
They have soccer game in the orange ball on the same knife
Anybody remember that?
And that there's 80 that they that they scheduled two events downtown on the same night at about the same time
That was real nice, okay
You are Jamaican guys out there was it was it who was it Jamaican and Brazil somebody like that?
Oh, that's right. That's what I got all hostile in neighborhood
Well, you know, I take that soccer ball and
All right, but save the good weed now. What am I having for lunch? This is a dilemma. It's already 10 past noon almost
I don't know when you're in the well. Let's have Chuck. Okay. Let's get there. What's your name?
Stacy's balls
Huh? No sauce
Okay, I don't want to be know nothing about it because the price is right and the service is great and we love Chuck and we love Nisi but no sauce
I actually had a good day on a scale yesterday. How do you like that?
Under 200 let's hear it. Oh, so like I said, let's lose 37 pounds
So I can be skinny like all the other popular people on TV like Lord Asselin Boy used to be in the J. Lino
And that would the renier we used to call him all the time J. Lino. How's really doing by the way? Anybody hear him lately? No, I'm him no more
Here's a mobile in Helen Dale. Hello
Socks is the
Ball festival for harvest. Yeah, that's it. Well, what does that mean? Well, it's like Thanksgiving
It's a harvest festival. Also, it's a good eating holiday
Sure
Okay, thank you sir. So in other words
Just don't eat the pig or you're definitely burning hell. Oh
Yeah, we're gonna be burning in hell on that lake of fire with all these crazy superstitious people need to be locked up and put away for the safety of all the rest of us
please
With all their crazy bubble mice these other stories two open lines in Broward counties for the person because I'm trying to think of anybody who doesn't show on TV
Male or female that I might have a sexual fantasy about besides Brian Rokross
Maybe Candy Corley on CNN speaking to maybe lose two three hundred pounds
See these people have got all these critiques. I hate to break the news to you
But you're looking to people around television if we're in the ones who are very successful
And they're all fat in a reengross test whether it's rosy whether it's a rosin whether it's that obnoxious Oprah
We'd like to guide them human accordion one day she's 400 the next day she weighs 40 pounds
Name me one top-looking person on a talk show on a new show on television one
Could I get back to you? Yeah, get back to me on it Anna
Can't name you one male female indifferent
Which is why people are flipping the channel so much we're desperately looking
That's why pens got a little bit of a number there because they had some naked people in every now and then some of them look pretty good
Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello
Maybe I'll go me out. Yes, sir. Welcome back. Did you get to see the
silly picture game last night? I said did you ever think of this
25 one point a lot of times during the game
25 to seven players on the ice were the ex-bases. Yeah, that's a draw. I think I saw she and the bees are both played great last night
But too bad about that crappy ice again a puck was bouncing around even lies been in the referee were making jokes about it
It was pathetic the quality of the ice is so bad and of course in Pittsburgh
There are hundred and three million in debt there on the verge of losing the franchise again
And they probably can't afford to keep that refrigeration going too cold. You know what I'm saying?
Right, but it was amazing when you think about it. I don't want to go back you to that mean well
And what's the point? What's the point you can't live in the past?
That's what they made a million mistakes here. What can I tell you?
25 percent of the players who are on the ice okay, we're gonna say that. Thank you
Okay, we got two calls left in the board. This guy just blew them all off. Thank you very much sir
He keeps saying the same thing over and over again. It's it's aimed. It's boring
Thank you history struck a play great last night. I sure as hell wish we had him on the pan through still hell of a player
And even with the crappy ice he was the one guy must have the must have had the right blades on his skates last night or something
He was smoking he was flying up and back in and out all over the goddamn place nice going Marty. There's a real player for you
But you know just sitting here and whining and crying about the same spilt milk over and over again
You argue a Sunday the fires will be here. There'll be the visa. We had that woman to call up yesterday

And you know and you know this is the sad part about it most Americans you give them a map and you say okay point out in New York state
The point out Florida even people who live in Florida. They can't find it and on the map either
Just to look at something on the map that looks like you're shlawing okay. It's drooping down there. There it is
That's Florida. Okay, it's drooping
And of course every time Florida takes a yeah shoots off another one. There's a little Caribbean islands down it. That's right
Just like say lawn or shrewy Lanka or whatever it is India took a big dump and there it came that little turret of an island down there
Of all those 10th world people
We have an open line and Dave one in India still has the number one movie industry in the world. Are you aware of that?
I ever heard that I watched Donna. Hey, they got a very big thing over there. I'm glad that I mentioned that they have a
Moon movie about two lesbians
Yeah, in India and well very
Totally unanswered what?
They got that comma sutra. They're big of the sex
It's not like that. They're not saying that they're not big in the sex, but they're quite surprised that for them
This is the first time there's been a even public recognition of female homosexuality
And they have a big guy dyke movie going on over there in India. So let's hear it for the Indians
Chamo Ramar whatever his name was the Indian boy on the elephant remember that on the Andy divine show before you were born course not

What is it that I express about the way businesses done here or any other comments?
I have about the way people drive here the way they're intolerant to each other about the politics
What is it I said I say that's wrong
I'm always hearing that well if you don't like it so much why'd you go someplace else well because I don't feel like it okay because I'm making out here okay
Even in spite of the stress level in fact, maybe I thrive on it. Maybe I'm a masochist
But I'd like to I'd like for somebody to tell me what it is that I exaggerate about is there anybody out there that believes that the way
Business is done in this town is the way it is any place else in America. No any other civilized play. No way Jose
But I'm open to suggestion okay. I'm sitting here. I will listen very
patiently to any other illiterate guys like him

They're like turned out. They're like a like a flagpole baby
I mean you have you can be whatever you want to be. It's a free world to a point
But Jesus Christ try to be a little bit discriminating will you?
People that get all-hunting bothered about very very marginal people
About people that you wouldn't touch with somebody else's hand

How come this isn't working
You knocked over my bonge
Nine inch nails I'm club only on MTV 1245 at five sixty WQ and I take back what I said before
I did finally think of a news person who I think is very very very very very good looking and of course
Most of you guys would agree because you're probably straight
Bill Hummer on CNN
Hammer Hummer I call him Bill Hummer. You don't of course you know who he is he's on in the morning doing the news on CNN every morning
Bill Hummer with the glasses when he takes the glasses off he really looks great and he puts him back on his Clark Ken
And then when he sits in that funny little cheer with a wheels on it then he's a Christopher Reeve
Oh, thank God I haven't played that thing in a long time huh very poor taste
Two open lines in that what's wrong with Bill Hummer?
There we go. I'd like to see him make it to open online look at this
I'm telling you man like I said before it's hopeless
Every line in the board was lit up you go in one of those goddamn long ponder's breaks and you come back
There is just not the dedication anymore
You know we can blame the management here and these greedy salespeople and school and and this one in that one
But the fact is that it's the audience out there
Like they got something important going on in your lives. Which do we believe that? No, of course not
But they just don't that they haven't made the commitment as Jesse Jackson would say you've been having to make the commitment
And you just do I be willing to do it God damn it
Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello
Hi

He used to be from Las Vegas North Dakota. Uh-huh. That was a real pretty. Yeah, that's right next to Binghamton, Iowa. Yeah
um
I love you. I think you're wonderful and I've got to be a freak because I think leader rascal is way
Really is very deceptive though. You have to like she's pretty scrummy well
If they ever saw her in person is she she appears like she's really fallen
If he's tall and scrum or if he's not built at all she's got very scrum
Oh my god. She used to be married to Jim Dunlap by the way used to work on a station back in the rocket world
As she was married to uh this job. I'm hard work
You know that she is not like I said she's like a like a water melon and she's the hottest thing going. Oh my god
She makes Pamela Lee look like
Minotaurist well. I love you. I enjoy the show. I'll wait forever. Okay. All right
Well
Till wait forever for Lynn Russell. Oh
You're about Lynn Russell in Jim Altman WKAT. Let's hear from some of the old KAT listeners. Are we want to hear from them? Oh, they're all dead
Two open lines and date one and powered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line
I'm still waiting. I gave you an open invitation. I gave you a blank check boys and girls that guy that one very
Articular guy who didn't know his ass from the math
He had a very good point that is on two god damn negative. He's from here
And he resents the fact that I'm so critical of so many that god damn unacceptable things down here
And I want you to tell me where I'm wrong. I want to be steered in the right goddamn erection, okay
Unlike Don I'm obsessed with that bum steer. I'm I'm serious if he don't stop talking about his wife and little baby
You know, what what is the new thing now in the 90s old farts heaven kids little kids
Have you noticed this 20 Martin? I think there's the one who started it. I'm not Tony martini randall and
And I like Tony randall Tony randall is a good liberal. He's my kind of guy is a great guy
And he's a funny guy, but he's a hundred years old. He keeps making little babies for Christ's sake
And I don't I'm a who makes Tony randall look like a teenager. He's got this little kid
And all he does is talk about his little kid and his wife and about the Fred on the farm
And who had the calf out there and which kind of was the whole steam and a Bernstein for whatever he's talking about and this guy's making millions and millions of dollars and you talk about looking bad on television
Like I said yesterday. This is a dead man in a chair
a dead man
And yes, he does have a lot of if you ever watched it on MSNBC and you see he's got he's got the news guy
Who's going all the facial here now who is he's a good news guy is okay, but he adds nothing
He adds nothing to the show. He has nothing to say
And he just he just keeps sucking around and calling him i-man all the time
But he has nothing to say then he's got the board off who every now and then opens up a post
And he's got some other guy sitting in the back there which I know I and then there's also the sports guy
They got about a half a dozen people on that show
And he still looks like a dead man in a chair and he's still all in all the media types then rather
I mean every single one of them
Because all of us said my miss instead of being funny like he used to be he came a political curmudgeon
A little too far to the right for most of us but nevertheless a political curmudgeon
And so now all of a sudden he's the darling of the of the media based on what I have no idea unless they all like a vulture
Mobile in the key. So hello
Hey Neil how are you? Great. Hey listen out there was one reporter that was so good looking
I became a channel 10 news convert but she hasn't been on a month. I can't remember her name. She was a tall

and all they and
What was his name the great gilder sleep. Let's bring back all of those shows where nobody ever went to work every day
See on the soap opera is now. It's very realistic because every soap opera they hang out most of the time in the hospital

She's busy on that other show before guiding light another whatever it is as the world of the warm turns
She used to be alphia on the doctors, but even if it's not a show called the hospital

They got tubes in their nose tubes in their rectum all over the place
Because you got to have a lot of tourists to keep the soap opera people happy
We have an open-line in power now the first suggestion here about how I'm wrong about South Florida

Right
You know
Always do that. I always give a little wave a little thing and
Knowledge it's another one of those ways of being pleasant and I open the door and they don't say thank you

I'm sorry. I mean maybe I'm just uh, I'm not so smart believe me. I was so smart. I wouldn't be here
But when I think about the average truck out there that can't even find a place on a map
God, I mean forget about a country like that guy to call the other day talking about wasn't I worried about all the stuff going on in
Iraq when I was in Amsterdam?
Have you ever looked on a map and seen how far uh Amsterdam is from Iraq?

Yeah, he's using those books in his schools in his private schools
Well, what did I have? Ain't costing him a dime probably. Why is the other words?
He's appropriating them from the public schools. That was your saying right exactly grown unbelievable

The Nicario that is Paris Paris
You see one thing. I let me just tell you this about Hispanics
And that is the Hispanic men although I listen to the women do it to some of them
I guess they're just doing it to try to act bouches well. Maybe that's a message or signal
But the the rolling of the R is very definitely a macho thing
It's part of that whole machismo mentality of Hispanic men
And the more like if you say Joe
Royo if you can really roll it if you can dig down deep
Cario, but it's only a single R
You're not supposed to roll it
You're not supposed to roll it. That's not what they say in this neighborhood. Yeah, well anything you get your hands on
That doesn't make it well. They always say that though Joe
Cario you well, no, it's not just me everybody calls him Joe Cario
That's the nicest thing they call him all right. So what's the word with two ours?
Perl like dog
Borrero

Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Well, I'm in sunrise now. There's a sunrise

19 hours of flying Jesus Christ and the economy class of the 747
Yeah, five hours from Miami to San Francisco four hour over the line 19 hours you flew in schlepper class
I went five hours from Miami to San Francisco. Yeah, I had a four hour overway
Fourteen hours to Hong Kong. Yeah in economy. Was it we're heading for to do things?
Yeah, and I'll tell you what the best view I had there in 10 days

Got it. I'll take your word for it. Okay. Welcome back. Good luck, you sir
Now, that's interesting because he was talking about I brought that up a couple of times on here and again because I'm dealing with so many
Perocule people down here who never get like out of town
Uh, it's not a figment of my imagination
Has nothing to do with people who don't bathe it has to do with skin pigmentation and people in different parts of the world have different body odor
Not all of them, but many of them people from the Middle East people from India people from the Far East people
Many of them
And of course it raises the question what do a white people smell like to them?
What do black people smell like?
To them
We have an open line and date one and breath
No, you see you were one of the people I can't give me a bunch of crap about it has to do with people not taking a bath
That's not what this subject is about it has to do with the fact that people in different parts of the world have different
Skin pigmentation and they smell different
And if you're one of them you smell fine. You don't uh, I get I would assume
White people think to the asians that well, that was my point
All right, the reason we're having such a bad problem with the Isis these guys and buildings they making a two-page for hockey arenas
Uh, they have the same problem in Boston and state problem in Chicago. Yeah, the newer readers are where they have an worst problem
But what about Pittsburgh? That's not a new arena that I sterilized that was the was some of the worst I've ever seen in my life
The puck was dribbling like a goddamn volleyball
Well, that's because nobody has a brain to set their status up any higher up in Pittsburgh
Most of them try to stay on electric up there too because they can't pay the bills
Yeah
You've got to save the
Success if your maple leaves right now because I don't think that's gonna
Hold on for very long. Well, I mean, yeah, you never know who now knows they're playing pretty damn good
Of course the only problem is they got home and home next weekend with Buffalo coming up or this weekend
And then you got Boston and Pittsburgh
Yeah, they've never had to deal with them, you know
Year after year. When you're talking about they they split those two with Pittsburgh
They spank the heck out of six to four in the first game
Yeah, but they didn't do two elegance blossom now
One game what a one game doesn't make a lifetime. Yeah, but you know it's gonna happen
Yeah, I do know you're halfway through the year. They're the accordion act. I know lucky for them
They have a very very good goalie and we don't and uh by the way
I want to break the news to you but Curtis Joseph
Hasn't been worth no six million dollars. He hasn't played that great in fact Felix potpan a few games that he's played
He's got a very well one lost record and Curtis Joseph is gone
I'll take pot down over Joseph's panning time. Well, I don't want to be a douchebag. Go ahead. Hey Jimmy go me and you're a douchebag. All right

The other thing I got to you is a very very short little poem that I'll help you with your
Hours in Spanish. See and I was taught this I used to teach school up in junean city which had a very high
Cuban immigration and I took it night school for the adults

You know, a waiter and a whole bunch of other people came to my table and only one of them
Don't like like what's his name says?
Rimmam

And oh, that's true because Rimmar said that he was in Paris one time and I asked him how were the French people he said?
They stuck yeah, yeah, and
We all went about the Frenchman up there like you partnered in East-Pafé and he said they stuck yeah
We really asked we asked one of the people who didn't think and we asked them
Who you smell some of these people that really now?
That's a good point now. We now we finally found somebody who understands what I'm talking about and then they said
No, we don't we don't we don't notice
Only one out of the three or four people I came to my table not even at the table
The walking by the table were so pulses so I felt like throwing up
I become a fast-fice I hug my nose and and I was in the back
I'm not surprising when it happens at the restaurant and I knew there's one in the end dude who who's very Americanized and
He used a shower with cologne. So I think if they only put the order and cologne
It won't be so offensive. Okay. All right. We'll spread the word

This is my sub from Chuss
Yeah, I mean far be it for me to a critique, but I mean you've been eating non-stop since about 920 this morning
Not that it's only 120 or thereabouts. It's only four hours later
It's all from frustration. It's from working for this company boys and girls
You'll eat your cookies out
We just tear your guts out as they continue to find all odds and all common sense by saying
No matter what the topic is
That's right. That's the a bread-read way
So I wanted with that real story is about those salespeople of making all different kinds of commissions
And people threatening to walk out. Yeah, I will say this. I worked with a lot of screwed-up salespeople in my life as you know
But this sales department is the most volatile. I have ever seen they're hired. They're fired
They're in their route and nobody is gone for like more than five minutes quite frankly
Is there anybody that's gone from well when we started from 11 months ago?
I can't name anybody
They're all still here, but they're here like
temporarily
They're here and then they get fired there. They quit and then they come back and it's just this ongoing
Hostile who is it?
Karina
Karina Karina by Ray Peterson. I remember that
He didn't smell too good to open lines. Indeed five real good was Pat Peterson
How does that pat Peterson do when I'm not finding anybody seeing him lately? No
Haven't heard from her in a long time boy you talk about being abandoned
What is it about three four months since we heard from the not-slanding lady and I've even gone out of my way and beg
I beg for what he grraver we got what he grraver
I beg for easy, which is a bad mistake. We finally got Izzy on the goddamn phone. Incoherent as he was
Well, even Sandy remember that we got Sandy that one time which it'll probably never happen again
But our good post personal friend the not-slanding lady that I made famous into a superstar helped her lose all that weight
Changed her life saves her life and we heard from her in a coon's age. Oh, no
Boy, not that I'm bitter. I want you to understand that not bitter about it
I'd you go home and cry a lot
You want the fennel?
This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station
Coming soon

Now there is a great young man who is from this community comes back into all this good charitable work
Great guy tremendous athlete a superstar
Seems like a great kid and is anybody talk about him here? No
We hear lots about Jose Can Succo who's a role model like I'm a rocket scientist
Okay, and then of course, you know if the strictly a Cuban thing if Alice Rodriguez were Cuban
His picture would be on the front page of the hero on the front session not this sports section on the front session
Right next to the mass head every day
But he's not doesn't he like from Malorid public opinion to Connor somewhere like that
Well, he's got some god damn nerve him and Sammy Sosa

Did it make you warm in here is it me maybe it was that lunch? Huh?
Did you get more and I noticed by the way? That's another great thing about not having the tv crew
I don't want them to feel bad because they'll take it personally. We still love them and miss them etc
You believe it but uh, it isn't nice how the temperature pretty much stays the same all the time now
Have you noticed that?
Uh-huh
Here's the pepper primes hello hello meal. Yes. Uh, yeah
I wouldn't ask you a question. We were both an argument about hockey and I figured uh, I'd ask you since you're pretty knowledgeable about the subject
No, I'm not knowledgeable on an expert. Oh, well. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I do
Um, my brother still thinks
That uh now that Dallas's picked up Brett holes are gonna win the west over Detroit and my opinion is Detroit
So I wasn't lost anybody
Detroit's not playing that good right now of course, they you know, sometimes they start out slow
But they're not playing too good now, but am I arguing that to him was that uh, that Detroit still has all the top name players
They still got you know, I mean everybody they've all on two for the past two seasons that they won the championship
Now the problem that Dallas has got is they're never gonna win the uh champion
They never really win the Stanley Cup with Eddie a balfour and then that's never happened
That's true investor. Maybe they can trade for a partner or something. Yeah
No, no way because balfurs make an affortune
They got a gigantic payroll and I can't show them a question of how is the how they gonna deal the way
Pots and if they don't want to get another goalie from they want to get somebody else
How they gonna deal that a lot of they have to have a backup goalie and in the deal
But they I have no idea. I mean when the Montreal traded T-votor Chicago for a hack it two days ago
Oh, that shocked me because the word to continue to be that
Pop that was going to Montreal didn't happen
So I have no but in the meantime he keeps playing you know every like that
