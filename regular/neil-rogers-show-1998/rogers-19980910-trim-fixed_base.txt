The QAF, you can hit my rear end.
She wasn't in town for the president,
barely on, she wasn't sure what it meant,
but he was so...
This is the sense to show her.
He took her on a tour of the old old place,
and when they were through the other by a face that he said,
no, uh...
Oh, the man doesn't know,
the man doesn't know,
uh...
Okay.
She's with God as f***ing anywhere through the road.
She fell to her knees and she swallowed him down.
She's in slow, uh...
What's going on?
Oh, must've saved conversations on the phones,
I can't help but feel it's bones,
when it came, you had it in his head.
What's going on?
She said, feel it,
I'm not the wild folks curious man,
but from what I hear,
I understand she wasn't going well,
good, good, good, go well,
Every time, just be not out of work.
Ok, this is how it goes!
unloading in the big limo yesterday thirty six boxes i just never seen anything
that vivid and that massive big box and baby
and i was all hyperventilating all politicians are running for cover in the
reports going up to the congress and about a bit about a bit about and it's
all the same crap there's nothing about white water there's nothing about
file gate there's nothing about travel gate they couldn't nail them on anything
except uh... cover up uh... an affair with some bitch
that's the whole damn thing and we got thirty six boxes of evidence and now
everybody's in a panic and a market is down two hundred and fifty six points
already and it's only been open like a half an hour
and then i just asked on fifty two and drop in like a rock
i told you guys on monday don't get sucked into this by and crap okay wait
for them to bottom out wait for the market to get out about like the doubt
to get down to five hundred
and then we'll get in there and uh... have some buying
buying opportunities
and we did a what's your beef i'm going to tell you right now
put that damn morning showed a shame that's right
we got assholes out there calling here calling this number over here i have no
idea why i must have to we took more calls there from a quarter to ten
until ten o'clock then we've all day yesterday
and they work great it back we gave away some fried chicken watermelton to one
brother right there and he's happy in a big and small
and that he's charging on his master card which they turned down for sorry bro
but it anyway uh... man we got so much crap going on here today we just we
got the barlands game coming up i guess
the mornin flows again last night and they blow another lead last night and eight
to five lead they lost nine eight oh my god doesn't make any difference
or by the way
yesterday course we had a bum steer as usual from paul harvey junior a good
friend but i he was more accurate than some others
you know i'm saying
he was a little premature it in
court for a little premature he's always had that problem but nevertheless i
mean all these two press conferences with that dot that time smiley thing was
an award winner thanks to us
but that press conference in the day dumbbrowski one where he signed for five more
years is all about you to say the deal is done john hennie's vina team
et cetera so on i'll say thank god for that we're excited as hell about that
we are forming it the mouth about that we're so damn excited
by the way great job great job by new times brine norcras hype that hurricane
you got to get new times you got to go out and actually see this
and they've made up a whole bunch of letters to brine it says thanks to vanyand
daniel brine norcras south Florida's favorite weatherman in a catastrophe
once again managed to muscle his way to center stage and once there he greedily hogged
airtime like an infosima patient in an oxygen tent
as his hurricane coverage showed norcras still hasn't lost his special talent
for breathless panic mongering hyperbole inexplicably though his viewer seemed to
lap it up that is what viewers he has at the lowest rated news program in this
second tier market as a random survey of his recent male revealed norcras
maybe more popular than ever and then he got a bunch of whole uh
fabricated letters here to brine which are beautiful
which i only read you one to give you the uh the uh jizz of the matter
dear brine i'm confused i know from watching your special reports that the
safest room in the house during a hurricane is the bathroom and that for added
protection i should get down in my bathtub anybody ever get down in the bathtub
uh i'll bet since tubs are so sturdy you've suggested that i dragged my
mattress into the bathroom and used it to cover up the top of the tub once i get
inside but i've also heard you say that i can use my tub to stir water because water
is like gold after a hurricane brine when the storm hits am i supposed to get
into my tub while it's full of water and if i cover the top of it with the
mattress hold i ground
alright there you go mr hysteria nice go out for new times even though
they stole all the ideas from me as usual and there i'm i'm just not suitable
intellectual enough for them they don't like me at new times the other one looks
what used to be uh excess which is now what is it city a link city links
to see again once again i was told to my talk we're down 260 points anybody worried
about it no no way get it weighed down there man get away that's so we can afford to all buy stuff
we have got so much crap going on the most important thing that i'm going to talk about today
and listen don't worry about that stupid phone let me uh just take one new
get any what's your beef pulse wq amp what's your beef

you know i'm freezing that's why a little twerk guilty you're twerk maybe you'll pick him up in his
left hand and squash him like a net i'm telling you it's in fact guilty is hard like a net
can i go through my back he's hung like a gilding yes Danny the minute that you're through
okay thanks sir excellent call i i'm sitting there on my uh thrown this morning scouring through
our two yokeal newspapers as i usually do which doesn't take very long just long enough to take a good
and that's it and i came across an article in the four hundredth part of a ten million part series
that the hero does their usual ethnic division thing here and other than got this cuban editor of
the paper i mean it's all we got now is cuban of this in fiddle latin by the beep by the book
sable as paniel a key so can we talk race and ethnicity in south florida this is the fourth
and a ten million part series in which south florida is from a variety of backgrounds will discuss
the impact of race and ethnicity on their lives and you are not going to believe in your wildest
dreams who is featured in this thing today anybody remember that great those great old days with
any shaper and mark vinson and the americ citizens for day united uh yeah there you go the anti
bilingual days where we were being inundated with mary all illegal aliens here uh and we had nothing
to the no other control over it so we tried to do a little something i say we because i was involved
then and i make no apologies for that because i know what it was intended to be but unfortunately a
lot of zealots jumped on the bandwagon including one emis the penis shira there's this picture there
he's had it he says emis shira helped bring about the 1980 referendum that declared english
my any date counties official language and this is one of the most incredible i might even read a whole
god day martykel i'm so worked up pissed off and fired up about this i mean are you ever going to
give it a rest no the same just people who are obsessed working their entire life fighting up screen
against uh the inevitable okay no god the last paragraph in his article this is the best this is
the greatest and he goes on about how he was called names and beaten and this and that
called a zina phobic hysteral asshole of what we all know he's an asshole we know that
he's an emis shira and don't ever call us again he used to be so chronic on his show i mean just
chronic and we could be talking about uh mark maguire you know break into your home my record and
emis shira would cause a yeah but you know something i bet you that if he was cute but they would
have really made a big deal about get out of here already just obsessed in the last and he says
that he tunes into spanish radio and listens even though he only only knows about 200 words
as in mirrored which he knows well he gets the general jiz of the what they say they call us
norteamericanos as opposed to regular americans he says and that pisses him off he's pissed off and
fired up but the last paragraph this is the best he says when i published my book which is a master
plan for the retaking of america in david county that's going to be in there it's going to be in
that maris for a one said that with it in 1982 maris for a said within 10 years there'll not be
a word of english spoken in his town well i think he was right uh well we're just barely under
the county law we're just right at the county line they're close enough to brow to escape that's
right when you publish your book it's going to be called i am in his the penis you call that a penis
exactly good point i mean just just one dimensional obsessed no life huckin a china the same old
hard crap i say we change the language to yiddish in the datin bro that's what i say didn't it used

okay it's between us and you okay say hi to your uh thing see that was fine
he's okay he's even been this dog pro's out he not a bad idea got some spirit for a little
lamenting all right can i get back to this marketing god thing and stop with all this other fault
are all we got a damn radio show to do here the man upstairs it says if you think gridlock on
south Florida roads is reaching biblical proportions you should see the billboards god damn it
keep using my name in vain i'll make rush hour longer sign god it says on sample road and
pop it obi what part of thou shalt in a show a thou shalt not didn't you understand
sign god on interstate 95 and four lotterdale on i 95 that's right the almighty is talking to you
in thousands of other commuters on billboards and buses all over broward county is part of a six
figure slightly a revered ad campaign to get people to turn to religion to turn to the idea isn't
to preach to people but the position god is a regular guy oh there we go in that sexist craft
again god is a guy who created woman only is an afterthought so that man would have some somebody
keeping a busy with no i mean out of the rib he created man even though George says man's
nipples aren't very erotic but nevertheless and there's nothing about a man that's sexual it said
maybe his penis but other than that then he created woman out of a rib just so that man would
have some some to keep him occupied and some way to reproduce which why do you think of that in
the beginning by the way shouldn't you have known that did he create like the male a chow first
and then the female chow later on he created a male and a female all at once that god man is he
is all screwed up he's just a regular guy see he is he's a regular guy he's not perfect he's got
all kinds of problems he tries does he tries that and nothing ever goes right god damn it at any
rate the playfully pious plugs went up on nine billboards the outside of a hundred buses and the
inside of two hundred more on September 1st will remain for three months the price tag Smith
wouldn't say but the brown County transit said the bus ads cost about thirty six thousand dollars
people are starving to that this is a sin somebody's gonna burn out a lake of fire for wasting this
money we got homeless people we got people starving to this we got a man who can't even afford any more
goddamn prosa because he's feeding it all the way stamp dog and they're wasting 36 grand on that
the billboard company outdoor systems estimates a sign on i95 cost between eight and 15 grand a
month that's just for one month that's just for one sign for one month so we're talking maybe
about the grand he released for starters which is absolutely unfrieking believable people are
starving to that and you're putting up billboards and bus signs that people should be huckin a
china about and not only that but they're threatening people that's right if you take my name and
name and hate it's that wrathful god again who keeps getting pissed off he must listen to that morning
show god definitely listen to the morning show because he says exactly that's what god says
and he says if you're saving to take my name in vain or if you like scratch your nose or if you
didle around with the mikes if you blow his nose huh wouldn't that be disgusting they wouldn't
put that on channel guarantee that they wouldn't put that on whammy well in mikes god has no
sense of a strange place looks like a nose anybody ever have glasses on there well maybe if they're
kakao oh jeez i can't believe you said that there you go so we got the god billboards we got god
bus signs we got got all over the god damn place and if you're wondering why traffic is so bad out
there stop cursing god damn it stop all the cursing will you please and then maybe traffic are
like light enough and open up it just like when uh who was it Moses Abraham Solomon Joseph uh
Jehovah's event who was it Moses opened up the red sea there with one flick of a finger he went like
this and the whole damn thing parted given the high sign oh by the way spiggen and given the high
sign i'm coming to work this morning and out there on a county line not a con honey hill road
which is i've dairy and which is also 190 now because in my me date county we not only have to have
two names for the county but every street's got to have at least three or four names to keep you confused
to keep enus the penis in david county so we can't get out he's just locked in he can't get out he's
fighting the good fight he's uh in fact maybe and maybe he'll run off with ron what a match made in
heaven that would be enus the penis but i'm coming to work this morning and there's a school zone
up there which they go flying through there i want to salute the mimey day the uh metro cops
okay not just because we got that nice letter yesterday and we saved the business card in case
we ever get a ticket we need it but because this morning they're out there they were under that
overpass over the underpass they were like milling around there they had an operation going on
that was great see i'm not one of these people that's big on all these speed traps
unless it's in an area where people's behavior is dangerous and aberrant and that particular area
it'd be bad it'd be bad you come barreland through there and there's a school zone that comes up
on you immediately and they're like all these little kids you know try not to get killed crossing
the road and people just come barreland assing through there on their way to get their water melon
and fried chicken whatever they're on a way to do and they just come zoom in through there
and being the end you know so this morning they're all jammed in there i'm slowing down and they
are cops looking me i give them the thumbs up and he gives me oh what one of these is what i can
thumb up not this one this one dammit oh don't say that so nice going guys you see unlike plantation
where they put a speed trap on hiatus road where there are no there no sidewalks there's no pedestrian
traffic there are no houses there's no nothing it's just a speed trap where they very low with
the ridiculous speed limit out of 35 miles an hour like shooting fish in a barrel so i'm like in
plantation where they set up these stupid idiotic speed traps in places where there was no need for
them at least over here they're doing it in a spot where people deserve to get nailed including
those assholes to go zooming through i can't i just can't believe those people i mean let me ask you
this when you see that everybody has slowed down to 15 miles an hour and you're going 60 and weaving
in and out trying to work your way through doesn't it ever dawn on you that maybe there's a reason
that these people are going so slow no no no no you're in a hurry is that it oh i'm sorry
they're in a hurry they got to get somewhere real fast before kfc you know cuts off that special
on those chicken cheddar tenders whatever that thing is those look really good if they didn't have
that breading on the outside anyway it's 10 25 yeah i love that chicken with cheddar cheese melted
on the inside 10 25 at 40 QAM

okay 10 29 at 5 60 bought 10 you a sense celly left on those paramedics have been bored to death
bored stiff so i got to tell you a little bit about this upcoming hockey season even if you
don't this isn't even hockey talk necessarily because this last season was a really ugly and nasty
and divisive experience for me and i've already made up my mind especially after receiving three
psychotic phone calls at home yesterday but i'm not going to go through that same crap again this year
and especially after you're in joe rose this morning the little dog doing a whole rb's
live spot and dedicating to my cheap ass friend jeff rimmer he did a whole spot this morning
talking about what a cheap prick rimmer is how do you like that and i'm the one that gets all
a grief and all the phone calls at home but anyway before i get into that all your season ticket
orders out there in the beautiful new macarena and broward this saturday is come see your seat day this
saturday september 12th from noon to four and i've decided since i got my tickets in my parking
why not go even though i've already seen it i already put my big fat rectum in my seat
and said man this is great i think i'm going to go over there and see it again why not i think we
deserve to go over there and just say i take a little leak out look around i already marked the
but that's going to be great urena's beautiful and there's something that asshole at old fart
that called me yesterday that grisly little miserable nasty prick that called me yesterday with
that song and a dance about wow you know you're a hypocrite in your subzer I'm not subsidizing
anybody okay and if i could smuggle in my own sodas i wouldn't spend a couple of bucks for one
of Wayne sodas oh but but i'm doing the best i can but this company is buying my tickets and i'm a
hockey fan and a mullsons man and whatever the hell goes with that and if you don't like it stick
it up your ass okay go to say loquid sali go to shakago with sali get out of my face get out of my
puts you so i think i'll check that out and then next saturday week from this saturday the 19th
is going to be uh sneak peak hockey fest from ten a m to eight p m all day it's of open to
anybody who wants to attend its free to all and they will feature endless entertainment opportunities
towards the entire building player autographs you can shower with ray wittany and lots more will be
going on a week from this saturday so who knows if i might even check that out but i doubt it
because i won't be here but at any rate uh getting back to this thing you know we had all that
device in this and we had the uh we had those real pussy there on a morning show and even Joe
Rose turned into a real about pansy there at the end of the thing and stuck up but after that phony
controversy with Brian Marie and the coach is showing off well thank god terry marisa smart guy
and it is not going to be doing any coach show at the radio nice move terry so we don't have to
worry about that but because i dared to tell the truth about what a did what a horrible job at all
mistake they made that made me into the enemy i was the bad guy and yes i did hear the last two
minutes of randy motor on there this morning randy you're a good guy but you better go back to
red here and finish your education okay get a sense of humor i mean yesterday what did i say about
rimmer yesterday i'm sure that i haven't said before he's canadian he's jewish and he's cheap okay
he's cheap he's a good guy's a good friend of mine but why do i have to get these hysterical calls
at home especially when everybody else is ripping him and talking about how cheap and i'm talking
about people that don't even like them all that much like joe rose and default oh yeah in fact
rimmer was talking yesterday he was over in the new arena and defo was over there doing a
suck it around doing something and he ran over and said hi defo how you doing and defo was stuck
for an answer how do you like that he said hey defo how are you and defo was stuck for an answer
but at any rate i'm not going to get in the middle all that crap again if there are people
associated this hockey organization is the most thin skinned uptight everybody associated with it
is like on pins and needles every moment okay we know the team's going to be very weak this year we
know that don't we uh and now they're talking about oh brine's got to make a decision because this
pot band thing fell through thanks to mike smith and toronto's an asshole and neater mire's got a big
mouth and too much of a pussy to want to go and play in toronto where they got real fans who know
the game and know a real floater when they see one so that deal fell through so now by Saturday we
got to have our goal tending situation all nailed down even all Kevin weeks wants more money
that he's ever going to be worth and we don't have him signed please don't get Sean Burke i'm begging
you guys i don't want to start off on a sour device and though we don't want Sean Burke okay
just ask his wife she'll tell you some stories we're in it why we're gonna hear one
goalie that had uh little problems there with his wife he's over in tampon out we already had that
but we don't want Sean Burke he's like a human sieve we've already got uh jerk the uh captain jerk
to come acclaim we don't need two human sieves but it's gonna be fun over there it's a beautiful arena
i'm gonna i'm gonna have a whole different outlook on it this year i'm just gonna go there and have
a good time and i'm gonna give my opinions honestly and frankly and tell you exactly what i see
and if there's anybody out there doesn't like it too effing bad that's my comment to you okay
if you're too much of a bunch of pussy and pansy to take honest criticism from somebody knows
what he's talking about that's too bad that's too god damn bad and if there's anybody that i know
without mentioning any names who also is gonna be so thin skinned about oh hey have a great life
i'll take feral to dinner okay i don't get any lift from her
she's got a sense of humor okay rimmer she's got a great sense of humor and by the way
your rose didn't do a whole arby spot about feral being cheap this morning because she's not
and for a guy that's of gotten a new uh jacuzzi and a new car and spending all kinds of money
like it's coming out of a sieve we understand your cheapness all it comes when it has to do with
buy-in for others picking up that check that's when that c8 kicks in that convenient all-timers he
forgets how to reach for that check we understand that that's no problem oh don't talk about me
anymore no it's okay for loon dog to go on and just going to a whole live smile i'm telling you man if
i was the people at arby's i'd be saying who the hell is this rimmer guy or peddler and food over
here we're not doing a hockey thing that's what i would be saying so if i were joe rose i watched
my peas and cues okay because the rim man's gonna get pissed off and you'll be getting calls friday
calls at home saying please don't talk about how cheap i am on here anymore your cheap okay rimmer
you're a great guy your cheap and you're a neurotic and you're a basket case maybe it comes from
working with a dumb frog to me's potpan or for the fact that depot didn't want to speak with it
and when you said hello he was stuck for an answer i don't know what the deal is
i have no i'm not a shrink i'm not paid to be somebody's persons like kaiatris
all those great meals that i buy for my close personal friend there's uh i don't do it just
because that's a show off i do it because i enjoy their company and because i know they're cheap
that's all and i can afford it i make a couple of bucks here in here i got a nice check this
morning although the two hundred dollars for joe kha stella wasn't in there i just thought i would
mention that one more time see anything that's like outside the ordinary that's not in the system
that's the excuse they make oh well let's uh you know we got to send that over to
the west coast and they got to uh pass it by boofas and he's got a boofas which one of the
beesleases is that i guess anyone that you pick anyone that's around at the moment is boofas
and boofas that's the measly boys baby oh well they don't have a sense of humor too effing bad okay
i'm making him a lot of god damn money and they'll take all the grief i can dish out and then some
because they deserve it see one thing about me i don't exaggerate in a burri least
i've put you ten million times if it's one thing about me i don't exaggerate
forty million times i've told you and i'm going to tell you one of the things since i'm so pissed off
and fired up here this morning and worked up to a frenzy and i'm only getting going believe me
i'm loaded with lots and lots of good stuff today today is today i come out with all the good
crap that's right it's absolutely unconscionable the kind of garbage that comes in from the colors
i've said this before i'll say it again these knowledgeable sports colors on this station
yesterday i'm listening to Hank go and home and by the way nice job Hank Hank goes what's going on
kill the first half hour with me they're butchering that uh don smiley press conference which we did
a great job thank you it was hysterical and then i heard sunny hursh was on there over chulas with
Hank for a while and then he had Ralph Hawke on a phone to an interview with Ralph Hawke about that
61 season was great forget about the god damn colors we ignore how many colors have we gotten
this market like one or two oh that's it i mean real colors i'm talking about not these other
phony baloney sucking up for something for free and here's some punk calling in there who's like about
20 years old maybe at best who's still waiting for his other testicle to descend probably related to
guilty and he's given a seminar because Hank was asking does Roger merris belong in the hall of fame
and by the way i agree with you Hank we do often disagree on things but on this one case
Hank is right he don't belong in the hall of fame he had one gigantic year if you know that the
hall of fame is determined membership it is determined by having one great record then he belongs
in a hall of fame but that's not what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be about uh career
accomplishment is what it is Roger merris was not a great baseball player he was a good player
he had some good years and one great season but you can have an opinion on that whatever it might be
but when you're a little uh eighteen or twenty year old punk who wasn't even born would Roger merris
was playing what the hell do you know what you're talking about and some punk calls in
all the Roger merris did this and he didn't even know what he's talking about he wouldn't know
Roger merris if he came back from the dead right now and walked into his house and and bitch laughed
him right across the pussy wouldn't know Roger merris and that's what we got like yoldie getting
on there waxing all enthusiastic and emotional about Bobby Thompson's home run in the playoffs in 1951
that won the pennant for the giants i got news for a yoldie wouldn't know rust Hodges from
gill Hodges from russo wases okay that's what yoldie knows about bobby Thompson
so all these people with a big mouth it's easy to have an opinion like assholes everybody's got one
okay like noses everybody's got a nose some bigger than others but for crying out a lot at
least have some idea what you're talking about and don't try to be an expert on stuff that happened
years before you even born i'll do little pips squeaks out there oh Roger merris he uh yeah right
good player not a great player does not belong in a hall of fame
let's take criminals again this year join gene decker hop for the play by play right here
Saturday the mayhem yeah buddy hey hey hey do you have bodyguards and well you just don't
feel comfortable having them around anymore because you're involved in a lot of illegal activity
and some day their testimony could be used against you in a court of law of course we all have
that fear that's why the makers of the real doll have created the one and only real guard
they it looks and feels like a real bodyguard and even packs he day back or i shoot the important
difference is though that this bodyguard can't be subpoenaed into a court of law i saw nothing
i am only here to protect hey you can sell drugs by illegal arms wander money or even do the nasty
in the oval office these guys won't ever say a thing once comer the real guard look for
demonstration models on sixteen hundred battlevania avenue coming soon i'll bet okay at seventeen
before eleven at five sixty q and we got the uh Tommy's going to be doing the uh talking baseball
today how do you like that Tommy's going to be doing talking about me talking baseball and then we
got the marlins and arachuses they try for a clean sweep to blow another lead and lose another game
they're we're getting real close to a hundred now they're getting close we got john henry's
going to salvage the whole deal he's going to buy the team dave dumbbrowski's sticking around for
another five years and maybe there's hope at the end of the tunnel for you baseball fans all ten of
and speaking of the president in these thirty six boxes which i'm sure not going to get bogged
down out day after day you want to know why everybody's full minutes amount now because even there's
no white water there's no travel gate there's no file gate and all those thirty six boxes from the
best information we got so far and they're leaking like crazy like a suit it's all about monica
Lewinsky and blow jobs and cover ups and on line uh et cetera and so on and apolitographic details
in there now let me ask you this question if Ken star wasn't politically motivated if he wasn't
a puppet of the right wing and Richard melonscape and all these other right wing fanatics and gary
bowler and all these other Nazis then why in the world wouldn't make any well how what relevance is
there what positions they were doing and what she did with that cigar et cetera and so on except
to appeal to the pure purulent interest and paranoia of the american public which if we
appeal to the purine interest of the public here on a radio on television right away the FCC comes
in there start getting psychotic but if the special investigators appealing to the purine interest
of the public i mean there is every wild story that this and let me say it again what kind of a
woman goes into a congressional which is going to become a congressional inquiry now to the special
investigator testified washing in dc and goes into graphic detail about how she was masturbating
with a president cigar and doing this and sticking as to what is what kind of a bitch is that
that goes in there and has to go into a every graphic detail under the sun which is why the
politicians are squirming like crazy exactly you said it you said it best that is the american fn
way that everybody's got to be all psychotic in the nervous because now it's not just it's not
something isolated or something you know just intangible it's now something so graphic and
real that you can almost smell it oh god you can almost smell it because we got to go through all
the graphic details because the whole deal here is to humiliate and degrade and have we heard one more
word about Dan Burton of indiana no about that illegitimate kid that he father we heard one more
word about it is there anybody is wolf gang blitzer talking about that no no no we don't hear nothing
about that and newt gingrich you notice how he is real he was at that meeting yesterday and he's
real quiet he is mum because he's another one that likes oral sex because then he can slay
that he didn't sleep with the bitch so he and the president they are like buds there is titus
a snare drum those two because their favorite topic is talking about see that's it just like Vernon
Jordan and what heterosexual guys don't hang around talking about see all the time just like when
I came into work here every single morning George and a fact you're in the other room and what are
they talking about see every single day and I'm sitting here all god is this boring man every day it's
see see every single day you have it if we were talking about the other one no I wouldn't I wouldn't
be least bit interested talk is cheap okay mister uh-huh that's what I told Rob he ran a hell out of
here and he didn't write kind of float it out is what he did oh what are we going to do about poor
Rob he went out and got fitted for lead weights you know that he instilled in the health hey Stephanie
we understand what's going on 13 before 11 at 560 wqm let me get back into this enus de penis
sheriff thing this can we talk the erase in ethnicity which never goes away with some of these people
talk about beating a god damn dead horse even mark obin at pompato park never be the dead horse
this much I'll tell you that god retiree enus sheriff is a shortwave hobbyist who communicates
with people all over the world a non-Hispanic white of Italian German Irish descent
he's also co-founder and vice president of citizens of date united he goes on to say I mean
this is well worth listening to okay because these are the ramblings of man who is obsessed
obsessed and there's still a segment of assholes out there that this is the number one topic they
will never ever let this go you're it's not going to change not going to change if you don't like
it in date county do what most of the rest of us with a brain did we move to brown we move to
bulk we moved to somewhere we liked it better that's all it's not going to change
he goes on to talk about how he moved to Miami from Pennsylvania in 1936 when he was just a kid his
father was a plumber of this and that he says I had never been in politics I used to hate it
my wife was worried in one part of me wanted to stay away only reason I got in
things got so insane so out of whack and so asked backwards he says to the point that I'd had it he's
had it somebody had to take the reins was I a damn American or a mouse he asked if you ever
met this guy you'd have no problem answering that question by the way even Mickey Mouse is
a blushing from here and at the comparison it's not that I don't like Cubans he says not that I
don't like Cuban it's the principal what some of them are trying to pull the trigger for me was
that had enough we know what they like to pull the trigger for me was I had enough of people
tried to instigate the Cuban country right inside how do you like that instigate the Cuban
country right inside of date county on my American soil what exactly is that English get you
addiction area okay I thought you're the guy who's an expert on English enistapenas instigate
there well what is that God I went all the way with the Marine Corps during World War II to fight
the Japanese not came home and had my own country my own city taken away from me as though I was
the foreigner I like foreigner by the way the official English ordinance went on the books November
4th 1980 it passed with 251,000 votes 60% of date county voted for it how the hell can 60% of date
county be bigots xenophobes and racists I thought 60% of date county was banana boat people isn't it
uh-huh we ran a herald ad on February 20th 1981 George Washington's birthday it said citizens
of date united will hold a protest against illegal aliens crime and bilingual operation of
government who could be against that unless you're a lunatic he acts but in a three day period we
received 163 threats one told the president of our organization I will mow you in half with my
machine gun unbelievable son of a bitch anti-cuban xenophobic hysterical several times this is what
they were called I don't think he's several times we marched on immigration and naturalization
service building and received threats there I was attacked once there were protesters trying to
block the deportation of Orlando Bosch the anti-castor activist convicted knife and so on there were
about 12 hunger strikers down on a flagrestriot in support of Bosch staying there I went down to make
a video tape and they attacked me three men beat me up on a sidewalk they jumped me one guy got me
by the neck is they tried to rip the camera away that was July 4th 1989 independence day
oh now this already read but it's worth repeating again listen very carefully okay open up your ears
I'll scolti repeate it says I tune in Spanish radio and listen even though I know only about
200 words I get the general gist of what they say they call us North Americanos as opposed to
regular Americans I know a lot of regular Americans they use dukelax it says I keep a clipping from
the Los Angeles Times in my wallet this is what it says on one side of the debate are some Latino
politicians like former Miami Mayor Maurice Faray who told the Tampa Tribune in 1982 that within
10 years there wouldn't be a word of English spoken English is not Miami's official language one day
residents will learn Spanish or leave end of quote from the anxious Maurice Faray when I publish
my books as enus the penis which is a master plan for the retaking of American date county that's
going to be in there there you go says enus the penis wants to take back date county anybody want it
no you can have it I don't want it is that is this incredible I mean you talk about a man who's
living you just in lockstep with himself this man refuses to graduate from this mentality fossils
who were meant for each other and there was certainly a time back during those ugly nasty crime
written days of the burial bullet when we had bodies stewed all over Dixie highway and everywhere else
there was a time when you know people had a right to be upset but you know something here it's now
almost 20 years later and this man is still singing the same old stale tune and the herald feels
you know the need to put this crap in there like we don't know about Mark Benson and he is Shira
enemy shaper and all these other zealots who just keep honking away screaming oh not that I don't like
Cubans no we know you love everybody there's no question about that he is you're just a great enlightened
guy who could you could use a little education in linguistics huh he needs a little help with that
kind of linguistics they're trying to instigate the Cuban country right inside huh they're
instigating learn English yeah learn to speak English okay that do not be correct mister take 10
steps back and do not pass go you lose right so there you go we have an open line and date one
and brow at five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t line I have a long long
negative facts here which I'm not gonna you know I learned my lesson yesterday in fact I noticed
that the nationwide ratings for the Mark McGuire 60 second home run the Cardinals and Cubs getting
the other night two nights ago nationwide rating was about double what it was here in town yeah
what are you shaking your head about I'm just trying to tell you that locally here the interest is
minimal as compared to the rest of the civilized country because sports are not into it's not
something people here care about other than hockey of course so here's a long and this guy from
Caroline and Mountain water another one of these chronic factions like that Pierce Leahy guy just
like we have chronic callers we also as you know have chronic factors the guy that writes with
little squiggly writing and Andy from Hollywood who's in both categories by the way and in this guy
who writes me a long song to dance about how he doesn't give a crap and he's 40 years old and he was
in every day baseball fan of a beat but a boop but right now on and on paragraph after paragraph a
long lengthy type written letter about baby Ruth and Roger Maris and others who were the real heroes
of this game and he don't give a crap about this big ox mark McGuire what does he call him we're
gonna hell is it this uh it's here somewhere come on we're gonna hell is it this will kill some good
time while I look for well I guess so much goddamn stuff in here oh there you go the traffic's
all screwed up again you said it again I'll get to that eventually let's get rid of this Miami
call first because you got 10 question marks hello I got some beat yeah the buff in yeah huh okay
like I said little Julio's you know something I think Ena Shira's got a point I'm so tear second
tear a little so Julio's who have nothing to say they all sound the same they smell the same they
look the same they got the same cheese that same Pecorino cheese two open lines in date county let's
talk to some anglos in date county today like Ena's the penis Shira who want to take date county back
that's right let's let's start hawking at because this little spict there he just frost my ass a little
bit he's starting to push me back onto the other side there with my good friend Ena's with my close
personal friend Ena's slaughter the penis Shira two open lines in date five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty out of 18 t line here's Coral Gables hello Neil yes sir I want to call in about the
uh mark McGuire love fest you're having yesterday yeah uh my I think that's great baseball player
decent guy yeah yeah it was spectacular but but before he goes ahead nominating him for
a faint hood you know and gushing about what a great class act he was and all that yeah he was
keeping lines but right after he did that yeah he went ahead with that that craft commercial
endorsement for Disney right there on the thing so what about us so what does that mean is this guy
not entitled all these other guys do the same thing why should he be different from anybody else
well everybody's it's such a pure wonderful moment no I we didn't say that at all nothing
is pure about sports anymore about america it's uh it's all about business well you may not have
but other colors and people like today in the paper I don't think that most of the colors we had
were hostile and uh negative and uh I hated it yeah right I don't understand why people are
criticizing somebody you might catch the ball and sell it when this guy is just max let me say
it to you again yeah okay I'm not criticizing people who would sell the ball I'm criticizing people
who are knocking those kids who didn't want any money for the ball because the kids weren't that
materialistic okay they just wanted an autograph whatever the hell they wanted then they're
criticizing them it's up to the individual if you want to try to sell it for five million bucks if
you caught it which you did not but if you did that's up to you that's your business
but why not knock little kids because that's not their value oh is that not a little kid
well what we're supposed to do tell little kids that the only thing that counts is money uh
is that is that something good that we ought to be teaching and studying in kids that's precisely
what he's doing when he does that ad exploits it for all it's worth breaking get out of here go blow it
out your ass it's all he's doing is making it into a commercial thing you think they had a
thing out there at Bush State and it said big Macland with a big Mac thing on it they don't have
that out there do they uh oh they do we have two open lines in day I don't want to talk about
Mark McGuire anymore I tried to talk about it yesterday I'm sick and tired of hearing all these
negative people trying to take something that I enjoyed very much it was just a short breath of
fresh air for a few minutes two nights ago and if you didn't like it fine and if you want to knock
it call somebody else and knock it I don't want to hear about it don't send me faxes with it
at a time when we got all this with the world economy is going to hell on a hand basket the
president's on the verge of impeachment hearings every other day you got you got a guy the
guy in plantation to win an iran shot the how you see that story that was a pleasant story
shot the a wife uh eight million times carrying the baby no less right in front of a school bus
full of school kids then went back in the house and the house got on fire and he's like they find
a body inside very pleasant story everything you see in the news we got plain crack plain crack
over the day in place all kinds of negativity we have one night of the year when we finally have
something we can be I'm not saying it's the beginning and it's not all the important it was just
fun for those of us who cared about it that's all oh no we don't want any fun okay good you'll be
just stick around here all your life pal you'll be perfect at cemetery village you'll fit in
like a rubber glove oh man this this so these people are enough to make me sit back and stick a
big stokie in my purse from our friends and next to guys George is puffing on one one Q a m
but Neil Roger Shale you're looking for glory holes so i was in bed the other day and his earthquake
started in the big brook in my inflatable doll her electrical jawed shorted out and a
electric cuted my you know what then she popped and started flying all over the place it was
terrible good thing i buttered with my pretty bang visa card because the next day the visa
card guide comes cleans the vest lean off the walls and buys me a new love doll this one's cuter than
the last one cool not just visa pretty bang visa oh no it's 1 0 2 5 something okay it gets really old
and Luana is jumping up and down put another one of her memos out and said you bastard's
better get with her to your off the door you're out on your ass Gary Sarner be a number one

he's going to resign which i seriously doubt impeachment process takes weeks and months and
impeachment of a president which a lot of people out there are too stupid to understand
doesn't mean that they're getting rid of it means that there are hearings it's an impeachment
process if you're convicted then they'll see it they don't get that oh he's being impeached well

hang out for at least like three minutes here's my any would six question marks hello
you're on yeah you're on okay here's a mobile in the margate hello
hey Neil how are you doing i could be doing better pal we're about now in a half today we're
starting to move up into we're about now in a half of a show now we're just a thickening
did you happen to listen to the first thing this morning i heard little bits and pieces okay i
normally don't listen to them i put them on during the commercials i listen to how i
don't during the commercials i put them on yeah they were talking about famous homerun yesterday
and the hurls had an article about i guess famous homerun this morning mentioning bobby Thompson's
home run right in the 51 uh playoff yeah these guys were so adamant that the hurls was
all about it being a three game playoff theory they were so sure they were ripping the hurls now
he's the hurls too but the hurls was right it was a three game playoff theory yeah golly
like can't stand this little twerp yeah was so sure that and how old is this guy 10
going on what about six five this guy was so sure ripping and so is deep bow about that it was a
one game playoff um start to tell you go that they were three game playoff fact then right
uh it's just amazing and that's what i said before and gildey's on there the other day screaming
and yelling about bobby Thompson's home run he wouldn't know bobby Thompson from uh from uh Bobby
Schwartz i mean what what does he know about it in 1951 we're talking this good is like 15 years old
what does he know about anything you know i'm only 36 years old but i do read i've been a
baseball fan my whole life i do read a lot i watch heel clips right i knew that i wasn't around
but i knew it because i read about it i said we're in the first few minutes of the show today i was
screaming about that show they have these people on screaming about stuff they know nothing about
and i said that this kid wouldn't know rush huggers from gill Hodges from russell wasis and i'll
say it again and he's on there the and you know but that's why that show is so popular because it fits
imperfectly in this town like all these idiots calling hankiest today about roger merris who
weren't even born when merris was playing baseball and i agree with you you know and i was the
marathon as far as in in his history because what the guy did was tremendous but he does not
belong in the hall no he doesn't have the stats because he had two productive years yet 39
homers and six dandy he had 61 and 61 right and the fact he was mvp two years in row that doesn't
make him automatically in the hall of fame he was a lifetime 260 hitter his stats over his career
were like you know good he was a good player but certainly not impressive enough to be in the hall
of fame i agree with you and in fact it wasn't for the 61 home runs in 61 the make that better
stats better stats i mean by we're not in the same ballpark are you kidding me yeah but i'm
talking about the year of 61 oh yeah really of course i mean all the way around they weren't in
the same league manal but he won the mvp i think it was in 56 at three sixty five did merris ever
hit close to three sixty five oh of course now he was a two sixty lifetime hitter no but i just
had to get i mean you know that's one that's one of the reasons why but but you see you're just
starting to catch on with the sports elements of this station are primarily a lot of people talking
about stuff they don't know about exactly but that's not a fact that if you've got a sports show
that's not a fact that you should let live by yeah and then he made us i mean it was two minutes
before that that he made another mistake saying that the giants were three games out the one
of our great well in fact there too and somebody took on the test on that one yeah i mean if you're
gonna be on a sports show get your facts straight and act like a professional a man all right god bless
you sir there you go he was not gonna worst he was he great we have an open line in date and two
and brownered five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen t line here's a lady
in Miami hello Neil yes man how are you how's down to 175 points you don't care do you listen you
were talking about Stan major the other day or maybe it was on where me i'm not sure who Stan
major oh yeah and it reminded me of a story um 18 years ago when he was on w and wf long me 50
up yeah he uh he had his topic was uh hitting your hand writing and now um analyze analyze
analyze so i was 13 at the time and i sent mine in and he called my house to talk to me and stuff
like that great well that's good news okay let's say here a lot more about that oh my god
Jesus Joseph and Mary that was pretty titillating wasn't it wow okay we have an open line in
to a brown word five six seven oh five sixty oh man i think he owes me a lot more than two grand
now let's go to plantation hello i'll go now yes sir how are you doing buddy okay listen i grew up
up north and uh pretty good kind of star on that yes but i enjoy your show and everything like that
night i hear you and every every day and you talk about like goyam and the schvata and stuff like
that and i know you grew up with the terminology of the yiddish of the jewish or whatever it is
yeah but what difference what's the difference between saying goyam schvata or kike what do you
mean by that well i just mean like it's like saying because kike can never be a kike is automatically a
derogatory term schwarze it just means a person who's black goyam means a person who's not
Jewish how do you know how do we know how do i just say no no no how do we know that it's not a
derogatory remark when you say goyam i hear goyam every day and you use it in like a in a bad
sense you know i mean i don't know a bad sense well you say like the goyam don't do this they don't do
that so what's the difference between a kike and i you know i'm saying like a kike because a kike is
Jewish that's why yeah yeah so what i'm saying is like you what are you saying sir don't say i
speak when he's here there's a humorous show if you don't have a sense of humor then you want to
find another past time turn on lardas he won't give you one laugh okay you won't laugh you won't
snicker one time it would be perfect a match made in heaven you won't hear anything on that show
that'll make you amused and leased bit this is a radio show and i'm going to say it for the
eight million of time if you don't have a sense of humor then you don't belong listening to this
show you're too uptight you're out of control my goyam is your friend we have an open line in
brown or five six seven oh five sixty five sixty on the eighteen two wireless line i'm sitting

stuff around your arms and cutting off your circulation but all know i'm like playing only one
side against the other it's all a bunch of bullcrap sir that's the message get with it get a sense
of humor and get with it if you don't understand it we'll send a guy they'm interpret to your house if

just like they put that crap on wemy at nine thirty last night which i didn't see i was at the track
but they put another old show on there yeah see these people don't understand when you're talking
about stuff that has a time element to it you can't put it on like three weeks later or two weeks later
and keep showing stuff after it's lost it has no impact anymore it's meaningless they're killing me
they're just destroying me they're devastating this show i really enjoyed watching him and uh...

telling you that for years i'm not one of those insecure people who it was terrifying that if
we lose one listener we're not going to replace them with ten new ones i'm not concerned about that

great day pal pretty weak we have an open-line in power at five six seven oh five sixty
five sixty on the mobile one line doesn't he doesn't understand what whammy's all about does he
that's a gay club you moron okay where we go let's uh my name you with 14 question marks hello
hi Neil yes sir yes i was listening to you show earlier this afternoon this morning uh
uh um you know i love you show and i think George is cool but i don't i don't understand what he
says uh well you know that it's all the other his spanish i happen to be a Cuban but i'm married to
a Honduran Honduran yeah oh man look out no she's white she's white and i don't i don't understand
it he's white he thinks that cuba's the only island that the spaniards went and lived in uh
it's plenty well he's wrong is that what is it the counter Honduras for this plenty of white people
and i don't like it i can pre-heather there's a lot of white people in Santa Barbara you know and i
bet the guy that just called you i bet he's a Cuban the guy that was just make a fun here without
voting uh huh you know and i don't like it jackass that wants to date with alcohol sting exactly uh huh
and i you know and i was watching the show the other on last night on whammy and he was he was also
talking about well i'm i'm from europe i'm from a fifth world country but my family's from europe my
ancestors your ancestors okay my ancestors are from russia and i'm embarrassed about it they're from
many of them are white people in america as well no central america okay we're saying this guy
this guy's a good guy and then he put up ten question marks as he thought you might not be Cuban
no i think you might be a Puerto Rican he really hates the Puerto Rican my grandparents are spaniards
and let me tell you when i went to spain they treated us like crap do they say esparanpa
there you know like that but i mean i don't i don't like that he says oh like all central america's
i want to say one thing before you let me go and get that because no you get all other his spanics
i don't even know why he accepts Cubans are a bunch of uh shfartses i think is what you said
what Neil said today early on you know what you said you said there either like a half reads or
indians or shfartses but definitely not like white people so something like that
Neil let me say one thing yeah Cubans came to this country as refugees
the central and south americans are coming here as immigrants and as a refugee you get a lot more
help from the government yeah and that's something that a lot of you gotta say right you gotta say
refugee you gotta say right uh the kill out of the Cubans that did come here in the sixties they
were educated they had a lot of they were middle and upper class Cubans that's why they were
here that's like a refugee yeah that's why they were able to adjust in the united states and we
have to understand that these people coming now are very poor they have lack of education and it's
gonna take more time for them i think i like i think i like the Colombians the best you know
i'm an atheist Neil i believe you know 100% will you say oh yeah i think i used to you that's right
no wonder he's putting a lot of stuff when you stop the crap okay we have an open line in
date five six seven oh five sixty and five five sixty on the mobile one line everybody was excellent
you ripped the crap out of you i liked it twenty two if you're gonna be on the air now like uh you're
gonna take a lot of crap okay don't take a lot of offense him yes from him uh one of your people he's
no you've got yes he is don't pay f.i.u.b.in he's Cuban like m.e. shaper would say it was a cuban he's always
probably he probably dating uh what's his name Venus the penis hero right now they're probably hanging
together i don't know what the hell he is not okay why are you so obsessed with worrying about
what that people are that's not forget about that guy i'm just talking in general what differences
to make colonial Mexican Nicaragua and what what differences to make as long as they're
doing fine if you only got a few moments or two days yeah there's over there breathlessly waiting for
them even more we know so if we ever get a good call and that guy you're right that was the guy from
the f.i.u. with a new story he's probably related to those other little holios in there like
a multiple circle they're sitting around in the circle jerk with all these wild stories and his
wife is from Honduras this guy wouldn't know how I'm doing if they stuck his finger up his
rectum in fact maybe that's what's going on right now there's a mobile in boca hello how's he
okay sir that story for you i'm going on vacation with my family and i um go to letters to my
fun teachers to tell him we were going on vacation in two weeks so he can get the work in advance
i'm gonna letter back from the principal along with the state statue that says she's gonna have
me arrested if i try to take my son out of school if he's not ill excellent good choice okay we have
an open line in broir five six seven oh five sixty and what's he looking for sympathy to school it's
school you're just starting now i mean he just got two would like a two or three month vacation now
you're taking your kid on vacation again i say call a god damn uh whatever it is yeah the two
it off is the Truman officer yeah college him carry he's got the Truman officer waiting just to
take your kid to the who's go and you two take the gants and mishfahoe and lock him up and throw away
the key get out of here with your boring story okay pal in fact he probably wants to go to the dolphin
game just before they sent him all to jail let's go to a mobile in pampered pines hello hello
yes sir how you doing i just got a quick commentary in reference to the uh dumbbrowski
yes i understand you think i know he's been getting like a lot of a lot of
bad friends about the getting a million dollar salary uh-huh
finally i you know i'd rather give him or any general manager of a hundred dollar salary
than a best mediocre ball player getting paid more than that and uh forch is one of the few
industries where the management makes less than the employees yeah and that's really just you know
all i want to say okay thank god bless you he had a fact that brosky said he's gonna stay here for five
more years and the smiley yesterday had that pointless most idiotic press conference in the
history main fact you put it all together and then john henry think they were working out the
details right you know on one side of the state even they were having a press conference with smiley
and on the other side john and henry and wanes people are all sitting there crossing the
teeth and dotting the eyes dotting the and uh have it a good time it's it's a done deal okay
so maybe we had a little premature evaluation yesterday but trust me when i tell you wane is out
of god damn marlon c o'wayne see a baldy you cockmark jackass
here's a deer field hello i'm doing great i see it survived the sighting from the bird there
yeah not bad huh the bird it's not the bird it's not the bird you don't know the difference
between the burden captain day is that who that was yeah oh my mistake yeah the bird is uh

LA for a couple days in here fill and all that i mean that's that's how i mean you're in this
by ten times better than this but are you sure yeah positive and i mean this sports people over
there are loyal over here i mean they actually care when the beans fail they actually being one
might not love well that's because they're actually following the sport and they really know what
they're talking about as opposed to here where they just give a lot of misinformation and it works
out fine because the colors don't know either oh i know and the little kids that were calling
hank the other day talking about roger merris they wouldn't know roger merris if he punched them
in the press from his grave i mean they have no idea who he was what the whole nothing and they don't
care about more for bar either i work in a building and it's like that man said i mean this ball of
history and they're still talking about oh what are you doing tonight this time i mean they don't
care they don't care that when i think i destroyed the marlins uh-huh but i'm gonna have my revenge
and i'm i have my season tickets and i can't wait to go into that arena a couple of months down the
road when there's no bs or jobo does a normal flop and all you got to look at is came and weed
and siv mcclean just sitting there and it's like oh yeah this is real exciting look at the new building
but uh wonder i can i'll tell you we'll like the building log guarantee you haven't been in there yet
oh no i don't know i don't know but can you see it man i'm telling you it's gonna be the one good
thing there's lots of places to go on things to do and lots of different kinds of food and places to
hang out and bars and joints and that's what we'll be doing to you know once the second period starts
will be going on all that stuff because nobody wants you the rest of the game yeah i got a phone
it's gonna be like the first couple seasons of them originally whenever nobody went there it's
the actual loyal hockey fans who want to see the game now the novelty of the arena will get a lot
of a similar but then after that who knows oh yeah welcome to self-lord amen okay finally it's
in its possible good luck you have a great life here's the guy that's going to a civilized
place with all those wild people out there in a white coach all those mudslides hey listen that's
gonna do it we had a tremendous we have a tremendous day today it was okay it was all right on this
end it was spectacular god i'm gonna tell you oh god no i i never realized how good i was till today
whatever whatever what does that mean i never realized how great i was until this show today speaking
of great donny b i guess time he was supposed to do the show he left his condoms home so donny
these gonna be doing the talking baseball show it and the marlin's game is coming up it's gonna be
something we can't say the word on the air donny 99 i'm sorry i haven't gotten that down fat yet
i've got it's all you have one thing down pat though you learn to milk this thing for all
this world like hang did yesterday he's no fool you're learning from the master milking at sunny
on air for a half hour he had relp hot gun air for like an hour and a half how can i try
to get a speaker to donny if you're gonna make it in this business shlipper how's that not bad that's
not too bad shlipper don't talk about bluff that way though not a good idea for your future your
career hey well who's that 12 year old kid yeah doing the show Monday yeah like i said
the pot called the kettle pink well i know that's why he's my age and you keep going
eight bird girl kids uh i think i'm not and how you had guilty that's 12 uh we called you like a
17 year old kid which isn't probably that far from reality hey listen i got news for you got
balls of an elephant compared to gellie so what are you complaining about i appreciate that i think
yeah that was like a back back as tainted compliment yeah i thought that's what it was so let's see
the marlin's blue now let's talk some baseball isn't that the name of the show let's talk about Ryan
Durin and while Jim constady and all that great yanky pitching staff Louis a royal whitey Ford
trying to earn you know yeah alcohol problems you don't take shots at him i'm not taking shots
into me at glasses you know what Ryan Durin looked like yeah i do you know that when he used to warm
up on the agreement from the bullpen and warmed up he used to throw purposely hit the screen with
a couple of pitches he used to throw so hard and they had bad eyesight legitimately and had no
idea where the ball was going and they have headers used to freak out exactly that was one of his
best assets that's right now our lighter you talk about that all the time it's called purpose
purposely wild yeah although he probably didn't do it on purpose um-hmm share what do you think
about this home of wire thing you were getting into it i what sort of say it was great in the
a nationwide adjogantic ratings in here because it's not his fourth time it was pretty week
half the ratings in his town that a seven seven share on fox on channel seven locally and that
nationwide had almost a thirteen there rating well Dawson's Creek was on down here you know oh that's
it yeah forget about that uh-huh and plus we have whammy down here that don't have been any place
else that's true they probably thought I allowed was still gonna be on with drag bill drag
yeah see there's more yet there's now he's saying very good Donna you're coming along
I know a little you know yeah you know honorable mention uh uh Jewish person
Jew yeah line of Jewish person yeah well it's like and this is talking baseball it's not
in your Roger show you got to you're going to get the sports people upset if you start
doing my stick they don't have a sense of humor I'll make that talk in his
crab I'll mix it to something talking Jews and stuff like that and co-facts yeah
sandy co-fast with Jewish how about Joel Horlin the white socks he was Jewish
Hank Greenberg yeah there you go Hank Goldberg and to anybody baseball
Nikki Rivers
I thought was Jewish if it was good enough for Rod Truor it's good enough for
Nikki Rivers didn't he have a gambling problem I heard Hank talking about let
me say this to you I was here's the real test you got 26 minutes before
the pregame show okay okay if you can drop as many names the next 26
minutes as Hank does in five minutes then you know you'll have it made all right
that's what I'll shoot you got to work on that that's what I'll shoot behind
you drop your first you thought to me so I you know I was talking to Neil Rogers
earlier in the show yeah that would get you far from about here to 205
Cliff Lloyd won't talk to me he won't talk to me he'll have to yeah what about Jimmy Johnson
fan he was yeah that's true Jimmy Johnson Dave Dembrowski well see you can you
can be the opposite of all the ass kisses we got on this station you can be
just exactly the opposite because you're not on a Wayne's payroll like some of
these other twerps like Geldie and you can tell it like it is now submarine people
in fact just even make it up just to piss him off that'll be great instead of
all these ass kisses we got on here exactly man oh man I mean Jimmy's but must be
getting sore from all the ants looking it's getting on this station yeah oh
anyway I tried to break more stories like you did yesterday we had a right on
the head we were just a little bit premature that's the way it goes and of
course when you're gonna have a premature evaluation you always got to wear
your what do you have Yomaka condom oh god oh geez
great day Donnie we code five and a half minutes for a great and the bills in
the mail hey well I appreciate it you take care yourself I will all right
you
