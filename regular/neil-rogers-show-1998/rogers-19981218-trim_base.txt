It's Friday, you bastard.
A hot! Come on!
You can't wait to finish the morning.
It's still Saturday night.
A hot!
I couldn't tell the worth of arms from a whole morning break.
But still just fine and full-ed.
They call on 50 to 50.
But doesn't use the 30-stop and he's the man to do it.
Oh!
Just give you, if the daddy's job is just in you, you just have to decide who put yourself around.
And when you're done with your career and hate to lock us out, you can do our business.
Come here, the right way back, you'll free go on to business.
But for the time to go through it, the start to new, the start is over, and it gets them off to do it.
The 10-0-2-560-WQM, Happy Friday, too.
The lynching is underway in Washington.
There you go, the page.
Henry, he's hiding it.
Bob Livingston, by the way, screwed around on his wife numerous times.
The incoming speaker of the house.
Bob Livingston from Louisiana.
That's right, he's not, no plans to resign.
He never lied under oath and but a beat, but a boot, but a buff, and etc.
And so on.
Although one of his colleagues last night said, which I thought was kind of apropos.
He took an oath of marriage and lied about that.
But hey, that's a whole different feather of another row.
What is it?
So here's another, Philan, who are up there, Henry Hyde leading off the lynch mob in Washington today.
And in the meantime, we'll read about a bunch of stupid ball games.
You know what I'm talking about?
Do you follow?
Now, can that possibly be who you thought it was and how come it doesn't say it under any more?
What happened on that call?
George.
What happened?
With what?
With the call in Hollywood that you thought was Andy from Hollywood?
Oh, they hung up.
Oh, thank God for that.
Wouldn't that be something if it was that Jack asked calling round of the box?
Hey, the word yesterday and he was no, you understand?
In any language just about no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's it.
We don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to see out of one of here from you.
You make me want to puke.
Okay, almost as much, but not quite as the lynch mob that's going on up right now.
You are witnessing, by the way, the dissolution of one of the two major American parties right before your eyes.
So maybe in the midst of all of this mayhem and lunacy and all the very, very hysterical crap that's going to go on for several hours today,
leading up to a vote either late today or tomorrow, which already it's a foregone conclusion that probably all four of the articles of impeachment will pass.
Since it's just a little bit on the partisan side, you're watching the dissolution of the Republican party.
They just don't get the message.
They refuse to get it.
Tom Le Hays got them all whipped into shape.
And they're all immediately saying yes, yes, yes, yes, whatever you say.
Okay, and here's this fat cow hypocrites standing up their Henry and his hide, leading it off,
hucking a china, giving us a big song and a dance about the, you know, perjury under oath and the meantime,
here's a guy that broke up a family that's a land where, and in fact, I think that all of them, all four hundred thirty five members of the house,
and then all hundred members of the senate, all I have to want to go under oath, interrogation about every detail of their sex lives that anybody wants to act.
Well, let Larry Flint, just like in that movie, huh?
He can be the judge. That's right.
Just like in a goddamn Larry Flint movie.
Since it was hospital magazine that outed Bob Livingston, by the way,
let's go on Larry.
But just sanctimonious hypocrites, just like I told you,
will be at the borders in plantation where that sunrise tomorrow and sunrise boulevard out there in West Broward from noon to two,
for our center one, which were over not just a hundred thousand, but over a hundred and one thousand one, a one, three, seventy five.
Thank you, profusely.
And let's keep that rolling along right through the end of the month.
You got only knows where we can, you know, find it wind up with that damn thing, right?
Yeah, it's good.
Only knows.
So we do it swimmingly well, although I will say this.
Oh, not in the same category with Baldy.
Every time you pick up your newspaper every day of your life,
businessmen moved by spirit of giving says the Harold,
Hi Pinga and Elmore donated total of 1.35 million more donations this time to,
let's see, Hi Pinga, his wife, Marty and his sports team, the dolphins are donating a million dollars,
500,000 of the Jewish Federation of Broward, 250,000 of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation,
and 250,000 of the Jewish National Fund.
How do you like that?
Now, where's the thing about how many trees that they're going to be able to build over there?
Like an additional 10,000 trees that they're going to be able to plant in Israel, something like that.
Are you excited about their building 10,000 more trees they're planting?
Oh, there you go.
And I've always told you there's only one strip of desert that's worth fighting over and that's Vegas.
Not that piece of crap in the over there.
So it just goes on and on.
Every time I'm in it, of course, he's only worth over a billion dollars,
most of which he's extracting from your pockets, by the way, but nevertheless.
And oh, yes, I did hear coming in this morning.
I heard the amusing commentary about how the local sports franchise is well understand,
how much money they've taken out of your pockets.
Is that why Geoli, each and every year in their existence,
the Appanthor ticket prices have gone up?
Is that the answer why?
So that those tickets in the lower bowl are now a very, very modest $57 ticket.
So that you're working class people can come up and enjoy that real great value,
the great value is on a good food too, right?
That real good delicious food that's very fairly priced.
Am I right?
No.
So there you go.
As the destruction continues and it never stops.
And of course, the sports nerds out there, they can't be worried about dropping bombs on Baghdad,
about the Lynch mob that's going on in Washington right now.
We're not concerned about those things.
All are concerned about is who's going to win the game and will they cover the spread?
Isn't that the important thing in life?
Thank you.
Just checking in.
Just want to make sure I understand.
Pop this thing up.
Product John Congress for a second or two in there.
And let's see what the...
The distinguished membership on this side.
I'm pleased now to recognize our minority leader, the distinguished gentleman from Missouri,
who's going to get our preventative minutes.
The gentleman is going to get his race now.
Hi, preventative minutes.
It was wrong.
It's wrong.
He's about what do you say?
400 times he said it was something like that.
Okay, that's enough.
So today I thought being the beginning of really moving into the holidays now,
it's the 18th of December, is Chris going out today or do we know in the event?
We don't know.
I mean, now that we got over 100 grand and he's probably got several phone numbers,
I'm going to assume that probably those guys are much more interested in getting laid
than they are going out and raising more money for us.
But we appreciate their help profusely.
That really worked like a charm.
Maybe he will be going out today.
I have no idea.
I don't know.
Exactly.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
I could have said it.
Isn't that what they say in Congress when they do the yeses and the noes instead of saying yes, they all say it.
What goes to show you how silly it all is.
You know, I mean, why can't they at least come into the 18th century?
Like I said, you're feeling pretty good today.
You say, I, yes, so it's just stupid.
It's just a bunch of bull crap.
And of course, you all understand what I'm talking about, don't you?
That's the American way.
Right. That's right.
It's all a bunch of horse crap.
So there we go, but we are dropping the bombs.
They're bursting in air.
It's bombing a minute of the stone age.
We're hitting the targets.
We're doing a spectacular job over there.
But we've got to get this thing rolling.
Don't you understand?
We got to get this thing on because God forbid that that thing should drag on for a few days.
And then you got your Christmas and your new years.
And then we got that next house of representatives, which is going to have five fewer Republicans.
As if that would make a difference.
And by the way, many of the more right wing Republicans are going to be out.
And also some of the right wing senators.
And that's one thing to keep in mind.
Al Demado, he's going to be gone.
He's been replaced.
And others of his will have been replaced in the new.
Even though the numbers are still the same in the Senate 5545.
Some of the more right wing anti Clinton people are gone.
Like Al Demado, who just keeps coming to mind over and over again.
I just mentioned that for those people who are panicking.
Those ten people out there who might care.
So we'll just do kind of like a holiday show today.
We'll play a lot of stuff.
Or we could put this stuff on.
Part of it.
Some of it.
They want to be inconvenient from Missouri.
Come on.
Our young people are in.
Okay, that's enough.
We could pot that up.
I'm sure that the all-new station is probably playing that.
Or else most people are planted right in front of their TV set.
So if I probably would, you know, present them as alternative today.
Instead of just potting up this pond versus debate in which we already know exactly what they're going to say.
Depending on which party they're from.
But we'll find out.
We'll take a little survey on that and find out what the audience wants to hear today.
Do you want to hear more of this?
And the decision has been made.
Or do they want to hear more of that?

Dr. Trittall是什麼 engine?
twenty twos where they say gotcha okay we gotcha and now we know you're
gonna be forced to lie and then we're gonna say well guess what lying about
that all of a sudden we just decided to say an impeachable offense
is there anybody in their right mind who really believe that no of course not
of course not was it a crime against the government against the people against
anything was it uh... no of course did i have anything to do with the
conduct of the government of this country no of course not everybody knows that
so here we have a read the republican party destructing itself which i say
they're self-destructing their emulating themselves right there in front of
your place
and they can waste the next five or six months with impeachment trial in the
senate which you can bet your last dollar we will go through that
and it'll be even now sure more upon the rest of the old j-thing it'll be
going as we'll give all these housewives something to do every day anyway
that it just watching the soap
and bob barker who's getting really old and what here
you have something else to do
day after day after day after day
and what is in here will i'll be uh... sitting here talking to myself of course
i'm used to that
will probably do that today anyway
what you think i would think so
because everybody's watching dickhead part in all these other dicks up there
and they're screaming in their yelling and they're participating they're all
pissed off and fired up in the foaming at the mouth
and while he's speaking everybody on one side gets up and they're getting
a mistake of a thorough plotting and then we hide with speaking a moment ago
everybody on the other side was good and thank god just remember the very first
day
when we're holding the house you do you hear a committee hearings
the very first day when john conures and the Henry white here to hide
spatter and talked about how the we were
guarantee that there's not going to be any of political partisanship and a
that
right now no seriously
we all don't we all believe that that there wasn't any political partisanship
involved in the
because it's much more important for that
that that that that that
here's a derail hello

fifty pound five sixty on a mobile one line let's see what aces got to us that's a good
even okay that's enough cannot stand red necks in congress i mean people that are so obviously red
necki red necks and bubbleheads like mary bono bubbleheads bubbleheaded philanderers there's another
we got mary bono now we got bob living sent by the short hairs he i like the way he says
he has had several infidelity's okay and then he then he tries to narrow it down what one moment please
uh i have an occasion straight from my marriage and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family
then he says this chapter was a small but painful part of the past and otherwise wonderful
marriage of thirty three years this chapter so you see how people conveniently they kind of change
things as they go along first he starts out by saying he's been screwing around with a whole
bunch of broads got only he can't even keep track so many but then he talks about this chapter
in his life just like Henry Hart was a young man showing his wildos he was only 41 years old when
he screwed around with his broth and lied to his teeth and said that he wasn't married and broke
up this guy's marriage who lives in western that's all that's all about it is not absolutely nobody's
get fact Henry Hart started out by saying that that people sexualized is nobody else's god damn
business and this is all that it's about and then they you know they cornered
bubbing there and they they put him in a position where there's no way they just put yourself
in that position you're the president of a country no matter what country it is and you're
gonna go under oath and they're gonna ask you embarrassing personal questions about did you get
blow jobs and is that your semen on the blue dress and etc and so on it wasn't good and was it bad
what are you gonna say no that's right guaranteed
oh but he lied under oath to come in there yeah big deal okay like uh they say so what it's the
so what defense and guess what i say so what out but don't confuse these fascists with the truth
man because the lynching is well underway and it will go on for hours and hours and hours and hours
and then they'll be voting later on either out today or tomorrow and then like i said for months
and months and months you're gonna have a lynching on the air see the one thing about lynch mobs
they don't wait that's why they can't wait for a couple of days for the abominant Iraq for that
you know be over with lynch mobs don't wait when they start hyperventilating and forming at the
mouth they want they they smell it they taste that blood and they want it right now like Dracula he don't
wait as soon as he smells that blood he's got his teeth in your thing boy it's just it's just
boiling in here i've offended 26 i mean i don't know how many times have i complained about it boiling
in here like maybe three times in the last year and usually from those pinniny std people
oh burry jackass by the way says whammy is off to a great start because they got the marbles
there you are you know hank is right about you you're not even worth the the space you take up on
the planet or the air that you're breathing you're such a pustel animus puss burry whammy you
off to a great start yeah by the way how many games the heat one so far it's Friday you fast good
good
well buffalo has a football team the greatest in the land and everybody thinks that great
I say daily ah the buffalo feels not enough but what do you what i mean so just sing a
little and you say my amin when you say buffalo super cool and near that buffalo bells
buffalo bells dedicated team in the history of human race data buffalo bells dedicated
dance then slice bread and can be it yeah there you go and your and your chance up that red
next up delicious and that banjo holy sweet god listen now when you say buffalo bills it don't
sound so red that you do it everybody sing along now are you bill fan here we go
west of buffalo bills at the best team they have the best record over the last five years
and they went to the super bowl for all times which is one and i can say for this scum
suckin fish and they're at the greatest because they believe like their uniforms they share his
hell beat that heck kind of having a fish on the helmet cuz dad that buffalo whole bills
are you sure that fast football team what i ever seen in the history of my life they are
the buffalo bills the buffalo bills the whole of gym telling the greatest quarter back in the lead
yeah everybody that buffalo bells dead of buffalo bells and they've been around longer than
the stinking rotten fish well then a buffalo bill buffalo bill what would you rather have as a
Santa buffalo or a fish okay it's 1032 at 560 wqn by the way you're welcome so anyway
somebody factors did you look at this thing with the definitions of center and in peach and then
underneath it they've written should Clinton be tried on the senate and found guilty what will
the results then be what will the results then be as the umpire says it for his base when the
throw beach by 15 feet you're out that's the results will be only the interesting part of this
whole thing is maybe they're not thinking too clearly well obviously not because you know when
you when you're rabid and you start forming obviously you've lost your ability to think clearly
but after February I'm pretty sure it's after February 1 or February something at that point if
Grobe came president if Clinton were impeached by and convicted in the senate remove from office
and Grobe comes president he can still serve two full terms if Clinton were to resign tomorrow the
law says that he can't do that he could only serve one full term plus they're made with this term
but if it's after February do believe in certainly a senate trial is going to take longer won't be
over by February will it no of course not so like I said the Republican Party is like kind of making
way for more reasonable people and to that we say thank you even if it's only by accident even if
you have taken leave of your senses here's four Myers hello yeah yes sir my name is John
time you have a sense of more public and please I am completely disgusted by the word by parties
doing to both then I'm no fan of building I'm free I hate what he's done to my people my friends
but I think it's that absolute disgrace I think maybe the worst thing happened to this
company since watergate maybe even Vietnam what do you mean since watergate I think it's the worst
thing that ever happened to this country the worst thing ever yes the Vietnam that's maybe
going a little bit far but one thing one question next to the civil war I would say was the worst
thing that ever happened okay I think except that one question yes what's just one question
do you think that the presence of our planes or the graves losing the playoffs yes well yeah that
was important well if you think that presence of our planes and missiles over Iraq are directly
related to the presence of nerve endings in built-in spinis yes thank you okay whatever that man okay
so in other words he's very upset with this party but he's talking about built-in spinis again okay
I mean didn't you hear the tapes when Monica said you call that a penis I mean what's wrong with you sir
you're just not the fan attention like most of your cohorts you're too blinded by the blight
does that what manford man said something about about uh huh blinded by the blight and I don't want to
hear about uh what's his name because he makes me sick to my stomach but also recorded that and uh oh
we have an open line and date and one and brown or five six seven oh five sixty pound five
sixty on the spring thing line what is the story it goes to show you anybody can be a big six
face okay you can scream and you can whale you couldn't sing your out of a paper sack and you're
going to make millions of dollars for it I would say he's probably got less talent than even Mickey
work okay here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale hello hello nil yes sir how you doing great that's great
but what's the deal for a year now that you came on five six you're the best thing on that
best god damn thing on that day we got bomb on Iraq we got the president's been impeachment uh the

find the exact location for you do we know the exact location yet of course not because he'll let
us know when he gets there he'll find a good spot where all the hot chicks are and then we'll
erase some more money today let me say it again 101 thousand three seventy five that check
from Wayne Arnold by the way thank you Wayne if you are confused and think that you're a political
poor Wayne Wayne is a food expert he knows he's a world castle burgers and his white
hot he's a food expert just look at him it's obvious he's eating the meal or two in his time you
know what I'm talking about I'm sure you do but he just we want to be a political cramudge and then
the thing about Wayne is that he spreads it around he loves Ted Kennedy he loves Jeff Bush he
loves Lawton Charles he wrote a a moving piece about Lawton Charles and the Danyo daily whatever
that is fish wrapper Wayne just he likes everybody here's a North Miami hello

you want to do an ice princess that he hasn't screwed in 14 years and now because he'd be
used to say oh yeah I screwed around like nobody in the world would say it anyway now it's impeachable
and it's perjury and he's he's violated his oath under the constant the tautia and all the all
the serious crap like somebody really believes this that's got to bring a new one more of course

pick on how about Yitzhak yeah let's pick on some Jewish names today then we'll pick on some
Latino names on Monday we want to spread it around although it is true that most of the bizarre
names are sports names I don't know why that is it's because again of that propaganda they've
been convinced that it has something to do with African names and like I said Nelson Mandela is a
perfectly reasonable sounding name to me if Nelson's good enough for me it's certainly good enough
for any sports about there including Nelson Mandela we have two open lines in day five six seven

move away or somebody gets him with a butterfly net and sticks him far away from us so they can't
bother us anymore we get another one to replace them every single time there's no shortage of
radio misfits out there that much I guarantee that's one thing I've learned over the last 200 years
there is no shortage of chronic radio misfits like that story he was telling me at the game last
week before I realized who it was about how we called this place to complain that he couldn't hear
the station inside the macarena oh by the way we have enough you know they're a little upset that I
keep calling that that baseball season is long over when nobody cares about mac and the
wire anymore so let's call it by the real name okay the national car rectal center
so then anyway it comes over to me it's tell me about how he called here and he makes up this
story about why you know when you co-cwam and you try to get through and get all these extensions
Andrew action awards and all these other people are doing more he's telling me this whole big
start of dance about how he called here to try to get a hold of the engineer and I told him our
engineer who's a good guy but got 50 million different projects that he's got to do all by himself
he's got more important things than to talk out a photo some plugwacker like you about how come you
can't pick up the station in the arena in addition to which if you're such a hockey fan if you know
anything about the sport why would you want to listen to Christina Moore or anybody else for that
matter while you're watching a game so you one thing I'll tell you right now and that is that people
who wear headsets to ball games don't know what the hell it's all about when I used to go to the dolphin
games all those years there were people in front of me and they got their walkman on they got you know
for what why right on the 50 yard line they're these are people who had the best seats in the house
including me what the hell do you need a headset for you it's right there in front of your face
and the same thing at hockey games are these people with their headsets on like Christina Moore is
going to impart some educational things something that will enlighten them about the game that's going
I mean if you're going to learn something from him then you know nothing
so like I said I'm going to start on headsets outside the National Car Rectals Center because
obviously most of those people know nothing about the game which is why they're doing the wave
and they're going stew stew yeah right he don't play for us anymore oh don't confuse us
here's a homestead hello nail yes sir you've got me in stitches what what a bit that was funny
yeah the ocean in the basket anyway yes sir we're happy this morning now we finally signed Ziggy
hasn't told me we we the hour yeah
uh pick them up so little publicity they mentioned that during the game last night during the
fili cougarie game and I didn't even realize it while I was watching that game a little tiny piece
in the paper this morning in the local papers here which give us no hockey coverage and if you
have a magnifying glass you'll see that that's why I've got a DSS I was watching the the fili cougarie game
and I switched over to the lake aim on spot sports show in New York and they were talking about a
little bit but I tell you one gift horse has been and it's still on could make the playoff you
you're not going to make the playoffs no chance also it happens but anyway continue on
I mean this guy is is like god and yeah yeah great defense yeah what you can thank the maple leaves
for that exactly you're welcome you guys had him and then of course now we got Kirk Mueller here so
extra on the wrong goes tomorrow okay well good luck you pal you'll need to get out of here two

George geekus from Pennsylvania that got to be some yeah get that off of their neck geek go ahead sir
he's been packaging he's a geekus I wanted to get you take Neil I'm not what in God's name
or how in God's name what in if they'll God yeah how in his name did do the do the Republicans
possibly think they're gonna get reelected or I don't think realize that this is gonna hurt them in
the election process no I mean no they they're not thinking rationally they're in fact they're all
being manipulated by Tom Delay and the right wing extremist in their party they've been whipped
in the shape they've been threatened they've been intimidated you notice how in the last
I remember that around part all conveniently go step right into line each and every one of the
so-called moderates they've go step right into line and even that fascist Bob Novak on CNN last night
was saying this wouldn't be the the the first time that the the so-called moderate wing of the
Republican Party is shocked and surprised and let everybody down even though he was uh you know
saying it from a different perspective but nevertheless he's right do you think they just don't
honor Republicans that have a lot of money in America these days sir there are there is no more
moderate Republican Party it's the party of Pat Robertson jury fall well Richard Vigory all
these lunatics that's what it is here in the old days here in power something like pop up on the rug
and now all the time it's a major issue right well anyways Neil have a great weekend
just a shame can you can you imagine I don't know if you're old enough but you
you imagine them taking president Kennedy and putting him on the on a on a witness there and
saying have you been screwing around with Marilyn Monroe and with that bitch Samgian
Connors girlfriend and all these other bimboes in the white house he would he would have called
out the CIA and had him all blown away yeah he wouldn't they wouldn't have time for that kind of
matter he was telling all the goddamn tubas what he would have done for another bad pigs invasion
Neil down those please okay thanks man okay here's the preview okay we have two open lines
and they two and Broward I keep asking should we put this stuff on we got the pot is working today okay
when the pot is working smoke it but evidently they maybe they really want to hear a show today I
don't know because I know we're we're fighting up hill today because you know America's mesmerized
they're sitting there why like like they're going to hear these people saying something new I mean
is that a joke or what we're going to hear these guys say something they haven't said over and
over and over again making all these impangent hysterical speeches it's a waste of time they should
limited the debate to 10 minutes and gone on with the vote then it could have gone out and played
golf or something for crying out loud or got laid because this is just another exercise just like
the other hearings were the last two three weeks just another exercise it's all window dressing
it's a side show they're putting on for it they've already got the votes and they know it so what
the hell is the point of wasting all this time and acting duly outraged and indignant
one call left on the board okay like I said here's adventurer hello Neil yes sir yes did you hear
that congressman from Mississippi's comments last night about the invades about the bombing of a
rack no he said that president Clinton should be ashamed of himself for doing this in the middle
of advent and then the on the eve of the birth of our lord and savior and I you know I almost
don't forget to write a right to write a right to write a right to write a right to write a right
momentum and ding dong exactly yeah hey uh in closing yeah doctor lecture doctor lecture okay thanks

Hello to a 560 WDQ and we've got tremendous news for you boys and girls.
Two pieces of tremendous news.
It's only like 8 o'clock at night.
That means we've got hours and hours and hours and hours that the bombs will be bursting in air.
That's number one piece of news.
You always believe the studies that are the most you know when you tell you what you want to hear.
The study says chocolate lovers may live longer.
Scientists already have suggested that eating chocolate may make you happy.
Now they say men who indulge in chocolates may live longer.
A study of 7,841 Harvard Mail Grange which found that this is not we're not talking about fudge.
Okay, that's a different category.
They live a lot shorter.
7,841 Harvard Mail Grange which found that chocolate and candy eaters regardless of how voracious they're appetite for the goodies
live almost a year longer than those who abstain.
The researchers from Harvard University School of Cuma Kelt who study was published in this week's issue of the British medical urinal
said they don't know why this is.
They speculate however that antioxidants present in chocolate may have a health benefit.
Oh give me those antioxidants. Let me shovel them down my place.
The science is stressed in fact that what's the main ingredient in fish food? Rich, thick chocolate.
Mmm, with that marshmallow and at the gooey caramel like all the just streams ribbons of caramel inside.
Oh there's a satin. Yeah.
Boatting with them in their baton again is right.
This tape last night.
It would be every word.
Get it off of my face. Hey, it's a satin.
There's another one for you. Okay, you laundry head, you ansel, you barbeying, you loon tick with a bad mustache and a real bad complexion.
Anyway, in the study those who weighed a moderate amount of sweets allowing themselves only one to three candy bars a month paired the best.
Oh that, now that's not so good.
Having a 36% lower risk of death compared with non-candy eaters. What was that again?
One to three candy bars a month.
Mmm, I can do that in an hour.
Although they've fared worse than the moderates, those who ate three or more sweets, we still love longer than those who ate no candy with a 16% decreased risk of death.
How do you like that?
In other words, if you want to live 36% longer, eat like one to a three candy bar a month.
If you want to like live 16% longer, when a doubt pick out, just shovel it down and the candy too.
And the whatever kind of chocolate you want.
We got any chocolates? You got any more of those Hershey's chocolates in there?
No, seriously, I would like to live 16% longer than the next couple of years.
Oh look at that.
All right.
Oh look at that.
Well you must have hit those as well because that was all over that refrigerator.
Hershey's cookies and cream, these little little Hershey's and not kisses, but they're like, oh these are, this is white chocolate.
Oh, fat with brown chocolate in them.
I bought an assortment.
Or hot meat.
What else was in there?
Oh this is the last of it.
Huh? This is the last of it.
This sucks. You're like white chocolate?
I mean I'm heated. I got it for mostly other people.
Oh, I like sweet.
I like sweet.
Okay. I do like stuff that's sweet.
For example, I like Pepsi better than Coke only because it's sweeter.
But this is sickeningly sweet because it's white chocolate.
Oh, but I'll eat it because I want to live longer.
What are you laughing about?
Huh? The more you eat the longer you live.
In fact, I think 20 or 30 pint of fish food on a way home sounds good to me.
Because most of it is chocolate.
Let's hear it for chocolate baby.
Oh, here's a mobile in Boca.
Hello.
Yeah, and you know, I just wanted to give a spire pour on the borders in Boca or Tone.
Yes, sir.
Looks like they only have maybe, first of all, bring your cash because they don't accept checks.
And there's a sun bank I had to go to the ATM because I actually quite a few for everybody just stocking this.
So bring your cash.
Okay.
They only have maybe 10 cassette slept of each and maybe three or four CDs.
And now we have a gigantic week there.
Yeah, it looks like they're, um, so if you want to, you better get there ASAP.
And the lady who helped me had no idea what I was talking about.
Yeah.
And the guy that just said, well, that may be good.
And I just wanted to see if I could suck around for tickets.
I'll turn around right now and come and get them if I could.
Okay.
Excellent. That'd be wonderful.
Are you shocked?
I am. I'm really shocked.
I'm in a way.
I just had a piece of this candy.
If I wouldn't have eaten the candy, I would say blow it out your ass.
But since I do, no, it's here.
First, I'm in a very good mood.
You know how candy affects the endorphins in your brain.
It's in dollars.
It like kind of comes down to your pleasure center of your brain.
I'm exiting the gym bike right now.
Okay.
Hang on.
All right.
Okay. You have that kind of directions.
And the parking pass, the yellow will prefer parking pass, which boils right by the escalator that doesn't work.
And they got that escalator fixed yet, by the way.
No.
Don't these people have any shame that operate that National Car Rectal Center?
Do they have any shame at all?
No.
Man, oh man.
Put on a chauffeur crisis for the tickets that you're gouging the public for the prices of those tickets.
Oh, and then Gildi says, well, you know, they got the Panther pack.
Yeah.
Yeah.
500 seats.
Okay.
For each game out of a 19,000 sum out seat arena.
500 seats.
If you're lucky enough to be able to get one of those and of course the rest of the poor bastards, they have any chance to get them.
No.
Of course not.
The tickets are like an armor.
You have to like mortgage the house to go to a game with your family.
And then of course, the overpriced food.
I mean, give us a break.
Will you please?
Wayne, you bald headed back to it.
Well, you know, if he's going to give all that money in charity, we've got to give it to him.
Yes.
There are up to 500.
Yeah.
And a lady left a sweater there.
A nice blue sweater.
So she's listening.
Oh, some lady left your blue sweater there at the QAM van.
So go back and get it.
That's probably, she probably left her name in the dress, a little calling card inside.
Maybe she does some extra work on a weekend.
She wanted to leave Chris a little message.
That's the old trick.
You know, leave like an article or clothing.
Leave something behind.
It always a good excuse to come back.
Oh, did I leave this here?
Oh, and by the way, Chris, you know what I'm saying?
Throw up to 500 bucks down there.
That the QAM van down by the public street block south of Cutler Ridge Mall.
On the east side of US one.
US one and Southwest one turn around 13th street.
Just look for the QAM van.
Chris will be inside.
And he's got the best in the LSDDs and the cassettes, the t-shirts.
And we got probably, do we still have mortgage free dolphin in the t-shirts?
Very much.
Why I'm sure we do.
I'm pretty sure.
I'm pretty sure we do.
So let's do over a thousand there today.
I mean, we had 400 bucks like that, like grease lightning, like Jewish lightning in a bottle.
And now all of a sudden it slowed down to a crawl.
This one we thought Cutler Ridge was going to go bananas today and they slowed right down.
Nine minutes past noon at 560 WQA.
WQA!
Go f**k yourself!
While spending the remainder of your golden years in the land of death.
The one thing you have to depend on is your car.
With two canoe theft on the rise.
The people who brought you a big black guy named Ben Karolarm.
Now bring you an old Jewish guy named Eisen.
Get a waste of my sport of a pail.
You baking M.F.
Remember when we used to post them back in Caribbean.
And we ought to get a bundle of finished meat.
And white ones are cooler.
Get a waste of my sport of a pail.
You baking M.F.
What the hell is that?
I object seriously.
For fattening like that.
I take somebody.
Get a waste of my sport of a pail.
You baking M.F.
Get a waste of my sport of a pail.
You baking M.F.
Whenever some fast tries to steer my car, I feel safer with an old Jewish guy named Eisen.
Get a waste of my sport of a pail.
You baking M.F.
Get your old Jewish guy named Eisen Karolarm now.
And receive a free flower antenna.
Get a waste. Get a waste. Get a waste from my sport of a pail.
You baking M.F.
And old Jewish guy named Eisen Karolarm.
I will be able to blow it all. There is joy.
Tough 14, tough 15, tough 15, tough 15, whichever one you like here at 5, 60, WQM.
This from the Palm Beach Post. Russian leaders appeal to Lewinsky to hold a rac attack.
Ooooo!
This is serious. This is for real from the AP.
Russian legislators agree through that consider a motion appealing to Monica Lewinsky to help halt the American attack on a rac.
The state Duma appeals to Miz Lewinsky to undertake corresponding measures to restrain the emotions of Bill Clinton,
said the motion by Nationalist Lawmaker Alexander Filetov. Filet show?
The motion was approved on a vote in the Duma.
The lower chamber of parliament to be considered for inclusion in the water resolution denouncing the attack of the rac attack.
The communist also mentioned Clinton and his relationship with the former White House intern.
Many people link it with Clinton's impeachment and his intimate relations with a certain person.
But if these relations develop into such active vandalism, then all you vice democracy is worth a penny.
Communist leader Gennady Zaganov told Duma debate on the Iraqi crisis.
Come on Monica. Just one more good blow job, sweetheart. Thanks for coming down.
Only this time, you know, a little better dress. Something like an evening gal with the ice cream.
A little more attractive, a little more classy.

Here's a coconut grove. Hello.
Nail. Yes, sir.
We got a Julio Stockman to University of Miami here.
All right.
You don't talk about it that place. Oh, Lordy.
Yeah. That school is horrible.
What is it? What school is it?
University of Miami, you know.
Oh, you have them. Oh, yeah.
I'm not talking about the football teams walking around. How you be doing?
A hurricane.
Yeah, that's what I hear.
Aside from that, uh, some hockey talking by me.
Yes. How do you feel about Mr. Devorek?
Are we going to expect it? How do I feel about him? I don't. He's a non factor.
Non factor. Non factor. He does nothing. He skates better. He's faster and he does nothing.
He doesn't finish. He's useless.
Yeah, I can't put the biscuit in the basket.
He can't put the biscuit in the tank. That's right.
He can't put the biscuit in the basket. That's right.
He can't put the biscuit in the basket. That's right.
Yeah, but we've got a few steps on there that I'm sure they'd like to hear.
Whatever he's one of them. Kirk Muller is another one.
And who's the third one? And of course, Garpentlaw.
Totally useless. I don't think he's even got a point this year.
And they got these guys under contract and they just have to keep paying the money out and pretending these guys are going to do something and they don't.
Well, why is it then that when they go to other teams that they just absolutely excel?
Well, who's that?
I mean, like race, race, race, race, race, shepherd, we've proven 50 goals score.
He had one bad year and they dumped him.
And of course, now he's having a big year for Carolina.
And as far as new Barnes and Marty Skaka, we already knew they were both good players and the same with Jason Wolley.
But for whatever reason, we like Chris Wells' haircut.
Can I chuck around for some tickets?
If we had some, I'd be happy to give them to.
Oh, well.
And have a great day.
Are you? You too.
The tip we had one pair, folks. Okay.
I mean, I realized we don't want to put you out.
We don't want to have too many calls around the board because if we do,
then we should be suspicious and know they're sucking around.
No more tickets. Okay.
And I've had a shocking too much sucking.
It puts the lotion in the basket or somewhere.

So the attack, the Iraq attack continues for the third day.
William Cohen was just on there going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like that.
William Cohen, how do I how could I suspect him a former Republican senator from Maine, a Republican who happens to be the secretary of defense?
Like this guy's going to put his integrity in his ass on the line.
And all of a sudden, Trent wants to know what I really meant was, uh, yeah, right.
We believe you.
You not see bastard.
You know, good piece of walking.
Extramed on legs.
580.
See there.
You go.
We go.
Sit up down there and cut the ridge.
Let's go. Let's get that thousand dollars down there and cut the ridge today and stop playing hard to get.
I thought we finally hit the mother load down there today where we had that big start and we had 15 cars lined up.
And it sounded like, hey, we finally hit the right joint.
And then as usual, it's closed down to a crawl public.
You understand where it is three blocks south of Cutler Ridge Mall, the QAM van.
That's where it's at with all our best and yield stuff.
580 bucks.
We need 420 more for nice thousand today.
Let's see, 580 puts us at one one almost at 102,000 just underneath.
We're getting close.
One open line and Broward all of a day.
Isn't this interesting?
I wish we had a photographer in here to take a picture of the phone bank.
As soon as I announced, we got that one lousy pair of hockey tickets in the parking pass.
Because we're fighting, we got the breaking news from Iraq.
We got the goddamn speech from the hearings going on here in the house.
We're fighting against a bunch of brainwashed people.
They're not paying attention to what I'm doing here today.
We got 40 people out there listening to this show today.
But boy, as soon as you got something to give away, wow, they all light up like a goddamn Hanukkah bushing heat man.
All of a sudden they're in love with me.
They're obsessed. They drop everything including their drawers.
Here's a mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Have you seen any new movies at the gate?
Yeah, how about you?
I go out.
Yeah, yeah.
They ain't there no more OK, pal.
So when you're standing online, I hate to break the news to you.

Here's a mobile in four-lotterdale.
Hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
OK.
Love you, chef.
I really just wanted to hear that whole bit, the Buffalo Bill bit.
Yeah.
But I told George that I wasn't calling the fuck around here.
Anything like that.
I just wanted to hear that bit.
And he said, and George insisted I talk to you so.
He said, what's that?
Yeah, my will probably hardly have any calls.
We got some dumb hooliol on here.
That's got to bug up his ass because his boyfriend left him.
I'll work on it, pal.
Maybe one more time before the day is out.
We'll play.

Here's a letter to the editor.
One good thing if there is to come out during the recent charade known as the Huck you this year at committee hearing on impeachment.
Is that the new face of the Republican Party is yadi yadi yadi.
Representative Bob Barr from Georgia in Tom Delay of Texas.
Have emerged as the new leaders.
Both of them were calling for the impeachment long before Monica Lewinsky and let it trip's names became household work.
That's right.
They already wanted them out of there.
Even if he wasn't getting blow jobs, how do you like that?
Excellent letter.
Who wrote that letter?
Charles Wei in the Lake Worth.
Wei, baby.
That's what he said.
Eat your curds and...
Okay.
In fact, there's not what we're doing.
We're bombing the curds in Wei.
Here's a mobile in Cutler Ridge.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
They said we're going to go over there and bomb the curds.
They said no way.
And we said, Wei.
Yes sir.
How you doing?
Okay.
I just wanted to report that I'm looking at this CD.
I just bought two CDs for them.
Thank you.
Yeah, but thank you.
This is a lot of crap on here.
There's a lot of great stuff.
I keep calling everybody that and they just sit there twiddling their phones.
Oh, it's on the first one.
There's 42 cuts.
I can't believe it.
Right.
And each and every one of them is an award winner, including Gonzer, Be Good and playing bagpipes.
The greatest stuff I've ever played on here in my life is on here.
And we've had a push and prod over there getting there now.
We're going to kick some ass.
This thing worth 20 bucks just for Gonzer Be Good, man.
Right.
I agree.
I agree with that wholeheartedly.
That's right.
But you have a great day, man.
Working you buy that much for 20 bucks.
That's right.
And have a great delay.
Thank you.

Yeah, we continue fighting these recalcitrant Julios out there who have to put on this big act for their boyfriends like they, you know, like I'm like I'm Maddacon Maddacon.
And the meantime, what the hell are they?
A bunch of Baharitos is what they are.
That's right.
Little Baharitos.
Is that redundant?
Here's a lady mobile in Miami.
Hello.
Hi, Neil.
Come and see these say redundant and that's fun.
Yes, man.
Hi, I'm a hula up porter.
And I just love you.
Great. There you go.
I hear you.
And I also want you out of the closet.
What is it?
I watch you all so every night.
Or you're the one that's watching that thing.
Well, watch fast.
Yeah.
But anyway, I just want to know that that's hula up in porcars.
We're not all that bad.
Okay.
Have a nice, sweetheart.
You too.
Police never died.
Thank you.

Boy, I'm going to tell you something.
I feel like I'm going to live at least another two, three minutes after reading that.
And by the way, don't buy anymore white chocolate, please.
And don't tell me you bought a sample pack.
I did.
I bought a whole bunch.
Yeah.
Of course, the good stuff.
We bring the wreck in here for.
What do you mean we ate it?
I had like four pieces from that.
I didn't say we is.
I didn't do.
I think that isn't that good anyway.
Hershey's chocolate is very pedestrian.
What?
Oh, that's blasphemy.
No, it is not.
Nestle makes better stuff than they do.
Who do you think makes smarties?
Nestle makes smarties.
For example, even though I'm OD done smarties, I can't eat them anymore.
But Nestle makes the munchies with almonds.
No.
You know what?
Hershey's with almonds, like the candy bar you're talking about?
They're like the nuggets that I had that you were eating the other day.
You know what nuggets?
No, no, seriously.
Hershey's candy is waxy.
Good candy is good chocolates are not waxy.
In fact, you can hear old Greg Budella talk ups on here.
They got waxy build up.
Six, sixty by the way.
No, no, seriously, I've stopped and think about it.
When you eat a Hershey's chocolate bar,
and I'm not saying I'm a horse to eating what's happening with you laying around,
especially with almonds.
But they're waxy.
I disagree.
It's not a question of whether you did.
Oh, here we go again.
The voice of reading this spoken he disagrees.
If it's like saying, uh, Pepsi is sweeter than Coke.
Oh, I disagree.
Okay, disagree, but it happens.
It's a fact.
It's not it.
That's something I just picked out of my ass, like a seed.
Jesus, man, you are brutal.
Every year Hershey wins all those awards.
I don't know.
Okay.
And so does, uh, what's his name?
So does Lyle.
I love it.
Okay.
He wins country music awards.
Can he sing?
Does he look like a human being?
He wins awards.
Big deal.
Yeah, in country music.
Socks.
Right.
And so they have a lot of those awards, too.
Does that mean that it's worth getting an award?
No.
Of course not.
Hershey's wins awards.
Hershey's is waxy.
Give me some, uh, real, some, uh, uh, a paragena.
Some of those dutch chocolates.
How about some of those great Belgian chocolates?
Now we're talking.
How about some paragena bachis?
Sounds good.
Here's, here's like a mobile in homestead.
Hello.
Hey, Neil, what's up?
Yes, sir.
Hey, listen about that study.
I guess we're going to have you for another 100 years, huh?
That's right.
We've got these numbers.
Storm, man.
But listen, um, I don't know if you interested in your care.
But there's furbies in that target and colorades.
Furbies in the target store in Cutlerade.
I'm going to be right now.
I just got two for my kids, you know, finally.
Thank you so much, Pat.
You got everybody.
They're going to be shooting each other.
You'll read about it over the weekend.
Oh, well.
Thanks for the good news.
Later.
Okay.
Here's a guy just got two furbies for his kids in the target
and cutlerade.
They're going to be marching on here.
Now we were raised in other dime because they're all going to Van Moose for more of our guys
are 660 bucks down there at Cutlerade so far today, not bad, not too shabby.
We'll make a thousand by two o'clock.
If it's the last goddamn thing we do, or else Chris will never take that vein down there again.
I don't want to threaten the people at Cutler Ridge.
But all we need is another 340 bucks.
That's 17 more CDs because that's T-shirts combination that they're out of piece of cake.
And that'll put us over 102 grand handling for the day.
And don't forget noon to 2 tomorrow at the borders and plantation on Weston Rise Boulevard.
Easy to get there.
Like I told you, just come Weston sunrise.
Just keep coming and you'll see it.
And the borders too.
1226 to 560 WQ went up.
Hi, this is Marie Fulwich wishing you a happy Hanna.
Jingle balls, jingle balls, man, what a rich.
Jingle balls, bird and jingle balls, bitch.
I got a dozen of mine behind.
They all have names and glass, they're mine.
Jingle balls come from a lack of hygiene.
Wait too much, cheerily, too many things.
Boyle and paper at my mother it was.
Gave me day the balls.
You can hot wax, you can't see them.
They really hurt just the same.
But when I have gas, just the next fly out.
A sense of saving in a big new place.
Never they passion, give them a night.
Water gas got flow.
I was a little late.
Try them maybe and kiss from the fire.
That's the Jingle ball.
That's the Jingle ball.
1232 to 560 WQ and the Hank Roberts show cut off

for all you people that are shopping for the holidays.
And we're ready to kill your neighbor if you don't get one for your pain in the ass.
kids target is right across from where we are with our RRQA and Vandidae. How do you like that?
We got 700 bucks with an hour and a half to go. 700 big ones, baby. Oh, look at this. They're showing
the bombings and they're showing exactly what they're wiping out over there. What? This is great.
Yeah, I love how the right guy is. Okay, watch real close and you can see he's got it in the cross
hairs. That's the strike. You can see that he was right in the center of his cross hairs. So
look at the fish and guidance that he has both on one day of craft and their code of three. Wow,
the me was able to do it. This is beauty. Good hit. So they're showing they a diaphragm
and diagram, but you notice on the chart, we still got a lot of work to do. Huh? Still missed the
several of those in fact, there's still a few of those terrorists over there. Still alive. But we're
working feverishly right now. We're bombing them into the stone age. Nice going. Here's a four-letter
dial. Hello. Yeah, can you play prison bitch? No. Open line of brow into a date. 5 6 7 0 5 60 and
pound 5 60 on the mobile one line. We played prison bitch yesterday. Sure. If you snooze, you lose.
That's all I can tell you. We got to let's come up again next year sometime. Here's little Havana. Hello.
Hey, on colonial. Yes, sir. What's going on, man? Hey, they're marching out of the closet.
Holy skeleton. Now, man. This guy I made it about a fooling around. And he admitted, yeah,
because Larry Flint's brought him out of the closet. Well, I'll leave you with
a poem because I'll leave you here. He admitted before he had to lie. You know what I'm saying? Uh-huh.
And I'm talking about that. Well, yeah, he admitted what he said that he had several affairs. We don't
know how many we don't know who they were with. We haven't put them under a cross examination yet. We're
not holding any hearings. We're not forcing them to put his hand on the Bible around his rectum.
So who the hell knows what he's telling us, you know? I wonder who's going to be the next with
Boston at me that it's a fact. Yeah, what then? Exactly. You know, Neil shameless request.
Yes. Uh, a couple of how to spell with Daniel. Okay. Thank you. I've even hurt you.
What's he saying? Well, I was that guy talking to learn to spell with Darnell.
This is learning to spell with Darnell. I've had Darnell, Jackson. And today we're going to spell
the word broken. Spellig with me now broken. The R.O.K.E.N. Now let's use it in the sentence.
So I says to the coach, I say, it's man. That broken show throw a football. This is learning to
spell with Darnell. I've been down here, Jackson. All right.
This is learning to spell with Darnell. I've been down here, Jackson. And today we're going to
spell the word I spell it with me now. I E Y E. Ed. Now let's use it in the sentence.
I'm so glad I still got me a job. This is learning to spell with Darnell. Yeah. And I'll be
down here, Jackson. So 35 to 560 WCN. I wouldn't be surprised if Bob Bar from Georgia was one of
those guys up in the woods. They're an entry. Wouldn't surprise me at all. I think that mustache is
covering it up. No, I don't think so. Two open lines in day five six seven oh five 60 pound five
60 on the mobile one line. What's that grand total? He was. Well, look at that. The 700 puts us
over 102 grand now. 102,000 and 75 dollars. And we're still going strong down there. We're
going to have a big day at plantation borders tomorrow. I guess we will. Here's a mobile
implantation. Hello. Yeah. Hi. How you doing? Neil. Okay. Well, Darnell, Jackson,
asking about that marine or something. That's a good bit, sir. Yeah. Well, anyway, I was
talking about the acquisition that's going on over there in the house. Yes. Oh my god,
the lynching. Yes. Oh Jesus Christ. And there's a good affection going on. He's in the
court close by. I say that is everything in evil is the Republican. Yeah. That's what the
definition of evil you're going to see next to the dictionary. You're going to see the old
old Republican bastards that I do in the dictionary. Right. Okay. God bless you, sir. And get
that passport clutch at real tight pal. And the we have an open line that's brought one of
the days five six seven oh five 60 and pound five 60 on the mobile one line.
So they're coming out of the closet. The Republicans have unmasked themselves.
All the facade has been taken off. Okay. They're showing their robes and their hoods.
In fact, that one guy's name was law hood. See that one of the first guys. He was
and he wasn't from the hood either. I guarantee you that. Too lily white to be from the hood.
Showing exactly where they're coming from is they goose step dutifully into line. And they,
you know, they'll confuse them with the fact they'll confuse them with what the American people
think is important these days or what else is going on in the world because they want to show that
the Constitution works right. Anybody believe that? No. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello.
Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I'll send your sales to the roof. Can I make a suggestion? Yeah.
Have you tried and I listen regularly, but I haven't heard this. I'm trying like 10, 15 seconds of
each bit so people can know exactly which ones are on there because for example, I was trying to
if you played like 20 seconds of each bit and then told where it was sold, I bet you a lot of people
would go get it because I was trying to find out, for example, the bridge tender. Yeah. Is the bridge
tender on there? No. So I know it's Neil's nuggets which you can get by calling center one or you'll
have it at our borders tomorrow. Neil's nuggets? Right. It's one of the old ones. It's got all the
old good stuff on it like the bridge tender. Okay. And then one again. Okay, I didn't know that.
And then one other question. Is that house? Is that the old Neil's nuggets? Old nugget thing.
Oh, Neil's old nugget, yeah. Right. What about, does I have that one bit? I know I remember with no
Phil Hendry when he was at the drive-through. Phil Hendry at the drive-through? You remember
when he was doing that thing at the drive-through and you couldn't understand what the hell he was saying?
It was the steric like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And that was a wrecking suds thing, that'll
feel Hendry's thing. That was a feel, okay, we'll say anyway, you have any Phil Hendry stuff on
the tip? No. Okay, then one last thing. Yeah. No price is money. Okay, what did he say? I have no
idea what he's talking about. Do you have any idea what he's... No. We have an open line. We do
have some Phil Hendry blow up dollars though. Therefore, you sure I think one could come in handy
in your case. We have an open line in Broward. Phil's kind of embarrassed about it. 5, 6, 7,
05, 60 and 05, 60 on the mobile one line. 21 till 1 at QAM. This is the Neil Roger show.
This is your brain. Any questions?
No. A day in the life of three Baptists. Hey, fellas, let's do something. I feel like doing something.
How's about we go shopping at the Kmart? That's a good idea. Let's wait a minute.
What? We can't. Oh, I know. Well, because Kmart's doing a promotion on that there Hercules movie.
Put out by his name. Oh, right. Me. I think I got it. What? Let's go see the lost world at your
classic dinosaur movie. Oh, that's a great idea. We can't. Why not? Because Jeff Goldblooms
in that and he used to date Laura Duhr. Oh, go there. Look, there's always a baseball game.
I like baseball. I do. Play the mother. What? We can't. Why not? Because the only game on
is the Yankee game. Yeah, so the soundbrinner didn't do nothing. Yeah, but they're playing the angels.
Disney. Well, hey, let's watch some TV and NBC's got third rock from the sun. NBC's are out. I would watch that.
We can't. Why? Because third rock stars John Licka who was in that butthloose movie with Kevin Bacon
who was in that Merrill Street movie, The River Wild and Merrill was in Silkwood with Sharon Kurt
Russell and Kurt was in the computer war tennis shoes. Hey, hey, look at here in the paper.
Luke Perry signed an autographed down at the record store. Wait a minute.
We can't. No. Luke was in the fifth element with Bruce Willis who was in that hard too with John
Amos from good time. So used to live next door to Calvin. Yeah, looks like it's deliverance again.
Well, that corner. Oh, it's sexual. 1245 and 550 WQM is that what's the netbady said that corn? Okay,
here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello there. Yes, sir. I just want to congratulate you whole
heartedly on your efforts with center one. Well, thank you wholeheartedly.
Someone should raise a statute to you. No, I don't want no statutes. I don't want no credit because
I learned a long time ago that when you're a miserable bastard that tells it like it is and you get
to newspapers and ask and expose them for being the phoneies that they are. They're not going to
give you credit for anything. So I'm content just to do a good job and get them all out cash and that's it.
I was on the road up by what is the coconut creek and I was driving by a wames monument.
The one that he erected to himself, the temple and the term pike, you know, that 55 or what is
100-foot-high garbage heap? Yeah, the 2000 support highway now. Exactly. That's just striking.
Even the even the aromas very similar. Let me ask you as far as the political process that we
have going on the charade. What do you suppose you think the Republicans are committing Harry
Kerry here? I think you don't have a democratic president for the next eight years, nine years.
I've said for the next 24 years, sounds reasonable to me and we're going to have democratic
overwhelming Congress in 19 and near 2000. Like actually Republicans have discovered their
own Y2K problem, baby. A big one. Exactly. I'm happy for it. Anyways, like they say,
when one door closes and the other one opens and Zagazan. Like the crucifers used to say, like one
little candle and stick it in your rectum. Okay, it's 13 to one. The big 13 and the big one here
on this amazing Friday. Boy, I tell you we're getting real close close to the end of this year.
Close to our one year anniversary here on WQAN. Wow. Close to moving upstairs on the third floor.
Anybody believe in that? No. I hear the Power 96 studios by the way are luxurious and beautiful.
George was told me this morning that they're amazing astonishing, especially for a cheap
past outfit like this place. So that's a real good start, but at the meantime, when you know,
here's Miami. Hello. Okay, sir. I gotta tell you, I'm a Republican, but I do not know where
they're headed. I'm telling you, I got to find a new new new girl. They're headed right over the
edge of that infamous cliff that everybody's always talking about. They're headed all together.
They've joined foot and locked step and they've joined arms. They're all going over together.
And these guys are out of control. The second thing is I was looking at various countries around
Europe who either support or don't support this. You know, Italy doesn't support the strike.
Well, they're kind of like in between. I said it's a useless, useless endeavor, but that's the day.
Wait till tomorrow. I'll be careful when they go over there next time. Yeah. And if you could do
one more thing for me. Yes. You could play the WQAM broadcast school. So you don't have to worry
about what the Italian government says because in a week, it'll be a different bunch of guys.
Anyone have a great day. Be careful. WQAM school of what? What is that under? George WQAM.
What's under W. Oh, WQAM is proud to bring you the WQAM school of broad guests. Yes,
you too can have an illustrious career in the wonderful world of radio. If you follow our
curriculum, the course is free. Of course you'll work for free. Go a 1-800-WON-A-BEAD,
and speak to our director of education, Mr. Lenny Marjez. So you want me a broadcast now?
Oh, a watch? A broadcast now. A broadcast now. Yes.
So George WQAM. Well, can you say, George?
George WQAM. George WQAM.
Okay. No, I'm not George WQAM.
George WQAM. How take you on a tour? You need now.

Right, I mean it's ridiculous
Okay

It's like maybe that's one good lesson that people are getting out of they take a look at all these
Representatives in the house at least most of the people in the Senate
Most of them, you know, they carry a certain aura a certain something about them
But these house members thank God that they get to vote them out every two years because most of them are a bunch of shleppers a bunch of
Shlameals a bunch of schmendrix. Oh

They said the Iraqi are in the military. They're just sitting back and taking it. They haven't flown one plane

Totally when I first came here 12 months ago. I told you this was the problem
Too many one-dimensional people out there in the audience who know from nothing else except
Ron ball and football and baseball they don't that that's it. That's all I know

Because I have to a chillish summer night. I like to snuggle up in bed with a hot dick inside
Okay, that was Bob from a dick insider T-shirt fame. We've got great T-shirts since college a little on the young he means well
It's five minutes after after one at five sixty WQM. Here's a lady in Miramar. Hello
Yes, I was calling about
the impeachment
And what I was I was when I was listening to it they were talking about I'm not Republican myself here
And I'm not really Democrat. I was an independent
So I didn't vote for Bill Clinton
But what they had brought up here point was why don't they leave it to the American people to go ahead and do vote
Which they would do vote on what well to either go ahead and have me and peach because that's we don't have that former government
We don't have government by plebiscite. We don't have both
I realize this here, but but they could go ahead
They could be a center. Yes, oh they have all they can do that
Yeah, they repubble the excuse is even though there have been four cases in American history where presidents have been censored by the Congress
They've made up this baloney about well
It's unconstitutional and there's no specific provision for it and as many of the Democrats have pointed out
There are lots of things that Congress does a lot of acts that they draft that had that there's no specific provision for the Constitution
But it's not prohibited by the Constitution. They could do whatever they want if they want a censure just like they censored new
English they can certainly do that to the president but the excuses oh no
We have to proceed with impeachment because that's the only remedy that we're out to do
It's another lie. It's just another
Thomas makes the Republicans look like they are afraid. What do you mean almost?
I mean it does make them look like they're afraid. This is their last guess
Don't you understand? They just saw this last election. They see the polls
They see that I'm not how much dirt they try to throw here that the public sees you what they don't care about is
Sexual Peccary de los they do not care
I'm just with all the money that's been spent on this when we have so many other problems in this nation here
I would take it and I'd be putting this I don't even split it with you. Well, I'll tell you. Oh, I love to split it
Right right down the middle but anyway, I was just wondering if there was a way that people could either contact somebody
Whatever to go ahead and say put it up to the American people. Are they afraid? No, not gonna happen. Oh
No, I know because they're in power. But I'll tell you what?
They'll sure and help get out of power
That's right. They why too keep up when they're doing this here. They're doing nothing but throwing the American people again
Amen have a great holiday. Okay. Just say no to the fascist. Okay. That's that's what Nancy Reagan said just say no to those fascists like Bob bar

But that makes me a believer.
And then I have in tongues.
And then I have in tongues.
And then I have in tongues.
And then I have in tongues.
And then I have in tongues.
And then I have in tongues.
Great folks, why another award?
But it's a ten-star number.
It's 115 to 560 W.
The fact that Jim is a matter of fact, Joe Kennedy is up there, speaking not from Massachusetts,
who says if anybody's family knows about school and around.
We got the feet.
And he said right there at the end, he said just before he finished and was started talking about food stamps for the Kennedies.
He said, hey, if things should happen,
and the president should, then, wind up being forced to resign,
or being convicted and et cetera and so on.
Then, Elgro becomes president.
I say, Bokabrine provides president.
Joe Kennedy just said.
Our school,
here's a candle. Hello.
Nail.
Yes sir.
How you doing?
Great.
Question for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is that your first or is that my first or fifth?
This one is not going to be the worst.
I agree with you in that as long as you're a good person, a more
like you a spirit.
You know harm, it's very simple.
That's all you need to know.
Anything beyond that is complicated life.
I agree with you there, but let me say this in return.
I agree with you.
I agree with you in it.
If you're a good person, I don't care where religion is.
You're a Buddhist, whatever if there's a supreme.
You'll be safe.
Fine.
Who cares.
There is no supreme being.
Okay, but let's there's only oh god. That's as close as it gets to supreme being me. Oh, let me say this
There's Diana Ross that they supreme big
Most people you don't have a problem with the smoke and we need to do I or doing things whatever they want to do
I need to do with religion
Well, my point is is if it makes them feel good, why not just leave them alone? I'm on your side
But why not leave them alone if it for one percent helps one person and make some feel good who cares?
Let if it makes them feel good what makes them feel it's not if it's not what are you talking about?
Okay, if they have a belief system and they annoyed me or they annoy you
Okay, so wait wait wait wait, who's taking it away from them? I don't care
I'm just expressing my opinion that's all if they were the only difference being if they want to use it as a weapon
Against other people then I got a real problem with it
Okay, that's okay. They want to use it to spread their bigotry and narrow minds as an intolerance
Yeah, if that makes them feel good too bad I agree with you that is a problem
But the problem is not people who believe it and and in addition to which in America
We don't have very many of those people who just practice their own superstitions
Most people who are read the more the religious they claim to be in this country the more intolerant they are and the more hatred they spread
So what you're saying is if somebody were superstitious and had a belief as long as it in bother the people who be all right with you of course
Okay, I know that I didn't like like most of my experiences in Europe
I don't find religious fanaticism too much of it over there except in Northern Ireland
I've never been here and I wouldn't go so you really don't believe religion and a whole is
Completely horrible as long as you're not a fanatic and bother other people
And as long as you're not being pleased of money by a bunch of charlatans and fakers, which is happening all the time
Right as long as you keep it to yourself and as long as it doesn't cost you any money when it starts costing you money
Then you know you're being ripped off that's a problem
But as long as you don't bother other people you keep it to yourself. That's fine. Right happy
You're so much like smoking weed. Yeah happy fine. Uh-huh, but you know, I agree with you
I just don't agree with you when you're putting down something that like what you know men can corrupt anything
I agree with you mental corrupt anything business whatever endeavor they put their hand on they're gonna
They're gonna screw up. What does that mean? Well, what I'm saying is you know, don't blame
Are you saying are you saying that all those people are died in the Spanish in position in the crusades that was
Always mans fault
No, man didn't invent what are you some kind of a heathen the atheist bastard?
Huh? How's wrong with you man?
Don't you remember God handed those five tablets to Abraham Solomon not the Moses that was Abraham Solomon and he said oh
He's gonna believe this crap
He's well why not give it a shot. That's what he said. I mean if God was Jewish
I mean what's all this other agoris or stuff about anyway?
See that's where they're going made their worst mistake is they accepted the Jewish God you got to invent your own God now
Jesus he's you know part of the mishpah but you have to have your own God
If you're not strong enough to invent your own guy at least the the Buddhists
Huh all these other oh
Those are culture yeah right
Why don't you get me started on this crap?
Okay, in fact look at those the Iranians over there. Do you hear Iraqis rather same difference?
You're all at wailing going on when they start with that prayer crap early in the morning
They got Kristia. I'm on poor stand over there the bombs are bursting in her in the background. They're going
Like that
Just like the Orthodox Jews there the wailing wall
Yeah, great
Pretty embarrassing okay very embarrassing behavior just like we're watching right now in the house in the United States
Embarrassing behavior by a bunch of hypocritical phony baloney people who say don't do as I say and don't do as I do whatever
However that goes
Who just mouth a lot of bull crap even though they don't believe it themselves even though there are a bunch of compulsive liars
Even though they're most of them a bunch of
Hormongers
All of a sudden they're sanctimonies. I totally this month ago sanctimonious typical goody tussues the people in the Congress the people in the media
Most people in America because they can't face up to the fact that people are hornied like screwing around and it's nobody's got them business
Here's the Margate hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, with what Trent Lott said yesterday about no compromise if the Democrats had any balls
They would stand up as a block of 45 and force a censure and how can they do that?
It'd be very easy if if if if if at least three four Democrats say right off the bat that they would vote not guilty that forces a censure
It would be very easy to end this whole thing if they would just stand together
At any time they just this trial can end at any time
It's all we don't have a trial yet. No, no, but I mean before the trial when they wonder doing motions and so forth motions for this motion
So that yeah, all they got to do is tend to the block and say we will not find this guy guilty and then they would force
That's not how it works. I mean, I don't know all the parliamentary maneuvers and procedures, but that's not gonna happen
You're gonna see that with you. It's gonna take about three months
We'll try to get on the way because it's gonna be a lot of motions back and forth. Yeah, this will be easy to end
I was what started all those too many motions back and forth. Okay
We have an open line and day one and Broward five six seven oh five sixty. That's right
It wasn't the apple on the tree. It was the pair on the ground. Maybe it starts all the problems
It was the bitch underneath
Here's South Miami. Hello
How come we don't impeach Monica Lewinsky a South Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh Lord father
Hey, I was gonna make a quick phone call to you, but man. Oh god. Yeah, I've been holding for a long time

The first time I listen to you just room and listening is that when the person go for first started out back in the 9 early 90s
91. Yeah. Yeah, I was listening to you while I was working it back
And I said my god is just a long time now. I know seems like only yesterday. We were doing the same crap
I know what I call to say is remember the Republican who says read my lips. Yeah, no new taxes
He didn't lie to the public did he and on national TV right?
Well Lord God I have to go back to work and God bless you. You're served to see you. Okay, bye-bye
Okay, we have an open line see I like a lot more guys like him. I'm subservient and obedient
Open line in the day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T wireless wine. How about those hockey tickets by the way?

Yeah, if I held the mail and just had to play and
Listen, um, I don't usually talk about politics
But yesterday what I heard about this Livingston guy admitting to his affairs. Our first plural. That's right
We don't know how many yet. We don't know but he says several like a 20 or 30 40 50 100 200
He screwed everything with a screw down and you see the Pope you see the
Oh the Pope too. Mm-hmm see the picture of him on TV that they show with that weird grin on his face
Yeah, but you know when he when he announced that he did have these affairs
He started off
Using the lines from the Gettysburg address four scores seven years ago. All right, four. He scored four times
I'm just so outraged. I think they're all a bunch of hypocrites. I never knew what the word here
We got Henry hide up there the two leader the the ring leader up there this morning
We got their new speaker designated the house Bob Livingston from Louisiana was screwing everything with a dress on
We got Dan coach from Indiana who fathered an illegitimate child tried to cover that up
We got Mary Bono who's been screwing around with everything with a penis attached to it
And these people are up there passing judgment because the president likes getting the rocks off every
I won't fast up to it every Republican they bring forward has got some kind of dirt all over right?
That's right you can smell it when it was in fact
This is the first time we ever had smell of vision when they come on a screen. You the stench of it comes right through your
TV set unbelievable they ought to get
Ken starts to investigate this guy with an independent council and ask him real personal questions about all his a
No, and all we ought to do is investigate Ken star. That's what we have to do. He's find out how many blow up dolls. He's gotten the closet
Got only knows what he's been right exactly. I don't want to be surprised if he likes to dress up like J. Edgar Hoover
Well, his face is like a cabbage patch. I don't know what
He looks to me. He looks like a cabbage that style. He should be hit with the baseball that okay
Well, we're gonna grab a great like okay. Let's get Jota Mascio out of the hospital one last time if anybody's got good aim
Jota Mascio. Let's see if Joe's got enough strength to hit Ken star just one time come on Joe. I like a shot
He still hasn't lost it
Anyway, it's 125 at QM. We got Hank standing by. He'll be along at two o'clock

Um, my first question is um, can I be in love with you even though I'm a heterosexual? No, thanks. No thanks only at the foot of my altar
Oh god, yes
Next question. Okay. Thanks question is that you notice I got it called earlier who said he had just finished buying your
CDs or cassettes right and then he said oh can I get a request and a request that's something that was on those the city
CD or well, he was more fun here and over the radio I guess I bet
Maybe you can't afford a CD player yet. Yeah, maybe he's driving on
441 and he can't hear the signal call be it right so
I know we're doing pretty damn well considering there most of the time you can't hear the damn station. We're doing pretty good
That is beautiful. I like the other fuzz. It sounds great. Yeah, it's right in the other thing is
I always hear you call black people schwarzers. Yeah, and I was wondering we used to always call them regens
And I was wondering if you'd ever find a liking to that call black people one regens what's all is that?
Well, let's call it backwards
Regens
On that other that was supposed to be clever that was like niggers backward design
That was very cute sir that was brilliant. You went through all of that strong events to get to that. That was very cute
Okay, we have an open line in date five six seven oh five sixty
Palm five sixty. What can we say about that guy? He's an asshole
Here's Bokobryne by the way who came into the special just so we can meet up with his number one fan
Who called it before he said how the day greetings to my close personal friend Bokobryne is the best in the world
Is that what the guy said before no
Guys just jealous. Okay, he wishes he had all that here
So what was this guy saying about something about oh nigger toes by the way, have you ever heard that expression nigger toes?
No, it's a certain kind of nut
What kind of nuts is that referred to?
They call them nigger toes nuts, but the Brazil nuts. I might be it
Have you ever used that expression nigger toes?
Anyway, why is that why does everybody look at me like I just made that up there. There's such a thing not past the age of 10
Oh, but yes little kid do that. Well, there you go little kids call those dark nuts
Here's a plantation hello
Okay, sir
Did you happen to hear about the comment that Alex Baldwin made about about Henry hide
Somebody said yesterday, but my all time I can be all time
The fact that he should be sent back overseas like to israel is somewhere where he would be stoned and he should die
And then he got all kinds of negative flat from people. Yeah, why is that?
That's what I was wondering all the Israelis don't want to me. I'd Jewish him. I know his glaciers. They come
Well, the comment maybe Syria would be good. Well, he wished maybe France would be good. He'd fit in like a rubber glove there
Well, you know the thing is that he's wishing Henry hide what he deserved. Yeah, and he's being criticized for it
Well, I say Alex Baldwin for Emperor. Oh, I say we have an open line in Broward five six seven oh five
You know when you're a sanctimonious hypocrite
I mean if you're a pervert you like wave the flag like I do hey pervert here, and I'm proud of it proud pervert pp
Proud of the pp proud pervert even if it is small
But when you start like with this holier than now and oh my god
He lied to the public and he prayed lied to his cabinet. They purged about what?
About what about getting blow jobs
You take that out of the equation you take the blue dress with a stain on it and you have nothing you have
55 million dollars of taxpayer money flushed right down the turlid is what you've got
Nothing zippity doodah and isn't it what an amazing coincidence
That's just suddenly there was some new smoking gun or some new smoking penis that they discovered that all these so-called
Moderates and all these wavering were public and all of a sudden came to the same conclusion like we just found some damaging smoking
Remember or something was there any such thing? No, but just overnight
One by one they fell into line they goose stepped right into line there
As though somebody were pulling the strings like they were like little puppets marry that tiny end of that string
I think we better get look a bratsy on a goddamn phone
Here's Davie hello
Uncle Neil yes, sir
You know slick will he screw it up just because he lied it almost doesn't matter you know what it was about
But like like Bush said no new taxes and even lying the and gingrich didn't lie under oath by the way
Yeah, it's to the grand juror. I mean, you know, it is a higher level now
You're smart doesn't make you're smart enough to know that and what there is to make is that an impeachable offense?
I'm smart enough to know that uh
Is that an offense against the government? Is that does that endanger the government of this country?
There's a lot about his sexual pecker dillows
I think people were just like this guy for a while and this is this is where he's screwed up
I mean, it's definitely gonna be
whether he's a
thrown out of office or not
It's just not gonna look good for him just by being in peace. You know, I you know
What does that mean? It's not gonna look good for him. What does that mean?
Well because you know he walks around on television everything like he's the king of United States of America
Does he really basically?
When did he do that?
It looks to me like he's aged about 20 years in the last 10 or 12 months based the last time I saw him as in yesterday
Looks to me like he's aging very ungracefully by the way and under tremendous stress and arrest and the meantime
He was over there in Israel like he promised them with the gaza
Doing this thing to try to salvage that middle east piecing and he you know
He's doing this thing over there bombing them into the stone age and doing every day what he's supposed to be doing
Which was what he was elected to do
See guys like this they don't confuse them with the facts
Okay, because this guy gets sucked into all this rhetoric. Oh, he lied under oath
When you know something so what like Henry Hyde this morning said the so what defense
And that's what the majority of people would tell you so what we don't care and they can't stand that the Republicans can't deal with that
so what
Did he lie about anything then anything to do with the operation of the United States government?
No absolutely not
He did what any other rational person especially a person in a position of prominence would do
I mean for crying out loud the goddamn president
He you know was hoping that somebody had a brain
That some dumb bitch had a goddamn brain and wouldn't start yapping on a goddamn phone with illegal
Illegally be courted phone conversation which we're not supposed to be concerned about that about the illegalities
There would lend a trip we're not supposed to be concerned about the illegalities with the leaks from candid star
Or the illegal contacts with Paula Jones lawyers. We just washed all of that in the background
And talk about this brilliant referral from judge star who we know never stole a freight train and that's the best we can say for him
Because we know for certain that he was nonpartisan. Oh yeah
22 before 2 at 560 WQM
Straight lady
Somehow don't still cry better ask for
That's not...
That's not so good, that's it!
I see that's not so good!
Oh!
I see that's not so good!
I see that's not so good!
This is the organic vulcan body genius of here, for what it is.
And this is what a genius is, by the way.
What money brings in today, boys and girls?
A little scratchy, and a bunch of clues.
A lot of car, you listen to this disgusting old Jeffy Fish, not you, Sight Cow.
Work, work.
These beasts I've got for all bones.
Looking out of that, it's your trump.
You look at Monica, he says.
You hear that?
That's racist.
This is a bunch of hooties.
I love it.
Okay, mix riders, these dry eels, better lights than ever.
Devil with a blue dress on.
That's what it's all about.
Here's that Bill McCullum from Florida.
How do you do with glasses?
Okay, real asshole.
You know what they say about him, don't you?
He's an asshole.
That's right.
Yeah, he has him out of here.
Makes me go one of vomit.
Devil with a blue dress on, with a stained dress on.
That's what America.
And that's why the rest of the world is looking at us like laughing and scratching their head and their ass wondering what the hell is going on over here.
It's not going to look very good though, I'm as wrecked.
I'm as résumé.
That guy was a genius, and it's almost full.
Kill it.
Okay, where are we going?
Here's the North Miami B.
Chilli.
Hello?
Yes, ma'am.
I just tuned on your radio a while ago.
I heard you mention Mickey Rock.
I...
Okay, we have an open line in date.
567-0560-Pomph.
I wonder how long it would take to get her out of the closet, you know?
Is that pathetic or is that pathetic, huh?
Jesus Christ.
I've got a lot of friends there on the police force here that in confidentiality have told me how much of an asshole prints it.
Which is probably why I changed his name.
Here's a mobile.
Hello?
In somewhere.
What is it?
On the water he didn't tell you where he was because he's too stupid to figure it out.
Okay, an open line in date.
567-0560-Pomph.
60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Here's Fort Lauderdale.
Hello?
Man, which was that bitch that keeps calling about Mickey Rourke, huh?
Oh, no, she's got her blow up dollar, she's blowing it.
Negative on the life scale, ma'am.
Yeah.
I guess they can remember us.
I guess they can remember this as a nitpick in 90s where we just nitpicked about everything that everybody's lied.
I'm not saying it's a lot healthier to knowspicks than it is to nitpick as long as you got your nails trimmed.
I reckon so, oh, yeah, under.
Right.
But, you know, how do you like this Bill McCollum, man?
I'm embarrassed that he's still here.
I don't like it at all.
You know?
But we have got our party.
I'm going to be screwed up here.
Yeah.
There's many more important things that we should be concentrating on.
I wonder how many dresses he stained in his pathetic existence.
We have a big game on Monday night here.
Right, that's right.
And we didn't think about things around.
That's right.
You got your goddamn gator meet too, so go beat it.
We have an open line in date, 5.6705, 61 and Broward, and the pound 5.60 on the AT&T wireless line.
Wait till after two o'clock, okay?
No more sports nerds till after two.
Here's Coral Springs.
Hello.
Hello, I'm Danielle.
Yes, sir.
How you doing today?
Okay.
I just want to say I picked up both your CDs if I wanted to, and then pull text left.
Thank you.
Especially if I want.
Especially.
And I like to say there's only way you can get on stuff bombing I rack today.
Anyway, you can get that off.
Okay, you got it.
Thank you.
In fact, I'm, thanks for reminding me as a matter of fact.
Thanks.
Okay.
They're doing it right now, by the way.
They're dropping a lot of bomba.
They're dropping a big one.
Anybody have to ever drop a big one.
Oh!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I rack, I rack.
We've not moved.
It should take a day.
Let's just put a map to it.
I rack, I rack.
I want to wake up and see their cities don't exist.
Put in thin air and tell that Saddam Hussein.
We're really pissed.
You're under my skin.
That little piece of shit.
They get away.
I'll get them off to make their hips.
One more.
Who's yours?
The sun has set to go off that now.
We all know we've tried to bomb.
I rack, I rack.
I rack, I rack.
I want to wake up and see their cities.
They're all going to fit.
I'm going to be.
And say that win number one.
Stop for the heat.
Oh!
We can't beat.
Again we have won.
Stop bombing I rack.
Why not stop today?
Let's make a parking lot of this.
Oh!
That old virus.
Okay.
When all the boys are there, I'll do a show.
With that chick's hair and say goodbye.
I rack, I rack.
I rack.
Total seven heads.
Bang bang, you're dead.
Ouch.
Okay, 150 at 56.
I think you never know what that damn thing is over.
It puts the lotion in the bag.
I think you're going to be.
I think you're going to be.
I think you're going to be.
I think you're going to be.
I think you're going to be.
I think you're going to be.
