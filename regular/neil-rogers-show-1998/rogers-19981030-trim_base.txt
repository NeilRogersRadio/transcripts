Open line and grow it all this is a tremendous response after what I just read there this is just
Sint-Lady
Two bozos back to back

It was a mobile in Miami. The violent crunchy was I accused of a violent crime blow it out to you ads
Oh, this is unbelievable. This is exactly the men counting were dealing with it
Like I said, it's not these guys fault
It's the fan because Del supported they don't give a crap what these guys do as long as we win as long as they run fast
And jump high just like Brian blades, baby. He don't have time to talk to you guys
He's got a glove and a Seattle in play that's what the Rosin house said
Give me a frickin break, okay
Go talk to Pee Wee Herman and blow it out your ass
Here's a lady mobile in Del Rey Beach. Hello. I feel like doing okay, man. Hey, you know what you are completely right
Yeah, three more on back to back to back. Yeah
So don't you understand cuz I'm not in the hero
Don't you want to sense what I'm in to we don't want to hear about all the criminals on there
There's a lot of the college football teams. I know you're this for all these other dumb gots
I agree I'm I'm a I've been turned on to you for six months
And I've been transferred on my girlfriends and everything else on to you
What's 100% of what you say and even with the old day situation?
Okay, we go to kill and get off what do we do? We're still waiting and look at that boys
And then he was evading a red
We had all these assholes running around there with signs on the LA freeway
We are talking about a bunch of idiots you got that right here. You got that right and my thing is I think it's time to boycott football
I spoke all widows. We see him sitting there on the TV and I heard me say I'm gonna beer and watch
And I'm going go go go
They would have been a stressor. What's going on?
I'm not at home. Maybe they won't watch them anymore. All right and game two. Yeah, I wouldn't send them my
I don't see them. I wouldn't my phone wanted by a jersey from
I think there's a dolphin from my friend. I said I won't see a dolphin jersey on your back son and you know, hey
But that's how my feelings are okay. I have a
Yeah, get on here two open lines of power five six seven open line. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello
Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, you're absolutely right. I used to play football and they don't cheer
As long as you can run fast somebody
Love you. Yeah, that's all they care about they don't care about nothing else
You can kill somebody and they'll get you off of it and you know
I'm sure that there's some of these golf fans out there thinking but you know
Shula didn't win anything in a long time
I mean two years ago, but Shula at least was a didn't put up a discraft
But Jimmy Johnson, hey, we're five and two. Summoning care. What Jimmy does that's a
Point for he's got to look good. So he's gonna do whatever he can to make himself look good
Well, thank you
Training at you of em and it's Dallas too. Okay, I'll continue. Okay. Thank God that Michael Irvings
Another one of the many guys that Jimmy can take credit for
We have an open line of date fine. Oh, you can't say these things are made. Yeah, right in London
I said before how come the sports segments on this radio station? How come they're not the ones talking about this book and interviewing these authors
Because the several pages I read there is terminal on his boring as it may have been to some people
Never life that was all about stuff going right here in his house. Oh, it was a release
Editors know to be in a chapter. I read Marina will not be handing off the thoughts and goes on about how Jimmy
Johnson has a number of talented running back to replace him and began fumbling the ball and training camp
John, John to explain the reporters his decision to release for what's that?
What would they do with the troubled athletes most recent verse for the law and
Police and it says the book goes to press police
I still investigate any allegations that he assaulted a woman in Miami-Nightclub in June and here it is
The end of October we heard any more about that. No, I haven't heard the final disposition of that. No, but ever hear any more about that. No
Lauren still it's one of the real scumbags in the history of the human race
Stuck as girlfriend and the goddamn stand up post post office box there in Lincoln, Nebraska
Beath and after beating the crap out of her
But hey, you know with these guys got to have anger management courses. They got to have yet they came out of the ghetto
Yeah, right tell Nicole Brown that too. Okay, that OJ came out of the ghetto and tell Ron Golden and his family while you're at it
Always got excuses for abhorrent unacceptable violence behavior. Don't we?
Here's Miami. Hello
Go to the criminal's and yeah, okay
Here's a mobile in always like those guys who got the favor to her
That's always impressive to me a tin can over the phone mobile in North Lauderdale. Hello. How you doing? Meal? Okay, sir
Listen, I gotta respond to this. It sounds like you're making a big deal out of something that's been going on forever
There's there's what you're talking about right now
It's not nothing making a big deal. What happened? Nothing new to anything you were saying
It's been going on in sports beginning of time. Yeah, and
Some other people shouldn't be talking about it. No, no, no
You're right about bringing it to the public attention
But I what I think is what's going on here and what's dragging it out so much is that the proliferation of media and the ability for media
It just ceases and blown out on all over the airway and makes such a big flux out of men
Who fly on the way that they're almost controlling what's going on now is that it's become so sensational that the big picture
Is then completely blown away that these are people from underprivileged areas. Oh
How
It's very until that's around you know that
I don't I didn't I tend to that I told George that as soon as I finished reading
Linda the break and I said the response is gonna be from assholes like T. Sir
I'll listen to anybody say almost any opinion but that I will not listen to I don't care what area you come from
That's not an excuse for violent behavior against other people. It's not an excuse for murder
It's not an excuse for assault. It's not an excuse for treating women like Dubh human garbage
It's not an excuse. I'm sick and tired of hearing that whether you're black whether you're white
I'm not interested in the area whether it's body counts whether it's God
They were in spite mother's Mark Fitzpatrick. I don't want to hear about it
Mark Fitzpatrick didn't cover my god damn underprivileged's neighborhood neither did Bobby Cox
Jesus Joseph what a sad sad sad and you know the interesting part is it points out in this book
See now you understand where he was coming from in the beginning well the media is blowing this all up
No, the media automate blowing it up. That's why this book is so goddamn great
Paying millions of dollars to the lowest scumbags on a facetif just like Mike Tyson
There's a classic example see the boxing fans in his country
They don't give a crap what Mike's in how I said it how many people he raped how many years he chews off
How aberrant his behavior is they want to pay to see him fight some stumbled on me yet because for whatever reason
Go to them that's exciting
So don't confuse them with the facts
But this horsecraft and in addition to which these are the guys these are the select few guys who've been taken out of the
My out of the ghettos and give any opportunity to make millions of dollars
80% of the players in the NBA are black
What would most of those guys be doing if they were playing basketball and making millions and millions of dollars?
What would they be doing?
So when somebody gives you the opportunity to make millions of dollars and be a big hero and a big celebrity
And then you turn around and continue being a scumbag something's wrong there somewhere right Mark Dupur
I mean you could go down a list you've got a list as long as your arm and your leg put together
And this guy's trying to make it sure I got and I'm in all my life
I've been a liberal but you know something when it comes to this that's why I draw the line
I'm not interested in the labels let it comes to the death penalty triumph
When it comes to scumbags who have no respect for other people
Put them away and throw away the goddamn key
And I knew that this would be the way I told you that right during the break. I said you wait and see
Oh, they were underprivileged they came from the ghetto. They grew up in these gangs
But you know something they were given a chance to get out
How many chances did they get it's like how many beers does it take to enjoy sporting event here?
How many chances do they have to get before we finally say well, you know
Thank God Lawrence Taylor got off drugs. I'm sorry purgatory
Here's a Hollywood hello
No, yes, sir
For asked about this and I might lose your Georgia comments while we're on Harvard. Yes, okay
Onus understood and served you to call okay. I was just sure it yes
It's like a history of this country going back to Thai top where he beat a cripple person in the stand
Oh, they really and can kill the porter supposed ring
He went over a bridge. Oh, right. Yeah, so they've used to protect their sports heroes. Uh-huh
It's you know, I think already well. Where did you read that bus? My cobs?
There is articles
I've parents retired to a town in northeast Georgia where he's with right and they still can't stand them because there's a real S.O.B
and
I don't think he cares at this point. You don't send them to the next difference now
But it's just like gone constantly or for fear of like you and I did
I've got stuff
You can jail for a way to keep I mean when you're talking about violent crimes
Whether you're talking about killing people beating the crap out of women and other people and maybe shooting people
I mean, we're we're not talking about their little diddling stuff
We're not talking about people smoking a little weed or whatever a little are we're talking about violent crime is what we're talking about in a
Grotesquely violent society and these people are supposed to be role models and they're put up on pedestals
Hey, we worship you. Can we have your autograph great?
And it's not the attitude like you grew up in the ghetto there are plenty of people that grew up in the ghetto yet
They're not killing people right and come out and they're also not making millions of dollars a year
So what what see society if we are any brain we shouldn't be asking a where did you grow up?
We just expect you to conform to certain just minimal things
We expect you to conform to and if you can't do that then let's put you in a cage somewhere
And up a great day
And they can win some games then he doesn't care what they do really exactly. I say put him all in jail. All right
Now congratulations see there you go
There's fun. I mean if everybody who grew up in a ghetto was like the like OJ if everybody was murdering everybody
It's totally out of control and beaten women all over the guy there
And please then we have anarchy
Because you got millions of people who grew up in a guy named Getto
Well, but it's an excuse not for me. It's not
Here's a lady mobile in North Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Oh my arms sound like you
Okay, you're a twin sister. Oh, no, I don't have one of those I've been listening to you since 1987 and today
You finally got me out of the closet. Oh my god. Wow. I totally agree with you
I
Think that we set these men up and the kids right away
Them and that's the strong in society and that's all I have to say. Thank you. Thanks
Very simple just like the V&H first is not complicated
You don't teach your kids to admire scumbags. That's all we're not talking about scumbags. I'm talking violence criminals
And I hear all this discussion oh
How come this one can't throw a pancake block and outcome this one got a spin or the other one back to help them out
But don't get used this with the facts because either we got you know a bet on the game
Which I do understand that or you know, we want to feel better about ourselves
It would be like just like my going to that panther game there but I wasn't at this graceful display
Am I gonna come in here the next day and say and start playing that stupid?
Next time we'll be okay
I'm gonna do that. I need to suck the actor tell
Guys making millions of dollars go on to the motions putting out a future performance quite frankly boring me to tears
Yeah, I still save you they're killing the geese to lay the big ones baby just like the vaguely baseball on a big
A little bit of a reprieve but it's only a matter of time
Especially with what the mess to be a bit of and the NBA they're shooting themselves right in the goddamn
Big one
And you know something it's amazing
But there are no NBA genes going on right now and the world is still going around
And John Glenn is still taking a big up there in outer space and
People are still you know changing their underwear every day. We hope of every couple of days every couple weeks and
Life is going on
Evil that a bunch of big freaks Janet of all down in the hoop
Isn't that a miracle?
How do we get out of them tomorrow?
You know because I have so many sleepless nights worried about Andre reading the Bruce Smith and
Emma Thomas
I have nightmares that Jim Kelly might come back
Here's Miami. Hello
Miami hello Neil. Yes, sir. I
Appoint about the
Football
Campbell that you're talking about. Yes, I come from a football family my father
That's first in his family to graduate from university
played for the original
Camping Bulldogs after 1926
It was only by the grace of God and athletic ability that I got a
Fellowship to get to university graduated
I played football. Yeah
Now I'm watching and have been watching over the past few years the
Disintegration if you will of the of the student athlete
Jason point the University of Miami
My opinion about
That Jimmy Johnson
Has seriously contributed to the other reason collecting
entirely capable players possibly first rounders future first rounders even
That would not only be a better super school. That would be a credit to their community
It almost appears as if there was some kind of
Effort special effort made to to recruit to from the bottom of the teaching
First time I can't understand it. Yeah, it equally good. Yeah, well
He never met a bodily didn't like him, but for some reason I go thought drinking with his players
It's just one of those things. It's a good time. There's some reason
I have to connect in my mind
Jimmy Johnson and the conscious recruitment. Yeah, but you see you have to understand these things couldn't happen
Without the fans and at university at the college level without the alumni
They're the ones who put the pressure to bear for these guys to win and now they do it at all causes making a difference because it's big money
You know no no no no you got the contract with NBC national TV contract
We're talking millions and billions at dollars now and so you know as long as these people is these this is their priority
To be part of a winning athletic program. That's the most important thing to them
It's gonna get worse and worse until the bubble just burst and all fall apart
You're absolutely you're absolutely correct. They you know student athlete that they didn't like from somewhere
Also around the state who live in Jacksonville or wherever that they could kind of like ship in a little carpet bag in action there
Pretty soon. It's gonna be in the kindergarten
Well, you know, they brought this kid in from he's going to school and powered right now
They brought him in from Orlando, but man this kid is gonna be a great quarterback our theme
And like I said, it's the adults. It's the silly idiotic people out there who like think this is the most important
God damn thing in the world
Is it the most important? Oh, no, I don't think so
Priorities are all screwed off their upside down people that we ought to be paying a lot all we've got such crappy education
We got no one good teachers
Teachers just suck the big one baby
Well, take a look at all the big bucks your paying the teachers and
Take a look at how much you're paying people in law enforcement and
Paying people are doing jobs where they risk their lives every then talking about good people
Really care about trying to do a job and then take a look at the money that you're paying these assholes
91 I'm gonna tell you something people from coast to coast
They got to be flooding the phone lines at MSNBC instead of talking about penis gate and some see now old parts
Been in a rounded outer space. They ought to be flooding the phone lines
Saying this is the end of American society as we knew it
We were in a deep spiral and decline and it's got nothing to do with the oral sex
It has to do with people losing their whole semblance of reality their whole perspective on my life is really all about and what is important
And what is not important they have lost it?
Oh gee, we don't know how we're gonna keep the franchise we can't pay a
91 million a hundred million anybody here 200 million and the best part is they weren't even bidding against anybody
There was ten close to what they paid but just to make sure because you know my key didn't like the 84 million loss
Angelo's even though he was crying about missing the dodge or blue and whatever
You're talking crazy people who are destroying you you're watching these people destroying their own empire right before your eyes
They're killing it
It's 158
The Neil Roger shot Lauderdale
On all the crack guys moping high school
Never leave my own anything at all
Am I a free education sure has served me well
Right
Is there my own
On the land where I'm living
We don't have to stay no
Love is more than my face
From Elvis or my jeez in all black velvet
Than a back door is my mobile home away
All right
Art is where everybody helps out
I'm old

My only soul my mobile home
My only soul my mobile home away
All right
All right
Colville 3.560
Are you done yet or what?
Are you done?
No, you are not
Colville 3.560 W2 on the Hinkover Show at 2
We got Jim Mandage coming out the mad dogs
And I got 6.30 o'clock
And then we got the Panthers in Chicago against the Black Cards
That could be real ugly
Speaking of the Maddoors by the way
They are trained tonight against some horseball team at the Amami Arena
And if you bring the kids under 12 for Halloween
They get in for free
I read in the newspaper
You even know they send us nothing about that
We have an open line in the day
It's not only take a couple of minutes
I have too much reading on the show too bad
It's very very fascinating
It's good stuff
Somebody faxes me this article by David Horowitz
From Salon Magazine off the internet
Like the other things
Show your coach to become a cause
But the real trials
I always want to say Latrine
But the reals free well affair
Which proves that whites can tell Black Cards in part nowadays
May mark the end of an era
Try this exercise
Imagine that a white player in the National Basketball Association
At first try to strangle his Black coach
And then threaten to kill him in front of a whole team
Suppose that this white player had previously threatened the teammate with a gun on a 2x4
Suppose the NBA, responding to this unprofessional even criminal conduct
Had suspended the white player for a year
And that his team had terminated this contract
How many public figures do you think would step forward to defend the culprits?
How many mirrors of major cities would speak out in his behalf?
As San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown didn't leave a trial-spy well case
Even suggesting that maybe the coach deserved to be chosen
All right
How many famous white lawyers would join his team?
And Claymeis Johnny Cochrane did that there had been a rush to judgment
And a disparity in treatment in applying that the white player was being punished
Only because his victim was Black
Here's another exercise
Imagine that a white football star with a history of brutality and jealous rages toward his Black wife
It's expected in a savage murderer who and her friends
Suppose he attempts to flee with the passport and money in his possession toward the Mexican border
Suppose his blood is found all over the crime scene and the blood of his dead wife on his clothing is car and at his home
Suppose that a 911 recording of an earlier incident with his screen that he was going to kill her is played in court of the whole country
What of a chance is that a white jury would have put him in the rest of an hour?
Or that's a white population which here's such a verdict rather than hang it head in shame
Imagine that a convicted fellowman for all violence and the king had been white
He takes the law on a high-speed chase throwing cops off his back when he's finally stopped
And otherwise physically resisting arrest
How much attention would have been paid to the fact that the police got overly tough with him
Would the president of the United States have called for the cops to be tried and tried again until it were sent to jail?
Would a white Rodney King have been given three million dollars in compensation by a contrite Los Angeles and made a post-deboy for police brutality and racial injustice by the nation as a whole?
These exercises show what is missing from the current dialogue on race
A candid discussion first of the way white America has been overreacting to the shame of its receiving racial peace
And then of the way races become such an all-purpose excuse for a much of black America that many prominent black figures don't seem to be able to leave home without it
Our blacks failing to keep up educationally with Asians and whites institutional racism must be to blame
Our blacks committing crimes out of all proportion the representation of the population
The racist criminal justice system is responsible
Our few high-paid black thugs threatening to bring down the sport that players like Michael Jordan had elevated to such a magnificent level
That's just talked by racist white owners and officials rushing to judgment with this spirit punishment level against blacks
Such canter is missing because the so-called dialogue has been framed by people for whom there is only one acceptable conclusion
Blacks are victims, whites are to blame
That is why the chairman of the president's commission on race excluded ward Connerley, a pre-manned and a critic of affirmative action from the discussion
Even though it also happens to be black by the way
That's even my president Clinton himself would work no disagreement that affirmative action was a good thing during his town hall meeting on race in Aquino Highell
Few of their to suggest that affirmative action has become racial payback to oppose it as to blame the victim which of course no decent person would do
Those directing the dialogue can't accept that America has moved far beyond the bad days of segregation and institutional racial injustice
This is the 90s with black multi-millionaires like Spreewald constituting 80% of the NBA players
Black millionaires like Brown calling the shots in major cities and black millionaires like Johnny Conferring demanding national audiences in magazine covers
And the rest of America knows it the overwhelmingly negative reactor the Spreewald affair and the ludicrous comments by people like Mayor Brown suggest that the rest of America including liberal sports writers and commentators may at least be ready to say it out loud
They've had it up to the ears with the blame games and the self-lagilation in no small part because they realized such attitudes only made things worse
The Spreewald affair shows they were approaching the end of an era which is the best news about race yet
White America has changed all blacks no longer look alike even ordinary American sports fans for instance no longer look at all blacks as on the anonymous other the inscrutable menace or the universal victim
White American can tell the difference between a liberal spree well and a Michael Jordan between a Chris Darden and a Johnny Coquing and award Connolly or Willie Brown there's a lot of hope in that
So David Horowitz and Salon magazine let's share for David Horowitz there you go baby
Oh
Well a lot of reading today. Thank God lunches here from Tony's
Thank you our friendship Tony's out. I'm a little disappointed and Hank is great. I love Hank. I do listen around the way home
But yesterday I heard that thing with our friend over there at Scott
Scott permanent land city sub
I mean after you've been doing it this long when you're big and fat like I am and like Hank is and you love your food
You've got to be able to get your food completely without having an argument
I'm giving people out of that out of shape. There's nobody I don't care what the ratings say. I don't care what the audience tells you I don't care about anything else
Nobody in the universe knows more about getting free food in here than we do on this show. Oh nice Tony sub
Got some soup got some what we got me fall sausage
9 minutes after noon and five for Tony's pizza and the subs Tony's pizza, which is located where?
Come on, let's give him a little plug here for Christ say so you're losing it
193 and 441 I'm relieved to read in 441 right down the street here and it's good great stuff too by the way if you're looking flat
You a
You son of a fan the following is a paid public service announcement from the International White Public Association
Let's face most of us will never be rich. Hell we probably won't even be successful and that's pretty damn depressed
But as usual with every
I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns
They scare the
Timmin' eight-dominant giving you whatever you want that's right handguns think about it
Need some cash? Probably don't have enough money for beer or the convenience store takes chips and pretzels wire at it
It's all free if you've got a handguns some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend kill him
Simple solution of life complex problems all you have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the court
Hell if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?
Buy the dancing of the street just buy a lot of handguns
It's a great alternative to working problem job and get it in a population control
Yes, handguns they just might make your face
Just like they said Godfather 3, wish Godfather was it he said something he might make you famous too
Godfather which one was it
1215 is 560 WK never got father three that they were in the Atlantic City
Hey, hey, it's Sunday what was his name the dog remember Vincent shot him off the horse
Come on quick quick he was on the horse they were having a guy named Dago for eight in the street there
And he said to him what are you called out his name and he said the Zaza well Joey Zaza
See I got to work this stuff out myself because you're in La La land
Sorry and when we're having the meeting in the Atlantic City there when the shantleers started it's a hit
He said yeah and sometimes he might make us all famous too
It's true that I have a bell off the good I right
Here's Fort Lauderdale hello
Hell yes sir
Hey, this is great show today
It's a good response on this
But yeah, I have anything that spoke about hockey players or yeah a lot of book and as far here we go
Here's the guy hockey on his ass yeah
Fort Lauderdale and Brad already mentioned the marks that's perfect which you wouldn't know him because he's a hockey player
I already mentioned that
Plenty of other hockey players were scumbags but not nearly as many as football how do you like that I wonder what that's all about
How's Graham James doing by the way and the bad news is all he did was molest over a hundred young hockey player and kid
Graham James up there in Canada and they put him in jail for a couple of minutes and now he's out there on day really so much and up the other day
So he can go out and molest some kids in the daytime then go back to the good night sleep in the slam and a lot of them out again the next day to do some kids
Here's some solo
Hey, how are you doing okay sir
Home run on the topic today
Yeah, I think it all boils down to this is in sports anymore it's all about business and making money
Just as a couple examples
If you were for other nation for high-paying up and you fell a urine test you're going but you play for a football thing
You can beat the heck out of your girlfriend and it doesn't matter
Right
Same thing with Eddie DeBartolo
He's not what I admitted to Salon but he's allowed to have ownership in a football team wide because he didn't put the generate revenues for the NFL
That's right
That's good of Paul Allen who owns Microsoft or there was a co-founder
You think if somebody walked in the Microsoft and started choking him down
That they would get the same treatment that Richelps re-woked for the Portland Trailblazer
Another Mickey Manlo, Willie Mays, but they were doing stuff with some casino up there
They were connected right away and this is after their careers were early 70s
They were told that they would be out of the hall of fame
That's right because they were all about money, all about business
You got to put it out there
They're protecting their image
They don't care about the image of the players or when it's protecting their image as an institution because they're bigger than life
Exactly and what they do is the owners will sit back and say well you know it's a league policy
I can't do anything about it when that's just a bunch of garbage
And it all really boils down to a Miami and you're just a parenting at home
You know you don't have all bottles most with 50% of the whole expio
These guys are private for skidding but of course they're all by different women and these murdered any of them
But I guess I'm not picking out yet
What a niche the guy comes out of search and niches the way it is
And I'm not proud of it what it happened and it's there I'm like Clinton will put a hand in the table on a Bible
And swear that nothing happens
So that's all I serve through that upper proof with all
Okay, have a great day, Stale YouTube
I don't understand what was he saying about Clinton there getting a blowjob and a blowjob
We have an open-ended power to block this even
Most people don't give a crap about the president sex life
In the fact that he's married to a US ice princess and has net sex with her in 14 years
Maybe we can understand a little more sympathetic and maybe he needs to get his rocks off once in a while
Okay, who cares?
And how that creeps into conversation I have no idea
But the president's not supposed to be a role model
He's supposed to be doing a job of running the country and keeping him from blowing a world up
That's all
He wants a chance president
I don't see anybody with any presidential baseball cards
They're using you to see those collect your president cards
I don't see those
Hey, Mr. President, can you sign your cards?
I don't see those
We have an open-ended Howard from wireless line
Here's Coral Springs, hello
Hello, Neil, how are you?
Great
Great show
You take over my interest so I have to call in
Okay
It wasn't because of the greatest job that I got out of the South Bronx
It was a ghetto in the 60s and 70s
The grace of God
Exactly, and came to Florida eventually to raise my children here
It was because of the hard work and the sacrifice that my mother and father went through
I worked in two jobs and putting me through private schools to get a good education
There you go
Education is the basis of what we would say
It's the person that turned into a good citizen or remains in the ghetto
Well, my parents made a decision to get me out of the ghetto
So they are my heroes
Not these people that you can adjust to NHL, the NFL and baseball
Will be the downfall with the money
Because how much is enough?
This is supposed to be entertainment for us
Not ripping off the general public
I mean, this is like if your next door neighbor was always coming over knocking on the door
Could I borrow a company sugar?
Could I love borrow to five bucks for a bread money?
And then next day you walk over there and you see they got a new Cadillac in the driveway
And you're wondering how can they keep getting it all of this debt
And how can they keep spending money that they claim they're not making again?
And then next day there's another new Cadillac and they come back and they want $10
They want more
And that's making me sense
And more and more and more
The only way it's going to come to a screeching halt
And you're already seeing ample evidence of it is when the suckers out there stop subsidizing this crap
Because that's exactly what it is
And exactly what you're talking about
Because I did not pay a single cent last year to go to any single baseball game for Wayne
And my son is always asking me hey when was the other game? I'm sorry
They don't have any money for that guy
Maybe as they change ownership it'll happen
But the reason is you see all the things that happen on TV
And the things that you talk about in the book and it's an embarrassment
Now only only for them but for the leaves and the teams that they represent
And they're not going to get any of my money
My money goes to my son's education
And everybody have a nice day
Okay thanks
Good lunch today by the way thanks Tony
I'll provide it
Okay but when you got a place named Tony's you don't say thanks Brad
Thanks Brad at Tony's
Yes you do
Brad doesn't sound a tell you know
Maybe his name is Brad Donatello
Huh?
Maybe that's it
Brad could be a titan
Your first name could be here could be Saul
Huh?
Like Saul South Cone
Maybe even the Saul South Cone
Where who knows?
Open line in day five for this line
Of course he does just present a problem
Because if all those sports goes under then what they'll be going to do with a format of this guy damn radio state
That's the problem
I mean you're still punny that illegal stuff to gamble on
We don't have to worry about that
We don't have to be sports
We can go out here and gamble on the leaves holding off the tree out here
My uncle used to do that
Muggy Solomon he had to be too lazy to fall off with him
But maybe not quite that bad
He was a bookie
What's right there
Here's Miami hello
Hey Neil
Yes sir
Neil I brought this up one time I called the Mad Dog
And I'm just kind of fell on deaf ears
I like Mad Dog but he didn't really have anything
Why don't they push more in the NFL
For hey you cannot play in the NFL
So you have your bachelor's degree I mean they go to
I know it sounds naive
Were they on HL?
How about that
Well the NHL doesn't really claim that you don't have to go to college first to play in the NFL
But a college there's a few of them that come out of you know like Michigan State or BU maybe a half a dozen
Yeah but earlier
They're going to college
Yeah but earlier I got me a good poor he didn't didn't mean to but he made a good point by asking about the hockey players
And you said yeah but there's not that many incidents with hockey players for whatever reason
They don't have a... they're not as despicable characters in their private lives as he's in a NFL
Guys you already know
But just I mean why can't people just talk about them?
Why isn't it... why isn't that idea toyed around with more you know what I mean?
Because I mean you're talking about revamping our whole attitudes in a society about changing all of our priorities
There's a priority in education
The guy who's the egghead he's the one like Adelaide Stevens and he's the one people look at
He's an oddball he's a goofball he's you know very bright but he's out of line with the rest of us
They don't care about that guy
Yeah I know that
Let me say it again if I'm trying to think of somebody who if John Kenneth Galbary would have killed two people
And he was rafling in a white Ford Bronco from the scene
Nobody would have been running up and down the streets of wherever the hell he was with big science say go John go
They wouldn't have been doing that right but OJ being a sports hero being a jock
Being part of this whole mythology of American society
It's just put on a jock strap suddenly all of a sudden you're a hero
And if you can run real fast, run for a while to yark you're a hero no matter what kind of a scumbag you are
Then they're all running up and down the freeways there with big sir
That was one of the most embarrassing this place that will go down in the animals of American history
Because they got all the footage of it on tape as one of the most embarrassing chapters in history of this country
And it's a great revelation of what other thinking of too many people, millions of people in this country
Well I think you said it though I think maybe the tide has turned a little bit
In other words they got now they can't claim anymore
And what I don't mean to say they is I'm just talking about blacks or whatever
But I mean let's face it the reason that whole OJ thing happened was the reaction to it was because they said
Hey how many times did black men get lynched and that kind of thing and white people cheered it on that kind of thing
So we're getting our revenge now
Okay, all right then we give you that then it happened
All right now is it a deed or are we playing on an even field now
It's like affirmative action let's stop for playing the blame game
Just like this article I read by David Horowitz the no more blame game
You want your own take responsibility for your own action
Get your own education earn your own job be able to a better job than the other people competing for it
That's it period no more no more handouts
Yeah and the other thing I was going to say the other thing I was going to say is that willy what's his name the mayor of terms system
I mean I didn't know he did that he did that I just lost all respect for that guy
I mean that's ridiculous him sticking up for free well over that guy is that pretty good
Well, freeing free well
All right now I have a great day and then of course with freeing free well
I have the hootspa that turn around and sue the NBA when they said no you lose your full of crap
Well, you know, let's refile the suit let's try it again
Because he's being treated unfairly even though they're going to allow him to come back and play again after he tried to choke his coach today
You got to understand man we need lots more anger management that's what it's all about
Anger management here we got big nasty angry guys you got to try to control them
Man
Two open lines in date five six seven up close to home
But Charles Jordan and
Lamar autonomous and others who are no longer here Lawrence Phillips serving spice
Frozen cons the criminals who play in the NFL by Jilla Q's dove including Michael Irvin and the others
Are they pale into what's significant compared to all the other stuff that's in here
So they might even up to snuff if I can say that
Here's a mobile in Miami
Hello
Mobile in Miami
Going once going twice. Here's a mobile in four Myers hello
Neil stolen a lot because of back and forth
You have a great topic today and what I would like to say about it is the following
Not only is it not an excuse to say that someone came from a poor background in
Grim the gutter but it's actually one of the most the meaning things you can say with regard to people who live in that situation
Right essentially you're saying look you are not the same quality human being we cannot accept the same level of moral behavior from you
So we are going to go back to the godfather one again when they're having the heads of the five families are having that meeting
And they're talking about you know not letting drugs near schools etc and so on are they going to get in the drug business
And the one guy from Kansas City I guess it was whatever it was talking about the blacks well their animals anyway let them lose their souls
Exactly exactly if I would if I had come from that background or a fire like the gentleman who called a few callers back who had been able to rise a thought that I would be out
Raged at the suggestion that because someone grew up in those circumstances there's no reason to affect moral behavior from that right it is
It's it's coming in if somebody kills your wife or your kid or god forbid you know anybody in your family or somebody you care about
Do you care if that person grew up in a ghetto is that going to be an excuse?
Absolutely irrelevant I mean as Susan Smith because of the fact that she grew up as a is a trailer park trash subliterate piece of garbage in South Carolina
Is that an excuse that she drowndered to kid?
It's an insult to every honest person every moral person who's living that life right this minute and is not turning into a criminal or some kind of a raking murdering animal
Yeah great great show Neil great show today
Have a great day YouTube and it's a great book like I said I only read a few page post radio
But you get the drift you get the gist of it you get the message here I think open line and date county fast line
Here's for a lottery oh hello
For a lottery oh yes sir I for fun caller all right long time listen yep I'm going to Vegas getting the hell out of here
Mm-hmm I'm out there a couple times because my mom moves out there works for that word the airlines that you're alive
America worst yeah
Boy first time we're gonna see in Caesar salad right anyway it's a point because I'm half a time half Colombian
And remember that college got a couple days because the asshole went down to a Colombian
Oh yeah the answer from four miles you call two days in a row right he probably deserved it was great claim to fame is that he you know hates Colombians
Yeah well he probably deserved it yeah I agree
I love the Colombian people like they said in Godfather Colombian people are a wonderful people are they never store free train
I was I'm like that they said I was gonna try to drag out my lover to come and see you tomorrow yeah so I'll see you tomorrow
No okay but don't bring him in drag though okay see you said come in and drag we have an open line and
Broward five seconds here's a mobile in West Palm Beach hello hey Neil yes sir man I know I'm good to talk to a person
Those were without hockey here but I'm a seasoned Panther holder and I know you were yeah I am so
This uh as the Mario Brothers yeah I mean these guys I like that the Mario Brothers yeah I mean the
Mario Brothers I mean that's the only game in town is the Mario game on a computer I mean there's no game on the
I'm yeah I mean it looks like a figure skating forming out there they're having a little
contact out there and everybody's spinning around don't go lay lessons I mean that is here they suffer from a lack of
talent I told you that before the season started this is a roster you look up and down and it's just
same old story again a couple of promising youngsters in the organization who may or may not turn out to be
real good players but there is no nucleus of a team you look at any other team and league even teams that
have good young players they're a second and third and fourth year young players before we need
developing like on relief like Sergei Burz and Alan McCauley and uh Frederic Modin not just a
whole bunch of rookies which they've been feeding us this bullcraft year after year all the kids in
the organization and and unfortunately for us most of them never pan out anyway and we got a lot
of old steps out there like Garf and Maher and Kirk Morris and Ganya and he's guys that nobody will
take from us nobody wants them and then that's it you have a roster that has no talent no
but yet coaching that has no talent right and you know but not only that but coaching now
they not only has no talent but that's got a chip on a shoulder this guy turns out to be nothing
at all like what I thought he was the more I hear from people about Terry Murray he's a real hard
ass the players don't like him he walks around with a chip on his shoulder if you look at him
cross-eyed he's gonna sit you out and uh Root I want to you know and then stay in age the way
athletes uh think these days they're not gonna play for somebody like that no absolutely not and
his brother who's the GM I mean we have far down here we had a winning team and we had nobody
yeah but I mean but he could put the nobody out there and they would hit people get
for the fine unit time and there was a boring team to watch but they played the
trap and they played that real slow ponderous low scoring board and you know I guess it was
necessary at that time because if we try to play wide open we'd have gotten slaughtered and
you know in order to compete we had to do that but now it's your number six we've had a lot of
talented people come and go on this team like Barnes and like Wally and like Strockin
Shepherd and a lot of other guys and now this is the product of what for this is his team now
it can't play Bobby Clark or anybody else this is Brian Marie's team this is what he's been put
together hard garbage gold tending no offense a so a defense that has become as porous as a
sip you basically got a 20 guys out there who stand around and watch the other team play and I'm
gonna tell you these next three games tonight and tomorrow and Monday if this team doesn't find
some miracle to turn around it's gonna be much worse than last year well then yeah I agree with
you and I think I thought last year was as bad as it could get this is gonna be much worse
yeah but you know what I'd rather paint cheaper and go through the madador's play okay
I'm gonna walk that to the hockey okay they're playing tonight right see
we have an open line at Broward five six fine twenty one two one right where you got it sports
radio five sixty two eight out hey here this is Randy West and as for our phone conversation I
talked to Peter North here today he tells me your real name is Neil down and he's still

turned on the radio to crack this out all the way down and turn on sports channel watch it on
TV here is a candle hello Neil how you doing today sir um i don't know if this is
they have just built this huge how many millions of dollars of plants and uh their foot right
here the quote is their focus is shifting to consumers rather than retailers oh boy isn't that great
they had a dietician on this morning and usually as soon as i see dietician i showed it off in
this bitch it was i wanted a network so i think a bc i'm good morning america and she was talking
about all the hidden sugar and all the ignores the i mean everything you touch is just loaded with
tons of sugar and somebody faxed me i'm glad you called because you're mind to be somebody faxed me
an article yesterday from nutrition action magazine which is put up by the center for science and
the public interest in article about sugar the sweetener the sweetening of the american diet
and how there the number the amount of sugar and calories from sugar that the american public
is eating is just skyrocketing upward as they continue cropping like crazy this this plant is
going to produce more than five hundred and forty thousand tons of refined sugar every year
all right i just i just absolutely amazing you know um i uh like to go back to the uh so big
i mean you were talking about something yesterday about uh the root rulios talking uh
the spanish in front of you you know talking kind of behind your back you mentioned that
about in the elevator something see for you yesterday i i've got even a situation that is
worse than that this this is this totally kind of you know you hate the stereotype and you
hate that bad feeling sort groups of people but i'm married to a to a very thin skinned who we

they all know that i only speaking which i'm just a stupid gringo i guess and uh so he starts
talking spanish to my wife's cousin and you know my wife's cousin is is seeing that i'm a little
bit annoyed at the situation and he keeps answering all the questions in english but my father and
love refused to speak english to him yeah you know and they were talking about anything secret or
any year they were talking about some stupid crap stuff you know that's a two thing
uh this you know that that just really fed a bad taste in my mouth you know so i can
definitely relate where you were coming because it's like you're the odd man out it's like
they're talking in code and therefore they want to make you paranoid they're talking about me
or they're saying something they don't want me to know and it's just absolutely rude and unacceptable
no it is it definitely is and if i was a country where we can't even teach people to speak proper
english and we're gonna be teaching everybody everybody everyone else's language when they come
in here bull crap left them learn english and never worry about the rest right you know you know
my i i got an insight track and you know i was a teacher for a little while my wife still is a
teacher is just your teacher's hands are just so tied they can't do anything administration is
you know it's completely complacent and they they could give you know a crap where well most of

that knows that it's all a bunch of bull crab and then start looking for other religions okay
and you know even even people want to join an atheist organization like that thing i was
reading about the other day that old fart is a good guy with a secular humanist organization for what
does he need an organization for like we don't believe any of this crap okay so let's start an
organization for what to say we don't believe in any of this crap that would be that would be
like opening up the anti restaurant where there's just don't serve any food yeah poor yeah
just charge people to come in and eat four minutes to speak to a out the new Roger show
Hunter Dale oh boy it's the one to two hours so you're an atheist completely rooted in science
so with no beliefs outside of what you can see with your own two eyes well Ben chances are
that the old testament didn't do it for you and neither did you one so with the lord's vital
attempt to bring your story as around check out the latest book from god entitled screw you to you
ungrateful little bastard start off in chapter one with who do you think caused the flood that
wiped out your house last week and then move on to such later chapters as step outside i'd bear you
and drop to your knees and pray or those hemorrhoids won't ever go away it's screw you to you
ungrateful little bastard the latest release from god it's better than the book of Mormon better
than the Torah and the Bible combined by yours one oh two a five sixty two a.m. and we're
supposed to have the fast the beasty boys over there in the navel saying that i put them on the map
that sounds like a bunch of crap me i think it's such plants must be some article in the yellow
waggle for them to begin anything to begin or not no two open lines in date county five six seven
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line i mean we had the you know a ton of calls
today that's great but in terms of really be spotting all the time i took to read that stuff
out of this book pros and cons the criminals who play in the NFL and a stuff about Charles Jordan
and Lamar Thomas and Jimmy Johnson that stuff that affects right here in town
oh no we've got to say except that first jackass wanted to give me a speech you get about
all these poor guys come out of the ghetto you know he's the same guy by the way that that
when they had a scandal about my knee high always outrageous that these poor kids are going to be
penalized because well you know something that's the way it works when you attend a corrupt
institution a school that's a violated every day and rule in the book and you're going to have
to unfortunately a pay the price when you did it or not that's just the way other real world works
happens the college is all of time pal
all the time here's David hello hello is the bill yes sir you know i i don't like to generalize but
uh on most people is that is that the repel system i think this kind of relates to what you're
talking about you know it seems that the people make their opinion based upon what happens
by the event of people right makes one of the reporters and if someone's book in the house and
killed his wife kitty do talk with you to the same wife and even mind if it was Kim
Martin but if it was really hurting you be up so it's basically ridiculous i think people need to
pay their opinion as this thing's happening to them and not the elsewhere
yes yes i find that i'm part of a rare breed just like my discussion about the arena and a
little minor complaint about the ambiance in the answer the things they would do in a big
complaint about the noise for once they stray in that uh so i don't have to stand up for other
people but if you only look through at life through my epic eyes and you only see things as they
affect you then uh all that doesn't make you stupid and selfish absolutely no and have a very good
beautiful i have heard most people are likely old SS stupid and selfish one line
there's a lady in Miami hello
lady in Miami hello yes man hi me oh um i think we're sending you a shout at a past two days and
i'm wondering why you have so many bad things to say about making yours

eight minutes after one at five you a l it's right you first to
spend for the uh for drug deal and drug do and are having a joint whatever i have to throw a
plan on his backyard whatever you well they don't have no backyards in New York oh god we have two
open lines in date five is a mobile in west palm beach hello okay nice talking to you too
here's my name hello hey deal yes sir um kind of wanted to mention one thing uh linking some things
together from earlier in the morning um i think education is the key who thinks that he can take a
big corporation dump some funds into a fat part of the city to go to school like hard charter school
problem is that uh you have to get lots of other corporations doing the same thing or to keep
that happening um i for i think i mean uh mean problem is and uh hopefully we can find the
way to get around that oh we're not going to find a way to get around because nobody cares about
it's not it's not a priority and that you know that's all lip service you know Clinton talks all
about education we're gonna have a hundred thousand new teachers and bush and macaire scream
about education but uh it's not a priority i mean the public is willing to sit back and allow
their kids to continue getting a half-ath education and allow illiterate superintendents and
principals to run school who can't even speak proper English and have no idea what they'll uh
couldn't add the two and two of their lives dependent on it and they just goes on that's all there
there's no interest well unfortunately i think that the interest is more and uh keep and sports
teams around and they'll know that they have to start to get a little bit warmer pal we've got to
keep the franchises we can't lose our franchises we have to build a new stadium on every street corner
a new arena on every street corner and we have to continue subsidizing this because this is the
important stuff now you're getting warm or how many how many schools the brothers county's built
with uh 200 million probably yeah right well and i know you know if you if you really have the
drive to do what you can do it but uh it seems like uh what i interested in that you got it all right
now i have a good take how many schools the weight of bill for us uh for underneath
tremendous have a great faith okay man okay daydeline to roll open i guess they did their
duty for today they've been actually pretty much almost involved for a change that's unusual five
step one line hank will be here with two we got managed at six and the panthers tonight and
the black cocks in Chicago anybody excited about that no anybody fired up and uh no hi doubted
could be real ugly again better not be because if this trend continues here you know that brand new
arena he's talking about we could have a lot of elbow room those of you screaming about your small
baby neuro seat you may have you may be able to uh sit wherever you want pretty soon if it keeps
up like this here's a mobile and hi lia hello nil yes sir you know i think your way off base with
this uh you know this book pros and cons yeah now these are pretty much isolated incidents you
know the i think that's not an incident that 21 percent of the players in the national football
league are convicted felons listen these guys do come from the ghetto they do have rough
lives they need a second isolated incidents over and over again and no matter how many times they
do it like the martylamus the coaches long as they can play looks the other way that's an isolated
incident well maybe they need to see a good freeze yeah okay great there you go see try just
another wise ojohn provocateur no material because you see you can you can't mess with these people
and have this jock mentality i'm never going to change them there this is their life don't you
understand this is the only thing that counts it's the only thing that's important
and so they can rationalize anything if one of the players from the dolphins came to their door
right now they went on a plane to Buffalo where we're going to lay off if they if they uh came to
their door right now it's fit in their face and uh still some other guy them uh living room
well you know uh times your tough to confuse their inner lot of stress
they will rationalize anything away for their heroes because they're the ones who make them feel
better about themselves just like a just like this college football crap and boy that's exactly
what it is my school it's like a song with hookup bram my religion's better than my school's
better than your you know we're gonna kick your ass you know jojohn florida much of y'all who's
a bunch of crafters bunch of uh red red next gotta kick your ass yeah and and then what what does
that prove does it prove anything no okay two open lines in the days like that call i had years
ago and i dumped it today i wouldn't dump it guy from a uofm the kid that called in very articulate
white student from the uofm which is unusual i realize articulate from uofm rassy moire
and he was talking about uofm football and back in those days of course they were kicking ass
winning all their games and he said well you know what you can't help but we got the big nigs
and i dumped it back to that i wouldn't dump it today because i mean it speaks for itself
we all were exposed to the n-word nigger which you're not supposed to say but n-word we had to say
because you can't say nigger and uh you know during the uofm trial for two years so now we could
let it go see and then make so different the people who are the so-called fans they don't care
about who these people are as long as they can play well they don't want them living in their
neighborhood so that's for damn sure there are plenty of people playing on her coupons and on the
dolphins today that many of the people in our audience would now want to have them live the next
door right here and see no matter how fancy the house they built or what have you they don't want
them in their hood but so long as they can play well out there that's all accounts because then
they make them feel better about themselves we won we're number one we as if somehow they got
something to do with it here's a mobile implantation hello hey Neil yes sir hey i was with you
okay call me back on a real phone your phone's grabbing out five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty on a mobile one line mobile in west pound beat chill out hey Neil how are you okay sir
good i'm glad you're shone shedding some light on the uh you just played with me and i felt
because you know i don't want to support uh these guys that uh that i don't feel i live in a
there you know both when i'm not talking about living a decent life i don't care how they live
their life but when they're when they're violent and when they're beaten up women and when they're
raping and everything and whatever else they're doing that that's gotten that's not just the
question of leading a decent life it's a question of being a criminal exactly you know you're
talking about littered up police station i just i'm a voter and i'm realizing there's absolutely no
beach that you can land on and south florida on a boat because of all the uh square up light
guards and all the crap that they put out there yeah yesterday it was uh feeling kind of tired and
i want to go sit down by the side of the ocean and just kind of relax for a few minutes and i
pulled over and uh and uh bokeh area and uh just walked up to the ocean sat down in a rock and
was just sitting there kind of enjoying the scenery all but miss whistle starts going off
yeah i turned around like what's that and it was a lifeguard yelling at me to get off the rock
now here i think it was lifeguard say you want to help you get your rocks off i think you know
those lifeguard okay yeah don't do it again okay we have an open line in brown at five six seven
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's minis shores hello
minis shores minis shores may have been listening to you for 23 years and you are great and i
want to wish you a happy Halloween and a four year list there's you know why the rich didn't have
okay we have an open line in date five six seven oh five sixty and five sixty on the mobile one line
as we continue plotting along sifting through the regs sifting through the old smegma and the old god
damn blue here and the sea of uh naval and whatever it is tojian wow here's a mobile in their field
beach hello hi Neil how are you okay sir well i'm on my way doing a business run up the west Palm
beach and maybe i'm just gonna keep heading north today yeah it's just been one of those you know
i just can't take this south Florida anymore meaning what meaning these people these old people are
just making me crazy yeah okay good okay we have an old that sound like that asshole mixed to me we
have an open-minded brown or five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the mobile one
line sound like one of the acronic misfits they all started after a while they all sound like the same
person maybe they are here's a mobile in Miami hello Neil yes sir all this about new stadiums
and everything just it almost seems it goes back to when uh high kingdom threatens to move the
panthers and the whole battle with hyzenge and herison and ever since then all you see in the news as
well it's on the ballot for a new stadium for this football game and it didn't start it didn't
start here it's been going on for years it's the idea that even the tavia new york someday must have a
majorly seen at all four major sports i'm sorry but it doesn't make any sense they can't support it
just like a five hundred or seven hundred people in green for the other night five or six
hundred people they must have there well two more points uh did you watch the faint lute uh
Detroit game last night no oh that was a good game and also i'm looking forward to the
Francis games tonight so they could break needle-mire's nose again and he'll be out for the year okay
hey hey hey hey hey you know something there's something to think about stop and think about
that that's one way good about a lineup because the man it's interesting no matter how badly he played
he guys worse and worse and worse all we get our stories and excuses did they ever said his
ass down on the bench oh they've ever been talking about that oh no oh well you know it's back
to that concussion last year in lindross or maybe when coming to him in the Chicago game or maybe
this year when the zeroff hit him in Tampa Bay is always some excuse and then he says oh no i'm fine
i just need to uh motivate my and of course he can't do it now he's fine when they were going to
trade his assets around oh thank god then he was having headaches and he wasn't 100% and the headaches
were coming back because he was too much of a pussy to leave here and go to a place where they really
know hockey i'm telling you i got guaranteed you right now if he with a fat trade would have gone
through we'd be in better shape because we'd have Felix pop in we'd have a real golium then
that's what's going to be good for us but even now just a few weeks later he'd be sitting up there
on young street in jurana sitting underneath one of those stores
fairison change mister that's what he would be doing and you look down there would be
a little guy from medicine hat well big guy now robbing you the box fairison change oh sorry oh
sorry haven't i seen anyway 80 126 to 560 wq 60 ual
a planet where 80 balls from men that's good as question do you do celebrity interviews
no okay thank you i'll be here at two o'clock we got the didn't manage the mad dogs
history tonight now and then we got a real real interesting performance receiving eight o'clock
to pregame eight thirty answers at Chicago to play sing notoriously goody black hogs
large duty again this year but they're not too good here's for a lot of day oh hello you know
yes or one journal uh generally once I let you know that uh was in Toronto on Monday cut
there my first game it's the uh the garden oh i'm sorry I had to see that game that was pretty
weak well I gotta tell you those eight eight plates that school drill was on fire but they played
pretty well I mean it i don't think i didn't think so no i played well our first five minutes and
after that the thing was well of them like stink on the way yeah if it get that good i've got
to work and they played this year i guess later played great you write it yeah happy Saturday
and maybe a tone for a sentence by playing good on Monday yeah i was gonna say that that
that's a fairly certainly is not the most attractive place i mean compared to what we have like
you know the uh atmosphere in there oh yeah new and good to you but as far as the ambiance in
there it's 50 it's a million times more than this one a lot for him you don't compare it yeah and
it's really it's just uh phenomenal yeah i think about that and it is in which you notice that when
the game started everybody was in their seat and the while the moon was going down it was sitting
in the pain of tension the game by the refreshments in between periods and when the second period
started they were all back in their seat absolutely right i've known any of them for
any while the game was going on no question no question now it was a great experience yeah i just
finally know okay glad you had a good time nothing like it baby up till February 20th
the next year and then again we got to have a new arena because we got to have more money in
the least spot the rafters they're going to make more money than god and they got to stop playing
a maple leaf garden because no more there no more that see as the old stadiums and the old arenas
go down the tubes and by the way side not necessarily because they're falling apart or because they're
it's just that they can't make enough money because it's an endless demand how much like when i
start hearing people say but they're on michael jordan he's worth 80 million a year 50 peace
from one well based on how much revenue we can generate well let the revenue go to somebody else
okay he don't need 50 million a year he don't need 80 million a year and my piazza don't need
13 million dollars a year i bet you could scrape by on ten somehow i don't know let me ask you
you people out there in the audience can if there anybody out there in this audience
that's great by a nine ten million a year low i didn't think i didn't know i mean i realized
i'm unrealistic so seriously if i could if i could get that much money for one year 13 million a year
first year so listen to me what's the 60% of that 7.8 7.8 million so i'd save seven million of it
and then i quit what's wrong with that that's a half a million dollars a year just i mean
interest the rest of your life don't need more do i need more no no it's gonna be three four
houses is that half a million year the rest of your life i think i could somehow scrape by on it
i'd have to lower my friends and stay there but here's the mimey lake so low
yeah what's wrong with the gildies yes sir speaking of gildi i gotta tell you a gildy story okay
i'd like to work with my wife so i'd play Howard on the man he starts getting too
wrong she she hits the button putting on some jazz the wasn't shaving the crotch again wasn't
well he was doing just the picking out the belches and the parts and everything and she can't stand
yeah like that so anyway he's doing belches and parts on that show now what does that
there's big now yeah yeah so she puts jazz on i says listen what we have to compromise let me
put on the first team oh boy she listens to goldies voice you know what she did she turned
on back she put Howard right back on she said i don't know listen to this let me tell you why do
you think how it's going to the roof the last book all the people who hear the worst thing when they
hear that voice they immediately punch back over to Howard he's had to probably the biggest
book he ever had in this market because gildies on there well what do they gonna hear riddles
okay it's we have an open line of day these guys doesn't understand they did he's got the pictures
don't you understand of the beastly brothers red read in a moose I mean you know I I don't
want to infringe on anybody else's ability to earn a living okay but when I'm driving to work
on those very cases when I can listen and as soon as they get into either the gators or some
other thing that I have no interest in my music goes in the cd player but when I hear gildy doing
live commercials and this is the truth i'm not exaggerating at that point I want to spark the
car pull over the side of the car get out of the car sit down on the curb and just start reading
and that is no live it is no exaggeration you know what i mean that that would be like
Lenny Lenny not you do just those tags on there because we have nobody else
about the pd to lazy and to absent all the time to be doing that which he ought to be doing
if we got nobody to do it that would be like a little Lenny over there I've made into a superstar
by the way I can't do it yeah him doing live spot
me and you all right that would be like even I'm sorry Lenny I apologize it like Robert
the grim gripper doing eight and nine spy hey that buying nine nine you can't hamburger he didn't
make down on what's wrong with that for two ninety nine I mean these are there's our nice people
they just can't speak and I think you're starting to get a little bit a little bit pushy when you
expect people to be on this station doing live endorsements for advertisers who want to spend a lot
of money and get results they expect somebody to be able to speak those wrong with you here's a mobile
in bokeh hello how you doing great I got to set out with a traffic report um ninety five just
a house of four-still boulevard I've been in just traffic stop and go for about a half hour and
I haven't gone anywhere you know that I once lived on four-still boulevard when I worked at WJN
always Mrs. Sucket Experience four-still boulevard it's a nightmare mom you know what you're doing
you're quick to dismiss you know maybe make your work place go yeah that's true let's get
them back on there let's sign them up you know he's not doing anything else in fact let's just
strap them up and that sounds good to me we don't need the uniform just strap it with me to my
if he's a big guy putting him in goal okay so this is just I mean when I thought he said then
actually turning the wrong way yeah we need to we're trying to really you know you don't even
wait man you don't understand it's a new arena they're lost they're used to going the other way
no matter what the idea is they're used to skating the other direction they need to come
this in a roadmap I mean if you see that I have a there I saw it I was there what it means
that I see it I saw it I was screaming at it and have a great day felt calm down of course
but see there's gonna be in Chicago then they're gonna be in where's it on how we night if
it gonna be in Jersey and then the others on Monday then back home for the black off
next one the I can't wait I cannot wait for that night
this is a mind out of black okay so maybe you'll continue with it so far so far
it's a pretty mediocre thing except for this one I'm proving no great shape and then let's
look like see I keep you're always sitting there what you know it was in a trip right
way so they are great or I got news for I've got proven great they don't even have their best
player Paul Valle Bully and the plan they do have Messia and the Goli but other than that they
show a great snow is playing good in the net but they're not great and they may just look
just about as bad as just try it this is embarrassing this is violating because it's a lack of
talent because it's the team that's the Maurice Bill our patty-mouge one maybe if she loses
that lesson out there where I choose they in the Washington State if you'll bring patty-mouge
you can do the GMN of course you have brought them up 60 you a m
let's get rid of Jerry Starner he's he's not improving he just brings down more crap as
always does there's just crap everywhere when you look in this room I thought maybe I
hit him like straight down a little bit as far as giving me some real top in and I realize I'm
looking at this stuff and it's garbage just wreck you just teach you right in the same stuff
and putting out a different size paper a different size typewriter a different whatever
like that other thing you brought me down here this morning Gary you're still a Pozo okay and

tells you they're weighed down because most of the games are real boring terminal coma inducing
oh you can't say that okay I won't say it or have it a good time like I said before the whole
thing is just keep convincing yourselves you have it a great time this is great like being in the
fact the path of giving it the night I kept saying god this is dynamite where we'd be going let's

so just don't click me out I know you run into calls real quick but I was over at that
financial institution FIU yes and I want to go use the pay phone and I mean it just really
fix me off y'all I go over to talk on the phone and there's this guy and he's talking English and then
when I come walking by you know I'm obviously he did he did of course switch it really yeah
and you thought he's aren't you're not talking first generation second generation
talking third fourth generation oh I understand so I have a I don't think
I'm talking kids at power 96 these are kids who are like 19 20 years old and they're in the
elevator they're talking Spanish and then they lie about it but then they were speaking English
I heard them in the shaft okay so you know why the way they're nothing to worry about I wouldn't
touch either one of them with somebody else's hand but anyway yes hey Nia you know we got to do
you got to every once in a while throw a little yiddish in there for stage yeah come to Cox
a hoist right hey Nia oh Christmas office yes and you know just two things off don't
open and drill yes it's pretty exact every I appreciate your show it's really good yes number two
and uh go show that uh guys George and my boy all right thank you okay see here's a mobile in
Miramar hello uh hi Nia thank you once again for another another week of provocative entertainment
and uh I have no I have a WQAM signal fire report three days a week I drive up from golden
glazed to about 10 bro for over 441 and you were coming in loud and queer clear learn queer
that's about an hour ago I'm 441 yes oh my god maybe we could afford to pay the whole electric
bill this month right I figured maybe uh that's where George's bonus went or else the bird
craft the other side of the end of the year you ordinarily what they do they only pay about 70%
of the electric bill every month because this company is real slow on pay so they only allow 70%
of our signal coverage which leads out most of 441 well I do that do only three quarters of my
house lights up exactly and Nia closing pool pod garage life and retired out get a life okay see
yeah here's a Miami hello hello yes sir yes Nia I want to mention about some political information
I was receiving through a mail here yes um it turns they say this like a vote yes on amendment
three because it provides an extra twenty five thousand dollars tax exemption for
yeah we're going to have to call for old parts right over 65 are you over 65 I'm almost but I'm
going to vote against it and here's the reason yes sir I feel that it's going to put a heavy
tax burden on people who are younger than 65 through themselves are hard up and so it's
incorrect yeah and I feel it's being unfair of balancing thank you many got all these
millionaires let's do it by income and not by age okay no more age discrimination in Florida if
you can afford to pay pay off that's all and if you can make it millions of dollars you got
millions in a bag no more social security stop training this country dry all these damage fastings
and here's the other thing then they say vote yes on on revision seven yeah for the court
state for bug the court system but now the question is here I have is number one they don't
mention that it also opens the door for your judges to be a point in other words be political
hack yeah I'm told to be elected well like I said just say no like Nancy said thank you here's Miami
hello hello yes sir me oh great show uh real quickly here uh this thing about it stadiums and
arenas uh back when the day county government was run out of the civic center they have the day
county master plan in a public state you could walk right up and look at it right something moved
over to government center which is 10 years ago now they never put the math back up so all of these
big planning decisions are being made and there is no place where a public person can just walk
up and take a look at the master plan of day county because there isn't can't complain about it because
there isn't any right well that's that could be true but they should have a little more maybe they
haven't been maybe the non-group is meeting down there with all those assholes from the herald
others glam and maybe the non-group has got the master plan in a broom closet somewhere and they're
like all working on it behind the scenes and the plan too they're working on it so let me just
ask you this and closing from what's been a pretty dang good week here generally speaking especially
when the phone works with it didn't one day well Greg's been out and he only said a cold in the program
director's on vacation but anyway uh it's been it's been okay it's had its moments but let me just
ask you this to pond around don't forget Ben and Jerry's tomorrow by the way noona too but think
about this over the weekend okay when I first came here 23 years ago this city had minis stadium
with those little baby orals and we had the orange ball that was it there were no other I mean
there was lock-hard but there was no like other big glitzy stadiums arenas there was no nothing
is this town better or worse today 23 years later with the stadiums and the arenas and the american
airlock oh there you go have a nice life
