You are a Friday you fast dude. All right good sports stuff and all that. How the
Gainers do it and some of the old and her cool and the doffens. That's the
important heavy duty stuff. El Presidente just made his confession. Any
White House prayer, a breakfast of all the religious leaders there. I mean so
emotional that even an old hard-ass like me was practically in tears. Ready for
that. Maybe it was in tears for other reasons because I work here. Maybe that's
why I was almost in tears. Oh my God I don't work for one moze of outfit. I
work for two moze of outfits. How do you like that? How many of the rest of you
out here in this audience can say that huh? Not too many. I don't work for one
bunch of incompetence. I work for two bunches of incompetence. Oh man. But the
two men we couldn't carry that you know and it's interesting to show you this
Monica Lewinsky. See there's the Chigurina Woodpile right there. Linnetrip
Monica Lewinsky that Gilbert bitch up there in the yard. This whole group of
lunatics missfits miss Creeance. While the President was doing his confession
this morning and apologizing to everybody who's ever been bulletin and
some will haven't been talking about his heart or his broken
strong heart and how he will advise his attorneys to mount the strongest
legal defense but not use any legal ease alignments to try to excuse his sins.
The stock market went the Dow opened down dropping like a rock again it was
down 88 points when he started speaking some of about 35 right now which
doesn't really prove that it's going to be an update but it does show the
impact okay on the heels of Japan going in the crapper Russia like being
basically out of business Latin America billions pouring out of Brazil and
Latin America the dollar record in the crapper the whole world on the verge of
like a recession if not worse and this is like they're frosting on the
okay thanks a lot Monica you bitch Monica Lewinsky a fucking bitch there you go
just absolutely unbelievable oh wait a minute there are we put this must be
replayed pop it up and let's see if we get some of this stuff this is unbelievable
it's a rock bottom truth of where I am and where we all are yeah now why didn't
he do this August 17th I agree with all of you have said that in my first statement
after I testified I was not and tried enough I don't think there is a fancy way
to say that I have sinned it is important to me that everybody who has been
hurt know that the sorrow I feel is anyone first and most important my family
also my friends my staff my cabinet
Monica Lewinsky and her family and the American people I have asked all for
their forgiveness and the president why don't we don't need to build what's
his name what is his name Hummer and the market's up 71 points it's why every time
they put him on again it goes up another 20 points the problem is gonna be a
two o'clock when all you many acts out there gonna be on the internet and I'm
not gonna give out those websites okay because you're not gonna get on
there anyway it's they're all over the world keep in mind that all the
salacious craft is gonna be on there on the internet not just here in this
country but all over the world people are gonna be hopping on that thing but
I mean edible and it's gonna be 445 pages of sleeves is there anything in
there about the white water no anything in there about file gear or travel
gate no there any like real crime other than a sex scandal and lying and
covering up no well that's your novelism you know last night you see I've
put you for months now doing with a bunch of sanctimonious assholes both in
the Congress and also in the media but your phone is in liars and hypocrites and
Larry King leave it to Larry to always you know put the worst crap on there
uh-huh every time never fails us uh-huh he's got these sanctimonious old
fossil Robert bird senator from West Virginia who made a disgusting speech in
the Senate the other day a self-righteous bunch of crap and if you could have
heard maybe some of you did actually see this so you're probably busy on your
hands and knees not praying now but puking about the last 50 years about the
decline in morality and the language and the movies and television the same old
stuff Robert bird Democrat for West Virginia you think that he was one of the
damn right-wing religious nutcases and it's just amazing that astonishes me
what what are you looking at CNN what's he got on his head who wherever that is
representative of traffic can't remember a San Francisco traffic can't oh yeah
it doesn't have anything out his head he's got a bump do it forget about him what
that was I just talking about what the hell is I just talking about I was like on
our ruler I mean in the middle of something and what the hell do I care about
what he's got he's got a bump on his oh I'm playing a machine I just forgot my
thank you Jesus Christ if the president's praying with all those religious
these you know the best part of that prayer breakfast it didn't happen the
first few minutes but there were several black needless to say because
everybody was a black guy is a minister so there are several black religious
leaders including the uncle Jesse Robert bird I'll get back to him but at any
rate so as the president was reading a prayer because somebody down here in
Florida when he was here today for a buddy okay he said some of Jewish guys
some Jew gave him a passage from a young kipper liturgy which you know kipper's
coming up very soon by the way so he read from that so as he was reading from
the liturgy doing this prayer thing a lot of the black guys in the audience
people started doing it like they do what do you what do you call that besides
embarrassing oh yeah yeah calling back calling his call back
but on the red on bro all right yeah they were doing all right which I thought
was kind of embarrassing but yeah they were doing that and it looked his prayer
okay I thought maybe it was like one of those football you think they do that
at football prayer breakfast all right yeah I might it sure would know look at
the markets of 110 points now because the president finally came clean
sports court and like I said and they're saying the same thing if he wouldn't
done this back on August 17th when he came on TV that night but of course he's
gotten a lot of bad advice from way back at the beginning instead of make it
as Paula Jones thing go away which would have been the smart thing to do oh no
we're not gonna do that we've been ahead of it we could have been spared the whole
world could have been spared this embarrassment and at two o'clock this afternoon
there is gonna be a bunch of salacious crap on there this is one of the most
incredible embarrassing grotesque witch hunts in the history of the human race
not just in this country but in his long sad arduous history of mankind from
the day that this man was sworn in as for and before that of course long before
that with the Jennifer flowers stuff before got the nomination back during
democratic primaries in 91 they have been anxious to whip his ass out of it they've
tried to spend fifteen to sixty million dollars now on this so which hunt have
they found any criminal activity on anything other than connected with sexual
activities no no and go back to this Robert bird asshole in this craft how how
come Larry King who's sitting there supposed to be a yes besides just an ass
liquor is he anything besides an ass liquor no he's not how come a Robert bird
make this a rages comment about things that have happened and I don't think
there was any TV what FDR was screwing around there in a white house was there
any TV when George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were screwing around no
were there any movies then no I mean what are we talking about let's always blame
somebody else the fact is that people sex lives tend to be sorted not everybody
but most people screw around oh my god you can't well it happens to be true and
what the hell that has to do you know in Italy you know what they were saying
about this yesterday is great is good in Italy that they ought to be giving him an
award that throughout the end of his of him that over there they would like
I'll canonize him because he's getting a good stuff on the side what else
wrong with that I mean he may have that taste and his selection of women including
good old Monica bitch who keeps a semen stained dress I mean I didn't throw
anything away I threw nothing away it's all piled up it's in there prick
brimes with yeah for this bitch for this wild witch hunt we wouldn't have we
could have inspired all of us and we could be addressing the other problems
that are causing the world economy to go out hell on a hand basket since there
are more important goddamn things to be warned about the one for the Yankees
are going to win 116 games stuff like that whether they orcones are going to be
another girl school I know that comes to the shock on his station but it happens
to be true that was up 112 points how do you like that went from down eighty eight
before his end am I suggesting there's a correlation air you bet because this
whole thing with the everybody is in having a nervous breakdown of the economic
situation in the world so the the psyche of investors is so fragile at this
point that the slighted if somebody fart and it smells the wrong flavor right away
the market goes down 400 more points so we can thank and he even apologize to
her and her family which I thought was totally unnecessary so she ought to be
out there she should have been a prayer breakfast reading the young kipper
liturgy she should have been begging for forgiveness because she's the slug
that is a psychotic insane that is ready to bring down the whole goddamn
government because a building now you know leave Hillary and run off with
monarchy the summer eyes are sunset or someplace he's not for rocker he's
crazier than a bed bug he ought to shadow of a doubt that this is nothing but a
political which on number one and not releasing any of the other desperately
screaming and begging for them to a release the a four hundred and forty five
pages to the White House before to a clock before the rest of the world gets it
oh well yeah you guys can get it on the internet like everybody else so there's
no politics involved in this at all is that of course not had a laugh I'm watching
Henry Hyde at the beginning of this committee they had last night the House
committee Henry Hyde and John Conjures and Henry Hyde sits down there oh and well
you know we have to transcend politics and this is too important for the to be
any politics in a partisanship and rugby but and I'm sitting there just
peeing in my pants laughing like who the hell are we kidding like that isn't what
this is all about that's exactly what this is all about and if Kenneth star
weren't an absolute madman now he's threatening he's gonna have indictments
against Betty Curry and against the secret service and against this one and
that one and everybody that the president they ever spoke to because they're
all part of this big conspiracy for a cover up to cover up what oh well the
president lied was advised there's no other people in the white house what do
you want to think if president Clinton if you were let's say some anybody out
there anybody who like is the boss in a company you got a secretary what was
he supposed to say oh you know that Monica gave the best head I've had in a
long time he's gonna say that to Betty Curry is that the deal I mean we're
talking here about a sexual escut series of sexual escu-pays by a man who
already we know was a womanizer before he was elected the first time before
he was elected the second time and for months now people have been saying
enough of this crap we want out of this we don't care we can't stand it and
yet Kenneth star and the people who have prompted me to that position are now
on the virgin about three and a half hours of releasing the most humiliating
possible crap that you could possibly imagine and if it weren't politically
motivated why the hell would we need to know would anybody need to know the
details the things she's masturbating with a cigar and they're doing it in the
limo and he touched her and she touched him and it did constitute but it'd be
fun to move but why is all that necessary unless of course there's an attempt to
absolutely totally humiliate an embarrassed and make it impossible for Bill Clinton
to continue to be the president that's what this is all about is there anybody in
this audience anybody who'd like to have a 445 page report put on the
internet at 2 o'clock this afternoon detailing all of their sexual escu-pays of
the last couple of years or maybe the last of 10 years or the last 20 years is
there anybody out there do I see any handrails no don't see any line forming at
the door what the hell is this have to do with governing a country what is this
have to do with anything that this man was elected for is that anybody's
business was was rose to fellow womanizer was Kennedy and Eisenhower and Nixon
had a mistress and every other guy day month going by all the way back to George
Washington with his wooden teeth we've reached the point in this country where
the media are so insane and they're they're the ones without the media can it
start could never have gone anywhere without this seven month feeding
frenzy that's gone on now it's almost nine months now what a pregnant idea
where they have banged on this and banged on this and you people out there
said we don't want to hear about this we can't stand it reminds me of this
place there are real problems going on out there and you're dealing with crap
reminds me of a Q.A.M. there are real problems you need to be dealing with and
you're dealing with cock-a
you're so sweet as when this comes out all these sanctum of the Pacific
Ritz are going to be oh my god can you believe oh look at that look at where
she stuck this and he stopped that oh my gosh what did he generate and so he
was forced of course under a lot of pressure and it would have been very bad
advice if he would have given that same speech that he gave in his prayer
breakfast at the White House this morning back at August 17th everybody in
America would have had a tear in your eye including even a nude
gingrich and even at Orin's snatch would have been like doing a three-hanky
job men would have said oh we forgive you we understand we love it because of
course this is the way that the goyam think anyway right we love the center
when he confesses his sin there's nothing greater just like Jimmy Swagger remember
that craft that good old religious Jimmy Swagger Hifakrit now they're sanctum
of the Pacific Ritz and he came back I have a sand and he's crying in the
army crying in the army because there's no money coming in that's what that
was all about but boy they sure love after they confess their sins and so
that's what the president was reduced to this morning having to be humanized
and humiliate himself and apologize to people to whom he was no apology
there's no apology to Monica Lewinsky she went there with her knee pads she
went there pull out her friends and I forgot to get the damn thing out there
that you got piled up with all kinds of crap on told him every kind of she was
doing everything in her power to flirt with the president get as a
notorious womanizer who liked going out there playing golf with Vernon Jordan
talking about see all the time like most guys do I mean wake up and grow off
America okay I hate to break the news to you this is what people do and this is
what people talk about is their sexual exploits only usually we're not
dealing with insane crazy bitches like Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp who have
no concern about the magnitude or the implications of their actions or their
words who couldn't give a crap less the scorned woman that's the one to look
out for baby the scorn bitch that's the one you better watch out for a
fucking bitch because she's ready to bring your house hold down in this case the
whole goddamn government come tumbling down and put us through all of this
expense all of this emotional crap and that's exactly what it is we've gone
through nine solid months in this country of nothing but every time you turn
on your TV you can't escape it no matter where you turn and I've tried to
avoid we talk very little about it thank God because there's nothing amusing
and oh yeah there be people laughing and shortly when the stuff comes out of
two o'clock today when you get on the internet they start hopping through if
they ever get through on that thing they start sifting through the 445
pages and get to those juicy it's like people that used to be lady chatter
with his lover and they know skip skip around till they got to the good parts I
mean who now wants to read the whole damn thing it's two-time consuming let's get
to the good parts the juicy stuff and they'll be charting and puking and
defying oh my god this is hysterical great stuff and let me say it again I
wonder because I know from personal experience believe me all these people
over all the years that I've been on the year like way back when I came out of
the closet December 76 oh yeah faggot this and that pervert yeah and and what's
the bullet and what's the new story see pervert is a relative thing it's a
relative thing and I guarantee I'm a hell of a lot less pervert than most of
you are all we're giving the opportunity well
bunch of sanctimonious phony hypocrites because America has refused and
continues to refuse to grow effing up here's this wolf blitzkrieg there here's
these media people out of control and a feeding frenzy there was sam dom I'm
gonna tell you I will never as long as I live as long as I live I will never
watch another piece on ABC news of under penalty of death their credibility is
worse than our news department we don't even have one they have no credibility
here was sam domelson yesterday when the president came out to announce that the
Northwest Airlines strike was over it just foaming at them out in a feeding
frenzy oh but every opportunity because there are a bunch of people in the
media who are salivating it this poor love to bring this president down
absolutely unbelievable this is what happens when you refuse to grow up when
you're so uptight about sex and the human body and things that people and
that's like everybody is said like anybody with a brain is said that's between him
and will willery shock warry that's between them somebody's god damn business
which is what he said back on the 17th but if he would have made this speech
that he made this morning back then we could be talking now about the important
things like Sean Burke's things okay and the panthers are gonna suck this you
we can be talking about important stuff like that speaking of prang I said here
yesterday I said please please don't sign Sean Burke for the panthers guys he
blows he's another city like a mirror image of the other geek that we got
Kirk McClain captain jerk so what are they announced today oh they're working on
any minute we're gonna be here and they're assigning Sean Burke you're gonna
have two steps in minutes this year but boy you're gonna love that new arena we
could be talking about stuff like that so our entire lives are overwhelmed are
shrouded now with his horse track like a shroud of touchdown Jesus just hanging
over our heads oh it's big enough a TV show by the way I mean I got so much
stuff that I wanted to talk about here today but of course we got this
kind of starcraft getting in my way I want to do about a two-hour attack on Rob
Kaplan here today and deservedly so who's butchering that TV show you know why
we can't get in and maybe people say well you're just covered up for the
practice it's just a it's just a concept that'll never work maybe that's true I've
enjoyed some of those shows on there to be honest with him many times if it's
edited right and done and a little bit of work goes in a little bit of thought
to what we got a four-hour show here every day each one of those half-hours
first of all splitting it up into half-hours is idiotic to begin with I mean
it's like a death wish putting a stupid sports show there in between but
that stupid guy bouncing around on the couch Mr. Happy face but to take and put
this stuff if somebody should be impeached it should be Rob Kaplan because I
watched last night from a quarter to 10 to 10 o'clock with this man put on the
year you know we get I don't have to tell you the phones lately are slowly
here that all the shows this town goes in cycles it's always been that way
always will be that way don't ask me why so I'll sit here and I'll milk some of
these guys let him go on for a lot longer than usual because I got a four-hour
show to kill every day with Jane Eazy as you may think but to take like the guy
I hate to pick that guy out because he was talking about stuff that I was
talking about we're trying to be responsible about Australia he's been there and
about Vancouver in the hotel and you can see I'm almost going into a coma
and I'm going I'm on I'm puffing on my stoke and they put this on when he
last night if I would have had a shotgun I would have shot the damn screen on
on my goddamn Sony XBR that's how forming it to mouth that's how pissed off I was
Rob Kaplan we got all this great stuff that Bulk of Brian and satellite
comedy that we're called is great the humorous stuff people want to go to
last though and we got all this depressing here we go investigate in the
president the star report Monica sticking her cigar up or whatever she's doing
with it exactly people want a little chuckle here and there and what do they
put on their me sitting there like I mean if I'm bored that's listen to this guy
droning on for three minutes or whatever was what seemed like an hour then
why the hell would you put on the goddamn TV show you put you little
faker he didn't go to brand ice he went to F you that's where he went you
little piece of pusillanimous pus yeah after we get done with this Monica
stuff your next sweetheart just keep it in mind just absolutely butchering
making me look like a jackass like a bigger fool in our already in thank you so
much Rob you idiot you but hey that's you know he doesn't have to worry he's on
staff he don't have to worry about a job 1027 if I boy it is here you could
fry eggs on this console I might just do it by the way 1027 on QAM 60 QA
it's right there you press dude here we go with all this debate going on is the
president is is our is attorney is going to get like five minutes to see this
before it's on the internet no like five second oh are there going to be any
fairness here any opportunity like we supported everybody else including a
new gingrich and Reagan and everybody no of course not is this political yeah
you bet by the way between noon and one and then again between one and two
once each hour we'll be giving away a pair tickets for the dolphins and bills
today for those of you who couldn't care less about the rest of this and by the
way what are we tell you for Harvey Jr. start to look a little bit better now okay
even though he was full of crap well he's usually early at least one thing you say
about him he's consistent he's usually full of crap but right there in a front
page of your son sent also must be accurate Henry Marlon's deal is done book a
business man says you'll take control from my finger in October there you go say
goodbye to Wayne on a Marlon front there you go because John Henry good old John
Henry he was a what was he a hard work in what was that thing he was a steel
driving a steel driving he was a pile driving money had piles and what they said
yeah it piles and what can you do well this fact by the way is this from
somebody chronic this looks like Andy one of the Hollywood one of those
chronic oh geez I'm not even going to read it I just get the willies when I see
chronic facts right in there so John Henry is by on the Marlins which we told
their first on the show even though it was a little bit of a premature or
evaluation but nevertheless it's a done deal you don't think them browsed you
would stay around here if Wayne or Smiley was gonna have their fine thing run as
deal no take a pay cut oh no I don't think so so there you go with that we got
Marlins and I mean the dolphins and hey by the way how about those Marlins

hello hello NEO yes sir how are you okay
hey NEO someone told me that star planned for governor along with the way is that
true he ran for governor after I know I don't think so it was a good
I think that's true no okay all right anyways my way I see NEO you think the
whole thing is in crap and that's that's part of what the either your
psychic you already saw this on see them when they were reading these were
but from the president's attorneys that's part of what they're saying they
laid out the thing about how the the definition in the Paul Jones case was a
total entrapment because that was at the time that they put a little trip to
wire tap moniker and a whole thing so that's one of the charges that they're
making was an illegal entrapment to lure him into you know this fact you know
I think the American author keep an eye on who is gonna be our next president
instead of worrying about this guy who's almost gonna be out of office anyway yeah
yeah I'm saying two years yeah yeah okay let's go to sunrise hello
sunrise is that incredible yeah but I mean I mean

Mr Psych hike was in institute uh you know was in fancy of making ball and Ball and
And he had the misfortune. He had the involvement of getting involved with a bitch like this.
I agree with anything, but anyway, I hope he can survive it, I guess.
Okay.
And I think about it.
Have a great day.
That's good of a lady mobile in Miami. Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, ma'am.
This is Bobby Hainan. How are you?
Okay.
You remember me?
Bobby Hainan from the singles day.
Yes.
I've been wanting for all the day all the time.
Right?
I said,
Oh, I agree.
Anyway, first of all, I want to say I've been watching you on television.
Uh-huh.
And it was so funny.
One of your listeners did that.
He's one of my good friends.
Said, you know, he's telling me how great you are after the bitching out of nowhere.
The amuletist didn't even notice that you're having a young person.
Uh-huh.
Anyway, I'm following you because you're having a hard time first.
I worry you're almost there because it looks really big in the corner.
What is it?
You know, the first person that has ever said anything that makes sense about this monocle.
Uh-huh.
But, you know, I have an answer to this technology and I want to tell you.
So I first heard about this girl and about the background.
I had it all figured out.
Yeah.
But I tell you, I think a mother, you know, one of them had to get her immunity.
I mean, the mother keeps that stress and the positive in the back.
Very long.
The sickest, one of the sickest things in the history of an immigration effort.
Some of the media, the twisted people in the media, don't seem to have any problem with that.
They, they, nobody's questioning why anybody would do it.
And with the God, the reason I called it, it wasn't easy.
I'm in front of Mount Sinai trying to go up to see my mother,
driving around and around, wanting to call you because I feel so powerless about what's going on.
You know, you feel like you want to do something, have people say something, you know?
It's like a star, out of the way.
You know, I don't know if anybody has ever mentioned it.
I wrote it on email to a couple of programs.
Nobody has ever mentioned the house thought.
I always had that.
It's too small.
Oh, yeah.
It's cool.
Is that what it is?
Yeah, but they think that's a depression.
It's like a logical expression for people who are ready to even kill you.
Yeah.
Or slice off at the next.
Yeah, I'm always wonder that every time you see him, he's coming out of some garage somewhere, parking garage.
He's got that stupid copy from his in his aunt.
And when you think that if somebody was really impartial and doing this investigation,
does he come out with a very solemn look on their face like, he looks like he's traveling in it.
He's traveling from it.
I got a one, Bobby.
He's good here from it.
That's the answer, man.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Okay, we got Hank Gover from Daniel Hyer from, from, from Plymouth, your dog track.
Okay, same difference.
From Plymouth, your dog track coming up next.
And then we got to, what do we got at six?
We got probably Donnie B. Talkin' baseball.
We got somebody talking baseball at six.
Somebody who doesn't make a lot of money.
And then we got the pregame at six thirty.
The Marlin's vote for lost number 100.
Get the braves tonight.
And we got the dolphins on radio, but also on TV, Danit, on Sunday.
So it's two o'clock in the morning.
Go for it, that'll be fun.
