spanic lady i stopped in there all the time at that border she has to hate me

i like that the bitch at the borders over there by man he would make it up
because this guy's a fan okay you can just tell by the on the answer to call
he wouldn't be making that up

a bookstore and it is it is a bit behind the car all i hate that off there i
can't stand
and of course not
that's up in the record store to me before though

but what kind of garbage is that that's less that
in other words it if you're buying it that means you like it
you care if the perfect the court behind account or likes it of course not
face-to-date
that you're only gonna be you're only gonna be insulted because some
zit or rhymes with it face-asshole behind the counter

buyers we got lines open all over the guy damn place
even mark dooper never saw so many lines five six seven

and he's the q a l
your god
channel sixty nine offers you a full day of programming of us trying to impress
ourselves
and we don't mind if you do not watch a fishing contest about a control
interns trying to outcouilly
each other like Cuban intensive shows spoken in obligatory English
so cuban you'll feel like you just pick through castles garlic
live in studio dog shows with acoustics so cavernous
michael miller with blush with embarrassment oh yeah that's a guy at night
but we're here at we're cool we be the bomb
jaddles sixty new on putting the women on television at your
scene that's their match and baby
k pasta you have to say that's on that's on twice now and suddenly you were
that
was old past the uh... worn out uh...
whatever the hall they call
no seriously that they're old and they're being the match ones to
refated it's like old prints that are like a hundred years ago
remember old prints
and you know what fabulous place but they got to make one change yeah
since we have a new stadium we have a new panther announcer
sky christmourts like listening him listening to what's that i do with a
stadium
no no no i'm saying we know
no no there are a really is lovely yeah
and but i'm saying since the panther made this new change
they they love them don't you understand they really believe this guys are
hockey announcer
did you listen to you did you know that i don't listen to him i would never
listen to him and by the way the good news is all eighty two games this year
of the on sports channel
even though you got to put up with my friend rimmer and then he's spot-band
which is a big improvement over that moron on the station so the thing that
was uh... you know turn on your radio turned the sound down and turn on your
tv said it was like that he was announcing a funeral right
okay they'll i love you thanks a lot hold your breath hold your breath for
that uh... christina moron to be gone he's got naked pictures of the enjoy
it and even here anymore that's how i think you got the job
are we gonna get started on him again this year i wouldn't even waste my time
i wouldn't waste my breath with it okay
because people are real hockey fans which they're very few from down here
but those of us from real living in breathing place places who've heard real
hockey announces great announces like bill he wouldn't any galvan and mike
langan rich generate and uh... can wilson and people in pre-cusey who really
know how to broadcast the hockey and make it exciting
bob cool when he was uh... before he had his heart attack
those that that crowd then we know what are we are hockey now is all about
you call this guy hockey announcer
only part of the junior but okay so here we are almost at the end of the day
we've lost is he
we lost is he we lost would be because i think i've got upset with me because
of the uh... i told the truth about the cross guy amphitheater what a
uh... outdoor toilet it is
so we lost would agree with that's two
now we got sandy back but that was only i think temporarily we ever heard from
sandy again just that one time
just this one time
we heard from sandy
did we get anybody else back from did we get anybody from the tv show
like one or two but that was intermittent that was along the way
so we are a listener short that's the problem
is the and would be
which sounds a little bit pornographic to me
we lost those two for a ride on what i did is he's gone that's okay with
what it is yet you just want to pay my house again that's alright
but we lost them we picked up sandy maybe so i think i will count her like is
a half because i don't know if she's back
not landing lady we know she's still out there
that's what we have to do tomorrow gonna have to like rekindle our old friendships
out there because it's getting really grim this whole radio stations getting
grim i notice the other shows they'll talk to each other
vote campers on the other day he's talking to donny b for two hours
because there's nobody calling
maybe everybody out there in fact i'm coming to work this morning was like a
holiday maybe most of the people died we just didn't report it yet
maybe all the old farts died we just uh...
set my mother we can have that happen because i got a lot of occasions coming up
thank you which i'll get in that momentarily
a personal minor tonight tonight this is the uh... demarcation point in my life
this is the moment of truth tonight between six and eight p.m. at the pizza
lock
i want to ask that i wonder
he why wouldn't why did he say that
well just because uh... it's one of those things you know
one of those things where we have to lay down the government we have to put
it right out there in the line and say if we have our faithful loyal people out
there
they want to help us out with a set of one campaign
they want to show some tangible support
they want to show up there to pizza lot
either just out front in the uh... front of the thing where they got the table
set up and by the best of the old from uh... the cd's and cassettes from
set up one of the t-shirts the great t-shirts that uh... t-shirt tom came up with
from uh... captured glory
or better yet come in and actually sit down and eat a very inexpensive meal at
the pizza lot
let's play the guy then pizza lot jingle okay
and i assure you by the way that you have to not touch your food
so
if you want to go with you
a
help
god deal
what i got here is a new dance
some people call the farm dance
i call it a dirty square dance
up with the pitty goat down with the pants in with the pitty everybody dance
and
girls went right on up against the walls guys with a heart on prominent dolls
girls grab your partners firmly by the balls drag them down the length of the halls
make up my honor make them shout what you pretty has up against it now
i need to go take a lady pass third lady finger up the boards guys I have
welcome

prominent halls now released the more guys fall
down with the pitty goat up with the pants this is the end of the dirty square dance
those who know are reckon
i'm tired now
i think the purple brand means a free ride but they
uh...
because we're dealing with sphineless israeli's over there you know that that's
why they're here they were courageous israeli's they'd be over there fighting
the air
but they're over here they went out
anybody went on come over here go back over there to the wailing wall in
wail on a matty you fat slob you idiot you bald headed geek you jackass
these are two guys their experience combined experience in television these are
two guys they bring in from out of town to run a td station they're combined
experience in television between the two of them is
they go zero none they don't even own a guy damn television
they don't even know they don't forget about having a remote control they
wouldn't know how to hit when they make the set go on
that's what these guys know about television the big there you go
okay so we survived to that we had our ones in our twos net that one might we
actually have for about two minutes of three share on it but in the meantime no
promotion no nothing they're screwing up to show a lot of putting stuff on
days after it's already you know been on
but then we get to this stone forever business okay
how to excuse for a human being what piece of walking
experiment took that card off and that's my stand that's been sitting there
firmly entrenched for several days now
and i mentioned in george what happened to god damn card that was sitting up
this is all robbers in their pockets and run on friday
rob cappellan was in here diddling with my goods on friday how do you like that
which i've often fantasized about that but i didn't think it was going to be
these goods are you ready for that rob cappellan was in here fiddling with my
joint on friday and again i don't blame in him i understand he wants that
grow the big pair he doesn't have he's working on it real hard stephen he's
working on it trying to grow the big pair they're not growing though they're
like the bebes because maddie and vicki are upset
so they take my postcards stone forever out of here
because we're running into ice now i want you to keep in mind during the
entire half hour show last night i'm puffing on a god damn stogie
okay george is sitting in there blowing smoke we got you can't even see
in here it's like we're lost in a big effing cloud in this god damn place okay
let me light this up again okay just to make my point how many times do i like
this during that half hour last night i watch the damn show it'll give you a
cancer and a tumor and it'll kill you bad for you and we don't want to pay all
your medical bills okay there you go
smoke up the ass all over the god damn place we're blowing smoke
so here i am smoking stogie's on the show which i do almost every day on this show
and have been for four months now but we're running that toy smoking care
it's got nothing to do with your anti smoking campaign
it's got to do with the fact and of course on kinets frequency they're
smoking all kinds of stuff who knows what they're smoking on at your every night
over that's after midnight well a big deal
we have more disclaimers on there about parental discretion and they're
doing all kinds of grotesque things on there and put your kids in the god damn
oven and get them out of here put them in the dumpster in the you know
enjoy it
had nothing to do with the fact that they're running an anti smoking campaign
it had to do with that they're spineless and gutless and really if they were
smart if they would do something that fits in with their own mentality
they would have spider-man and mash on twenty four hours of it that's that
that's their level that's the level of whammy channel 69 spider-man and mash and
maybe once in a while the monsters and if they really want to get carried away
k pasta us a but not the one where rocky comes out naked with the tower
around his waist not that one that's getting a little bit too carried away okay
okay okay yeah bet i mean you talk about
gutless coward
the essence of this show is that it is outrageous that i say things on here
that make a hell of a lot of sense by the way
like the stupid god damn pot laws in this country if i were some kind of a
pot head if i haven't smoked the crap which i don't even like the way it smells
much less having to start to smoke it then i'd be like a normal can you know
i'd be like uh... here try to encourage people to uh... to do it
i don't give a crap whether you're smoking or not it's innocuous it's in name
it's ridiculous
and what i do go to i'm stood on and you walked on the streets there like a
rudavacilin and every other street there's a cafe's and you smell uh... you
know each each cafe has got a menu not exactly like this one that we got on
this card here not exactly like this one that's got uh... for example fc
de pop up from the Vatican holy grass fifty gilders twenty five bucks
but in any way uh... in you walk down the street and the the aroma of the
pot and the hash that's being smoked inside lots out of the street and say
that's thanks actually when you come in fact you're really sure whether it's the
dog on the street or whether it's the uh... pot that they're smoking inside
and who cares and nobody they're not having reaffirm madness over there
people are shooting each other in a street over there they're doing it here
last time i checked
so at the point of the putting this up here is to make a point to make a
god damn point and there's one and so god damn scared like i said
this show is too hot for them to handle it has been since the
beginning okay
that's right since the very first thing show it was too god in the don't don't
start sticking stuff on here okay
member the bird
since since this a putz put this uh...
right it's all this stuff in here am i uh... three sixty all of a sudden now
he's putting drop in i'll do my own drop in thank you
haven't heard the way it sounds over on sure in the street when a board
off with those stupid drop in there behind uh... whoever's on the air i didn't
do not it sounds like a kindergarten radio not even high school radio i didn't
do nothing
that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
that's a mentality that i'm perfectly equipped thank you to handle my own
crap in here okay
oh my god spying list gutless cowards
who's idea of a really revolutionary show was out loud with this poor grease
ball of an area sweating up a storm poor bill direct
that was their idea of a revolutionary local show there that was hot
is that gone uh... won't see that no more yeah them and us we're the ones
getting canceled everybody else is still on our generation in yay is there
anybody watching generation in yet no they ever get a number no
city desk they're still the one the same city desk that stupid herald show
which they heard as long since that right about where he by the way but never
less they're hoping they might do it again
they're running the same episode of the tool ladies where they found the dead
body in the condo this to the run at six hundred times oh yeah yeah that
old bag you know they found a dead body and about oh yeah
ten twenty seven and five sixty wqa you use stupid back to do i'm probably
really americans anyway probably here like a like i said on the temporary
green card or right now to get a red card from the soccer officials give
the red card they're sitting out the messages grow up america that's the
message on the show you know i see a tremendous parallel
between the american attitudes about drug certain ones which are called drugs
which you grow in a backyard in the ground and this crap that's going on in
Washington right now all of this crap the entire country the whole world is
being subjected to this garbage and of course we know it's not partisan right
every single vote yesterday the house to just you to do your committee
every single vote twenty one on one side sixteen on the other side twenty
well republican sixteen democrats we know there's no politics involved
there's no nonpartisan and they really want to come up with a fair
answer on it and be fair to the president and the country and the world and
everybody home same thing grow up america come into the real world stop with
this sanctimonious constipated hypocrisy which is really what america's all
about and i guarantee you some of the same assholes that are sitting there
running these no smoking campaigns you know what it reminds me of remember
the scene in fatso where he goes to the uh... the doctor
and he's standing on the treadmill domdelewis the die doctor
and the doctor this crack doctor is standing there with a stethoscope and he's
smoking a cigarette while dom is and he's looking at his a watch and he's got
the stethoscope but it and he's a puffing away on a
bag it while domdelewis is doing the treadmill
same thing how many people involved in these no smoking campaigns and the
screaming and he'll be because it plays good with the public how many of these
people are puffing away right now got on those what they're smoking
that he smokes
maddy smokes that really hypocritical piece of crap maddy smokes you
heard oh my god he was smoking this is a no smoking zone mister u-s-hole
we're gonna blow so much goddamn smoking here it's gonna look like they just
elected new polka that's what we're gonna do
that's right just wait till tomorrow we got plans for you
i wouldn't be surprised if the show somehow doesn't get on tomorrow night
i'm not gonna tip my hat what we're gonna be doing in here tomorrow all of us
everybody in here and there will be nothing illegal about it but he'll ever know for
sure
probably fat you'll have to take a drug test over there on the third day by the
time we get done with this of course he's got so much crap in his system
what that would show up in that god
man i'm right enough again just relax okay i'm just
lighting up my night cigar from next
because i want to make sure that none of you out there smokes it cuck you know
and this is the this is the amusing part of the whole deal you go everywhere
else in the world they smoke and if they die they die but that's their
own they picked your own poison you go into the supermarket and there's all
these night trights and night traits and preservatives and chemicals
people are dying every day people are getting cancer like it's going on a
style in this country because everything is made for shelf life not for your
health it's big money it's big bucks they put it out there in the
shelf so it'll last a long time and in any time it's got all kinds of
crap in it that you're putting in your body and some of you're going to
die from cancer from it does that mean i'm gonna sit here and pontificate
oh whatever you do don't go out and eat the fill in the black don't eat
yeah that oh gee don't eat that whatever you do
by the way speaking of don't eat this or don't eat that all you stock market
experts out there with the markets having a pretty good day so far today we
underline the so far the Dow is up 101 the Nasdaq's up about 32 something
like that but all the experts out there what do i tell you these people don't
know what they're talking about any of them now the single one of them they
may know all the terms and all the ends and the out but as far as really
have any idea what they're telling you they're just a bunch of peddlers they just
make an air commission and they're selling you their sales holes
i can remember not too many months ago and everybody all these the
Boston market with the darling of all the stock experts oh yeah that's
going to be big it's only fifteen dollars a share
well yesterday Boston market declared a chapter eleven and they closed on
a hundred and seventy eight of their eleven hundred and forty three
homestyle Boston market restaurants including the one in plantation by the way
and guess what these stock which they were touting at fifteen as such a
bargain guess what Boston market is selling at right now
fifty cents a share oh my god that means if you would have bought if you would
invested a hundred and fifty thousand if you would have bought uh...
ten thousand shares at fifteen bucks a piece
is that right yeah that's right ten thousand shares would have been a hundred
and fifty grand that today that was just a few months ago that's a day would be
worth five hundred dollars five thousand dollars your hundred and fifty grand
would be worth five grand all right there you go another big tip from the
experts baby that hilton stock doing oh man am i getting ahead i think it
about that
at forty five at five sixty wq m if continuing with our theme of grow up
america which makes me want to uh...
go up on the russian thinking about it
davide once again you know this davide at the sunset and all he's an ass oh my
god talk about growing up
you know here here's this story about you know of course they're doing it to
put to boost up the excitement because we got to really mediocre teams that
were the worst teams in league last year so we have to have this big can
track controversy between the lightning and the panthers will be playing
friday night the opening game in the amacarena
so panthers a temp of players use racial slurs and gestures about peter or well
here's the new deal
this is a game where guys take sticks and whack each other over the head who
give each other guy other concussions who do permanent bodily damage to
each other
who do some of the most grotesque things to each other in the history of the human
god damn race
and now they're doing something even worse they're calling each other
name
that's right
you
yeah that's right we had that thing with christmas last year
you know good you
smarter
and so evidently a couple of lightning players are alleged to have had
Tucker and McCarthy okay standing McCarthy and dursy Tucker allegedly called
peter or well in ape and they were saying you
uh... king ape
at the exhibition game over their last Saturday and the panther players as they
went off the ice called jokka the merr is the coach of the temp of a lightning
a
which i say
array
because he is a
king frog is there any other kind no first that
he's a
fraud that jokka merr's
so they've had of course is just outrage this morning another one of our great
sports columns in his backwater horse ball town
and hl cantaloupe racism to continue
oh yeah that's right so with the theory that this could be teared into the
worst and bluddiest display of hockey Friday since lap shot i guarantee it'll be
a bad display of hockey all right but not because of violence or name calling
yes six and stones especially hot is not how that goes hockey sticks and
stones can break my bones but names are a bunch of crap is not the way that
thing goes
that's what they taught me was a kid growing up they said
hockey sticks and stones but uh... all of the calm people names is a bunch of
crap yeah right
as in your stupid bag whatever you are who cares
i mean what they hide you ought to run and hide you ought to be local with the
guide them uh... henry hide
man or what i want to call them just perfect for just ripping up into little
pieces and smithereens here about gary betman's got this big job to do now
because any McCarthy said this and christryman said that and this one yeah right
not only are they trying to kill each other out there in the ice
they're calling each other
names oh my god
how do we get a survive that
grow up america okay and stopping so uptight about everything
everything in this country they're uptight about no one we got all these
psychiatrists uh... making big bucks in this country
to only place in the world where everybody's got at least two or three
personal shrinks even at even at slot monica had a shrink that i ring
casserole bitch
that i was reading that stuff yesterday the good stuff
which i noticed not a bad guy that how should issue a committee here not
that got me hearing
don't confuse those twenty one republicans insisting democrats with any
uh... information because it's strictly a partisan bunch of horseball crap
president had an affair they tried to get everybody to welcome her up cover
is perhaps like every other human being in the world does
and now we got a big major investigation and can star is leaking and leaking
for the court to check that you're in okay
get a urine sample from can't start check it right away for the court
what he's smoking with his bull crap
and Henry hides it's up there with a straight face yesterday
well you know and of course then they want a passing this thing that they're
going to send out the full house oh yes we want to brought us we don't want
to have our hands tied like rob capitol we want to have the broadest possible
investigation here so we can go back to file gate and whitewater and travel gate
and gate gate and the yeah
even though after four and a half years and fifty million fifty five million
dollars now he couldn't find one goddamn thing to implicate clinton on any of
that stuff well we just just in case just in case something pops up not that
but just in case something sluggish across their desk we just want to keep it
open so that we have something else with even though this is totally non
partisan and they don't come anymore fair and judicious and that white hair
and we hide and then they sit there because they know that this hearing is on
television so they're all sitting there acting very diplomatic because they
want to give the appearance of being bipartisan and yet air be voted strictly
along political lines are they kidding anybody no anybody with an IQ larger than
their thumbnail no of course they're not a tremendous waste of time because we
live in a country where people refuse to fn grow up that's right that's why we
can't even that's why I have to say fn as an fn zivola junior because the fcc is
the word police to baby they're the one police because if he should say on a
year oh my god everybody in that whole world will take up right there on the
floor grow the hell off like you go to Europe and you hear these songs and they
got every word that's ever been invented and then you hear the American
version that comes over here or the videos and they all have to be sanitized they
have to take the f*** words out because we know I don't offend anybody because
our people are emotional cripples they've been raised and trained to be
emotional cripples and this whammy thing let me say it again if you think I'm
finished with this you ain't heard nothing yet and I know the show they're
gonna take it off I don't really care is it gonna change my life is it gonna
change my income one dime for the next eight months no fact after that is gonna
make a difference to me really when you come right down to it no I'm making
any money really when you come right down that no and I mean the trend is
response we've had on the show since we've been doing that TV show I think
maybe it's having an inverse effect so it's not gonna change my life when I
older that's not the point this isn't sour grapes because everything else
they put on there has turned a crap anyway so why should we be any different
anybody any jackass can get out a bunch of old video tapes in our Reels of
Mesh and the monsters and throw that on there in K Pasa USA from 100 years
ago and throw that on the year and get a two or three share with oh yeah there's
Mesh I recognize that wow that's heavy duty Maddie you're real genius he smokes
talk about a hypocrite man that would be my like my sitting here said oh don't
smoke and puff and cigar smoke in your face don't smoke it's bad for your kids
they don't kill you oh yeah I mean it's okay for me because I'm an old fart I'm
gonna die anyway why do you do when you kid yourself here don't be smoking
Brad warrior how about educating people how about giving them information about
the food about the water they drink about the stuff they stick in their
purse and then let them make their own stupid decision
how come I can't keep this thing lit I think he's chumped
oh there it goes let's go no I can't keep sucking I can't keep it lit because I'm
wasting all this time talking here that is a really impediment to keep on your
stony lit there's a message for all your kids out there okay don't come up
harassing you there you go don't forget pizza about six to eight o'clock
tonight racial slurs at the hockey games what are we gonna do about that huh
what are we gonna do about that you boys better be nice to each other out there
and don't be calling each other no names you crazy old fraud that was my
favorite Jacques de merriss as I'll stand by Tucker and McCarthy I was called a
being frog when I left the ice by some Panther players but I overlooked it I
wasn't happy with it but I didn't report it to the league he would report it
to the league that they called him a fraud give me a break it would be like us
calling Denise Paz van a fucking frog or something like that I feel really really
too bad you're still a fucking frog and a dumb one to boot you're a dumb
fucking frog how do you oh gee we're pouring that one into the league you went
too far in that one is this country ever gonna grow up no chance no chance so
let's hear today from all these people that are like very righteous about
that I want to tell us about how marijuana is evil and terrible and illegal and
is gonna what the store we're gonna have revert madness again and that
mad he's probably right because I'm sure before the day is that we'll have
somebody giving us a song and a dance about that just wait till tomorrow you
won't smell that you ain't sniff nothing yet okay we haven't burned anything yet
here here's our first call this is the first call I've been on a role here for
fifty five minutes these phones ought to be spoken by now because we sure are
all but I got to do a break hey I'll get to the goddamn calls when I feel like
the way these last five shows have gone man I wouldn't wish it on God damn god damn
I'm hearing the way this audience has been these last a few days five six seven

development's last the two three weeks I would say and it's getting worse it's like the the
world markets man getting worse by the minute we have we have the alienation of affections in
date county not only can't we get like a real caller in bokeh who is the noja
paracetura in a real major asshole like that one guy who monitors in a show every day with a
scratchy voice ought to go back on a subway and get out of here but we got a day problem that is

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18t wireless line in date here's deer field hello
hey niel yes sir how you doing okay good listen I was wondering I just saw a commercial here on
whammy about your they were doing a spot on your program uh-huh for your program
we're in the spot on it yeah commercial anyways Joel wipe it off anyways what they said is they said
you can see them at 10 30 only right 30 p.m. why did it used to be at 9 30 and 10 30 yeah now it's 10 30
only now it's 10 30 only yeah whenever they feel like putting it on that's the way it's been since
the beginning since we began this escapade with the high school uh-television whenever they feel
like putting it on that's what they do I mean I'm not going to fill in an hour on Sunday night
they stick it on their Sunday now they got football shows to stick on there they stick football
shows on there we're out unbelievable yeah this is the way that it's been going on because the
thing is so even if you found a show on that station that you like the odds of you being able to
find it again like a couple weeks later are slimmed and on right right in the same time slot right
understand uh-huh let me ask you question I want to ask your opinion on something else um how do you
feel about um a mission inspection for the state of Florida no it's a joke it's a scam to raise a
few bucks that's all yeah they stick a little pipe up your uh rectum and that's it and they give me
the ten dollars and have a great life we need auto inspection in the states or I've been saying it
for a hundred years exactly we don't have all these people with ball-pair and their little
beat up old brown toyotas out there have no insurance and no headlights and no brakes exactly but
this is Florida pal unreal no because I mean we we have some uh me and my family have some thoughts
about you know moving back up north I know you've mentioned Canada before my my wife is from Toronto
yeah and she's born in Toronto and everything and you mentioned the picture oh how could you live
here if you're from Toronto how did nobody survive in this place well the thing is that she's
from the I was born in the states but I have family that live in Montreal and we're
deeply considering probably after my uh all this one finishes elementary school we're thinking
about just packing it and going up there up to much we all no up up up to Toronto oh that'd be a
good move and definitely the right direction believe me yeah I mean I mean I think things are a little
more secure there than they are here a little more secure and the people get along there and it's a great
city and there's a lot to do and uh it's a real place with a real downtown and uh it's a real
living and breathing place that's it that's it okay pal good thank you thank you okay open line and

funny because he was just fussing it got yeah so anyway the next time I stopped he was getting on

little bit straight ironic yeah yeah a little bit ironic and the second thing I wanted to ask you

eatus anyway um it was all harby junior who reported about three weeks ago like
so called breathlessly to tell us that they was definitely uh John Henry had bought the team and the
press conference that they was who announced it and I go on here and I say that and then it makes me
look like a total fool here on the fourth station there was a verbal agreement and a handshake
when I called you yeah I had a handshake like a Greg read handshake does it mean anything
no of course not just ask George he'll tell you about that ask Rimmer he'll tell you
you asked your buddy asked him not to put this on the air it went on the air ask him
did he tell you not to put it on the air I don't recall no okay oh yeah he doesn't recall
you don't remember a camera why would he tell me it was actually here okay
what good is all I'm moving along what difference does it make he's buying the team any way or
we're just way ahead of your time as usual what are you gonna be at the next game that's the next
hockey game yeah whatever the next home game is the twenty uh first or third or whenever the
all right I'm gonna give you some things right there all right well I'll see you there I will talk
you about what happens and you will craft your pants really the truth you remember when I told
you about the McLean incident about somebody not liking his foul language right and Rimmer
is in yeah I'll forget about Rimmer he just he's on the payroll forget about him he told me I was
insane and then the next night it's on if you're really gave me a look that could kill yeah okay
what about it what about it to be true to that it was denied for how many weeks later okay
so what are you trying to do redeem your reputation now I don't know I'm the great of the
panther insider the uh the Wayne I think insider I have my sources yeah and when when I tell you
about it you're gonna craft your pants okay you know that's a four-time I hope I bring a lot
onto our bed bring extra carton it depends that night I'm gonna bring you an Allison with me she's
gonna be my date at the game listen first of all I've got a movie review yeah do not waste your
money and see that Robin Williams I know something I would never see a Robin Williams movie other
other than good morning Vietnam this man has never been in a good movie in his life he's a funny
guy doing his you know rolling on a stage routine but this man that gets the worst movie of
anybody I've ever seen you didn't like it you must have a thing for a mad demon you know
on the up on the plane the plane I watched with the 10 minutes of it it was crap that didn't
can't act his way out of a paper sack he did it a putt a sleeper I want you to promise and I'll
think of a movie that was even worse than that that he was in what was the other movie that he
was in before that where he was the young lawyer the preppy lawyer what was it I don't remember
okay hello hello Neil yes sir how are you okay I was uh responding to your
speech or calls from the city of Miami no not from the city of Miami from date counties a lot
more than a city of Miami there's Kendall there's sweet water there's coral gables there's a few
other joints I guess we're in bad shape there's ghouls Naurangia I tried calling
this game yeah I was listening I was listening to I tried calling yesterday West Kendall
Phil Henry on KFI and I had I had told them that uh that you told us you know what
we're just finishing the work for are you sure yeah yeah I was listening on the internet and uh
I let them know I was listening to five sixty and they said oh you mean to you know you mean
Neil Rogers and uh I'm like uh yeah and I was I was trying to get on on gear with Phil Henry and
they don't accept any calls from the city of Miami right that's right they take no calls from
down here because the people see the people that call from down here they want to talk to Phil
about when he was here and the people in LA and the people listening to KFI have no interest in that
so Phil being the wise man that he is then wanting to hear any of that right it's like when
these guys call here from Tampa and want to talk about Bob Lasseter or the guy that called
me yesterday from Orlando that wants to talk about people on the erupt up there that nobody
here ever heard of him couldn't care less about so you know you appreciate the fact that people
like your show and they want to call but they want to talk about stuff that nobody now and cares about
right yeah so I mean if you're gonna call and talk to Phil then you know don't let him know
you're from Miami and don't talk about his you know Miami show exactly talk about whatever he's
talking about right uh which at that point just happened to be uh some kind of fried chicken
recipe right that he said Jeffrey Dahmer wrote up all you can eat Jeffrey Dahmer Negro right
okay have a great day pal thanks for the good news uh well why did I turn my head what did I
turn my head sideways there for just a second that was the bad mistake every line on the board

pretty good night you know see he he's burned me too many times although he's he was and I love
Robin Williams don't get me wrong it's just that in movies he he picks the worst scripts and he gets
involved in the crappiest movies and he's just not a movie guy that wasn't bad I think that was
the one with him and Sally Field I think was in there yeah and that was pretty fine where he
here the other day when uh done the dolphin game manage wasn't doing you know the little things he
