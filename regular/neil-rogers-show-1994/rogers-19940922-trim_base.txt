and uh of course they're all listening right now because they're monitoring naturally this this
is the way they spend their hours is exposing themselves to things that they cannot stand that they
don't like because they're out there to protect everybody else they're out there to censor they're
out there to dictate they're out there to decide what can be on and what should not be on and to
try to tell sponsors where they should spend their money i'll be honest with you i'm looking at
this thing i see more spots than quarters got pills and like i said how are you doing those 13

chris go it's this go we have an open line it's in date seven five one nine four six three now
you know i come in this morning and i'm looking around i thought there's something bizarre in this
place something really strange and i see all these cobwebs and i thought cheer i thought that
berry corn came in and cleaned this room out and there's all these make-believe cobwebs up around
the tv like a gigantic spider web and then i go up in the front of the building and there's all
these decorations and all this stuff and i'm not sure whether the screen or eat uh tecita banana
and it turns out that it's uh our receptionist what is her name do we know what her name is
a shell misshell i don't know who she is hey we change receptionist more often than most of you
people change underwear i guarantee you that so anyway the deal is that she put all the stuff up

tanya's out there wrestling with their conscience he's doing his one to three beauty uh nioh
yeah i'm from chicago so i never really heard uh howard yeah and i listened uh twice because i
didn't want to make uh uh any rash judgments yes he was terrible yeah it said very sad
and i don't know why he was requested in a way i feel really cheated too because in his good days
you know howard was great and the and when they you know all the rumors that he was going to be on
here i thought well god there'll be something that once in a while uh you know you'll listen to
and get it be really funny it's just it's just not it's like promising somebody a banana split
and bringing them one scoop of the watery vanilla ice cream you know what i'm saying it's just
they're so long and so boring and the the the 13-minute commercial breaks are going to be the
kiss of death on there i don't know what those people are thinking about that show is structured so
poorly i don't i i can't imagine what they're thinking in addition to which i can't imagine anybody
in his right mind buying spots they're going to be lost like in a in a minefield of commercials
well i love rick and suds good nioh i have one shameless request yes sir i don't really miss the
ball games but i do miss harry yeah and anything you could play from harry i'd appreciate

that ron jeremy is fatter because they're both like walking fur balls but like i was starting to
say about service it's twelve thirty five at w i o d the payphone challenge news from around
the planet and a whole lot more it's rick and suds weekday mornings right here
hey enough with the panthers already when the hell does the base balls is the beginning anyway
huh cyber genics is the comprehensive weight loss program that will have you looking great in 14
weeks but who can wait that long you need the weight loss program that'll drop weight in

a four foot long razor sharp sword that allows you to trim pounds in no time the how well how much
weight you want to lose i don't know ten pounds and what would you say your leg weighs all from
here to here yeah i guess i do i say about ten there you go you're at your ideal weight in
seconds and it's weight you'll keep on unlike those other yo yo plans saber genics by some today
1240 at w i o d must be getting really slow at my old age because it's just i'm looking at this
thing from the american family association that was sent to bowl green during the break and why
did i notice this the first time i'll probably because i was so blown away by the tremendous number
of signature on the thing in addition to which i said 37 five of them i see are in the same household
so now we're down to like 32 five of them in the same house and they don't even have the same last
name i wonder what they're all doing in there in hollywood on least street no less my mother used to
live on least street in hollywood i bet she knows these people she can talk some sense in them or
make them some lots of ball soup but anyway on the populace party of florida which is where this
thing is sent with these petitions guess what's in sygmy or what symbol is in the upper right hand
corner of their stationary i'll give you 75 guesses in the first 125 don't count
it's a Confederate flag boys oh it's a good old Confederate flag
so we got a bunch of uh uh we got a bunch of yahos but you're written ex that want to get us off
there well they don't want to get off the air do they they just want to clean up they just want to
tell us what say they just want to dictate they want to get together like hassle everybody else so we
can all be just like them look at that the populace party of florida brown word county chapter with a
PO box in dania no less and there is the good old Confederate flag right next to it yeah all right you
just pick it baby we don't care if it never heals just keep picking oh my god can't you just see
that little geek up there in the tree with that little banjo by the down down down down down down
I can just see it right now in hollywood on least street there he is i reckon that's the same one you
know he looks just the same yet got kind of like one ear where his ass used to be and one eye where
his no enabled used to be that's him well you know they're incess that in breeding after so many
centuries man it starts having its effect it starts setting in real good but y'all come back now
the populace party of florida with a freaking Confederate flag under letterhead this is astonishing it's
shocking here's pop it on a starline hello hey nil yeah what's up how you doing sick guy from
our book a soul my off he stole your thing yeah well maybe we can get you back for me yeah now that
guy Jeff gluey is doing two years that's why you have her Jeff Galuli is in well it's he'll
probably write a book in there probably a tv movie yeah he's doing 18 months that's not too bad
yeah speaking of fat retard tank over yeah yeah um he uh I heard him like Monday and he's
getting oh my god he's playing over again I'm gonna fucking throw up yeah he's being trained by
the strength coach of Miami University and like you were saying he trained for what for the pancake
eating contest yeah but uh yeah he lost 25 but he uh found about 50 I guess because I saw him in the
ESPN he looked the same I think I was it I think it was at the slots in Vegas I think he lost
it was carrying all the quarters around in his pocket all right well in closing wait says it go
back swallow oh okay that's kind of hard to swallow we have an open line in brown or five two four
and there's Ryan who of course is never hard and she's hard to swallow I'll tell you that
his disgusting bitchy wife stop bitching already this is the one where she confronts him
about that magazine again oh oh he's looking at that magazine and there's a vicki in a centerfold
neck it is a j bird that's Nina the wife I don't want to know her name I want to know the names
of characters that I like I don't want to know from Nina or the Pinta or the Sinta Marinta okay
I know I've told this before and nobody believes me but I had a I had a teacher in sixth grade I
think it was she used to call the three she used to call those three ships the Nina the Pinta and
the Sinta Marinta which I guess either she was a lot dumber than I thought she was or she figured
we were really dumb little kids and that's the only way we could remember them not the Santa Maria
but the Sinta Marinta so and maybe it was what the hell do we know anybody ask Chris
let's do Miami hello yeah hi Neil how you doing pretty good sir two things one real quick you were
asking about John Wayne Bob and he was actually on Howard show live this I know it I didn't hear
that part but I know he was on well you didn't miss my I understand that he was he was like in
the background while they were talking to Ron Jeremy and all the other Harry Pornow guys well they
started with John Wayne Bob at the guys got an IQ of a dark yeah he has no personality oh
unbelievable yeah anyway what I really wanted to call you about was was this business about the
education they were talking about my wife is a high school teacher yeah and just started this
year and she brought home some stuff the other day that absolutely blew my mind he asked an essay
question and the stuff they put down on paper honest to God in our generation would have been
like a fourth grader yeah it was just mind boggling I can't believe that American education has
has the worst the worst you know everything is relative so I realized there are countries where
there are more illiterate people but they have an excuse with all the money and all the resources
that we have and all the money we pee down the drain on garbage we have no excuse here so I would
say relatively speaking we have the worst education of any of the industrialized countries in the world
the absolute worst when when you look when you look at how the policies of inclusion have have come
to where they are today and I agree with them but what they've done is they've they've lowered
the standards for everybody yeah so that nobody comes out bright right it's it's just mind boggling
the dumbing of the public right that woman the that letter of the editor was right on target it's
with dumbing down man it's just it's scary yeah it's really and of course the powers that be the
business of people in the politician all all the real power brokers that's the way they like it man
keep them real stupid manipulate them use that tube to put everything in their brain and brain wash
them and it's working like a charm oh yeah well maybe there's some hope but I don't know where
not in this country see yeah good luck to us pali right thanks for your uplifting call now he's
right on target he's absolutely right I know it's it's the real downer we don't want to get people
down we're here to give people a chuckle or two we don't want to you know dwell on these things
because we're not going to solve it here on the damn radio right all we got to do is call up the
populous party or Florida and the aFA they'll straighten all you bastards out I tell you that right
now ain't that right man well I saw that Confederate flag and and I'm sitting here looking at it like
wait a minute am I looking at that thing wrong and no I'm not looking at that wrong it's Dixie baby
let's sing some Dixie huh let's stand up pledge allegiance say a couple of prayers and then do
that Dixie thing go out and shoot a couple of minority people oh man 1247 well I was going to say
you know I was going to pick one out but in their case they don't sing a lot for example I noticed
on their literature here they do have one very small page very poorly put together petitioned
drive begins hundreds of people are supporting the new in capital letters new petition effort to
repeal Tampa's homosexual ordinance which began August 25 1994 the meeting to kick off the
petition drive picture at left look at those Yahoo's was well attended of course it doesn't say how
many what is that like 40 or probably 35 that number keeps coming back again some examples of
complaints which have been filed by paparra line up page four for more information call you out of
you know okay there it is so they don't just single anybody I'll tell hang just about anybody
they can get their hands on of course only figuratively speaking we're saying right maybe 1248 at
the 70 I would be this afternoon and two don't miss Phil Hendry every one of them right here give it
people are doing a lot of things with penises lately oh god we asked Eunice Nisquad of

here's 30 minutes of spots this is a true story when i first came to wion z and replaced Alan
Burke the dean may he rest in peace at night and come to find out from his producer that what he
would do depending on what the movie was in how surley he was on a given night sometimes he would
like get to rambling and he would uh reading his poetry whatever the hell he was doing and didn't
want to take his breaks for the spots so he would like back up a whole hours worth of spots maybe
they had like 10 minutes worth of spots in that hour 11 minutes whatever was he would back up all
the breaks until the end of the hour and it would get to be about 12 minutes before the hour and he
would like have the producer run all the spots and then go into the CBS news at the top of the
hour excellent formatics baby when i'm on the air nobody else needs to be on the air dummy do we
still have that thing one thing about this rack over here poor roger would be rolling in his grave

report and don't you forget it
er
ah
right in
and you're
I'm work to all you went to see
Your pal Joey can turn a screw
Now you're in jail with your own TV crew
Take a big ol' screw for money
Ame what you gonna do
Joey, but a fool too
Work, work, now you're in jail with all the money too
I can see why you think that you got it made
Pull the wall over our eyes, a media shriek
Now I can see that it isn't only you, it's you all three
It's all money making try to sphere a sea
Grab a big ol' stack of money Ame what you gonna do
Joey, but a fool too
Take a big step of jail and all the money too
Won't you, won't you
What do they want from him? He didn't do nothing
He didn't do nothing, all the money left alone
One 19 and W-W-I-D
That's the amazing part of what's going on today
And most people are too stupid to realize it
The people who become famous are the ones who are notorious because they're so grotesque and such assholes
Whether it's the Jews, whether it's Joey, but a Foucault and Aimee Fisher
Whether it's Tanya Harding and the Jeff Galuli
These are the people who like John Bobbitt
Who after he had his thing, he was sliced off
Still got busted again like beating up some women
Because he's just basically an angry kind of a guy
Somebody who sliced yours off, you'd probably be a little angry about it too
So what's wrong, he takes it out on some bitch
I'm sorry
Here's that was a very bad thing to say right before this lady in Cooper City
Hello
Boy, that's your wife
That was a bad segue
Well, it was just a joke, just a joke
Okay, I'll accept that
Of course
I'd rather spend an evening with you than how it's done
Okay
And I'm a lady
Yeah
Yeah, okay
Well, you'd be with me would be interesting, not too exciting, but interesting
Well, that's because I enjoy this, you make me laugh
Well, that's good, okay
So, a couple of questions
You know, I was busy with the high holidays here and I didn't read the paper, watched the news
Oi
But I thought the casinos were in and yesterday I think in the hair of their face
What do you mean you thought they were in?
I thought everybody would both of them this time
And I guess I'm...I guess I should have
Why they had another poll yesterday?
Yeah, in the paper, it would be the yesterday or today saying that 56% are against them
Yeah
And I think...
But they haven't even started their campaign yet, which is going to start...
No, they're starting today, I think
Right, in a day or two they're going to be starting their big push
And now they're going to start brainwashed, I mean educating the public and getting to understand the reality of things
Well, I sure hope they wake up
And I know you'll believe you're best
I'm doing...Listen, I'm going to vote 400 times on election day and everybody I know I hope they vote at least two, three times
Well, I'm going to vote two, so tell everybody before
I'm going to do it
It's about time
I like your outlook on different subjects
Do you have any outlook on their kid with all the transplants today?
Did the state is paying half a million dollars for it?
I didn't hear that
Oh, that's been in the news for a couple of years that his mother couldn't afford it
And the state said that they wouldn't pay for it
And then I think it went to the Supreme Court and made it one of courts, we have to pay for it
Yeah
Well, maybe at the same time we'll just put crime boy in the electorate here
We won't have to pay for him anymore so we can make up for it
Have a great day
Hey, listen, I love Luis Miguel, I demand to me
Well, I almost stuck my finger on
And I miss his five minute to two concert every day
Well, this way you can listen in the privacy of your own thing all day
One minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, five to two
Okay, hang on
Thank you
She's telling me what to do
Okay, she's on five
Hey, listen, I played him the other day when I came back from the concert
It was a beautiful thing
And I still think about that El LaDia Camercatus, man
That was a, oh, that guy with a big Italian accordion
There's nothing like a big Italian accordion
And it was just a nice thing
Of course, like I said, those Mexicans, they're just a little unruly a few of them
I mean, most of the people are like 1,500 people jam-packed into that room like Mexican jumping beans
And all it takes is like a half a dozen of unruly people who have no consideration for anybody else
And of course, with my luck, they happen to be at the table right next to me center stage
Sit down already, get out of here
I mean, when they got to get the Carson County Sheriff's people and they drag some of these people out
That should give you an idea, but it only went on for like the first 40 or 50 minutes of a two hour concert
So, what can I tell you?
And of course, by that time, it's sung like 90% of everything that I wanted to see in here
And like, you know, get out of the way, I want to take a look at this guy
Let's say, you know, can that be felt?
No, sit-du, it was just, it was beautiful
So I hope to see October 7th that we got, we got, so finally we're getting to that part of the year when there's a little stuff going on now
We got October 4th, we got the overall, let's start first things first
This Tuesday the 27th, we got the first Panther game of the year, it's the only exhibition game at home this year against the lightning
So even though it's an exhibitionist game still, we got a, we got a team that we hate like Poison
We got to pack that place Tuesday, I'll be there with bells on
Then the 4th of October, the flyers will be here opening regular season game of the Panthers
That's on Tuesday, Thursday night is, who the hell we play on Thursday? I think the St. Louis Blues, that's right
Then on the, the next night Friday the 7th is the night I'll be there with the Louis Miguel concert at the night center
He'll be here the 6th, 7th and 8th
And Saturday afternoon we got the Ranger game and Poppano Park opens Friday the 7th
So my first day of the night will be the 8th, oh my god, heavy duty
See? Sooner or later if you wait long enough in this boring God for sake in toilet of a place that we live in
Sooner or later things come in good bunches
123 at WIOD
Hi, I'm Bob Green, General Manager of WIOD Radio, encouraging you to listen to the Phil Hendry show every afternoon 2-6 right here on WIOD
I don't agree with everything he says, but excuse me
The payphone challenge, news from around the planet and a lot more
It's Rick and Sons, weekday mornings right here
WIOD
So, where's the Davey Gravy line?
127 at WIOD, maybe Davey's up at Delaware Ohio for a little brown chug
Tom the accountant, how you doing Tom?
Hi my friend, it's tax here, you won't believe it, it must be 58,000 people here
How's the weather?
Gorgeous, absolutely magnificent
That's what we like
It's like 80 degrees, the race is fine, the track is fast, it's a standard
Now what time are these eliminations going to go off?
I mean what time is the first elimination, you know Tom?
Probably by now or from now
Great, so in other words by the time we get to the final I'll be home to be able to see it on TV
That is correct, hold on, I'll give you Tomy House
Great
Hello
Hey Tomy, how you doing?
Neil, how you doing?
Great, fantastic, now our friend Tom there what he did is he faxes me three pages
Two of them are the same page, so instead of having like all the eliminations here
I don't have the race that you're in, now I assume
So it really gives me an opportunity to have an intelligent conversation with you
But magical Mike is the horse you train, Michael is chancest still driving am I right?
And is that I guess is going to be the one that Falcons future is in?
Yes
And that's the horse to beat?
Him and historic, yes
And historic
Now how's magical Mike been racing last three four starts?
He won his last start a week and a half ago at Toyota 52 and one
Very good
Beautiful
And what post have you got?
Two hole
Well there you go not bad
He had helped on the inside and I have a small traction
Yeah you better believe it, I'm looking at these other two and of course everybody
Cam's card charts still going to be the favorite in the rich get richer he draws the rail as if he needs the extra help with John Campbell
So he's going to be almost a certain lock in at first in that one elimination
Exactly
And then I'm looking at the other one of course Pacific Rock and another Bill Robinson horses in there
But I'm looking at this three horse slick pavement with my friend Dave Palone
This horse qualified at the Meadows on a 16th of September wins by 22 lengths
52 and four with the last half and 54 and four
Yeah it's thick
Sometimes horses will do that when they're not in against anyone looking at him you know
So who knows I mean it's very good though
So what do you think on the half mile track because I know that of course from the rail we got a different story
Because back in the cane Cam's card chart through the five hole and he got parked a mile and of course the
Quentin finished fifth but from the rail can anybody beat him?
It doesn't seem to be that way no
No one could beat him I don't think in the first he anyway
Okay and what about in the other he with the Pacific Rock and slick pavement?
Uh, Pacific Rock and I think is the best in there because they got a horse with the rail too
That's going to control the race
Expensive scooter with Campbell
And then going to come Pacific Rock and they'll probably be sitting one too so that's tough there
As usual Bill Robinson's always one too and then in your heat?
Uh, well hopefully us everything's going on fold in the first turn just to
Heat that's tough is maybe more tougher Colts than one heat
What post position Falcon future draw?
He's got the three or the four he's got the three I think
Uh-huh
The storage four I think or five so they're all all right in the ball game in the first turn
So you got a fast track a beautiful day a big crowd time says and all I can suggest you is to keep
At least one finger in here because we don't want Roger Houston breaking your eardrums
Exactly
Okay good luck Tommy
Very good
Okay good talk and do
Okay
Neil
Yes
Just want to let you know Jackie Moe won the first race day 2240
But did you have him Tom?
Yes
All right now we're talking
Yes
$118 perfecta
Outstanding you sounded like he had a smile on your push
Okay well listen good luck plunge your brains out and thanks for getting Tommy for us
Okay see you soon
Okay
Our friend Tom the accountant who's a real harness racing nut every year he goes up there to Delaware
A hide little brown jug
And that's good our buddy Tommy Houghton who's got magical miconairid boy
Almost feel like I was there but like I said Roger Houston keep those earplugs in don't pop the plugs until the race is over
Because he is screaming and puking your maniac Roger here's highly a hello
No sitoo
No sitoo
Beto yo
You're whispering too low
Hey Neil
Can't hear you
How you doing my friend
What's wrong with your phone
I'm the guy with a crappy phone day
Oh man can you help me get that I remember
Oh yeah and it's gonna happen again today
This is the guy you wanted to see the yesterday
Yeah
And then you said crap on the ear
Please Neil
Did you say crap are you the guy that said crap yesterday
Yes
You are
Apologize profusely
Big for forgiveness
I didn't hang up on him
Cross you no you know he got cut off
I did he thinks I hung up on him
No I put you on hold
I know I know I know
And what happened
It was my fault
It was your fault
Boy you sound like really want repentance here you want forgiveness okay
I told you about it
Okay kiss my ring
Hang on pal
Thank you
I'm tired because it happens again your S.O.L.
Hang on he's on to get him real quick because his phone blows
Oops
Yeah
Whoops there it is
We have an open line on the purple line at pound I.O.D.
My God they're doing it at Delaware Ohio
Little Brown Jug Pompa
It'll park will be reopening for the fall meeting a couple of weeks
And Luis Miguel coming
Well it's just all of a sudden life is almost worth living here
Almost underline the almost
But we got the Confederate flag over here
They poppulous party of Florida in the AFA
Who seem to be kissing cousins there together up there in the tree
They're they're picking and grinning man and they got they got a plan up there sleeve
Of course you can't see their sleeve because it's underneath the sheets
Let's go to our vital on the starline hello
Neil
Yes sir
What happened to maybe
We're doing it
Couple of things
Yes
First of all I was so happy to see
Very swishers
Picket his nose and Jerry Jones
I think they're gonna win
And Louis
Yes I agree wholeheartedly
Let's get out of here
I was saying go detried baby go you lines
How sickening are those guys
Yeah I would have been very upset because I went to bed in the third quarter
And lines were head I think 20 do a seven at that point something like that
And I'd have been really psychotic if I had to you know
Had a sit through Dallas making a big comeback
And then thinking they were gonna escape with at least a tie
But Mitch Mitch nearly blew it he under threw a couple of guys
He nearly blew it but they hung on
He looked pretty good the part of the game I saw
Yeah but towards the end he looked terrible
Yeah
Oh he looked but you can tell he was rattled
But second of all in that
Luckily you don't get to read the Palm Beach post
But there was an article by a guy called John Neese
Oh the guy deserves to be on a missing food label
About what?
Saying why gambling is a bad bet
Oh yeah Florida
Oh sure
Oh my god it was 60
I mean he's stupid
Oh no wait a minute
That's the same guy that writes for the Sun Sentinel
You mean Jack Neese?
Jack Neese
Yeah that's a guy NEASE I read that the other day
Oh okay
Yeah they got that out of the Sun Sentinel there
I guess he just writes the one propaganda piece
And they're gonna print it in papers all over the state
Oh it's a lot easier that way
So you were lucky enough to read it
Yeah
Alright was that pathetic or what?
Awful just said really tragic
Just another mouth piece for all these selfish bastards
You want to keep everything to themselves
And that's it that's the name of the game
What do you think of the chance?
Because the seminoles
They're not gonna do anything until the vote comes back
That's right and it
That's the deal man like I said before
Either we get it or the Indians are gonna get it
Either we get all the benefit, we get the revenue
Or just give it to them
That's the choice
I mean one way or the other
It's gonna be here whether these the antithols like it or not
So they can make up their mind if they want to reap some benefits
Or if they just want to hand it over to the Indians
Maybe I'm gonna vote how many times can we vote?
It's make times we want?
72 I think
Right I'm gonna vote 72 and throw my kids
Okay
See you, Aasticae
Good luck to us baby
November the 8th
Vote early and often for Casino gambling
And vote for Governor Walkenlotton man
Because anybody that pops pro-zac all day can't be all bad
Not that he's good but look at the opposition
Talk about chilling, talk about right wing, talk about Confederate flags
Talk about the antithol, talk about repression
We're talking about the Bushman baby
Never been too big on Bush, I gotta be honest with you
135 at WIOD
This afternoon at two don't miss Phil Hendry
Every one of him right here
Earned belapel
WIOD
Get Bush
Hey, you're mad
It's bad, it's bad
It's good, it's good
You're made to cry
What I saw on the news is hard to believe Michael Jackson just married Melissa Marie's a weirdo
Woohoo
Baby that's no lie
Because of their one thing that she don't need it some more tabloid publicity with the weirdo
He's a weirdo
I guess that I don't understand
Though she won a man in man
This guy ain't lovin' not on the way
The guy ain't like you and me
He ain't got no dinky
But I just cannot turn my head
I really think he's gay
Well my stomach turns
He's a girl in men with a plastic nose
Probably prancers round in a pantyhose
He's a weirdo
He's a weirdo
Well now be in dead hands
So bad cause he won't ever get to call me dead
He's a weirdo
I'm kinda glad I died
He's a weirdo
You didn't die Elvis, we know you're in the federal witness protection program
That's the whole thing about that plane and all that stuff
And the Miami connection we know all about that
How you doing Elvis? You're out there somewhere baby
So anyway like I said at the beginning of the show
If you got $40, $50 million to pay everybody off, keep everybody as mouth shut
And all of a sudden their memory starts just failing real bad
They get like lock jaw
What are we with that's all about?
Here's Kendall, hello
Hello
Yes sir
Yeah, first of all I can't believe you keep up this pace five days a week
I know it's frightening, isn't it? It's frantic, frenetic
I don't think anybody realizes how hard it is what you do
It is very hard in the show too
And the show too
If I just had a few more 13, 14 minute commercial breaks in between
I can get like a second win you know
I feel like I want you to do
Yeah
What if you could help me?
I've been trying to give a donation to Camilla's house for three weeks
I can't get return phone calls and all that
Do you know anybody else that is working with a homeless that I could work with?
The Miami Rescue Mission downtown which I don't have the number but that's one
Daily bread food bank
Daily bread food bank is a great, very good charity
Daily bread food bank
Which I'm sure if you call 411 I got the number
Now with the Vietnam veterans we have money we want to give the name of a boy that died
And he used to work at homeless
And the other thing was I sent some letters into your station from the Clark-Eck Club
And wanted to do some work with the homeless
Oh right yeah I got to talk to Steve Nichol back about that right
Okay
That's a good idea
Alright, appreciate it
So I'll just wait to hear from you
We'll be back to you
Okay thanks a lot
Bye-bye
Open line in day at 751 and one on a purple line pound IUD
If you have said it to one that's the one line that just still a little on the anemic side
Stick some iron in that baby man
Stick with the iron
Here's Miami hello
Hello
Yes sir
Aineel how you doing?
Great
Hey have you heard about 80s one of their most prominent weapons against the US troops when they invaded
That island down there?
What was that jerk beef?
No no no no this is here
It's called Oliander powder
Oliander
Oliander powder
Is that like Oliander New York?
Yes
Yeah what the stuff does is if anybody who breathes the stuff in
It incapacitates them for 60 hours two and a half days
Wow
The US troops don't know about this stuff down there
Oliander?
Oliander powder
Ask any Haitian voodoo priest and he will tell you it's true and they all believe it
The voodoo priests?
Any voodoo any person that's well versed in the voodoo religion
Yeah I'm a lady
They will tell you Oliander powders for real
They will prove that that believe breathes this stuff
It incapacitates them for 60 hours two and a half days
Yeah
And they'll do anything that the Haitians tell them to do
And you know they want to use this
Oh wait a minute so in other words it'll make somebody do anything you tell them to do
Basically it can't be incapacitated but they're kind of sad
Well let's forget about the Haitians that where do we get some of this stuff
We need it
Because I can think of a lot of people I'd like to give just a little powder on that
That would be beautiful
Right
Well do anything you want for two and a half days
What's that?
I see two and a half days sounds like a pretty interesting amount of time
A lot of rest time
You could accomplish your hell of a lot in that period of time
I know but it's supposed to be for real
I have a good source that told me about this stuff down there
That this guy knows the stuff about the voodoo religion
Well you better call up Jimmy Carter and tell him to watch this behind
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah and before I go up the line I want to call somebody a douspec
Okay go ahead
It's down to my, you're a douspec
Oh!
Okay see ya
Take a bowler
We have an open now like a BC powder
See every time I think of that I think a redneck
That's bad
Why do I think a red because of their spots probably
Their spots are always real Yahoo those BC powder
Take a powder
See there I go again with that thing about southerners
And that deep southern accent
I always take a Yahoo I'm sure there's some very bright people from the deep south
I haven't ever met any although Julian Bond and Barbara Jordan there we go again
And anybody else we can take out who's from the deep south
Who's really bright, articulate no?
There must be one somewhere
No we'll find one someplace
I just don't come across him
Here's Miramar hello
Neil
Yes sir
How you doing?
Great
I have a print shop in Miramar
Yes
And we just finished printing 100,000 flyers
Things to vote yes for gambling
Oh!
Beauty
And we've been actually printed 20,000 before that
And we've been passing them out on the weekends
And we've got like a little newsletter on the bottom
And a lot of the information that we've been putting on the flyer
I've got a lot of ideas from when I saw you on the Kennel Toyota show
Right
And from this into your radio show
And I want you to know that you know we're doing our part to
Beautiful
This is something that you're just doing on your own?
On our own
Great
Outstanding
Because I agree with every issue that you've sent so far about the gambling
Every issue
Gotta have it man
Gotta have it it's our only hope
It's the only light at the end of the long dark tunnel for this state
Well I mean I like black checks so much that I wouldn't mind being at the you know
Train to be a killer myself
Yeah they're making a 55 grand a year to start
Big buck
Not bad
Can I go somebody a douchebag?
Go ahead
I have to call a Victor Valdez
A Bears watching douchebag
Okay keep doing it baby
You got it, bubba
Thanks
Okay so there's people out there that are like doing their thing
And that's what we need because I don't care how many millions they spend
You've got to take people out there and like knock some sense into them
Whether they like it or not
You follow?
You've got to take the methods of the opposition
And beat them over the head with a 2x4
And knock some sense into that thick skull
And I'll say hey this is what we got to have we're talking jobs we're talking money
We're talking about big name entertainment we're talking about revitalizing this whole area
Instead of letting most of the living tourists go up to Orlando
Who the hell gives a flying crap about Orlando
I mean I know we have some people who listen through all the static up there
Like in Kassimi and those other Yahoo places
Don't take it personal although it might be partially
But we just need some stuff down here
We need some action we need some living and breathing people and some money
To pay for all this other crap that the government keeps inflicting on us
Not to mention a place to go and have a good time
Which I know is pretty revolutionary but we can't all fit into Kathy Willet's house
146 is WIOD here
This South Florida's news talk and entertainment station
You stop radio six and acrabling
WIOD
I always Miguel
I'm a Macita
I I I
Now functioned at the junction
In other words crappy equipment
We're sick of stupid shit
I'm heaven news
TV season looks fancy
Dudley Moore
Daddy Coleman
Oh no
There's last show's blue
There's howl in the engine wild
I miss the wilder they blow
And Martin Schott's been dug up too
Why didn't they retire?
And they're all through
And now I think we know
Why this news
TV season will be largely
And she is
Cardamon Amanda
Now they're dead too
Why did we detect it now?
Wait, the Millicent Kilmer
I'm so dead with jazz
Oh my god, and dead
Call recycling the same old tired crap
Is what it's called because there's about as much creativity
With those TV people as there is cash in my ass
I'm sorry
Oh quarter just fell out
Let's go to Miami
Hello
Yes, Neil?
Yes sir
Yes, I was wondering
There's a couple of things I want to attach to
One of them is an observation I did on Sunday
I was like channel surfing
And I caught up with the sports rap show
Mr. Mandage
Mr. Mandage, you mean Sunday night?
Yes, Sunday night
And I was wondering how I mean see how much you like him
So if you never really mentioned now he has a straggler resemblance to like a muppic from one of those old gimhencen shows
You third
Yeah, he really does
Wait a minute, I don't like him on the air
I don't like to be with him or see him
I see him, I get physically ill
I do like this work that he does on the air
Because he's got a big mouth and he's like gets excited and enthusiastic
And we especially need him on the dolphin broadcast to wake Bill's infrared
And then the other thing I wanted to ask you was how was reading this?
Oh, seriously, we need that enthusiasm as in
Well, alright
Of course, that is
Where else can you get there?
Yeah, that's true, that's definitely true
And the other question I wanted to ask you was
Yesterday I noticed I was listening to your show
And you didn't mention too much what do you think would happen to blockbuster or Mr. Wayne
Jump the boat
Oh, I don't think it's going to make any difference
He's got all his little soldiers in place and you know, of course
He'll on the one hand he'll say he's uninvolved, he'll step down, he won't have the title anymore
But you know, it's just like with the heat, you know, on the heat he's on the outside, it's supposed to be his brother
He's always got his finger in it, man, trust me when I tell you
And you can feel it, you really, it's not a, it's not a suppositor that's Wayne's finger
Yeah, it's just another way of him doing one of the little slimy, kind of things
Exactly, slimy is the word, you got it to a team, man
And one more thing, the wife would love
I just, I can feel this coming, you know what I'm saying?
And maybe she will too, hang on, Palley
Okay, that's what he's hoping, I'm sure
I had lined two for our Amigo, there are Paison
Our Paison and a West Coast, he's taking care of this, I'm sorry
Oh boy
Just, well, they just a lot of stuff coming up, we got the gambling thing going like I said
It's almost enough to get me excited about being here, not quite, but almost
Here's Sunrise, hello?
Nail
Yes sir, it's going
Great
Hey, at BC, you know why that reminds you of, it stands for Brainless Cowpoke
Cowpoke being the operative word there
This populist part of you're talking about
That's pretty brainless there, how popular is going to be with 35 people
30, seven people and five of them were in the same house and now we're down to like 32
And they all seem to be like in that Davy Hollywood borderline there
You know where the cows are in the middle of the grazing road of the road
They all seem to be hanging around by there with their horse
Come get their fat ass off the couch and come in on the kitchen
It gives them something to do, you know, it keeps them occupied, keeps them busy
And of course when they're not so in up those sheets on the weekend, it's given them something else, a little hobby for them
Right, I wish Howard could go to the tent of Tuesday, so I just so he could compete with you
It wouldn't compete, but just so he could go down the toilet
Well, he's doing his thing, after today I don't worry about Howard anymore
Because like I said, I gave him a second chance today
And I listened through all those spots and through a long ponderous bid
And Stuttering John was very funny, Howard and Robin were less funny
And it's just, it's not a big deal, it's just not going to change my life
Howard you're a dirty ed
Okay, Neil, yeah, can I get a CD?
Hang on, okay
He's on five
See it's amazing how many gives something away, they all, hey you're the best man, can I get something?
You're just, can I suck around a little bit and I'll give you something
How about giving me something?
