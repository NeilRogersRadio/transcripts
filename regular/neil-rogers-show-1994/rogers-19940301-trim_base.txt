it's getting the point and the public is so stupid because they're worried about
his nancy gonna win the gold medal tonight
they just keep taking away more rights and more rights and more rights and
pretty soon everything is against the god damn law if you pick your nose with
the wrong figure they're gonna stick your ass in jail
or just little by little day by day
of another freedom they take away right right and the public is too stupid
and all a guy damn thing it's just pathetic pal it said

popping a zit with your fingers and eating it
well the great taste is back
at the post-past
yes delicious creamy soft serve puss in a corner adish
with your choice of toppings
all the great taste of your body you enjoyed as a kid
like warm hero's
scab chips
and our new booker bits
the post-past
ice cream you scream we all scream
for plus
eleven thirty three w on the sweden way speaking of our stupid the world is
and especially in this country where stupidity is a very very valued commodity
in the dumber you are the more they admire you like uh... so was just alone
and are the sports and they get a more illiterate you are the number you are
and more like a bozo or like uh... rose and for example is a good example
the uh... more money you're gonna make it more they admire and love you and
fondly
so last night at the hockey game
usually they have these trivia questions that really really have something
to do with hockey
uh... and usually the answer is either uh... roger nielson or Dennis pop
and some self-serving thing you know for the panthers
last night's question was uh... when the uh... washington caps came into the
league in nineteen seventy four seventy five during their inaugural season
who was the president of the u.s. which has nothing to do with hockey of course
but they were the visiting team
but anyway so uh... they put up the four choices uh... let's see was linden
johnson
Richard nixon Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter
and most of the trivia questions i get right because they're pretty simple
like who was the uh... first goalie to wear a mask and an n.h.l. game
if you don't always talk plant and you don't absolutely nothing
you're like in the john moinehand class of hockey you know nothing about the game
so i mean this one you figure okay let's see uh... nixon was impeached in august
of seventy four left august office in that month
and of course uh... the hockey season starts like in october november
so
jerald for was obviously the a president back then and i'm saying jerald for
and even my friend big al who knows the right people but don't always know the
right answers
big alison i think you're wrong i think it was uh... first it's linden johnson
of course uh... didn't run again in sixty eight which is like only seven years
before that
six years
and uh... then it was jimmy Carter
but jimmy Carter got elected in seventy six now
but i mean these are like these are like simple questions like an our lifetime
many of us okay and it's like uh... i don't know
i don't know what times nancy on the night thirty p.m. eastern time
either
i mean it's just uh... i'm not saying that everybody's got to be a bookworm or a
great scholar on history or whatever but i mean i'm talking about really dumb
people man
not you well
but i mean just use that is an example else not the kind of guy you want to call
dumb ever
but it's just uh... it just boggles the mind what is wrong with people and
as how is it possible if you work that it could you possibly be so stupid
as most of the people out there
it's like they take a course in professional stupidity and anything that has
any significance in the uh... history of the human race
they don't know nothing about it nothing
jail for course i guess that fits right in because was there anybody ever uh...
the dumber in the congress in jr. old for
one of the dumbest people in the history of the human race
and also a member of the war in commission but now we're getting way off the
beaten track
getting to serious
get off on a whole tangent we don't want to do that

we should have tied last night we should no we should not have tied last night we did if we
didn't play in a team that was playing well last night it would have been ten to nothing so the
ration was also like sleepwalk in last night and we're lucky that there was any interest at all
that's so we are better than the cap store they think that but that you know something that's not
the point whether they stinker they don't stink the fact is you haven't been watching last
couple of weeks since they put Sean felled in charge they've been playing very very well and if
they would have played that way last night we could all left before the third period started you're
right you're probably right so this business a call in this team stinks that that's going to do

something we're still eight points ahead of your team so when you guys catch us call me back with
the big mouth okay asshole he told me that our team would be falling apart in the meantime we're
still got 62 points which is a hell of a lot but then many many other teams in league including
several more than you guys got okay so when you guys start getting really close when you're like

pompano parkway tonight probably the first time this season you went to where pompano yeah what
happened there in that sixth race the uh did we there when they night when they don't know I was
not there oh you did it in a sixth race the number 10 horse was so favored golden something or
other yeah and uh does the number one horse was favored also I ended up playing the number one
in Hennessy because Hennessy usually comes and play the one twelve combination two dollar bet two
hundred twenty dollar return great nice going pal so what are you complaining about I'm not
complaining I was having a good time everybody else was complaining while school them yeah take
adopt that fat rich philosophy of the track as long as you're cash and screw everybody else I'm
making money I'm there you go screw all those other bastards oh that's all I wanted to call about
well nice going pal I see long me fifty dollars oh and by the way the guy who called yesterday that
cheapskate who won the big triple of Gulf Stream and how much are they going to take out and you don't
want to they don't take anything out unless it's over five grand according to the expert Mr. Fat
who should know because he's the expert on everything everything and he gives me the song
of the dance you know we got three hockey games next week Monday Wednesday and Friday not
that we don't have plenty of people clamoring for those seats by the way but I said to him to try
to be a nice guy after the game last night I said oh and by the way if you need an extra seat because
big Al is always kind enough because his wife don't care about the games and quite frankly woody we
don't want to see you there anyway uh you know I just I don't know no no I got a client right up there
just happened to be right up there by the track Monday and Wednesday and Friday plus the fact
what he doesn't want to admit is he's making so much more there than he's ever made before in his
life that he just can't afford not to be going to the track we can handle that okay we'll survive
without your fatso god try to do something nice for somebody and oh no no I can't that's my track
nights now I'll be right up there I'm right up there by uh yeah by toothless his house by his uh
pup tent by his mud hut we have an open line it's inbroward 5249463 here's Miami hello
hey good morning Neil how are you good afternoon good afternoon when is tarda
days listen you were talking about Joe Robbie Stadium right I had a great time last year during the
maras season but there are a couple of things happened I left a bitter taste to my mouth really
so I'm the one with smoking a little scope couldn't have they have the family session which I
was not sitting in and I wasn't too sure about the rules I was sitting there smoking a cigarette
obviously some smelly bitch went over complaining to the guy that stands there to check to make sure
you have the right ticket he comes over and tells me I can't sit there and smoke well I got up and
went down the stairs and went out you know in the area there and smoked my cigarette but later on
I thought about it there was no I didn't know the rules there was no rules against me smoking
there but because somebody complained they made me smelly bitch they made me get up in movie told
me you know that's not to sit there and smoke yeah but I was in a section where smoking was a lot
that must be the faggot police man if you stick one in your mouth and you burn it man your history
better not after you in two shakes of the lambs uh thing I went to a game one night and I had my ticket
it's about two months ahead of time I had four seats in a row a whole group of people come the most
have been 200 people they all sat down in that section there's the guy and his whole family sitting
in my seat so I showed him my ticket I said you're sitting in my seat he goes oh no we got the tickets
for this section the group who has the tickets for this section so I went over and got the guy to
take the ticket he goes well this is the whole group and it again I said what the hell are you
talking about I these are the tickets the guy had had no seat numbers on them oh that's good
and they were trying to convince me to move because I think I think you're being a little bit
unrealistic okay I think there's a whole group so why should I think they're trying to sit in your
own seats and I think that's really unrealistic well I told the guy he was full of it now it's
my season and I did make a move yeah yeah well two of these bastards that come and sit in the wrong
seats you're talking about fair really just like these two guys in front of us last night who I am
positive must have been in the wrong seats the whole night including the one guy from New York who
I just wish we get on the first bus and go back even though they were pants or fans this guy
he's doing like a whole running commentary like during the entire first period until somebody finally
threatened a life and limb I was I go with the buddy of mine once in a while we get the upper deck
seats and he likes to go down on both the lower seats and on around for seats and I've done it
with him once or twice you go and you sit in somebody's seats then they come to get in their seat
and it's embarrassing is how but it's embarrassing you know and you know you need to move again and
and whenever I go and do that I miss out the stinking game trying to play musical chairs it's
no more than I'd rather sit in the upper deck you gotta understand most of our fans don't care
about whether they see the game or not they show up about 10 minutes into the first period sometimes
almost at the end of the first period and they leave 10 minutes before the end of the game so
they don't care we're just there to go out and stay in the hallway and the smoke and have a
couple of pretzels and show everybody that they're there well I'll tell you one more thing you
tell them like yeah I have my guts ripped out there then I went to Bingo I haven't played
no over a year went up to the Indian yep the jackpot it had to go on the 53rd number I needed
I 27 and my my mother was also waiting she needed I 25 yeah 35 thousand dollars yeah they didn't get
it and my guts I mean that risk my gut that I can't I can't stand it you get down and need one
numbers like your dog you need that one dog to win a lot of money okay okay I see it pop it
overnight all right later okay we have an open line in day seven five one guys give me a sob story

yeah he is dead but not too long how about art link letter here's a lady in Hollywood hello
hello yes ma'am hi um you know you always talk about a lady's mask calling well one of the reasons
they don't is that they don't have as much freedom in workplaces men they can't sit on the phone for
long they can't sit on it too long where it becomes obvious you got that right yeah I wanted to tell
you this was the long time ago I don't call very often new year's day at the six o'clock news on
channel seven Jim Barry was talking about little rogers and his campus so whether you know it or not
you must own the panthers yeah he was talking about how I got news for what Jim Barry knows about
the panthers or about almost any sport you could stick up his nostrils and have room for
jazz mccale left over way telling you okay one of the thing getting back to J.R.S. Stadium and
they're smoking then yeah they put the smoking then on after they sold the season ticket
yeah I understand that okay which is a way of like if they already got your money they're not
gonna give it back and then they say oh and by the way you're screwed they are they sold it's
the order to get opening day tickets you have to buy a three day package yeah and there are no
e-pun so if you smoke you you're out you're out right okay one last request you always promise
