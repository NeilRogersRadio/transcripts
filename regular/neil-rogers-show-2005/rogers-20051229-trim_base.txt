Oh, that was good.
Oh, man.
Neil Rogers, week eight from 10 to 2 on 5, 6, 8, 8.
All right, my favorite time of the day. I get to leave.
How are you?
That's my favorite time, but 158.
Yeah. What's going with you?
Do you know that on September 21st, 1970,
would you probably know this?
The first Monday night football game,
the Jets lost to the Brown 31 to 21 in the same score.
The same score they lost to the Patriots on the last one in football.
How do you like that?
Yeah.
Lightening striking twice in the same place.
Yeah.
So this moment I didn't know that.
And the Jets were on a losing side of both games.
That's what I just said.
Yeah.
That's what I just said.
They lost 31 to 21 to the Browns and then to the Patriots.
But then he ran.
So how was your luck with Alan Cohen yesterday?
Well, he spent the whole afternoon together doing what?
Fetting horses.
Well, what is that?
We had lunche called her for what purpose?
He owns a stable.
I know that.
And he owns a big horse farm up in Ocala.
Yeah.
So you guys were just over the top.
We had lunche played horses.
Had a good day.
Want some money?
Not me.
He's a good handicapper, by the way.
He's he really?
Yes.
And you know what?
He's a pretty good guy.
Huh.
I liked him.
He's got you one over.
Yeah.
The horse player was a hockey team.
What could be worse than that?
Pretty good game last night, too.
Like I said, the Panthers would beat the Bruins.
But you did.
They had a tough time.
Yeah.
But I got home from Woodbiner.
I said, a highlight.
That was a phenomenal game.
There were actually some people there.
You would, yeah.
They sold out for Friday night.
Really?
Yeah.
I mean, he gave me the straight information on attendance.
And he said it's been gradually climbing.
Yeah, with the wins.
And you know, the other thing is.
I just sold out for Friday because it's the frogs.
Yeah, a lot of your old ones.
It's four thousand frogs there.
Right.
Oh, brother.
But you know, they're going to make money this year.
Well, they're going to make money this year because they got a pretty low payroll.
They're not anywhere near the salary count.
Well, they're getting at that profit-seering thing.
He's looking to feed out of the trough.
Well, they've got to.
You know, coming back after the strike, the, you know, this collective bargaining agreement is going to work for both sides.
It would not so well for the players.
But it's going to work for the owners in a big way.
Well, they're already saying that that the league is going to make money and the cap is going to go up next year to 45 or 46 million, something like that.
Yeah.
And they're already.
And of course, that again is going to like tilt right back to where it was before in favor of the big market teams, like Philly and Toronto, etc.
And we're saying the way things are right now that the league can be very competitive.
Yeah.
Well, of course, if you're looking at Alain, it's kicking ass in the division.
But they're happy.
They're playing better.
He said Horton, his, you know, stepped up, Gary Roberts is playing well.
Yoke and of course has been terrific.
You're looking to go and like his healthy.
And so.
It was with hockey talk.
Bye-bye everybody.
Nice to have nice to the new year.
So by the way, the coach will be on next Tuesday.
Jock Martin.
Yes.
Oh, in other words, he is, what do you mean he'll be on next Tuesday?
Well, we have my keen in usually every other Tuesday.
Right.
But keen in is going to be in Vancouver.
So we will have the coach.
Yeah, that frog Jack Martin on.
Well, that's good.
Ask him how he lost all those playoff games in Ottawa.
It's such a superior team.
I say we have a question from Neil and Toronto.
Yeah.
How come you choked in Ottawa every year, Jock?
I think I got a nice team.
I said that at the beginning of the year.
They didn't gel very well, but now they're even Martin Gelanah had a nice school last night.
They're playing pretty good.
Jock did not, you know, did not panic when they were losing all those games.
Well, I got news for you may say that, but there was a lot of rumors when they were in the.
Oh, yeah, when when with the ass end of that tailspin man, when they went on the road and.
Right.
Keenan went on the trip.
That is correct.
See, I'm keeping up with him.
Moving on to bigger and better things like QAM.
So I was seeing their losing at Woodbine.
I was trying to conjure up in my mind what this meeting was with Alan Cohn was all about.
I don't know you're going to the train.
It really wasn't a meeting.
It was so good.
I didn't want to get to go.
You made it sound like there was something sinister involved.
No, nothing to mention.
So that's too bad.
Because I was thinking, well, maybe he's going to buy the radio station and then pay me off, you know.
You know what I thought would be a good idea.
I'm just for him to buy the station and pay me.
You warning I was thinking about.
No, not pay you off.
Yes.
But that he buy the radio station.
And we clean house and get rid of the people we don't want around here anymore.
What was that for good business?
Saker is that just for out of spite?
What's the difference?
It's our age.
How do you care about the business?
It's his money.
He couldn't squander at any worse than the previous administration.
There you go.
Well, it's kind of hard though to sell a station when you don't have a license, isn't it?
Well, there is a little bit of a technicality.
What happens if you don't have a license, you get stopped.
Like driving a car without a license?
Yeah, exactly.
It's kind of hard to sell something that you don't have.
Because when you sell a radio station, you're selling the broadcast like a song of license.
Is your asset?
Our license is in limbo.
It's still doing the limbo rock.
And like anything else, you can't get a straight answer about anything.
So as each day goes by, before I go on the year, various and sundry people come in,
and the rumor is that everybody in the building is like walking on eggshells,
because nobody's got any clue what's going on, including Clarence, who's as clueless as ever.
And nobody has a clue.
Which is so clashless, man.
It's so typical of this business, you know.
We're all just a bunch of peons.
Never mind, man.
You know what?
I think this guy and I think that we can be friendly enough that I can coerce him into doing this.
Who do you want to get rid of?
In other words, you're going to get Alan Cohen to buy the radio station?
And we'll make a list.
Now, tell me that that didn't come up in a conversation yesterday.
About him buying a radio station?
Yeah.
No.
Oh.
We talked about you a little bit.
Oh, boy.
How about he's a big fan of mine?
You know what?
Not.
Why?
You know what?
He's got the right attitude.
Well, what is that?
It's a radio show.
I'm not a radio show.
Yeah, and...
Doesn't bother him.
What doesn't bother him that I ripped him an ass?
Yeah.
Because he thinks he knows something?
See, this year he finally left it up to the hockey people, and they brought in some good players.
Right.
And they got a good balance of veterans and young players.
And you know what?
He acknowledges that he's been learning as he's gone along.
Yeah.
You would like this guy.
I'm not kidding you.
Okay.
Hey, if he's got a lot of money, I'd like to buy it.
So what did he say about me?
I'm curious now that you brought that up.
He heard you when you were ripping him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what?
He's got the right approach to it.
It's like some people when you rip them, they go over the top.
You know what?
When they start taking it out on other people.
You mean like Wayne?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Yes.
And I see how long did that take.
He was the furthest thing for him.
He's not even on today.
Yes.
And you're hoping that that trend continues.
So in other words, I don't know about this track.
What he's writing to say is let's get Alan Cohen to buy the station and say, first of all, most contract expires in March.
Now this is already the end of the year.
The year is over.
This is my last show of the year today.
Are you on tomorrow?
Yeah.
Oh well.
Happy New Year.
I got the worst contract in the place.
But I'm off Monday.
I'm taking Monday.
I'm off Monday too.
So I'll see you two day.
But anyway, so it's my last show of the year.
Happy New Year to you too.
Yeah.
And so other than Mo, who else would you like to blow out since we're mentioning names now?
Well, sales sales how about the Curtis Raymond Burr?
That would be long before I'd worry about Mo, I'd get his ass out.
We need a sales manager, man.
Curtis Raymond Burr, you mean old-iron size?
Stiffy, yeah.
That situation back there.
You know what?
Our Raymond Burr is iron head.
Let me give you an example.
Now I noticed I was listening on one morning and you had for Christmas, Vermont teddy bear.
Yes.
Okay, you had a couple of spots for them.
How many years have I been doing that spot for Easter and Christmas and whatever?
Me too.
They weren't ever on this show.
They weren't on your show?
I mean, I mean this last time before Christmas, they were never on this here.
I don't get that.
No, I don't either.
Everything is falling to the cracks because the left hand back there hasn't got any idea what the right hand is doing.
People keep leaving and flying out the door.
Nobody's got it.
And everything just gets dropped.
Everything just falls through the cracks and they're running around back there talking crap like,
oh, well, our rates are too high and we don't get response for a client, all this other crap.
Well, anybody that's got added to that added to this belong in a building.
Right.
And that's the kind of losers we're having off the street.
It's really sad.
There's a lot of new people back there.
Yeah.
Every time you turn around, every time I would come down to the river.
Every time I would come down to do a few shows there.
They would march in at least one or two people.
Oh, I want you to meet Billy.
We want you to meet so and so.
This one and that one.
And who the hell are these people?
What do they know about any of us?
So this radio station and the answer is Zilch.
Absolutely Zilch.
Well, we have two minute breaks now.
Oh, I got all threes today, I think.
I got a lot of good.
Thank God for those tradeouts.
Well, you've got higher numbers.
You should have more than two minute break.
Yeah, sure.
I got higher tradeout numbers.
Somebody must have a lot of Rolex watches laying around.
I'll tell you that.
My God.
That thing must run 45 times a show.
Oh, you got the Rolex watches?
No, I don't have the watches.
I just have the spots.
Oh.
I actually have two, four minute breaks today.
Let's hear it.
All right.
For that fantastic sales.
And then Fat Boy refuses to get me copied.
And then the other story there is something's going on with this family.
They're all exploding from fat or something like that.
I don't know what's going on there.
So they've all got excuses.
But there's nobody around.
If I would have known this, that is just said, OK, after I come back from Amsterdam,
I'll just recuperate for a week and take the whole week off.
Yeah, this is for sure.
We're really not broadcasting this week.
We're just faking it.
We have an empty parking lot downstairs.
That's what I heard.
Even Clarence said, he said, this place is a ghost town.
I would never have had to be for the whan if the parking lot was in the shape of it.
Yeah, she probably would still be there.
You know, something I don't want to like lay it on your fat shoulders, Mr. But, you know,
she would probably still be there if it wasn't for all the grief and angst that you caused.
It was lovely screw in at bitch.
I'm proud of it.
I mean, everything you said was true, but you could have said it nicely.
Bitch, you miserable slut, stuff like that.
In a very nice tone, you know.
Yeah, exactly.
Instead of flying off the handle and getting all emotional and getting your blood pressure up, not good for it.
I know.
Yesterday I was in Alvin Turra trying to get out of trying to get off Alvin Turra Boulevard.
It was mid-two cops screwing it up there.
And I heard some guy yell, yeah, I had to win the open because it was cool.
I heard some guy yell something and the cop yells back at him.
Cool, you're temper, you're going with me and I'm thinking, going where are you kids?
Gridlock, you can't get out of there.
Yeah.
I was tempted to say that to the cop, but I thought, you know, I don't want to get suspended again.
Being arrested.
On the outside.
All right.
Well, well, well, Cohen is going to bike you away and let's start that moment going.
We're going to go find her, go all upset.
He could afford it.
I'll say that.
See, I can't see, I mean, this is just me guessing.
You might as well conjecture.
Nobody can criticize any of us for conjecturing because nobody's telling us anything.
So all we can do is sit around and guess what's going on.
But the fact that long time, you know, all established people like Ray Perry is out the door already
and certain other people are being like demoted and pushed one step toward the door,
that's the tell you right there that the old regime is over with.
So that whole business with Frank Sinatra and my way.
That was just a classless way of saying goodbye without these or any other decisions.
These are corporate decisions.
Well, that's what I'm saying.
He's gone.
And that voluntarily either in spite of what it'll be like Don Schulug.
And there will be a memo that will come out that say, Greg Reed is a, we're very sorry to announce that Greg is leaving our company
and to pursue other interests.
And we thank Greg for all these years of, yeah, and that's what's going to happen.
There would be great to be able to find some fish who's got a big bank role
as you could bring in here and buy the place and then yeah.
And we'll leave it to us to take it over.
Based on the beastly's ineptitude and they're insane.
They're obsession with Greg and all the blunders he's made these last several years.
I can't see them being able to operate this place without him.
In other words, who are they going to bring in that they're going to have the same trust and confidence?
Yeah, I wouldn't see it.
Yeah, we'll run the joint.
Yeah.
Now, what kind of car is he, was he got a Cadillac?
Oh, yeah, that would be my first move.
Okay, well, I got my two corvettes. You can have the Cadillac.
I have an infinity. I'm happy with it.
Who gets the Jaguar?
You know what? Warren Henry has Jaguars too.
I can, well, there you go. Good.
Get one of those.
I can have one of these.
Here's the deal, Clarence. It's not personal as business, but you're back to being sports flocking.
Okay, we get hired like a real program director.
Yeah.
With all due respect.
I mean, he's like drowning in a sea of incompetent.
I mean, he's just over his head.
I'll take care of Clarence.
I'll make sure he has a job.
Yeah, there, there you go.
Maybe I'll put him in sales or something.
Yeah.
I told him that yesterday I said, he's clear.
You're going to be good in sales.
And then this morning to make him feel better, I said, oh, you're going to be a great GM.
Might as well.
Oh, yeah.
He could do it on his general manager, just like Howard Primer was PD at KAT.
I told you that story.
That's the great story.
Yeah.
Waiting in a hallway to get fired and the program director quits and he goes in there and says,
Hey, Howard, how would you like to be the program director?
That's a true story.
That's a clip.
Wow.
What's the hell was your name?
Well, I wish to have the senator from Nevada.
Yeah, I know who you're talking about.
I've been trying to say it.
He will tell you next time you have a good student like this.
And then he told me and I forgot.
I should have written it down.
Yeah, he'll tell you that story in detail.
Of course, it was long after he departed, but it's most amusing.
Well, I hope you have a very happy new year.
Happy new year to Sid Levin.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Great people in the business.
I can't think of too many of them.
Gary Lawrence.
Happy new year, Gary.
Who else do we like in the business?
Anybody else we know?
Everybody else I knew is dead.
Big cashler.
Did you know that cashler?
I had cash very well.
Boy, Dick was great.
Now, there was a, see, that's a very unusual thing.
A radio guy.
What a concept.
I mean, yeah, he wasn't, his background wasn't sales, but he was into programming and he was sitting
and have lunch with him in brainstorm and make all kinds of moves.
He was a fascinating, well, he had a television background too.
Oh, did he?
Yeah, he ran channel 13 and there was a New York station based in Newark.
He also had a circus background.
I don't know if you know that or not.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
But I ran into, I think it was, I think I ran into his widow not too long ago.
Yeah.
Having breakfast someplace.
You know, his name was Richard Rose.
Yeah.
Was his real name.
See, I was an advertising when I first met the Casper and he was, I'll tell you something,
I had a lot of people calling me.
That guy was the best salesperson.
Yeah.
I've ever dealt with in any media type.
Mm-hmm.
He was an amazing guy.
That was a lot of fun, boy, building that station.
I was just, and he let us all be a part of it, you know, as opposed to this paranoid to keep everybody in the dark,
everything's a big secret.
You know, that's what goes on at QIM and it's very unpleasant that now we got a whole staff of,
and mostly good people.
You know, we joke about this one and that one and, uh, the generally speaking, we got a lot of good people.
Yeah, that's no joke.
And, uh, they deserve better than to be like all left in limbo like, you know,
while somebody's got a big ego and what does that mean that Actie put on?
Yeah, it's not right.
It's just not right.
Especially holidays and everything else.
People have families.
Yeah.
All these things.
But nevertheless.
You know what?
It's, uh, I, it's interesting though, Neil, when somebody is let go before Christmas and everybody says,
ah, how can you let somebody go before Christmas?
So what's the difference if you wait two weeks?
Right, exactly.
It's the idea that they're letting them go.
It's just like giving an extra stilch as the Chinese say, a little stab in the back, you know,
and not only are we firing your ass, but we're doing it right before the holidays to destroy what ordinarily might be a pleasant time of the year.
Yeah.
Like a little extra stilch as the Hungarians say.
Okay.
On that note, yes.
I think we got, I think, yeah, listen, now that you're bonding with Alan Cohen, telling them that all is forgiven,
the Panthers are playing great like I expected they would.
This is the way I thought they would play.
Although the Long Go play very well.
Hey, invite me to come out and watch a game in the suite.
I mean, what can you do better than that?
Yeah, I'm not going out and watching any high-will-do that.
I will do that.
What?
I'll take you with me when you're in town.
Yeah, sure you will.
Sure.
I will.
I don't need you to go see the hockey team.
I understand that.
I understand that.
You know, but I wouldn't mind spending an evening with you at a hockey game before.
I'd rather have you go to the track at Pompo-no Park.
Okay, we'll do that.
We'll do that in a much better time there.
We'll do that instead.
Okay.
I'm going to go see my friend Derek there very soon as a matter of fact.
Just let Tom and you two up in.
I'm ready.
Our pair of mutual friend, Derek.
Okay.
Derek knows where the bodies are buried.
Believe me.
In fact, maybe I'll sit in the fat-rich memorial seat.
Okay.
No, I know seriously when you think about that, isn't that appropriate?
They shouldn't have a seat for him there.
Huh?
No, but seriously.
I'm not joking with that in the press box.
If you would have ever asked him, and I'm not joking because I knew him for over 20 years
we went to the track together.
Oh, I know that.
If he had to choose a place to dial, I'm sure he would have not wanted to do it that way,
but it would have been right there at the track.
I think he had the super or something like that.
He had the winning ticket in his pocket, and then, well, we all over on the table face first, and that was it.
Yeah.
I would prefer a champagne room.
Of course, I've had a lot of my horses croak in the stress, but that's another story.
And anyway, have a great new year.
It's been fun this year, Neil.
And we're still here.
How do you like that?
I got to run another one.
But fat old Jews, they're still here at QAM.
The other guys who got there, cheer across the street, talking a lot of crap.
We're still a kickin' ass.
All right.
See you Tuesday.
Best of you.
Bye.
All right, sports fans.
Hey, boy, howdy, dude.
With this week's installment of...
Now, see here.
I'll see here.
Pants are essential to a man's attire.
Now, I got all kinds of things with my pants.
And my shins and a dingo berries and...
Who knows what I'll find in there next?
You know, many things have been said about my pants.
I may not be wearing any now, but I've only caused an euphoria of excitement.
I sold them.
Who did more for pants?
Fred Moetz, James Coco.
Kamaan, and another thing.
Who did more for hygiene?
Some are his eve?
Or Mr. Whipple.
And I think you know the answer to that one.
And while I'm on the subject of sports.
Who did more for the Dalton's offense?
Flow-mo rose into all of it.
Well, Mr. Kitzel.
Let me...
No, stop fucking your pink pipe for a smoke.
Who did more for Gleib-Mist-Bethroom's spray?
Who, hey, back at the door and run, register?
Or a brand new thing?
Ah!
Kamaan.
You know where you can insult the underfixier.
If Joyce will only die.
Wait.
Wait, there's your gold.
You can't go nowhere.
I'm not the...
F***ing...
Oh, that's a beautiful thing, isn't it?
That's good.
So I guess parents' expectations to play a lot of bits today.
So I guess we'll do that.
So keep your finger on that yellow button.
Because you never know what's going to pop up like that thing with a hummerboy yesterday.
That was my band.
Yeah, well, it was your band.
I never realized that there were...
Well, I banged on it several times in a button too.
10, 17, at 5, 60, that's almost time for the second break.
You know what?
That was a good crossover day.
We made up for the previous couple of days when I was in a coma.
And I was in excellent crossover.
A lot of inside stuff.
That's what the audience likes.
They like to be made to feel like they're on the inside of the abinus.
You know, getting some real ins...
And of course the audience knows exactly as much about what's going on in a QA mis-we do,
which is nothing.
Zippo.

And receive a free box of Qtips.
Maybe they got Waxie buildup.
1032 at 560.
Oh, look at that.
We got some dead people over there in the Middle East again.
What a surprise.
What a surprise.
What a surprise.
Just in time for the holidays.
Most companies interviewed about the government back 9-11 loans they received
have told investigators they weren't hurt by the suicide attacks.
I didn't know they were getting terrorism assistance.
Billions in loans went to businesses that weren't hurt by the attacks.
As the government once again,
piece away your money like it's water coming out of a faucet.
These small business administrations and specter general also reported yesterday
that lenders who build out billions of dollars in such loans failed 85% of the time
to document that recipients were actually hurt by the terror attacks
and therefore eligible for the federal aid.
Oh, here you want some money?
Here you go.
The IG, the agency's internal watchdog,
concluded only nine loan recipients in the 59 cases sample
appear to be qualified for the special disaster loans.
The reports at SBA official told lenders they wouldn't be questioned
how they gave out money.
We believe these communication were intended to and did send a message.
Like said in a message to Joey Zaza,
send a message to lenders that the agency wouldn't question lender
or eligibility of termination inspected general said.
The investigative reports substantiates key findings of an AP story in September
that found similar problems with SBA supplementary terrorist activity
relief program, STAR.
STAR.
The AP found that terrorism recovery loans went to businesses including
a South Dakota radio station.
Oh yeah.
A Virgin Islands perfume shop, a Utah dog boutique,
and more than 100 Dunkin' Donuts and Subway Sandwich shops in various locations.
How do you like that?
Well, you're probably happy about the Dunkin' Donuts.
Yeah.
Meanwhile, small businesses near ground zero in the year couldn't get assistance
that they desperately saw.
SBA administrator Hector Burrito put the best face on the finding,
saying the audit didn't find that the loan recipients were unqualified for the program
although we didn't note that lending documentation could have been better.
His statement, high effort, was calculated by Senator Olympia Snow of Maine,
chairwoman of the Senate Committee that oversees the SBA.
These initial findings are troubling and the committee will continue
with its own investigation of STAR program to get it to truth and inform Congress,
for the future, etc.
The IGE report found that only two of 42 borrowers interviewed were where they had obtained a STAR loan.
In cases where eligibility couldn't be established, 25 out of 34 borrowers interviewed,
said they weren't adversely affected by the terror attacks.
And 36 out of 42 borrowers questioned, said they weren't asked or couldn't recall
if they were asked about the impact of the attacks under Binis.
The reports that IGE investigators were told by lenders that their participation originally was low
because of unclear requirements.
SBA officials then embarked on a vigorous marketing campaign
and lenders interpreted their remarks to mean that every small business could claim
it was somehow impacted by the attacks and therefore eligible to receive a STAR loan.
You're a money being flushed down the plate while the public is worried about
American Idol and CREMP like that and survivor Ruggiana and oldest garbage.
Wow.
Really?
Yeah.
And we're going to do something about it on some stupid ass radio show.
I don't think so.
Is Eric in the chat room or not? Is he awake? Is he alive?
Yeah, he's in the chat room.
Because I don't see...
I told him to do, you know, to post it on the poll switch.
He said he was having connection problems.
Connection problems with what?
With life?
Computer.
He's having connection problems with a computer?
Oh, no. He's already got it up there.
So you just as I said that every time I try...
Every time you try to make him look bad, he shows you up.
Well, what is...
What? It's not me.
I love Eric.
Eric does a phenomenal job.
Even though he can be very irritating and annoying, but he's great.
And you...
I think it's the computer thing.
I think there's this rivalry between computer nerds.
That's what it is.
That must be it.
5, 6, 7. Come on.
Let's take a whole bunch of calls.
It's the last show of the year for me, man.
We got George tomorrow and Monday.
Well, we got out with...
You know, who was saying that was it you?
I think you said it the other day and you're right.
It's been...
It's been more months than we can count since you actually went a whole week on this station.
We're like the pristine regular lineup on here every day.
It's just...
What's going on here?
Yeah.
I said...
I said actually I don't think you can go an entire five days with...
Yeah.
I mean, this week not even close.
This week we don't even have one day because Mad Dog's off till the rest of the year until the new year.
This is like a...
Your patchwork radio station, okay?
Tune in and see who's going to be on today.
But then again, when you've got everybody leaving and all sorts of people being demoted and shoved to the door
and don't let the door hit you in the ass and away,
and just a general nightmare going on around you, then what would you expect?
They out of case to rather than anybody shows up.
Just like you heard me asking parents about the Bokeh Brian bits and oh, well, what?
He's clueless.
I guess that we can listen to those now.
Huh?
We'll just play him.
I am playing him.
We already heard two of them.
I am just playing him.
But that's another part of his...
You see, instead of just making up stupid schedules and worried about ball games and doing UM basketball on that crap,
now he's going to have to actually do the little programming.
A little bit.
Whatever he's capable of, which isn't much.
56670560.
It's not personal parents.
We like you a lot.
And the Jaguar really looks good on you, but boy, you are way out of your league, sweetheart.

They're like to our troops.
I'm going to tell you about the new poll for tomorrow on the weekend.
Well, I mean, Georgia will probably put one up for the weekend.
Okay.
When you think, I would think, like, Georgia put up a poll, it goes, which of these dot, dot,
dot, and then that's it, you know.
But he likes doing that stuff.
It's easier than doing a real poll.
Don't be knocking George now behind his back.
I'll squeal.
Okay, you want to find a result on this?
I do.
No, you know, what event of 2005 was the most significant to you?
Hurricane Wilma 460.
Gas going over three bucks a gallon, 243.
Republican scandals and indictments, and there are so many, 210.
Hurricane Katrina 181.
I had no sex life, 141.
I got laid a lot, only 46.
That's why there's so many unhappy people in Florida.
Terry and her.
Shoo!
25.
Slots get OK'd and Broward 19.
That's not too big of a deal to these people, I guess.
Pope John Paul II thighs with a nice little slippers on 18.
John Roberts, a punitive Supreme Court in between doing CBS even he news 13.
And a recollections, Solomon T. Sinko, Chinkway 5 out of 13, 163.
Now, he magically, thanks Eric.
Now you can just go back to bed or do make some money.
Do something useful Eric.
See, he's probably happy that we got that out of the way.
Now we just need to, we got no, because you're going to have to add one on there right away.
Okay.
What's your number one wish for 2006?
The one we need to add is QAM gets sold and you'll get paid off.
So I can vote.
Okay.
That's my number one wish for 2006.
That the beesleys finally decide, well, we don't know anything about radio and especially, yeah, we were clueless.
So they're going to sell to a bunch of, to a bunch of farbicina Christians, man, and the last person they'd won on the European me.
So they'll just pay me off of human for the last three years and bye-bye. See ya!
But not too nice.
And of course, you would, George, you could like make a lot of money out there in the street corner.
This is Neil Rogers.
Yeah.
This is 5.62.
I do believe that stuff is.
Why do I drink so much?
Why?
Well, I drink so much, huh?
Every new year's in your care resistance.
When the ball comes down, I'll be on the ground, hug him a toilet.
I can't believe my liver's not the Z's and I can't spell AA.
Don't like sobriety.
End up a year means a vendor.
Find out bartender.
Freeze in a vendor.
Who knew your son, end up?
I'll blow chunks.
I'll blow chunks.
I'll blow chunks.
I'll blow chunks.
I'll blow chunks.
I'll blow chunks.
I'm pretty sure that I'll be puked.
In other words, New Year's coming.
Look at that please trying to say, 1044 a Cuey and Happy New Year.
Or not as a case may be.
Some people are like, I'll be happy when the whole thing is over.
You know, I just like to say, I'll be happy when the whole thing is over.
I'm so tired of this time of the year.
I don't want to sound like the Grinch or Scrooge or like that.
I just, it's just a pain in the ass.
29 votes on the new pool.
That's not too exciting.
What's your number one wish for 2006?
Here's what we have so far.
We can add lots more to it depending on what you wish for.
In Peach George W. Bush 10.
What a surprise that's leading, isn't it?
Yeah.
Win the lotto, seven.
To have lots of sex, five.
QM gets old and he'll get paid off, two.
Oh yeah.
Thank you so much whoever else voted for that.
Good health too.
Of course, whoever else voted for that probably wants me off the air.
But that's okay.
Thank you anyway.
A Democrat sweep elections too.
Peace out earth one.
Get a divorce.
Get a better job.
All our troops come home.
None.
None for all our troops come home.
Wow.
That is pathetic.
You know, that's tragic.
Zero for all our troops come home.
Well, we don't know who any of Mars,
so let him die.
They enlisted anyway.
Like that bitch they called a couple days ago.
She was really special.
Yeah.
Oh, wasn't she?
I got a special place in hell for that slut.
That old bitch.
Well, you know, Cindy Shan, she's making a baby of her son and a less dead.
Yeah.
Therefore, he deserved to be sent over there to be a human fodder for your fodder.
To be a human sacrifice.
Speaking of that, speaking of dead people to those who are very close,
Dick Clark, who suffered a stroke last December,
he's suffered two actually, but they're trying to keep the second one a secret, a massive one.
Last December, won't be in a wheelchair when he appears on ABC's New Year's rock and heaves his co-host Ryan Seacrest.
It'll be 76-year-old Clark's first TV appearances as Stroke, which forced him to bow out of last year's show.
I'm not a doctor and I'm not his wife, so I don't see him on a daily basis, but he will not be in a wheelchair on the telecast.
Seacrest told AP Ray DeWen a recent interview.
Seacrest will make his debut as a co-host of New Year's Eve Special said Clark has gotten better and better each day.
I don't think he's 100%.
Maybe he's...
But third, man!
But I think he's better than he was last week and better than he was six months ago.
As for Clark's voice, Seacrest said, it's not exactly as it probably sounded when he was as healthy as to be for the stroke,
but it definitely sounds like Dick.
And I think that he's been working on his speech and making sure that his as good as it can be on that night.
I know that he's one of the most driven and focused individuals on the planet, the 31-year-old Seacrest said,
and so when he puts his mind to something, he's going to be doing it.
Seacrest and Clark will appear from New York, where the ball will drop and the co-host Hillary Duff will anchor and perform a The Hollywood disegment of the show.
Aren't you excited about that?
Hillary Duff is going to be out there in LA watching the ball's drop.
And it probably won't be the first time.
That is really something.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
What's your number one wish for 2006?
Got a whole bunch of things we can probably put on there.
Maybe we'll actually get a couple.
WDQYM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Pretty good.
Excellent. I've got two things for the ball.
One is obviously a long and healthy life for you.
And number two, you get Rick and Suds back on the air. How about that?
Okay.
All right.
Thank you so much.
Don't hold your breath.
I'll put it on there. Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
Rick and Suds back on the air.
You got it?
Got it.
Or is that Suds and Rick?
Do we want to put Suds and Rick?
Put whatever you want on there.
Okay.
You know, December 29th, last show of the year.
Put whatever you want.
We like Suds a lot on the show. Rick, you know.
5, 6, 7, by the way, how's that?
How are the stock futures doing? Rick, how's the fair value today?
0.560, the liberalized and singular wireless line.
WDQYM, hello.
QYM.
Yeah, I'd like to talk to you now.
Speaking.
Yeah, like the last call that you said, I wish you a long and healthy life.
And my wish for the 2006 is for Pink Floyd to reunite and make a world tour.
Okay.
Have a good one.
Now you too.
For Pink Floyd to reunite, there's a guy that's really got his priorities in the right pecking order,
when you think?
Sounds like it's going to be a nice and goes on a world tour.
How are if you want to phrase it?
I'll leave it in your delicate hands.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60.
Don't forget Curtis for the moment to this afternoon.
There's a nice change of pace for you.
WDQYM, hello.
Okay, Nick, how are you?
Yes, sir.
How about for a six, first of all, healthy and happy New Year's union?
Same to you.
And let's try how about in teaching a bush in 06?
It's leading the pull. That's number one with a bullet.
All right, let's go for that, all right?
Okay, thank you.
I just, on second thought, I just dumped myself.
I probably wasn't a good response.
Like I said, it's number one in the pull already.
You have to be real, very nervous about things like that.
You know what I'm saying?
Is that right?
Yeah, yeah.
Unless you want some visitors at your door there,
which I don't think you're really interested in.
20 for MP's George W. Bush.
Win the lotto of 15.
A lotto was some schmuck here, almost 16 million cash last night.
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
I'm going to be here right now.
It's only that I won 10 bucks, it's all.
Going for 16 million, I got like 10 bucks.
Not too good.
But one of these days, when you least expect it,
see that's when it is, when you're expecting to win something big,
it doesn't happen.
Like that old bag that won a 3.2 million casino Niagara two days ago.
For tickets.
Well, what do you mean it's ridiculous?
You won 3.2 million.
On one pull.
On a slot machine.
On a slot machine.
It's a progressive jackpot, baby.
It's the mega bucks.
Why do you think they call it mega bucks?
The big bucks, baby.
3.2 million.
And that's cash.
No tax.
No annuity.
No BS.
When you win something here, they just hand you a check.
And that's it.
The full amount.
Tax-free.
As opposed to the Florida lottery, which is the most stupid,
I'd like to show you what a hypocrite your fat ass government
will legislate your art.
They're running the biggest scam in the history of the human race,
the lotto.
Well, if you win, you can either take it in one lump sum,
which is much less than the announced prize,
or in annuity, 20 years, you know.
Well, I guess depending on the amount down here,
not everything is taxed, because when my buddy won that 10 grand,
they just wrote him a check for 10 grand, and they gave him a room.
I hate to break the news to you, but he's got to declare that.
Any gambling winnings on your income tax, I mean, you know,
you just don't give your buddies name on here, but I won't.
You have to declare that.
Well, you know, I'm very happy.
He's supposed to pay tax on that.
But here, when you win something like that, whatever it is,
they just write your check, and there's no tax on it.
And that's the way it should be.
Why don't you...
I mean, life is so short, and you're very rarely ever win anything
of any significance, and you win something big,
and you've got to like, pay taxes on it, so they can flush it down to toilet,
and pay all kinds of 9-11 relief to businesses that were affected by it,
like in South Dakota radio stations, and subway,
and what was the other piece of induncan doughnuts?
Come on, man.
There's a lot of coffee there.
Taking all of our money, just squeezing the blood out of us,
so we're like, a human sponge, to just squeeze the damn life blood out of us,
so they could pee away our money right down the old toilet.
And I'm talking about, it's not a political thing.
It's both parties. They're all a bunch of crooks.
They're all having a big party, at your expense.
Although there's people in New Orleans now, if you just wait,
just hang on. Help is a coming.
Any of the wealth is coming?
Remember that song?
Hmm, Boats is a coming.
Let's have word that goes before Boats.
See?
Boats is a coming. That's it.
See, I finally gave you a chance, because the Raymond doesn't advertise in the shrimp
and the animal co-spot for a while now, so.
You've got to keep that word, keep it polished up.
Yeah.
Pala shop your CM.
5670560.
Town 560 Verizon, Singular Riders, Signs,
you're number one wish for 2006. WQAN, hello.
Hey Neal, how you doing? Happy New Year.
I'll only get to you about that money getting stuff down the Dunkin' Donuts.
Dunkin' Donuts is owned by the terrorists.
Don't you get it? Wish me to the terrorists.
So they make more bombs like a bomb is again.
Okay, great.
5670560, pound 560 on the Verizon and Signs, you know.
What?
Now I didn't know, and neither was anybody else because I hit the button.
Oh, I'm just not putting that kind of crap on you know.
We just know, not just the last day of the year,
do we need any grief, any fallout from that?
Because you know what we, oh, did you hear what they said about the,
oh, whoever, you know.
Anybody who's doing business anywhere.
We love everybody who's in business.
Retail, wholesale, whatever.
Does anybody QAM, hello?
QAM?
Yes.
Is this me?
This is me.
Is this me?
Happy New Year.
Same to you.
I can't believe no one has ever brought the troops home,
but both are winning the lottery.
Yeah.
I vote for bring the troops home.
Okay.
And, you know, I guess it's a lot of selfish people out there.
No kidding, man.
You just discovered that?
Yes.
I guess so.
And guess what?
President Likens got a bad headache too.
Listen, happy New Year, Pallied, all the best.
How about getting a raise for 2006?
Getting a raise is good.
Put that on there.
Getting a nice raise.
Would be excellent.
It's my vote.
Okay.
Getting a raise.
There's the Josh's vote.
I got another one.
Getting a, how do we phrase it?
Getting a great general manager at QAM.
Okay.
What do you laugh at about?
No.
Do you like that?
We would like that.
Getting somebody who would set aside their big fat ego
in their pomposity and sports nudiness and just, you know,
you just want getting a good general manager?
Getting a good GM at QAM.
Kind of has a little ring to it.
Good GM at QAM.
A.
98 votes.
What's your number one wish for the year?
Impete George W. W. Bush has got.
Look at how many votes.
Stop turning, man.
I think it's a Dunkin' Donuts thing.
When the lotto 19, all our troops come home.
I embarrass people devoting for that even though they don't
really give a crap about our troops, which is very, very sad.
14.
To have lots of sex, 12.
Good health, 9.
Democrats with the election 7.
Get a better job, 3.
QAM gets sold and Neil gets paid off.
2.
Correct the vote.
You did the worst one.
Peace out earth one.
Pink Floyd, we even didn't have any and put suds and brick back
on the years got none.
Out of the first, I bet you we got 100 votes.
We take a puke at it.
Now that it re-105.
See, we didn't do this pool before we wanted to why?
Why?
Because it was never going to be 2006 before.
What was that, why?
Well, I mean, it's probably a pretty good reason.
5670560, pound 562, the Verizon Singular wireless lines.
Any big games coming up?
We got the Montreal Canadian's, the frogs in town.
What is this?
How about that Chick-fil-A peach bowl?
You know, I don't want to pick on coach co-head, but that's just that is so embarrassing to me.
Why does he have to say that?
Talk about being the ultimate chill.
I mean, couldn't you just say the peach bowl?
We know that all these bowl games now have these sponsors and everybody.
All about like that.
Yeah.
Throw in the plug.
But cheesy, you know, you just being, you just threw like a little promo here to where.
The Chick-fil-A peach bowl, get out.
It sounds so tacky, doesn't it?
So cheesy.
Chick-fil-A, my ass.
Anyway, we got the Montreal Canadians tomorrow night at the, oh, and look at that.
Now that, oh, and that's right, you're right.
Tomorrow's the night for the Chick-fil-A peach bowl.
Yes, tomorrow.
The Hurricanes and the LSU Tigers and the Chick-fil-A peach bowl.
Wow.
So that's on QAM and the Panther game is on 1360 on KD.
Oh, that is scandalous.
That is outrageous.
The way the Panthers are playing right now.
Playing really hot.
We're trying to generate some interest now.
And Cone is thinking about finding a radio station and sucking up heavy duty at the track with Hank.
That is really bad.
Hey, we love you, Alan.
You make it all the right moves.
The Panthers are great.
We love everything they're doing.
They had 25,000 people at the game last night.
For Asians is Neil Rogers.
This is 560 QAM.
This is the Neil Rogers show.
This is your brain.
Any questions?
Would you like to become a sports color commentator on prime time television?
Why not enroll in the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting?
Okay, please.
Let's start at square one.
It's not a fall, it's a pink skin.
Okay?
It's not a playground.
It's a gridiron.
I never ever called them a crowd when you can refer to them as a teaming multi-dinner of kinetic enthusiasm.
Okay?
At the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting, learn how to fill time between plays with spontaneous down-to-earth batter to which the working neck can easily relate.
Okay, class.
Repeat after me.
Here we go.
I haven't seen blacking like that since the cavalry sequence in breath of a nation.
I haven't seen blacking like that since...
At the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting, Dennis Miller himself will teach you how to construct the entire sentences using nothing but made upwards.
Oh man, Al.
What an ostentatious malaprism of unpillinated, nine-and-sake.
So if you were a fan of such legendary sportscasters at John Matten, Terry Bradshaw and John Meredith, then you should attend the Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting and become nothing like them.
I folks on Dennis Miller reminding you that classes would start this week.
Well, I view on the air making references to the House of Plans, passionate and just six weeks.
The Dennis Miller School of Broadcasting.
It will today be for Dennis' unceremoniously fired at the end of the season.
Oh yeah, well, guess what.
Actually, last the whole season, I don't remember.
Yeah, I remember one.
That's how memorable it was. That was a real great experiment.
That's another reason that ABC Monday Night Football has gone.
Between them and the ESPN with Rush and with Dennis Miller, some really brilliant moves there.
And I scroll at ABC and by the way, we'll say a prayer for you at the end of the newscaster every night.
Maybe we'll just engage in some of that good Christian wrestling, sounds good.
Yeah, let me know.
I wish you would have seen that segment.
You would have just shaken your head and wondered...
What is this? What are you really made that up on?
Now, what is wrestling, we have to do with the religion.
Although, of course, a lot of lifeless people...
I have no right.
It is a religion.
You know, the WWE and the WWE F and the WWE, WWE, and all these other WWE's.
Of course, there's only one WWE that this audience is obsessed with and that is we want him out right now.
Bye-bye, WWE.
I see impeach his ass now before the New Year. It would be good.
That's leading so far in Peach George's W. Bush 36.
You know, Baba had a little hummler situation going on there and like that,
all he lied about is sex life and a right.
His nose was rolling like Pinocchio.
And the main time, here's a guy that's sacrificing over 2,000 American lives and thousands and thousands of Iraqis.
They estimate it's like maybe up to 50 or 60,000 dead civilians over there, men and women and little kids.
Not to mention all the people who are missing body parts, minor things like that.
Based on a pack of lies, based on a whole neocon plot and plan.
That was a good article by Marine Duggesta that I read about Dick Cheney.
I mean, she put her thumb right on it as usual.
Cheney and Rumsfeld, it goes back to Ford and Bush 1 and this is just, this is part of the whole
and Wolfowitz and Bill Crystal and all these other Nazis, man.
These people, what you had is a bloodless coup in America,
a bunch of right-wing elunatics, and taken over control of the government with two fixed elections in a row.
And it's like the media is oblivious to it and the public is worried about the, is Dick Clark really going to be on New Year's Eve?
You know, we'll put in hell as Ryan Seacrest.
So it's just amazing the kind of crap that they keep people obsessed with, you know?
Yeah.
You're not eating now, are you? That would be bad.
Yeah. How can you be eating food today on this week?
I'm actually going nuts today.
You know, I really haven't ordered anything this whole week and so I went to town today with, I got my how-is on.
Yeah. But I just ordered all of this food from bread.
No, that's going, yeah.
Just the good people at how-is, hooked it up.
Or just from how-is. Thanks to how-is for putting up with us, okay, and feeding everybody.
And quick feeding the Hank, okay, we'd like to have him alive for the New Year. God.
Dominic, QYM, hello.
Hey, I'm Camille, how you doing?
Pretty good. Happy New Year.
And back to you.
My wish for the New Year is that the Neil Rogers show gets indicated nationwide.
Yeah.
Or is that-
You must have started drinking early for New Year's, I'll tell you.
Oh, God. No, no, nothing like that.
Just, you know, it sounds like a good idea.
Yeah. Oh, I think it's a great idea, but then again, when you got an agent like I got, you know, who's a silly-
You're fair.
Yeah, maybe it's time to see Kyra ground.
No, I'm just- I'm just phasing out, you know, I'm just counting down the days.
Well, I love you, you know, Kat, your days, then, you know, to everybody on the planet here,
because everybody needs to hear the truth.
Yeah, well, they can't handle the truth.
Have a great New Year's, we don't-
Oh, can I make a shame with the question, I'm going at it.
You can deliver like-
Motel 666.
Now, is that got anything like-
Oh, yeah, that's okay.
Totally clean.
That's as clean as it gets.
Okay, I have a happy-
You too.
Bye-bye.
Hi, I'm Tom B. L's Bubb from Motel 666.
Here to tell you about our Halloween special.
If you're a Satan worshipper on a budget, why not stay at Motel 666 over Halloween night and take advantage of our special rates package?
It includes a cold and uncomfortable room, plenty of floor space for Richell Danson, plus a TV set that gets the Registin-Cathy Lee show.
There's even a hellhole behind the bed.
And to top it off, the manager will come by with complimentary drinks, just specify type A, type O, B, or AB.
So bring the entire family to Motel 666 on Halloween and we'll leave a burn and go down for you.
All right.
Neil gets indicated.
Get that on there too.
Okay, not going to get any votes, but put that on there anyway.
Make her happy.
Sure.
And she asks you, and I mean, how many other people in the audience would know that bit by name when you come right down to it?
It's a little on the obscure side.
She's a real student of this show.
Maybe she stayed there before.
Could be.
Maybe she was hanging out with Tom Bode.
56670560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line.
Oh, there's your line nine.
It's Josh's line.
Hello, QAM.
Yeah, there he is.
How many QAM, hello?
Yeah, but afternoon, Anthony.
Good afternoon.
Good evening.
But today is for, I'm just wondering, for next year, my wish was that one of the local teams go undefeated, maybe the dolphins.
Yeah.
And I was trying to get you the other day for the other poll because David Spade, I think, could give Paris spirits an a run.
David Spade.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
What's in your wallet?
I don't think David Spade is on what's in your wallet?
He's on his spot.
Yeah.
What was?
Yeah.
Why didn't we know that it was David Spade?
Which one is David Spade?
The one who's not funny.
Yeah.
That's right.
Yeah.
I can't say I'm not valid.
I should share this for great.
Yes.
You remember the whole more bitter with Aronde.
No, we can't play that good.
We're good luck to pal.
You know, no chance.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
No chance.
Joyce would have a, she'd have a nervous breakdown.
She'd have a stroke right on the spot.
In fact, maybe that's why we ought to play it.
So that's David Spade?
Yeah.
I never made the connection.
I love those spots.
It's kind of like his old Chris Farley movies.
Those spots are really funny, but it's not because of him.
Yeah.
Those are one of the best-to-end campaigns I've ever seen in my life.
In fact, I enjoy when the, I enjoy it.
I enjoy when the commercial break comes on during a show.
I totally agree.
What's in your wallet?
Yeah, there's a new one now where the guy is on like a sled.
Christmas sled and he goes flying with a reindeer through.
Or just a beautiful thing.
Yes.
5.670560.
Well, let's put David Spade on yesterday's pool.
What do you say?
Oh, too late.
Sorry.
Or we just put him on some future pool.
Whatever pool George does tomorrow, Tom put David Spade on it.
Okay.
W-Q-A-M.
Oh, yeah.
I'm trying to reach Neil.
You're speaking to him.
No way.
No way?
Well, okay.
I made this with somebody else.
This is personal.
Ah, it's great.
It is great.
Look, and I just wanted to thank you for all the years of enjoying your show.
And I wanted to add something to the pool as possible.
You bet.
I'd like to see in the two plus and six very far-row and Pat Robertson caught David's team
in a, and smoking crab.
Yeah, a little transvestite prostitute in New Orleans.
All right.
Okay.
Thanks, pal.
All right.
We'll work on it.
Maybe Jim Baker can hook him up.
Okay.
I don't think there's a way for us to put that on there.
But, you know, we get the drift.
5.670.
And let's see.
How about the, for the other guy that called me for, how about a South Florida championship,
a South Florida sports championship?
Okay.
Does that work for us?
Boy, you're sure picking out, man.
What do you got there?
Oh, man.
I went nuts today.
I got a, why is that?
Because, I don't know.
I just felt like it.
I had a nice wood by day yesterday.
It was an expensive diet.
I mean, I lost a few bucks.
I've not made, not a major disaster, but not too good.
I got to eat it up to keep me, keep me full till Bernie Kosegar stay calved tonight.
Because I'm going to tell you, oh, you get to go to that?
Well, they asked me to today.
So I said, yeah.
And so you get to, you get a free meal over there.
Now, maybe what's his name?
Maybe there, maybe a bread from the Orchard be there, hogging up some free food, too.
How can you guys?
How can this and that and does?
What a, what a, what a, shh.
Mucky.
Goes in there and he starts throwing his weight around.
I want the steak and I want all the, uh, coupraments and I want this and that, uh, what,
he's anything new in the account.
I'm going to go in there and suck up a bunch of freebies because he thinks he's a big shot.
Because he's on our sales staff.
Oh, my God.
There, there are, there are more, um, by far, there are more prestigious people at
the same time.
I, I, you know, it's going to be really interesting.
I know I keep belly aching about it.
It's not about business because I'm not there anyway, but it just, uh, grinds my fat, old,
grizzled ass that there's just nothing going on in there.
It's like, uh, the whole place is doing the limbo rock.
And we have gotten, we got no idea who the manager is, who the operations manager is.
If there is one, we got no idea who the sports liaison guy is.
If there's going to be one, we got the clearest.
He's got no idea which side is up.
But he does like his Jaguar.
Even though he says that screw and let the distinct, uh, aroma in it.
I don't know what he meant by that.
He said it's an aroma that could put you in a coma.
I'm not sure what he was talking about, but I think I got some idea.
I'm getting the drift.
But that, that, it's just, uh, there's nothing, people think we're, and Hank, you know, saying the same thing.
We're not just making this up.
Nobody's got any clue what the hell of a new year holds at QAIM.
Because there were like, uh, orphans now, like step chillin's.
Nothing worth it being a step chillin.
Nope.
Somebody QAIM, hello.
QAIM, hello.
Raise your paper, call it on the air.
Not you. QAIM, hello.
Happy New Year, Neil.
Back to you.
I have one for the fall.
Yeah.
Getting rid of Joyce and getting a real attorney for your station.
No, okay, that sounds good.
Joyce gets fired.
That sounds good to me.
Joyce gets canned at Beasley.
Got it?
Bye-bye, Joyce.
Don't let the adorage in the ass on the way out.
Oh, we better speak nice about Joyce because she's a corporate legal, you know?
You bitch, you slut, you whore.
Yeah, totally.
I put her in the same category with clearance, although personally we like clearance, see?
So I put her in the same category professionally.
Way overhead, no experience, no background.
She's drowning in a sea of incompetence.
Can't play the fart sounds.
Can't say this.
Can't, and we reach the point where we finally stop asking our, um, middle level management types to ask her
because no matter what though we would ask her, how can we do it?
No, no, can we say that?
No.
No, whatever it is.
How about hello and goodbye?
What do you think?
No.
No, it's all offensive.
Everything is offensive to that bitch, okay?
And, she probably hangs out with Donna Shalaley.
She probably had her fine finger in that hole deal with at the billboard campaign.
We got balls.
Oh, well, the university of Miami doesn't want to be associated.
Yeah, the up at the university of Miami would all its long history of slime balls and criminal
holes, man.
Oh, give me a break.
What a joke.
You can drive all over this town and the fan has got all these billboards everywhere.
We got balls, the fan, whatever the hell their frequency is.
It's just, you know, every sports station in America has got that.
But not QAM, not what they, uh, we had, actually I'll give credit to Greg for that.
There was one thing we did.
We kept the billboards up.
We just took the hurricane logo off of it because Donna Shalaley was so offended.
Hey, Donna, you're pathetic on it.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.16.2.8.
It's a bitch.
This is the ZBS ZP-News with Dan Ruther reporting from CBS News headquarters in New York.
Greening this is Dan Ruther reporting.
In fucking news today, this report has just confirmed that President George W. Bush is
a raging pirate.
A gun just looking river man's stormer.
No, really, we didn't make it this time.
According to recently or at least eight recordings made several years ago,
President Bush is clearly indicating that he and me have cried marijuana at some time in the past.
This startling revelation makes me explain his word speech,
questionable intelligence, and this appearance from National Guard duty during the Vietnam era.
No, I just can't let that one go, sorry.
Not wanting to say I told you so, this reporter will take the high road and say only.
And that's part of our world.
The satisfying, vindictive, I hope you're having a huge stupid red state bastard spark.
I'm a land rather important for CBS News.
Get ready for the Zorias CD you've never heard.
Dan Ruther, sorry to us.
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
Not only does Dan sing a sorry to wet with Brenda Lee,
he sounds even sorry with Chicago.
It's time to be the stage.
I'm sorry.
What?
Dan Ruther, sorry to us.
Features this, sorry sing along with Ruby study.
It's like a Mr. Shad, it's like a drop the ball.
I'm sorry.
Order now.
And if you're not completely satisfied,
Dan Ruther will personally say, I'm sorry.
I may be the only one, but I sure as much as Dan Ruther and CBS News,
I'm going to say that right now.
I realize they're rating sucked and all the other crap.
But I watched that for years, CBS, whether it was Walter Cronkite or Danny Boy or whatever.
And I got old funny daddy Bob Schiefer, which I watched once and wouldn't be called deadwatching the game.
And I'm stuck with Martian looking Brian Williams on NBC.
And then even got to shoved over there a couple of times,
they'd be seeing to get that religion, that religious sermon there,
that little sermon at the end of the show every night about the Christian videos and the Christian wrestling,
and the Christian news, and the Christian ball movements, and the Christian chakis,
and the Christian everything.
Oh man, like I said, go ahead and go on wild.
That's the motto for 2005.
It's a miracle the rest of us are still alive.
They hit us with five shots.
And we're still alive.
How do you like that?
I just love the way he says that in the movie.
Yes.
We hit him with five shots and he's still alive.
He was good.
So let's go.
Good with the knife, but only in matters of business.
217 votes on the pool.
Why is this one of those things?
At least Josh has seen it, Godfather.
I bet your parts won't end too.
I have, yeah.
Not three though.
No, not three.
I would see it.
So it's got to bad acting.
I would see it though.
Your life isn't complete until you see the third part.
I'll tell you right now, I'm going to see Magnolia.
Maybe sometime this weekend.
Really?
If I can get it from here.
This weekend you're going to watch it?
Well, I didn't expect that kind of quick response.
I'll try to watch it over sometime during the week or before you get back on Tuesday.
Yeah.
Just to force me to watch CD of God, which I don't want to.
Right, well.
Well, there's always one.
One is so lonely.
It's no longer that you ever do.
See, you know what?
This reminds me of it's like flavors of ice cream.
Nobody needs to tell me that heavenly hash or rocky road or fish food.
These are phenomenal sensational flavors of ice cream.
So if you like vanilla better, that's fine.
But don't try to tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about.
I know my crap.
Okay.
It's the same thing with movies.
Magnolia is one of the, I would say if it isn't that everybody's top 25 list,
then you haven't seen it.
A wall time.
And maybe top 10.
It's just a fabulous movie.
I mean, granted, it doesn't make a lot of sense in it, but then again it's a movie, you know?
Okay.
And post make a lot of sense.
Including when the frogs start falling out of the sky.
Or I shouldn't have said that, but you already know that.
No, actually, I'm pretty sure I know absolutely nothing about this movie.
Oh.
Well, like I said, there's no frogs.
The frogs will only be at the hockey game tomorrow night.
That's what I was talking about.
56070560, pound 560, and they've arrived in Singular, wireless line.
Now, yes, I played like little segments there.
We had a two or three of Danny, rather, bits there in a row.
Maybe we were like, do segments.
Okay.
And it's now where we have a, of mobits would be good.
Yeah, just play it all.
See how long it is.
Oh, that's fun.
No, come on.
Don't start.
And it's more out of the way.
Okay, good.
Yeah, okay.
Well, maybe we will play them all.
All the ones that we can still play.
Okay, we can't play that Aronde.
And who was it?
That was Chris and Aronde and Aronde.
Who ever the hell of the other one was?
Can't do that one no more.
Believe you may.
But we certainly got enough to make a nice segment.
56070560, pound 560, you're wondering how come he keeps giving the number out so much today?
Well, it's the last show of the year and it kills a lot of good time.
You're just anxious to talk to all those who call her.
No, I'm not.
WQYM, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I got one for you.
What's the difference between the Neal and Roger's shit on a toilet?
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
WQYM, hello.
Yes, good morning, Neil.
I thank you for taking my call.
Well, good morning and thanks for making your call.
Yeah, I'd like to add this to your poll, if I may.
Yes.
I'd like to start off, Florida, turn into a first class gambling mecca for 2006.
Yeah.
And I think one good way is going to be in about the next five days, the opening of Gulf Stream Park.
Is going to turn it into a gambling mecca.
Well, that's correct, sir.
They're going to have the Vegas style slot machines.
Uh-huh.
And then soon to follow, of course, the Indians will then want to have the next tier,
which would be Relette and Blackjack.
Right.
Of course, a year after that, then the stable realize they're losing so much revenue.
Right, yeah.
No problem.
They're going to legalize casino gambling all over the city.
I'd say to whatever you're smoking, pass the peat, pass the pipe, okay?
Woo!
Heavy duty.
Yeah, we'll be Vegas in no time.
And enjoy yourself, by the way, at Gulf Stream, with all those old facts over there.
5667.0560.
£560, and they've arrived.
I only wish the best for the folks at Gulf Stream be good, but if they just keep bringing back Gary Puckett,
the union gap, not a good idea, and Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge.
I mean, some of the sale acts that they bring back.
I think I got like a little bacon bit stuck in my throat.
Man, I had a lot of bacon myself.
Did you really?
Eh, hell, be careful now.
Eat too much of that how he's bacon.
It's really great, but they always said over like 15,000 slabs of it.
Slams.
I love it.
And at one time I ate so much of it, and it was just sliding out, man.
I just I had sliders for like, oh boy.
Speaking of turl it, I was busy.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
That's our best call so far.
Q-A-M, hello.
Yeah, you know it's a nail?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I was just wondering.
I don't know if you had listening to Howard the other day, the no-meister there.
He was here.
He had made a comment and he was calling you, Neil.
I guess you know who cares?
Grow up already.
Where did you please get a life?
Get a freaking life.
I'm not interested in talking overgrown children, okay?
Mao said this.
Did you know I didn't listen to Howard?
I'd listen to anybody else's.
I don't listen to this radio station or any other one either.
How do you like that?
I actually have a life.
Did you hear what this one said about you?
Did you hear what Joey Reynolds said?
Did you hear what Dickie Parkle said?
See, this is one reason that the call sucked, okay?
It's because most of the people out there, like, first of all, you got all the talk show groupies like this guy.
Did you hear what So-It-So said about the mad dog?
And you hear what the Hank said about Mao?
Did you hear what Neil said about Randy?
Get a life.
Get a freaking life.
I have no idea.
Get a search party.
That should be, you know, something?
That's for the pool.
That's a good one.
You're number one wish for 2006.
I find a life.
Oh, God, that should zoom to the top.
I find a life.
Because I would say about at least 50% of the people we talk to, their motto is...
I have no life.
W.Q.A.M. Hello.
Speak to Neil Rogers.
Speaking.
What do you think about how he is, you man?
Cowboy?
W.Q.A.M. Hello.
Hey, you seem broke bad mountain yet.
No, I have not.
Have you seen it?
Yeah, real story about real cowboy love.
Okay, right, I'm cowboy.
Bear back mountain.
Haven't seen that one yet, no.
And I bet you he has seen it in the movie too.
W.Q.A.M. Hello.
You know.
Yeah, I want to speak to Neil.
Speaking.
Hi, Neil.
How are you?
Good.
I'm calling wishing that for 2006 president Bush takes this avian bird pandemic seriously.
Because I don't know if you read Markle the other day that they had a drill at the White House.
Everybody took part in it and he had to go right in the fight.
And I think that's what I think.
Uh-huh.
And also I was wondering if I could make a same with request.
Sure, but I hope it's better than the other part.
Yeah.
That you play one of the eyes and events that you played yesterday like both friends daughters in town and the hysterical.
We, I'm begging you play.
I want to female listeners that listen every day.
One of the ten we go.
Okay, thanks.
We have a great new year.
Thanks.
Bye.
Okay, 26 past 11.
It's a little bad phone connection there, but never less, right?
A little bit.
Just work our way through all of these things, all these glitches.
Because glitches can be bitches when you're trying to do a radio show, but never less.
It is the QMF in Wayne.
We are broadcasting an HD.
Is there anybody out there that has a HD here receiver?
No.
But boy, it would sound phenomenal.
I would sound just like Westbrook Van Voorhees, Watercront Heiden, Edward Armero, all rolled into one.
If you just only had a nice HD set.
This is Neil Rudd.
Anybody believe me?
No.
This is 5.62 AM.
Don't it.
I told you.
Don't bother me while I'm in here.
I, sir.
Hello?
It's Mickey Mouse.
Oh, Mr. Mouse.
Good morning.
How are you?
What the hell are you doing to me?
Nothing, sir.
You're freaking killing me.
No, not.
I got David Kelly calling me every three minutes.
Why did we move the practice?
Sir, you told me to move the practice.
I didn't tell you anything.
You must have misunderstood me.
No, sir.
You said move the practice to Monday.
Hey, hey.
Listen, butt wipe.
I'm the boss.
I make the decisions.
You take the heat.
Right.
You all move the practice.
Okay.
How are we going with it anyway?
I am mad.
Hold on.
I'm going to be...
Remus.
Yeah, boss.
Shut the hell up.
I'm on the phone, Remus.
Hi, sir.
Yes, sir.
What was your question?
I'm telling you.
I'm going crazy over here.
Between David Kelly and now Michael Jackson called me every three minutes.
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.
Hold on.
Remus.
Get him off.
Stop it, Remus.
I'm going to go out of my freaking mind.
Hold on.
Remus!
It's like this in my hand, Remus.
That's your penis, boss.
My other hand, Remus.
That's a phone, boss.
Right.
I can't hear anything, Remus.
Stop sawing the floor.
Sorry.
I said, sir.
Sir, the moves are working out very well.
The practice is four minutes times one.
And what?
And what?
And what?
And what?
What?
And what?
And what?
And what?
And what?
I, trow, trow.
And the picture seni was covered with teeth.
Then everything was integral.
Now gloves and gnoc.
Thank you, Luc.
Let the photography go.
You see me what I'm doing here?
Sir, you're on the phone.
I know I'm on the phone.
Do you see what I'm doing?
You hear imagination for crying out loud.
I'm moving my hands up and down, slide aside.
I'm the puppet master.
I say it.
You do it.
Now Fox is going to air all the stuff
that you cut out of a Michael Jackson interview.
But sir, you told me to edit out all that stuff
to make him look like a...
Puppet master, me.
Idiot!
Oh!
Oh!
Green!
Yes, you have a sauce on hell you doing now!
It's in the floor, boss.
It's nothing wrong with the floor, Remus.
What's this in my ear?
That's your penis, boss.
My other ear, Remus.
That's the phone, boss.
That's the phone, Remus.
Get out.
Get over the word.
Get out.
I, sir.
Yes, sir.
Get on me.
Get on me.
I'm sorry, sir.
Get on me.
Sorry.
Get on me, softly.
I, sir.
Mr. Mouse.
What the hell are you doing to me?
What do you mean, sir?
Why am I reading in the paper?
You're going to put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn?
Well, sir, we're just scouting locations.
Jesus, I'm scouting CEOs.
You are killing me.
But sir, what we've done with New York City Times Square.
We're not in street.
And on.
Remus.
Remus!
We're all the vacuum cleaner, Remus.
Get that blue bird out of here.
Oh, hey, boss.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Look what we've done with Midtown Manhattan.
40 Second Street is incredible.
I don't know what publicly I supported that.
But you took all the porn away.
You're killing me.
I'm going through a gabboscon like kids.
We're just scouting areas calm down.
Listen to me, but much.
Don't tell me to calm down.
We got lucky with Lee Loan's stage.
$128 million.
Now, you're trying to ruin the whole network.
What kind of programming are you running?
Hang on a minute.
Three, two, go.
Remus, you've got blue bird crap all over your shoulder.
Bring yourself up or heaven's sake.
And head off the module, cleaner.
Okay, boss.
Good God.
Sir, the network is fine.
Why couldn't you come up with American Idol?
Good God.
You're still running James Bond movie.
There's 60 years old.
Why don't you just put steamboat really on and be done with it?
Please sign.
Make a couple of damn dollars.
Well, the movie division's fine.
You mentioned Lee Loan's vision.
Now we have the new M. Night Shumelon movie coming out later this summer.
Ah, it has signs.
What the hell does that mean?
Stop sign, yield sign.
You've got to start swinging some of these titles past me.
Please.
Remus.
Remus.
I know you can't hear me.
Remus.
You're still running the vacuum cleaner.
You're done.
I'm not running the vacuum cleaner.
Get on here, Remus.
And take that blue bird with you.
All right.
Hi, sir.
Yes, sir.
I'd be very careful the next time I started my car.
Why were you?
What do you mean, sir?
I'm not done with you.
What?
Bad done.
I'm a perennial storm in your job.
But sir, I'm here.
I'm not a perennial storm.
Maybe I put limits in there.
I don't like to be president of Disney Remus.
Oh, my.
What a wonderful day.
Can I hear you, nutbag?
Hey, there's a little bonus for you, too, for the price of one.
How do you like that?
According to the new report from Bridge Ratings, whatever the hell that is, I think that's one
of those rating systems when you see the numbers you want to go to nearest Bridge and Jump.
Nearly 60% of the serious satellite radio sunnifts in the last shopping days before Christmas
can be credited to a listed desire to hear former syndicated morning host Howard Stearns.
I'm coming show on serious which debuts January 9th.
Bridge Ratings interviews said by radio consumers at retail outlets during the fourth quarter
or to determine what impact marketing campaigns and Stern in particular were having on
subscriber counts during the important shopping period.
The company says that in October, 22% of serious sunnifts could be credited to a desired
to hear Stern, but the number is growing steadily by the week of December 19, a full 58%
of serious sunnifts would do the Stern's imminent move to subscription radio.
I don't like that. The power of Howard. See that? The power of...
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Not that Howard. Wow.
Are you excited? No.
Oh, you're not signed up. No, not.
Of course you didn't listen to Howard when he was on for free, so why would you pay for it?
Oh, I did. Well, I wasn't like, I didn't listen to it.
Oh, I'm talking about when he was on our station.
Oh, no, no. I'm not talking about the old Howard Stearns show when it was funny, and you know,
you would actually go out of your way to listen to it. I'm not talking about those days.
No, I didn't. Listen to it.
I've been on the car for over the past seven years. Nope.
Lieutenant Joe Schillaki.
Schillachi. See, there's a harness driver, Sam Schillachi, who drives the Northfield Park in Cleveland.
So I think that's how this guy pronounces his name.
Lieutenant Joe Schillachi pulls his unmarked car behind the dumpster and hunkers down,
using binoculars to watch a car that a murder suspect is supposed to get into.
And gagal teenage girls ambles by. It doesn't take long before he is made.
The term undercover cop uses for somebody recognizing a police officer.
One of the girls calls out, hey, I know you were on the first 48.
It happens all the time to Schillachi, who on this night in his uniform,
trying to be inconspicuous, but not bothering with trying to be invisible.
He just can't do it no more. No more over the past three years.
Schillachi's become the breakout star of an A&E TV reality show.
The first 48 about homicide detectives attracted detectives for the first 48 hours after murder.
Washington trying to find a killer.
Schillachi attracted a following with viewers gushing over each episode on A&E's online bulletin boards.
His run on the first 48 and this past fall when he was promoted to Lieutenant Transfer back to his old unit,
jumped out as the undercover squad is informally known in Miami.
But Schillachi took the cameras with him.
He's filming a pilot about running the undercover unit.
Maybe he's like a candle coffee and never met a camera.
He didn't like.
Candle coffee was on CNN again this morning talking crap.
Case anybody missed it.
Undercover working TV started a wouldn't seem a perfect fit for Schillachi.
His company key and make it work as a supervisor.
Schillachi won't be called on to do undercover often.
When he does, he sure he can pull it off to have probably need to elaborate disguises.
He spent five years undercover before moving to homicide and drug holes.
He's often recognized as ponytail because of the one he grew to dirty up his clean cut appearance.
Ponytail.
He sure haven't heard that a long time.
That was quite a story that who was it?
Miguel told me that.
That was something.
Bye bye Jeff.
Bye showing.
Bye bye.
It's love.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love is in his pony tail.
It's love the beautiful little beautiful pony tail.

I just move on with a David.
I'll see here.
Got a new gig here.
And if I had so choose to stay, I will change the face of whatever that is told.
Now see here, who did more for radio.
New Rogers or Hoi Baskar Anderson.
Huh?
Hello again.
Here's my best view.
Are you guys all right?
I'm all right.
Hoi Baskar Anderson.
That's who.
A one thing, he was the mayor of boarding radion.
And at Pitchmokka, he ain't no mayor.
Why Hoi Baskar Anderson sang nice song.
Oh, he had a beautiful voice.
Are you guys all right?
That ain't no radio.
Don't sing those songs on the nutted in me.
Wait, don't annoy me.
Why sure?
That's a Neil singing in the destroy reaching songs about the go to the noir.
And then in the back of the one who he writes in it, and he'll sing them.
Now you know he's queer.
But real men don't sing.
And another thing, Hoi Baskar Anderson.
It was a lot better than the old too.
That there's what they did best.
And the next installment of Housey Here.
Who made a better cup of coffee?
Mrs. Olson or Jackie Robinson?
Gammal.

You'll see.
I showed after today.
Yeah.
How do we police are investigating a rape allegation against an FSU football player who was there while practicing for the team's orange bull game against Penn State Penn?
The incident reportedly happened around three o'clock this morning at the Western Divilment Resort in Spawn, Hollywood.
Hollywood police wouldn't identify the player who was facing the accusations.
FSU escaped into play state, Penn on T-Dead.
How do you like that?
Another slime ball alleged anyway at FSU.
Must be a mistake.
I'm sure.
How's that pool coming?

Absolutely.
Nothing exists outside the gay world of sports.
Yeah, might of way some.
They paid me to oggle and admit.
This here is a show for men.
A belt man like this.
Milly bears and chaps.

There was no Dr. Browns.
Just don't face the same without the Dr. Browns.
That's rudist.
And that's my own standard.
Good night.
And kiss my ass.

I'm a big star, you know.
Grandma, I'm only cake.
I just want to touch your head.
Come on, baby.
I just want to see.
Don't miss the Mo.
Howling show each and every morning on 5.60 W.U.A.L.
But anybody cares anymore, because you're most of the audience off already, so why not?
Oh.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
I'm a big star, you know.
That's my pizza.
That's my pizza.
That's my pizza.
I get dirty little.
I don't care if it was your start to death, it's no good sign of it.
I'll have you know it's more important for me to survive.
You've read me by so number-a-cheeing in title, it's a design.
I only had a little bit of a shmit in a sliver of my sliver of the pizza.
I'd watch your pizza.
I'll take that pizza.
I'll take that pizza.
I don't promote the prestigious Kakafoni or the Mojave de Jor.
That's what I mean by where's the love?
Another chestnut.
My baggy pants would fill style of you man.
I can't know like that.
Where is the love?
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Here we go.
You know what this reminds me of the time I bought an SRS?
And all the time I thought I was buying this sports car.
I'm here, what do you know what you say, Dr. Dudley?
John, it's you again.
I hear you specialize in SRS.
What is that?
It's a narrow area.
How many horsepower?
Time of faith, you don't understand.
It's a sex change.
Well, since I'm already here.
What is your problem?
No, Dr. Dudley.
I've always been a lesbian.
And when you were with the white coat and a quick board and all this talk about Harriet Myers of this...
So, you don't want an SRS?
Yeah, yeah.
Before the recon mirror dice in an 8-track.
Okay, here.
Let me check your ears.
Sure.
Second of the grade matter, huh?
I don't think Idaho has seen this many potatoes.
I'll see you in bed.
You can keep your pants on.
Now, pin wide.
Woof!
Go away.
Go to the door, go to the door.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away.
Go to the door, go to the door.
Go away.
And I take it over wood that you你 said the day is here.
You should have let it all in to talk about me, Rahul Ayskis.
I don't give a crack with that fairy has to say it.
If he wants, of course, he should ask them what I have to do to him.
I all have you know, I know what I'm talking about.
Every morning at the condo, I could see elevated down.
And on my way to the hall when I told my folder's message out, I gave a free condo paper.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
The boys are back in town.
Why you lose?
Ah, my God, I want you, Spore-Hole Boots.
I know everything that's going on in the news.
Why I even know all the new Marjan rules.
I've hit to the drive, got the old rules.
You better go and talk tonight.
It's a better show when I take your place.
I know I ain't no way of playing me.
But when they drop my boys, look, yay!
You little smoothies, the boys.
The boys.
The boys.
The boys.
The boys.
I've said that there's no limit to it.
We could have like 40 hours of it, you know?
Yeah, I thought I'd like to hear them all today.
I'll bet you would several times.
I wouldn't sound like you're eating anymore.
I must have finished it all up.
I did, finally.
So, I was good at playing Bits now,
because otherwise you might have another one
as the emergency runs, so to speak.
Well, what's your faxes here?
I understand that you must have just gone in there
and seen the pile, huh?
Yeah, I must have.
So, here they are.
Hector, which is a phony name, obviously, on this one.
Nio, you talked about people being fired during the holidays.
You are off phony.
You fired the bird during the holiday of time.
What a nice guy.
You are a question, Mark.
Who said I was a nice guy?
Well, in personal, it was business.
He was destroying the show, but nevertheless.
And he's dead anyway, so what differences does it make now, Hector?
What's your real name, Hector?
Vector?
Lector?
Schmendrick?
Pracy and Kendall says, I'd like to add no more Mo on the year for the 2006 subhole.
No more Mo, Mo.
You put it on there, however you like.
He says, I'd hope for impeached Bush, but that would mean that Dick Cheney would be in charge,
so I can't fathom that.
Well, he already is, Tracy.
Happy new year to you, Tracy.
Kendall, one of our regular factors.
Now this is kind of interesting because here's like a two-parter.
It says, is it possible to put the Marine Dowd off their article from yesterday on the storyboard
that what about Dick Rass, Futon, Cheney?
I'd love to send that to a few folks, and then a little bit later on, oops.
Never mind about the Marine Dowd.
Article found it on the list.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, that's good.
If you look on there, you'll see that we got the good crap on our website.
We need a lot more people reading those stories, or Josh is just going to say the hell with it.
Right?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, I mean, you know, we need a lot to, you know, they're going to...
I'm not saying that they can't find those stories.
If they want to do their homework and go to about 20 or 30 other websites, you can do it.
But we try to make it easy for you and convenient, and you pick and choose,
whichever one's sound interesting to you, or titillating, or fascinating, or whatever.
It's still some good time, too.
Matt and Volka, a long time listener, happy new year, Matt.
He says, my wish for 2006 is that you get a radio show on one of those uncensored satellite radio shows,
so you can make all the fart jokes and use all the obscenities you want.
Amen, Matt.
F&A.
I got serious satellite radio as a gift for Christmas because I'm Goiim.
Now, that's plural, unless you're two people, Matt.
I'm a Goi.
But we'll still be listening to you every day.
Well, thank the Lord for that.
Thank God.
Thank God.
Justice Sonora, I was driving down from Jacksonville the other day, and I could hear your broadcast.
Clear visibility.
Revard Indian River County line.
I don't have one of them.
Sooped up antennas either.
How do you like that?
All you people in Revard County, happy new year.
I think we've heard Indian River County line.
What's that like, Melbourne?
No.
Pomme?
Melbourne's way before Jacksonville.
Well, no, Jacksonville is Duval County.
Well, what's Indian River County?
You don't know your Florida geography, Mr.
and I thought you were in Jacksonville not that long ago, weren't you?
I was, and, no, but...
Well, that's Duval County.
I wasn't arguing that.
I thought he was saying,
I heard your broadcast.
Clear is a bell, as he was driving down from Jacksonville, at the Revard Indian River County line.
Ah, I see.
Well, what is that?
I know Revard County is Melbourne and Stewart, right?
What's Indian River County?
What's in that?
There's a little Google during one of these breaks when you're not stuffing your face.
And take a look at it.
I mean, not that it's all that important.
I just don't know my Florida.
I know where two egg is.
I've driven through two egg.
There's a stoplight there.
And I've driven through Temple Terrace.
And Lutz.
And all those wonderful places on the West Coast.
And Venice, Venice here.
Here's a facet from Murray Levine.
How's it going?
Murray, happy new year, baby.
I'm so excited.
Murray's still alive.
Here's one of the good guys in the business.
I think I'll do the break, then.
I'll finish these as a facet.
Here's one of them as fairly long.
Murray Levine.
Good man.
And of course, the good people in this business always get screwed over big time, baby.
They get screwed in tattooed.
That's in veerow.
That's like veerow beach, by the way.
Oh, in Fort Pierce.
Yeah.
Well, wow.
Hello to all you Yahoo's up there in Fort Pierce and veerow beach.
All you Yahoo red necks out.
Get your finger out of it and your nose too.
What I did is some kind of a place.
You ever been there?
Veerow?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, man.
That part of the state.
Well, most of the state when you come right down to it.
Yes.
Just don't cotton to that whole crowd.
They don't cotton to me.
And that's just fine.
Them cotton pickers.

In a desert not far far away, one soldier stood eyeballs above the rest.
Jar Jar.
They shot the captain.
Who's in charge now?
Lisa, Samson, Samson, Vince!
Lisa, Samson, Father, we're now.
Orton, A.
War is hell.
And so is the very voice of Jar Jar Head.
Lisa, shoot when Lisa says so.
Orton, A.
Lisa, Rosa, Rosa.
That does it! Shoot this large!
Oh!
Lisa, heard, Samson!
Jar Jar Head.
In theaters Friday, available for rent on Saturday.
How old?
From 1965 to 1960, so anyway, here's this really nice facts from Marie Levine.
And you're saying, who?
Well, he's happens to be a good guy.
Okay.
Take it where it's for.
He was. He was the salesman when I was at WINZ.
And he got screwed over once they sold at the Paxon.
And that Rano Fink Wolf and PD Bulls were in that crowd over there.
They screwed him over big time after the guy had a stroke.
Always get to a guy when he's down, you know?
Anyway, here's the fact that it says, I'm still alive.
They hit him with five shots and he's still alive.
My buddy Stu Smith told me that you and Hank were saying nice things about me the other day.
Yes, I was sales manager at WINZ under Stanley Cohen, a horrible boss.
And let me tell you right now, Marie.
Absolutely correct.
Oh, is he pathetic or what?
Why are you always smitting on the salespeople, Neil?
Why are you always smitting that right?
That was his number one line.
What a jerk.
But he did drive that big yellow severely, that pimple wheel.
Very classy, Stanley.
Anyway, Stanley J. Cohen, a loser.
I was worried from Margate in those days.
This is Marie.
During my tenure, I hired Rhonda Wolf, made a name think.
Oh, you see, God was punishing you for having that bitch, Marie.
I left the sellout, sellout, other station.
It was hired back a few years later by Rhonda, who rose to vice president of Paxon.
After my stroke, Rhonda Todd Winnick and Roger Croft decided I was not capable anymore and retired me.
Even though I could still do the job.
I'm still retired and I've been pretty healthy.
Thank goodness for that, Marie.
I missed the radio business and people like you and Hank, regards Marie.
Best of for the new year, Marie.
Happy Chinduka and stay healthy.
And stay out of the business.
He says he misses the business, but quite frankly, it puts people in the box very prematurely.
Trust me when I tell you.
Andy and Miami Beach says, which is really bogus.
This is sad.
But I'm going to read the whole facts.
It's very, very sad to me.
In fact, I just exchanged emails with Bob Lanciter.
Bob had opened up his blog a few days ago to take messages from people out there in radio land.
And I read them all.
And then several were people who listened to this show also and heard me and Bob on the phone whenever it was a couple weeks ago.
And they were, they were, they seemed to be mostly nice.
But it's just, oh, I don't know.
I'm with you, Blavo.
I agree with you.
Anyway, the fact says you complain about the Panthers games on KAT, but their signal is better than QM here in Miami Beach.
Well, maybe that's because the tower is on Miami Beach, Andy.
The only problem is that most people don't live on Miami Beach.
The tower is right over there.
I've released the used to be.
I don't know if it's still there.
I'm gay, a bay road.
Therefore, Matt is similar to WIWD.
Conservative talk in your buddy Art Riley is doing the news there in the morning.
I listen to Michael Savage on that station.
I don't agree with the word he says, but he shows entertaining like what they say about you with talk show host you love to hate.
Michael Savage on I've certifiable Nazi.
I regard Savage as nothing more than entertainers as Andy, a phony whose motivation is monetary within ideological, similar to Russian and Bob Dylan Riley.
Michael Moore, Matt Roger, etc.
Oh, yeah, throw Michael Moore in there for that, right?
I've also been listening to XM since I have a free subscription, and it's true that most of the callers to open Anthony are truckers.
You can tell that they're not used to having so few listeners in callers.
The run and fascia that follows is absolutely terrible, very difficult to listen to.
Absolutely.
Is there any chance you do your show from down here again?
No.
Let me say it again.
Absolutely.
No.
There's a new hotel here in South Beach called the Sittai.
It's ultra luxurious, blows away the rich, carton down the block.
If you did your show there, I guarantee you never want to leave.
You wouldn't even need a car.
Everything is in walking distance since Andy and I may be.
There are two chances that I will ever do any show from South Road again.
None and much, much, much, much, much, much, much less than none.
Zero, zip any due to, as in, oh, no chance.
Oh, there's more faxes?
There's a pilot in here to that.
This one here, I'm not going to waste my time with this.
Thanks for all you and your board of friends.
Good luck to you.
Okay, I hope you're low.
Hope you both get in a wicked car crash.
I wish you're evil on very few people, only two that I was thinking before, but I got two more.
Here's one that says Melbourne and Palm Bay and Titusville is a barvard.
We hear you loud and clear.
How do you like that?
A fact from somebody in Melbourne.
Melbourne Beach.
Mike in Melbourne.
Hey, soft one, eggs out.
Nice going, Mike.
Congratulations again.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
I'm going to get in there.
It's coming.
Oh my god.
Alan's right there.
Alan Cohen is behind the stage.
He's got a pay me off to go away.
So I don't say those terrible things about him and the Panthers and Gildey's broadcast.
Dave Straider is doing a really nice job if they just shut up in the spot fan.
I hate to keep dwelling on it.
Shut that frog up already.
We can put a sock on his mouth.
Sam Old Craft.
Anyway, here we go from the Indian River County, Viral Beach, Brevard County, Melbourne Palm Bay.
Coco, Titusville Kennedy Space Center.
Happy New Year from the Chronicin Cocoa, where QM comes in just fine.
Oh, we're fine.
I do like that.
The Chronicin Cocoa is one of the most chronic factors in it.
But what a good, good listen.
We should get a little cranky every now and then.
But if that's the one I'm thinking about.
Don't you love that from people I'd like to get cranky on the facts machine.
I'm thinking about that.
That's only a Hector.
Hector must be the one who used to call on IOD and go, did you say to the bird, hey, Hector, get back on your banana boat, okay?
And just kind of drift away with clearance carded.
There's a slip away.
Well, what happened to hell what?
5, 6, 7, or I'm tempted to take a couple of calls.
I must be losing my mind now.
All the facts has got me all whipped up into a frenzy.
See, I'm much rather, I think these facts are much more enjoyable.
Is that right?
You don't think so?
No, I gotta go call.
No, I don't call.
Because you can pick and choose.
You'll get a good one after every hundred.
What, the calls?
Yeah.
Well, yeah, of course it's the 99 bad ones that are really what adds the pizzazz, the spice, the salt and pepper to the whole deal.
That's what they like is a bunch of lunatics.
And that's what most people want to hear is people showing their ass on the radio.
Just look at your speaker and you'll see two big fat cheeks.
Right, that's our audience.
Somebody QAM, hello?
Yeah, sir.
Hey, you mentioned about a month ago that, especially on the New Orleans, I know people mentioned New Orleans earlier about the animals and stuff.
I watched part of it.
I couldn't watch any more of it.
Just put it down.
Just pathetic.
And also there was another thing about part of that about what happened there in New Orleans.
They had an engineer saying that they would have spent $2 billion in preventative maintenance and upgrade.
They wouldn't have to be spending $100 billion to rebuild that city.
It's really ridiculous or anything about it.
So short term greed costs this country, you know, billions of dollars.
You know, right in the middle of Hanukkah, we should really reflect if they would have just taken care of the levies things that would have been a hell of a lot better.
One more thing to be on your website.
Ed Naha, he is so funny.
I know you.
He is great.
I read many of his columns on here.
He is saying, plus his name is good.
It's just so funny.
That's our capacity.
Where he is great.
But the thing is that Thompson from Capitol Hill Blue, man.
He's my favorite.
There's just one more little thing.
The thing about impeachment is that the Democrats take over in 2006.
You get rid of Cheney Ambers, and then whoever is the police, would be the new president.
I mean, if we hit the impeachment board.
Get rid of the president.
I read that on one of the stories.
That's a great idea.
When does Thompson out?
And then we'll have a cry to hear for the last two years.
Okay. Maybe Greg Reed could be in the cabinet too.
I have a great speaker, pal.
I made it to Kitchen cabinet.
Be a good place to shove his ass.
Nice haircut, by the way.
Greg and our very fancy Brooks Brothers suit.
1227 at QAM.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 560 QAF.
Hey, chill.
Absolutely.
Some people don't.
They don't have a clue.
They walk around with their head off their roofs.
It's always the same.
They're just looking for fame.
And they're still the abuse.
Like the chronic thones.
All the chronic thones.
It's the first time the line.
It's because it's a classic dance fish.
With half of its mind.
And then we'll have a look at the whole thing.
We'll be waiting for you here.
Now just come on up with your green Corvette.
We, you and what army of Lil' Yahu is here?
We, all your friends from Carole Boy,
all your friends from Carpet Springs.
Why don't you stand up like on your own?
It's always we, we.
Like you've got all your buddies.
How come you don't like stand on your own thing, man?
We do stand on our own.
No, we, we're, is that we again, man?
Are you speaking French or English?
But you're being in a weed, we, we, I, we are, I, we are.
We are, there we go, we are.
You sound like Dan Klaillow, sir.
You can't even spell us.
You don't want to ask these kids on the radio.
Right.
And you know you don't have to.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You sound like Dan Baby now.
Are you in Lutcher?
Are you an Aintry, sir?
I think you've been up in Aintry, sir.
You want admittedly now, wait till tomorrow.
Some people don't.
They don't have a clue.
They won't go around with their head up their roots.
It's always the same.
They're just looking for fame.
And there's only abuse.
Like the chronic sound moves.
These are chronic sound moves.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
You can't even sing.
Do they get us bored?
They've got us out there.
Why don't you know why don't you know what Christians superpowers do?
Do they hollage of the fish?
I'm looking at a big truck.
Why don't you know why don't you know what Christians superpowers?
To the seven yeet and sit back down again in you
And watch it all down with the twelve-hundred-fruits
In the life of boredom of the heaven you go
I only smile upon the morning
What word did you say?
I love to know what to know what to know
I love to know what to know
I love to know what to know what to know
Some of those bits are much fun
I love to know what to know what to know
I love to know what to know what to know
I love to know what to know what to know
I love to know what to know
I love to know what to know
We're not getting married or anything
But I mean why do you keep saying I do?
You do know who that is?
Yeah, you learn a little like personally
Is he a boy or no?
I don't know, personally
I just know who that is
A.J. Nicholson has not been charged and is cooperating with Hollywood police
While investigation continues
He said Detective Carlos Negoron
Around three o'clock this morning a woman called a police
And reported Nicholson had just raped it at her
At the west of the Nipple that resort in Spawn Hollywood Beach
The only thing we have is an allegation
Nicholson came here and gave a statement
As to what happened, Negoron said the victim is also cooperating
She was taken to the sexual assault treatment center for Lauderdale for testing
Nicholson is the leading tachyra for FSU
Which is in town preparing for next week's orange bullet contest against state pen
FSU coach Bobby Bowden said he sent Nicholson home for an unspecified rule violation
He sent him home
Nicholson walked in voluntarily met with Hollywood detectives
Without having an attorney present as he answered questions, Negoron said
We talked to Mr. Nicholson and let him go
We have no problem causing this time to make an arrest
Investigators are still talking to witnesses and gathering evidence including DNA
Which is typically a lengthy process
Nicholson is a senior and a starter for FSU
Which went eight and a four while winning the Atlantic Coast Conference championship this season
And didn't they beat the hurricanes in the opening game in the season seems to me
Even though FSU is marginal at best, yeah they did
How do you like that? That's kind of embarrassing what seemed to me if I was a hurricane fan
And then of course they lost a Georgia Tech which is really direct, you know
And I'm telling you there's another fact you just sat
Oh I don't think I want to talk about that
Do you? No
Well they might be running spots on this thing
You know I understand that this is somebody's upset but it's like somebody that's in business
We don't care who it is even if there's a bigger strikers in the world
The new attitude of beesleases
If they're in business so we love them
We lucky lucky like we love McDonald's
We love don't even love Brandsmart
We love everybody
Right? Yeah
Oh yeah
If they're in business we love you, we love you, we love you
Just like Barbara Stuttley and the Jewish people
I love my love, my love, oh boy
When I write my book I'm gonna have a big chapter about that that whole stunt on WS News years ago
They were priming that bitch to run for Congress
She was gonna run for political office and she was just the whole routine was on the other
This right wing nasty, nasty, hateful, foamy bitch
Suck it up to the Jews with Israel this and the Jewish people
I love my love and then I started making fun of her
And Luke Krohn just about had a fart attack right in his orifice
Man, what a joke
The kind of crap that goes on
Just remember one thing on you kids out there
What you see is not what you get
What you hear is not what you get
Most of it 90% of it is BS
Okay, bull crap, BS is in Barbara Stuttley
That's she put the BS in BS
Of course nobody knows who that is no more
Well that's a long time ago baby
What would ever happen to her?
I wonder if she's still hanging out around Senator Hill from a high a Leah
Senator Hill?
Well I could tell you some real juicy stories baby
So could Jerry Williams if he was still alive but nevertheless
All those right wingers man
All those goody two shoes and fetus huggers
And they're holier than all the rest of us
Liberal perverts and young
And they're all the biggest bunch of phonies man
They're all doing everybody
They're doing like fire hydrants and trees
And little puppies anything that moves or is like can't get away
Wow
Tree stumps
Sure stumps the heart of me
Why some of these people ever put on the air
I love the Jewish people I love my love
And talk about phony and transparada
And all the old Jews they were crawling from her
Oh she's so wonderful, she loves Israel
Yeah
She puts your ass in the oven faster
And then you can say where's my early bird
Anyway we already got on the pole
Where's my teeth and my early bird
Well in fact that's a drop and I haven't played in a long time
There it is
I have no tamarice I have no teeth
Not that it was worth a big deal
What's your number one wish for the next for the new year 2006
And by the way happy new year to all
Even those people we hate like poison and who ate me like amorous
In Pete's George W. Bush 194
We're in the Lotto 82
Democrats with the election 63
They have lots of 6 63 all of our troops come home only 39
That should have a zero average and be 3090
Wouldn't you agree?
Yes
In fact I'll tell you what when all of our troops are home
Then you can have sex how's that?
And maybe they can too

Proph 46, if you and by the way don't ever send me effects from chronic Greg or Andy from Hollywood,

It's really sad and then one thing about this business is people like you despise, people who are extremely annoying, they just won't go away.
Go away, have a bad car crash, don't get her too bad or maybe the opposite.
In the 50s, Robert Young made people laugh and Father knows best.
Now, this great series is back, starring a few Catholic priests who like it young in the return of Father knows best.
Step into the confessional Billy.
I don't know, Father, this makes the 47th time I've been in there this week.
Oh, Billy, I want to be a good Catholic, don't you?
Yeah, but does everybody get a spanking?
Father knows best.
It's the Vatican's best kept secret and you've got a private see for all the fun.
Just enter the rectory from the rear.
Alright, Billy boy, it's time for your flute lesson.
But Father, your flute has only one role and it doesn't make any noise.
Oh, it will, Billy, it will!
Father knows best. Once you've seen this new sitcom, you'll wonder why you've never heard about it.
Let me introduce you to Saint Peter.
Father knows best.
Going to church may not seem very entertaining, but there really is something funny going on here.
Tired of the same boring old communion wafers at holiday mass?
Open wide and prepare to receive thy savior.
Oh, Jesus, Father, O Mali, wafers again!
Now, Billy, this isn't just any wafers.
It's not?
No, through the divine miracle of transubstantiation, I've turned this ordinary wafers into the divine blessed body of Christ.
Well, why does a body of Christ have to taste so yucky?
Spice up your next communion with new Christ Aroni.
Christ Aroni is a special blend of rice, spices and seasonings, plus a bit of the body of Christ in every fluffy forkful.
And Christ Aroni cooks up perfect every time, as he should.
Hmm, can I have some more Christ's Father?
That's Christ Aroni, Billy.
Amen to that!
Christ Aroni, the transubstantiation tree.
Hail God!
There he was just a walkin' on the sea sand.

He cared a lot for source.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, some say he's the son of God.
Yes, they do, but there's other people to give.
So I, now he's the reason that we have any today sing.
And do I, did it, did it, done, did it, do.
And he's the reason that all the Christians pray sing.
And do I, did it, did it, done, did it, do.
They praise him, praise him, heal down, heal down.
Praise him, and heal down the man who wore a thorny crown.

Jesus has had a big baby baby.
Jesus, you're in all that fire.
We're words on our sin.
The opposite is like to God in San Francisco, for goodness.
You, the passion of the mold.
Oh, Lord, easy with that whip.
Oh, Lord, that way you're more on.
I do well. I'll get you quite a white cow dragging this cross around.
I'll have a toned body at no time.
And then I'm gonna marvel at you.
Oh, Lord, when you're so angry about anyway, I'm throwing this for you.
Too big to do.
Oh, Lord, Lord.
Boy, this is some finish pie.
Hey, buddy, public side, this is something.
Yeah.
I'll just shut up and get you something to drink.
Okay, here.
What is that?
That's how I run a beer.
Get away from me.
I'd rather get wet.
Oh, boy.
That looks like a nice place to put a rubber.
Yeah, you got a nice view.
Lord, I'll get the hammer in the nails.
Who?
You guys know what you're doing.
Pulling them all?
Just put your hands out like this.
No, no, no.
Pulling them all.
Between the bones.
Between the bones.
Get it in the meat, boy, yeah.
Here, I got his feet with them again.
Like this.
Lord, Lord.

Now see here.
Ain't you got no stick matter?

You got a half stick matter.
You really got a father.
You got a father.
You really got a father.
You really got a father.
You really got a father.
All right, yeah, knuckleheads.
Now put me like a hanna caboo.
Yeah, yeah.
I said, do I care, though?
Well, you can see the back of the Chinese restaurant
in the Fasmayas deli.
When you arrive in the year.
Well, according to my weekly schedule,
I've got three days to judge more on his life.
You end there then in 2000 years or so.
From now on, I'm coming back again as an all-iterate retard.
We'll eat the free wolf.
I did.
Not a fourth anymore.
Step back and mutton heads them rising right now.
From the makers of the passion of the Christ comes.
Passion of the Christ on ice.
All the violence of the movie you loved,
but with a triple-axle crucifixion.
See, Collins of graceful Roman soldiers
whipping and weaving around a magnificent messiah.
New York Times reports,
these skaters really nailed this one.
And USA Today says,
jumping Jesus Christ on ice is cold-blooded fun.
Bring the kids to witness and savior each moment they cross.
The grace, the glory,
and the suffering of Christ on ice.
All the ice members make for it.
It's nausea, dizziness, death, or resurrection.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to go.
Take people out across the country.
Find out the female gift of Santa's land.
And as I'm on tour to Egypt,
they will tell us,
please, I keep them telling them,
all the fun they've sent.
And no business will want to do the trick.
Not one has to be changed.
No girls will win the league.
No big brothers or specials are fed.
But people born into their lonely sweats.
The breaking dark stops is records.
So I'll across the USA.
In Texas, no need for the hits and that is no implications.
No need for what I'm going.
Not one has to be changed.
No girls will win the league.
No big brothers or specials are fed.
But people born into their lonely sweats.
It's still moving.
Everyone is talking about the controversial story.
At the final days of Donald Trump,
at his 12th of a predecessor,
the passion of the Donald.
People, tonight somebody is going to betray you.
The passion of the Donald triumphantly chronicles the last forward maybe.
Olmerosa, you mean to tell me that you betrayed me for 30 pieces of silver.
You could have easily gotten three times that much.
Olmerosa, you're fired.
The passion of the Donald.
He may be whipped, but he's never defeated.
I've always fantasized about you whipping me.
But if you're going to work for me,
you will have to hit a lot harder than that.
Katrina, you're fired.
Don't miss the awe-inspiring conclusion out.
The passion of the Donald.
When one lesser of a premise finally nails down the job.
Bill Kwame, it's time to decide who goes up to the heavenly suite
and who goes down to the street.
But to find out, you'll have to endure something far more painful than crucifixion.
A two-hour life finale.
The passion of the Donald.
If you don't see it.
You're fired.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
This is Neil Rogers.
This is 5.62.8.

You're famous.

Six thousand dollars.
It's an awful lot of money.
What are you going to do about it?
You fairy.
Tell me what you got, Jason.
You're...
You're going to give me six thousand dollars.
You're going to give me six thousand dollars.
You're going to give me six thousand dollars.
All this spends an excitement you can expect from low-budget, dumb-down-televensions.
Like this viewer here.
That was funny.
Oh God, I want to die.
Become freshy jello in a chair with celebrity poker on ESPU.
The white house knows that truth is coming near.
So they'll make up some brand new terror scare.
It is wish-tru that maybe work alone on this smear.
Wonder why you're keeping all the more here and there.
Really, what you're stealing, cause I need to know.
Prosecutor, what kind of curb will you throw?
I need to know.
I need to know.
Tell me, have this girl come, I need to know.
I need to know.
Who's next to go?
This sounds worse than with Clinton at last just a fool.
And sometimes they see that we're lacking in the form.
They probably had my side, we'll be you by the throne.
You say, you say.
Is the one who gets now they have only one.
They say to them, don't worry about soon gone.
We got it, I'll be your puppy and say, you got it.
We know the tech is the most you got it.
Where is my king?
Mission 911 is what they got you to believe.
Can't get anybody but a home party called to believe.
You do this, what they say, like a girl, like a Christmas horse.
A fool has a human has a nation, a sterile state, so they're full with truth.
I'll be your legend, though, we got it.
Don't you see that it's a game with you got it?
Get down on your knees, you got it.
We know the clan deproves in the south.
We've died on deep brides, spotted out.
We love to flee the dirt and end the campaign.
We pray a lot in church, about who to next best merge.
And remember only you this half is free.
Just the hell is on attack, he hates the night sky, cuz it's black and all the Joneses are new poster days.
We saw the hell above, saw the seven hundred clubs, and I think that that you can't even watch his name.
We leave way right, and need a chance.
We find a portion of the planet, and then we leave like a door.
We're mostly white, and sperm retention.
Here's our big bag, a dead elf, cause we leave way right.
And we all look and rest the same, and hate the gaze, and she's the same, and fear the things that we don't understand.
Rectonics then was like us, while his face could stop the bus, so I think we all should give her a dick a hand.
And 96 will be in swing, and be for them like a Rodney King.
We'll dump the red and blue, just keep the white.
A black limbo, spread a string, just don't let death near your plate.
And hope there's no more books for him to write.
We leave way right, and need a chance.
We find a portion of the planet, and then we leave like a door.
We're mostly white, and sperm retention.
Here's our big bag, a dead elf, cause we leave way right.
We're starting out there, they say they'll keep up all their injuries.
Until they expose all the secrecy, till they're not hearing what they want to hear.
There's no one top while under open air, is it truly FBI?
I knew about the press, the CIA made judgments that they now regret.
Both the anti-terrorism policies, we just need more answers from the men who's keeping me to know.
We need to know what Bush knew of our 911 we need to know.
We need to know what we need to know.
Who got red foot, Bush knew of our 911 we need to know.
We need again, if we don't find a way,
From the Bush court till then left us all the way.
I'm starting out here.
We fall, bring to blinds to cold, and ones are to be.
There's a bomb struck from the stars from far away.
Maybe we should have paid attention, a little bit more,
To the facts we chose to ignore.
Surprise the gaffer's seek long, but I'm afraid there's a lot more fear than we want.
We need again, with our hope that by then, civil rights will be restored.
We need again, if we don't find a way,
From the Bush court till then left us all the way.

Back in the day when someone was wrong, we didn't take their crap.
In Pearl Harbor, when the jobs dropped their bonds, we found them bad, and now the Saudis made it aside, and on our cards our little flags weighed.
As that Saudi love and retard voice of bombers, the wrong way.
And our embarrassed to be in America, where they found logo like cheese, the United States of arrogance, and by bush and its fantasy, breathing at this country.

That iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.
The loss of civil rights is the rights that we're paying.

South of the Gopus family.
World of Nilelicians.

And I want to know, where are you living now?
Like, in Toronto, where are you?
Right now, this moment I'm in Toronto.
And my nice little apartment in Toronto with my nice beautiful studio
on the touch by other human hands.
When were you in Brussels?
I wasn't. I just made that up.
Oh, okay.
Because we were going to ask you if you've ever been to Bruges
because we've just been traveling in Europe this summer.
I've had a Bruges here, too.
And I was just in Amsterdam last week.
And I will ever go back.
It's just too much moody for me.
I just know more.
Okay.
All right.
Well, I just say happy New Year and tell you that we miss less

Live up in wonder who was going to win
Some found these people went to do their voting chore
So count up all the ballots and find out who's gotten more
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common
Looks like lots of them just keep their voice supressor
Patrick, you can't end it
Oh my God
Alright
