So, what's getting into talk show business?
Well, not him, who's that?
Clinton?
Really?
Bill Clinton?
I didn't hear that.
It's a story in New York Post today.
Yeah.
Says that according to Harry Thomason, he's been talking with Clear Channel about starting a new show.
Great.
And I guess it would go on after Rush.
Hmm.
That'd be interesting.
Yeah.
I sure hope he does a better number than Bill Orrime does in this market that big.
Oh!
That he got.
Clinton did it.
That's interesting.
He just had, he's made no impact on radio and software.
He doesn't even crack the, you know.
I didn't even know he was on here.
Yeah.
Well, there you go.
No, there's anybody else.
I guess.
But, how do you think Clinton would be as a talk master?
I don't know.
It's just, uh, who knows?
Yeah.
Every, remember, Mario Cuomo tried it.
Yeah.
Most politicians, I mean, he's, you know, he's fascinating for a little while, Clinton,
but I just, I don't know.
Personally, I don't, I don't listen to talk shows myself.
You know what, Clinton is a great interview.
Yeah.
Well, too bad we can't get somebody great to interview him.
The fact that, uh, that you're a great interview doesn't make you necessarily a great talk show guy.
Right.
But every time I've heard him interview, he's brilliant.
Yeah.
I like when he gets PO that's immediate.
That's my favorite.
Yeah.
I remember a couple of interviews he did.
I think with a British medium just, uh, went off the deep end.
It was great.
Yeah.
And then, deservedly so.
Especially when you see what we got now, what's going on in the world right now.
And this guy was put through the ringer over a couple of, uh, you know what's, you know, let's get serious.
We can't say that.
No, we certainly cannot.
We can't even say you know what's.
We can just say, that's it.
So I can't even say the name of the place where they had the US Open last year.
Really?
Yeah.
Shinnah Joyce.
Ooh.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I heard that place.
Yeah.
Both parts.
Well, I'm off for Louisville weekend in Louisville.
Yeah.
Some Phantom race that doesn't even exist.
You're not fooling us.
I'm going to be tuning in.
And I say I won't be because I'll be gambling this weekend.
I'll be an Niagara Falls.
Light in the afternoon.
I'll be at the Falls View Casino plunging my guts out all weekend.
So I won't be able to.
I'll be at Seasers in the end.
I might have to tune in just to make sure you're on the year that's not one of these Phantom races.
No, I'll be there.
Are a poll today you might have some interest in.
We got 200 votes out of already.
What's your favorite former gambling?
52 people don't gamble.
But again, that leaves 151 who do.
That's a great question.
What's your answer?
Well, somebody.
Oh, slots.
Used to be horses, as you know, but not even come out.
And try to close.
Right.
Not anymore.
See to me, the most boring, I mean, Thurberg racing to me is just coma inducing.
I mean, you sit there for a half hour between races and you just read that form over and over
and you change your mind 15 times.
And there's nothing going on.
There's no horses warming up.
There's nothing going on.
Well, now you have cymo casting.
You got to race going every second.
Yeah, that's true.
That's true.
So that's, that's piced it up.
In fact, I think that I told you earlier before the show.
I said, that's the only thing that's kept racing alive is the cymo casting.
You know what I like about the track is some, some it used to be.
And I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that you no longer wrote it.
And it's just a lot of guys you hung out with a track or no longer here.
They did.
Yep.
That's right.
Oh, well, sure going to the track, for example, not fat rich died.
So how often when I'm home to think I'm going to be going over to Pompooh Park?
I mean, I'll go once in a while.
Yeah, and then you went with Caller a lot to the right.
That's correct.
So that's part of what you notice.
That's what I thought was a truck.
With your buddies and it's like a day at the races.
That's all.
That's right.
The gambling is like a secondary thing.
That's why a lot of people play golf.
You know, if they go out there with a few guys and they, you know,
and they have to.
Yeah.
In fact, I know you and Moe probably.
Oh, yeah, we play a lot of golf together.
I'll bet.
Anyway, don't gamble 54.
Blackjack 37 slots 22.
Now the person who sent this suggestion for this poll and said,
show that judge courtess of thing or two and take a poll on, you know,
because Josh is very negative and slots.
He thinks it's only for like pansies and old ladies.
Gay.
And I keep trying to know seriously if he would go out.
Well, he just, he just got a close mind.
When I go out to Woodbuy, it's just astonishing how many young people
are out there are just all kinds of people.
Young and old and ethnic and you name it.
Gay.
Slot's 22, poker 19, sports betting 18, cracks 11, lotto, lotto re10.
That's a good bet.
Roulette 10, Russian roulette 9.
Russian roulette.
I'll tell you what, I wish I could pick the nine in my audience who are playing Russian roulette.
Yeah.
Kind of like fix the gun ahead of time.
I would like to send that game to the sales department.
There you go.
Please don't even start me with that.
Horses 9, cockfighting 4, a high life 3, dog racing 2, bridge 1, bingo none, and backer
at none.
How about sports betting 18, just behind poker.
But you see that.
So horses and I mean, and then of course you look highlight and dog racing.
I mean, way down.
I was telling George before about when I first came to town, highlight and dog racing were huge.
Remember when they used to have the mantis and the dog and both highlight and dog.
You know, Christmas night was enormous.
It Miami highlight is that they didn't run all year long, man.
And a biscuit and flag with it had the matinee they handle 7,800,000 in the afternoon.
And they handle over a million at night on a weekend.
And while then I weren't talking about that the other day.
I can't do it.
Can it's good?
Good.
Yeah.
But the days when he was out at the biscuit game was a great time.
It treated everybody great.
It was terrific to go.
I love the biscuit.
It was a fun.
It was a fan-friendly place.
Yep.
But I would be interested on the poker part of it to see how that broke down age-wise.
Because I just read a story in Sports Illustrated about how many young people are into poker right now.
Yeah.
And it's...
Well, even breaking down further like the people who played the songs of the video poker is huge now.
Yep.
I mean, people are watching poker on television.
And what about Texas Holden?
Is that like a...
What is that?
That's a form of poker.
Right.
It's a high-low game or it's...
And it...
Or you can play straight poker and...
What channel can I watch that on?
You can watch it on ESPN 2.
Oh, no thanks.
No thanks.
I was watching yesterday.
They had a great match.
Get out of here.
You were watching poker?
You know what?
You turned that on by accident and you get a hooked watch in it for a few minutes.
Because it is someone who's asking to watch the most people play.
Watching other people play cards to me is like watching other people play golf.
No chance.
You know what the ratings are?
I know it's good.
It just shows you where we are.
Reality programming and poker.
For Oprah.
Yep.
Say what is that to you?
The fact it's got ratings doesn't mean much to me.
But that's what the young people are doing.
To the rating for NASCAR.
All the people waiting for the big crack.
See now, that's a different culture altogether.
I know it's out there.
Oh, it's out there.
All right.
It's huge.
It's something that doesn't affect me one way or another.
But I know it's there.
It's there for me in the least.
Nope.
But it's giant.
I just never took enough BC powders to be in the NASCAR.
That's fun sitting there.
You might as well, to me, it's no different from getting a high rise over looking at 95.
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
You're going to see one.
All right.
I got a plane to catch.
Oh, great.
Well, listen.
Have a great time in New York with this bogus race.
What is it?
The Peter Stuyverson.
I'll say I'm not going to be in New York.
It's Louisville.
It's the Stephen Foster.
Well, the Stephen Foster.
Is he a Stephen Foster Hewitt?
Yep.
And my old Kentucky home.
I'll send you my expensive, you know, I'll pay my old Kentucky.
I know they do it before the Derby.
Oh, they do it before this race.
No.
Well, what about Stephen Foster?
Well, he wrote the song.
And I've been working on the railroad.
That's why he's got this for the song of the South.
That's why he got it named after him.
Well, I'll be damned.
And the race too.
Well, someday they can have the Neor Rogers and the Hank Olibur Memorial Race.
Hope not too soon.
There was a horse named Alan G. Finkelson.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah, I know.
Okay.
He's still running, by the way.
Well, listen, enough of this race track.
Catch your plane, have a great time in Louisville and see you Monday.
Don't lose too much.
I'll try not to also.
You hear Monday, right?
How big of a pardon?
You're still here Monday?
Absolutely not.
Are you out of your mind?
When do you leave?
Today is tomorrow's my, the beginning of the end.
Tomorrow's the, I got vacation and then when I come back,
I'll be here.
Oh, okay.
See you next Tuesday.
I'll be here.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Bye.
I owe you, you.
Let's grateful.
Free the old big shot.
Oh.
That's how we pass the time away.
In the gay old jail of hearts.
Oh, go, go, go.
The jury came back to the center down to the streets
and the ball fell down.
And the jury's sweet.
That's gonna never let him.
And the cheeks are on me.
I'm beating.
I'm beating.
My leg don't seem like the scurrying is gone.
All the gannado balls, so he shows.
I'm so happy.
I feel like the trophy's only time to beat him.
Now I'm free to be fair.
I'm beating.
Oh, wait a minute.
There we go again.
We got Hank on here again.
And the bed up is there.
We're recording a spot.
I beg your pardon?
No.
Oh, no.
I'm not.
Oh, there we go.

What's in here?
I'm in embryo.
Get your thumb out of there.
Get your thumb out of there.
What up here?
Let's reunite it.
What do you say?
No.
Oh, sorry.
You know what Geldie said about that?
You went too happy about the idea.
Stop Florida real estate investing somebody says here
and he's got to look at a little diagram pop
as in the bubble bursting and there goes your money.
Says coming to a bubble near you soon.
Well, just put real estate.
What's wrong with that?
Okay, real estate.
I think we ought to like narrow this down since we might
not get any calls on this today, which is fine.
Video poker, we should put that on there,
even though it like slaps over into poker and slots,
but video poker is enormously popular.
Texas hold them.
Which that's why I just think I don't even know what the leg is.
It's a form of poker.
Right.
So we should not put that on there.
No.
Very big now.
Huge.
Humongous.
We'll put it on there while you're at it.
Well, so in other words, video poker,
we don't want to put on either.
No, video poker on there.
I mean, I put, you're not talking about online, right?
You're talking about like the machines.
Okay.
I'll put it on.
Right.
I mean, it slots, but then again, it's also a flop.
But it's not.
Pacific thing.
Did we put online gaming?
No, yeah.
Yeah.
And that's because all those people are still busy trying to collect.
That was disturbing to me.
No, seriously.
I mean, you have no way of knowing how would you
play a play star?
It's one thing you're wondering by like, I don't know,
a pair of gloves or something or a hat online.
And I'm really hoping that this is really whatever it is,
or a book from amazon.com.
By the way, how's your movie coming, George?
Well, see that over.
No, north by northwest, it was backward in the game.
I know.
So it's sometime before the between, it said between now and
Stukas.
I'm sure before I die, which I think Stukas is not a tober.
I'm not really sure, but that's what they said.
Some, some day, I mean, I got his.
He didn't like it, unfortunately, but he got his.
At least he's like a micro, not the micro, but the flavor way.
Right.
Like that.
So one out of two ain't bad.
He's going to put it in the play watch.
It looks like he likes toss it.
This is something you can use forever and ever.
I like he pointed out the thing of it is, the minute you turn it on,
it's at the temperature, like it's, or nearly, it's 400 degrees.
And it's 400 degrees right away.
You don't have to preheat it and sit there and wait and wait,
or like with the oven.
You know, you have to put it on preheat and then you set the timer
for like 10 minutes and you go with it.
Is it, is it doing it yet or what?
You know, it makes your house all hot.
Yeah, that's right.
He eats up the kitchen.
Anyway, it's almost like doing a spot, but it's just such a good product.
And now you see why I was so enthusiastic.
Thank you.
Again.
You're welcome, Josh.
Thank you.
Bomb near Ramadi kills five US Marines.
This must be a mistake.
More dead people in here over there.
Five US Marines were killed by a bomb near Ramadi,
according to a US military source.
The Marines, assigned to the second Marine Division, were killed today.
Yesterday.
Yesterday when the roadside bomb director of vehicle during combat operation,
also a US sailor died of wound suffered any was hit by enemy small arms fire
during a combat operation in Ramadi.
So there is, let's see, six more.
The number of American troops killed since the Iraq war began.
Now it's 1700 and 13 and marching nicely on the way toward 1800.
And of course thousands and thousands, at least 12,000 injured.
And we don't really know the honest number.
And over 100,000 dead Iraqis.
But hey, things are going very well.
Freedom shot in March.
Fourth.
Yeah.

I was trying to call you yesterday.
You've been cast for the show on History Channel
Inside the Monk here.

It was on Monday or Tuesday.
Just keep driving.
It might be on again.

I guarantee Rodger Marist was a lot hotter than Periss all over,
you too hot anymore. It's 1032, a QAIM. Here's the facts from Adam. That's his umphrey.
Thanks Adam. You're okay. I told you that he would never let me down tonight. Very conscientious
guy. That's right. He sends me a fast, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep, but a beep,
but a beep, but a beep. Well, at least he was responsive, unlike some people who are
going into hiding now, hiding, cowering under the desk. Man, what a woose. Anyway, here's
the full question today. I guess I should have mentioned that, shouldn't I? Probably be
a good one. Okay. Slow me down a little bit. We just got today in the morning. I think
they're allowed to hear for while. It's all good. What's your favorite form of gambling?
We asked 348 votes so far. I don't gamble 78. I've heard it before the show is
where I say, see, they don't gamble. See, but of course what he hasn't realized is that
the overwhelming majority of the rest of the people have just divided up. No, I understand.
I voted for a poker. In other words, 260, 270 people do gamble and 78 are like boring.
Okay. I mean, you don't have to gamble your money. It's hard to earn it. A full of his
money are soon part of that. I've told you that many times, especially after a bad day
it would mind, but nevertheless, most of the people I know don't gamble. I mean, they
have, but they just don't. I'm trying to think. No, most of the people I know do gamble.
Not compulsively, but they go to Vegas. They go, you know, I'm not talking about compulsive
gambling. Like a game we have a QAM. I'm not talking about gambling at all. I'm not talking
about people at gambling. Like if there's two leaves falling from the tree, which one will
hit the ground first? That way. The red one. My uncle, the bookie, Mugsy Solomon. Anyway,
what's your favorite form of gambling? I don't gamble 78. Blackjack 54, poker 34, slot
32, 20 smart ass sports betting 27, the lottery 20. That's a great bed. Not craft 18,
talk fighting 16, horses 16, roulette 15, Russian roulette 12, high life for dog racing
for the stock market three, bridge two, video poker one. By the way, the Russian roulette
people will come to your home and they'll give you some help. Stock market one, back
to rat one, in real estate none, spades spades. Yeah, put that on later. What the hell is
that? That car game? Yeah. Spades. Are we going to put like my genre on here too? And
shuffleboard? Because spades. How about old me? That rhymes with spades. How about David
spades? Yeah, I'd like to get one with it. Spades, my ass, online gaming none and being
going on. They online gaming thing. I don't believe that. I don't know some of you. In fact,
they're probably that's why they're not on their website. They're busy plunging their
guts right now. Or maybe they're trying to get their money back. They're open to
browser at the same time. You know, my rooming that somebody just got a problem that
admits to us that sends us some facts. It says he loves the fun of gambling online. But
it can see that it always gives them an excuse why not to give him his money. What is that?
He said a crazy person. As a matter of fact, I'll give you a PO box. I haven't opened it yet,
but I'll go make one up and you can just send your money there, Frank. And I'll give you
an amusement you want. Wow. Now they keep banging away on this Rubo case. I mean, this
is just nauseating because this is the way the media operates as you well know. But here's
a story finally. It says was race a factor in the Rubo arrest. That isn't even a story that I was
looking for. Sorry, let me look through my pile. There was a story about why it is that they're
that that's not the story. You idiot. You you you simple and you you fair right. That's me.
Oh, here you go. Well, that ties right in with this. The last people to see Natalie Holloway
and the night she disappeared in a rubble were the white teenage son of the local judge and two
middle class young men of suranami's descent according to a local police within days of when
Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30th. But third man. A Rubin police arrested two
black security guards who worked at the hotel where she was staying. One question swirling around
the investigation was whether police initially targeted the security guards who released with
our charges eight day ladies as suspects, at least in part because of their race or class. Now,
most of the missing adults tracked by the FBI are men. More than one in five of those abducted
or kidnapped are black, but you might not get that impression from the news media. And some
journalism watchdogs are not taking the industry to task for what they see as a disproportionate
emphasis on cases in which white girls and women overwhelmingly upper middle class and attractive
disappear. Sean, do you believe anyone? Television executive run away bride and what he's like
low class and whatever. Television executives who receive much of the criticism defend their
coverage. They stress that such cases as the recent disappearance and a rubble of 18-year-old
Natalie Holloway of Alabama are extraordinary. It would be news whether newsworthy no matter
why why is that extraordinary what's extraordinary about it? She told you she was white hot pretty
right? Yeah, there you go from a white red place. Oh, that's extraordinary. It says indeed no
critic denies that the Holloway case other disappearances are wrenching for those involved,
but some insist that media attention on so few people overshadows the more than 100,000 active
files on missing adults and children currently tracked by the FBI IIII to be blunt blonde white
chicks who go missing get covered and poor black Hispanic or other people of color go missing
do not get covered. So Tom Rosensteel directed the Washington based project for excellence in
journalism. You're more likely to get coverage if you're attracted than if you're not.
Well, who wants to go out and look for ugly people? More likely to get laid if you're attracted
than. Who wants to go out and look for ugly people? No, they said during Maynard,
President of Roberts E. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, a group that works to improve
diversity in newsrooms and news coverage in terms of giving citizens the information they need.
I think we're failing because we're not giving an accurate portrayal of the world around them.
Absolutely correct. On its website, the National Center for Missing
Adults profiles more than 1,000 individuals including photos, physical descriptions,
short narratives of when they were last seen. Their young and old working class and professional
of all ethnic backgrounds, most are average looking. And most never even receive a mention in their
local newspapers or TV broadcasts said Aaron Bruno, a case manager at the center, who tries to
interest media outlets and publicizing missing adults. We want everybody to be good coverage,
but we don't get to make those choices said Bruno, who estimates that one of the five news
releases she sends out each week gets media attention. Of the nearly 47,600 academic
adult cases tracked by the FBI as of the beginning of May, 53% were men, 29% black,
about 12% of the U.S. population is black since this data show, about 62% of those missing
are white, but that figure includes Hispanics. Quoting those FBI statistics is by saying 99%
of the nations in the world are not at war, so why are you focusing on a war? But a rack is an
extraordinary event involving American said Mark Efron, VP of News at MSNBC. What makes news is
the unexpected. He said, Halloween's disappearance during a shaperone trip is unusual and will be
heavily covered by MSNBC regardless of gender or ethnicity. I hear a sound coming.
Christopher Robinson, a spokeswoman for CNN, they certainly not news network said that a wide
range of editorial considerations, including capotism from other news events, impact the attention
given to the potential story. The race or ethnicity of a possible victim she said is not a factor.
So in other words, the fact that all these people are dying in Iraq and all the American soldiers,
etc. All of this stuff is going on. The fact that we ought to have an impeachment against this
administration right now. And so that's why we heard about Rebecca Loha, Jennifer Wilbanks.
Right. Day after day after day after day, they run away bride. God almighty. I cried over the
coverage of the run away bride. I gave a good shri, I was so upset. But Rosenfield said that
analyses of cable news and recent years shows an upward trajectory of the salacious crime story,
including those missing white females such as Sean Relievie, Lacey Peterson,
Jean-Vanay Ramsey and Elizabeth Snottso Smart. Many consider women more sympathetic potential
victims than men and white women even more so. So Crystal Brent Zoupe, a professor at Columbia
University's journalism school who wrote an article published in this month's Essence magazine
about missing black women who are largely ignored. Who's appealing? Who's sexist? He has.
Who's your daddy? The original pure blonde princess is missing and has a lot to do with class
and sexuality and ageism, not just race. If some old lady, if some old bobbitchka is missing out there,
is anybody here about her? Huh? No. Do we have like big, big remotes from cemetery villagers?
Or would you win more? I don't think so.
Anybody know where Dave is? The Chappelle Show Season 3 DVD also features commentary from
Chappelle Showcast members like Charlie Murphy. This next clip is supposed to be like a new
Rick James sketch, but uh Dave never showed up. Plus interviews with the show's writers.
I was working on the best comedy on TV. Now I can't say my right. Thanks a lot Dave.
The Chappelle Show Season 3 DVD. Just like Dave Chappelle, you can't find it anywhere.
I've had you something else that belongs on our poll that I'm gambling and that's golf.
Oh yeah?
Enormous humongous amounts of money are gambled every single day on golf. That's why a lot of guys
play. It's just something to bet on, you know? Right. You want to bet? No.
The secret British member of 2002 that reported that El Presidente was determined to go to war
against Iraq months earlier than he publicly acknowledged will get his first official hearing today
sort of. In the closest version so far to a congressional hearing on the Downing Street memo,
representative John Connures of Michigan will head a former examining the document.
That'll be followed by an internet organized rally in front of the White House.
Connures plans to deliver these signatures of 105 congressional Democrats and more than a half
a million citizens on petitions demanding a detailed response from the Bush administration
of the memo's allegations. More than a half a million signatures they got. How do you like that?
You go John.
The memo minutes of a meeting that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had with AIDS on July 23rd,
2002 in London said it seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action.
Bush has long said he didn't decide to go to war until shortly before the bombing began.
In March 2003 the memo also says that the Bush White House fixed intelligence data to justify
the war. Bush's pre-war emphasis on the danger of Iraq's weapons and mass destruction
proved to be erroneous after inspectors failed to find any. The memo came to light on May 1
and Sunday times of London. So far in the US it's triggered more of a national side than a gas,
but news of its spread quickly on internet blogs. Connures said he's holding the hearing which
will be televised on C-SPAN 3 to uncover whether there was a secret decision well ahead of the
war. Connures said the memo suggests that even as the Bush administration is assuring
Congress they were secretly planning the war. And it's bad enough that the Bush administration
had so little international support for the Iraqi War that their coalition of the
willing meant the US Britain and the equivalent of a child's imaginary friends. It's even maybe
Captain Howdy was in there with us you think? Captain Howdy? Oh from the Exorcism. Are you eating
again? Yes I am. And it must be Avachev's Howys again. It's even worse that as the
Downey Street memo confirms they had so little evidence of real threats that they knew from the
start they were going to have to manufacture excuses to go to war. What's more damning still is
that they effectively began this war even before the Congressional vote. What John Howdy
is about to hold those hearings coverage of the Downey Street memo is finally beginning to leak
into the media. Can we say leak? It's finally beginning to be into the media. In contrast we've
heard almost nothing about the degree to which this administration began actively fighting the
war in Iraq. We'll advance a March 2003 official attack before both the October 2002 US Congressional
authorization and the November UN resolution recording that Saddam Hussein opened the country up
to inspectors. This is by Paul Rogat-Lobb, commons street or commons dreams.org. Got it? Well that's
what I got I was saying yesterday. We'll tell us where it's from commons streetadreams.org. He says
I follow Iraq pretty closely but was taken aback when Charlie Clements not headed the Unitarian Universal
of Service Committee described driving in a bagged head neighborhood six months before the war
and a building would just explode hit by a missile from 30,000 feet. What is that building Clements
would ask? Oh that's a telephone exchange. Later at a conference in Nevada's Nellis Air Force
base Clementsor to US General Boast that he began taking out assets that could help him resisting
an invasion at least six months before war was declared. Earlier this month Jeremy Schaehl wrote a
powerful piece on the nation's website describing a huge aerosolton September 2002. Approximately
a hundred US and British planes flew from Kuwait into a Iraqi airspace kehl rice. At least seven
types of aircraft were part of this massive operation including US F-15 strike eagles and royal
air force tornado ground attack planes. They dropped precision guided munitions on Saddam Hussein's
major Western air defense facility clearing the path for special forces helicopters that lay
and wait in Jordan. Earlier attacks have been carried out against the Iraqi command and control
centers, radar detection systems, revolutionary guard units, communication centers and mobile air
defense systems. The Pentagon's goal was clear, destroy your flexibility to resist. Why are we
talking about this? Is Kehl points out this was a month before the congressional vote and two
months before the UN resolution. Supposedly part of enforcing no fly zones, the bombings were actually
systematic assaults on Iraq's capacity to defend itself. The US had never declared war,
Bush had no authorization, not even a fig leaf. He was simply attacking another nation because
he decided to do so. This preemptive war preempted our own Congress as well as international law.
I don't think most Americans know these pre-war attacks ever happened aside from those of Red
Skahel's recent peace or heard him on democracy now. I recall no mainline media coverage at the time
and little in the even in the alternative press. The bombings that destroyed Iraq's air defenses were
under the radar for both the American media and the public. If coverage of the downing street memo
continues to increase, I suspect the administration will try to dismiss it as mere diplomatic talk
just inside baseball. But they weren't just manipulating intelligence so they could detect
no matter how Saddam Hussein responded. They weren't only bribing with the allies in the
participation. They were fighting a war they planned long before. They just didn't bother to
tell the American public. And again once again, right on to his got a stomach right on it. How do
you like that? I don't know. Who's this online too? Peyton and the S-Caller? QA and hello?
Hey, dude, it's going on man. I got the answer. Two from the hall. I'm going to write and black check.
Oh yeah, right. All right. I got one. I don't gamble. How's that? How about Birpakarat?
Yeah. What's your favorite former gambling? I don't gamble, my V9. Blackjack 65. Well, that's
removing a fast after he said it. Isn't it? Poker 43. Slots 38. Josh. I know they're all gay.
Sports betting 33. The lottery 27. Horses 22. We didn't separate Thurbrad from harness racing because
I don't know. Crash 19. Roulette 18. Cockfighting 17. Russian Roulette 13. Hopefully,
Prozac Ron is one of those people. The Gargling guy too. Gilbert. Gilbert, absolutely.
Russian Roulette 13. Stock market eight. High life five. Video poker four. And again,
I realized that some of the people voted or oh, well, we really meant well, whatever. It's not
rocket science. This poll will not go down in the emails of the human race. Just relax. Just for fun.
Dog racing four. Real estate three. Stock market two. Bridget two. Vakarat one. Spades.
Spades. What is spades? Come on. It's a great game. It's like hearts, not unlike pinnacle.
Yeah. And it's a card game. And we put in Tiddly Wings on here.
Right now. Monopoly. He's spelled out with T or D's. Spades don't have any votes. Online gaming
none and bingo none. Online gaming has none. That's good. I'm glad to see that. Yeah.
I'm glad to see that. Although I don't believe it because they're probably just to ashamed to admit
they probably think we're going to be tracing the votes because that's just I mean, there's like
87 million of these offshore online gaming deals and God only knows where the hell they are. And
if you're ever going to see your money, I mean, and addition to which I can't think of anything
possibly worse. Can you know one thing to be like addicted or just maybe not addicted, but like
plunge in a lot at the Vegas or at the local casino wherever it might be. It's another thing to
sit there right in the comfort of your own home. Right. Like I said, like those call and race track
good deals. And plunge in your guts out. I mean, morning noon and night. Can you rather say I'm
limited, huh? You imagine that that Mahoney guy had had the internet back then. Oh, yeah.
They would have had the internet back in the early 80s, which they didn't. He would have turned
into Howard Hughes. There he is right out there. How's it going there? Mahoney Toronto guy who got
himself all straight. No, that's good. And who was that mini driver played the wife? Yeah, I believe
so. Right. Many good. She was adequate. I wouldn't say she was great. I mean, she was very
a huge part. She was certainly very, what's the word I'm looking for? Yes. No, but beside that,
that's a given with her. She was very considerate, very, oh, yeah, like understanding, very
understanding, very flexible and very stupid, I guess. Well, maybe desperate. That's a WQAM.
Hello. How many drivers played the wife? QAM. Hey Neil, how you doing? Pretty good, Pally.
I know you don't like golf, but a lot of businessmen we gather up Saturday and Sunday and we bet heavily
on the golf course. Right. In fact, I think we put it on her yet. I told Josh that, but he's like
Adam and he want to put yeah, golf is going to be big. Yeah, you know, you got him. How much would
you, how much would your plunge like on an average match? Well, you got, you got a bunch of matches
going and you can lose anywhere between three four, five hundred up to a thousand. Excellent.
So it's good, you know, I'm a business man. That's my only vice. Well, nothing wrong with that.
Torn to your gut, Pally. Have a good summer, Neil. And you too. There you go. See there's golf,
which I'm glad he called reminded because I thought well, we just put that on here, but Josh,
for some reason, he put his fades on his stud. Yeah, he puts fades on there instead of golf. Uh-huh.
I had listened, put on whatever you want on there. Man, do you think it really makes any difference
to me at this stage of the game at this point in my life? By the way, we really missed you this
morning, Duff. Not. No. I mean, we missed a little pad on the head. How we're going to do the show
all the way till two o'clock? Attention, man. You're fairy. WNQ AM. Hello. Good morning, Neil. How are you?
Pretty good. Um, little tip that of information here. I was watching the news this morning,
scrolling across the bottom. Not a little tip. It's a news. I saw that the had bought the rights to
the runaway bride for a movie. Now, yeah, that's, I got that in my hand right now in the story too.
Unbelievable. That's anything on the screen. That must make you want to gag and tuff your guss out.
And that actually is one of my favorite bits you have. That's coming up right back.
It's coming up very soon. Have a beautiful day. Now, you two, Pellet. How do you like that? Yeah,
runaway bride inks deal with firm preaching movie. We'll do that after the break. That is so disgusting.
And so she had her 15 seconds of fame, but now she can really exploit it for being a real
slump. That cost everybody all that money and had everybody crazy. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, man, oh, man.
I'm talking. I think I think America has gone nuts led by the irresponsible grave robbing media.
I think America has gone over the, they've gone off the end. They've just lost it collectively. The
country's gone like that. Don't you? Oh, yeah. It's like a country could speak collectively.
America would say that would be the American thing right now. The American nation anthem.
Instead of the star-spangled banner, they should just be doing. That would be good too.

Hello, my friends. It's you. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello.
You're the first. What the hell's the matter, honey?
Are you crying? You sound like you're crying. I'm thinking that by aliens.
You've been kidnapped again? By aliens. You've been kidnapped by aliens. Where they done took you?
Albuquerque. Albuquerque. Is that in America? Where is it? In New Mexico.
In New Mexico. Albuquerque is. Yes. I was in Georgia. No, no, no, no, Mexico.
Okay. I don't believe you. You don't have to lie to me. No, I want to get married.
I really do it just that I was kidnapped by aliens. I don't believe you, honey. They got short hair.
They got short hair. Who does? The aliens. I've short hair. You say short hair. You mean like,
right? I'd see, crash short. A little longer than that. A little longer like Fabio.
I don't need to get a lesson. I believe you. Where are you? Can I pick you up? I'm at a 7-11.
7-11? Yes. Can you give me a slurpee? What? Slurpee. What? Slurpee. What? Like a blue
bird. I just think kidnapped. I think it's your slurpee. All right, I'll get it myself.
You really been kidnapped, honey. I spy aliens in a blue van. Aliens drop a blue van.
Like a Chevy van? No. Did a Ford? No. What kind of van is that?
Is it God of the Man? Is it the only thing to eat? Is it probes? No.
Focues? No. Proud? No. Like love to eat? No, you idiot. I'm not coming. I want to stay at the 7-11.
You don't want to murder me, do you? No. What? No, I told you. But I forgive you. I don't care. You can come home.
I'm not. Come home. I'm done with this. I'm the sheet. Bye-bye. The little girl is taking a blue.
The little girl is taking a blue. The little girl is taking a blue.
Anyway, if you're right, Killer, was there slurped out of the courtroom on a structure? Do you see that? No, I didn't.
I hope it helped him, Mr. Cippy. If you're right, Killer, what does he 91? Something like that?
Anyway, he looked okay to me. He just sat in up and slurped him out of there on a structure.
Looks to me like you're just postponing the inevitable.
Hoping that maybe he'll just cope first before they find the convicted.
The next year, Red Nackia, a clean ass.
Runaway, Brian, Anx, deal with firm pitching movie. This is so disgusting.
And it says, officials who search for her are not amused.
Runaway, Brian, Jennifer Wilbanks made a deal with a company that's pitching a movie about her life to networks,
annoying the officials who spent thousands of dollars in countless hours searching for her ugly ass.
Searching for her ugly BDI ass. Reagan Media, a New York that's Reagan Media, a New York
multimedia company told the Atlanta Journal Constitution for a story today's newspapers.
It's acquired all media rights to the life stories of Wilbanks and her fiance, John Mason.
The company didn't say whether any money had changed hands.
I'm looking forward to developing the scripted project with Wilbanks and Mason,
company president Judith Reagan said this statement.
There is an unexpected and compelling story of love and forgiveness that has certainly taught
me a thing or two. Yeah.
Is in How to Make a Quick Buck.
The 32-year-old bride to be disappeared from her home and
had run a summer rubble in April 26th, four days before her wedding in a ceremony with 620
attendance for scheduled, she took a bus to Vegas, then to Albuquerque,
Jerky, New Mexico, and claimed she was abducted and sexually assaulted.
She later recanted saying she fled because of unspecified personal issues.
In other words, like that.
Wilbanks pleaded no contest earlier this month by making a false statement,
and was sentenced to two years of probation in 120 hours of community service,
she was also ordered to continue mental health treatment and pay the sheriff's
office $2,550. The loophs spent nearly 43 grand a search for her.
She has repaid so far $13,249.
It's disturbing to me on a personal basis that she's willing to profit from this,
but there's nothing I can do about it legally, said Winnet County DA Danny Porter,
who preserves charges, pursues charges against that bitch.
How do you like that? I asked her not to make you lose confidence in faith in life.
That's enough to make you never want to read the freaking news again, right?
The American freaking way.
It's the American Joyce and Wayman. It's disgusting and nauseating.
You go out and you do some disgusting, unacceptable, aberrant kind of crap.
You get everybody whipped up at a war frenzy.
You exploit the media for fun and whatever, and then you profit from it.
Just like these jurors in a Michael Jackson trial, oh brother,
oh we want to, yeah, that note, I wish I had saved that story,
so I could read the wording exactly again.
They pass a note saying we want to be your left alone,
and we hope you'll respect our privacy.
We did the best we could, and we did our duty in the Yadda.
And then all of a sudden an hour later, we see this room with all these chairs in it.
Here they come, all of them.
All of them, not a single one of them said,
well, you know, I really mean I want to be left alone.
I don't want any publicity. I want to be anonymous.
No, I mean, what could be more anonymous than putting your face right out there on World Wide TV,
huh? That's pretty freaking anonymous, right?
And then all of a sudden we hear about, well, we already knew the 79 year old broad.
She's going to, she's writing the book.
And then all of a sudden we find your number one.
He's on there. He's on my TV more than, uh, than, uh, I'm old.
He's on there more than Jerry Springer.
All over the place. He's like, uh, what, what did it color when something like gets burned,
it burned in your TV tube?
Remember that?
Oh, right. It's still happens.
Like the test pattern, you used to, when the old sets back before you were born,
the test pattern would get burned in, if you kept your set on a long time.
Get burned in your TV tube and was like always there in the back.
And that's, that's what he was like the last two, three days.
You're a number one.
The one that says, oh, well, I'm pretty sure he wants to do the little boys,
but they didn't prove this one.
And he's another one that wanted to be anonymous.
And they're just all over the place.
And of course you know, and now they're saying, well,
you know, some of these people might write some books and maybe a mini series and maybe a movie
in a screenplay and et cetera and so on.
Just, oh, man, makes you just weak.
That's why I keep telling you folks.
Just enjoy your lives, okay?
Go to the track, go to the casino, plunge your guts up,
go on vacation, go to any of those cities we had on there.
Yesterday, go to Genevieve, New York,
go to a catarlogist's server, go somewhere, just have a good life.
That's all because if you get, you know, it's like all the Sirac stuff.
Nobody cares.
I said, who are we these days?
The Downing Street Mellow, well, at least a half a million people cared
enough to sign a John Connus petition anyway.
That's good.
I scroll in John.
There's a guy who cares.
Remember him in Fahrenheit 9-11 when he said,
yep, sit down there son.
They come as a surprise to you.
We don't read any of these bills.
And of course they couldn't read the bills because the bills are all in a big book.
It's about 7,000 pages long in a big fat book.
Meanwhile, Clarence Token Thomas, he's sitting there with a big fat one.
What?
I can't say.
Okay.
Speaking of disturbing stories that just never end,
hopefully this will be the end, but I'm sure it won't.
It just will never end.
Yesterday, we had a breathless autopsy.
Hopefully, we thought the last chapter of Terry and her.
She thought that was it, but guess what?
No, no, no, no.
Nothing's ever going to pacify these people.
She could still, you know, get better.
They've got a long list of grievances, the Shimbals.
You know what it's called?
What?
They have their life?
The Shimbals.
Yeah.
It's called Shimbals List?
No, Apollo Cran.
Oh.
That's what I'm telling you.
That's what it's called.
Or to be more specific, it's called Samman's Hack of Laya.
That's what it's called.
I didn't have that cute up.
Anyway, an autopsy found that Terry Shavo suffered from severe and irreversible brain damage,
but it's done nothing this way.
Her parents position that she deserved to live and may have gotten better with therapy.
I mean, oh, let us draw you a diaphragm, folks.
The long awaited report yesterday found Shavo's brain had shrunk about half the normal size
for woman who raised when she died March 31 after her feeding.
Cute, with disconnected.
The autopsy also determined that she was blind.
Bob and Mary Shindra distributed the results,
insisting their daughter interacted with them and tried to speak.
The attorney said the family plans to discuss the autopsy with other medical experts
and wait till you hear this and may take some unspecified legal action.
Oh my God.
We knew all along that Terry was profoundly brain-damaged.
His Shavo's brother, Bobby Shindra,
we simply wanted to bring her home and care for her.
It all goes back to this quality of life.
Quality of life?
Well, she didn't have any, but don't confuse them with that.
To find these vindicated Shavo's husband in his long and vitriolic battle with his in-laws
that engulfed the courts, Congress and the White House,
and then divided the country, Michael Shavo and court appointed doctors.
She had no hope of recovery.
She died at age 41.
The autopsy also found no evidence that Terry Shavo was strangled or otherwise abused
before sudden 1990 collapse, countering allegations by the Shindras
that she was abused by her husband.
He had medical examiners couldn't say for certain what caused her collapse
long thought to have been brought on by an evening disorder.
George Filo said, attorney for Michael Shavo said the findings back up
their contensions made for years and years that Terry Shavo had no hope of recovery.
He said, Michael Shavo plans to release autopsy photos of her shrunken brain.
Mr. Shavo has received so much criticism throughout this case.
I'm certain there's a part in that was pleased to hear those results
and the hard signs behind them, Filo said.
The Shamblers fought their son-in-law in court over their daughters
for nearly seven years battling to the end with conservative,
lunatic right-wing maniacs at their side, including some clansmen and people like that.
The autopsy counters a widely seen videotape
the Shamblers released of Shavo in her hospice bed.
The video showed Shavo appearing to turn toward her mother's voice and smile.
She moaned and laughed.
Her head moved up and down and she seemed to follow the progress of a brightly colored
Mickey Mouse balloon.
Shavo's parents said that she showed she was aware of her surroundings,
but doctors said her reactions were automatic responses and not evident of thought or consciousness.
In fact, the one moment, the one time when I might have agreed was when she looked up at the
Mickey Mouse balloon and said, oh, I swear.
And that was it, so she said.
There is nothing in this conscious.
There is nothing in her autopsy report that's inconsistent with a persistent
vegetative state speaking of the brainstem.
Said Dr. Stephen J. Nelson, a medical examiner,
who assisted in the neurological portion of the autopsy.
The cause of death was dehydration from removal of the feeding.
You, but the underlying reason for brain damage was official.
This is undetermined.
The autopsy included 274 external internal body images and exhaustive review.
A Shavo's medical records police reports and social services agency records,
but the family says, uh-uh.
That's all just a pack of life.
Right.
She'd have been just fine.
We took her home and just tied her up there in a corner.
She'd have been fine as DIY, right?
You bet.
Take it for a walk.

We got some great news from Iraq.
We'll do it.
We'll do it.
We don't have to, we got Al Zakarwi, Al.
We got Al Yat.
We got the Mule Bula Omar, Osama Yama,
any of these people.
But we do have Abu Taha.
A guy.
The US military today reported the capture of Amanda
described as El-Kad is leader in the Northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
Air Force Brigadier General Donald Austin,
no relation to former Dodgers manager Walter Austin, identified him as Abu Taha,
whose actual name is Mohammed Kalaf-Shakar,
and said it was captured on Tuesday.
Abu Taha had?
Abu Taha had?
He's their Kinder-Ravi Shankar.
Taha has been one of Abu Mussab al-Zakarwi's most trusted operations agents in Iraq.
Austin said this is a major defeat for the El-Kad organization in Iraq.
No more reports indicate any where he's suicide vest 24 hours a day,
and stated that he would never surrender.
Instead, he gave up without a fight.
You're fair.
I don't like that, huh?
I'll talk, no action.
Bapapapapapapapa, then when first game to show up, you're fair.
Waste out.
Okay.
No problem.
No shoot.

Spades has got the two and golf has got none.
Oh, spades are flying.
You'll see.
You're crazy.
It's big.
Everybody's like this.
Yeah.
Uh, golf doesn't have any for two reasons.
Number one, people who would be betting on it are out there playing it and betting on it right now.
And number two, the golfing, I have alienated the golfing community over the years,
and I'm very glad about it.
I'm proud of it.
Aren't you?
Oh yeah.
I just, I mean, to me, it's just such an enormous waste of time.
Number one, and number two, of course, watching other people play golf.
That means just absolutely.
Oh, 515 votes on the poll.

I don't get it.
I don't know.
I'm, I'm, I'm ecstatic.
I feel a lot better about life in general for you.
But I'm just amazed that there is a one person
this audience has gotten sucked in,
especially with all the internet's kind of people we got.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Hey, Neil.
Hey, Jordan.
Yo, yo.
Hey, do you remember a, a, a plane dice in the bathroom?
Do I remember what?
A plane dice in the bathroom?
A plane dice in the bathroom.
Just this morning.
Yeah.
How about in the, a, in the family room?
There you go.
Okay, good luck to you, Palli.
He's, please find something in the bathroom.
I don't think I should do with the, uh, it's crap.
Yep.
Pitch the, uh, that's what he's plan.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Yeah, I'm a fucking billion man.
That was the segway to the last crawler.
That is, everybody's, but I always would.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Hey, Neil, how you doing?
Okay, sir.
Good, listen, the help Josh out,
they think I'd go to two far because mostly plays like guys in jail or in prison.
Really?
We're big and poor.
Everyone that I've ever known.
That's not in jail or case audience would be a tune in.
And then we have, we have, have any votes already?
Yeah, but around the biggest, um, the one thing I like to gamble about,
I don't know if you can figure out poker now,
but I call the other card game.
You know, three cards is care being said, you know, the go for it.
I mean, I spent the week out there and I think it those part tables.
I mean, I guess there are sort of, uh, sort of kind of poker,
but they aren't really poker, you know, because they got their own tables too, you know?
Yeah.
That's what I like to do.
I mean, I mean, the conesters, that was it.
I just saw that might be something different than poker, you know.
Yeah, we got to lump it all in together otherwise we'll have like 75 different forms of poker.
Okay, we'd like to, I have no idea what he said.
You'd ever put it in?
I didn't understand what he said.
I told Dr. Chipotle that Texas hold him on there.
He did not.
Probably a good idea.
Don't put it on there.
I know.
Oh, there's a hundred to one different poker's.
Yeah, right.
Poker is poker.
Okay, we don't give a crap.
You know what that would be like?
That would be like saying slots that you'd like wheel of four to you.
Like claiming sevens like a...
Right.
Well, you know, which one you want to play?
I stay away from those flaming sevens like the flaming eights.
No, that isn't interesting thing and I realize it's very boring to people who don't play
the slots.
But what, you know, I mean, what is it that attracts people to different, you know, to different
things because I noticed that the same people always play the same games, including me.
I only play wheel of four to once in a while.
I'll play that mega bucks.
You know, where they have the multi-million dollar jackpots, which is a sucker bet, I guess.
A couple of times I've done pretty good on it.
One, one, a few bucks, not mega bucks, but a few bucks.
But you see what I'm saying?
What is it that attracts people to like certain games in a casino?
The look of it, the colors.
Right.
I mean, that's a lot of them.
Yeah, the sound.
Wheel.
Oh, torture, that kind of sound, that mesmerizing sound.
And of course, and if you're smart, as soon as that music starts, you slam the button and
make sure it stops right away.
You know the music I'm talking about?
Right.
The Wheel of Four to music.
You heard that.
Yeah, right.
You just slam that button and just shut it off right away.
I don't want to hear that.
You maniacs.
Dominique, you way in.
Hello.
Close eye sound movie.
I guess that you're on the pole.
Okay, three times.
Pull out trigger.
Seven times just to be safe.
Dominique, you way in.
Not there on one.
That one needs some serious health.
Dominique, you way in.
Hello.
Hey, Oknail.
So I'll tell you what.
What about the game, Yooker?
You know this?
Yooker.
Yooker.
Yooker is a very cool game.
Yeah.
What is Yooker?
It's like a bobby yooker.
It's like space, but using all the suits.
How do you spell it?
E-U-C-R-E.
It's like a midwestern game.
A lot of other people.
A lot of other people.
People down here know about it.
Oh yeah, Yooker.
Okay.
Thanks a lot, pal.
My pleasure.
People who play it are called...
Let's see Yooker on there right away.
What do you say?
People who play it are called Yookerists.
Are they really?
No.
I thought they were called crazy volugenists.
Anyway, a blackjack is winning.
I mean, I don't gamble as winning, but that's like, you know, that's just a cop out of you.
Don't gamble.
Okay, we don't care.
We're not trying to like talk you into it.
Although that online gaming stuff is really a good way to lose your ass.
Still has no votes.
Golf has none.
An online gaming you've gotten on.
You believe that.
In this vast audience of ours, I realize it's the dog days of the summer.
And most of our people with a half of brain are $10 or out of town.
But nevertheless, golf and online gambling have got the big none.
Maybe we got it like...
I'll give out some websites where people can lose all their money today.
All these golf things are like 40 billion.
We've got the biggest personnel in the world.

out there losing their ass and blaming me.
Oh, did you give that website up?
We lost our ass or we won a lot of money

What's that all about?
WDQYM, hello.
Yes, sir. How you doing?
Yeah, I just heard you all talking earlier about the plot.
I was in Vegas every year.
I just got back about a week ago.
And I'll tell you something.
After that wheel, it made some big hit.
We went like three or four over the scene.
And I just can't believe they got the prices right now out there.
They got to make it.
Let's make a deal, Jeffrey.
And now they're also getting through all the old comic TV shows.
I dream a genie.
You couldn't get on that machine.
I mean, I'm nickel-flot.
I dream a genie.
People don't think I'm a nickel-flot, right?
But they're expensive.
And people like...
You can't afford a real phone.
You must have lost your ass in Vegas.
Come back at a real phone, because I'm really anxious to hear what you have to say.
Well, he had a bad phone.
OK, he lost his ass out there.
You know how that goes.
He's probably got two tomato soup cans, two Campbell soup cans,
and a tin wire storm.
He doesn't like to play the floss.
What?
He doesn't like to play the floss.
That's not what he was saying.
He was knocking a lot of these stupid ass games.
That's what he was saying.
How do you know?
See, you're just like putting words in his mouth.
You know, he was.
I couldn't tell what that good phone was.
You could hear it, but...
Right.
That's true.
They got a slot machines now after every damn show.
Of course, that's their challenge.
They keep coming up with new and more interesting things to get people hooked on that stuff.
That's what it's all about.
And then you go in there and you pick your poison.
And like I said, I see the same people playing the flaming.
Sevens the same...
Play-mourning.
Sevens the same group of us who play Wheel of Fortune.
I mean, we got like a little fraternity there.
It's... I see this...
You'd be amazed.
And some of these people who I know lose their ass on a very regular basis.
And I wondered myself, how can a schlepper like that be showing up here all the time?
And they're probably thinking the same about me, you know?
Yeah. Maybe it's smart.
Maybe it's smart.
Maybe it's smart like him be coming here all the time.
Maybe that's why there's schleppers.
Oh, Mr. Pension was here the other day.
Oh yeah?
The other person's got a new horror story.
I said, well, good. I just don't want to hear about it.
Okay, the guy that shows up doesn't gamble anymore.
Everybody might be once in a while, you know? He pretends he doesn't.
But he doesn't. He just hangs around and gives people advice and sits next to him.
And he just holds teats for people, you know?
Do you want to go take a leak and he's there?
He's always a good... He just saved my seat. He's a sea-warmer.

Exactly. Wouldn't you be like nervous about collecting if you ever won anything?
I actually on the sports betting I did win a little bit and they did pay. It didn't pay.
It took them like two weeks to send me a
uh, like wire test for check, but it didn't pay. But the uh, on the poker, you lose one
equitably and and you better get out. Hey man. Good good move pal. Thanks. All right.
He removed the program right away. That was an excellent move. Okay. Don't take a chance. Okay.
Don't take no chance with that money. Come out of your pants. Believe you me.
Just uh, when in doubt, don't check that out. Stay on the... In fact, you know something I just heard
the business. That's the thing is online gaming. That's right. Never heard of it. There is no such thing.
In fact, I don't think there's any such thing as the internet. I think Al Gore just made it up.

That's right. They're on the way to the West Coast.
They're on the way to the West Coast. They're on the way to the LA Angels of Anaheim of Orange County.
Oh, what is that all about? I mean, talk about stupid.
Couldn't be, you know, Anaheim Angels, that wasn't good enough. And then the LA Angels,
that wasn't good enough. So now it's the LA Angels of Anaheim. Oh, LAA. Give me a break,
as opposed to LAD, eh? Do not, whatever you do, go to online slots, do not do a search on that,
do not look at it, do not, you know, Eric warned me a long time ago about websites. Yeah.
And he's right. He's got an excellent point. You can look at a website and it can look like the
most really beautiful, very legitimate authentic, you know what I'm saying? And it means nothing.
Anybody can do that. Any con artist, any favorite child can put together really fancy,
fancy authentic looking, authoritative looking the website. It means nothing. So just because it
looks really, very, very complicated and authentic and fancy and colorful, that doesn't mean that
you're going to get paid. That isn't some shy locks sitting behind the computer somewhere, right?
So don't go look at it that because my goodness, there's just 80 zinni in the nose on there.
So thank goodness we've only got two people so far in this audience. Let's say two,
the same people who play spades, who gamble on spades, gamble online and backerat and the bridge,
Miss Crub, bridge and my Zhang and Kanasta and Jin, Jin Romney. Or maybe they're just like this as
well as maybe they're just rinking the gin. The interrogation techniques used at Guantanamo Bay
to 10th and centimony 2000 two triggered concerns among senior Pentagon officials that they could
face criminal prosecution on a US anti-torture laws. ABC News has learned notes from a series of
meetings in the Pentagon early 2003 obtained by ABC News show that Albertta Moore, a general
council of the Navy, warned us appears that they might be breaking the law. Oh my god.
During a January 2003 meeting involving top Pentagon lawyer William Haines and other officials,
the memo shows that more are warned that use of coercive techniques has military, legal and
political implication has international implication and exposes us to liability and criminal prosecution.
Oh my god. More as deep concerns about interrogations that get more of the known but is not
his warning that top officials could go to prison. You're going down. In another meeting held
March 8 2003 the group of top Pentagon lawyers concluded according to the memo we need a presidential
letter approving the use of the controversial interrogation to cover those whom of us who may be
called upon to use them. No such letter was ever issued. Yesterday the White House insisted the
tactics used to get more are now and have been legal. All interrogation techniques that have
been approved are lawful and consistent with our obligation said White House press secretary
Scott McClellan who's famous of course for always pedaling out to the media. A pack of life.
In another internal memo obtained by ABC News a Navy psychologist observing the interrogation
warned that the tactics used against Mohammed Al-Katani dubbed the 20th hijacker reveal the tendency
to become increasingly more aggressive without having a definite boundary. Secretary
Al-Katani had produced results. Katani and other detainees have provided valuable information
including insights into al-Qaeda planning for 9-11 including recruiting and logistics
he said during a phoning news conference. Human rights lawyers say Moira was right to raise
objections to what disappears were doing. It is clear that individuals who engage in abusive
treatment of this nature may be criminally liable for the conduct they engage in said Deborah
Pearlsteen direct of the U.S. law and security program at Human Rights first. So if I were one of
the troops who was being asked to conduct interrogations using those techniques I would certainly want

have to find legal rights of terrorism detainees of good mo be moaning what he called a crazy
quilt system Pentagon and law enforcement official defendant current practices at the US military
prison camp Abu Gharr it made me that it's too hot to handle for Congress made me that it's too
complex to handle for Congress or maybe that Congress wants to sit back as we customarily do
said Arlen Magic Bullets specter Republican of Pennsylvania he said his panel for testimony on
practice and policies at get mo but in any way Congress has an act that he said the hearing came
against a backdrop of growing reports of US abuse Senator Patrick Leahy of Ramothi Senior
Democrat on the committee called a president international embarrassment to our nation to our
ideals and remains a festering threat to our security and of course he is absolutely correct
I think he told me to go join himself again remember that yeah he did that good
born again Christian Dick Cheney or Mormon what is that he's from what huh I don't know
he's from Wyoming I keep thinking he's from Utah I know that he's not from he's from Wyoming
that's even worse yet is speaking of even worse and right wing fanatics and born again
fundamentalist wait to do this I mean it's not surprising but it's very disturbing those groups
that this other caller was talking about two calls back they're all in here leaders of conservative
Christian organizations plan to join the interview Republican contenders for the 2008 presidential
nomination perhaps even endorsing one of them steps that could expand their already considerable
and scary political influence we'd like to try to stay together Tony Perkins present the
anxious family research council said that a breakfast with the reporters yesterday the ad hoc
group includes free thinkers and strong personalities he says but they might unite behind the candidate
who unquestionably best represented their views and priorities god if we could only bring Hitler

sessions likely to begin after the 2006 midterm elections would be a very effective way to nail
down where people are on cultural issues you know like bags and abortions and abortions and bags

candidates have become very astute in answering written questionnaires in ways that avoid making firm
commitments those who plan to participate include leading figures of the Christian right James
Dopson of focus focus focus on the family Paul Weirich of the free congress foundation the
Reverend Donald Wildman of the American Family Association Perkins and Bauer others would also
join them and we're not talking about hanker Johnny Bauer we're not even talking about Papa Bauer

lobbying to restrict abortion ban same sex marriage and confirm conservative right wing fundamentalist
fanatical fringe judges their top priority perkins said is winning confirmation conservative
supreme court justice's evangelical Christians who overwhelmingly backed L president in 2004
already had an influential constituency of the Republican Party no Schmidt coordinated action
could increase that influence especially any crowded GOP primary field it would have an impact
Republican strategist Charles I'm not black said but being seen as the candidate of a Christian
right would be a very very mixed blessing in the general election since Stewart Rothenberg of the
nonpartisan Rothenberg political report a candor water mondayl stamp is the candidate of labor in
the 84 campaign that would really pigeonhole a candidate Rothenberg said Perkins both favorably
of one likely Republican presidential contender senate majority leader Bill Fist of Tennessee

he criticized as the bipartisan committee or compromise that McCain and 13 other senators
replaced month who were very showed on judicial filibusters Perkins said those who joined were so
called the so-called gang of 14 risk political repercussions the family research counsel on

those we got twenty three percent of this audience don't gamble and we salute them okay it's
hard to make that money don't just give it away okay a fool of his money are soon farted
don't ever forget that but i mean if you just want to go for a little bit of recreation and
plunge a few thousand nothing wrong with that right right so jay says so you're not going to
Vegas again that's good that's a good thing because if you did go out there you'd be tempted you
be plunged in you'd be a you know because of my bad influence you'd probably take a couple
hundred and sit down there at the wheel of fortune and put it in there and maybe hit like three thousand
on the line say you know this is really good yeah i probably would sit at the black end that would
be really bad unless you just quit right there i know people like that who just uh in fact weren't
you tell me about somebody uh we're just doesn't know how to quit no no somebody got lucky once and they
just walked away and they never made another bet maybe the cab driver was telling about that just
walk away yeah my god friend who who hit the ten g's that was right one pull one pull that was it
what was he pulling the lever i say are you serious one pulling one ten grand ten grand oh i can't
stand that i mean there's one thing to be lucky that that's disgusting that is yeah keep
inducing so maybe whatever machini hit it on the person that was playing before was still around
you know and maybe punched their guts out there and poured all kinds of money and it is lost
their ass and as they're walking away they see your friend come up and put in the couple of
points uh your friends that that's a good machine for us happens to all of us two different times
at the five dollar wheel of fortune i have moved from one machine to another and had somebody sit down
right next to me within like 60 seconds it has been for five grand right next to me how do you
like that i don't get up five six out of five sixty if it look it just happens case a ross
or you know you can't second guess yourself just keep y'all i'm written upward and forward and downward
blackjack seems to be the winner and why not because it's easy to play so you don't understand i always
always had to feed the note was fixed well i always did and he said that about that
thing i just always had to feed that it was rigged i just i don't know every time you start getting
really hot and win in hand after hand and they change the dealer and along come somebody with like
a mark deck or something i don't know what it is w-e-q-a-m hello hey nil this is my philosophy or
strategy on flawed machines you play at the indians for about three weeks yeah absolutely no
chance of winning because they take out 50 percent okay good five six seven oh five sixty
pound five sixty and they've arrived in singular wireless lines when you i guess it's during the
lunch hour maybe that's when these people it was the same yesterday yeah well when the people
across the street they must have nothing else to do maybe we can get some food the food sent
over there for them so they could eat could afford to eat as opposed to be calling us that'd be
a good idea w-e-q-a-m hello q-a-m hello that sounds as silent that's about the nicest sound i've
heard in a very long time in it i mean completely clean line yeah w-e-q-a-m hello q-a-m
yeah nil yes sir yeah you're absolutely right about the one-arm bandit i did the same thing on
the yacht on the cruise ship one woman was playing she's the only one playing the one-arm bandit
she got up and left i went down sat down quarter i got four dollars i'm right nice gone
she went she went to the zirk yeah really oh she went to the manager right you're lucky like
a split with her you're lucky she's a boy your crab boy split it with her yeah right oh listen
there are people around casinos by the way who will pull that crap uh oh yeah there are all
kind of stuff that goes on you know you want my machine okay and then they'll like a standard
50 minutes you hit like two or three grand okay well uh how about six seven hundred six seven
hundred what i'll split something yeah your brain if you had one your mama that's what i have
for you your mom and i'll get lost get out of here i didn't drag you out of the chair you loser
you piece of crap you w-o-o-n hello hey welcome the ill uh yes sir what's in the show intervention
people different addictions yeah came to the conclusion that gambling is the worst
vice only because like if you're an alcoholic or a crackhead or whatever at least you're taking
something physically into your body that you're addicted to that if they remove that you can get
over it but gambling these degenerate gamblers will sit there and even if they win they'll stay
till they lose all their money it's that's nice yeah so not a bit oh well it's like the guy in
owning the honey in that movie which was a true story he won he won like nine million dollars he
was ten million in debt he won nine million on a really hot wild night and he lost every time of
it back oh it's the worst and then on the show intervention the gamblers were the only ones that
a didn't want help or if they did they leave treatment after five six days and go back to the
five year understand why it's like it in the same movie he keeps saying why don't have a
gambling problem i have a financial problem uh yeah just ridiculous so in other words he didn't have
he just didn't have enough money to keep perpetuating his habit i just always considered it the worst
advice i'm glad i don't gamble but you know something and you maybe inspire me to go out to
wood buy me today thanks a lot of family take it easy now the gamble for you how's that all right
i i don't look at it as a vice it's like anything else i mean drinking isn't a vice unless
you overdue it the animal isn't a vice unless you overdue it that a vice looks you have to huh
it's not a vice unless you have to do it right a little wacky gong jaint that's not a bad unless
you overdue it unless you're obsessed with it and you said they're picking seeds out of your
weed and out of your wherever all day it's like it's like anything else in moderation right ice cream
isn't a uh vice unless you overdue it correct correct that's right but like when you're eating two
three points four meters a day for quite a while diabetic at over 60 see i disagree with what he
said too because the things that you're doing with heroin and coconut stuff it's physically debilitating
you destroy your body i mean just take a look at David crossbeef he's just standing right but
and gambling if you could afford it then you know big no nobody even if you can't afford it at least
you're still at least still you have to help me now maybe emotionally you're a basket case
but physically at least you still got your health right it's a trip so let's all get online and
let's plunger guts out not don't ever do it okay don't ever point your figure of me say
need a Rogers is the one it's not ever got in fact the internet does not exist there are no online
gaming places and do not look up slot machines online because they all look very glitzy and fancy and
play like 80 million games and you'll never see your money and we had one person in here that
cross that the one guy said in a couple of weeks he got his money from that one online thing right
in a couple of weeks maybe they got maybe they're lucky in the side that pay a few people off make it
look good 12 13 if in fact you know something i think we just came up with a great idea let's let's
just like Halliburton does with those offshore phony offices let's open up a place like in a
rubah and pretend we're going down to investigate that sounds great they don't have any crime down there
right although they do have gambling and and we can have our own offshore online gambling

profile people and refused to comment on a possible Clinton deal Clintons or a fiscal upie me
of the reach for comment clear channel owns premiere the radio network that syndicates them ball
the network can generate serious fireworks by scheduling both shows back to back industry
watches believe Clinton has some honor experience last year we did a town hall style short of

of drug abuse in limbo as medical records can you believe that why don't they leave poor
of piled pop and hypocritical on liberal conspiracy pond beach county prosecutors told a judge
yesterday they want to see all a rush limbo sees medical records of determining whether he
engages in a long term pattern of criminal prescription drug abuse for the first time prosecutor
said the records could provide a crucial link between allegations by limbo's former housekeeper
Wilma and later allegations that limbo engaged in doctor shopping for prescriptions the former
housekeeper Wilma Klein and her husband David Tultemescavus they sold limbo a large quantities
of prescription drugs bought on the street for many years according to the search once used

inquirer has to say assistance data attorney James March told Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Thomas
Barkdall that the records could show that the conservative radio host engaged in doctor shopping
secretly obtaining overlapping prescriptions from different doctors in one month after the
client stopped selling to him there was a definitive start today prescription medications that
definitive start may welcome inside with the clients withdrawing their willingness to
witness with Mr Limbaugh March said more than a year and a half after prosecutor sees records
from four limbaugh's doctors in late 2003 they're still waiting to review them limbaugh's high
profile attorney where black is waging an intense legal battle to keep the record secret Barkdall
will soon rule on which records if any prosecutors can review black saw to have the
words ruled invalid by Barkdall the judge who approved them in the first place black
contents and investigators misled the judge and they're validated outlining the allegations to
support the ones Barkdall rejected the argument but black and raised it again
March said the prosecutors want all the records regardless of the time that they cover
in this case the investigators didn't know whether the things that were shown to you in the
affidavit were the sum total of violations what they did know is that they showed a pattern of
violating the law who's been on the air for years putting a finger with all the druggies out
there they should all be on death row they should all be eliminated and exterminated all of these
things yada yada yada how do you like that can you hear me rushers you hearing hearing still bad

believed to fear that mr. Stead may leak the images to the public and revenge for losing their case

with the carcasses of others no human injuries were reported here's the bad news though
yeah some of the cats escaped uh oh that's the bad news some of the cats escaped as firefighters
fought the blaze some were rescued and may die the fire rescue said exact numbers were not yet
available trappers have been called in to try to snare the cats that escaped the flames
give it here people going and snaring dogs yeah you have sure oh pit bulls I guess yeah other
I put pit bulls in cats in the same category the fire was reported around 921 pm at the home on the
2600 block of Florida Boulevard owned by a long time resident Diane Gennikin she wasn't home at
the time of the fire when firefighters showed up they found more than fifty cats in the resident
several cats were found dead inside also some were just skeletal remains other carcasses in
zip lock type bags wall that was good at least code enforcement officers later deemed the house
uninhabitable because of the animal waste found inside oh jeez if he just had a big litter box
if i do like that a friend and more and more of these places where these people are like
a hold up in the house they got like 80 million of her dogs and cats and they're like living in
these little cages and uh oh what is that all about crazy they're just lonely yeah that's it
is that what it is let's ask Ron hey Ron how's that Russian we're like telling Ron keep trying baby
this is another one of these stories it just it makes me want to puke it's just so stupid so
superficial winner of 220 points you made it out of power ball jackpot says he wants more well that
part I like but the part of the end where he says uh other than high high end racing bicycle he's
got no plans for any large purchases right the guy's name is Brad Duke he says one of my girls is
keeping my feet on the ground not forgetting who I am and where I came from and staying active in
things I like now like biking fitness industry camping racking with my friends keeping my feet on
the ground is not a code going out and buying a yacht well guess what Brad how about going on by me one
sure yeah I'll take one and George and Josh will each take a small one too
and the way in bicycle like right we'll even take a low end or uh you know hind end a man who won
that jackpot Brad Dukeley 33 year old regional fitness director for a health club chain and
boys you either who said he hopes to build a one billion dollar portfolio within 15 years you go
Brad we like you a lot you're the kind of guy we want to get to know we want to be real close
personal friends viewers right since obviously he doesn't have any desire to like go on by a whole
bunch of other expensive stuff right one better opportunity to have than me at my age with this
money to build a billion dollar empire to take care of my family and give opportunities to the people
who have given me opportunities you told the AP on Wednesday hey Brad if you'd like to invest it
with a guy who knows how to make some serious money send it over here and like a brown paper bag
Duke chose to take a one-time payment of 125.3 million rather than 30
about 30 man annual installments of 7.4 million he would receive about 85 million extra taxes
well he sure flushed away a lot of money you know but that again is part of that
you asked thing with the allotters there big rip off in other words he went 220 million
but after all the taxes and everything he's going to get 85 million okay or he would with the
newities but here he's getting lump sum 125.3 so he's given away almost half you see that
he won 220.3 million and he's given 25.3 I'd be really p.o'd
I did just what you yeah I would protest I had a whole lot of
commission officials denied Duke's request to remain anonymous arguing that his name had to be
a public for sure we had no ties to a lot of employees or vendors he wanted to jackpot over
Memorial Day weekend it would have been nice for me to take care of my family without
making it a big thing in their lives but we all came to the realization that it would be impossible
so if that's the way it's going to be let's have fun whether he said before traveling in New York
city for talk show appearances Duke said he told his father and sister about the jackpot but the
rest of his family was unaware until Sunday when he asked to meet them in Sun Valley he said they
had assumed he was going to reveal a terminal illness multi-level marketing scheme were a wedding
engagement surprise Duke has assembled legal financial and public relations advisors to make
business investments and charity donations and is considering appearances on a reality TV program
you know Brad no matter what you do we like you a lot that's the kind of guy we want to get real
friendly with and like I said before I've been on the year almost 30 years in this market
got third man see I made a bad mistake I should I should have kept doing that old old-style
kick it at old style with all those old boring guests and people like Bobby Richardson's mother
law people like that so that some old bag somewhere was a big fan of this show that I was babysitting
for for like 20 or 30 years left me like a 10 20 million in her will right that's something that's
got like 80 cats running around the house and like millions of dollars passed away somewhere never
happened not not a dime not a penny not a cent not a win I mean wouldn't you think how about
just the people that appreciate you and you know what that reminds me of and I can't remember the
guy's name which is a good thing because I don't want to get sued there was a guy at WS news there's
a true story young guy they hired this guy to do talk shows on the weekends and he pulled exactly
what I was just talking about he conned some old lady on the who called in on the year he got her

other people lined up to speak and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
i kept whining and drowning and they started hooting and hollering just like when Arnold was speaking
in california the other day here's some good news finally there's good news today advocates of
rewriting the USA paid for you that they're claiming momentum they've got the big mo after after
the house despite a white house veto thread voted to restrict investigators from using the anti-terrorism
law to picket library records and boasterous sales slips yesterday's 238 to 187 vote came as
lawmakers ramped up efforts to extend the paid for you that which was passed real fast in the
emotional aftermath of 9-11 when congress passed a lot included a sunset provision under which
15 of its provisions are to expire at the end this year since the paid for you that passed
liberals and libertarian oriented conservatives have pressured changes citing privacy and
civil liberties concerns the administration said weakening of the aquedra veto from al
president day no question this is a real shot in the arm for those of us want to make changes to
the pay for you next to representative Bernard Sanders independent of Vermont sponsor the
provision that would curtail the government's ability to investigate the reading habits of
terrorist suspects he said the vote would help rein in an administration intent on shipping away
at the very civil liberties that define us as a nation the vote reversed a narrow lost last year by
lawmakers concerned about the potential invasive privacy of innocent library users they narrowed
the proposal this year to permit the government to continue seeking our records of internet use
at libraries so in other words if you go on the internet at the library and you like pledging
your guts on some online casino they're going to know but that's at least a little tiny you know
send one small step right time one teeny tiny set up okay I guess we ought to take a caller
to now that we have a lot five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty and they've arrived in
singular wireless line nobody Q a m hello on Climino yes sir oh yeah okay we probably get to
the meet-and-my-call has to do with mo the moment but I was just thinking now when you told
George when you were playing the stable thing oh I'm not going to play that or whatever you've
heard about these two guys that are the who-lils are in 95.7 at apparently they got in some hot water
because they were saying all these things they're the ones that have to be down the air you heard about
this right yeah we're listening okay so my wife listens to these clowns in the morning and a few
months back I'm sure you don't you never heard about this one this is a CMQ FM I believe
something like that yeah yeah like one of them you can't really tell he's a hulio he's like
me and George no I sent so and the other one you can get a smile you have an accent sorry the
other one you can tell the hulio my wife anyway they called Howard the kiss Howard's ass and
blowing behold Howard turned around and says well thanks a lot for sucking up by the way we're
the ones that read it you guys out to the FBC man yeah and they got off his but Howard and they
went back and forth that didn't hear the call my wife did you get a shock on this how long
go was this uh nothing no more in three or four months ago they called the kisses ass and how he
was the king of all media and he's the best and Howard yeah by the way we read it you're ass out
you mean Howard Stern yeah oh I used to use the way earlier said he recalled about oh I see about
Howard I was gonna tell you from before I got to the meat of the moment okay I called you a few
days back in reference to these moments right I'm a little confused but I've been confused for a
long time so maybe it's me no wait a minute let's stop for a second I'm confused oh I'm
this thing I mean are you following this George yeah they called up Howard Stern yes yes this
is the fact the kisses that they love him and all the ones who rounded you out to the FCC
well how the hell would what he do that he's not in Florida at least that's what he claims
I think this was still when he was on the air down here yeah but he wasn't able to show
from there oh I know I so how would he be here and CMQ FAMA I don't know Neil but that's
what he told these guys anybody I don't know if it's true or he just said it sounds like to me
of life but anyway moving along so the moment right yeah I called you like a week back or whatever
and we were talking and I thought you had said you can't play any moments where it more gets
raised remember I never said that yeah you told me no that's not correct I can't but then when
I request one you told Josh oh this guy's crazy I can't play that so I don't know but then this
for a different reason there's brothers obviously different language and there were different
stuff it's not because he's getting raped at it because there's other languages now he's getting
raped right oh oh oh really how often and whether you liked it or not this is so insane I remember
when we went to go welcome to America baby if I were you I'd get back in that inner room and head
right on back somewhere well Neil any moment that you can play it he gets raped I'd love to hear it okay
thank you oh my we're just talking to the audio the the Oz song is not a fact the Oz song yeah
there's no there's no word for playing that the Oz one yeah the Ozzy and Harriet one no no
I know which one you're talking about that's what I'm playing that you were playing the little
did yeah before the show right off here oh just a song we can play that what's wrong with that

Attentive paid jackpot you know, I mean
One that's the attention has to come and pay you right and then there are those people who are like good
I don't want to tip them well
I do understand that probably after you lose your ass there you get in the beginning
I wasn't tipping anybody either because I thought well, well a lot of money they're taking for me
Why should I tip anybody but then if you want to get good service?
Right. I want them to pay attention and not let you sit there for an hour
That's the way it works okay because that's part of their pay. Yeah, that's Carla

I was marrying a dark gold grey glitter craft suit white band you said shirt with no tie
Need doctors to hold up my clear socks and spuds
All I have is this king a spray paint and my glove
I have been lucky so far they could have put the bag over my head and spike to me for all a American homo erotic
Oh, we stay sick me there
Yeah
What is that my nose fell off again
Let me
True
You know this is interesting. I'm looking on the CNN site right now. Okay. We have a review of Batman begins and it says
EW review while entertaining weekly Batman begins a triumph and just yesterday and the Toronto star
I read a scaling review just ripping it in the ass. I saw it yesterday and
It was okay. It was just fine. I don't think it was horrible ripping it in ass
I mean, they're probably gonna hate it
Well, you didn't like any of the other I hate everything. No, I don't like the Batman movies. There wasn't one good one
They all suck. Yeah, they did okay. Yeah, I'm not sure if you think TV was great
It's like watching Sherlock Holmes movies with Nigel Bruce and
Basil Rathbone and then watching the Sherlock Holmes craft that came later Scarbridge
So I watch in Dracula with Bella Legosi and then watch Peter Cushing trying to be Dracula, right? Right?
Same thing to watch Batman on TV with the you know, what's his name?
Burt Ward and
Burr Reynolds at West. I know who the hell was him. What is wrong with you? We're just watching it the other day
I remember Adam West best by test although I'll let Robin better
Hey, well you watch that show and then you've to watch these movies and it isn't even related to the comic strip
What does it have to do with reality? What does it have to do with anything and then all this retro garbage?
Oh, Batman begins and then Batman is a baby and Batboy and bats in the belfry come on already enough with the garbage
Or speaking of garbage here's another reason to hate your buddy or Bill Gates
Yeah, Chinese bloggers posting their thoughts by a Microsoft net service face restrictions are what they can write

Microsoft is a multi-national business and as such needs to be on the evaporating in countries around the world and

I like that
China recently introduced spring of regulations. I require all blog owners to register the web journal with the state by the 30th of this month
Regulations require the writer of a blog to identify themselves to the authorities
Okay, you will identify yourself and you will you know eat your chop sui or just give you with the old chop chop your state
I don't but you know they got a man buck you know he started
He's making it because that's right he needs that money
But he wants to catch up to that tarball winner. Here's some bad news Percy Aerosmith
Although I do like Aerosmith a lot Percy Aerosmith who with this wife set a record two weeks ago for the world's longest marriage
died yesterday at the age of 105 his wife of 80 years was by a side married for 80 long
Scruciating years. How do you like that?
Good for him. So he made it. He sent the record to which he wrote
Aerosmith died at his home in Heriford, Northwest of London his bishop said
Aerosmith and his 100-year-old wife Florence wow celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary in a place in the Guinness Book of Records in June 1
Percy and Flow were very happy when I saw the man in the
Anniversary said the Reverend Anthony Prittis bishop of Heriford, Heriford, whatever it is
There was still very much in love with each other. They kept drooling a lot but nevertheless earlier this month
The Guinness Organization recognized the Paris holding records for the longest marriage for a living couple
And the oldest aggregate age of a married couple which would have been a hot 205
Almost old enough to live in Surfside the Aerosmiths who have three children six grandchildren and nine great grandchildren
Send to the key to their long marriage was not to go to sleep on an argument
Aerosmith said there was something else. I always said yes dear. He said keep that in mind George always say yes
Dear no matter what she says it does help it doesn't help
Huh still what's more and then stick your head in that flavor wave the luxe oven for about three minutes on high cook and see what if that's on straight
5675
60 pond five 60 any Verizon see the great part about that is is that you can you can take that top heart off and keep it on

No, your brains
Curl your brains WQ I am hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir
I was talking with my wife the other day about Tom Cruise. Yeah, and she was saying
We're talking about how he's brainwashing Katie Holmes into the Scientology thing absolutely no question about it
And my wife goes, well, that's not so bad. They're like those Christian scientists aren't they?
right
And it struck me that the average person has no idea what Scientology is
Well, and why does the media shy away from that and not say hey Tom Cruise believes in Ali have bays right and Elron
How about don't forget about him they sue everybody right?
Well, how can they sue you if you tell the truth? I mean, it's the truth. They believe in Ali
They just want to create a hassle. It's just their way of intimidating people
You know keeping a mouth shut, but you're not sure we'll talk about him a lot when I'm on vacation sure will
If the average person do what are they gonna get nothing if the the average person knew that Tom
They believed in Ali and they would think the guy's a whole moon right and look everybody's got to have a place to hide
You know, it's a very comfortable closet. John revolt is in there. Lisa Marie. I mean, what's wrong with Tom Cruise being in there?
And if I Katie Holmes just a couple of months ago in an interview in some magazine was saying what a devout Catholic she was and how big Jesus is in her life
Not no mole and now she's joining a church. This is right. He is a myth invented by aliens. There you go by alien
Okay, good luck to Kelly. Good luck to all of us. You fair. There you go. That's for Tom Cruise and for Lisa Marie
You fairy and for John revolt and all the other people involved in that cult
Oh, they got a huge I don't know if it's still there anymore as matter of fact in Toronto they have like a whole block
That they hold up. That's how they operate. I haven't been in an area in quite some time
I have to check that out see if they're still around my good friends at the Scientologist. Okay, maybe I can hop in in their closet for a while
Speaking of that
Challenging earlier findings two studies from a conservative research group reported to us
They that young people who take virginity pledges have lower rates of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases and engage in fewer
sex risky sexual behaviors
However, everybody else says it's a polycrap wait to near which group this is the new findings by the Heritage Foundation
Are based on the same national survey used in earlier studies and conducted by the federal Department of HHS
But the authors of the new study use different methods of statistical
Analyzation that knows in an earlier report that was widely publicized making direct comparisons
Difficult independent experts called the new findings provocative
But they criticized their latest foundations
Analyzation is flawed and lacking the statistical evidence to support their conclusions the new findings have not been submitted to a journal for publication
An author said the independent experts who review the study said the findings are unlikely to be published in their present form
In other words basically as usual you get from the Heritage Foundation it's a pack of life right
Because every study that we read about goes to show that this whole
Absence thing doesn't work and all these virginity pledges and these people are
Doing as much hanky panky if not more than anybody else and get as many diseases and of course all of these things
They can put us it's over a thing
You know, it's really interesting in a way that you know the in the mass media now they put these people on
Well, so and so from the Heritage Foundation or from Hocus Pocus on a family like these are some kind of mainstream
Responsible organizations as opposed to the right-wing fundamentalist lunatics that we all know they are
And they're and they're just all over the place now
It's like even more than the test pattern more than infomercials on a weekend

133.27 before the Doymann itself comes along. A man who played a gully to take part in
a cross-burning severed year ago in Pratt West Virginia lost in his bid to be mayor.
On that good news, yet is Greg Bess, no relation to Bess Truman, Greg Bess garnered 41 votes
in Tuesday's nonpartisan election coming in a distant second to Anne Nys, a social justice
officer at West Virginia University Institute Technology who got 104 votes to other candidates
and got fewer votes than Bess. Bess, a cool mining contractor and chairman of the Towns utility
board has said his rule in the 1999 cross-burning was exaggerated and was more of a joke that just
got out of hand. Just for the record, Greg Bess is not a racist Bess said before the election.
Bess Cleary Gilley in 2001 to a criminal conspiracy charge telling the federal judges
that he built the cross and carried it to the residents of Lucy Roberts who was at home babysitting
for a two-year-old biracial granddaughter. Well, it sounds like just a joke to me, don't it?
He was sentenced to 30 days, and three years probationed $5,000. I think that the citizens were
making a statement that they didn't care for Bess's behavior. In his participation in the cross-burning,
he said Wednesday, Pratt is a southern West Virginia town about 530 residents, 530.
You know, it's a good thing that Josh got to watch the Loverns a couple days ago.
Because when I get a better insight into the nature of the people who are running America these days,
yeah, that's actually what I thought about when I was right. The people who have taken over the
Eam tree crowd. President, thank you, boy. You better go get them out. That's this crowd.
Hey. You better believe it. They're all kin, man. Pittsburgh and account, I got a whole bunch of
these goofy stories. I love them. An account whose motto was live until Friday. Kind of like that
movie, owning Mahoney. Yeah. Oh, and I got bad news for you, George. I knew I forgot something.
What? Bad news. Amazon.com says, uh-uh. Oh, it's like North by North. What do you know? They had
sent me an email here sometime back and said, uh, in order for us to, uh, post-phone the date and
not cancel the order, you have to click here. And so I clicked there and I thought I had it all done.
I'm pretty sure I did, you know, I clicked it and now they're saying, well, because you didn't
respond to yadi-adi, unfortunately, I've had a cancel. So what I'm going to do is I'll go buy it.
All right. I think you're putting your vacation. Yeah, I got plenty of time. In fact,
what I'll do is maybe I'll buy it there. No, I'll buy it here and I'll mail it from there. Okay. I'm
going to buy it. No, because if I, if I brought it, I have to see all those people there. I'm not,
in fact, I probably won't see any of you again, you know, it's been a lot of fun. Bye.
We got your picture over here. Have I got your part? And we got your picture over here on the wall.
Yeah, that's right. Look at the picture. I was younger than anyway. And a count as model was live
until Friday, played the guilty, just living between a million and two and a half million from clients,
and leveraging strippers with gifts and jobs. John J. Bowman, 52, no key to Travis Bowman of Shailer,
or a venereal Bowman, pleaded guilty to the dated, defrauding 11 clients between 1994 and 2002.
According to prosecutors, Bowman spent client money at a strip club,
dropping more than $1,000 a night. He also hired young women to work at his now-defunct business,
Bowman and associates. He hired a stripper as a secretary and gave her 20 grand for a down payment
on a home and paid her $600 a week. The plea of giving calls for Bowman to make restitution,
he scheduled to be sentenced September 22. Live until Friday, that was his model. All right. Now,
we're trying to do it here. Only got like 24 minutes to go today and then of course tomorrow.
I eat humongous shou. I think all great comedy bits tomorrow. No, it's you. Okay. That's not like a winner.
Cut out. I mean, yeah, what are? No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't do that. Like I said, on Monday, I'm
thinking all comedy. Oh, yeah. Golden Retriever summoned a court. Now, my golden retriever was never
summoned a court. That's a good thing. Newton, Massachusetts, look at us, a penny. Murphy is awaiting
his day and court. The question is whether court is ready for him. Murphy is a three-year-old golden
retriever who received a summons last week to appear in Newton District Court to answer a complaint
that he was walked without a leash at least twice and was not up to date on his dog license. Actually,
it wasn't Murphy but his owner, Steven Dean, who was supposed to get the summons. He can't read. So,
I sounded on his behalf requesting hearing Dean told the Metro West Daily News of Framingham. I don't
even know if they'll let him into the courthouse, especially if he drops a number on a floor. When I
be great, when I be a great editorial comment, what would be? Is that your plea? Have you ever seen a
golden retriever doing the old squat belief you may have? It's a very serious piece of business.
Newton police fined Murphy $25 for not having a leash and $25 for not being licensed when
animal control officer John O'Connell stopped Murphy in his master, June 3rd. Court magistrate Henry
Schultz said in his 35 years at the Newton District Court he's never heard of a dog receiving a ticket.
He must not know about those people in California with a chip and got the J-walking ticket.
Right. I think Murphy's the first defender we said Monday. We've had people bring their dogs
into the courthouse but not like this. What are we going to do if Murphy appeals to a higher court?
He said it's a cute kind of like a court. That's probably the kind of humor they tell up there in
the woods in Aintry. That's probably kind of jokes. They really yuck it up pretty good. I would think.
And like I said, these people are now running the country. The Hocus Pocus family, focus on the family,
Hocus Pocus on your family, Hocus Pocus on him, Faggot, and all that stuff. And of course,
the anti-standa flat earth crowd. They're running America. 21 till 2 at QA and I-
Put the go-it.
You're fair.
And I'm a little bit rock and roll. She's a little inner-skinner. She's a little
little down the mountain. She's a little bit bricked and well-sumbed but she's
I hope they care for them. I hope they care for me for the power of my love. Can he
flex and keep my death playing? It's such a hole because I'm a little bit country.
And I'm a little bit rock and roll.
He likes to powder his knob. Like I said, they're 145 at 560 WQM. Here's some good news.
What's that? You know, there's two drunken pilots?
Yeah. Well, they're going to remain in jail until their sentence next month after they
would not bail today. All right.
Dave County Circuit Judge David Young has had an edgy tone as he addressed pilot Thomas
Cloyd 47 and co-pilot Christopher U is 44 and order them held at least another five weeks.
Well, they might just have flown away, you know. They went to jail right after the verdicts were
read last week after being free on bail for nearly three years while the contest of the charges.
And guess what? Not free no more. They're going to be held until they get sentenced. Excellent.
Don't want no drunken pilot on the plane. I get on. I'll say that right now.
Conversely, the charges were dismissed today against the 19-year-old Inlet Grove High School
students charged with hacking the Palm Beach County school district's computers.
Ryan Duncan of Palm Beach Gardens has agreed to pay $2,025 in investigative cost and
completed a hundred hours of community service. He also has to write letter of apology to the district.
I don't sound too bad. What is that? I'll do a say. I apologize. That's it. Right? That'll do it.
Under the agreement overseen by Judge Lucy Chernobyl Brown, the 100 hours of community can be
waived if Duncan agrees to work with the school district and create a program on these
seriousness of computer crime. Investigators believe Duncan legally obtained a password that let him
have access, let him access district servers. Duncan may have received the login information
by looking over the shoulder of a computer technician who was working at Inlet Grove High School in
River, or Beach, where the teams of students, districts spokesman at Harrington said in a
interview. Duncan was arrested last month by school district police and charged with
offenses against intellectual property of felony. He was released on his own record in the sense
of the terms of his release. He's allowed computer access only at work. Our sheriff's official said.
Go out of mine, your computer, Josh. Okay. They'll be hacking it. Speak out of that. Binghamton,
New York. Have you ever been there? Don't. Okay. They'll. A sheriff's department officer is read
faced in a hot water after leaving her gun in a Binghamton County bathroom. Binghamton court house
bathroom. Did I say that right? Let me say it again. In a Binghamton court house bathroom,
a broom county sheriff's department corrections officer removed her 40 caliber
block pistol by using the facilities, but she left the weapon behind when she left the restroom.
I mean, there was a number one and number two and then, like, number, uh, five,
forty-five. That was a 40 caliber block. It could happen to anybody. The gun was found by
somebody who alerted a courthouse security officer. Sheriff David Hartridge told a Binghamton radio
station the corrections officer was without her peace for less than five minutes. Harder said in
investigation, the incident has been conducted. In the meantime, the officers have been taken off
the courthouse detail and assigned a jail duty. He said the officer was very upset over the gun
blunder. Don't be doing it again, sweetheart. Ross did a Wyoming Pam Furtichurk,
that's her name, Fettichurk. Swarshi was going to attend the Mule Day's festival,
even if she had a ride in Mule to get there. And you know what she did? What? Fettichurk and her
friend Tara Lewis traveled some 850 miles on the back of a Mule from Alberta, Canada to
Recreation Day Clarks Ranch in northern Wyoming. See, there's more than Anefree crowd.
Anefree? The women wrote Mule's name, Sadie and Goliath, and brought a pack Mule,
Angel, to carry their supplies. Mule Days, which kicked off two, they celebrate the notoriously
stubborn animal with Mule Centric Races, rodeo, or is that rodeo and other events. For they're
troubled, a tool in and their Mule's will serve as grand marshals for the Mule Day parade.
Well, I thought she was nuts to begin with said Clark, who said his grandfather,
who said his grandfather, true Hollingsworth, made a similar trip on horseback some 80 years ago
to find work in Mietizi. M-E-E-T-E-T-S-E-Mietizi. I had touched it. Don't touch those. He told me she
did what N.C. did Clark said I'm pretty proud of her. Well, that's great. And of course, we know
about John Madden, right? The Humper called in yesterday with the load on that. We didn't need
to hear no stink in press conference, did we? Because we had the good news from the Humper.
I think we should have carried it. Let's carry it today. Yeah, let's get the press
conference. What's on TSN right now? But they got some ESPN crap on here right now. Maybe they
got some spade. Oh, yeah, US Open Golf now. Once this spot is open, you want to hear that? No.
US Open Golf? Or we could go to the Fear Factor on Extreme TV, Extreme Sports, or we could do some women's soccer.
I'm glassful of sports. What are they look like?
We just slightly open high that and it was sliced away. What language is he speaking, huh?
Or we could do Clancy and Night of the Fight. They're doing a toilet payout situation.
They're doing a challenge spot. We don't want to do that. Or...
No, God's Gladys playing a song called Mr. Lucky.
There's always swimming ball case having a big green cup.
Football by playscarred. I feel really happy when you have a thousand years ago.
They'll be the product of your duty and you're much better than anyone.
Let's have that on. We'll take it today and play it tomorrow.
And when you say cop out, you're forgetting something very important, Mr. Hodge. What's that?
That tomorrow there was a mistake on the schedule, but being the honorable Boy Scout that I am,
I said, no, I wasn't going to be a little way tomorrow. I'm going to be working tomorrow.
I'm going to stay here. I could have lied. I saw the schedule. They sent it to me.
And then you were on Friday, June 17. That's right. And then you would have had to work Monday, the 27th.
What was that all about? That's what you wrote down.
Originally. Yes. I understand that. What's...
Maybe I was ever here. Do whatever year in your argue. That's why I say the sheet this time.
I do that every year. Every year you make a mistake and then you argue about it.
I make a mistake. Yeah.
John Madden is having the NBC in 2006 and his money that football partner, Al Michaels, might join him.
Might join him. I don't think there is. Huh? Any question? Is there?
15 must be for its first broadcast. NBC announced yesterday that signed Madden with six-year contract
to be the English on its run and NFL package.
An NBC sports chairman Dick Ever saw a fence to try to lure Michaels after his finish call
on the NBA final for ABC. Michaels and Madden will work ABC's final year running at football this fall.
Why not? Right? Make sense? Keep it together?
Sure. I mean, let's see. Michaels will be 87 and Madden will be like 114. I'd say that like I care.
I asked big news to use Madden. Yeah. And a comfort call. And yesterday we had the exclusive.
It wasn't one of those phony baloney.
The exclusive that some people are peddling on the station if he catch my breath.
When it comes to sport, we just show you the idea of sport.
Sports radio by 16. You can't see it.
