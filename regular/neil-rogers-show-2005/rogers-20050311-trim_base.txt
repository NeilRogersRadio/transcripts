He's particularly good on Fridays.
In the end, in sight.
Oh, the end of the week I'm talking about.
Who says Rockland the Burger?
Don't say one of our hosts, Riffman-Anthus whoever it is.
Is Abuchants the Big?
Oh!
Am I right?
Of course.
Yeah.
Well, he's a literate.
What do you expect?
He knows Spiggetting Glace.
No Spiggetting Glace, he probably works part-time at the Herald.
Maybe he delivers the Herald newspapers on a weekend.
He has very delightful.
Like with a couple of their reporters.
I know that.
Oh, is he really?
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know, come to find out,
speaking of that, that's the reason that the Booster went over there.
Well, I guess most people on the inside know this,
but the audience doesn't.
The reason Booster went over there to $7.90
is because he and Dan LaVansteroid are really tight.
Oh, yeah.
I knew that.
Yeah, well, I get inside like I said, everybody knew that.
They've been timed together.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Were they in New Orleans or somewhere?
No.
No.
It happened at a Johnny Rocket, you know.
Far be it for me to snitch.
Uh-huh.
Well, anyway, Dan LaVansteroid and the Booster are as tight as a sneered rum.
So that's why he went up over there.
I think that's right.
Well, there was, there was another reason too.
And what was that?
We didn't do a very good job of going after him.
Yeah.
With the least that shot job.
We're going after the dolphins either,
because even though it's not officially announced yet,
we have lost none.
No, they're gone.
I can tell you that.
Well, I know that.
Well, you know, and also the play by play broadcasts
will be both changed as well.
Yeah.
Which is a very bad business decision by Wayne and I.
We could have kept Booster here.
Yeah.
If they have made him a decent offer.
If they just sat down with him, they'd be like they wanted him.
They made him an offer he could refuse.
And he did.
You know what?
You know, there was only one person
who ever talked to him.
And they, you know, Greg never did.
No, well, how can he talk to anybody when he's never there?
He's out of this world.
Oh, he could have invited him to wherever he was.
Maybe we could have put him on a space shuttle.
Somebody to Uranus.
What a jackass.
But that didn't have to happen.
I really don't.
I like Boog.
He's a good play by play guy.
But as far as doing a talk show, forget about it.
He is a good talk.
You know, he's a great guy.
We like him a lot.
But that rock and roll talk.
It somehow leads me limp.
You know what I'm saying?
Hey, that was too big.
Hey, Boog, how's it going?
Maybe it's 107.
At 7.
I just, uh, I don't know that.
Oh.
Yeah.
So you're, uh, yes, you're doing a puke routine.
Yeah, I'm puke and all right.
Well, you know, the entire week.
We got feder as it went along.
No, it did not.
It got worse.
Once we got to yesterday and the whole gym,
both of them is in the work part.
You know, something I've said it for 29 years.
I'm going to say it again.
That is that South Florida gets exactly what it deserves.
The apathy, the indifference, there's no passion.
You know, we release in the passion of the Christ
because Mel gives someone to squeeze in all money out of Jesus.
But there's no passion about anything other than
freebies and early brood dinners.
Florida is the most indifferent.
It's La La land.
They're just, uh, are not passionate about anything.
I had, I had dinner last night with a horse,
a very prominent horse trainer who listens to your show.
Yeah.
Nick Zito.
Yes.
And Nick said,
you know, it's amazing that
the brother goes to war to defend our so-called freedoms.
And the other brother constantly takes away our freedoms.
Well, he and the Ian and Yang.
Yeah.
Maybe we can get some of the money,
some of the revenue from the slots if we ever get them for rehab.
Hey, they do what they say they're going to do
and they don't bring real slots in those class three slots.
Oh, they're all they're going to look.
It'll be nothing.
There'll be no revenue.
That's right.
What they're doing is just screw it over the school system
and screw it over themselves.
And I don't think they're going to let him get away with that.
He's, he's waffling on that now.
This thing is going to be in the courts.
I can't.
Yeah.
And then so it'll be another year before it.
And you know what?
You know, it'll be another year before it gets done.
No, better not.
I'm telling you, it's going right to the courts.
I mean, Pompano Park was planted by July 31st.
They'd be up in one of them with at least a part of it anyway.
Yeah.
I know how he would be ready to go very quickly.
Right.
And I'm sure it's a flag clearance.
I mean, highlight.
Carter could have been already too.
Like I said, nobody cares.
Yesterday, I couldn't, nobody gives a crap.
You know, you can't get these people
whipped up into a frenzy.
They, that's why the public systems can do whatever
the hell they want because they know they can get away with it.
Yeah.
And they've got.
Oh, gee, ain't that a shame, you know.
Meanwhile, they had all those right wingers,
all those carpet vaggers knocking the door down in Dave County.
What else then?
Why don't you remember that business?
Yeah.
And they also.
They also.
They can't allow the big portion of the vote.
Why not let me vote?
All the public cares about is where is the early burden
where are the cock fights tonight.
That's Dave County for you.
And Broward, do you understand?
I never been to a stock fight.
Where are the good ones?
In higher Lea.
Oh, I can't go there.
No, no.
I haven't been to higher Lea since the mayor.
Because well, Martinez has hanged permanently
banned from higher Lea.
And you know something, stop and think about this.
Are you crazy?
You think I'm going to go in here after that guy
who's about six foot 10, took a swing at me?
Listen to me.
Stop and think about this.
Higher Lea that went that thanks to John Brunetti
being a real slime ball,
granted into the ground and put it out of business.
You realize that this thing,
if they could have put it over,
they might have been able to bring back higher Lea
if they would have been thinking about it.
I've got a story for you on that, Neil.
Yeah.
Can I take a minute of your time?
Go ahead, take all the time.
I take right up to 150 would be good.
New York.
New York Racing Association wanted to run,
wanted to get out of New York for a month.
They just felt because of bad weather there.
And they approached higher Lea about running a New York meat
for one month at higher Lea every mid-January to mid-February
with a lot of grass racing.
And Brunetti wanted so much
that the Niner walked away from the deal.
Now think about it, if he had accepted that.
Remember he didn't accept the extra,
he wanted two more days from Gulf Stream
to continue the rotation.
To admit, dates rotation,
well he ought to rotate.
If he had taken this deal,
that would have put him on one of those big,
round-full peel ovens.
I must spit.
If he had taken this deal, Neil,
he would be sitting there right now
with, and you know if,
if I Lea had racing,
they would have voted for slots.
Right.
And they would have influenced that segment of the community.
That's the beginning of the nation.
They would have come out and said,
oh, C.C., we like that.
Just by wanting a little more.
And let me like, I said yesterday in Havana back in the heyday
of Batista in the mob,
they were paying Batista off with enormous amounts of cash
so that he would look the other way.
And the casinos in Havana were flourishing.
Those people loved casino gambling.
So you figure, you know,
it just goes to show you how controlled they are.
That was, that was,
I'll just have,
that was a great line you had yesterday.
That's sorry.
It's the start.
Well, I remember in Havana.
I took a half a piece of the birthday cake.
Did you? Well, everybody wanted a piece.
Frado, you broke my heart.
I had a piece for the,
the tag of the, is a piece for everybody.
Frado, you broke my heart.
Exactly.
You don't have a lot of a piece for John Brunetti.
Two is a matter of fact.
And Rale Martinis.
Right.
No, remember how they hung
a Mussolini and he's a mistress.
Yeah.
In Italy.
Yeah, Martin Eagle wanted to see.
I can see the same thing in Havana.
I could just see them hanging John Brunetti
and Rale Martinis side by each.
I can just see that from a big palm tree.
Thank you.
Remember those, all of,
a great old palm trees,
most of them got uprooted by that hurricane.
Yeah, remember they,
yeah, they had one as you'd see on a high stretch.
I've heard that they still got one or two left there.
They could hung inside by each right from a big palm tree.
It's a beautiful place in its day.
Yes, here it was.
Do I think Hylee is kind of like the epitome
of what South Florida has become?
I think the devolution of Hylee is typical of what's happened.
I don't know.
I can't go there.
Oh, no.
He'll beat the crap body.
I know.
Hylee, where they never met a gangster they didn't like.
Well, my weekend's starting now.
Yep. Well, you know what that means?
Yeah, I don't lose too much.
Don't bet on UM by the way.
I guess it's too late for them.
I can't bet on them anymore.
I know they're done.
Yep.
Stick a fork in them.
They're like us.
They're done.
Done.
History.
Okay, well listen, don't lose too much this weekend.
Well, we could have had Tom Durkin call in races
for a month of highly honest.
Right now.
Is he really?
Yep.
He has a place.
Yeah, you know some of you,
you can relate to this too.
Because at the time you spent in Europe and now in Toronto.
But he has a chateau over some place in Italy.
Really?
He goes there every year for a month.
Wow.
I love it.
That's where he's going to be.
And he wants to retire there.
Yeah, I don't blame him.
I'm going there in May.
He loves it.
And you know something.
Harness racing is very big in Italy.
Not so much thoroughbreds.
Although, you know,
Frankie Ditoria is still great.
Let me tell you right now.
You want to put some money down on a great world class,
Jackie.
You know, every time he comes over here,
he wins.
He wins a big race.
I saw him ride and I went to ask a couple of years ago.
Yeah, he's great.
One of all the race.
Yeah, fantastic.
Well, listen, we don't want to talk about racing
because they don't care about that.
They don't care about the slots.
They don't care about the education.
They don't care about nothing.
So we don't want to, they don't care about hockey.
That's for sure.
What a joke that is.
And they shouldn't get a cut.
Right.
Eliminate the town.
So it's like an investigation that's been going on.
I've been doing for almost 30 years now.
What is it that these people care about?
What motivates them?
What moves them besides Guava Barras and Tocquites?
And Dominoes and Domino Park?
Well, you have a nice way to ride away.
What's not gambling?
Keep in mind.
Oh, you know, you made a great point yesterday.
Really?
What's the, who's the head of the lottery?
The governor.
Thank you.
The governor says specifically, he finally is losing it.
He went over the, over board.
He says he's against all forms of gambling.
They should all be stopped.
I thought that would include the lottery,
church, bingo, he says all gambling should be stopped.
And including the permutials, I guess,
which the states in partnership with,
which it goes to share with,
and it's been in the so badly all these years.
What a jackass, man.
What a fat ass jackass who wins by a landslide.
You get what you deserve folks.
Have a great weekend, Hank.
That's my governor and lose a lot.
But that's wait, not money.
I'm doing that.
Good.
I'm working on it.
Excellent.
Me too.
Have a nice week.
I'm sure you can.
See you.
Bye.
Rock solid.
Say hi to the big.
Oh!
Friday, you first dude.
Hello folks.
And thank you, Ed.
What's that?
Emily, man, is it up here yet?
Well, if you've seen them lately,
you know it won't be long now.
That's great to be up here in heaven, not saying.
It's better than the alternative.
In fact, you know, it's so hot down there.
I'm glad you asked that.
It's so hot.
They're thinking of ringdaving at Los Angeles.
I always, always going to be on night like that.
OK?
How about this one?
It's so hot down there.
Who they am, who say?
Ask Hitler if they could borrow a couple of his funds.
I'll tell you, I'm having a great time here in heaven.
Yesterday, I played golf with Bob Hope.
Today, I'm playing tennis with Arthur Ash in tomorrow.
I'm recording some tracks for two-packs next album.
What's it for me?
I have to go back in my room.
Same Peter broke me up in the Michael Jackson suite.
Turns out Michael's Michael Anita
after all.
I hope this is more to come.
Here's Johnny.
He's still there.
Edmund Van, who was making the comeback.
Damn it.
It's 10.
Oh, wait at 5.
60.
WDQ, I am happy Friday to you.
So right during the middle of the show yesterday,
we had some pretty good excitement there.
Would Michael show up in the PJs in the slippers?
Yeah, with just the tease.
And, yeah, and come to find out that the media finally
are catching on.
Oh, he doesn't have a back problem at all.
I loved this morning on CNN, which I had
hated many watching it.
That Rabbi Schmooly-Boteoff, his spiritual advisor,
Schmooly-Boteoff was on the teller step.
And he basically really said is something we talked about.
Months ago, it was in the inquire about all the pills he's
popping.
I got Rush Limbaugh disease.
He's popping pills like crazy.
And so if he looked a little bit in coherent yesterday,
he's coming unglued is what's happening to Michael Michael.
But it is a pretty good question.
What kind of a circus a sideshow?
This guy makes judge Edo seem like responsible.
He's running a circus there in LA, wherever the hell is this.
Because somebody shows up in your courtroom
who's on trial for any serious crime.
And they show up wandering in pajamas.
And you have them sit down, and you continue
with the proceedings.
I mean, get cereal.
Anyway, so we didn't make Bouga Big Offer,
Humper says to try to keep him in the dolphins.
I guess we didn't make a big offer,
because they're going across the street.
I wonder what's taken so long.
The word is absolutely positively.
They will not be using the same broadcasters.
So we will not be hearing them.
Seeing that's such a bad mistake, especially, mad dog.
I mean, he is the dolphins.
Yeah.
So I think that's like I told you before the show,
that's typical of what's going on with the dolphin organization.
They're going to write down the tubes in the toilet.
The season they had last year,
they're one-step era in the whole,
all that business that followed it.
The four and 12 season and missing the playoffs
becoming a regular thing.
And then this is the direction they're going in.
Into the tank.
So it's probably just as well we're losing them,
because you know South Florida.
Have a couple losing seasons in a row,
and it's bye-bye.
What do we root for now?
That kind of stuff.
Here's our poll question yesterday.
The biggest problem with Dade County is,
we had 1642 votes,
and that's losing an hour on the internet, too.
Remember that yesterday we had a little bit of a problem.
Maybe not an hour, about 40 minutes.
Whatever.
Thanks a lot, Eric.
I realize it's not your fault.
We like blaming Eric for just about anything.
If it rains, if it's our cloudy,
it's Eric's fault.
We want to tell you how long he called Josh with,
with excuses or explanations.
No, with excuses.
Whoa, whoa, you know, like, uh,
you know, we're just tired of it.
That's it.
I want that thing running like clockwork, man.
Like a clockwork orange.
We want that thing grinded away,
grinded away.
All the big bucks that I'm paying
are going to keep that thing going.
Grind it away, baby.
We actually were paying Josh a few bucks, too,
but because of his behavior,
lately, because he wouldn't go out there and vote.
You know what I mean?
If he would have gone to Dade County
and carpet-bagged a little bit,
you could have probably voted in Dade.
No.
Yes?
No.
If you would have made the effort,
if you would have gotten some fake ID,
you could have gone there and Dade,
you might have put it over the top.
You wouldn't, uh,
he's 6,000 year best friends.
Hey, it's really sad,
but like I said,
nobody cares.
I'm not going to keep beating my head against a brick wall.
You don't give a craft.
So what the,
can't you,
can't leave a horse to water?
You can leave a horse to the finish line,
but you can't make him cross it.
And that's what it's all about.
Nobody gives a crap.
Man, it is just,
it's terrifying to me that there's just no passion.
It's like, it's like you're living in the middle
of a bunch of lumps, you know?
Bump on a lawn.
Bump on a lawn.
That's South Florida.
I mean, even like in South Carolina,
and in Mississippi,
they care about something.
Even if it's only hate, you know?
Now, I will say in Dade County,
they do, they do hate.
But right now,
there's no particular reason to hate.
Although the biggest problem with Dade County
is it's a banana republic,
548.
That's a little hate.
Banana Republic.
What do you say to that?
Huh?
Absolutely correct.
Nobody's speaking English,
401.
No, great.
But too many old right-wing Cubans,
324,
they control,
they got the keys to the kingdom.
Maybe they're the ones who are pulling the shame.
They're the ones who are making the decisions in the deals.
And it's because the rest of you
are like all busy-completed.
Oh, gee, those Cubans, yeah.
You're all sitting back,
bitching them on and doing nothing.
Including especially the dark community in Dade County,
which is ever-expanding, man.
We got the North Miami Beach
and Liberty City and Overtown and North Miami.
I mean, there's Alopada, huh?
Lemon City.
It is as dark,
even if the noon it's dark.
And Carrie Meade gave it her best shot,
but she couldn't motivate you dark folks to get off your ass,
which is really sad,
because you had a good time losing your money at the slots.
The traffic 159,
the politicians 85,
the non-Hispanic don't vote.
Well, we finally got that up to 59,
but it's still a very,
it should put another number at the end of that.
Like maybe a, yeah,
should have been the first place,
the non-Hispanics don't vote.
They sit back and let a bunch of
sorry-ass green tooth losers
make the decisions for them.
Nothing, data is great.
37 idiots said that, 2.2%.
Misery loves companies,
so they're trying to convince themselves.
They're having a wonderful life,
in Dave.
And the Miami Hero was in last place,
29,
and that's probably because most of our crowd doesn't read it.
And a good choice, by the way.
Here's the facts.
Let's see, we have,
I haven't gotten to the poll,
I'll put that over there.
I haven't gotten to that yet.
I do like putting the poll up there early, though.
It seems to,
seem to generate a little bit of early interest there.
Only Hank and I got to stop talking about race tracks,
so nobody cares about horses,
nobody cares about any of that stuff.
Don't forget on Monday,
let me remind him that.
Okay.
No, that's a tune out.
Nobody cares about the paramutuals
and about horse racing and dogs,
and nobody cares.
And Florida anyway,
it's like one step away from talking hockey.
It's like a tune out.
Like what are these people talking about?
Are they talking in a foreign language?
Frankie, did Torre my ass?
Who are we talking about?
Huh?
10, 14,
and 5, 60,
WQAM,
even-
Hey, Dios mío,
¡Sos carros!
That's a new name.
He's worried,
so we can out.
Looks like the fight-your-o-skies.
Snows from the body revolves.
Far from bush and far from hell,
and eyes close over rice not down.
It happens when she relies.
She raised for criminals' clouds.
Far from bush and body fell to rice.
And she cares for me,
old and crafty.
And she rides for fun,
since that's me.
She's a throussick.
And she's average,
so I hate why.
And I said,
hey, why don't you fight?
What's like she's married
and a fallen woman between us,
died in death.
Body fell to rice.
She's average,
she's just poor.
And when she's always surprised,
she's whimble when she's poor.
Far from bush and body fell to rice.
We gave a short voice and chance for
such a bad chance.
We will rob and wash till we mention that.
And smells just like the magic stars.
I'm a big hat.
Far from bush we devil's eyes
is for dying on a bad day with
body fell to rice.
I call it horse maids.
Marble's fort,
they use on billionaires list or the shootings in Atlanta.
Do you see the picture of the dark,
complex guy that did the shootings?
And the go-and-go-how I like that?
Change it.
Oh, yes.
What did I tell you about dark folks with guns?
Bad combination.
It's like water and oil.
It's like booze and pills.
It's a bad combination.
Anyway,
market to today's pool.
All the stuff, see it's good when we put the new pool up early
and we're getting faxes.
That's really good.
Cinny Margoly says the beta curtain chick today
with boobs.
Didn't you tell me that she the nice
she ever was photograble?
I'd like to say that.
Well, she didn't never postop list.
Then maybe it's a stump photo.
Maybe she's got her head like at the carnival.
You know she's got her head on somebody else's body.
It's a couple of boobies to me.
A couple of big nipses met her fact.
Yeah, there.
Cinny Margoly's sounds awful Jewish to me.
I don't know no go-em name Margoly's.
Anyway, she was born October 1st, 65 and L.A.
And let's see.
Her work is rather limited.
Never did above the ground.
Sol good.
What is that?
Sol good.
Sol good.
Well, Cinny Margoly's show,
chairman of the board, Austin Powers International Man of Mystery,
mad TV, Alamex feel,
Howard Stern's show, radio show,
E-Show, Shastom McNasti,
The Martin Short Show.
I heard that's a short show.
To tell the truth in your dreams is with Cinny,
Comedy Central's can't ham and a few other appearances here
and a few other spotty appearances.
So let's see.
That would make her a 39.
What she is.
Let's see.
Here's a fact from Alankoel Springs who says,
please give it an Ash Cross face on your website.
No.
It's discussing, although it does make the girl look that much better.
Please go nationwide and be a voice for the progressives.
Oh, I have a voice in the world it is.
Here I am.
Yeah, right.
I can hear you now.
Hello, I'm Neil Rogers.
A fat bag from Florida.
I'm not taking it anymore, right?
First team, Neil Mad Dog Fat Hank,
a great day of radio lost.
What the f*** is he called, he says, Alan Corral Springs?
I don't know what that means, but nevertheless.
What he's trying to say, I guess,
is once upon a time we had everything go and just fine
and then Greg kept picking up that egg and breaking it and smashing it
and then trying to put the pieces together.
How many times did I tell you that about the Humpty Dumpty egg?
How many times did I tell you?
Father, I'm sorry to man.
So here's the poll today.
I like this poll.
Thanks.
I think her name was Linda.
Some lady sent this in.
I'm going through my pile poll here desperately trying to come up with something new
and different and innovative and scintillating.
Something we haven't done before.
I know we haven't done this one before, right?
No.
Maybe I schmit canned her, I guess it.
Linda, thank you or whoever was at scinthasen.
And the poll is, who is your favorite actor or actress
who made it big in spite of being ugly?
Got it?
We got it.
It's not all that easy in the beginning,
but then when you really put your mind to it.
Charles Bronson was her choice, Linda's choice,
and a good one, I guess, because he's weeding the pack 70 for Charles Bronson.
He is as grotesque.
Humpty Bogart 45,
Craig E. Old, very ugly guy.
And he had in spite of that, he was like a sex symbol,
Humpty Bogart, him and Lauren McCall, both very ugly,
and both actually looked the same.
You know, even when they were young, they were grotesque.
A lot of wrinkles and I don't know.
All that smoking I guess gets to you.
Humpty Bogart 45,
Oh, Steve Bushimi 23,
was out on the even a hot and hell he sneaked in there.
I don't know where that came from.
Pim it on a fact before the show.
What do you do over here?
Well, what are you eating now, Mr. Hachat?
Bacon, I can eat meat.
What?
Bacon, I can cheese hoagie from Howeese.
Oh, now don't you remember last time
that made you like crap your brains out,
right in the middle of the show?
Bacon, cheese and egg.
Five words, Josh, I'd be like staying real close to that other door.
But we're open for ventilation.
But I'm eating the same thing.
Yeah.
Well, like I said, that's how good they are.
It's worth it.
Like being in church, sitting in your own pew.
Barbara Streisand 15, James Cagney,
a dozen Kathy Bates has got 10,
you know, Cockadoodie, Kathy Bates.
Dick Van Dyke 10,
of course, back in the day when that movie,
Missouri was out, we could say Cockadoodie.
Now we can't say that.
We can't even say howdy, Doodie.
Can't even think it.
And asner 9,
Ben Midmer 8, Peter Lory 8,
fell to the go see 7,
forced Carl off 5.
Yeah, that's right.
Even without the makeup, he was a pretty gruesome.
Betty Davis 2,
ah, this damn thing just changed and moved around again.
And then we got Fred Gwynn,
somebody says,
and we are Perlman.
They're married.
Oh, no, I see.
Danny DeVito and we are probably kind of hard for a Fred Gwynn to be married.
He's been dead for 12 years, right?
Danny DeVito and we are Perlman,
should go under your ugly pole as a couple since they're married.
Can you imagine what their offspring look like?
Probably just like what Witties' offspring
did look like on passions for the four heads, like that can't.
So here for the poor Fred Gwynn, Herman Munster.
He was a really,
usually guy.
Everything needs all that much makeup.
Yeah, just a little bit.
That's what we got so far on there on the pole.
And you can add to it as you wish or not as the case may be.
Now, somebody called in yesterday about this story
and the low and behold there it was,
founded after this show.
In Tampa, and you know what we think of Tampa,
a man apparently enraged by a bush chanee sticker
on a woman's sport utility vehicle,
faces felony charges after chasing her for miles
and tried to run her off the road as he held an anti-bush time police say.
He told our officers that he just got mad at her
so he went after her said police spokesman Joe Durkin.
Nathan, no relation to a Tom Durkin, I'm sure.
Nathan Allen Winkler, 31, was free after posting $2,000 early bond
Wednesday on a charge of aggravated stalking,
which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.
No one answered the phone yesterday at Winkler's home.
I wonder if he's kind to Henry Winkler.
But his father, 59-year-old John Winkler, said it didn't sound like his son.
I know that he's very anti-bush,
but I don't seem doing anything like that to be over Winkler.
He's the least aggressive person I know.
I think it's a good idea.
You see somebody with a pro-bush bumper sticker on her car,
run him off the road, right?
Right.
Just run him into a ditch, gently.
Or maybe like the guy in Atlanta,
it's shooting in the leg a couple of times
just to change their altitude.
Winkler told police he got upset with the woman 35-year-old Michelle Fernandez.
I wonder if she's kind to Giselle Fernandez.
See, isn't this amazing?
After she made an obscene hand gesture,
Durkin said Fernandez was taking her 10-year-old son
and three-year-old daughter to a ball field
and her four-expedition to it.
They were in the incident occurred.
Whatever gestures I made,
I made it because I was trying to figure out why he was
mocking at me and pointing at his son Fernandez
told the St. Pete Times.
Police said there's Winkler chased the woman's vehicle
to heal up a small sign in his Nissan,
sedan that read,
never forget Bush and his illegal war,
murdered thousands in Iraq.
I think he's got a hell of a point.
Right.
Maybe he has that sign with him,
so he's prepared anytime he comes up
against the Republican Durkin, said.
According to a 9-11 call made by Fernandez,
Winkler attempted to run her off busy city streets
at one point, pulled in front of her,
got out and began running toward her vehicle.
Oh my goodness, he's a fanatic.
He's in the middle of the streets.
He said, I'm an islander tape.
Oh my God, she said.
Oh my God.
Just like that.
Fernandez eventually made it to the ball field
where the children fought a police officer
and described the current license tag number.
Within an hour, police arrested Winkler at his home.
Fernandez also said she's a registered Democrat,
but voted for President Bush in the 2004 election.
Another one of those Dixie crats,
you know, make believe airsots, Democrats,
which we have somebody in the South,
I don't buy, especially with air in Tampa.
Oh, I'm a Democrat, but I voted for Bush.
I voted for Ocasius.
I voted for Nassius,
and because it's throughout my alley, selling.
I bet she goes to Crystal a lot,
guaranteed.
She's just the kind of person that goes to Crystal
and maybe wants to know how to heart ease, you know?
She don't have enough good taste to go to Stake and Shade,
which I realize the Burgers stock they fall apart,
but the shakes are great.
Yeah, what's going on here?
What's going on here?
What's wrong with hearty?
No, there's nothing wrong with hearties.
It's just that red next go there.
I don't know.
Yeah.
You know what they get?
See, the good stuff at hearties like the Schroenberger,
which I love those.
They don't get that or like that monster burger.
They get the, they get the gravy and biscuits.
I know what you're laughing about.
That's a hearty speciality, baby.
That's what they're known for is their breakfastes
with that gravy and biscuits.
White man, one thing about those biscuits is that they affect your brain.
That's why the people in the South behave and think and act the way that they do
and speak the way that they do and are generally highly uneducated
and really a bunch of mugwumps is because
too many of them damn biscuits at hearties.
I just, if you have a hearty appetite, that's a good place not to go.
Try the you bastard.
Bad.
Or so bad.
We're just living right the way we want to.
It comes on game and that is all.
It's what they say those nasty things they do.
It's because I'm gay and that is all but it could be so hard.
Inside you.
Oh yes, so hot.
Inside you.
Inside.
1033, 27 before 11 at 560 W Q A A and we got Moll Howard David.
He's going to have Charles Hest, a charlton Hestan on this afternoon, 230
and talking about gun control.
Jim managed it for and broadcasting from Publix at 90 50 Biscayne.
Bull of my mind, he sure is number one.
It was a man, mad dog at the fruit market at Publix.
I don't understand that.
Goliath 7 and then Eddie K 10.
Now we had a separate schedule, standby schedule, a KCN1, but guess what?
They lost.
They lost.
Oh, and speaking of that, the bit we just played.
I just want to little heads up for anybody out there that buys into this
craft about guys who are earrings and they're left to hear our straight.
We've discussed this many a time over the years on the show and I just want to make it very clear.
I hope Josh doesn't have any guys who are buddies who are earrings in either ear.
I mean, I know somebody with earrings.
Yeah, they wear two these days.
FAAAAMING!
Yeah, well yeah, at least it's a little more honest wearing two.
Because any guy that wears an earring is there.
He's ready for anything.
You know, I mean, he's treballist.
When you're wearing two.
There you go, that's right.
A defendant stole a weapon from a deputy in shot and killed a judge.
See, this seems to be going on a lot more lately, you know what?
I killed a lot more.
How is it that these deputies are so fast and loose with their weapons, huh?
When you think it'll be a little bit difficult.
But a defendant stole a weapon from a deputy in shot and killed a judge at the Fulton County
Courthouse this morning.
TV reports that a court reporter and two deputies also were shot.
Atlanta police spokeswoman Miriam Lee said one person was shot in the court house parking lot.
Another was shot outside the courtroom reportedly on the eighth floor of the courthouse.
And they showed the picture.
They had the guy's name, boy.
Their website is so far behind.
They showed the dark, complex suspect.
So now we're going to be a suspect because they seem to do it.
Dark folks and guns, they're very, very dangerous, volatile combination.
Definitely unacceptable.
Speaking of guys who used to be dark, but aren't anymore.
In the most critical day of his trial so far, Michael Jackson hurt his accuser level
graphic allegations of child molestation in the yesterday.
After the singer arrived late in pajama bottoms and slippers and was threatened with jail by a
judge who was unsway by his claim of a back injury.
And by the way, everybody who knows him, I will tell you, he don't have no back injury.
Even schmooly botell.
I just like saying that.
I like hearing it.
Oh, schmooly botell.
His spiritual advisor, former.
The dramatic entrance quickly paled as the trial reached the heart of the prosecution's case
with the accuser describing Ludre Marx and acts by Jackson, then engaging in a competitive
exchange with Jackson's lawyer.
After you met with an attorney, you came up with a story that you were masturbated by Michael Jackson.
The attorney, Thomas Mezzar, who Jr. said, and an attack on the most damaging testimony
given against Jackson.
The boy denied that attorney's influence.
Then he became defensive under the cross examination.
He said he once considered Jackson's best friend in the world, but indicated he felt rejected
by the star one point.
The pop star wearing your coat over his t-shirt walked gingerly into the court.
Yeah, gingerly.
He looked like ginger.
After being treated at a hospital for what was described as a serious back problem, resulting
from a fall.
Jackson, around, that's interesting because there were two different versions.
You hear them screaming about it on CNN this morning?
No.
His spokes lady, she first said that he woke up and couldn't walk at all.
He woke up with a bad back problem.
And then one of his other flunk, he said, oh yeah, he got up and walked around and then he had a bad fall.
I see.
So you figured out.
You take your pick.
Jackson arrived after Judge Rodney Melville threatened to arrest him and broke his
$3 million bail that just later vacated the warrant.
Jura has only got a hint of the strange courtroom drama.
Mr. Jackson, that a medical problem that was necessary for me to order his appearance,
Melville told Jura's, and he didn't want the panel to draw any negative references inferences
from the developments.
Now somewhere in here, I got, oh here it is.
From the New York Daily News today.
Inside his footage, Jackson will commit suicide.
And he also heard that from Schwoldy Botan.
I think he's going to kill himself, but that the drugs are going to like,
because these puppet pills like crazy even rushes jealous.
Good.
Yeah, we couldn't, it couldn't happen too fast to make us happy.
Michael, the Roger, oh this is not from the Daily News.
It's from Fox News, so you know it might be a one in ten chance.
Michael Jackson's close friends now really fear that he will commit suicide.
The scene yesterday morning at the Courthouse in Santa Maria's
commenced people who ordinarily did not say these things,
that Jackson is in serious mental trouble as in,
like that.
It says here he makes Greg Reed look sane.
One thing is for sure, the combined pressures of his financial peril and seeing his accuser
on the standard of undone Jackson as Burton Cummings and I guess who would say,
he come undone.
My insider says he doesn't have back trouble as Jackson claimed he's making it up,
but he's definitely in pain he's creating it.
Jackson's publicist Raymond Bain insisted Jackson called his lawyer at
515 yesterday morning to tell him of his severe back pain, but I can tell you,
the right Roger Freeman, that Jackson also made other calls to a variety of people.
It didn't sound like he was in pain, he sounded like someone who'd been up all night
and was frantic, who was like a duff when he was doing the dump buttons on the Howard Stern show.
Do we have that thing?
Yep, I don't know what it's called.
That sound? I don't know what it is.
What we got this?
Still off?
We got this instance.
We got that.
So anyway, believe what you want.
Okay, let's take up our calls.
56670560,
pound 560 in the Verizon and Singular Wireless line.
WDQAM, hello.
Hello.
Yes, hello.
Yes.
Neil.
Yep.
I just wanted to thank.
First of all, the rate is half the anniversary.
Oh, thank you so much, yeah.
And I'll have a very good rest of it.
Dick Feinberg at the Victory Party and he said,
Neil was great.
I said I was listening to him all day.
Of the precinct and he was just great.
He was just great, but there's the thing on class too.
Yeah.
I don't know why he's stuck.
This is the guy that sounds like Bob Lincoln.
No, no, no, no.
This is that.
This is just a very much fan.
How are you doing?
I'm still in the middle.
Stay the word timer.
This is Stan Wartheimer.
Back to Neil.
Get out of here.
You, oh, jeez.
He must be covered up in a phone with like a soccer something.
Dude, the disguise and the more.
Get out of here, okay?
I thought this guy, whoever the hell is this,
this is the most boring ponder with stuff I've ever heard in my life.
When you stop, stop it already.
Go away and stop kissing my ass and stop
when you're gambling obsession, okay?
Get yourself some mental help before it's too late.
Oh, jeez.
It's lucid one.
But one great thing about Moe,
how did they put it in his home?
In the middle of the night.
At least they caught it in my ass,
for Asian's sake.
Stay away from me.
I don't even know how you have children.
Miramar, hello.
Yes, I want your take on J. P.
Oh, J. P.
They really is a great court of acting.
A good judge.
I like J. P.
Well, not to mention,
he's got extraordinary smooth detoxes.
Oh, yeah.
You're going to be jiveful, what you say here.
Oh, jive, though.
Thank you, Moe.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
Go, go.
But I have nothing else to say.
How about this?
I was going down there in a mirror, Moe.
I'm right down the street from you.
Oh, yeah.
I have to go.
Oh, I know.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, I have to go.
Wait, tell me what?
I'll hold you open up right now, Sam.
I'll give you one of my old taint-teachers.
How's that?
I know.
No way.
True.
That was the only color we had.
The things on your nose is blowing again.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Why?
The dog is blowing.
Why?
The dog is blowing.
Wow, you got big, we both big.
On your nose and on your face.
And around those holding symbols,
you walk my eyes out loud.
If you go up and down here, I don't see.
A rose mask of yips and zips.
You got your happy sun.
Way to die, die, die.
I know clothes was something to stay.
Almost every day I stay.
Am I painstakingly stuck at the cold?
I had annoyed, and the door to door to the cold.
Yeah, I woke up, I've come for an aback.
That's where the common criminal died.
The little text from the twinkle of pain.
Yeah, I've got two hearts in sleep.
And I've got a star on me.
How are you now, Adam?
Please sing, Michael.
Michael.
Go, go, go, go.
Yeah, I've got two hearts in sleep.
You need to try not to say that.
Go, go, go, go.
10.25 at 5.60.
You have to do Q.A.N.
Chase says, Clint Howard for the pool.
He's Ron Howard's brother.
He always plays small roles in all his movies.
He looks like a shorter, uglier Ron Howard,
but he's in a ton of movies.
He usually plays interesting, or bizarre characters.
He's a freak, yes.
I love Chase.
And the movie last night.
What about Gary Busey?
OK, with those teeth.
He is one of the ugliest people that ever said,
put on the face of the earth.
Yeah, but he's got big teeth.
Well, regardless, with or without the teeth,
he is grotesque.
Gary Busey, now I'm not sure if anybody
will like him or not, but that's a give it a shot.
Also, Chase says, I'm 31.
I've had both ears pierced since I was 50.
And I'm not blaming.
I have a wife, you know.
Seriously, it's not that uncommon.
I know that, Jay.
I just say that to aggravate certain people.
Like, Josh, make him wonder about it.
You wonder about it, Jay?
Not really.
Yeah, you are.
Love the show.
Keep up the 50 cent story today.
We don't have no 50 cent story, Jay,
but starting on Monday, we'll scour desperately
to find the 50 cent shooting story of the day.
Oh, we got the shooting in Atlanta.
That'll have to do for today.
Triple shooting.
Let's see, speaking of dark folks,
how about Wesley Snifes?
That is one black son of a bitch that says.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Yeah.
He's a, well, he's dark.
There are some black folks like Malcolm,
like what's his name?
Shamar Moore.
Yes.
It was back on that show.
I don't watch that show.
The young or any, but it's on like right before the news.
I'm global at five, 30 every day.
So I see the ass end of that show in the last couple of minutes.
And Malcolm is back.
Well, now he's got the corn rows.
Oh, that's over.
Over and over.
Huh?
Yeah.
I don't know what bothers me more.
Dreadlocks or corn rows.
Huh?
Well, they're similar.
No, no, similar, but not a match.
And the board goes back.
And he morphed in that as ponytails.
I am just not a ponytail kind of guy.
Just leaves me limp.
Yo, it's like George Carlin.
I mean, George Carlin can get away with it
because he's a 60s kind of guy.
You know, he lost that 20 years ago.
No, but I'm saying he could get away with it
because it matched his whole ambiance.
But there are some people now like, what a grabor, for example.
What does he need a ponytail for?
Even your buddy Jeff Coney used to be my friend.
Even he knocked his off and a ponytail too.
Remember those days when we were good buddies with him?
Sure.
But then your buddy Skippy got involved
and then Rimmer got opened up a big mouth.
Bop, bop, bop, bop.
There's nothing worse than people with a big mouth, you know?
Sturing the pot, smoking it's one thing,
stirring it's another thing.
Oh, and here's an idea for a future pool.
Let's see.
We've favorite, uh...
Oh, that's a good one.
We had done that for not in a long time.
Favorite drop-in, like...
Bop, third man.
OK, let me put that in my pile pool
and thank you so very much for whatever that was.
We got Flint Howard.
We got Gary Busy.
Yeah.
In case you tune in late, we got a very important poll today.
Who's your favorite actor or actress
who made it big in Spider-B and...
Ehh!
Ugly, really ugly.
What's all that chaos during Atlanta?
And he has ever encountered...
He described the court, the court clerk,
who was also involved in court reporters
as baking cookies and brownies for the jurors.
A very special woman.
In fact, they brought her a thank you card today
because today was expected to be
the last day of the trial.
In describing Mr. Nichols, they said that...
Brian Nichols, 34, 6'1, 2'10, big, good, dark guy.
Blue way to judge and two other guys,
with two other people,
are fighting for their lives.
Because crazy people with guns, that's what it's all about.
All he did take to deputies, go to an all-fairness.
Let's see, here's the facts from Louis
in Chattanooga, Tennessee, listening online.
Thank God for Louis and all the other people listening online.
You know we get over a thousand people listening online
every day, you know that?
Yeah.
Right before the election, we had over 2000 a day,
but now we're like 12, 1300 every day.
It's pretty good.
And if anybody knew about the show,
we'd have a zillion people listening online.
Of course, once we get on serious,
and I'm serious about that,
they will have like thousands and thousands of people
listening all over in North America.
And they'll be saying, look how does this all about?
What kind of crap is this man, I'm peddling?
I don't know.
What good fortune for those in power
that people do not think that's the quote from Adolf Hitler?
These are some scary, scary days, is Louis.
And Louis, I'm going to tell you why it's really scary.
Not only because of the kind of thing
that you wrote there, because we're reliving it all over again,
because this time the public just isn't giving crap.
All of, I'll say that during the Hitler era,
it was the same thing.
During WW2, the only people that,
when they started caring is when the bomb started falling
in their backyard, then they started getting real nervous.
Other than that, they knew what was going on over there.
They just didn't give a crap.
You know as long as there was somebody else who cares,
maybe those people need a good shower anyway, right?
Time to clean up their act.
So anyway, the poll today, I just got you saying that.
Did I read it? No.
Your favorite actor actor has made it big
despite it being ugly.
Charles Bronson 78.
Humphrey Bogart 54.
Steve Busheebe's got 45,
which he's doing an extraordinary,
extremely well.
Danny DeVito 22.
Barbara Streisand 19, although we did love Danny DeVito
in Cuckoo's Nest.
Yes, Mr. Mancini.
Great.
Barbara Streisand 19.
James Cagney 14, who never did say,
what does it say?
He's supposed to have said,
you dirty man.
Oh, you dirty man.
Never said that.
Never.
And also, what's his name?
What's his name?
Humphrey Bogart.
No, not Humphrey Bogart.
What's his name?
Never said,
Judy, Judy, Julie.
What's his name?
Sorry, man.
Sorry, man.
James Cagney 14,
Kathy Bates 11, Dick Van Dyke 11,
Ed Azner 11,
vet Midler 10, Peter Laurie 9,
Boris Carlisle 7,
Bellagosi 7.
And for both of those guys,
Carlisle 7,
he wasn't a fortuitous
that they were ugly and looked very bizarre,
like monstrous,
even before the makeup went on.
That's what made all that money for him.
We are Pearlman 3,
Fred Gwint 2,
Clint Howard 1.
None yet.
They just went on there.
And I love the way we're spilling very busy.
Here is very busy.
Well, give a call and see if he's got a couple minutes for us.
Very busy,
D-U-S-E-Y.
What is with you, child?
Like he cares.
Well, maybe he doesn't care.
Maybe that's the problem.
No, I do.
I'll fix that right now.
No, you don't.
Why don't you admit that you don't care?
Why don't you just admit it?
Be honest once you're near life.
Why are we like this?
We don't, we like you because you don't care.
Okay, you fit right in with QAAA.
No, but I do.
Like ourselves,
the problem,
they don't care.
That's my biggest personal failing
is I have the inability to fit into QAAA
because I refuse not to care.
Like our sales manager who's a real slacker.
If you look up slacker in the next area,
see his picture next to it.
There he is.
What's his name?
Clint Cliff.
What's his name?
Clint Howard.
Whatever his name is.
Sounds like you need care to pee.
What is his name?
You know, I forgot.
The sales manager, Curtis, Curtis,
see, you're really off your feet today.
The other day, you came up with one from,
from, I don't know, the bottles of your existence,
some name.
And now today,
easy ones,
they're going to carry granite.
Yeah, they're going to be justice.
Wow, wow, wow.
That was shocking.
How many minutes did he work at IOD?
About 30 minutes.
Half an hour he worked there in this guy.
Remember him,
well, he's, you know,
never met her.
He's never getable.
I met him once.
Came in and his friend,
the fame was about 100 years ago.
He worked at WBZ.
And then don't call me old,
but 100 years ago,
I worked at WBZ.
Well, if it was 100 years ago,
there he must be an old cout.
And like you said,
he wasn't even as old as I was.
And when they asked him,
he filed these lawsuits
for age discrimination.
Oh, God.
Give me a break, Larry.
The fact that it matter is,
you sucked on here.
That's why they fired it.
Just one of those things.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,
pound 5, 60 on the Verizon
and singular wireless lines
on a very singular Friday.
I just, I have to admit,
that's my biggest failing
is that I just can't stop caring.
And I, you know,
and that's not a good thing.
That's a bad thing.
It'll be the debt to you.
If I could, you're right.
If I could just be as
indifferent as these bastards,
here, Curtis and that whole sales department,
already talk about slackers, man.
Talk about people that they don't want
to lazy way up.
They just don't want to do not even,
whatever is 10 steps below lazy,
that's our crowd.
Oh, copy.
Oh, just cash the check.
You know,
Berkeley next time you come in
there, you nasty smelly bitch.
You just wait till you hear
the reception you're going to get for me.
In fact, when I'm down there,
very soon as a matter of fact,
I'll be there for a week doing some shows.
I just can't wait to see Berkeley again.
So I can go after right after
up and down the hallway
that machete we got sitting there.
Might as well get some use.
Man,
you have got some excuse
for not doing your job.
Okay, it's real easy when some
bogus agency,
and believe me,
like I've told you for years,
everybody in South Florida
has got their own agency.
Even Todd Drek's got an agency.
So instead of writing copy,
what they do is they take some
piece of paper that was sent to
facts to them or email to them by some
quote unquote agency.
And then they give it to us.
Here, make magic with this.
Wipe your ass with this.
Now, what you might as well.
And that's it.
And if you say, well,
after weeks and weeks and months and months,
how about some copy change?
How about something new and different
and exciting that might motivate
somebody to go out and subsidize our clients
and give them some business
and make it worth their effort
advertising on QAM?
Just take the check to the bank.
Just cast the check.
Ah, ah, ah.
Berkeley, you are the epitome
of what's wrong with WQAM.
You are as indifferent as the day is long.
You are a sad case, honey.
Let me tell you right now.
56705,
601, you know the rest.
WQAM, hello.
Hello, me, you.
Yes.
How you doing?
OK.
Are you ready for your poll?
Uh-huh.
How about James Woods?
Oh, god.
What a perfect choice.
That is outstanding.
Oh, god.
Man, what a zid head.
Sorry, thanks.
Thanks a lot, Charlie.
That's a good one.
James Woods, how are you?
We're gotten about that easily.
Why, why is that?
Because I can't stand it.
I know that, but that's one of the reasons
we should have thought about it,
because this is not a complimentary poll.
This is all over.
There's some of these people we like a lot.
They just happen to be ugly,
which some of us can't help that.
We just were born of ugly parents.
We had some bad genes.
Now, in my case, I had two ugly parents,
but the difference being, that's a both of them, 90 plus.
So on one hand, I might be around a long time,
although I doubt it.
I might be, but on the other hand,
I just, unfortunately, as soon as you learn
how to not care, you might be about what.
No, I really don't care about that.
Oh, I don't care about that.
I do just fine.
I fumble my way through life just fine.
Believe me, trust me.
Take my word for it.
In spite of it, which is a pretty miraculous.
But when you have a bubbling, effabricent personality,
like I don't, it just compensates for a lot of things.
Cats, shoots, owner, here's a great story.
Speaking even the cats are shooting it up now.
We had the two headed cat yesterday.
This is in Bates Township, Michigan.
I have no idea where it is, but I'm sure
I can only have it lived in Michigan for 12 years,
in Marshall and Albion and Detroit, and Sturgis.
Sturgis, Michigan, there's the place you want to avoid
at all costs.
They'll live, they got a great restaurant
with good clam chowder there.
Oh, man.
Don't you love good and winged clam chowder?
Yes, I do.
It's in a hotel, and I can't think of what it was.
Sturgis, Michigan, it's right across the Indiana border there.
I lived in Indiana.
How cheaply.
Oh, oh.
Bates Township, Michigan, a man cooking in his kitchen
was shot after one of his cats knocked his 9 millimeter
hand gone to the floor, discharging the weapon.
Michigan State Poli said, be where those Michigan State Poli's
man.
Joseph Stanton, 29 of Bates Township in Ireland County.
I have no idea where that is.
With shot in his lower torso, around 6 p.m. Tuesday,
the State Police Post-Iron River reported he was transported
to Ireland County Community Hospital.
Now, what was the beer that they used to advertise
on the pirate scams in Pittsburgh,
that big beer in Western Pennsylvania, Ireland?
Is that it?
Iron City?
Yeah.
Remember that?
No, you don't.
It's before you were born.
Bob Princeton, Jim Woods on the pirate scams.
Iron City, they advertise all the Pittsburgh go.
Anyway, that's big there.
How do you know that?
Well, I know the beer.
Oh.
Oh, you know your beer, Mr. Octavio.
He'd never drank no half gallons of mysterbrow
though like I did when I was a Michigan State.
Yeah, I'm actually a good guy.
That's the way to do it.
I used to love mysterbrow.
Not of the care.
Michelle Sand, no out of a big bottle, half gallons.
Michelle Sand, a spokeswoman at the Iron River Hospital,
said standing was treated there before being transferred
to Market General Hospital for further treatment.
But Marcie Miller, representative of the Market Facility,
said there was no record of the hospital receiving
a patient by that name.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So the catch, shot the guy, kind of like,
in a very bizarre way.
But I guess if a catch shoots you,
it would probably be in a bizarre way, wouldn't it?
Properly.
When you think, don't forget we got Moa Howard,
where David had to o'clock this afternoon.
Bella Legosi will be his guest at 245.
You're the sinks in, Neil Rogers.
Don't take a倒, Uncle.
Un-5-6, that's a new day.
Q-A-R.
This has been The O'Ronser, Michelle.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
That was your brain.
What?
Any question?
No.
All the world loves that cloud.
So this April Fool's game,
his radio station is going to make a fool out of you.
That's right.
We're going to turn you into a laughing star.
Just be the dead color when you hear this star.
And we'll yank your pants down around your ankles.
Tie your hands, but on your head,
paint a smiley face on your butt cheeks,
and lock you out of your house.
You'll be the center of attention in no time.
You remember they're not laughing at you.
They're laughing with you.
With you in your butt cheeks.
Employees of this radio station are not eligible to be made fools of,
since they've already done quite a good job making fools of themselves every day out here.
Employees who never the less wish to drop the fans in public
or encourage to do so after the investigation.
Be an April Fool!
People listening for your chance to win!
It's 11.01 at 5.60 W.D.C.
Don't tell me, oh, for a second,
I got scared with that website just to crap out for a half a second.
Here in the Nadea Springs says,
I realize the polls for your favorite actor that made it despite their looks.
I'm afraid these guys may not make the poll, I see.
Well, why not?
How can you say that?
All three of the people he's got listed here are people who are outstanding actors.
There's a lot of people I'm sure like them a lot.
Like Lee J. Cobb, I would change my voters matter factor by the way I could,
which I can't.
I love Lee J. Cobb.
He was a very craggie, ugly looking guy.
But he was a great, great actor.
Great.
Not good.
Great. Steve McQueen.
That was Steve McQueen, wasn't ugly.
No, he got old, but that happened to everybody.
No, but Steve McQueen was not ugly.
Jerry, you're a little off your feet.
And James Coveren.
That long, I see.
James Coveren wasn't ugly.
He was kind of a distinguished looking guy in his day.
But Lee J. Cobb is right.
He was a usually guy.
He was a very craggie face.
So one of those three ain't bad.
That's 333.
Even PD Rose didn't hit that.
Even little PD Rose.
Well, here's a fact that says, let's, let's, let's,
anyone forget if a more graphic example would be similarity of Brits and Germans.
Oh, yeah, Brits and the Nazis, same people.
It was the British that invented the cons.
And of course George Herbert Walker, our press god, Bush, that whole Bush family, Nazis.
It was the British who invented the concentration camp.
They would round up Afro-Conners during the Boer War.
If they turned it to the last century, they would gather the Boer fighters, families, the Africans,
and sympathizers and place them conveniently in one place.
The Germans, into a lesser extent, the US perfected this action during WWII.
Well, how do you like that?
In fact, I think it was an American show.
It was called concentration with Hugh Downs at our chain, see?
Later on.
Yeah, and the board goes back.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.
What are you sure making quite a detour?
One of the corporate quarter dives, who is now 2-10 Atlanta.
They are still searching for Brian Nichols.
They're still looking for them.
Oh, I thought they had them.
They're still looking for them.
Courthouse and 50-100 or so gathered here.
Well, just look for a tall, dangerous looking dark guy.
It would be real easy to find in Atlanta.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 in Weber-Ryzen.
Ever been to Atlanta?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Been through there.
Don't waste your time.
Never lingered.
Much to do about nothing.
Much to do about nothing.
W-D-Q-I-M, hello.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
I went one through pole.
I just did.
Going off.
Jimmy Duranty.
Think I think I do.
Oh, he was his argument.
His face could stop.
Or clock would stop.
Big Ben.
Thanks, Cal.
OK.
Jimmy Duranty.
Think I think I do.
I mean, yeah.
I want to have a check out that.
Yeah, I think I do.
That's what I want to stall around here with these themes.
I love it.
I love the themes, huh?
Sure.
I think everybody likes that.
Even this audience is very difficult to please.
Oh, yeah, this guy's here doing it.
Now, what I'm not doing it again, but...
Oh, don't tell me it's not on here.
The Jimmy Duranty show.
Here's the Dandy's Thomas show.
And the Ernie Kova show.
Dandy Thomas is real ugly, too.
But nobody knows who that is anymore.
But Jimmy Duranty, even though he was on a Sydney News ago,
I think pretty much everybody knows Jimmy Duranty.
Because who else would say,
Hank, could they do, right?
Bokobry.
Yeah, Bokobryon would say that.
Often does.
What's that one bit that he's got about Inki Dinky?
He does stuff that I don't know if anybody appreciates,
but he does stuff like, it's just amazing.
Like that last bit we were playing only moments before.
About Adam Noidoo.
Who else has got an abrupt mind to come up with something like that?
Oh, really?
Besides Delray Dan.
I mean, Bokobryon.
Hey, it was, thank God, we stole that from Apollo.
You know, with that idea of having some guy with a local nickname,
making up the bits.
Kind of like a J. America.
WQIM, hello.
Neil.
Yes, sir.
Great show, man.
Yes, it is.
I like it a lot.
Go ahead.
I got a couple people to add to the poll.
Go right ahead.
Take your time.
Don't be in a rush.
Mini driver?
Oh, Mini driver.
She could drive me crazy.
Jet Lee.
I don't know how he can ever,
I don't know how he can even be on a screen.
He's horrible.
He can't lose control.
And Donald Sutherland.
He's real, you believe you're right.
That's a good one.
As kids are, we're too key for you.
Keeper.
I don't like you the one.
Although I saw a key for Sutherland on a movie that was pretty good,
I just don't know what it was.
I talked about it a few weeks ago.
It was okay.
Did you get that movie yet?
That I just got through, Tony?
What about it?
What kind of movie?
I forgot already.
No.
You didn't get it?
What's that movie?
I was just talking about the other day.
With the Tom Baringer.
Am I going to have to go on the other movie?
The DVD.
During the break?
I see.
Oh, here's Kitty Carlyle.
Is that what's my line?
Yeah.
Oh, what's my line with John Charles Daily and Kitty Carlyle and Puppy Compo and Super Sale?
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, see?
It's one good thing about being old is you're, you know, the bad thing about it is that the
grim reaper is, the grim reaper is waiting any second to take your ass away and stick you
in that ugly box.
But the good thing is, you know, all of this crap that all these pumps don't know anything
about the only problem is that we don't want to know.
They just look at you and say, oh, geez, what an old, funny, dirty living in the past.
And of course, we don't really care because we realize how limited their life experience
is, even though they are getting a lot of action.
5, 6, 7, like Josh there, he doesn't know any of these people we're talking about.
You know Jimmy Duranty?
Not really.
I mean, would you recognize him on the screen if they put his nose on there and we're
the rest of them?
No.
Oh, see?
So you have no idea what that's all about.
Incadent, Incadent, Mrs. Calabash, could they wear whatever you are?
You know what that is.
Yeah.
Believe me, you missed nothing.
WDQAM, hello.
Hi, my name is Charlene from the Mad Dog Show.
What is that?
What is that?
WDQAM, hello.
I'm dying over here.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
That sounded like him, too.
It was that time.
I'm dying over here.
That was done.
All of the way.
All of the way.
I actually did die, so.
Yeah.
Otherwise, we might think it would be him.
I'm dying over here.
That was a very, very good imitation.
I would say, why not?
That was all right.
That was either the original's clone or was Al Pacino, one of the other.
Tell me to QAAM, hello.
Hi, Neil, how are you?
Pretty good.
That's good.
I just got back in the car.
Edward James, almost.
Oh, almost.
Enough to make me drive off the road.
Yes, I agree.
He's like a slightly darker James Woods.
Yeah.
And the second thing is, I meant to call you back in the game this February.
We were in Toronto and we were at Eton Center and on Young Street, and I was thinking
about you, and I just never could arrange it because we were up there for job interviews.
Right.
Never could arrange one.
Say that one more time.
I missed it.
You said you never could arrange it.
It arranged one.
Well, I couldn't reach you because our interviews were going on the same time the show was going.
Right.
And so I couldn't take time out from the interviews to get a job.
I love you.
You're very important, but the jobs were more important.
I had no question about it.
And we are out of here, out of South Florida on, I think it's August, the third July 15th.
And we're not coming back.
Where are you going?
You're going to run a guy on the yard.
You know that.
What?
We're teachers, and we're going to Alexandria, Egypt for two years, and then we're headed to Europe.
So what's wrong?
Why would I laugh at you with that?
I don't know.
Every time I say Egypt, people face this fall.
Well, they go.
There's some kind of a pyramid scheme if you say that.
Well, this is true.
And we won't be seeing the pyramids, but it won't be a scam.
It will be legit, and they're giving us housing.
It's a great deal.
A great opportunity to be in Europe.
And we're going to be in Europe.
And we're thinking about, um,
anyone of the former communists countries, Budapest, Prague,
um, eventually hitting Italy to teach,
and then we're probably going to wind up in either
Prince Edward Island or Toronto to live for good.
All right.
Excellent.
Choices all the way around.
Good luck, eh?
You too.
Take care, Neil.
All right.
All right.
There's a lady with her head on straight.
I can't believe it.
That sounded very inviting, you know.
It's probably in Budapest.
You know, they're very close together, and as a matter of fact, next year,
that's in my itinerary.
One of my big European vacations, if I leave that long,
if I'm still around, if I don't succumb to the Greg Reed disease,
I'm definitely a hit in Prague and Budapest.
Budapest is becoming like a wild hysterical, uh,
kind of like Amsterdam, like city.
You know that?
Well, I'm close to share you once you move the shackles
from some of those people, they just go,
ah, I don't know.
You know, like that.
I'm like South Florida, but they just, you know,
they just something in the air, man.
Like a ThunderClaft Newman said, there's something in the air.
It's those old folks and the old Jews and the old Cubans.
They don't want you to enjoy your life.
They want you to be as miserable as they are.
Full of hate and despair and it's just, uh,
it's an unfortunate thing because there are a lot of nice people there,
but they generally like this lady.
She was a sweetheart and she's getting out.
When in doubt, get the hell out.
Oh!
Yeah, that's our motto if you're at South Florida.
When in doubt, get out.
Before it's too late, before you become one of them,
like, uh, speaking of Donald Sutherland,
like the body snatchers, you can be king one of them.
You have to end the movie.
That's my favorite.
That's been on the lot, Leigh.
I have no idea why on Scream TV.
I wonder what's on Scream TV right now.
I don't know.
Check it out.
The day Mars and the day Mars invaded Earth.
I'm guessing that.
Who's the one?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Well, what about you at this movie?
It's a war United jet.
1962, just L.A.X., all the palm trees, anyway.
There's little something for you.
Here on the Dragon Movie Channel, here's Vengeance.
It's going bird-holland and tiger jaw-march.
I wonder if he was skinned at Joe Mars Jr., you think?
Hope.
I just love all these channels on my digital cable,
but I don't want to get into that, because that'll get somebody we know very upset, probably Todd Dreck,
and we wouldn't want to get him upset.
Now, what thought was the end of the movie with Tom Barronjure again?
Please.
I don't know.
You never felt it.
Well, I don't want to forget it.
I just got through watching it a couple days ago.
It was very good.
It was about the guy that has the car accident, he loses his memory,
and, um, all these twists and turns, and the tries to figure out what it's all about,
and his wife, well, I don't want to say the ending.
It's worth seeing.
During the break, I go and check it out for you.
Anywhere I pull today, your favorite actor or actress who made it big in spite of being ugly,
and there are a lot of, uh, now that we're making this list,
you come to realize there are tons of these guys.
So you used to be the idea that, well, unless you're a real sex pot,
unless you were a real hot looking babe, or some really classy looking guy,
like Carrie Grant, you know, or Marlon Brando.
He had no chance.
But guess what?
So far Charles Robinson 89, Steve Bushimi's moving into a second-place style with Humphrey Bullock,
and the Bullguards 64, and of course, the AIDS factor there,
so he will help Steve out a lot.
Right.
Because who the hell knows Humphrey Bullguards?
And the fact that old Fargo was on again last night.
Was it really?
Yeah, I watched it again.
Oh, huh.
It was on what?
Uh, Showtime HBO Cinemax, one of those.
Huh.
He ended the same way.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, he's a little guy, kind of funny.
Oh, he's just all in the world with him for that.
Oh, let's see.
He's going to be the 036.
Barbara Streisand 25.
Kathy Bates and James Kegney 14.
Same person.
Ed Asner 14.
Dick Van Dyke 11.
I'll just do the double digits.
And Betty Miller's got 10.
Ugly people who made a pig.
So it goes to show you, because most of you let's face it.
Most of us are either ugly or like, you know, fairly non-discreet.
Like George is like, non-discreet.
Right.
Like, he don't look good.
He don't look bad.
He's just, uh, he's just there, kiddo.
Which, a lot of people in the building are too happy.
Yeah, you're generic, a generic human being.
Now, Josh's case, he used to look good until he got in that picture on a website.
And I was starting to look a little bit up into the shovel.
It's probably this show did it to him.
He used to look a little bit better.
Not great, but, you know, I've been stressed since I've been on the show.
Now, the stress from that place will absolutely do.
In fact, by the end of this year, you'll probably look like Gabby Hayes.
Look at that.
It seems a meal, Rogers.
The rest of us are going to be in 566.
QAM.
So, you did.
I've been just new government.
I've been just new government.
I've been always in time.
What?
What's the exact same thing, Josh?
Sure, right, I'm just mine.
Yeah.
So, we chaos over there.
So, we want to turn your hand.
I don't want to hear from Josh.
That is restoring things.
How will we know what to see?
With that boot in my proceed.
I guess we're knowing to see that.
When you see more Mickey D's, make it out.
You are to be happy and to be feeling carefree because President Saddam Hussein has defeated the
Infidel Clinton under Satanic America, causing great embarrassment to the Colitis.
And, inflicting great pain on our enemies during the recent UN inspections, then the...
This is why, my fellow Raki citizens, I've dealt my troubles just to be celebrating most
renewsly this weekend.
Yes, yes, automatic weapons have to be fired into the air without regard for human safety.
As you enter the by-diad McDonald, bring what remains of your family to be meeting Ronald Mokramed.
Do not be forgetting that, no, today, I have to be chopping up the hand of the hand-regard.
You are to be sending the proof of your loyalty to play in the kitty bunker.
As you choose, Ramemos, pending menu that includes big nights with secrets, scudsocks,
dishmate, poems and rituals.
Waterfounder with views, not to be forgetting our famous lies.
Yes, my fellow Raki citizens, we have to be celebrating our wondrous leaders of the
Musins victory over the sole espons of the United Nations.
And keep this weekend at the by-time McDonald's.
A portion of poetry can be given to our great leader, Saddam Hussein's most secretive research
and program to be building weapons of past destruction.
Love an 18 and 560 WDQM.
See, I knew the name of the movie began with an SH, the Tom Veringer flick.
Okay, shattered.
But I don't want to say it.
Yeah, shattered, very good.
I'll try to give you any few more letters I might have helped to.
Here's a fact that's got three very good choices for the poll.
I say a three for three on this one.
Dustin Hoffman, I mean, Ugly doesn't even begin to, you know, in Rainman, he didn't have to
like no makeup, you know what I mean?
Now, what Dustin Hoffman, it's not a shot, but it's just that he's a very ugly guy.
I got to know is it's like not only gigantic and strange, but like off our most people's cheek is, you know.
Did you ever see marathon then?
A hundred years ago, yeah.
Okay, why?
Oh, because it was good that we have a drop.
And what's that?
Boy, I thought you were going to play that other one.
Get the shot!
Oh, yeah, well, we can't play too much of that.
You fairy.
Anyway, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Allen, boy, Ugly doesn't, you know something, Ugly is an understatement.
I mean, just I don't know what word to use and describe the looks of that thing.
He makes me look lovely.
And Abe Vagoda, who as much as we love Abe Vagoda, he's still alive, right?
Yes.
But he was probably an ugly baby.
And despite what some people say, there are, I think most babies are ugly to be honest with him.
I mean, most people, oh, poochie poochie, but if you look at most babies, they're formed.
Right.
They haven't formed any like facial features, or they're just ugly and they smell bad.
But anyway, Ab Vagoda will put on there.
We can't get him off the hook even for all time.
Sorry, fish.
And of course, he sleeps with the fishes now.
Here's a Fauge.
He Rogers says, hey, to be a chronic.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
And how come I played that one and we never even got, I never thought about it.
Boy, are we slower?
What? All of us? All three of us.
I played Marty Feldman eyes.
Right.
And we never played Marty Feldman.
We played Marty Feldman while it was, Marty Feldman where he makes Woody Allen look like a Brad Pitt.
I mean, good God.
Marty Feldman.
Gene Wilder.
And we like Gene Wilder a lot too.
That's a good one.
And Wood Allen says, uh, Gene Rogers.
Can't say Wood no more on the ear.
He says, remember us, chronics are always listening.
And that's the problem, Gene.
Just like, I wish you would have told me that was Casino Stan.
The first moment you heard his voice.
He figured that, um, and I did know it was in the first moment.
Oh, Josh.
I said, watch Neil go nuts as soon as he figures it out.
Oh.
And then he was, he'd want to say that he'd called on his show too.
Oh, no.
And I hope Hank gave him the same warm reception that I did once he knew who it was.
I mean, just go away.
I mean, talk about a one-dimensional person.
It's just driven obsessed.
We don't need your help.
We don't need your interference.
They find Brotherhooder a popular parker doing just fine without your asses and so, okay?
With your craggie, uh, hands.
His soap dish hands.
That's the one thing I remember about him.
Something about his skin like he was like on the invasion from Mars ship.
Wow, leathery.
You're out of this world saying he's like his whole body is his leathery as PD Lenny's face.
Steve says, one for your pool, Richard Keel.
Uh, the character draws from the Bond films.
I don't think it a powered Keel from Shobot.
Richard Keel is that guy?
Yeah, he's a tall guy.
Oh, really?
I'm picking a Richard Kyrman, really ugly.
Another faithful internet listener, Steve, who doesn't tell us where he is.
Hey, Steve would be nice to know where to how you were Steve, but he didn't bother Thomas.
Well, maybe he'll fact back or maybe not.
See, I like that when they tell us where they are.
I'm not saying it makes all that much difference, but it makes you feel like you're reaching your tentacles and testicles out a little bit.
You know, like, oh, yeah.
Look at that.
Somebody over there in Chattanooga's listed.
Somebody up there in Portland, Maine.
Somebody in Portland, Oregon.
Somebody in Ipsilanti.
Somebody in the two-egg.
That'd be great.
I think we need to take out a half-page ad in USA today and get a lot more people on our website, a lot more people listening online.
Just stir the pod a little bit, just aggravate a bunch of people, right?
I'm not going to make the same amount of money, just to aggravate some people.
Oh, my God.
We got somebody on the end listening in Topeka, you know, like that, or Cordillane Idaho.
Yeah, that'd be good.
Or like in Bay City.
But if I go to Bay City, what do you say, Cordon?
What?
I'll go to Cordillane with a sandwich board.
I've always thought, there you go.
That lady sounded like she had a pretty good itinerary.
I could have skipped the Egypt part, but after that, Deputy QAAM, hello.
Oh, speaking of the hatred.
We are, Deputy QAAM, hello.
Yeah, you know, what's the name of the place, Canada?
Oh, yeah, William Conrad.
You got it.
Good choice.
Thank you.
I love William Conrad, but he sure was ugly, fat and ugly.
Whatever, I'm even must-action.
Right.
Good.
You know, I'll tell you one thing.
It's always, she reverend Jones and some of you other idiots out there,
which, you know, there's four or five who need to be put in an open immediately, if not sooner.
It's always really good.
Ah, the starlight probably, you know, like that.
Ah, yeah.
That's always just a little bit of a tip off, even a moron sitting here, which I often am.
Uh, you know, it's just, it's so, there are no words to describe it.
Just wasting space, wasting oxygen that some worthwhile creature could be inhaling,
could be living a feeding off of.
Wow.
So real good.
And by the way, anybody who is listening on the net, uh, wherever you are around the country, around the world,
just, just kiss the ground wherever you are that you're not in Florida.
Kiss it, kiss it right now.
Like Bill Clinton would say, kiss it.
WDQA and hello.
What's up?
Yes, sir.
How you doing?
Pretty good, Neil.
How about Christopher Walken?
Oh, God.
Yeah.
He must have been going to my walking closet and never come out.
Thanks a lot, Kyle.
Excellent.
All right.
You too, buddy.
See, Christopher Walken, man, he is gruesome.
Grotesque.
So many ugly people in so little time, makes us feel better all the rest of his ugly people.
I mean, look at all these grotesque people and I guarantee you, if they had the choice,
because he, all these ugly stars, these celebrities, just because they're ugly, they're not getting a lot, you know?
Because they're celebrities, they're superstars, you know?
So therefore, they're getting all kinds of action.
And as opposed to some real good-looking people, who, number one, don't even realize that they look good in number two,
they couldn't get laid in the French Courthouse.
I've never been able to figure that out.
Because every now and then, you'll see somebody who'll think, boy, they could have anybody in the world they wanted, you know?
Anything, anything that moves, even things that are stationary like light up, light poles and trees and fire hydrants.
But come to fight out that they just don't realize that.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, no confidence.
Well, here we go.
What do we got?
What?
It's good, good for us, the rest of us.
Oh, and I absolutely correct.
That is right.
You, I've got your thumb right on that, baby.
Now, let's see, the Courthouse shooting three dead now in one wounded.
But who is in the lab is doing fine, hopefully to get out of hospital.
Josh, for the border and deputy, he killed another deputy shot at the Courthouse.
He's still alive, but how long that will remain now?
Yeah, we don't know.
Maybe we could take some of the oxygen that they're wasting up there, Reverend Jones and his boyfriend, and shift it up there to Atlanta.
Maybe they could live off of that for a while.
Very, very sad.
The space that these Creetans are taking up.
93 say Charles Bronson.
He's going to be tough to catch, although Steve was shooting, he's moving into a respectable second with 71.
Humphrey Boehme, 67, Dating DeVito, 42, Barbara Streisand, 28, Kathy Bates, 15, Jimmy Kagnie, 14, Ed Asner, 14, Dick Van Dyke, has got 11.
I don't think he do all that well.

Many Davis, 7, Belala, Goesey, 7.
Clint Howard, 5, Fred Quinn, 5, Rhea Pearlman, 5.

Down in Sutherland, Jimmy Duranty, Lee J. Cobb, I've got the big.
Oh!
Because do you think this audience knows who Lee J. Cobb is?
No.
They didn't see the exorcist?
Yeah, but they don't know him by day.
It was his name, Captain Morton.
No, seriously, what was his name in the movie?
He's had a name.
I don't know, Mother Police Detective.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
I forget it.
No.
28 past 11, we got Moa 2 this afternoon.
He's going to Christopher Walkendon will be most guest of 315.
You're the team's a unique, old, new Roger.
It's Friday, you bastard.
It's late at night.
You're off to sleep, and I shadowy figure as about to break into your home.
But you're protected.
Yeah, it's the James Brown home security alarm.
Oh, yeah!
The hall is working alarm in the safety business.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Designed by the Godfather of home protection himself.
The James Brown alarm protects you from burglar, hit bandos, hit beeping dogs.
And if you act now, we'll include it no extra cause.
The patented James Brown hot pants far along.
So but the sole patrol on your keyhole.
With a James Brown home security system.
Oh, yeah!
You'll save me!
I'll be a good!
It's 11.32 at 5.60 WQAM.
Morgan Freeman, somebody faxed, says his butt ass ugly.
Uh, ugly?
Uh, whatever.
Yeah.
What?
I mean, he's ugly, but he like, you know.
And Willem Dafoe looks like a gargoyle.
Yeah, he does.
I certainly go along with that.
He does definitely do.
Now here's the faxes that restate in the obvious.
We promoted all day yesterday that Moe was going to have Bruce Willis on a 2.30
because Moe's daughter works for Mirror Max and they were plugging the new Bruce Willis movie.
And Yadi, Yadi, Yadi.
So here's the fax that says,
Hey, Neon, I don't know if you heard, but the Moe man had Bruce Willis on his show yesterday.
No, he didn't hear that.
Said he was sucking his ass pretty good.
I guess J. Feetler got jealous, so Moe's going to have him on today.
Kiss his ass.
PSD County blows.
Restate in the obvious.
All of those things were a well aware of, okay?
And Ju Feetler is going to be on with the Moe this afternoon who's going.
The most favorite football team to jets.
I guess Moe can finally admit that now.
Another day he's not going to be doing the dolphins no Moe.
And the man got it.
Yeah.
Steve says, I live in one of your favorite cities.
Nashville, Tennessee.
He had a great weekend.
And you too, Steve, if it's possible a little bit of Nashville.
You got a lot of Nashville.
Oh man.
Talk about in bread, man.
It is breast 5-10.
I got a good column here by our good friend, my good friend.
You don't like Capitol Hill blue, but I do a lot.
It's good website.
I was saying that I have no idea why I'm not how that started, but I don't know either.
Doug Thompson, the rant, he's the publisher and founder of Capitol Hill Blue,
which is a fine website.
They don't like Democrats.
They don't like Republicans.
They just basically don't like Crooks.
Right.
And they don't care who's a big guy as they go.
He writes, Prood's Paradise.
Hallelujah.
Children in 61,000 elementary schools around the US saw the new.
We are family animated video cartoon Thursday.
And the world as we know it did not come to an end.
No report surface of six and seven year olds coming home Thursday night.
And telling their parents they were gay or denouncing heterosexual lifestyles.
As predicted by James Dobson, the head of the homophobic focus on the family foundation.
In fact, the animated music video that included SpongeBob and many cartoon characters from
the kids did not refer in sexuality at all, even though Dobson,
another homophobic right winged up case group.
The American Family Foundation claimed it would in thousands of span emails to
journalistic organizations around the world.
When reporters who actually had watched the video asked the American Family Foundation about their
unfounded claims, the group backtracked an issue to news statement.
While the video itself does not overtly promote homosexuality, it serves as a hook to entice children and teachers
to use the website and the materials there, such as a teacher lesson plan,
which explicitly promote the homosexual lifestyle.
For a Schmidt, I watched the video produced by the We Are Family Foundation in partnership with the anti-diffimation league,
and it doesn't or so other organizations.
It was a cute little music video using the old disco song We Are Family to say people should learn to get along and live together.
Nothing more, nothing less.
But the Emperor is all too typical of the fear-mongering ignoramances of control our government and the political agenda in this country and rely on the ignorant
louts who followed him.
Earlier this year, education secretary Margaret Spellings, another tight-ass, puritanical, Bible thumping appointee from homophobic prison George W. Bush,
forced the public broadcasting service to the Anken episode of its animated series, postcards from Buster,
because the lead character Buster the Rabbit visited a same-sex couple in Vermont.
Many parents would not want their young children exposed to the lifestyles for trading this episode Spellings wrote,
in the letter of the President of PBS, the network which depends on government funding to survive, caved in, and pulled the episode of course.
Sutscensorship and repression is business as usual for the Bush administration's jack booted approach to anything it deems, immoral, illegal or fattening.
The Republican Party that controls the White House in Congress is overrun with homophobes, racists, bigots and prudes,
so sexually repressed they couldn't get laid in a warehouse if somebody else paid in advance, which is probably because most horrors wouldn't screw such low-life for any amount of money.
The repression reminds me of a line from George Carlin, ever noticed that a woman who's opposed to abortion if somebody wouldn't want to f anyway?
These people are a blight that threatens any chance of an enlightened society, scabs of repression that must be picked if we were to have any chance for survival and progress.
In a perfect right-wing world, Gays would be committed to mental institutions, blacks would be sent back to Africa, books and movies would be subject to review and censorship before release, and every woman would be a virgin before marriage, and that marriage of course could only be to a man.
They fantasize about conspiracies from all directions, the media, Hollywood, teachers, even within their own ranks, everyone they feel is ought to get them.
Such paranoia is often found among control-free and repressive types who feel they must force everyone else to fall into lockstep compliance with their own narrow views.
It's not all that different from repression-fraud in fundamentalist Islamic societies, communism or Nazi Germany.
The conservative fruit takes our correct about one thing. There is a massive threat to the future of this country.
It's a spreading disease that threatens to devour everything that was once good about this nation, a rotting cancer that eats it the flesh of the body of the politic, and may well turn America into a putrid decaying corpse of a country.
The threat is real, the threat is serious, and the threat comes from themselves. The treason is right-wing demigods who have taken over our government.
But he's good, you know? Damn good. Even though I hate him.
He couldn't get laid in a French horror house if somebody else paid an advance. Kind of like Robert Creeper. Oh, sorry.
Oh, here's a good one, and just recently passed to the other side, up there with Johnny. Here is Rodney. Rodney Dangerfield.
Bug-eyed Rodney. Well, they don't come to me. I'm really then Rodney. Carol Conner.
I guess one was the ever not ugly. Now, okay, Carol Conner. Eat this bunker. I think she's got a name.
What is her name? Gene Stable. Gene Stable and right. I wouldn't have thought of that for some reason. No, my brain is a little...
You know, not a shattered. My brain is shattered. No, she's not done. The script gene stable is a great actress. But she's not ugly.
Oh, the guy who played Norton on the honeymoon is art carning. But this guy's all over the place.
It's got some good suggestions here. Your favorite actor actress, then it says Bush. Why is an actor? All right. Either one. Bad actor, but not for the poll.
The Wikens. I know you're a big Wikens fan. You know what? Bad news. Uh oh. The Wikens can't have a sales tax exemption in Florida because unlike other religious groups,
they don't have a permanent meeting place in a Pills Court has ruled. The Wikens religious co-op of Florida sued the Florida Department of Revenue on Halloween 2000. On Halloween, no less, I guess that's appropriate.
Arguing that it was wrongly denied a tax exemption. The Orlando-based Wikens group wanted an exemption to sell religious items and publications without having a chart sales tax like other churches.
It was originally denied by the Department of Revenue because it didn't have a physical place of worship, love the qualifications for the exemption.
A three judge panel of the first district court of appeals upheld the ruling this week in favor of the state in a twist. The appeals panel ruled the Wikens can't legally pursue the case because it's a religious group and will benefit from a tax exemption.
The ruling raises questions for other religious groups. A judge Robert T. Benton, a second who descended in part. Does this mean a synagogue cannot question the legality of using public money for a crash in the courthouse if a star David didn't install. He wrote the majority opinion discriminates against organizations because the religious.
This is not in keeping with our traditions. They said a revenue department spokesman said the agency was pleased the court resolved the case.
Atturning Heather Morecrops said the group is considering whether the Wasty appeals court to reconsider or appear to be Florida Supreme Court. Wikens follow an earth-based belief system or religion according to the Wikens websites. They generally consider themselves to be witches.
They co-op had about 250 members statewide in 2000. And every time we do one of those religious bulls, we got a bunch of Wikens out there and it's not even a Saturday.
I don't know which one we like the best but they're out there. That one. We like that one the best. And that one we have a fair for passions we like who are the best.
And yes, what's his name? He was the father. What is his name? What's his name? Whatever's his name? The kid? No, that's precious. 20 till noon if you better get with your passions at trivia man because you sure know no crap.

16.00 a.m. Under the best case scenario, slot machines in Broward County would likely raise about 300 million for public schools across the state.
The legislature's chief economist sold a house committee yesterday.
It's been a course of day would have passed. Then that 500 million they were talking about just do the math. It comes right out to that.
And the best case. But that number could fluctuate wildly depending on how high a tax legislator's slap on a machine.
How many slots are allowed in each of Broward's four-payer mutuals? When slots can operate? How many betters will flock to them? And what type of machines are allowed?
The E300 million dollar estimate about half of what have been anticipated slots are approved by both state and Broward is based on a 50% tax on 1700 machines at Gulf Stream Park.
Colleague would be around. Poppano harness and Daniel Highlight. Poppano however is already suggested installing up to 3000 machines. Sounds good to me.
How right?
Completely by 5 or 6 for me. Amy Baker from the economic arm of the legislature told members of the House Business Regulation Committee that while it might sound attractive to put high taxes on the machines, there comes a point of diminishing returns.
Go over 50% she warned and some of the venues could find themselves in bankruptcy or just deciding not to participate to lay out.
And despite all the campaigning allowed to vote slice November and July's Tuesday, Governor Jeff Bush and some House leaders only started suggesting Wednesday, only the day after it passed is another way to try to subvert the will of the electorate, that the state may want to redefine slots as past two machines, those Aresatz Mickey Mouse machines currently used in travel casinos.
Video lottery terminals with that bingo thing which of course are playing bingo, not real slot machines.
You can't suddenly call an alligator or lizard said Jim Horne, former state education commissioner has been the chief spokesman for the pro slots campaign.
Our side was always very clear on what it means.
The worst twice this week has said he doesn't think anything in the constitutional amendment passed by voters last November prohibits the state from limiting Florida slots only to the lower classification of machine.
Whether that happens or not remains to be seen he said yesterday, my position is that here's the best.
Here comes the best part from your fat ass governor. I'm going to underline this and I'm going to frame it. I'm going to staple it to my ass.
My position is that I'm against gambling in all forms, but I'm going to let the legislative process work.
Yeah, right.
Now this nasty rotten fat ass son of a bitch, he's against gambling in all forms. This is the lottery head.
This is the Catholic who I'm sure is very much in favor of church bingo, the board again Catholic.
And all of the studies against gambling in all forms, meaning we've got to shut down all the tracks, all the paramutuals, the seminoles of course.
We've got to like how about another war against the Indians? What do you say? Take away their boson arrows. They never deserve to be safe.
What a pile of crap speculation is growing that Bush was stone walled Florida's Indian tribes and their attempt to establish a gaming compact with a state is hoping to stay
while full fledged casinos on the state seminoles and mika suki reservations by limiting what the Indians can offer.
But assistant attorney general John Glogueau told a house committee earlier this year that a slot machine is defined as a class three machine, a real machine like the ones in Vegas and the ones in Atlantic City and the ones that would bind and the ones that afford area and the ones they're here and there.
He suggested that state approval of the concerts, remember that a lot for two day slot referendums gives the green life for Indian casinos to seek Las Vegas style slot machines.
Either Glogueau or attorney general Charlie Christ, Yay! Christ is expected to appear before the House Business Regulation Committee next week to answer questions about classification.
Oh, brother. Just unbelievable. And the worst part of it is that nobody gives a flying crap, okay? That's why Florida is in the condition that it's in right now, at least South Florida. That's why people are keeping schlepping to Orlando there to see Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and the same swirly been peddling for years up there. God.
You can't complain about the tourists in South Florida because other than the French Canadians, the frogs who are coming back because that Canadian dollar and not so much the Canadian dollar is strong.
The American dollar has dropped and by the way, thanks for those low gas prices, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you.
The euro is almost 135. I'm looking at it right now on report on business on my cable TV 135 whoever hurt a section.

and of course the right wingers they blew him off the air they shoved him out
it was really a tempest in a pee pot and the essence of the story like Doug
Tarzan wrote yesterday was absolutely correct but they don't confuse the
public or the mainstream media with the facts you didn't check it thoroughly
advanced that behind it he's got to take the fall and of course it been a lot of
people trying to shove his ass out of there for a long time but when Bob Sheeper
at the end of the newscast went through that song and advance about well you
know Dan Radder was legendary and Walter Cronkite and you know me because I've
been around for years yeah you've been around for years you old troll even at
public you won't find bags bigger than ones under his eyes you know what's that

long as they keep his ass on there you won't be able to it's kind of like
ours in this last train you can't complain about them because we don't have it

indicate ten o'clock tonight that's our schedule we don't have you in the
basketball because guess what well we don't want to rub it in doing did they lose
Josh they did they lost well Tom fax is in says the reason that all the green
tooth Cuban voted against the slots is because it did not include highly
a racetrack I was talking about that with the hopper this morning time also there
was nothing else on a ballot in two years I hope they also include
hialia on about and have the vote on the day with other stuff on a ballot
even if it's for dog catcher there you go and of course if it's for dog catcher
we have a lot of our alphoresis and martinis and Rodriguez and Gonzalez is
on there then some people come out and vote but probably the wrong ones but
anyway that's a good point I don't understand why they didn't that would have
like evened out for a per mutual facilities in each
can't wait what's wrong with me well the only problem is highly is not operating
now and I guess they would have to like started all up all over again and there
is no horse racing there so I don't know but it's really unfortunate because I
think that would have made a big difference I think if they if Brunetti
wouldn't have destroyed it they could have kept that thing going a little bit
longer that could have brought that place back to life right who needs the
horses if you got the slots well no but you can but you can't well I don't know
I guess they would have a cymo casting there right of course that food was
sure good there last year too man you talk about the green weeny oh here's the

when we did all these themes but I'm not I'm not gonna waste no more time but he
definitely qualifies he was a really ugly guy he's not a lot of shows 5 6
7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the Verizon and singular wireless lines we're looking

all right go ahead oh listen I'm trying try to let him finish but he was just
happy not to what do you say Carl I'm Alden right towards my god
George he Scott very humongous I mean but many people tell you he's the
greatest actor of all time I don't agree with that but he's a good actor did
all right it was good in the hospital uh-huh patent uh taps fire starter right
he's good very bad though in excesses three wasn't that what which one of those
was he it was the one of those right one of those horrible remakes that never
should have been remade I mean excesses two was bad enough with Richard
Burton I believe his actresses two and then I think George he's got oh god see
when you get to the end of the line and you can't get any other real scripts
then you might have been a crap like that five six seven oh five sixty pound five
sixty on the Verizon and singular wireless lines here's a story that I
absolutely love it fits right in with my feeling about the state of Florida
Florida's legislature is flush with good ideas senator Al Lawson's idea involves
a two cent parole tax on toilet paper to pay for wastewater treatment to help
small towns upgrade their sewer systems and when you're in a state that's as
full of it as Florida man they'll be raising a Schmidt load of cash wouldn't you
think you think the Democratic lawmakers pay as you go bill pay as you go bill
that's gonna be our our has been the source of many jokes bathroom human might say
but he says the issue is a serious one it's a serious tissue especially in some
of the fast growing panhandle coastal counties in his district they're
experiencing a tremendous boom in growth and not a cable to not able to
come at it the growth is a a Richard boom we've got 17 million people in
a state all of them can contribute to protecting our underground water supply
unless of course they don't do that thing unless of course they put it in a box
there by the sort of the by the side of the
toilet and just keep using it over and over again like the aboil us and
the Republican-dominated legislature that doesn't like new taxes the idea is
likely to pretty quickly end up in the tank said at president Tom Lee we're
public in a brand and said he didn't think it would get too far but didn't rule
it out we're getting to the bottom of a real soon we said
the house is skeptical as well we're not wild about tax increases in house
speaker Alan Benson panel on city but will certainly let it go through the
system if it were to pass the extra two pennies would start being charged in
October lost and said it could generate $50 million a year it would also need
approval from governor Jeb Bush he said that if toilet paper is taxed people might
use less of it oh no that's not necessarily a good thing no to the
finance governor if toilet paper is taxed people might use less of it
fewer than eight the squares remember that story yeah eight squares
you can even begin what about consumers it says wouldn't they be squeezed by
a tax on the shaman no says loss in two senses not going to her families at
all this is one thing people don't mind paying for i mean seriously how many
rolls of toilet paper even could a big family use a month i mean not
third made it and not even that like ten yeah ten rolls a month what do you say
i don't care sure it says it's like 20 cents a month for crying out loud for
Jesus Christ and Mary's sake yeah how do you like so Mel Gibson's releasing a
different version of the passion of the Christ because now we can get different
hundreds of millions of dollars in there because Jesus is a what the probably the best
money maker in history when they think that this one ends differently oh it's
different ending huh yeah he lives at the end he jumps right off that cross that
happens running back at you says here you go on your bastard Jew bastards and Romans and whatever
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty yeah that Trish van der Verde that was the end of
it for me with uh George C Scott what's he married her which you couldn't act

bankruptcy legislation the senate yesterday passed legislation that will make it harder for
americans to rid themselves of debt by filing for bankruptcy the house is expected to pass the
measure next month delivering to L president a second victory this year on pro-business
legislation he had sought the vote was 74 to 25 to approve the most thorough overall of
bankruptcy laws in the quarter of a century the short answer is fairness to clear declared
senator or in stats of Utah those who can pay their bills should pay their bills that's the
american fn ways congressional industry backers of legislation been pushing it for eight years
but it repeatedly got stalled this year with republican majorities increased in both the house and
senate the bills fortunes reversed the senate insisted uh... uh... uh... on handing wall street
investment firms of bonus defeating a democratic amendment that would have restricted their ability
to work for companies both before and after those companies filed for bankruptcy senators acted
against the advice of the s.e.c. chairman William Donaldson who said such a restriction was
needed to build up investor confidence shaken by n-round world-com and other corporate scandals
for two straight days democratic opponents tried to soften a bills impact on single parents and
other groups and a restrict credit industry practices that lawmakers said especially hurt the poor
critics said the bill would remove a safety net for those of lost their jobs are faced big medical

yesterday that the state social services agency cannot relate the removal of the feeding tube but
keeping brain damage Terry Shive will I we're gonna take that tube and stick it in Florida's
back home have a statewide enema is what we're gonna do desperately long overdue the department
and children and families had asked for a 68 delay and they removed the feeding tube now
skids with from arts 18 which is a week from today but wouldn't that be a second we can have like
a live playback play you're not going to be here next Friday correct you're on vacation next
Friday well maybe you come in special if we have like a live broadcast a telecast of the removal
of the tube the agency said a lot of time to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect by the
woman's husband Michael Shiveau but circuit judge George W. Greer who's obviously Kinder Rosy
Greer and Mike Greer who's one of Josh's favorite hockey players ruled that the agencies attempt
to get involved at this point was inappropriate and appears to be brought for the purpose of
circumventing the court's final judgment and violation of the separation of powers doctrine you
following that I thought it Michael Shiveau's attorney had criticized the last minute attempt by
DC have to get involved saying that it was engineered by our fat ass governor Jeb Bush and I'm
telling you man he's he's got his nose in everywhere it doesn't belong instead of being up there
until I have to take care of business he's all over the place he's taking care of business it was
engineered by governor Jeb Bush our fat ass governor and others in the state government
to support the plight of her parents who are trying to keep her alive Michael Shiveau's gotten a
court order to remove the feeding tube containing that his wife told him she wouldn't want to be kept
alive artificially and we all the rest we know she breeds on her own but often depends but she
depends on a tube in her abdomen for food and water but her parents doubt she had those end of
life wishes and are desperately trying to block removal of the feeding tube the judges ruling
was another major blow to Bob and Mary Schindler thank goodness who fought their son-in-law in
court for nearly seven years over their daughters freight they dispute that she's in a persistent
vegetative state saying she laughs cries interacts with them and tries to speak when they visit
at her hospice she's just a and not only that but a ball of a laugh at a party in fact when you
think so oh I'm sure if you brought her to a part maybe on the floor
oh
once there was this key
and oh

didn't need finally case back

aided by his close personal friend and assistant Berkeley
the answer you have to send her out to berkville they probably kick her ass out right away
man she is just a real piece I said this story to right now because I wanted to wait till
the like the middle of the show okay you want you want to find out exactly what's going on
all these good honest pious people in America the group of organizations have asked the FCC
for a complete freeze of all low power FM applications now you know these low power FM's
that they came up with to try to give like local communities like better local coverage
center and so college stations high school stations they've asked the FCC for a complete freeze of
all low power FM applications because they discovered evidence of a massive trafficking scheme
involving translator licenses to religious organizations included in the group asking for
freeze on granting licenses are Prometheus Radio Project in Philadelphia United Church of Christ
National Federation of Community Broadcasters future music coalition free press and national
lawyers guild among others in a filing the group accuses three individuals Clark Perish
Earl Williamson and Dana Atkin of using two dummy corporations to apply for over 4,000
translator licenses and then using loopholes to sell the licenses to religious broadcasters
who in turn type in satellite programming which is an obvious contradiction of the spirit of
localism beyond the granting of LP FM low power FM licenses the two companies in question are
radio assist ministry and edgewater broadcasting a third company world radio link was also named
in the filing and led to be a dummy company used to aggressively market the naked construction
permits the filing details the sailor traded over 85 licenses for a potential profit of 800 grand
in the filing it's alleged that the applicants have managed to exploit numerous loopholes in the
commission's translated assignment rules it also ledges that Perish Williamson and Atkin sought
to hide their conduct from the commission raising the concern that the permits were obtained by
fraudulent means and then asked the FCC to consider removing revoking the permits the group state
that the allowing of sale of a sale of naked construction permits in the broadcast services
is contrary to the public importance and corrupts the integrity of the commission's process the
harm to the public is especially onerous here because these translator licenses come at the
expensive future low power FM stations the filing then asked the commission to impose an immediate
freeze on all applications related to the translator window I didn't like that
got a bunch of crooks in bed with a religious course you know one good crook always finds another
on water sticks its own level and they're packing in you know that they're like D. James Kennedy
I don't know which ones for sure we can just imagine Paul and Jan Crutch the Reverend Dobson all
of his crap because of course that's what the you know the Paul and Jan Crutch thing I want
a Trinity broadcasting it's a pyramid scheme yeah speaking of Egypt and the pyramids and what they
did was they kept taking all of that money that they'd have those people send in all those poor old
desperate shuttons and you know with that number at the bottom of the screen and they would buy
more and more small TV stations all over the not just the country but all over the world right
and of course everywhere they go they keep putting the number on there raising more money pretty soon
they got like 80 million different towers up all over the world spreading their speed and raising
them millions and millions of dollars so Paul Crutch can share his goods with his boyfriend or whatever
and now here's the story from the New York Daily News don't let me forget I was going to read

William thadger doll at its global beat for new york university center for war piece in the news
meeting who is middle east correspondent for time magazine from 1989 to 1993 and he writes
made in america wahabism the christian right is their own brand of extremism and boy this he's got
a stuff right on it this is the la times couple days ago it was on our website wasn't it josh yes it
was good not that long couple pages there's a certain irony in the debate over installing the
ten commandments and public buildings the second commandment in the king james edition of the
bible states clearly not shalt not make under the any graven image or any likeness of anything
that is in heaven above or that is an earth below or that is in the water under the earth few people
take this as a prohibition against images of stars and fishes rather it cusses against in
doing a physical object be it a golden calf or two tons lab of granite with spiritual power
and trying to promote the commandments the christian right seem to have forgotten what they're really
about it also is overlooked the fact that there's several versions Exodus 22 through 17
Exodus 34 12 through 26 and due to round army five six through 21 different language and
Catholic Bibles and the Jewish Torah offer more variants which should be enshrined that's just
the kind of debate that's been responsible for religious massacres throughout the ages it was
in fact the mindless slaughter resulted from king Charles efforts to impose the church of england's
prayer book on Calvin and scott's in the 17th century they played an important role in convincing
the founding fathers to separate church and state the correct debate of course has little to do with
genuine religion what it's really about is an effort to assert a cultural point of view it's
part of reaction against social change and american counter-reformation of sorts against the way
our society's been evolving those pushing to blur the boundaries between church and state feel
that they're losing out much as in the middle east islamic fundamentalists fear they're losing
out to western values the reactions are remarkably similar in the Arab Middle East and Iran the
response is an insistence on the establishment of islamic law is the basis for political life
in the u.s school districts assert religious over scientific theory and biology class
tax dollars are going to be faith-based and the ten commandments are a punitive founding document
in fact George W. Bush may now find himself in the same kind of trap that ensnared Saudi Arabia's
founder king even soured to gain political support south mobilized the fanatical ultra-religious
Wahavi movement the movement that is spiritually at the core of al-Qaeda once the bargain was done
the Saudi world family repeatedly found itself held political hostage to an extremist
barely controllable movement populated by radical ideologues the evangelical movement in the
u.s. nudged the president back into the white house and Bush must now try to pair off the
political bill for its support in Saudi Arabia what drives the Wahavi's is a deep sense of grievance
and an underlying conviction that it returns a spiritual purity will restore the lost power they
believe once belonged to their forefathers a belief system that calls for stoning a woman for
adultery or severing the hand of a vagrant accused of stealing depends on extreme interpretations
of text that are at best ambiguous what is at stake is not so much service to God as the conviction
that it is still possible to enforce discipline in a world that seems increasingly chaotic the Christian
right is equally prone to selective interpretations of scripture and it's concern for a fetus for
example the fate of a child who emerges from an unwanted pregnancy gets lost some fundamentalists
are even ready to kill those who do not agree with them or at least destroy their careers they
seem to delight in the death penalty despite the fact that the Bible prohibits killing and Christ
advises followers the leave engines to God just as in the middle east the core of u.s. Puritanism
stems from an astounding astounding astounding astounding astounding astounding astounding astounding
in our case a made up u.s. people mostly by northern europeans alike in the godly worship
and in their understanding of what he stood for the founding fathers of course prefer the ideas
of the secular enlightenment which instead of anointing one religious interpretation provided
the space and security for each person to see God in his or her own or her own way perhaps the
strongest rationale for separating religious values from politics is that politics inevitably
involves compromise while religion involves a spiritual idea that can be harmed by compromise
no less a fundamentalist than Ayatollah ruler or a Khomeini once stated that if forced to choose
between Islamic law and Islamic rule he would choose Islamic rule yet the effect of that decision
has been to be trait Islam as genuine Islamic scholars and Iran are found themselves under continual
pressure to change the interpretation of God in God's will in order to conform to political realities
religion when incorporated into a political structure is almost invariably diluted and
deformed and ultimately loses its most essential power. Worse is that we've seen recently in the
Islamic world as in the Spanish Inquisition and the Salem Witchtrow's in the Christian world
a fanatical passion for one's own interpretation of justice under God often leads to horror the
fact is that it's Saint Paul so eloquently put it now we see through a glass darkly many women
interpret the deity but they're only human and by their nature they're flawed in that context
isn't it best to keep our minds open the ten commandments out of our public buildings are off our
governmental lawns and believe by example with the impression of this to see life the way we do
as Christ once put it and why be hold the style of the mouth that is thy brother's eye but
consider us not the beam that is in nine own eye watch out for that wicked beam pretty good stop
eh very good oh you didn't like it no I didn't like it birds didn't like it didn't I

What the hell are they?
Oh, I've got almost got you a coonskin hat one year that looks like that.
But they were it was shaped the same way.
Although Jesse Helms says he loves that coonskin.
Come in the QAM, hello.
How can he?
Yes, sir.
I got bad news for you.
Now, what is that?
Thanks to all fear and the accident that the oil, 15% of the oil that we used to get from Venezuela.
So long.
Oh, no.
They're trying to call my guy.
That's right.
They're trying to sell it to Asia.
Okay, Kenneth Smasmaksos.
He said Chavez or Hugo Chavez?
Oh, man.
Chavez got pushed by the ball.
Yeah.
And then Chavez is running around saying that Bush is trying to get him killed.
I can't imagine why.
Can you?
I don't know.
Don't forget, when you go to bed tonight, kneel at the bedside and put your hands together and say,
thank you, Mr. President, for those low gas prices.
Oh, why?
See you.
Thank you, Mr. President, for those low gas prices.
In fact, let's take a puke.
I never, ever turn on the gambling channel.
I do my gambling, you know where.
But let me just take a look.
Huh?
Did you hear me?
Oushanka.
That's not what it is.
That's what the big Russian hats are, Oushanka.
That's what it says here.
No, they only call it in Sri Lanka.
Oh, look at that.
The price of crude.
Boy, you're talking about crude.
54 and a half bucks.
Holy moly rat, man.
Even the Batmobile is going to have to stay in the stall for a while.
54 and a half bucks are galulin, man.
That is just, and they're saying this ain't nothing yet.
Wait till summertime.
You know, when they start really bleeding and fleecing the public,
because they know that everybody's on holiday and all summertime.
Everybody's driving to fourth of July and stuff like this.
And Canada Day and these things.
Oh, baby.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
$60, $70 a barrel for oil, which means you're going to be paying
like two and a half, three bucks.
And they'll say, oh, it's still a bargain.
They're playing four bucks in Europe while you know what?
Screw them.
$35 on the euro.
I don't think there's going to be too many of you
taking your usual European vacations,
unless you're really well healed.
You know what I'm saying?
I better win a few bucks over the weekend.
I'm going to have to cancel my Italy trip.
Speaking of Italy, the US must assume responsibility for the friendly fire killing
of an Italian intelligence agent in Iraq, in order to put the incident behind the two allies,
the crooked Italian Prime Minister set out on Wednesday, although here he's got a point.
He is maybe the biggest cook in the world today.
He makes Marlansky look like a boy scout.
Aiming to set the record straight, Prime Minister Silvia Velasconi,
country-dicted US military reports suggesting Italy may have been to blame,
for last week's ill-fated attempt to evacuate a newly freed hostage from Iraq.
Italy also denied ever bowing to political blackmail in Iraq or paying ransom to Islamic militants
for the freedom of kidnapped war reporter Juliana Serena after local media reports it up to $8 million change tans.
Only a frank and reciprocal recognition of eventual responsibility is the condition for closure of the incident,
which was so irrational to us that caused this so much sorrow,
Berlusconi told the Senate, caused them so much sorrow.
He might have to buy up all the newspapers now too, besides all the TV series.
Make sure that they get the news right.
Now get it right, part of the right.
Have like Mussolini liked it.
WQAM, hello.
Neil.
Yes sir.
What's going on?
It's George's buddy.
Yeah.
I want you to go for...
Somebody QAM, hello.
Thank you one.
I'm not going to listen to him.
What's the point?
QAM.
I know it's an actor enough, but we're about to meet the ranking.
To meet the ranking, ain't good.
There we are.
Of course he was an actor.
He was in some bad movies.
So he won't think about the comedians from the early days of television and the vlog bill long before that.
Most of them got in some really bad movies.
I like the Martin and Lewis movies for example.
You know?
Oh Jerry Lewis was in that...
What was the one?
The King of Comedy.
Which everybody says was really great.
I'll pick your word for it.
I'd rather watch Blue Velvet than watch it.
So Jerry Lewis movie.
Everyone said it was really great.
You know it was really weak.
Was it real?
Yeah, it was, I mean it was...
But he's for good sing man.
Rock, uh, buy your baby.
We did Gary Lewis melody.
Yeah.
But I like him.
He was funny back in the day and everybody liked Martin and Lewis and all that.
Because they were...
And on the ground floor of it, you know?
There were a lot of people of pioneers.
Dave Giroway horrible.
I mean, terminally boring, coma inducing.
And a lot of other people are Gary Moore, you know, just no talent whatsoever.
But they made it big because they were first.
They were their first.
They were pioneers.
See what I'm saying?
I mean if you ever saw the old today show with Dave Giroway and Frank Blair doing the news and the chimp.
Fred Mugg's, Jay Fred Mugg's the chimp.
You'd say, and Jack List Schooly.
You'd say, how could anybody have ever watched this?
I mean, the current today show is bad enough.
You know, it's horrendous.
But it's like fantastic compared to that crap.
When I look at these guns.
Forklift 2.95, which is the threat level 2 holster.
Okay, now it's threat level 2.
I think, okay, that...what exactly does that mean?
Forklift 2 holsters, it takes two positions to remove the firearm.
Two positions.
All right, so if I were...
Takes two hands to handle that law for man.
That's what's going to be to random.
No, that's what Milton Verl said.

But what do you hope it will be?
Terris.
And destabilizing the vital part of the world.
Okay.
Now in the next four years, what do you most want to accomplish yourself?
Play God.
What are you going to be able to do that others haven't been able to do?
Spread hatred and vilify the United States.
I hope that 50 years from now people look back and say,
George DeBio, a dictator, a tyrant, a thug.
Do you think all of that can happen in four years?
Yes.
I do.
And I am excited about it.
When 2020 returns.
The president just peed on the top of the city over the office.
Oh, absolutely.
And I intend to duty.
Okay.
Next.
If it's good enough for Linda Blair, it's good enough for El Presidente, right?
PM on the carpet.
Right.
That was an interesting scene when the priest was in there at the piano.
At toy-de-toy, the toy-de-toy, and then Linda Blair comes down and stands there,
staring at them and just very quietly, just pees on the carpet.
That was a little quiet about it.
Well, no, I mean, some of the quiet people are very still, but the sound of the tinkling hitting the floor of the carpet.
You're going to die up there.
Careful.
Join George tomorrow, five to seven at the...
Oh, yeah.
The seven to guys are going to be there again.
The Marooni used car and truck sell off going out of Dolphin Stadium.
Oh, you're going to be at the stadium right up there.
Sushi highway there.
I guess.
Wow.
Oh, sure.
How beats were they usually send you?
Well, not really.
Stop by the spin the wheel from President Joy Feeflut from Eline City, seven.
That's today.
No, today?
And look at it.
You know something.
I don't want to start getting bitchy, okay?
Any more than usual, which is plenty bitchy enough.
But are you looking at this same thing since you sent me a copy of it?
Oh, just reached for it right now.
That's today.
Is joined George tomorrow, five to seven at the end.
It says, that's today, five to seven at Dolphin Stadium.
Make up your mind, will you?
I ain't going both days.
Is it too...
I'm assuming it's tomorrow.
It's tomorrow.
No.
That's Saturday.
Saturday is tomorrow, last time we checked.
Eastern Standard Time.
Tomorrow, five to seven at Dolphin Stadium.
We go there early, get something I couldn't food from Eline City, seven.
And then pretend you're there to do whatever else is going on.
Make George, if you make him look good.
Five, six, seven, oh five, six, he...
I can't see him, or the one that calls all the time.
I'm a George, it's probably the one that looks forward to giving you a wish.
Still every chance you can.
Yeah.
That wouldn't success with the other day.
One of those professional agitators that you're right, obsessed.
Like they got with a fanny pack, the guy with the eyes, Greg in the Port Saint Lucie,
Andy in Hollywood.
What's his name?
Ron, the Prozac Ron.
Tromba.
That idiot.
The obsessed is not even close.
It's very insufficient to drive and describe the mentality of these people.
And I use that term loosely.
An mentality and people.
Let me see, what you can be all worked up for.
So I go out and watch your blue velvet.
WDQ-AM, hello.
Hi, Neely.
Yes sir.
Just a couple of thoughts on the gambling.
I think stuff for our row to get the stock machines they want only to respect
that the lobbyists are about to go to work and they're going to start spreading the money around.
And I think that's the congressman who are waiting for them.
And the second thing is, I think...
is what we're supposed to be.
They're going to make it meaningless.
They're going to cut the revenue down so much it's going to be a forest and it's going to just piss everybody off.
Right.
But you know how lobbyists spread money around up there and you know how they love money.
Good.
They're not willing to vote for it but they'll take the money.
Give them a bag of money, right?
And the other thing is, goldbendits and slots are.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
They'll benefit slots.
He's got...
He knows all about it.
Give them his own machine, baby.
Plenty of his guts out.
All right.
Take it easy.
He can be...
He can give the convocation.
You know, the invocation before they start opening the machines every morning,
there can be build benefit.
Gambleings are.
Talk about another big fat hypocrite man.
All these right wingers.
All of them.
Each and every one of them.
All the finger pointers.
Oh, your brothers, you're that...
Yeah, right.
Just like that Jeff Ganon, duckord piece of crap, turgay.
Faggot.
Five, six...
So what's this Atlanta thing?
They're making such a big stimulus about this.
Wow.
And of course, keep in mind that they're in Atlanta.
A lot of the...
Like these goofballs they got on there.
Sky Miles or Brian in this bitch.
Very well.
She spoke with us a little while ago.
We'll hear from her after a break.
Meanwhile, the search is still on.
We're going to see an in special coverage on courtroom security begins at 7th.
Make sure you didn't waste any time, did they?
Lastly, in driving a green Honda, we do have the license plate number.
We'll let you look at that as we had to break.
All right.
Six by the way, four Y-A-N, Joja.
You've got Joja on his mind.
Boy, oh boy, go get him.
Before he shoots up anybody else.
Somebody cue I am.
Hello.
Hi, this is Chris.
Hi, Chris.
How you doing?
Good, Neil.
I actually had a couple for the poll.
Nick Deltie was the first one.
Nick Deltie is his ugly as a sin.
He looks like a pile of elephant crap.
Yeah, he's looked worse over the years, too.
Yes.
Real bad lately.
Yes, since he keeps getting there.
You know.
And Cameron D.S. is a real butter face.
Really?
I think without him...
I think without him.
I think without him.
No, not me, I agree.
Oh, really?
Okay, I'm going to put her on marginal.
And the...
It was good, everything from the neck down.
She smiles and has charm.
That's how you don't notice.
Anyway, we love you up here in Bokka.
And you guys have a good day and happy 29th.
Thanks a lot, Palli.
Bye, Palli.
How about since we're putting people who actually are actors or actors of a sort, how about J-Lo?
Huh?
She's been in movies.
She...
Sure is, you know, if you call G.V.
and that other bunch of crap she keeps making movies.
She's ugly, man.
And she...
She's just...
Got a big...
Rackdom.
But she's married to...
What's his name there?
That's a...
Spirits...
Oh, brother.
That is just so amazing.
I mean, is he fooling anybody that food fly?
Is she fooling anybody?
You know that...
That benefit crap that we had to be subjected to in the...
Of course, the media...
The media just loves this stuff.
They just love shoving it down our throws.
Our actor hour day after day, week after week, you know?
Because basically, like they said, like Howard Beale said, we're in the boredom killing business.
Like us.
We got to like take the four hours in the middle of your day and try to like do a little tap dance here.
A verbal tap dance.
At least for a little pizzazz, a little something, you know?
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, you like that, right?
Sure we could do that.
Like those people that the appearances watch us do,
those sour old bitches from Detroit, which I'm sure they're dead by now, I hope.
Remember them?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we didn't put on a floor show for them, I guess.
They wanted us to do a tap dance.
Spend a half an hour with them.
There are all these other people lined up waiting for us to autograph those stupid pictures and everything.
And yeah, I did, it was just kind of sit there, you didn't pay too much attention to us.
You miserable.
I'd like to dig for it, we'd like to shoot both your brains out if you had any.
Oh, here's one of the winners.
Good thing you gave everybody a head start.
This man, see, who could say that he's their favorite, though?
Because the question is your favorite actor, I guess, who made it big in their early?
Gerard Depardot, bib bib bib.
He is Grotesque.
And the worst part of it is, there actually are women out there who think he's a sex pot.
Yeah, he's a sex pot.
Yeah, he's a sex pot.
Yeah, seriously, he's like a sex symbol for somebody who's a blind woman.
Yeah, Calvin Keller thought he was hot.
So the road looks like we probably do.
But it does say here, probably nobody's favorite.
And you're right, thank you so much.
Man, somebody ugly, and see, ugly and untalented, that's a bad combination.
Ugly, okay, a lot of us can relate to that.
But ugly and with no talent, what's the story there?
Maybe there's something there that doesn't meet the eye.
Now, this one, I'm not saying this to put him down because he's been on the singer ugly.
What's his name?
Julie Roberts, husband.
Lyle, I love it.
Yeah, Lyle, I love it.
What's that all about?
I don't know, don't put that down, Josh.
Yeah, I'll put it down.
You see, all you got is like whisper and aiming puts you down there.
Like, if I wrote, you know, 20 till two at 5, 60, WK, don't forget, J. Feeler and Moha were
David and Disafidore.
I think they're going to make a baby.
I really do.
They are tight, you know what?
What?
I can't get nobody.
Well, I don't know, but they're sure they should have been given a shot for the last couple
of years.
They are as tight as a snare drum.
Absolutely.
And so, J. O'Neill, with our good friend Moha, someone there, who knows when?
