When it comes to
Cool
He started
And made me
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.
As time went by, his earthly means compromised his choice.
He found the way to get really by altering young boys, father of juice, and food.
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.
He was happy and gay till he got close by some title tale.
Then the Vatican said, everyone off and he didn't have to go to jail, father of juice.
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, fun, you've heard of juice, altering for a day.
They sent him to a priest retreat where the genu flagged him prey.
If it was you or it was me, they'd lock us up and throw the keys away.
Father of juice, amen, fun, holy food, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.
Amen, boy, fun, holy food, fun, father of juice, amen, fun, father of juice, altering for a day.
Something like a bomb, it's 11.02 at 5.60 W.Q.A., and it's smoking.
Well, they have two holes.
Oh, speaking of that, about one in five ninth graders report having had oral sex
and almost a third say they intended triad during the next six months.
A small study of teens in Duke California Schools reports.
The teenagers average age was 14.5, also say oral sex is less risky, more common, more separable for their age, group than intercourse.
The researchers surveyed 580 ethnically diverse perverse ninth graders into California public schools.
Girls and boys reported similar experiences and opinions about oral sex, which surprised the studies lead author Bonnie Halpern Felscher, associate professor of pediatrics of the University of California San Francisco.
I think the stereotypes don't exist as much anymore, she said.
Girls and boys both see oral sex as not being a big deal, et cetera, and so on.
It goes on and on and on, but we don't want to get too deeply into that, do we?
No, not under the present climate under which year we live and operate.
I'll say that 5.6.7, let's see if we can get some causes as good as the ones in the first hour, okay?
I think there were a bunch of your first grade, the alter boys calling that first hour.
5.6.7.05.60? Why are they first grade?
Because of the Pope ain't there no more to lend them a helping hand.
5.6.7.05.60 on the Verizon singular wireless lines.
WNQYM, hello.
I'm kind of nervous, but...
Yeah, never less, I know. WNQYM, hello.
Morning.
Yes, sir, good morning. Where is this?
The bonus, yes. Is this the new Roger Show?
Yes, sounds like it.
Very good.
We answered you have like a pizza thing going on.
Yeah, that was last week, two weeks ago, yeah.
Right, two weeks ago.
Well, he mentioned my restaurant, this is Sarah's pizza.
Right.
We're still here and we're still doing this favorite pizza.
125th and what?
125th, Easter Biscayne.
Right.
We're still there, we go.
We've got that, that Pope's pastry pizza that we make for him.
Excellent, we'll listen, have a season pace off.
Yeah, two, I'll go for pace off.
Okay, and don't forget happy tissue book too.
Okay, give the Pope a kiss on a way out too, can't hurt.
Oh my god.
Exactly, okay, see.
Yeah, I think he said, Koshmer and talk of something like that.
Wow, that was great.
Well, that's good, no, Sarah's pizza.
That was good stuff.
Remember, I think they brought some bite of Koshmer pizza.
Absolutely, very thin, every now and then.
And it was Koshmer didn't have all that tray stuff on it like there
with a meat and cheese.
Ooh, you'll definitely rotten hell of you, tray pizza.
That's what Gary Sarnas says.
So anyway, Greg has been evidently, I have another inquisition to find out
who said those facts is.
They're from outside the building from P.V. Lenny.
Well, they say that's a large bird.
Maybe he wants to give them a cash reward.
Mark Eisenberg.
No.
That crants.
Yeah, remember they said nice things about it.
But it was being sarcastic, don't you understand?
Just trying to stir the pot.
Oh, okay.
W.A.C.Y.M. Hello.
Feed me, baby, I'm hungry.
W.A.C.Y.M. Hello.
Neil, out of your back, you've got to go to Jackson's on Las Olas.
And the only reason why that didn't get any votes on your check-up.
Can I ask you a question?
People can't afford this.
What?
What?
Wasn't that, how do we get back into this again?
It was two weeks ago.
All of a sudden, now it's said, well, I'm not going anywhere for food.
How do you like that?
I'm not going into anybody's house for dinner.
Thanks to my friend, Ken Halpern, from an action level for picking me up
and taking me back next week and all of that to the airport.
But I'm not going to your house for dinner.
And don't take it personally.
I'm not going to anybody's house for dinner.
I'm not going to restaurants.
I'm not doing these things.
Just when I was starting to feel like almost too many
and look at you, but a little who me, even with the balding eyes.
No, seriously, I mean, I'm not going to get stuck there.
Well, not at your back, you've got to go here.
Look, I saw the Humpern there on Saturday at the Florida Derby.
I watched that with Great This May.
And remember that song, June is vusting out all over.
Well, that's what kept running through my mind.
Eating in all of these restaurants and just shoveling down all these big meals
that is not the way to survive and stay alive.
Just ask my good friend, Fat Rich, he'll tell you.
By the way, I didn't go to his funeral either.
I never even saw a death notice on his obituary.
I never, never made it.
Of course, I didn't go looking.
But I did.
I went for days and days and didn't see it.
I kept looking under Rich Lackawitz.
I kept looking under Fat Rich from the New Roger Show.
Couldn't fight a thing.
None of his names, huh?
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.
When did you get busted for drugs and...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.
Hey, Niels, you catch that Bristol NASCAR race this weekend?
No, yeah, it was great.
Water race, baby.
Yeah, okay.
560, 7.0560.
Tom 560.
What are your bulls in your eyes for?
Now you get like me.
You got all the other information there.
Jesus.
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.
Hi, I need a job.
Okay, good.
Yeah, you need one, all right.
You need a hack job is what you need.
W.A.K.Y.M. Hello.
Yes, Anne on the mobile.
What is the Anne on the mobile?
You don't sound like Anne.
Oh, Anne.
Oh, Anne, how you doing, Anne?
Yeah, good.
How do you guys...
I'd like to talk to Neil.
You're speaking to him.
Yeah, I'll hold.
You're speaking to him, Anne.
I'd like to speak to him.
Yeah, I would like to speak to him.
He knows.
He knows, no?
Yes.
He just being a schmuck?
Yes.
Okay.
You're an idiot, Aaron.
Thank you.
Okay.
560, that was it.
That was our last call.
560, 7.0560.
I can get to my pile here or stuff, but good.
No, I'm not good.
While I'm here, I don't want to go through all of this stuff.
It's more fun to be in touch with these people.
Or a distance, start touching from a safe distance.
Can't you tell?
Oh, my God.
It's a bad news about Jerry Falwell.
He's getting a little bit better, so that's a bad.
David.
Here's the fact that when I was trapped in Catholic school for eight years, I was told
that if we were good when we died, we'd go to heaven, and we'll be made whole again.
For example, if you're in one like a man, you get your missing leg back in heaven, so that Jews get their...
Good Jews get their foreskin back.
Good question.
That's a good question.
That it is.
Oh, boy.
We'll have work on it.
Let's see.
Pull idea.
What movie?
Oh, no.
Okay, so.
One movie, are you most looking forward to this year?
No.
How do we know that?
How do we know what we're looking at the world?
We're looking at the world.
I'll let you know.
Finding Neverland.
Neverland.
So you didn't watch it at all, because I wanted a review.
I watched Little Bits and Pieces when Johnny Depp was on the screen.
Of course I did.
He was just like they're looking at him, but then I didn't put the headset.
I know.
I'll check it out on cable.
It did look too interesting.
David, a QAAM, hello.
Yeah.
Although Ruben Ciera was in it.
Yes, sir.
I got one thing to say about how he rose.
How he rose.
Who's how he rose?
You tell me.
I have no idea.
David, a QAAM, hello.
How you doing?
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Oh, how he rose.
How he rose.
How he rose.
How he rose.
How he rose.
How he rose.
Yeah.
Oh, this right about that fight.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
The big brawls coming at 155 this afternoon right out in the corner of Ivesdurian441.
Right in front of the truck sub center.
Should wait till tomorrow so I can bring my camera.
Okay.
WQAAM, hello.
Yes, sir.
I want to vote on the poll.
Whatever it is.
Yeah.
The poll is your out.
That's the poll.
Are you out in the answer with your unanimous?
You notice the disrespect that this audience shows here.
The holy father.
Right.
Just passed away.
You can't even turn on the food channel.
Now without seeing specials on the Pope did this and a Pope ate that and a Pope has
been a rest of his yet.
And exactly.
And look at that.
We're drowning in a sea of poppouris.
It's what we're doing.
That's good.
Yeah.
Drowning in a sea of poppouris.
And I don't smell too good.
I'll give it to you there right now.
Just in madness.
And again, this goes to show if the Dalai Lama would have croaked would we hit like five minutes
coverage on it?
No.
If the chief rabbi, the head Mashkiyach or whatever they come over there in Jerusalem, if he
would have croaked would they have like two seconds on it?
No.
If Pat Robertson died, we had like ten minutes on that and it would have been too much.
It went very foul while croaks which hopefully we very soon will have like ten minutes on that.
But the Pope man, the whole world was supposed to like goosefab, well there's the swish guard
and he perdi.
Huh?
And they have makeup on.
Did you see that?
No, no.
They have makeup on like clowns in a circus.
I mean that kind of makeup like Ruzgen mascara and little lipstick.
Oh my god.
Oh, it's a whole new moldy.
WQAM, hello.
Yes, hey good afternoon Neil.
Good afternoon.
Good evening.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, just a fight for rare visit for a few days.
And this is the welcome I get.
This is this is your material.
This is what you got.
This is what you got.
Of course we are following guilty.
We want to apologize again for a squeaky being on for Hank this morning.
It was an absolute emergency.
Our intermediate management for people say hopefully never happen again.
At least not while I'm around.
Oh, not in.
Oh, brother.
And you see what we're getting now.
Let's blame him for it.
Or maybe it's anticipating that's right.
That's it.
By the way, Moll knows he knows man.
We just kicked ass on Friday with that big trend.
We had solid in the morning.
Oh, you don't have rock solid on here.
That's what you don't have.
Oh, okay.
I'm making the list.
Oh man.
What's the name of number?
Belsenar 39.
Rock solid.
No wonder I don't feel.
I'm a little, you know, lost here.
Huh?
Is it in here?
Yeah.
Rock solid.
Aridis.
A little bit lower right now.
Tool free.
One triple eight four eight three loan.
That's one eight eight four eight three loan.
That's the main man.
This team put you into mortgage.
It meets your needs.
Avoid going to the wrong.
Or maybe being turned down because you call the wrong number.
Call the main man.
Exceptance cap or mortgage today.
One triple eight four eight three loan.
That's one eight eight eight four eight three loan.
And don't forget every time they close alone.
A portion is donated to kids in distress.
So why would you want to call anybody?
You also avoid the bait and swish.
Call the main man.
Anthony Calleander.
So today, Tool free one.
They say we never to the cold.
1118, you know, how difficult would it be for muff or clearance or both to go to the
morning wrecking crew in there?
The board often say, you know, when a hands-lapse break is over there like at 56 and 957, open
that pot all the way open.
Not just a little crack, you know, not the.
But like, yeah.
Excellent.
That's what you sounded like this.
Yeah.
I mean, why not?
Because they can't hear a damn thing anyway because they're just cracking it a little bit.
They got a little crack problem there and a more.
How difficult would you be for?
Right.
You should live so long.
He never stole it for eight three and one or seven.
I couldn't give a shaman about 98.
He preached bigotry in ignorance 83, which of course is the correct answer.
As close as they'll come to letting anybody say anything like that, they'll say, well,
he was a little bit too socially conservative.
Yeah.
But once every six hours they'll let somebody sneak one of those lines in there and other
than that, it's all just falling and carrying on.
As if the whole world is interested in as much a getchke's over there.
I just, it's amazing.
Or they'll mention it like it was a good thing.
Well, you know, he stuck to his guns with a lot of controversial issues.
Yeah.
Right.
He preached bigotry in ignorance 83.
That's the right answer.
He was a decent, you know, as opposed to indecency 76 and he was a snappy dresser 41 out
of the first 549 vote.
Here's the fact that says this goes to show you the kind of irreverent bastards we got
out there.
As a veteran of 13 years of Catholic education, I have to say your comment on the church
is being occult is absolutely correct.
Do we have that on here?
We have that either, do we?
Absolutely.
Just put it in your erector, huh?
You can also do it.
Recko, mo!
Were there crucifix on the end?
I'm not saying a word.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Go back to Canada.
Okay.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Maybe sooner than you think.
W-Q-A-M, hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
Sir, you guys are so correct.
I mean, so much can be said about the church.
I just limited it to this.
When the Nazis were stealing all those great worth of art during the Nazi regime, the church
was buying it for pennies from the dollar behind everybody's backs.
Yeah.
Okay, that's just one thing for information out there.
Bad for business though to be talking to stuff, it's very bad for business.
Oh, it's terrible.
It's like all those tabaldasters out there.
They swept that under their good because it was bad for business and costing them a fortune.
Yes, sir.
And there was almost nothing else on it.
Higher though.
Thank you, sir.
And Jimmy totally missed the point.
And that is I'm sure that there are many, many, many other important things going on
in the world.
For example, oil prices have just reached an all-time high at $58 of barrel.
People are paying $2.5 to $3 and more for a gallon of gas.
And there are people dying over in Iraq like craze, including more over the weekend.
And I would think that a lot of people with even just one I would have, they want to
find out what's happening in the world, should have a little bit of a choice as opposed
to this non-stop feeding else.
You're the one that everybody would watch.
Yeah, the panic is what I think one of them is seeing that.
But I guess that's the fact, right?
Because if the ABC let's say doesn't show it, then you might leave them and go watching
out somebody else and get them.
God for great.
That's right.
God forbid.
God forbid.
I wonder if God's going to be pissed off.
I'm going to be worshipping America tonight.
Oh, dammit.
You better cut that out, man.
You're going to be burning the hell pretty soon.
Brimstone in Hellfire, I can smell it.
Rick, who's another chronic factor, says, let's not forget the dark age.
He has 800 years of no technological advances.
Who knows how advanced?
Pope was a little chubby there before all of it.
He lost a lot of weight in recent things.
Well, yeah, that hospital diet does it every normal macaroni and cheese.
W.C.Y.M. Hello.
How you doing?
I'm sick of the pope, Nio.
I just want to voice my opinion.
Queen Elizabeth, all these people have roles with no real job, no debt in society.
Yeah.
Royal family, who gives a crap about the world family?
I'm about any of them.
Like a stuffy idiotic Brits.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
I'm a person.
Sweethearingham and being a real pro wrestler.
I've been beating him so hard
I've been beaten to 200.
Μoing fake commissionat sells my啊,
but right now, we have little stuff vibes today that you can grab down,
do it rock and roll and roll,
His favorite show used to be Wonder Rama. He used to watch with his chimp and his Rama.
Like Peter Panie refused his to roll. I put the blame on his great father Joe.
Walking around never landing his PJs, putting the children in, oh Jesus, you're a better
wild part of that. I think you get added to it. I apologize. Wow, that is really bizarre. You are the truth.
Truth. You are truth. Well, anyway, we're going to have our big brawl out there on
441. We're going to be selling tickets here at about 1145, which is right now.
When you're going to be on a street corner selling tickets, going to be a wrap, have a big
raffle, play a little bingo there at honor of the Pope. Don't forget gambling is
evil unless it's church bingo, then it's okay. Because the money's going to the right thing to pay off all
them lawsuits. By the way, speaking of lazy people and fat people, which year is this?
Agile TV is aiming to change away people watch TV with a voice control television control remote
unit remote contract sort voice control. Sure. You may have to well flick it. The prompted
remote is designed to replace a convention remote control includes a talk button and
it built in microphone together with an infrared receiver used in conjunction with the existing
cable box. The remote control translates spoken commands into speech features that are
sent to the receiver and then to a small runtime application in the set top box. The
actual voice recognition is performed at the cable head on and on commodity PC based
Linux system. For 258. Remember we read that article. Yeah. Right. Your congressman. Right.
That's right. Right to your congressman say we're pretty pissed off and fired up and we want to hear
QAM. And we're hearing this no a speaking English crap, which we already got more than enough of that in this
market. WQAM. Hello. Carry who? WQAM. Hello. QAM. Oh, ah. Hello. Yes, sir. See, I knew there was
somebody good there. Here's me. You remember when the pub came to Miami way back in
Haiti. Sure. Greg Veeville was he was my modifying and whatever he was doing. Moderating.
You remember what happened. Yeah. You remember what happened that day when you guys were
on the air. No. Remember how remember when lightning hit your transit or did not you guys off the air?
Must have been an act of God. You know what? That's what you said at the time. And then send it again.
At least I'm consistent. Hey, we love you, man. Okay. Have a great life. You too. Yeah. I think Jim
Brosmer was on top of that. And Greg Veeville was the moderator in it. Yeah. Really?
I think that didn't surprise me. No, no, not this day. Because especially now we got the God squad.
I mean, we actually I think what we're going to have is a big war between the fundamentalist
Christians, the Bible, Thumping Born Against and the Catholic Church of Catholics.
Correct. They've been doing it for years like, you know, in Ireland, other places but colluding right now.
No, they're not. No, they're not. They're they're at war for the they want the they want to take a hold of the reins.
The pie. Yeah. They want the whole pie. They're like the Indians. They're not satisfied with their slice.
They want the whole pie with it without popper Roni pie without poppy Roni WQAM. Hello. Yeah. Hi, Neil. I shut my radio. Please.
There we go. You know, this this guy, this Pope, this guy, like the same crowd move like with Reagan who was great.
They said he was great. Yeah. Of course he was. I mean, this guy, the Pope, he he presided over all the priests molesting
army's boys. Yeah. Nobody has ever you know, I know for getting into free passes, too. Yeah. And he would give more if he could be still.
I mean, what was his last act was boys for everybody? I don't know. Get out of jail.
Pope John Paul is gone. I just read he'd been hanging on by a friend when they found him in bed dead.
All the Catholics said they all said by Pope they said by Pope they said why did you have to go?
I told you so. I say I feel so bad. I'm gonna cry.
I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go. I told him that I go.

What is that? What is that? What is that? What is that?
That's the problem. Well, yes, come to Q. I. M. Hello.
You know, God. Yes, sir. Welcome back to the set pool. That is my life.
That's pool is the world, man. This is it. Two quick stories. One last week.
I'm in the car with my girlfriend and you're about to sign off and you break the news with the the fake.
Number two, and then run it over while you're at it.
Number two, you did the you've always talked about fish food.
So I go to the supermarket last week. And I buy two small.
I don't know. Pints. That stuff is like crack, Neil. Yeah, that's right.
I ate one. The other was in the freezer and I passed it by every day.
And I'm going to eat it. No, I'm not going to eat it. I'm going to eat it.
No, I'm not going to eat it. Just either. All I got.
Yeah, just either.
Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it? Do I do it?
WQ I am. Hello. Yeah.
How come Jimmy Saffalo always sounds like a fairy?
Well, I probably call him up and ask you ferry. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the
horizon and singular. Why was that? What do you laugh at?
I never gave it a thought really. Well, why? Give me syphilis?
I don't want to get into that. Okay, he is whatever he is. I mean, he's got a wife.
And I don't know what the deal is. And I don't care. He's an okay guy.
Kind of boring, but he's an okay guy. WQ I am. Hello.
Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay. Hey, Neil, are you going to be at treasure item?
Is one day? No. Are you? Come on, man. Yeah.
Are you? Yeah, man. Okay. You're going to be a big kiss right on the lips.
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the is a wireless thing.
They can have two birds. They want to have a color. Where are you driving today?
WQ I am. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Now that the boat died, you know, and
it was Polish. You know, all these things came up and everybody is coming with a
police jokes. Actually, I want to say that Polish are very smart people.
Do you know that they invented a toilet seat? Really? Did you know that?
No. And then they showed it to the Hungarian. They car a hole on it.
Have a nice day. That's older than he is. That's older than the
wireless older than toilets. Wow. That's older than John Krapper.
WQ I am. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Here's a go, sir. Did you have a
pro? Surrounded. Here's a go, sir.
Come on. I wanted to know where you was going.
So I fought boy this morning with his walking stick and he said, be sure
to tell them about dial mattress. I said, okay. That's a good idea. Now what
he said? Something like that. Yeah. How about listening?
Besides stories about PD Lenny and about Skippy. He had a kid or whatever.
See, these salespeople here, they think that we care about those.
I mean, PD Lenny had a different story. He's a different breed.

The bad date of quitsnithing glued.
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the TruHollywood celebrity music
biography profile story, they give us an introspective music that made us see
exactly how sucky things were in 1985. They were the Smiths.
So can we stop the interview? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I do these things all the
time. I mean, you're morisy, right? Yes. The guy from the Smiths? Yes.
I've had a solo career for many years now. Dude, I thought you were dead.
I thought you killed yourself for sure. Come on, you were so damn depressing.
How could you not kill yourself? You had to have at least wanted to kill yourself.
Did they send some other whiny, no-whole, Englishman in here just a fool me?
Look, I did know man, it's just so unfair. It's just not right that you are alive.
You know, I mean, what was that song about your girlfriend?
Girlfriend in a coma? Yeah, girlfriend in a coma. Oh, oh, damn.
Dude, when I heard that one, I wanted to slick my wrist. That's enough.
One and no from your feel sorry for me, Lyft.
And I wanted to take a header into a thrashing machine.
Hearing you sing made me want to lay myself down in front of a hammer.
Your music made me pray that a freaking serial killer would grab me and skin me alive,
hanging me from a meet-o until I slowly fled to death.
Whenever I heard your voice, nothing has. I don't need this.
Dude, what did I say?
But we're not doing the interview now? God, you're so depressing.
This myth, another reason it's a miracle we survived the 80s.
It's a big, juicy, sapping, with, look at your business tonight.
Uninside the behind.
Dude, they ought to make your comeback because there are a lot of coma and be giant now, right?
Yeah, everything is timing. Everything in life is timing folks.
Should've thought of that soon.
Probably 18 to 560 WQA and we got Moa too. We got the Mad Dog if foe. What's not to like?
Here's a fact from Mark and Helen Dale Beach.
Helen Dale Beach, that's not to like. He says,
Hany Ellen George heard the Old Testament will be read of the Pope's funeral.
You think they'll read the chapters regarding mass murder as a result of the alleged great flood?
The killing of man and woman and children who were sacrificed to appease God?
The condoning of slavery? The stoning of adulterers, women only of course?
In fantasize, partisize, a patricide, brother killing brother, cane and able,
self abuse, pluck out that eye, sexual mutilation, men cutting out their testicles,
those proof to God of their devotion, and on and on.
Great book, huh? The good book, baby.
Also my wife and fellow atheist grew up in South America.
At the age of 14 she figured out the Catholic Church was about two things, power and money.
Absolutely.
Her local and loving church responded by attempting to make her life miserable.
Fortunately she had a strong family that backed her decision to stay out of that house of hate.
Adios Nilo, thanks again for filling in for George.
No problem, Mark. Price is right.
Now Miguel just brought in and this is still in its original wrapping.
Still taped up.
So where did he get this?
Oh, I think that's one of our giveaways, as a matter of fact.
Oh, I see.
So they certainly nobody here bought it.
Finding Neverland.
And now you found it.
With Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet and by the way, he's a pretty rinshius.
Yeah, no.
Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman, in fact, I guess of the whole bunch.
And there it is.
Best picture of the year since the National Board of Review.
I got it in my hand right now.
Now do I take it home and watch it?
Do I take it back with me to T.O. and watch this?
On my high definition?
Well, we'll find out.
I don't know what I want to get some reviews.
Award winners Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Dustin Hoffman, Julie Christie.
Starting this magical tale about one of the world's greatest storytellers
and the people who inspired his masterwork Peter Pan.
Well-known playwright James Embiri, Depp finds his career across roads.
When his latest play flops and he and Daugler's question is future,
then by chance he meets a widow Winslet and her four adventurous boys.
Together they form a friendship that ignites the imagination.
He did a produce of Barry's greatest work.
And in Channing Big Screen, too, with an acclaimed cast of stars,
Finding Neverland has been hailed as one of the year's best motion pictures.
Yeah, somebody hailed it.
Oh, Michael Jackson.
I don't know.
Maybe he likes those boys.
Now seriously, I mean, Finding Neverland.
I mean, talk about time.
I just have a little tacky right now.
Yeah, well, the way things are going right now.
You see what I'm saying?
I know.
Catch my drift.
Coincidentally.
Anywhere I'm still thinking, you know, girl on a coma, bring it back.
Which I'd have thought of that sooner.
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a variety of singular wireless lines.
A marginal response here today at best, I would say.
By the way, we're praying for the hopper to be back tomorrow.
Wow!
That was really great.
The Rosary is later.
Yeah, I'm rubbing my rosary beads.
Very hard.
York, this is the 14 years of his life here.
And a Chris Blow it out, your ass.
Chris Matthews there on the MSNBC.
No wonder nobody watches that crap.
W and Q.A.M. Hello.
Damn, peach to the media.
Yeah, and peach to media.
I'm with you, Pally.
And peach all of them.
Butchered, raver, rubbing, lunatics.
On and on and on.
In a feeding frenzy.
The holy father.
He ain't my holy father.
He ain't my unholy father.
My father was unholy enough.
Fasted.
W and Q.A.M. Hello.
Back at you, dad.
W and Q.A.M. Hello.
Nill.
Yes, sir.
Damn, that time, if only you threw to you.
Yeah, well, here you are.
Here you go.
Here's your big chance.
I listen to you every morning at work.
And I love you, man.
You're a wonderful show.
I am a wonderful show.
Yes, you are.
I give you credit.
I don't know how you put up with someone before.
But you get called.
I know.
So what do you got, man?
I don't know what to think about.
This is the whole Pope thing, man.
At first it's Terry and I spoke.
God, what else are they going to talk about?
Don't forget, Johnny Cockerman.
What does he, small potatoes?
Yeah, hopefully, maybe Bush's next.
Hopefully.
Hopefully.
God, I hope.
Hopefully.
Okay, thanks.
What do you say?
Who's next?
Right.
5670560.
What do you say?
I dumped it.
That's what he said.
I told you to earn the break.
Oh, now I see him.
Yeah.
He's mumbling.
I know.
I'm glad you were able to hear it.
Oh, yeah.
That's all we did.
A little knockout.
A little knockout.
Oh, wait a minute.
Just a joke.
I got the sentiment.
Right.
Oh, nice.
Very nice.
Okay, don't call us again.
Okay, keep listening.
We're glad you enjoyed it.
But you're like a little bit like that.
Okay, a little slow.
WNQAM.
Hello.
But the two guys there.
WNQAM.
Hello.
No, folks, folks.
No, no, no, no.
WNQAM.
No red neck, right?
WNQAM.
Hello.
Okay.
What do you know?

Just the guy's voice.
WNQAM.
Hello.
Sounded like Duford.
Like Ed Wood.
Ed Wood.
QAM.
Oh.
WNQAM.
Hello.
Hello, Neil.
Yes, sir.
I like that a bit you did for trying to get carry elected and stuff.
And then a couple of summers ago when Penialist was trying to get that metro rail group.
Uh-huh.
But I think what we should really be worried about is not all these dead old crap as well.
But the guys who got over in Iraq and Afghanistan that are getting blown up.
Who are they?
I don't know does anything going on over there.
Oh, we're fine.
We're going to ask you V drivers that don't they should hand out body bags with the gas station.
But these people can think about what they're doing to our father, sons, and daughters over there.
I'll do great.
Robbers driving them gas sucking SUVs, George.
We're going to give you a body bag out of way out of here today.
Don't blame me.
90 bells got one ready for you already.
There's nothing to do with mine.
90 bells got one ready.
Okay.
Body bag.
Your name's on it.
He told me.
Come in to QAM.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
Two good to meet you.
Thank you.
I have no idea what it was.
I'm just on the sofa.
Discussing.
Go test.
Go wash out your mouth with body wash.
In fact, don't go wash out your mouth with soap.
Might as well do something useful for you.
I got no bar at home.
You can have fast.
Take a bite.
QAM.
Hello.
Hey, Neil.
It was going on, man.
How are you doing, pal?
I take this out.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you ever watch South Park?
No.
No.
Okay.
Well, you missed this week.

Well, that's why it had to be a virgin birth.
You wonder, of course.
All those virgin births.
And by the way, before Jesus there was a whole,
there all these stories went on for ever and ever.
All these virgin births.
That was part and part of all religions.
It was that it had to start with a virgin birth.
It was an act of God.

How dare you all be so insulting to us.
It's the Christmas season and you represent them as a Pope.
You think it was a stupid, it was hateful and it shouldn't have been done.

You'll see Cliffs says since the media wants to keep us all involved in the Pope's death
I think it's fair
We should all be involved in voting for a new Pope like the Pope idol if we vote for American Idol
Why not to put an Eric Idol the Pope idol and will stretch it out for weeks and then we'll all both smoke at the end George
Bies all right George will hook you up. How's that? That's right with the hose right
Could be a lot of smoke blow in fact is not the specialty of the church is blowing smoke sure no one does it like these guys

What a contest for you
I'll bounce in your son of a bitch. Well, I wish was granted and I'm sure gonna miss listen to the Nile Roger's fair and balanced
Well, the two of you son of a bitch
You probably wondered why gasoline is three dollars a gallon although the experts say there's really no shortage and
Maybe you've also wondered why when the price of oil goes up your local station raises gasoline prices immediately
But when the price of oil goes down it takes forever for those gas prices to drop and maybe you've also wondered why the price of gas is at an
All-time high even though we've spent billions of dollars and thousands of lives to make Iraq our bitch
Well now there's an oil company that tells you the truth
We're April fuels at April fuels. We're not afraid to tell you there's really no oil shortage
In fact half of our wells are shut down and we've got refineries running at less than half their capacity
Why so we can charge more of course at April fuels?
We don't care if our stations are colorful and well-lighted because you're gonna pay whatever we charge
At April fuels we believe in the law of supply and demand
We've got the supply so we make the demands
So remember the next time the president tells you we have to invade a Middle Eastern country or go under endangered wildlife
From a national park it's because of us
We're April fuels of the vision of Chevron oil
You better
101 at 560 WNM. I'm all how we're David whatever his name is coming along with two in the Mad Dog at four and then after that well
Now as far as Iraq is concerned speaking of that
It's interesting that one of the few areas I would agree with a Pope on was he was
vehemently against the war in Iraq the Iraq attack
He was right on that spoke of it often and we hear almost nothing about that all these
Any trade-in words that are being spoken now non-stop on every American news outlet including even the
Discovery Channel is just incredible even on TV land
It's just everywhere and they say nothing no because that's just
It just don't fit in with the a plan right now
Because the Christian the organizing of America you know has to step aside for a moment so that the Pope
I mean that's all a part of it and it would convert all those people back over to likely
I know whatever separate jet bush
Well, she smelt it in that religion and it kind of

Spreading his nose
Spreading his tone is bullshit everybody's just listening to him, you know all these moronic
Faithful graded, but this one he didn't know what to do with then finally he grabbed the microphone and yelled into it
Philancio now that people didn't want any more of that because he had enough Philancio during the Somoza regime
And if the army wasn't there to safely would have clinched him right there and then wouldn't that have been something
That's the only only
Five millions of people in Africa would still be allowed today for all

Gross out by this display of absolute
Faggery you pretend you're not brainwash for it. Yeah, just just for a moment
Set aside all the brainwashing and the fact that your parents did evil things and put you to you know
Perky school, but just pretend that you're like a rational thinking human being and you look at all to say what a crock

Religious fervor and just lunacy that's just sweeping the country the all-new dark ages
The God squad is taking over America like old jubich also established a toll free number that residents can call the report

Tampa Bay outfielder Alec Sanchez
You know nobody knows who he is even George don't know who he is even I don't know who he is
You know with the steroids and he's penalized me go those who is a 10-day suspension
Even the general man who the Yankees last night they asked him oh by the way. That's a hot babe. They got there in a broadcast

In cook a lot of these broads they have like an aside lines. They're so weak and they don't even look good

So she's asking the gym in the Yankees now is that 10 games or 10 days and he's like
I don't know and then they showed they showed about by the by the 16th
steroid offense you get a spanking from Bud Steel again across your 10 bucks. Yeah

Moody. There's some real mung in this joint. Well, maybe I won't be able to stay all week
Wtqam hello
Yeah, they should have got old Jay up there. Yeah, okay good. 70 Qaam hello
Qaam not there. What a shame that was gonna be the real good one this hour too
Wtqam hello
No, the late one Wtqam hello. I don't know. Okay, sir. I was wondering
You think you could maybe read us by chance the Empire America peanut report. It'll be nice read no no
567 05 60 pound 560 on neighbor rising in singular wireless line
Yeah, the peanut before how about if I just read you the encyclopedia Britannica? I was at Wtqam. Hello
Neil yes, sir now I was wondering if you were George who had to help me out and finding out if
Edward died on Friday or not we died. I don't know about Friday, but he died he died. He's dead. He's definitely is he's definitely a dead is a donail. How's that?
I'm gonna cry about that. Okay. Have a good cry. Oh
Although maybe not maybe not completely dead. Maybe he was likely killed. There you go. Maybe there she's on a tube
Right. Maybe they were keeping him alive. We run them real long. She was
Saw Ken Maul in there. Ken got a little uh, he grew some of the hair on his chin that I got out of my head there go tea
A little bit of a growth Berkeley since he's got a growth Wtqam. Hello. Yeah, she can't tell us where it is though. Yes, sir
Hey, uh, just uh wanted to say something about the Pope sorry he's gone and
Well, hopefully they take a young one because according to some
Book that the Catholic Church saw it out about a hundred years ago
The next troker is the last one and then it's the end of the world. Oh, no
How do you like that really the next one that's what no stir it and no stir old aim is said
Well, then they better get a young one right yeah about 15. Oh, in fact, maybe the Cardinals can like pass them around a little bit first
Prober 13. How many QAM hello? Yeah, yes, sir. The only good thing the Pope ever said by the way
Yes, you know that guy where you had a conversation with earlier. He was against the Iraq war
Yeah, I remember Bush went over the before the war and then Bush went over there after war
Come on like you know join me on this and he wouldn't do it
So that's the only thing that I ever agree with him being a next Catholic and you know knowing that they're all full of Christ
And don't forget he also said come on Easter come on Easter. That was about it. That would be
One another thing he had issues with memory with the priest thing
I think they were saying that the Americans are making too big of a deal about it. Yeah, that's right. They swept it out of the carpet
Yeah, they did okay, see you and they did a very good job of that too
It surfaces ugly head if I can say that briefly here a couple of months ago
But then they just swept it back under there again
And now of course with all this going on and you notice every once in a while I'll make sure about that and and they're praising him
That's the thing that's amazing to me. They're praising him for confronting and tackling these sex abuse issues so strongly
Which occurs is ludicrous while they were schlepping him from one one that dies
East to another and then of course you'll recall cardinal law it took about how many trips
They finally came to okay the pressure is too great. You got to step down over a thousand reports
Just last year's right the dog and pony should right over with the over fantastic job like I said it
Not ending it of covering it up. Yeah, we're gonna get out of the carpet. Okay, because it's a brotherhood of pedophiles is basically what it's all about
So what can I tell you everybody needs a group to belong to right? Right. That's right. They make Namla look like a bunch of bikers
At least Namla's honest about it and it plus they got a good text in them status. What's not to like
Namla
QA.A.M. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I'm moving to Canada. Yeah
Yeah, you want to move all right real fast in fact go have a movement sounds like you need one
And don't send us any more factors. Okay. We're not interested. We can't stand you
Well, in fact that fat boy see he encourages this crap. He does yes, because he thinks it's very amusing
He does next time he comes waddling in here again before I leave this week
I'm gonna take that walking stick a his and just stick it. You know try to have a serious conversation
You can't do it about that. Yeah, you want to about that phenomenon
Can I tell you something? Keep this in mind. I don't forget this. You cannot have a serious conversation with a silly person
You know how you're always saying about you can't you can't say crazy people right well silly people are no better
No, it was in a different way. Maybe they're not quite as dangerous, but they're annoying
They're crazy and you cannot have a serious conversation with a person who is perpetually a silly person
Just like that whole thing in here this morning about PD Lenny and his cat and about Skippy
I don't care about any of that or the cat all of a cat did find his way back home. I don't believe it. I don't believe it
Cat found his way home from the Everglades the
The guy the neighbor takes the cat dumps it out in the middle of the Everglades and the cat finds its way back to their house
The PD Lenny house you believe that no although dogs if I'm the way yes across country right in Green Bay, Wisconsin
I don't forget that with a bloody pause and the whole thing the dog came like to the door and like
Die it over you know like that a dog yes cats are
Dumber than sawdust man
They are I know they are put it in the microwave for a couple of minutes. You'll see I think that's a perfect idea
Just a joke. I'll do little kids out there do not put their hand in the microwave for more than a hand
Conviction of love and please right on slow cook
First of all if PD Lenny's got a cat he deserves to have the cat take out
First of all his cat was dumping in his a neighbor's truck over and over again from that story
I got here even brought me the story like I care about that yeah
Yeah, the cat was dumping into guys truck and the guy finally dumped him in the Everglades
Now if you want to do a real service you could dump PD Lenny out there too. It would have been a good idea

So Berkeley from our sales department just comes in with a lovely gift for yours truly from borders
And I thought oh, this is neat and I started opening it up and I saw picture on the back
I thought it was you read through Franklin from an angle. Yeah on the back kind of back pain
Oh, and apologies to you read through it too because believe you me and I open it and here on the front cover presenting
Celia Cruz and I thought to myself
I mean that is got to be she makes me look lovely and I don't care what anybody said us seriously
She has got to be the most grotesque bitch. I have ever seen in my life
But enjoy the book on the
In La Coye don de vivo and that lovely don de vivo. Sorry. Sorry context. Oh, and there she is with Mark Anthony
Can't ask my motto. That's a question there, huh?
Holy moly rat man. Mark Anthony look at her. She looked like she went to hell and died or the other way around
Man, and she looks like a guy cedar Cruz. I wouldn't be surprised. I've been sent after a long time
I know she might have something there. She had a husband, you know, well, maybe he didn't maybe she didn't and he didn't
I have I mean, you know, it's not bad enough with all this stuff with the Pope
And now we got to get to see the crews again today, which was the farthest thing for my agenda
I think Berkeley's trying to throw us off the scent off the trail
In fact, you ever see the Pope and see it together maybe same person, huh?
Maybe that's when she disappeared. She became ill papa because she sure had the goods now
I got a good article here speaking of goods and that's it read it though
Because I see Miguel's he's still hanging out in there and I have no idea why by the way
I think he's hiding from somebody. Oh, well from Josh's mother

While Terry Shiveau lay dying in her hospice he was escorted to and from work by armed police and his home and family have been under police guard
He's been sent tens of thousands of emails many calling him a murderer and threatening him with harm
Some of the local papers in Florida have been prepared to publish the most extraordinary letters about him
One letter writer asked whether he was related to the Nazi mass murderer Joseph Mangala or was just a student of his
George Greer is a 63 year old judge of Florida Circuit Court the equivalent of county courts in Australia
He's a conservative evangelical Christian. They committed republican in 2000
He ruled that Terry Shiveau who had spent 10 years and what doctors who examined her said was a persistent vegetative state
Following a heart attack would not have wanted to be kept alive. He ruled that her feeding
Tube be removed and accordance with Florida law or husband Michael rather than her parents was her legal guardian able to make decisions about her treatment
There followed five years of court appeals against his ruling after the US Supreme Court all dismissed and two failed attempts by president George Bush's brother
Fat ass jab the Florida governor the past legislation over ruling him when the appeal process seemed exhausted judge
Greer ordered miss Shiveau's feeding tube
Removed while judge Greer had been subjected to abuse and threats into his initial ruling
It wasn't until the order they feeding tube
Removed two weeks ago, which prompted leading republicans in congress and president Bush to get involved in the Shiveau case
That the vilification and death threats seriously escalated the flight of judge Greer in battle threatened and vilified as a murderer has become a metaphor for the way of life and death of miss Shiveau
As been used by some republicans including George Bush to assuage the party's conservative Christian evangelical base
Many believe it was evangelical activists who brought off the voters that delivered Mr. Bush's second term last November
And republican majorities in both houses of congress pressured by conservative activists senior republicans house majority later
Tom delay and senator bill first decided congress had to pass legislation forcing me federal court to review judge
Greer's decision and look at giving guardianship of miss Shiveau to her parents
What had been a private family tragedy with all the bitter family disputes is often a company such tragedies
became a fearsome ugly battle in america's culture wars
Mr. delay under pressure for taking questionable junkets from lobby groups and with some of his Texas staff indebted for leds campaign finance offenses
Set the tone for what was to follow
He justified the extraordinary Sunday sitting of congress to pass what he called emergency legislation to save miss Shiveau's life
The calling judge Greer's decision and active medical terrorism and the removing of her feeding
Sheeube murder
Bill Frist a well-regarded heart specialist and potentiary republican candidate in for president in 2008
Said he had looked at video of miss Shiveau and concluded she was conscious and responding to her parents
Members of congress at the start of a two week break were called back to Washington and forced to vote on the bill
Most admitted they knew a little about the Shiveau case
George Bush flew back from his Texas ranch to sign the legislation while he didn't repeat mr. delays in
Climateary language his support for mr. delay was implicit in his dramatic return to Washington
Two weeks later with miss Shiveau having died and perhaps it last allowed a return to the private obscurity
She apparently always wanted there is going evidence the republican party is split over the involvement
Some say exploitation by congress and the present of the Shiveau case
Poles have consistently shown that despite the radio shock jocks and the history on the Fox cable TV network
About 80% of Americans say congress and mr. Bush should not have gotten involved mr
Bush is approval rating as slumped over the past two weeks falling seven points to 45% in the polls
And after the federal court and floater refused to hear the Shiveau
Rehear the Shiveau case rejecting three appeals by miss Shiveau's parents for the feeding
To be reinserted many republicans expressed concern at the way mr. delays in temperate language had encouraged vitriolic attacks
That's just on judge Greer, but all the judges involved in the case
The splitting republican parties between the so-called social conservatives for whom the main issues are abortion
Game marriage and the defense of what they call Christian values and economic conservatives who want small government
And believe congress in the prison have no right to involve with decision made by state courts writing in the New York Times
former republican senator and former ambassador to the when John Danforth said
Republicans have transformed our party into the political arm of conservative Christians
The elements of this transformation have included advocacy of a constitutional amendment to ban game marriage
Opposition to stem cell research and the extraordinary effort to keep Terry Shiveau hooked up to a feeding tube
He said Grover norquist leading republican strategist and self-described economic conservatives said senior republicans in congress and mr
Bush had misread the public on the Shiveau case
I think a lot of conservative leaders assumed there was broader support for saying that they wanted to have the federal government save this woman's life
He said David Davenport a senior fellow with a conservative Hoover institution said the bitter attacks on judges by mr
And other republican politicians was disturbing the court process has worked even if it hasn't given the result that the social conservatives
Want he said for congress to step it is really a violation of federalism
After learning that mr
Shiveau had died George Bush was circumspecting his response extending his condolences to her family and urging Americans to continue to fight for a culture of life
But mr
Lay was no less inflammatory saying mr
Shiveau's death was a moral poverty and illegal tragedy
This loss happened because our legal system did not protect the people who need protection most and that will change
He said the time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior
There was outrage even among republicans that this clear threat to the judges who were involved in the Shiveau case more than
30 of them, but that's unlike the the consul judge Greer in other words
Watch out when you start your car in the morning right right so there you go

But with certain retaliations, you need only one, the soonies gonna get dressed
The soonies gonna get dressed in one more year, you'll never win
You need no child, be high, by sending them off the dial, or that's insane and homicidal
And some them are genocide, they expect that they don't be fired
They expect that they do lose their choice, I don't need Jesus for sure
I don't need the Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure
They're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure
The soonies gonna get dressed, the soonies gonna get dressed in one more year, you'll never win
You need no child, be high, by sending them off the dial, or that's insane and homicidal
And some them are genocide, they're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure
They're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure, they're no Jews for sure

A majority of the U.S. Catholics surveyed what the next pope would have a theological outlook similar to that of Pope John Paul the tooth
But they would also like to see changes on issues such as birth control, stem cell research, and allowing priests to marry
According to a CNN USA Today Gallup Poll, released yesterday, large majorities of Catholics and non-Catholics
They believe the next choice of Pope matters to the world in telephone interviews mostly conducted before his death
2-3rd to the 254 Catholics, Paul said John Paul the tooth will go down in history as one of the greatest pountiffs
Not the greatest, but one of the top 500
21% of respondents said he'll remember it is great, but not among the greatest
And 9% of those surveys said John Paul be considered a good or average pope, only 1% said he'd be below average
Of course average, I mean look at the group back in history
Asked about the select of the next pountiff, a third said they want to poke more liberal, just 4% said they want somebody more conservative like a till of a hun
More than a half, 59% said they want somebody about the same as John Paul the tooth
78% said the next pope should allow Catholics to use birth control 78%
63% said he should let priests marry so that we don't just have this fag club going on
It's not a democracy
And 59% said the next pope should have a less strict policy on stem cell research
That sounds like that scientific mumbo jumbo to me, you know, God's rule is that a matter of human polls
55% well it seems to me the church is a little bit too interested in everybody's poll
55% said the next pope should allow women to become priest, 44% said he should not
55 to 44% said the next pope should allow women to become priests
Bible says no
A majority of you as Catholics pulled support John Paul's unwavering stance against a vassion
Asked whether the next pope should have a less strict policy, 59% said no, 37% said yes
And respondents were split on the question of divorce
Asked whether the next pountiff, unlike John Paul, should allow Catholics to divorce and remarry, 49% said yes, 48% said no
See this is what's been going on forever
Forever and ever
Oh, well we like him so much and he's so inspirational and the holy father he's like forever
But in the meantime all in, like in Italy they don't pay attention to anything they keep having elections
They keep having a referendum
Wow
Undevorious
All of these things and whatever he says they do the opposite
Overwhelmingly
And that's because 90% of them don't go to church
Good
Right, exactly because they're onto it man
See, see when something is right there in your own backyard
Right
And when you realize that it has been there for a long, long time
And when you're under their thumb and you realize how repressed you are because of their attitudes and their behavior
And their stranglehold they have on your lives
Oh, you resent it and you don't participate and you don't support it
As opposed to the not in Germany where they love the people they love the Nazis
Right, they did
Sure
Yeah, in the beginning they were a little bit suspect but after a while I saw in Deutschland who Boralos sounded pretty good
You know how hard is it to put your arm up and you're going, how Hitler, how Hitler
You know, like that
Neville Chamberlain founded very easy
Pope Pius thought it was okay
Joe Kennedy, I didn't have any problem with it
Charles Lindbergh thought it wasn't too bad either when he came right down
But what can I tell you?
Just believe whatever they tell you on television that's all
Here's the religious impact of the death of the Holy Father
She was a worldwide terrorism which is really the threat of our time
Right, let me say again the Pope was vehemently opposed to the Iraq attack
How come we're not hearing a lot more about that?
How come we're not hearing about the fact that El Presidente was going there on Friday to put on a good dog in Ponyshow
and make his obligatory appearance
How come he just ignored him? He snubbed his nose at him
He gave him the old Bafangula
He still do that over there right?
Oh yeah, even though he's Polish he knows how to do that
Oh that's right and he probably threw him one back
That's right, he gave the old Italian salute even the Polox can do that
We got our thousand votes I believe
You think we got him?
Oh yeah, thousands of peace of cake, Trojia, cake

In the beginning, he had seven of his three in the heart.
For the greeting, he speaking of a non-juove wive...
is what I'm hearing.
Or is there just a bong?
You knew he had some pull of Harvey.
Anyway, disrespectful, shameful on you, terrible.
You don't want to jump on a bad one.
You don't want to participate because the media tells you you should say this.
And you should think that and I say screw the media, okay?
You're a bunch of lunatics.
You're a bunch of crazy people.
Why can't you leave all the rest of us alone?
What they're doing is exactly the reason why so many of us resent this whole.
In other words, if you want to get all weeping and all bent out of shape,
great, go ahead, go do it.
But it's a private, religion is private, okay?
It's like taking a dump.
And they're dumping on us big time with this crap.
I'm pretty tired of it.
Not yours though, he can't get enough of it.
Oh yeah.
Don't interject so much.
I'm sorry.
What's his, she was good.
Yeah.
He's in the dressing room.
I haven't listened to why I'm with him.
Go get yourself straight now, honey, okay?
Go get yourself some help.
Go get a psychiatric exam.
Go get a lobotomy.
We didn't stick a shoe.
Your brain is supposed to be 1024 votes.
What's your take on a pope on the late pope?
I'm not so sure.
Well, I'm almost as upset about him as I'm the late Jesus Christ.
He was a great man, 272.
I couldn't give a shmit about him, 201.
Never throw a freight train, 183.
He preached bigotry ignorance, 154.
He was decent as a, you know, okay, 142.
And a snappy dresser, 72.
Speaking of snappy dresses,
